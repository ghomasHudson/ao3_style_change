The door was more substantial than the hatch had been and Sherlock zeroed in on it immediately. This was merely the front room, the liminal phase before the full immersion, the bedroom as it were. He felt energised as he reached for the latch, knowing John had his back.
“This.” Sherlock pulled the rolled up piece of yellow wall-paper from his pocket and straightened it out on the counter. The woman looked at it and made a face.
John had an elbow on the counter and was looking up at Sherlock, and Sherlock could feel it without having to look back at him. John was worried and apprehensive, too, and wanted Sherlock to know it (Sherlock was AWARE, thank you, because John was the most obvious person in the WORLD).
“And you expect me to feel guilty as well.” Sherlock leaned forward. “You want me to admit I made the wrong decision when I decided not to take the case because you want me to have made that decision for the
The TEDIUM. It was beginning to grate unbearably on Sherlock's nerves. He didn't even have the assurance of retreating into banter and sweeping announcements of his own opinions (except in the privacy of his head which was hardly the place to keep such things). It was SO BORING. He had to LIE DOWN and STAY STILL and BE QUIET.
There was no reply from which he knew John was quite mad at him for leaving him behind. Or forgetting him. Or both. These two things weren't mutually exclusive as Sherlock had left John behind a number of times completely intentionally.
“Promises,” John murmured, eyes closed again. He still smiled and his face was peaceful and clean of lines.
“So instead of ringing the police, you came to see me,” Sherlock said after having wrestled down his irate desire to leave the girl to his fate as punishment for her disability to write simple sentences. Sherlock did not believe in heaven or hell but he wished that people who couldn't make the difference between
Mrs Haversham brought him a glass of water and he took the opportunity to down another handful of paracetamol along with it, which had been John's intention all along, no doubt. The lady sat opposite them, across a coffee table finished to such a high shine that Sherlock could've used it as a mirror when shaving.
“Yes!” Sherlock cried out. “John, grab anything that burns and pile it up. Now!” His hands shook as he grabbed the nearest heavy object (a paper weight shaped like a fish) and smashed the door of the glass cabinet to retrieve the small box. It was tightly sealed to protect its contents from the ambient moisture which was considerable. It was also quietly humming, clearly refrigerated by battery power. Sherlock tore the box open, bringing out a tiny Sure-Seal bottle. He tossed the box away and put the bottle carefully on the edge of the table and rushed to help John.
Sherlock picked up a piece of toast and dipped it in some egg yolk before gnawing on the corner of it. “I must find out how to infiltrate this secret society.”
“Three,” Sherlock insisted (it might have worked, John could be worked into a state of confusion with conflicting statements).
The first thing Sherlock did was to go and open the wardrobe, then he ran his hand over all of John's jumpers and cardigans, he rearranged the socks and removed the button-up shirt with the tiny grey gingham pattern that he hated because it distracted his eyes. He picked up a soft and worn cardigan and managed to pull it on (experiment) despite his crutches. Then he approached the bed.
Sherlock pushed the door open and John leaned in, gun pointed in. Light came out of the doorway and landed on John's face which had turned from determined to confused in a blink. He checked the corners again, advancing into the room, while Sherlock tried to contain his explosive curiosity.
“Glad to see you're getting your powers of speech back.” John smiled at him, unbearably kind, unfathomably caring. There was no one who loved Sherlock more or in the same way as John did. “Though you sound like an idiot.” John's smile had turned into a grin, only a brief one before he was sober again, on the phone to Lestrade, walking from room to room. There was a tank in each one.
“If you want to be absolutely PEDESTRIAN.” Sherlock crossed his arms and glared at the ceiling instead.
“He was trying to recruit you,” John huffed, changing the subject somewhat. “I don't like it when they think you're the same as them.”
The house was a mystery and Sherlock loved it. He would be back as soon as possible, with tools and proper gear, he'd crack this place open and extract the heart of the matter (and then gloat over it, that went almost without saying). For now he needed to get John out of there and make sure there were no lasting ill effects.
“According to Scotland Yard, yes, it did, since I'm their big suspect. Concepts such as thinking and logic and reasoning and deduction and even induction are completely out of their comfort zone.”
“Not the bookbinding glue?” Sherlock questioned, opening his eyes, leaning in to inspect the books closer. “They look the same, don't they? I think one of them- or perhaps both are new copies of something old.”
Oceans swelled and ebbed inside Sherlock's brain. Was it regret he felt? Impotence? Fear? Then he felt a different thing, a hand on his arm.
“What? No.” John sounded only mildly offended. He had a history of dispatchment, after all. Although mostly just when Sherlock was in danger of losing life or limb.
“Will be at the scene,” Sherlock snapped and got up, a little less graceful than usual because of the foot and the cane.
Sherlock swept out of the sitting room and into the bathroom where he gave himself a shower, leaning out of the spray of water now and then to sip at his tea which he'd brought along. It was hot now, so he would drink it now.
What a ridiculous question. Obviously the answer was no, or Sherlock would BE somewhere else. “My turn to ask questions,” he declared. After all, he'd let John ask him. It wasn't his fault John had completely failed to ask anything
It was a better kiss; John tilted his head back and dug his fingers into Sherlock's thigh. There were small noises, breath, John's stubble, sensations beyond the five senses (once again proving Sherlock's stance on the existence of more than those five over-exposed ones), and most importantly, there was the kiss.
The bath was nice, soothing, and it felt good to get clean. Sherlock sat in as long as he could without setting off John's alarms. It was nearly ten in the morning when he limped into the sitting room for a liquid breakfast and a consultation with a put-out Lestrade who sat there on the sofa with a sheaf of papers in hand.
“Yes, she was working for me. For my little society of explorers,” she nodded. Again, no denial. “And then I found out about you. I was fascinated. You're quite a brilliant man.”
But with thoughts of what had happened came also the sensations and momentarily, while he was blinking his eyes open, blurry with light and steam, he felt as though he was somewhere else. He was sitting down, looking at a cup of dark tea with his fragile and withered right hand by it on the table, wearing a signet ring.
“Yes,” Sherlock said after snatching up his mobile. The voice on the other end was slightly gravelly but also affable.
But Sherlock was also enchanted by their differences. John communicated easily but often without meaning. He embodied learned senses which Sherlock struggled to comprehend, such as sense of justice, sense of disgust, moral sense, common sense—while Sherlock lived in a world of physical senses, balance, proprioception, sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch. Like John touching his knee, warm even through the cloth of Sherlock's trousers. He looked at John's face which was turned away, towards the outside.
“Money, usually. More rarely their intellect. But money is fine too. It gets a lot done.” She moved her wheelchair slightly which made shadows careen off of her and into the walls. “Fiona Price had family connections and ambition, Arthur Gibson had his career and experience, Viktor Ljuga had deft hands and a need to please.”
Slowly, slowly, Sherlock got his eyes under control and managed to part them enough to regain his sight. First there was a halo of soft light, then shapes and blurs, and then John, peering at him, breaking into a smile when Sherlock focused his gaze on him.
Sherlock grinned back, and then kept on his course toward the hospital. Perhaps if he'd heard of the murder from anyone else but Mycroft he'd been interested. Perhaps he could send a discreet text to Lestrade and ask about it. Yes. As he was typing a text with his usual economy of words
“Not much, I'm afraid,” she finally replied. “And I spy on my neighbours all the time.” She didn't quite cackle at the end, rather coughed with a smile. Sherlock judged her use of time as useful. Observing one's surroundings was always useful. He had observed Mrs Haversham's home had very few pictures of family, almost singly old black and white ones (or sepia, which came from cuttlefish) of her parents and her wedding photo. The few pictures in colour were of a young man, her grandson, the only one she got along with. Her wealth was obvious in the furniture and in the Bohemian crystal in her cabinets, but it was all old.
John looked up, holding a little basin for Molly to empty what hadn't been digested yet into it. “No, but a rat. Wonder how he caught it.”
It wasn't good enough. Sherlock murmured in pain and leaned over, favouring his leg. It was for show, but all shows had a bit of truth.
“Clear,” John whispered and Sherlock eased out of the lift, all senses tuned to catch the faintest flick of movement or anything out of place. “Where to?” John asked.
Sherlock just lay there, propped up against John. On top of the things that had been injured before, now his tongue was a lacerated mess and his arm was cramped up and twitching, the taser barbs having embedded themselves into his skin through the coat and the jacket and the shirt, and he had probably hit his head as he fell. He could have gotten up, he could have told John off and ranted, but he chose not to. He very pointedly chose to stay down and tried not to choke when John (roughly) inspected his tongue with his no-nonsense scowl on.
He was not completely unaware, but he was able to keep his mind occupied while his body operated on automatic, and he knew when he was in the hospital because he could smell it (turning off the olfactory sense was difficult). He welcomed the narcotics that followed: they took away the niggling pain and banished the burden of consciousness with blessed finality.
“You're such an insensitive prick,” John growled instead of accepting Sherlock's impeccable logic which surprised Sherlock. “You always think you know better.”
“Look it up on Wikipedia,” Sherlock snorted. “It's the same type of... code that's used in the Voynich manuscript.”
“Shut up,” Sherlock snapped in return. “You don't know anything, observe anything or understand anything!”
Their return and resettlement at 221B after a disappointing look-around in Gibson's study was only interrupted by Lestrade ringing John and demanding (because he was talking to John and not Sherlock) to know what was going on and who was he going to pin for the murder. Sherlock refused to say anything because it would be admitting he didn't know anything but left John to convey that in a humane way.
Most importantly, why had the man tried to eat the hand? Why was the hand glued shut with a key in the palm? Why had it been cut off in the first place? Whose hand was it? Why did this polyphagic man have it? Where had he gotten it?
hungry.” John shook his head. “You eat because you have to, but you're not hungry.” The way he said it made him sound disappointed, as though Sherlock had failed some secret test that defined his humanity. Or, as was more likely, his lack of humanity.
“Oh, really? You've seen this stuff before?” John said, and Sherlock listened to them though he made no outward sign of it.
“Not a good thing to say right now.” John slumped back on the bed, one had rubbing at his forehead as he gave Sherlock a troubled look from under his brows.
He was well cross by the time John got back in the afternoon (1:35 post meridian). He had lain on the sofa, sat in the armchair, fiddled with his violin, taken the twenty quid John had left in the teeth of the skull, lain on the sofa again, eaten some jam, looked at some mould that grows on human skin if the body is submerged long enough, then at some fungus that grows on human skin if it's left somewhere dry.
Sherlock hoped his expression communicated his opinion on the matter as clearly as John's did. He took the girl's mobile again and downloaded the pertinent information off it and onto his laptop. “Fine, I'll look into it. Now go away.” A lie, of course.
John was, in fact, terribly adept at adapting to situations. It was really a question of willpower, being able to flourish wherever he existed. Sherlock had grudging respect for this ability of John's though he would've preferred not to have to talk about Tesco ever, ever, ever again. Doing the shopping was something that happened to other people.
“Really makes no difference, Sherlock,” John said and closed his laptop. “You need sleep. I'll even come sleep with you.”
He brought the hand under a lamp. It'd been cut at the wrist, below the joint where the radius and ulna connected to the smaller bones of the palm. It was a very neat cut, but obviously surrounded by the trauma of having been cut while the victim was still alive. The fingers were curled into a fist, artificially so, since there was no muscle tension. A key ring had been slipped around the middle finger, so there was most likely a key held in the fist. It was a left hand. Short nails, something black under the thumb nail, ink stains on the visible on the skin, no signs of struggle.
“John,” he said again, withdrawing back into his own space. John squeezed his knee in response but said nothing. And again it engaged Sherlock's interest. Their differences were vast, both physical and psychological, and sometimes too vast to bridge in any meaningful way. But it had turned out it was enough they shared one thing: a sense of adventure.
century.” She paused a little and looked at Sherlock carefully as if gauging his attention or interest. “And then I used Arthur to contact you. I want you to join us. I want you to be my body.”
Sherlock moved to inspect the crate. The outside was stained with mud and the inside was stained with a few droplets of blood, but it was otherwise in fairly good condition. The wood was darker on the outside, meaning it'd been exposed to sunlight for a relatively long time prior to being used as a body dump. Other than that there was nothing remarkable about it. There was a collection of dust at the bottom with a few larger pieces of dry and brittle paper. So it had been used as a storage container as it was meant.
The ceiling was high enough to not be visible in the not very well focused light of the flash function being used as a torch. Sherlock hadn't spotted an actual wall yet, just the ones made from all this refuse, but thanks to the position of the back door he figured they were in a room, probably near a kitchen, but so far there hadn't been any furniture or fixtures. It was possible no one had lived here for a long time, or had only lived in a small part of the house. It was interesting that these passages had been maintained, however. Or not maintained (that suggested an active interest in keeping the aisles clear) but not filled either.
The doctor spoke no more after that, not until he was in cuffs and Lestrade was taking him out. Then he looked at Sherlock and said: “
Sherlock sat up with slow insolence born of years in public schools and family dinners and stuck out his tongue, which was still somewhat misshapen from being bit and stitched back together three weeks earlier. John rubbed his hands with anti-bacterial handwash before taking Sherlock's tongue between his fingertips and pressing gently under it and along the little ridge that had formed where the stitches had been.
“If she can text I doubt she's badly hurt or traumatised, John,” Sherlock huffed. “For God's sake, stop playing in the bushes and just come on.”
“I'm going to lose my licence for you.” John walked in with those words, shaking his head, but he had no blame. He cared, he needed to care, he needed to be needed. He had an IV bag, which he hung around a bedpost before sitting on the bed.
John snorted and did that, then soon put his phone away. “He wasn't amused,” he reported, grinning a bit.
happy he's dead,” John said. “What he's done is vile. Science isn't some all-purpose pass to killing people.”
“If by dirt you mean decomposed and decomposing... garbage.” He couldn't be sure without closer examination of its composition. He had a piece of John's notepad in his pocket, the page with all the phone numbers. He bent down to quickly scoop up a sample of the compost (gloves on) and folded it into the paper, slipping it back into his pocket. “Do you see any dates on the papers in the piles?”
“Oh?” Doctor Gibson turned to look at John for the first time since greeting him. “Teleportation and time travel, naturally.”
“Stop breathing in my ear,” John whispered and Sherlock realised he'd leaned in very close. Close enough to see the faint stubble on John's cheek. It was so light in colour it was almost translucent. Sometimes Sherlock got to feel it.
“It's a better reason than land or oil rights,” Sherlock muttered and headed into the study where Gibson had kept his documents. To be honest he wasn't certain what he was looking for, but he'd know when he saw it. Whether it was multiple personality disorder or… something else, there'd be signs of those separate personalities. Little things.
“I don't need that clarification from you,” Sherlock said. He really didn't. John enjoyed him. He rubbed his hands together and looked aside, thinking. She'd be back and he had to be prepared. Whatever her technique was to take over malleable minds Sherlock wouldn't be caught unaware again. It was a pity John had handed over the manuscript but it was no great loss. From what he'd learned from Alice it wasn't particularly important when it came to the writings of the Explorers, not to mention complete scans of the Voynich manuscript could be found as a PDF on the internet. A far greater loss were the papers handed to him by Arthur Gibson (or had they been given to him by Alice?).
He spotted the corpse Molly had called him in for immediately. It was hard to miss a dead man with skin covered in tattoos and a severed (extra) hand poking out from the opened ribcage area of it. Molly had stopped in the middle of her autopsy to text him. John also approached the autopsy table, frowning.
With that John slipped his hand around Sherlock and onto the small of his back and guided him back towards the bathroom where the water still ran. Afterwards Sherlock was quite certain John didn't undress him or help him bathe but somehow those things still happened. John also procured a meal for him but Sherlock had no idea what it was even while eating it he couldn't have told what the ingredients were. And John was patient. Worried—but patient.
The client nodded. She hadn't thought it was her husband's spirit but rather something malicious tormenting her. Sherlock had assessed her as a person easily brought to nervous fits by anything or anyone.
“I checked up on that case. I've got all the particulars.” John waved his notepad in the air (why did he need a notepad, left-handed people SUPPOSEDLY had better memories), peering at Sherlock's one visible eye. “It- It's- Well.” He sighed and Sherlock feared the worst. “It was about a pug. A small dog.”
People were slow and unprepared for everything. Watching them fumble with simple tasks they performed every day was so disappointing and discouraging. It was almost incomprehensible that the same beings struggling (and often failing) in everyday life were also capable of creating art and science that uplifted the mind. This controversy between cynicism and idealism occupied Sherlock's brain until the cabbie told him they'd arrived.
Sherlock glanced at the scrap of paper, then got up with one of the books. “John, look,” he said and snatched John's paper away, plopping the book in its place. “Or rather smell it. That's modern glue. Quite fresh, too. This one's an almost perfect forgery of that other book.”
“No, most people don't. Do you have any idea who killed him? Or how?” John evaded the conversation and moved back to the case at hand. Sherlock didn't mind. It was mostly a philosophical argument that started over and over again at murder scenes and when the murderer was caught.
“Fine, you get no vote in naming this thing. Hmm. ‘The Deathly Wall-Paper.’ Oh!” John typed something happily. “Got it.”
“I don't understand,” Sherlock admitted, an admission only to be made in John's presence. But he was fairly sure John had been about to say it was the reason why he loved him. Sherlock realised he would've liked to hear the words after all. Even if romantic love was merely a product of hormones and biology and ultimately too ephemeral to be a basis for anything.
John made a drawn-out sigh, but crouched down with a roll of bandage in his hands and inspected Sherlock's foot. “Stonehenge is on Salisbury Plain, Sherlock. It's probably the most important British landmark there is. So it's not FLAT.”
“E. coli, salmonella, toxoplasmosis,” he said once closer to the collapse, lowering himself on his stomach to spread his weight so as not to cause another cascade.
“You're welcome,” John replied, opening his eyes a fraction and smiling up at Sherlock. Then he planted his hand on Sherlock's chest and gave him a little push. “Now fuck off.”
John's arms encircled Sherlock's middle now, hands resting on the small of his back. “Of course not. I was worried about you. You-” He paused, worry darkening his eyes. “This time was different. That woman scared you.” John was frowning and his grasp on Sherlock was a little tighter. Protective, Sherlock realised, but in a manner that didn't annoy him—unlike Mycroft's overbearing over-protectiveness.
Sherlock snorted and coughed and spat on John's shirt again, attempting an objection, but the sound of ambulance sirens convinced him otherwise. Dealing with doctors was tiresome (John didn't count, he was John first) and he hated hospitals. He blinked ‘yes’ in Morse code (long short long long, short, short short short) to John whether he noticed it or not and then closed his eyes and sank away.
He knew he made it into the lift but he couldn't remember how and he had no idea of what happened then. In the inky black of his subconscious he ran down endless helices of stairs, the hem of his coat lapping at his legs and his breath pouring out of him as fog in the unnatural cold.
Sherlock agreed with a nod (to John's relief, obvious in the sudden drop of his shoulders as he relaxed). “More paracetamol, and help me up.”
John did sit up, his face was drooping with lack of sleep and annoyance. Sherlock didn't see why John would be annoyed, he was the one who was refusing to be interested in something that hadn't been proven to exist in humans (polyphagia in animals had been connected to a damaged amygdala so in theory the same could work for humans).
There was more to this whole thing, starting with the polyphagic man and the key, but he wasn't about to waste his time trying to convince John of it if he didn't want to see it. Even if it was blatantly obvious. But clearly John was taking the route of following the case of the kidnapped and now dead young woman which had now come to an (apparently satisfactory) end.
“I don't know yet,” Sherlock replied, tracing his fingers over the crest. He'd have to look up symbology in heraldry.
“Ah, yes. Coming out. Your favourite new pastime,” Mycroft needled back, at which Sherlock snorted. Unimaginative.
Sherlock nodded and headed into the building. Yes, John was right. It was personal and could wait. Murder at (New) Scotland Yard couldn't.
John's voice in his head, for lack of actual John, told him that made her death even sadder. (And that was the thing; why were some deaths more acceptable than others? Why was ‘it was his time to go’ acceptable when referring to a non-violent death but not when referring to a violent death? Weren't both the result of the increasing entropy of the world?)
“There's th-” John began, but was interrupted by Sherlock sitting on him. It was not very comfortable wedged between the desk and John (the edge of the desk bit into his side), but Sherlock ignored it, taking delight in John's utterly shocked expression.
“We need fire and you don't let me carry a lighter any more,” Sherlock countered, grabbing a metal container, piling the papers and other flammables in it.
“Great, why don't I go first?” John had splayed his hand on the small of Sherlock's back, trying to peer in past him.
Mrs Haversham had sunk into her armchair. “Why, yes, now that I think of it, I do remember something. An address I heard her give to a cab driver once not long ago. Would that be the sort of thing you're wanting?”
“It's possible. If the muscles surrounding it contracted enough…” John said but sounded even more apprehensive. He hadn't mentioned that happening on Gibson but Sherlock had made the deductive leap from the strangling. It was common enough.
Sherlock snorted. He felt his scorn could've powered half of Greater London. “For God's sake, Mycroft. Have we taken a step back to when I was seven?”
“Please,” Sherlock said and gestured towards the door. He then turned to look at John who was red in the face with suppressed emotions. John looked back at him and grasped his arm to which Sherlock replied with another little shake of his head. It made John's eyes widen and his jaw move as he ground his teeth together, but he held it in as they both followed the doctor out into the gravel courtyard and then into the opposite barrack-like building.
Sherlock didn't give him the time to protest and just swept him out the door and into the street, striding forth when no cabs were immediately available. John hurried after him, silent until the chilly night air (ostensibly) cleared his head.
There was a subtle air of change at 221B. Sherlock paused at the door and took a deep breath. Unsettled dust still hung in the intra-flat air currents. Laundry had been disturbed and the dishes had been done. Were those to hide the obvious disturbance of Sherlock's private stashes? Cleaning as an alibi? Or had Mrs Hudson been in? No, he couldn't smell her perfume. He walked in, stopping in the doorway to the sitting room. John was on his chair, not turning to look. Still angry.
the questions. Had everything he thought he knew been called into question or had he met someone so brilliant at manipulation that he'd been made to think that? Both options were unsettling. Unfathomable.
“Not talking about those.” John elbowed him. “You should probably take it home. And bring me clean clothes tomorrow.”
at him when he pulled the phone from his jacket pocket. “What?” he said in lieu of an actual greeting.
“That doesn't seem so unusual.” John circled back around the fountain to stand next to Sherlock. “It seems like a landscaping decision. A round fountain surrounded by a square of trees.”
“Right, whatever,” John replied. “After we've looked into the storage locker, we're going to help that poor girl find her friend, yeah?”
“Oh, shut up, Sherlock,” John replied from his seat at the desk, patiently typing something, so very annoyingly slow and hesitant tap-tap-tap on the keyboard, so very indifferent to Sherlock's suffering. “And go to bed.”
“No!” Sherlock turned and shoved the phone at John, who took it with raised eyebrows and lifted it to his ear.
What? Sherlock sat up. His laptop? Hidden by John? He looked around, eyes searching out signs of disturbance and John's clumsy attempts at hiding something. John noticed this.
“You're not a machine, you're human, I've seen you. It's okay to care even if your twat of a brother tells you otherwise. You're quite good at hiding it, really, but I've become quite good at spotting it. Sometimes you annoy the hell out of me, like the bag of dicks you are, but you're not a freak and you're not a machine.”
Upstairs, in the client's bedroom, she stopped to stare at a hairbrush on the nightstand on the left side of the bed. She pointed at it with a shaky hand.
John sighed and most of the anger he'd held in his body left with the exhalation. “You are human,” John repeated softly, seemingly more to himself than Sherlock. “It's why I-” John paused, then started again, clearly having only worked out what he wanted to say. “It's why I think you're extraordinary, it's why you
“Oh, just, I don't know, so someone would know where we died,” John muttered, still reaching after Sherlock to touch him, holding onto the decorative belt at the back of his coat.
“Thanks, and those are some of my faults, not my moral views. You should know the difference.” John carted him some biscuits while the bread was in the toaster.
“Ahh…” There was a brief hesitation and a few dry coughs from which Sherlock deduced the caller was on the elderly side. “I saw on the news this morning you were involved with the box full of human remains found in Harrow.”
“What?” John said when Sherlock shoved him the cutters and stalked off to find a spot to cut a hole into the fence. “No, Sherlock, no. We're not going to- Hey!” John ran after him. “Sherlock,” he began with his serious voice.
Doctor Gibson looked at Sherlock over John's shoulder as if to ask why he'd brought someone like John to a meeting of minds. “Yes. Yes… thank you,” the doctor said as John let him go slowly, slipping away and smoothing his cardigan. “I'm sure I don't have to explain the principles of time travel to you.” He was speaking to Sherlock again. He wasn't particularly shaken by John's burst of violence.
“Scotland Yard!” he declared at once the connection was established. It was just another type of lie to get in. People were so easy to manipulate into letting someone in.
John glanced at him and took the edged weapon. “Where'd you get- you know, never mind.” He used the blade to dig around the hinges to try and lever them out of the porous stone. “To answer your question... you make me nervous.”
After a few more messages that mostly consisted of things like “get up, John“ or “for God's sake, John“ and “I'm deleting all your lady videos, John,” John finally came down the stairs, wearing a reproachful expression and the imprint of his pillow on his cheek.
“All right, fine, what do you want? A game? A swift kick in the groin?” John sighed and looked up (finally, attention).
However, Sherlock had far more interesting things on his plate, or in his (someone else's) storage locker. He bounced out of the cab and into the semi-fresh air of London, bright-eyed and bushy-haired. He could almost taste the excitement (it tasted like victory) on his tongue, and feel the carbonation of it in his limbs and the pit of his stomach. He loved this feeling, this expectation, this newness. At its best his relationship with John gave him the same feeling.
“Stop shouting, it's past nine.” John was there, knocking about on his laptop. “And I'm right here.” He hadn't looked up yet, rather worn and faded about the face (still hungover).
The tone of John's voice was surprisingly demanding and it made Sherlock focus on him even more, reading every imperfection of his skin (sun damage), watching every micro-expression (disquiet), picking up on the length of his stubble (two days). He carried a multitude of scents (lavender-tobacco-orange jelly) and the weight of his arms was pressing Sherlock's shoulders down and his body was blocking Sherlock from exiting the chair. His breathing was calm and deep and his clothes rustled faintly as he breathed. Sherlock only realised John had been slowly leaning forward when their foreheads touched briefly, then John tilted his head to the left and kissed him.
Judging from the inane prattle about round leather things and men wearing shorts and knee socks, very obvious. Sherlock raised his arm, pointing at the door, cleared his throat and started snapping his fingers until all attention was on him.
He snapped his fingers towards the lab computer and Molly got up slowly and went to it, logging in with her credentials, at which point Sherlock pushed her aside and looked up the info himself. All the information about the polyphagic man's stay at Barts had obviously been removed and all physical artefacts he might have brought with him (clothes, ID and such) were undoubtedly now in Mycroft's possession.
“Edward,” she said and looked away for a bit. Had she been fond of him? “He was my… pet project.” She looked back up at Sherlock and shrugged slightly. “For a time. I had to let him go and he tried to eat a hand. That was unfortunate but it also brought you into the picture again.”
This time it was Sherlock who put his hand on John's cheek with his fingers curling along the side of his head and kissed him. For someone as tightly wound as Sherlock even a few simple kisses could be intensely de-stressing. Particularly when he was tired and there was no active case and he was able to let go of that part of his brain. But he could also see how distracting it could be when there was a case.
The cigarette smoke had flowed down Sherlock's lungs and lingered around his face as he lay on his back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling with one half-lidded eye and another almost swollen shut. For that brief moment nothing really hurt and the world had retreated to a distance, leaving him in a hazy, nicotine-filled dream. He suddenly desired an iced sweet bun.
“Uh-huh,” John replied with a hint of skepticism and started unbuttoning Sherlock's shirt. An intimate deed that was still unthinkable to both of them a year ago. To Sherlock because intimacy had seemed not worth the effort and to John because intimacy with other men had been about clapping them on the shoulder after a few beers instead of undressing them (which Sherlock had begun to think was because John was actually also attracted to men but didn't know how to handle it).
Sherlock unfolded from his chair and stepped over to John's, leaning down to kiss him quickly on the lips. “Now,” he said with a grin and headed to get his coat. He heard John sigh behind him, and a brief glance behind revealed a John with a slight flush on his face, looking after Sherlock with that mix of confusion and yearning he did so well.
Sherlock had kept up with updates on the autopsy until he'd fallen asleep. Molly was rather good at what she did (but no one tell her) and she had been able to text Sherlock or send him pictures of what she'd found or not found during the night. The man hadn't eaten a toddler any time in the last 24 hours. Pity.
“If you must,” Sherlock sighed. There was no way to avoid it, other than smothering John with a pillow or insulting him until he left in a huff.
There was a battered pile of thick envelopes in it, along with a few boxes of ammo for his pistol. Sherlock was disappointed. John was boring him even without being there. He scraped the envelopes to his side of the suitcase and opened one, finding it full of photographs, taken somewhere very brown, with men in uniforms standing or sitting about, sometimes grinning at the camera, sometimes ignoring it, sometimes in full combat gear, staring off in the distance. The photos were dated by the camera and behind them read the amount of days John had had left in his rotation, it seemed. There was one for each day. Sherlock patiently went through all the envelopes (one of them had old family pictures).
crowd. And yet he should have known, he should have guessed, he should have deduced it. It was an unacceptable lapse in judgement and logic and it was also
Sherlock sunk back into his chair, legs spread around John who was on the floor in front of him. “No,” he muttered and smacked his lips to get rid of the lingering taste of antiseptic, and tried another confusion tactic by pushing his foot between John's legs and up against the inside of his thigh.
But his annoyance was interrupted by an image jumping to the foreground of his mind. He turned on his heel and looked at the crate. Yes. There was a smudge on the side. A familiar smudge. “Cambridge University,” he said to no one in particular, but noticed Lestrade making notes from the corner of his eye.
John shook the gate again, making plaster crumple off the pillars where the hinges were attached. “I wasn't uncomfortable,” he replied after a bit. “I was nervous.”
But then Sherlock stopped listening. His mind palace booted up and he stared off into his own brain, looking for the Voynich manuscript. He sort of knew where to look (by the unsolved cases hall of fame, in the interesting objects cabinet) and shortly located the Voynich manuscript. It was an illustrated codex from the early 15th century, from northern Italy, written entirely in a language no one could decipher, filled with diagrams in several subjects
Everything, everything, everything was clear now. These rooms and the original house were connected through the wall-paper. He dug out his phone, only peripherally aware of John coming down behind him.
He pulled Sherlock up and acted as a crutch (he was the right size) to get Sherlock to the bathroom and sat him on the toilet seat, starting the water in the bath. He knelt to help the soft cast off Sherlock's foot.
The little courtyard wasn't exactly bustling with people but there were police vehicles, a few men standing guard and more people inside the semi-permanent study and laboratory constructions. A little bit of late afternoon sun cleaved through the grey clouds to leave dapples of light on the damp gravel and a slow wind brought the scent of the river to Sherlock's nostrils. He looked at John, feeling the warmth of his grasp even through his thick coat, and took the briefest of moments to appreciate the expression of indulgence on John's face.
“Sherlock!” John said, reaching over to keep him on his feet. “What's going on? What'd you do to her?”
“Cut.” Sherlock pointed at a section of the fence that was shadowed by the building itself and another next to it.
The wall was slimy, but it was something for them to follow. Sherlock checked the timer on his mobile. John had been in the water for twenty-one minutes and forty seconds. Forty-one. John's hands were shaking and Sherlock knew it was from the cold because the situation was (should have been) exciting enough. No, not exciting. Tense. Yes.
“No one knows where the-” was all John had time to say as Sherlock swept past him, even bumping into him.
“The black substance under the nails of the severed hand was iron gall ink, slightly acidic,” John said suddenly. Or at least it felt sudden to Sherlock as they sat in a cab. So Molly had actually worked on that.
The lock was old and rusted, but also simpler because of its age. It was easy to open (in theory, in practice the rust made it quite resistant). The door, however, stuck to its frame because of the damp. Sherlock may have been a little too forceful as he kicked it open. Dust and mould spores attacked him as the door flew halfway open and then got stuck. He coughed and gestured for John to follow. Neither of them was allergic to mould, which was good, but breathing in the spores was never healthy. Then again, with all the other particulates they'd already inhaled and ingested in this house, they would be lucky if all they got was a minor infection of some sort.
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock admitted, then glanced at John. “And it's true that out of intellectual curiosity I might consider speaking on your behalf.” John stiffened upon hearing that, but Sherlock smiled at him a bit before looking at Gibson again. “But he won't. Go ahead and call Lestrade, John.”
“Dirty underclothes. Vest and pants. I think it's all he was wearing when he left the hospital. When he was still alive. To eat that rat,” Molly replied, wrinkling her nose a little. She spent all day with corpses and corpse-related objects and considered a dead rat disgusting.
“I'd be delighted.” Gibson clasped his hands together and nodded. “Follow me, please. I'll take you right to the heart of the operation. Truth to be told, I've been waiting to show it off to someone who'll understand the importance of my attempts.”
It took a few milliseconds longer than usual for Sherlock to understand the words after hearing them; he felt extremely slow and heavy.
John sat down as well and chatted with Lestrade (mindless drivel) while Sherlock looked through the list. He had once stolen a cab and driven around, taking customers. He'd done it to test his (encyclopaedic) knowledge of London, and the customers had been appreciative of that knowledge when he'd shaved off precious minutes from their trips. It'd been worth it in tips alone, but the law had caught up to him. Eventually.
“All I can tell you is that you're on the short list. That's all I know. I was never one for administrative tasks.” Gibson looked up at him with no geniality this time but filled with resolve. “I heard you visited the house that doesn't exist and obtained a manuscript. We'll come to you.”
Sherlock gave up on waiting and strode up as best he could on the rather uneven stairs, ducking out of the way of spider webs and low-hanging rafters. They seemed to be somewhere in the superstructure of the building. The previous room and whatever was beyond this door had been there for a long time, but the hatch entrance itself hidden behind the stove was new. The renovators would've known otherwise; Mr Gosbeck would have known and then Sherlock would have known.
John grimaced a little. “See, you almost had it and then you said something not good again,” he told him, but he was a little more relaxed. Perhaps the simple illocutionary act of promising he was committed to John had been enough. Communication was marvellous sometimes.
“And no, I'm not going to make a bacon milkshake.” John hovered by the sofa, looking like there was something more, but there wasn't. Sherlock ignored him until he went back to his chair and telly and whatever he did when he was by himself.
Sherlock eyed her. “Thank you,” he said. Something about her admiration made him uncomfortable and that was strange. The rain was rolling very slowly down the panes of the large window behind her and the room was even darker. The fire was even smaller. She looked at him with… desire. But it wasn't the same kind of look John gave him which meant it wasn't the same kind of desire.
Sherlock had a mind to get up on the crutches that were thoughtfully left leaning against the wall next to his bed and go over and bash John's head in with one of them. But he didn't, showing considerable self-control. He finished the water, wiggled all of his body parts to take in and calculate the amount of damage and pain, and decided on his next course of action.
There was no klaxon and Sherlock grinned at John, delighted. He reached over and squeezed John's arm, trying to convey how much he appreciated John right then. John smiled at him a little sheepishly and shrugged.
“Oh, Sherlock,” she said when she saw him. It was the first time she'd seen his injuries. “You ought to be more careful when you go out.”
“Did you look at the photos of the body?” Sherlock asked instead, once again choosing not to acknowledge a question that had an obvious answer (John really should have learned by now).
Despite Molly's desperate and obvious longing to her childhood she had an eye for the sort of peculiarities that interested Sherlock. Sherlock suspected she'd originally cultivated this talent for spotting said peculiarities because of her crush on him, and while she no longer (openly) longed for him, that talent had remained. She opened the door for them once they arrived and then looked away when Sherlock's gaze landed on the make-up she wore. It clearly wasn't for the occasion of meeting Sherlock (and John by extension) at the mortuary at 1am. She only wore that colour lipstick when she expected to be intimate. So her plans for the evening had fallen through.
Only silence followed, or rather, the absence of a reply from John, not true silence, since that could never happen. What people conceived as “silence“ was in fact just lack of human-created noise pollution. Sherlock took the laptop and ran upstairs, ignoring John's closed door and lack of on-switched lights in his room.
He was cut off by John grabbing a pillow and forcing it over his face. Sherlock didn't struggle because John wasn't pressing the pillow down very hard and he could easily breathe. It was an interesting situation to be in. Was John insinuating Sherlock could sleep there, with him? And if given the choice, would he sleep there? He wasn't sure. John's bed wasn't very spacious and he liked space. John had relaxed, obviously having fallen back asleep, leaving Sherlock to consider the situation alone (as usual).
Sherlock didn't argue. It was pointless to try and explain anything that had happened because he couldn't even explain it to himself yet. And his history with recreational narcotics made the someone-gave-them-to-me -story rather suspect. But it was interesting (and fearsome) to find out he had awoken previously. Had it been those times when he'd visited Alice Waite's consciousness?
“Well…” Lestrade shifted on his feet. “We don't know. Tried calming him down and talking to him about it, but he started to choke.”
John's mouth wasn't holding much tension so his lips remained soft. It was a kiss that demanded nothing—and everything. It demanded no action but it demanded attention. And in Sherlock's world attention was everything, whether directed at him (preferable) or directed at someone/something else. Right now his attention was on John, but conversely John's attention was on him. An attention loop from which he benefited. John knew what he was doing.
“Of course it is,” John muttered as Sherlock turned to take off his gloves and grab the coffee, ignoring John's comment. The coffee was disgusting, but he drank it anyway, staring at the hand and the key on the table.
He had been in a completely soundproof room once, the anechoic chamber at the University of Salford. The science had been interesting, and the more silent a place is, the more one can hear. Sherlock had looked forward to the visit for a week, but it had been... unsettling. He had lasted seventeen minutes and twenty-three seconds inside. First it had been curious to not hear anything (minus twelve decibels), but then he had noticed his breathing, his heart, the blood pumping in his veins, the slight creak of his joints. At about fourteen minutes he had been able to hear neurons firing in his brain. He never wanted to be back in a situation like that, he needed constant sensory input for his brain to process or he would go mad.
Sherlock steepled his fingers on his chest. “Tell me about the single most interesting event you witnessed or were part of in Afghanistan.”
“Great,” John said and got up with a grunt. He vocalised a lot when doing things. He belittled Sherlock's encounter with Alice Waite because he didn't understand it. That was fine, he rarely understood anything anyway.
“It's SOMETHING,” Sherlock argued. It had to be something because he'd put so much energy in it. And because it wasn't a coincidence that Mycroft had showed up to the same uncanny house at the same time as them. Not to mention the house was gone now. There was no sign of it on even old Google Earth satellite images.
John lowered his fork and licked his lips, removing specks of food. The look he gave Sherlock wasn't entirely pleased, but then he nodded. “Yeah, but it isn't your personal triumph.”
“Stop scaring the help,” John admonished him, quiet now, having braced Sherlock in the crook of his elbow, wiping some of the blood off his chin. “Look, you can go to your mind palace. I'll take care of things here.” He paused and then smiled. “Go and find out how many cars the Stig has taken around the Top Gear test track as of the end of the 18th season. I know you listen in when I watch it, in case you have to tell super cars apart some day. Oh, and tell me the top five and their times when you get back.”
“I can live with that.” Sherlock jumped up and headed for his coat. Finally they could get to the bottom of the actually interesting mystery in front of them. “Grab your indignation and let's go visit the selfstore.”
John made a few strangled sounds that Sherlock recognised as rising exasperation with a bit of righteous anger. “Because they're people, Sherlock, and deserve to keep their lives.” He took a breath, a disappointed pre-sigh, acting as though Sherlock's lack of interest in human life was more horrific than what cruelty men were capable of during a war. “And don't think I haven't noticed you left my hat behind.”
Sherlock ignored that. John's reluctant forgiveness was enough. He ate some more while going through the binder again, but then slammed it shut and got up. “I need to get back home,” he announced.
“Is that- It's like a TOMB.” John was circling the tank, horrified. “Do you think there's someone in it?”
Sherlock wet his lips in the tea again. “What's the offer?” And this was the reason why Sherlock hadn't told John when he'd left. He'd known something would come up that John wouldn't be able to see past and that would impair Sherlock's ability to make decisions for himself. This way he could pretend he needn't take anyone else into question.
“It's not locked. I don't think. It's just rusted shut,” John called back and prodded the door with his foot.
“She was it,” Sherlock said and put the plate down. “That old woman. She's Alice Waite.” Or was she? Perhaps Alice Waite had been someone who'd been taken over as well.
“Thank you for the running tally of my chances,” John grumbled, but he didn't let go of Sherlock's coat. He still trusted Sherlock would get them out and that was exactly what Sherlock was going to do. He had memorised the amount of steps they had taken, both along the wall and across the free space from the hole to the wall. They could always backtrack and he could help John climb out. They'd have to turn back in about seven minutes to be able to do that.
“White slavery,” Sherlock said loudly, startling the girl who'd been sobbing unquietly. “Please enlighten me about your friend's situation.”
“What?” John smiled innocently. He was very good at that. He could just turn on some sort of a generator in his face that made him radiate innocence and kindness and relatability.
That was another comment that required no reply from Sherlock, he had his tea, John could go hang. He was momentarily distracted by the hot drink and making sure it had the right ratio of tea to milk to sugar (2:1:0,25). John kept on talking and Sherlock was peripherally aware of it, zoning back in when he was satisfied.
him (why was he doing this).”I just wanted to you to consider that someone who was compulsively hungry might think differently.”
“Your subjective interpretation of murder statistics, which I doubt you've actually even checked, is irrelevant and only meant to shake me up. Which it hasn't,” Sherlock remarked. Now he was glad John was gone. He didn't mind being called a freak by someone he didn't care about, but he would've hated to see John
“I'm fine.” Sherlock pushed the door open with the cane and limped in to the middle of the room and pulled the cord that lit the bare bulb that hung from the ceiling. The room was nearly empty of furniture and felt hollow without the press of police personnel crowding in it. There was a sink and a toilet seat, a mattress on the floor and tracks of dirt from the boots that had trod the floor back and forth in the last 24 hours.
“Tea?” the lady asked then. Another social custom which Sherlock could tell was only out of politeness, not any real desire to offer them refreshments.
“What do you want?” he asked. “If it's just to tell me you agree with Donovan, you could've saved your breath.”
Then an unrelated issue occurred to him. Was it customary to take a gift of some sort when one visited a hospital? Why were there so many rules? Sherlock's favourite question as a child had been 'why', mostly when it came to rules of conduct and social behaviour. Most of it had been (and remained) incomprehensible to Sherlock. He could, if pressed, act like a human, but he still didn't always understand why it was done.
“John!” Sherlock shook him. “A blocked number!” He loved the possibilities blocked numbers offered. It could be anybody! In his case it was often death threats, either meant personally for him or to those few he considered friends.
“John,” Sherlock said. “I don't want to return to a merely platonic relationship. You are... important.” He hoped John understood. Statistically speaking he should understand, he had a good track record of understanding and translating Sherlock. Personal wasn't important, but Sherlock had broken this rule by making John (something very personal) important.
It sent Sherlock into his mind to scour through his cases, coming up with only one answer. “The yellow wall-paper,” he said and felt John push against his arm again. The connection between the killer with the yellow wall-paper and doctor Gibson wasn't obvious to him yet. But ‘us’ meant a group and by the sound of it an organised group (with people in interesting positions if they were able to dig out Sherlock's phone number, unless Mycroft was in on it which was also possible).
“No. Well. Yes, that too.” John nodded, not looking at him, working on the hinges with a frown on his face. “But you're my best friend. My best... everything.”
“The fact that I'll go mad if I have to lie here quietly and listen to you do chores,” Sherlock replied. Why was John so slow? So incredibly stubborn. It was dull. DULL. “Ask!” he barked.
“John. I'm trying to simplify this as much as I can for your sake, so stop interrupting me.” Talking about the case was helpful at staving off the boredom and physical discomfort brought on by that and the bruising. He heard John mutter an (insincere) apology, but there was no bite to it. There were routines of interaction that had grown between them, their exasperation with each other's idiosyncrasies was just one aspect of those routines. Sherlock resolved to analyse them more when he had nothing better to do.
“Is this really necessary?” Lestrade asked in an aimless manner, which Sherlock interpreted as meaning the question was rhetorical and meant for both him and Donovan. He resisted replying with ‘she started it.’
“John,” Sherlock said, climbing on the stairs until he was out of the water, which made John do the same. “Hold the light,” he pushed his phone into John's hands. There was a door at the top, locked, warped wood. Sherlock knelt in front of the lock, not even admonishing John for making the light shake. It was clear this door hadn't been opened in a long time (but then again, the whole place seemed to have been abandoned for a long time, emphasis on
She grabbed an arm angrily and arranged the body parts on the table in an imitation of the human body. They both leaned over the remains in the freezing silence and hum of the morgue. Sherlock was able to confirm the presence of hesitation marks and the amount of effort it had taken to take the body apart. The trauma indicated a small axe and someone with not much strength.
John, like the others near Sherlock, didn't appreciate the death threats as much and groaned as Sherlock pushed the mobile at him. Sherlock hated to answer his calls. “Sherlock Holmes,” John muttered into the phone, then listened for a while. “It's not Mycroft,” he said then and dropped the phone for Sherlock to fish out of the sheets.
It was bright enough for Sherlock to first close his eyes and then open them. A lamp was shining into his face. John's reading light. He closed his eyes again but there was no darkness, just the light becoming red through his eyelids.
“Brilliant,” John cut him off bluntly (rather uncharacteristic of him). “I'm going out.” He gave the back of Sherlock's neck a brush with his thumb and then took his hand away. Sherlock said nothing but he did notice the weight of John's hand disappearing and he was vaguely aware of John leaving the flat after that.
John was a very great believer in Truth. But Truth didn't exist (truth is seen as truth because that is how human discourse is framed through power relations, and that is how it is lived and internalised, something called the “obviousness of obviousness“, which Sherlock rather liked), and trying to convince John of this type of existential fact when it came to his clearly strained relationship with his own sexuality was painstaking.
John took a tentative step in, gun still pointed though there was no immediate danger or target. Sherlock made a noise, only barely stopping himself from telling John to get out of the way. It wouldn't have helped any, anyway. John gave him a look, that steady one, ‘I've got this,’ he was saying. He was being protective, the idiot.
“I was asleep,” Lestrade replied. He was far from amused, slumping next to John in the booth. “What the hell are you doing? I told you to stay home.”
Sherlock blinked in assent, watching John set up the IV, then push the milk-like propofol into the drip. He touched Sherlock's hair when his eyes started to close with the drug euphoria, smoothed away a few strands.
“Why don't you admit you're attracted to me?” Sherlock snapped back, making John grunt and twist so he could glare at Sherlock.
Sherlock refrained from making a reply of any sort in case he changed his mind about it later. This way he didn't need to justify anything. John hunkered down into his pillows and blankets with his back to Sherlock, which he counted as a victory because John hadn't kicked him off the bed and out of his room. He could get so territorial.
“Tea?” Alice Waite asked. She moved to a side table with a tea service on it. “It's just been brewed,” she continued with a little non-amused smile as she poured two cups and carefully moved them to the coffee table. “Do sit down.”
“Whatever bacterial or parasitic or protozoal infection we contract from being in this house can be treated with medicine. Hypothermia is treated with warmth. I am providing warmth. You don't even know what tert-butyllithium is.”
“What are you talking about?” John leaned even farther back, shock tensing his previously relaxed expression. “Why wouldn't you be yourself?”
“Stop it,” John's voice cut through his thoughts. He reached forward and grasped Sherlock's arm, squeezing it, just above the wrist. “I know what you're thinking and it's human to be different,” he even smiled (which surprised Sherlock, considering the circumstances).
That part Sherlock ignored. John paid more attention to women than he did. Sherlock paid equally little attention across all sexes and genders. He was fascinated by the box the corpse was in. People tended to be reluctant to approach or open random boxes in the landscape so he deduced the box had been left open and it was placed quite near a clear path. So it had been left there to be found. Or, as Sherlock surveyed the immediate area, noting the unevenness of the path and the clear marks of struggle in moving the box, it had been left there because whoever had brought it hadn't been able to move it farther along.
It was actually a bit impressive that John had been able to do that but he'd obviously learned from the best. “Yes, I deduced that,” Sherlock said with all the sarcasm he could muster. He didn't feel like being nice right now.
“Yes, thank you for the enlightening me with your knowledge of basic geometric shapes,” Sherlock said, moving towards the house again. He was quite sure that everything actually interesting (such as books and forging equipment) would be inside the house, not in the back garden.
“Wh-” John started, and because Sherlock didn't want to hear whatever it was John was about to say, he kissed John.
“What did you hear in the house?” he asked then. He'd been curious, but it hadn't been the time to ask about it earlier. He shifted so he could look at John without turning his head much. John's hands curled into fists when he asked that. Interesting.
“How could you help,” Sherlock snorted and limped into the sitting room and carelessly threw himself on the sofa. “I'm going to DIE of BOREDOM. It was the ONLY case.”
“Do we need to talk about incentive salience?” John let go of his tongue and sat back on his heels, looking up at him.
Sherlock scowled a bit, interrupting Lestrade again. “Irrelevant. I need a better look at the corpse. You have the victim's identity, I need cause of death. Get it to Barts.”
“Right. I'll concentrate when you start making sense. Deal?” John looked utterly relaxed, head tilted back, eyes half-lidded and crescent-moon-shaped in amusement that had more to do with sleepiness than actual humour. “Besides, I think you had a logical fallacy in your Latin reasons.”
“Yes... Yeah,” John said and soon appeared by Sherlock to get his coat on as well. A grown man with three continents' worth of experience in sexual relations still confused when he got kissed? Well, Sherlock did have that effect on people a lot of the time.
But John ignored his opinion and went to the sofa, patting the crying girl's shoulder awkwardly. “Er, miss..?”
The mirror groaned as Sherlock thunked his forehead against it again. He did that a few times although not hard enough to break neither the mirror or his head. Whether it was shared psychosis or whatever else Sherlock knew he didn't want to experience it again. Or see that woman.
Sherlock hadn't expected her to give a straightforward answer but this non-answer was just as good. She didn't deny anything and now it fell to Sherlock to figure out what had actually happened. He preferred it that way. “What do you want?”
So nothing in his pockets. Then Sherlock frowned. He'd overlooked something and that annoyed him greatly. “Who admitted him? Quickly.” The last was aimed at Molly who was still sitting down and just looking at him.
“The human ability to distinguish between right and wrong is the basis of morality.” John coalesced into existence in Sherlock's brain as he waited for the taxi. “Empathy and guilt are the basis of distinguishing between right and wrong.”
At least one thing was a constant: the complete disinterest of minimum wage employees. Sherlock had the key to a locker so they weren't really interested in who he was as they entered the selfstore. And perhaps it was a bit useful his face had been all over newspapers and the internet lately, people who didn't recognise him would still have seen a picture of him (most likely) and think he looked familiar, which could lead them to infer that he must've visited them before. In this case the clerk at the selfstore seemed to consider him a regular visitor and waved him through.
“It's on the hat shelf, under your gloves and that stupid cap you took from the theatre and insist on wearing. You came in, drunk, you had your keys in your hand, wallet in the other because you'd just paid the cabbie, but since the last thing you did was to open the door it was the keys you were thinking of and not the wallet. Oh. My. God. John. I'm going to die if you keep this up.”
Sherlock flapped his hand at John, trying to get his attention and make him wake up. “What a treat,” he intoned into his mobile.
“If I trust you with this, will I regret it?” John turned his head as well and looked Sherlock in the eye. He was almost expressionless, which was very strange, except for the hint of worry around the corners of his mouth and eyes.
John made a little sound, face troubled, but he stayed by the counter, disquieted. He had learned to spot some of the tells that were so flagrant to Sherlock and he could tell this person in front of them was not quite right.
They were met with an old man when they exited their cab. The man was bald and wore a knit cardigan (much in the same manner as John did which amused Sherlock). He smiled and shook their hands, slightly perplexed about John and John was just as perplexed, not having much idea why they were there. Behind the smile and crinkled grey eyes was something else: conviction. And no sign of guilt.
“Not exactly,” John's reply was wan. “If we'd taken that case about the locked room murder, or the one about human trafficking... we could be a in a bar having a drink right now.”
“I hope last Saturday and not the one before,” John muttered. “Memory loss, irritability, stress, psychosis… only a few of the effects of sleep deprivation.”
“Here's what we got,” he said, offering the papers when Sherlock sat in his chair and actively ignored the cast John had set out to put on again.
John sighed, but it wasn't the deep sigh of disappointment or annoyance. “Yeah, yeah,” he muttered as his hand found a spot on Sherlock's knee once again. “I know you care about some things, just not always the same things as I do. And you were right about me expecting things of you. Of course I do because you can do so much. But… sometimes you're too much like the people we try to catch. You don't think people are human. That's a bit dangerous.”
John's boots appeared in the same frame with the dead woman, and then his knees as he crouched down and took Sherlock's shoulder. “All right, then?” John said. His voice was quiet and calm.
“I got you,” John murmured. His fingertips were rubbing into Sherlock's scalp just behind his ears, easing tension that was creeping up from Sherlock's shoulders. “Look at me.”
“You've become narrow-minded,” Sherlock remarked calmly, removing his coat and scarf. He'd regained control of his aching body on the way over. His brain always won.
“You don't like my questions.” John wasn't upset, it was harder and harder to upset him as time went by, and when he did get upset it was about ridiculous things like feelings or morals or caring (which was not an advantage). Or their friendship. That was a subject not to be crossed, and Sherlock avoided it out of niceness, which was a social construct, one he'd personally constructed in his social behaviour just for John. He'd witnessed people using their constructs in public, but too much niceness just made them weak.
“Yeah, he doesn't want to do anything,” John agreed to the phone. “You know, I've been wondering why you keep ringing us up when you need someone to do your mobile work. Is this some weird way of trying to stay in Sherlock's life?”
“So it's their motto,” Sherlock murmured as he sat in the cab that was taking them back to Baker Street.
“The use of my body,” Sherlock clarified. “The way she used Arthur Gibson.” And others probably. Many others. She had said
It wasn't much of a case if an intellectually challenged man ate a child because there was no mystery. Outrage, yes (on the part of the regular person), but no mystery. The interest in this was obviously the medico-scientific angle of a person who could even eat a young child. It signified both psychological and physical issues, and Sherlock was in good cheer thinking about it. John on the other hand, when he came down, looked like death warmed over.
“Unenthusiastic?” Sherlock said as he waded on. He must've spoken out loud again while thinking. That or John now had the ability to read his thoughts. Ha. Not likely.
Sherlock considered throwing the rest of the tomato soup at John, but that would then become a row and John would be cross and Sherlock wouldn't be able to showcase his superior intellect because he had slightly bit his tongue. He indicated with his eyebrows what he thought of paying jobs (so boring, so OFFENSIVE), but John was oblivious.
“Agreed?” John was looking at him, serious, but with a little twitch of his lips that showed he knew exactly what Sherlock was thinking and was appreciative of his self-control. “Sherlock?”
“Fff,” he said, catching John's attention, and when he had it, he grimaced and pointed his thumb up, giving his assent to the easy (UGH) case.
“What do you think?” The doctor had taken them into the smaller room. “This is where I monitor the process.”
Sherlock swirled around on the front step of 221 Baker Street and glared down at Lestrade who stood by his car, weary and defeated in the street lights. “Of course I did!” Sherlock roared.
Molly was pulling out an almost whole rat from the guts of the man. It hadn't been there for long. Sherlock got up to come see, prodding the dead rodent once it had been placed in the basin.
Certainly that room was at the heart of it all, it was the original, and it seemed this generation was not the first to use it in (non)imaginative ways (what imagination did it require to shut a person in a room to die?), but it hadn't been used for some time. So the killer had moved on, created her own prisons elsewhere, perhaps she had finally realised it wouldn't do to draw all the attention to one spot, for which Sherlock couldn't respect her because it had taken her such a long time to understand it.
“The landlady was there, as was the police officer who had come over to Barts with the first body, along with Scotland Yard's ‘finest.’” Sherlock made the sarcastic quotation marks with his fingers. “The landlady, a Mrs Hayling, was almost nonsensical, she was so frightened. Most of it was self-provocation and in response to the fawning of the police. A bored, middle-aged, married woman, affluent enough to not work, with an achiever type husband who rather works than spends time with her. Very typical. She recognised me with some surprise, which was enough for the police officer from Barts, possibly because she'd been ingratiating herself to him and vice versa and his manhood felt threatened.” Sherlock made a frustrated noise at human stupidity and gullibility. “He rugby tackled me down the stairs and punched me, claiming loudly that I must be the one responsible, that he'd seen me at Barts, just waiting for the corpse, knowing it'd be there.”
“The dark bothered you,” Sherlock remarked as he looked around as he waited for the water to go still, though they'd soon disturb it again. He couldn't see any walls, but there were pillars and struts, meaning this must have been some sort of a basement or cellar, at least once upon a time.
“When we get back home, yeah?” John glanced at him with a little frown (of worry? restraint?), but then looked back out the window of the taxi.
Sherlock found himself unable to calm down. He passed by the windows of the sitting room over and over again, ambulating across furniture if it happened to be in the way. John remained unaffected and sat in his chair with his laptop, rewriting his notes. He was of the mind that the case was as good as solved with the death of Dr Arthur Gibson but Sherlock had a different opinion.
John looked back at him, doubt worming new lines across his face and tensing his shoulders. He shifted his grasp on his glass and had another sip. “And you took it?”
He saw himself smile. “Don't worry, Sherlock,” his voice said. “Don't worry. Sherlock,” she tried again with his voice. It sounded so different with her operating his body. “Such a nice voice,” she purred and Sherlock spasmed on the floor, reaching up to grasp the coffee table to pull himself up.
, not for you,” Molly said, lifting her chin and giving him a look which she must've thought was withering.
Sherlock had the lighter in his hand, clicking the top but not actually making flame. Arsonists and pyromaniacs had the same sort of distinction that he made with killers and murderers; the former signified a person who had chosen to do what he did for other reasons than personal pleasure, while the latter did it because they needed to do it out of psychological reasons. He found it disappointing that Miss Price was quite solidly in the second category. Perhaps once upon a time someone in her family had used the wall-paper room in a semi-scientific way, to conduct experiments on people.
The fastest way for him to get back to Central London was by taxi (or helicopter, that wasn't still completely ruled out). Depending on route (shortest via A1) the trip was between thirty and twenty-five kilometres. He had considered walking, but even for him that would take hours. Even the car trip would take in excess of one hour. Public transport even more.
Sherlock stopped, turned around and pointed at a bulletin board near the door in a very highfalutin manner. “It is written there. On a piece of paper that is attached to the cork board with two silver thumb tacks.”
“Only if you promise to turn over everything you have regarding the house, the dead man in it, the dead man's hand, and the man killed by said hand.”
“Damn!” Sherlock slammed his hand on the table and looked around again. Glycerine and potassium permanganate only created fire in temperatures above 21 Celsius. John needed warmth. Now. Sherlock took off his coat and dropped it over John's shoulders. Some of it was still dry. “Look for a Bunsen burner, or matches. Anything. This is like a chemistry lab. There's bound to be something.”
Doctor Gibson went behind his desk and sat down. “I had high hopes for you, Mr Holmes,” he murmured. “And you've disappointed each and every one of them.”
“And did you have to go through my things?” John had begun the descent into despair. He crouched and stacked up the journals. “Sometimes it'd be nice if you tried to be a bit less of a dick,” he muttered.
“Does your brain hurt when you try to think?” Sherlock muttered, closing his eye. John was being distracting, taking away his rightful wrath at being grounded like he was a child.
Since the tea had been just a pretence to be interested in something else than Mycroft, Sherlock abandoned it immediately after Mycroft had left and got out the binder. He sat at his desk and opened both the binder and the manuscript, laying them side to side (which pushed off some of John's papers). He could feel his face stretching as a grin pushed his mouth wide and engaged the muscles of his eyes (zygomatic major and orbicularis oculi) to create a true expression of happiness. He was going to find out the secrets of this no-longer-secret society.
John knew not to expect gratitude or niceness, Sherlock had seen to that (it was necessary), and was complacent enough to ignore Sherlock's meanness (also necessary) but for the extremes. Sherlock mulled on this for a brief moment, then felt merciful (which had nothing to do with the cold packs and the pain medicine).
Few took note of Sherlock and the driver as the latter escorted Sherlock across the yard and into the entrance hall of the manor-like facility. A receptionist sat in the middle of a circular desk situated near the entrance. She wasn't a nurse and she thought she was above said nurses, looking to attain a senior administrator position. Her ambition was clear to anyone with eyes. She only nodded to the driver as they walked past her and to the grand stairs heading up. Despite the hospital-like doors, the hall was more akin to a hotel lobby than a hospital.
The pages following the equations and notes were typed pages with familiar medieval illustrations tacked on. The Voynich manuscript, the very thing Sherlock had struggled to translate, was laid bare. (And he felt briefly bitter towards the doctor for taking away the most interesting case he'd had for a while as well as the mystery of the manuscript.) The binder didn't include the whole manuscript but only a part of it dealing with the particulars of teleportation and time travel. It must have been the source the doctor had followed in his experimentation and perhaps the manuscript provided many such sources for experiments in different disciplines. And these experiments clearly weren't sanctioned by any public group.
committing murders. However, sometimes he felt it would be easier to live up to their negative expectations of him.
The answer was obvious. So obvious it made Sherlock twitch. How could John not see it? How could John bring him cases like this? How could this person whom Sherlock so liked (yes, he did) could be so cruel to him? Did John just want to torture him?
“I don't think you understand just how far our culture has ritualised social behaviour and ostracises those who refuse to follow the rules,” Sherlock said. He knew. He had plenty of experience of being ostracised because he asked 'why' instead of doing something just because it had been done that way before. But, and this he felt required extra acknowledgement from people around him, he was willing to make some compromises if it involved John.
“Then wrap it back up,” Sherlock snapped. What he ought and oughtn't do wasn't any of John's business.
“This way,” he said. Walking in chest deep water freezing water with a wool greatcoat on wasn't all that comfortable, but he was not going to abandon his coat. Besides, John was holding onto the hem of it.
“Twenty-seven minutes and three seconds,” Sherlock said flatly. He understood John's outburst, he could be suffering from hypothermia soon and that would obviously lower his chances of survival to almost zero if they were not able to find a way out.
John gave him a look (‘what? me? why?’), but didn't argue. Sherlock knew John was aware of their audience as well, and of Sherlock's desire to grandstand in front of audiences, particularly at times when he had deduced something good. John pushed his ridiculous cap into Sherlock's hand (payback) and found a seam where he could fit his fingers and try to pull the stove out of the wall. His face registered surprise when the stove moved out as though it was on wheels and revealed a small hatch behind it. Just tall enough for a grown person to go through on hands and knees.
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock interrupted, and then he was interrupted by John's phone playing its insipid ring tone.
“I didn't really find out anything else,” she was saying. Sounded tired. “Most of the internal organs were quite normal, except for the alimentary tract, which you saw. I didn't find any... human bits in his stomach. Cause of death was asphyxiation, likely the, uh- the hand.”
“It- it's not.” John shook his head at him, but he wasn't cross. “The first two things, yes, the last two things, no.”
The place had gone through a change of employee shifts and was serving the breakfast rush when Lestrade finally made it there. Sherlock had closed his eyes, leaning against the window with his leg stretched out in front of him. The surroundings had melted into white noise, a skill Sherlock had honed to separate himself from the flow of unnecessary information that was ever-present. He was alerted back to himself when he heard John speak.
“D-don't sound so happy about it,” John grumbled, though he should have known it was in vain. Sherlock would forever be delighted by dead people. However, this time the presence of a corpse wasn't why he was... relieved.
Sherlock took a seat in one of the armchairs and studied Alice Waite a little longer. She had clearly lived a comfortable life but possessed a restless mind in a restless body, very much like Sherlock. It had left her with a thin and pointy figure.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, hands in his pockets, watching John. There was a damp wind that made the overgrown garden creak and brought the smell of dirt and decaying plant matter. He knew what John was saying. Forging (or forcing) a romantic relationship could break what they already had and losing what they already had was not an option.
There wasn't a wall where he calculated one should be if it was in line with the outer wall of the house above. A little puzzling, but not unheard of. It was best to stick to one direction, so he forged on, though every now and then he stopped to listen. There was no sound of air moving, the water obviously lapped at them, making small noise. Things shifted above them in the ceiling/floor, under the weight of the hoard it was holding up. It smelled like rot and stagnant water and filth, and the torch app on the phone illuminated almost absolutely nothing. There was nothing for it to illuminate except black water and columns and at first Sherlock's eyes didn't even register the wall in front of them because it was just another dark expanse.
This was all in avoidance of the matter at hand, however, that being the key. Sherlock hadn't been able to recall any particular place or use for it. He scanned the sitting room despondently until his eyes fell on the London A to Z, which sparked a realisation that travelled up his spine and exploded in his brain like a firework.
“You called a cab?” The woman raised her eyebrows and her intonation, indicating a question because at this point she was unsure if this seemingly insane man had actually wanted a cab.
) surrounding it. It was also a common deciduous element used in hedging, just like hawthorn, but these were clearly trees planted for ornamental reasons. Leaves still clung to them, though most of them were carpeting the gravel pathways and overgrown grass and the previously white fountain. There were four big beech trees and it was easy enough to check with a mobile application where the cardinal directions were and if the trees corresponded to them. They did. Hm.
“Coffee!” Sherlock yelled in the direction of the waitress. “Three sugars, milk!” Then he leaned towards John over the table and hissed: “I marvel at your ability to turn everything into
“Umm... no.” There was some fumbling and then there was more light as John used his phone to look around. “Here's one. 19...78?”
Not having John there was creating a maelstrom of discontent in Sherlock. He both resented and enjoyed being alone. He knew John was temperamental but it was usually overshadowed by Sherlock's even greater temperament. He also knew John wanted to make him feel guilty but Sherlock's grasp on such emotions was flimsy at best. Guilt was a product of believing moral standards had been broken and Sherlock didn't think anything was intrinsically moral or immoral and the an idea of morality applicable across all cultures was as flimsy as his grasp on guilt.
That presented Sherlock with several choices, most of which were immediately discarded (leaving, giving up, being quiet, letting John sleep). John had a DUTY, and it was to amuse Sherlock.
“I'm confused,” Lestrade muttered, shaking his head a little. It along with the look he gave Sherlock was some sort of social code that Sherlock could have interpreted had he chosen to put his mind to it, but not now. He'd ask John later.
“I agree,” John said, voice a bit shaky too. He must have been biting his teeth together to stop them from clicking together. “Tense is a better word for this than exciting. Because I'm far from excited. I'm the opposite of excited. I'm-”
“Yeah, I know,” John said with a nod. He didn't look entirely pleased that Sherlock chose a case over him (and without much debate) but it was a choice he'd made as well.
“John,” he said thickly, forcing co-operation from his tongue. John looked at him, surprised, a furrow between his brows. “I know where.” It was all he could say, but John understood. He stood up straighter, gained that soldier bearing.
“You really don't think you're human,” John said, a little calmer. There was an underlying hint of sadness as well.
“No, it doesn't,” John admitted, opening his eyes and looking up at Sherlock for a bit. “I don't need an explanation for everything. Isn't the defining feature of supernatural that it can't be explained by a naturalistic method?”
He heard John shift and take a breath, though even that was disappointed. He was disappointed about the books. How could he be when he didn't even know what was in them?
“And yet, somehow, you're still the most impossible thing.” John was peering into his face, be-amused.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned on his heel to continue walking. He seethed as he went, and deliberately did not listen to anything John said as he spoke with Mycroft. It was all a bait, was Mycroft purposefully trying to tempt him with a locked-room murder? Did that mean he had an interest in the polyphagic man? Was Sherlock reading too much into Mycroft's rather timely interest in some (probably) random murder? Despite appearances he did consider Mycroft to be very clever and nothing was beyond him. He was in a position in the world where he could do anything (moral or immoral, if he had any belief in a system of morality) to further his agenda, or the agenda of those people above him in the food chain. Hah, food chain.
“What's the point of asking you anything when you refuse to answer?” John was still nursing the first cup. Was it even warm any more? The steam was long gone, but John still curled his fingers around the cup so it must've been retaining some heat, but he took no care when drinking and looked vaguely displeased when he swallowed, so the liquid was tepid at best.
“God, Sherlock.” John was looking at him. “We've got to get it open.” He'd put his gun in the back of his jeans, and was running his hands over the surface of the thing. “We need a blowtorch or something. I'm going to ring Lestrade.”
John stood over him, one hand outstretched. Apparently horrified that Sherlock should possess the ability to make fire.
“Yeah, there should.” John gave him a look. He was mad, clearly, but Sherlock ignored it. No time for that now. He trotted back downstairs, that pleasant tingle at the base of his spine which he connected with cases and generally non-boring things (sometimes even John).
John snorted but didn't reply, keeping quiet, considerate of Mrs Hudson and their neighbours sleeping (always so NICE). Sherlock clanked the cane against the stairs and the door jamb out of spite as they took the herb garden exit (via Mrs Hudson's flat, a less known entrance to 221 Baker Street) into the damp night with the street black with condensation and street lamps wearing halos of mist. A sleepy cabbie took them in and became an unwitting accessory to their ability to trespass on the fresh crime scenes.
Sherlock shook his head. Of course he didn't. The details were always the same on the money-paying cases. Someone had lost something or someone, like their dignity or a person owing them even more money. He had a box full of trinkets they gave as tokens of their appreciation and all of them were USELESS. He had sold quite a few of them.
“John,” Sherlock said relatively softly, stroking his hair. He particularly liked waking John up because sleepy John wasn't cross with him. He remembered the crossness usually around breakfast.
“Yes, but- God, what's that smell?” John wrinkled his nose as Sherlock opened the door, and indeed an odour of unpleasant rot (not like the decaying plant matter in the garden, but the stench of dust, stillness, and decomposing animal matter) was seeping out of the darkness inside the house. The door didn't open very far because something was blocking it from the inside.
Sherlock dropped his phone on the coffee table and accepted the bowl of soup from John. He liked bacon.
The steam vortices had spread and the air was filled with slowly rotating vapour spirals. The fire had become feeble and its crackles were low and faint. Colour had drained from the flames and they were almost grey.
The visions came like the lightning before with the pulsating and strumming thunder, drawing scenes from somewhere else. Dainty hands resting on the edge of a table, a moving landscape behind a window, a train ride across English countryside. A train station somewhere, sliding through insensate people without looking at their faces. A car, another relocation. Trees, a park, the delicate hands resting passively in a lap covered with a merino wool blanket.
'It isn't even our locker,' John's face said as Sherlock glanced at him when he hadn't moved immediately, but then he just sighed and trundled along to do as he was told like a good little soldier. It was imperative the books were immediately retrieved for further study at 221B, or even the pathology lab at Barts.
“Video would have been more informative,” Sherlock replied instantly, taking the bejeweled phone. It didn't ask for a PIN, just a
John and Lestrade followed in the wide swath of space Sherlock created as he swept out of the diner (he'd taken the precaution of his good coat again because he never underestimated the power of appearances or first impressions). Lestrade had not brought a car, but cabs were more than serviceable and they allowed Sherlock to subtly gloat at Lestrade during the trip, which didn't escape John's attention. So John spent the trip frowning at Sherlock, with the expression of ‘behave, I don't want you to end up arrested AGAIN, and I particularly don't want to punch Lestrade just out of loyalty to you’. John had very loquacious face.
It was true, at least. It wasn't the worst drug-induced trip of Sherlock's life and psilocybin was relatively low-impact and low-toxicity.
“I have nothing to do with the SIS,” Mycroft sighed. “I don't understand why you keep perpetuating that myth to yourself and the rest of the world.”
Sherlock snorted and stood up, accepting the crutches. She wouldn't have been able to rent many more actual rooms, so it was probable she had found a warehouse space or some sort of industrial containers to make up into the likeness of rooms. Those would work just as well, and also made sense. She wanted more gratification faster, so she would try to expedite the process and do away with such human comforts as warmth and water. Distress compounded with narcotics and that wall-paper would undoubtedly yield pleasing results. Sherlock was probably almost as interested in seeing what would happen as she was.
“Where are you going?” John asked with mild to moderate interest. Sherlock made no reply as he wound his scarf around his neck and rattled down the stairs.
And yes. It had been fun until the obvious truth had come around like a particularly unpleasant family holiday. Sherlock sighed and squared his shoulders, looking across the street and through the façade of human hurry and life. He wanted more. Just more. He could feel the hunger, one he'd attempted to placate with legal and illegal substances, with adrenaline and solving cases. He'd even tried companionship, which had turned out to be rather agreeable (to his surprise).
“You really have no idea, do you?” John said after a moment, inhaling and exhaling deeply. He lay on his back with an arm behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. Sherlock was only halfway on the bed, with his legs over the edge, sharing John's pillow.
Sherlock swept out of the room and was escorted to the same small courtyard where they'd arrived. He was handed his things and let through the street gate. He knew exactly where he was, of course, and put on his coat, despite it being still damp and smelling quite horrid. He headed to the nearest tube stop, knowing full well that no cab would take him in this condition. He still intended to go home and have a shower, but was he then supposed to go see John? He was. Wasn't he? The socio-cultural script native to the UK concerning close family and friends and its sub-clause regarding romantic relationships dictated that he should.
The massive walls of detritus shifted and moaned as Sherlock inched forward with John attached to his back. The floor somewhere beneath the refuse must have been buckling with the weight. It creaked and unseen things skittered and scratched beyond the meagre light of Sherlock's mobile. It was unsafe, there was no doubt about that. But it was also stimulating. Sherlock felt himself grinning, which was odd because he wasn't intentionally moving the muscles in his face to achieve it.
John shook is head in exasperation and pushed the suitcase back under his bed. “Because this is MY room. My space.” He gestured around. “I deserve SOME privacy. Don't I?” The tag question was added in a resigned manner. “You get to see through me all day.”
Despite his efforts John's expression went somewhat suspicious, which Sherlock then attempted to dissuade by leaning down to kiss him. “You did the right thing,” he repeated although he disliked repeating things. “Which is what I need you to do,” he added to explain. He had barely moved his head so he spoke from his lips to John's lips.
“Not by choice,” Sherlock retorted. He didn't enjoy his humanity. It was unnecessary at best and painful at worst.
“You must have fallen.” John mumbled (and he was right, he was sometimes more clever than he let on), only studying the purple blotches first. Then he reached forward and pressed along Sherlock's ribs. “Sorry.”
John's arm shot up from the covers and slammed around Sherlock, forcing him to lie down. He did, out of surprise.
“Oh dear,” John said, unflappable, probably able to see the red light that Sherlock felt should fill his eyes right now. “Calm down, I'll get you something to drink.”
He nodded and John gave him a smile. It was a weary one, but it was there and Sherlock counted it as a personal victory (what other kinds were there). John still liked him, and would keep on doing so for the foreseeable future. Sherlock felt inclined to be nice for the rest of the evening, aided by the fact he couldn't really speak and was groggy and sore and soon back in bed.
Sherlock stared at him desperately. He was so tired and bored and utterly disappointed that he couldn't even form words.
“If you expect me to do something dreadful to you, you'll be disappointed. You're not my type, I'm afraid.”
“I'm an encumbrance now. Great, thanks. I feel better. At least I'm stopping you from killing people, I guess.”
“I KNOW,” John spoke unnecessarily loudly, his voice echoing off the water and the columns. “Stop with the damn semantics, Sherlock.”
“For God's sake, John, of course you haven't and of course I won't.” He had to shake off his jacket and unbutton his shirt, to let John look at the bruises all over his left side. There would be no peace otherwise.
John snorted and laughed. “You generalise ALL the time. And, no, stop touching my laptop. Sherlock.”
“I want to talk to the owner,” Sherlock said rather casually. John was at his elbow, looking around the shop.
This one was still in control. Or thought he was. The execution of the dual murder had been impeccable, and he retained deniability. He hadn't actually killed the girls. Kidnapped and imprisoned, perhaps, but not killed. None of the cases could be tied to him directly. His methods were almost admirable. Using madness to do the work. Indirect, but effective.
“Shut up.” John's patience was starting to snap, like a rubber band stretched too far. It had been known to happen sometimes and usually it ended with violence. “Stay here, stop playing with fire and stop nicking things that don't belong to you.”
) and Sherlock suspected Mycroft was the ambulatory part of it. He'd always considered fungi to be fundamentally conniving because they were neither flora nor fauna. Mycroft fit right in, also being neither flora nor fauna.
“Yes. Let me watch the security tape.” Sherlock headed out of the room. “Get the corpse to an ME. John, go with the body and find out everything you can.”
“Any more body parts?” Sherlock asked. The scandalous news report had suspected the polyphagic man of eating a toddler at the hospital. One could only hope.
John looked at him now, eyes round in surprise and jaw relaxed. “That- that's nice,” he said quietly.
Sherlock had slowed his pace, and John was looking at him expectantly, waiting to hear the acknowledgement that he was right. A satisfaction Sherlock was loathe to part with. “Hunger doesn't preclude logic.”
“Don't you have dozens of operatives trained for that sort of situation?” Sherlock said. “Can you just get to the point? I've reading to do.” The water had boiled so he took out a tea bag and laid out a single cup.
“Maybe it isn't anything,” John said. He remained steadfastly unimpressed by the whole book and the house they'd found it in. Sometimes aggressively unimpressed to the point of refusing to talk about it.
“Well, only technically. We're actually only trespassing so far,” Sherlock said with a little smirk, shrugging a little.
Despite the seriousness of the matter at hand Sherlock felt relatively good. John engaged him on multiple levels and that reminded him of who he was. That was what he needed right now. “She will come back for me.”
The boredom had had its effect on Sherlock. He'd had a nightmare about being in one of those tanks. Not because he had been or was afraid of the killer, but because he was terrified of the idea of having his senses culled, having the thread of his existence removed. The small space wasn't the problem, he could overcome something like that, he had trained his mind well.
John moved suddenly and though Sherlock caught the movement, he wasn't able to dodge out of the way completely, and the pillow John wielded hit him in the shoulder. “Next one's going to be something harder,” John warned him. “In fact, the next one might just be a god damn bullet.”
“What,” Sherlock said in reply. He had forgot again that people other than himself needed a visual representation of someone before they could be recognised. How could they not read manners and expressions and the tens of tells everyone had, just hanging on them like Christmas ornaments. That is how obvious they were. John had his giant, shiny red bauble of ‘army’ tacked onto him, and the slightly smaller one of ‘doctor’, along with the myriad other colours and sizes of decorations ranging from his frown of ‘Sherlock, you are being an arse’ to the ‘I'm casual and not at all 40 years old’ stripey shirt.
He helped Sherlock up and onto the crutches, leaving him to hobble back to his bedroom. Sherlock crawled onto his bed and lay down with a sigh of relief. There'd be complete darkness, forgetfulness, painlessness. The boredom would be gone, the dreadful experience of being conscious. It would be glorious. He adored John.
“All right,” John said. His voice had that rough edge which meant Sherlock had gotten under his skin. “What am I? Sandpaper?”
“Yes,” John was quick to assert that yes, it was indeed what they wanted. He wrote the address down in his little notebook (Sherlock knew this even without looking).
The voice came from the doorway and Sherlock turned slowly to look Miss Price in the eye again. She had a gun, a real one this time, not a taser.
“Oh God.” Lestrade leaned back and rubbed the bridge of his nose, eyes tightly shut. “Why did you need me here again? John?”
Sherlock tried to light another cigarette but that was plucked from his fingers as well and then John dug into Sherlock's coat pocket to get the pack. “No,” he said, crushing the pack in his hand and throwing it in the nearest bin.
“If you like, I'll go and take the laptop and you don't have to move an inch,” John continued, voice a little quieter, a little less hopeful. “We really do need to pay the rent, Sherlock. It's due and it's not fair to Mrs Hudson.”
“No,” he said and stood up. And since all conventional means of entering the room and killing the late doctor had been secured he was forced to look into the unconventional. “What exactly did he say before he died?”
“Okay.” John straightened his legs in front of him and looked at his toes, then at Sherlock. “Tea?” he asked kindly. Sherlock looked back, but said nothing, which set John into motion, shuffling into the kitchen and back a minute later with a cup that had a cloud of steam above it.
“I talked to the younger son, Edmund, next. He confirmed his mother's habit of taking Valium in the evening and drinking vodka when she's upset. He also told me that the eldest daughter, Maria, had a wedding in two weeks and that everybody's been busy with the preparations.”
“Yethh,” Sherlock spat and instantly regretted doing so. It sounded ridiculous, and it made his mouth ache.
“You're wrong,” Sherlock declared, gaining on victory. Being right was the most important part of any conversation. “They are exactly the type of p-” He was startled by a touch to his arm.
She worked in a salon. A hair salon, a nail salon, a tanning salon, a beauty salon - one of those. A salon. Different types of salons had their tells, but Sherlock was not an expert (he would happily admit to it, even) and many of them had a mix of above services, making telling them apart even more arduous. She had blonde hair extensions but her hair was naturally dark, her facial features suggested Indian descent. Her accent suggested West London. Her nails suggested fakeness (but expensive, gel-tipped, flawless French manicure fakeness).
The site was closed off with a chain link fence and notices saying the place was guarded, which made John hesitate as they circled round to find a gate. Sherlock was only sorry he was unable to ring the private security contractor to make a convincing lie why they'd need to get into the building. The gate turned out to be too impressively locked so Sherlock moved onto the next plan and pulled out a pair of wire-cutters from his pocket. It never hurt to be prepared, and these sites tended to be surrounded by fences of some sort. He'd just gotten lucky on chain link versus wood.
“I told you not to come up here.” John had taken in the state of the room. The open doors of the wardrobe, the rummaged up drawers, the medical journals and the photographs out of their envelopes.
There was some quiet time after that because Sherlock was considering what had just been said. Simply promising to be committed was enough? Did John not realise how easy it was to lie? Not that Sherlock had been lying. He had actually been quite sincere. He also felt John relax next to him, possibly attempting to go back to sleep. Had the hour in the water really affected him that much or had he contracted an infection? Sherlock felt relatively fine, but then again, he lived off of ego-boosting and nicotine patches. And occasionally jam sandwiches.
“No,” John said, glancing at Lestrade who was used to their crime scene flirting and fighting and didn't interrupt. “Why would I be happy someone's dead?”
“I thought so.” John nodded at him and leafed through some more pages. “Though are you sure it's a code and not just made-up gibberish?”
“There should be a socially accepted reason for killing people,” Sherlock remarked, flipping his phone around and slipping it in his pocket.
Sherlock made a face, but said nothing. Stating the obvious was as painful as his injuries. He felt John check his foot for abrasions and then begin bandaging his it again. Sherlock detached his mind from the constraints of the present and considered the killer's flat again. It was purely for show. She needed a safe place. Somewhere near. It had to be in the building, the house was meaningful to her.
“Sherlock,” John said behind him. Sherlock had forgot him and Lestrade. “Sherlock, look,” John bid him and Sherlock turned. John was holding a picture frame in one hand and a picture cut from a magazine in the other. “They're not real photos. None of them.”
Sherlock glanced at him. “Big leap to make from a hand alone,” he said, but approvingly. Though needless to say it was pointless to entertain theories before all the facts were present.
“Hello, Mycroft,” he said. At least he'd picked up some deductive skills along the way, having been able to tell from Sherlock's (rather transparent) replies who'd just rang him. “So you have a new spycam on us?”
“Fine, what do you want to do then?” John asked in a whisper. Was that a hint of excitement in his voice? What did he expect?
“John,” he gasped and John supported him. “Get me the hell out of here.” Sherlock glared at him and shoved him towards the door. John hesitated, but only a little.
The girl came back and moved away, and was soon followed by a perfectly pleasant-looking woman (and John was about to object that this must not be Miss Price), but Sherlock recognised her manner immediately. She had that smile, the same he wore sometimes, the one that said ‘I'm normal and not a threat’. Only people who categorised the world with ‘hunters’ and ‘prey’ needed to make that distinction, when they wanted to show they were a threat and when they weren't. (Sherlock had a few more categories, most of them comprising of a single person, like ‘John’ and ‘Mrs Hudson’ and of course ‘me, myself and I.’)
“Yes, absolutely,” Sherlock said, understanding the irony of using that word in this context. “No deed is
“Sherlock, no. You don't think..? No one can strangle people without actually being present.” John was apprehensive. “It's much more likely it was the stress of the situation catching up to him. Straining can cause the capillaries to burst and create bruises and bleeds in the eyes.”
“What would make you nervous? You're experienced with romantic and sexual situations.” Sherlock brought out a flick knife from his pocket, flipping it open and offering it to John by the blade.
Sherlock snorted. The POINT of nicking things was that they belonged to SOMEONE ELSE. If they were his already then it wasn't stealing, it was just moving them from one location to another. Sometimes, Sherlock had admitted this to himself, he took things just to have John react, but the best part was he never knew what John would react to or how he would react. He was amused at some, but strict about harmless things like cigarettes (they had been low-tar, too, Sherlock had been moderating himself which he'd thought John would appreciate).
“Well… yes, that is something I'm struggling with,” Gibson admitted, patting one of the monitors sadly. “At any rate, so far no one has been able to withstand the vibration and their bodies have… liquefied.”
“Sherlock,” John said, to call Sherlock's attention back to the physical world. “I'm sorry but you're going to eat only liquid food for some time so bacon is out of the question.”
Sherlock leaned over him and kissed him on the mouth. He would continue to do that until John gave up. At least it clearly took his mind off the dark house as he opened his eyes and stared up at Sherlock. Then he lifted his hand and placed it on Sherlock's cheek and they kissed some more.
John curled his hand around the back of Sherlock's neck for a moment, then helped him up. “Lean on me,” he instructed. “You faked that stumble, didn't you?” His voice was still level, just the slightest bit amused. “To give me the shot.”
He took out the bottle of tablets and poured a pile of them into his palm, drinking them down with a gulp of John's (horrid, black) coffee. “Did he have the information I asked for?”
The atmosphere was chilly at best when Sherlock arrived on the murder scene. He was a bit smug because the crime scene was rarely inside the Met's headquarters. John was actually waiting for him outside the main entrance and there was a very delicate shift of mood and expression on him. Sherlock paused to study the phenomenon and after about a second could deduce that John was happier than the previous few days. There was no smile but a subtle variation in the pattern of the creases on his face and posture told Sherlock everything he needed.
The room itself wasn't particularly big, but its dimensions were distorted by the dark and the lack of clear space. At least the fire gave Sherlock a fixed point of reference and he was able to make his way back there, having left his phone by the door to mark it. He could tell he was shaking now, but he could still suppress it. He stuffed the vellum pages into the pocket of his coat that still hung on John when he got there.
He was on the sofa with the Union Jack -pillow (it smelled like coffee, John had probably spilt some on it) pressed over his face when John made his appearance.
“She wasn't murdered,” Sherlock whispered. He'd have loved to watch John's face as he worked this out first thing in the morning, but he was interrupted by his mobile ringing. Upon picking it up he was faced with a
From the middle of the light came a voice. “Sherlock!” it said. Its familiarity cut through the thick soup of sound created by the rain and thunder.
“Tea?” John asked then and Sherlock found they'd arrived back at 221B again. He was stood in the doorway and facing the sitting room, still wearing his coat. John was already in the kitchen making the tea (so a reply was unnecessary as it was forthcoming anyway). Sherlock slowly took off his coat and proceeded into the sitting room. It was still early-to-mid-morning. The case had been much less of a challenge than Sherlock had expected, which was the whole reason for his current disenchantment with the world.
They climbed the stairs, John hedging on every step. “What did you mean by ‘lucid enough’?” he finally asked as they made it to the top landing, the door sealed with crime scene tape which Sherlock proceeded to ignore completely as he crouched in front of the door.
“I'm afraid the point is moot,” she whispered. She had drunk the tea too. “You're what I've been looking for. Clever, strong, healthy. Male. I think I'll do well. And you'll be compensated.”
“Why don't you ask Mycroft?” John said. Sherlock glared at him and then almost lunged out of the bed and the room. Clearly John didn't take this thing seriously enough. But he was also right. Not about asking Mycroft, but about the (unsaid) issue of not having a lot to go on. In fact, the only interesting thing that remained was John himself, which was often the case and which was why Sherlock didn't just leave.
“The hand,” John said. “He seems to have... chewed on it a bit so I think that probably means he, er, he was trying to eat it.”
Sherlock watched John as he typed in his typical hunch over the laptop. He was the only moving part, the only thing distracting enough to keep Sherlock from falling into the abyssal embrace of tedium. For such an unelaborate man he was an observer's delight. He took away the lingering memory of the horror of Sherlock's nightmare and the need to keep his brain awake with pain. John made it almost... peaceful.
“Sometimes, sure,” John replied, making Sherlock's stomach lurch uncomfortably. Something in his face must've given up that sensation because John turned a little more and leaned over to kiss him softly. “Sorry,” he muttered then, as if on cue, but he remained close and spoke again: “I think you kissed me on a whim and that whim's going to end sooner or later.”
John was all ‘we’s, all the time, even if both of them knew their lives were mostly about Sherlock, which suited Sherlock just fine. It was as it should be.
This new room wasn't as full as where they'd entered the house. It was on the same floor, the north-east side. It was dark with no sign of natural light, just full shelves and a few desks with equipment hidden under protective hoods. At least one microscope. Jars and brushes and piles of books. Sherlock forgot about being cold and wet and not knowing how to get out as he surged forward, looking around in the faint light of his mobile. There was glycerine-based hand-sanitiser by the covered microscope. He grabbed it. Someone had used this as a laboratory and a workroom. Sherlock's guess? The book forger, Mr Ljuga.
“But my mesolimbic pathway,” Sherlock tried, tilting his head back. His lymph nodes were fine, but John refused to take his word for it and moved to palpitate under his arms.
Sherlock found himself clutching at the elbows of John's gingham shirt, pulling at him. After a bit John tilted his head again to separate their lips, breathing a puff of warm air on Sherlock's mouth. He rubbed his thumbs over Sherlock's eyebrows and held his face a little longer.
“Inductive thinking! Opposite of the science of deduction,” Sherlock corrected him. “I left to go do my body part experiments at Barts this morning because you were in a vegetative state from last night's outing, and worked on them for several hours until I learned of a new corpse that had just been brought in from a crime scene, untouched, and no cause of dead was immediately evident.”
The problem was that John's artless version (how was he making a living as a storyteller?) of the events still didn't explain what had actually happened because for once Sherlock couldn't trust himself or his perceptions of the world. And even if his perceptions were correct on the sensory level, was his brain transforming the signals correctly? The out-of-body experience must have been a hallucination. A very strange shared hallucination.
“Fine, I take back the idiot,” John huffed and proceeded over to slam a piece of paper on the desk in front of Sherlock. He also brought along a whiff of pub, which made Sherlock glance at his watch. Oh, more time had passed than he'd thought and John had gone to drown his anger at—not his favourite pub, wrong smell—but a pub on the way. There was a name and an address on the piece of paper.
“I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about,” Sherlock replied, getting up and fastening the button of his rather ruined jacket.
“John,” Sherlock intoned. “I DID text you, even if you were completely useless at the time and never replied. And you're now realising you've no memory of this happening and are wondering where you mobile is and if the text is still there. Your mobile is in the pocket of the cardigan you wore last night, OBVIOUSLY, and the text is still there because you never delete any texts from me. Don't. Get up. To check.” Sherlock raised his hand and looked at John who had already sat up to go do just that.
His words disintegrated into hoarse and discordant ‘no’s and he began to shake. He began to choke suddenly and stood up, pushing his chair over. He had lifted his hands to his throat and pulled at the collars of his cardigan and button-up. “Alice..!” he groaned. “Alice, no, please, no!”
“You're bored,” John said as if this was a great revelation. “God, you're really bored, aren't you? There are two women still in danger and you're bored and want to go home and eat sweets all evening. You can't be serious. Sherlock. You need to see this through.”
Another door led to what Sherlock found likely to be a bedroom. There was no kitchen; the place was a full care facility. The sitting room was furnished with a few small ornate armchairs, a delicate coffee table like a rose and a grand piano in the corner by the large bay window that gave out to the well-kept grounds mostly hidden by the darkness in the back of the building. Rain had dotted the window glass behind the heavy drapes that had been carefully arranged aside. There was a vase of fresh cut flowers (calla lilies) on the coffee table. The chairs faced a small working fireplace which had been lit which was the only source of light in the room. There was another vase of flowers on the mantle. More lilies.
She looked at him for a brief moment in askance, then realised Sherlock wasn't going to elaborate. “I described it's rough measurements and where it was found. About five centimetres in length, found in the anterior metacarpus of the severed hand, which in turn was located in the gullet of the deceased.”
Since there was pointless protocol and procedure before the corpse actually made it to an examination table, Sherlock spent the time waiting for a text from John. There was none. Sherlock felt mildly agitated about it.
Sherlock stopped making the chair go around. He felt a bit nauseous and had to admit Molly had a point. He didn't say so but gave her a little nod of acknowledgement. She sometimes had insights, but unfortunately they were never about her.
“Yes, I have a procurement agency with which I was set up by a friend. The same friend who provided me with your number. They've worked out well so far, always providing me with what I needed. However, I am willing to reveal their identities in exchange for a deal with the police.”
Doctor. Of course. “Sherlock Holmes. PhD in physics? Previously a professor at Cambridge?” Sherlock greeted him. He had set his mobile to record voice in the cab; a precaution he'd learned early on.
“Rii-ight.” John rolled his eyes. “Why don't you get some secret service lackey to do that thing you wanted us to do? Yeah, bye.” John handed the phone back to Sherlock. “Happy now?”
There was an undercurrent to his words and stance that Sherlock took as a warning. Or worry. And it was a bit of a surprise. Sherlock had thought Lestrade appreciated being able to take credit for most of the cases he solved, even the weird ones. Was he worried Sherlock wouldn't be able to solve this one? Or was he worried about Sherlock personally? John would know the difference, Sherlock just frowned.
Sherlock had moved the hand under a water tap, letting warm water on it, helping the glue loose with a scalpel. Despite his desire to know if there was a key inside the fist, he didn't wish to mutilate the hand beyond recognition. There could be any number of things he still needed from it. After a moment he became aware of Molly continuing her autopsy of the polyphagic man and the fact that John had gone. He looked up and around.
“I know what hunger feels like,” Sherlock retorted. He was NOT amused by John's use of that line (though it most likely was not intentional
“Because he asked,” Molly replied, fussing with some microscope slides. She spent a lot of time alone in the labs. And at home. Sherlock didn't know (care) much about her home life, it probably involved cats and cutesy things.
