“Hassim, you’re going to help me get my friend down,” Sherlock explained coolly. Then he waved his arm at the rest. “Out,” he directed abruptly.
He monitored John’s progress for some hours, and was intrigued when John finally returned to nearby Regent’s Park, and seemed to come to an exhausted halt near the Open Air Theatre. Sherlock put the phone aside and resumed his work on the Brazilian network for a while (upstart cartel competition needed squashing—boring, really, once he’d figured out who the ring leaders were. Humanity rarely surprised Sherlock Holmes.) After some 15 minutes, he checked his phone to find that John had not moved from Regent’s Park.
“Of course,” John said, trying for a tone that was light, dry, bitter, polite, frosty, and ironic, all in two syllables. He was still staring at his novel, but his head tipped the way it did when his spine and neck had tensed up, and his teeth wanted to clench, but he was fighting it. Sherlock waited, diverted, to see if John would look up first, or turn the page. He was going to do one of them in the next 10 seconds, because Sherlock’s lack of response (and steady stare) was stripping John’s nerves bare, and some sort of restless movement was forthcoming.
With a jerk of his head, Sherlock directed one of the henchmen to take Hassim in a headlock. The young man let out a gasp, and his hands came up to grip the other man’s thick arm, but he did not otherwise react, seeming uncertain that this was really happening.
Florescent lights shone overhead, but he was in a bottom bunk and the worst of it was blocked by the top bunk. Listening to the discontented sounds around him, John surmised that someone had just turned on the lights, marking the end of the evening and the signal for the inhabitants to turn out and hit the streets. Shelters had specific hours, he’d found.
“I’m flattered that you want to die in my arms, John, but I wasn’t planning to fulfill that particular fantasy tonight,” Sherlock responded, and his head tipped back to watch John’s mind whir about like a rat in a maze.
John dropped the pole and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, allowing the taller man to provide the security for both of them, and buried his face in the other man’s collarbone.
Sherlock entered the warehouse slowly, and turned when what looked like a foreman approached. “Oi, you can’t just come in ‘ere—izzat yer mate up there? Get ‘im down and get outta ‘ere!” The man barked. Sherlock stared him up and down for a second, turned to his phone, and sent a text.
When they got into the darkened bedroom, John turned to face the taller man in the dim light from the street, but Sherlock’s eyes were fixed on their clasped hands. He lifted them and brought his other hand up to cradle John’s. “How very different they look,” he commented, lifting his eyes to gaze at John from under his long lashes. John’s own gaze flicked over their hands with nervous speed, becoming increasingly uneasy that whatever Sherlock had planned, hands had something to do with it.
“Perhaps when I take the next section—“
“Is that for me to grab hold of, or for you to push me off with, John?” Sherlock asked.
“Is tonight the night, then?” He asked unconcernedly, though his entire body was growing as tense as his neck. “I don’t have to worry about retirement anymore?”
“If you shoot him, I’m coming down the fast way.” John said calmly.
From the leafy depths of the tree, John stared down with bated breath as Sherlock stormed over, gathered up the shirt, discovered the bloody microchip, and stiffened in shock. Clutching the branches, John willed his body not to tremble in the cool air, and his breath to slip as silently as possible from his lungs. His jacket was bundled and tucked underneath the plastic liner of the bin below him, as being too light a tan and too visible in the greenery of the park. Up in his hiding place in the tree, John was dressed in dark jeans and a dark green shirt over the blue one. Two shirts and a vest were not sufficient to provide warmth in this crisp weather, but anything was better than being spotted.
Sherlock reached the bin and leaned over it. There, wadded and bloodstained, was John’s shirt. He reached in and drew it out carefully, unfolding it to find a blood stained razorblade, the wrappings of a bandaid, and… the smudged microchip.
“I think you love me,” Sherlock corrected him, and pushed in deeper. John threw his head back and opened his mouth in a soundless scream. “Don’t you?” Sherlock added, jiggling his arm a bit and watching in aroused amusement as John writhed in reaction. “Say it,” Sherlock added challengingly. This would be rather a lark, wringing such a declaration from John.
Sherlock steepled his fingers under his chin and stared off into the middle distance beyond the cabinetry of his kitchen. There was something very odd about that bundle: shirt, chip, razor, wrapper. He shook his head slowly. Something very odd about it.
“John,” Sherlock said, close enough to speak in a normal voice.
Sherlock tugged his jacket on and gave his curls one more appraising glance in the mirror before striding into the kitchen to check the GPS on his phone. Yes, John was riding the Tube all over London, first in one panicked direction, and then in the other. Sherlock was amused to see an almost perfect 5 pointed star marked as his frenzied path. Such a linear thinker was John. He almost wondered how the man had burrowed such a place in the otherwise frozen tundra of his heart. Smirking, Sherlock briefly imagined John as some intense little animal that lived naturally in tundra. Perhaps an arctic ground squirrel, they were feisty little creatures, he was sure.
“Tell me I’m wonderful, John,” Sherlock sucked briefly on the purple head just by his mouth, and looked up at John, who was digging the side of his head into the pillow.
Approval fairly oozed from Sherlock as he accepted the hand and let John pull him from the chair firmly. John loosened his grip to release Sherlock’s hand, but the other man held tight, and they strolled through the kitchen to the bedroom hand in hand, very much like the lovers Sherlock wished they were. Not at all like the desperate captive eager to get through whatever it was so that he could gather the scattered bits of his composure and pride back together, and escape into the sweet oblivion of sleep, at least for a few hours.
John gave him a haunted look. “It would serve you bloody right,” he told him, taking his position and moving his hands down to the end of the stick.
John swallowed. “Sherlock,” he said tremulously, “that’s dangerous, that’s… the human body isn’t meant to… Jesus, at least tell me you’ve Googled prolapsed anus!”
This was part of the game: Sherlock staring at John, who pretended to be oblivious, and John staring at his novel, which had gone blank before his eyes.
Sherlock smiled, knowing full well it was difficult to ignore. He knew exactly how John liked it; tight, medium pace, long strokes, a twist at the head. He used both hands, fondling and rolling John’s scrotum, being just a bit rough—but not too much, with the fully distended member in his expert hands.
Sherlock snapped out of his memory to see that they had pulled up to a warehouse near the docks. Of course. It’s always a warehouse. Twitching the coat over his groin to hide the evidence of his wandering thoughts, Sherlock exited the vehicle and strode toward the warehouse doors, checking his mobile as he came. Then he looked up.
It took John a moment to understand he was being given one last chance to jerk the pole left or right, throwing Sherlock off balance, and then simply letting physics take their course. He ground his teeth together, hating Sherlock Holmes with all of his heart. He was rubbing it in, that John couldn’t bring himself to make one simple move to guarantee his own safety and freedom.
“We don’t want lube on your cock, John, because once my fist is inside you, I’ll be sucking on it.” Sherlock informed him, eyes icy hot. John made a guttural noise, but managed to squelch it quickly. Sherlock smiled. “You’ll be more vocal soon, I promise you.”
“Oh, you are eager tonight,” Sherlock commented, his fingers tickling and teasing John’s opening as his captive tried not to squirm too wantonly. After a moment, Sherlock stopped his teasing strokes, and John felt him lean away to pick up something from the end table on his own side of the bed. Sherlock sat up to slide the cock ring onto John’s straining erection with the hand that did not have the glove on.
“John, if you don’t come down, I’ll have to splatter this poor boy’s brains all over the wall,” Sherlock called up, eyes riveted on his partner.
He checked back at the pattern on his mobile to see roughly where John had been 15 minutes before arriving at the Park. Then he dispatched messages to his homeless network to find when, and where, and who could have possibly removed the chip and sent a bloody, bandaged man back onto the Tube clutching his shirt…
Hassim let out another inarticulate cry, his feet dancing around in panic. The henchman tightened his grip on him.
John was already shaking his head. “You know your henchmen down there—“
His ruminations usually failed him at that. But now, laying awake at 3am as Sherlock slept beside him, John was spurred by a new fear (and anger) that Sherlock actually had the gall to wring a declaration of love from him by painful means. John returned mentally to the problem of the chip.
John clambered from the bed and shuffled into the restroom to try and sort himself. He wanted to look presentable, whatever his situation.
Sherlock fell back in horror. That beam stretched over nothing, and there was nothing to grasp for long stretches between girders. “No, John, no, no… stop,” he shouted, “I’m stopping, I won’t—“ Sherlock backed away rapidly, and John stared down at him meaningfully.
Sherlock carefully withdrew his fingers for a moment and reached for more lube. “Now let’s see what you’re capable of, John,” he whispered, and brought his hand back to John’s buttocks, forcing them apart insistently. John felt the fingers enter and knew that all four were in play now. He was stretched wide, wider than Sherlock’s cock – which had plundered him so many times. Wide like the massive black dildo that occasionally made an appearance when Sherlock wanted John arse up and trembling while the leather strap slapped down just below the smooth protruding thickness, until a burning red stripe decorated his cheeks, sometimes for days afterward.
was the short answer.
And now they were back where they were, and Sherlock had no card left to play, unless… his eyes ran along the length of the beam, and back to John.
John’s inner voice said in a weary tone. Whatever little battle John was mounting was lost before it started.
By the slow inhale, he could see that Sherlock now understood the direction his thoughts were taking.
John stared back at him wordlessly.
Sherlock stepped into the street and summoned the car with a wave of one long, gloved hand. In the other hand, his phone reassured him that John had not budged. It was late afternoon and growing very cool. A quick survey of John’s closet before leaving had showed him that three shirts were missing, so clearly John had put a bit of thought into his flight, even in his haste. Sherlock settled into the back seat and directed the driver toward Regent Park.
When Sherlock began his trek, anything John had been thinking about vanished, and he clutched the joist in panic, watching the taller man in those terribly shiny, smooth looking shoes balancing on the narrow beam as he stepped out over the vast emptiness below him. His mouth open, John drew in his breath to cry out against the risk Sherlock was taking, but found himself afraid to make a sound lest he distract the man and send him plummeting to his death.
To his amusement, about a dozen of the workers seemed to be gathered at the open bay door of the warehouse, looking in and up at something that had caught their attention. Something far above the storage bins stacked high with recently imported goods. Something up in the lofty beams beneath the ceiling a good 60 meters above the hard cement floor.
Chills swept over John. “Depends on the man,” he said as unconcernedly as he could.
“Please, Sherlock, please, please,” John panted, barely audible, as Sherlock gave his cock one teasing lick. “Oh, God… Sherlock, please, ah—“
John put his elbows on the table. “I don’t see why some of your henchmen couldn’t do it,” he said grumpily. “It’s not that hard to pick out the right jam, and there’s nothing else we need.”
The GPS chip behind his shoulder blade was the biggest issue. John had spent many an hour going round in his head, how to get it out. He couldn’t reach it himself, and getting help from anyone else, be it doctor, veterinarian, or well, he couldn’t imagine anyone else with the skill, but—Sherlock would find out who had helped him, and murder that person in cold blood. John had no doubt of that. He’d seen it happen before, in their earlier days.
“—You might just try to jiggle the beam a bit,” Sherlock suggested helpfully, his face aglow with an unholy light. “Wasn’t there a story about that? A boy who jiggles a branch his friend is standing on, in a moment of resentment, and his friend falls to his death?”
Sherlock eyed him until John quit inching about on the beam, finding the spot furthest out that did not place him over the abyss as well. Finally, when John was ready, he grabbed the joist with his free hand, and gazed back at his tormentor. “What?” He snapped, nerves clearly wearing through their last bit of protective coating.
“I can unless you take that pole and—“
In fact, he was a little affronted at how tardy Sherlock was in coming to claim his prize. John had imagined Sherlock chasing him through the underground, waiting with a cold, triumphant smile at every Tube station, whirling around corners with that jacket flaring out, only a few moments behind him at any given time.
Sherlock prowled the sidewalk, eyes flicking from one anonymous nobody to the next. That one was a shoplifter, this one was spying on his girlfriend, these two were planning a vacation… but no John. He glanced down to his mobile and came to a halt. The GSP signal showed John moving away and… apparently on a major thoroughfare. Sherlock stared… John was moving too rapidly to be on foot. He turned with a flaring sweep of his coat and motioned the henchmen back to the car. The game was on!
“Oh, I’m always interested,” John rejoined sarcastically. “Nothing interests me more than knowing what the man who holds my life in his hands is planning for our next adventure.”
He stared at the mobile again, and morosely regarded the pulsing signal from the chip, now at Baker Street. Where John should be. After a moment, Sherlock disabled the signal and put the phone down again. Who had helped John remove the chip?
It was always enjoyable to watch John’s initial attempts at stoicism. He was usually determinedly silent at the onset of their play. Sherlock, clad in comfortable silk bottoms, sat cross-legged between John’s splayed thighs, and lubed his hands up calmly before beginning to stroke and tease John’s very exposed cock and balls. John was half-hard before they even began; he usually was. Heart pounding, eyes fixed on the ceiling, throat occasionally moving in a swallow, John lay ignoring the man who stroked his hardening length.
Sherlock’s lips twitched in a rather nervous little smile. “You do know how to make a statement, John,” he breathed, although now, of course, John could not hear him. Sherlock pocketed his now useless mobile and looked up at John appraisingly. John let go of the joist and stood balanced on the beam, holding on to nothing.
Sherlock found to his surprise that he was actually smiling. This was really quite diverting! He sat back in the car and, when not directing the driver, found himself replaying one of their last erotic sessions in his mind.
He waited for John to compose himself, and eventually, his soldier pulled himself together, straightened up and stood, assessing Sherlock’s position. He had one last length to cross, and then he and John would be together again.
“I suppose you want to go to the store and get more,” Sherlock said calmly, eyes never leaving his screen.
Perhaps John had kept the chip with him to help mask the identity of whoever had aided him? Sherlock sat back in his leather chair by the fireplace. Yes… yes, that fit John’s moral profile. He would be anxious not to see another Angelo die in a hail of bullets. Grimly, Sherlock brooded that Angelo had been lucky compared to the sorry chap who dared to help John Watson. He’d put the word out nearly a year ago:
“What a good sport you are, John. It’s wonderful how you’ve adapted,” Sherlock said mockingly, and shrugged off his own jacket, turning away to unbutton his shirt and divest himself of his perfectly tailored second skin. When John was naked and Sherlock was, unsurprisingly, in comfortable pajama bottoms but shirtless, John noticed an alteration to the bed. The corner restraints that so often awaited him had been replaced by a single chain in the top center of the bed. The chain disappeared down between the mattress and headboard, probably hooked to the frame beneath. At the business end were two leather cuffs. Whatever event Sherlock had planned for tonight, having John’s arms spread out in the usual manner was no part of it.
Sherlock stilled. That was a bit much, taking the razor and wrapper with him. Perhaps the band-aid was a back up and he’d bled through the first one. Possible. And the razor, he might have feared it…? Would implicate his accomplice? But disposing of something so small would be simple. But the band-aid…
John turned and made his way to the back of the store. He had not decided between options 2 and 3 yet, but he certainly wasn’t ready for option 1. He searched the back wall until he found an EXIT sign over steel double doors, and pushed through them. Cutting through the cluttered holding area and out the back, John expected any moment to be confronted by store employees telling that he “couldn’t be back ‘ere, mate,” but apparently he’d chosen a good moment, because he found his way through and out the back to the loading bay without seeing more than the back of a cover-all clad figure pushing a stack of boxes on a hand-truck.
Sherlock was temporarily diverted at the feel of John’s body clamping down on his wrist, and watched the extended gyrations of the man as he was wracked by waves of pleasure and pain. Obligingly, he shoved his fist in a little deeper, and John let out such a deep, prolonged moan that Sherlock reached down to take himself in his one free hand and gave himself a few hard jerks, climaxing almost immediately. His eyes fluttered closed for a moment, and he was rather displeased with himself for missing even a split second of John’s agonizing ecstasy. But, he thought, regulating his breathing and beginning to carefully work his fist out of his wrung out lover, he could certainly do it again some time.
“No,” he heard John say, and immediately the smaller man let go of the joist again and looked as if he were going to attempt to cross the beam to the other side of the warehouse.
Taking care not to betray any frantic movements, John stepped into the store, tugged his hat further down over his face, and turned to watch the car troll along the sidewalk. After a moment, it came to a smooth stop, and a tall, slim figure in a long black coat stepped out. John felt the blood roar in his ears. Was this dumb luck on Sherlock’s part? Or an uncanny knowledge of John’s plans? Or… John’s heart sank to see Sherlock consult his mobile with searching eyes and then glance around him again, like an eagle scanning for prey.
At the 8 second mark, John heaved a sigh, closed the book, put it aside, and tipped his head in the opposite direction to return Sherlock’s gaze.
And when John, plodding through his spy novel, had a sudden tingling feeling that the air had grown still, he looked up and saw the pale, still thing with pale, still eyes that focused on him like a cold blue laser…
His only escape would be if… an idea occurred to John that was shocking in its simplicity. What if Sherlock BELIEVED the chip had been removed? Even if it hadn’t. He’d stop trying to track John via GPS if he thought it was useless. John lay for a moment, blinking rapidly in the dark. Yes. Well, maybe.
Now the two men faced each other, high up beneath the ceiling of the warehouse, alone together in a world of metal beams that came together in triangular fractals that seemed to recede on all sides. Sherlock came to stand on the same beam, at the far end, and—like John—reached out to steady himself on the nearest joist. John felt the faintest vibration of Sherlock’s foot stepping onto the beam his own feet rested on.
It was astonishing, Sherlock found, how often he found himself more interested in John’s orgasm than his own. And he certainly applied himself to learning John’s limits – and teaching John a thing or two about the flexibility of those limits. For instance, pleasure tended to make pain more bearable; this was not a new concept. And muscles and tendons were often more elastic than the mind that registered their complaints. Any dancer knew that the body learned to accommodate the demands placed upon it, if the demands were placed gradually, but inexorably.
“No witnesses,” Sherlock said invitingly. “You can leave my body lying on the floor and slip out the back.”
There was always that moment that John hesitated, knowing that once the restraints were on, he was utterly at the other man’s meager mercy. Always that moment he rebelled, in his heart, even if arousal was pooling in his stomach. It mixed with the anxiety in his chest and paralyzed him for a moment.
Immediately breaking a sweat, John threw himself out of his chair, sprinted to the bedroom, and yanked his clothes on over his pajamas. Then, on impulse, he pulled another button down shirt on over the blue one he already had on. Then a third, a white and burgundy checked one that was rather eye-catching. Without hesitating, he turned and made for the closet where his jacket hung. He heard the water turn on in the shower as he flew out the door and pattered down the steps to fling himself out the front door.
he’d gloat internally, as he bored holes in John’s neck and face with his eyes.
John was eyeing him hotly. “Very funny,” he said, and seemed about to launch into a serious rant, when Sherlock decided to take the plunge (or more hopefully, not.) Spreading his arms wide, Sherlock released the joist, steadied himself, and began to walk across the beam toward John. His only goal was to get to the next joist, and given that it was a mere 10 steps, he felt it was… quite do-able.
Making less effort to be stealthy now, John unwrapped the bread and popped two pieces into the toaster. Just in case.
Sherlock’s eyes brightened still more, and his lips curved into an… almost breathless smile. “The man who holds your life in his hands,” he mused in a wondering tone. “How… apt. Especially tonight.”
John, startled into action, put the pole under his arm and directed the end out to Sherlock, who stepped carefully to it, grasped it… and stopped, four steps from safety, looking at John expectantly.
John’s eyes widened immediately, and of course, Sherlock noticed. “My, my, John. What big eyes you have. I had no idea they could stretch so wide. What a hopeful sign,” he breathed, and pulled the latex glove onto his right hand with a snap. Then he tugged the ends high up on his arm
In answer, John reached into his pocket, withdrew his phone, and Sherlock lifted his own mobile to his ear. “You’re right, John, there’s no need to shout, is there? Modern technology is at our fingertips,” he said lightly.
“Have the car ready,” he said to his lackey. “We’re going home.”
John was trembling with emotion, and with the effort of holding perfectly still. Finally he roared, “Come on!!”
Behind him, Sherlock spoke quietly, but with warning steel entering his voice, “Whenever you make me wait, I wonder if you’re teasing me. Challenging me to greater heights to prove my mastery over you.”
“You come home with me and resume your rightful place as the focus of all my amorous impulses, including those you occasionally object to. And you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I will risk absolutely anything to keep you.” Sherlock finished, eyes still riveted on John.
Some things had to be done by chance, by whim, trusting in luck, John felt. So he simply decided that he would stay in Speedy’s till it closed at 11pm. Then he would don the hat and coat he’d swapped his own for from the homeless chap several blocks away-- John had looked for the cleanest beggar he could find-- and calmly walk out of Speedy’s, down the sidewalk, and go in search of the nearest homeless shelter he could find. And in the morning (if morning came and he was still free) he would set about contacting the bank where his pension was deposited and begin the process of re-acquiring access to his funds.
His knuckles turned red, fresh cuts were observed as John growled at himself. Glaring at the dealer who was shouting, John couldn’t understand what he said.
Sherlock’s eyes were crystalized with tears, too, from all the insane laughter, as he tried to regain his composure.
wining and dining, or are you also wooing and doing?” The therapist asked.
“I love you,” John whispered, his eyes still locked onto Sherlock’s.
-<0>-
John’s other hand took Sherlock’s face in his hand.
Sherlock watched,
Sherlock marveled at the patience of John Watson. The man who married him. He could sense everything John was pouring into his little endeavor of kissing. Content, Sherlock let him shower him with affection.
“No, John,” Sherlock repeated, standing at the fireplace where a bag full of ornaments was laying, agitated towards John’s revolting choice of colour for the already rainbow-like tree. “According to colour theory, Green and orange don’t go well together, this tree will tur-“
The raven was perched on his armchair fast asleep.
And with a nod from John, they started attacking each room as they slowly progressed forwards. Their backs were facing the entrance of the hospital, with the emergency door close to the entrance, the killer was at a dead end.
As quick as he attacked the dealer, he got up from his position and continued walking, hoping to save his dignity from the wondering eyes of the homeless after breaking apart so openly.
As John sat down on his chair, he grabbed the bottle of wine and poured himself another one. He was already half-drunken and sleepy, yet the wine had tasted good, and on a fine night like this, he planned to enjoy it.
for Sherlock.
“My anchor in this abysmal madness.”
It was all a fast blur. The dealer struggling underneath him, but with one swift movement, John pinned him. And with another movement, he was crying out in pain. And then John unleashed his anger, using the dealer as his punching bag.
He came too late.
And here was John, standing outside the kitchen, completely mesmerized by the scene before him, half-hidden half obvious, his once shocked face now carried a smile,
With a swift motion, Sherlock flipped John on his back, discarding his own insulting pants. His hand found John’s chest, flushed with colour, and he claimed John’s mouth with his, just as his cock aligned with John’s.
“Watson!” Piped in Rosie excitedly over from her seat on Molly’s lap, watching the two flatmates with a cheeky expression.
Sherlock had said before he looked away and a bit of color appeared on his cheeks.
“As do I, John. I love you.” Sherlock answered with a whisper, a soft smile taking up the corners of his lips.
I wanted Sherlock to see Rosie right when she was born. I wanted him to watch her first steps alongside me. I wanted him to hear her first words.
So he experimented. He tried changing. He tried everything from changing the coffee brand and mug to new activities each week as shooting ranges, he even got back to rugby.
“Said that being the only two diners for the night at Araki sounded boring –
The sky a dark grey, the clouds contrast against it with it’s white cotton-like majesty. Debris flies through the air causing a thick fog visible beyond the hill, where the operation took place.
He wondered if Sherlock could play him as well as he played his violin.
But still, it was there.
“Bossy git,” John started rocking just as Sherlock clashed his mouth to his, gentle yet hungry for more, tongues swirling together.
He sits down beside her, his eyes trained on a set of vultures, their beaks picking at them, feeding on the dead.
There was only a grotesque silence.
A short sigh escaped from his therapist as she tilted her head ever so slightly, never breaking eye contact.
But there was…
She makes her way to the small cliff overseeing the collapsed buildings, blown cars and bombed land. The ground painted red beneath and around the motionless Austrians' bodies.
He held sherlock tight against him, his chin against the wet curls. The rain cried with him as it poured harder. His sounds muffled by it.
“You’re thinking.”
Thomas’ friend smiled at the answer.
John sighed as Sherlock paced the room.
So engrossed in his thoughts, he nearly missed the entrance to Scotland Yard. He stopped in front of the window and peeked inside. Just as the law never sleeps, neither did the policemen. He sighed and steeled himself before going inside of the building. He was met with several policemen walking alongside him, having discussions about their recent arrests and their personal lives. One of them had just had their first child, Sherlock overheard. There were miscellaneous drunks and thieves in some of the prison cells. Two of the criminals were in the cell together. One of them was passed out, the bottle lazily gripped in his hand, and the other, a thief judging by the way he checked his cell mate's sack, was disappointed that the old drunk had nothing of value.
“And how might I help you, young gentleman?”
“Sherlock. Sherlock Holmes.”
“Open the window then. Lord knows this room could use a good airing out.” John walked over to the window and opened it. He turned to Sherlock, searching for a sign of relief, but there remained that same uncomfortable look. He shook his head, “This is not what I need.”
Sherlock noticed that John saw right through him, would he leave him be was the question. He let out a short sigh when he felt the covers rise and John’s warm body snuggled into his. He gave him the usual kisses goodnight, and said nothing more on Sherlock’s mood. Sherlock settled into the bed even more as he realized that this was going to be one of his bad nights. They hadn’t happened for so long, he truly thought that they were done with him. That he would be able to rest in peace, but he was wrong, it seemed. He thought of Mycroft, he thought of Mrs. Hudson, he thought of the man upstairs, he thought of John. The hardest feat tonight was trying not to break down in front of John altogether. He deserved his rest and not more of Sherlock’s crying and tears.
“Carlton Powers?” The words were nearly a whisper.
The way John’s chest heaved, his eyes became hysterical, he was scared, confused, but it had nothing to do with the kidnapping.
“So I see.” Sherlock replied indignantly.
“I came up for further inspections but the flat was vacant. Where have you been?”
Sherlock stiffened. It rained that night, and all be could think of was Mycroft’s coffin, and how no one cared that he was alone in the world. It was bad on some nights, Sherlock tried to block it out, the flashes of his wake, the people who sat huddled together on the other side and whispered amongst each other while Sherlock held back tears. On these nights Sherlock would cry until he fell asleep or until when he had simply dehydrated himself to the point where the tears stopped flowing.
The body was of a white pallor, but John imagined the skin would have a natural peach tone if blood were to fill the still empty cavities within. He could recount the night when he was sent to the cemetery to do what Sherlock had all that time ago. Seeing as how Moriarty would not want a man of neither his nor Sherlock’s build, he laboured to find body parts that would impress the madman, but not overpower the two of them were he to become violent. Were he alive, he would be the picture of health and considerably handsome. His features were rough, but complementary; John could picture those thin lips pulling up into a smile and found the image quite dashing. A likely ancestry would be German, or possibly even Roman going by the strong bridge of his nose.
Irish. Sherlock had not been able to hear it at first. It suited him.
He turned the page and caught a glance at John, who looked absolutely enthralled with the book itself. He would run his finger along the page, and at times, it would prevent Sherlock from continuing with the story, much to John’s dismay. Sherlock would only smile and tell him that he was unable to continue if John would not move his finger. Then, while Sherlock read the words aloud, John would stare into his eyes with the most sincere adoration that a person could ever feel for another. Sherlock often felt his cheeks growing hot, signaling the growing blush that tinted his pale skin. He was thankful for the fact that John was ignorant when it came to humanity, he would hate to have to explain his foolishness. John was the only one to give Sherlock such a soft look. He was not used to such affection.
John’s seen them now. The other people that lurked outside. He’s seen the ones who were wicked and wanted nothing more than to hurt people who’ve done nothing wrong, and he’s seen one of the people who helps others. From such a short view of the outside world, what did John make of it all? Would he still want to accompany Sherlock on those days where he would have to venture outside? It was moments like this where Sherlock wondered just what went on in the other man’s head. John dropped another blood-soaked rag onto the tray. He placed another bandage on the cleaned cut.
“It is a possibility. You extended your arms, he is mirroring you. Perhaps he is a faster learner than I presumed.”
“Surely Scotland Yard did not believe such lies.”
John nodded and said, “We even decided on spending the night, just to make sure that Sebastian will settle in nicely. He’ll set a bed up in our room for the night, so you need not make up a guest room.”
John’s smile widened at the sound of Sherlock’s voice. He was across from him and Sherlock was able to see everything on John - All the bruises, the dried blood, the rope burns. Sherlock grimaced at the wounds John sported.
Sebastian returned to their temporary home. He stepped into the living area to find Thomas and Moriarty sitting in their respective chairs smoking cigars and sipping what he thought was whiskey. He hoped that they would let him pass, that they would not make him drink that liquid that burnt his throat, or the cigar that made him cough and feel ill for smoking it.
Sherlock’s eyes never left Sebastian as he shook his head and responded, “Far from it, actually.”
They parted for just a moment to work their bottoms off, Sherlock grabbing a tin of Vaseline from from under his mattress.
It was almost as if John felt Sherlock’s eyes on him, he turned to face him with the same smile on his face.
He shook his head and returned to the present. The box was half-empty and John stood by his side watching. There was the broken magnifying glass that Sherlock thought Mycroft had gotten rid of, the book that Sherlock soaked in the pond at the park, and other miscellaneous items that Mycroft was too stubborn to toss.
“They did not! How have you gotten to be such a clever lad?”
He offered the egg to John who opened his mouth and ate it. Sherlock watched with a soft expression as John ate the small portion of egg with a look of fascination and delight.
John slid the robe onto him with the slightest movements. He was only ever that gentle with him, much the same way John was with Sherlock. John finished tying the sash around his waist, a smile directed at the creation, while Sherlock watched with arms wrapped around himself.
“Oh, God, John. I ca-cannot hold on much longer,” Sherlock had the mind to warn, breath hot against John’s ear.
John knew that he should have let Sherlock explain himself, but he feared that it would not have come out as delicately as John had made it. He loved Sherlock dearly and he wanted Sebastian to understand why. Sebastian smiled, “He is a good man, John. You need not tell me.”
“I tell you, they were locked up.” Thomas leant forward. The restaurant they were in was relatively quiet and Thomas would hate to be the one to disturb the peace.
“It is not a matter of obligation, Sherlock. I enjoy helping you, even more so since you have not had a good time of it.”
Sherlock released his hands and said, “Look at the clouds, John. They are grey but their hue is much darker, thus signaling that we are to experience a storm, perhaps the storm of the year. With thunder comes lighting and I have, while you were occupied down here, created a means of conducting the electricity into the body, which in turn will provide him with life!”
“I was only going to review our notes, John.”
Thomas put his hands on his face, the mere mention of the memory brought on the headache he experienced. His friend placed a hand on his shoulder.
“Were we successful?”
“Apologies, I had not noticed.” Sherlock would not have apologized had it been any other day, but he was in too joyous of a mood. He paid the driver and watched as the horse carted the cab away. With a wide smile on his face, he looked up at the window of his flat, John was not there. He started to walk over to the door when he was stopped by a, “Oi, freak!”
Sebastian walked down the stairs with a suitcase and a wide smile on his face.
John looked up at the clock and furrowed his brows. “Do you suppose Sebastian will stop off here? He did say that he will be back come this evening.”
“But...how is it that you’ve come to Switzerland? Where is Moriarty? Thomas?”
Mrs. Hudson halted her cleaning and turned to face her young master. She got a good look at him, and saw how his eyes seemed colorless. There was no emotion, they reminded her of a lake frozen over to its depths. Her eyes teared as she realized that the face Sherlock wore was the face of a man who wished for death. She clasped her hands together.
“I do not tire of the fire, Sherlock. I quite like it, with its bright flames that threaten to burn my skin. I know you do not like me straying so close to the fire, but I cannot help it. I enjoy the peril that has been thrust upon me.”
“Is it any good?” He sounded exhausted and Sherlock bit his lip.
“I am...words cannot convey how truly apologetic I am, John.”
Sherlock had nearly forgotten about the lightning outside so when the next bolt shot out of the sky, he jumped. The lightning was so close to him that, for a moment, he wondered if he might have been struck by it. He almost wished for the next bolt to come crashing through the window and leave him dead. It would be accidental, he thought. He would have no control over it, a natural phenomenon. He wondered if it hurt; surely it would not be painless, to have that amount of electricity come into your body, stimulating every sense, every nerve. Sherlock imagined it clearly, he would roll over and attempt to sleep again, but then his window would break, littering the floor with the crystal shards. He wouldn’t even see it coming. He would seize in agony before he would die. He hated himself for even thinking of such twisted hypotheticals.
“Oh John, I am an awful man, redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your love. You, it is always you...you keep me right…”
“Sebastian! Sebastian come along now, we must be off.”
Sherlock jerked his hand away and shot up from the couch as if he had seen the face of the Devil himself. He startled John with his sudden movement, the man staring up at him wide-eyed.
“Sebastian,” Moriarty began once again, a malicious smirk pulling a corner of his lip, “where are you off to?”
“What will I do with money?” The tone that he asked it in, childish, scared, excited. It tugged at her heartstrings and she almost blurted out that she would pay him right now. But he needed to earn his keep just as everyone else did.
Sebastian nodded, “I am to obey, and I never do. I do not like him, John, not at all.”
“I understand that you are hurting, but that does not give you ample reason to lash out at your caretaker. I have only known her a short while, but in that period I have witnessed the way you allow yourself to be at peace when you are near her, your eyes, they brighten to rival that of the sun whenever she presents you with a cup of tea. You are unguarded in her presence, Sherlock, and you are only ever that way when you are with me.”
“If I’ve a guess, your appetite has returned?”
“You would have no wound had I not been such a fool. I was distracted, I was not able to stop them, Sherlock-”
“Thank you, John, but I only inquired because everything is set in place to begin such an act. We are both nude, I daresay that we are aroused, you could have begun the process on your own.”
He missed them.
John frowned at how sad Sherlock sounded to admit such a thing. Sherlock could not stand to look John in the eyes. He thought he was the reason for Sherlock’s unhappiness, as if Sherlock had not harbored such self-deprecation for years, as if Mycroft did not contribute to the self-hatred. John was innocent in this, his only crime was being created. John’s love for him surpassed any other love that he knew, perhaps that was because this was the only love that Sherlock knew. John was everything he could ask for and more. He treated Sherlock with such kindness, which he was unaccustomed to. John treated Sherlock as is according for a human being.
“Sherlock?”
“Information, if you will oblige me.”
He flashed a melancholic smile.
Sherlock sank into the wooden chair and pushed down the feeling of being reduced to the clients that the Inspector had to deal with every day. Lestrade folded his hands on the table and stared at Sherlock with that loathsome smile on. What did he want from Sherlock? Did he want him to crack and tell him everything? Tell him about Mycroft, tell him about John, about Sebastian, and how that madman Moriarty had come to know him? He would not lower himself to such a shameful display in front of a man he barely knew.
“Whatever you see fit, Sebastian.” John replied. Mrs. Hudson sighed and nodded. “The boy is free to stay, so long as I get to see you lot more often.”
John’s smile remained, Sherlock knew that he loved it when they took playful jabs at one another.
Mycroft’s voice rang in his head. He was stern and cold this time, not like the dream he had before where Mycroft smiled and told Sherlock sweet nothings. He remembered that day, that discussion, no, that lecture that Mycroft had given him. It was his fault, he had been stupid and careless, Mycroft was right. He had been an idiot that day, and he shudders to think what would have happened if his elder brother was not present.
He looked over at the window, searching but not seeing.  With a gasp of breath he realized what needed to be done in order for his dream to become a reality. He had to go to a graveyard.
“I set out for Baker Street that same night, after appointing Mrs. Hudson as caretaker of the manor. It was here that I assembled your body after spending many sleepless nights acquiring the notes and plans to construct you. The process took weeks, perhaps months, I had spent much of that time ill and bereaved.”
Sherlock moved closer to John and asked, “Would you care to join me, John?”
“John.”
“Where, exactly?”
He had no right to fall so deeply in love with John. He knew that nothing good would come of it, yet he pursued the relationship anyway. And now look, he was almost certain that things would never be the same between them again - it would become too awkward, to tense. They would merely sit together for meals and perhaps, occasionally, they would mutter the polite “good morning” and “goodnight”. Why did he leave? He wanted nothing more for John to touch him the way he had and to be kissed the way John kissed him. He wanted to be loved the way John loved him.
“I am off now, John.”
“Are you alright?”
“What else could have forced my heart into its rhythm? You yourself have claimed that I laid unmoving for some days before you...forfeited me.”
Sherlock gave a curt nod. She smiled and led him to the dining room. The table seated multiple people but it was only Sherlock who would dine there now. He struggled to not look at Mycroft’s empty chair. He took his seat and watched as Mrs. Hudson set his plate in front of him.
“So then how shall this play out?”
“Hold!”
“I...I was visiting my brother.”
Sherlock sighed, “It would appear so Mrs. Hudson. I would prefer if he were left to rest. The day was long.”
“Hold on! Tell me, have you encountered any.... exciting clients as of late?”
John was unsure, but the sound that Sherlock gave was something between a sob and a cough. What a miserable creature he had become. John took his seat at the edge of the bed, careful to avoid the puddle of Sherlock’s regurgitation. As he suspected, it was nothing more than bile, seeing as though Sherlock refused to ingest anything, not even tea. John shook his head and rested a hand on Sherlock’s clammy back. The man was running a fever, he could tell that much.
“John, thank the heavens for John.” She smiled and Sherlock felt the tension in his body bubble away.
Sherlock set his teacup down.
“Hush now, boy. You’ve nothing to fear, I only ask that you act carefully.”
Sherlock sighed. He did not want to take John out with him but he had to be sure that the clothes fit. He brought a finite amount of money with him to Baker Street and he did not want to see it wasted on ill-fitting clothes. He gave John a smirk.
Sherlock was ever the fool. He did it again. He broke Mycroft’s heart twice-over. It was Mycroft who saved him from the streets when he nearly overdosed in some dilapidated remnant of a house. There were no tears this time, no pity or remorse. There was only his brother’s cold gaze, and even colder demeanor. He instructed Mrs. Hudson to watch over Sherlock and nothing more. To Sherlock, no time had ever been so lonely than the months where his brother refused to speak to him. They did not hurt together, as he had promised him, but he knew he’d broken the promise first.
John shrugged and picked up the empty plate. As he turned to head into the kitchen, he said, “I’ll prepare your bath and then you will have a cup of tea.”
“So, then you are not in need of air. Is it your wrist? Is it bothering you? Come let me have a look. I fear I was a bit overzealous, but, what is done is done.”
Without warning, John moved up and pressed his lips against Sherlock’s own. The shorter man had rose a little from his spot on the floor, whereas Sherlock never moved. He had paused under the touch of John’s lips for just a moment as every reason not to continue berated his mind. He threw his inhibitions to the wind and kissed back. Sherlock had practically melted. He leaned forward with his entire body, his hands going to John’s broad shoulders as the the other man held his waist. There was the insistent thought to stop immediately, to tell John that this was forbidden and that what he sought would be unobtainable. To be with Sherlock was a death sentence but for a second Sherlock believed the price of death was worth the passion they were now sharing. John furthered the kiss, tongue probing at Sherlock’s lips until he parted them to allow John inside.
“I’ve got you John, do not fret.”
Sherlock’s eyes trailed up John’s body until their eyes met. John awaited his response.
“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
“Do you mean that they have left the country and you all by your lonesome?”
Sherlock turned to face the window, he could see John’s curious face in the reflection.
“Mr. Holmes- you are to arrive at this address.”
He refused to acknowledge the small smile on the Detective Inspector’s face as he walked away. Sherlock opened the door and stepped inside the building, shutting the door behind him. John had not not waited for him as he usually did, instead having gone inside the flat already. When Sherlock finally made his way up the stairs, he found John sitting in the armchair, his head was propped upon his arm and his body slumped as if it were too heavy for him to support. He looked annoyed, angry, crestfallen. Sherlock went to take his coat off and hung it up. John did not even utter a word. He sat down in the chair opposite John’s and stared at him. He did not know how much time had passed until he heard his companion’s voice.
“Let’s go.”
“My dear Watson, I would prefer it if you would voice your opinions. You have been far too silent for my liking. And I am sure you are aware to what I am referring to.”
“She was only trying to help.”
“I’ve not a clue, nor do I care to find out. Off we go!”
“No, the man does enjoy his sleep, however. Today may be a day where I find a way to while away the time.”
“John, you know I am a man who does not deserve such attentions. You may think of me as remarkable now but you have seen little of this world.”
“Is this all? You’ll pardon me for inquiring about this man with such fervor. He is a family friend and I only want the best for him. To hear that he has been subject to London’s Underworld in such a way is very upsetting. I shall take my leave now, if that is alright.”
He blinked away the tears that were begging to be shed and resumed his mission. He found a suitable match, the dirt of the grave still fresh. The man’s name was Thomas, he died of syphilis, at only thirty years of age. Sherlock spared a few moments of silence before he began digging. While he was busy at work, a couple began walking down the street when they spotted Sherlock shoveling away the dirt. The woman stopped the man who was busy chugging his whiskey.
It would all come to an end wouldn’t it?
“It was Banville that told me of his relationship to Mycroft and yourself, and it is Banville that helped me in capturing you.”
“What are you doing here? You know that Moriarty will surely have your head for this.”
“You did not use your brother as the subject?” John seemed to relax a fraction while listening to Sherlock’s tragic tale. Would he forgive him after? That was all Sherlock wanted from John - forgiveness and love. If John desired to make love to him, then Sherlock would not shy away from him this time.
He rose abruptly and held his hat underneath his arm once more. He didn’t look at Thomas as he shuffled past him. His pace quickened even more as he passed the hateful group of three. He tried to ignore their laughs and cold stares. His yearning for Mycroft had been emphasized even more by their words - Mycroft would have never allowed such chatter to continue. He hailed over a coachman as a carriage came into view. The driver stopped and looked down at him.
The stranger flashed a smile that made Sherlock shiver.
The glimmer of hope in his eyes was too much for Sherlock to bear.
Sherlock nodded.
“You must forgive me, I’ve...I was not myself after the funeral.”
Sherlock could not help but blush at the situation he was thrust into. He was sure that he smelled quite rank, due to his sweat-soaked clothes, but John was being polite about it. He wanted to tell John that it was alright, that he did not have to undress him as if he were an invalid, or a child incapable of undressing himself. He was ill, but he was not incapable.
“You just missed Sherlock, have you bumped into him during your travel here?” Sebastian could not stand to look John in the eye and instead looked to the floor. He shook his head. He was terrible, he was a horrible person for lying to him! John’s fingers went under his chin so that they could be meet his again.
“John!”
“It cannot be helped then. Fear not, dear brother, I shall not interfere with your rest as I have assured you before. My man needs limbs, limbs that the dead have no use for. I will journey to the cemetery at nightfall for fear of wandering eyes should I venture there now. There, I will obtain the necessary items to construct his body.”
She smirked and shook her head. She waited for Sherlock to take his first bite of the ham before she struck up another conversation.
“Now John, tell me, did you really grab the small of Sherlock’s back? This is what Banville has relayed to me.”
He wanted nothing more than to shut his mind off. Always racing, always ridiculing him - tearing him apart as he lay prone under the constant barrage. He wiped at his eyes furiously although the movements tugged at his injuries and made him hiss. He had cried in front of John, why would he do such an idiotic thing?
Their bedroom door slammed into the frame after a hard prod of John’s foot but neither men cared. The moment they were in the room with the bed but a few feet away, the two men came together once more. Sherlock’s arms looped tight around John’s neck while the other man held him close around the waist.
John placed a hand on his head and shook it. “This cannot be, you...you are gone from me. You are but a figment of my mind. I--I must away.”
“Can you move? If so, try to move your leg.”
With Sherlock’s head thrown back, his throat was a perfect stretch of bare skin upon which John pressed his lips. He licked and nibbled, sucked to leave beautiful blooms of red behind. His lips trailed downwards through the soft hairs that dusted across Sherlock’s chest. He rubbed at one nipple between his fingers, watching Sherlock keen into the touch, and decided it would be valuable knowledge to see how the bundle of tissue felt under his tongue.
Sherlock scoffed. “You never really are, are you?” He mumbled. God, he had done it again. He was being short with John and unrightly so. John did not seem affected in the slightest, but Sherlock knew that he was only being polite. He would lose John too, at this rate.
“I am alright, John.”
“Send for a doctor, there is no need for you to waste your efforts on me.”
Both were breathing hard as their wide eyes met. Though brief, returning to the sound of the rain beating against the panes seemed quiet compared to what had just happened
“Let us agree to forget that rather unsavory interaction and begin anew.”
“And what do you intend to do if I allow this?”
Remember, my new tumblr name is
“Drinking again?”
“I... I could not stand to be so far. I snuck away from Moriarty and have come here.”
Soon, John was pushing his finger inside, twisting it to coat the inner rim with the substance as well.
“This is a tale that I do not wish to hear.”
When the tub was full, John returned to the kitchen where Sherlock was still at the table, gaze frozen upon something and his brows furrowed. John assumed the man upstairs was on his mind but soon those tired viridian eyes turned to him and John read guilt in their flicker. He smiled and dropped down to one knee before the man, finding his hands.
“You came to kill me? That is rich, just rich indeed Mr. Holmes. My, you sound like your brother. I wonder what he would think of it all. You and I, standing here, dangerously close to the edge, talking about plans of death.”
John smiled one of those smiles that made Sherlock positively weak. Those thoughts began swimming through his mind again. He yearned for John, he pined for him, but he could not do that to him. He could not defile John.
Sherlock’s cheeks grew dark with a blush, holding the tin like a precious item in his large hands. “Y-You see, although I have not been with anyone, I have fantasized and...And, before you, I would...I would pleasure myself. This, well, makes it easier.”
John nodded.
Sebastian gulped, “It is horrid of me to wish such a thing on a person, but he is bad, and he has to die.”
Gregory looked puzzled. “Pardon?”
John only smirked and pressed a gentle kiss to Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock snorted at his own question.
“Then you leave this to me,” He said to Sherlock, voice unyielding. His next words were to the new man, “My name is John. John Watson.”
Sherlock breathed out a pitiful chuckle. “It will always be the two of us against the world, will it not?”
“Shite,” The two breathed collectively. Anderson clutched the bars tighter. They’d heard about Mycroft Holmes. He was not a forgiving man, especially to those that harmed his little brother.
“What will happen then? If we do not meet his deadline, what shall become of us?”
John gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze and they lay together in the bed saying nothing. John focused his attention on Sebastian, whereas Sherlock kissed every inch of John’s upper-body as a reminder that they had made it.
A part of him knew such words were foolish. John had made it clear time and again that he loved him, that he would stay, and Sherlock still could not believe him. Some days it was easier to accept his affection and even reciprocate, but when it came to moments of gravity such as this, self doubt won over rationality.
“John...John you mustn’t do this.”
Sherlock turned to face the Inspector with feigned geniality. Had he come any time other than now, everything would have been alright.
“Might I inquire about something, John?”
“I must say, I was rather nervous when my man struck you. There was blood and,” He stopped to put on a disgusted expression,” it was an absolute mess.”
“Freak.” Sherlock turned to see none other than Sally Donovan staring at him with the meanest scowl she could muster. She was without her...suitor? Husband? Lover?
“What say you, John?”
Sherlock assisted with the buttons until he could tug the shirttails from his trousers and toss it to the floor. He immediately looked down to John’s bare chest, to the stitches that still marked the connection of limbs.
“You were...created in my laboratory...months ago.”
“The victim you attacked, what happened to him?”
“That very one.”
Sherlock sighed and set his hands down on the table.
“What a fool I am! The body! Body parts are needed to create a human. How can I even acquire such items?”
He tried to stop the tears but to no avail. It was all too painful for him. He did not want to be reminded of his social status; rich he was, intelligent yes, but friends, social circles, he had none. He was to be reminded of it at all times that no one would ever care for a man like him. He was strange, he was cold, and he was a freak.
“John?”
“Well, I’ve other duties to tend to. Such is the life of a caretaker!”
Sherlock pondered for a moment. He should file a complaint, report harassment from professor Moriarty, but then that would result in him having to provide the Yard with every sordid detail of his life, and something told him that the police would no doubt find him guilty rather than the professor. Sherlock shook his head. How would he get Lestrade to tell him without asking outright?
Anderson clearly wasn’t interested in what Sherlock was doing, he tried to pull Sally along so that they could continue home.
“Do tie Mr. Holmes up as well, we must do our best to make him feel comfortable.”
“Oh my lord! Come in! Come in please!” She moved out of the way, only pausing to give the two wet kisses on their cheeks. She shut the door and escorted them to the living area. They took their seats and she gaped at the sight of them.
John picked his plate up and carried it to the kitchen, leaving Sherlock alone at the table. It was while John was cleaning his dish that Sherlock realized John was only clad in the robe that was given to him his first night in the flat. Sherlock groaned, he had completely neglected to bestow John with proper clothing. It was not as if John was going to be outside anytime soon, he needed to learn a bit more before he was ready for the outside world.
This brought Sherlock immense pleasure to see while also reminding him to set out extra blankets for John. He yawned and settled further into the bed until Sherlock felt arms snaking around his waist. He did not want to move, he could not risk John’s arms leaving their current position. He even found himself moving in closer towards John, not stopping until he felt the soft skin of John’s chest pressed against his cheek.
“My friend, Inspector Lestrade, informed me of your talk with Sir Thomas Banville.”
“That was my caretaker, Mrs. Hudson. She has written to me. My brother’s belongings have been retrieved from one of his many offices.”
John wanted to tend to Sherlock, but the creation was of the highest importance at the moment, sprained wrist be damned. John turned to face their newest occupant of the flat with apprehension, in case he displayed the intent to attack one of them again. Sherlock had no chance of matching his strength, but John, however, could. John placed his hands in the air to prove that he was not the enemy. Similar as to how Sherlock interacted with John on the night they first met.
John’s leg started to shake and his hand rested under his chin as Sherlock spoke.
“You’ll find no complaint from me. I should like to join you in your trip to this manor.”
“Aside from my throat burning with the flames of Hell, I believe I am...well enough.”
“Rubbish.”
“He knew.”
“Your reading and vocabulary has gotten considerably better since our first encounter, John. I am proud.”
“Sherlock?”
John exhaled and nodded.
He felt the tears welling in his eyes again, to cry twice in one night, how pathetic he was. He was not prone to such sentiment. Mycroft abhorred it. He could remember every instance where Mycroft scolded him for crying over such menial events, like the time the stray cat that wandered into their yard was trampled by the horses of a hansom cab. Sherlock cried and cried, and Mycroft scowled and told him that he was a fool for loving a cat that only wanted him for food. When Sherlock was a child he loved everything and everyone, and Mycroft always told him that he was wrong for it. All Sherlock knew was Mycroft, until Mycroft decided to let Sherlock meet other children his age.
“However, that seems too easy. And we are so far from London.” Sherlock exhaled at the statement. “I decided that I owe you a fall.”
“The only likely reason for my reaching this point would be the lightning bolt that struck dangerously near the flat as you’ve described.”
“He would have me believe that it was his brother’s death, but I reckon he was only lonely and dare I say envious that you doted on me so.”
“What is the matter? You look dreadful. Sebastian, what is he doing to you?”
“Continue, please.”
“What’s wrong?”
“Please, see reason. You are an intelligent man and I am sure you understand better than I why she took great pains to conceal this from you. Do you not notice how it hurts you, Sherlock? It pains me to see you tormented so. I do not know your brother, I have not been given the opportunity to, however, I understand the extent to which you miss him. I have not been witness to how you were after his passing but Mrs. Hudson has. Bear her no ill will, she was protecting you, as you say she was, but it was well-meant.”
Sherlock folded his hands in his lap. “Mrs. Hudson we must ask a favor of you.”
When he awoke in the morning, he found John staring at him with the warmest of smiles on his face. He reached over and moved some of the dark curls that covered Sherlock’s forehead and let out a sigh.
“This sounds dire. Are we out of milk, by chance?”
“Promise you what?”
John smiled and kissed him hard first, but then they became progressively lighter until they stopped altogether. “There is no Watson without Holmes.”
Sherlock swallowed the piece of sandwich and nodded.
John would want to know where he’d been. When he finally returns to Baker Street, John will be sat at the table, with breakfast for the two of them, sipping a cup of tea and glaring at Sherlock. He would press him, ask him over and over where he’d gone, and why he was not brought along. Sherlock would have to lie, say that he had went for the morning paper, but then he would have to actually return with the morning paper.
“What? Am I in the wrong?”
John did not respond, he only glared at the man as they walked away, his hand resting on the small of Sherlock’s back.
“Do I?”
He had to eat. At least toast and tea. He owed it to his brother to attempt sustaining himself
Sherlock blinked twice and stared at John with a hint of confusion on his face. How long had John been talking, how long had he not been listening? Immediately, Sherlock nodded and watched as John disposed of the bits of ham and toast that Sherlock did not touch. Sherlock heard John talking once more about how little Sherlock ate, and what the normal amount of food was for him to be eating in a day. It all sounded like a jumbled mess to the distracted man who absentmindedly sipped away at his tea.
She jumped so high her feet left the floor. She spun to face him with a bewildered look in her eyes.
John only rubbed his hand with the pad of his thumb. Sherlock could admit John was good at distracting him, even when their very lives depended on the completion of Moriarty’s man. Sherlock stood up and said, “John, you understand the importance of this, we must get this done.”
Sherlock propped John up so that his knees would not scrape against the tiles. After a pregnant pause, Sherlock finally spoke again.
The couple grew silent. Thomas shook his head.
Sherlock was met with disapproval from his companion.
“He sent you here to distract me while he went off with Moriarty. That stubborn fool!”
“Do you think, Mycroft, that he also has the heart of the ideal human? The soul of the ideal human? Is he truly the perfect man? Can one even create such a thing?”
“I would like some air.”
“Aye.”
“That day I had asked about those noises coming from your room. I know that you’ve spent many a night weeping alone in there. I only wished that I could comfort you in those moments, but what could I offer you? I know nothing of your struggles, and I did not want to intrude. What can I do, Sherlock, to help you?
“The storm and the lightning.”
“I am sorry to hear that, Sherlock. Truly. I was not aware that your relationship with her was weakened.”
“Any enemy of yours is an enemy of mine, Sherlock! Do not be daft, do not  dare be selfish now, not after all we have been through. We will face Moriarty together, and if we must, we will die together.” John’s tone was gravelly and he was now holding Sherlock’s face in his warm hands. His own was expression was hardened, but his eyes held the anger, the love, the compassion, that Sherlock desperately sought.
-<0>-
“Mmmm,” Sherlock hummed as he slightly stirred in John’s arms.
John’s an utter arsehole of a boss. A monster. Inhuman. Inhumane. The devil himself. And he knows it. Heard it confirmed behind his back many a time.
“John!” Sherlock halted then shouted, “Focus!”
London’s streets were busy as per usual.
John caught a glimpse of a pale collarbone against velvet.
He didn’t make it in time.
The sun keeps awakening with each passing second, a new day begins, a new mission awaits.
John executed a cry followed by a string of curses as his right leg hit an operating table smeared with deep red liquid, blood, with what looked like a mix of medical equipment and torture devices as he rounded a corner. A horror look overtook him, thinking about what the patients admitted here had to go through.
Absorbing in the scene playing out before him.
And the events that followed were unbelievable. John had learned a whole deal of things, including that the man’s profession had a name.“A consulting detective, he said. The only one in the world.” The man had said it in such arrogance, proud of his profession as they exited the crime scene.
John’s thoughts were interrupted as Sherlock’s flawless playing stopped, setting his violin back in its case as a mother would place a sleeping child in a cot, with great gentle care.
Sherlock sat between them, their cocks trapped between them as John hooked his legs on Sherlock, who manifested lube out of thin air to John. He applied lube into himself, stroked himself a few times as John’s hands gripped the sheets.
Beating viscously against Sherlock’s body, as if trying to escape a cage. Whether it was betraying Sherlock’s commands or obeying it, John didn’t know.
He produces another cigarette, lights it, and hands it to The Woman.
Heat pooled in his groin as Sherlock caught sight of John’s eyes when they broke apart need and want and something wild etched themselves onto John’s face.
Sherlock landed on the floor with a thud, his expression that of disapproval.
A gunshot sound echoed through the hospital.
They came home late last night after solving a demanding case and crashed asleep the moment they arrived at their bedroom. John’s dreams were rather explicit in nature fueled by Sherlock’s clever mouth, shooting deductions, and looking damn gorgeous in his tight jeans.
“Sherlock, you git! Why did you do that?” John’s words echoed in his ears.
The killer had lounged onto John, taking away his gun.
No more violin melodies I wasn’t aware of before he faked his suicide that would calm me after a nightmare.
And so here he was. Attempting to once again scrap his life together using professional help.
The blood trails stopped at a door. There were three possible outcomes. One, the killer escaped through the window which was highly unlikely as all the windows completely sealed. Two, he is in there, but unarmed. And three, he is armed with a deadly weapon.
She sits down, her legs dangle over the edge.
“Sherlo…I’m going to…” John called out urgently, he could feel his balls, he was about to come in the hands of one Sherlock Holmes.
John doesn’t want to break Sherlock’s trust, nor ruin what they have. And so whatever this…..impulse is, will have to go to the rubbish.

“No, Captain Watson,” the killer spoke familiarly, “I’m sure Lieutenant Philips would have disagreed with your choice of words.” A smile formed on the man’s face. Wide and showing teeth. Too wide. Too white. It resembled an unhuman smile that haunted children's nights.
It doesn’t fit his usual style. The watch is rectangle, contrary to Sherlock's liking of round watches. And furthermore it does look rather familiar, and not because she has seen the detective wearing it before.
Naggin at him.
“My, John,” panted Sherlock between kissing, his hips moving faster and fast. He continued down John’s chest, finding his nipples and fondling them, teasing them with his tongue and teeth, the room filled with moans and groans of pleasure, with bodies slamming together.
His throat was tight as he spoke. “I love you.”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, as casual as ever. “Now, take over from me, since Watson has decided to turn this into her playground,” Sherlock gestured to the kitchen and its disastrous state with a disgusted disapproving look, and then indicated his state, “I need to wash.”
“Getting there,” John says, then frowns and admits, “I think. I hope. God this is miserable; not being sure.”
and he wants to do it again.
John and the killer were belabouring with fits, while Sherlock still struggled to get away from the bulky nurse. After a few moments, he deduced the nurse recently had appendix surgery and with his elbow threw a blow at his side. The nurse yelled and sherlock gave him a front kick, throwing him outside the room.
He had walked out from another brothel, disguised as another fuckboy. Fists formed, his fingernails digging into his palm’s flesh as he walked briskly. His hoodie hiding most of his face which carried an expression of pure disgust.
The first day of Christmas went smoothly. John and Rosie went out for some events, built a snowman at the nearby park, and Sherlock even accompanied them.
John went to retrieve the detective’s quilt draping it over the sleeping figure.
His fingers made contact with dark locks of hair. They were soft and silk as John caressed them. Brushed them away. Exposing more soft skin. And then he stuck the paper, his hand lingering more than necessary.
Yet there was still a silence I detested. One I had to start getting used to. There weren’t any sounds of his voice, of his laughs and giggles, of the distinct sound of his shoes against the pavement, of his jacket’s fabric brushing over my coat’s wool.
the strange knew so much from so little to how
She exhales another shaky breath, as a tear falls, and accepts it.
“Baking.” John finished the sentence for him, his eyebrows raised high, his lips turned upwards forming a curve of amusement as he came into full view.
And then the hawk’s gaze lowered, no longer under observation and deduction mode. Taking in the doctor’s features. Those eyes turned softer, the wrinkles around them faded into smooth soft skin that called to be caressed. And John’s eyes wandered down, to his sharp cheekbones, and then to his full bow lips, pink, in contrast to the smooth white alabaster skin. And
She wraps the coat tighter around her, the collar standing at attention, brushing her face.
The sun starts to wake up to bathe the battlefield with her warmth.
“No time,” was Sherlock's reply. Partly not making sense to John’s brains.
“Oh, this has been going on for a little after your departure! But it does sound like they are having fun.” Mrs. Hudson replied as she went to tuck away the groceries.
John’s main drawer of socks was empty, how that happened, it was beyond his knowledge. So he went to his bedside drawer, remembering he tossed one in there. As he retrieved the sock, something fell in the process. A card. The therapist’s card.
He was back at square one. If not lower.
But you are no more a devil as you are no more a saint.
And so John opened his eyes, formulating how to propose his idea.
He blows out smoke, his eyes lifting upwards towards the sky. He had suspected there was some sort of personal gain when Irene, having been coincidentally in the country, as she put it, went on with his mission to take down Kate Richards, in command of sector forty-eight of Moriarty’s network.
I went up to the flat. There was dust flying around, and the sun’s rays going through the blinds…
It really did work. At least for a while.
And so the spell was broken. Sherlock went over to Rosie with the last bag of ornaments who was very quiet during the last couple of minutes.
“So what, John? What’s the point of hanging useless ornaments on a tree?” Sherlock argued back, his voice muffled. The only thing visible of the detective was his messy curls sticking out of the blue quilt.
It's us against the rest of the world.
John let go of Rosie and gave her a stern look to which Rosie chuckled. “I will be back soon, don’t worry,” John said as he donned on his Parka, glancing behind him to see the mistletoe above the mirror where it was hanged there this morning. “And Sherlock, look after Rosie, and I swear if I return and you two are dissecting another toad, you’re in for a big storm on Christmas Eve.”
Warmth spread up to his fingertips, quickly branching out to his hands, arms, and eventually his whole body. Whatever coldness was there, was quickly replaced with Sherlock’s warmth.
Unbeknownst to me, I had unknowingly been spoiling my teeth on reality’s sweet dreams, running around London with a genius of a madman, solving crimes, pints at the bars with Lestrade, quarrels with Sherlock, dinners with my flatmate and Mrs. Hudson, being kidnapped by the British government, my entire time spent with Sherlock was just a sweet dream to me back then, the period after I started living in baker street up until The Fall.
It clicked.
“I….” Sherlock began with great difficulty, choking on his blood as John tried to stop his massive bleeding with his jacket, and just as he regained his breath, it was taken away.
“Daddy,” Rosie began casually as she continued opening her gift, “Santa’s handwriting looks…..strangely like yours.”
-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-
he thought.
He didn’t get to hear sherlock’s last words.
If the cards we show when the dark is close is who we really are, then I am not the best person, am I? But, quite certainly, I have come a long way. I have grown. Not so say who I was back then has disappeared. Not in the least. But I am wiser.
Had I known that John had succumbed to dim lit pits himself, I would have taken my confession with me and went to him before the wedding took place.
Upon retrieving his own glass, it was already cold, whatever warmness there was evaporated. Leaving the glass cold. But upon sipping its contents, fire raged in his throat.
“Anything happened lately?”
He inched closer till his lips met pale skin, he planted a delicate kiss just below his nape as his hand started caressing Sherlock’s lean torso. He kissed away again, and again. Each one punctuated with a sensuality to it. His path took him upwards, towards the start of dark tangled curls, there his tongue darted out and licked a quick strip of
Sherlock’s hand traveled below, to rest on John’s waist. The other hand rested on John’s shoulder.
No matter what.
“John, it is of high importance to catch him,” Sherlock’s baritone spoke loud and clearly, pointing towards the killer's direction, “We check the rooms.”
“Cause I’m a bit tipsy, William.” John replied as he drowned the rest of his wine down before making a disgusted face.
He felt content. Something that brought pleasure and relief. There was finally something to look forward to.
And he lost control.
Life was continuing without John.
To which Sherlock replied with, “It’s my second name.”
“Yes, you look very broken up.”
He rolled himself to his side. The dealer took the opportunity to leave as fast as he can. And John shouted something.
Rosie was at her happiest when she played with the snow, ate Gingersnaps and Chess Pie, enjoying Christmas so far.
The detective chuckled remembering the last time they had played it, on John’s stag night. It was a night full of memories, experiments, and theory confirmations, a night dear to both of them. “That’s absurd,” Sherlock started, “But I don’t see why not.”
It was a pit. Dark, deep, and draining. An abyss. And he was never climbing out of it, at least not alone.
But it was also a relief to know that it was all just another nightmare.
The watch seems to be slightly too big and the leather strap’s hole was too short, as there appears to be a handmade hole away from the last one, so the strap can fit perfectly around the bony wrist.
After having run diagnostics on the raven’s background, John rather found the man intriguing, to say the least.
Sherlock leaned forward, his paper in his grasp. Presenting himself to John.
“Get on your knees,” John’s commanding voice was used. Sherlock lingered behind him closing the pocketknife and analyzing the killer.
“Please,” he said in a whisper, “for me, wake up, just one more time.”
Irene looks up at the darkened sky looming over her as footsteps follow her.
“listen here cheekbones,” John interrupted, as he closed the last few steps between, face to face, John lifted his finger, “I don't give a monkeys how this tree turns out, I don’t care what color combinations we make, I just want to spend quality time with Rosie and enjoy this Christmas, so if you could please just have some fun with us,” finished John, his voice low and dangerous.
As John was tucking her in, drawing the blankets around her, Rosie said, “Have fun with Papa.”
And realization struck.
“John.” Stated Sherlock, “you’re early today,” his face back to his all too famous bored expression. “We...are…”
Sherlock was watching him. And there was something in his eyes…..something that John’s rational mind can’t pinpoint. The enigma kept looking at him, and then John said his suggestion to pass the night.
John pressed himself against Sherlock, his groan intertwined with Sherlock’s moan. “Christ, Sherlock,”
Sherlock’s laughing started fading away, and so did Rosie’s. She looked down at her bowl of brownish mixture and back to Sherlock, who is trying to be serious.
listening to me tear into him and even threaten to destroy everything he cares about.” John recited as he remembered the feeling of wanting to curl his palms against the stranger’s much too pale skin. To feel the heartbeat of the man. To strip the heartbeat from the heart.
The flame extinguishes.
John continued on his journey, going lower and lower as his hands roamed over Sherlock’s back and chest. His kisses went from delicate and gentle, to which Sherlock sighed softly from, to teasing to hungry, his tongue bolting out to taste, a blend of salt and
Sherlock’s gaze drops to his wrist, looking at his watch, his eyes following the second hand.
Something must be in it; because his thoughts were diverting.
“Sherlock!” Cried John, his hips arched, as he came over Sherlock’s torso, his breathing rapid while he saw stars.
John’s movements died down as he realized that there was nothing more to do.
-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-
“Well, let’s open the presents. Rosie, how about you start?”
The front door closed with an audible click. And it was finally time to fully truly relax from the chaos Christmas brings.
of colors from blue to grey to green, they seemed so surreal. His hair hanging from his forehead in dark elegant curls, and John would be lying if he thought he didn’t want to touch them, to stroke them, to brush them away.
Sherlock started rocking, need taking over him, his hips going back and forth, back and forth, John lay seductively with his hands clenched into a ball, muttering incoherently as Sherlock snapped his hips with all his might.
The fire painting orange on the detective’s alabaster skin, making it glow ever so slightly.
A loud thud sound made Sherlock turn around. John was against the cupboard, bleeding from his nose, the killer picked up the gun and pointed it at him.
In the past, the statement “discretion is the better part of valour” was very true for me. I took it to heart for John to never find out. To not break him after I rebuilt him with his ruins.
Sherlock grinded himself on john as he fucked his mouth. Gentle and passionate at first, then the pressure grew as desire grew, his mouth hungry for
“Daddy! You broke your own rule again!” bellowed Rosie, as she once again witnessed her father swearing.
Soft violin music started playing as John guided the guests to the door. Saying farewells and wishing everyone goodnight.
Yes, I had bled under your hands. For I deserved it.
Sherlock was a magnificent yet complicated creature. And recently, their domestic life took a turn. They became more….John couldn’t find another word for it except intimate. John could have sw-
“Well, the legwork isn’t bad at all. And the disguise is quite entertaining, having mastered it. You slip into another exterior persona, every sensory input and thinking is yours and only yours, but from the outside, you become somebody else.”
Sherlock’s senses came awake as he shuddered beneath John, he elicited a pleased hum in his deep honey-glazed baritone as he recognized what John was up to. To awaken with John expressing his longing is lush and exhilarating.
She sighs, wiping her tears, “I know it does. But sometimes time is sometimes unbearably long.”
“Sherlock!” John shouted as his arms fled from the detective’s thigh onto his chest. Chest compressions. The once beating heart now completely silent in its gilded cage. “You what?!”
He didn’t even know what home meant anymore. Definitely not in his vocabulary anymore. He went to his luxurious mansion, then. Headed straight for his alcoholic drinks collection. And drank away. He drank away his anger, his agitation, his sorrow, his memories, his life, his everything, and then he beautifully fainted his arse off from the liquor.
Sherlock’s elegant form was standing tall, the fire casting orange shadows on him as he played away at his violin. His long fingers dancing on the strings.
He hadn’t had enough time to knock when the door flung open, the man stood tall with an elegant suit as he beamed at John with his charming smile that almost swept John off his feet.
I know you are cognizant of this fact.
The man had grabbed John’s arm and lead him outside to get a cab, telling him how he came at the right time.

John made his way to the kitchen, grabbing another bottle of fine wine and two glasses, then reappeared in the living room. He took his respective seat, pouring himself a glass.
I grieved for him for two years. Even after I met Marry, I couldn’t shake away that he was part of me. As I learned later that, I too, was a part of him. A part of him that was gone.
“It’s John’s.” He confirmed.
-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-
“But yes. I look forward to returning.”
He thought of his first time meeting the detective, how aloof and cold and
, John with his hawk-like gaze, scrutinizing John under it.
But nothing happened. There was no response.
And then that dreadful day at my therapist’s, where I started again as if I had just returned an invalid from Afghanistan. If not worse. I was spitting blood when I spoke those dreaded words.
John walked through the streets that night. The street lamps look down upon him as if he were a mere nothing. Just another tiny speck of human flesh that’s worth nothing.
The sound of a cigarette lighter.
An ounce of relief floods him as nicotine enters his system.
Always.
John answered his phone, it was his colleague Sarah, she must want him to fill in for someone. And indeed, John was needed at the surgery for a couple of hours.
“Sherlock!”
He woke to the silence. It was defining.
Everyone laughed at her little input while Sherlock rolled his eyes once again before taking another sip from his wine. However, as John stole a glance, he saw something….else. Not just a monotonous expression, but rather something…..
One moment he was standing, the next he was lying on the ground. John Pressing on his wound.
Irish wool tweed.
But he was quite content on going to work, he would need to concentrate on his patients rather than one complex enigma that is currently probably stripping the tree and redoing it, his way.
, a word Sherlock had rarely experienced or lavished in until John Watson walked into his life. He once thought he knew what content truly meant. But now, with John sat close to him, the early morning traffic of London just around the corner, and the closing of yet another demanding case, he knew what content meant. Cocaine had never made him feel like this before, and it never would. Nothing compares to John Watson and the chaos that 221b houses.
“Noo!” John’s voice carried on for kilometers through rain and snow, forest and desert. His voice was completely broken as he sobbed harder, hugging his friend’s body before all the warmth faded away.
“And he’s….nothing! No family connections worth mentioning, no real money, no high-placed career.” He was as good as a piece of sand, if not for the one thing that turned him into a grain of gold instead of sand. John remembered how the stranger, with the same sort of hypnotizing way, gave away the secret to how he retrieved such delicate information.
he was. He thought of how much development and growth Sherlock went through over the past few years.
“And you went from threatening to wining and dining…how?”
He inhales. Bracing for the inevitable.
Exquisite.
She allows him to slip the coat on her.
Sherlock was perched on the couch, knees were drawn up, wrapped in his gown and a quilt. The Christmas tree sat naked between the couch and the window, with Rosie standing near it, and bags of ornaments waiting to be used.
Sherlock, who was facing Rosie, his back to the kitchen door, was holding a book in one hand and a glass beaker on the other hand. His hair completely white from flour, and what looked like a cracked eggshell was sticking out from it. His former dark velvet shirt is now almost completely stained with eggs, flour, and dough mixture. Rosie’s spoon flicking added the final touches to the shirts Picasso painting, staining it with dark brown dots as well as Sherlock’s face, his tongue darted out to lick the delicious chocolate.
Sherlock’s exhaled breath collided with John’s face. Their proximity like never before.
“Time heals.” And he speaks from personal experience. He hands her a dirtied handkerchief to which she huffs a laugh at.
“Eerily.” Sherlock stated and got a confused look from look Rise over her shoulder. “Eerily is the word you’re looking for”
John’s face swam in a pool of emotion as recognition hit. Sherlock looked utterly confused. He didn’t like being confused.
“Military trained expert, John,” Sherlock shouted, and received an “I can see that!” from the soldier. But just as he was about to stab the killer with his pocket knife, another man emerged in nursing clothes and took hold of him. He was much larger and broader, making it impossible to let loose.
“I love you.”
The white ceramic walls mimicked their clomps while reflecting its surroundings. John could see Sherlock’s coat flapping behind him as he dashed through the corridor after the killer. The emotion of worry started to get the better of him, scotland yard was on its way and will likely arrive in another 10 minutes.
By the time he had clawed his way to the very pinnacle of his industry, he had literal blood on his hands, a trial of metaphorical bodies behind him, and the only thing keeping him from stepping out one of the windows of his entire top floor office had been the sickening thought that his father would sneer at him from the pits of hell for giving up.
The night was coming to an end.
The mistletoe shining from where it hanged above the two of them.
it brought,  civilian life was nothing to John. He craved
Without my conductor of light, I had found myself in dim lit holes.
“Sherlock!” John punched Sherlock playfully, shooting him a grin before turning to Lestrade. “It’s William.”
I did leave him. Was prepared to leave him. Acted on the action. Delivered my cane to his room. I must have thought if I couldn't have him the way I wanted, and because of the way he is now, and because he killed my wife, which he really didn’t, that I should leave him
Life before The Fall, as we now call it, was a life I thought I never had. I never thought the kind of excitement I needed could be found elsewhere than the army.
He leaned. Invading Sherlock’s personal space.
Sherlock looked at both Watsons, frustrated beyond imaginable at having to do such a task. He stood up and dusted off invisible dust off his gown as he glared daggers at the tree as if it personally offended him before turning in to Rosie’s request. “Fine,” he growled.
Sherlock put down both beaker and book, and with dramatic steps marched away to get fresh clothes and shower.
“And I yours,” Sherlock chocked out as John spread his thighs, “John…”
He was met with defining silence.
The nightmare had left him shaken up, and so he spoke in a whisper.
Sherlock stretched himself on top of John, trapping his cock between, their foreheads resting against each other as they gazed at each other, breathing the same air as their
No gunshot sounds burning a hole through the wall.
Rosie was propped on the kitchen table, a wooden spoon in one hand, and a bowl of definitely not any chemicals mixture lay in front of her. She was covered from head to toe in flour and dough. Her uproarious laugh filling the kitchen, as she flicked the spoon in Sherlock’s direction.
John’s cock grew in length as his ears picked up soft noises from the back of Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock’s laugh was deep and low as opposed to Rosie’s high-pitched shrieking which continued. Both oblivious to John’s presence and completely immersed in……baking.
He beat him. Hard. Forceful. Mercy wasn’t a part of his vocabulary anymore.
John chuckled at Rosie’s statement, thinking about how he found him baking happily and enjoying himself. “Yes, sweetie, he is, isn’t he?”
“You were brilliant.”
And come to think of it, you are no devil either.
The therapist spoke, her brows knitting in question.
“Met someone about a month ago.” John’s face gave away a quick smile for Ella.
I have had corporations and daughters
“You know, We could just wait for scotland yard to arrive,” John pointed out as he busted the sixth door.
The night started extending as Mrs. Hudson started another lovely story where she had mentioned her first name.
It's easier to love when you're winning at large, and everything's going your way. A coward would only say such a thing. I could have told him right then and there that I loved him. But I didn’t. He was flying to eastern Europe with no guarantee of coming back alive. But then what? If I told him that I loved him. What would I do with his corpse? What would I do with unexplored romantic love?
“Oh dear, you must be freezing!” exclaimed his landlady as she hurriedly took the bags from him.
I was left a broken man. Little did I know that the future held things I never imagined possible.
I remember too vividly one occasion when I was walking home with a post-case adrenaline high a few weeks after the wedding. The London traffic was a cacophony in my ears, citizens were bustling out and in shops, talking blaringly, the trees were losing a fight against wind, unfamiliar footsteps tramping about the earth.
The time read four twenty six. The first lines of sunlight break through the horizon.
Through all of our struggles, through all of our fights and rows, through all of our hardships, of all the hurt we’ve thrown at each other, the silence was the worst.
“What next?” came Rosie’s innocent question, still recovering from the fit of laughter she had.
He thought of the past few months. He thought of the extra glances Sherlock shot his way. Of the way their fingers brushed. Of the way how Sherlock looked completely relaxed when he was around John.
Trim legs uncross themselves, then re-cross the other way, and his therapist actually speaks.
And John found himself yet again mesmerized by the half-drunken detective.
And all for nothing. Nothing good came out of it in the long term, only short intervals of pleasure and relief and excitement from reality.
“I wanted to see her one last time before she. . .wanted to talk to her. Just talk.” She answers the unspoken question. “I’m sure you understand.” She eyes him a side glance, to which he smirks and inhales another nicotine filled breath, his eyes roaming over the battle of wind and clouds, the former winning, as per usual.
Sherlock looks at her, taking her image in. Hoping to god she won't start the Spanish inquisition on him.
“Good morning, love,” spoke John softly as he kissed his way across Sherlock’s back, whispering his desire against the elegance of
He thought of all the happy times the pair of them went through. He thought of the fun times he and Rosie spent together. Of the time when Sherlock took Rosie to a crime scene without his permission. Of the time he caught Sherlock reading through John’s blog to Rosie, who was perched up and listening.
And John grinned to himself, secretly thinking that Rosie’s heart-warming tone touched a soft spot of Sherlock’s.
They came to a halt when small drops of bright red could be seen on the floor. They looked at each other, nodded, and John took the lead with his gun pointed forwards, knees bent and in full soldier mode. While Sherlock tagged along, a pocketknife in his hands, feeling helpless.
“Don’t I just,” John grins.
John dotted the name on the piece of paper, thinking it would be a good choice. And then he stood up, stepped forward to be in front of Sherlock. He propped one knee on the vacant side of the armchair, pressing it between the side rest of the armchair and Sherlock’s thigh. The pressure sending a bolt of electricity through him.
“He thinks…that I need some excitement in my life.” John huffs in amusement. “So it’s been a few weeks now, of offering to take him to Italy or japan for a weekend and instead eating Chinese takeaway at his flat while he rants at how unimaginative criminals are or getting dragged down dark alleys by the hand like a little kid so we can watch for a burglar or blackmailer or whatever.” John remembers how the man had declined his offer of abroad travel without a second thought. Instead choosing to let John in on his work, and John would be lying if he said he wasn’t enjoying it one bit. “The turnover rate in my security detail’s giving HR the fits.”
Sirens could be heard.
But in the end. We are together. We are one. We conquer our hardships. We get past them. And what lays beyond them is better than what we ever experienced.
His forehead rested to the side on the cab’s window, his thoughts running. He didn’t know what happened back at the flat, and what would have happened had Sarah not called.
-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-0-o-
He went home that night.
Now that is a sight to cherish.
John’s head turned to face Sherlock who was now facing him and halted, an annoyed look plastered on him. As they both turned their heads to continue running, despite a painful expression on John’s face, the killer had gone. The killer had disappeared. The killer had vanished. The killer took this opportunity to run away. There were too many corridors and too many rooms to be sure which way he went.
John carefully flipped himself so that he was lying on top of Sherlock now, he gave him a deep kiss, John’s hand lay on Sherlock’s shoulder as the latter had an arm around John. They gazed at each other, they saw what neither would allow anyone else to see but for them. And John loved this. He loved him. He loved this beautiful madman that lay beneath him.
the bastard had been when talking about his alcoholic sister and abusive household.
I also remember drinking. Heavily. Both after his death, and in hardships. I didn’t want to become like Harry, and I didn’t. But I had drank. And I had been drunk. I’m still disgusted at myself for how I succumbed to drinking like Harry did.
“Sherlock.” John husked, his chest heaving from adrenaline, as Sherlock looked at his eyes, pupils dilated and overcome with need. He imagined his own eyes looked the same way if he was going by how he feels.
“Fuck, hurry,” John rasped out in need. He needed to feel Sherlock inside, have him inside him, he wanted to feel Sherlock entering him, claiming him, holding him, whispering to him adulations and sweet things. He need it rough as well, he needed to feel the pain and pleasure, and “oh fuck!” he cried out as Sherlock sank onto him with a groan, breath hitched and curls plastered to his forehead.
“Help me wrap!” Rosie had appeared once again, interrupting his thoughts, with a gift in her hand. And so John got to the task of wrapping up presents.
This gets a blink and movement from both of  Ella’s eyebrows. Her mouth even twitches, like it’s trying to remember how to smile. John wonders why.
