"She's been in full business mode," Charlie says apologetically. "But, I mean, you guys did what you promised and no one got — well,
"There
Castiel takes solace in the fact that he's not walking on it. He opens the door, and Jack is standing in front of the sink, a wet now-light-red towel in his hand. His face does admittedly look a lot better now. Maybe Castiel missed more blood than he thought.
"It was a worthy attempt," she says.
CastieI sighs. Well, if he can't get her to leave, at least she's making herself useful.
"Oh, no, I did," Dean says. He pulls a walkie-talkie from his waistband. "Clear?"
“No.”
When Dean speaks next, it’s entirely of his own volition. They’re nearing the agreed-upon spot to drop the two men off, and in their last minute or two in the car, Dean asks, “Hey, redhead, if we get shot or whatever, you’re the one telling Jack, right?”
"It sure as fuck is," they say. "Hang on, I'm gonna summon her." They pull out their phone and plug it into the seldom-used iPhone jack. It takes a few moments for them to find the song, and another few moments for his uncultured ass to figure out what it is.
was that?"
"Of course not," Dean lies.
"Apple juice?" he asks hopefully.
It wouldn't be so bad if he could just
CastieI paces back and forth across the living room, not so much because he's nervous but because it will hopefully keep him awake. He debates making himself another cup of coffee, but he doesn’t want to leave the room in case Jack wakes up so he resigns himself to another few minutes of suffering.
"Okay, quick interjection," Charlie announces. "Who's your father?"
"I will admit," Jody says, "I wish you two could have done it
“Well, don’t
"Oh, thank god," she whispers. "I'm
A few months pass, and there's no sign of the Hunters anywhere. Dean doesn't stop by again. Jack doesn't run into him somewhere. They're off the hook for any major crime. It really feels like things are back to normal.
"You're welcome," Castiel says.
Gordon cocks an eyebrow. “And what’s that?”
to get involved."
"I've known Dean since we were younger than you are now," Castiel begins. "I didn't see the beginning of the Hunters, but I did see a lot of the firsts. I actually remember the first time a Hunter died.
"You know," Castiel says quietly, "you really don't have to stay."
“Sure thing!” Ben pulls out two more cupcakes, and he puts all three cupcakes in a plastic container that seems to be meant for four.
,” Gordon says skeptically, “because I’m sure he was doing the Hunters a
"Well, that's a good thing, right?" Charlie asks. "You're not in trouble. That's, like,
The man with the gun holds it in the air and lets off another shot, followed by a loud, "Everybody shut up!"
Well, here goes nothing. "I've seen Dean a couple of times since the bank. He reintroduced us."
"Where can I find a fresh towel?" Jack asks.
"Mm-hmm," Castiel hums skeptically. "And whose name is it rented under?" There's no way Dean would let
Sam shakes his head, exasperated. “Look, if you want to throw yourself a pity party, you do that, but
"It looks like it," Castiel says, confused. Who brings a limousine to a police station? He can't imagine they're turning in here for anything else. It's not exactly the most convenient place to turn around, and there's really nothing else over there.
Jody just shakes her head. "Alright, whatever." She turns her attention to Castiel. "First of all, how are you doing? You said you got hit twice? Are you okay?”
Castiel narrows his eyes. "Hi, Dean."
"Why not?" Dean asks. "It'd be fun. You and me against the world, just like old times."
Castiel chuckles as he takes the bottle. "Because yelling 'drugs' in a police station is
Dean rolls his wrists out in front of him. "Much." He looks up at the other man. "So, whatcha doing here?"
“You’re going to get yourself killed,” Sam says again, because apparently everyone will
“As far as I know, he’s the only angel you got,” Benny remarks. “Believe me, I was just as surprised as you.”
Castiel sighs and sits up. "I can't; it's probably—"
"Oh, yeah, that might help."
"Dean barely knew her," Castiel says. "She'd only been there for a couple months and she spent most of her time with her friends, not with us. And do you know what Dean did when he heard that this girl he barely knew died?"
like him. Usually.
Dean rolls his eyes, a small smile on his lips. "Yeah, yeah. Go ahead, get all your jokes out now."
Lucifer smiles. “Hey, Cassie.”
"What do you mean?" Charlie asks.
Jack nods solemnly. “I figured. But, you know, if you ever change your mind…” He gives a small shrug “I’d
"But I'm not," Castiel says quietly. "You guys will always have my heart, but I'm not one of you anymore and I can't pretend I am."
As it turns out, Nathan really isn’t kidding when he says it’s right inside. It’s behind a one-way mirror right next to the door, and the self-checkout is right in view from inside. Well, that’s convenient. It’s already taped off with crime scene tape, and Castiel catches a glimpse of the dead body as he walks by. A single shot straight to the head. Impressive.
"Brain freeze?" she says. "My brain is freezing? Like a popsicle?" She sighs dramatically. "It doesn't matter anymore. My brainsicle melted. It’s okay now."
The shootout behind the mall, CastieI presumes. That's not good. If they know Jack killed one of their own, they're not going to let him off easy. He's lucky they didn't kill him then and there — or unlucky, as the case may be. There are worse things than death, and this may be one of them.
"How —"
"Cas, wait!" Charlie runs up to him and grabs his shoulder, and he hits her arm away. "Look, I'm sorry, but —"
case scenario," CastieI interrupts. "The fact that Dean didn't shoot me right here, right now is a curse in its own right."
"A few times," Castiel says, trying to keep his answer vague enough that Charlie doesn't piece anything together. "I probably won’t again, though, if that's what you mean."
"I'm sorry," CastieI says quietly.
He flips the page over. The other side is a letter from Lucifer, his name signed in script that is
“Yeah, or something,” Castiel says with a shrug. “You’re welcome to ask him about it, but I can’t promise he’ll give you a straight answer.”
"It's upstairs," Dean says.
The cops take that exact moment to bust in (couldn't they have done that thirty seconds earlier,
. Getting mixed up in gang shit —
"The Vamps —"
CastieI glances behind himself to where Jack is lying on the couch. The boy shakes his head emphatically, so Castiel turns his attention back to Dean. "Does Jack have red hair, a police badge, and an unhealthy obsession with nerd shit? 'Cause if not, I'm pretty sure it's just my partner."
Dean takes a deep breath. This isn't enough. Just asking for Cas to show his face isn't enough; he needs to show that he's sorry. Whether that's what Cas is looking for, Dean's not quite sure, but he knows
"You know I have to ask," Mary says, looking over at Sam with a small smirk. "Who's the girl?"
of things, but I have to draw the line somewhere.”
“Oh, Cassie’s not a cop right now,” Dean assures him. “He’s something much, much worse.”
"You could probably be on your way now if you'd just let me speak," Jody remarks.
"And me, right?" Gabriel asks as if Lucifer didn't just make space between them for that exact reason.
"So someone
a minute away," Dean whines.
Castiel puts the roll of duct tape and the three envelopes in his left hand so he can hold his gun in his right. He keeps it down by his side and he climbs the rest of the stairs. He doesn’t want to come off as a threat, but he doesn’t want to walk into this unarmed, either. He finishes climbing the stairs and…
"Good," Castiel says. "Look, I get it. You've done a lot for them. I'm not going to pretend you haven't. But Dean…" He sighs. "You can't live your whole life for someone else. You could put someone else in charge — Mick or Ketch or Crowley or…" He makes a face. "Even Benny. There are so many people who would and
Dean helps him out when he immediately shoots the idea down. "That's a great way to get us both killed."
"Wherever the hell you want to," Jody replies.

to go on with the Hunters.) Arresting Dean is a huge win in that regard; is she really willing to risk it on a maybe?
"Well, I don't know about 'living,'" Dorothy says, "but this is my place." She pauses. "Well, mine and Charlie's, and I'm guessing that's who you're here to see."
Why couldn't the Vamps have just shot him? At least
"I think we could pull it off," CastieI says. They're both pretty good liars; he'd like to think that would make them good actors, too. They could probably fool the Vamps into thinking he’s still a Hunter, at least of the unofficial variety -- assuming he doesn’t get shot before he can get a word out.
Dean rolls his eyes (again; how is this not giving him a headache?). “Relax; we’ll be so obnoxiously in love, you’ll think you’re listening to a Hallmark movie.”
Jack washes his forearms in the sink. He sucks in a deep breath through his teeth as the water hits his cuts but he doesn't pull away. The water becomes progressively less red as time passes, and once it drains clear, Jack turns the faucet off and gently dries his arms.
Castiel smiles to himself. “
"Well, that's stupid," Jack pouts. "There's no reason the human body should be this fragile. It's stupid."
"There's room in your apartment for two," Dean reminds him. "How about, just for tonight, I come home with you."
"And here we are, waiting for a 20-dollar bill," Charlie says.
Castiel lolls his head back with a groan. "Fine, but leave the kid alone and let him make his own choices, okay?"
"I can pay today and you can pay me back later," Charlie offers.
"That is a
"Just 'cause tomorrow's probably gonna suck," she says, "and knowing that is probably gonna make every moment leading up to it suck, too."
"He was
Castiel cocks his head to the side. "'Huh' what?" That could mean so many different things and he's not sure how to feel about it.
Castiel raises an eyebrow, but he reluctantly follows her inside. There are only two people in the building, both behind the counter full of sweets. One is a woman, probably about their age, and the other is a kid, maybe 10 years old. The boy is at the counter where he’s organizing the baked goods, presumably to add the muffins on the counter to the collection. The woman is towards the back, frosting a cake that almost looks too beautiful to eat.
“Claire doesn’t let
Cheryl nods. “Sure. If you need me, I’ll be around.”
Charlie runs a hand through her hair, exasperated. "You gotta give me more than this. I cannot force myself to keep asking questions that I don't want to know the answer to. You just gotta come out and tell me —"
Castiel waves that off. "You can have the couch."
"No more Vamps," Dean confirms. He pauses. "Probably. We don't really know for sure — but if there
“A whole lot of nothing,” Dean mutters. That’s all Cas and Jack are giving them:
Castiel’s eyes scan the nearby buildings. A bank? That can’t be it. Burger King? She knows he prefers McDonald’s -- and who
After a brief moment of deliberation, Dean says an absentminded, “Hey, I’ll be right back,” his gaze never straying from Cas’s face. Yes, he knows he’s more likely to make a fool of himself (again) than to get some answers, but he can’t just look at Cas and
CastieI chuckles nervously. "I know you're trying to help, but that really just puts a lot of pressure on me." He
Jody slowly closes the door and turns back around. "Are you sure?"
But he still says, "Of course," no questions asked. If he won't say it to Dean, the honorary dad of the gang, he must not have a lot of options. Castiel doesn't want to let him down.
"I can only imagine," Charlie says. She stands up and heads to the doorway, where she gently nudges her partner. "I'm gonna call for an ambulance. Can you keep an eye on her?"
CastieI shakes his head. "That's not gonna be happening for a very long time."
"And today's been such a good day, I don't even care that this doesn't make sense," Castiel says teasingly.

"Yeah, and I was
Castiel swallows hard. "Dean…"

CastieI glances at Charlie as if they could
"There was a lot today that I didn't understand," she tells them, "and I think I'm going to do us all a favor by forgetting about it. There's just one thing I have to ask about." She looks up at Dean. "One of the Vamps said 'your boy' killed some of —"
"Even Dean's not confident we'll get them all," CastieI says. "We have no idea if we're actually gonna stop the Vamps. They'll probably be rattled for a while, but I don't think we're gonna stop them."
. What the hell does Dean want him to see? Castiel knows exactly what office building he's referring to: they used to squat there before Castiel ran away and Dean moved the whole gang so they wouldn't be found. There's absolutely nothing of interest there. Does Dean have something tangible to show him? Something he wants to bring with him? Why wouldn't he just
"Sure, unless Dean steals your spot," Lucifer says teasingly.
"Does it matter?" CastieI replies dismissively, heading back to Jack's side.
Dean shrugs nonchalantly. "Me."
one in years.
Dean looks at him like he’s crazy, and Castiel makes a point of ignoring that. He knows what he’s doing. Granted, it won’t prove Dean wrong -- it
"No, you need to
She shakes her head. "I don't — I don't know. I was coming back from the library one night and then I just… wasn't." She shrugs helplessly. "I don't know if I was drugged or…?"
Jack shrugs. "Yeah, why not?"
illegal — but he also knows better than to say that aloud with people eavesdropping. After a long few moments, he hits his hand down on the table and turns to face the one-way mirror. "I can get you the Vamps."
Castiel leans against the doorway, and the two of them lapse into silence. Jack keeps at it cleaning his wounds, and slowly but surely, he seems to be making progress. Every now and then he touches the wrong gash in the wrong way and winces, but he keeps going anyway. He's a tough kid; Castiel has to give him that.
Castiel throws his head back as though this was an exasperatingly stupid question. "You know there are other Hunters besides Dean and Jack, right? Like, not everything is going to be Dean." Granted, this time it
“Apparently,” Dean says with a shrug. “They live over there." He jerks a thumb behind him, pointing back at the house. It's the same house he grew up in, and it's admittedly a little uncomfortable being back here.
“Charlie, you don’t have to --”
alive," Dean remarks. "It's been so long, I was starting to think you passed out from blood loss or something."
Dean Winchester, the goddamn leader of a goddamn gang of goddamn criminals, and you never told me.”
Dean's face remains expressionless. Usually Castiel is good at reading him; right now, he has absolutely no idea what's going on in his head. The man doesn't even look at him, eyes trained on Jody as she thinks.
Castiel closes the door, and Charlie drives off to find the rest of the cops.
Fortunately, Dean's answer is a simple, "Hopefully nothing." He shrugs. "I'd like to think I'll be walking out of here in, what, 45 hours?"
wrong," CastieI says quickly. "It wasn't you —"
Jack shifts his body and rests his head on his uncle's shoulder. Castiel can't help but smile. Jack might be the best thing that's happened to him in years — and the only thing capable of
CastieI runs a hand down his face. This just keeps getting worse and worse. "Is there any way that gun could be traced back to you? Did you get it legally?  Is it registered to you or any of the Hunters?"
"Apparently I'm not the only one," Sam says, gesturing to him. "I mean, the trenchcoat? That's a very mature adult trenchcoat."
All he says, standing helplessly in the doorway with tears streaming down his face, is, "They know."
They lapse into a silence for a few minutes, and though they each get the chance to play a couple of words in Scrabble, it’s far from enough to keep him from feeling like he’s going to fall asleep. Maybe if they’d been doing something that involved moving -- or even just standing -- he wouldn’t be struggling so much, but they can’t stop halfway through a game (and Castiel is losing and he refuses to end it until he wins).
“A slice of lemon loaf cake?” Ben asks.
Compared to the hustling and bustling of the other room, the hallway is surprisingly calm. Dean and Castiel head down to the room they saw that young girl in earlier. The door is still only slightly cracked open, but the light shines through now so he knows someone has been here in the last few minutes. It means he and Dean probably aren't necessary here, but they might as well take a look.
"Like your hand is any better," Castiel says sarcastically. "You're so obviously bluffing, it's not even funny." He's not sure how he knows, but looking at him, he can just

part of that plan. Unfortunately, it’s part of Jody’s plan, so they don’t have much of a choice. It’s going to be hard to have one last destresser of a conversation with Dean in the back seat, but it just means Castiel has to come out alive so he and Charlie can say stupid shit together later.
Castiel frowns. Dean doesn’t sound happy about that. He knew he wouldn’t, but it doesn’t make him feel any better hearing it. He just hopes Dean doesn’t get mad at Jack for it. The kid really doesn’t know any better.
That would actually be great, now that he thinks about it. Maybe Jack will convince Lucifer that he wants a better life, and Gabriel would probably come if the rest of his family did. Dean had almost seemed to consider it last time they spoke. Maybe if all the Novaks left, he would, too. The Hunters would be in fine hands under Ketch's control or Mick's or, hell, even Benny's. Maybe this is what it will take for him to figure that out.
“When we get home, I’m going to tell you all about him,” Dean says. “And no, you don’t have a choice.”

“No, Cas, that’s actually
” the old man asks again, impossibly more irritated this time. The playful flirting probably doesn’t help.
"Glad to hear it," Randy says. "I'll let you get back to whatever you were doing. Sorry about this.".
A flash of movement over Benny’s shoulder catches Dean’s attention. It’s subtle, a small flash of tan in the distance. Dean makes a point of not looking over there. This isn’t the first time he’s seen something like this in the last few days, but he’s gotten better at not acknowledging it. Sam’s convinced he’s lost his mind and chasing ghosts is definitely not helping his case.
CastieI waits a few moments until Jack confirms that he found them. He gives the kid another minute or two to raise any complaints, but he seems pretty content — or as content as he can be, given the circumstances.
It's probably for the best, Castiel reasons. There are officers listening in on everything that happens. They probably don't want to hear the two chatting, and Castiel doesn't really want them to, either. It's just so awkward walking around in complete silence.
is gossip I'd like to get my hands on," Claire remarks.
John chuckles. "You haven't changed a bit."
“I can’t believe it’s really you,” Gabriel whispers. “I never thought I’d get to see you again. It’s been so long…”

"Oh, come
Jack frowns. "Because I got involved in a gun fight and people died."

"But, to answer your question, yeah, I'm gonna go by she/they — but not at work. Err, not yet, at least." With a nervous smile, they add, "I don't think I wanna come out to most people at the station right now."
"He's doing good," Jack says. His face lights up and he reaches into his pocket. "I completely forgot!"
CastieI frowns. He's very much
Castiel frowns. He's not sure how to feel about that yet. "What did it say?"
Jody frowns. "Yeah, no, that's not what I'm going for." She pushes herself to her feet. "I'm going to try to talk to him. Do you want to come?"
"Then it wasn't your fault," Castiel says. "You just wanted some fro-yo. You had no idea anything else was going to happen and there was nothing you could have done. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's hard enough to mourn a friend without feeling guilty about it."
Leia; it's Padmé, just like the characters have been saving for the last three movies.
"And I already have a volunteer!" Dean beams. "Love that for me!"
Mary raises an eyebrow. "What's going on here?"
"We would've done that whether you told us to or not," Claire replies.
I wasn't supposed to talk to."
"God, you're such a teenager," CastieI mutters.

Jody crosses her arms. "Meaning?"

"Depends how good his lawyer is," CastieI says with a shrug that he really hopes looks carefree.
he’s daydreaming about shooting the guy. Hell, if the cops weren’t listening to their every move, he’s sure he would -- and once upon a time, Castiel would have cheered him on for it. Oh, how he longs for simpler times.
"I'll be okay," Jack assures her. "Worst case scenario, I get an infection and die a slow, painful death. What's not to like?"
"But he'll start asking questions," Jack says, "and I really don't want to get him involved. Not yet, at least."
Lucifer's jaw drops. "He

CastieI is in the middle of cleaning the blood off Jack's arm when the doorbell rings. He groans and puts the towel down. Doesn't he have enough on his plate

the gang leader guy! No one would've…" She mimes the firing of a gun. After a brief pause, she adds a wary, "Right?"
Dean gives a small shrug. "I've got the rest of eternity to eat pie. I think I'm gonna hold off for now."
Castiel sighs. “I don’t know. It’s just, you know, gang wars and shit. The Hunters have a lot of enemies. The police barely crack the list.” That’s true even on a normal day; after what happened with Alex a few months ago, he’s sure it’s only grown worse. He doesn’t mention that, though. He loves Charlie, but he’s not sure he trusts her
Castiel nods. He usually enjoys working, at least a little bit, but right now, he just wants to go home. He could really go for a nice cold bath. Err, maybe he’d rather take a cold shower. His arm might turn the bath water red, and that doesn’t sound quite as comfortable.
"Cas —"
Castiel is picking up the tab today, but first, he needs some cash. His credit card has been acting up lately, and until his replacement comes in, he's stuck paying everything in cash. Fortunately, Charlie has no qualms about going to the bank before lunch as long as it saves her a few bucks, so that's what they do.
"Mm, I don't love it
was that for?
want a nap."
Castiel rests a hand on the grip of his gun. He manages to keep any sense of fear he’s feeling from showing, and hopefully the reach for his gun makes him look more threatening and not more threatened. “Gordon Walker.” He clicks his tongue disapprovingly. “You always were a bit of a dumbass, but joining the Vamps? That’s embarrassing, even for you.” Admittedly, it is
“What does that even mean?” Charlie asks.

too big), it works itself out.
When the kiss ends, their lips part but their faces don’t, their foreheads pressed together.
"Dean…" Castiel says softly.
A few seconds later, our mysterious out-of-frame gunman appears, recognizable as such only because he’s shoving a box of chocolate bars in his bag. He looks up at the self-checkout camera, pauses, then reaches for the gun, probably to shoot that one the same way he shot the first one. He seems to think better of it -- likely because there are so many camera in this goddamn store that one of them would catch him anyway -- because he leaves his gun alone. Instead, he just winks at it before walking past.
After a long stretch of silence, Dean asks quietly, "And did you find it?"
Sam chuckles. "Not me, that's for sure."
cheap. It doesn't feel like that should be his priority right now, though.
"Goodbye, Dean."
like such a dad," Dean mutters.
"Loyalty and the blood on your hands."
Dean snorts. "What is this, kindergarten?"
"Well, maybe I just like salads," Sam says indignantly.  "Did you ever think of that?" He plucks a chocolate bar from a shelf as they pass by and drops it in his cart, and Dean snickers.
"Really?" Castiel cocks an eyebrow skeptically. "Did you pull the trigger?"
Is it even Supernatural if Jenny's not in it?
Castiel tries to catch Dean’s eye as he walks by, but Dean barely gives him a glance. Okay, so maybe Dean
"Right, okay," Charlie says, "and this ex boyfriend, his name is…?"
“Fuck yeah,” Charlie whispers. “I love when people die!”
"Yeah, why?"
"What's going on?" Castiel asks, mostly just to break the tension.
“I don’t think I will,” Jack says, “but I’ll remember that just in case. Thank you.”
“You’ll see,” she says with a smile.
Castiel glances at Gordon. If he stays here any longer, Gordon is going to realize it. He’s not going to let Castiel -- a homicide detective who has handled a plethora of missing persons cases in his time -- walk out of here knowing there’s a girl being held against her will. He wants to tell her that they’ll be back for her, but he knows he can't.
CastieI whips around to face them. "I can't deal with this with you looking over my shoulder! Go home, Charlie, before you get in too deep."
“Hey, what’s up?” Sam finally catches up to him, panting slightly. “Where’s Cas?”
It takes all his self-control not to respond with a very emphatic, "No!" Instead, all he says is, "I'm just gonna go back to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow."
"No we weren't!" Castiel says indignantly.
night out together before I'm a wanted man again?"
Dean makes a show of looking around. "Weird. I swear I just heard a question that only my lawyer will get an answer to, but I can't seem to find my lawyer anywhere."
CastieI ignores that. "If you give us Jack and Claire —"
Castiel cocks his head to the side. “Do I know you?”

," Castiel says. "It barely grazed me." Now that the initial shock has worn off, he’s decided his back hurts far more than his arm does. The burning sensation of an open wound may be more painful, but the large scale of what he’s sure is soon to be his very-bruised back feels worse.
"And I can't talk about it to anyone because everyone knows it's all my fault and what right do I have to complain, you know?"
When that transaction is over, Sarah moves on to the next customer. Just as Nathan had said, this customer doesn’t bring anything to purchase, and with no warning that Castiel can see, he pulls out his gun and fires a few shots off at the ceiling. There’s no sound, but when Sarah opens her mouth, he knows it’s a scream.
"Bye, Char—"
much," Lucifer says. "Stay safe tomorrow, Cas. I know you want to help Dean and I know you want to take down the Vamps, but don't do anything stupid. You're no use to anyone dead."
"Oh." Jack gives a small smile. "I like that."
Sam pinches the bridge of his nose. "You better commit my number my memory because you're
"We can come back later," Sam offers.
Admittedly, that's really downplaying their relationship. Dean was everything he could have asked for at the time. He was family. He was
"His name is on the tip of my tongue," Castiel says. "It's… What the fuck was his name?"
“And then your boy murdered them,” the old man says, and Castiel grits his teeth. He was really hoping that wouldn’t come up with the cops listening in, but he supposes it was bound to happen eventually. It really

tired."
"Exactly," Sam says, looking pointedly at his brother. "Cas was God once, too, remember? If anyone knows how easily power can get to someone's head, it's him. Can you blame him for spending so much time with him?"
“Then no, I won’t.”
Castiel bites back a smile. He may not like Benny, but he can’t deny that the bickering that comes with his presence is usually pretty entertaining.
“They’re Vamps, Cas,” Dean deadpans. “They’re practically nocturnal.”
"Sam, I'm literally going to be by his side the whole time," Castiel deadpans. "I am very much taking the same risk."
“Wild Bill?” Dean tries again.
CastieI hesitates. Deep down, he'd already known that was true, but it was easier to pretend it wasn't before anyone had said it out loud.
Dean scoffs. "So you're gonna keep in touch with Sam but you can't swing by for one poker night?"
Dean looks back at CastieI, who doesn't hesitate to meet his eye again. This time there's a challenge in his gaze — one that Dean is either oblivious to or just good at pretending he is. Castiel has a feeling it's the latter.
"I haven't finished simping over Milf Amidala!" Charlie adds, and he gives her a playful slap on the head. Whoever let Charlie get ahold of Gen Z slang owes him money for emotional reparations.
“Jack?” Castiel slips his gun back into his holster. He’s pretty confident he won’t be needing it.
. At least now it's out of the way —"
, Cas, I sure as hell can," Dean growls.
you’re gonna have to wait and see on,” Dean says. In a mockingly reassuring voice, he adds, “But don’t worry. You won’t have to wait long to get your just desserts.”
at first; when he sees Castiel's face, he grins. He drops his feet back to the ground and raises his hand in a wave, the other one drooping below because, again, they're handcuffed together. He's not sure if Dean didn't think that through or if he just didn't care.
Jack just nods.
Here goes nothing.
this?" CastieI mutters, though he supposes there's no point in trying to figure it out when he's walking to the door anyway.
He doesn't.
Castiel shrugs. “I’m off the clock. I don’t have to pretend I’d rather see you in a jail cell than a coffin.”

always one person he could always count on to make him feel better, though. "Any wisdom I have, Dean probably has too. You can always talk to him, too." They're a lot more alike than Castiel cares to admit.
“Are you sure?” Jack asks. “You came all this way. You might as well come in.”
Castiel snorts. Well, it looks like he was right: all he's getting from this

should have mentioned that earlier," Charlie says, much more politely than her exasperated partner would have said it.
Jody might have some choice words for you." She pauses. "Did you say anything stupid?"
The old man nods politely. “I hope ‘next time’ is far down the road, for all of our sakes.” He reaches out to shake Castiel’s hand --
"You look out for your people, and I respect that," she tells him. "Not many people would tell the police they killed someone to protect a friend." With a glance at Castiel, she adds, "I get what Novak sees in you."
Dean can’t help but smile. “Hey, Cas.”
Castiel bites back a laugh. "Well, I'm sure your pseudo-son would be
Ultimately, it's Charlie who puts the end to it when the light turns red and the limo ahead of them takes the same turn they do. She stops singing and turns the music down. "Is Taylor Swift going to the station?"
"But my dad loves you!" Jack says.

system."
As much as he hates to admit it, Dean has a point. As far as the Vamps are concerned, you can never be too careful around a cop. They're definitely going to check him for a wire to make sure he's there as a Hunter, not an officer.
“I think you just spelled it out right there, buddy,” Dean remarks.
Admittedly, this is a poor summary of how Dean responded, but in the technical sense, it's not untrue. His bluntness earns a small smile from Jack, and that alone is enough to assure Castiel that he's done a good job with this story. Now he just has to make his point.
Castiel's jaw drops. He looks at Dean, half-expecting to see him holding back a laugh at this shitty attempt at a joke, but Dean just nods once. It's Jack. It's really him.
“C’mon, just trust me,” they say. “It’s gonna be fun, I promise.”
"You just told me not to worry him,” Jack reminds him. “You should stop worrying about him, too.”
“So, what happened?” Jo asks. “How’d you bite it?”
"So," Dean murmurs, thumbing at Castiel's lip. "What've you told your friends about me?"
"Hey, Cas, are you okay?" Charlie asks.
Castiel nods. “While you’re out here walking on eggshells to stay out of sight, I get to work
When Dean answers, it's directed at Jack: "Cop."
"If they catch Dean, tell me," Sam says. "And if they don't? Try to keep it that way."

"You know," Dean says, "if you don't have a plane to catch or whatever, you could stick around for a little bit. It's poker night tonight, and I'm sure there are a few people around who'd be happy to see you again."
Lucifer balls his hands into fists by his side and grits his teeth. "I'm gonna kill them."
"Oh, thank god," Lucifer whispers. "So, what, he got arrested for something? I don't know why he didn't call me. That's supposed to be what I'm here for."

"Like your brothers?" she asks with an eyebrow raised.
Well, that bodes well for Dean's freedom, at least. If he won’t confess to anything and he won’t give them anything to work with, he’s bound to be home free soon. Jody was right: the cops really
Castiel checks his bedroom closet for the third time this morning. It’s just not there. It’s not in his bureau, either. What the fuck? Where could it be? He’s really running out of places to look.
“Well, it looks like you’re outnumbered,” Castiel says. More sympathetically, he adds, “It was
Castiel rolls down his window. "I think this is as far as I go."
"Yep!" They run out of the room, and he has to appreciate how quickly they agree to do everything he asks (except, of course, leaving).
. That actually bodes surprisingly well for him.
With that, he heads out to see what everyone else is up to. In the time it took for Castiel to get suited up, bulletproof vest included, Dean did the same, and he's now leaning against the wall and talking to his brother. At least
But he's not avoiding him entirely. If Benny saw him today, he
Thinking about all his past mistakes isn't doing anyone any favors, though, and sticking with Sam as he does it was only going to drag him down too. That leaves Dean with two choices: he could either sulk alone at home or he could go for a walk. As much as he likes his new Heavenly house, taking a stroll through the woods seems like a better way to clear his mind.
Castiel looks back at Jody. Is this official, then? She'll probably have to talk to the DA's office first (and they might need a warrant?) but he has a feeling the biggest obstacle in the way was just getting Jody and Dean to agree on something.
Arrives right on time, and he's careful to make sure his car is locked and all his valuables are hidden before he makes his way to the office building.
Dean shakes his head fondly. God, what a fucking dork. That’s what he loves about the guy, though. He’s somehow both the smartest and the dumbest person Dean has ever met.
the talking.
Dean squeezes his hand gently. "What if I take you up on half of your offer, then?"
"I know," she says, "but I talked to Dean's brother, and he seems to think this is far more dangerous than I thought. I just want to know that you're sure about this, and you're not just doing something stupid to help an old flame."
“Hooray,” the blonde-haired girl deadpans. “The prodigal son returns.”
So that's what he does. He takes out his phone and calls her up. He holds his phone between his ear and his shoulder as he searches his trench coat pockets for the key to his apartment. Where the hell did he put it… Ah, there it is. He’s just putting the key in the lock when Charlie picks up.
She crosses her arms. "Who's asking?"
"Well, no, but —"
was at register one, no cart, no nothing, and he pulled a gun.
"How do you know him?" they ask. "You said he's, what, 16? Wouldn't he have been a baby when you left?"
"Yeah, yeah." Sam rolls his eyes. "I will admit, this was less painful than I thought it was going to be — probably because I didn't have to deal with you most of the day." Dean punches his shoulder playfully, and he chuckles. "It looks you guys are okay, though — mostly — so I guess I'm done here. It was nice to see you guys again."
Castiel hands Jack his cup of apple juice, and he gets a, "Thank you," in response. Jack takes a few sips before setting it down on the coffee table.
“And I literally do not care,” Castiel says. “I’ve made my decision, so unless Jody or Dean change their minds, I’m in this now.”
"So you're not sold," Dean surmises. "That's fine. If you change your mind, I'll be around."
"Oh, please, I'm always gay on main," Castiel says. "No, Dean and I were just being embarrassingly lovey-dovey." And Gordon said that it was their normal, too, which might be the worst part. (He was right, but still, the cops didn't have to know that.)
Jack's entire takeaway from that is just, "'They'?"
She shakes her head. "I don't think so."
Castiel nods. "That's what I thought you'd say."
Castiel shrugs. "I kinda over-exaggerated how likely it was that the Vamps would let us talk,” he says. “
She looks up at Charlie, who gives a nod. She turns her attention back to Dean. "I'm Patience."
Sam ignores him. "Dean's been waiting for Cas to drop everything and check in ever since Bobby told him that Cas is alive."
look. He told Charlie because it explained a lot about what she saw. Jody wasn't there; she doesn't have to know.
"He's 16," Castiel reminds him. "He's old enough to spend a night on the town."
"Dude, have you ever met a teenage girl?" Dean asks. "Hanging out alone with two grown-ass men they don't know with the door closed is
"And that's great and all," Dean says, "but can I go see him?"
"It's not like that," Castiel says.
Castiel groans, but they’ve made it pretty clear that he doesn’t have a choice so he reluctantly shuts up. Wherever they’re going, he hopes it’s somewhere that he doesn’t have to do anything. He’s really not in the mood to pretend he’s having a great day.
"Then how
Charlie scoffs. "I'm not leaving! Look, I'll call 911—"

“No,” Cas says. “It’s not.”
"You meet a girl?" Jo asks with a smirk.
"And you're telling the truth this time?" Charlie asks. "You're not just saying that because you think it's what I want to hear?"

While that doesn't calm her down, she
Though he supposes he doesn’t have to decide now. You know what they say: never do today what you can put off until tomorrow. (It’s him: he’s the “they” that says it.) He pulls the note out and gently places it on his bedside table. He can decide tomorrow.
"Cas, what the
Things like the fact that the person he helped escape the Hunters was none other than Dean Winchester's own brother.
CastieI just cocks an eyebrow and waits for the real answer.
Castiel smiles. He wasn’t really expecting an update on what he’s missed, but he’s glad he got one. It’s nice to see that not everything has fallen apart since he left, and as much as he wishes it hadn’t, it kind of means a lot that everything changed when he left. It means a lot that he was so important in people’s lives that his absence (and Sam’s absence) was so upsetting, though he does feel kind of bad about it.
"I wanted to apologize," Charlie says. "I don't like when we fight. It's weird. When you didn't pick up the phone, I figured you were asleep so I was just gonna leave some apology cupcakes on the table, but..." She shrugs awkwardly. “You’re not asleep. You’re here. As am I.”

Castiel shakes his head and shoots off the first lie he can think of. “Just don’t like having my back to the door for this long.”
CastieI sighs and looks up at him. "You're killing me, kid."
"In the flesh."
"Apparently that was his nephew," Gordon tells her. "He's not here for any kind of legal justice. He wouldn't have brought Winchester if he was."
"Cas…"
He's not going.

it so readily.
"You did not!" Gabriel practically yells it. "You never once said the word "dibs."

Castiel tosses it to him, and Dean catches it with ease. "I'm not your mom; do it yourself."

CastieI pulls the phone away from his face just enough to check the screen. It looks like someone picked up. He's not sure why they're not saying something, though. He's not sure he wants to be the first one to speak. Unfortunately, he's not sure he has a choice.
"Because if they knew they had a picture of you, they'd never stop looking for you," Castiel says. "At least if they think you're just an ordinary Hunter, they'll give up in a few weeks and move on."
"It wasn't a gang at the time. It was…" He gestures vaguely, trying to find the right word. "It was kind of a family. Just 10 or 15 of us in an abandoned office building, and we took care of each other. Everyone was fed, everyone was clothed, everyone was loved.
he’s ready to go.
“I’m sure Bill Hickock thought the same thing,” Dean remarks. “‘Those who don’t know history’ and all that.”
"Or Elizabeth Olsen," they add. "It's probably Lizzie." They give a wistful sigh. "Love of my life."
, and the only way I could get you to talk to me was sneaking up when you weren’t paying attention?”
“It was pretty loud so I’m not
Castiel presses his lips into a firm line. He'd known she would pick up on that and he'd assumed she'd ask, but it doesn't make it any easier to be in this situation. The fact that Dean is lying through his teeth doesn't help, either. It's better than admitting that Jack and Claire killed them, he supposes, but it still doesn't help.
Castiel turns his attention back to her, and his friend takes their eyes off the road for a few seconds to give him a puzzled glance. Castiel just cocks an eyebrow. He doesn’t want to have this conversation at all, but if he has to, it’s not starting with a question as vague as “what the fuck?”
"Love you, too," Jack says. It's a casual remark and he clearly doesn't think much of it, but it means a lot to Castiel. It's something he can carry with him to get him through the day.
Castiel hesitates. He really only agreed to this because Jack didn't want to walk back alone. He'd gone under the assumption that he'd address Dean directly once they got here, but the more he thinks about it, the less certain he is.
"I'm sure Cas is watching over him," Mary says. "Cas wouldn't let him play God alone."
look rather comfortable. He has to be careful how he lies down with his cuts and he said his ankle hurt too much to move his leg, but he seems to have figured it out.
"Why?" Jody asks. "He was a Hunter once, wasn't he? And it certainly sounds like he would have been part of 'your crew' back then. Maybe they'll buy it."
"This wonderful new thing called 'the internet,'" Sam replies. Funny enough, that's basically the same answer he got when he asked how Dean found his apartment. Maybe the internet is too powerful... "I know this is really out-of-the-blue, but I don't know who else I could ask. Have you heard from Dean lately?"
"No, it's Leia!" Charlie insists.
He feels a little better after that. At least now Dean knows why he won't show up. He'd like to think that means he won't retaliate because of it.
“This is gang-related and I can’t take this case,” Castiel interrupts, keeping his voice as level as possible. She doesn’t have to know anything else. If she tells him this man is a Hunter, she’ll take him off the case, and that’s that.
"God, me the fuck too," Charlie mutters. "You ready to do some prep work?"
Jody looks at Charlie. "Did you know any of this?"
"One night out with a bunch of people who

CastieI stares at them. "You really waited through half the movie just to point out that she's pregnant? As if that hadn't been established forever-and-a-half ago?"
"What, no kiss?" Dean asks with a playful smirk.
Dean crosses his arms. “What, Cas? It’s a simple question.”
Dean that he can't go. At least then he wouldn't just be blowing the guy off. Dean would (probably?) understand if he knew. It's not like Castiel can just text him and explain, though. He has absolutely no idea how to reach him. He doesn't have a phone number, an email, even an address…
"That it is," CastieI replies.
He and Jody head back to the interrogation room, where Dean is back to sitting calmly at the table with his hands clasped in front of him. This time, he doesn't smile when Castiel steps inside. Hell, he barely gives the man a glance. His attention is focused on Jody instead
Dean decides against arguing. He’s still not too eager to see how tonight’s family dinner goes, but at least it should get his mind off Cas for a while. That’s what he needs right now: a distraction.
"You're really just taking his word for it?" Claire says skeptically though she adds another chip nonetheless.
Dean just nods solemnly.
Eventually they reach the playground and Claire hops out of the moving car even before it’s stopped, her bag of candy in hand. Dean parks the car and follows her, and it doesn’t take long for him to catch sight of Jody and her husband. Claire and Owen are the only two on the playground, both sitting under the monkey bars as Claire rifles through her bag of candy. Those two seem to be doing just fine on their own, so Dean makes his way to Jody and her husband instead. He hopes this isn’t considered third-wheeling.
"And you'd rather lose me," Dean finishes.
"Answer it," Charlie urges him. "If it's a spam call, I wanna mess with them."
Jenny hesitates, then gives a single nod. "But if he gets mad, it was your idea, not mine."
because
"I do — err,
The next half an hour or so is so boring, it’s barely worth mentioning. Jody briefly explains “the plan” (though in reality, “the plan” is just Dean doing whatever the fuck he wants to do and then telling the rest of the cops to come), and the ten or so officers that are coming listen intently. Dean looks as bored as Castiel feels, and Castiel wishes he could subtly make his way over to the man and strike up a separate conversation. It’s not like Dean would go for it even if he did, but he still wishes he could.
Castiel nods solemnly. Maybe one of the Vamps will explain, even if it means cutting a deal with one of them. Patience deserves to know what happened to her.
Castiel doesn’t get the chance to talk to Dean until they’re suiting up to go pay the Vamps a visit. Castiel runs out to the car to grab his duffel bag, and he returns to find Jody trying to show Dean how to put on a bulletproof vest, a very amused Sam standing back and watching. He’s still not happy about this, but he couldn’t get Dean or Jody to back down, so he at least insisted he get the opportunity to stay until it’s over. He doesn’t say it aloud, but it’s clear he just wants to see if Dean comes back alive or in a body bag.
“Hmm, that’s fair,” Charlie says. “So, it looks like Jody’s going after the Hunters now. How’s that feel?”
The next morning, he wakes up alone.
“What do you mean, what am I doing here?” she asks. “I’m dead, remember? The real question is what are
The last option had been more of a sarcastic take on the situation, but when he realizes the sounds he hears from above appear to be sobs, he actually starts to take that one seriously. He has absolutely no idea what to expect and he knows he won’t be a welcome surprise, but maybe if whoever up there is a Hunter, they can tell Dean about these letters when they get the chance. And if it’s not a Hunter, as long as they’re not in another gang, he can probably just leave the letters here anyway.
“No, seriously, what the fuck does that mean?” Charlie asks. “Like, I’m sorry, I know I said I wasn’t gonna bother you about this anymore, but, like, what the fuck?”
“Dean?”
people are probably staring at us," Castiel says, as if people hadn't been staring at them already.
He can't even imagine how this sounds to her. Throwing in a disclaimer that he rarely talks to any of the Hunters would probably just make it sound
It doesn't take long to break them, and the real answer in question is, "You just seemed sad today, and I figured the two best cures to sadness are sweets and friendship, so I decided to give you both."
That's an impressively close estimate of how long he's been here. They're legally required to let him go after 48 hours if they don't have anything on him, though with the weapons charge, Castiel's not sure that applies. He opts not to mention it.
"He likes reading
— there was a chance anyway.
"You're a natural-born leader," Castiel insists. "You've never thought —"
"No one," Castiel interrupts, keeping his voice as level as he can. It works surprisingly well. "You're here for a reason. Do your thing and disappear. It's what you do best."
"Neither are you," Dean reminds him. "You're just a near-stranger who happens to share some of his DNA."
Dean glares at them.
When Castiel told Dean “goodbye,” he’d been certain it would last

Charlie pulls out a small bottle of Advil, a proud smile on her face. "Drugs!"
Gordon narrows his eyes. He considers that for a moment, and Dean smirks. Castiel can just

Castiel rolls his eyes. "Go." He jumps to his feet and tugs on Dean's arm. "There. Now." He nods towards the closet with his head.

, he mouths before hurrying back to Dean’s side. He wishes he could do more right now. He wishes she knew they weren’t in this alone, that there’s a dozen police officers not too far away just waiting for the cue to come in. They’ll help her. It’s just going to take
"Winchester —" Jody says, clearly on her last nerve.
Charlie perks up at that. "Yeah, 'course!"
That is final.
"Maybe that's worth it," Charlie says. "I mean, if the alternative is dying —"
Finally, Castiel settles on, "Did you hear about the shooting at Target yesterday? It's all over the news here. They have a picture of the guy's face but I can't think of his name for the life of me. Maybe you can help."
“Oh, no, he’s actually gone,” Dean says. “Went to college, became a lawyer.”
"So," Sam says, "are you ready?"
And wait.
. He doesn’t know how they’ve gone 12 years without this even crossing his mind, but now, he doesn’t want to stop.
"And yet, here we are, twice in one day," Dean says. "It's amazing what can happen when I put my mind to it, isn't it?"
Dean is sitting at the table, his cuffed hands resting in his lap and his feet up on the table. He'd just looked
It’s really Cas.
Mostly.
But then Dean surprises him.
“Welcome back, brother,” Benny adds, not an ounce of sincerity in his voice. “You always know how to brighten up a room.”

a grocery store in that they can just walk in and take whatever they want whenever they want it, but it gives off the same vibes as a grocery store and it has pie, so Dean's not too concerned about the terminology.
"You guess correctly," Dean says. "Is she here?"
"Hey, what's wrong with McDonald's?" Dean asks indignantly.
Ben takes a slice of coffee cake and puts it in the same container as the lemon loaf cake. “Anything else?”
Dean scoffs, and to say he looks surprised would be an understatement. “
A week passes and Cas still hasn't come by. Every time Dean brings it up — usually to Sam but occasionally to others as well — he's hit with the reminder that they haven't seen Jack either. He thinks it's supposed to be reassuring, but the fact that Cas and Jack are likely out there changing the world doesn't do much to quell his disappointment about Cas's continued absence.
future — now that he has the chance.
"And he's been with you the whole goddamn time?" Dean demands. His grip on Castiel's arms tightens. "
. Dean still doesn’t trust him. He flat-out admitted it. Shouldn’t he be a little more wary about inviting a cop back into the fold? He’s eager to have him back but wouldn’t even let Jack talk about what was bothering him. This doesn’t seem particularly well-thought-out.
“So, what happened?” Dean asks. “Last time I was in Purgatory, I heard you were dead -- or, you know, more dead than usual.”
"He's destroying my entire house," Charlie says. "
He makes a mental note to look into pet care later. Right now, his goal is really to just wind down with some TV. It's not as enticing after a good day as it is when everything else sucks, but he's sure he'll enjoy it nonetheless.

Knowing they'll have to do it all over again another day is harder.
If this is Dean's idea of teasing, that's just another strike against this. "Goodbye, guys."
"Well, congrats; that's as Dean Winchester as you can get," CastieI says. "Why are you telling

accept this chocolate as a thank you,’ and then he just walked away.” He adds, more apologetically, “I didn’t think to follow him. I was too worried about Sarah to think straight. I have no idea where he went.”
"He used it on Sam," Castiel tells him. "Asking for legal advice, I think. I don't know. He wouldn't let me stick around." In fact, other than asking for Sam's number, Dean didn't want anything to do with him after he made his deal with Jody. He took this whole "Jack has been staying at Castiel's place" thing a lot harder than Lucifer did (probably because it inadvertently got
Sam chuckles. “Yeah, that’s true. Alright, see you around, Cas.”
Dean shakes his head. “Never mind.” Changing the subject before she can look too much into it, he says, “It’s really nice to see you again, Charlie. I’ll drag Sam by when we get the chance.”
“You --” Dean cuts himself off with a sigh. “Do you know where he wants to talk to me? Or when?”
Castiel takes the letter and slips it in his pocket. To Dean, he says, "You read it?"
Sam rolls his eyes. "Thanks, Cas. That was exactly what I meant."
With no other viable choice, Castiel reluctantly nods. "Yeah, that was his brother."
"I'm not doing it to help Dean," Castiel says. "Hell, if I'm being totally honest, I'm not doing it for the good of the city or whatever, either. I have a personal vendetta against the Vamps, and now I have a legal way to get revenge." He gives an exaggeratedly sweet smile.
Castiel sighs. “I told you, there’s more to it than that.”
"He really wasn't any of that," Castiel says. "He was just…" He shrugs. "A guy." He glances over to see her gaping at him. He guesses he can't really blame her. For a guy no one's really seen, Dean
Castiel heads back to meet with the people watching the "interrogation." It's just Jody and the two agents on the case — Ryan and Esposito — sitting back there, and the first thing he hears is a confused, "You have a nephew?" from Ryan, because
By the time he finishes reading, there’s a tear in his eye. He puts the note down and wipes it away. He’s so glad he decided not to read it until Dean was out of the picture, because he’s not sure he would have had the strength to stay away if he hadn’t. He’s almost tempted to write a letter back and leave it in the abandoned office building anyway. He wants to tell them that he loves them and that he misses them and that he’s so sorry he never told them he was going to leave.
The rest of the walk to the car is silent. Castiel appreciates that. He’s a little too shaken up right now to hold a real conversation. What the
“And call it a hunch,” Castiel adds, “but I have a feeling that even if they did, they wouldn’t look much into it. Hell, maybe a little birdie would tell them it was probably infighting among the Vamps and they’d turn their sights on you guys.” He shrugs innocently. “I

Charlie hesitates, then nods. “Fine, I’ll be your mail carrier -- but I really don’t want to, so you two better not die.”

Castiel chuckles. "Alright, here." He answers the call and puts it on speaker, holding the phone out between them. "Detective Novak speaking." He figures it's probably worth starting with that in case it really
“Oh, sure.” Jack takes them and puts them in his pocket. “Now c’mon. They’re right over here.”
"He's Cas," Lucifer says with a shrug. "If anyone's gonna know when Dean's bullshitting us, it'll be the guy who's seen him, like, three times in the last 13 years." Though the words are sarcastic, he says them genuinely. Castiel can't help but wonder if his faith is misplaced. It
Dean glances back to see Claire hanging upside-down off the monkey bars, a lollipop in her mouth. Owen stands in front of her, laughing way too hard in the way that children love to do.
"Oh." Castiel looks down at them uncertainly. While he doesn't necessarily approve of armed robbery, he can see where the guy’s coming from.
"I hope so," Jack agrees. "Otherwise I'm gonna have to avoid mirrors for the rest of my life."
, man?
Castiel reaches into the bottom pockets of his trenchcoat. Nothing there. He slips his hands into his pants pockets, and his right hand clasps around a little piece of metal. He pulls it out and looks at it. It's a nice paperclip. It's a good thing he has a million more.
Before Castiel gets roped into a conversation about his sex hair (whatever the fuck that means), Jody pulls him aside for a private conversation. He's not sure this is any better than talking about his so-called sex hair, but at least he gets a wide variety of uncomfortable experiences.
"You know," Dean remarks, eyeing the lettuce in his brother's carriage, "you can stop eating that shit now. You don't have to be healthy anymore. It's not like you have a body or whatever."
Gordon rolls his eyes. “Alright, alright, keep it in your pants.”
When Dean makes it up there, he steps to the side, letting Castiel up as well. He gestures in front of him, and Castiel looks ahead, confused.
Castiel sighs. Scratch that; make it three envelopes. He takes the note from his brothers to the table as well and unfolds it. He wants to remember everything they said when he writes back to them. He has a feeling this will be the last time he ever gets to do that. Hell, he’ll be lucky if Dean even decides to give them the note after what he just did.
"I think he might change his mind if I let you die," CastieI says, "accident or not."
"It'll feel like that at first," Castiel says, "but then you'll move on. You'll make something new for yourself, and you and them will be just fine."
without any new cases, but it's always a possibility.

"It was…"
She pulls up the footage and skims through until she finds the right time stamp. From this angle, it’s impossible to see who’s at the other self-checkout registers, but register one is in plain sight, as is Nathan, who walks in and out of the frame as he paces back and forth. The first minute or so is just the cashier -- Sarah, apparently -- ringing up a mother with her two kids running in and out of the frame. Sarah gives them each a row of stickers, and they seem overjoyed.
right now. Not enough to have him sobbing on the floor, thankfully, but he will admit, he feels pretty close to it.
The soft clinking of crutches alerts him to Jack’s presence before he sees the kid. “What’re you doing?”
"Oh, shit, you did," she breathes. "God, I totally forgot. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother—"
Castiel takes his hand off his gun. "What do you want to show me?"
’ me,” Dean snaps. “Do you know how many times I prayed to you? Actually, no, don’t answer that. Of course you know how many times I prayed to you. You always do, which means you

He'd never thought about what this must be doing to Dean. He lost his brother and his partner on the same day, and from the looks of it, if he'd ever found a replacement for Castiel, it was only temporary. He's been an obnoxiously endearing mix of cocky and flirtatious over the last few weeks. CastieI had never even questioned whether there was more going on in his brain than what his lighthearted facade let on. This conversation seems to answer that unspoken question with a very emphatic "yes."
Castiel instinctively drops his arm from the old man, his other hand slapping itself on top of the wound. That, of course, only makes it worse, and he groans. It was just a graze, thank god, but it hurts like a son of a bitch.
"That was
was taking care of him.
"If you were just pretending tonight, then you're a hell of an actor," Dean tells him.
Jack narrows his eyes. "That's not fair."
Castiel sighs and drops his hand. "I don't know. I just…" He runs a hand through his hair. "I don't want to make this harder than it has to be."
Charlie moves aside so the young girl and the two men can all see each other clearly. The girl is still seated, though now seemingly of her own free will. The restraints that had held her limbs down are gone, though the marks they left on her dark skin remain. In Charlie's hand is a towel stained in dirt and blood, and it appears it be the one that had been used as a gag. Now, it's serving its real purpose: cleaning.
There comes a point when Dean stops mentioning Cas entirely. He knows he’ll just get the same response, a little more exasperated each time, and it never makes him feel any better. That doesn’t stop him from thinking about Cas, though, as much as he wishes he could. There's one thing in particular that's been bugging him over the past couple of days, and, finally, he decides he has to ask.

CastieI forces a smile for that attempt at a joke, but his heart isn't in it. He hates keeping secrets from her, but even if he’d wanted to, he wouldn’t be able to explain everything. Even just answering
Castiel gives him a small smile. “Thanks, Sam. Hopefully I’ll see you in an hour or two.”
Cas sighs, and when he speaks, his voice is quiet, full of emotion that Dean can’t read. “Jack, will you give us a minute?”
"You are not
CastieI chuckles half-heartedly. "That obvious?"

Castiel awkwardly hugs him back. He should probably enjoy this while it lasts. He's not sure Lucifer's going to be too happy with him after this. Between stealing Jack away and inadvertently getting Dean arrested, there’s a lot to talk about that will probably turn his brother against him.
CastieI cracks a smile at that in spite of himself. To Jack, he says, "I'm glad you're okay, at least."
CastieI looks down at his hands. He hadn't realized Dean had noticed him wearing it. He definitely hadn't expected Dean to notice he

“Castiel?” Jack calls from the living room. “Shouldn’t you be leaving in a minute?”
"Dude moves quick," Dean says with a small smile. He was wondering how long it would take to get to see the guy again. When Bobby told him that Cas had someone made it out alive… well, he doesn't know
Castiel winces at that, glancing down at Charlie almost instinctively. That was a little too much information, venturing into territory that Charlie was never supposed to see. She's masking her emotions surprisingly well, which would be fine if it didn't leave him in the dark about how she feels about him now. He's sure she has a

Castiel rolls his eyes. "Uh-huh." He files that idea in the back of his head, though, just in case. "Did you listen in?"
“But…” Jack cocks his head to the side. “But you get to see all your friends again. You even get to see Sam again even though he outlives you by, like, 30 years. This is -- well, it
"Nah, she's passed out on my bed," Castiel replies. "I doubt she'll wake up for a few hours."
Cas isn’t here. Benny is. That’s what matters.
"No, but —"
"Dean…" Castiel shoots him a warning look.
“Get him, like, four more things,” Charlie says.
CastieI cocks his head to the side. "'Course I will. Why wouldn't I be?"
"I think it's cute," Jack says.
That one earns a real smile, and though he's clearly still upset, he seems to find that concept at least a little amusing.

Castiel puts an arm around him for support, and together, they make the very long, very slow journey to the bathroom. CastieI helps him all the way to the toilet, then quietly excuses himself to give Jack some privacy. He closes the door and awkwardly stands outside. Well, this is fun.

Dean takes a deep breath, trying to prepare himself for an answer he’s not sure he wants. “Did you ever tell Cas that you loved him?”
Sam groans, exasperated, and Dean just laughs. Charlie plops down next to him, remote in hand, and Dorothy sits on her other side. Sam sighs and takes a seat on the floor in front of them, and it’s
CastieI gives his brothers an apologetic smile, but he can't help feeling bad. They look so heartbroken. This wasn't the big reunion he'd sure they'd hoped for — it sure as hell isn't for him — but at least he knows that Jack has the notes for them. He's not

Most of the house is empty -- or, at least, the parts that Castiel can see as they’re walking by. In the hallway, Dean elbows Castiel in the ribs, and when Castiel shoots him an annoyed look, Dean nods at a door that’s slightly ajar. Castiel takes a few subtle steps back and looks inside, where a young girl is tied to a chair, her hair soaked in sweat and her face covered in blood. She makes eye contact with him, and though the gag over her mouth prevents her from trying to say something, the look in her eyes is enough to convey her thoughts: she’s fucking scared.
“I don’t want to be unboringed,” Casitel whines.
thought he was gone for all that.” He puts an arm around Castiel’s shoulders and puts their heads together. “He loves me too much to leave.”
"I just wanted someone to know everything," Castiel says. "I'm keeping too many secrets from too many people, and that would be a pretty shitty way to die."
— I know your brothers are two of the most important people in your life. Don't you want to know what they said?"
Dean chuckles. “Here for good, it looks like.”
Castiel lets out a long breath. Well, that’s a loaded question. "I guess just that the opportunity presented itself." It's true to a point, though there was much more to it than that.
"I know," Jack says. "But maybe this time I should. Maybe it's time I got out."
Logically, Dean knows that Claire lived to be 76 and is actually older than he is, but she still looks and acts like the same 20-something-year-old he knows and loves and he can’t help but treat her as such. He asks her a lot of questions -- and he’s almost surprised she doesn’t tell him off for them -- and he genuinely enjoys hearing the answer. She never got married; she adopted a couple kids as she got older and couldn’t hunt anymore -- “paying it forward,” she’d called it -- and she managed to reconnect with Kaia in Heaven, which she seems pretty excited about.
Castiel stands up and crosses his arms, shooting him a glare. "You're a pain in the ass. You know that, right?"
“Do you have a video of the shooting?” Charlie asks.
"You know that kid that killed Connor and Dale?" Gordon asks quietly.
"If you get out like this, you might end up in jail."
While Jack eats, Castiel turns on the TV. It's still paused halfway through

decided you didn’t want to deal with it.”
"Hi, CastieI!" Jack pauses his show. "How was work?" He asks that every day, and usually he gets an honest one- or two-word answer.
Castiel just watches her go, frozen. He's not sure what he's expected, but this definitely wasn't it. And the fact that she knows that it was Jack who killed the Vamps (or, technically,
He gets up to check who it is anyway. If it's Dean — something he wouldn't have considered until Jack showed up, but now it feels like a reasonable fear — and he doesn't think anyone is home, he'll probably pick the lock and come in anyway. That would be pretty difficult to explain to Charlie.
“His dad must be a great person if he raised a son like Jack,” Charlie says.
"Sure you will, buddy," Jenny says sarcastically. "Sure you will."
Instead, it lasts a week.
Cheryl is already inside, working with one of the computers. Nathan introduces them, and they all shake her hand because unfortunately, as interested as Castiel is in watching this video (he’s always found things like this fascinating; it’s part of the reason he loves this job so much), chivalry is more important.
"Take it," Dean says. "Read it when you get the chance. It's cute."
“Right, I am
"Well,
Castiel almost finds himself wanting to meet these newcomers. He’s especially curious about this Meg person. He’s rather fond of most people who drive Dean “up the fucking wall,” as Gabriel so elegantly phrased it, as long as no one (except Dean’s mental state) gets hurt in the process. He’d like to think he and Meg would get along well.
"Cas!"
Castiel cracks a smile. "You sound like such a dad," he says quietly.
"And don't you dare 'it's not you, it's me' me," Dean says.
"Sounds lame," Dean says.

If all goes well, this should be the last time Castiel has to sneak into this godforsaken office building. It was never truly a nice place, but it’s really gone to shit over the last decade and a half. This is where most of the Hunters were staying when Castiel first joined the gang, and every time he comes back, he’s struck by some bittersweet memories.
Castiel cocks an eyebrow. "You've never seen

that was not Dean Winchester?” Charlie asks as soon as they’ve left the store. “Like, completely, 100-percent positive? No room for doubt? It really wasn’t…?”
“I know,” Sam says sympathetically. “But there’s no point in sitting around waiting for him when there are so many other people around.”
CastieI knew this was coming, but that doesn't make it any easier. "Where would you like me to start?"
— I suggest you tell me
one of them.
“Probably not,” Dean says. Their whole adventure with Chuck is going to make a great story someday, but it hits a little too close to home at the moment. Right now, what matters is that they took care of him. He’s living out his worst life on Earth, and then he’s heading straight to Hell, and there’s no way Rowena’s letting him off easy down there.
"Trust me," Dean mutters, "he's changed a lot."
Dean lets out a low whistle. "That’s not quite what I had in mind when I closed your curtains, but if you're that excited, by all means, we can do it here instead."
Castiel states at her, eyes wide. What the
This time when they lapse into silence, it's much less comfortable. Castiel drums his fingers on the steering wheel absentmindedly as he drives. Logically he knows it isn't filling the space, but at least it
"So what?" Dean asks. "She can come back later."
"Oh, no, I'm still mad," Dean says, and Castiel's heart deflates. "But god
“And Dean?” Charlie adds, louder this time. She looks around for him, and he knocks on her window to get his attention. She rolls the window down to talk to him. “You’re supposed to be a couple, remember? If you keep giving him the silent treatment, you’re going to get yourselves killed. Now, I really don’t care what happens to you, but I want my partner to come out of this alive.”
"Right, of course," she says sarcastically. "That's — that's great." She takes a deep breath before speaking again. "Do I even need to tell you that I'm taking you off this case, or is that a given?"
There are no new cases to work on, so Castiel and Charlie sit at their desks, dotting the i's and crossing the t's of some old cases. They've yet to find a break in a case, but that hasn't stopped them from making calls and sending emails in a lame attempt to accomplish something.
It's been weeks, Cas. I would've hoped you'd at least stop by to say 'hi.'
Castiel has barely processed the painful throbbing of his back when another goes off, this time from Dean’s gun. The first shot made him drop his guard; the second one does the opposite. He tightens his grip on the old man again. He's not letting him out of his grasp until the cops are hauling him away.
"Wait, what?"
"Guess you should come back later and try again," Castiel replies.

"No, I can't," Jack says.

"Fair point," Dean says. He flips over the first three cards. "And we're back."
“Nice to finally meet you,” Dean says, offering a hand for Sean to shake.
"I'm not telling him tonight," CastieI says. "I don't want to get his hopes up if it doesn't work out, and I don’t want to worry him, either. I guess someone else would have to tell him what happened if I don't go home."
Castiel smiles. Maybe this

," Castiel reminds him.
The next week or so goes smoothly. Things are pretty calm, and with no new murders to look into, Castiel and Charlie continue looking at old leads. They actually think they solve a case from a year ago, and now they’re just looking for more evidence before they act on it. Overall, it’s a pretty productive week, and Castiel is feeling a lot better in every sense of the word.
She shakes her head. "I won't believe it if I don't see it. Hell, I barely believe he's okay now and I
Jody smiles sheepishly. “Well, you know, if you’d stop getting way in over your head…”

“Hi, welcome to Braedon’s Bakery!” the boy greets them. “My name’s Ben, and that’s my mom, Lisa.” He points at the woman in the back with his thumb, and she gives a small wave before turning her attention back to her work. “What can I help you with?”

And then a dot appears on his head, doubtlessly a bullet wound, though it’s difficult to see it too well with this shitty camera quality. He calls to the ground, and once again, Sarah screams. This poor girl is going to need
much effort into payback for one rude remark, even at Jack's expense.
CastieI gives him a small smile. "So if you want to talk, I've got nowhere to be. If you just want me to leave, that's fine, too."
Jack's eyes flicker open and he starts to sit up, but as soon as he makes the mistake of moving his foot, he lies back down. He turns his head to look at CastieI and gives him a small, tired smile. "'Morning."
So that's what he does. He heads to the car, tosses his duffel bag in the back seat, and then he's off to Charlie's. The air is somber as he drives them to the station. They don't talk much. There's not much to talk
He's kinda curious about what Dean wants to show him, though…
no jobs in Heaven. Still, she doesn’t seem to mind, so he doesn’t mention it.
"Mm, sure you were." Dean boops him on the nose. "So, can I hitch a ride?"
Mary puts a hand on his back and he flinches involuntarily. She looks up at him, concerned. "Dean, honey, are you okay?"
Charlie rushes to her side. "What's wrong?"
"Well, then maybe you only save one or two lives," they say. "That's still worth

wasn’t expecting to run into you here."
"If you don't, that's fine," Castiel says. "I can wait 'til I get home."
Dean cracks a small smile and lowers his gun to his side. "'Til next time."
"Then maybe it's not supposed to stick," Dean says. "Maybe we're supposed to be together. Did you ever think of that?"
"I'll take that as a 'yes,'" he says. "Alright, gimme your phones." He walks over and pats the counter. "Put 'em here. All of you. You can have 'em back when we're gone."

him thinking about it. He's so close. He just needs to say "yes."
"But then I'd have to deal with your dad,"  CastieI says.
"Oh, I know," Sam says. "Dean told me what he's doing, and he wouldn't listen when I told him it was stupid. I'm just hoping he'll listen to me in person because
The first few minutes of the ride are dead silent. Every now and then, Castiel glances over at his partner or in the rearview mirror at Dean. Occasionally Charlie meets his eye and gives him a small reassuring smile, which Castiel returns only as long as she can see it. Meanwhile, Dean doesn’t even look at him once. Sometimes he stares out the window; other times his gaze is on his hands, fidgeting in his lap.
spoonful of ice cream before Castiel has even dipped his spoon in the thing. She grimaces and, with her mouth still full of food, mumbles a pained, "This was a bad idea."

CastieI scoffs. "Yeah, I can get you something — more swears and sarcasm." Hell, he's not even sure he can get

What's that outside the window?
CastieI cocks his head to the side. He wasn't exactly expecting a response of "Pinky promise?" like he would have given as a toddler, but this is arguably just as surprising. The Hunters are — or

It's probably true, but still.

"Fine, we don't have to," Charlie says. "If you wanna go home in silence —"
Though he's much more tired now than he was when he went to sleep, he reluctantly sits up and turns his alarm off. Admittedly, he's more motivated by the empty spot on the bed next to him than he is by the prospect of going to work, but anything to get him up is probably for the best.
Charlie glances down at it. “Depends on what it is.”
Who else will he find here? Charlie? She's gotta be around here somewhere, and after how she went out — and the fact that it wasn't supposed to be her fight to begin with — Dean feels like he owes her an apology.  And, as nice as it was to see the other-dimension Charlie, it only served as a reminder of how much he missed his little sister.
Tuesday is pretty uneventful. The trial continues, further proving to Castiel that this murderer is going to serve some time in the slammer. The hearing will last another day, but the verdict is obvious. The dude's guilty. End of story.
That's exactly the wrong conclusion Castiel had hoped they'd reach. It's nice to see that he didn't have to nail that one in.

"I would gladly help anyone out of the Hunters that wants my help," CastieI says. "I'd like to think my job is to help people in any way I can." The Supreme Court would disagree — supposedly he has no obligation to protect and serve — but the Supreme Court is a bunch of jackasses, anyway. He'll make his own job description, thank you
Castiel leans down so his lips are almost touching the other man's ear. He'd rather the cops know he has an unspecified secret than know the details. "He's at my place."
"They know where you are," Castiel repeats.
CastieI and Charlie celebrate day one of a successful trial with a trip to the local ice cream parlor. It's a small one and he's pretty sure most people in the city have no idea it even exists, but that just means they get the building to themselves.

doesn't know the guy's actual name. They basically all call him their ‘old man’ even though he was, like, 12 when he started the gang." The idea of Benny calling a guy at least a decade younger than him “old man” in complete sincerity will never stop being entertaining. It's probably the only thing to come out of that gang that Castiel doesn't completely hate.
much trouble if Jody hears about this. It's not like there's much he can do about it now, though, so he reluctantly takes a seat by Dean's side. He sits up straight, every muscle in his body tensed. Dean is much more casual; he puts an arm around Castiel's shoulders and leans against him, almost
owe this to his friend. "I'm sorry for snapping at you. You had every reason to be upset, and I'm sorry for overreacting like that."
"If I ignore her, she'll probably just walk right in," Castiel says. He gave her a key to his place years ago, which speaks volumes about their friendship.
After a few moments of deliberation, he just says, "Fine."
"I can get you the Vamps," Dean repeats, his gaze still on the mirror. "They hurt my kid and let him live to tell the tale. Trust me, they're gonna let me in, and we can take them down."
CastieI groans. God, why him? Why does

in his free time. Castiel wonders every time he comes home to the sound of the Scooby Gang talking whether the boy remembers watching it when he was little with Dean and Casitel. He was so young, it’s hard to believe he does. CastieI remembers, though, and it's enough to bring a smile to his face on a shitty day like today.
“Yeah, well, surprise, your death didn’t stick,” Dean deadpans. “It never does. That’s never stopped you from coming back before.”
It seems Dean comes to the same conclusion, because he reads the address aloud. Though he sounds judgemental, Castiel knows he's just telling the cops. "Not a lot of space, but it's pretty; I'll give you that."
"Much," Castiel replies. "I think I just needed a very long nap." He told her that yesterday, too, but apparently that wasn't enough. It's nice to know she cares that much, at least.
Castiel snorts. “Oh, I’m sure.” The old man can play as dumb as he wants, but Castiel is sure he knew that his men attacked a Hunter, and he’s sure the old man didn’t give a damn about anything but the possible consequences. Castiel holds out a hand. “‘Til next time.”
“I did,” Benny says. “He didn’t stay and chat long; something about the kid he was with.”

"And you got another one up here," Ellen adds, lifting her bottle of beer as if for a toast. "Now grab a drink and sit down. I wanna hear some stories."
"Sorry, it didn't feel as important when I was, you know,

"But there were two Vamps outside when we left and Alex tried to stop us — she recognized them 'cause that kidnapped her a few years after you left but she made it back eventually — but Claire and I were already outside and the Vamps saw us and the Vamps saw

Charlie clenches her jaw. Though she's clearly not happy about this, she's far less hostile when she asks, "What did he want with you?"

mad enough to gamble with my life," CastieI says. After what they did to Alex and Jack, he would like nothing more than to watch each and every one of them escorted into the station in handcuffs. "Someone's gotta take care of the Vamps, and this is the best shot we've ever had."

Outside of the house, a number of cop cars are parked, each one with red and blue lights flashing. The ambulance hasn't arrived yet, so Charlie instructs Patience to sit on the front steps while they wait and she’s more than happy to oblige.
are you in bed?”
Castiel shrugs half-heartedly. "I devolved with them, I guess. I didn't think I had much of a choice.” He forces himself to perk up as he adds, “And then one day I left; took some money, bought myself a college education, and now here I am."

“Did he say anything?” Charlie asks.
“And now you get to see what Cas and I have been up to!” Jack adds. “Isn’t this place great? It’s everything you ever wanted, right?”
, you gotta tell me this one thing. Did you like them or not? Because I feel like this is something I should really know if we’re going to be fighting crime in a city populated by your ex-gang-members.”
Castiel shoots her a playful glare.
“Benny and I may not have gotten along very well,” Cas says, “but he’s a good man. He had a chance at redemption and he took it. He deserved this.”
"So you're gonna stick around?".
“Oh, trust me,” Jo says, “we know that much.”

"If you think of anything, let me know," he says, and she just nods.
Castiel nods once. “That’s fair.” He’s not going to fight that. He can pretty much tell that he and Claire will never have a bonding experience even close to the type he and Jack had. He can tell she doesn’t

"Like my brothers," CastieI replies. He turns his attention to Jack just so she doesn't have the chance to ask any more questions. "Are you sure you don't want to tell them? Especially if you're staying here for a few days. They're gonna be worried sick."
CastieI bites his lip. He doesn't like how they're leaving this. If there's something they could do to stop the Vamps and they don't, he's never going to forgive himself. He sure as hell didn't need Dean to remind him of that, but the fact that he did doesn’t make it any easier.

“Of course,” Nathan says. “I’d been watching self-checkout for about 20 minutes, covering one of the other team members’ breaks. The only two cashiers at the time were minors, so I kept looking back to make sure no one needed help ringing up alcohol. I just happened to look back when some
