He’s going to throw up, he really is.
Hope you guys enjoyed this!!! There's much more to come (2 chapters more I believe) I'm not sure how often I can post but I will see how my schedule goes... heh
But is John?
“It’s quite important, Sherlock,” Mycroft continues, “So please do pay attention.”
Sherlock comes first, followed by John, the two of them groaning into the shared space of their mouths before John crumples, tumbling forwards onto Sherlock’s body.
But Sherlock, I never wanted this, this simplified domesticity - everything. All I wanted was stability and even then I realised that what I really wanted was stability in you. What have I gotten myself into? I feel awful.
“It was absolutely perfect,” he finishes, planting a soft kiss on John’s lips, “Don’t worry your head about it.”
“What do you want?” Sherlock questions back, moving to stand as he walks towards the bars, his feet thudding loudly against the concrete floor.
Chuckling at John’s sudden show of embarrassment, Sherlock grins, slipping the piece of fabric over his head.
Sherlock purrs at the sensation, holding John close as his cock spurts a few more times before slackening against his body.
"We questioned and prodded her! And still - zilch, nada. She had no clue who the other lady was, no clue at all!"
He hadn't needed the room since he'd arrived back from hospital.
, Sherlock thinks. Something about the tone of John’s voice, the utter vulnerability and humanity of it strikes something deep inside of him... Because John can’t be unhappy because of him, not again.
Sherlock’s not entirely sure how appropriate it is to be having sex in a bathtub while one’s wife is going through labour. He feels bad about it for a moment before remembering what Mary has done to the both of them, how unrepentant she had been about hurting either of them and he goes back to not caring.
“John,” Sherlock starts, “We’d better not be going to a hospital-”
“But one afternoon, I saw the reeds rustling by the side of the creek. Thinking that it might be a nesting bird, I went closer to check. But when I parted the reeds, there was this dog there…”
“So wh- why did you do it?” John continues, his chest heaving as he stutters through sobs.
His bedsheet is missing… and so are his clothes.
He’s been trying desperately for the past hour to keep himself from thinking about Sherlock, but nothing has worked, his imagination seemingly determined to convince him that Sherlock is in some trouble or other.
“Well, why not?” Watson persists, fixing him with a steely, determined gaze.
But the moment Moriarty enters into the narrative, one that he definitely doesn’t belong in, it means that Sherlock’s fantasy world will start to crumble.
Something within him breaks at the pride in Magnussen’s voice.
“No. No, of course not,” Cameron insists. His hand has stopped shaking.
Now for the underwear.
“I would love to but…”
Which means that Victor has to be rich, filthy rich.
Sherlock enjoys this time of the evening, has always enjoyed this time of evening. He loves the way the luminous lights cast their beams into the darkness, the way that they seem to set a bright halo on anything they touch. He knows that many consider him a man who has little appreciation for the more artsy side of life, like for nature and scenery. Maybe even John does after he found out that he knew nothing about the solar system. But they’re wrong, they’re so very wrong.
Also, I used episode transcripts by the wonderful
Sherlock hums.
Maybe…
“Well, why was he crying then? If he loved Jemima so much he wouldn’t have just killed her,” John questions.
Sherlock manages a weak smile.
The man is already starting to whimper into his shoulder, his fingers clenching and unclenching around his waist.
Sherlock stares back at his brother, mouth agape, absolutely stunned.
“-as I have often explained before, all emotion is abhorrent to me.”
“Depends on what your idea of real is.”
Sherlock wakes to the sound of soft snoring.
“Yeah, it was because of that and… a few other reasons,” John cuts him off once again, except that his cheeks are now flushed a little pink. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what one of the other ‘reasons’ was and Sherlock dips his head in embarrassment, “One of them being the fact that she gave me a dud thumb drive. That really tested my patience.”
It’s a little after 10 in the morning. They’d both awoken around 9 o’clock, choosing to laze in bed even though Sherlock had known full well that John had work that morning.
Mary smiles at him as if he’s a pet that has just done something particularly clever.
“I win,” Sherlock grins and says, pulling the pillow off John as John proceeds to sit up. It's now his turn to scowl half-heartedly at Sherlock.
Sherlock leans back in his seat, pulling the thumb drive out from the USB port roughly. It doesn’t matter if he “safely removes” it or not, there’s nothing on it.
John flashes him a predatory gaze in response, shucking his pants as Sherlock looks on, his tongue darting out to wet his lip as John is left in nothing but his boxers, a wet patch on the front already visible.
Sherlock sets the kettle on its electric port, flicking the switch, watching as condensation begins to coat the interior of the glass casing. “I think we’re out of Twinings so we’ll just have to use the Lipton bags today,” he adds.
And so very quiet.
But John can only control himself so much, Sherlock knows this.
Shit, John was never meant to find out about that.
Again, no research done. I have no time. School is a bitch haha.
John lets out another loud, hearty laugh, padding over towards the foot of the bed, wrapping his fingers around Sherlock’s ankles.
“I am currently attempting to have a perfectly normal conversation with you...”
, it reads.
1. John deserves the best
It’s John.
White light spills through the lids of his eyes as he sits up, lifting his forehead off of his hand.
“...man to man,” he finishes, staring up at Sherlock as if demanding a response.
“What do you mean?” John mutters, refusing to lift his head off of his arms.
“Alright then,” Lestrade starts, observing the two pieces of paper. “Would you be so kind to reconstruct the crime for us Sherlock?” he sighs, sounding extremely tired and worn out, clearly this case has taken a toll on him. To be fair, Lestrade hasn't had any sleep since this case started.
Sherlock could never have envisioned a scene more perfect than this.
“And yours,” Sherlock finds himself babbling, “I’m yours.”
John finishes the sentence resolutely, as if expecting Sherlock to reply even though he hadn’t actually asked him a question. Sherlock refuses to answer so John takes another deep breath before trying again.
But one thing all the files have in common was that there was definitely a large kitchen knife sticking out of the dark-haired woman’s chest. Apparently, it had been taken from the tenant’s kitchen and was devoid of fingerprints, making it harder for the police to track exactly who had done it.
“Sherlock, god,” is all John says before wrapping his arms around the man, burying his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck as Sherlock’s stiff body relaxes into the embrace, melding with John’s.
John huffs, his brow furrowed in annoyance as he peers up at Sherlock’s ecstatic face.
He closes his eyes as Moriarty continues.
It’ll all be fine.
“You can’t fool me,” he finishes, glaring daggers.
David frowns sadly, his eyes still brimming with tears.
Sherlock as I am typing out this message, either one of us is mere metres away from each other, separated by a thin ceiling of concrete. And I swear to god Sherlock if you don’t start telling me exactly what you’re going on about, I will go down there and have a word or two with you.
In short, he's basically walked into a trap that his subconscious has set for him. And knowing his subconscious, he's probably not going to get out of this one till his brain is satisfied with a sacrifice of emotional upheaval.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, deliberately avoiding eye contact with John as he continues to pick at the pieces of pancake on his plate.
“I hope you’ve prepared something to say to her,” Sherlock says, making his way down the stairs.
He sighs loudly, stretching out on the bed.
“Er, Sherlock,” John starts, voice sounding slightly hesitant.
Falling in love with John had been a scarily slow process. John had stumbled slowly yet surely into his heart, worming his way through his veins the more time he’d spent with him. Sherlock had wrapped his head around the intricacies of John’s personality, delving deeper into John’s heart and soul as he sought after an answer to the mystery that was John Watson, ignoring what his “obsession” was doing to him himself.
and we can cry about it together HAHA
“This is how we end, you and I... Always here, always together.”
“Too deep, Sherlock. Way too deep,” a cold voice rings out from his right.
“Stop this. Just stop it,” Mycroft yells, his voice taking on an angrier tone, “Did you make a list?”
“He was a rubbish big brother,” Sherlock responds, flashing John a wide smile.
John's banging on the door now, begging Sherlock to open up but Sherlock ignores him in favour of burying his face in between his legs, fingers now cupping his ears tightly as he tries desperately to drown out John’s shouts of:
There had been a note sitting innocuously next to the bowl as well.
“It’s alright,” John whispers.
iMessage
“It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes,” he says, technically lying even though there’s a shred of truth in his words. “I’m so much cleverer.”
This is followed by a short bout of silence, interspersed by the heavy breathing of one John Watson.
“I’ll come back when I want to ALRIGHT? ... ... DON’T YOU DARE GUILT TRIP ME, YOU’RE THE ONE WHO’S LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING SO FAR,” John bellows at his phone, fingers gripping it tight. Sherlock notices that his knuckles have gone white.
In fact, he should probably stop thinking about it altogether.
John seems to notice this, wrapping a reassuring arm around Sherlock’s back as he continues.
He can’t say it, not even in his own head…
Sherlock raises his eyes to John’s face, slightly startled, the endearment catching him off guard. He hadn’t noticed the man stirring.
However, there is one thing that is certain. As evidenced by the lack of blood on the bed, the stabbing was clearly something that had been done post-mortem.
“Yapping?” John spouts, his brow furrowing in poorly disguised anger, “Sorry, did we interrupt your session?”
But John is different now, they’re both different now. John’s married and he has proven to be extremely loyal to the ones he loves. Which means that Sherlock has to thank Mary for the fact that he will no longer get any intrusive thoughts of a very naked John having sex with a very naked woman.
John’s naps usually last about an hour or so. Mycroft might very well call before he wakes up but that’ll be better for the both of them, probably. Seeing John, calm and sturdy John jittery will most definitely worsen his nerves.
“I didn’t know you could dance like that! I mean I knew you could waltz, that much I knew... but that! That was another thing altogether!” John gushes, his grin wider than ever as Sherlock averts his gaze, twisting away from John so that he won’t be able to see the blush that he’s certain is riding high on his cheeks.
Well, it’s not him per se. The man sure indeed looks like him but…
“Mary and John, whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on I swear I will always be there. Always.”
“Till death do us part.”
John had done this before, a long time ago. When he’d just arrived back and Sherlock had cooked him breakfast. How times have changed.
, he instinctively thinks as John takes one final sip from his mug before setting it on the coffee table,
And with that, John wraps his fingers around Sherlock’s shaft, pumping his fist hard and fast as Sherlock cries out, spilling onto his fingers.
“Well now, on to the elephant in the room - Moriarty,” Mycroft says, seemingly not having noticed John’s knee-jerk reaction to his mention of Sherlock’s drug use.
John’s eyes fall, transfixed on the pavement for a beat before he raises his head once again. He nods his head in Sherlock’s direction, a solid, controlled movement, before taking off for the cab.
Is John deliberately ignoring the issue because it makes him uncomfortable? Well, of course it would. John doesn’t remotely feel anything close to love for him so why should Sherlock expect him to feel comfortable about this? Is John trying to steer their friendship away from this grey area by ignoring the issue altogether? Or is John pitying him and just doesn't want to bring it up for fear of hurting him? Or is John just trying to wait for a better time to tell Sherlock that he's leaving?
“Why, what’s wrong?” John whispers, his arm tightening around him.
John is gone.
That’s really the question.
But John had been waiting for him.
“And that explains why you tried to give me the drugs that day, why you goaded at me when I was at the wedding. It also explains why you sent out that mass broadcast - to bring me back to London. You weren't done with me were you?” Sherlock deduces, ignoring her calmly, “You just wanted to get a rise out of me, to see me crack so that John would hate me.”
“I actually grew up as Billy,” Sherlock begins, his voice surprisingly calm, “That’s what everyone called me. Billy.”
He gives one final sideways glance in Sherlock’s direction before letting the door slam shut behind him.
There’s a moment of abject shock that all people experience when they’re about to be hit by an oncoming object. It’s a deer in the headlights moment. Sherlock knows it all too well, after all he’d just experienced it slightly over an hour ago. It’s a moment when people stand absolutely still, eyes wide, unable to do anything, surrendering to the possibility of imminent pain. This is the look that John currently has on his face.
“I’ve mulled over this for ages, thought about what I could do to fix this, fix all of this. Because look, Sherlock, I stopped loving Mary the moment she put a fucking bullet in your chest. No amount of marriage counselling is ever going to fix that!"
“Really?” John breathes, finally turning his head to face Sherlock.
“So Lestrade,” Sherlock starts, standing up to greet him before sitting back down again, “What brings you here at this time of the morning?”
Sherlock watches on greedily as John’s hips stutter before his cock pulses, spilling all over Sherlock’s chest. He continues to pump John through it, milking the man till his thighs begin to tremble.
You know Sherlock, technically I’m just an extension of what you believe John’s personality to be. So regardless, I will sound like the “Real John”, because the “Real John” isn’t actually John in himself, but rather what you’ve imagined John Watson to be-
“More like perks of being the person wronged by the British government on no short number of occasions, but I'll take your suggestion if need be,” he grins, some of the tension in his body dissipating.
He makes his way up the metal stairs, his shoes clinking with the effort as his eyes begin to brim over with tears.
Sherlock answers with a soft chuckle, shaking his head.
“But I’d like to… uh… remember who you are,” he continues, trying his best to salvage the conversation. “When were you here with me? I remember every day that I’ve been here and I’ve never once seen or heard of yo-”
“It’s yours now,” he continues as he shifts his fingers away, revealing the glimmering metal plating of his old army dog tags, “It’s yours to keep for as long as you wan-”
“Wait… Sherlock how long have you been playing for exactly?” John interrupts, his voice tinged with worry as he whips his face upwards, peering anxiously at him.
He truly is a terrible person with no sense of respect for anybody else’s privacy.
“It’s just that I heard some yelling and I wondered if-” she continues, “if you were in any trouble of any sort?”
“I’m not an addict. I’m a user,” Sherlock explains, hoping to hedge the situation a little by avoiding the main topic of conversation, “I alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes-”
Sherlock smooths his fingers over John’s face gently, blushing slightly before moving on to examine Major Sholto.
“Er, no,” Lestrade replies, scratching his head, “I think we might have overlooked that.”
John takes another shuddering breath before burying his face deeper into Sherlock’s shoulder, his arms coming to clutch him tighter as if he’s afraid that Sherlock will disappear into thin air. Sherlock places a hand on the mesh of John’s hands that have wound their way around his waist. His breath stutters for a moment before he replies, “You’re welcome.”
Sherlock smiles weakly at him, wondering whether he should tell John about Redbeard or if he should just keep mum and speed out the door.
He feels terribly excited, grinning slightly in anticipation of John’s reaction to his cooking. He’ll probably make it a four-course meal, he has enough money for it and enough time to cook after all. And he knows exactly what to do for the main course.
His bow flies over the strings, a vibrant melody that carries him around the room. Wisps of rosin rise from the waist of his violin as he spins around the room, managing a perfect pirouette without his bow leaving the strings.
, Sherlock thinks as he gives his chest one last final squeeze, feeling an answering firmness below his fingertips.
Oh no. NO. John wouldn’t-
That should be enough to keep him busy.
“It’s honestly taking a lot of energy to sustain this connection,” Sherlock admits, sighing softly. “I might have to… I might have to leave you soon.”
Something must have happened last evening, something that had startled John so much that he’d decided to call the clinic to take leave… But what could-
“The game is never over, John,” he replies, his voice taking on a gentler tone, “but there may be some new players now... It’s okay. The East Wind takes us all in the end.”
“We should probably accept the offer. I don’t want anything horrible happening to you. We all know she’ll go after you first,” John says, “If you got hurt… I’d… I’d never forgive myself.”
Wouldn’t that be better for both of them? For Sherlock to deal with his demons on his own instead of burdening John with them?
“Not even-”
He knows it to be true though. It’s Redbeard all over again. Another entanglement, another attachment that could possibly break him the way Redbeard’s death did so many years ago. But then he turns to look at John. John with his stupid wind-tousled hair and his stupid sea blue eyes that demand to be drowned in and he thinks to himself that it wouldn’t pain him much to have his heart broken if it was John who broke it for him. Besides, hasn't he already promised to stop being selfish? If what John needs right now is him by his side, if what John needs right now is a safe harbour to collect himself in before returning to Mary, he will willingly give it to him. He's already promised himself that he'd make the best of the time he has left with John anyways. And if he is to burn in the process, then so be it.
“It’s what Sherlock?” John presses and Sherlock comes back to himself.
Sherlock can’t help but chuckle softly, amazed by how much power John Watson commands with just that voice. And at that height too, god.
“FUCK JOHN,” Sherlock yells, shouting loudly as his hips snap up off the bed, his body bending forward as he digs his fingers further into John’s skin. It’s probably going to leave a mark but John honestly doesn’t mind.
“Whenever I called that boy up, it was always John this and John that. Before you came along, he barely ever spoke about his day to day activities! Just talked my ear off about Chemistry! I mean, I’d listen to him, of course I would, but Chemistry was never something I was interested in,” she smiles and says, “I was always more of a math person.”
What can he say?
“I was 8,” he begins, his eyes flicking to John who nods in approval before continuing.
“John is a grown adult who can decide for himself what he wants and doesn’t want to do,” Sherlock hisses. “I do not make his decisions for him and neither should you.”
John seems to have picked up on his internal dilemma because he’s shaking his head, rising from the sofa.
“What do you mean?” John murmurs, turning back to his dinner, twirling his noodles absentmindedly with his chopsticks.
What is he doing? The last time he touched the dog tags, all it did was show him getting shot and dying. What the hell would touching it again serve? What if all it ended up doing was show him dying in the desert again…
“Yes John,” Sherlock admits, “Yes… Unfortunately yes.”
What would he think if he found Sherlock high out of his mind, too confused to even think straight?
“I used to fantasise for hours over that neck,” John murmurs, smiling down at Sherlock’s rapidly expanding chest, “Nearly always got hard when you removed your scarf back then-”
Wait. John hasn’t come yet.
He’d been so sure that the mission would succeed, that he’d beat Magnussen once and for all and save John and his marriage.
He flits through the store, pausing and staring at the array of gems up for sale, each glimmering brightly in the show lights.
It’s dark… far too dark… far too cold too.
John thinks,
“Trust me.”
The fact that it’s John’s cock makes it better to be honest.
, he thinks to himself.
Only one thing that he can do to save Mary.
The words may have gone unspoken (
He’s back inside the airplane cabin, except that now, the plane seems to have stopped moving.
Anything for John, he thinks as he drops off to sleep.
, Sherlock thinks, dragging himself abruptly back to reality as memories of last night come flooding back to him.
He sighs as he rights himself, focusing bleary eyes on glossy pages once more.
“No, of course we don’t,” Mary chides in a patronising tone, her words stinging a little. “You’re not making any sense, Sherlock.”
He finishes with the petri dishes, scrubbing his hands clean before getting to work on the kitchen table, clearing the remaining detritus before doing one final wipe.
They’d caught the thief at around 3 in the morning and crashed at about 4, the two of them shucking their shirts and trousers just in time before falling soundly asleep.
They’re stepping foot into dangerous territory.
“Moving on…” John murmurs, said more as a command to himself than anything else, “your collarbone. Oh-”
“I’ve been fine,” he cringes a little at the lie, of course he’s not
“Sherlock,” Mycroft responds, voice sure and certain, “There are some things I have to discuss with you concerning John Watson.”
“It’s just…” John mutters, his voice cracking a little, “Mike... What if they like each other? You know… In that kind of way?”
“You might need to change the bed sheets,” Sherlock ventures, hoping to fish for more information on John’s sudden arrival at Baker Street, though to be honest, he’s sure he’s gotten most of it correct already. “No one’s been up there in a while so I’m not sure how much dust has collected since-”
“Yeah,” John laughs, albeit now a bit sadly, “That’s why I tried to chat you up over dinner,”
“That’s because there’s no need for any, brother mine.”
Sherlock relaxes slightly at this, his shoulders slumping a little as he points the way to the next atrium, briefing John on the cases the next section will be dealing with as John listens on attentively, nodding and asking questions every now and then.
However, Mary appears to be unfazed as she draws up a chair, the feet of the metal furniture squeaking against the rotting floor as she manoeuvres her way to Sherlock’s front, her face now a hand’s breadth away from his.
“David, before this visit, when was the last time Mary was here?”
The sides of the box are covered with soft sponge, wrapped around a metal object that gleams brightly in the sunlight.
Sherlock had therefore never brought them up.
Sherlock’s head perks up at this, listening attentively to John.
It doesn’t come.
I think the next update is gonna be two weeks from now because... Chinese New Year is a really busy period :P
Contact me on
Instead, he’s in a desert.
It’s not a huge leap anyways, the man already has stars in his eyes as he gazes at him, clearly, absolutely, utterly besotted.
Fuck, is he wounded, is he-
Sherlock nods vehemently, his brain turning to soup as he locks eyes with John, his focus narrowing down to him and nothing else.
Sherlock flinches as John raises his voice, backing away reflexively.
Mrs Hudson either doesn’t notice this or pretends not to notice as she continues, “So John, how are you?”
John smiles at him, his face practically glowing as he rights himself, Sherlock whining reluctantly at the loss of contact as he sits up in his seat once again, watching as John straps on his seatbelt.
“It’s not waxing poetic if it’s true, darling,” he murmurs, caressing Sherlock’s cheek with the back of his hand as he presses a kiss to Sherlock’s nose.
It doesn’t take long till the man is heartily devouring his meal, John readily scooping spoonfuls of rice into his mouth as if he had been starved for ages. After all, food has never failed to cheer John up.
Sherlock sighs as the man lets out a loud groan, his hand stilling against him as his cock pulses up against Sherlock’s chest, spending itself against his skin.
What did it mean?
Sherlock kisses back in tiny sips, drinking his fill of the man’s lips as his fingers wind their way into John’s hair, tangling in the short strands there as he drags John’s face closer.
“No it’s okay,” Sherlock breathes back, his breaths coming out hard and fast.
“One night stand?” Lestrade questions, puzzled, “How do you know they were about to have sex?”
It rounds the corner and just like that…
John doesn’t bat an eyelid.
“See you later boys,” she calls, disappearing down the corner as Mike hollers a “see ya” back.
So he hadn’t been reading too much into John’s actions after all…
John’s breathing speeds up as gunshots are heard, the sound of rifles being fired across the buildings ringing out in the dusty street as he takes a step back from the man before him.
I know Sherlock, and it’s fine. Really. Honestly, I find it a little adorable too ;)
Sherlock gulps, tears threatening to spill over at the memory.
He has to awake from his fantasy world at some point, has to realise that Sherlock is NOT THE ONE FOR HIM.
“It was worth a try,” Sherlock answers, not actually talking about baby names at all.
“I mean… do you think things would have turned out better for us if we’d made different choices earlier on?”
Unless…
And John obliges.
He gives his hand one solid shake, his eyes focused on Sherlock’s, refusing to let go.
John giggles in response, taking Sherlock’s hand in his.
“Why are you so certain of this impending hijack anyway?”
He waits till John gathers his wits again, exhaling deeply before gazing up at Sherlock, his eyes filled with piercing pain and sorrow as he continues.
“Sherlock, seriously what’s bothering you,” John suddenly says, sounding exasperated.
Sherlock doesn’t answer to that so John keeps going.
It’s like a switch has been flicked in Sherlock’s brain, one that seems to be preventing any sort of rational cognitive function. “Don’t you dare pretend to know me better than I do,” Sherlock responds, enunciating each word with great malice.
“John told me that you used to be a drug addict, told me you used to use them to take the edge off. So I thought that maybe, given the circumstances, you’d require some to calm your nerves.”
He turns it over in his hands, admiring the way the gold lettering gleams in the sunlight before setting it down gently on his old bed, turning back towards the drawer and rummaging through it’s contents.
Nothing can separate them now. Nothing.
This is a battle in his mind palace, in his head.
“Well I want my husband back where he belongs of course,” Mary continues, voice sharp and edging on sinister, “But he’s definitely not going to listen to me.”
He plays on, remembering how it'd felt the first time he'd played this piece in public. Of how his heart had clenched when he'd seen John's hands resting on Mary’s waist, guiding his wife in an intimate waltz.
A ledge belonging to a steep cliff.
He manoeuvres himself into a more comfortable position, curling his feet up into himself as he begins to properly process all the information that he’d gathered about this “Victor Trevor” guy so far.
It means that John is hiding something from him.
“Sherlock, that’s not true.”
The moment John puts the car in ‘park’, Sherlock dashes out, zipping his way to the front door.
“We’ll solve crimes, have fights over body parts in the fridge, chase each other down dark alleyways, things probably won’t change all that much,” Sherlock shrugs, “We’ll be fine as long as we’re together.”
“Very well done Sherlock, very well done,” Mycroft says after a moment, lifting his hands of the table and settling them on his lap instead.
HEY GUYS ITS BEEN 3 WEEKS BUT YAY I MANAGED TO UPDATE JUST AS IT HIT 21 DAYS HAHAHAHA.
“What did Mycroft say?” he questions as Sherlock steps into the lift, the doors closing behind him swiftly. “Anything helpful?”
John’s mouth opens in a perfectly shaped O.
Mycroft had warned him about this, technically… In his imaginary study, just that Sherlock hadn’t taken him seriously.
“Anything you’d like to say to get me to move?” John repeats, focusing a fiery, lust-filled gaze on the man below him and Sherlock gulps.
Hit me up on
Smiling at the sight, John presses a gentle kiss to both of Sherlock’s closed eyelids, chapped skin meeting smooth and Sherlock’s breath hitches.
It’s alright Sherlock, I understand. What we have to focus on now isn’t really the how or why, but rather, on what his next move will be.
He can’t believe that John would… that he would’ve… how?
“Are you quite well, Watson?” Sherlock replies stiffly, his lip trembling a little.
From Mary’s point of view, it would seem like John had been shirking his duties as a loving husband and a father. As far as Sherlock knows, John hasn’t had any contact with Mary since the altercation at the clinic and he clearly doesn’t wish to. He hasn’t been keeping tabs on her pregnancy and most definitely has not been keeping tabs on the baby.
“We might have to talk through some things first though,” John mutters as he starts the engine again, “And boy, I do believe there’s quite a lot to get through.”
“They’re the sharpest I have ever seen,” John cups Sherlock’s cheek with his palm, stroking the outline of the bone with his thumb, “Do you know how ethereal you look in the dark, when we’re out on a case and all that’s there to light us in lamplight? You look like a fucking model.”
John smiles, nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck as he wriggles his way into the space in between Sherlock and the back of the sofa.
“Offensive,” Sherlock joins in, watching as Moriarty shakes his head in annoyance.
“That’ll always be amazing,” he breathes and Sherlock feels like the luckiest man in the world. He can tell he’s blushing slightly so he turns to face the floor for a while to collect himself.
He drags himself off the floor, forcing himself towards the bed, on which he lands with a loud “floomph”. That's when he starts crying in earnest, sobs muffled by feather down pillows, face hidden in white cotton despite there being no one else in the room.
“What!?” he coughs, “Why?”
“I think I might have left a damp patch on your shoulder,” Sherlock murmurs, his eyes closing as he presses himself up against John’s chest, feeling the rumble of a chuckle before John replies.
There are also sketches of some of the more famous constellations on the ceiling, drawn on in black permanent marker, much to the chagrin of his mother. They’ve all been neatly labelled, each constellation paired with its own special name, scrawled onto the ceiling in a messy scribble.
“David would like to say otherwise,” is all John answers.
That elicits a chuckle from John. He leans back into the cushions, his elbow resting on the top of the sofa as he cradles his face in his palm, beaming at Sherlock almost adoringly.
There’d been voices. Voices in his goddamn head this time. One sounded like him and the other was this… mysterious Sherlock character.
That was the turning point, he muses now, where, for the very first time, he had decided to delete a huge area of study he had dedicated the best part of three years to... But then John came around, questioning him about the solar system, showing him the stars in the London sky, making Sherlock realise that he hadn’t actually deleted the solar system, he’d just locked it away, somewhere very deep inside.
But nothing had broken him more than the day itself.
Oh. But Mary is still with child.
He hopes to repay the favour.
There's a warm hand in his hair - that much Sherlock is sure of.
“Good morning Greg!” John says cheerfully, moving to shake the inspector’s hand. Sherlock notes with immense relief that John’s posture is now a lot more relaxed and that he looks very much at ease. Thank god for Lestrade’s sudden appearance, Sherlock thinks to himself. He definitely has no desire to see John suffer through another intrusive conversation.
He sure as hell doesn’t know.
“Sherlock you bastard, you said you came down early to help,” John chuckles softly, the sound coming out a little strained.
“Why do you think I put product in my hair and wear suits all the time John?” he sighs, burying his face in John’s shoulder, “It’s because I look disgusting and awful and-”
Sherlock’s in the midst of an experiment when it happens.
“How ...?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, shaking his head.
“It really doesn’t matter,” Sherlock retorts, smiling down at John.
“How does that feel?” John smirks, Sherlock feeling the man’s smile in the shifting of his jaw. He seems utterly pleased with himself
Sherlock fixes his brother with a dirty glare as he rises from his seat, maintaining eye contact till Mycroft turns his back to him, affording Sherlock one last grave nod before stalking down the hallway.
“And admirably high arches,” Sherlock retorts. God, anyone would have noticed that Lady Carmichael was exceptionally intelligent. “I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.”
David gifts him with a confused look but answers anyway.
Oh god, John’s already half-hard.
“Sherlock, it’s me, John,” he says one last time before tugging at the handle…
“Hmmm… interesting… one more question for you Mr Campbell,” Sherlock drawls, “Did the girls have any pet names for each other?”
Three photocopies of sonograms.
“It’s to help me find out what’s wrong with my movements and such, he’s said so before…”
He holds Sherlock close as the man stiffens, his arms enclosing Sherlock in a safe bubble as Sherlock’s muscles tense up, his hair standing on end. Pulling the man close, he waits till he relaxes before loosening his grip, watching as the man shrugs back into his arms, sighing deeply. He lets the moment hang heavy over them for a second or two before he speaks.
“And it’s not just John Watson, star rugby player,” he continues, “it’s also John Watson the
He’s leaning in before he realises it, John too in fact, bringing Sherlock forward with a gentle tug, pulling their bodies flush.
“Together.”
Sherlock sees the man fall in slow motion, just like on that fateful day on the top of Barts. He watches as Moriarty tumbles, hitting the ground with a thump as blood spurts into the air…
Sherlock shakes his head.
“You guys go ahead!” Lestrade yells, pinning Cameron down, whose face is now mashed firmly into the table. More officers are arriving (clearly they'd been called to standby before the interrogation had begun) so John and Sherlock make for the door.
“I saw you laugh easily, saw your happiness as plain as a nose on your face that very first day we met. James never smiled unless I tried extremely hard to say something humorous. But you, I could see you shining through the cracks and I thought to myself… I have to keep this one.”
“Yes, of course,” Victor smiles, shuffling over to John’s side as Sherlock follows suit, “How close by do you think we are?”
, the more selfish part of his brain thinks.
Sherlock.
“No, you did. You said… “
That seems to jolt his lover back to reality, John’s head giving a little twitch as he fixes his eyes on Sherlock. He shifts towards the corner of the sill, patting the open spot next to him.
“No one can hurt you now,” John whispers, his voice echoing around the room as Sherlock shudders at the promise of John’s words.
“Did I do something wrong?” Sherlock breathes, “Did I say something I wasn’t supposed t-”
“Do you know why I hate my middle name?” he says.
When he’d first met Sherlock, he’d thought that his initial obsession with his roommate’s looks would fade over time, that eventually his imposing features would fade into something more simple and familiar.
“Yeah, yeah I’m fine,” he replies, pressing a switch on his shaver so that it whirs to life.
He pushes Sherlock up against their room wall now, grabbing his hands and pinning them high above his head as he plunders his roommate’s mouth, his tongue dipping roughly in and out as his other hand comes to rest in Sherlock’s hair, fisting his curls tightly as he angles Sherlock’s head, their lips slotting together perfectly.
Because when had it become John and Mary?
There’s silence for a moment, the room still but Sherlock can tell that John is thinking, thinking hard. He can practically hear the imaginary cogs in the man’s brain clunking and creaking.
“Yeah… yeah I have,” he answers, his voice still shaking.
“I didn’t say anything,” he says, his voice a little concerned
He lets his smile fall the moment he’s certain that she’s no longer looking, gazing disheartenedly at the ground as Mary leans into John’s space.
of a flatmate.
Oh yes, he’d forgotten that Moriarty was still there.
It’s better than nothing.
His footsteps resound resolutely against the concrete pavement as he stretches his arms around Sherlock’s torso, locking him in a tight embrace.
And this is for John.
Sherlock smiles as he picks up the thin sheet of glossy paper, handling it gingerly as he settles the photograph on his lap.
“Sounds wonderful,” John chirps, the muscles in his face relaxing visibly as he reaches a hand forwards to gently ruffle Sherlock’s hair. “I can't wait.”
“I started with ballet. It was at the time, the only dance form I was interested in. The dancers I had seen in theatres had moved with such grace, with such poise that I sought to emulate them. It had originally been a flighty dream of mine to become a professional dancer till my father turned it into a reality.”
Sherlock’s reaction had been understandable to be honest, given the fact that John was a rugby player. The man had had some rather nasty run-ins with the senior members of the rugby team before John had transferred in so it wasn’t surprising that he’d think the same of John.
He instead fixes his eyes on Sherlock’s arse, marvelling silently over the smooth globes before pressing a tentative palm to one cheek, dragging his fingertips down the gentle curve of skin.
Sherlock wonders what he must look like right now, curls tousled, clothing rumpled and lips slick with saliva. Does John find that attractive? It only makes sense since it does appeal to the carnal nature of sex, but Sherlock’s never had an emotional entanglement of any sort before so it’s not like he’d know first-hand.
John buries his face in his hands, groaning in frustration as he tries to remove that visual from his head, because goddammit Sherlock-
“So…” Sherlock starts, “What’s your team planning to do after this?”
Sherlock’s eyes widen in surprise as Mary drops the gun, the two of them turning to face the door.
John gives a sad chuckle, moving to stand right by a pillar.
"He feels a sudden blossoming of warmth in his chest, a tiny ember glimmering feebly in deep darkness before bursting into flame. It feels like golden treacle is seeping through every vein, every pore in his body, winding its way around his coronary arteries into his heart, and Sherlock, for the first time in a very long time, watches as a tiny spark of hope springs to life."
John doesn’t know how he ended up here.
His parents had been such inspirations to him.
“You have to have a bath,” he murmurs, helping the man stand, holding him as they trudge their way to the bathroom, “You stink.”
But the thought remains unfinished as Mrs Hudson interrupts by dumping the tray with a rattle onto the kitchen table.
He purposefully puts extra pressure on the creaky eighth stair, arching the heel of his foot and listening as the wood gives a satisfying groan under his weight as he pads up the next few steps.
John’s dick is bigger than he thought it would be but that’s okay.
“John,” Sherlock whispers. John really sounds angry this time, is this when he decides to leave? Sherlock can’t take it. He’s sure that his face is revealing way too much right now. He draws his legs up to himself, burying his face in his knees. Dammit, John wasn’t supposed to find out this way.
“You sure that’s enough for you?” John asks, peering down at the container. It’s half eaten, but that could just be because Sherlock doesn’t want to impose too much on him.
Tuesday, December 23rd 2014, 10:20 a.m.
Turns out that John has left him with more than just his dog tags to remember him by.
“I can’t compete with that and I don’t want to because Sherlock can date whoever he wants,” he says monotonously, sounding as if he's repeating the words by rote, “It’s his life not mine… But I still hoped-”
“NOTHING!” John almost yells, goosebumps erupting out of his skin. “It’s nothing, absolutely nothing. It’s just…”
John’s laughter slowly segues into static silence as he fixes his eyes back on Sherlock’s, an invisible lock holding their gazes together. “God, I’ve missed you,” he whispers, but in the quiet of the flat, the words seem to reverberate across the walls, a sonorous proclamation meant for just the two of them alone.
“Well, there you are, you see?” Sherlock spits, his voice cracking a little. If Watson had known this all already, then why has he been pressing him? “I’ve said it all before.”
His eyes are starting to close, fatigue starting to overtake him and before long Sherlock finds himself floating off to sleep.
He bets John likes that... And he’s not wrong because the moment he turns to face the man, John’s already giving him a heady gaze, his eyes raking up and down his thighs and Sherlock has to stifle a giggle.
That voice sounds oddly familiar…
“Thank you,” John Watson breathes into his shoulder, a soft whisper meant for just the two of them alone. There’s a warm patch on his shoulder where John’s lips have been and it’s like little threads of liquid gold are radiating from that very spot, threading through his arteries and veins and it feels like his heart is melting.
Sherlock gulps, wondering whether he should turn back now and spare John or if he should be honest with him.
“Are you kidding me-” he complains and John laughs, raising his hands above his head as Sherlock drags the fabric up John’s skin swiftly, revealing more and more of the man’s bronzed skin with every pull and tug of John’s singlet.
“All because she shot me?” he starts, voice cracking, “John-”
“Oh, so you did, didn’t you?” Mary sighs, shaking her head, “Hope you enjoyed it while it lasted. Those happy memories should be enough to keep you sane before I kill you.”
"M'sorry," Sherlock mumbles in answer.
He runs his fingers through the row of necklaces adorning the tiny shelf space to the right of the store. The pearls and chains feel like silk beneath his palms, the clinking of metal resounding through the store as the necklaces fall back into place in the wake of his touch...
But just now, all of that? Didn't that mean something at least?
There’d been a note on the side table, a hastily scribbled apology saying that John would be back late that day and that Sherlock should probably go and have dinner without him.
“I’ll go and get breakfast sorted,” he grins and says, “You just wash up and get ready in…” John glances at his watch momentarily. “... Half an hour tops. Is that okay with you?”
John smiles down at Sherlock as he moves to stand, tugging John’s face in for another kiss before guiding the man towards the bathtub, settling him inside the warm water.
“Hmmmm,” John hums against the shell of Sherlock’s ear, continuing to palm him slowly as Sherlock’s grip on John’s back tightens, digging crescent moon shaped nails deep into the fabric of John’s shirt. Sherlock personally hopes that they don’t leave a mark.
He can feel it.
“What even makes you think that Sherlock likes him in that way in the first place?” Mike huffs, resting his elbows on the table.
“Are you sure?” Watson questions, his eyes clouded with worry as Sherlock turns back to look at him, fixing him with a reassuring look.
Sherlock blushes furiously under the attention, his footsteps stuttering for a moment before John hauls him back on his feet, grinning up at him.
And then there was the intimacy. Sherlock shudders just thinking about it, feeling a phantom pressure where John’s head had leant against his forehead, a ghost of hot breath on his lips. Why had they gotten so close? John had never done that before... the John he remembers from before the fall would have asserted his heterosexuality painstakingly. But then again, John had changed after his return, he’d changed a lot.
John lets out a surprised snort.
He faces the mirror, slowly watching the progress of the razor against the foam.
He watches as John’s gaze completes another circuit of the airfield before he finally turns towards him, his left hand visibly shaking
Reaching into his coat pocket, he extracts the sheet of paper that he’d written on back in the cell. He extends his arm, releasing his fingers so that the paper flutters to the floor.
The chain.
Sherlock only stops periodically to take bites out of the sandwiches on his plate, choosing to prioritise the never-ending stream of deductions that his brain seems to be churning out. He doesn’t notice that John is slowly piling more and more food onto his plate, and he most definitely doesn’t realise that’s he’s slowly devouring all of it.
“Well…” John starts, licking his lips, “I’d say…”
Bright sunlight spills through the windows as Sherlock saunters over to John’s bed. He feels comfortable and relaxed, enclosed in a safe bubble of time where the horrors of his and John’s reality cannot touch him. Smiling at the small amount of clutter that has started to accumulate on John’s bedside table, he sets himself down on the bed with a soft “floompf”, beginning to examine the items resting there.
“You’re welcome.”
It hadn’t taken long for John to warm up to Victor. The man was, as expected, warm and funny but most importantly, a good friend to Sherlock and that obviously had to count for something.
So he does what he always does best in moments of deep distress.
Sherlock, something cropped up at work and I might not be able to make it home on time.
Sighing, John shakes his head, trying his best to rid himself of the desert nightmare.
He sighs, arching his bow upwards.
“So Sherlock, dear brother,” Mycroft starts, pivoting himself on his elbows and leaning forward, “Do you know why you’re here today?”
“Interesting,” Sherlock continues, narrowing his gaze before stalking off to the other side of the room. He bends down, face inches from the bedsheet, before standing straight up again and walking back to where John and Lestrade are standing.
“Was it the show with the blue dog?” Sherlock guesses, digging deep into the recesses of his memory, “the one where the owner is a sorry excuse of a detective? Personally, I’ve always felt that the dog was better at it than he was.”
“I love you,” Sherlock mumbles, pressing his lips to John’s as John does the same, suckling sweetly on his bottom lip, “I love you so much-”
John smiles in return and turns to grab his spoon, shovelling more pineapple rice into his mouth.
John flashes a wide grin at him in response and does he… does he wink? At him? Before leaving the room?
Mary really had an eagle eye for victims.
“She’s still in the early stages of labour,” John mutters, huffing softly, “Nothing terribly serious yet.”
John had thought of him! He had actually planned this specially for Sherlock! And he had been clearly excited about it! And… and…
Making his way towards the car, Sherlock feels the December chill eating its way into his bones so he flips his coat open, slipping it on dramatically.
He pulls out a transparent ziplock case from his coat pocket, holding it up for Sherlock to see.
“I-” John chokes, words failing him as he twists his face away from the monochrome image, the paper falling from his fingers as he shoves his chair away from the table.
“It was foaming at the mouth, clearly infected with rabies, so I ran, calling Redbeard to follow me.”
At least John will be coming back this time.
He hangs his head low, blinking furiously and Sherlock now finds that he too has tears in his eyes.
"Thank god for that though," he says, smiling grimly as he takes another swig of tea, "Otherwise this murder might not even have been reported."
He looks like he hasn’t slept properly in weeks.
“Better than Janine?”
“Maybe... Maybe not…”
Sherlock opens his eyes, turning abruptly back to face John. That voice had definitely been John’s. Definitely. But John already knew the contents of the cocktail of drugs that he had taken… so why would he be asking that question?
“Doesn’t matter,” John replies, “Mycroft’s orders. Oh and when you’re done, go and nap for a bit. Mycroft and I will get some things sorted out in the meantime.”
John stares back at her, extremely flabbergasted as he rests the wine bottle on the dining table stand.
John is absolutely miserable.
There’s now a bean bag in place of the bed, which John happily flounces onto, revelling the softness of the fabric beneath his back as he closes his eyes.
Sherlock’s been locked up many times before.
He has to.
He picks up the envelope again, turning it over in his hands.
“But for now, you’ll just have to wait,” John murmurs again and Sherlock moans, shuddering as John slips the tip of his finger through the sphincter before drawing it out slowly again.
Sherlock sighs deeply at the sight, his chest heaving a little before he replies.
He’s colossally fucked up his best friend’s life simply by existing, single-handedly ruined John’s marriage and family and-
And sometimes it gets too much, knowing that there could be memories just lying there, out of his reach.
What is he supposed to say?
He waits till John’s body is fully engulfed before switching off the taps, swirling the water a bit so that the remaining bath salt residue dissolves.
They’re both still very much naked, Sherlock’s face being pressed up against John’s chest. And if he looks very carefully where the blanket rides up over their sleeping forms, he can see the dark blonde thatch of hair that leads down to where John’s cock is pressed up against his thigh.
However, if John were to be honest with himself, he’s doing it more so to keep his mind off the dog tags.
(See the end of the chapter for
he thinks as he walks out the door to 221B.
“I concede it,” Sherlock interrupts, hoping to end the conversation once and for all before his subconscious decides to deal him another blow.
But then again… he’d made a vow.
“Go back where?” John butts in, crossing his arms, clearly a little on edge, “You didn’t get very far.”
It’s the only explanation for everything that has happened so far.
“DID THIS TRANSMISSION GO THROUGH ANYWHERE ELSE?” the female agent hollers, clearly having lost her cool.
“And I’ve wanted you for, god for so long. Since before Barts, maybe from the first time I met you, I really don’t know. And it hurts, oh god it hurts so much to be so close to you and yet not together with you at the same time…”
Sherlock takes a deep breath.
Had Mary given John the wrong USB stick?
“Well, you’re thinking, living and experiencing this right now. Isn’t that real enough for you?”
“John, we both needed it…” he murmurs, raising a hand to John’s cheek, cupping it gently, bringing John’s eyes down to meet his, “After all those years… We needed… that.”
He lets his hands fall from his chest, peering down at the rocky ground he appears to be lying on. A jagged, rough-edged series of rocks swims into vision as he makes to sit up, puzzling him further.
“So it's like a thinking chair then?” John replies, a slight smile playing on his lips as he turns to face Sherlock.
“John,” Sherlock whispers as he rises from his seat, “John, do you want me to go? I-”
“Sherlock,” John breaks the silence, his voice steady, “That list you gave us… You didn’t take any of the drugs on the list except for the cocaine... And that wasn’t even a high dosage.”
“A bath sounds nice,” John smiles as he pulls away, his breaths leaving lovely, puffy warm patches on his lips. “Why? What do you have in mind?”
They continue on their way, footsteps in tandem as gravel crunches under their feet. John talks more about his patients and even entertains Sherlock with a hilarious anecdote from his university years, making him chuckle uncontrollably.
“John?” he whispers, his sleep-soaked voice gravelly and rough, “Are you alright?”
“So…”
It’s a good thing he kept it, he thinks to himself as he bends over on the floor, writing out the list of drugs that Mary’s presented before him.
He watches, helpless, as green gas erupts from the nozzle of the tank, the substance fizzling as it escapes and fills the air around him.
Sherlock growls, whipping back towards the cans, shoving the rest into the dry shelves like a man possessed. He leaves a packet of instant noodles out on the countertop so that he won’t have to retrieve it later for his own dinner.
“I expected you to be mildly intelligent at least,” Sherlock huffs, glaring back at John.
“’Cause you probably just OD’d,” Mary’s patronising voice comes, “You should be in hospital.”
What if John doesn’t actually like him in that way.
“No, no I haven’t” Cameron replies, his face a mask of indifference. However, his right hand is noticeably shaking.
Voices yelling in Russian.
Mycroft had come in yesterday with a sheet of paper for him to sign and a pen, but he’d let him keep the pen. It had been against protocol but Mycroft had done it anyway after Sherlock had asked for it politely.
“Fuck,” he breathes, his cock softening in John’s mouth as the man pulls off, smiling triumphantly up at Sherlock as he scoots back up the bed, his lips meeting Sherlock’s once again.
No this can’t be happening, he’d planned everything out so well. How could his subconscious have breached a gap in his mind palace? And why now, of all times-
So what did that make him?
“What are you doing here?” Mary barks, now turning to point the gun at John, “There’s no way you could’ve tracked him without Mycroft’s help.”
John meets his gaze, nodding his head.
And that’s when Mike decides that he’s had enough.
And even though he's broken, a dead man in every sense of the word. There is one thing that he is - that he can be, just for John. And that's a miracle maker. He rises from the ground, a phoenix reborn from ashes.
David's left eyebrow gives an uneasy twitch.
“John… Are you alright?” he whispers, fixing electric blue eyes on him.
The walk back had been full of barely repressed tension, every shift and brush of Sherlock’s arm against his enough to set the sparks in his chest aflame and the moment they’d reached the lift, Sherlock’s resolve had broken and he’d been on him in an instant, pressing his lips firmly to John’s. Thankfully the shock had worn off quickly and John had been able to take over the kiss, Sherlock a little lost without John’s guidance.
It’s how it’s been for the past 2539 days.
“Yes, darling,” John murmurs, his tongue following the outline of Sherlock’s lips just as he crooks the three fingers inside of Sherlock, thrusting them up into the heat of Sherlock’s body…
He didn’t seem to be in any sort of danger, in fact, the room was completely silent, devoid of any noise.
He’s in a jewellery shop today.
Something within him feels empty.
He remembers lifting groggy lids only to find himself face to face with John. John who had propped himself up on his good arm, steadying himself so that he could slowly untangle his limbs from Sherlock’s.
“I thought you didn’t like idiots,” John chuckles, taking a swig of his tea.
“You’ll be notified once her contractions start?” Sherlock queries as John lowers his hand, clutching the card tightly to his side.
The moment those words leave Sherlock’s lips, John’s face does some major acrobatics, looking simultaneously surprised, shocked and joyous at the same time.
“There’s a fucking Dratini down by the lake. We just left the lake this isn’t fai-”
“After we finished our O levels, we said our goodbyes and Victor left. I believe that that was the last I saw of him,” Sherlock continues, almost wistfully. “Well of course until now that is.”
“It would be my pleasure,” Greg responds, passing the keys for the room over to Sherlock. “The two-way glass should allow us to intervene if anything goes wrong and we also have receivers in the room that allow us to hear whatever you say,” Greg continues, motioning towards the headsets hanging by the door. “Good luck,” he finishes, walking over to grab one. John follows suit, giving Sherlock a thumbs up before walking over to stand watch in front of the glass, tensing up as he rests his hands on the screen’s ledge.
But Mycroft has turned away from him, moving off towards the side of the plane to chat with his security guard and Sherlock feels his stomach plummeting like a stone, his heart now heavy laden with sorrow.
“And Lily didn’t even suit her. I personally felt she was more of a Felicia myself but Mary didn’t listen to me,” John shakes his head in annoyance, “Talk about shitty baby names.”
“Fine, we do that and then we go home and pack,” he intones, turning back to face the car front, “Sounds like a plan.”
“Wait what?”
Oi haha.
He stares, stunned for a moment before realising exactly what that cylinder is.
So the smell hadn’t been from Mrs Hudson’s cooking at all.
Moriarty whispers something incomprehensible, prompting Sherlock to whisper a confused “I’m sorry?” as Moriarty drags the gun out of his mouth.
John’s eyes flick downwards to the vee of Sherlock’s chest, raking his eyes over alabaster skin that disappears into thin T-shirt before turning his gaze to the long, pale column of Sherlock’s neck. John's tongue darts out, licking a long stripe up his lip and Sherlock is absolutely mesmerised.
“Anything you say love,” is the last that Sherlock hears as he steps across the threshold of the bathroom, surveying the tiny space before him.
Sherlock holds his breath.
He finishes in a few minutes, stacking the plates neatly before wiping down the kitchen table one final time.
“Bet you slept extremely well last night after slamming a door in my face. What an excellent way to say goodnight!” Mrs Hudson continues, viciously stirring a cup of tea that Sherlock now believes to be his.
“Fuck this, let’s dance.”
John growls in response, a rough, animalistic noise that goes straight to Sherlock’s cock. He reaches around John’s shoulders, fingers digging into John’s shoulder blades as John leans in, licking his way up Sherlock’s neck, rough tongue prickling against smooth skin.
He feels like he’s grasping at straws, extremely out of his depth for once as he begins to rub circles into his palm, scratching the surface of the skin as he struggles to think.
He feels John jerk away in response as well, pulling away so that he's as far away from Sherlock as possible. Sherlock laments the loss of contact but immediately directs his attention to the door.
but Sherlock knows that John understands them all the same because the man leans in, his forehead bumping into his shoulder.
It’s just his subconscious, barging in and bombarding him in his drug-addled, weakened state. Nothing more-
He’d ignored it back then though, believing it to be the result of a shared camaraderie between two very new friends. He’d chosen, unknowingly, to mask his affection for John with cold-hearted detachment as he distanced himself from John, referring to him in his mind palace as “friend”, “colleague” and “flatmate”.
!!! I'm always open to you guys, drown my ask box in messages if you want haha. Headcanons are gr8 too :,) Who knows I might consider writing some haha. I need fluff to keep me going in the angst fest that is the other fic.
“SHERLOCK!”
“Steep temperatures, yes, high temperatures burn the tea leaves, leaving behind a bitter taste that is highly unpleasant so a suitable temperature is most definitely necessary for a perfect cup of tea. This, of course, depends on the type of tea leaves, such as-”
She flashes him a wide grin, pleased as punch at her son’s best friend’s politeness while simultaneously despairing the fact that not enough of John’s mannerisms have rubbed off on Sherlock.
He opens his eyes, hoping that he’s succeeded and Moriarty is gone. However, the man is still there, except that he’s now bent forward, knees on the ground with the pistol in his mouth.
“Morphine or cocaine?”
But at least Sherlock would have gotten a clear answer from John.
Sherlock looks down at John for a moment, smiling shyly as he slips it on.
“Wha- what do you mean?” the man slurs, fixing a heated and yet sloppy gaze on the man above him, evidently confused.
“Well,” John mumbles as Sherlock lets out a deep sigh, his gaze hooded as he struggles to catch his breath, “That’s one g spot down.”
John smells of him, of his shampoo, of his body soap (he probably hadn’t had time to pack his toiletries) and it’s absolutely wonderful.
John is a hardworking man who has always prized his GP work, rarely calling in sick or taking leave (unless it was for a case) because he's always felt a sense of responsibility towards his colleagues and patients. So why today of all days? He could have just visited her on the weekend.
Sherlock chuckles.
, John thinks to himself as he rubs his eyes, brushing away the sleep dust before rising groggily, glancing at the clock on their bedside table.
“Hands behind your head,” Watson instructs, gazing over at Sherlock with a smug grin.
“You’re adorable,” John laughs, chucking the flannel away as he rolls Sherlock back onto his back, nuzzling up against the man’s stomach…
“But… I can’t,” he continues, his gaze growing apologetic, “I mean I’d really love to, I really would, but I already have other plans. Maybe next time?”
The baby in the sonograms is curled up neatly into itself, its knees bent so that they’re barely touching its torso.
“Wait what?” Sherlock spouts, almost breathless.
“So you’ve figured where the signals are being transmitted from?” John pipes up, materialising by Sherlock’s side.
He stalks towards the man, fixing him with a sly smile as he guides John towards the bed, the two of them collapsing onto the soft surface almost immediately.
Sherlock smiles.
Phew, crisis averted.
John’s breathing heavily now, his chest heaving as Sherlock presses a kiss to his navel before starting work on his jeans. He tugs the button off and the zipper down, pulling the blue denim down far enough for John to step out of it.
“Can’t we save that for later?” Sherlock sighs as John hits the accelerator, sending their car moving once again.
He’s frozen where he is, watching as John smiles and pats the spot next to him, inviting him to get in with him and Sherlock can’t think because... how did he get so lucky? How did he find someone who was willing to carry him through his nightmares? Someone who was willing to wash away his fears with gentle caresses and soft scented baths and Sherlock feels like his heart is going to burst.
Hedging, that’s what John’s been doing, hedging.
“I know you John Watson”, Sherlock replies confidently, “You’ll always find a way.”
He fiddles with his phone for the better part of half an hour, scrolling through news feeds and old messages from John.
He pulls open the bedside drawer, revealing an extremely crinkled 50 pound note (how long has that been in there for?), a box of condoms (old, clearly very very old) and a bottle of lube (which seems to be pretty new and Sherlock DOES NOT WANT TO KNOW).
He'd never told him that he’d overheard these episodes and he never will. He does not wish to cause John any distress. His nightmares have always been something that they’ve never discussed, obviously something that John feels ashamed about.
“Dull,” Sherlock replies, bottom lip jutting out in a pout as his other arm reaches round John's body, palm resting possessively on John's back.
His eyes travel up to Sherlock’s lips as he rights their bodies, the moment stretching between them as John looks up almost inquisitively at Sherlock, cocking his head to the side as if asking for permission for something.
“John,” Sherlock murmurs, his eyes brimming with wetness as he reaches a hand to swipe away the tears accumulating below John’s weary eyelids, “John, I wish you didn’t have to go-”
, he thinks, mentally preparing himself for the conversation that's about to follow.
“This is my way of making up for it.”
(See the end of the chapter for
In hindsight, he’d fallen for John soon after his first meeting with him. It had been after John had shot the cabby for him, when they’d walked off towards Sherlock’s favourite Chinese restaurant, the exhilaration of a near-death experience still thrumming through his veins.
John is married to Mary.
“Don’t.” Sherlock’s eyes whip back to John’s face, meeting deep, blue eyes that match his own grey-blue ones. “Please, just don’t,” John’s voice seems to crack.
“Somewhere in the South of London. We’ve managed to affirm that much,” she answers in a clipped manner, pursing her lips in annoyance.
Sherlock refuses to move, however, remaining stock still, annoyance rolling off him in waves as John rolls his eyes, tugging at Sherlock once again.
It seems to be having an effect on John too because his grunts seem to be getting far louder as well.
Sherlock thinks as they stride out into the sunshine, leaving the MI6 HQ behind.
“Sure, sure,” the man answers, wiping his brow as he draws the door open further, welcoming them in.
Hit me up on
Well, John replies, If it means that Sherlock would be happy and content… Then yes, why not?
“No,” Sherlock responds, hoping that Watson isn’t trying to get at what he thinks he’s trying to get at. God, the fictional, Victorian version of John Watson is seriously a menace.
Sherlock feels the “I’m sorry” in the warmth of Mycroft’s palm, the “There was nothing I could do” in the squeeze and give of Mycroft’s fingers before his brother lets his hand fall to his side, his arm slack against Sherlock’s.
“As if our lives weren’t any less interesting before either of them came into the picture,” he says, nuzzling into John’s shoulder.
Sherlock groans, burying his face in his hands as he racks his brain for answers.
“I saw you die,” Sherlock cannot help but say, any semblance of self-control vanishing rapidly in the wake of his heightened state of fear, “Why aren’t you dead?”
The same ones that he made me look through?
He suddenly feels those fingertips press sharper into his skin, nails now scratching a hard line down his scalp and Sherlock shivers in ecstasy at the sensation.
“Yeah,” Sherlock replies, “Yeah, sure.”
Next update in 3 weeks because I'm getting my A level results back on friday and I don't know how I will feel about that haha.
“In my defence, he was spectacularly annoying,” Sherlock mutters, rolling his eyes, “He had it coming.”
“John… John…”
Sherlock had flushed red then, melting into a stuttering, bumbling mess till John had reassured him and told him that “it was all fine”.
When had it stopped being Sherlock and John?
His eyes meet John’s from across the room immediately. And there’s that expression again, that curious expression that Sherlock has yet to give a name to. But Sherlock could really care less about that right now because John is staring at him like a man entranced, his tongue appearing once again at the corner of his lips, swooping down to lick the crumbs off his bottom lip and Sherlock finds that he can’t move, that he is rooted to the spot because he feels like John’s complete attention is on him.
Mary disconnects the call but Sherlock finds he’s still too stunned to shift the phone away from his ear.
“Sherlock? You all right?” John questions, worry palpable in his eyes as Sherlock frowns.
The voice seems to be rather distraught, John notes sadly as he listens to the crackling syllables of Sherlock’s (it must be Sherlock’s) voice.
Sherlock sighs in response, kicking his pants off onto the floor.
Sherlock practically melts into the mattress at the gentle touch, his head thrown back in ecstasy as the figure continues to stroke his cheek reverently, leaving soft kisses on his exposed neck.
“I’m going to make us some tea,” he calls to John as he fills the kettle with water, “Mrs Hudson brought up some biscuits in the morning so we can have those as well.”
“So… What are you going to do now?”
a voice echoes in the stillness of the room, startling Sherlock for a moment.
“Not Baker Street,” he answers, his eyes fixed straight ahead on the road, his gaze steely.
To be honest, John isn’t quite sure why he hasn’t dared to touch it since it first appeared there. He has no reason to fear it or anything else in this world. If anything goes wrong, he could simply “imagine” himself away, construct something to protect him…
He smirks up at Sherlock once again, tut-tutting playfully at Sherlock’s mini mishap as Sherlock rolls his eyes, almost failing to catch that John is about to begin another spin.
So maybe it’s not Moriarty?
The hand in Sherlock’s hair tightens at the sound, tugging at the tuft of curls there gently as Sherlock whimpers, his eyes screwed shut as John chuckles, shifting off to press a soft kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
The room begins to rock once again, startling Sherlock as the intensity of the shaking seems to have increased substantially from the last time.
“I thought Mary would be enough, I was content with our relationship… Not madly in love with her as you’d have expected me to be. So when you came back, I was torn Sherlock. I was- Really. I loved you so much but I had her, a stable point in my already unsteady universe and I was terrified of what would happen if I left her and went back to you instead. Would you leave me again? Would you completely ruin me again? If I went back to you?”
The base of the jumper comes up to his thighs, just enough to hide his crotch, leaving it a little suggestive.
“I knew you were ticklish!” John chuckles as Sherlock doubles over with laughter, “You look like the sort.”
“One more thing, one more reason why you’re beautiful,” he murmurs, gently tugging Sherlock onto his side so that his back is facing him.
There’s a brown package sitting next to Billy the skull. It looks innocuous enough, just a little bit on the bulky side. It doesn’t look like it contains anything dangerous…
“You’re safe here with me,” John finishes. And this time, John most definitely kisses him on the forehead, startling Sherlock slightly before he returns the favour, drawing up John’s wrist to his lips as he kisses the pulse point there.
YQ: You haven't updated your fic since i last checked haha. Why not um break the chapters up into smaller chapters.
“Well, a somewhat shorter exile than we’d imagined, brother mine, although adequate given your levels of OCD,” a voice drones from the entrance of the plane.
“Found some chicken in the fridge,” it had read, “thought that it’d made a nice broth for breakfast.”
That was the first alteration he’d made to his universe.
“As your friend,” he begins, “as someone who... worries about you...”
It’d happened one of the first few times they’d had sex, after a particularly gruelling case that had left their blood singing and adrenaline soaring. They’d spun into the bedroom, clothing strewn all over the floor as John had pushed Sherlock forwards onto the bed, their lips still sealed as their bodies made contact with soft cotton.
He knows he shouldn’t be upset that John had been together with Sholto. After all, he’s had so many girlfriends, all of which Sherlock has met. But something about this revelation just… makes him feel uncomfortable.
Not just any metal thumbdrive - it’s the AGRA thumbdrive.
“So tell me, David, did you know that you’ve been harbouring and by extension possibly abetting a dangerous serial killer?”
2. The reason I didn't update was not because I was wallowing in self-pity (ok maybe I did that for a bit) but because I had an internship that lasted one and a half months that sucked my creative well dry
“Oh, that’s a relief, I was really worried… No, hold on. I really wasn’t.”
Sherlock lays his violin down on the table, moving to meet John when he notices something…
Sherlock slumps back into his seat in horror, goosebumps erupting out of his skin as he breaks into a cold sweat.
“Sherlock-”
“But you’ve only just been told,” Mary interjects, taking the seat opposite his, “We’ve only just found out. He’s on every TV screen in the country.”
With that final thought, Sherlock closes his eyes, placing a firm palm on the steel door, pushing it open slowly.
Sherlock leans back onto the pillow, sinking further down till his face is level with John’s. John seems to sense this movement because he shifts to rest his face against Sherlock’s.
“So, let’s start from the very beginning,” Sherlock sneers before giving Cameron a very wide and clearly very insincere grin.
Thank god.
The tension only mounts as they pull up to Baker Street, Sherlock’s veins singing every time he turns to look at John.
Sherlock frowns as he approaches one of the female agents in the centre, one of the few people in the room actually appearing to be calm and collected.
For the words though polished and clean had sounded clinical and calculating to his ears.
“Sounds delicious,” John answers, turning reluctantly away from the oven, his stomach gurgling as Sherlock laughs.
“A very nice photograph,” Watson sneers, seemingly determined to annoy Sherlock further.
“Thanks,” he whispers, dragging the packaging closer to him so that it rests directly under his chin. He proceeds to scoop up a ball of noodles, shovelling them into his mouth hungrily.
She’s my kid though, I’ll have to make a concession for her.
“You’d take such good care of me, you always do. Handle me slowly and carefully, holding me so gently… You’d run your fingers over every inch of my body, nails brushing against my bare skin as you lean into me-”
“Sounds good darling,” he whispers into his ear and Sherlock is certain that he might’ve just spontaneously combusted right there and then.
He’s not going to last very long.
The conversation he’d had with Cameron comes flooding back, his own words echoing back at him.
John smiles deviously in response, pushing in through the ring of muscle with a satisfied smirk as Sherlock sighs in relief.
“I suppose,” he laughs, “Except that this time, we’ll actually be together, in a proper relationship.”
He twists his gaze away from Sherlock when he doesn’t answer, his posture stiff as he stalks away in a huff.
“Both.”
“I’ve been in my Mind Palace, of course…” he answers without hesitation.
Because walking down that road could have severe repercussions for both John and him and Sherlock is sure as hell not ready to face that.
“There’s supposed to be a mechanism that allows us to link up with various pods. By right, I should be able to appear along with your consciousness… But I suspect that our ship must’ve hit an asteroid or something, resulting in the two of us being disconnected from the mainframe-”
“IF YOU HAD TOLD ME I WOULDN’T HAVE KILLED MAGNUSSEN,” he cries, bending over the table to glare at Mycroft, gesticulating vigorously, “THIS COULD HAVE ALL BEEN AVOIDED-”
“What a pity,” Sherlock replies, his voice still sounding rusty. He shifts so that he’s now sitting up, facing John. “I never liked that jumper. I thought you would have at least thrown it away after that fiasco.”
“John…” Sherlock begins, his voice calm and collected, the kind of voice you’d use to soothe a frightened animal, “Is there something wrong-”
John had his life together now, a loving wife, a future child… And Sherlock should have been happy for him, should have cheered him on like a good best friend would have, but he couldn’t… he couldn’t.
He’s obviously not hiding is very well because John sighs softly as their eyes meet, his blue eyes mellow as he bends to press a pregnant kiss to Sherlock’s forehead.
“It’s not that… it’s-”
John sighs, swirling the glass of cider in his hand before taking a huge gulp.
He doesn’t even need to look at the text to know what is coming next.
How charming.
“I’m fine,” John replies, left hand visibly clenching and unclenching, which basically means that he’s lying too.
“Sherlock..” John breathes, moving to stand as well as Sherlock raises his head to the ceiling, his eyes filled with tears.
Hey. How about the ones you haven’t solved? Any of those similar to this one?
“Oh god,” John breathes.
It’ll be okay.
“... However, this time I will not be there to help you in person. I can’t stress that enough.”
“It’s just a plain ham sandwich and some tea,” he continues, stirring the tea fitfully before reaching for the oven and drawing out the sandwich, “It’s not much but I hope-”
They beam at each other for a moment, their eyes sparkling with mirth as their gazes connect and it feels as if Sherlock has been struck by lightning because for the love of god, he can’t turn his face away.
He pours the egg and onion mix onto the frying pan, which gives a satisfying sizzle, before proceeding to stir it around with a pair of chopsticks. After about 3 minutes, the omelette is a golden yellow, fluffy and puffy. Sherlock gives a broad smile before proceeding to transfer the omelette to a nearby plate.
“That has missed the both of us and lodged its way in the wall behind us,” John rolls his eyes as an officer walks up to them with a knife, sawing Sherlock’s restraints away.
Sherlock cringes a little at the sight of the screen, the memory of the fear and terror he’d felt that day rushing back to him as he sees John once again buried under heaps of burning wood.
He doesn’t have to wonder for very long though because in a split second, John’s retracted his arms from under Sherlock’s shirt, reaching up to draw Sherlock’s lips back to his, capturing them in a searing kiss.
“Hello, little brother. How is the exile going?”
“It’s time.”
“Why didn’t you dance with anyone at the reception… that… that night?” John struggles to say, his voice cracking a little.
Sherlock is slightly shaken, not because Cameron had nearly succeeded in punching him but because he’s just come to the realisation that John has heard every word that he’s said. Every. Word. God, he hadn’t meant to have revealed that much and now he feels sick to his stomach. He should have just let the matter rest, shouldn’t have risen to Cameron’s bait. Now John is definitely going to find out. He’ll probably address it at some point, probably wait till they go home before questioning Sherlock about it. After all, John’s always been a particularly curious person. He’ll find out that Sherlock loves him, that his long-term worthless flatmate has fallen head over heels for him and then he will leave him and abandon him for Mary- and oh god, he’s really messed things up this time hasn’t he?
“... and then the little monster puked all over me! Just like that.”
Lestrade strides to John's side of the table, pulling out a chair and taking a seat next to him.
John starts the ball rolling without much preamble, his tongue licking a slow line up and down Sherlock’s parted lips before slipping through. Tangling their tongues together, John buries calloused fingers in Sherlock’s hair, the pads of his fingers rubbing circles into his scalp.
God… How could he not know?
John grins stupidly up at Sherlock as the music starts, twirling the man round and round as Sherlock giggles, falling back into John’s arms dizzy and happy.
Sherlock flips open the back of the frame, pulling out the metal stand, revealing a yellowish, flimsy sheet of print.
John looks absolutely wrecked. His beautiful blue eyes are red-rimmed and puffy and Sherlock’s heart almost breaks at the sight. Tears stream slowly down his face, curving around the lines of his jawbone to meet at his chin and Sherlock wants nothing more than to reach out and wipe them away before he remembers who he is and what they are - nothing more than flatmates, nothing more than best friends. His help would not be welcome.
“JOHN!”
“He told me you’d been blinded by love… I didn’t believe him. Guess I was wrong hmm?” she smiles and says. Sherlock has never wanted to throw up more in his life.
“Is the, er, lamp still burning?” Watson says after a moment, prompting Sherlock to turn to face the Carmichael house, gazing up at one of the few windows that are still lit.
John meets his eyes, understanding him completely as he snakes a hand down to Sherlock’s cock.
At that time, it'd felt like butterflies had filled his stomach, his body filling with a golden warmth. But now… it just feels hollow and empty, an embrace filled with sorrow and loss.
On second thought, he really doesn’t want to think about it.
I want everything.
“How do I look, huh?” he says, turning around to give Sherlock a good look at the back of his head.
“For god’s sake, I’m not thinkin- FUCK.”
And with that, John’s lips sink back down onto his cock, raking his teeth gently down the shaft as he takes Sherlock’s balls into his hand, tugging hard.
So when Mycroft’s housekeeper calls for them both to rise and meet his brother in his study, Sherlock heaves a sigh of relief, happy to leave the stifling silence behind as he rises from his seat, making his way out of the door hurriedly.
They decide on Pret A Manger for lunch since it’s the cheapest and most convenient option. Sherlock grabs a tuna sandwich while John grabs a watercress sandwich and some fruit cups. As they pile their purchases onto the counter, they discuss the exhibition, bantering back and forth over the ingenuity of the cases or the idiocy of their perpetrators.
