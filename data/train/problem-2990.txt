. The four giant screws that were poking out all around his torso also dug deeper, grinding his collar bone and parts of his ribs into dust and stabbing straight through his heart. The sound of Castiel’s cries were drowned out by the increasingly loud groans and clanks and buzzing from the high-tech screw driver next to his head. His screams gradually turned into whimpers, and into shallow breaths after that. His head fell forward, his eyes fluttering shut. Calloused fingers squeezed Cas's clammy cheeks and forcefully lifted his head back upright. Cas struggled to focus on Sabrini’s face through the haze of pain and the blood droplets. Sabrini cooed in a singsong voice, “Castiel and a human sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.” He mimicked a puking sound before giggling insanely and saying, “This discovery may present me with some interesting options, you know. I have observed the strange powers of love, and the intense pain that comes from losing someone you love. Perhaps I can use this Dean to hurt you further… Kill him? Erase his memory of you? Torture him while I force you to watch? Or maybe I’ll simply kill you both, nice and slowly… Hm, who knows? I suppose we will see how I’m feeling after this.”
Sabrini squealed with glee at this reaction. Obviously his intent was to mess with Cas's head as well as physically torture him. “Oh, how exquisite!” he croaked and clapped his hands together. “After all those decades of being the one in your position, it is rather nice to be the one calling the shots, to be the one making the
Dean gulped again and glanced briefly at Castiel’s lips before saying in a husky voice, “Be careful what you say. I might make you stay forever.”
Finally Dean focused on him again, and Cas realized he was still staring at Dean’s mouth and he wanted to punch himself. This was another thing that Cas had learned about love- it made one do foolish things outside of their control, as if the body disconnects from the mind and follows it’s own unreasonable commands, just like what had happened the previous night that had started this entire mess! But this time was different, because Dean wasn’t pulling away. Clearly he had noticed where Castiel’s eyes had been. Clearly he noticed how Cas was now squeezing his hand harder because he was feeling so overwhelmed and uncertain, and Cas was growing tired of feeling those things tonight. And he had to notice Castiel’s breathing become shallow and his cheeks turn red… but still Dean didn’t pull away. In fact Cas was quite sure he was leaning in, and he had about a half a second of excited anticipation before a deafening bang made them both jump up. The ground shook beneath their feet as they heard a series of rumbles in the walls.
Cas tilted his head. “I make you uncomfortable? My apologies… I have been trying to work on my ‘social skills,’ but I suppose I still have much to learn.”
“Yes. How I feel… emotions. Sadness, fear, peace, happiness, anger… Everything.” Cas couldn’t bring himself to say ‘love,’ although that’s what he was feeling in that moment. In all moments with Dean, actually. “When my grace was gone, I discovered the true range of human emotion… I
Dean rolled his eyes at Castiel’s use of air quotes and replied, “I said, let’s head back to the bunker. It’s only a two hour drive and I don’t want to sleep in this hotel.”
Cas felt the ground disappear beneath him and knew that they were no longer in the bunker hallway. He was being flown to an unknown location by a previously unknown enemy, and his only allies in the world were unconscious at the moment and would have no idea where to find him.
With a condescending tisk of his tongue, Sabrini chided, “Now, now, Castiel, stop fussing. It is completely futile and, frankly, quite irritating and childish. Besides-“ Sabrini wrapped a cold hand around Castiel’s neck and squeezed, savoring the sounds of the gags and chokes that resulted. Icy, grayish green eyes were then right in front of Cas’s face, eyes that were void of all remorse, void of anything, really, much like Castiel’s own in Dean’s nightmare. They stared straight through Cas and chilled his bones. Sabrini continued, “I don’t plan on erasing any memories, but rather on restoring some rather significant ones. At least, significant in regards to
; killing Dean over and over in that wretched simulation, watching him beg for mercy but draining the life out of him anyway, time and again; the hurt of betrayal in Dean’s eyes when he found out that Cas had lied straight to his face about working with Crowley to access purgatory… The list of his past wrongs seemed endless, it was no wonder Dean didn’t trust him. Cas felt as if he was going to combust from the guilt and sadness coursing through him.
He couldn’t really do that, obviously, so instead he said what he was thinking, social cues be damned. “Dean, only someone with as good of a soul as you would ask me to stay here forever after everything I’ve done… I
Sabrini must have sensed Castiel’s rising terror. He turned around with an evil glint in his eyes. “Ah, you recognize this, do you? Splendid!” With a buoyant energy he lifted the contraption and set it on a shelf on the right, out of range of Castiel’s peripheral vision but so solidly and surely
Unfortunately that’s not how it panned out. The awkward tension was palpable as Sam and Dean drank their coffee and Cas sat nearby pretending to be looking for a case on the computer. Poor Sam tried his hardest to get a conversation flowing, but Dean’s avoidance of Castiel’s gaze and short answers to his brother eventually made him give up.
different than other angels. “I believe I have picked up some human quirks, but the more substantial change is in how different I
Do you hear me? I don’t care what my stupid brain conjures up when I sleep because that’s all bullshit. Fuck dream psychology and Freud and whatever else! Just… just know that
Knowing very well the potential consequences of his morally questionable decision, Cas slowly sat himself on the bed next to Dean’s sleeping form and then closed his eyes. A whir of color flashed before his eyes and then the image slowly focused, the colors making their way into blurry shapes of the unconscious. Cas saw Dean and Sam kneeling on a street with their hands up in surrender. Before them stood a shadowy human figure, the face switching from fuzzy versions of Meg to Ruby, then to Azazel, then to Lilith, then Dick Roman, Zacariah, Crowley, Metatron, Lucifer… a deadly mixture of all of their greatest enemies.
.” Cas kept his eyes down but he could practically see Dean’s worried confusion. He felt Dean’s hands tighten on his shoulders.
Finally Sam jerked to a sitting position with an incredible gasp, his hands going instinctively to where the blade had been plunged into his gut and where there was no longer any wound. He looked at Cas with bewildered eyes. Cas smiled weakly in satisfaction, and turned his head to meet Dean’s eyes.
The image of Sabrini hurting Dean or Sam in any way caused a rage in Cas so profound that he managed to roar, “NO!!” and proceeded to struggle against the chains with a newfound determination, part of him even hoping that he would fight so hard that the chains would simply cut off his hands and feet so he could escape, get off this metal sheet and kill Sabrini and go make sure the Winchesters were safe, and Cas would tell Dean he loved him and kiss him until they couldn’t breathe anymore because so much time for them to be together has already been wasted. Classic regrets of lost chances at love when someone knows they might die. Cas fought even harder, pieces of bloody flesh now falling from his wrists and ankles where the chains hadn’t budged at all.
Sam chimed in after swallowing another shot, “I swear, Dean, the bunker has made you so spoiled. You do remember that we used to
Rowena's voice sounded so faint, like she was standing a mile away and her voice was being carried to him by a light wind. Cas tried to think back to the memory of following Sabrini here, to recall the exact words for the spell but it felt like trying to swim against a tide. He was getting weaker and he couldn’t think straight. For a moment he couldn’t even remember what he was supposed to be remembering.
“Dean, I-“ That’s all Cas managed to get out before his throat painfully closed up and an involuntary choking sound escaped his lips, more fresh tears draining from his eyes. Crying was a curious act indeed, one that Castiel did not like one bit.
“Now, Sam!” Rowena commanded through gritted teeth as she focused on her unseen forces, her eyes glowing yellow.
It was easy to see how uncomfortable Dean was and Cas felt terrible for being the cause of it, so he decided to step away, at least for a little bit. He shut the computer with purpose, stood up, and made up a generic excuse to get out of there. “I’m afraid I have to leave. An angel, one I consider a close comrade has called for my help. It’s nothing big. She is simply having troubles adjusting to life on Earth, as I’m sure all of my fellow rebels are.”
Something like sadness flashed in Dean’s eyes. He looked down and seemed to choose his words very carefully. “I know, but sometimes I would swear that you’re turning more human every day. You know, like fidgeting and pacing and stuff.”
it, Dean. In your mind I felt your pain as if it was my own, and- and to hear you say that’s it’s forgotten and that I should let it go… I don’t know how to do that while your anguish is still coursing through me.”
Cas turned back to Dean with a heavy heart and cleared his throat before saying, “This ‘human thing,’ as you say… I must admit that it’s quite overwhelming, even after these past years of experiencing it. For instance, a mere photograph can stir up an entire range of emotions in less than two seconds… remarkable." Cas sighed before setting the picture back in it’s place.
Dean smirked slightly. “Using my own words against me, huh? You know, you’re getting pretty good at this ‘human’ thing. It’s a little scary.”
Suddenly two hands were shaking his shoulders. “Cas! What’s wrong? What happened?” Dean’s concerned green eyes bore into Castiel’s teary ones, the nightmare obviously vanished from his mind as soon as he returned to consciousness and saw Cas in his current state.
Cas's eyes widened from shock as the screw lodged in his heart started to jerk randomly up and down, side to side, until Cas was sure his entire chest was going to explode. Sabrini’s eyes remained focused on the machine, skittering from left to right as he read whatever the monitor was conveying. No more sound was coming from Cas, for the pain was too great for a mere scream to do it any justice.
Although Cas had been through this particular scenario before, it made the grief of losing his grace no less great, for he was again losing an integral part of himself, and so shortly after getting it back. It made him feel naked and hollowed out and used and worthless. If only he could rip apart these damned chains! At the rate his grace was escaping, he still had at least ten minutes until it was gone completely…
Cas shook his head. That was something he couldn’t do, not when Dean’s pain was so fresh in his mind, in his heart. He gently grabbed Dean’s hands and removed them from his shoulders. “You should be sleeping,” Cas said as he saw how bloodshot the hunter’s eyes were. Dean should have been resting peacefully, not trying to comfort Cas at four in the morning over something that was his own fault.
The image of the battlefield faded away and was instantly replaced by a different, yet equally grotesque and disturbing, setting in which the next memory would play out.
Cas had said those hateful things to Dean so long ago and yet they were apparently engrained into the hunter's psyche, forever haunting him and Cas both- of course, any time that Cas had caused the Winchesters pain would plague the angel forever, but now he knew that Dean was suffering the same post-traumatic fear and it broke his heart.
Cas could hear the scuffle of fighting, but everything was becoming slurred and discombobulated around him and he couldn’t keep track of anything. “Shit!” Dean yelled, and then he was gone, out of Castiel’s view and jumping into the fight. Cas couldn’t judge how long this went on, as time seemed to move more strangely when one was on the verge of death. He heard Sam continue his chant in broken, winded streams as he dodged Sabrini’s relentless attacks. “Das keenu mann…. Abs altok exo!”
“Well then I think we’ve paid our dues and deserve to sleep in our own beds, Sammy.” Dean punched him on the shoulder and ruffled his long hair before grabbing his bag. He pulled his keys out of his pocket and twirled them on his finger. “Let’s roll!” he said happily and walked out with that playful swagger that was uniquely Dean’s.
Cas was rendered speechless. He simply looked at the man before him in awe. Why Cas was the lucky enough angel to have this mysterious glitch inside him, to meet Dean and experience all of this, he’ll never know. Cas just knew how incredibly grateful he was that Dean Winchester, the righteous man with the most amazing soul Cas had ever seen, considered Cas a friend and was selfless enough to forgive Castiel’s endless wrong-doings, his long list of mistakes that had hurt Dean so deeply. At this point even more tears were rolling down Castiel’s cheeks, but he hardly noticed anymore.
Dean slammed his shot glass on the table and gulped the burning liquid down. “Sam, like you said before, he’s a freaking angel. They don’t feel these kind of things like we do, so just drop it.”
Sam’s eyebrows furrowed in concern as he looked at the hallway where Dean disappeared, but then he must have decided that it was better to leave his brother alone. He turned back to Cas. “So, what are you up to, now?”
To his surprise Dean let out a dark chuckle. “Of course something inside my fucked up head would spook a goddamn
Castiel!” Sabrini spat, his gray eyes blazing like a flashing thunderstorm. “You don’t realize how powerful we could have been! You were my brother. We could have ruled
Cas's eye’s glowed bright blue. He clenched his teeth in his effort to use every last drop of grace he could muster. And the pain, God, the
Horrible memories started plaguing Castiel’s vision: Dean’s broken and pleading voice when Naomi had nearly forced Cas to kill him.
.” It wasn’t only Dean’s heartbreak that Cas felt, but also his own guilt and regret because he remembered saying those exact words to the real Dean years ago.
Cas sat down at a worn bench next to the bathrooms. The area around them had scattered trees sprinkling across the grassy field. He tilted his head up and looked at the vast array of stars in the clear, black sky and the sounds of crickets and locusts met his ears. Cas closed his eyes and enjoyed the feeling of tranquility that only God’s creation could bring him.
That’s when Cas zapped back to reality, and for a moment he didn’t even realize that he was trembling and that tears were running down his face, or that Dean had startled awake at the worst part of his nightmare and was now staring at Cas with groggy eyes as he processed what he’d woken up to.
“No, I don’t plan on returning to heaven any time soon. I doubt I am very well liked at the moment, and I consider myself lucky that they have let me keep my grace. It’s better not to push my limits.”
Some part of him registered the fact that Sabrini was now detaching the screws from his body, still streaming invective but Cas couldn’t begin to tell you what was said. More and more grace swirled out of his body, and he felt closer to death at every escaped sliver.
But then Dean pulled away and cleared his throat, releasing his hand from Cas's grip, and once again it felt like a part of the angel was missing. Without looking straight at Cas, Dean stood up and mumbled, “Don’t make promises you can’t keep. Come on, let’s get going.”
He actually flinched a little when Dean gently wiped a fallen tear. Cas opened his eyes to see Dean looking straight at him, his warm hand still on the angel’s cheek. Cas said in a quietly desperate tone, “After everything I’ve done to you, Dean, can you please just allow me to give you one night of peaceful sleep?”
And that’s how he found himself in New York City on this blistering cold night. He had been sitting here all day and he still had no clarity of any kind. Yes, it was nothing short of cowardly to run away from a problem
“Dean,” he interrupted, trying to hide his smile at how flustered Dean was getting. Was it possible that Dean experienced the same light-headedness when it came to physical contact? Because right now Castiel’s whole left side felt like it was on fire, a very pleasant fire. “Of course I’ll stay with you. As long as you wish.”
Slowly but surely, Cas was growing accustomed to the complicated spectrum of human emotions. He only had one problem with it, and that problem was the reason that Cas had chosen this random location to sit and think for hours. That problem was Dean- well, the way Cas
The unfortunate occupant of this room in the 1940s was Demetrion, the very commander that Sabrini had told Cas was reassigned more than a month ago, in the previous memory…
“Don’t!” he yelled again. The chains started digging into the skin on his wrists and ankles with how hard he was trying to escape, red and purple circles of raw, bloody flesh.
Castiel’s hand froze in front of Dean’s troubled face. Maybe he could peek into Dean’s head just this once… because why would he be dreaming that Cas would leave him when he needed help?
A twisted grin spread across Sabrini's face, and Cas noticed that even the vessel he had chosen had a natural, maniacal look in his hollowed, gray eyes, and a gaunt, narrow face with a graying beard and a sinister quirk to his thin mouth. “Now,” he continued in a businesslike manner, “Let me see how far along we are…”
, and the torture device reached a screeching crescendo in Castiel’s ears, piercing his brain with it’s menacing squeaks and whirs and buzzes. A blood curdling scream ripped through Castiel’s chest when suddenly it felt like his insides were being sliced with a thousand razor blades. His body shook violently against the metal as the electric pain made it’s way through his whole body, but it wasn’t only physical pain he was feeling. It went deeper than that, and not in the emotional sense, but as if the very fiber of his being, his very
The silence that followed this little speech was suffocating. Dean just looked at Cas through the mirror, slightly opened-mouthed, and Cas realized that once again his truthfulness had made Dean uncomfortable… Dean had said that honesty was always the best option, but perhaps it was different with certain situations such as this. Suddenly Dean turned around and walked over to stand squarely in front of him with such determination in his stance that Cas couldn’t bring himself to move. He steeled himself and tried to look Dean in the eyes with as much courage as he could scrap together, unsure of what was coming.
Cas sighed and ran a hand through his hair, yet another human gesture. “Don’t worry about me, Dean.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, a trait he’d picked up over the years of spending time with the brothers. “Dean, I have had my full grace restored for a while now. It won’t be a problem.”
Sabrini’s knees started to shake, and he became enraged. “You abominable whore! How dare you!” He threw himself at Rowena with flailing arms, slashing the air randomly with the angel blade, but Rowena, eyes now shut in concentration, raised a hand and stopped him in his tracks.
him? The empty space that Dean left throbbed painfully in his chest as he followed along to the car, where Sam was still fast asleep.
“It won’t be long now,” Sabrini’s voice from somewhere above him was drenched in bloodlust, drowning in the twisted pleasure of revenge. “Soon you will cease to exist, and then I will track down this Dean and torture him for the rest of his natural life, and there won’t be a damned thing you can do about it! Your precious
… Why did Cas have to want more? Why couldn’t he be content with simply having Dean in his life at all? And, for the love of all that is holy, why did Cas have to lose control of his senses and kiss him? Who was he kidding, he knew why he had done it, after all this time of secret pining and reigning in his urges. He did it because of what he had overheard between the brothers earlier.
… and apparently that was when Cas had reached his limit in terms of absolute, unbearable agony, because he closed his eyes, fell to his face with a
, because he had just entered the very torture chamber that Cas found himself in currently. There was the same vertical, steel table with the warded chains, the same rickety shelf next to it containing numerous foreboding utensils, and the very drill that was lodging it’s screws into Cas's flesh at this very moment.
Cas watched all of this with an amused expression and followed them wordlessly to the car. Within a few minutes Sam was snoring, leaving Cas and Dean in a content silence save for the soft sounds of The Beatles coming from the speakers and the road passing beneath them. When ‘Hey, Jude' came on Cas enjoyed the sound of Dean’s quiet humming, and his heart warmed up every time he saw Dean glance to the back seat to make sure he wasn’t disturbing his brother while he slept. This was one of those moments that Cas felt truly happy. The angel knew that if he was given the option to spend an eternity in this car with them, listening to classic rock and seeing Dean’s smile as he sang his lungs out and listening to their endless brotherly bickering, Cas would choose that life in an instant. He looked over at Dean’s profile and smiled, unnoticed by the hunter.
Cas struggled fruitlessly against the invisible force on top of him. Sabrini gripped Castiel’s hair in his bony fingers and brought his face to eye level, staring Cas down for a moment before punching him in his temple with a force that would have killed a human, but Cas just felt the extreme physical pain of it and then everything started to become cloudy. With a malicious smirk Sabrini hissed in his ear, “Time for us to do some catching up.”
After a strained gulp Cas stuttered out something like, “I’m sorry, Dean. So- so sorry, I wish- I-I-I-“ White spots started to obstruct his vision as he struggled to choke out any more words. It would appear that his body was not functioning properly, but Cas was aware that this is what humans call ‘hyperventilating.’ Despite the lack of oxygen to his brain and his fogging vision, Cas kept trying to apologize, as if any number of apologies could take away Dean’s pain and appease his own guilt. “Sor-sor-ry, D-Dean!” Cas barely registered Dean’s appalled expression before the hunter's strong arms were around him so firmly it was as if he was trying to hold Cas together.
indulge in my revenge a little bit? And then…” A disturbed, demented, and unnatural sound that no one would ever associate with an angel escaped Sabrini’s mouth. “And
Cas wiped the tears from his face and looked at the wetness on his hands with a curious expression. Dean stayed sitting but watched him with worried eyes, and Cas supposed he owed at least a little bit of explanation for this rude awakening. His voice still strained, he said lowly, “You prayed to me.”
This was when Cas decided to show himself, already feeling guilty about accidentally eavesdropping, and upon his sudden appearance Dean jumped and almost dropped his glass. “Dammit, Cas!”
“AAAAAAHHHHHH!” Cas was dragged downward with a sudden yank and forced into his body with a suctioned
Castiel’s heart was now beating in his throat. It was like the world consisted of only him, Dean, and this tiny charged bubble around them. As if just realizing that he said those words out loud, Dean’s eyes widened and Cas knew he was about to get up and leave and pop this intoxicating bubble, so he timidly placed his hand on top of Dean’s (
Castiel knew that he had wronged the Winchesters many times in the past… he should have known it would take a long time to rebuild that trust, but this was a promise that Castiel knew he would keep: As long as Dean Winchester allowed Cas to be in his life, that is exactly where he would stay. Unfortunately, he was now unsure if Dean wanted him around at all, and it was all his fault.
It was barely a graze of their lips, a feather-light touch that made Castiel’s insides burn with the longing he’d been pushing down ever since he’d saved Dean’s soul. Dean’s lips were rough and soft at the same time, and Cas could smell the faint odor of whiskey on them…
Then Cas screamed as Sabrini viciously slashed diagonally down his entire torso with the angel blade, starting at the screw in his heart and ending at his right hip, leaving a dark trail of ominous blood oozing from the gaping slash, along with more tufts of grace.
will suffer at the hands of a crazed, blood-thirsty angel, and I’ll make sure to tell him that it’s all your fault, Castiel. Every piece of cut flesh, every drop of blood spilled, every single broken bone- and mark my words, there will be
. He’ll be fine. Now let’s go.” He grabbed Dean by the shoulder and hauled him out of the room, hoisting the duffel bag containing the necessary hunting supplies on his other shoulder as he went.
, no less! The very human who jump-started the apocalypse. The very human that he had so bravely rescued from Hell. How… unpredictably pathetic.” Sabrini shook his head and scoffed.
wrong. This Castiel’s eyes were hard and distant, his mouth in a sharp line, and he walked agonizingly slowly despite the dire situation. Dream Cas stood before Dean, looking down on him as if he were a mere piece of dirt, his stare as cold as ice… A chill ran through the real Castiel’s spine when he realized that the expression was identical to the one that he’d worn when he was beating the life out of Dean under Naomi's command… when he was nothing but an animal trained to kill.
, Cas got a second wind and shakily pulled himself up to his hands and knees. With painful, strangled breaths the entire way, he crawled over the small- yet seemingly endless- linoleum floor to where Sam had collapsed. Cas could still feel some of his grace left in him, and he just hoped it was enough…
. With a satisfied smirk on his dying lips, Sabrini collapsed into a smoking heap on the ground, his sockets hollowed and blackened. Rowena let out a strangled breath and fell to the floor from the force of the magic she had just used, and Sam looked down at his bleeding gut with wide, shocked eyes before stumbling to the ground, as well.
Dean looked at Cas with panic-stricken eyes and yelled, “The warding is broken!” and no sooner had the words escaped his lips did the red alarm lights start flashing and loud ringing pierced their ears. “Sam!” Dean breathed, and without further ado he grabbed a blade, a gun loaded with silver bullets, and a flask of holy water mixed with borax from his dresser and was out the door. Cas followed on numb legs, adrenaline pumping as he followed Dean’s lead.
at the moment, began to spin, and the colors from the crystal had gotten so bright and were flashing so rapidly that Cas got lost in a nauseating display of what came off as rainbow strobe lights. He could barely make out the vague shapes of Sam, Dean, and Rowena when they flashed repeatedly in front of his spinning view. His body appeared to rotate underneath him, faster and faster, and soon all Cas could see around him were dizzying neon colors.
Cas looked down, the empathy in Dean’s green stare too much for him to take. “Your nightmare-“ he began, but his throat closed up again as he remembered Dean’s agony.
!” He kicked Cas in his broken and grinded ribs, but Cas hardly felt it. He was being pulled into darkness. He was vaguely aware of his own shallow, panting breaths against the blood-soaked floor as his consciousness started to recede into the endless black.
During this exchange Dean had run over and threw himself to his knees next to Cas with a panicked cry. “Cas!” he said brokenly as he delicately hoisted Cas up by the shoulders. “Cas, open your eyes!”
Sam put his arm around his brother, looking at Cas's tortured body with a mix of sorrow and disgust.
Sam’s tall form emerged at the far end of the hallway. He spotted Dean and Cas and began running toward them, also armed with his own assortment of weapons. Suddenly Cas felt something tightly grip his legs and send him sprawling to the ground. He let out a surprised yell as he scrambled to his knees and whipped around to see who or what caused his fall.
Sabrini’s eyes landed on Sam and Dean, both armed and ready and about to strike. With a wistful smile Sabrini snapped his fingers and the boys fell to the ground into a forced slumber.
yet he was somehow consciously aware of himself floating above his broken corpse, and though he had no eyes as far as he could tell, he could still see Dean’s panic stricken face as he lifted the upper half of Cas's lifeless body onto his lap and said over and over, “No, no, no,
Somehow their faces were now mere inches apart, and a thrilling electricity made its way through Castiel's body. He could feel Dean’s breath on his lips, could smell Dean’s shampoo, could see the flecks of brown in his green eyes. Cas was being suffocated by everything
There was a blinding light, and even as Sabrini’s eyes were being burned from their sockets, he managed one final, evil act. In one swift motion he shoved the angel blade clean through Sam’s gut, and the bloody point protruded from Sam’s tailbone with a metallic
to be abandoned and left to die. “No!” Cas moaned and  attempted to climb to his hands and knees, but it was as if gravity was working against him. “Dean! I’m coming!” he rasped and desperately tried to crawl his way across the concrete, but then Sam and the demon came back into focus and everything resumed at normal speed. Cas heard the sickening crack of Sam’s neck and curled into the fetal position from the overwhelming grief that it caused Dean. Cas tried yelling again, “No!” but nothing came out except a strangled breath…
Sometimes Cas wished he could sleep just to pass the monotonous hours, especially tonight.  If only he could lay his head down and escape his thoughts and wake up feeling refreshed. Instead, he passed the time silently sitting in the bedroom he chose, hoping beyond hope that, come morning, everything will have blown over. Perhaps he and Dean could just pretend nothing happened and go back to normal, whatever ‘normal' was in this life.
At first Cas thought he had been spotted, but he then realized that Dean was looking in the opposite direction. Cas followed his gaze and saw a silhouette of himself in the foggy distance, and as this dream version of him got closer he knew immediately that something was
Without a second thought the angel leaped off of the thousand-foot building, and less than a second later he was bolting down the stairs of the bunker, mentally cursing the warding that kept him from getting straight to Dean.
Suddenly a blue light flashed on and off in the darkness, and Cas felt like he was being forced through an extremely pressurized tube. The endless sphere of black and blue smoke was closing in and constricting him until he was sure he was literally going to pop. Then,
“Oh. Well, you’re welcome to stay at the bunker.” At this point Dean turned back to him and seemed to just notice how close they were. Cas heard his breath catch and would swear he was… No, it must have been these human eyes playing tricks on him.
Again Cas shook his head. This guilt was too much and Deans concerned expression only made it worse. Why Dean still cared one bit for Cas, he’ll never understand. “Nothing, Dean. Just sleep now.” Cas raised his fingers.
No, those details went unnoticed because all he could focus on was Dean’s despair. The angel’s body and ‘soul,’ for lack of a better word, was still drowning in Dean’s fear and grief. How Dean had lived with nightmares almost his entire life and still managed to get any decent sleep, Cas couldn’t begin to fathom.
A smile broke through Castiel’s current despair as he remembered the conversation. Of course it was in Dean’s nature to be a protector, but Cas couldn’t help the fluttering warmth from spreading through his vessel when Dean would worry about him like that. Castiel now knew that this sensation in his vessel could be attributed to the whole ‘love' dilemma.
that.” Dean started pacing around his small bedroom. He brought his hand up to his chin and began roughly stroking his stubble, something Cas knew he did when he was deeply unsettled. Cas could see his troubled features in the mirror above Dean’s dresser, and a part of him was tempted to just overpower Dean and force him to go back to sleep so that Cas could wallow in self-pity in peace.
sound. The all too familiar physical pain returned with a vengeance and hit Cas like a meteor strike, and without opening his eyes he was writhing and screaming in Dean’s arms. “AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!”
was sinking to the bottom. When Cas tried to scream it got caught in his throat, like a painful air bubble was blocking any sound from escaping. Cas could have been in this strange limbo for minutes, hours, days… Time seemed much more fluid here, where ever ‘here' was, and it gave Cas time to get well and truly frightened at his current situation, as well as confused at why this was happening.
that Cas could feel himself start to shake, for there was no worse feeling of personal violation than when one discovers that their own memories have been erased or tampered with. Castiel shuddered to think of how much of his own history he failed to recall.
?), and barely managed to whisper, “Then I’ll stay forever.” Their eyes locked together for one second before Cas slowly closed the small gap between them.
in the first place, but he knew this to be true: the moment he laid his hand on Dean Winchester's soul, something was sparked at the very core of his being, and since then whatever that spark had contained had spread through Cas like a drug spreads through one’s bloodstream. He had been consumed by humanity and all of the incomprehensible emotions that came with it, all because of one human… how was that possible?
It had been years since he had rescued Dean from Hell, yet he still could not explain in words what he felt for the man, and he couldn’t begin to articulate how it was Dean himself that made Cas able to feel
Sabrini chuckled softly. “Well, well, what do we have here?” He shoved Cas's body aside with his foot as he stalked toward them. “A witch, huh? My, my Castiel, the company you keep these days! And
At the sound of his voice Cas found the strength to lift his head a fraction of an inch. Dean, Sam, and Rowena came bursting through the doorway like a stampede of the most peculiar search-and-rescue team you’ve ever seen.
did Dean really think that Cas could possibly feel nothing after all they had been through? Did he truly believe that Cas didn’t genuinely care about him and his brother? Is that why he looked so crestfallen a moment ago when Cas reminded him that he was, indeed, an angel?
Castiel's heart sank. Why would Dean think that he wouldn’t stay with him? Could he really not see how much Cas needed him, how much Cas
He then hoisted up yet another metal object, this one fashioned in a similar way as a vest, with four giant screws that, when Sabrini latched the vest onto Castiel’s torso, aligned to his heart, collar bone, and one each ready to pierce into both sides of his ribs. This was new. Castiel had plenty of experience with drills and screws in his brain, but never had his tormentors penetrated anywhere on his body with these implements. For what purpose Sabrini did this, Castiel didn’t want to begin to fathom, but even the vague possibilities sent pure dread coursing through Cas.
had caused, but he couldn’t stand the fact that Dean could barely look at him, and those words kept ringing through his head:
, was being slashed apart and squeezed and mutilated, and Castiel had no idea how Sabrini was doing it, or what it meant, or if he would survive it. Scream upon scream escaped his lips, mainly unheard over the mechanical sounds and Sabrini’s manic laughter. When the unbearable agony subsided the slightest bit,  Cas lolled his head to the side, sweaty and panting and feeling like he was broken into a million pieces. With closed eyes Cas heaved, “Sabrini… why… are you doing… this?”
A freezing wind gusted around Cas as he perched upon a random New York City skyscraper. Why he’d chosen this place to clear his head he didn’t know, but the terrible weather seemed fitting considering the situation. Castiel almost wished he could go back to the days when he was but a mere soldier with no emotions. Follow orders. Wait for more. Repeat. Such a simple existence.
Finally Dean turned to look at him with a bemused expression. “You know, Cas, I’ve never met anyone as good at being as uncomfortably honest as you.”
“Me!” Jack yells, running into the kitchen to take out plates. Everyone bustles in and starts dishing themselves up.
“We need to lay down some ground rules,” Sam says, leaning against the counter in his typical authority stance. Dean automatically sighs, knowing that whatever is coming is gonna be stupid. He waves his brother on anyways.
Sam couldn’t fault Eileen. He was the one who didn’t go to her after Dean passed away. He knew that there was no way he could be in a relationship after that. Maybe it was because Dean was his soulmate or whatever, but every time he tried to get with someone, the Dean-shaped hole just felt bigger and emptier than ever. He did eventually have a son, but it was more of an adoption. The kid wasn’t really his, but it definitely gave him a purpose in life. He named him after Dean, but ended up just calling him DJ. The name Dean had too much attached to it to just throw around willy nilly.
“You’re good,” Dean leans in to peck a quick kiss against the angel’s lips, “Just remembering yesterday. Hell of a day, huh?”
“No. Cas is an angel. It’s not really the same thing. And even I don’t know how to break a soulmate bond. That’s one of the strongest things to exist. Sorry guys.” Jack hangs his head, and Sam feels a little bad for making Jack think that they were disappointed in him.
“Well you were really sad when you left last night. I wanted to make sure you were okay. Are you still sad?” Jack asked, eyes wide and worried.
Castiel glances at Dean fondly, a smile dancing over his lips as Dean uses his hands to tell Mary about something that happened last night. He remembers that night, when he got taken by the empty. He had always loved Dean, probably more than he should have. When he had confessed and Dean didn’t reciprocate, well, he thought things were over. They would have been over anyways, so he was surprised when he found himself back in heaven, with Jack, no less. When he heard about Dean’s passing away, he didn’t want to see him right away. He was scared of what Dean would say, because surely the hunter heard him that night in the bunker. So he waited. He waited until Sam finally came along, the brothers reunited and together, everything was right with the world once again.
Everyone is fairly quiet for the first few minutes, reveling in the banana pancakes with eggs and bacon (cooked to perfection). Jack and Cas start talking about a few changes that were needed to heaven, but most of that conversation went over everyone else’s heads. Dean quotes Inception and him and Charlie start geeking out and talking about Leonardo DiCaprio (“I don’t care who you are, that man is attractive” Charlie says, Dean vehemently agreeing). John and Mary start talking about some carpet that she wanted but John had deemed “too bright”. Everyone was caught up in their conversations and suddenly Sam was feeling like the odd man out.
They didn’t really need someone on earth though. Jack decided to be pretty hands-off, and the only thing Gabriel was really doing down there was reporting back on what was going on. Cas hopes that the archangel will eventually see the value in staying in heaven. He misses his brother, and watching him and Sam interact… Well, he can feel the devotion and love pouring off of his brother every time he catches him looking at the younger Winchester. He feels the same emotions from Sam, but to a much lesser extent, befuddled by confusion and hesitance.
“Sure then. I’ll call them.” Sam replies, wiping his hands on a towel before heading for the phone. They have an old landline in the house. He wasn’t sure why Jack had included it, but Sam was a huge fan of it, so he never said anything about it being out of place.
Once they finally got situated again, the conversation slowly started back up again. Dean, and Mary started talking about the reception and the amazing decor done at the roadhouse, with John sitting awkwardly nodding at the right times. Charlie decided that her and Gabe were supposed to be the best of friends, and began asking him what his Harry Potter house was. Gabriel pretended to lean over Sam to talk to Charlie, but Cas caught the firmly planted hand on Sam’s knee and chuckled to himself at Sam’s blushing face.
Sam laughs and Jack smiles a little unsurely. He probably didn’t understand their definition of entertainment, but Sam didn’t really feel like explaining, and Jack didn’t ask. Dean goes back to flipping pancakes and watching the bacon with a careful eye. He wasn’t picky about it normally, but when he was the one cooking, he was disappointed if it was less than perfect. Sam flipped on the radio in the corner of the kitchen, smiling at the best of 60s, 70s, and 80s spilling out of the speakers. He glanced at Jack, who winked at him before focusing back on whatever Dean was trying to teach him.
“What--” Sam stops as Charlie raises a finger to her lips, pointing to the kitchen. Jack walks over, glowing with pride as the sound of Someday Soon by Judy Collins comes spilling out of the kitchen. Mary is looking into the kitchen smiling fondly, and Sam’s eyes track her line of sight. Dean and Cas are swaying slowly in the kitchen, dancing together to the song that has so much love and sadness attached to it from so many years ago.
“Yeppers,” Gabriel says, pulling up a chair, “Now, where should I sit? I mean, I could just sit in Sam’s lap, if that’s better for everyone.”
Dean really doesn’t remember much from yesterday as he wakes up next to Cas. Light is shining in through the windows, casting an ethereal glow on his b-- no, husband’s, face. He smiles, trying to remember what the hell had even happened yesterday. He remembers vividly his vows (he almost tears up again thinking about it), he remembers the first dance (to Unchained Melody, obviously), but everything after is a little blurry. He vaguely remembers John saying something and getting beaten up for it (Dean has a really hard time feeling bad for that). Sam and his mom were crying practically the whole time too, even Bobby had some shed tears, which Dean was shocked at. Although, just having all of his friends and family together really made him emotional as well.
Everyone’s conversations die out at the sound of the doorbell ringing, and Sam quickly gets up, reassuring everyone that he can go get it. Saved by the bell he muses to himself as he hastily goes to the door. He doesn’t think they’re expecting anyone, but he was glad for the excuse to get up from the table. He’s not sure why Charlie was nervous. She fits in with his family better than Sam ever had. The closer he gets to the door, the more depressed he finds himself. He knows that time works differently here, but he hadn’t seen anyone at that table for decades before a few months ago. He feels like a completely different person. And maybe they can all shake off their life from before, but it still weighs on Sam like a yolk on his shoulders. The tens of years, half suicidal with grief, just to be thrust into Jack’s utopian heaven that is everything Sam had ever wanted. It feels wrong. Just reaching for the doorknob feels wrong.
Jack nodded, giving a little shy smile before heading out of the room. Sam was about to follow him when he heard a loud thump from the other side of the wall and a moan. He blushed and cleared his throat, quickly ushering Jack downstairs. Jack turned around, looking up at Sam with concern painted all over his face.
“At my fucking wedding too. The bastard,” Dean laughs. Sam grins wider at Dean’s acceptance of their father’s awfulness.
Cas went right over to the coffee pot, which was somehow full of hot coffee. Sam sends another glance Jack’s way, who just smiles again. What a Fool Believes by The Doobie Brothers starts playing on the radio and Dean starts to groove along to the music again. A little less enthusiastically now that Cas was in the room. Apparently he was fine with acting like an idiot in front of Sam and Jack, but Cas was a different story. Sam raised his eyebrows and Jack nodded, causing the music to become louder. Dean smiles and sways as he flips the bacon. Cas comes up behind him and whispers something in his ear, making him blush again and chuckle. The angel wraps his arms around Dean’s middle and sways a little with him.
“Heyo, Sam,” Charlie yawned from the other end of the line, “Good to hear you are alive. Was a hell of a party, eh?”
“Sam-shine?” Sam asks after Gabriel finishes dishing himself up a huge helping of banana pancakes covered in syrup and whipped cream. “That’s a new one.”
“Dean,” John says, putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean whips around and tries to put on a blank face, but he can’t help the satisfaction at seeing the major shiner Sam had given him.
“What?” Sam runs through what happened last night in his head. God, he hopes nothing awful happened. Honestly the last thing he remembers is beating up John. But that shouldn’t warrant a check-up, right?
“Do you think we can get them to dance?” Jack whispers to Sam after walking over to his place in the doorway.
“You okay with inviting someone over for breakfast? Just mom and maybe Charlie? I didn’t really get to talk to them last night.”
Sam started tapping his foot and nodding his head to the beat as Jack tried to copy whatever Dean was doing. It looked awful, but Jack had a huge smile on his face as he tried his best to move to the beat of the song. They probably made a lot of noise as they danced and laughed, badly, albeit loudly, to the song, because it wasn’t long before Cas came plodding down the stairs. It was still odd for Sam to see him wear normal clothes, but there was something so endearing about the angel being clothed in sweatpants and Dean’s old Zeppelin tee.
“Can’t we just get separate houses? Jack, can’t you just like, zap up a new one so we don’t have to live together?” Dean huffs.
Anyways, that felt like ages ago. Dean had yet to hear the full story of Sam's life away from him, but he was honestly really glad for it. He didn't really want to relive that painful life any more than Dean seemed to want to hear about it. And he was happy for Eileen. He really was. She didn’t need to deal with all of his baggage and the guy she was with seemed like a great dude. A hunter too. And she was happy, which was all Sam wanted in the first place.
“Whoa, whoa, hold up,” Sam interrupts, “Of course you’re family. And Dean specifically wanted you here. Why would you think we wanted you gone?”
“I did,” Dean shrugs, “I guess I didn’t think he’d react that way after a few drinks. But hey, at least we got some entertainment out of it, yeah?”
“Fine, fine,” Charlie laughs, “But if things get awkward, it’s on you to get me outta there, okay Groot?”
“Yeah, no worries kid. We’ll work it out. Maybe we can even find someone else for Sam to pine after,” Dean laughs.
Dean spins Cas and they both laugh quietly. Sam sees so much love between the two and is embarrassed at himself for tearing up until he looks over at his mom, who is full on crying. Tears stream down her face but they don’t dull her smile as she gazes upon her son.
“I’ll get it,” Sam says, not wanting to ruin the moment for Dean and Cas. He quickly strides over to the door and opens it, slightly taken aback at the sight before him. Charlie was there, smiling apologetically as both Mary and John came into view. Sam grits his teeth, but musters a smile.
“Who knew you had moves?” Gabriel says. Sam slowly comes back to reality and immediately feels the heat rise on his face. He knows he’s blushing, which makes Gabriel smile wide. The guy’s smile must be contagious, because Sam can’t help the grin that creeps onto his face.
“Okay, so you need to be more mindful of your, ahem, activities.” Dean winces, but lets Sam continue. “I’m gonna let it slide today, since you got married yesterday, but we do share this house. So just… Ugh. I don't wanna wake up to that, okay?”
“No,” Sam says firmly as he steps closer to Gabriel. He leans down and hugs the archangel tightly, not really caring if his family sees. It’s been way too damn long. He thought Gabe was dead for the longest time, only to have him come back years later and die permanently. It probably would have broken Sam if he had any time at all to process what had happened. It was always something in the back of his head, niggling away at his subconscious. All the what-ifs and how-comes.
“Not really. I am one of the most powerful beings in existence after all. I wouldn’t piss me off if I were you Sammich.” Gabriel steps closer, right up into Sam’s personal space. “What’s the matter kiddo? Cat’s got your tongue? Didn’t we already do this whole song and dance last night? Literally?”
“Yeah, I remember. You beat the shit out of him,” Dean pauses catching the hesitation on Sam’s face, and smiling. “I’m proud of you little brother. I know I didn’t have it in me. Dad’s got a loud fuckin’ mouth, huh?”
There was a huge turnout. The roadhouse was packed, but somehow fit everyone. Jack even pulled a few strings and got Benny, Crowley, and even Rowena up here (Garth and his family already had a place in heaven, per Dean’s request). Even Ketch and Mick stopped by. He also vaguely remembers Sam being reunited with a particularly tricky archangel. And although Dean always had his suspicions, he was just as surprised as everyone else when Gabriel had asked Sam to dance to Love On Top by Beyonce. Poor sucker was so depressed after finding out Eileen had found someone else, but when Gabriel had appeared… Well, he doesn’t think he’d seen Sam so happy. Sam was probably too drunk to remember it though. He chuckles at the memory, but stops reminiscing before things get too embarrassing. Karaoke started shortly after and Dean knows he took the stage, but decides that’s something that doesn’t need to be remembered.
“What’s up guys? I’m Gabriel. Nice to meet y'all.” Gabriel interrupts Sam’s awkward introduction. Sam sucks in a breath, and Cas cringes. “Hi again Mary. We didn’t really get to know each other very well, but I remember you. So, that makes you John. Which makes you… Charlie? Is it? Nice to meet the family finally. Y’know, other than Dean-o here.”
“Oh. Sorry.” Sam lets go and blinks quickly, covering the evidence of tears. He stares at Gabriel for another moment, a little afraid that maybe last night was a dream, and he wasn’t actually here. He clears his throat and nods. Gabe smiles back and pats Sam’s arm gently.
“You’re damn right Dean-o!” Gabriel shouts back, giving Dean finger guns. Sam chuckles, shaking his head, before leading Gabriel to the kitchen.
“Nothing it’s just…” Charlie laughs nervously and puts the plate down, “Maybe I should leave, I mean, you guys probably have a lot to talk about and I feel like I’m intruding on your family meal and it’s kinda weird since I’m not really your family and not to mention there’s not even room for another person at the table and--”
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas’ grumbly voice cuts through the serene morning, startling Dean a little. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. What are you laughing at?”
“Originally? Banana pancakes. Now I think it’s being kicked up a notch. He’s breaking out the bacon, and eggs don’t seem too far behind.”
, Dean begs to himself in his head. He didn’t think John would even want to come over after the beating Sam gave him last night. But he sees his mom, Charlie, Sam, and Jack all flashing his megawatt teary-eyed grins at him and his confidence soars. He’s allowed to be happy, dammit. This is heaven after all. He grabs Cas’ arm and pulls him in again, kissing him harder than before. Cas gasps but eventually relaxes into it. Charlie whistles at the little show Dean is putting on. After a few seconds, the kiss breaks and Cas beams up at him.
“Do I have a choice?” Sam asks, masking his joy with pissy sarcasm. Gabriel sees right through him though, and smirks.
Him and Dean hold hands under the table, despite Dean’s discomfort with his father there. Castiel really couldn’t fault him though, if his father was here, he wouldn’t touch Dean, much less show affection towards the human. Everybody’s conversations had died out the second the doorbell rang, and the whole family at the table was now sneaking glances at Sam and Gabriel in the kitchen. It was oddly quiet, and Dean was visibly uncomfortable with the energy in the room. Cas realized that most of their little family hadn’t really met the archangel, and introductions with Gabriel were always something to behold. For better or for worse.
“Cool. Oh!” Sam almost forgot, “Mom-- uh, Mary might be coming over as well. I haven’t called her yet, but she’ll probably want to.”
“Oh, right. I called Charlie. Say’s she’ll be over soon. She offered to call mom instead. Apparently me and dad, uh, had an altercation last night.” Sam says quietly, ready for Dean to yell at him. But it never comes. Instead his brother throws his head back in a laugh and turns around, patting Sam’s shoulder.
“Well,” Jack ponders it for a moment,, “ I could, but you and Sam are soulmates. So even if you guys have separate houses, I can’t stop you from waking up in each other’s house. Just be glad you guys don’t wake up in the same bed.”
“Hey Charlie, it’s Sam,” He begins after dialing her number. Calling Charlie first seemed to be a good idea. The last thing he wanted was for John to answer the phone. He was fairly sure he had beat him up last night, and he was not ready to face that wrath.
“Oh. In that case, let me jog your memory,” Gabriel touches the tips of his middle and index finger to Sam’s temple, causing Sam to be mentally transported back to last night.
“Of course!” Mary exclaims, “It’s always nice to meet those from Cas’ side. Well, most of the time.”
“Yeah,” Sam leaned back, looking into the kitchen. Dean was currently teaching Jack how to not burn the pancakes. “He’s making breakfast. Well, I was, but he took over. He wanted to know if you were interested in coming by?”
Sam shakes his head, not wanting to ruin the morning with his own depressing thoughts. He leans against the doorframe of the kitchen and watches as his brother moves around the kitchen with a sort of grace that Sam never had. Sure, Sam could cook. He was able to feed himself enough to stay alive. But there was a certain rhythm to the way Dean did things. Like he grew up in a kitchen. Jack was the absolute opposite. Being raised on cereal and take-out really took a toll on the kid’s cooking skills, and although Dean was trying his best to teach the kid how the kitchen worked, Sam didn’t miss the way Jack would use his god-mojo when Dean wasn’t looking.
“Who’s ready for some fucking breakfast?” Dean says, clapping his hands together. Mary and Sam laugh and Charlie whoops.
“It’s fine. What are you doing here anyway?” Sam asks, slipping out of bed, grateful he had half a mind last night to at least put some sweatpants on.
He’s really glad he doesn’t have to deal with the possibility of facing John. At least, not any time soon. Going to see their parents was the first thing that him and Dean did after they reunited in heaven, and it was good to see them again, but… Sam just wasn’t impressed. After living a life of his own and being a father to Jack, and then his own son, DJ, he realized just how shitty his father was.
“Took you long enough,” A snarky voice cuts through Sam’s despair and self-loathing, rooting him back down to reality. “Although, you kinda look like hell, so I can’t really fault you.”
Dean leans in as Cas pulls him down for a tender kiss as the last words of the song creep through the speakers. Mary wipes her tears and looks away, trying to give them a little privacy. Sam turns as he feels John take a deep breath, ready to throw hands again, but is shocked to see the realization on his father’s face. Mary pats John’s arm and whispers something to him.
That was the day Dean prayed to him. Bobby had told Dean that Cas was alive, and the angel had tried to ignore the longing coming from Dean’s soul, because he knew that what Dean really needed was his brother, and he wouldn’t be happy without him. But finally, finally, Dean had prayed to him and Cas came the second he heard his name leave the hunter’s lips. He came into Dean’s room in this very house, standing in the corner, scared about what he would say. But he didn’t say anything. Dean was never a huge advocate for words, he showed how he felt by action. So he walked right up to his angel, tugging his lapels forward, pulling him into a passionate kiss. And well, the rest is history.
“Don’t. Please. I, uh, I’m sorry.” John mumbles out. Sam raises his eyebrows and glances at the bruise still covering his dad’s jaw, spreading up to his eye. “I was drunk and, I know that’s no excuse, but I, uh, you don’t have to apologize because I know I was in the wrong. It’s just… Weird. I didn’t think Dean-- Well. You know.”
“I let it happen. He kinda deserved it, don’t you think?” Sam startles as he hears Jack’s voice in the quiet morning.
“We need something a bit more romantic, I think,” Sam hums as he watches Dean and Cas. Jack nods and goes back over to the last round of the banana pancakes. Dean was mixing up a second batter, and prepping the griddle for those. Before the previous song finishes though, the doorbell rings.
“Who’d you expect?” Gabriel drawls, stepping inside with a cocky swagger, “I smell breakfast. Mind if I intrude?”
Dean turns around, catching the fond smile of Cas’ face, and rolls his eyes. The conversation goes on, but Dean slips his hand under the table, taking Cas’ into his, rubbing his thumb up and down his knuckles. It was a small gesture, but a loving one nonetheless. Cas squeezes back and watches his husband explain the logistics of the fireworks they had lit up yesterday to Gabriel, being the pyromaniac that he is. He watches as John and Mary whisper an exchange. He glances at Sam and Charlie, wrapped up in a friendly argument about the Twilight series, and how it’s completely unrealistic. He turns to Jack, who smiles at him and leans back, just observing, and Cas does the same. He revels in the energy and love filling the room and sighs contentedly. This is his family, and he wouldn’t have it any other way.
