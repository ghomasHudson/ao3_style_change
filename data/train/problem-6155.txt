Loki tries not to let the surprise show on his face as Clint, of all people, hands him a glass. ‘Should I be concerned?’ he teases.
Peter grins and flips up onto the ceiling, holding his arms out and giving her a salute.
Tony winks at him as he holds up the key. ‘Nope. Ana did.’
He nods in response and pours himself a mug of tea. ‘You all know the others who are due to arrive, and I should like the chance to visit the Sanctum of my own free will, as opposed to being let out of an alternate pocket of reality.’
Steve shrugs. ‘Bucky was happy to go with him, and Nat’s going to be support. If those two can’t handle it then I don’t know who could.’
‘Hey dude, you ready for today?’ Ned sits down next to him, MJ on Ned’s other side.
want to know.’
They make it to the bottom of the stairs before Flash catches up to them, and he’s got some friends from the year above with him. ‘You gone deaf, Parker?’
Tony,’ he grins at her and then laughs as she mutters an insult at him in Russian on her way out. ‘Love you too, Nat!’
‘Where are the photos of you?’ Peter asks.
‘Stop with your tricks,’ Bucky growls, stalking towards him, ‘I belong to HYDRA.’
He immediately regrets his question as the grin shifts beneath the other man’s mask. ‘Don’t think I need to answer that do I, Spideykins?’
‘Please tell me this is not what I think it is,’ Bucky says.
Steve opens and closes his mouth a couple of times, and Tony can see the war going on across his face; it seems that, just like him, Steve both wants to have the discussion and doesn’t want to at the same time. ‘Are you sure you want to have this conversation now?’ he settles on asking.
‘No you’re not,’ Peter mutters, not caring the man will hear.
‘I thought Pepper was helping him, like she is with the PR stuff.’
the shooter. Can you honestly tell me that you would have
‘I did,’ he answers truthfully.
‘I seriously need to do some weight lifting,’ she grumbles to herself as she inches her way towards the park. Before she gets halfway there she sees Vision coming back towards her.
There’s some polite applause as Rhodes takes to the stage. Steve admires how calm the soldier looks. ‘Thank you. Good evening everyone. I must admit when I was asked to give this speech tonight I did initially think Tony had finally lost it,’ there’s a murmur of polite laughter. ‘I mean we all know he’s much better in front of the press than I am. And then I looked at who had been invited to attend tonight and I felt extremely privileged. The guest list includes members of the police, fire and ambulance service here in New York, as well as staff members from the emergency departments. We’ve got veterans and serving soldiers. And we’ve also got members of faith communities, volunteer organisations, and local companies who have done something to give back to the community.
And Tony’s need to climb the man like
his work. Most people who he took home cared nothing about what he was working on. In fact, some of them hated it because his workshop was
his classes permanently,” Tony grouched. “Now stop laughing, or else you’re paying.”
“Steve!” Tony greeted happily. His eyes had a slightly manic look, as if he hadn’t slept in days. “It’s good to see you!”
next time feel free to step in and save me!
Just for that, I think I’ll deep fry a turkey this year.
“But that’s just it, I know everything. Had enough time and adventures to learn lots of things, you know. I may not have the papers to prove it, but I know a lot. Curse of the Time Lords. I’m the Doctor. Hello!” The Doctor waved his hand, each finger moving individually as he did so.
Tony made a sympathetic noise, but not
His ma, Doctor Erskine, Bucky. How many more people were going to die because of his curse?
Steve stroked his ma’s hand, fighting back the tears. He deserved it, he supposed, with the fact that his wings were black, bringing bad omens.
“I was busy!” he retorted. Busy daydreaming about a certain man that he saw falling in front of him, the same man who told him about the TARDIS, but still, it was more important than eating. At that same moment, his stomach growled. Tony glared down in betrayal, and Rhodey laughed.
He glared down at the culprit, disgruntled at the fact that his former heady high was interrupted by...something much less innocent. “You’re a menace,” he growled under his breath, removing his hands from his naked thumb. Tiny Steve looked back at him innocently.
The woman glanced at him and promptly ignored his posturing. “Where’s Fury?” she asked again, stressing her words when they didn’t answer her question.
Stevens grinned. “I’m sure you will.”
“But Bucky brought out the reminder that you still had the past,” Natasha continued. Steve threw the wet rag into the used towel bin before he sat across from her. “You wanted the best for him. He was your best friend, and you would do anything to save him.”
“They’re sad that your ma is gone,” Bucky said quietly, “Ma really misses her. We all do.”
Tony rolled his eyes.
“Me too,” Tony said, breath leaving him when Steve pressed him against the cold bedroom window. He shivered slightly, and then he wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist while Steve brushed his nose down Tony’s jawline and marked him with a press of lips down his neck. Tony tilted his head sideways, submitting, shuddering when Steve nipped the skin at the junction between the collarbone and neck.
“—the Jericho is. I got that reference,” Tony said. He looked at the Alpha, and he flashed his eyes back. He snarled, “Well, guess what buddy.
“Do you have an idea?” Tony asked, putting aside his personal problems to do the task at hand. He could do this, this thinking part because that was who he was, to be first and foremost the innovative thinker.
Tony watched as Stevens turned around and left, never looking back. Oddly enough, it hurt to be so close to him, not knowing a lot about him, yet feeling like there was something missing in his life when he walked away.
Steve exhaled harshly, letting the thoughts simmer down. With one final punch, he threw his body into one last kick, and the chains holding up the bag snapped sharply. Steve panted, feeling the blood from his knuckles drip down his digits and onto the floor, one patter at a time. The punching bag landed on its side with one final thud, and Steve’s ears rang in the ensuing silence.
Upon hearing the news, Butterfingers perked up again.
“It couldn’t be,” Nebula replied lowly, walking beside him. She looked out, graven. “Thanos doesn’t believe in eliminating entire populations. And fire isn’t his style. We did eliminate half the population a long time ago, but we haven’t touched this outpost since. Someone else must have done this.”
Because Tony was the most amazing being he’d ever met. It didn’t matter that he was wingless; Tony made himself wings and became a flier, fighting everything that told him otherwise that he was grounded. And if Tony could do that, maybe Steve could fight for himself and tell himself that he wasn’t the harbinger of death.
Next time you should just date me 😉
Yinsen gave him a hardened stare. “Your mate?”
“That’s it, Butterfingers. That’s all I have for you. Go back to your station.” With a happy squeal, Butterfingers whizzed off, satisfied that his extermination was complete.
YOU try banning him once he sets his mind to something.
Tony turned to look at him. “Did you say something Cap?” His golden-brown eyes were curious and stunning, and Steve’s breath caught for a second.
“I’m not going to fight anymore,” Steve said tiredly, sitting down on the edge of his bed. “I just want to be a civilian.”
With those wide chocolate brown eyes giving him those puppy eyes, Steve couldn’t help but cave. Under no conditions could he ever resist those orbs, and Steve gave a slight nod of approval just so that he could see Tony grin happily. He turned back to Tiny Steve. “Is it alright if we take you home?”
Tiny Steve chittered back, walking closer, hooves clicking against the granite countertop. They seemed excited to see each other, blushing all the while, Steve noted, but then his thoughts were interrupted by a hand on his shoulder. Tony looked at him, smiling gently.

When Steve looked into Tony’s eyes, he saw that they were blown with lust, and he was just as hard. Tony looked down at his hard-on with an interested look. “We’ll take care of that later. Flying first.”
He couldn’t help but shed a few tears, and they trailed down his cheek. “I was so scared that you were going to die,” he whispered.
your brother?” He quickly marched into his workshop. He feared the worst, that DUM-E have been completely incinerated by the violent bolt of electricity that ran through Butterfinger’s whisk. Tony couldn’t care less about the dumb bot, what with the way that he couldn’t do anything right, getting into things where he wasn’t supposed to be, and being a general nuisance. But still, DUM-E was his child, and God forbid he’s gone. “DUM-E!”
He should have said: “Writing is hard, involves a lot of typing and makes my fingers hurt. Don’t even get me started on creating new ideas.”
“Fine,” Steve finally said.
Tony grabbed a ball of aluminum foil and tossed it in the air, letting Butterfingers blast it into dust. Then, he grabbed pieces of scrap metal from his desk before he turned to Stevens. There was a big smile on Stevens’s face, looking at Butterfingers fondly, and Tony couldn’t help but match his grin.
This time, it was him – he couldn’t wait for her to make the first move when he still had some pent-up emotion deep within himself, and he pushed forward, jabbing towards her head, before he followed it with a solid roundhouse kick, swinging his leg around and striking with his elbow. Nat blocked every punch and dodged every kick with ease, countering with her own quick jabs before she maneuvered away. It was a complicated, deadly dance between them where they didn’t have to hold back their strength.
“You’re the one in love with a centegenarian super solider who could kill you with his thighs - oh, wait, that’s what you want, fuck, I need to go wash my eyes out,” Pepper muttered as she walked away.

“Quiet!” He stopped, stilled. “Someone’s coming.”
He clutched the cookies in his hands, almost crumbling them when he momentarily got lost in his thoughts and gripped them a little too hard. Then he nearly dropped them in his haste to unclench his fingers.
This time, he saw Steve standing there in front of him. He was dressed in sweats and a white t-shirt that stretched across his pecs and chest. Steve looked good, even being away for so long and his face worn with sadness and regret. Steve cradled his sketchbook in his hands.
He just wanted peace for once.

“Scientifically impossible in human terms,” Stevens agreed. “But remember, the TARDIS isn’t Earth technology, I’m sure the Doctor told you.”
It was a good deal, because if the ship really had mechanical issues, Tony would be the man to fix it. He was a genius after all, and fixing things was his specialty. That, and inventing things, but Tony loved making broken things better. And if this ship was broken, Tony was interested in fixing it, learning about it, and making it better.
exterminate him!”
He stared at himself in the bathroom mirror. The lights illuminated his tired and old eyes, perfect jawline, his healthy pallor. They also illuminated the full set of raven-black wings behind him.
He couldn’t...he couldn’t do this.
It was so flat, sounded so insulting, yet Steve found himself unwillingly smiling at him. “Are you sure you want to be near me? They’re going to call you a freak too.”
It was like a weight was taken off his chest: he was freer now, not burdened by the heaviness of the car battery that had been stuck to him. It was such a small step towards freedom; Tony would take any small accomplishments that he could take.

“But you didn’t, and everything fell apart.” Tony looked at Steve’s stormy blue eyes, savoring them up close. “I don’t hate him. I don’t hate you either. I just wished that this –“ he waved his hand, indicating Steve’s apology, “– came earlier, and that we didn’t have to be light years apart to talk about this.”
Tony was going to die at this rate if Steve didn’t stop him. Everyone else was too far away to be of any help.
“Good work,” Steve praised, and then he automatically sought out for Tony, looking up to the skies in hopes that he would get a glimpse of him, and then he breathed a sigh of relief when he spotted him. Tony was nearby, fighting a large metal bot with spindly arms.
“What do we do now?” All of them, including the Wakandans, looked to him to take the next steps. And Steve didn’t have answer for them. He bit his lip and looked down, unable to face them. There wasn’t a man with a plan this time around. Steve was just a man out of his time, outliving most people.
by the door. Yinsen urged Tony up, and Tony hissed as his wound jostled unpleasantly, but they were on their knees when the door slammed open. Tony dropped his eyes, gazing at the floor as multiple footsteps marched in.
He fell in love with her the moment she put Private Hodge in his place. Her curls bounced, her suit was crisp and perfect as she dumped the larger man onto the ground, and it was easy to look at her with admiration for the way she could keep up with the rest of them and the best of them.
“But I’m not done yet!” the student protested. Tony rolled his eyes.
Natasha stayed silent, and Steve found himself spilling more than he intended. He never told anyone about that day in Siberia before, and now it all tumbled out. “We went to Siberia, Bucky and I, and Tony showed up. He was there to help us out, but then he found out that Bucky killed his parents. Zemo showed it to Tony, and Tony snapped when he found out. Tried to kill Bucky.” Steve shook his head. “I couldn’t let that happen.”
“Food for the starving students and busy workers,” Deborah agreed. She gently stopped Stevens from reaching for his wallet. “On the house, dear.”
A blue box was there, plain and simple, right in the heart of MIT. Tony found himself slowing down, walking towards it, mesmerized.
It built up.
to live there so badly. If he did so, he would have more opportunities to see Tony than all the official meetings that the Avengers had to attend.
Thank you all for your response! Setting up a date now!

"Please," Tony begs into his pillow, letting his back arch so that his ass is turned up even higher in a way that hopefully entices Steve to take what they both need. He earns a sharp smack for that, and he cries out, but his cock grows even harder. He hates it and he loves it when Steve drags his fingers over his asscheeks carelessly, spreads them open again, letting the air brush over his sensitive hole. He whimpers when those hands squeeze his cheeks tightly, yells when the squeezes turn to pinches against his skin, and then Steve's face brush against his wet cheek.
The man waved his suggestion off. “Nah, I like it this way. She needs no fixing. A police box is her preferred state anyway. This is just a pit stop, got knocked off-course for a bit going to the 1600s to visit Pachelbel – Canon in D as it stands is utterly atrocious.”
“Yeah,” Tony replied. He sighed heavily. “God, sharing a dreamscape, working out our problems in our minds, while we sleep, and we can’t do it face to face.”
Steve sat down in the tub, let his wings hang freely behind him, and sobbed into his hands.
And Tony can't do anything but follow his orders. They're no longer equals - Tony is fully Steve's, and with a kiss that feels cruel, Tony lets him in with a broken sob. And Steve takes and takes and takes, dragging his cock in and out with only his saliva and last night's come as lube. Tony moans, cries, and whimpers under Steve, hole fluttering as Steve pounds against his ass with wet squelches. He can barely breathe with the way that his face is smashed against his pillow, and he feels lightheaded because of it.
And then there was a blunt pressure pressing against his asshole, and he let a long wail as the pressure became unbearable and his ass opened to let Tony in.
“Are you sure Tony? I don’t want you to hurt.”
alive when you touched her exterior.”
be so…pure when all they had seen today was death and destruction. Even Tony’s suit wasn’t spared by the events, scratched up and torn apart under Thanos’s hand. However,
Tony didn’t answer at first, bringing the cup of gold to his lips, inhaling the bitter smell and taking a sip. The coffee was just on the other side of scalding, but Tony didn’t care. It was delicious. “Sleep is for the weak,” Tony brazenly said, pushing the sleepiness to the back of his mind. “I’ll be fine.”
‘Shit, Harry, I’m sorry,’ he goes up and puts a hand on his friend’s shoulder. ‘I’d thought he’d have backed off a bit over the years.’
The blond runs his hands up and down Tony’s sides and nods. ‘Alright, on one condition.’
‘I see you’ve got some new recruits to help with the baking,’ a new voice says from behind her.
‘But the name would stay on the official mission reports to keep the identities secret, even from the majority of individuals working alongside the team,’ Tony explains. ‘The only ones who would really know any of this would be official team members, and certain individuals outside of the team, such as Nick or Hill.’
‘Fury said he’d come for Christmas Day as well, then leave us and come back on New year. Hill’s spending it with family,’ she finishes.
‘Understatement of the century,’ Bucky raises an eyebrow.
‘Aunty Nat!’ she’s cut off by the sound of two excitable voices and two small bodies launch themselves on top of where she’s sitting. Tony sees her blink in complete shock.
‘I’m Karen by the way,’ she says, ‘Karen Paige. I work for Nelson and Murdock. The law firm in Hell’s Kitchen?’
‘It’s not like it’s difficult to get him talking about stuff to do with Steve, especially from pre-serum,’ Tony points out, an answering grin to the others’ now on his face. ‘How’s the rest of your homework coming on, Pete?’ He shoots Steve a frown at the grin on the blond’s face at that question; the soldier raises his hands in surrender and stands up, picking up his discarded hand towel.
‘You do know he’ll get you back for it at a later date, Buck. Stop winding him up,’ Steve sighs.
Bucky takes the opportunity to look around the battlefield and assess how the initial clash has gone. Already there’s a lot of bodies, although the alien ones greatly outnumber any others, but there’s Wakandans and Jotuns laying amongst them too. So far, though, their side is holding up strong against the onslaught.
‘Oh really?’
‘Tony I’m not sure you’re the person who’s going to be able to make all that happen, but thank you.’
‘What course is that?’ Steve asks, and Peter shoots him a grateful smile, slyly taking his hand from the table and giving Wade’s knee a comforting squeeze.
‘I knew you cared!’
(See the end of the chapter for
that’s not who you are. Seems to me you just need to remember that yourself.’ Then he gives him a grin. ‘But you’re so grounded for not knowing AC/DC.’
Deadpool grins. ‘You can have as many tacos as you want, Baby Boy,’ and thrusts the box gleefully into his hands.
Love always,
‘You alright, Pete?’ Tony calls, voice worried.
‘We’d have to deal with contractors coming in and doing up the place for a few weeks. Wouldn’t exactly be peaceful,’ the inventor says eventually.
Thank you to those of you who have already commented I hope you enjoy this chapter as well and I will get around to replying to your comments soon I promise. Do let me know what you think about where this story is heading! Do you think they can pull it all off? I'll give you a clue: not everything will be resolved by the end of this story, this is going to take some of the series to get through.
‘I don’t know,’ he grunts between dodging two attacks.
I hope you enjoyed this final chapter, please do let me know what you think of this series' opener, I'd be interested to see where you think the series is going to go as well. Please do let me know if anyone has any requests for the Christmas story as well. I'm literally only three chapters in so far and have a VERY loose plan for it.
‘EDITH kept a link to Beck’s systems,’ she continues, ignoring both of them, ‘and even though they’ve destroyed all the physical evidence of the systems, there’s a couple of things they couldn’t get rid of. We thought the encryption on the emails was too hard to follow right? So I decided to follow it manually-’
Bucky gives a small chuckle. ‘Come on you dork I’ll give you a hand.’
‘Oh they never do,’ Sam laughs. ‘Hang on, everyone’ll kill me if I don’t tell you’re on the phone.’ His head disappears and then they hear him yelling down the corridor. ‘Hey! Guys! Mama Rhodes is on the phone!’
Peter thinks.
He swears he hears Wade mumble before he runs after him: ‘You’re going to be the death of me, Baby Boy.’
‘From my view it’s a boy,’ Pepper laughs.
After all he wouldn’t be a very good trickster if he couldn’t read people.
‘Cooper! Peter is not a climbing frame,’ Laura sighs.
Really he should have worked out there was more to their friendship, at least on Steve’s side, back then. But hindsight and all that.
Pete. Then you asked if they hurt me.’
Bucky sighs and, after a moment’s hesitation, gets himself set up in the machine. He casts one last look in Tony’s direction then, taking a deep breath, starts the memory.
‘Any news on when Clint, Scott and Wade are arriving?’ Fury asks through the comms.
‘Have you tried Fury again?’ Rhodes asks, before he can respond to Clint.
Steve had insisted they all dress ‘smart’, which is the reason Tony is in the situation he is in. He needs to have some strong words with his boyfriend.
‘You-what- but-
‘We had this discussion at the time. I’m physically stronger so it was better for me to throw.’
‘Wanda, darling, are we really going to keep on with this or are you going to come back to good ol’ Agatha?’
‘Oh wow he got the full name treatment,’ Clint pipes up. ‘Now you know he’s in trouble.’ He hands Peter a beer. ‘Bottoms up kid!’
‘Fine,’ he rolls his eyes, ‘are you ready to go Tony?’
‘Captain,’ the king returns the Wakandan salute, then embraces each of them in turn, ‘Tony, it’s good to see you both again. We were starting to wonder where you had run off to.’
‘Clint go!’
Bucky laughs, supporting Wade so he doesn’t have to put much weight on his rapidly healing broken leg. ‘Not a word. Nat’s here with the jet. You’ve been under there all night.’
Rhodes leads the way down to where Happy is waiting to take them all back to the facility, Steve decides to bring up the rear and hurry along any stragglers. And by ‘hurry along’ he promises Pepper to bodily carry them out of the building if necessary. He and Tony are the last ones down, staying behind just long enough to get reassurances from Pepper that they are fine to leave and she’ll be leaving ten minutes after them once she’s made sure everything is taken care of. When they enter the car most of the team is already half-asleep.
‘Quiet, Sergeant,’ Rumlow snaps and glares at Bucky, ‘we’ll discuss this later.’
‘Get the damn door closed,’ he hisses, ‘and they can’t ask any more questions. Plus we cannot start this week with you guys mowing down reporters. Now get that damn door
‘When they are older you can explain to them what happened, and why there are some things that are harder to forgive than others. I can say one thing, Barton: you managed to keep your family a secret from me even when I had control of your mind. That in itself shows the lengths you will go to ensure their safety and happiness. I do not doubt you will always be able to find a way to resolve any issues they face.’
‘Oh,’ Peter breathes as the scarred face comes into view; but that’s not what’s caught his attention. ‘Wade your eyes are gorgeous.’ Then his brain catches up to what he’s said and he blushes bright red. ‘I mean-uh- you know- uh-’
Just then another machine breaks through from the barrier entrance, obviously one that had been left behind, and it barrels towards the Jotun army and their defenders. Bucky opens his mouth to form a warning when the machine suddenly turns, instead of trampling its enemies it instead turns on its own people, spreading confusion through their ranks and distracting them from attacking the Jotuns.
‘No. Get those shoes out of my lab!’ Steve chuckles at the female voice that drifts up to them as he, T’Challa and Fury enter Shuri’s lab.
‘Are you going to tell me what’s eating you or are you just going to fidget all night and prevent
Tony smiles and nods. ‘Yeah sounds like a good idea. We could grab a coffee on the-’
Peter glances up at Matt, who just frowns at him. Taking a gamble he reaches up to touch his ear piece, turning on the speech ability. ‘I’m here Mr Stark, sorry I was helping one of the lawyers to the bathroom,’ Matt pauses in his rush towards him. ‘Which one’s the blind one again?’
‘Yeah, it’s called getting one of our guys to pass you surveillance footage,’ he looks back at his screen and pulls up what he’s found. ‘Disguising it as regular checks on the security system, but there’s still evidence there that certain excerpts have been copied. I’m guessing this was then passed on to you through a contact; so I want to know: who was your contact?’
‘That is what I intend to find out,’ Tony’s expression is hard, ‘though I have my suspicions it’s around trying to get my focus back on weapons development, and if I still argue, to get me locked out and someone else take over the running of the company.’
‘And it doesn’t matter how much smoke I inhale, I’ll still be fine. You however will not be.’
He’s still worried about how easy it is for him to lead the genius around, but decides to face one problem at a time and, as the tub fills with water, he gently helps him undress, though he pauses before helping him take off his underwear.
Thank you so so much to everyone who has been reading this story, those of you who have left kudos and especially those who have taken the time to leave comments. I hope you're all basically ready for Christmas and ready to relax for the holidays.
‘It’s better for me to wander,’ he says instead of asking the question flitting through his mind. They slip into silence, and Loki isn’t sure if it’s uncomfortable or not. ‘There was one year,’ he says eventually, ‘when we were still young and had only just started going on hunts unsupervised with Sif and the Warriors Three when Thor angered a herd of Rabusk and they stampeded. We scattered and Thor and I ended up separated from the others and, on the way back, we stumbled across the den of a Fenrisian wolf. Luckily we caught her by surprise and Thor was able to kill her, that was when we realised she had pups; Fenrisian wolves are usually dangerous and Odin ordered them killed if you came across any that didn’t flee, but these were still young and I remembered stories of people having tamed them in the past. I convinced Thor to help me carry them back to Asgard and we tried to convince father to let us train them, but he ordered them killed before we could finish our arguments. I hastily cast a spell to conceal one of them and managed to sneak it into my room without him noticing. I’m sure Mother knew but she just gave me a half smile and didn’t say anything.
Peter lets out a proper laugh for the first time that morning. ‘He is right though.’
‘We’ve got a long way to go, but Vision’s right,’ Rhodes says, raising his glass as well.
‘Let’s see what my favourite person has to say about the situation. Secretary Ross,’ Tony greets the man who has just appeared on the large screen in front of them. Wanda hears an edge to his voice and is beginning to get some idea of the full extent of Tony’s dislike for the man. ‘Any particular reason you want us to help out the NYPD? Do you owe the Commissioner money?’
‘What are you talking about?’ Loki snaps. ‘What could I possibly have that you believe is yours?’
Yo guys! So as we’re starting another series, that basically follows on from last one but you know who an be assed to read all that shit am I right? Anyway author lady decided to let me have one more go at recapping the story for you all.
He’d asked Doctor Strange if Wade would come back. ‘That’s up to him, Peter,’ had been his reply. As cryptic an answer as Peter had ever received, but it had given him a little more hope.
‘I’m not alone’, Peter tells him, ignoring Steve, ‘and we will defeat you.’
‘The only one you may have to protect me from is Pepper,’ he gives his friend a smirk. ‘Think you can get me into Tony’s workshop?’
‘Bets please gentlemen,’ Wade grins, taking out a pen and piece of paper and writing down their bets.
Loki knows he shouldn’t be, but part of him is enjoying this fight. It’s been a long time since he had a fight with someone where they
She just hopes Strange can remember what she needs and keep it at the front of his mind long enough. After this she is never complaining about a study session ever again.
Tony shakes himself out of his thoughts as Bucky’s shout of ‘Shotgun I’m on Pete’s team!’ cuts through them.
Peter tries to push down the nervous feeling in his gut, gripping Wade’s hand tightly, as they climb out of the car and head inside. They’re greeted as soon as they walk through the door and shown up three flights of stairs to where the team has, apparently, taken residence on the entire floor. The Wakandan salutes and smiles before leaving them outside of the door.
‘A sound suggestion. Let us hope it is as easy as it sounds.’
There’s silence for a while. ‘You’ve done well, Pete,’ Natasha says eventually. ‘I’ll admit I’m impressed. Keep me updated if you hear anything else, but you
The bell sounds and Peter nearly jumps out of his seat.
It’s late evening by the time Tony brings the jet to a soft landing on the grass lawn outside the dark and silent house.
Peter celebrates his birthday with the Avengers, but the time also comes to admit a secret he's kept from May
‘Can it, Rogers,’ after a pause Tony adds. ‘Care to explain why he arrived wearing Bucky’s hoodie this afternoon?’
‘Aww don’t tell me you’ve forgotten me already,’ she teases him. ‘What’s up Big Guy you wanted to join in the game?’
‘They aren’t from Midgard,’ Loki cuts across him.
‘When do you ever not?’ Steve laughs. ‘What in particular are you planning to do this time?’
A/N: Hi everyone! It's finally finished. I'm so sorry it's taken so long, I hope it was worth the wait. Thank you so much for all the reviews you've been leaving on this story, I'm glad you'd enjoyed it so far I hope the end lived up to expectations. And by popular demand Bucky/Loki came back.
Tony grins at him. ‘
‘But you’re able to keep your mind reading abilities which is interesting,’ Strange muses. ‘Keep it secret, and see if you can read any information on where you are from the guards when they do visit.’
Tony sits up so fast he’s surprised he doesn’t give himself whiplash. ‘How did you find those? Wait, no, I mean-’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It’s the celebration of the end of the decline into winter and the start of the beginning of the year heading back towards summer and the plenty of the harvest,’ Valkyrie is the one to explain, ‘and it is also the time to remember and honour the dead that we have lost during the last year. Everyone stops working for the duration of the celebration and families are reunited and spend the time together preparing for the feast at the end.’
Steve just wants to ask Tony what they should do.
‘Sounds good, if we have to chop any more of these giant ones down my arms are going to fall off.’
Tony shakes his head. ‘Peter is old enough to make his own decisions, Bucky. Besides like you said: he’s taken out supervillains. If that doesn’t mean he can’t choose who to date I’m not sure what does. And anyway Wade knows he has my blessing.’
‘Amongst other things, Captain,’ comes the reply. ‘It’s all part of the family calendar protocol.’
‘Nice of him to join the party.’
‘I’m ready when you are Cap,’ Clint says. ‘Just tell me when to blow it.’
‘Think we should get a guard dog just to be safe?’ Steve grins at him.
‘But no burger is complete without fucking chillis!’ the red suited man cries.
‘Don’t we all,’ Bruce sighs, rubbing his temples. He’s not sure whether this is going to be worse or better than last team Christmas, but it’s certainly going to be just as interesting.
‘Oh yes,’ the second woman sounds far too excited, ‘it was a proper “shots fired” at Tony Stark that one.’
‘Please,’ Peter’s shocked at the plea falling from the man’s mouth. Tony pauses, looking down at him and then, squaring his shoulders and setting his expression, looks back up at the soldier holding him. ‘Leave him here. I’ll come with you. No fight. Just leave the kid.’
Wanda enters the room next, rubbing her temples. ‘You guys need to stop having such loud arguments. I swear you’re responsible for the majority of my migraines.’
‘I love you, Spidey!’ he hears the merc shout as he drops from the side of the building, firing a web and heading back towards home.
‘Errm…honey? I don’t think he’s going to need your help,’ his wife interrupts, eyes wide as she’s obviously just realised who he is. ‘You’re-’
‘You’ve met him?’ Steve asks.
Peter just wants to be sick.
‘Can we please get back to the topic of impending doom?’ Tony asks, then sighs. ‘There’s something else I need to tell you about…’
‘Which means you’ve thought about it,’ Bruce sighs in a way that is as long-suffering as any sigh Pepper ever gave him.
Suddenly Peter feels tired. The week of being distracted, of forgetting homework assignments and playing catch up, of nights with little or no sleep that are filled with nightmares when he actually does, worrying what Mr Stark is going to say at the weekend, it all catches up to him. Somehow, before the
‘Anybody in mind?’ she asks him.
‘Start strutting big guy,’ Tony adds, hating himself for doing this to his friend and yet knowing he needs to.
‘You make the whole facility run on clean energy,’ Wanda points out.
Natasha shakes her head. ‘He was always going to be out of contact for most of it, we told him not to worry about checking in until he was on the way back but he has an emergency alarm in case he needs it.’ Peter remains suspiciously quiet and ducks back in the attic to retrieve another box; when he reappears she has her arms crossed and an eyebrow raised. ‘Care to update me on your boyfriend’s status?’
Peter forces himself to stay calm and, remembering the man’s comments about hearing if he was lying, chooses his words carefully. ‘They do. They know he’s in New York, and they know I see him.’
'I tried to cheer Wanda up and ended up getting a book thrown at me,' Bucky grumbles.
I hope you all enjoy this chapter and the one I'll be posting in a day or two. And to everyone who is watching End Game: stay strong! We'll get through this together! (Though I've been psyching myself up for two weeks to watch it and I'm in no way prepared!)
When you say ‘adversity’,’ Bruce rubs his forehead, ‘what exactly do you mean?’
‘I doubt it. He never revealed His existence to Justin Hammer; the person that man thinks is pulling the strings is Ross.’
Tony sniggers. ‘He’s got you there, Cap,’ he says as he blasts a couple more enemies with his repulsors. Landing near Steve he powers up the reactor in his chest, sending a blast towards the soldier that the blond reflects with the shield, clearing the enemies around him.
‘You and your Captain there who I’ve already beaten?’ Thanos chuckles.
‘No a cardboard cut-out.’
‘Sam, come get Nat, I’m heading down to ground. Clint? When I give the signal blow that door to pieces.’
‘Yeah, yeah, whatever, Rogers. Come on Rhodey don’t be a boring bastard like this one.’
Peter sighs and climbs to his feet, going to say goodbye to everyone in the team, and receive even more advice from everyone before he leaves.
‘Come on Point Break,’ Tony pats Thor’s shoulder, ‘let’s get you upstairs and you can tell us what’s going on when the others join us. We’ve got a few things to catch you up on as well.’
‘This is going to be a long couple of days,’ Peter sighs.
he asks.
Nebula opens her mouth to speak again, but closes it with a frown and Valkyrie hears the commotion that has drawn her attention. ‘I think we may be about to find out why,’ she sighs and the two women start to run towards the noise.
‘Is all of this really necessary?’ Nebula asks, looking confused at the amount of boxes that are being passed down. ‘I thought this celebration only lasted a month?’
Bucky glances at him before moving towards Peter and taking him by the shoulder, leading him back towards the couches. ‘So kid you’re going to have to teach that move you pulled on Steve back in Berlin. I haven’t seen him taken out like that since we were teenagers and he was the weedy kid getting beaten up in back alleys. Problem is he’s now the guy who’s three times the size of everyone now and he’s getting too big for his boots.’
‘The celebrations are about seeing out the old year and welcoming in the new one, we start by remembering what is gone so then we can focus on what is to come,’ Loki responds.
‘Wait you mean you haven’t been going out that long?’ she asks.
‘Boss?’
‘What happened to Thor?’ Clint asks.
As always here's your sneak peek:
'Tony there's something you need to see,' she says, joining the others at the breakfast bar.
‘Certainly, boss. Sending out now.’
He trickster rolls the now empty mug between his hands and looks down at it, Bucky lets him have the time he needs. ‘I haven’t spoken of this to Thor,’ he eventually says, ‘but I…I had been wondering about what to do to help bring stability to Jotunheim. There have been wonderful strides made already but…’
Harley throws himself on his unmade bed, screaming into his pillow, before turning around panicked. "Oh my God, Dad, what if she thinks I'm a time traveller, and that we can't be together because I can't exist in a dimension that isn't my own? What if we're just a tragic love story made up by some person going through a midlife crisis? What if I don't actually exist right now? What if
His chest burns from the phantom pains licking up his ribs and pooling right where the arc used to be, but at leastthere are no scratches tonight. He hadn't had arc-related nightmares in years, who knew a shield to the chest would make dying in space seem preferable?
"Why I thank you, my good sir," Tony starts, snuggling into the warm fabric. "This is a bit clichéd isn't it? Not that the letterman or you totally being a boy scout is too much or anything."
Steve deftly passes two pint glasses to them, rolling his eyes at his housemates. This was definitely a bad idea, none of them wanted to just be nice for once.
"Exactly, older brother."
"No 'but dads'," Steve interjects, wiping the mess of puree off of Morgan's cheeks and ignoring the twins' snickering. "That won't endear you to Riri, or your brother."
"I'd love that honey, but we're not working with a lot here." Steve grins up at him, carefully pulling his fingers out of Tony and squirting the last bit of lube out of the packet, pushing as much into Tony's hole as he can.
While Tony hadn't closed himself off to anyone or denied himself any friends (the easiest way to hide was in plain sight after all), he understood that what Bucky and Sam and Steve had, and what Sue and Reed and Ben and Johnny had, wasn't something he'd ever have again. Rhodey was on the west coast last he'd seen him, waving Tony off and risking his life and reputation to get him to safety, while his mama had long ago boarded a ship back to her homeland, leaving him in Obi's

‘Do you think Ultron could have come to life without mine and Tony’s intervention?’ he asks, trying to sound like the answer to the question didn’t matter as much as it did.
Pepper chuckles again. ‘Nat looks ready to murder her partner,’ she says.
‘Stop making up excuses and move your ass!’ Bucky all but drags him from his chair and towards the elevator. ‘Come on, it’s just a quick lap of the facility.’
There’s just one problem.
‘I’m sure there is a good explanation as to how you convinced Jotunheim to join us,’ Thor laughs as he swings his new weapon and cleaves enemies in two, ‘but I suspect it shall have to wait until after we have achieved glorious victory, brother.’
‘Yeah how about no?’ Bruce says. ‘I just want to be left alone to do what I do best and not upset Hulk any more than I already have.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Firstly a huge thank you to everyone who has commented, left kudos and read this story. Honestly I can't thank you enough, your support makes writing this so much more enjoyable. It seems to be that a lot of people want a Christmas Special, so that will definitely be coming to you as a Christmas present from me to all of you wonderful people!
‘Right, sorry,’ his friend says, ‘but you
to convince me you’re in any way happy about this.’
‘It was like a family home,’ Peter nods, ‘rather than somewhere to bunk down while we trained.’
The team have a game of soccer, which starts off with no powers and ends up differently. Then there's a team dinner, and Peter gets asked some awkward questions about his fan.
‘It’s not just that though is it?’ Steve asks him.
‘The reports from the infirmary say similarly of ours,’ Okoye says, looking towards her king, ‘though there are many who are still in danger.’
‘Buzz off bird brain,’ he smacks the arm away. ‘Besides I say Wakanda tech is advanced all the time!’
Loki laughs. ‘I think I shall make you tell me the full story one day, it sounds more entertaining than anything Thor can tell.’
‘Let Loki and I focus on Wanda,’ Strange tells the team. ‘We should be able to neutralise her powers enough to be able to capture her.’
It’s a brown haired teenager now, flanked by Steve’s best friend and the man he’d walk through hell to keep safe. ‘Ready when you are.’
‘How did it go?’ Vision is in the doorway, Rhodes next to him. Tony just shrugs.
‘This is why we’re friends,’ Ned laughs, then turns his attention back to the teacher before they get told off again.
‘I’m in goal,’ Tony says, heading towards their end.
‘So I didn’t want to bring this up with those two around,’ he says, looking Tony dead in the eye. ‘And I’ll understand if you don’t want to answer the question. Your nightmares Tony: is there by any chance something associated with Siberia in there as well?’
And one chance is all they need.
‘Greetings friends,’ Drax says as the group reaches the ground, ‘Quill has told us about the celebration called Christmas and we would very much like to take part and experience it for ourselves.’
‘Mr Stark have you anything to say about the fact your old rival held you prisoner?’
‘Shit,’ Tony groans next to him, ‘he’s got the Time Stone.’
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve notices Tony leaving the party through one of the sets of French doors that lead out onto terraces. Then he sees Bucky’s shit-eating grin. ‘What?’ he asks.
‘Mask down, baby boy,’ comes a voice behind him.
‘They can write the invite then,’ he huffs, ‘I haven’t done this much writing in
well protected farm house right
Tony closes his eyes and nods, then looks Bucky directly in the eye. ‘Let me put it another way: is it the gun or the shooter that kills a person? A gun doesn’t choose to kill anything, the person holding it does. The gun is the instrument.
‘No Rocket, we can’t,’ Scott sighs.
‘That obvious huh?’ Steve just raises an eyebrow in answer to the man’s question. Wade sighs. ‘I guess, seeing as this affects the team I thought I’d check with you first. You know the mission I was on before Thanos got here?’ Steve nods. ‘And I was checking out a last location before I had to come off early? I want to go back and check it out, Cap. I’ve left a job unfinished and that doesn’t sit right with me.’
Steve nodded, but he took one glance back to see that the two creatures were already hugging each other like long lost friends.
Tony was not looking forward to heaving DUM-E back upright; he was so very heavy, and DUM-E was larger than Tony too. But the task needed to be done, and as soon as Tony worked up the motivation to lift him up, he would do so too. However, before he could do so, DUM-E was back on his feet.
“Fuck that’s hot,” Tony growled in his ear, and Steve whined, blindly pressing his cheek against Tony. “You’re so fucking hot. Gonna see how many times you can come for me tonight because you were so amazing. Open your eyes for me, wanna see how blissed out you are.”
“I love you,” Tony said quickly. “Not because you were in me, or because I was drunk, I just want that clear. I do. I love you.”
Steve gathered Tony up in his arms and carried him towards the spacious bathroom attached to Tony’s bedroom. “Well, I
”People tell me I look like James Franco.” God, what a prick. No offense to Franco, he’s okay. But this guy though...
“I wish…” Steve hesitated, “I wish there could have been more that we could have done, to stop this all from happening.”
“It’s... “ Steve sighed. “It’s nothing to do with the mission. Or the job. It’s personal, I don’t want to bother you with it.”
Steve reminded himself.
And again.
Carol found them again after that, with a slight look of disappointment that Tony was too drunk to interpret. So with a wink and a smile, he separated himself from the happy couple.
“Tony.”

let terrorists take his work for their benefit. His eyes flashed gold, earning a red in return, but he wouldn’t bow down to their demands.
“Oh my God!” Steve exclaimed as they soared over buildings and under the Brooklyn Bridge and skimmed over water. He was breathless and happy; the feeling of flying with his wings behind him carrying him to do all of this. Steve laughed.

It looked vaguely like the classic red telephone booths stationed across the United Kingdom he had seen before, although it seemed a bit larger and taller than those booths. But Tony was 87% sure that America did not use police call boxes, whatever purpose they served. Second, Tony was completely confident that MIT did not own a police call box, even for a practical joke. He would have heard of it if his fellow peers were going to stage a hack.
Archie held it out of reach. “Oh, it must be yours,” he sneered knowingly. “No one else here has black wings, and I’ve never seen yours, so this must be yours.”
He was not buying it.
Tony yes!
And Tiny Steve couldn’t stop staring at Tony either.
Stevens’s blush deepened, and he ducked his head shyly, cutting off all eye contact with Tony. Tony gave Rhodey a dirty look, and he looked back up, unfazed by it. “Get out of here, show him your workshop, let me eat my lunch in peace. I’ll see you later, Tones.”
Tony set his coffee mug down upon his desk with a little more force than necessary, some of the precious liquid splashing over its rim, and he stomped over to his bots. With a quick movement, he detached DUM-E’s claw from the whisk. “Do
“The Avengers.”
Steve pulled his collar down so that the top of the numbers peeked through. “Found it a few days ago after I showered. Must’ve gotten it while we were out burying Ma.”
Anyway, everything is under control, including my ass. But,
“What,” Steve began to ask hoarsely, but words failed him as he continued to stare at Tony’s back.
“Let’s say I believe you, which I still don’t,” he said slowly, looking up at the wheezing light of the box, “if she understands me, why hasn’t she allowed me to enter?”
“I know you’re in there,” Cap said.
She pursed her lips. “There’s a high likelihood that he is. There’s no way he would leave the car out here hanging when the risk of it going into the wrong hands are too high. No, he would have blown up the car first before fleeing. I think he was gone in the snap.”
Hottie works for a non-profit. Asshole is condescendingly explaining to him why most non-profit models don’t work...
STEVE replied, “Of course, Tony. Unfortunately, however, I do not have enough memory to retain that information into my permanent memory because you need that space for other, more important work.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said, fondly watching them leave. “That’s no guarantee that you’ll exterminate anything tonight though.” He picked up his mug and followed after them at a more sedate pace.
“They’re alive,” Steve said. “They’re doing their part to do control damage as best they can, but it’s just death everywhere. We should have stopped Thanos from doing it. We could have stopped all this from happening.” Steve pushed back against the wall and stepped back one step, two.

Tony was too cold to argue the man in the trench coat, so he just waved the Doctor goodbye and left him to his devices.
“I’m working on it.” Tony’s eyes drip with fat, silent tears rolling down his face.
Someone moved, footsteps completely silent – just a whisper of air signaled the movement from behind him. “Just like you,” Natasha replied. Steve turned around when she was merely a few feet away. She was dressed in a tight-fitting grey t-shirt and black leggings. Her hair was pulled back in a braid that began at the top of her scalp to just at the base of her neck.  She was gorgeous, and she looked…tired. Her eyes flickered down momentarily before she looked up again. “Willing to go a few rounds on the mat?”
They were only dreams – that were supposed to be all they were. But they also felt so real.
“I love you, Steve Rogers. I swear to whoever is above Thor, I love you.”
Slowly and surely, the hardware component of the AI formed under his hands, wires connecting from one place to another. When the motherboard was finally placed into the box, Tony sighed and looked up. His eyes were dry from staring down for so long, but his heart was calmer and more settled than before.
Drinks five and six brought a few turns on the dance floor, drink seven brought a conversation with Peter about the girl on the kid’s decathlon team that Tony was not sober enough for. Drink eight… drink eight was when he worked up enough courage to put himself in proximity to Steve Rogers and his date.
fuck me.”
hurt him every single time.
“I can’t regret sending you that drunken voicemail,” Tony said, leaning his forehead against Steve’s shoulder.
It did matter, though, when the feather was black.
Tony Stark,” the Doctor repeated himself, his eyes lightening with excitement. “Of course I’ve heard of you! You didn’t say so before.” He sounded accusatory.
He missed Tony.
“Do you think this might be his?” Steve asked.
“Why the long face, El Captain?” Tony asked as they settled back on the Quinjet. It had been a long, frustrating slog through the jungle over the past few days and the mission had taken its toll on everyone. Bucky and Nat were already asleep in their respective favorite chairs and Clint was close behind them. Steve had volunteered to fly home, but there was something happening on his face that worried Tony.
Steve never hated his wings more.

“It is nothing, my friend!” Thor said, clapping him so hard on the back that he toppled over onto the floor.
“Oh,” Steve admired. “Can...can I touch them?”
They took off for the Tower, flying as a team.
It took so much will to pull away, and Steve wanted to cry when he said, “I can’t do this. I’m sorry Tony.”
. Steve opened the door none too gently, taking in the men with the white lab coats staring back at him.
“Because you are Tony Stark, billionaire, genius, gorgeous, and a hero.” Steve brushed his hand down Tony’s face, wiping away an errant tear. “I love you.”
“Since I was ten. Had to take of my brace when I underwent Operation: Rebirth.”
Archie stood up, his face bloodied and his lips curled into a sneer. “Freak,” he spat out, holding his broken nose tenderly in his fingers, before he stomped away.
“You and he fit, too,” Pepper replied, barely moving her mouth as the pair surveyed the dance floor at the Maria Stark Gala - to which Steve had just shown up with Captain Marvel herself.
It still didn’t change the fact that the seconds hand on the clock ticked extraordinarily slowly as he sat there in front of the classroom with his feet propped up on the desk, twirling his pen between his fingers. He couldn’t concentrate on his work whatsoever, now that he knew that the box was just sitting outside and waiting for him to ease his insatiable scientific curiosity. His students’ heads were bowed over their desks, pens scratching rapidly away on their tests, and he sighed quietly, bored and impatiently waiting for the students to finish their exams.
“I was more of an idiot than you, trying to make you jealous so that you would fuck me silly.”
Tony was cut off as Steve flipped the engineer onto his back and hovered over him. “Robot. Yes. We’ll get to those,” he answered in order. “We have some catching up to do.”

Tony huffed in resignation. “I can never win with you. But since you were so kind to mention it, please pull it up.”
He called back, “I’m coming!”
There was a screech of metal, piercing his sensitive ears. He winced, but the metal protecting his face was gone.

covered his sex tape three years ago?
Steve finally swallowed the bite. “I got my soulmate mark,” he confessed, and a heart-warming grin graced his face.
However, as Tony looked around, somehow they were, just walking right past the blue police box as if it wasn’t even there. It was mind-boggling to see the glaringly out-of-place thing be so unnoticed in the midst of the smartest kids in the world.
“And you’re here moping instead of doing what he asked you to do,” Rhodey pointed out.

“Good evening, team!” Tony greeted the rest of the room.
“All ears, doll,” Bucky replied as he helped himself to a coffee from her Keurig.
He regretted it. In Archie’s hand was a single, raven-black feather. “Is this yours?” he mocked.
But it’s outside! Don’t you know there are *insects* and *dirt* out there?
He was exposed.
Because if what he said was true, that the Doctor was a time traveler (not that he believed the nutter – he was a man of science, after all, and that police box was not a spaceship, no matter how many times the man insisted) – then he should be gone by morning. Either way, it wasn’t his business.
They were ugly, not like the colorful wings that his team had. Plucking his wings this time around were a futile effort; every feather he plucked were replaced by a new one, and while they were stronger than his wings before the serum, it was also more painful to pluck them.
“You’re a soldier through and through,” Fury replied plainly. “You’d be bored with civilian life.”
He hoped one day that he got the chance. But that was here nor there, so Tony said instead, “You’re going to love it, I swear. Never a day where it isn’t interesting.”
Remember that time when you tried to deep fry a frozen turkey in the dorms?
“I had a look of your latest exam, and you guys did an absolute shit job. Most of you guys understood the beam theory just fine, but your conceptual understanding of the limitations of how to go about a non-standard structure of one that you hadn’t seen before was completely in the gutter. Good thing this exam is only worth twenty percent of your grade and you have two more exams to make up for it,” Tony said to the sleepy nine am faces. “Or not, depending whether you decide to continue to
He stretched out his wings like before, and he poured bleach down the muscle, letting the feathers soak up the liquid. He used up all three bottles of bleach - he wanted to do a thorough job this time.
“My workshop is a damned mess, but it’s an organized mess, with lots of fun things, and explosions, and don’t forget the dumb robots. Stevens, you like explosions right? Stevens?” Tony looked up when Stevens didn’t reply, and he looked over his shoulder.
Steve looked at the open sky in trepidation. “I’m scared,” he admitted, look over the edge of the balcony.
Tony didn’t know what compelled him to take Stevens back out onto the porch after lunch. The temperature was dropping rapidly, but seeing the excitement on Stevens’ face earlier when he saw Butterfingers exterminating everything was so contagious that he wanted to happen again and again, forever. He couldn’t help it: he loved that soft, easy grin that graced his face, turning his sadness into something different, something that Tony liked.
He turned to Yinsen. “Upload the program,” he said.
Tony nodded. He put his helmet back on.
There he was – Stevens, that is – his head tilted over a notebook with his hands creating broad strokes with his pencil. His hair flopped over so that it covered his eyes, and he bit his bottom lip slightly as his arms moved. There was a cup of coffee on the table, but it remained there, untouched, as his attention was focused on the thing he was working on.
Tony fall into pure bliss while Steve grooms him, dozing and cuddling the larger dog as Steve cleans his fur.
Tony clung desperately to Steve, tangling his fingers in those perfect golden locks. He was messing Steve’s hair up, whining breathlessly, thrusting desperately. He found that he didn’t care at all when Steve sucked a bruise at the base of his neck. “It can’t be as long as I’ve wanted you.”
“What?” Tony yells out. He isn’t sure if his outburst is for Steve’s comment or for Nat’s, but he’s feeling a bit flabbergasted, infuriated, and surprised. He looks between Steve and Natasha, moving his head side to side until it feels as if his head is about to fall off. Finally, he says, “Nat! Leave my stash alone!” before he turns to Steve again. “What did you just say?”

But most of all, “I wanna go home.”
“Yes,” Steve said, slowly relaxing his arm when it was clear that the clone of him wasn’t going to do anything. “He has…horse legs though. Human body.”
He liked this. Still though, there was something that was pressing on his mind, like the fact that Stevens felt just slightly out of place with a vernacular that was either too old, or too young, and the fact that he looked like he lived a million years already.

Tony strapped his wings to his back again. “Do you trust me?”
“It was inevitable,” Tony replied. “We were stronger together, but Thanos took advantage of our weakness.”
Steve stilled. “Don’t hide your wings from me. Don’t ever do that.” Tony stroked Steve’s wings, and Steve shuddered, eyes rolling back in his head. He was hard, impossibly hard, so soon after already coming once. Tony just had that effect on him. “That’s why I don’t want you to hide your wings, because you’re so sensitive, and you’re so beautiful. When you’re alone with me, you don’t ever have to hide who you truly are.”
There was a hand on his arm, and Steve looked up to see Thor looking back at him with knowing eyes. Right, Thor was a leader too, a leader of his people who he had just lost. And now Steve was the leader of Earth whether he liked it or not.
Dude.

He traipsed up the stairs, pausing more than once to catch his breath, before he let himself into the apartment, breathing heavily through his mouth and biting off small whines of pain. His back twitched, and then it burned, a fiery heat that coarsed down the entire length of his wing muscles and into his feathers.
But as Steve watched Tony from afar, playing the media like the true natural he was, he realized that they were leagues apart.
and then Steve is marking him again with nips upon his back, sucking and bruising him.
“This box isn’t supposed to be here,” Tony defended himself, dropping all pretense. But seriously, Tony warned the Doctor, and yet the box was still here. “It’s out of place, it’s glaringly obvious, and I can’t believe that no one has seen it yet!”
Stevens gave a weak laugh, smiling at him but not giving him an answer. Then, he turned to Butterfingers and said, “Hello Butterfingers. It’s very nice to meet you.”
“That’s not my area of expertise,” Bruce said. “I started on something, but I don’t have enough information to create the tech to find the Stones, or – “

come home, safe and sound. Failing this, failing now, that wasn’t an option.
“No, you can’t,” the man confirmed. “Not with all the wolfsbane in your body.” He looked regretful, and he brought over a cup of water. He helped Tony up slightly, and Tony struggled not to let out a sound of pain, but a slight strangled noise made it past his lips anyway when a flare of pain in his chest radiated up and down his body. The man gave him a pitying look. “Here, drink. Slowly now. You’re still very weak.”
“Just one?” Steve asked, snagging his cookie.
Steve and Tony waited with bated breath as Tiny Steve slowly uncurled himself and approached them again cautiously. His head was tilted, and he stared at them less with fear now and more with curiosity.
“It doesn’t feel natural,” Steve said.
Tony glared at Butterfingers. “Did you
As he left his apartment for the last time, his most precious possessions in his backpack, Clint and Natasha was standing there and waiting impatiently for him.
Steve shook his head. “It feels so good. Not enough. I need your cock in me, please.”
At five p.m. on a January evening, night had already fallen, and a Nor’easter was blowing in. Tony could swear that the Maclaurin Buildings had been in use since his university was founded – its lighting was unreliable, its heating even less, and the current weather outside was not helping his foul mood at all.

Tony scowled in response. “I’m a busy man, as you well know if you’ve heard of me. Company to run, theses to write, projects to finish. I’m here because your ship is more interesting than you, no offense.”
A beat longer, then, “Yeah,” Stevens said finally. He gave a fragile smile, visibly shaking off the feeling then. “Come on then, you were taking me to see your workshop?”
The box of scraps was still where he last left it in a mess of tangled wires and broken screens. Another search around the ship revealed the tools he needed to build: soldering iron, pliers, wire cutters, strippers. The equipment here weren’t as robust as his toolbox at home, but it was enough for Tony to begin laying all the wires down and rewiring them for his own use. The hard disks and the RAM were in another pile, waiting and ready to be used for his project. “Awesome Mix Vol. 2” played in the background as he worked, fingers steady and sure as he built. With his eyes focused on the project in front of him, everything else fell into the wayside.
Because even if it wasn’t his fault, it still felt like was with the fact that his wings symbolized death. And there his ma was, in bed, dying in front of him.
Steve couldn’t help himself: he pressed a kiss onto Tony’s lips, and Tony groaned, clinging onto him and deepening it. Tony fingers pressed against the sides of his torso, and Steve clung to Tony for more reasons than if he were to let go, Tony would fall again, and he wouldn’t let Tony fall, just like when Tony promised Steve that he wouldn’t let him fall.
“Thank you, Mr. Rogers. Wakanda appreciates your words.”
I was trying to communicate in a language you would understand.
Tony squeezed back and gave him a beautiful smile. “As you were, Cap.”
He was out of his depth here –
Steve and I really should start charging you, we’re not a pay per view, eat your damn spaghetti.
Rhodey laughed. “Chill, it’s cool.”
And just as Tony was about to whine to Steve, to get in him already, that he was taking way too long to fuck him, a finger pressed against his hole, and then it slipped inside, lube guiding the way. It never occurred to Tony where Steve got the lube; he was too busy being sucked in by Steve’s finger. It took Tony’s breath away; his eyes rolled back into his head while his brain overloaded with the feeling of the intrusion. It wasn’t much, but with Steve, it was everything.
There was a beeping in the corner, the buzzing of wheels in the air, and Tony slowly walked around his work desk to see that DUM-E was alive and well, but that he had fallen over on his way to his charging station.
Steve whined and shuddered, knees almost buckling under him. Tony grabbed his hand again. “Relax,” he said again. “I’ll catch you.”
Nebula shook her head. “I’m a fighter and an assassin, not a scientist.”
His wings...they were finally molting, shedding all the translucent feathers off his back to replace them with new feathers...colored ones, as a signal of the coming of age.

“Butterfingers!” Tony grinned as the bots whizzed down the corridor. “I brought a friend home. Name’s Stevens. I repeat, he’s a friend. Do
And he came inside him as Tony shuddered through the aftershocks of his orgasm, pulsating and wrecking him. He loved it, being owned like this; he could never go out and do anything like this with anyone else ever again, not that now he knew Steve was perfect. And when Steve pulled out, his come leaked out of his loose asshole too, and he couldn’t care less that he was dirty and messy.
Steve swallowed. The unshed tears glistened in his eyes, and he pressed his forehead against the wall. “How are things there?”

He’s now complaining about the “body” of the coffee, telling him that he knows a place that doesn’t over-roast their beans.
I told you that I’d never give it to you. What makes you think I would give it to you?”
When Tony looked past Captain America, he could see that rank scent of blood came from a slash that nearly split Yinsen in half. Yinsen was dead, and it was Captain America’s team who did that.
Steve shook his head. “I’m not playing any games,” Steve replied, words slow and hesitant.
Yinsen growled, pushing the Alpha back when he raised his hand again. They growled at each other, and Tony cowered in the background as they postured. The cave shook again, and dust fell to the floor. Then, as the Alpha snatched his gun, he growled back at them. He pointed the gun at Yinsen. Yinsen growled back, not budging, and Tony watched as the Alpha glared, finger hovering over the trigger.
The sheer simplicity of the question was so complicated that Steve burst out laughing. Because if he didn’t laugh, he would break down and lose all the confidence that Tony had just built within him. “No, I’m not.” Steve closed his eyes.
“Yeah, just this last werewolf,” another voice, probably Rumlow, said. “Good riddance. I can’t wait to get out of this God-forsaken place. Fucking werewolves.”
“I don’t think it works like that,” Tony replied. He pressed his face weakly into Steve’s neck, and there was a teardrop that landed on Steve’s skin. “I’m sorry, Steve. I should have told you…”
Steve breathed and woke up.

But as he held it, his ears perked up at the sounds outside of the cave. They were very faint, but his sharp werewolf hearing could pick up sounds of fighting. There was a loud roar. It was followed by a group of howls that made Tony’s knees shake. Those were Alpha howls, and those sounds bore nothing good.
An armor. That was what he needed. If he couldn’t outrun his captors, his life, he could perhaps shield himself from it. Tony swallowed. His mind worked rapidly, mentally creating an armor that could hopefully protect himself, and protect Yinsen too. “I’m going to build myself armor,” Tony said a beat later.
Tony shrugged. “A prank I guess.”
Tig: Did someone say chapter 2?
“Please, please,
Nebula dipped her head in acknowledgement, and then she turned and faced forward, hand moving the steering wheel. Conversation over, the ensuing silence roared in Tony’s ears. The space between them felt too small for the abundance of pain between them – all the oxygen in the room felt like it had dissipated. He rose from his seat, desperate to get some room. “I’m going down, see what this spaceship has. Perhaps I can build something that could help us a little bit, get home a little faster.”
“Very well.”
What?
Wait, Stark’s getting up too.

I told you.
A laser beam shot out from the robot, completely demolishing the foil. The ashes fluttered gently to the ground, and Tony watched as Butterfingers whirled around happily.
flightless.
I’m going to take away your phone.
Rhodey shook his head. “He likes you. He won’t be able to stay away.”
Oh, I see, well in that case, 😘😌💅✨
, he thought, hating that he was so close and yet will be forever far from them because he was a soldier first, lover second.
“Point, but mini octo-you is so adorable!”
Getting onto the plane was easy. Saving the lives of the American people were easy.
“Yinsen—” Tony started, but Yinsen hissed.
Steve bit his lip, and Tony touched his face so that Steve was looking at him. Tony’s eyes were unwavering and confident, believing in him when he didn’t believe in himself. “I’ll be with you, holding your hand. You won’t fall.”
Hottie: It takes forever for the calves to be born
“It’s the chameleon circuits,” the man replied, stepping closer to the box. “They’re what allow the TARDISes to blend into their environments.”
It was Bruce who broke their standoff. “Our best guess is that he died during the Snap. There was no trace of him.”
Tony leveled him with a steady stare. “We can’t think like that – we would die in the face of hopelessness. We have to pick ourselves up and avenge, Cap. Because that’s who we are: we avenge those who had fallen.”
“Of course, sir. Any other fictional technology you’d like me to fabricate?”

And Steve watched as the stranger’s face fell for just a fraction of a second, but it was enough for Steve to let down his guard a little. “Who are you?” he asked again softly.

And when he’s done, they fall asleep together under the breeze of the autumn wind, taking comfort in each other.
II. FREE FALL
Rhodes isn’t wrong about that.
I’ve named the squirrel Tony. He’s my new friend!
Clint was in the kitchen when he arrived, and the smell of heavenly cookies wafted in the air. Steve inhaled, closing his eyes in pleasure, and moaned softly. Clint heard him and turned.
“What do you want Rogers.” A statement, a tired one. And Steve fully deserved it too. Tony sighed and looked down, and Steve was ashamed to admit that it gave him a little more room to breathe.
“Hey, while you’re here, perhaps you can help me with something,” Tony said as he munched around a mouthful of cookie.
He should move on - he didn’t know whether Tony was gonna come home alive or not, but as long as the dream felt real, he was going to hold on to it and believe. There was no way, now that he knew that Tony loved him, that he was going to give him up now, as long as there was a chance that he was still alive.
Natasha rolled her eyes and reached over to tug his wing muscle playfully. Clint toppled over dramatically, flopping onto Steve’s chest. “Save me!” he cried. Steve stood there, frozen, as Clint buried his face in his chest.
Because he couldn’t tell her that everything was alright, that he’d long plucked out his feathers again and again, the ones that he could reach, when they molted back in. She never knew that his life had been miserable ever since the kids found out how much of a freak he was, and even if Bucky still stuck by his side, there was a cautiousness when Bucky talked to him now.
A beat passed, then a second one. Still, Tony’s eyes remained shut, waiting for something, anything. Then, Steve sighed quietly, and he folded the paper in his hands in half, then in half again, placing it gently on the ground in front of him.
Wow, Tony is cute as shit. Human Tony is alright I guess
“Tony.”
yeehaw
Steve got down and wiped the mess away. “Had a dream earlier.” He paused, deliberating his words before he asked, “Tell me Nat: am I chasing the past? I’ve always believed myself to be a soldier out of time, but I thought I adapted pretty well to the modern world. Yet, does it seem that I’ve been trying to hold on to my old self?”
He was bad luck, and if he could stop anyone from seeing his wings so that he could save them and keep them alive, he would.
“Hey freak!” Archie called out.
Rhodey spluttered. “It’s not healthy.”
Fury ignored his words. “We’ll get you acclimated to the new century, get you settled in.”
They slowly and steadily herded the enemy bots to Thor, where he shorted them out with a well-executed bolt of lightning.
“I can teach you,” Peggy replied, smiling behind her drink, and he matched her grin.
He fled.

echoed in his mind. Black like a raven, harbinger of death, the saying went.
When Steve looked down, Tiny Steve covered his face with his hands, but even his fingers couldn’t completely hide the redness that stained his cheeks.

Steve’s eyes burned. “You’re safe,” he said wetly. This man was more important than any prejudice and superstition.
“I want to come on your cock,” Tony blurted. “Please.”

“On another Kindle Unlimited binge, James?” Pepper quirked an eyebrow, but her eyes only held warmth for her friend.
“It was wrong,” Natasha agreed, “But it’s not about the fact that you’re stuck chasing the past necessarily. Yes, there are some elements that you wanted to hold on to your past life because you missed it, but you also put Bucky over Tony. It probably implied to him that he mattered less to you than Bucky.” She looked down, plucked an imaginary lint off of her pants, and Steve watched as she braced herself to say, “Tony loved you. When you chose Bucky over him, especially with something as important as that, it probably killed him.”

I’m trying to have a peaceful dinner and these two douchebags are making out at the table next to me. It’s in poor taste I tell you. Is that not a health code violation?
Tony scoffed bitterly, “Well, what is there to live for if I do survive?”
His wings fluttered behind him.
“Yours is more dangerous if it gets into the wrong hands,” Tony said. “Good thing this was a clone too and not a true supersoldier.”
He couldn’t do it, and he was panting hard at his exertion. It
, Steve repeated to himself as a mantra, the phrase sounding with each footstep as he walked with Tony across the room. Steve’s plan was foiled, of course, when the photographer asked them to stand so close that their arms touched, and then Steve was sent to a new level of hell when they were instructed to put their arms around each other’s shoulders.
Tony didn’t reply, and Steve kept his hold on him tight, not daring to let go at all for fear that the next time Steve saw him, he would –
“Not your mother!” The front door slammed shut.
“Gone,” Tony replied. “He left.”
Steve promises, “Lots of it. I’ll even collect them with you.” Steve looks down at Tony with bright blue eyes, tongue lolling out in hope and eagerness. "Will you come home with me?"
He must have misheard him. And with all the screaming that was going on, it was entirely possible that he could have heard it wrongly.
All lies.
He finally shook his head. “Nothing, carry on, Mr. Stark.”
He didn’t want to get hurt again.
Asshole: calves? I thought you said your mom
There was a press of lips against his. Steve gasped, but Tony took that as an invitation to lick into his mouth, pressing forward so that Steve lost control of his reality. There were sparks behind his eyes as Tony ravaged his mouth.
Steve nodded, and Tony said as confidently as he could, “We avenge, and we have unfinished business to take care of.”
“What? Again?”
There was no answer. The man was long gone, and he was alone in the middle of the university grounds, where his breath was coming out in visible puffs, and he was standing in front of a thing. He couldn’t stop from feeling a wave of disappointment.
“I have a plan,” Pepper said. “It’ll go faster if you help.”
You know you just live-tweeted our sex life, right? In the middle of the masquerade ball?
“Let’s do this,” Steve said, voice more steady than he felt. He couldn’t bear the stares anymore. He knew what they all said anyway - it was nothing new. He stepped into the chamber and let pain awash his senses as Operation: Rebirth became a reality.
Steve groaned, feeling the heat of Tony’s fingers emanating through his suit.
Baking isn’t Rocket Science
“Yeah,” the man agreed. “It’s not, but why then, is it here?”
Steve looked around. The kids were gawking, as they do, and they were staring at the black feather that Archie held in his hand, holding it proudly in the air like a trophy.
“Language again, Cap? Doesn’t it ever get old?” Even though Tony’s voice sounded flat in his ears, they’ve been working long enough that Steve knew he didn’t mean it. In fact, it sounded as if there was a hint of a smile on his face.
He was completely naked and anyone could see anything. Yet, he found that he couldn’t care less. He wanted everyone to know that Captain America was claiming him, owning him heart, mind, and soul, and no one could take that away from him. He saw himself in the darkened glass, mouth gaping open and breathing harshly like he couldn’t get enough breath, eyes wide and blown and dazed and happy, and his cock was leaking profusely, sending trails of pre-come to the floor.

Oh, how the tables have turned.
Tony grabbed Steve by the arms and lifted him. Steve went willingly enough, keeping eye contact the entire way.
Tears dripped down, marring the drawing of Tony.
Tony drained his coffee and blindly reached for the coffee pot again. It took him a few aborted tries before he curled his fingers around the handle and poured himself another cup of coffee. Having done this so many times for years, he could literally do this while he was asleep. “Really Rhodey, it’s not the first time I’ve gone without sleep. I’ll be fine.”
Stevens looked conflicted, but in the end, he settled on resignation and gratefulness. “Thank you.”
Cow Boy just got up to go to the bathroom, bet he’s about to dine and ditch - bad luck Stark!
“Nothing,” Tony said. Like he wasn’t trying to break into a place that he probably wasn’t supposed to go into, not at all.
“It’s causing trouble, and we need you to help us,” Fury said.
“Did you get Tony’s invite to the Tower?” Clint asked, bouncing on his toes.
“Yes, Captain?”
Clearly, someone had misplaced cop equipment, and as an upstanding citizen of the law, it would only make sense for him to notify the appropriate law authorities of their missing…box, even though Tony was still sure that America didn’t use these.
“There is nothing to exterminate at the moment, Butterfingers!” Tony snapped back, watching the coffee drip into the pot with hungry eyes.

…He didn’t really want to do this anymore.
“How does it all work?” Tony asked. “It’s so hard to imagine that there is a whole world out there than just Earth.”
