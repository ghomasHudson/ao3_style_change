Dean gets it, the whole Bill and Ted’s bullshit adventure. He knows he’s here to learn lessons. Well, they don’t come much clearer than this.
“Dean,” Cas says again, and he lays a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Dean doesn’t turn to look at him, but he goes very still. There’s a moment of silence, and then Cas says, “I could use the company.”
The liquid sloshes in the bottle as it drops back into Cas’s lap, and Cas frowns, his eyes flicking around the cabin.
Cas’s body next to his is so warm and open. Yeah. Fuck it. Dean does want to. And he can’t see how he can make any of this worse than it already is. “Yeah,” he murmurs. “Yeah, all right.”
“Yeah, well. I said I’m in, I’m in. Not like I’m gonna go wandering off.”
Dean waves his hand at the window. “I mean— the whole camp. Cozy. You guys built this?”
But this Cas— the way he’s pulling moves like they
“Yes,” Cas agrees. “—Yes. That helps.”
“Yes,” says Cas, “I know.” He props himself up a little straighter. “So he let you off the leash?”
“Did I,” Dean says.
Cas reaches behind them, and lifts up the blanket hanging over the edge of the bed. On the floor underneath, there’s a small collection of half-full bottles. “No charge for the minibar,” he says.
When Dean doesn’t finish the question, Cas gives him a long, level look, and then he says, “Not in a while.”
Cas rolls himself up onto his feet, and Dean kicks his boots off and follows him onto the bed. Cas doesn’t seem to be in a hurry. They make out for a while longer, and Cas is touching him in this slow, kind of spaced-out way, his hands moving over the flannel of Dean’s shirt like he keeps forgetting who’s there. Maybe Dean was just the first person to walk through the door. Jesus, Cas does this now,
In which facts about cats are traded in deep space.
“Hey, he told me that you guys ran into each other the other night at that book release party. He said you had a good time with you.” Which is not entirely true, Dean just mentioned Cas wasn’t as annoying as he originally thought he was, but in Dean speech that meant Cas is golden.
“Anyways, Jess has been so needy lately. She’s never been like that, but suddenly its like ‘when are we going to have kids, Sam’ and ‘why don’t you spend more time here’. And on top of that, Amelia wants me to meet her father who was apparently in the army. Plus, Dean’s broke and won’t take any help from me, despite the fact he has to pay child support and he still sends money to our father. But Dean’s always been like that, he would rather chose martyrdom than get actual help.”
“Sammy!” Dean yells. Sam turns around, his arms dropping and his face confused and startled.
“I don’t-” the man gasps.
“No,” Castiel chuckles. “No, you’re alive.”
“I resent that,” he protests, even if it’s true. She just rolls her eyes and takes a swig of her drink.
“I wanted to talk to you,” Dean says, his voice strangled. For someone who had a reputation of being cool and smooth, he’s failing to live up that image right now.
Gabriel lets out a dramatic sigh, shrugging as if to suggest “what’s a guy to do?”. Castiel moves to the fridge, taking out the peaches that were freshly delivered this morning.
So he leaves Castiel in the living room, moving Bobby to the kitchen so that they can figure out a plan to find Sammy. Dean tries turning on the GPS of all of Sammy’s phones, but there’s nothing. He calls Stanford and looks through their records to see if they are aware of Sam’s whereabouts seeing that he’s alumni and all. Again, nothing turns up. Sammy should have graduated law school by now and be some great lawyer, but Stanford has nothing on him.
Odd, as it seemed that Dean liked Cas- to the point of being defensive about him. Sam hadn’t heard much about what was going on between the two of them, but lately when he talked to Cas, it had been mostly been about how he been spending some extra time with Dean. Cas was many things, but discreet wasn’t one of them, and Sam was like 90% sure that Cas had little crush on Dean. This was great news for both Dean and Cas as both were in dire need of getting laid (facts were facts). Sam wasn’t sure how Dean felt about Cas, but he was certain that Dean liked Cas enough to hang out, as Dean didn’t suffer fools gladly.
Sam snorts, “You still send Dad money?”
Gabriel ended up being a private investigator puzzled Castiel, but he is a surprisingly good one, even without Castiel’s help. It’s too bad that he’s also a lazy one.
“You know that if I had the power to, I would prevent you from aging. You and Sam,” he tells Dean. “I would have kept you young forever.”
“So why did you guys break up?” Dean spurts out before he can stop himself. He mentally kicks himself.
“Yes,” Castiel mumbles, looking down at his feet. Balthazar looks smugly down at the blushing man.
“Like I said, nothing for you to worry about.”
“Yeah, I think I can find something. You know going to work is kind of against the whole kidnapping and keeping me captured thing.”
“You found a way to summon her?” Dean says in lieu of a greeting.
He also doesn’t want to go downstairs because he has to face the unknown. Dean and Bobby are trained to kill things that children tell each other about over campfires. They don’t like things that are supernatural or odd- a category that Castiel falls squarely into. He’s not naïve, no matter what those two men downstairs think; he know that by joining Dean he’s putting himself in danger, and it’s not just from chasing after demons. Bobby Singer is a man who collects books and oddities, and he’ll probably want to collect knowledge on Castiel too. Gabriel would tell him to high-tail it out of there and go back to baking pies, but… Castiel wants to know too. He wants to know how he ended up some freak of nature and maybe if there is a cure for it. The best result is that that they find something and he can be normal. The worst- well, he’s pretty sure he knows the worst and he’s willing to play the odds.
“Here?”
“You really think that? You think you don’t deserve to be saved?”
Castiel scans the room, only to see his mother lying on the ground.
Sam cringes. Sam never wanted to have this conversation with Cas and this is another thing he needs to scrub out of his mind.
“Yeah, well, I’m more scared of you than that overgrown teddy-bear,” Dean chuckles. “And what do you mean he’s not in a great place. The last time I saw that kid, he looked like he had rainbows shooting out of his ass.”
“Dean.”
“You think he’ll go through with it?” Bobby says, unbothered by the fact that Dean just announced that Sam apparently likes dicks now.
Dean rolls his eyes as he looks at his menu.
It’s almost like he has a guardian angel, because his cell phone rings just before Dean feels like tearing his hair out.
Castiel snorts. He’s heard this before. It’s a classic excuse, and that’s all it is. He’s not supporting Sam on this one.
Immediately, Dean’s back stiffens and he throws down his burger. “You’ve got a problem with that?”
“No, that must have been very sexually humiliating for you. That explains the little girl. A 16 year-old holds no threat to your masculinity.”
“The one? I thought Jess was the one? What makes this person so special?”
Bobby sighs. “Not in my experience. Nothing good can come from defying natural order. You know this. Nothing personal Dean, but the dead are supposed to stay dead.”
“They’re just so plot-less. Every movie seems the same. The oversimplification of human nature, putting people into boxes of either good or bad. Indians are always the villains and the white Americans always win in the end. It seems incredible that a man of your age would enjoy such things.”
“Care to solve this one?” Rufus Turner chuckles. “Since you’re the dog expert and such.”
so that it can be made into a movie.”
“What the fuck are you doing? You fag!”
For the first time in weeks, Dean is somewhere other than his apartment, work or Ellen’s bar. Tonight, Dean finds himself at another party to celebrate that stupid
“Nothing,” Sam mutters, looking at the beer in his hands. Dean rolls his eyes. It was like talking with 15-year old Sammy, the moody emo kid that Dean hoped to never see again.
“And you thought I would be unable to lie to Sam,” he hears Castiel murmur behind him.
“So what you told Gabriel about how you’ve been tracking serial killers since you were fourteen… you were actually hunting?”
“Shit,” he says, because that’s all he really can say. Not only has he fucked up with Castiel, but he also left his little brother alone in what is now he’s greatest hour of need.
you a chance, multiple, but you seemed fit to ignore them. So if it appears that I am coming across as rude, I don’t really care.” Castiel says slowly.
The first part had been a bust, but the second part of the exhibit was photographs. This he understood, although in this case, it seemed to be a display of hipster photographs of half of a bike wheel or rain or something. He was looking at bits of something, an incomplete picture, and it was kind of pissing him off.
“I wasn’t going to mention it,” Castiel says drily. He looks over to Sam. “And you’re sure about this?
Dean nods, “Yeah, he called first thing this morning. Found one person missing about two days ago- a maternity ward nurse named Cindy.” He pulls out a newspaper clipping with a young pretty brunette girl dressed in scrubs on it. “Now we’ve just got a keep an ear out for a guy to go missing.”
The world begins to blur. Beneath him, he can feel his blood rushing out of him, warm against the floor. He can hear Sam yelling and Ruby laughing, but he can no longer see clearly, the edges of vision getting darker and darker.
“I’m fine,” he lies, flipping through the menu. “I think the drive might have ruined my appetite.” His stomach betrays him by growling. He has eaten less than four hours ago, but it feels like longer.
“So, you’re just going to show up on his door step and he’ll tell you where your prodigal brother is at?”
“I might have to downgrade apartments,” Dean sighs, tossing one of the bills aside and reaches for his beer bottle. “I can’t live this part of town anymore. Shit, this was a bad time for Baby to break down.”
Some days Castiel forgets that he caused Mary Winchester’s death. He had spent most of his teenage years waking in cold sweat with the memory of Mary lying dead in her front year and Dean screaming and crying. The only way he could think of honouring her was by making pies- hoping that others would find the comfort in the food like he had. Each pie he makes he sees as an extension of the love she could no longer give. This had placed him in some sort of peace- or at least, kept him too busy to think. With the events of last night, he had forgotten the entire reason he brought Dean back from the dead. Maybe brining back Dean was his final redemption for Mary Winchester.
“Yeah, it was all part of this scheme. It’s what got you killed in the first place. Lilith needed to motivate me to go after her. They’ve been planning this for a long time. Thanks for stabbing her, by the way. That saved us a butt load of trouble.”
“We had plans to hang out this weekend, but he cancelled on me. We were supposed to go see a Vivaldi concert last Wednesday and he cancelled that too. We rarely spend time together and I believe it’s because he thinks I disapprove of his personal choices.”
“Frankly, you,” Castiel says. He expected Dean to return sheepish or still angry, not this cheerful and not this visibly drunk.
happened in this town.
“You own a store? Whatta sell?”
He’s leaning against the counter, making a sandwich, when the question comes back into his head.
For the first time today, Castiel makes eye contact with him and pales. “What do you mean, since you were fourteen?”
“Well, how did you break up? I mean, it must have been a serious relationship if you felt like reproducing with her.”
“I don’t think I can help you,” Dean says quickly. “I don’t remember much about how I died.”
“You didn’t like it?” Castiel shrugs. “It was better than that glass cube thing. That was a piece of junk being oversold as art,” Dean laughs. The rest of the group laugh too, except for Castiel.
But now he has a wanted serial killer in his apartment; a dead one at that.
“How do you know this Bobby Singer?”
“Dean, you were dead,” Sam cries out. “I saw it on the news. Ruby told me. You were confirmed dead.”
“What do you mean by that? What kind of question is that?” Castiel asks flatly.
“Really, you liked that?” Castiel says dubiously.
“Ha-Ha, you’re a real comedian,” Dean reaches over and grabs Castiel’s trench coat, throwing it at him. “Seriously, let’s go.”
Which is kind of a low blow.
Both Bobby and Dean look doubtful.
“Dean?” Bobby says, moving towards Dean.
“Castiel,” Gabriel says roughly. “Can I talk with you in the kitchen?
“Man, I hate those things. Do you think I could call in sick?”
“You have to, Cas. You owe me that.”
Both turn to Castiel.
No, this guy, this tiny dude, clearly has the hots for Dean. He’s been giving him the old goo-goo eyes, discreetly glancing away but also saying, “come talk with me” while Dean was trying to interview two seniors about a dead Rabbi. Plus, the guy went on about how they had a “little eye magic” and Dean’s flustered because never in his life has anyone dared to outright flirt with him like that (outside gay bars and truck stops, of course). There’s not two meanings about this, this guy is into Dean.
“Dean Winchester,” a stern news anchorwoman states, “who was wanted on several counts of murder, attempt of murder, grave desecration, breaking and entering and credit card fraud has been confirmed dead this morning. His body was found three days ago in the small town-”
Frankenstein here?”
“No, I didn’t mean to.” There’s panic in Castiel’s voice and he can feel Dean pulling away, waiting to run out on him, but he needs to say this and he needs Dean to listen. “My mother was dead and then I touched her and she was alive again. I didn’t understand- didn’t know what I was capable of. Your mother is dead because of my ignorance. If I had known better, she would still be alive.”
Next to the girl from the knife throwing act, a leather coat flaps in the light breeze, catching his eye.
The security guard seemed amused. "And the attire?"
“Guess we gotta prepare to be cock-blocked from now on.”
of all things flickered over Cas’s features, though it might have been the shadows playing a trick on Dean’s senses. When he looked more closely, the angel seemed neutral as ever.
"Absolutely not, Gabriel." Castiel shook his head vehemently. "I will not go to a metal concert with you."
"No, no, no. Wait!" Castiel exclaimed in distress, contorting his body to look over his shoulder at his so-called family. They both waved smugly at him and hollered their farewells while he was merrily passed on from one group of hands to another. From his current position, Castiel was even more stunned at how large the gathering of people truly was. And this was only a tribute concert, he couldn't imagine what the band's actual show must have looked like. Even he had to admit that he was impressed.
The guy honest-to-God looks over his own shoulder in confusion. "Are you talking to
- stood there and listened to the sudden silence. Even Cas who'd only just met the whirlwind that was Charlie Bradbury seemed to already miss her bubbly chatter that always made the bunker seem just that notch more homely. Sam was the first to clear his throat and excuse himself to go for a run or read sad news stories about famished children. Whatever.
“Call me a jerk all you want but this just screams angel tantrum to me.” Dean gingerly climbs off his stool, careful to shake glass and other debris out of his short hair. Sam does the same until his brother’s words fully register with him.
Dean swipes his thumb over the green receiver and lifts the phone to his ear. "Couldn't stand not hearing my voice?"
. When he looks up again he feels a little like he got sucker-punched in the gut. Castiel sits more relaxed than ever with one leg tugged underneath him while the other dangles from the couch, his cup is cradled between his hands and resting on his belly, and he smiles with an open fondness at Dean that makes his insides cramp painfully with
Dean stands perfectly still, breathing as ragged as Castiel's suddenly is, and
“Dean!”
"How long?" he repeats sternly, stepping closer with his hands raised, palms facing Castiel as if he's a wild animal that could run off at any moment.
“Even if it is, I can’t stop it now. I have offered my body to Pele, once she takes over I have no control.”
“Dean?” A gravelly voice said, the familiarity of it calling him right back to full consciousness as he shook of the hands that were holding up his head.
“Goodnight, Dean.”
“Look at me,” he prompted softly.
At the mention of his name, her receptionist perks up, not looking very happy with the request.
. If they chose to do all that anyway it was their own damn fault that they ended up disappointed.
honestly, this got a little away from me so I might add an additional chapter, depending on how the next one goes- either way, more shameless shmoop to come.
“I don’t want to leave,” Dean slurred into the half empty bottle of bourbon before passing it back to Cas. In person, honesty came easier with the help of liquor but that didn’t change the fact that the words were a sober truth. They still seemed too soft now, while sitting on the hood of the Impala overlooking the motel parking lot.
, they were waiting on word from Cas, who his nuisance of a little brother had insisted Dean call to help out on the case. If bodies hadn’t been piling up left and right, Dean would have straight up refused. As it was, he didn’t have the luxury to be an evasive bastard. He and Cas had been texting back and forth since Dean had broken their radio silence in the direct aftermath of the siren case, too worked up to stay out of the angel’s hair entirely. Their conversations were unremarkable; brief exchanges about their whereabouts and some mutual updates on whatever they’d been working on. More than a few times Dean had stopped himself before indulging too much and asking how the angel was doing or when they’d see each other again. The risk of sounding desperate was just too big. Plus, if Cas actually
So Dean needs to come up with another idea. Or quite possibly bribe someone to spill the beans on who is behind all this madness. That actually sounds like a pretty solid idea. He scans the ever growing crowd around him for the most distrustful looking face he can find and promptly settles on a guy in a neatly tailored suit that looks like a politician. On closer inspection… it
“How did you meet, if you don’t mind me asking?”
“I’ll be extra nice,” he says softly, feigning innocence as he looks at Cas. “I promise.”
“So what, you're breaking up with me?” Somewhere Dean finds the strength to still raise a bratty eyebrow at him, his lesson far from learned.
"Open up, please," he says, his voice oddly dimmed by the glass between them. Dean just nods and walks over to the door to unlock it. As soon as he turns the lock a second time, Castiel pushes inside with his arms full of brown grocery bags and a duffle bag that Dean recognizes as his own. Immediately he slams the door shut again.
“Me?” Dean forces a laugh, trying to sound amused, but sounding more nervous than anything.
His hand trembles as he holds it out to the birds. “They tortured me,” he says. “Have you ever been trapped alone like that?”
“You think this is your fault,” Cas says. It’s not a question.
He lies there, eyes closed. He could be resting, prepared to open his eyes at any second once he’s ready. When he’s strong enough again.
anymore if you keep calling me 'dude'."
anything from you I…I just want to help you,” he stands up slowly with his hands raised in a placating pose in front of him. I’m not a threat. I’m not a threat.
Mary smiles quietly. Sam just breathes in deep through his nose and keeps his eyes fixed determinedly at the passing scenery.
“He seems to be...losing his memory?” Sam’s voice lowers to a stage whisper and he turns his back entirely on Dean, who’s now perked up on the edge of the bed and is unsubtly trying to eavesdrop. “I’m in over my head Cas, I could really use some help here.”
about the things Dean said to him.
They turn off the light to sleep and Dean rolls onto his side, pulling on Castiel’s arm to urge him to slot in behind him. Cas gets the hint and throws an arm over Dean’s stomach, pulling him tight into his chest and pressing his nose and lips to the nape of Dean’s neck.
A woman is sobbing on the ground in front of them, the sounds of her crying no longer resembling anything human. She wails like an animal, the perfect picture of unrestrained misery.
“You big dummy,” she says, and whacks him in the arm.
Sam doesn’t tell Dean that he already knows this. He doesn’t ask Dean what he means. He knows what he’s trying to say.
“You know, Mary,” he looks at her. “Dean wants to trust people. Honesty is very important to him,” he frowns. “He’s been hurt before by those, me included, who were doing what they thought was right, was for the greater good, but ultimately chose to conceal it from him. There’s some element of hypocrisy there, occasionally, because he has not always shared the truth himself, and has made reckless decisions without thought of how his loved ones would feel if he put himself in harm’s way,” he says. “But he puts family above everything. He needs you to trust him back.”
wow. k. so good mission then.
“Okay,” he worries his bottom lip in his teeth and lets Castiel lead him into the kitchen.
He breathed in deep through his nose. “No, I know,” he stepped properly into the room. “But I just...listen-you know I’m not the greatest at communication right?” Cas snorted softly and Dean pushed lightly at his shoulder. “Hey man, I’m trying here,” he joked. His hand was still on Castiel’s shoulder. He let it slide slowly off, rubbing his thumb on the shoulder seam of his coat.
“No,” They are endless. Faceless. A rolling mass of painful light and crushing darkness. There are so many wings. So many. There are two pitches, but only one voice.
In her jacket, she can feel the perfectly balanced weight of the First Blade. “Well hey,” she winks. “Keep your chin up. I’ve got a good feeling things will work out soon,” with her enhanced hearing, she can hear now the sound of a car turning the corner, the first one to intrude on this quiet suburban street all night. The blade feels so heavy in her pocket. “And not for nothing, but my instincts tend to be pretty much on the mark.”
He knows he’s not being fair at all, but he can’t fucking help it. He doesn’t
“Oh c’mon!” he actually
“Men, amirite?” she offers flippantly, raising her eyebrows. Mindy nods furiously, fiercely.
She will survive this. She has to survive this. This can’t be the end. It just can’t be how it ends.
“Cas, you okay?” Dean’s sister rushes up, face full of concern.
They begin to walk, in silence.
“Yes,” he replies. “You. I want to talk about you, because I want to make sure you know that it’s okay for you to be unhappy.”
“You are the One I’ve always been angry with,” he’s never felt so aware. So awake. “You abandoned Creation from the start. You abandoned Everything. You never cared. You’re selfish. You’re selfish.”
“I-” Dean felt like he was tripping over his tongue. He felt dizzy. “Cas-?”
“I’m fine,” Sam says and cringes at himself. “I mean-I’m fine, but Dean’s not fine.” He can practically hear Cas sitting up straight over the line.
“Oh Dean,” Azazel says, in the smuggest tone he has ever heard from him, even when it was just the two of them, Dean on the racks, him with a collection of his favourite knives. “You didn’t even want to be saved. I know you. I know you better than anyone.”
It might be that Dean would rather be dead than see Cas. It could be. Could be why he hasn’t answered any of the calls he’s made, all saying, in summary that
He wants he wants he wants. Who gives a fuck what he wants?
Mary’s eyes are wide with concern. “You’re…crazy,” she says softly.
“I just said,” she steps forward, getting in his face as much as she can with their height difference is. “Don’t
He tries to raise himself up by pushing his back against his mother’s grave, pulling himself up inch by inch. He feels the stone protest, groaning and bending backward, not built to withstand this much pressure. Azazel seems to be letting him try. Playing with him like some animals like to bloody their prey before letting them go, catching them, and bloodying them up a little bit more. Like the animals that know they don’t need to worry about being able to kill the smaller, weaker animals once the game has lost its fun.
Dean hovered in the doorway. He ran a self-conscious hand through his hair and sighed softly, kicking his toe against the ground. “You know, I was almost worried you left,” he said in a small choked voice. He cleared his throat loudly and forced a laugh.
His eyes are so blue, tired and ancient looking. “You can try.”
it's demon dean but she's a lesbian! cas is also a lesbian. most of this is a scene rewrite where I pull a lot of canon dialogue. it felt like pulling teeth when I was doing it. remind me never to try doing that again. it's like editing. a very small bit at the end is cas being anguished while dean tries to seduce her.
There is a figure standing at the edge of the water.
“Send me back again,” he demands, unhinged. “Let me do it again. Let me try again,” he swallows. “Please,” he adds, in a small, hurt voice.
Dean’s eyes fill with tears again. “Yeah,” his voice is rough. “Yeah. I-” he breathes out. “I remember.”
“He’s-” Sam doesn’t really know how to answer that question. “He’s happy I think? But he’s forgetting everything. He can’t even remember his own
There’s an almost imperceptible intake of breath from Castiel at the contact, and Dean blushes. Another beat of silence and Cas hums in his throat, turning his body towards him.
"No."
about the things Dean said to him.
Cas presses a kiss to his nose. “She’s a Winchester. In the time I spent with her at the bunker, she reminded me so much of you. I see where you get so much of your goodness, and so much of your soul. Your family truly embodies the idea of wrong decisions made for the right reasons. I believe she will be back, but whatever she does, it is not your responsibility,” he extricates a hand to cradle Dean’s cheek. “You aren’t the one who has to carry the weight of everyone else’s emotional burdens, Dean. You are not Atlas holding up the sky.”
Dean suffers on Earth; Dean goes to Hell. Castiel saves Dean from Hell; Dean suffers on Earth. Dean dies on Earth; Dean goes back to Hell. Cas saved him, and then he could no longer save him, and the cycle is over, and the cycle is ended, and the doors have rusted shut on their hinges, and the windows are sealed shut with paint, and the sun rises, and the moon rises also, and no one left alive still cares that anyone ever tried to live in that house, ever tried to make a go of it, the two of us together.
“It’s okay,” Sam interrupts, lump rising in his throat. “It’s okay. Just. Dean. We can’t stay here. He can’t stay here.”
Dean shakes her head.
Dean’s wandered away and is examining the mechanical bull, clearly impressed beyond reason at his forgotten prowess riding Larry. Sam looks at him and sighs.
He thinks he can see the ruins of old civilizations reflected in Castiel’s unbearably deep and sad eyes. “Because I know you won’t remember.”
He feels the bright melting sensation that signifies Castiel taking over the reigns. Dean had basically forgotten about their current scifi symbiote type deal, what with having his breath literally taken away and all. All right. So he’s not gonna die today. Perks of having an angel up your ass.
Today, now, here, Castiel cries on the floor of Sam’s dead brother’s bedroom. There it is, the walls seem to say. Love and silence and nothing else.
They end up sitting at the tiny motel table, talking quietly while Dean sits happily watching crappy television.
"That...sort of did happen to me once," Dean says. "Actually-it happened to me a bunch." He laughs.
“Your mother is an incredible woman,” Cas continues. “I like her very much. But it was wrong of her to imply that you and your brother aren’t truly her sons.”
“I love you,” Cas said it like someone would state the overwhelmingly obvious, like a person trapped in the rain might say
“They would never have done such a thing to
"I know we've never talked about it," Dean says carefully. "But-but maybe...we should. Now."
The other day, Cas accidentally dropped one of the records on the ground and scratched the vinyl. Ever since then, he’s fantasized about Sam’s dead brother coming home and being pissed as fuck about it. He closes his eyes and imagines Sam’s dead brother pouting and demanding to know, rhetorically of course, if Cas knows just how hard it was to
Dean realizes, like an epiphany. He can’t leave.
Dean emerges from the bathroom with red-rimmed eyes like he’s been crying, but an expression that looks like for the life of him he can’t remember ever having anything to cry about. He immediately reinstalls himself on the bed in front of the tv. Castiel is standing, turning in place to marvel at the sticky notes decorating the objects in the motel room.
The prickly hot wave of panic that spread up from his toes at that thought made him push his seat away from the table and go looking for him.
“What does the Bible have to do with-”
“No,” she responds so fast. “No. I could never regret you or your brother. Never. I chose you. You’re the one thing in my life that I chose.”
Their mouths are inches away from each other and Dean is trembling. Cas rubs his hands gently on his waist and makes a comforting sound in his throat. “Is this okay-” he begins, breaking off with a reverent sigh when Dean closes the space between them and presses their lips together.
Dying isn’t the same, when you’re an angel. Humans die and they go to the dust, to the ashes, and so forth. They become the Earth. Their souls move on. A human soul passes through others, on its way to the next plane, the final bus stop. It touches people. It moves through them. When someone dies, their soul rips through the centre of the people closest to them. It’s tangible and it’s violent. Castiel has seen it bring people to their knees. Seen it control heartbeats.
There’s a road in the crescendo and he can feel it stretch out through the stars. It’s ending somewhere. Something is reaching out to him.
“I think he-we’re gonna be okay,” she says and he hums. “I-Castiel, I need you to know that I would never want my son to feel ashamed. Dean or-or Sam.”
Or maybe this is it. Perhaps this is just all there is, and there is nowhere more they can go.
“But what if I-Hey!” Dean exclaims as Cas pointedly lets go of him and rolls to the other side of the bed. “Noooo, please come back I won’t do it anymore, I swear. Whatever you want."
“I’ll always want you with me, Cas,” he slurs, dazed and overwhelmed. “I need you.”
me? Why have you been acting weird this
“Are you…good?” he asks. His heart is beating kinda fast.
Space and Time are one and the same, and he travels through them now. It is not linear, but then again time is only linear by illusion. For simplicity’s sake, we all get one narrative to follow. One life to live.
Dean does a
She coughs, clears her throat. “Castiel. I’m not Castiel,” she pauses. “It’s me,” she says, frowning.
this is part 2 of my excerpts from my abandoned 2017 dcbb sandman comics au: a scene where anna reunites with her brother dream, and a scene where cas and dean face off against azazel in the dream realm.
“The role of a Maker is not to control, but to Create,” Their tone is unmoved.
Unfortunately, Dean can still hear the synapses firing in his brain so he just has to-
“Really?” Dean says.
If Dean didn’t know better, he’d say Cas actually looks sorry. “She already has,” he replies. Statement of fact. Cold hard truth.
Miraculously, Lester still seems to think he’s retained even one shred of credibility or dignity. “Yeah,” he replies. “I know what an alibi is. I watch
"Geez Cas," Dean says. "You know. What happened. Back then."
Yes. Don’t get out of bed. “It’s so important,” he’s shaking. “I know it sounds-it sounds really stupid. But it’s the most important thing to remember. You can’t forget. Promise me-please, Mary, please promise me,” tears are rolling down his face and he sniffs self-consciously, frantically wiping at his cheek with the heel of his hand. “November 2nd 1983-just-”
Sam started blinking normally again. “Sorry, didn’t mean to interrogate you. It’s your business, I just want to make sure I respect your business, you know.”
When Sam walks into the kitchen, he knows it’s going to be a long day.
Castiel broke his wrist without hesitation and Dean gasped in shock at the sickening
Sam blinks rapidly and shakes himself a little bit. “Uh-no,” he says. “Let’s check out back.”
“Castiel?” his voice breaks in half.
Alastair stopped smiling. “Yes,” he says. “You have.”
When he manages to get enough of a fucking grip to stand, he splashes his face in the sink and fills himself a glass of water. Downs it. Fills another. He’s still trembling when he reaches for his phone, flicking through messages for something to do, when his eyes fall on his last conversation with Castiel, ages ago now.
“You just hang back little boy,” Azazel says mockingly. “Let the grownups have their fight.”
God, what a fucking joke.
Tears are smearing dirt tracks down his cheeks as his knees make hollows on the ground. Some might call this a vigil.
"Oh," this was a joke right. Cas was trying to make a joke. A fucking weird, fucked up joke. "But Naomi is dead."
Dean pushes himself up on one elbow as Cas’s head bobs away from him, and Cas looks up. His mouth is still open, the tip of his tongue resting on his bottom lip, and whatever he sees in Dean’s face makes him smile. Then he fits his palm over Dean’s dick inside his jeans, and Dean pushes up against him without a thought in his head.
, it would be fine. And Dean’s plenty used to being somebody’s nearest warm body. Hell, he’s liked it. Usually it’s hot. Not that it’s happened with a dude, but— well, if it did, it would be— yeah. Probably something like this. Something convenient.
Cas’s kiss is light, his lips barely moving. Their mouths are just touching, warm and close. There’s nothing to stop Dean from pulling away, or pushing Cas off him, cutting whatever this is off at the knees. But he stays where he is.
“Wait,” Dean says, breaking away, Cas’s mouth trying blindly to follow his. “No, stop.” Cas is breathless, blinking in confusion, one hand shoved into the drawstring waistband of his pants. Dean tugs at the first handful of Cas’s shirt he can reach, pulling at the material over his shoulder, making it slide off-center. “C’mon, take it off, let me see you.”
Dean nods. Then he gathers Cas back against him so that he doesn’t have to keep looking him in the eye.
“And how long you all been here?”
, maybe he does, but Jesus Christ, not like this.
Dean is still half-dressed, but not for long. Cas is pulling open his button-down and twisting his t-shirt up over his head, inhaling softly at the sight of him. Dean feels weirdly exposed— despite the fact he’s never really minded being naked, despite the fact that Cas has literally just sucked his cock. But Cas is staring at the raised red handprint on his left shoulder, and for a moment Dean is just watching him stare at it, and neither of them do anything. Then Cas brushes the back of his fingers against the scar, very carefully, and Dean feels something huge and bright and terrifying welling inside him.
— but instead, Cas slides his fingers further back.
In the end, Dean chickens out and says, “What is this place?”
“Okay,” Dean says. He lets himself look at Cas for a little longer. There’s color in him, a brightness that’s been missing all day. He looks alive. “Come here.”
Cas shakes his head. “Like I said, no charge. Open to all comers.”
Cas raises his head again, slowly, and there’s something shuttered in his expression. He says, “You miss what I was.”
Dean groans, and for a second it’s pure relief. Cas licks him like a frigging popsicle, and then he swallows him down, sucking wet and slow. Dean breathes deep, the good heat of it spreading out through his body, skin prickling. This should feel crazy, watching Cas do this, working Dean over like it’s nothing, like he could do it with his hands tied behind his back. Who the hell has Cas been learning to suck a dick on, anyway?
“Don’t what?” Cas sounds genuinely curious. When Dean doesn’t answer, he says, “Dean. Do you— can I do that again?”
He runs his hands up Cas’s legs, feeling the heat of his skin, the weirdly perfect angle of Cas’s hipbones as he settles his thumbs against them. Cas is watching him, the rise and fall of his chest slow and heavy. Dean slides his hands up and touches him there too, feeling Cas’s torso and his ribs, the jut of his collarbone. There’s something lived-in about Cas’s body, worn and battered, like the sheen of heaven has rubbed off it. But he’s no less magnetic.
“Yeah,” says Dean. And then, when Cas keeps up that slow, doe-eyed blink, “It’s— I’m, you know— Mark I.”
“Cas,” Dean says. His voice comes out rougher than he was expecting, ashamed and aroused.
The material is damp when Cas finally pulls it away, tugging Dean’s jeans and underwear down, stripping them off so that Dean can open his legs and let Cas crawl back between them. “Fuck,” Dean says when Cas wraps his hand around his dick, and “Yeah, okay, yeah,” when he bends his head and puts his mouth on it.
“Oh.” Cas shakes his head. “No. This used to be a summer camp. Long abandoned by the time we found it, but it had what we needed. Enough to support a small community— plumbing, storage, cooking facilities. But it was remote enough to be defensible.”
A hot rush of panic catches in Dean’s throat. This isn’t— he doesn’t do this. Doesn’t let himself do this. Kiss dudes, be kissed by dudes, whatever. It’s not even a safe thing to think about, let alone— fuck, that’s not even the issue, the issue is Cas, kissing
“Please,” Cas says, his voice coarse and quiet. “Please do that. Please touch me.”
But that’s not a good question to ask, because Dean knows the answer, and he’s known it all evening. He could feel it in that ragtag council of war, watching himself and Cas bitch at each other across the room. He might even have known it all day, since he found Cas in the cabin this morning and looked him in the eye, and the indefinable energy of being in a room with Cas turned suddenly, starkly definable. Cas rubs the flat of his tongue just below the head of Dean’s dick, and Dean’s hips buck forward, and Cas moves backwards perfectly in sync, expecting it. Because he knows how to suck Dean’s dick, specifically. Of course he does.
“Huh,” says Dean. “Well. That’s cool.” He picks up the rye, and Cas lets the blanket fall back into place.
Cas doesn’t offer him a glass, so Dean just unscrews the top of the bottle and takes a shot. He could go for getting wasted, actually, if it wasn’t for the imminent suicide mission. Still, something’s better than nothing. He wipes the top of the bottle and hands it to Cas.
Cas doesn’t even really fuck him, just rubs his fingers over and over against his rim until Dean’s dick is aching and twitching with sharp, sordid pleasure. Dean wonders how many times they’ve done this. Whether he asked Cas to do it. Whether he’s let Cas fuck him for real. There’s a dark, strangling curl of heat in his throat that makes him sure that he has. When Cas finally pushes the tip of his finger inside him, Dean goes hot with relief and then falls apart, gritting his teeth as he comes, Cas’s mouth sliding back over him until he’s done.
Mindy steps back in, hand on the doorknob. “Well, I hope you’re right,” she says. “At this point I feel like I need a fucking angel to come down from the clouds and give me a miracle.”
Dean has ended up curled inward like a bean with his head pillowed on Castiel’s chest when his eyes fall on his digital clock. “Well whaddaya know,” he mumbles into Castiel’s shirt. “It’s almost morning.”
“Mom-” Dean starts to speak, his eyes wide, but she presses on. She needs to press on. She’s never talked about this before.
"Obviously not, Dean," he replies, clipped and agitated.
Castiel sighs and strides into the room. Dean’s eyes go comically wide and flick between Sam and the new arrival. He drops the slice of pizza he’s holding and it lands with a wet
Castiel slinks back to the bunker late that night. In his typical way, he makes no fanfare of his arrival. Dean is leaning against the counter having a drink. Maybe he’s had a few already. When he hears
Dean laughs briefly. “Damn, all that crap gave me a headache,” he stretches and Castiel wraps his free arm protectively around him.
Castiel got angry at that one. He stabbed him through the eye.
"Oh."
Cas looks stunned. If he had been shielded by ice a minute ago, Dean might as well have just opened his big mouth, coughed up a fucking sledgehammer and shattered it to pieces. He would say Cas looks like he's just been stabbed but well, Dean actually did stab Cas once and as far as he remembers it, Cas just smiled.

There’s grief deep in her bones when she thinks of how
“Okay…” Sam stares at him inscrutably, and God, Dean
He was given the best chance, the best fucking chance anyone has ever gotten in the world, to save his family. And he failed. He just
“These are pictures from Benjamin’s collection,” Cas turned back to appraise the frames. There’s several portraits, and a group shot, everyone staring severely at the camera. “This is us, as we were at the turn of the century.”
insistently patting the spot. “Watch cartoons with me, buddy.”
“For the truth,” Cas says. “Now you know everything we do.”
“Talk about what in front of who?” Castiel settled himself casually in the seat right next to Dean, shifting the legs of the chair to move even closer. He did it so nonchalantly, like it meant nothing at all to sit within kissing distance to your closest friend, who’s been having secret high-definition quality vivid sex dreams about you.
“Where am I?” Castiel’s wings are sharp. They shine like the long dead stars whose light reaches the world across time and space. He does not avert his gaze.
Dean abruptly stood up and stormed out of the room. Sam and Castiel watched him go, Sam with a mixed expression of concern and amusement, Castiel with his head tilted, looking bewildered.
and let himself forget the whole rulebook that went along with Platonic Hugs Between Straight Buddies. He could remind himself again of all the reasons why Dean and Cas could never be
Fuck, it had certainly felt
Though there was nothing that had felt
Dean whirls around and strikes at him again, this time landing a slash across Azazel’s arm. He almost looks impressed, but Dean doesn’t waste any time and aims directly for his heart. This time, Azazel easily dodges it, flashing out of existence entirely for a moment before reappearing directly behind him. “Hello, Dean,” he breathes in his ear and Dean jumps and tries to run, choking when Azazel uses his arm to grab him around the throat.
“I am sorry Anna,” his face is mournful, looking up at Death. “I was trapped. Summoned and locked away for lifetimes. It was…” he pauses and stares at the ground. “It was…very unpleasant.”
Alastair sucks the spit down his throat. It makes a disgusting sound. “Oh I know,” he sounds delighted, the way he’d sound if he was watching a baby bird about to be pulverized with stones. “You came for your blade.”
*AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT*
Dean lets himself sag into Castiel, feeling how solid he is, how capable Cas is of holding him tight and keeping both of them upright and still. “I meant it,” he mumbles somewhere into his shoulder and Castiel’s lips brush his temple almost imperceptibly.
“So I know-you know I get it,” she’s twisting her hands together, her voice soft. “It’s really hard. It’s just hard to-you know, I didn’t even think of myself as-” a long shaky breath. “I thought I could want to be with women, without that changing me-without changing who I thought I was. I could want this and still want-want what my father wanted for me. A husband. Kids. It-it never occurred to me that my life could be about anything else. That
“Take it easy,” Dean repeats. She almost does. But then she remembers.
you’re dense. Connect the dots, Lester!”
Dean waited until she heard the
He bangs on the window and Dean just flips him off.
Someone knocked on the door.
"I know," he says. "That doesn't change the fact that I did hurt you."
“Oh Dream,” she says, notes of sadness playing in her voice. He looks up again at the use of his name, the only one that has survived eternity, across language and thought and idea and
Dean is going to stab himself in the ear for that accidental innuendo.
But Lucifer had been dead for centuries now, and Hell had been under new management for quite some time.
Tears are rolling down his cheeks and he buries his face in her shoulder. “I know who you are,” he’s getting salt water on her coat. “Mary, I know who you are.”
on another night, when he hadn’t been certain for more than one horrible moment that Castiel was going to die and Dean wasn’t going to be able to die for him.
A woman is clutching his face almost tenderly in both her cold hands, hovering over him like she’s about to embrace him. He gasps panicked, eyes moving wildly like a terrified animal. The pulse point in his throat flutters under her hands and she dips her face closer to him until their lips are inches from each other. She inhales and he splutters, feeling the air being drawn out from deep in his lungs through his throat. He thrashes around as spots begin to burst in his vision, black with blood red around the edges.
The moment doesn’t last. Dean grins at her and winks. “Me too, babe,” she replies. “You were great.”
“I couldn’t stop any of it,” Dean says. “She still made the deal,” he thinks of his warning.
ok if you've seen brokeback mountain i'm sure you know what scene this was about.
He just shook his head. “Nah, that’s not it. I mean, it
“Where’s Sam?” Max asks, not meeting his eyes. He looks straight ahead at the lineup of liquor bottles propped up against the back of the wood shelves and curls a hand around his drink like he’s wrapping an arm around a date.
Castiel will not punish Dean. He will not strike him down. Everyone knows that. All of them know, in every place between the sky and earth and everything below. It’s impossible to be a commander with such a glaring weakness. His love is like a target painted neon and corrosive on his heart saying
“Oh Lester,” she shakes her head at him. Okay, this is getting fun again. “Why do I do anything? I’m a demon, remember,” he looks a little more scared of her, which she appreciates. “Maybe I just didn’t like your face. Or your fuckin’ ugly moustache…which-seriously dude? It’s not the 70s. Get a razor and go to town.”
he clears his throat uncomfortably. “I mean, what did he do after-”
“I’m glad,” Cas says. There’s nothing particularly effusive or outwardly emotional about his tone, but it’s Cas and yeah he does sound like he is
“Mary. What did he say to you,” his words come out so quiet, but she still hears him.
with me.”
They sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, Dean in his Dead Guy robe cradling his coffee and Sam reading with his head bent over, brushing his hair out of his eyes every so often when it fell in his face.
Dean’s heart stuttered a beat and he mumbled a brief yeah, okay, before shuffling around awkwardly pretending to examine the room. Castiel reached out and caressed the side of a photo frame, just once, briefly.
Castiel pulls back just far enough to reach up and wipe at the tears and tear tracks on his face. “Yes, I think I would.”
He bites back a hysterical giggle.
And isn’t it just a real dumpster load of irony that a guy like that still has the nerve.
Cas hummed. “Thank you.”
“Cas, I-”
, cracking his mind open, flaying his memories. Naomi might have her own vendetta here, might resent him for being so incredibly, chronically inept at bending to the will of Heaven but he couldn't deny the practicality of her plan. Dean was notoriously hard to kill. Dean had not followed orders, had knocked the whole game off the table and what was worse is he'd pulled Cas down with him. As if he would let any other angel kill him. As if anyone else could get so close. Sometimes, Cas allows himself to believe that Dean must love him.
He appraises her. “I didn’t think you would. But I’m not always the best judge of human character,” he pauses, and his mouth twitches in humour. “Sam, as far as I can discern, seems to be heterosexual. So you don’t need to worry about that.”
“Why would you-” he’s stammering again. “Why would you care why would you do that I made a
“No,” They seem pleased. “We are not. You See now.”
He always caught the words on the tip of his tongue, realizing at the last second and feeling stupid. He just forgot sometimes. Self-centred, selfish, dumb to forget.
“How did you get out of your deal?”
He sees his garrison, his brothers and sisters. He sees the gardens in Heaven. His favourite pocket dimensions. The eternal Tuesday afternoon.
“Not the first time I’ve gotten around by myself,” he replies. “People like me! They’re practically falling over themselves to help out the handsome mystery drifter,” he grins at his own joke. “I mean. It’s inconvenient, yeah,” he admits. “But I’ll work something out.”
“John isn’t-” he says into her hair. “He isn’t all you have left. I-”
, Dean lets himself think.
he wants to say.
Castiel rolls his eyes to the roof, ignoring the way Dean bristles. “If you don’t wish to accompany me, I will gladly go alone,” he speaks, exhaustion dripping from every syllable.
Dean gratefully accepted the mug and took a sip. “Yeah, well, nothing like a demon dry spell to get yourself some rest, I suppose.”
“Good night Dean,” Sam swipes his thumbs hastily under his eyes and turns to go.
“That was your first kiss?” Mary tries to put just enough
“Is it okay if I keep them here?” Dean startled a little at Castiel’s voice, he was closer to him than he had thought. “I apologize, I should have asked.”
Max reacts as though he’s been slapped. “Oh shit,” he says, eyes wide. “Shit. I’m sorry.”
“Mom’s leaving,” he half-mumbles it into the pillow. “Sam and me being all grown up is too weird for her to handle. She said she misses Dad…misses her sons.”
“If you were like,” he feels likes his whole face must be bright red at this point. “If you were to…describe it. Uh. What would you say.”
The last time Dean saw Cas, the real Cas, he’d dragged him to that whorehouse. Dean rubs his knuckles into his eyes, trying to remember why that had seemed like a good idea at the time, what the fuck he was thinking. He’s already doing it, trying to pull Cas down into the dirt. At least it hadn’t worked. It’s not too late. He doesn’t know what it is he’s going to do wrong, but it could be any of it, all of it. But he can’t leave Cas stained if he never marks him in the first place.
But it was either come here, or sit alone in the empty, depressing hut that Dean woke up in this morning. Or else hang around the camp, getting in the way as the trucks are loaded, watching himself bark orders. The ruler of this grim little kingdom. And having to look himself in the eye is maybe the only thing that’s making the world tilt more sharply than having to look at Cas.
“You play poker?” Dean asks, which seems the safest bet. “You got a deck of cards?”
Dean can’t really imagine it, being forced off the road. There’s an itchy feeling of being stranded in this camp. Squeezed into a trap. Dean thinks of Baby junked and neglected out in the forest, all that dead broken metal, and the sick feeling in his gut comes back. The guy who left her there must’ve given up a long time ago.
Although the more of Dean that Cas touches, the less distracted he seems. It’s almost like he’s grounding, tuning into something. His hand comes to the side of Dean’s face, thumb tracing over Dean’s cheekbone, and his mouth against Dean’s gets a little less sloppy, more focused. He fits his other hand to Dean’s hip like it’s comfortable there, and presses slow, hot kisses down Dean’s neck, nosing at his collarbone. When he slides his fingers under the hem of Dean’s t-shirt and pushes it up, touching his mouth to a spot just between Dean’s ribs, it’s a smooth, easy movement that leaves Dean shifting in surprise. Cas is half on top of him, tongue moving in gentle whorls on Dean’s abdomen before he kisses downwards, inch by inch.
it before. But he keeps looking.
Cas drinks again. The bracelets on his wrist click gently together. Then he says, “You could get your head down, if you want.” He tips his own head backwards against the end of the bed. “Couple of hours. It’ll be a long enough drive once we get going.”
“All right then.” Dean puts the bottle down by his side with a thunk. All of a sudden, it’s too much, the cloying air and the sideways-shifted mindfuck of everything here. That lonely cabin on the other side of the camp isn’t looking like so bad an idea. He stretches forward, about to push himself to his feet.
“Me and you,” Dean blurts out. Cas’s mouth slides off his palm. “We’re— we… ”
“Yeah.”
Dean can’t keep a tight enough grip on this conversation. “Helps what?”
Dean feels weirdly reluctant. Only that’s stupid, because Dean came here in the first place, and he did that so that he and Cas could talk. But now he’s here, and it’s just the two of them, there’s no getting away from the fact that this isn’t Cas. Dean doesn’t know who this person is, this half-familiar stranger with Cas’s face. He moves wrong, looks wrong, eyes too wide and limbs too loose. Even the hair’s not quite right. It’s like Dean can’t look away, but when he is looking, he wishes he wasn’t. It makes him feel off-balance.
“It’s past eleven,” Dean says, in explanation.
Cas’s hand tightens on Dean’s, his nails digging in almost painfully, and then he comes, eyes squeezed shut and mouth open on some voiceless word.
“No?” Cas says. His gaze on Dean feels heavy and slow-moving, like treacle. “Do you want to do something else?”
For a while Dean has two hands in Cas’s hair, one pushing damp strands back from his forehead, one cradling the back of his head. Then he reaches down to stroke Cas’s shoulder, wandering across the muscles of his upper back. When he touches the side of Cas’s face, Cas immediately shifts his angle on Dean’s cock so that the head of it presses against his cheek, into Dean’s hand. Dean makes a tight, surprised noise, and Cas does it again. Dean wants to look away. It’s too intimate, too lewd, too specific. Cas has done it before; Dean has
, Dean thinks, Cas’s tongue curling around him,
Cas pleading with him is as weird and shameful as every other part of this, and it makes something in Dean’s chest constrict, but he doesn’t need telling twice. He slides his hand back into Cas’s hair, and Cas’s eyes fall closed and his face goes slack, and for a second he’s drifting, unrecognizable. But when his eyes open again, the laser focus of his expression is frighteningly familiar.
moves, teasing, breathing a damp spot onto the gray cotton— is making something dark and tight curl under Dean’s skin. It’s like finding the porno ripoffs of movies you remember watching as a kid, several refractions of wrong, getting off even as you know you’re probably ruining something you loved once and you’re not going to be able to undo it. But that’s kind of why you keep watching.
to know how to do this. Wants him not to need to know, not to be reduced to the indignities of being human, scrabbling around down here in the dust for comfort. But mainly he just wants to touch Cas himself.
“Not here, I bet they don’t.”
Cas kisses him again, less hesitantly. And it gets easier, then, to go along with it. It’s just kissing, which is normal, and the slightly drunk-sloppy slide of it is normal— Dean could stand to be a hell of a lot drunker to be doing this, for sure, but the low buzz under his skin smooths the way a little. When he feels the flicker of Cas’s tongue against his lips, Dean leans into his mouth.
Cas is on the floor. He’s sat leaning against the foot of his bed, curled in on himself, his head dropped almost onto his chest. Dean thinks for a second he’s asleep. But then Cas lifts his head in a slow, heavy roll, blinking like Dean is coming into focus. “It’s you,” he says.
Dean watches Cas drink a long couple of swallows from the bottle like water.
Cas squints at the watch on his wrist. “Still a couple of hours til showtime. You could get into any kind of trouble before then.”
Not for the first time, Dean wonders if any of this is real. The croats, the camp, the whole shebang. Whether it’s bona fide Back to the Future, or just a nice little cautionary tale that heaven’s thrown together to put the thumbscrews on. But if it
There’s a ton of things Dean could ask. There’s a clicking chamber of uneasy questions in his head, and he came here because Cas more than anyone seemed like he would talk. But every time the words form on the back of Dean’s tongue—
Dean feels something inside him crumbling, some rotten place that’s not worth defending. Cas has already been there; Cas already knows him. And not just this Cas, but Cas back home, too. The way he’s always looked straight at Dean, like he can sift through all his fear and inadequacy and shame without blinking. He knows everything. It’s too late, or it doesn’t matter. Dean closes his eyes and lets his legs fall further open.
“Uh— ” says Dean, by which he means he’s not sure what, exactly, but then Cas is rubbing his wet fingers underneath his balls, and Dean is shuddering, his skin sparking. Dean makes an encouraging noise—
Dean gets it. The end of the world. In need of some company. All comers. It’s what people do, and it’s what Cas does now, and that’s fine. Well— no, it’s not fine, it’s as wrong as everything else Dean’s seen here, but if Dean could forget for one moment that this is or was
real, then what the fuck is this, Cas curled over him like they’re at the Bunny Ranch, some sick fantasy that Zachariah’s yanked out of Dean’s id?
When Cas tugs his flies open, Dean lifts his hips again. But instead of undressing him, Cas just leans down to meet him as Dean moves upward, coming up against the shape of Dean’s cock in his underwear. Cas kind of nuzzles there, not quite opening his mouth, not even quite breathing on him. He just rubs back and forth, the brush of his nose and cheek against the stretch of the cotton, and hums quietly.
Cas props himself up and stares down at Dean’s face again. It’s a long, searching look, and the back of Dean’s neck prickles. Then Cas presses another of those odd, careful kisses to his forehead. It makes Dean think of Cas’s fingertips at the same spot, bright and surging like an electric charge. But when Cas settles back down against him, he feels warm and grubby and human, and the need with which he presses them together is human, too. Not desire, just the instinct to be close. It’s almost more frightening than the desire.
“Yes,” Cas says, and his mouth twitches. “I suppose I should try to stop you.”
Dean goes very tense. There’s something tight and terrified thudding in his chest, and he can’t unwind it, even though it’s all mixed up with how hot he is for everything else, with the sight of Cas down there starting to mouth again at the head of his dick. But feeling him freeze, Cas stops and looks up. Dean’s hand is still tangled in the mess of his hair. He looks— not surprised, not concerned, not even questioning. Just patient. He watches Dean and waits.
Staring down at Dean’s hands on him, Cas starts touching himself again, and Dean lets himself look at that, too. Cas’s fist is tight and slow on his cock, and Dean is burning with want. He wants to see this. He wants to know that Cas can do this, to know that if Cas has to be stuck in this hell of a future, he can at least make himself feel good. And, low and uncomfortable beneath the heat, he wants Cas
Cas goes very still, and Dean feels his own muscles tense in response. He’s done something wrong. But then Cas pushes up into his hand like a cat, and for the first time he makes a sound, low and wanting. The depth of it reverberates around Dean’s body, making him shiver, and he curls his hand gently into Cas’s hair.
Cas doesn’t answer. His hand is still on Dean’s shoulder. When Dean forces himself to look, Cas, as ever, seems to be too close.
Dean smooths his hand across Cas’s skin, and fits his hand around Cas’s where it’s wrapped around his cock. Cas nods jerkily, his eyelids fluttering, and tries to spread his fingers so that Dean’s can fit between them, but the angle of their hands is clumsy and it doesn’t work. So Cas lets go and lets Dean take hold of him instead. He’s hot and iron-hard in Dean’s palm, and he twitches into his fist with a rough noise of almost-satisfaction. Then he puts his hand on top of Dean’s, and he pulls, and Dean gets it, and he lets Cas show him what he wants.
“I thought you had plenty of company. Open bar and all.”
“Look, I just— I should go clean up, get ready to roll.”
Something indescribable passes over Cas’s face, something strange and desperate. But he sits back and yanks the shirt over his head, dropping it onto the floor by the bed. His pants are loose enough that they fall easily around his thighs when Dean pulls, even when Cas moves closer and swings his knees apart to straddle Dean’s hips.
Dean can feel his own pulse jumping in his neck, like it’s trying to get out of him. He doesn’t want Cas to ask. He wants him to just do it. After a moment, eyes still shut, he nods.
— the idea of having to hear the answer makes something tired and sick twist in his stomach.
“That seems to me exactly what you might do.”
Dean’s still letting that thought settle around him when Cas pulls off, his hand at the base of Dean’s dick starting to jack him slowly, slippery with spit. Okay, so maybe he’s not going to come in Cas’s mouth, but at this point it’s hard to care. Dean gasps as he rolls his hips up, conscious thought disintegrating, but when he looks down he sees Cas has two of his own fingers in his mouth, bobbing his head on them like he had on Dean’s dick.
“Since you know me so well, huh?”
Dean looks closer. There’s rye, bourbon, tequila— absinthe?— and a couple of colorless, unlabelled bottles that he figures for some kind of moonshine. “What, you hoarding?”
Dean doesn’t. He dislikes the guy out there enough that he’d rather not talk about it, so he shrugs. “Nobody likes looking in the mirror too long.”
Cas’s mouth brushes against the swell of Dean’s dick, and a voice in Dean’s head murmurs,
Not if you want him intact.
Cas’s upward-turned smile spreads further, and he shakes his head. “No. Neither.”
Dean’s hand is resting lightly on Cas’s back, between his shoulder blades. He moves it up and down. “Hey,” he says, “I’m right here.” But he knows what Cas means. There’s no point pretending. It’s still true, though: the other him is right here too, or at least he’s right outside. Just a few cabins over.
Cas nods. “Okay,” he says. “So there’s still time.”
Dean snorts. “Good luck with that.”
So he shakes his head, and takes another pull on the rye. He can feel Cas watching him while he does it, and it makes him not want to look up. But there’s only so long he can hold the bottle to his mouth.
“How’s that?”
There’s nowhere really to knock, so Dean stands for a moment on the porch. Then he pushes the beaded curtain of Cas’s cabin to one side, clears his throat as he steps in, and says, “Hey.”
They kiss for what feels like a long time. Cas tastes like rye and ash, and he kisses the same way his body seems to move now, loose and messy and not all there. Still, his hand latches onto one side of Dean’s neck, big and warm. Now that the wave of shock has passed, now that Dean’s heart isn’t racing so fast, kissing Cas is weirdly— easy. Weirdly so easy to do.
Cas is looking at him. After a moment, he says, “You don’t like him.” He sounds interested.
Cas looks up. He presses an oddly gentle kiss to the base of Dean’s stomach, into the scratch of hair arrowing up from his waistband. Then he puts his mouth over the head of Dean’s dick through the cotton, and rubs his tongue there until Dean swears and shifts on the blankets, sweating in his clothes.
Dean chokes on a hard breath, and fights the impulse to look away, it’s so unlike anything he can bring himself to picture Cas doing. Because if he ever— if they ever— well, Cas wouldn’t be like this. He’d be… unsure, maybe, but direct. Methodical. Curious to understand.
Dean’s breath catches. He lifts his hand and brushes it against Cas’s head, and after a moment, he lets it settle there.
There’s a burst of noise from outside: something being moved, the rise and fall of voices. Dean’s watch came off somewhere around the same time as his shirt. He gropes with his free hand in the sheets until he finds it. Cas feels him move, his fingers tightening for a moment on Dean’s skin, and he looks up again.
“Yeah,” Dean says, his voice a rasp. Cas is making soft sounds in the back of his throat, but they’re getting louder as he moves Dean’s hand on him harder and faster. “Yeah, come on, do it.”
So Dean breathes in, dust and incense and pot hitting the back of his throat. Usually, when Cas pops up from nowhere, the air changes: electricity on the tongue, the taste of oncoming rain, like the air before a storm. It’s nothing like this. But Dean goes to sit on the floor anyway.
“My understanding is that many people do.”
“Does he miss you?” Dean asks.
Dean watches Cas’s gaze drop from his eyes to his mouth. It makes his lips feel dry, and he licks them. Cas breathes in, and then he leans forward and kisses him.
Cas hums in something that might or might not be agreement. But either he’s picking up on Dean’s discomfort— which would be a freakin’ first— or he just loses interest, because he lets it go. Instead he stretches, rolling his arms in his sockets and flexing them up above his head to pop his shoulders. It’s a movement that’s so out of place it makes Dean stare.
“Dean,” Castiel reaches out to Dean, but quickly pulls back. “I want to come with you. Plus,” he says with a humourless chuckle, “if we really wanted to get rid of you, we could have ‘zapped’ you in my apartment. It would have been difficult, but it’s not the first time we’ve removed a body from there.”
Dean lets out a snort. “I still can’t believe you named your dog Waffles.”
After that, he quits trying to sleep and gets up to make breakfast. Castiel enters the kitchen just after 9, looking less than pleased to be awake. Dean’s only spent two nights with Castiel and he already knows the dude’s a grump when he wakes up. Still, he doesn’t try to be pleasant- he doesn’t want to. While Castiel might look all cute disgruntled, Dean still hasn’t forgiven him for purposely lying to him. A better person would have acknowledged Cas’s greeting, but Dean’s never been the better person and he ignores him.
Sam leans forward slightly and lowers his voice. “You promise you won’t tell Jess?” Dean nods. “It’s kind of big, that’s all.”
Chuck looks like he’s about to cry, so Dean calms down.
“Tell me where he is!” he screams, watching her hiss and wither on the ground. Ruby shakes her head, moving to the edge of the Devil’s Trap. Dean follows her, raising his knife to the girl’s throat.
He’s not sulking.
“I don’t know why you’re getting so mad,” Jo shrugs.
“My brother did. He found the name… amusing. I’d better head back I have an appointment with Sam later for lunch,” Castiel says as they make their way back to Cas’s apartment. He should know better, but the mention of Sam and Cas makes that smile disappear from Dean’s face.
The Harvelle Roadhouse Bar was the sort of the place where only the blue-collar regulars and drifters-who-would-never-visit-again came. Dean Winchester was the former. From his spot in the bar- the booths being the best seats in the house thanks to him knowing the owner, Ellen, personally- he could see the entirety of place clearly. The smell of smoke, despite the no-smoking laws, hanged heavily in the air, along with the drunken murmurs of travellers and the silence of the regulars.
“Um… I think that’s a bad idea.”
Dean shrugs, “well, do you?”
Castiel has tried to refrain from following his cousin’s moral guidelines, but lately money was tight and he wouldn’t mind picking up another paycheck or two. It wasn’t that the pie industry wasn’t flourishing. It is, but he wasn’t really sure what he was getting into when he started his business. He certainly wasn’t prepared for the amount of money he needed to keep it going (a sad fact considering he has a degree in accounting). It was exhausting trying to balance numbers and do all the baking himself. And while his business is small, he does have regular and consistent costumers, all of whom have been alarmingly loyal.
“Yeah, it turns the reason she’s been all secretive and super- nervous is because she has a husband. Best to leave before someone got hurt.”
fight his meal. He nods his head.
“Well, I’ve been hearing good things about the Jones collection, so we just had to see it,” Sam explains.
They stop at a green painted house in what looks like the middle of suburbia. It takes a moment before Castiel realizes that this is the Winchester’s old home.
“I’d hate to lose it. You have to hand it to your mom- it is the best spot in town.”
“Who are you?” Dean asks, his voice becoming increasingly hysterical. “How I am here?
“I haven’t been ignoring Cas. I’ve been busy.”
“Huh,” Sam states, which is all he’s got since that’s classic Dean behaviour- anytime he might be getting close to someone and he decides to destroy that relationship without considering the other party’s emotions. Sam’s not really sure what to say to Castiel.
Dean doesn’t mean to be rude, but he’s not sure how he’s suppose to tell Castiel that the reason they can’t hang out is because he gets a hard-on when he’s in the same room as Cas. It’s not just a boner, but a boner mixed with jealously because he knows that he
“So, you think I have no feelings?” Castiel says as they exit the museum.
“Looking good, Frankenstein,” Gabriel says, pushing into the room. Dean steps aside and opens the door so Castiel can enter.
The girl,
“Come on, Waffles,” Cas calls. The tiny dog looks up with tired eyes and slowly gets up.
Or least he did until Dean Winchester was standing before him, naked and with a gun pointed to his chest.
While Dean might pretend to cheer with the other guys and doesn’t do anything to interfere, he’s secretly likes the nebbish guy named Thomas, whose dark hair and blue eyes and inability to go through the day without getting his books dumped into the trash, replaces his fantasies of big-boobed models in his morning showers.
“Man, how did that happen?”
“Dean,” he snaps.
‘I’m mad because I don’t like that pseudo-intellectual type like Sam seems to. I mean to not like Eastwood! But Sam has always been a sucker for those types.”
Castiel’s voice is steadily getting louder- to the point that Dean can hear Castiel’s dog barking in the background.
“Cause you need me around so that you can justify that guy’s death? So you can convince yourself that what you’ve done is right? Sorry Cas, but all you did was bring back a high school drop- out with four bucks to his name. I’m a loser, Cas. I wasn’t worth saving.”
“Cas?” he mumbles. “Am I dead?”
Dean’s body is where Castiel has last seen him, although this time he’s completely covered by a sheet, a plastic box of personal items next to the body. This stops Castiel. He’s not sure how to proceed with this barrier.
“You still haven’t fixed her?”
“Since my doctor told my wife about my test results. What the hell are you eating?”
“Kind of big like you’re going to be arrested big? Like you lost your job? Did you lose your job? Is that why work has been so light for you?”
“Didn’t you hear her? She’s crazy! Talking about Hell and demons. We both know there’s no such thing. She wasn’t going to give us a straight answer, so why waste the time if I’m not getting my cash reward?”
“Cas,” he says again. “Do it.”
“Jerk,” Sam shoots back.
“That’s it? You just sell pies? Like real homemade pies?”
“Yeah, you need me to solve those murders-”
“Really? ‘Cause there seems to be a lot of evidence that suggests otherwise.”
“I’m sorry, but she was dead upon arrival,” Castiel hears the ambulance driver tell Dean.
Dean knew that lately his budget was getting tight, what with child support and the expenses he needed to fix his car, but he thought he had enough to not be living on beans for the next month.
“I resent the again,” Dean mumbles.
“I don’t know, how about the fact that when you introduced us, you said that he was your lover that we were talking about the other night.”
“Nah, Sam’s just in the high of his relationship. Once it cools, he’ll be back with Jess and everything will be fine again.”
Dean comes rushing over to Castiel, his face flushed and his eyes darting quickly around the room.
Of course, it all goes to shit.
“Probably the fact that
“If you find it so
It seems for Dean these changes are natural and they seem to happen at a rate that he barely notices. But for Castiel, these changes occur much too fast. They are signs that Dean will no longer be on Earth forever.
Ellen’s eyes also narrow when she looks at Sam and Dean can’t blame her for that either. Something about Sam is off this evening and it seems so obvious. Dean was certain Jess would notice and would comment on it. For the life of him, Dean couldn’t figure out what was bothering Sam. It couldn’t have been a case because Dean remembered his brother bragging about how relaxing work was at the moment (which was totally unfair as Dean was dealing with a high-stress writer currently and the return of subpar book series). It couldn’t have been Jess, because Jess and Sam were considered the perfect couple- almost nauseatingly so. They were seemingly All-American in how they met during college, and how they married shortly after Sam graduated from law school. They both worked well-paying jobs and were young, intelligent and well adjusted. Hell, Dean hadn’t even seen them fight once. Yet tonight, Sam was nervous and, despite the fact he was leading the conversation, distant.
dead,” Castiel coughs, taking a step forward. He stretches a hand out as if to touch Dean, like he wants to comfort him, but drops it last minute, shaking his head. “I have the ability to bring people back from the dead. Don’t ask me how. I don’t know. When I touch something that has recently died, I can bring them back.”
“You’re such a geek,” Dean tells his younger brother. With a taunting laugh only used by big brothers, he holds up the toy so that it is out of Sammy’s reach.
“Dean, it’s nice to meet you,” the man says with a surprising British accent.
“I thought he didn’t like me.”
Cas appears in his field of vision, a fond expression on his face. “Jack said he arrived early this morning. I didn’t know you had gotten a dog.”
"I can see why you like her," Cas said. "She's very…"
Dean almost laughs at the overly polite phrasing but manages to bite his tongue as he gingerly lifts the topmost four books, leaving Castiel to hold five more. The other man then proceeds to push them into the shelf, blindly holding out his hand afterwards in a request for Dean to hand over his share one book after another. Once everything is carefully stored Castiel visibly relaxes. Dean stays by his side and pretends to feel the same sense of achievement.
Usually Dean would have protested but the surprise of being manhandled had rendered him speechless. He just stared at Cas uselessly. The angel took his silence as an opportunity to continue talking.
"All I want to know is
As Dean put on a basically new red winter jacket he almost felt bad, knowing that the item would likely be ruined if it came to a direct confrontation with the spirit. Cas of course wasn’t affected by the cold but he too slipped on a dark parka instead of his trademark coat to keep up appearances.
“He believed in certain values. Like his work. He loved fixing cars and teaching Sam and me when we were kids. I was hooked but Sam never really got into it. The little nerd always asked me to drive him to the library, even on the damn weekends. When Dad found out Sammy wanted to apply for college rather than take up some blue collar job he was furious. Called it a waste of time and money, even though the kid’s a genius and got a full ride. The names he called us both, Sam for abandoning the family and me for not stopping him… I’ll never forget it. He died before Sam even graduated high school and I was relieved. How fucked up is that?”
, it doesn’t get better than that and it’s tragically underrated. So, in short, Dean is perfectly happy with the company he keeps. He doesn’t need his brother to play friendship matchmaker.
Dean can
"Let go of me or I’ll scream,” the girl threatened in an agitated whisper.
“Priapus took the bait, he’s after Cas. We’re in the corn maze.”
Dean nods.
browser history but as soon as he typed in his password a page came up that looked suspiciously like it was connected to what the angel was cooking together in the dungeon. The sigils matched and from what Dean gathered Cas had done a decent job with what he recognized as a locating spell. Seemingly, Cas was trying to find Metatron through his grace and he was pretty fucking determined, too.
“And tell him we lost the most powerful angel this side of the apocalypse
.” The sentence hangs unfinished in the air as Cas’s fingers come to life again. One hand moves from his cheek to card through Dean’s hair, short nails dragging over his scalp with torturous slowness like he did that night they never talk about. The other moves lower until Cas gently holds his chin in place with just his index finger, effectively trapping Dean’s gaze before he continues. “Sometimes you look at me, and I feel the same pull as I did from your soul all those years ago. That
The shrug his brother gave was answer enough even without his next words. “I know you. Also, you talk in your sleep.”
Cas lead the way as they were on the lookout for the main trail they had had left the day before. It didn't take them long to find it with the angel's trace of sigils still in place. Cas let them disappear one by one as they passed them.

So instead of pretending like he was none the wiser he got up and crossed the room, stopping a respectable distance away from where the angel was standing and leaning against the wall. “I can see something’s up with you,” he stated, keeping his voice as even and inoffensive as possible. “Wanna share with the class?”
“You left him in the
Castiel snorts but seems appeased as he unlocks the door and steps outside but he doesn't walk away before turning once more. "You've called me that before… "
. There’s no reason why that was somehow less awkward than it feels now standing a couple of feet apart in the kitchen like almost every damn day before.
The bookseller pushes past him, somehow managing to balance what he's holding while locking the shop's door and manually closing the blinds for the night. "In my kitchen," he explains. The

"I don't want '
“And now I’m back,” Cas reassures soothingly. His eyes catch Dean’s gaze for the briefest moment, aiming the words just as much at him.
"It doesn't make them any less true. You deserve to be happy, Dean. Realizing your own value is part of that."
“I was hoping you can, actually.” He fishes for the press ID in his jacket and flashes it her way just long enough for her to get a glimpse. “Name’s Jeff Lynne. I’m with the, ah, Cicero Tribune?”
“How can I not when someone I
"Oh, I must have forgotten it there after my shower when we came back from the farmers' market the other day. Thank you for finding it." A thoughtful expression crossed his face. "Was my red hoodie there too by any chance?"
“Wow, you definitely win that round. I’ll make sure to mention that in the article.” Dean says with as much bravado as she still finds within himself. He takes a few steps backwards. “Listen, I should really go—”
Dean’s eyes fell on the cast still fixed around his brother’s arm. “He run out of juice?” His intention had been to make a joke but the words came out concerned. A look at Sam told him he was spot on with the assumption. Damn.
Dean slowly transforms into a soccer mom and maybe possibly has some realizations about what he's feeling.
Dean throws up his arms in exasperation. “Because I couldn’t lose you! You’re human now, if anything happens to you then-”
Maybe that’s why he’d sent Cas to fetch him from Hell to begin with?
give Dean an apologetic shrug before grabbing himself a drink and dropping his tall frame into a chair at a neighboring table to enjoy the show. Next to him Eileen tries and fails to hide her amusement behind her wine glass while Donna and Jody take turns in yanking Dean’s hand around ‘to get a better look’. Across from him Cas remains conveniently unbothered, smiling serenely whenever Dean mouths ‘

“There we go,” Sam mumbles to himself, trying hard to focus on what
Charlie would’ve kicked your ass for what you just said.”
“Not just yet. I cannot speak for you, of course, but as it stands I’m having quite a good time with you like this.” Cas drags his eyes away from Dean’s face for the first time in what seems like forever, only for his gaze to travel shamelessly down the rest of Dean’s body. “You’re rather… compliant.”
as Sam likes to say. Dean is pretty sure he knows what that means and that it applies to his current situation.
"And you thought I'd blow your cover wide open by doing what exactly?"
He almost loses the easy smile on his face because how in the hell does she know his name? "Who's askin'?" he responds smoothly, ignoring the uneasy feeling.
They run a couple of laps around the counter, Jack squealing in delight while Sam continues to take half his normal strides to stay just behind. After the fourth round or so Dean steps in and sweeps Jack off his little feet, using the momentum to spin him around in a circle. The high-pitched
Dean knows fully well that he tends to rely on his appearance and natural charms a little too much if he has no one to reign him in and keep him on the right side of the border between being a flirt and being a douchebag, and usually his little brother Sam, and Jo, one of the siblings' oldest friends since childhood days, do a decent job with that. But ever since the two 'kids' went off to college and travel the world outside of their little Kansas hometown Dean is all on his own with his flirtations and more often than not he scares girls (and maybe the occasional guy, shuddup) off with his comings-on as of late. It's time Sammy and Jo got their asses home for spring break, basically. Until then, Dean will continue as it is even if he risks the odd drink splashed at him by an outraged girl that just can't appreciate his frankly really very smooth advances.
His brother sent him a look that clearly told him he didn’t want to spell things out but Dean left him no choice. “First the djinn case where you woke up gasping Cas’s name.” At Dean’s spooked expression Sam rolled his eyes. “Don’t look so betrayed, I let it go when you clearly didn’t wanna talk about it, didn’t I? Anyway. Then there was Excelsior, we both know how that would’ve gone down if I hadn’t shown up in time, not to mention that shifter that got away. And now you let yourself get jumped by stunt demon #327? Dean, something about what’s going on between you and Cas is distracting you and it’s making you a shitty hunter. Which really sucks because you’re the best damn hunter I know.”
