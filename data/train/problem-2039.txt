“Don’t be like that,” Greg says. “You’re making a great impression so far. Everyone knows your name.”
John doesn’t say anything, and Sherlock is standing, wide-eyed and unsure behind his violin. He swallows. “Then why?”
John sighs, looking away in frustration then turning back to the plant.  He glances at Sherlock, who makes a vaguely downward gesture with his hands, and John gives him a questioning look to which he rolls his eyes and looks away.  John sighs and kneels in the wet muddy ground, looking closely at the lower part of the plant.
Sherlock stops and looks at him sharply.  “If you followed her there, you couldn't have returned,” he says.
“You helped him come to terms with his death,” Sherlock surmises, and John nods. He takes another sip of his drink.
Sherlock smiles, lacing his fingers together and leaning his chin on them. He watches John with a tilted head. “I’d say you’ve changed more than just my eating habits, John. Give yourself some credit.”
Sherlock stops talking because John is suddenly clutching his arm. He looks away and closes his eyes, breathes, fights the nausea he feels when he thinks of the words he just spoke, and turns back. John is staring at him, and Sherlock’s heart is still pounding.
John’s face twists into disbelief. “Are you bloody serious? How lazy can you get? Have you even moved since yesterday?”
Sherlock carefully untucks John’s shirt, and then helps him out of it.   John’s not much use; his arms feel like jello and he’s still nauseous. He shivers, cold in just his undershirt, but Sherlock’s hands are warm on his shoulders as he pulls him forward a bit.
“Yes,” Sherlock says, then blinks a few times in confusion and looks up. “No, that is I –” He stops and clears his throat. “No, I haven’t eaten. Yes, I could do takeaway.”
Despite the lack of a clear path, Sherlock walks with confidence and determination, and John struggles to keep up with his long stride.
“Yeah, I do,” John says. “I used to be interested in her, actually,” he admits. “Romantically,” he specifies.
Sherlock shakes his head. “No,” he says. “It was…” He trails off, swallows, rubs his thumb over the rough edge of the menu. “Everyone’s magic felt very different to me. Mummy’s was… cold. Dad’s was orange and warm. It was… when they used it, I could feel the magic shift and move in the air, and I could detect the difference in movement between different spells.”
“No,” John replies, shaking his head. “I haven’t even meant to come in here,” he says. “I’ll just go.”
Sherlock nods, not sure he can speak, and John kisses him again, then turns around and starts towards Sherlock’s bedroom, and Sherlock follows eagerly. Once they’re inside, though, Sherlock looks at John, unsure, and John drops his hand, closes the door, then turns to him. He steps close and kisses him again, but this time it’s different. This time, Sherlock is pressed against the door, John’s body flush against his, and John’s hand soothes over his side and then tugs Sherlock’s shirt free of his trousers.   And then, miraculously, John’s hand slides under the edge of his shirt to press bare against the small of Sherlock’s back, and Sherlock gasps and kisses John desperately, eager for more of this feeling, of John’s hands in places they’ve never been.
section is hushed and tender, and he thinks of John’s hands and John’s smile and John’s body pressed against his as the final note drifts into the quiet of 221B and dissolves into the air, into the fabric of their life together, until the note has disappeared and the quiet of the flat is all that’s left – but this time, it’s the quiet of a promise fulfilled, of new promises waiting.
“Teach me again,” John says. His voice is quiet but strong, and Sherlock looks up sharply, sure he must be mishearing. “Please,” John adds.
John stands up to get her and Sherlock remains motionless, doing nothing but breathing, his skin on fire everywhere John’s lips touched him. He looks up after a moment and John’s looking at him, smiling softly as he bounces Iris up and down soothingly. He presses a kiss to her temple, and Sherlock feels a twinge in his chest at the thought that he now knows the feeling of those lips on his skin, too.
“Why don’t you stay here with Billy, then?” John asks Redbeard, holding his hand out and urging Redbeard towards the skull.
“Hello, Mary,” he says as they approach. He’s just wondering whether he should give her a hug in greeting when she waves, making him stop before he can go through with the hug.
John hadn’t understood Sherlock when he’d lived with him the first time, not really. There were times he felt he came close, but Sherlock always managed to surprise him. This time around, though, his understanding of Sherlock is elusive at best. Sometimes, things feel normal – Sherlock shouts at crap telly while John watches him in amusement; Sherlock leaves things for Mrs. Hudson to clean up and complain about.
John rolls his eyes and lets Redbeard scurry up his arm. “Yeah, yeah, world of difference. For you, too; now you actually eat. I’m not sure you even knew you had a refrigerator before I moved in here.”
“No, I suppose not,” Sherlock admits. His voice is gentle and soft and so caring that John feels devastated somehow, though he doesn’t understand why. “Lie down, John. You need rest.”
Sherlock’s hips jerk upwards; he can’t help it. John holds him by the hip to keep him down with one hand while the other stays on his cock, and Sherlock’s heart beats faster and he moans again, so loud that he’s shocked by the sound, and he spares a thought for Mrs. Hudson but then John starts moving faster and he’s moaning again, helpless.  His legs are twitching, he’s panting, and his entire being is reduced to the warm heat of John around his cock.  It’s like nothing he’s ever felt; he’s afraid he’s going to come already and it’s only just begun.
Mycroft gives a clearly insincere twist of his lips that’s meant to be a smile.  “Certainly,” he says, ever polite.  “Sherlock was panicking.  He was digging in the mud with his bare hands, trying to get to you, knowing the whole time it was fruitless and that he couldn’t get to you from the physical realm.”
“Well, I’ve been damn curious myself, for one thing,” he replies. “Everybody’s talking about you; I had to meet you for myself.”
He gets to the top of the stairs feeling impatience building inside him, and when he opens the door to 221B, Sherlock is lounging on the couch again, smoking his pipe, which does nothing to improve John’s mood.
Today, though, he’s been quite lucky on his walk home from work.  There haven’t been any spirits so far, and so he’s feeling unaccountably cheery – that is, until a strange man suddenly steps in front of him, holding his hand in front of John in a ‘stop’ gesture.
He’d been too absorbed in the music to truly take it in, but when he revisits it in his mind, his eyes suddenly fly open and he pushes the thought away because it looks too much for him to bear like the things he locks away deep inside, and he stands up, pacing back and forth for a moment.
“There’s a bedroom upstairs, if you’ll be needing it, then,” Mrs. Hudson says, her eyes dancing with mirth.
Sherlock rolls his eyes.  “Yes,” he says.  “And since certain…beings feel the need to create an environment as unseemly as their personalities, we’ll take a shortcut to avoid the rain,” he adds, giving Mycroft a dirty look.  “Come, John,” he says, standing up and heading towards his bedroom.
John trudges down the stairs in his socked feet one morning, covering a yawn with his hand. He hears Sherlock moving around in the kitchen and he wearily scrubs a hand over his face. He doesn’t have the energy to fight Sherlock and his experiments for kitchen space, but he knows it’s inevitable.
Arthur is quiet for a moment, and the sounds of the park seem distant to John, far from the little bubble he’s in with Arthur where his words echo over and over in his ears. Arthur pats his arm and leaves his hand there. “And now?” he asks.
“Sherlock,” Mummy says, her voice shaky in a way Sherlock doesn’t understand. “Do that again, darling?”
Mycroft, dressed impeccably in a three-piece suit and without a hair on his head out of place, looks at him in dismay. “Sneaking off to the kitchens already, Sherlock?”
John frowns for a moment, feeling somehow like his next words are important, and he considers them carefully. When he thinks of how confined his life is, how he can barely leave his home, how everything is so dull and he’s constantly chased by things most of the world doesn’t even believe exist, and then he thinks of how
Sherlock shrugs, one corner of his mouth quirking upwards. “You never used to have so much grey hair,” he says without thinking.
He plays through the slow movements, and while they’re not perfect, they’re much closer to Mozart than they are to noise this time around. Impatiently, he pulls out some of his favorite Bach sonatas, and plays through them, too, covering John’s recently acquired stack of paperbacks with his discarded sheet music each time he grabs a new piece.
“Stay in this building?” John says incredulously. “Is he hiding under the kitchen table, then? Hmm? Should I be looking under the bloody
“John! Sherlock!  This is unexpected,” Mary says as she opens her door with a smile.  It turns to a confused frown as her eyes settle on Mycroft.  “Is everything alright?”
Mary laughs. It’s a light and delicate flutter of sound against the quiet of the clinic’s break room, almost the exact opposite of the rich, dark chuckle John’s accustomed to hearing at home. “And does this one talk, too, like the skull?” she asks, head tilted and a playful smile on her lips.
Mycroft smiled as he removed his phone from his breast pocket. “I'll have the car come around again.”In a few moments, the pair were in the vehicle, headed towards the shouted address of 221B Baker Street. John, unnervingly still, was 	quiet, but his eyes moved quickly back and forth across the streets they passed.
“I’m afraid it is,” George said, continuing on. “I know you thought he was dead – so did we all – but that doesn’t seem to be the case. You know as well as I do that these deaths have been suspiciously organized, and whatever organization responsible for them would inevitably attract Tom, and others of his breed.”
Mycroft, who had until that point been consumed by the notion of drinking from John, had managed to ignore the movement of the man beneath him, but what he said made him pause for a moment – long enough to notice a certain darkness at the edges of his vision. Pulling himself a few centimetres away from the shorter man's neck, he was struck by a sudden powerlessness that ran through him from head to toe. Backing away and no longer holding on to John, he nearly stumbled, looking at the man before him with an expression of confusion. John stepped forward as Mycroft faltered and fell to his knees, his fangs retracting and the pupils of his eyes blowing wide.
John shook his head. “No. He wasn't leading the murders, though I'm sure he enjoyed the mayhem. He's always been more of a henchman. We'll need help.”
“Your brother made me promise not to,” John replied, hands raised in a gesture of surrender. “It didn’t seem relevant.”
This time John thought of Sherlock. He thought of the way Sherlock looked at him over his microscope. He thought of his laugh and his smile, the smile no one else saw – the one Sherlock got when he figured something important out and he wasn't sure how to tell him. John thought of Sherlock’s hands, the curve of his lips, the way he yawned. And he thought, more than anything, how much he’d miss him. John thought of the way people would tell Sherlock how much John loved him, and how Sherlock would never really believe it. He imagined Sherlock retreating, living in his mind palace, and returning to the man he was before they met: cold, occasionally cruel, and confident that he, if nothing else, was absolutely unloved.
A malicious smile tugged at Sebastian’s cheek, eager to continue their fight, but John was no longer in a smiling mood. Or a conversant one, for that matter. Immediately landing a punch on Sebastian’s chest, he fought viciously, moving forward aggressively. Without Moriarty’s blood, the battle would have been lost for Sebastian immediately. As it was, he held out for five minutes, the battle around them slowly coming to a close, until John was finally able to land a well-angled kick towards Sebastian’s shin, breaking the bone and causing the other man to fall on to his back. John fell with him, and with one motion, held Sebastian down by the neck.
Soon, they reached a corridor, this one far from the central line of vaults they had been following, and Sherlock stopped. “I think it’s through that wall, then north.”
John surveyed the rest of the fighting that covered the courtyard. Tempting though it was, he couldn’t fight hand in hand with his men as he usually would. He had to get back into command mode.
“If it were a matter of putting me in a dangerous area, you wouldn't mention it; putting one another in dangerous situations is rather what we do. It has to be something else, something related to my humanity explicitly. So, what is it?”
“Thought the phones might be tapped,” Gabriel said with a shrug. “Better late than never. Lieutenant Gabe Richter. Nice to meet you.”
Sherlock paused, and quickly ran through his memories of the night before: checking in, reviewing notes, John’s lips on his skin – no, best not to think on that too long – the club, sweat, smoke... and the vampire with notes in his pocket.
“No,” Sherlock agreed. “Though I am intrigued. Was it fixed by your network?” He said, emphasizing the last word with a bit of bitterness. He still felt left in the dark.
“To put the thought of the undead in the consciousness of society.” John leaned back and moved his hands as he spoke. “The best defence against vampires has always been knowledge, and knowing how to protect yourself. Once the threat of the undead reached England, it was agreed that the country, those the hunters had vowed to protect, had to at least know what would be coming for them. They assumed, rightly so, that as the world grew and people spread out, the vampires would as well, and areas that once were free of the undead – like England – would soon have more than it could handle. They also agreed that this would mean a new manner of hunting would be necessary. One that focused not on hunting all vampires, but those who seemed intent on causing destruction and death. It was Abraham's personal belief that, as time wore on, a balance could be struck, and humans and vampires could live in peace.”
Mycroft shook his head. “The pair of you need your rest.” He didn’t speak for himself, though he could feel the tell-tale tremble in his knees that suggested they may buckle at any moment.
“Run!” Mycroft shouted, louder this time. He fell to the ground, his fangs bared. He clasped his head between his hands as a blinding pain overtook him. Through his blurred vision, he saw Lestrade turn around once more, pausing momentarily by the entrance to the warehouse. Molly pulled him out, and with a loud slam the door was locked.
“Someone's planning ahead,”John said, and walked back towards the body, turning it over hesitantly, trying not to get any more of the blood on him. Sherlock walked around to the other side and knelt down. “Sending a vampire to wait for us at the morgue,”he said, “That seems bad.”
Across the road, John saw one of his higher ranking officers, Gabriel, moving quickly against two vampires to try and subdue them. John, coming around from behind, pulled one of the other man’s stakes from his belt and lunged at the stronger of the two vampires. Now evenly matched, the vampires struggled to fight against John and his colleague. As they backed the pair towards a fenced-in outbuilding, John glanced quickly at Gabriel.
“We’ve been attacked by a dozen vampires in the last week, we’re about to go to what will probably be our deaths, and that’s what you’re concerned about?” John said in between deep breaths of air.
John finally smiled. “Fair enough. Want something to drink? For a bar that caters to people that can't consume alcohol, the vampires around here do tend to make a good whisky sour.”
Harker turned back to his desk and rifled through papers. Sherlock spotted names and addresses, and a great number of photographs of various warehouses and symbols. Finally, Harker pulled a thin, bone-handled knife from under a pile of notebooks.
“There's going to be a murder tonight? How do you know?” Lestrade stood quickly, mouth agape as he stood up and walked towards John. Sherlock moved around the table, also coming close to the doctor, who took a step backwards as he lowered the crossbow.
The place that Mycroft had taken him was an office, but not one of the many that he had been brought to prior, on the occasions that the Holmes decided to kidnap him for a cup of tea. It was by far the largest of the rooms that John had been taken to, panelled in wood, with its rich crimson walls hung with art.  He wouldn't have been surprised if it actually belonged to Mycroft, rather than one of his employees.
Mycroft took the mobile back, and began typing almost immediately. He passed Greg the phone once more.
“So, make me blend in,” Sherlock replied. “Wait,” he said, holding up a hand before John could speak. “I don't know why it didn't occur to me sooner, it's completely straightforward. The club is for vampires and mates. Clearly you need to-”
“I suppose it’s a good sign you can’t find him. Maybe it means he found who he was looking for, and they disposed of his phone. Whoever ‘they’ are,” John added.  “Nothing’s coming up at all?”
“Indeed,” George replied. “Though not all vampires as old as me are as active. Many stay hidden, in crypts or in the shadows, feeding only when necessary. There is a certain standard of vampire, the old standard, which still hides in crumbling castles in faraway lands and inaccessible mountains. Such was the type that sought Mycroft Holmes while I did.
After he had made himself breakfast, John began to gather the work they had done on the case into a box, and sipped his tea while he looked at his miserable friend. He wasn't pleased to be off the case, but he wasn't taking it the way that Sherlock was. To Sherlock, it wasn't just a project, or a mystery to be solved – it was
With pride, Harker walked through the aisles between graves and surveyed his creations, hands behind his back as they staggered upright onto more solid ground. “To attention,” he said, softly, and all fifty vampires immediately straightened up and locked eyes on their maker. “Very good.”
John gestured at the three newcomers before them. “This is George, one of the heads of the Council. He’s controls vampire affairs in Central Europe. Caroline, she’s his right hand, and Charles; he served for a few years in Afghanistan with me. Two vampires and a human,” he said. As an afterthought, he added, “Well, a very old human, I mean. George’s mate. How old are you, now, Charles?”
“Smells like rotting flesh,” John said, face screwed up in a frown. “We’re veering directly into not-good-very-bad territory.”
Lestrade tilted his head as he considered this, and Sherlock finally spoke, a wry smile on his lips. “In this comparison, you’re the Queen?”
“Nah,” John replied, knowing what his friend was considering. “Too many tourists. Too open. Would be a neat place to turn someone, though. There’s something to be said for using places of societal significance to turn someone. Beyond plain old hallowed ground, I mean,” he added, glancing over at Sherlock.
Sherlock received a laugh, and felt a bit of the concern that was growing at the edges of his consciousness abate.
“I'm getting dinner,” John said, pulling the zip of his coat up. “Try not to shoot anything while I'm gone.”
“I’ll take care of him,” John said, ducking as a vampire swinging a blade passed by him. “Go - you’re the only one who can keep up with him.”
John smiled and the group said their goodbyes, and in short order the train pulled into the station. As Molly promised, they were greeted by several grim-looking men who worked efficiently and quietly, and assured them that their luggage would beat them to the hotel. Lestrade took Molly’s suggestion and headed towards the nearest police station. He was sure they wouldn’t have the same resources as the Met - probably wouldn’t even understand what he was doing in town - but he wanted them to be aware that a potential murderer could be nearby all the same.
“I was your first arrest,” she said, smiling at the memory. “Brixton, ninety-five. You swore you couldn't see me in the mirrors of your car. You were right,” she said with a grin.
“Figures,” John said, chuckling spiritlessly. “The one time he should continue ignoring you, and he doesn't. He probably sensed that you were dangerous. He seems to have that instinct. As to your question, who knows? The same could be said for other things - why garlic?”
John was quickly beginning to realize that without Mycroft’s help, it was getting harder and harder to stay ahead of the attacking horde. As though on cue, two more young vampires reached John, and though he was quick in wrapping the hand of one of them in silver chain, he was unable to stop the other from capturing his own arm. One-handed, he attempted to kick at the vampire in front of him, but was slowly brought to the ground as the crowd surrounded him, his only vision in the dim room a sea of shining white fangs. To John’s horror, he saw Harker, sleeves now rolled up, stalking through the crowd of his creations directly towards him. Distantly, he heard an exclamation of pain from Sherlock, and soon saw the other man pinned down a few meters away.
“What the hell happened here?” He asked, training his weapon on the vampire in front of him as he took calm, measured steps forward. The vampires bared their fangs as they looked for an escape from the path they were being led on.
“We're going to see a friend of mine, from the military,” John said, suddenly reminded of giving orders and explaining plans so many years ago. It didn't feel very different. “I've mentioned this to Sherlock. I have the address to the bar we're meeting at, and hopefully whatever she tells me will help us figure out what we're going to do next. Obviously this is time sensitive so we're going to try and move as safely and quickly as we can. I've packed enough weapons for all of us, and I'm counting on all of you to shoot quickly and with relatively good aim. Any questions?”
When Mycroft came to, he became aware of a dull throbbing in his head. For the first time since being turned, he could feel pain. Excruciating pain, the sort of which cut beyond flesh. Daring to open one of the eyes he had been keeping pressed shut, he looked down towards the source of pain. Around either wrist, tied to the armrests of the chair he was now sitting in, were thin chains that seemed to radiate heat. As the fog in his head cleared, they came into focus.
Sighing, John put his hands on his hips and glanced across everything he had strewn across the bed. He’d faced worse odds, but usually had the benefit of more information. Sherlock chose that moment to come in, and started unfolding the two maps he had just printed, laying them out on the double bed that wasn’t presently covered in weapons.
“Greg,” Molly murmured. “These are headstones.” She ran her hand over the surface of the stone, removing some of the dust. The names etched in it were too faded to read in the low level of light.
The remaining fighters began hauling up what was left of the still-living, though severely injured, vampires. Assuming the rest of the military would arrive over the coming days, they would be able to relocate the newborns until Harker could be found and destroyed. He had enough faith in his soldiers that they would find a safe place to keep them in the meantime. Lines of former officers, his friends, filed out of the room, greeting John as they went - some hadn’t even managed to say hello over the course of the battle, merely getting on with their work as directed. John nodded at each of them in turn, aware of their sacrifice. He didn’t want to imagine the mess all of these bodies would cause the Council.
“Jesus, these are old,” Lestrade said as he kneeled down, tapping at the corner of the largest marble slab.
“Shit,” John said, looking at Sherlock, who had abandoned his maps and walked over to the phone. “She’s right. That really does make perfect sense. Of course he’d find a way to screw with us.”
Sherlock walked over and looked at the marks on the map, eventually perching himself on the edge of a chair to analyze it further. John sat down as well and pretended to thumb through a magazine, watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eye.
“Arturo,” John said, pointing at him as he spoke to Sherlock. “One of the vampires who signed up for the Corps in its earliest days.”
“Hasn’t been a total loss,” Sebastian drawled. “We can create vampires that are perfect soldiers - they obey, they kill, they’re disposal.”
“If only you knew,” John muttered. “Just tell me you do grasp the seriousness of this, right? You'll be a bit tired and off-balance for a while. Your neck will ache and until we're out of the club, you'll look fairly seriously bruised. And that's all assuming I don't accidentally sever anything vital.”
Just as the figure reached him, a knife sliced through the air, and just as soon as it had come, the vampire lay unmoving on the pavement. With his toe, John pushed it on to its back, and Lestrade let out a groan as the twisted face rolled to face the group. Its neck, nearly severed, let out a steady river of old blood, pooling around John's feet.
“The light’s better here,” Sherlock answered. John glanced around - the room was entirely in shade. Sherlock, dressed in a fresh suit, seemed as though he had been awake for hours.
The man walked across the room directly to a set of glasses and decanters, pouring himself a glass of whiskey and swirling it as he returned to the centre of the room. John imagined Mycroft had poured it out of habit; it was very likely that he was not used to being unable to consume anything other than blood. That, or Mycroft assumed that John didn't know what was going on. At times John appreciated the relative anonymity the Watson surname afforded him.
“Speaking of,” John said, muttering. He turned to the side, exhaled slowly, and with a click the fangs retracted. He turned back to the group, taking a step forward. “Sorry. It's harder to control under stress.”Coming within a few feet of Lestrade, he noticed the detective inspector flinch, and immediately backed away.
“Sherlock?” John called, keeping his eyes on the vampires in front of him as he backed away. “In my coat, I’ve got some silver chains and some stakes, could you pass them over?” Sherlock did as asked, looping around the room towards John and handing off a few lengths of chain. This done, he moved towards Greg and gingerly moved the DI back towards the wall, and settled him down in one of the alcoves. He was, fortunately, still breathing, but clearly wouldn’t be much help fighting.
Sherlock leaned down to kiss John softly. John laughed and pulled away from Sherlock, running the pad of his thumb across his flatmate’s lower lip.
Sherlock still hadn't taken his seat, and looked down at Lestrade as he spoke, his mind already trying to put the pieces together. “The hospital? Why?”
Sherlock glanced over at Greg, who had finally given in to unconsciousness; he wondered how hard the DI had been hit. He tried to rush Moriarty’s monologuing along.  “And the third, fairy dust?”
“You're an awful shot,” John said, glancing at the third jar to break, and wondering what kind of flowers he should buy Mrs. Hudson this time around as an apology.
John, looking directly at his friend at that moment, was imagining Sherlock without more than half of his blood. Would he be any paler then, more than he was now, bathed under the fluorescent light of the kitchen? He shook his head, clearing away the image. He had obviously spent too much time staring at crime scene photographs.
On looking at the crowd, he realized that he recognized nearly everyone in the vault as a close friend. He hadn’t expected so many had left the army; more than that, he hadn’t expected so many would come to his aid. A gloved vampire, tall and lithe, moved quickly among the newborns, tagging them with silver bands when possible in order to distract them.
Although John had kept him out of the bulk of the action, Lestrade had still attracted the attention of some outliers who couldn’t resist the scent of fresh blood. Eyes too puffy to see, and arms too injured to move, he wasn’t quite sure how he was going to fight back.  He managed to stand and start backing towards the entrance of the vault. Just as the vampire ahead of him bared its fangs, a projectile Lestrade could later only describe as a Molotov cocktail whizzed past his head and struck the vampire at center mass. An ear-piercing screech emitted from the creature as a hole burned deeply into its chest. As quickly as he was hit, the vampire deteriorated into a burst of ash and dark blood onto the floor of the cavern.
“It’s only nine. Food?” John said, petulantly trying to pull on the covers that were pinning him down from under Sherlock.
Once all of Jane’s list had been entered, and the group could no longer put off discussing the next step, Greg and Molly looked to Mycroft, who had assumed the role of leader without needing to say anything. He stood, and pulled his handkerchief away, concealing it in his fist.
“You said it, while you were sleeping.” Sherlock was clearly not really looking at the slide underneath the microscope.
Sherlock smoothed out both maps, and placed them side by side. “Mycroft has come in handy, for once,” he said, exhilarated.
Greg made a quiet noise of disagreement. “I don’t mean to point out the obvious here - god knows I’m the most confused person in this train car - but, John, it seems pretty clear. Tom and Sebastian were clearly working together then, and Tom was involved in the murders now. Seems pretty clear they’re linked.”
John sighed, shook his head, and reached for the pen he had put down, uncapping it as he leaned back in his chair. “I had a colleague of mine at the hospital remove the clothes and what was left of the body. I've been told it just looks like someone dropped a bag of blood. Not great, but it won't raise as many questions as a vampire corpse. So, that's one sorted. I think Molly's finally fallen asleep, too – I talked to her a bit, explained vampires and the murders, and the war, that whole story.”
“How are we getting there?” Lestrade asked, slightly more concerned with the legal side of their activities.
With those words, John ceased to remain still, and began walking towards Thomas. “No.” Another muted click could be heard as John, with his back facing Sherlock, Mycroft, and Lestrade, walked towards the vampire. Thomas, head bent, walked forward, keeping enough distance between himself and John to watch the doctor's movements.
,' John thought to himself. He could almost feel his brain rewiring itself  as it tried to acknowledge that fact. Barring anything spectacular, someone – or something – had killed Mycroft Holmes. He still walked and, presumably, spoke, the way he had in life, but he was no longer alive; he was something else completely. He was a vampire. '
“Jesus Christ,” John said, laughing. He ran a hand through his sandy hair, leaving flecks of blood in it. “Well, as long as you can still talk.”He put a hand over Sherlock's on the cloth and lifted it up, noting the blood slowing. “I'll use some of my blood on those marks later. By morning you won't even notice them.”
“Stand still, stay behind Mycroft, do not move,” John instructed, speaking to the three men through gritted teeth. No one spoke as he took his gun from Mrcroft and handed it to Sherlock. “It will buy you time. Lestrade, take out yours.” He turned, and looked around himself as he stepped forward, and the group, silent mostly out of shock, stayed where they were. Neither Sherlock or Lestrade questioned John, who had taken on an intensity they had never before seen in him. Looking from his left to right as he walked forward, John could feel eyes in the darkness watching him. He stopped in the middle of the road and stood still. Mycroft was immediately reminded of the way the man must have looked in his days as a soldier.
Sherlock is four years old, and it’s the first time he’s used magic. Unlike most children, it’s not accidental.
, the wish granter of all the worlds. For that reason, you can’t see my shop, and of course, can’t enter it. You have no need for it because at present, every single one of your wishes goes back to the core of your being, which is unchangeable, as you know.”
“Didn’t realize it’d affect you like that,” John says, still stroking his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “Should have.”
“That’s good,” Arthur says, shaking John out of his thoughts. His voice is gentle, and John looks up at him, a tentative smile on his face. He feels close to Arthur after having such a personal conversation with him; he rarely has them with
“Ticklish?” Sherlock asks, raising his eyes to John’s in amusement, his fingers just shy of the sensitive skin of John’s neck.
They say the words at the same time, John questioning the validity of his presence with a heavy, wrinkled brow, and Sherlock assuring him his presence is vital with a small smile, and then Sherlock turns away for a moment, a small smile curling on his lips, as John does the same. Something unclenches in Sherlock’s heart that he hadn’t known was clenched, and he forces his face to fall back into a more neutral expression as he goes to the door and pulls it open, holding it for John. He sneaks through with Iris and gives him a tight smile as he passes.
. I can give them things you never will; I can give them people to torment, games to play, whatever they want. Do you really think they’d come in here and attack
John’s brows rise up, nearly to his hairline, and he almost spits out his tea, but instead, he chokes. He coughs for a moment and then hurriedly sips again to clear his throat. “Er –
“It took you long enough,” Sherlock says.  There’s an edge to his voice, but his eyes are searching John’s form frantically as if he’s worried.  He glances at John’s hand, and his breath catches.  He reaches down and disengages John’s hand from the skeleton as if one second more of being attached would mean destruction, and John lets him, too tired to do anything but watch with a small, fond, sad smile.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose. “Yeah, but it’s a big black stain on your magic, don’t you want it gone? You don’t need that, your magic is nice, John.”
John shrugs, something in his chest twisting. “It’s alright,” he says. He’s torn between a strange relief at Mary’s empathy, and anger at Sherlock for being so flippant about this part of John that, up until recently, has been a closely guarded secret.
. Something about the way the bulky sleeves of John’s oversized pajama shirt bunch up at her elbows, where John’s pushed them up and out of the way, something about the way the soft fabric is worn and loved, makes Sherlock think of comfort, of home, makes her heart feel as if it’s bursting. And something about the way the sunlight from the window falls on the planes of John’s face, dipping into the laugh lines around her eyes, caressing the delicate swoop of her nose, makes Sherlock’s stomach clench, makes her think of John at night, of the streetlight from outside filtering into their bedroom, dipping into the gentle curve of her breasts, disappearing between them, curling around her delicate collar bones.
The man frowns. He doesn’t seem to know what to make of Sherlock’s words, and neither does John. “If I figure it out, will my hand get better?”
“This appears to be in order, thank you,” Sherlock says dismissively. He takes the money he’d prepared in advance out of his pocket and passes it over to Mike, then turns back to his ingredients, waving a dismissive hand in his guests’ direction. “I’m sure you can see yourself out,” he adds when Mike doesn’t move.
When John comes out of the shower, freshly shaved and washed and dressed in new pajamas, he finally feels a bit more clear-headed and like himself. He leans against the doorway to the living room, watching as Sherlock scoops fried rice onto a plate, already laden with John’s other favorites. It smells heavenly; John’s mouth waters as he watches, but he can’t bring himself to walk through the door. He feels as if all of this will disappear if he so much as breathes wrong after everything they’ve been through the past few days.
As soon as he steps onto the roof, though, he stops short. Goosebumps break out over his skin and his eyes widen when he sees that a gray-haired man is standing on his roof smoking a cigarette, staring out over the London night sky as if there’s nothing unusual about his presence on a stranger’s roof. The man turns and seems just as startled to see John as John is to see him, and he hastily tosses his cigarette down, putting it out with the toe of his shoe.
Quickly, John reaches out and grabs them, reflexes on high alert in his state of alarm, and he hands them back to the boy, his eyes not straying from the large ears growing out of the boy’s head.
“I’ve barely touched it,” Mycroft says, but he doesn’t tighten it any further, just tugs on Sherlock’s jacket once more while Sherlock fidgets.
John’s vision blurs for a moment, and he feels dizzy. The pain in his head is overwhelming in its intensity, but he forces himself to stay focused, imagining Sherlock, remembering why he’s here. “No,” he says. “Of course not.” He speaks confidently, but he feels himself growing weaker; he knows he can’t hold onto the connection for much longer.
He’s panicking now, he knows, but he can’t help it. He lightly slaps the side of her face, but she has no reaction. He pries her eyelids open, but her pupils don't even twitch. A desperate sob rises in his throat, but again, he swallows it down. He takes the folded blanket off the end of her bed and carefully, tenderly lays it over her, tucking it around her shoulders, his breath hitching. He stares at her a moment, his palms clammy, his heart pounding, and then he leaves her apartment. He barely sees what’s around him as he goes; the world is spinning and he feels doubtful that his legs will hold him up.
, and John’s mouth is open beneath him and they’re sharing breaths and mouths and it’s too much, it really is, and he pulls away for a moment, his heart pounding.
John thinks of all they’ve been through, and all that lies ahead of them. He thinks of everything Sherlock’s done for him, and everything he’s done in return. He thinks of the fear and desperation he’d felt when Sherlock was gone, of the relief that crashed into him when he found Sherlock once more. He thinks of how it all swirls together into what he feels for Sherlock, an emotion that can’t be encompassed by a single word or experience or even universe.
John’s finishing the last of his paperwork after a long shift at the clinic. The afternoon sun floods his office with bright light, and it feels promising somehow. Things have been looking up for him lately, and he’s grateful, though he’s a bit tired due to his increasingly frequent nighttime visits with Greg. He always looks forward to them, though, because Greg continues to provide him rare insights into Sherlock’s life that never fail to intrigue him. He thinks he and Sherlock are growing closer as a result, and on top of that, the spirits haven’t followed him in what feels like forever.
When the light changes, his body jolts into action, carrying him across the street before he’d even consciously decided to do so, and then he’s there, standing opposite John.
John’s smile widens, and another bird nuzzles into John’s neck. Sherlock’s face flushes again, and it feels like the air between them is changing, charging, in ways he doesn't understand.
“That’s a bit rude, mate,” Billy says from the table. If skulls could frown, John is quite sure Billy would be frowning.
Sherlock picks up his violin the next day, and as usual, it feels clumsy and unnatural, but as he plays, his hand loosens and his fingers stretch across the strings more easily and it starts to feel a little bit more like an extension of his arms rather than something with which to weigh them down.
“They’re important,” Sherlock says softly. He’s still looking at John like he’s a treasure, and John looks away, pleased.
Suddenly, Sherlock stops, cocking his head to the side and listening intently. Mrs. Hudson and Billy suddenly become quite attentive and watch him carefully, and John looks between the three of them, unsure.
He’s half expecting something elaborate like a puff of smoke or a loud bang or even a rush of glitter or confetti, but what he gets instead is a small squeak, almost like the sound of a mouse. He frowns and peers into the longer end of the tube, and then jumps back when he sees small eyes looking back at him.
“Oh,” John says after a moment. There’s a small smile in the corners of his eyes, a brightness to them that Sherlock can hardly stand. “Well, that’s alright, then,” John says, and he’s still smiling up at him in a peculiar way, and it has such an effect on Sherlock that a few butterflies spontaneously form behind John’s back. Sherlock flushes, grateful John didn’t witness that rare display of spontaneous magic (he’d refuse to label it
But John isn’t there. He blinks, staring at the space where John had been, and then he swivels, turning towards the door. There’s still a puddle where John’s umbrella had dripped, but the umbrella is gone, and so is John.
“I thought of you every day while I was gone, John, and all I could think of was how happy you’d be when I came home to you, but you moved on, and it was foolish of me to ever think it would be any different. I knew we could never go back to how we were, and Mary made you happy in ways I couldn’t, so I did what I could for the two of you, but I was wrong again; I should’ve seen Mary for what she was, and I didn’t because I wanted so much for you to be happy.” He ignores the way John tenses at the topic of conversation because he needs to keep going; this may be his last chance, after all.
Exactly nineteen minutes later finds John and a now suit-clad Sherlock standing in the living room, dinner having been hastily cleared away by John as Sherlock changed into proper clothes. Redbeard is watching them from beside Billy; Sherlock has said Redbeard can’t come, and Redbeard seems sulky, if the way his tail lethargically swishes back and forth is anything to go by, but Billy is occasionally murmuring to him, and Redbeard’s head is pressed against Billy’s jaw. John feels surprisingly lonely without the little creature wrapped around him.
“It’s best not to stay here for too long,” Sherlock says in an almost apologetic tone when he notices John’s quick pace.
John snorts as he rotates his bad shoulder a bit; it has been stiff all day. “I don’t think so, but it might do, knowing Sherlock.”
“Yeah, exactly why I was giving it to Mary,” John says.  He sits beside Sherlock, holding the bag in his hands and looking at it in irritation.
Sherlock shakes his head frantically, breath still fast. John wonders if Sherlock’s about to have a panic attack and he wishes the stupid git would just sit
“I guess so,” John says. He hesitates, but decides to change the subject. “Anyway, you never answered. Why are you here?”
Sherlock turns over abruptly, staring at Mycroft in accusation. “You’re the one who told me, Mycroft! When you eliminate the impossible, whatever’s left, even if it’s improbable, must be true.”
John hesitates, then brings his free hand up again, strokes his thumb over Sherlock’s cheekbone once more. “Is this really alright?” he asks, voice quiet.
John laughs at the unexpected response and the memory, leaning against Sherlock and chuckling, and Sherlock smiles, his hands twisting into John’s shirt, pulling him flush against him.
“Mm, love - love you,” John says, his words punctuated by a gasp, tightening his fingers in Sherlock’s hair again.
“John,” Sherlock replies. He didn’t mean for it to be such a useless reply, but it came out before he could stop himself, and he winces.
“My wish was for you to live, and I’m currently paying for it, so it can’t be broken. Wishes aren’t like ill-fitting clothes, John. Once they’re granted and paid for, that’s that. You can’t return them,” Sherlock says. “I can’t kill you because I wished for your life. Moriarty can’t kill you because he received payment for my wish. You can still die, but not by my hand or his directly.”
John’s jaw drops a little bit. “Well, yes, I suppose,” he says, thinking of how often the cooking and cleaning are left to
Sherlock blinks, realizing that he’s stolen John’s wand out of his hand, and looks down at it, feeling the familiar rush of John’s magic in his hand. He swallows, a little calmer from the warmth of it, and quietly hands it back to John, but won’t look at him.
“How do you know my name?” John asks suspiciously. His arms are still crossed over his chest, but some of the stiffness of his spine has settled.
John’s not sure what to make of that, but that’s not exactly a novelty with Sherlock. He smiles, following Sherlock down the street. “Want to go for dinner? I don’t think we have anything to cook.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says, cutting him off. “But just knowing you, John – just knowing you and knowing you were happy was so much; I never dared wish for more – and in the end, no, in the
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I’ve explained it quite clearly, and I don’t like repeating myself. It’s tedious. Now, let’s go and see the fortuneteller.”
“Is there anything else you’d like to ask?” the fortuneteller asks, still smiling despite John’s sudden depression.
Sherlock just stares at him, feeling short-circuited by the warmth of John’s fingers wrapped around his wrist.
“You’re so brilliant,” John murmurs again, his voice quiet. “And so – you’re so handsome,” he says, voice turning to something just above a whisper.
“Oh, you have such faith in him!” Moriarty says. He claps his hands in delight. “It’s too much, it really is. But we do have something in common, John. Can I call you John? Don’t bother answering; I don’t really care what you think. Anyway,
She shakes her head. “No, we have to,” she insists.  “It’s where I have to go.  You promised!  Please!”  Her eyes fill with tears again, and John feels a headache forming.  His thoughts don’t feel so cloudy anymore, and he’s beginning to feel a bit of panic, trapped in this strange place with this girl.
John snorts out a giggle in surprise, and Sherlock looks up at him, affronted, but then he can’t help but giggle, too, and then they’re both laughing and kissing and by the time their laughter quiets and their kisses grow deeper and their sighs turn to moans, they’re ready, and Sherlock marvels at how he ever could have lived without this.
John’s heart is still racing, but he can’t help but shoot Sherlock an annoyed glance at that proclamation. After all, there’s only one new male friend in his life. Sherlock grins at him and John rolls his eyes.
“Well, it’s an interesting thought, isn’t it?” Sherlock says as the last of Redbeard slips away from his fingers and curls around John’s. “I was not the same five minutes ago, and neither were you. Everything we do changes who we are. For that matter, John, consider who you were the very first time you stepped into this apartment compared to who you are now. It’s a world of difference, isn’t it?”
“Your parents are quite peacefully resting. Don’t worry about them,” Molly says, the atmosphere immediately changing to something intimate and serious. Her voice is warm, but her eyes remain closed. “It was a terrible accident they died in, wasn’t it? But, they died to protect you, and they’re at peace now.”
“Think we’ll make it to the bedroom next time?” John asks afterward, his face centimeters from Sherlock’s, so close that Sherlock can see him in glorious detail.
, but he can’t help but imagine, and it’s more fascinating than he would have expected. His fingers itch to measure her, catalogue her, file everything away – but the sound of John’s footsteps coming down the stairs break through his thoughts and he straightens, looking at John.
“Mrs. Hudson!” he shouts upon entering, unsure if she’s in her own 221A or upstairs in 221B.  He hesitates for a moment before taking the stairs two at a time up to 221B.  Mrs. Hudson is inside dusting, and she frowns at him.
To his surprise, John reaches out and puts a hand on his forearm, and clasps it. “I’m glad you don’t grow that anymore,” he says.
John gives a huff of frustration. “Would you bloody leave off her a bit? How do you even know I had lunch with her?”
Sherlock’s never been to Diagon Alley, but he’s seen pictures in books and heard all about it from Dad. He desperately wants to go; he’ll even let Mummy put Sleakeazy in his hair if he has to, even though he hates the heavy distracting dull magic all over his head. It gives him a headache, but it’s worth it if it means he can go to Diagon Alley.
It doesn’t last long before John pulls away. “Come to bed,” he says. His lips are only a hair’s width away from Sherlock’s and his words feel warm against Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock nods, his nose brushing John’s. John smiles at him, soft and warm, and carefully undoes Sherlock’s top button. Sherlock watches, keeps his hands on John’s waist, revels in the tickle of John’s fingers as he works his way down the shirt and then untucks it from Sherlock’s trousers. Sherlock is breathing heavier, and his breath hitches when John pushes the shirt off his shoulders. It falls but gets caught on his wrists, and then John laughs, bowing his head and leaning into the crook of Sherlock’s neck, high pitched giggles filling the bedroom and his laughter warm against Sherlock’s skin. Sherlock can’t help it, he joins in, and pulls his trapped arms tighter around John until they’ve both stopped.
He leans up, going onto his toes, tilting his head upwards. Their eyes meet for just a second, and Sherlock’s widen when he realizes what’s going to happen. John smiles the tiniest bit, feels Sherlock’s breath against his lips, and presses their lips together. It’s light at first; chaste. Sherlock’s lips are soft and supple against his own. He holds their mouths together for a moment then pulls away, just a little. He presses a small kiss to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth and looks up at him. Sherlock’s breath is coming faster and his hands settle against John’s waist, pulling him closer despite the fear in his eyes. John can feel how fast Sherlock’s heart is beating, and he pulls his head down again.
Sherlock smiles thinly, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Wishes,” he repeats, crossing his legs and resting his hands in his lap. “The fact that you came in here means that you have a wish. I can grant it, for a small price.”
Sherlock kisses back desperately, pressing his tongue insistently against John’s, moaning into the kiss as his hips buck under John’s hand. His leg tightens around John’s hips, and then Sherlock shifts his arm, brings his own hand down between them. He laces his fingers through John’s but shifts their grip, encompassing John’s cock and his own in his long fingers.   John shudders and groans into the kiss, his arm shaking under his weight, overwhelmed by the feeling of Sherlock’s hand on him. He gasps open mouthed against Sherlock’s lips as pleasure washes over him. Urgency coils in his stomach and he groans helplessly when Sherlock’s thumb brushes over the head of his cock.
“I’ll see you later,” John says. His voice is crackly and raw, and it hurts to speak. He feels guilty when Redbeard makes a series of forlorn, low squeaks and cranes his little head towards John, but it’s already 3:29. He needs to see Arthur.
After a moment, John pulls away, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. “Sherlock,” he says. “How are we – is this really you?”
John ignores the skull and stares at Sherlock. “Er – right. Well, can’t really help that, can I? I was born with it and all that. Shall I make tea?” he asks, heading towards the kitchen and ignoring the sting of Sherlock’s comments.
Sherlock’s lip trembles, but he fights against it valiantly. “Mummy, he was – my nutcracker, his name is John, he’s a
But they’re working a case now, and it feels good to be with Sherlock this way, just like the old days. Lestrade has called them in for the first time in ages, and Sherlock had beamed at John in the flat as he told him to get his coat and hurry.
John stares at him for a moment, his heart still beating fast in panic, but feels resolve settle in the base of his spine. “Left, then,” he murmurs, unsure of how Redbeard can possibly know the way, but sure that he trusts the little pipefox’s judgment. “Cheers.”
John wonders as he climbs the stairs, a mixture of apprehension and a strange form of excitement coming over him. When he gets to the landing, he takes a moment to steel himself for whatever it is that he’ll find and then he opens the door, not sure what to expect, but the silence that greets him is certainly not it.
, and then he sits beside him, staring at John intensely. Redbeard chirps against John’s neck and kisses him, and John blinks, looking at Sherlock.
John’s hands are tight fists at his sides. There are emotions and thoughts and sensations swirling in his stomach that he doesn’t know what to do with. He swallows hard, takes a deep breath. “What was your wish?” he asks, his voice neutral.
Sherlock nods, his chin quivering, and Mycroft stands, holding his hand out for Sherlock to take. Sherlock ignores it and crawls out of bed, making his way down the hall until he gets to Mummy’s room. He quietly pushes the door open, Mycroft behind him, and he rushes over to the shelf where he knows the nutcracker will be, but his eyes widen when he sees that it isn’t there. He looks up at Mycroft, who frowns. “Maybe Daddy took him to Uncle Augustus,” Mycroft says.
He shifts his hand up to cup the back of Sherlock’s head, his thumb resting along Sherlock’s jaw, his fingers curling loosely around his neck. Sherlock’s hair is soft against his skin, and Sherlock takes a shuddering breath.
Sherlock pulls away, but doesn’t take his hands away from John’s waist. His heart is pounding in his ears, and his mind is spinning, and he feels as if he’s just run a marathon. He’s staring at John, his eyes wide, his lips parted. John’s lips flushed, and he looks unsure.
Mycroft stares at John for a moment.  “I don’t know why he thinks you’re so special,” he muses, to which Sherlock throws a pillow in Mycroft’s general direction without turning away from the back of the couch.  Mycroft rolls his eyes and takes his leave.  John doesn’t bother following him; he doesn't exactly like him, after all.
Sherlock’s eyes widen as John’s words hang in the air between them and he stares at John, who’s too angry to be nervous about the words he just spoke. “
Sherlock starts to cry, anguish rising fast in his chest. He remembers everything that happened so clearly; it had just been a few hours ago, after all, that he’d felt chocolate melt on his tongue, sat beside John, watched the firelight flicker over his skin, talked and talked and
“Is she? She’s not an experiment, you know,” John says, searching Sherlock’s face for something Sherlock can’t be sure of.
“John,” Sherlock calls before John’s even made it through the doorway. He sounds urgent, and John hastily goes inside and looks towards the living room, where Sherlock’s voice is coming from, but Sherlock is merely sitting on the couch staring at him, his fingers steepled under his chin, the calculating squint of his eyes betraying the calm pose of his body.
The sound still isn’t right, but there is something comforting in the way it no longer feels like a vaguely familiar piece of nicely shaped wood, but instead, like
. Sherlock is too important for that. 221B may be gone, Sherlock may be gone, but John will stop at nothing to protect Sherlock. He won’t let this man take that from him.
She laughs again, and John smiles when they see Sherlock up ahead.  He’s wearing a suit once more, and his duffle bag over is slung over his shoulder.
. The park. He sets off at a run, eager to catch up to John. His heart is still pounding, a mix of physical activity and nerves, but he ignores it along with the people staring at him as he runs by, pushing forward, eager to get to John.
John shifts his hand a bit on the handle, their pinkies brushing once more, and Sherlock presses his closer to John’s. John smiles as he looks ahead, feeling his cheeks flush, his nervous system come alive. He has no idea where they are or how they got here, no idea what these creatures are that he’s following, no idea what lies ahead of them, but somehow, walking beside Sherlock with the lantern in their grasp, it seems
John stares at him for a moment. He’s not sure exactly what Sherlock is talking about, but suddenly it clicks. Flashes of Sherlock are going through his mind – Sherlock pulling him out of a fire, Sherlock apologizing to him on his knees next to a bomb, Sherlock folding countless cloth napkins for his wedding, Sherlock dealing with
They’re silent for a moment, and John lets his eyes fall closed, lets his head fall back against the couch.
“Sherlock,” John says. He stares, clears his throat. Breathes through his nose. “Sherlock,” he says again. His voice is rough. “I’m not good at-” He stops abruptly and takes a deep breath.
The man rolls his eyes.  “Sherlock is a rather peculiar man, isn’t he?  Who knows what goes on inside that head of his.  Although, you seem to be the best one to answer that question, don’t you?  I’d be willing to give you some…compensation if you’d give me some information about Sherlock in exchange,” he says.
John blinks, but he doesn’t look away as his eyes grow shiny. Sherlock smiles tenderly, feels a prickle behind his own eyes.
John sighs and reaches in front of Sherlock, giving him a pointed look and pulling down a third cup.
Sherlock feels a strange sensation sweep over him, a dizziness that makes him sway. “Can we sit?” he asks.
“Lovely,” Mycroft says. “I’m so glad I have John to thank for having the two of you in my life for eternity. I’m sure it will be…indescribable.”
John is making his way home on his own later, Sherlock having disappeared to God knows where, and he’s thinking about what to get for dinner.  Sherlock had told John in no uncertain terms that he required a suitable celebratory dinner that night, and though John despairs at being treated like some kind of 1950s housewife, he supposes Sherlock does deserve a nice dinner after performing so well at the tournament.
“You see everything so bloody clearly,” John says, and his words are coming out faster now. “But you miss the most obvious parts.”
Sherlock smiles and John is suddenly very aware of Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder, and of the few centimeters of water between them. He’s rarely eye-to-eye with Sherlock given their height difference, but here in the water, their faces are level, and his eyes flicker over Sherlock’s features. He finds himself entranced for a moment, taken in by the flush of color blooming on Sherlock’s cheeks and the magic that surrounds them, until suddenly, Sherlock lets his hand drop back into the water with a splash.
Sherlock’s eyes widen, his jaw freezes mid-chew, and he swivels around slowly, realizing he’s failed to account for one major factor. “Yes, Mummy?” he says around a mouthful of meringue.
The white strands bind Sherlock’s arms and legs tightly, and his head hangs limply in front of him, his curls sagging in limp disarray. John feels fear clamor at him all over again.
Sherlock breaks the kiss, though, and groans, his head tilting back, his chest heaving, pushing John up for a moment.  “Wait, wait – “
His whole body hurts, and the nape of his neck feels like it’s on fire. His legs are shaking beneath him and he’s not sure he can hold himself up. Strange thoughts are filling his mind, bleak thoughts of death and terror, and he’s shuddering. But suddenly the door opens, and Mrs. Hudson is there, looking at him in concern and grabbing onto his arms when he nearly falls forward into her.
“I can help you,” the woman says.  She smiles at him, and he’s torn between helplessness and distrust of this woman who quite literally stole Sherlock’s soul – though to be fair, she seems to have done it accidentally.
“Don’t use it if you don’t want to,” Sherlock says. “But it’s a good idea. Just think very carefully about what you use that finger for.”
John’s tired, but even so, this seems strange. He opens his eyes, squinting against the light, and looks up at Sherlock, who’s looking at him in concern. One of Sherlock’s arms is draped over John’s chest, and with the other, he is still running fingers through John’s hair, an expression on his face that John hasn’t seen before, but that makes his heart twist in his chest.
John takes his hand from his face and nods before standing to usher the man out, closing the door behind him and then turning to Sherlock.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock says, which isn’t strictly true, but he doesn’t want to leave this room, doesn’t want to leave John. He feels as if once they leave, none of this will have happened, as if the spell will be broken.
“She said she came all this way to see you, but you made a present for someone else and she’s upset.  She wants a present from you,” Billy says.
“When I met you-“ John starts speaking, but he pauses and breathes loudly through his nose again, looking away from Sherlock and clenching his left fist. “When I met you, you gave me a new life. And when you – when you
When the lift finally stops, he hurries out, ignoring the sounds and vivid magic around him, hurrying past all the people and their chaotic swirls of too much unruly and unsettled magic. Finally, he gets to John’s room, and the relief feels tangible. He goes inside quickly, eyes immediately sweeping over John’s prone form, and John looks up in clear surprise. “Sherlock?” he asks.
him, after all, and so he has nothing to hide, and he plays with an understanding and awareness he doesn’t think he’s ever had. The final
He reaches out, his hand trembling, and lays it on the side of Sherlock’s face. Sherlock closes his eyes, his wrists and feet still bound, and turns his head towards John’s hand. He exhales, and it’s warm against John’s palm. A tear leaks from Sherlock’s eye and it drips into the crevices between John’s fingers and John wants to trap it there, keep it forever.
“I see,” Sherlock says, voice clipped. “That will be all. Come along, John.” He stands, pulling a ten-pound note out of his pocket and leaving it on the woman’s table. John gathers Billy and the tote bag and follows Sherlock out, sparing a small smile and nod for the woman.
“You have it,” Sherlock breathes, eyes flickering between the sash and John’s face, taking in how worn the fabric is, how John has clearly kept it in his pocket and worried his thumb over it constantly for years.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and Mary laughs, watching as John goes. As soon as he’s out of sight, though, she turns to Sherlock and the warmth on her face snaps into cold concentration. Her mouth settles into a firm line, and her eyes are narrowed and focused.
,” she says, voice choked, as John starts to swirl her tongue around her clit, warm hot pressure building and building in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach. John’s finger slips inside as her tongue continues to swirl around her clit, and Sherlock moans helplessly, her back arching.
, and then turns to Mary, his eyes flickering over her in an inconclusive attempt at assessment. “Alright, Mary?” he asks, brow furrowed.
As they leave the park, John shushes all of Sherlock’s attempts at conversation until he’s quite sure they’re far enough away from Mary to not be overheard.
“Alright?” John whispers. Sherlock nods jerkily, and he hears the rustle of movement as John manages to get himself down on the floor to sit against the couch, the only place near Sherlock where there’s room for him to sit.
, livid that someone would dare take Sherlock away from him when he means so much to him, livid that Sherlock would make that wish to begin with, livid that his time with Sherlock is cut short. He’s so angry that he doesn’t even notice that his body is clenching up in frustration, or that suddenly, a large puddle the size of a small pond has appeared in front of him.
John bites back his sarcastic response when he sees the smile on Sherlock’s face. “Right,” he says instead, more to himself than Sherlock, nodding a bit and clenching and unclenching his hand as he tries to reconcile the location of his body with the fact that he hasn’t intentionally gone anywhere. He looks around and sees that they’re at the bottom of a large hill, and his eyes widen when he sees at least fifty spirits ahead of them, walking up the hill, all holding lanterns similar to the one John and Sherlock are holding.
“Much as it pains me to have anything in common with that git, he’s right,” Greg says with a crooked grin.
John huffs a sigh.  “The spirit world.  Of course.  And of course some random bloke I’ve never met who’s apparently part of the spirit world is going to tell me how thick I am, right.  Listen, I don’t know you, but I can see why Sherlock calls you his archenemy.  If you’ll excuse me, I’m going home, and I’m quite sure you’re not invited,” he says, speeding up his walk.  The rain seems to pick up, and he tightens his grip on his umbrella, but the main keeps up his fast pace.
“Why?” John asks, the talking skull still managing to shock him even though he’d had quite a bit of time to try and digest it all.
John keeps his hand where it is for a moment and watches Redbeard, surprised that he feels more relaxed with the little pipefox on his arm. He feels both his frustration with Sherlock and his mild shock slip away now that they’re home and safe and things have sunken in a bit. He glances up at Sherlock, feeling unaccountably fond. “Did you know that’s what would happen when you gave me that arrow?” he asks.
“I know,” John says again. “I want you to, too. But your mum and dad would worry, don’t you think? It’s really getting late.”
John looks ahead, and sure enough, he sees the familiar string of light bulbs illuminating the mysterious food stand, alone in a darkened area.
“No, I don’t think so,” the man repeats, sounding annoyed. John can relate to being annoyed with Sherlock, who’s currently staring intently at the man’s pinky again. John looks at it as well, and he feels his mouth drop when he sees a cloud of black smoke emerge from the man’s finger.
“Sherlock can help you, John, don’t worry,” Billy says, his voice cutting through the haze in John’s head. He’s strangely comforting, for a skull.
When he wakes, Sherlock is curled on his side and John is curled up against his back, his chest warm and solid against Sherlock’s back. Sherlock sighs and presses back against him, but then the sound of a crying baby registers in his mind, and John gives his waist a squeeze and presses a kiss against the back of his neck. “Be right back,” he murmurs, his voice low and rough. He presses another kiss, mouth open and lips hot and wet, against the top vertebrae of Sherlock’s spine. Sherlock makes a breathy, wanting sound, and John’s fingers sweep over his side.
“Mycroft,” John says, equal parts relieved and distrustful, ignoring his questions of how the fuck Mycroft knew Sherlock was in danger.  “What do I do?”
He stops and scrubs a hand over his face, squeezing his eyes closed and taking a deep breath. Redbeard presses against his side, and John focuses on his breathing again, in and out in and out, and tries desperately to focus his thoughts.
Molly giggles and hides it behind her hand. “No, no, nothing like that,” she says. “It’s just easier to know what to call you. Put your hand on the handle,” she says, putting her own on the one close to her. She rests her hand palm down, and John carefully copies her movements on his side of the table.
“How old were you?” Sherlock asks, and John’s relieved to tell this story to someone and have them believe it and not question his sanity.
“You have me,” John says as he pulls away, his eyes flickering between Sherlock’s lips and his eyes.  Sherlock cranes his neck up and they kiss once more, John settling his head back against the pillows.  John kisses his jaw, trails his lips from his chin to just below his ear, nips his earlobe, shifts his mouth to the side of Sherlock’s neck.  His mouth is hot and Sherlock moans helplessly, turned on and needy and desperate.
Mrs. Hudson frowns at Billy for a moment, then turns to John, looking at him in sharp assessment that seems more like Sherlock than herself.  She’s gone from worry to composure alarmingly quickly.
Mary raises her eyebrows in surprise. “Really? That’s a long time.   Do you know when he’ll be back?”
The spirits’ presence is strong, and he tries to send gratitude to them through his mind, but he’s not sure they can feel it. His head is full of sharp, acute pain, so much pain that he feels dizzy and weak, but he doesn’t care; he needs to do this.
The woman comes back with a cup of tea, and John feels suddenly appreciative of her. “Thank you. I don’t even know your name,” he says.
“We had dinner and wine with Mary,” he says, looking at John as if John is missing a brain. “Surely you know this already; you were there.”
that closes the first movement of the Bruch. Sherlock remembers the way it felt to play earlier, to let the music soar out of his heart and into the air around him, and bravely, he lets his fingers curl around John’s in return. He nods, unsure he’s able to talk, his entire being focused on the feel of John’s skin against his own, as soothing as it is terrifying.
He takes the stairs slowly, as usual, and opens the door. 221B is quiet these days; neither of them gives in to dramatics anymore, not after what’s happened. There was a time when he’d expect to see Sherlock shooting the walls, but he knows that’s not what he’ll find now, not with Sherlock being
He nods in return, trying not to show his desperation.  He keeps it under tight control.  “Yes,” he says.  His heart is pounding; he can barely take his eyes off of the cupcake long enough to look her in the face.  “It is.  I’d really like it back.”
you, you know,” John says in annoyance, then pulls the ring out of his pocket and holds it out to Sherlock. “This. This! You
John looks at him in annoyance. “It might not be the best idea, walking home alone, but it doesn’t mean she should be
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I was in the tunnels first, of course. The tunnels exist in the astral plane, John. No one could have gone there besides you or I.”
“Like what?” John asks. He’s always curious about Sherlock’s world, but for the first time, he’s talking to someone who seems like he might actually answer his questions, and his curiosity spikes.
Before he can reply, she’s gone into 221A, the door closed loudly behind her, and John is left alone, bemused, on the dark basement stairs.
He decides to simply walk in the direction he’s facing, and so he does. His footsteps sound strange and muffled, and he’s shivering. He’s not sure how much time passes while he’s walking, but he hopes he’ll get somewhere soon because wherever he is, it’s freezing. He pauses for a moment, though, and cocks his head to the side. He can hear something: a voice, soft and feminine.
He allows himself the indulgence of thinking about the very first time he’d sat with Sherlock on the roof. In hindsight, he can see how very enchanted by Sherlock he was (and still is), and he remembers it fondly, remembering their closeness, the hushed atmosphere, and the magical quality of the evening. He longs for it down to his very bones, and abruptly, he remembers Moriarty again, his singsong voice and mercurial attitude.
The spirits are different somehow as he walks amongst them than they are when he runs from them. They almost seem beautiful here in the strange intimacy of the lantern light. They’re talking to one another, and they all seem excited, pleased, even
He closes his eyes to the outside view and focuses on nothing but the sound of his violin, trying desperately to stop the worrisome thoughts about Mary and John and their unborn child and Moriarty and the new frown lines that have cropped up on John’s face in the past few months and the rapid-fire appearance of a smattering of new gray hairs on the top of John’s head where it used to be nothing but pale browns and deep yellows.
“We go back many years,” Sherlock says.  He seems uncomfortable.  “He likes to consider himself a sort of…older brother figure, but I assure you, he is anything but.”
, and John’s not supposed to agree with him when he says he has feelings, and he’s not supposed to admit he has feelings in the first place. He swallows and turns on his heel, going back into the kitchen. He stares at his plate, feeling somehow like this is an important decision, and then he hesitates, picks it up, and goes back to the sitting room with it in his hands, where John’s shoulders loosen and his face settles and he gives a small nod, mostly to himself, and picks up the remote to change the channel. It’s awkward, and their reactions to the television are stilted, but Sherlock thinks that’s okay.
Sherlock turns over drowsily, letting his arm stretch out over the warm spot where John had just been as John tugs on a dressing gown and ties it round his waist. Sherlock watches with half-closed eyes and smiles when he notices it’s his own, the sleeves dragging past John’s wrists. John bustles out of the room and Sherlock listens to the sounds of Iris’ crying, squinting blearily at the monitor on the nightstand and watching as John goes in and pulls her up out of the crib, cuddling her close and kissing her, then changing her diaper and talking nonsense to her as she continues to scream. Sherlock lets his eyes close and he listens to the sounds of John descending the stairs and then rummaging in the kitchen, Iris still crying, and he is surprised when after a few moments, John’s footsteps come back to the bedroom.
This time, he holds their lips together and then opens his mouth, lets warm breath pass between them, feels Sherlock’s lips part against his. It’s thrilling, feeling Sherlock’s lips against his like this, and he runs his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, fingers winding through curls. The only sounds are of their breaths, soft gasps passed between their mouths, and John lets his tongue slide against the inside of Sherlock’s upper lip. Sherlock gasps into the kiss, his head dropping lower. John’s feet go flat against the floor and Sherlock brings one hand up to cup John’s head. The feel of Sherlock’s long, elegant hand against his neck is intoxicating, and he can’t help the breathy gasp he makes when Sherlock’s tongue presses against his. His insides feel like they are on fire; his every nerve ending is on alert; his entire body is craving this connection.
John’s stunned for a moment, all of Sherlock’s actions of the day catching up to him, and he can’t wrap his mind around how much of this Sherlock knew would happen, and whether or not this is really Sherlock’s intention for the arrow – but then, Sherlock’s voice is in his mind, saying, “It’s inevitable, John,” and he stops worrying.
The phone continues to ring shrilly, and he sighs as he makes his way over to it. Redbeard is curled atop the receiver, so he holds his hand out for Redbeard first, who feels warm and familiar against his skin. He picks up the receiver and collapses into the couch, but before he can say hello, he’s overtaken by a coughing fit.
“Keep your head down, John, just like this,” Sherlock says, his long fingers pulling John’s head forward.
John swallows, though his mouth feels dry. “Tell me what?” he murmurs, hyperaware of every point of contact between them.
They’re quiet for a moment, and Sherlock focuses on keeping his breathing steady, on trying to relax, on the warmth of John surrounding him, on John’s magic and his physical presence. John’s fingers are stroking through his hair, and he still occasionally tells him it’s alright, and Sherlock thinks he should feel embarrassed, but somehow, he doesn’t. He takes a few deep breaths, tries to get himself under control, breathes deep until his breaths no longer stutter, until his eyes feel dry, until the cloying darkness of the curse is just a memory.
The sound is scratchy and unfamiliar, a mere shadow of the pure, expressive, effortless sound he used to produce. He sighs and tries again, trying to be patient. His nose wrinkles in distaste as he plays a few notes in first position, the sound unfamiliar and strange, his fingers no longer accustomed to the bite of the strings beneath them.
John closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. When he opens his eyes again, Sherlock and the skull are still looking at him expectantly.
“It’s nothing,” John says. “I work in a clinic; sometimes I catch a cold. Actually, you should probably not get too close; I wouldn’t want you getting sick, too.”
Finally freed from the confines of Mycroft’s fingers, Sherlock scowls. “Herbert’s making meringues,” he says, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Did you actually sleep last night?” John asks, letting his paper shift down so he can see Sherlock.
something new,” Billy says and then laughs. Sherlock chuckles with him, and John shakes his head, but a smile creeps over his face in spite of himself.
,” Uncle Augustus says, and Sherlock nods eagerly, looking up at Daddy with imploring eyes. Mycroft and Mummy gather behind them, and so do many other relatives, and so Daddy relents, though the smile he gives Sherlock is the one that means Sherlock would have gotten his way anyway, and Sherlock smiles, excitement rushing through him.
“John, don’t you see? When you met Arthur, you stayed with him even though you knew what was happening to yourself. It’s the same with Mary. She may be kind or funny or whatever it is you
“Cheers,” Sherlock says, and John echoes him, clinking their glasses together before taking a sip of the nectar. It tastes even better than John remembers, perhaps because it’s fresh, and he closes his eyes, savoring the sweet taste.
“Oh fuck,” John says. “You’re amazing, Sherlock, you’re fantastic, come for me, love, come on,” and he pulls, harder than he has yet, and then Sherlock is coming, hard and fast, all over his t-shirt, the pleasure making his limbs curl, making him tighten his grip on John’s leg, making his whole body go taut and tense, and John’s fingers never leave his hair, never stop soothing over his scalp. When Sherlock finally finishes, his body relaxing against John’s leg, he is panting as if he’s run a mile and it suddenly occurs to him what just happened and he feels a strange sensation flood his awareness, as if he’s come back into his body from somewhere far away, and he feels anxiety he doesn’t understand wash over him. He hardly realizes he’s begun to panic until John is sliding down, his knees creaking, his body warm and perfect and everything Sherlock needs, and then John takes him in his arms, pulls him flush against him heedless of the mess on his shirt, one hand still in his hair, the other going up and down his back.
“Stop that,” John says gently as he realizes why Sherlock seems concerned. “Does it look like I have any second thoughts?”
, one which has been bothering you since you were young. One pertaining to your family lineage. One pertaining to the
John breaks the kiss but doesn’t gentle in his hold of Sherlock, doesn’t go far, just breathes, his breath ghosting over Sherlock’s lips. He lets his nose bump Sherlock’s for a moment as they both catch their breath and Sherlock feels desire curl deep in the pit of his stomach.   He
Sherlock swallows, lips parted, unsure he can speak. He manages a nod, unable to take his eyes off of John. John smiles, his eyes crinkling, his thumb still sliding over Sherlock’s cheek. He leans down again, and this time Sherlock knows what to expect, but that doesn’t make it any less perfect, any less brilliant. His hands find John’s back again and curl into the back of his shirt, and John kisses him a little bit longer this time, shifts the angle of his lips just so, cradles Sherlock’s head in his hands.
John laughs and doesn’t resist when Sherlock nudges his ankle with the tip of his shoe, gesturing towards the stairs with his head. “Go on, John, upstairs,” he says, and John immediately heads up the stairs.
Memories slide into his mind, images of her kneeling down in front of him and sweeping his short hair off his forehead, pressing a kiss there, images of her with her hand on her hip as she stirs a saucepot on the stove and grins at him, images of her reading him a picture book. Something swells deep in his heart and he takes a step forward, his eyes wide.
“Sherlock, are you trying to apologize for something?” John suddenly asks. He’s smiling now. He looks amused, but it’s one of his smaller smiles, the one lined with a certain edge of sadness. Again, it’s not the one Sherlock wants to see.
“See you then,” John says. He waves at Arthur and leaves, stowing his cold hands in his pockets but holding his head high. He smiles, his heart feeling light in his chest. It’s unlike him to make friends with a stranger, but it feels nice to talk to another veteran, let alone someone who isn’t Sherlock.
“I’m not trying to be rude,” John consoles. “But most people aren’t accustomed to seeing human skulls, let alone listening to them talk.”
“Sherlock,” he says, turning back towards Sherlock. His tone of voice makes Sherlock look at him sharply. John hesitates. “I’m not – I’m not good at this, talking about things.”
“Oh,” Sherlock says again, his mind racing. “Of course I care about Iris. She’s endlessly fascinating, John.”
.” He pronounces the “t” sharply, and it seems to echo in the flat, now silent. Mrs. Hudson stands quietly and almost timidly in the corner as she watches the interaction with a hint of trepidation.
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice soft. He feels as if he’s begging, but he’s not sure what for. It’s as if a spell is weaving over them as they speak, drawing them to each other, and his heart is beating fast in his chest.
Reluctantly, Sherlock pulled away, worried that either he or John, or both, would fall asleep and miss sunset. Gingerly, he padded into the bathroom, examining every inch of himself that the small surface of the mirror would allow. He dampened a towel and cleaned various fluids off himself. He expected he would have looked different, on the outside, following the experience that he had spent his life avoiding. Yet again, he was surprised to feel that his expectation of a social situation was wrong; rather than feeling ordinary or dirty, he felt special. Were he a romantic man - and he sincerely hoped he wasn’t, though he couldn’t be sure - he would say he felt loved. Nervous, to be sure, but he trusted John implicitly. Perhaps that was what made all the difference.
Both flasks empty, John and Sherlock stood near the door and looked over the barn once more. “In theory, that should keep anything supernatural underground, where it belongs.” John immediately made a mental note to contact his network as soon as possible - he hadn't secured the site particularly thoroughly.
Sherlock brushed a piece of dust from his jacket. “The war? As I recall, you still haven't informed me about that subject.”
Sebastian sneered. “Power,” he said, distaste dripping from every syllable. “Innocent people die every day that vampires walk the earth, unprotected because people like you won’t tell them what threat exists. Once vampires became the earth’s strongest predators, hunters will go back to the top of the food chain. It will be our best chance to eradicate them all.”
Realizing he had no other way out, John reluctantly accepted his offer. “Fine,” he said, turning to go down the stairs. “Just don't go wandering off.”
The cafe they chose was quiet but bright, and they weren’t disturbed by the small number of other patrons across the room. In short order, the pair was filled with coffee and sandwiches, and ready to take their next steps. With a map spread out on the table between them, John brushed the last crumbs off his jeans and pulled out his phone. “I’ve got some voicemails,” he said, glancing at Sherlock. “Just a second.”
Eventually, with a slightly rough voice, he spoke. “We'll have to do that again. Plenty of experiments. Speaking of, how many illnesses do you think I'll catch from using a hotel cup? It's rather revolting, even by my standards.” He looked critically at the smudged glass.
John felt as though the air in the room left him. His mind raced through possibilities, all the ways out of the situation. “I could kill him.” He tried to swallow and was met with the prickling sensation of tears in his eyes.
“Not quite yet, no,” John said. “Sorry about this, Greg. It was really just supposed to be me and Mycroft here tonight.”
“We need to go,” John said simply, as distant sirens began to fill the air. Mycroft gestured to his car and in moments the group was off.
– clawed at the ground ahead of him as he tried to pull himself forward, jagged bolts of pain running across his chest and through his arms.
“Your new cologne,” Sherlock said, his voice appearing to surprise even him when he spoke. “I – it's nice.”
As John reached for Sherlock's phone, his own mobile rang and vibrated in his shirt pocket. A bit startled, he pulled it out, noted the caller ID, and clicked answer.
Standing behind Sebastian and Moriarty, Mycroft was able to make brief eye contact with John. The message was clear: whenever you’re ready.
John reached out for the door again, certain that it was a one-time explosion of memory, but Sherlock caught his wrist in a gloved hand.
“I’m under new management,” Sebastian called from afar, with more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice. He turned from John and began walking out of the central gates of the base towards a waiting vehicle. He likely would have continued walking, leaving John to the nightmare behind him, until a shot rang out over the sound of crackling flames. Sebastian didn’t notice he had been hit until he felt warm blood trickling down his cheek from a graze above his temple. The kind of injury only a master marksman could inflict.
“Sorry,” John says, looking at him in concern. Sherlock shakes his head, tries to keep breathing. He puts his hands on his knees and breathes deeply, then forces himself to stand up, and leaves the flat.
John groans. “We’re really not,” he protests, as Sherlock smiles widely next to him.  “Anyway, what do I want this broken arrow for?”
They look at each other in the light of the Christmas tree, their eyes wide. “You’re my best friend,” John whispers. “Even if I turn back into a nutcracker, I’m glad you could come to my house.”
“Yes, well, you’ve said as much,” Sherlock replies, eyes on the table, long fingers adjusting the cuff on his other wrist even though it needs no adjusting. There’s an unfamiliar flutter in his stomach, a warmth that he’s been feeling more and more since John moved in, that he doesn’t know what to do with.
, warm and Christmassy and special. As he makes his way down the stairs, though, the decorations cast new and unusual shadows around him, and he finds himself staying closer to the bannister than usual. His eyes widen as he creeps along, unused to seeing so many dark and eerie shapes in the usually empty hallways. He goes to the ballroom and opens the door with a creak, and though the tree is still lit and it provides enough warm light for him to make his way over and find his nutcracker, the far corners of the room seem bleaker than usual, blanketed in darkness and strange shapes, and he hurries to the tree, where he can be by the side of his new friend.
John goes faster and faster, harder and harder, and Sherlock takes one hand away from John’s back to grip the slats of the headboard behind him to give them stability.  John groans, loud and helpless, and Sherlock feels it starting, feels a tingle at the base of his spine, but he can’t do anything to stop it, or to warn John, and suddenly the pleasure overtakes him even though he hasn’t even touched himself and he is pared down to nothing but intense pleasure pouring through his veins, and he chokes off his groan as his body tenses, his back arching, his head falling back, one hand pushing hard against the headboard and the other pulling John close, his legs tightening around John, pulling him in, and John snaps his hips hard and then Sherlock is moaning and coming hard, his body tense and coiled and his release spurting between them as his hips jerk up to meet John.
But when he turns back to Sherlock and catches his eye, Sherlock’s hair is mussed from John’s fingers, and his lips are red and shiny. He looks so gorgeous that John can’t help but smile even though he feels off-kilter and surprised. He steps back into Sherlock’s space, and Sherlock doesn’t hesitate. He settles his hands on John’s waist and drops his head down to press his forehead against John’s, closing his eyes, taking deep breaths. The fingers of his left hand are trailing up and down John’s spine, tracing it slowly, while the thumb of his right hand is rubbing circles into John’s skin.
“No, I haven’t the time for that,” Sherlock says flippantly.  “But today seemed like a promising opportunity.  Let’s go to the park.  It’s rather nice out.”
John goes back to 221B and gets further entangled with Sherlock.  In this chapter, Sherlock gets a client, John finds some side-work, and some more characters from the series make their debut.
“You don’t need to drink it all at once, Iris,” Sherlock tells her. He refuses to talk to babies in a singsong voice on principle, but he knows that his tone of voice is much more patient than usual when he talks to her. “You’re making yourself choke. You should slow down.”
A small smile builds on Sherlock’s face, but he hides it when John turns back towards him, still laughing. “Well, what is it, then?” Sherlock asks. “I don’t know why I’m expected to remember such mundane trivia, anyway.”
,” John repeats, holding his glass up to Sherlock’s. “Cheers, and then you can pick up where you left off.”
“Let him out,” Sherlock says from beside him. He sounds eager, and John looks at his face and takes in his wide eyes and clenched hands and then turns back to the tube. Carefully, not knowing exactly what’s going to slide out of it, he cups his hand, then upends the tube into it.
“John,” he pleads against John’s mouth, a whimper escaping him when John rocks his hips and thrusts against him. When John does it again, he’s expecting it, and he rocks forward to meet him and then groans, tangling his fingers in John’s short hair.
“Is your father very stupid or is he perfect?” Sherlock murmurs to Iris. He flushes the moment the words leave his mouth, and something inside him aches with a strange mixture of agony and joy when he thinks of John trusting him with Iris, of John’s head so close as he bent to kiss her before he left, of John bumping his arm while they walk together with the pram, of John sleepily coming into the kitchen in the morning with Iris tucked warm and safe into his side, of John igniting his desire for something he’d never known he’d wanted.
Sherlock’s heart skips a beat in his chest; he’s never shown this to anyone. For some reason, though, something about John, something about the way he always says, “brilliant,” makes him think it will be okay. “Alright,” he says quietly. He stands and sets his drink down on the sidetable, pretends his hands are steady. John stands and follows.
John grins, likening him to a sulky drowned cat, and gestures at his hair with his free hand before dissolving into giggles all over again. Sherlock rolls his eyes, but then he shifts closer to John and reaches up, mussing his hair and sending it into thick, wet spikes all over John’s head.
He keeps moving, sweat trickling down the sides of his face. He shivers; his head is pounding, and this is hard work, but he’ll do it for Sherlock.   He feels elation building up inside him; the spirits are with him, moving with him through the forest. They’re not corporeal, not yet, but they’re
“Sherlock,” John repeats. His voice is softer, but he sounds worried. He reaches out and takes hold of Sherlock’s wrist, and Sherlock startles, jumping a bit at the touch. John’s hand is warm and steady, but it’s not helping his nerves. Sherlock feels exposed again, exposed and raw, but John takes a step closer, tugging on Sherlock’s wrist to keep him in place.
“It’s generally not a good idea to stand in doorways,” Sherlock says to John, brushing off the front of his coat.
“Destiny,” Sherlock repeats. “We’ve only just met, but there are no coincidences in this world. Already bonds are forming between you and I; even small encounters inevitably lead to something larger. There’s meaning to everything that happens in this life, including the fact that we met. Remember that, John.”
“I experience magic in a way that’s very… different from other people,” he says stiffly, looking away from John and folding his hands tightly in his lap. He doesn’t wish to say anymore, doesn’t wish for John to leave.
There was a time when the secret room in Sherlock’s flat on Baker Street was full of beautiful plants. One or two were not-exactly-legal, but they were hidden amongst the splendor of all the others. Slowly, though, the not-exactly-legal plants began to overtake the others until only the most illicit plants remained; ingredients for dark potions, mind-altering magical plants, individual strains of those magical plants Sherlock had come up with himself, and a few other quite illegal specimens of magical flora. Now, though, everything has died.
Instead, he’s standing on a dirt path with Sherlock, in a place he’s never been before, surrounded by a large forest. John blinks in surprise and confusion. “What – how did we – where
Sherlock hopes John gets the picture in the middle of the aisle at Tesco and stops and smiles at his phone in such a soppy way that he loses track of himself and someone yells at him for blocking the aisle. His lips twist in annoyance at the ridiculous nature of his fantasy, and he’s about to set his phone aside when it buzzes in his hand.
, and it’s hinting at a conclusion he doesn’t want to see. But still, his mind is spinning, recalling moments where John’s eyes lingered too long on Sherlock’s body, where John had looked at him with a soft gaze of understanding he’d never received before, where John had-
Sherlock opens his bag and John isn’t surprised to see him take out Billy, setting him beside him on the ledge of the large fountain.
“I will, of course, pay him adequately.  It would be much easier if you would take the job yourself-”
“John, you should know…it wasn’t your fault,” Sherlock says after a moment. He sounds uncomfortable and a bit stiff.
He takes a towel from the closet and dries his hair and body as much as he can, going up to his room to change into dry clothes before he goes to sit across from Mycroft in the living room while the water boils, bone-weary with exhaustion.
John stares at Sherlock in confusion for a moment, his lips parted and his brow furrowed. “What – landline? We don’t have a landline,” he says.
“I’ll deal with it tomorrow,” John says. “Ta,” he adds, then grabs Sherlock by the arm and pulls him bodily from the room. John Apparates both of them home, and Sherlock immediately closes his eyes against the squeezing, constricting pressure of the magic and hopes he doesn’t throw up, hunching over in pain.
John urges his head up and Sherlock complies, his heart beating fast. He doesn’t want to look at John; he’s terrified of what he’ll see because he’s not sure he can handle seeing rejection.
John gently pulls him away, sees that his mouth is beginning to twist, and wraps his arms around him, pulling him close.
“Oh,” Sherlock says, his brows high on his forehead. “John, you should know I – “ he stops and clears his throat, his heart beating fast. “I hope that I haven’t offended you or overstepped in any way –“
“Mm,” Sherlock agrees, and John takes her by the hand, leads her to the bedroom, urges her onto the bed. Sherlock lies down on her back and waits for her, and John smiles, straddling her at the waist.
Sherlock nods, swallowing, his eyes flickering over John’s face, taking in the gentle slope of his nose, the blue of his eyes, the familiar furrow of his brow.   “I love you,” Sherlock says suddenly.  He hadn’t meant to say it, hadn’t expected to, but it’s
“Yes, really,” Sherlock says.  “And I’m soaked, if you couldn’t tell,” he adds.  He sounds angry, and John sighs, pushing himself into a sitting position.
Sherlock scoffs.  “People don’t care about me, John.  People get things from me.  I’m the wish granter.  I grant wishes and strike deals.”
He’s holding her that way now while John cooks dinner. It’s so domestic that it makes Sherlock’s stomach flutter in a way he tries hard to ignore. They’re standing by the window together and since John is in the kitchen and won’t overhear, he talks to her very quietly about what they can see. He tells her about the woman walking her dog who is very clearly about to get a divorce, he tells her about the banker hiding tattoos under his suit, about the pigeons that sit on the power cord and why they don’t get electrocuted, about the teenaged boy about to go on his first date, and he doesn’t realize they’re not alone anymore until a hand, warm and solid and strong, presses gently between his shoulder blades. He does his best not to lean into it.
He nods in determination and reaches out. The doorknob is icy cold, but he turns it nonetheless. The door opens with an ill-omened creak, and he steps through. The door doesn’t disappear this time; it stands tall behind him, and John hopes he can remember where it is when he needs it later.
Sherlock doesn’t say anything for a moment. He turns, finally, looking at John in annoyance. “I’m not walking on eggshells,” he says. “The eggs are in the fridge, quite whole.”
John nods, determined. “Yes,” he says, pushing the fear aside, focusing on his need to get Sherlock back.
Sherlock thinks John must misunderstand the depth of Sherlock’s feelings. He knows this can’t be real. “No - ”
Sherlock hesitates, then gives a clipped nod, his eyes trained somewhere to the left of John. “Yes,” he says. He sounds defensive.
“No, not quite,” Sherlock said. “More like…hmm, I suppose you could consider them gods. They’re spirits who watch over a certain part of the world. You met the spirit of good fortune here, remember?”
“Lay down,” John says. Sherlock shifts himself up the bed with trembling arms, never taking his eyes off of John, until he’s lying on his bed, and John follows him, lies beside him, turns his body to face Sherlock, and Sherlock turns on his side, too.
“Keep going,” John tells him. “Faster. You’re so close already, Sherlock, fuck you’re gorgeous.” Sherlock moves his hand faster up and down his cock, hears sounds coming from his throat he isn’t conscious of making, feels like pleasure is overloading his senses. His balls tighten against his body and he is
The next morning, a Saturday, dawns bright and cheerful. It’s a beautiful day outside; it’s not too hot, the sun is out, and there’s a light breeze. There’s no threat of rain, such a rare occurrence that John feels the need to capitalize on it. When Sherlock bellows that they’ve run out milk, John’s more than happy to go to the store and pick some up.
– and the voices start to whirr and buzz around him, blending into a high pitched and indistinct noise that’s battling with the frantic beating of his heart, pervasive and loud in his ears.
“Cheers,” John says, holding his glass out. Sherlock feels raw and exposed but he echoes him in the toast, and then their glasses come together with a small clink. Sherlock takes a sip, the flavor deep and warm on his tongue.
“I’ll leave you three alone,” Moriarty says. “This is all so fun, but I have some preparations to make. Enjoy yourselves!” Moriarty laughs, a high-pitched, menacing sound, and then he disappears, and John immediately turns towards the web.
“Tell me everything,” Sherlock says. He puts his hands on John’s shoulders, the little bag pressed between John’s shoulder and Sherlock’s palm, and stares at him intently. “Start from the beginning and don’t leave a single thing out.”
John frowns, and the smell he’d noticed earlier intensifies.  He stops, choking, and covers his mouth with his free hand again, tugging on the girl’s hand and forcing her to stop.
Standing before him is a small boy, maybe seven years old, with copper colored hair.  He’s carrying a stack of dishes and staring at John, mirroring the same shock that John knows is on his face.  It wouldn’t be so alarming except for the fact that the boy has the ears of a fox on top of his head and a large bushy tail rising up behind him.  They stare for a moment, both equally as shocked as the other, and then the boy loses his footing, the dishes flying out from his grip.
“Tonight?” she asks. “Actually, I have plans. But what about tomorrow night? How about Sherlock comes along, too?”
“John,” Sherlock interrupts. He feels hopeless. His skin is crawling, he wants to curl up in a ball, wants to escape. “I – I
“You don’t even know what I was going to ask,” John says. He looks relieved that Sherlock interrupted him, though he’s feigning annoyance.
He closes his eyes, the words he can’t say rushing forth inside of him, threatening to spill, emotions he can’t handle fighting their way to the surface, when John reaches forward and pulls him into a hug again. He feels embarrassed to say such a mundane, trite thing to John, but it’s just another emotion to add to the cloud currently overtaking him. Somehow, this time, Sherlock relaxes into the hug, pressing his face into John’s neck, clutching the back of John’s jumper.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. He takes another sip, letting the warmth ease him into talking. “The first time I used magic, Mummy was calling me in for dinner and I didn’t want to go, so I shut her up.”
John gives her an amused look, standing up and grabbing the few files he has on his desk as he heads towards the doorway where she stands. “I am,” he confirms. He takes the top half of her stack and piles it on top of his own files. “I’ll help you; you’re about to drop all those if you’re not careful.”
Sherlock smiles again, and it’s tinged with a sort of melancholy John doesn’t understand. “You’ll see,” he says.
The little girl holds out her free hand, too, feeling the rain.  “It’s never rained here before,” she says.
John and Sherlock both send a glare in her direction, but it only makes her smile more, and Billy chuckles.
– and yet, he seems to, and John’s breath is shallow as he stares, enraptured, at the man before him.
“Right,” John says, too tired for such a conversation. He eats some of his food, suddenly starving, and vaguely annoyed at Sherlock’s rules.
He doesn’t mean to, but his mind turns to his favorite memories with John, the ones he keeps in the most secure area of his mind palace. He sees John smiling at him with an open mouth, with the lines at the corners of his eyes mapping out
Sherlock shakes his head desperately, feels a sense of despair washing over him. “I always did,” he says. The words come out fast and rushed, torn from some place deep inside of him. “John, I always did – you must know, you must have noticed – I don’t know how to care about people, but you – I always –” He stops, shakes his head. “Is this – are you –”
? He rushes forward and then stops short, his entire body freezing in horror. His eyes widen and he sucks in a startled breath when he sees what’s at the end of the tunnel: Sherlock. His arms are held out to either side of him, and his wrists are bound in thick white strings, as are his ankles, but there’s black smoke surrounding him that prevents John from seeing what the strings connect to. Sherlock holds his head up weakly when John gets close, and he gives John a sad, tired smile.
“You have something to inquire about,” the man says. His eyes are sharp, focusing in on John’s own like lasers.
Sherlock spends all of dinner in a state of delirious happiness. He’s sure he must be dreaming, and yet, John’s knee is warm against his own, John’s eating the same food he’s eating, John is present and real and not at all a figment of his imagination. Dinner has been like a dream; they are talking and laughing and it’s as if no time has passed at all, as if they are still nine years old and sitting in front of a fireplace in a grand castle, and yet it’s
“Sit down and hold out your hands,” Sherlock says. John does so without question, still staring at the strange disc. To his surprise, Sherlock lays it across John’s hands. It’s made of wood, but it’s light, and painted a glossy and deep purple, the symbols drawn in yellow and blue. It’s really quite beautiful. Sherlock holds the folded handkerchief above it and uses his free hand to draw a complicated pattern in the air over the handkerchief.
Sherlock nods, swallowing hard. The memory is locked away in his mind palace; he rarely allows himself to access it because it makes him think things he doesn’t think he should think.
But some things are the same, like the feeling of his worn but loved chair surrounding him as he listens to the comforting sounds of Sherlock’s violin, sipping on tea, pretending to read the paper while in truth, he is listening with all of his being to the sounds of Sherlock; the sounds of home.
“Just…will you sit?” he asks, gesturing towards the couch with his head. Sherlock goes and they sit, side by side. John settles his hands in his lap. His left is clenching, just a bit, and he looks away and exhales loudly through his nose.
John smiles, and the shadows shift. The creases around his eyes come into sharp relief, and Sherlock is overcome with the desire to kiss them. His grip tightens on John’s waist instead.
Later that night, John’s in his room, presumably sleeping, and Sherlock goes into his hidden room. He clears away some of the old dead plants with their withered leaves and tangled, knotted, dried out stems. He’ll have to get some new plants, he thinks.
He focuses on breathing and getting himself in control, and he manages, somehow, to quell the panic rising inside him. John’s hand is still on his neck, and he doesn’t dare move, though the position is becoming increasingly uncomfortable. He doesn’t think he can handle it, doesn’t think he can handle the swarm of thoughts in his mind –
“Oh, you see it now, Johnny, don’t you?” Moriarty asks, in his horrible singsong voice. “You’ll never get him back. All this work for nothing, and in the end, you’ll both be dead.”
John considers the fact that Sherlock has a demon who governs the rain as a ‘sort of older brother figure’ and that he also considers him his archenemy.  He gives Sherlock a long, assessing look, but Sherlock fidgets and pulls down two teacups from the shelf.
The first thing John notices when he wakes is that the pillow beneath his head is soft, much softer than his own. He stretches, his muscles sore and cramping, and luxuriates in the feel of the equally soft duvet over his body. He keeps his eyes closed, too tired to open them, and sighs at the feeling of a little tiny furry head tickling the underside of his chin. Lazily, he brings his hand up and strokes the little head –
Johns frown deepens. He takes another step back, and then she starts advancing faster, running. John turns on his heel and runs as fast as he can in the other direction, their footsteps muffled in this strange place so that he can’t tell how far away she is. He’s breathing fast, but adrenaline pushes him forward, keeps him running. He needs to get away from her, but there doesn’t seem to be anything else here. He wonders if he’ll be running for eternity.
He hears footsteps coming down the hall, and he knows without looking that it’s Mycroft. He turns his head and gives him an accusing glare, then puts his finger over his lips in warning, which makes Mycroft roll his eyes.
The man hangs up and John is overwhelmed by the smoke. The man’s habit has become quite clear. John follows him to a corner, where the man stops and rubs at his neck, grimacing, as if more of his body is in pain. When the light changes, the man crosses the street, stopping in the middle of the crosswalk for a moment when a tall, fit guy says, “Anderson? Phil Anderson?”
John nodded soberly and glanced down at Sherlock's neck again. “Right. You should move closer, then.” He gestured at space on the bed that was still left between them.
When John stepped into Greg’s room, he was surprised to see the DI’s laptop open and a large number of folders open on the cheap hotel desk.
“Make sure he knows it wasn't up to me,” Lestrade said quietly, looking on the window on his right. “No one knows how to handle this.”
“Do you have a plan?” Sherlock asked John over his shoulder, firing off a shot that took off a vampire’s shoulder, bringing it to its knees but not destroying it entirely.
“It’s nice to have a plan of attack,” John replied. “Speaking of. What are you doing today? I’m taking Sherlock around the city to see if he spots anything out of the ordinary.”
As John walked quickly down the hall, his mind touched on more sinister possibilities - after all, it was only six months ago that an attack on the base had taken place. That was virtually unheard of, especially in the middle of Afghanistan. It wasn’t just that there were there so few vampires in the middle of the desert, being such a terrible place to hide out during the daytime. More so, it was that John's unit - while ostensibly an army branch - was more focused on peacekeeping. Ironic, certainly, given John's ancestry; nothing brought to mind "vampire hunting" quite so well as his surname. He had spent so many nights considering the attack that had taken place. Even as Sebastian had stitched him up, John knew something was wrong. It was out of character for any vampire group to arrange themselves so thoroughly without a plan. They had to have been looking for something in particular.
Sherlock nodded at the map behind him. “That's what you've been working on for the last few weeks, haven't you?”
John looked back at him, then at the other men, listening to the seconds on the clock tick by before he answered. “We can discuss this if you really want to one day, but at the moment we have other things to take care of.”
“Also, you would do well to eat and conserve your energy. We’ve done enough for the day, and we will handle the night as John would want us to: carefully, and as slowly as we need to, until we have what we need.”
“Yes, I'm fine,” she said quickly, looking over her shoulder at the body. “I was down the hall, I had to come in early today to finish up some projects, then I heard that noise down here...  That horrible screeching. What's going on? What was that?”
There was silence, then a softly muttered, “that’s enough.” John turned over, ending the discussion.
John turned to him, a bit lost, but not very bothered that he had lost the thread of the conversation again.
“I would have preferred to work with you, John, but I do not have time to argue,” Harker continued, and leaned back on his desk to survey his creations’ first kill. In the moment before the chaos broke out, Sherlock’s gaze landed on Mycroft, and the pair locked eyes. For a moment, possibly the first in their lives as brothers, they understood one another perfectly.
John moved to stand near Sherlock, who took the other end of the plastic and moved it to the side with him. The stained sand Sherlock had been examining earlier had given only a hint of the massacre that lay on the beach now. Even Lestrade grimaced and looked away, walking to the side of the body opposite Sherlock. “Any thoughts?”
Molly snickered, then fell against the wall behind her, sliding down it to rest on the tips of her toes. “Oh, Christ. What was that? Mycroft’s a vampire too now?”
“He turned himself for the good of the cause,” Sherlock murmured, quiet enough for only John to hear him.
“You okay?” He asked eventually, glancing over at Sherlock with concern. It was finally dawning on him what had happened.
From the bathroom, he heard Sherlock’s phone ping with a text notification. Typically, this would have gone unnoticed by John, but when he came out of the bathroom a few minutes later to see Sherlock still staring at the phone, he grew concerned. “What?”
A smile played at the edge of John’s lips. “I was working under the assumption every dead body we found meant at least ten full fledged newborn vampires… But that’s not exactly the ratio you’re working at, is it? Not for what you’re doing, anyways.”
“I go left, you go right,” John said, glancing at his friend. Sherlock nodded, and tried dragging the attention of some of the vampires away.
and overwhelmed by the scent of the blood where his nails had pierced the skin of John's arm through his jumper
“So that's the fangs sorted, then,”Lestrade said, a bit weakly as the amount of information he had just acquired fully hit him.
As the group hurried down the stairs, John locked the door and ran after them, muttering about the security deposit as he went. Once through the door, he saw Sherlock pull something from his coat and, with what appeared to be the press of a button, explosives near the edges of the windows went off, leaving a large cloud of grey smoke in their wake.
Mycroft turned, his eyes rimmed in red, and a tremor beginning to form in his hand. Holding on to every ounce of humanity left in him, he gazed directly at Lestrade and whispered a single word.
“Order some garlic bread,” John said, watching Sherlock as he returned to the kitchen, and falling back, his lethargy returning. Part of him knew he should do something, even if it was just looking out the windows to see that the flat was safe. Another, stronger part begged him to stay where he was, to sit and talk with Sherlock, and enjoy the last few moments they had together before everything changed. Without much of a delay, their food arrived, and John eventually managed to pull his friend from his microscope and to the living room.
“What is that?”He asked, gesturing to a piece of white paper that stuck out near the top of the pocket.
John filled the ground around Sherlock’s body with soil, and cried as he did so. Not only for the death of his friend, but for all of the things he had never mourned – the loss of Mary, of the trust he had in his closest friends, in every unspoken word. The night had gone by so quickly, and he had never imagined this would be the outcome. To win, to see his friends once more, but to pay such a high price.  Finished, John threw aside the shovel, and curled around the mound of dirt. He kept one hand on the soil, directly above where he imagined Sherlock’s heart to be, and tried to block out his memories of the night.
John backed away, mouth agape. His family kept records, photographs, stretching back to the nineteenth century. He knew the face before him as well as his own.
“Right. First things first, we need a car. We'll need a discreet driver, obviously,”John said, looking at Mycroft, as he held his arms to the side, displaying his blood-covered clothes.
Although he still knew more than the two men beside him for the moment, Mycroft was now unsure what John was talking about. He gently tapped a cold hand on Lestrade's trembling one, attempting to keep the police officer from pulling his gun again and trying to shoot the  vampire.
John took a step from Sherlock, whose eyes were wide as he drew his own conclusions. “It hadn’t come up yet.”
“I'm not trying to be a good one,” Sherlock replied, looking at John as he threw another dart at the wall, as though to make a point.
“I've asked around for you, and I haven't turned up much,” she said, putting the phone down. “Not about these murders specifically.”
“Yes, but,” Molly said, emphasizing the second word, “I kept dwelling on it, something stuck in my subconscious, I guess. I think it’s an anagram.”
“I'm afraid you're not that lucky.” Still baring his fangs, Thomas began to pace, walking in a half circle around John. “You should have killed me yourself when you had the chance.”He looked down at his phone again, tapping it with a manicured finger. “Which brings me to our next order of business, it seems. You're getting in my way. Would you care to end this properly, or will you insist on mortal weapons?”
“On the night I went to find Mycroft in his Kensington office – to discuss the coming war, and to sway him to our side – I sensed the presence of another vampire. I could feel him on the other side of the building, feel his power equal to mine. Yet I did not know him. I knew he was there for the same reason that I was.”
“About thirty, thirty-five percent total? Depends on the person, really,” John replied, glancing over his shoulder at Sherlock. Though he was tempted, he did not tack on a 'why' to the end of his sentence; questioning Sherlock mid-thought never ended well. He had learned not to interrupt the process.
“Smells dead,” John corrected. “There have definitely been vampires down here.” He ran his light around the room. The low walls were lined with what looked like small berths.
Lestrade looked at Sherlock, then John, then pointed at himself as his brow furrowed. John rolled his eyes and nodded.
Sherlock was struck by the cruelty of what had just been inflicted on his friend. “Someone’s guarding against you, specifically, then.” Sherlock said.
“You can hardly expect me to have any interest in a case you can't tell me about,” Sherlock said, leaning back in his chair.
John’s face crumpled. He felt as though a vice had closed on his throat. Accepting Mary having become a vampire, that would have been fine, more or less – at the very least, she would have something new in common with her in-laws, and John would be happy to provide her with blood. That was a reality he had pondered, considered it a plausible option for extending their time together. Accepting this reality was not possible. He had seen her only a few weeks prior, happy and alive. Prepared to take on a solo mission. How could he have sent her to death without seeing the dangers beforehand? John attempted to recover his emotion and squared his shoulders.
Sherlock glanced at Lestrade, who was politely fiddling with his jacket and trying not to glance at John directly.
At the top of the stairs, John turned quickly and stopped at the door to the empty sitting room, leaning in and listening. “Sherlock's out. Good.” He pushed himself back and headed up the stairs to his own room. “I'll be back in a second. Grab my gun for me.”
“Who found her?” John asked, watching Sherlock as he held a magnifying lens up to what appeared to be a rust-coloured stain on the sand.
Clearly a dismissal, the waitress pondered saying something to continue the conversation, but quickly gave up and returned to the counter.
Sherlock recalled the last time he had called emotion – what was it? – grit on the lens. That conversation with John seemed a lifetime away. It had occurred to him recently that if he wanted to be the cold, calculating machine he had so hoped to become a short while earlier, he now had enough control over his emotions that he could make that wish a reality. However, opened up to the possibility that he had an eternity to live, explore, and love, he wanted nothing more than to experience everything the world had to offer. If Sherlock then could see Sherlock now, one leg between his flatmate’s thighs, he imagined ‘emotion’ would be the least of his concerns. Interrupting this line of thought, John spoke again.
John began the trek back to the center of the base, and was just rounding the corner when an explosion behind him brought him to his hands and knees. Baffled, he turned to see the mess hall engulfed in flames. Before he quite took in the sight before him, another explosion followed, this time taking down a storage warehouse.  John watched with horror as the building, collapsing sideways, began to veer into the base hospital beside it. Like the bell tower, the demolition was controlled - someone had planted the explosives. As though on cue, John heard every building near him thunder with the sound of breaking glass. Before he could think of running, he was pelted with shards, and a final explosive blast pushed him onto his back. John felt himself lose consciousness, seemingly momentarily, but when he sat up he saw that the base had been leveled; ashes thick like fog spiraled across the scorched earth in front of him.
“Found anything?” Greg asked, looking up from his own work - John wasn’t sure, but it looked like he was writing down intersections. Hopefully, John thought, so that he could post police guards near the bridge.
Sherlock, apparently unconcerned, glanced at his watch. “We should leave now. Lestrade, leave the way,” he said, throwing a hand towards the door.
“What were you two talking about? He looked like he could rip your throat out,” Lestrade asked from beside a stack of pillows. Upon finding out vampires existed and wanted him dead, he still cared enough about Mrs. Hudson to keep her cushions from becoming covered with blood.
He looked at his companions, nodded once, and entered. Molly followed, with Mycroft at her heels. He was able to adapt more quickly than the others to the darkness, and was able to locate a power switch for the lights within moments. Only a few lights flickered on, with those that did come on only lighting up a small fraction of the area beneath them. In the large area, it was more than Mycroft would have expected.
“We’ll put them back in place, and call them when they’re needed,” Harker said with a tone of finality, as Moriarty picked up a clipboard and began marking off vampires.
“Training,” John said, simply. “Being on my base meant being one of the best trained hunters in the western hemisphere. That, and during our drills I had one rule above all others: if things well and truly go to hell, get out. The army can afford new buildings and supplies. The world can’t afford losing its best protection against vampires.”
The vampires slowly began turning their heads toward John, who had expected he could hold Harker at bay just a little longer.
Light from one of the dim bulbs fell on a few broken, crumbling statues in a corner of the warehouse. Farther ahead in the room, flat stones lay on the floor. Molly laughed nervously and said that the whole thing was “very Doctor Who.”
The room swam in John’s vision, and he tried to grasp the reality of his situation. “No one can make it here in time,” he muttered. “It’s going to be night soon and I have no trained backup.”
“As you wish,” George said softly as he stood. He could barely be heard by the humans in the room, but his tone of cool, measured rage was unmistakeable. In the hundreds of years George had been a vampire, he had never had to take orders from a human. Although he was willing to abide by Abraham Van Helsing’s contract, he found it deeply unsettling. As though walking on air, George swept out of the room, followed by Charles – whose emotions were made obvious by the look he gave John – and Caroline, who seemed more uncomfortable than anything else.
“You’ve got my phone number, Mycroft – let me know when you’re up,” Greg said as he reached the door. Mycroft nodded at him and followed. Just as he was half a step into the hallway, Lestrade turned to look at Mycroft. “And get some sleep, mate. You look like you’ve been in a fight.” Greg smiled sympathetically, and Mycroft tried his best to look understanding. The DI left, and Mycroft locked the door, stepping towards the small bed to the left of the door.
Both angry and surprised, he turned to face John. His Captain, still on his feet, was pointing a gun directly at him.
Sherlock, who was plugging one of the cameras into the USB drive of his laptop, seemed to realize at that moment that his brother was missing.
“I put a little of it on my neck, just in case,”John said. “I had a feeling you'd show up at Baker Street.”
John looked up and smiled, glancing away with shyness. Although Sherlock would never recognize it, seeing it in-person, John was equally nervous about the state of their friendship. He, too, was aware that it was a watershed moment.
Something in Mycroft's expression changed, and for a second his defences fell. “My brother is not to be involved in this.”
The sun beat down on him, scalding him, like a fire running through his veins. But it wasn't day – it couldn't be – and as he raised his head, John could see only the wall of fire, and the shapes of burned buildings behind it. He tried to move forward, to crawl away, but was stopped by a sudden, excruciating pain in his shoulder. Shot? Or bit? One of the two, but he couldn't be sure. Either way, he could feel the blood pouring from him, see it staining the sand beneath him. His hands, sticky with blood –
“No, I wouldn't imagine so,” Sherlock said. “Did you frequent these clubs? They don't appear to appeal to you.”
“That choice was made for me a long time ago,” John replied. “Threatening me won't change what you've done – or what you are.”
“That’s not necessarily true, maybe the rest of the information is fine even if the lead is bad,” Lestrade interjected, familiar with false leads, and also particularly keen to get back to the Yard with some kind of solid information.
“There we go,” the voice said, and roughly pushed John forward. The vampires followed, and the group was slowly led to the centre of the high-ceilinged vault, walking between the graves. An oak desk, incongruous on the packed earth floor, sat among the graves, knickknacks and papers strewn across it. “We’ve got guests,” the voice called. After that, there was silence.
The detective inspector nodded, while neither Holmes made any sort of movement. John walked around the chair he had been pacing behind and sat down on the edge of it, glancing at Sherlock before he spoke, but keeping most of his focus on the others.
“It surprised me,” he replied. “It was different. I'm sure there was pain, but my mind didn't recognize it as such.” Sherlock paused, and continued, more thoughtful. “It was as though everything stopped.”
As though expecting him to ask, John replied immediately. “On our side? Fifteen men, two vampires.” After a pause, he added, “On theirs, fifty-one.” He didn’t need to time to remember the number; that was etched on every part of him, down to the smallest cell. It was knowing what his best friend would say that gave him pause.
John gestured at Sherlock’s phone. “That picture, that was a lot of graves. Vampire graves,” His mind raced.
“You did just drink my blood. I'm sure you have thoughts on the matter,” Sherlock said, as though he were speaking about something as routine as one of their regular cases.
Sherlock led the way to the table, and once they had room, he let John ahead of him. John slowly managed to get closer to the man Sherlock had pointed out, trying not to attract the attention of the three humans and one other vampire that accompanied him.
“Breathe, John, slowly,” he said, quietly. For possibly the first time in his life, Sherlock understood what John was experiencing. More remarkable still, he knew what to do.
“It's six o'clock,” Sherlock murmured, glancing at his phone. He held it out to John, who shook his head.
John shrugged. “Someone found me, eventually. There were stragglers who managed to avoid the worst of the slaughter but didn’t go to ground. I had them hide me in one of the medical storerooms that hadn’t been destroyed, so I could patch myself up and do an inventory of the base. Sent them off to put out the last of the fires.”
In the distance, something exploded, and small pieces of metal rained down on him, catching in his hair and scalding his hands as he attempted to protect his face. He had to move, but found himself paralyzed by the sting of another wound, a gash in his side from one of the fragments of glass that had been blown out in the earlier explosion. Unable to move, to think, he could see his vision blur and his thoughts slow, just as a man crouched in front of him. The man, illuminated by the red and gold lights of the flames that flickered in front of him, smiled at John, and was highlighted for a moment by the bright light of another explosion. Snarling, almost inhuman, he met the army doctor's eyes with his own bright blue ones and spoke. “
“Watson,” she answered. The pair stared at one another, then, without warning, moved towards one another. John, who was a good three inches shorter than Jane, lifted and spun her, keeping her locked in a hug that she returned with equal enthusiasm. Molly and Lestrade both jumped back as the pair started to laugh.
“At least. Something of this magnitude had to be arranged by an old vampire, which changes the ratio. There could be a hundred new vampires in London.”
“No – I knew you'd get hungry. For all your talk, I know I'm one of the last people you want to kill. You're remarkably bad at this, and not nearly as intimidating as you try to be. Did Mrs. Hudson let you in?”
“Just one of those deaths was enough to destroy my life as I knew it. Imagine what the other sixteen of my friends’ did to me.” He added, “It wasn’t just a matter of living. Everyone was injured in some way. Some lived, but… burned.”
She didn’t shake, though the night was chilly and she wasn’t wearing more than a thin cotton dress and pair of trainers. Almost by instinct, he tried to sense her heartbeat - couldn’t. In that moment, John was unsure if he would even be able to locate his own - it was as though the earth stopped spinning, and for a moment, all that existed beyond the rooftop seemed to disappear.
“We aren’t bringing more humans into this!” John snapped, officially losing his cool. “They wouldn’t be enough, anyways. I need people who are currently stuck god-knows-where in Romania, people in England who I haven’t even had time to call. There isn’t enough time. There isn’t-” He was verging on hyperventilation. “Either we go in on a suicide mission, or we let more people die. There is no winning scenario here.”
“Two unexplainable murders? That's the kind of thing everyone on the team is fine letting Sherlock sort out, however much they complain. Something like this, though? This is violent and bloody.  If this gets out in the media, every paper is going to go insane.”
John closed his eyes for a moment and breathed in, exhaling into a heavy sigh. “Old Town, definitely. The farther to the edges we go the less I feel.”
“No, definitely not,” John said, throwing a hand over Sherlock’s hip, and resting his forehead against the other man’s.
To distract Sherlock from the annoyance he was now feeling with himself, John continued. “Next time I’ll leave you with a little more blood. Try to make the lightheadedness hit you less like a bottle of vodka, and more like a glass of wine.”
White spots clouded Mycroft’s vision, and he felt sure that some force beyond his control was moving his body. More worryingly, something on the edges of his mind seemed to be inching forward, out of the darkness, taking it over. In his last moments of conscious thought, Mycroft thought several things; the thought that overwhelmed all the others was how desperately he wished he had told Sherlock what was going on. For all of the gentle prodding he directed at his brother, there was an underlying affection. Mycroft didn’t want Sherlock to suffer the knowledge that he had become a vampire - however, he also didn’t want to die alone. Again.
“Ah, fuck off,” the shorter man said. “Wouldn’t have needed any stitches in the first place if you had called me earlier.”
Hours later, he was awoken by a pounding in his head. As he pulled himself to an upright position, he found that he was in almost the exact same position that he had fallen asleep in. He glanced at his watch: seven o’clock. Dusk. If it weren’t for the wrinkles set in his suit, which he never had time to change out of, Mycroft wouldn’t have noticed the change in time.
John turned around at Sherlock’s warning, and noticed the crowd of pale vampires, licking their lips and baring their fangs as they came closer. John tried to weigh his options and figure out what path would cause the least damage. Although the newborn vampires would obey their master implicitly, they didn’t have more than an instinctual ability to fight. Beyond that, they had just woken up - they were still slow and disoriented. John, to his credit, had both instinct and training. He was reluctant to harm any of the newborns - it wasn’t their fault Harker and Moriarty had been able to kill and turn them - but he also couldn’t knew their allegiance was to an enemy, whether they liked it or not. In the pit of his stomach, he knew this was the Mary problem all over again.
Moriarty frowned. “Good work takes time, Doctor Watson. Experimentation. Once we perfect what we’ve been working on… Well. Some turns work out better than others.” He smiled again, and as he did so, two sharp, white fangs appeared in his mouth. Sherlock instinctively tried to move back but was held in place by the vampire behind him.
John spent the day cleaning the kitchen and, in an effort to silence his mind, the rest of the flat. He wondered if that was what it felt like to be in Sherlock's mind. By the mid-afternoon, he had managed to get a cup of tea in his flatmate's hands, and label most of the errant folders that were laying around the room. By seven thirty, he had everything organized, and he had convinced Sherlock to focus his attention on answering some of the comments on his website. With plenty of time to spare, he headed out to Lestrade's office again, leaving all of Sherlock's notes with Sally, who was oddly cooperative. Sharing the same worn-out expression as the DI, she mentioned that she had been at the crime scene as well, and had seen the victim while she gasped for air. It had taken a toll on everyone, and John found himself delayed as he tried to give a few words of comfort to the woman in front of him, as he had so many times before in his capacity as a doctor.
“Power of spite?” John said, chuckling dryly. “I’m kind of hard to kill, generally speaking. A completely human soldier could have lived through worse.”
Sherlock sighed, and closed the application. “Nothing of interest. The occasional ping that gives a general radius, but even that’s been landing all over the globe.”
As though on cue, the door behind them closed and latched. The pair spun around, but saw only a flash of black. Were it not for that, they may have written it off as wind.
John finished off the glass and sat back, tapping the fingers of his right hand on the armrest of the chair as he watched Mycroft. After a moment, he stood.
Mycroft returned to the group. “There,” he said, and gestured with an open hand to two dark cars coming around the nearest corner. Their windows tinted, John was immediately grateful that he wouldn't have to slouch in his seat to hide his torn and blood stained clothing.
As he turned towards his own opponent, he was surprised to see he knew the creature before him from a fight in Chisinau years earlier. He pulled out his knife, and after some grappling with the vampire, was able to swing his blade directly through its throat, decapitating it. He was beginning to wonder why Greg hadn’t had any luck firing, when he saw that two vampires of the group had his arms, and were holding him in place, not killing him. This moment of surprise was enough to put him at a disadvantage, and in the moment his knife hand dropped, he felt the end of a rifle touch the back of his head.
Part of his mind wanted to back away, while another wanted to crawl forward to see if he could find shelter behind the toppled watchtower. An explosion above showered him in hot pieces of metal, and John flattened down and covered his head with his hands. All he understood in his disoriented state was agony, and when pain centered on his shoulder began to radiate out into the rest of his body, he barely recognized the new sensation. Exhausted, he finally gave in to the emotional and physical beating he had taken that day and blissfully fell into unconsciousness. The last image his mind registered was boots, across from his face, then cold blue eyes staring back into his own.
Sherlock, too stunned to articulate his thoughts, nodded. He obediently drank from the glass John offered, and handed it back once it was empty.
To his credit, John didn’t rush or stop the detective, merely followed his lead with equal enthusiasm until the pair had shed their clothes in a pile around John’s bed, and the doctor was pressed back into the crumpled hotel linens. John, now as hard as his younger friend, wrapped a leg behind Sherlock’s, bringing his body closer so he could trace a hand down Sherlock’s back, feeling the indentation of each spine, the soft valleys of his ribs. His manhood, wet with excitement, met the soft hairs of Sherlock’s stomach and John, feeling more peaceful than he had in years, felt all worries about that evening drift away.
“He’s awake,” Sherlock responded, lifting his phone. “I’ve let him know you’re going over. I’m going to stop in at the Tesco down the road.”
“There we go!” the criminal mastermind commented, taking a few steps back in order to survey John. “I wondered when you’d get there. Yes, it’s taken awhile to decipher the notes, but I’m quite confident we’ve got it right now.”
“I haven't even started the autopsy on this one!” she said, walking towards the table, which Sherlock had just hopped off of.
John cleared his throat, and backed away, turning to face Lestrade and Mycroft as Sherlock found a seat on the other side of the room. Turning to face away from John, he listened and waited.
Greg didn’t lower his weapon, instead focusing on the man who held the gun. Molly was not aiming at anyone in particular, instead trying to find the nearest exit, and wondering why she and Greg had agreed to come back.
John realized that his side hadn’t suffered too many losses, until he saw a bullet pass through the chest of one of his officers - Andrews, he saw with a shock, a man he had shared a dorm room with in his early years in the military. To watch him bleed out here, under a populated city, staggered John. Before he could grasp that one of the men who had willingly volunteered to help him had been killed in the course of action, he saw another bullet land directly in the head of one of the base’s head doctors. She was a seasoned fighter and, John recalled, a mother of two.
“Me neither,” Greg replied, pursing his lips. Something felt wrong – years of work on the force had fine tuned his intuition.
Sherlock looked John over and shrugged. He began playing with his bow again, and for what felt like the hundredth time in his life, he wished that Sherlock would pay more attention to the concerns of others.
In the intervening time between unloading what little luggage they had – two discreet, black boxes that contained a few weapons lent by John – and sundown, the group had managed to put together the bones of a plan. Mycroft had booked them a room at a hotel that barely stood out from the buildings that surrounded it, and the room he chose was in the centre of the building, on a floor that sounded completely empty. Lestrade and Molly hadn’t realized how unnerving it felt to be in a hotel room without windows until they were in one; Mycroft didn’t even appear to notice.
,” they heard a soft voice say from behind the vampire, which promptly fell to the floor. Behind it stood Molly Hooper, her white lab coat stained with a few drops of blood.
about?” Lestrade asked, walking over to the windows and pushing aside several layers of drapes. He watched as the vampires, covered by heavy fabrics and umbrellas, stepped into the car that had originally brought himself and Molly back into London. As soon as their vehicle was out of sight, Lestrade turned back to John.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock answered, disappointed. “And the bus led to the club, so no need worrying about that, either.”
He walked towards Sherlock, trying to maintain as much of an air of nonchalance as he could while still keeping an eye on the politician. He stopped a few feet from Sherlock's chair; far enough away to not alarm his friend, but close enough to put himself between the brothers should the need arise. Mycroft being a vampire aside, it was probably a good place to be whenever the two Holmes men conversed.
Amidst the chaos, John paused to look up from the action on the ground. On the roof of the medical building opposite him, a few floors up, he saw a figure standing on the edge, gently swaying against the breeze. A blonde woman, dressed in blue, John was struck by how similar she seemed to Mary. Similar, but still too much of an off-kilter facsimile - until she looked at him, and John felt a dagger of anxiety pierce through his heart. It was Mary. He put a hand up, but she appeared to stare straight through him, as though he wasn’t there. John pulled his phone out of his back pocket as he got closer to the window, and dialled her number. She didn’t react, and the call went to voicemail.
That night John tossed and turned, the sounds of the city almost unbearable, with every siren a distressed wail. When he did eventually fall asleep, he found himself running from the black and red stained images in his mind, sure of nothing but the presence of blood.
“No, I need to, ah,” he searched for words. His intermittent glances at the fridge were enough to clue Sherlock in, and he gestured towards the small, humming appliance.
Sherlock and John’s conversation progressed similarly over the next hour as they looped around Castle Rock and continued south, slowly taking in the city as they made their way through Holyrood Park.
“Ah, of course, but wait,” Jonathan said, mocking. “You don’t wish to kill vampires, only keep them in line if they kill humans - as they are biologically engineered to do. Foolish,” he spat.
“Yes. Though I was not sure that I had been successful until tonight. There was a bit of a…” He pondered the encounter for a moment. “A bit of a
Instead of answering immediately, John gently cupped Sherlock’s face, and by instinct, Sherlock leaned in to it. He hadn’t realized how touch-starved he was until John came close.
“No,” John said. “As I said, that level was safe. Everything was relocated following the attack. But,” John trailed off for a moment. He recalled his last image  of Sebastian. “He might have thought he found it.”
“Vampire politics,” John said, one hand covering his eyes. “I think I’ve just managed to undo a few decades of treaties in under a minute.”
Sherlock removed a glove, and ran his bare hand over the dirt, and then held it in front of the flashlight. “Very bad indeed,” Sherlock said, then turned his hand towards John. “The ground isn’t soaked with water.” He wiped his palm on his handkerchief, and left a trail of red.
Moriarty, still smiling, looked to the corner of the vaults, through to a smaller room. Slowly, Mycroft came through, stepping slowly and deliberately forward. John was impressed by the expressionless facade Mycroft was able to keep, and for a moment almost forgot the politician was on their side.
“I told you I’d kill you one day,” Jim said to Sherlock, smiling happily, shaking his head as though this were the most obvious conclusion.
Sherlock's mouth closed and he and John stared at each other, both annoyed. For all of their petty arguments, the pair were only rarely genuinely angry with one another. After a moment of silence, Sherlock's natural curiosity overtook his desire to be cross with John.
Greg, to their surprise, was nowhere to be seen. John hoped that meant he’d had good luck with the Scottish Police and was tying the murders in Edinburgh to those in London. Once back in the room, Sherlock tossed his scarf off and tacked the map of the city he had been carrying up on the wall. John cringed, and then sent a silent prayer into the universe that housekeeping wouldn’t notice. He headed over to the sink and drew a glass of water.
Lestrade ran after him. “Did I just hear you say 'I don't know?' Oh, I've got to tell the boys at the Yard about this.”
At the entrance to the hospital, Lestrade parted ways with the pair, and Sherlock and John were left on their own in the taxi.
“What the hell is that?” Lestrade asked, his voice far away in John's ears. Mycroft grabbed the edge of the detective inspector's coat, pulling him back to relative safety.
“That was just it - the story got bigger. Certain names became too recognizable. It's impossible to carry on a career when everywhere you turn, someone thinks you seem familiar. You see, as long as vampires have existed, vampire hunters have as well, and one of the changes made in the story was the surprise of the people hunting Dracula that supernatural beings like vampires could exist. That was the most obvious lie; everyone who tracked him down was very well-practiced, and had made a career out of hunting. The Harkers actually got married while they were in the Alps trying to find an Old One.” He glanced at the window, eyes lingering on the raindrops that were hitting the glass. He wasn't sure when it had started. He resumed looking at the group, which still seemed equal parts unsure and anxious.
like the typical ‘morning after,’ but he couldn’t quite figure out which memory of the night before he wanted to assign his guilt to.
“In a sense,” John answered, glancing up at Sherlock. “Sherlock will text you coordinates, you be sure to pass them along if anyone needs to find us.”
A smile briefly flared on John’s lips, and Sherlock involuntarily stepped away as far as he was able. A smile like that only appeared when John was about to hit someone.
“One of the doors of the body cabinet in the morgue was open when I came back,” she said quietly. The realization hit Sherlock before it did John.
