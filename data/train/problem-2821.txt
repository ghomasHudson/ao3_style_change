"So," Charlie says tentatively, obviously picking her words with care, "how're you doing with all this, Dean?"
Dorothy rubs Charlie’s back while looking at Dean. “Come on, let’s all just chill out. Clearly we’re all just tired and ready for a break.”
“I love you, too, Cas. It -” Dean swallows, looking terrified himself, but also open, vulnerable, hopeful. “It doesn’t have to be something you can’t have, ya know, if you still want it.”
She cuts him off, which is probably a good thing. He isn’t quite sure where that statement was going, just what it was he was about to promise. But Anna is shaking her head emphatically. “Don’t make promises like that, Castiel. It isn’t fair to either of you.”
"So you done hating everyone?" she asks, and he about jumps out of his skin because she did that thing where she kind of just
Anna just smiles sadly at him. “Yeah, you are,” she says. “And the saddest part is that you're just going to let him slip through your fingers.”
Making a reach for her drink, Anna asks, "So how'd the date go?" Cas gets a dreamy expression on his face, and before he can even answer, she happily muses, "That good, huh?"
Castiel just scrutinizes him harder, and it makes Dean swallow nervously, his stomach doing a flip under the intense attention. “Are you okay?” Cas finally asks.
No, he isn’t, unless his mom pops in again to whisk him off, which is unlikely. He hopes she doesn’t, honestly, because he’s looking forward to celebrating Thanksgiving with the Winchesters this year. Which is clearly something he has neglected to tell Balthazar.
And Castiel doesn’t come right out and say it, doesn’t confess his feelings, but Dean holds him all the same. Reassures him all the same. And Cas thinks if he wasn’t in love already, he certainly is after that.
The silence hangs heavy and suffocating, and Dean isn’t sure if she’s waiting to make sure he’s done talking or if she just has nothing to say. Tears prick the back of his eyelids again and he fights them back. He won’t cry again; he won’t!
He scratches the back of his neck, a nervous tick, and as soon as he does it, he knows he's screwed. Still, he plows on, not quite making eye contact. "It's nothing, Anna."
Oh, for cripes sake, Dean thinks. “It was cool. Hung out with Charlie and Dorothy after homecoming and spent yesterday paling around the house with my family,” he answers.
"Then we'll work out the details this afternoon." Balthazar pushes off the locker and places a kiss to Cas's cheek. "I'll see you at lunch."
Anna, for her part, plays the clueless role perfectly. While Castiel, for his part, is sure he's about to spontaneously combust. The thought
Guilt and anger wage a war in his chest, but neither seems willing to relent, so instead he says, "In my defense, I was pretty sick."
Namely, a very discontented boyfriend. Balthazar, for his part, has tried to be understanding, Castiel knows this, and if Castiel were better, fairer, kinder, he would love him all the more for it. Unfortunately, Castiel is finding that he doesn’t love his boyfriend at all, isn’t even sure that he wants to continue down this path with him (if he’s having a moment of incredible honesty with himself, he’s sure he doesn’t want to). So really, Castiel kind of resents how understanding Balthazar is being, wishes he would pick a fight. It would give Castiel some kind of excuse to end the relationship that maybe wouldn’t leave Cas feeling like a selfish SOB. But no, he had to go and pick a nice one. Aren’t all first relationships supposed to suck?
It isn't until Dean and Anna are alone, Charlie and Dorothy having run off to be left to their own devices, that Anna brings it up. Honestly, Dean's kind of shocked it took this long. He's been a horrible date, and he knows it.
Charlie and Cas exchange another quick look before Charlie says, aiming for casual, "Was just asking Cas what he and Balthazar are planning to do tomorrow."
“Anna,” his voice cracks, so he swallows around the lump in his throat and tries again. “Anna, I won’t-”
Charlie rolls her eyes. "Right, of course, do forgive me. I forget shouting at your friends in the middle of the cafeteria and then storming off is the thing you do when you're
Finally, he says, "I want to ask about your day, but I'm afraid that then we won't have anything to talk about tomorrow."
And suddenly, quite without any warning at all, he’s crying on her shoulder, and he feels awful about that among so many other things.
also seems to have impeded the functioning of Castiel's vocal cords, as all he can do it stare, wide-eyed, back at Dean.
Charlie regards him skeptically. "Does it by chance have something to do with a certain blue-eyed, dark-haired, genius boy?"
A long while passes before he gets another response from her, long enough that he actually puts his phone down to pick back up his video game.
Dean doesn't stay much longer, suddenly altogether not in the partying mood. He was managing without Anna by his side, but now with Cas pissed at him, he isn't managing anything. Without evening having one beer, he climbs back into his car and heads straight home, curling up in his bed (thankfully, no one is still awake to question what he's doing home so early). He contemplates texting Anna, but decides against it. She's probably busy doing her brainiac thing, and Dean doesn't want to get in the way of that. It's a pounding reminder that he isn't good enough for two of the people he cares most about.
Charlie stares him down. Honestly, it’s a little unnerving. “Are you for real?” When he just continues to stubbornly stare at her, she let’s out an ever-suffering sigh.
“You so did,” Charlie insists, and before he can interrupt her again, she continues. “How about when you insisted on holding his hand all through first grade?”
“Gay?” Dean asks, and Castiel nods, averting his eyes again. “Hey, look, that doesn't matter. You're my best friend, and I'm here for you, even if it's kind of weird. So,” he plasters on a smile that he hopes doesn't look too fake, “talk to me. We'll figure it out.”
When he walks in the door, it’s to the smell of bacon and the sounds of the television blaring some video game or another. It’s comforting in the way only home can be.
Castiel can’t tamp down the giddy feeling quickly expanding in his chest. “I’d really like that, yeah.”
Castiel sighs, his head hurting far too much for this right now. He ponders ignoring it for awhile, but instead sends a text back saying "it's ok. i understand. we'll talk later. not feeling well today." The response is immediate- "thats cool. hope u feel better. call me whn u do?" He quickly responds that he will, and just as he's about to roll over and go back to sleep, his phone vibrates again.
When Dean so seriously says, "If you need anything, don't hesitate to call me, okay? I'll come and get you as fast as I can," it's like a helium balloon carries away all the stress and strain between them, because this? This is normal. This is Dean protecting Castiel from playground bullies and coming to the rescue every time Castiel's parents visit on one of their clandestine trips that only ever end in heartache. Finally,
Sam nods and tells him to call in case anything happens before he drives to the police station. A cop officer greets them and guides Dean to a chair to take his report. “This is Lieutenant Ward, Mr. Winchester. Could you please tell him what happened?”
Castiel arrived at the crime scene around 8 a.m on Tuesday. And he parks before he gets out cursing a bit as it's still raining. When he had left Quantico his boss had told him he might need an umbrella but wasn´t expecting this much rain and a part of him thought the other was joking. He glanced at the place noticing the news van and the few people that were there. He walked to the entrance of the mostly empty lot before a cop stopped him. “Sorry sir, only police can go step in.”
“Yes, my mother but I dint want to ask her for anything, We don´t get along but I guess I'm out of options… ”
“No, We can´t lose time, man. I need to go and get to the bottom of this. If I don´t get back here in 24 hours then yeah, you can talk to someone but for now, I need to know you will help me.”
“Yeah, I found one in his dresser. I´m sure it wasn't his, I have never seen it before. I tried to turn it on but it didn't work.”
He followed his routine with Ben, making sure he did his homework and then ate dinner before bedtime.
Castiel finally steps into the police station and meets the Captain and Uriel shows he can be an assbutt. Also, we get some interaction between Cas and Dean.
Gabe nods as he sees the box with the origami figures. “We will get Ben back… But I think we should call that FBI dude… he didn´t seem to agree with the cops and they usually are better trained.”
Castiel looks distraught at what he did as he remembers some training and moves to remove the gun from Jimmy and apply pressure to the shoulder wound.
“That's me, welcome to this shit-hole, hope you brought your umbrella.” He frowns and looks at one of the nearby cops. “Can you do something about the bulldozer? I cant hear my own thoughts!”
“I must have some bruises… nothing fatal, just sore as hell. I swear it looks worst than it is.” Dean whispers as he drags his feet into the room.
Pamela finally puts away the pictures and looks at Dean. “I have the results form your MRI, there's no physical damage from the accident but I´m worried about your mental health, Dean. I want you to realize that you weren´t responsible for what happened.”
Gadreel nods and turns looking for the stairs and goes up the stairs until he is in front of the room. He knocks and waits.
Uriel looks at both of them. “Exactly what time did you arrive at the park? Try to remember exactly, Mr. Winchester. Every detail can be important.”
“Congratulate Larry on my behalf.” Cas smiles as he gets out his wallet and deposits some bills in the basket.
He sighs and stands up. He looks to the other side of the room and notices a hallway, he follows it until he sees a door, without hesitation, he opens it to see a bedroom with a bed and a crib, next to the wardrobe there is another door. He goes to open it. “Mrs. Kline! Are you there?”
Dean finished supervising the men that had placed the tree on top of baby and then went to look for his angel. He couldn´t believe that he and Cas were an item after so long. It had taken a lot for him to actually realized that what he felt towards the angel was something more than friendship and even longer to actually do something, he had been a bit scared of Cas saying angels didn´t feel like humans and also that his brother would be disgusted but after a scary experience where they almost lost Cas, he had found it in him to tell the angel how he felt and now they have been together for 6 months. He remembers waking up next to him and smiling, or the times he is cooking and Cas stands next to him and he would hold his hand which is how Sam had found them one day after he returned from his morning run, he had only looked at them. “About time.” He had said before going to shower. Then it had been Jack who found them kissing in baby, he had been a bit confused but smiled happily and that was it.
But the wet blanket, it appears, has finally reached his limit. After a particularly shudder-inducing pun, he stands up and takes his phone out of his pocket. “Oh,” he says, looking down at it. “Sorry, guys, that’s Eileen. I guess I’ll see y’all tomorrow.”
Cas surveys his trays with what looks like no small amount of pride, and Dean elbows him. “See?” he says brightly. “Easy-peasy. I bet you could do this on your own, now.”
He made the homeless tax accountant look work for him, though. So maybe Dean shouldn’t be surprised.
“Yes,” Cas murmurs, his voice warm with amusement as he leans in close for a kiss. “I seem to remember you saying as much just a few moments ago.”
The echoing screams of the last two demons have faded along with the light when Cas finally lets out a breath. “You may look now, Dean.”
Cas is more possessed than any of the demons in this place. He dispatches the first two with ruthless economy, not even waiting for their x-ray light shows to peter out before moving on to the next opponents. Carl’s in there, but he hangs back, and a couple of the more intelligent demons even try to make a break for it. They can’t get either of the back doors open.
Said stupid grin intensifies. But Dean likes to think it’s a little more ‘ha-ha, you’re so gonna die, sucker’ than ‘stupid’. “See, you’ve gotten your wires crossed somewhere,” he says, enjoying this immensely. “My brother’s back in Kansas.”
“Yeah,” Baldy drawls, catching Dean’s chin between his thumb and forefinger. “Right. C’mon, Winchester. If you’re in danger, your little bro’s gonna be docile as a lamb. He’ll do exactly what we say.”
“I cannot believe,” he begins deliberately as he stalks forward, “that you left that there all afternoon. And embarrassed Sam with it. Then again, you can be exceedingly immature, so perhaps I can.”
Cas’ back is to him almost before his name is out of Dean’s mouth. He catches Carl’s wrist in his hand, the blade that would’ve sunk into his shoulder now stalled in the air between them.
A chorus of derisive laughter echoes from the demons lounging around the empty bar. There’s at least ten of them, including the one Dean’s talking to; it’s kind of embarrassing, but they’d jumped him outside the motel. He’d come to probably an hour ago, tied to a chair in the middle of this dingy dive. And Baldy didn’t even have the decency to offer him a drink.
Dean crosses his arms. “Maybe I will. You don’t know that.” Then a slow smirk spreads across his face. “Plus. You’ve put hard work into me, too.”
And they’ve got things to do: they need to clean up the bodies, get back to the motel, get out of town.
Kidding. Mostly. And Sam gets kicked out because he always eats half the cookie dough before anything even gets into the oven. Plus, Dean doesn’t want to have to curb his drooling when Cas inevitably rolls up his sleeves.
whenever he tries to help make any kind of food; let him anywhere near ingredients and cooking implements and you’ll have a good-natured disaster on your hands faster than you can say ‘spawn of Satan’. Seriously, that kid might not have anything in common with his biological dad, but the speed with which he’d accidentally turned the kitchen into an apocalyptic, tomato-y hellscape that time Dean had tried to make spaghetti and meatballs with him… it had really made Dean wonder.
Seriously, one of the best parts about having finally gotten over himself and figured his shit out with Cas is that now Dean can embarrass Sam
Across the bar, the door slams open with a sound like a gunshot. Baldy and all the other demons in the place whip around, staring at the intruder.
“I’m sure,” Cas agrees with studied nonchalance as Dean saunters over, pulling the towel off the rack with a sharp
Cas’ voice is deadly quiet as he takes a single step forward into the bar. “I will ask you one time, and one time only. Release him or I will smite you all where you stand.”
Dean grins, half at the memory of the Great Pancake Fiasco and half at the fact that they’re bickering in the grocery store like some kind of old married couple. “Yeah, I’m sure.” Then he smirks. “Don’t worry. I like the stove too much to let you kill it.”
They finish the grocery run and stop for coffee on the way back, Dean putting up a token protest before letting Cas order him some mocha thing with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.
He doesn’t let up with the jokes for the whole rest of the afternoon and evening. Cas knows something’s up, but he obviously can’t figure out what. He just squints at Dean, in a state of confusion that intensifies directly proportional to the number of gleeful puns Dean makes. “I just gave him a helping hand, Sammy”, “I really made a mark”, and “I had my hands full” are some of the standout ones; Sam only ends up eating three cookies instead of his usual eight because of it, which is just
“Close your eyes,” Cas shouts as the final two demons lunge towards him, and no sooner has Dean squeezed his eyes shut and turned his face away than a searing blaze of light blasts out from where Cas was, turning the insides of Dean’s eyelids a glowy, luminous peach.
Huh. Speaking of Claire… Dean texts the picture to her, suppressing a grin when she responds. Turns out she
As soon as the timer goes off, though, he’s gone. One minute he’s plastered up against Dean, kissing him out of his goddamn mind; the very next Dean’s left reeling, the entire front of his body cold in Cas’ absence. “Hey,” he says in weak reproach, head spinning slightly. “Rude. You ditched me for cookies.”
Dean’s head snaps to the side with the force of the punch, a fresh gout of blood filling his mouth. He grunts, then spits the disgusting, coppery warmth out onto the sticky floorboards and gently prods at the inside of his cheek with his tongue. It’s been cut open on his teeth; there’s that, what he’s pretty sure is gonna be at least one black eye, a possible cracked rib, and one helluva sinus headache to look forward to later.
“Don’t hurt Dean,” Cas snarls, and Carl breathes his last. Then the jukebox sparks and dies, plunging the bar into sudden, complete silence.
still smarting from that comment earlier, though, so he takes the opening Cas inadvertently gives him when he moves to his neck — seriously, possessive
Then they add the dry ingredients: the flour, the baking powder, the baking soda, and the salt. And then, finally, the chocolate chips. (Dean eats almost as many as go into the actual dough. Cas shoots him a series of increasingly exasperated looks, to no avail.)
Cas actually laughs at that and Dean rolls his eyes, hoping it comes across a lot more cool and nonchalant than it feels. “But that’s not the point. Do I get to lay on hands now, or not? ‘Cause if you’re still mad, I can totally go crash on the c—”
to.” How is Cas this scary-looking? He’s just standing there in his (Dean’s) t-shirt and his boxers. He should literally be the opposite of intimidating.
Over the cacophony of scrambling, shouting demons and screeching chair legs, Dean hears the jukebox in the corner let out a squawk of static and spring to life, the rainbow lights throwing colour onto the floor and the walls. The driving beat of a bass drum thrums through the bar, and a familiar guitar solo squalls in not long after.
But there still aren’t any devastating one-liners popping to the forefront of his brain, so Dean… well.
“You only did that because you didn’t know what to say.” And then he doesn’t even give Dean a chance to be offended.
forearms), and then add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time. They only spend five minutes picking shell out of the bowl after a slightly over-enthusiastic cracking job. It’s fine.
He looks back up at the balding guy standing in front of him, meeting his glossy black eyes with a scowl. “What was that for, asshole?”
“Nuh-uh. Not a chance.” The package goes firmly back on the shelf, and Dean starts walking again. “We’ll make our own when we get home.”
it to be a swat, at least. It ends up landing a little more squarely than he’d intended. But the point is that, shockingly, it
“Oh yeah,” Dean says, grinning, and picks the first dish up from the drying rack. “I’m countin’ on it, sweetheart.”
Carl howls as Cas squeezes his wrist, the knife dropping from his suddenly nerveless fingers and clattering to the floor. Then Cas grabs his lapels with both hands and propels him backwards, slamming him down onto the bar.
The lights flicker again, more intensely this time, and Baldy takes a step back, dropping Dean’s chin. “The hell is this?” he growls, his eyes flicking around. “What’s that stupid grin for, pretty boy?”
Cas tilts his head in mock consideration, drizzling some soap into the bowl the cookie dough was in. “It was terrible, and you know it.” His eyes flick momentarily towards Dean, twinkling mischievously, then focus back on the bowl in his hands. “If you want to impress me, you’ll have to be more creative than that.”
Cas shrugs dismissively. “Of course I do. It’s just that your mouth isn’t anywhere very interesting at the moment.”
Dean settles in to wait. This won’t take long, and he doesn’t have a knife or even a rusty nail handy. He’s pretty well stuck where he is.
Of course, it means that Cas doesn’t come back over once he’s put the second tray of cookies in. Instead he heads over to the sink and shoots Dean a raised eyebrow over his shoulder. “There’s a towel right there,” he says pointedly, and promptly turns on the tap.
They enlist Sam and Jack to help bring in the groceries when they get back, but as soon as that’s done Dean firmly shoos both of them out of the kitchen. Jack, awesome as he is, is a
Cas shouldn’t have worried. With Dean standing next to him and guiding him through the steps, nothing bad happens. They read through the recipe, cream the butter and sugar (by hand, because Dean is a weak man and Cas has friggin’
as the band screams the final lyric, and the music winds down as dear, stupid Carl conducts his demonic death throes on the bar.
Sam looks like he wants to have his brain removed. He stuffs his second cookie into his mouth; drowning his sorrows in baked goods, nice. Cas just raises an eyebrow at Dean and leans down to press a kiss to his temple. “If you say so.”
give Sam a cheeky two-finger salute and lets him scurry off to cry to his girlfriend on the actual call he’s doubtless about to make. Sam, for his part, returns the salute as he's leaving. (He only uses one finger. Which, fair.)
Behind the demon, the overhead lights flicker ever so slightly, and a couple of whispers fly around the room. Dean just smiles.
Finally, with the dough finished, it’s time to prep it for the oven. Together they load four trays with twelve little balls of goodness each, the filled cookie sheets taking up an impressive chunk of counter space. The sheer volume might seem like overkill, but given that all of them except Cas are veritable baked-good Hoovers, it’s a necessity. It’s actually awe-inspiring, just how quickly Sam’s bleating about health food disappears whenever Dean makes homemade baked goods. It’s like his kryptonite or something. Dean never misses a chance to gleefully rub it in.
“Um, I uh…I’m…” He started shaking, but Cas grabbed his hand and he began to relax. He could do this. “I’m bisexual. And um…Cas is my boyfriend now. We uh, we just started dating.” There. It was out there now. He watched the screen for his parent’s reaction, and all he could see was confusion on their faces. He had kind of expected that though. Not every day your grown son comes out.
“I’m sorry Gabe had to cancel last minute.” The regret was clear in his voice. They had originally planned to go to a comedy club for an early afternoon show, but Gabe got called into the bakery he owned with some last-minute problem he had to take care of, so they had no one to watch Bianca.
“Really?” She asked, beaming. “That would be great. I loved having dinner here. Its always so quiet at my house.” She said, a pout on her pretty face.
“Yeah, Cas…me too.” He whispered shyly. “I, uh…better go before someone wonders why we’ve been sitting here so long.” He joked as he reached for the door handle. “Night Cas.”
"I don't fuck care. Take me Dean. Please fucking take me." Cas was deliriously lost in pleasure at this point. Dean was doing things to him that he never experienced before.
Cas woke up slowly. He was confused at first when he felt a weight on his chest. When he looked and saw Dean, he relaxed. He really did love his boy. He remembered telling Dean he loved him last night. He thought Dean would have been surprised at his confession. He was happily surprised that apparently Dean loved him too.
The kiss became heated and he felt the younger man groan into his mouth in pleasure. Cas’ cock was hard in his jeans, pushing painfully at his zipper. He reached his other hand up the younger man’s thigh until he felt the hard outline of Dean’s cock as well and he pushed his palm down, stroking it through the other man’s jeans. He had expected the moan that came out of the younger man’s lips. What he didn’t expect however, was for Dean to also freeze and push Cas away roughly, as he jumped off of the couch.
“I’m sorry Charlie. I’ve been so busy with work; I haven’t had the occasion to stop by.” He apologized, smiling at the bubbly woman. He really needed to stop in at the convenience store more; She always made Cas smile.
gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.” The younger man broke out in song, making sure to put emphasis on the “haters” part. Bianca giggled so hard at Dean’s antics, and Castiel just shook his head in resignment.
"I want to know." Dean smiled at the blush on his face, reaching under the table to squeeze his hand.
“I just want to know why a thirty-year-old man with a kid wants to date a twenty-three-year-old college student.” John crossed his arms as he stared Cas down.
“You’re doing so good sweetheart. You’re taking my cock so well.” Cas praised as he rubbed soothing circles with his free hand on Dean’s lower back, holding his other hand tight in comfort. Dean felt him bottom out, hips touching Dean’s ass. “I’m all the way in now Dean. You took my whole cock.”
Cas looked dumfounded for about 5 seconds before he threw his head back and laughed. He laughed until he calmed down and started choking on a sob. He tried to calm down fast but a few tears leaked out.
Cas got a drink of water, giving Dean enough time to follow his orders and then made his way to the bedroom. He was pleased to see Dean followed his instructions. He went to the side of the bed and ran his hand through his boy's hair. "Such a good boy following my orders. Do you remember your safe word love?" He asked.
"Fuck sorry. It's just...shit. I'm mostly a Dom which you seem to love. Sometimes I like to be fucked though. I don’t need it. But I just wanted to ask if it was something you were ok with.”
“Sure, yeah, just um… just give me a couple of minutes to go um, freshen up.” Cas said as he stood up.
He finally made it to the school with only minutes to spare, and ran down the hallway to his new classroom. Most of the kids were already there and got a front row seat to the hot mess that Castiel was that morning. ‘So much for making a good first impression’ he thought bitterly.
“What is it son?” His dad asked. Dean could even hear the concern in his father’s voice and it helped ease his anxiety slightly.
“It’s nice to meet you too.” He replied politely “I’m Castiel.” He introduced himself. “This is my daughter Bianca.”
Dean kissed his lips lightly and slid past him. "Sorry, I was buying ingredients for tomorrow's dinner. Did you eat tonight?" he asked as he walked into the kitchen.
Dean pasted on a fake smile.  "Much better." He lubed up a couple of fingers and stroked them teasingly over his Dom’s hole.
Cas was torn. On the one hand, it could be incredibly awkward doing this with his roommate, especially after the fact, knowing they seen each other's packages. On the other hand, though he’d have an excuse to check out Dean with less clothes; something he'd fantasize about countless times. Would he ever get another opportunity like this?
He slept that night peacefully, and woke up the next day refreshed. It was Saturday so he didn’t have any real plans besides vegging out and watching Netflix. He was a couple of hours into a binge when his phone began to ring. He looked at the caller ID, and didn’t recognize the number, but it was local so he answered.
“Well, yeah. Papa and Dean are boyfriends, and since your Dean’s daddy I thought you’d be super old.” She blurted out, and Cas cringed at his daughter’s lack of filter.
“My, uh…my brother dragged me here. He is attempting to be my- um…what’s the word…. Oh, yes. he’s attempting to be my ‘wingman’” He air quoted in explanation.
“Relax, sweetheart. This part should feel good.” Dean tried to follow Cas’ command, taking a deep breath and letting his muscles go lax. He wasn’t expecting the wet tongue that was then pressed against his hole. He yelped and felt his whole body jump in surprise, and he heard Cas chuckle behind him.
Balthazar looks pleasantly surprised, intoning, "Oh, have you now?" in the exact same moment Dean deadpans, "We have?"
Cas saves them the trouble, grumbling, "I need some fresh air," before stalking off to the Braeden's back deck.
The rest of August and September fly by Dean in a rush of schoolwork, standardized tests, and hanging out with his friends. Turns out, senior year is actually a thousand times better than he ever would have guess it would be based on how it started out. He even manages to find a way to get along with Balthazar, thanks to Dorothy reminding him that he had once hated her, too. Granted, dealing with Balthazar is still harder than dealing with Dorothy ever was, but he's trying. Besides, Cas seems genuinely happy with the guy, so Dean has no choice but to bite his tongue on the matter, especially since they're all planning on going to homecoming together. Or, that's what he thought the plan was, at least.
He walks back into the school, his feet almost moving without his own say so. They carry him to the student council room, where he finds beautiful, perfect Anna Milton in all her solitary glory. Honestly, he hadn’t even been sure she’d still be here, looking for her at all had been something of a subconscious whim. And perhaps it’s unfair that she’s the one he’s sought out instead of calling or finding someone else. However, unfair or not, she’s also probably the only person he thinks he can handle being around in this moment.
Blush still burning hotly, he says, "Nice, funny, debonair. He's new to town. Well, sort of. His family moved here at the beginning of the summer."
Anna's eyes widen slightly, a smile playing on her own lips. "Really? So you and Balthazar are officially going out?"
"Exactly!" Charlie chirps with a bounce and a flick of her hair. "I earned those grades through hard work. Maybe just not the kind of hard work the teachers intended."
He catches up to her easily and places a hand on her shoulder. When she turns around and glares at him like she wants to set him on fire, he immediately pulls back.
"No!" Cas blushes even more, which he didn't even think was possible, as his volume makes Balthazar jump and draws the attention of a couple of other people at near by lockers. "No... We are, you just took me by surprise, is all."
This time, when he smiles at Cas, it isn't quite as shaky. "Yeah, sounds good. I'll wait just outside the door."
So, instead of commenting, Cas doesn't respond at all, letting the girls do all the talking as he takes a long pull of his beer. This only works so long before Dean starts shooting him questioning glances before finally straight out asking, "Dude, what's wrong with you?"
His lips turn up in a small, melancholic smile. "Ya know, for being so smart, Cas sure is an idiot sometimes."
It only takes a few more seconds of Dean staring her down before she breaks. “I told Cas you and Anna broke up! I didn’t say anything else though, okay? But I guess Anna was acting weird and you know I’m such a bad liar when it comes to you guys and he kept pushing. I had to tell him something!”
"Same," says Dorothy. "Dad's coming into town from his book tour tonight. We're having this big welcome home dinner for him."
Castiel’s expression changes for a moment, and it’s the look he gets when he’s weighing the pros and cons of a situation. Right now, it honestly makes Dean a little nervous, but he remains quiet, waiting to see if Cas decides to tell him what’s on his mind or not.
And Castiel wants to argue, but how can he? How many times has he run from Dean when Dean so clearly was reaching for him. To Castiel, somehow, running had become the de facto answer.
No beta, and given this past week and that I'm currently only a half cup of coffee in this morning... who even knows how my own edits went? lol!
Castiel makes a mental note that next time he finds himself alone with Sam, he needs to impart the knowledge upon him that he should never set up two of his friends - it will just wind up being way too awkward when they inevitably break up. Honestly, they’re in high school! How did he not see this coming months ago?
Silence falls between them for a few beats before, softly, Charlie says, "You should talk to him, you know."
Mary startles, stiffening in surprise before turning around and angling his face to look into hers. “Dean, what’s wrong?”
Cas glances out of the corner of his eye at Charlie, and her expression is all concern and sympathy. He feels guilty immediately. Even if Dean is possibly deserving of his lies, Charlie most certainly isn't.
So, summer before senior year has an interesting, if not altogether awful, sense of melancholy about it, and instead of amping Cas up for his last year of high school, he instead finds himself wholly dreading it. Yet, somehow, he still finds himself being dragged to a party at Lisa Braeden's house the last weekend before they're due back in school (no one can ever make him admit that Charlie's winning argument had been that Dean will be there).
Dean stands there staring after Cas for untold moments before he shakes himself out of his daze and heads to the cafeteria. Maybe someone else he knows came in early too.
," Dorothy emphasizes the statement with a hard look at her girlfriend, "some of us actually have to make an effort."
"Dean, how was your weekend?" Castiel asks, not letting the awkward lull that wants to fall into the conversation happen. He's not sure why he's so desperate to cover for Anna, except that he guesses he's also covering for himself. He doesn't think he can feel more like the scum of the Earth.
Sam and Dean both look at him in concern when he climbs back into the car, and Castiel isn’t sure if it has something to do with a look he probably has on his face or maybe taking too long, but before either of them can ask something, he heads them off by saying, “Sorry I took so long. I had to find a pen so I could leave Grandmother a note.”
Charlie huffs out a pout. "Dean Winchester, I swear to God that if you tell me you're busy tonight, I will make your life hell, and I'll recruit Sam to help for when I'm not around."
because in all honesty, that is about all he amounts to to Anna, no matter how much he means to Cas.
As soon as the boy sits, Anna turns her smile to the rest of the table. "Guys, this is Balthazar. His family moved in next door to mine at the start of the summer."
He’s cut off by Dean’s arms around him, Dean’s face buried in the space between his neck and shoulder. Slowly, carefully, nervously, Castiel raises his arms to stiffly return the hug.
This seems to take Balthazar aback, his head drawing back as he blinks in surprise. It’s only for a moment though, because then his face is twisting into an angry sort of snarl.
Still looking for a beta for at least this fic, if not more. If you are interested, you can either let me know in a comment or hit me up at one of the locations below.
He narrows his eyes at her. "As flattering as it is that you thought of me, what makes you think I want to be here any more than I wanted to be there?" He doesn't ask what he wanted to, which is where was this so-called consideration all summer while she'd been hogging his best friend.
Cas chances a glance at his abandoned book, thinks on forgiveness and new beginnings, about how Dean is with Anna and ignored him all summer, and about how wonderful Balth has always been to him. “I want to see you,” he finally says around the quickly forming lump in his throat. “Can I see you?”
Far too giddy to even bother pretending bed is an option, Cas sits down on the steps leading up the porch and pulls out his phone. He's sure Charlie is dying to know all the details, and he's honestly dying to tell her about them.
Anna smiles sardonically. “He didn’t tell you? Guess he wouldn’t, it would lead to you asking questions he probably felt he couldn’t answer. But yes, I broke up with him. I could see how he felt for you, and it just wasn’t fair to any of us for me to hold on, you know?”
Dean shrugs. "Eh, boring as hell. Watched Sammy run himself ragged to get ready for the start of school. Thought the kid was gonna have a cow about his binders not being properly color coordinated."
Anna shakes her head and plasters on a weak excuse for a smile. "No, not really. I just... I don't know... I think he's not that into me."
Dean raises an eyebrow. "Cas, I know you're busy and all, but come on, you can take a break from studying long enough to hang with your friends."
Castiel shakes his head. “I mean, not really. We sort of talked about it once, when we were...” He glances shyly at Dean and then away again. “I'm sorry, this is really awkward isn't it?”
Dean nods. “That’s fair.” He breaths in and out, steeling his nerves and clenching and unclenching his fists. “I, um….” He pauses again, but Mary doesn’t interrupt. She just waits patiently for him to continue. He watches her and she watches him.
He still leads the way out of the school and to Balthazar’s parked car, staying a few steps ahead of Balthazar the whole time. He does, however, have to wait for Balthazar to unlock the car before he can get in, a fact which only spurs his ire. As soon as he’s able to, he throws himself into the passenger seat, slamming the door and crossing his arms over his chest, staring resolutely ahead.
“Cas and I are going for a walk, we’ll be back in a little bit,” Dean calls out to whichever family member happens to hear him.
“Cassie, I’m not feeling well, maybe we should call it a day. I’ll drive you home.” It’s a lie, Cas knows that, but it’s also an out for the day. His shoulders sag though because it is just that - for the day.
By the time Dean pulls up in front of Castiel's house to drop him off, Cas feels set to vibrate out of his own skin. Somehow though, it all stops the moment Cas turns to Dean to say goodbye. There's something so serious in the other boy's expression as he tells Cas he hopes he has a good time, and it leaves Castiel grasping at straws, somehow feeling both comforted that his friend finally seems to be making an effort about all this, as well as scared at just what the depth of such an expression means. It all leaves the air in the car feeling charged.
When the Impala pulls up in front of Cas's house, Dean slides her into park and turns to look Castiel in the face.
On top of the brains, they're both Grade-A hotties in their own right, and could have their pick of anyone in the school. Oddly, the both of them seldom date. Anna told Dean early on that he was only like her second boyfriend or something (though whoever her last boyfriend had been must have taught her a lot because hot damn), and Dean is certain that he's never seen Cas have an interest in anyone (though he's seen plenty of pretty girls bat their eyelashes at the oblivious guy, and Dean swears he isn't jealous of the attention).
Oh yeah, he thinks, as it is with sudden, startling, eagle-vision clarity that he realizes every issue he’s ever had with Balthazar stems from jealousy. The very same jealousy that slams into him and sears through his veins as Balthazar puts an arm around Cas. It’s nausea-inducing and just so much worse now that he’s actually aware of his feelings.
Before any of them can say anything though, Cas gathers his things and as he stands, says, “I’m going to the library.”
“I don’t understand. Why do you want me to say my name?” comes Cas’s tinny, far away voice, followed by the sounds of keys mashing. Dean smiles, remembering the day Cas got his phone, a birthday present from his grandmother. Dean and Charlie had been trying to surprise him with it, and when Cas had figured out what was happening, he’s wrestled them for the phone. It made Dean feel good to know Cas had never gotten rid of the memory.
As soon as the door closes behind Cas, Charlie's teasing ends as well. The silence that falls is tense, and for the life of him, Dean can't figure out why.
Dean’s a little hazy on numbers right now - things like what time is is and what number beer he’s just polished off evading him - which is why he’s so eternally grateful for cellphones. He doesn’t have to remember Castiel’s phone number; all he has to do is press that nice little call button while Cas’s name is highlighted. He’d wanted to text, but fuuuuuuuuuuuck, numbers ain’t got shit on letters.
She suddenly pushes off the railing, setting a heavy gaze on him. "So since you look like you're having about as much fun as a bag of wet cats, and I'm feeling about the same, what do you say we get out of here?"
Walking into his house, Castiel takes note of the locked door and silence. Grandmother isn’t home then. He takes a short detour to the kitchen, and, sure enough, there is a note on the fridge from her. In his quick scan of it he catches words like “church” and “bake sale,” so it’s all innocuous enough.
He regrets the decision as soon as the pillow comes over the edge of the bed and slaps him in the face. "Don't play dumb with me, Winchester!" Charlie admonishes.
Even if he isn’t particularly looking forward to spending time alone with Castiel, it isn’t like Dean is actively avoiding him. Which, in all honesty, is probably how he winds up with Cas just standing there when he closes the door to his locker.
“Yeah, Charlie, gotta side with your girlfriend on this one,” Dean says, and before anyone can look at him like he has two heads, he adds, “she’s way too much of a stick in the mud for all that.”
At this, Dean finally turns around to face him, face awash in disbelief and irritation and maybe some sort of desperation. “That’s what - Are you freaking - Jesus, Cas! It’s not like you exactly acted like you wanted me to!”
“So imagine my surprise when I wake up this morning to find you gone without a word,” Balthazar says in place of a greeting. He says it casually, but Cas can hear the traces of hurt and accusation simmering just underneath.
Before she can say or do anything else, he sighs and says, “Lunch is going to be awkward, isn’t it?”
“After today? Yeah, yeah, I think it is.” Castiel turns to storm off. He doesn’t get far before Balthazar is grabbing his shoulder to stop him or slow him down. It doesn’t really matter which; either way, it infuriates Castiel further.
“Nothing,” she answers with that fake ass smile, and it sort of pisses him off. He’s used to Anna lying to a lot of people about a lot of things, but he usually isn’t one of them.
“Not ‘like,’ ‘love,’” Charlie corrects. Then in exasperation she asks, “And how have we seriously grown up together and you don’t know that you don’t have to be gay to like guys?”
Dean scowls at her. "What are you talking about? She's my girlfriend. It's kind of obvious we're going together."
Castiel is pretty sure that Sam’s eye roll is the most impressive one he’s ever seen. “Dean, seriously? I’m fourteen!”
He downs the rest of his beer on the way to the door, grabbing another bottle before heading outside. Popping the cap, he leans against the deck's railing, pointedly ignoring the rutting couples around him and wishing he had something stronger in his hand besides the beer. He manages about ten minutes outside before someone invades his personal space. Expecting it to be Charlie, he's surprised to find an oddly familiar looking blonde girl leaning with her back against the railing and smiling at him.
"S'cool." Dean Winchester, ladies and gentleman, douchebag extraordinaire, making best friends feel guilty for their relationships since 2009!
As it turns out, there is a different sort of party going on at the park, one that assures Cas that April does indeed know about Anna's habit since the redhead is sitting with a group of people, passing a joint off to a blonde guy to her right.  He can't help raising an eyebrow at her as he walks up.
So, uh.... I only sort of died? Long story short, I had basically what amounts to an emotional and mental break down, fell into a pretty deep and long-lasting bout of depression, quit my job, started a new one that gave me far less free time, and struggled with writers block for.... what, like two years? So uh.... I'm back though!? :D ???
“Okay, son but after this, we really need to go. We still have to go visit your uncles. Pick a horse and get on while I go for the ticket.” He smiles and watches him for a second before walking to the boot to pay for the ride. He turns and goes to stand in front of his son waiting for the ride to start.
“Not really, maybe just more ink, the last bottle is almost over.” Sam walks with him to the main road.
Dean looks at the paper and examines the picture which is in black and white. He tells her it looks like a bat, he expects her to say that he is incorrect or something but she doesn't and shows him another picture. They continue with the pictures for what feels like an eternity, some pictures for him are easy to recognize an animal or even people but others take him a bit to see something.
“Listen, your son's probably just run off and he'll turn up in a couple of hours, and if not then we have about four days to find him alive,” Uriel comments before he walks away from them.
Castiel nods and goes to the back near an electric tower and sees a man wearing a suit and coat. “Lieutenant Uriel Muller? I´m agent Castiel Novak from the FBI, I stopped at your office earlier today but they told me you were at the crime scene.”
“I guess I can do that and I can make you change it if you went overboard,” Sam said and walks with him out of the kitchen after the small angel started to walk in the hallway.
Dean sits down. “It was this afternoon, I went to the park with my son Ben. We played together for a while and then he wanted to go on the carousel, so I put him on one of the wooden horses … and when I turned back, Ben had disappeared.”
“I think it has to do with the fact that this is a vessel and I have a good control of it,” Cas answers with a shrug. He looks at the other people that are there and sees a woman doing jumps in the center. “Here, give me your hand. You need to keep your weight more balanced.”
“I guess it wasn’t so bad,” Dean said as they are sitting on a bench getting rid of their skates. He grabs his boots and looks at him.
She nods and with that Gadreel leaves the room, he stops to look for the cell phone and once he finds it, he leaves hoping things will get better for the small family.
Dean nods and waves at him before he left on the two hours trip. When he arrived at the next town, he heard there was a commotion, apparently, the Lord of the Kingdome was visiting the town and there was going to be some kind of celebration tonight. Dean saw it as and advantage since that meant rich people and he was sure they would appreciate fresh produce, he went to the main plaza and set his stand, it was late afternoon when he saw a man that stands out against the people, he had black hair and obviously had money.
“Doctor Barns will see you soon .” She smiles at him and goes back to whatever she was doing before Dean arrived.
He gets back and picks Jack in his arms and holds him before offering him the bottle of milk, Jack uses his arms to try and hold the bottle, before he finishes it, he starts to fall asleep, Gadreel remembers to move the bottle so Jack finishes it and then moves to burp him, he barely remembers to use a towel to cover his shoulder. He then cradles Jack and slowly lays him on his bassinet.
“Sorry about the mess. Can I ask who was he?” He asks as he cleans his face using a handkerchief he had in his coat.
Zachariah nods and looks at Uriel. “I know we don´t need a fed but I need you to play nice with him and actually catch this man. We can´t afford the bad press anymore and if we don´t catch him it will be the third year without catching this guy.”
Gadreel moves closer to her and leans down on the nightstand. “Can you tell me more about your son? What kind of kid was he?”
“Oh hey! Sorry, I didn´t see you, how can I help you?” he uses his coverall to clean his dirty hands.
Dean was in the kitchen putting away some groceries he had gotten to try and make a Christmas dinner, he had gotten a turkey that according to an old lady he needed to unfreeze now so it would be ready for the 24
“Dean… look, man, I get it but just… be careful. I can distract the journalists and you take my car but I need you to call me if you do find something.”
He stood up and placed his hat on his face before he grabbed his guitar and walked to the stage, he smiled as he listens to the crow clap and the lights dimmed before he started to play a song, he scanned the crow and couldn’t help but to notice a man, wearing trench coat near the left of the stage, he kept playing but he would stare at the guy, he had something that drawled him towards him.
Pamela nods as she listens to him and looks at her clock for a second. “Is there something else, Dean?”
“Aww Sammy, you wound me!” He said dramatically and chuckles when the other just rolls his eyes. “What? Can´t I see my boyfriend during the holidays?”
Dean doesn´t answer right away as he sees a black-haired man approaching the desk. If he hadn´t been so worried about Ben he would have said that the new guy was handsome. “He was wearing a coat...A black coat and a pair of green pants.”
Dean nods thinking about that, he and Cas were good but he still has a bit of trouble showing affection outside of their room.
Castiel looks from one to the other as Jimmy keeps talking about how Uriel is the Anti-Christ, he sees how the man is losing it and shoots.
“Well there’s the mention of the superhuman powers which kind of applies to me and it mentions a weakness. I do have a weakness, Dean, all of my brothers have mentioned it and I didn´t want to believe them.” Castiel sighs and closes his eyes before he stares at green eyes. “You are my kryptonite, Dean.”
Castiel went to his hotel room and got changed into a clean suit and then decided to go explore the city a little bit since he would be staying there for a while even though he hoped the case would be over soon. He found a lot of nice places to eat and saw stopped for lunch at a nice restaurant before he spotted a candy shop where he found some really nice chocolate and the owner seemed to be a pretty weird man called Gabriel who had been dancing to a pop song when he had entered the store. Then he had seen the time and decided to relax in his room before he finally went to the station. He grabbed his umbrella before he got in his rental car and drove to the police station. He arrived and asked the receptionist who told him that Zachariah was busy in his office and to please sit down and wait. Castiel nods and sits on a chair near the desk. He looks around at the station seeing how the main offices are around the edge forming a rectangle and in the middle there are cubicles.
A few hours later he wakes up to the sound of rain and he looks around confused just to realized that he is in the garden with no memories of how he got there, he checks his watch it's 2 a.m. This is something that has been happening now for a few months after the accident with Emma, his shrink said it was PT SD but that with time it would get better for him and to just keep taking his meds but he does not think its actually working, the good thing is that he hasn't had an episode at work. He sees the clock and goes back to his house for a shower and to try to catch some rest.
He picks him up and places him on the changing table, he removes the onesie and then as quick as he can he removes the dirty diaper and then takes a bit to open the baby powder. But he manages and then places the clean diaper making sure it stays where it's supposed to be. Gadreel picks Jack up and rocks him a little before placing him back in his bassinet.
Pam sits straighter and crosses her arms on the desk. “Dean, you suffered severe head trauma and you were in a coma for six months.  We don´t really know the effect of what something like that could have had in the brain.” The alarm sound signaling the end of the session. “Well that´s the end of this session, we can continue with his the next week.
“I found it and it seemed interesting, Dean. They mention something about kryptonite… and I couldn’t help to notice some things in common.” Castiel moves his head to look at his best friend.
“Not really, most of the time he stayed here but I always made sure he never met or got close with my clients. I was trying to get enough money so I could leave with him, give him a better childhood, you know?”
We get to meet the next characters of the story.  A private detective that wants to help find the killer.
“What? You better explain this when I see you at that place. I will close the store at the usual time and then you will tell me whats going on.”
“No!, Sammy, you don´t understand, I need to do this without them, they won´t believe me, might even think I kidnapped Ben… No! I will continue with this, I have one down and four more to go. I´m sure when I get the last clue, I will find Ben and then only then we call the police, okay?”
After what feels like ages he manages to arrive at the locker room. He looks at the ticket and stars looking for the right aisle. He finds it at the end and then looks for the number 1. He opens it and finds a shoebox, he shakes it and hears something. He sends a text yo his brother saying he will meet at his place since his house must still have someone watching his house.
Note: One (1.00) inch of rain – A light-moderate rain never reaches this amount, heavy rain for several hours (2-5 hours)yes. There would be deep standing water for long periods of time.
Castiel wants to tell her to stop, to not say it, but he can’t find the words. He’s too transfixed - she wears her heartbreak beautifully.
Dean kisses her softly before pulling back with a dopey grin and saying, "Good. Now let's get back to the car, okay?" When Anna nods her agreement, Dean slips his fingers through hers and leads her back.
As they're packing up their things after class, Charlie is quick to bump Cas's shoulder. "Soooo...?"
Cas may have been able to avoid answering his friends at lunch and through most of the rest of the day, but there’s one place he can’t avoid Charlie - AP Cal.
is about to happen. Instead, Cas rests his head on Dean’s shoulder, while Dean stands ramrod straight.
He checks his phone to find two texts, one from an unknown number that says "Hope you feel ok. Had fun last night tho. Txt me sometime ;)" He shoots a text back asking who this is, and then attends to the second message which is from Dean and reads "sry man. charlie n i talked last night n she told me what an ass i was all summer. can u forgive me?"
"You seem in a better mood today," Charlie says as she plops down in the seat next to Dean during first period.
"You damn smart kids and your crazy homework on the second day," Dean chides, wry smile on his face.
“Hey, you wanna stay the night?” Dean asks, jostling Cas’s arm to get his attention as he walks around him, taking his armful of dishes into the kitchen.
Castiel kisses him. It isn’t particularly long, but there is passion there, and it’s enough time for Dean’s hands to move from Cas’s face to the back of his head, for Dean’s fingers to card through Cas’s hair as he returns the kiss.
Castiel shrugs, reaching for his English book. "Besides homework? Nothing. Was going to see if Anna wanted to study together at some point."
Cas is suddenly no longer petulantly angry, he is no longer hurt on his own behalf. This is a cold, righteous kind of fury, the kind he could only have, apparently, in defense of the people he loves.
Dean’s heart selfishly skips a beat, and he clenches both fists, shoving them as deep into his jacket as they’ll go in order to keep himself from reaching out to Cas and doing something stupid.
“Jesus Christ, Cas! You about gave me a heart attack! Make some noise next time!” he shouts, hand over his chest as he jumps about ten feet in the air. The surprise is enough to distract him from just how close Cas is standing, at least momentarily.
It’s all a miraculous sort of distraction, but as all good things do, it must come to an end. Eventually, people start to file out for long drives home. He assumes his grandmother will want to leave once clean up is over, and Castiel will once more be faced with the loneliness of his own room. He tries not to let it get to him, tries to hold onto and bask in the warm feeling that the evening has given him, the reprieve from his own life and personal struggles, but it clearly isn’t enough. If it was, Dean wouldn’t be asking him to stay.
, face hovering near his after he closes his locker (he's pretty sure Cas taught her when they were kids because he swears she wasn't always this sneaky).
Balthazar is still smiling charmingly, staring at Cas in a way that makes the other boy's blush deepen. "I'm asking you on a date, Cassie."
Dean gives a small smile, but it’s no less heart-wrenchingly beautiful for the size of it. “You’re really gonna make me say it, huh? Well, I guess that’s fair.” He presses his forehead to Castiel’s own, eyes closing for a moment as he inhales before he looks once more into Cas’s eyes.
Dean’s warning to not get lost in his own house echos through his mind, and it’s thankfully enough to snap him out of it and take him back down the stairs and out the door. He has enough teenage mellow drama to deal with right now without adding his family into the mix, thank you very much.
Dean's summer rocks, all the way up until Friday night. He spends it mostly with Anna, who he honestly can't thank Cas enough for introducing him to. She's beautiful, smart, and a firecracker in the bedroom (or the back of the Impala, as the case often is). Sam is a little shit who constantly cracks jokes about
Regardless, they’ve somehow basically made it to Thanksgiving break. One more week and they’re free from it all for at least a little while.
He walks farther into the room, stopping for just a moment behind her before wrapping his arms around her and burying his face into her shoulder. For the first time since hitting puberty, he wishes he wasn’t so tall - it’s just one more thing that makes it impossible for him to pretend.
And Dean…. No, it just isn’t a thought to entertain. For so many reasons. Not least of all is just no, not possible, like he said.
For once, Cas lets himself fall apart in the presence of someone else, and it’s as uneventful as he never thought it could be. Dean says nothing, just gently leads him home, stays by him, stays his friend.
Dean fixes him with a heavy look - not stern, not frustrated, just heavy, meaningful - a look that tells Cas it’s his turn to just fucking listen this time. “Yeah, you did,” Dean says, “and then you just vanished. Died. I thought that was it, the last time I was every going to see you, and you pull that. And then Jack left too, and then…” He trails off for a moment, though Cas is sure he is about to mention his own death. He doesn’t, of course, instead skipping ahead to, “And then I’m here, and Bobby makes some vague ass comment about you helping Jack upgrade this place, but you’re nowhere to be seen. Instead, the fucking car is, which don’t get me wrong, I love that car, but - “
"That I don't know. You'll have to ask him yourself." Her voice is soft as she answers, hand going to rest on his forearm.
Dorothy finally stops shaking her head at Charlie and turns her attention back to Dean. "So, the reading, you do it?"
The next morning, it's like nothing ever happened. They're all back to joking and hanging out like they always have, not an issue between them. They get up and have a stupidly-early-for-a-Saturday breakfast before Charlie heads off down the street to her house and Dean drives Cas home.
Well, hadn't he just been wishing for something stronger at the party? So he offers her a small, half-smile.
"Bull!" she proclaims and exits the car, making a show of slamming the door. Dean would yell at her for it if she wasn't justified.
, he thinks, and he unashamedly says as much to Balthazar. Balthazar laughs, calling Cas adorable, and twines his hand into Cas's. Cas can't help the blush that spreads across his cheeks and the giddy way his heart speeds up.
“This is over,” he says, fairly quietly, and for a moment, he thinks he may have to repeat himself as a result. But no. No. Balthazar stutters to a stop.
They stand in silence, and things shouldn’t be allowed to be this awkward in Heaven. Of course, Cas isn’t sure why he thinks that - he’s had plenty of awkward moments in Heaven before, both pre-Winchester and post.
He huffs out a laugh because, of course, Dean doesn't know, but instead of brooding over just what Dean would think about his best friend and his girlfriend skulking about in the woods in the next town over to get high, he sits down on Anna's left, snatches the flask from her lap, and takes a swig, wincing at the sharp burn of the tequila.
"What do you mean 'huh'!?" She leans closer to whisper, "You guys were certainly all buddy-buddy Friday night."
Cas clears his throat, glancing down at his papers and then back up at Dean, the red on his cheeks not abating. "I just... I just mean... Give me a minute to gather my things, and then we can talk outside?" He stares up at Dean, blue eyes wide and questioning and so unsure, just like Dean himself feels. It gives him hope.
Dean knows he should feel relieved that Cas isn't being pressured, but, somehow, he feels even worse. How does that even make sense? “So you guys haven't even discussed it?” Dean asks.
When Cas makes it to his locker at the end of the day, he spies none other than Balthazar standing next to it.
Dean glances in Cas’s direction, rolling his eyes and smiling. “Kid’s going to be as big as a house soon with how much he’s eating.”
So Dean goes and pesters Sam until the kid agrees to have a Star Wars marathon with him to distract him from his loneliness (but of course he doesn't tell Sammy that's why, instead opting to act like he's doing the kid a favor).
"I say so," Dean grumbles back, slouching a little lower in his seat in an act of juvenile petulance. After all, he really wasn't mad about Balthazar. That doesn't mean he has to like the guy though.
When he finally shows up, Dean goes around to the driver's side. "Way to keep a guy waiting," he jokes.
When Cas sees him, he looks like he might cry, eyes all shiny and watery. "I thought... I thought you hated me," he croaks out, "and I wouldn't have blamed you if you did."
When Dean finally reaches them and, smiling obliviously, greets them with, "Hey guys, long time no see, how's it going?" Charlie, at least, has the good graces to grimace.
"Shut up and drive, Winchester," Castiel grouses, but Dean can see the shadow of a smile on his face.
The voice of the operator picks up, “Is not available to take you call right now. Please leave a message after the tone.”
But Anna does what Anna does best, does what is perhaps one of the things he loves most about her. She asks no questions. Instead, she just says, “Let’s get you home.”
It does actually make Cas chuckle though, which brings a small smile across Anna’s face. She sits next to him and snuggles up under the blanket with him.
He spends his lunches for the next few days in the library, Anna joining him a couple of times. It’s nice to have her back in his life, which is something that gives him further pause on the Dean front. He doesn’t want to mess this up again. Of course, he doesn’t even get to bring it up to her, astute as Anna is.
It's all terribly unexciting in the way that high school parties are, between horny couples hooking up in dark corners and warm beer being the beverage of choice. Still, Cas will always find himself grateful for warm beer in the absence of anything stronger, so he finds himself oscillating between standing against walls with a drink in hand and dancing with Charlie and Dorothy. Dean doesn't show up until about an hour and a half after they get there (and if Cas was counting, which he most assuredly was
