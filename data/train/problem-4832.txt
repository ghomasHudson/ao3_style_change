And with that outpouring, he knows that it is becoming too much for him. He needs room to breathe and think.
They went to couple’s counselling. Tony found the best and most discreet one in the city. They dealt with their issues. Tony and his feeling of inadequacy. Steve and his propensity to hide away parts of himself and his life.
“What do you care Steve, go back to your omega. I don’t want you here.” Tony could scream at the pain he feels when he says this but he will never beg Steve to stay. No matter how much he wants to.
He had to be the most handsome alpha Steve had ever seen. He cut a dashing figure in his evening jacket which accentuated his strong arms and broad chest. Lean but muscled; he had bright brown eyes and a radiant smile. He was the epitome of English Nobility but there was something about his manner or his way of speaking that made it obvious that he didn't enjoy these gatherings any more than Steve did.
Life chugged along after that earth-shattering revelation. Steve, foolishly perhaps, remained with Tony. He didn’t know what prompted him to ignore the truth and pretend that his heart wasn’t being crushed finer every day. It would seem that nothing changed outwardly, but that wasn’t true. Tony was acting differently and so was Steve. It was imperceptible perhaps, to everyone but them. There was a distance between them that had never existed before. Kisses that missed their mark, embraces that lasted longer than they needed to, and a new franticness to their lovemaking, like they would never get to do this again. It was Steve’s new reality and he wished he could accept it.
After what seemed like hours, he catches a glimpse of his friend. Now Steve knows that Bucky is in the ballroom with him and he’s nervous. What if Natasha’s plan doesn’t work? What if Tony doesn’t care? What if he is happy that Steve is taken care off so that he can marry that woman in peace?
Tony thinks Steve belongs to him. His heart is bursting with joy and as they remain locked together Steve thinks that he might actually win this war.
“Steve, Stark enjoys your company. You are the longest mistress he has ever had. He loves spending time with you. Don’t sell yourself so short. There must be something about you that he likes. We just have to turn it into love.”
Steve finally realised that protecting Tony from the world and its realities wasn’t his duty. All Steve could do was be there through thick and thin.
“Baby, I love you. I promise I will never again hurt you this way.” Steve is begging. But Tony knows that if he gives in now he will get sucked into this black hole. He will never be able to get out.
“We’re not there yet Steve. We have to work towards that again. We can’t pick up from where we left it. It doesn’t work like that. You really hurt me and I need time to heal.”
Steve was so elated, for weeks he had dreamed of calling him by the name Lord Rhodes used and now he was allowed to. His smile wouldn’t dim for hours, prompting Natasha to interrogate him for the reason.
But no Steve is hell bent on torturing him. He takes the globes of his ass in his large palms and kneads them while pressing small kisses on them, slowly inching closer to his hole. And then without warning, he licks his hole in one long swipe. And then there is not stopping the man. He slides one of his hands to lie across Tony's waist and one to his neck where the bonding marks lies, and Tony is now immobile. Not that he wants to move.
“I don’t think it’s mono…” the assassin murmured softly, remembering the one time she had walked in when Steve was awake. He had been curled up in the corner, crying his eyes out and trying so desperately to stay quiet. Like he was mourning.
Steve chuckled.  “I’m sure you’ll be able to figure it out faster than anyone,” he murmured.  “I have faith in you, genius. After all, a brain a lot like yours designed it.  Here.”
Steve started slightly at the outburst. He followed the man’s eyes, over to where he was looking. “Oh. I read about it in the dossier,” he admitted, lowering his voice as he sat back. “My— the other Tony never told me about it, so I had to find out secondhand. It stands for Advanced Idea Mechanics… started as a think tank in the early nineties, but Stark Industries absorbed it and paired it up with a research project developed by someone named… Hansen? Yeah… Whatever they created, it’s become bleeding edge medical technology, able to regrow entire limbs, but apparently it has side effects with certain people. Enhanced side effects. They put trackers in the people that’re enhanced, and the tattoos became a trend…”
You think he’s sick? Maybe he’s got mono. I had a cousin who got mono one time; he had to drop out of college for a whole semester to recover.”
“I’m not him,” Tony whispered after a moment, feeling a little crestfallen.  It wasn’t right to let Steve pretend he was someone he wasn’t.
Steve smiled against his lips, leaning into the kiss all too willingly.  “I thought you wanted to work?” he murmured, cupping his cheek. “Besides, where would we go?”
A chill ran down Tony’s spine and he shuddered, a haunted look glazing over his eyes. Just the mention of his name made him feel dirty and like he needed to crawl out of his skin. He didn’t say anything, but his breathing shortened in response, like the kid that tries to stay quiet under the covers so that the monsters don’t find you.
Tony swiped at his eyes a little, and when he pulled his hand back, he suddenly felt the softness of lips barely flitting across his.  Tony’s eyes opened wide, brows shooting up.
The assassin almost answered it herself, but the moment she felt the weight of that phone in her hand, she hesitated. She was silent for a moment… then she quickly got up and hurried to Steve’s room.
Finally, he sighed.  “Look, if I’m going to play spy, I need to know more about me,” he told Fury.  He wasn’t sure if he was going to fool
“You ready for me to come out? Or do you want me to stay inside for a little bit…?” Steve asked quietly.
Tony looked up at his lover with creased brows, not exactly sure what Steve was getting at. He moaned in protest as Steve pulled out, but as he positioned himself over Tony’s hard cock, Tony’s eyes widened as he remembered. He moaned loudly as he was enveloped in a comforting tightness, the walls stroking and squeezing as Steve started to rock back and forth. His hand instinctively grabbed Steve’s cock and began pumping as they found new pleasure in each other.
Steve’s smile returned, soft and subdued. “There was competition. A lot of competition. He was convinced that his fire died in that cave and he was just living as a ghost, even if he wouldn’t admit it. And me… After he punched me and nothing happened, with my name, it was only a matter of time before he connected the dots. He had a lot of questions. He was really… blunt, actually.”
Peggy sighed on the other end of the phone. “Anthony please don’t talk like that, look if you are lonely and are determined to hide out at home… I could get Cadet Rhodes to visit, bring you some of the class lectures- “He cut her off again, “I don’t need to distract Rhodes, he’s off to training camp after we graduate, leave him, I’m fine at home.” Tony could hear movement, on the other end of the phone, he ran his hands through his hair again, “I could get Steve to visit.” Peggy’s voice was quiet, “No.” Tony stopped moving, he hadn’t seen Steve for months. He’d thought about him, what Steve would say to him, he didn’t really want to hear it, Steve promised him he would find this guy but then Howard killed his own family. Steve wasn’t going to help with anything.
He took his spoon and pulled up some of what he could only call gruel, shoveling it into his mouth dutifully.  Steve ate beside him in silence. It wasn’t exactly a comfortable kind of quiet, but neither of them felt pressured to talk.  It was almost nice, for a time, if they forgot where they were.
He was extremely intent on the files when the alarm sounded, making Tony’s heart jump into his throat.  He looked around a little wild-eyed, wondering if he was supposed to evacuate.
Tony let out a breath through his nose, having a hard time cooling down now.  He closed his eyes, trying to stop himself from biting Steve’s head off.
He couldn’t hold it together.  He had seen the love of his life buried, he died in his arms, and here he was again.  Whole. Tony’s eyes darted to Steve’s left hand and saw that it was flesh and blood, still intact.  His arm was fine. Of course it was. But still….
Steve breathed into the defined lines of Tony’s muscular back, thighs clenched as he rolled his hips into him…
Tony looked up at Steve sadly.  “No,” he managed to choke out in a whisper.  He could see the devastation in the man’s eyes.
He sucked in a breath, like he could steal the air from Tony’s lungs and breathe for them both. “We shouldn’t…”
“Stop what?” Tony replied, continuing to give Steve a hickey.  He really didn’t give a care what kind of message it sent. He just wanted to lavish Steve with attention and ecstasy… and
He sighed and looked back at Tony.  “I volunteered for this because I hoped that maybe we could talk again.  It doesn’t help what happened in the past. It’s… Yeah, it’s selfish of me to think you’d want to chat with me.  I’m not even your Steve. But if you… if you
His eyes flickered over the brunet’s haggard appearance. So terribly similar to the man from his dreams. And the flag, why the flag?
They emerged in a room that was barely ten feet square.  The walls were clean, but barren, with a cot tucked against the far wall.  The linens were haphazardly done, like someone had only been able to pull the sheets with one hand, but there was a warm comforter folded on top of the pillow.
Tony sucked in a deep breath through his nose.  “And what if I can’t? I had a team before,” he asked, glancing at Steve a little skeptically.  He had a feeling that even though they needed him, they wanted nothing to do with him. What had his counterpart
Finally, Steve found his voice, straightening his spine and looking forward. “He had been buying up small countries, giving them defense technology in exchange for their economy and loyalty when the time came,” he told Tony, not making eye contact. “His net worth was through the roof, higher than anyone in history because of that. SHIELD didn’t find out how he was doing it until he’d liquidated the entire American government and proposed a world merger. No more borders or individual countries. A lot of people didn’t agree. SHIELD finally decided he was too dangerous… so they sent the Avengers to talk him down or neutralize him, if need be.”
On the second ring, they each looked at the other. Sam gestured cluelessly for her to take it. Natasha rolled her eyes, but she still had to mentally prepare herself before she reached over to pick up the phone that been little more than a reminder of a painful split relationship. If Tony was calling though, it was important.
When the last desperate word fell from Steve’s lips, Tony caught it up and carried it between them in a searing and loving kiss.
“When you get back, take him on a date, okay?” Steve mumbled sleepily, holding him even closer. “I’m pretty sure he’ll say yes~”
Steve opened a door labeled 3490, letting Tony enter first before he closed the door behind them.  Inside, it was soundproofed, with a collection of photos and paintings across the walls – most of them looked like they’d been done by hand – but Tony could tell from the marks on the wallpaper that a few had been taken down.  Probably in preparation for his arrival.
“It’s okay…” Steve murmured.  “Come here… no one’s going to hurt you.  I’m not going to hurt you...”
He sighed heavily, wrapped his good arm around Tony’s shoulders, and held him tight to his chest for a moment.  Tony was completely caught off guard by the hug; he stumbled slightly, landing him further against Steve’s chest. “Hey buddy,” he replied instinctively, patting his shoulder.
Tony sighed, running his hand through his hair.  “It did. For a while. But after we took out Ultron… the world thought it should be keeping a better eye on us.  Governments, actually, the UN in particular. I agreed. You… your other you… thought that we could police ourselves and that governments weren’t to be trusted.  It split our team in half. And we fought over it.”
Tony could feel the full weight over that whole catastrophe on his chest at that moment, and all he knew was that he wished he could call Steve.  And apologize. His stubbornness had ruined what friendship they had and it took complete
He cried with him, gasping and clutching at every bit of him as if he would be torn away at any moment. He would be.
Steve looked up at that.  He started to ask something else, but he closed his mouth after a second, rethinking his words.
“Hey, hey!” Steve whispered, sitting up.  He gently gripped the back of Tony’s neck, cradling the base of his skull and softly pressing his forehead up against Tony’s.  The cool blue light fluttered over them both, shadows cast into the corners of the room as he kept Tony still. What he wouldn’t have given for another hand…
Steve actually felt a tiny prickle of humor in his belly.  He remembered how much Tony liked to dress fancy. “Because it’s canvas,” he murmured.  “You seen Top Gun?”
Then, he shifted, not even turning his head to give Tony a cursory glance, and tapped against the table.  A holographic screen popped up and he turned, watching Tony’s expression.
The door groaned shut behind them with a sound of finality. The obscuring rock slid back into place, its surrounding holograms flickering to life.
“I’d like you to be in charge if you’re up for it. I noticed there were a bunch of LED lamps and such in storage and some of them aren’t that terrible fluorescent white either. I figured we could replace the fluorescents with those and rewire the system to use my arc reactor as its power source. The power usage should be minimal enough that you can run them 24/7 for decades on the reactor. No more blackouts. And that’ll free up energy for other things. Maybe Nintendo in the break room.”
He clutched the flag to his chest a little tighter, wavering on fear of being rejected.  But Steve had made him promise to reach out to him in this reality. He wouldn’t let his husband down.
Steve, on the other hand, lingered behind for his last few minutes of sunshine. He raised his face to that soft, coveted warmth, pulling Tony close to him.
Tony listened intently, his heart clenching in a good sort of way when Steve said that he loved him.  Any version of him.
It would have to be a lie he told himself to keep moving forward, because if he let himself think even for a moment that he screwed up and that this wasn’t worth the price he had paid, he wouldn’t survive.  Even living as an outside observer of some possible outcome his future could have if his life took a turn like this Tony’s had left a heavy weight of burden on this Tony’s chest and shoulders. He felt responsible… even if he knew otherwise.
The journey to Wakanda was different this time. It took most of the day, emerging into the sunlight and taking him to a separate city outside the capital. His briefing packet had told him that this was a typical transit route; he’d go through customs and by the time that Stark got the notification that he was back in Wakanda, Ultron would be shut down. Communications would come to a halt for three hundred and four seconds — just over five minutes for SHIELD to make their assault — an estimation of four hours to dig in their heels before Stark himself arrived.
Furrowing his brow, Tony tilted his head.  “Did he tell you about the palladium problem?” he asked, knowing he had kept that a complete secret.  No one ever knew how close he had come to dying from metal poisoning. Maybe they suspected, but he hadn’t told them just how sick he had been.
Steve couldn’t look at Tony.  “I want it,” he admitted, feeling like the weight of the world had finally eased off his shoulders.  “But… if it weren’t for him, would we still be here? Would you even want me like that. After everything.  I hurt you, Tony.”
Tony sighed again, hoping he wouldn’t have had to answer that question.  “Barnes was framed for setting off a bomb at a conference and it killed the king of Wakanda.  You…
“Start shutting the machine down, then,” Steve murmured.  He looked back at Tony, then down at the cave floor, almost self-consciously.
Well, he had thought so, until a sudden sound made him look up into the barrels of about twenty long-barreled guns.  He winced as his head pounded, warily looking at the people around him. He thought he knew these people. But somehow, they weren’t them.  A few Tony almost recognized – like people he had passed in the hallway at SHIELD – but there were two men that he would know in any reality.
“Is Fury going to give you hell for this?” he murmured quietly, looking at the symbol of their unbroken bond.
Tony took a staggering step, then another, and found himself moving towards Steve as if he were the last oasis in the desert.  As he finally got within a couple feet of him, his eyes welled up. Oh
He stopped kissing him, just enough to yank his shirt up over his shoulders and cast it aside. He wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist and pulled him close, kissing a soft trail down the man’s neck.
Reluctantly, Tony pulled himself off of Steve so they could get a better grip on the situation. “Hey, we both weren’t thinking. And I’m not ashamed of that. I’m glad this happened,” Tony told him, his hands cupping either side of his face, one thumb rubbing soothing circles against Steve’s face. “And I really don’t give a damn what they think of me. Can’t ruin my reputation anymore than it already has been. But I am worried about this affecting you,” he said, his brows furrowed a bit.
Tony gave a nod from his place on the floor.  He pulled the folders together quickly, knowing that even if he was exhausted, he wouldn’t be able to sleep for a long while.
Steve pressed a gentle, lingering kiss to the arc reactor. “I missed you…” he whispered, the soft blue light illuminating his features as he gazed down at Tony.
“Wakanda?” he repeated, considering the implications.  So his alternate self had found a way to get control of the vibranium there...
“What I’m going to tell you is going to sound far-fetched and crazy,” Tony croaked, fingers fidgeting against the flag once more.  “I was… gone. Maybe for only a few minutes. A few seconds. I don’t know. But… I spent weeks in an… alternate reality.”
A small smile found Tony’s lips.  He nodded. “Thanks,” he murmured, laying the flag in his lap so he could shrug the coat on.  It smelled like him.  As his left arm pushed through the sleeve, the brass ring glinted, catching Steve’s eye.  With the coat on, Tony held onto the flag once more.
Sharp gasps left Tony’s lips, his chest heaving and making the shadows dance around them again.  But Steve was well illuminated in front of him, his large form comforting. The warmth of his touch, his head pressed to his, and his soothing low tone managing to remind Tony that he wasn’t about to be tortured, that he was safe.  A choked sob escaped from him as he inhaled, shuddering and leaning into Steve.
“Come on Tones, tell me what you are thinking.” Rhodey was extremely worried about him. That worry felt like a soothing balm on his aching soul.
The thing was that Steve could never resist Tony. It never once crossed his mind that he would be denied. He didn’t understand how he was supposed to see his omega, smell him, and touch him, without sinking into that slick warmth.
And slowly Tony understood that forgiveness didn’t need to be bitter. It could also be freedom. Tony slowly forgiving Steve over months was freedom for Tony. Freedom from that oppressive feeling that followed him everywhere. Freedom from that chokehold that was insecurity and hate.
He opens his mouth, to beg or rave, he doesn’t know when suddenly Bucky is standing in front of him, with his hand extended.
This feeling is not because Tony isn’t paying attention to him or is talking about getting married; it is because nothing is different. Everything is the same. Two hours ago when Tony called on him to escort him to the ball, Steve had hoped against hope for a reaction.
If you guys have any suggestions for anything in this fic do tell me because I love to hear different ideas.
It took them some time to fall back together. Steve moved back in. They shared Tony heats again. They even bonded 2 years later. Slowly but surely, Tony regained his trust in Steve. It hadn’t been easy but Steve proved at every turn that he was trustworthy.
He had Steve in front of him, begging to come back home and promising to love only Tony. Words and promises he had wanted to hear for so long. His body and mind were yearning to return to the alpha, his alpha. But he couldn’t make himself believe those words. They sounded pretty but he knew that the trust that they shared was gone now. Some sensible part of his brain refused to cooperate.
Also I'm so sorry that I was gone for so long. It was the final semester of my master's degree and so I was very busy.
“But look at it from my side Steve,” Tony began gently, “logically, I know you don’t want anyone else but it is hard to feel secure about that right now.
“I didn’t sleep with anyone. I tried, a lot. But nobody was you.” Steve whipped his head up and stared at Tony with so much hope.
Bucky was the son of a minor lord and Steve’s mother had worked for them. The boys had practically grown up together, both ignoring their parent’s attempts to separate them. They were inseparable and when Steve signed up to fight Napoleon’s forces, Bucky had joined too much, to his father’s chagrin. They had exchanged letters when Steve was forced to leave the battle and now he couldn’t wait for the day when his greatest friend would come back. Maybe he would have a solution to his problems.
“Tony I don’t need this much, you are spoiling me.” He laughed, Tony loved to buy him beautiful clothes, pretty jewels, and whatever baubles he thought Steve would enjoy. He wished Tony wouldn’t do all this, he already had Steve’s loyalty and love, and he didn’t need to spend money to gain it.
Steve was going out of his mind, though nothing new there. Tony's smell was especially potent tonight. And when he lowered the omega’s boxers, he was pleased to find that Tony was already loose and wet. Knowing from prior experiences that his tired omega won’t wake up no matter what, he got to work.
Feeling his stomach churning at the thought he wondered if there was even a way out of this mess? He remembered a poem he had read once and it had talked about how love is like a string, once you break it you can never fix it. And if you try there will always be a knot present. Wasn’t that what was happening here?
It’s clear then. He knows Tony like the back of his hand. And he realises that he knows that Steve knows about the marriage.
Steve finally understood that the pain he had inflicted on Tony was a part of their lives but didn’t need to be the defining feature. That his love was enough and that he didn’t need to beg for forgiveness.
When Steve likes someone, he really likes them. His feelings, intensified by the serum, run deep. Tony knows this because he is at the receiving end of these emotions frequently. So Tony is secure that Steve loves him.
“Steve you made me feel like you didn’t love me. That you were just waiting for a chance to leave. I was about to propose bonding and then you do this. Why was I not enough for you?” Saying this all to Steve felt good. Cleansing in a way.
“Oh my love, you deserve to be spoiled.” His heart should stop stuttering at endearments like that, Tony used them liberally and with everyone. “But I am not doing this for your benefit; I am doing this for mine. The prettier you look the faster I want to tear off those clothes off of you.” Tony said with a salacious grin.
“I need you to follow my orders, especially when they are about keeping you out of harm’s way. You disobeyed my orders, got hurt a few days before your heat, and now you’re on bed rest for two weeks.” And with that Steve left.
Lord Rhodes is teasing Tony about the time he tried to build a raft which disintegrated the second it touched the water. Steve is laughing outwardly at the face Tony is making but his insides are squirming with nervousness.
Steve knows he fucked up. What he doesn’t know is how he could have done such a thing. Tony is the love of his life. Some days the idea of seeing the omega laugh was the only reason he had the energy to wake up.
God, how did the alpha always have the words that touched Tony’s innermost core? Those words were waking up a hope that he had worked hard to squash.
His omega was in heat and he probably had someone with him. Servicing him. Touching him. Would he knot Tony or would the omega refuse? Were they having sex in their bed? Was Tony calling out someone else’s name?
When he was just outside the door he heard Lord Rhodes voice, loud and booming, “Tony, you have to marry and Virginia is the best choice. Her family has lands, money, and a title. And she is the sole heiress of the entire estate. You won’t find a better match than her. It doesn't matter where your heart truly lies or who you wish to spend your life with.
“Of course not, why would a big strong alpha be afraid of a meek omega like me.” Steve said, amusement clear in his voice.
Then why did it feel like someone had gripped his heart tight and crushed it where it beat. He felt like he was bleeding out. If he was honest with himself, and he tried to be, he had always expected Tony to fall in love with him like he loved the alpha. He was waiting for Tony to catch up and then they would live together. They would share his heat and then Steve would swell up with their first child and they would live happily.
When he was finally released from the hospital two days later Steve drove him to the tower. They chatted about everyday things. Normally after a stunt like this Steve would stay away from Tony for a day or so, to calm down. But with his heat mere days away Steve was powerless to leave him alone for very long. Normally they would spend this time together, working on reaffirming their bond and preparing for the three days of heat but not this time. Steve barely looks at him. He even refused to touch Tony, citing his injuries as a reason to pull away.
And then the day when his heat was supposed to start dawns and he knew he was fucked. But not in the way he was so wishing for.
He took the dildo out of Tony's hand and slowly withdrew it, and Tony knows his hole is loose and gaping with nothing to close around. Steve then throws it away. Hmm someone is angry at the toy.
But it was the most curious thing, in bed Tony would cling tighter, linger longer, kiss deeper. Then they would sleep entwined all night, Steve not allowed to move an inch from where Tony had positioned him, lest he made the alpha growl loudly and embrace him more fiercely.
At that thought, he took the alpha’s wrist and dragged him out back in the alley. Maybe he could fuck his ex-alpha out of his system.
He stood to one side, watching couples dance, but having no desire to partake. The very thought of someone touching him was enough to send shivers of disgust through him. At least Lord Rhodes hadn't abandoned him. And then
The thing is that while most of the Ton hates him, there is a small group that doesn’t.  Young alphas have been trying to get at him for years. In their minds, anybody who is able to keep Lord Stark’s focus on them must be an amazing person to take to bed. Steve is disgusted by these soft little lords, who he could defeat in two punches. But Tony hates them with a passion. So it is a good thing that Bucky reminds him of one of those lords, just less soft.
Tony and Steve didn’t know how not to be a couple. It was like they fell in together, as a couple, naturally. Steve didn’t know how to stop himself from kissing his omega. Tony didn’t understand how he was supposed to stop himself from taking his alpha’s hand in his.
It was morning and Steve’s muscles ached from being vigorously used the previous night. He grunted in answer and that was good enough for Tony who kissed his cheek and bid him adieu, went off to work. Steve huffed, now what was he going to do all day? He supposed he could go and ride his horse for some time or go to the lake to sketch. He got out of bed and stretched. He loved coming to the country but only because he got more time with Tony. When he decided to work, Steve was left adrift in this large manor.
“Tony, if nothing else you have to believe me when I say that I love you. And you are always enough for me. You are more than what I expected in this life. I thought I loved Bucky and that nothing would be worse than him leaving me. But that didn’t even begin to match the pain I felt when you left.”
Steve's heart started pounding. That couldn’t be true. Tony wouldn’t agree to marry someone just for their money. Yet an insidious voice in his mind reminded him that all alphas wanted an heir and so did all lords, and Steve refused to share his heat with Tony. Breathless he waited for Tony's answer. Hoping that he would reject the offer, hoping that he would choose Steve.
But when he turns he sees Steve is crying too. And then Tony looks deeper and sees the bags under his eyes and the dishevelled appearance, and knows that the alpha has been going through a tough time.
Dancing with Tony was his absolute favourite thing to do. Okay, the second most favourite thing to do. Tony was a patient and kind teacher. And more often than not their waltzes just turned into a side to side sway while they held each other close, exchanging soft kisses and sweet words.
“Steve please go. I need time to think. You broke my heart, at least give me time to think.” He is crying again, he doesn’t know how to deal with all of this.
”And then... then he just launches at Dum Dum and they both fall to the ground and are wrestling while the rest of us are cheering them on.”
Everything is going great when suddenly Steve’s Aunt Mary arrives to meet Steve with his sweet and extremely conniving omega daughter Victoria.
Bucky got off his chair and knelt in front of him, “why do you always sell yourself so short. He would be insane to not love you.”
Tony mulled this long after Rhodey left. He felt better after speaking to his friend, and basking in the love and worry he had for Tony. He didn’t have an answer to his question but he did felt better than he had in weeks.
“Steve, you need to respect yourself. You are tearing yourself to bits over this man and he doesn’t even care. I’m with you till the end of the line but you need to see that this isn’t you. You need to get your gumption back if you want your alpha. And if he doesn’t want you then you’ll need it even more.”
“Baby I’m pregnant.” At first Steve didn’t understand what his omega just said. But once it sank in pleasure shot up and down his body and then the low pooling heat became a crescendo and he came inside Tony. Filling him to the brim.
They got along beautifully, giving Steve hope for the future. They could talk for hours and hours, about nothing and everything. They would go to balls and Anthony would always force him to dance more than the two permissible ones. Steve didn't mind, he loved being in the arms of the alpha. He could even bear the incessant teasing.
He didn’t know why, but tonight Tony felt tighter and warmer. The way he smelt and tasted was so intoxicating that Steve felt drunk. He hoped that tonight would be the night they conceive their child. These last few weeks have been crazy. Something had taken over him and breeding Tony seemed to be the only thing on his mind.
Mistress. Tony wanted him to become his mistress. Someone who he would not have to court and marry. He should say no. It was beneath him. He was a decorated war hero. He shouldn’t debase himself for a few scrapes from the man he loved.
Life chugged along. Tony found work to do. Turns out his brain for business worked the same no matter the era. Steve was astonished to hear that Tony owned and ran his own business, “an omega running his own enterprise? Is that allowed in the future?” Rolling his eyes at the comment, Tony pointed out the problem areas in Steve's account books. That mollified Steve and after that, they went over his work every week.
Bucky and Steve make their way back to Tony and Lord Rhodes and right away he knows something is wrong.
Tony feels spread open but in the best way. And after the week he has spent he needed this more than he thought. Both of them needed this.
“No. I told you. We were meeting as friends, not ex-lovers. The thought of anyone else touching me or me touching them is abhorrent to me Tony. You’re it for me.”
Lord Rhodes truly considered him a friend and thought he would enjoy the ball so instead of ignoring the invitation, he came.
“There Steve, right there.” He tries to move his hips, hoping to follow the sensation but Steve holds firm, not letting Tony move an inch.
Maybe he had shacked up with his former omega. Happy that his obligation to Tony was over. Maybe they were in bed right now celebrating. Tony gagged at the thought.
walked into the room and walked straight up to Lord Rhodes who was standing next to him and said, quite loudly, “Buttercup, where have you been. I missed you terribly.”
Turns out, the stranger's name was Steve and the field was his, so was the manor that the field was attached too. After showing the alpha some of his tech Tony was finally able to convince the man of the truth.
He had always dreamed of meeting someone like Tony. Someone who would choose to be with Steve every day, choose to commit to him in every way.
“Give me one reason to trust you. One.” He wonders if he is bending but every part of him aches with the need to be with Steve.
called for reason and he stopped, resting his forehead against Steve’s.  “Tell me that you want this. That you want
For a few hours, it was just them – the same way they had been for days, in a happy limbo – holding hands in the car and pointing out funny shapes in the clouds.  Married. Glowing from days of dancing and music and good food and sex…
Tony watched him leave again and tried to focus on the files.  Working helped. He had almost calmed himself down when the lights suddenly turned off.
All at once, the floodgates opened up.  Tony’s face screwed up as he felt his heart break open once again.  He couldn’t hide the sob that Steve would be able to hear.
“W-where are you? I can be in my jet in half an hour…” he pleaded, willing to travel to the edges of the earth to find him. He had already traveled through realities, what was a plane ride now?
Tony could feel the underlying current of overthinking in Steve’s kiss. His hand moved to rest against the back of Steve’s neck, his other on his chest, his fingers an inch from Steve’s bicep where the arm ended abruptly.  It didn’t bother him. At least not because of the missing arm. Why he was missing the arm was something different. He knew this was wrong in so many ways. Not because of how they felt for each other, but because they both knew that this couldn’t end well. Different realities, the ultimate long distance relationship, right? He knew that this was going to wreak havoc on both of their hearts, but he couldn’t find the strength to stop. His heart begged for Steve in his life and he had him now, even if it was for a brief moment.
It surged through him willingly, Steve shuddering as the dam broke and pleasure pulsed through him, leeching the strength from his body as only satisfaction could.  Almost immediately he knew it wouldn’t last, that he would crave more… but Tony had promised. That would have to be enough. That would have to be enough for now…
Tangled up in him, Tony’s fingers slid through his hair.  He smiled genuinely, glancing up at his lover. “Missed you too.  I do have a penchant for terrible ideas, you know,” he smirked, rolling onto his side to face Steve, his lips finding a spot on Steve’s neck that he lazily sucked and nipped at.  “Though you may get the credit for this one…”
Steve opened his mouth, taking in a breath to explain… but he came up with nothing. He hesitated, then sighed, letting his lungs deflate.
Steve was there — standing on the slick black asphalt — staring out at his plane in disbelief. He was disheveled and unshaven, a baseball cap pulled over his dirty blonde hair, dark circles under those stunned blue eyes. He looked exhausted and pale… but his skin had been kissed by the sun. Soft lips parted slightly in shock…
Tony looked the man up and down again, trying to figure him out, but he followed. “I take it I wasn’t always an asshole here, huh?” he asked, glancing as some workers quickened their pace when they saw him or turned in the other direction entirely. Some glared.  Others tried to fight the look of disgust off their faces.
Steve knew better than to ask for more time. He knew that they might not get an opportunity like this again for months, if not years… and while he was more than alright with that, more than happy to wait, to live with his new husband for as long as he could… he couldn’t do it to the rest of them. For over a decade, the remnants of SHIELD had lived underground, living like rats. Even with Tony’s new lights, they could still feel the oppressive shield of rock looming over their heads. Some of them had families down here. Kids who had never seen the sun for themselves.
Standing up and lurching forward, Tony made his way out of his room and down the wretched hallway.  He almost turned back, not wanting to venture into the black abyss before him, but he knew his only sanctuary was just a little further.  He stumbled into Steve’s room, the light falling across his resting form, illuminating his face in a cold way. God he looked dead.  Frozen.  Under the ice once more.  Tony let out another wheezing gasp, his fingers clutching the wall.
You know that feeling of dread when the otp gets together and there's still a LOT of fic to go?  *delicately sprinkles that all over this chapter*
Nick stepped forward, a brow raised critically down at Tony as he gave him a once over.  “Well, there isn’t a death beam coming down from the sky yet. I’ll call that a win,” he commented to the air.  The director of SHIELD waved off the gunbearers exasperatedly. “Give the man some air, wouldja?”
Steve kissed him back sweetly… and even for all the bittersweet weddings in the world, he couldn’t help but smile against his lips.  “You know, technically I suppose this is legal,” he chuckled warmly. “I am a Captain, after all~”
Steve beamed down at him, his lopsided grin positively glowing in the light from the hydroponics. “Thank you…” he whispered.
… but… Bucky’s my best friend, Tony, he always has been.  I couldn’t choose.  It all just unraveled and I wish we’d found out about Zemo sooner a-and I wish I’d told you about your parents sooner!  If I had, maybe things would be different, b-but we’ll never know now and I’m sorry and I don’t know if I can fix it, Tony…”
Steve shrugged at him, still keeping his eyes down. Meanwhile, Fury turned back to the billionaire. “I presume the Avengers didn’t help you hack and invent, did they?” he asked. “We’re not asking you to kill the other you. We have someone lined up for that, should it become necessary. What we need you to do is shut down Ultron remotely from Stark’s core lab in Wakanda. You already have his DNA. We just need to get that antique out of your chest, give you a few more grey hairs, and viola. You’ll be back in your reality in less than a month.”
it. It was easy for him to get fussy, but he sort of… got better. Therapy didn’t do much for him. It didn’t do much for me either. It’s not like anyone in our veteran group could understand or empathize with what happened to us… so, we stopped going. At least to the therapy group. We started… being friends. Friends that snapped back and forth at each other, but still friends.”
Tony nodded, his eyes watery with unshed tears.  How many times had he cried? How did he still have tears left to shed?
A gasped laugh of elation left his lips and he nodded, smiling brightly.  “I can make us rings again. One that won’t leave our fingers green.” Maybe he hadn’t experienced it firsthand, but Steve had dreamt it.  He had seen it all. Steve was Steve, and it didn’t matter the reality, just as Tony had been Tony, regardless of the different choices made.
Steve smiled, eyes glimmering with nostalgia. “There were a lot of those,” he admitted. “Just one time, huh…?”
“Good enough for me,” he whispered, his lips connecting with Steve’s again, but this time much more slowly.  He was still desperate for contact, but he wanted to savor him. To really
Tony wanted to hug him, hold him tightly and just use that embrace to feel better again, but he knew that their newfound relationship or whatever it was wouldn’t fly well.  He nodded, taking in a deep breath through his nose.
As Steve climbed inside, Tony stood up and joined him, glancing at the controls to see if they varied drastically.  He raised a brow at Steve’s comment. “Are you telling me that it’s going to be bumpy?”
Tony winced as Steve explained what had happened.  It sounded like something he might have done. Might do.  But he was starting to see that peace wasn’t good when it was at the cost of freedom; something Steve had taught him.  He felt responsible somehow. And he had never liked Barnes. He could tolerate him, but he didn’t think they would ever be friends.  He had a feeling Steve knew that in any reality. And then to take his shield… and the arm with it. Using it to promote peace while enslaving the entire world to his will with Ultron.  He now understood why his counterpart was hated.
Tony furrowed his brows further at the idea of going “topside.”  The idea of being out in the open was both worrying and exciting.  He wanted to see what this world looked like, even if it was under his other self’s control.  Actually, the technology might be even more fantastic without anyone in his way…. No, he shouldn’t think that way.  Nothing was worth what had happened here. But still, he was interested in seeing it all and he was breathing easier now that he knew he wouldn’t be trapped in the dark for days.
Steve bit his lip, grinning to himself as he held Tony’s arms close to him. He took a deep breath and settled, breathing in the scent of his lover’s pillow. He tried to relax…
A few tears streamed down Tony’s face as he continued to sob and gasp, but his breathing was beginning to slow and get deeper, finding the end of his panic attack.  He exhaled heavily, his hot breath warming the space between them, the light of his reactor making a bright little home between their bodies. Tony focused his gaze there, focused on the slow rise and fall of Steve’s chest and tried to mimic it, the action helping him regulate his breathing.  He would have to get up. He should leave. It wasn’t fair to this Steve to use him for safety and comfort when he had his issues with this reality’s Tony. But maybe, if he closed his eyes, he could stay just a little longer.
Steve rested his head on the man’s shoulder. “I love Tony Stark…” he breathed softly. “You’re different but you’re the same and I want everything that makes you
Steve shook his head. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “Fury kept that information to himself… but if he has more, he’s putting them to use. It’s the way he works…”
He turned from the stall to plant a kiss on him when he froze, his face paling instantly and a look of shock registering on his features as he looked over Steve’s shoulder.
“What kind of flowers?” Steve asked playfully.  “I refuse to have roses at our wedding. Maybe lilies.  Lilies are nice.”
Shaking his head, he pulled the blanket tightly around himself, thinking better of it when it doused the light completely and left him in utter darkness.  He kept the blanket pulled around his shoulders, but open in the front. Shadows danced around him, taunting him, waiting just outside of the orb of light, waiting to attack.  He wheezed, starting to panic.
But still, he closed his eyes, relishing the feeling.  Despite everything, he could still lose himself in Tony’s touch.  “Mmm… Stop that…”
Steve gasped, dazed.  Despite it all, despite everything, he found himself grabbing onto Stark’s body.  “N-No, no… no…!” he gasped.
He paid for their room, took the old brass key, and — after a moment of hesitation — laid a gentle hand on Tony’s back, ignoring the soft, subtle sparks at the contact as he steered them into the elevator. The journey upstairs felt like an eternity, the air charged between them…
Tony gave Steve a look and headed to the bathroom, stepping in and looking around, thankful that it was empty.  He waited for Steve to enter before locking the door, a frown on his face.
Tony stopped his kisses, staring at Steve’s lips for a moment. “…No. …We could have been,” he murmured a little sadly, resting his cheek on the blonde’s shoulder.
Now he definitely felt sick.  Tony pulled back the covers -- spotting the clean, surgical-looking scar just under his ribs, no doubt where the tracker had been inserted.  Clothes were laid out for him to wear.
went after him without asking.  I was told to take the remaining members of the team to bring you all back in.  Rhodey… got hurt. Most of your team was imprisoned. I… caught up with you and Barnes and found out that he had killed my parents.  And you knew. I destroyed his arm and you disabled my suit to stop me. And then you took him and left your shield. You got the others out.  …We haven’t spoken since.”
Steve gazed into his eyes.  “Everything I am, I give to you,” he whispered.  “I don’t need a cathedral. I don’t need expensive clothes or ceremony.  I don’t need a home, or children, or a document to sign. You have always been my home.  And no matter where we may be, or what eyes might watch us, I would have you beyond the flesh.  Beyond whatever waits for us. Whatever stardust and chemicals make us up, whether we are god-made or some incredible accident, whatever wars that the universe will wage… I am yours.  I ask you to be mine…”
Steve startled awake, eyes flitting upward towards the source of the noise.  With the glow of the reactor below him, it threw ghastly shadows across Tony’s face; instinctively adrenaline rushed through him, a fight or flight response generated by the ghoulish visage before him, but all at once he saw Tony’s terrified expression and
Steve chuckled and held his face between his hands, almost playfully squishing his cheeks.  “I’m glad.”
Deja vu hit him hard and he was suddenly standing at the front desk in Wakanda, schmoozing over the concierge.  And then the green atrium faded and he was standing in a normal London hotel. Tony gasped in a breath and turned away from the front desk, not wanting anyone to see the look on his face.
“You met right before the Chitauri attacked?” Steve asked, looking down at him in surprise.  He smiled faintly, massaging that one sore spot that his Tony had always complained about. “How did that work out? Tensions must have been high.”
Steve swallowed, eyes lingering on the toned chest and warm, olive skin that tempted him like an open canvas.  He couldn’t help but smile a little bit, reaching around to jostle Tony with his good arm. “Wake up, shellhead…” he mumbled, giving him a gentle, playful smack on the cheek.  “We have to get you some clothes before we can eat.”
Once Tony had joined him, the super soldier closed the door and pulled the lever, sending the elevator on its long crawl up a shaft that stretched into blackness and out of sight.  Steve looked up into the shadows for a moment, grimacing and rolling his shoulder. “We – him and the Avengers – only came to blows a decade ago. What was left of us was forced underground a few years later, but even before that… there were some mixed feelings.”
Steve pulled in a deep breath, then hesitated. The silence stretched on, but strangely enough, the tension eased from his shoulders, knowing that Tony was on the line. That he was alive, that he wanted to see him. For the previous month, Steve had been having dreams that felt more real than anything he experienced in his waking hours. And Tony had been in every single one of those dreams. Wearing a dusty blue jumpsuit with the SHIELD insignia. Sharing his bed. Falling in love with him. Everything he’d never dared allow himself to think about, ever since their victory over the Chitauri…
They sat on the bed, the flag folded and weathered between them, until Steve found the strength to take in a breath. He rested his elbows on his knees, biceps rippling with tension.
Steve took Tony’s hand, guiding him into a clumsy spin. He messed it up slightly, watching with a giggle as Tony had to hold onto him, turning in his arms. “Godspeed your love to me– oh my god, I told you I can’t dance…” he chuckled.
Their lips met again, silencing him. Steve opened his mouth hungrily, welcoming the familiar taste, sight, sound of his Tony.  It wasn’t the man who had shown him that he was in love. But Tony…. Tony was Tony was
Tony was a bit surprised about just how sexy it was when Steve slipped into his old accent. He didn’t mention it though.
Natasha glanced back at Sam. “He mentioned something about dreams. Something tells me we just need to let this ride itself out.“
Tony sighed.  His life was a mess in any reality, it appeared.  He was tired. He didn’t want to relive his sordid past.
Tony shook his head, sitting gingerly on the end of the bed, his eyes unfocused on a point on the floor.  He sucked in a deep breath, rubbing his fingers against the material of the flag. It soothed him a little.
Steve shivered, pleasure and sensitivity thrilling up his spine. He let out a shaky, almost overwhelmed sound against Tony’s lips, looking down at him through his lashes.
“We weren’t sure how big you’d be, so someone will be in tomorrow to fit you for clothes,” Steve explained.  “I managed to bribe a warm blanket from the laundry, though. It gets cold… well, all the time down here.”
Steve exhaled, relief washing over him like a rush of water.  For one perfect moment, everything felt like as it should be.
Then, Steve came forward and sat on the bed, head bowed and a somber look in his tired blue eyes.  “I believe you,” he murmured. “That sounds pretty crazy too. Doesn’t it.”
Steve smiled softly, feeling that warm pressure at the back of his eyes and just letting it go.  He felt the tears flow freely and met Tony’s lips with his own once more. He picked him up – wrapping his lover’s legs around his waist – and carried him to bed.
They didn’t go all the way that night. He wouldn’t let that happen. Not yet. He didn’t have the strength to last, anyway, but it was slow and soft and intimate, stripping each other clean of their clothes so that there could be nothing but skin contact.  Not to say that there wasn’t an orgasm involved; Tony’s fingernails left deep red furrows into Steve’s back, and in the end, they were breathing hard in each other’s arms, legs tangled and blankets on the floor.
Tony’s eyes widened as he lay on his back, staring up into the inky blackness above them.  He couldn’t help but wince, imagining how it really could have been worse.
The arc reactor is successfully removed in preparation for his mission, but then Tony gets some news that cuts his recovery time short.
Meanwhile, Tony looked up to see if Steve was still there.  Somehow, the room felt a little more dreary.
Looking up into Steve’s confused blue eyes, Tony shook his head.  “I am sorry… about that,” he murmured.
Tony’s jaw clenched and he paled slightly at the mention of the other him being killed.  It was unnerving to hear your death being talked about so flippantly, even if it technically wasn’t his.
“I-It’s okay, I have it…”  Steve took out a few bills and gave them to the driver. “Keep the change,” he mumbled, then instinctively went to take Tony’s hand and stopped, swearing internally. He stuffed his hand back into his pockets and led Tony to the door, holding it open for him and avoiding his eyes. He was more than confused. A piece of him wondered if he was going crazy.
Worry shimmered in Steve’s eyes. He unconsciously pulled his husband closer. “I-I’m sure I was but how? How did you… what happened? Did the portal open the same way as it did here…?”
pulled a knife from where it was embedded in his boot.  It was a last resort, something he designed for emergencies. The repulsors and other weapons might hurt Steve further.
His arc reactor glowed pitifully across the files strewn in front of him, casting them in an eerie, blue light.  He heard a clanking that echoed against the cavern walls, maybe metal doors being shut somewhere, and the sound reminded him far too much of the sounds of captivity.  Tony started breathing harder, his breaths coming out in gasps after a moment.
Tony watched him carefully, seeing the slight blush to his cheeks, the way his chest rose and fell quickly as he tried to explain himself, the way he ran his tongue over his lips nervously.  Tony was about to let it go, agree that it was for the best, when Steve’s eyes met his. Blue eyes that were all the brighter with the arc reactor illuminating them. His breath caught. Everything in his brain yelled that he shouldn’t do it.
Tony saw Steve’s hand reach out.  His breath hitched and he hoped, ohhh how he hoped.  Steve held the door open instead and Tony walked through it.
Steve shifted, taking a moment to collect his thoughts as he looked down at the steel grating beneath his boots. Having Tony so close, after so long, even if it wasn’t the one that had been born in this reality… it was jarring. What kind of world did he come from? What person was Tony comparing him with right now? Had they been friends in his reality? Maybe more? God, he wasn’t sure if he wanted to know...
Steve laughed mirthlessly, nuzzling into Tony’s neck.  “We should go shopping first… get some food,” he murmured, trying to fix his frame of mind.  “I want to take you apart tonight in the best way… and I don’t want to have to stop to reactivate our disguises for room service.”
Steve gestured down the hall, which was little more than an attaching closet, into a small room off the side.  “Yours is down there. So, um…”
Steve sighed quietly, tucking his face down against Tony’s shoulder. “You— Tony and Obadiah started slugging it out on the highway. I was close by, so I interfered. He wasn’t expecting to have to deal with both of us… but I took a few hits. I didn’t exactly have any power armor.”
Steve pulled him into his lap, sharing his breath with the man he loved. “We really can’t— mm!” he gasped, cut short by a kiss that made his toes curl. God damn
“You won’t…” Steve murmured.  “You won’t because you’ve seen what he’s done.  You won’t, because you don’t want to be him…”
He pulled the grating open and gestured him forward.  “Your room is just down this way. Mine is attached. So if you have any questions, I’m within earshot.”
It wasn’t long before they had parked at a structure that opened to a market that was suspended hundreds of feet in the air. The air was cooler, acting much like a walk in refrigerator and keeping the fruits, vegetables, and flowers fresh in the open air. No bugs ventured that high. It was an ingenious idea to elevate open-air markets.
Steve pulled Tony close, laying down behind him and cradling him against his chest. “Mediterranean tourist. Black hair, brown eyes, kinda dusky skin. They said it’ll give us options on what relationship we want to portray while we’re up there.”
Tony groaned as the super soldier wrapped his arm around his waist, his hips arching down against Steve’s with the motion.  The kisses down his neck gave him a chance to catch his breath, but he found that he didn’t like being parted.
Steve avoided Tony’s eyes as the lift finally stopped on the eighteenth floor.  “But it’s not your fault. You’re here to help us… hopefully.”
Finally, Steve let them into their room — an old-fashioned affair with dark red draperies and dust on the clock — and closed the door behind them.  Tony let Steve lead him, grateful for his guiding hand. He was in shock. He just needed a moment to breathe.
He bared his teeth as he looked out the window.  “I’m sure Steve is really itching to sock ol’ Hitler on the jaw again.”
“Honestly, it was irritating as hell. But it was also refreshing,” Steve murmured, smiling faintly in the soft light from the reactor. “He gave the group quite a tongue lashing. I pulled him aside and scolded him for it, and he punched me in the face. He didn’t know who I was yet, so he broke his hand. It wasn’t the best first impression.”
Wrapping the blanket around him and inhaling Steve’s scent without realizing he was doing so, Tony opened up a third file and began pursuing it.  A lot of it was what Steve had summarized for him, but there were added pieces about what this reality’s Tony was up to, his demeanor, and even blueprints of his buildings in Wakanda, where he would have to go shut down Ultron.  He would have to memorize these pathways.
“Do you know enough about Chicago to answer questions about it if someone asks?” he asked, distracted.
Steve blinked slowly… then he sat up, looking into Tony’s eyes.  He just wanted to lose himself again. He wanted to lose track of where his body ended and Tony’s began.  He pulled the man flush with his chest, kissing him slow and hard, hoping that his lover could feel his need.
Blinking at his lover, Tony gave a nod.  “Yeah… it is. He puts a little bit of orange juice in it and mint,” he confirmed.  “And he has three kids,” he added, now wondering what few dreams he had might have a connection here.  Most of his dreams were nightmares...
“They do offer tours.  They only go through decoy sections of the building – Stark’s original lab, the fake core of Ultron, things like that – because they’re made to be bait for people like us.  People scoping out the place,” Steve murmured. “But you’ve seen those old sections of the building in the blueprints. I’m sure your big brain can connect the hallways once you have a sense of distance.”
Then he just uses his considerable strength to pull Tony to him, all the while staring at him with a dark look in his eyes. Tony is too mesmerised to look away. Steve then uses his long and thick fingers to see how loose Tony is. One finger, then two and then three enter him, spreading him and his slick everywhere. He brushes his fingers on Tony's prostrate, making his hips buckle, and his passage clenches, as though to keep the fingers from leaving.  Steve groans at the sensation.
Tony will always be an afterthought to people, he knows that. But his relationship with Steve had fooled him into a false sense of security, that's why he had been unable to see the reality.

Steve cherished those moments the most. He kept replaying them in his head when he was away from Tony. That is when he truly realised that he wanted no other life but this.
“We met and it was like old times. After it was over, Bucky suggested we meet again and soon we were meeting regularly. And I still didn’t want to tell you. I thought it was because I was protecting you from worry. Turns out I was doing it because I was a coward and didn’t want to lose the best thing in my life.” He sounded so dejected that Tony almost comforted him. Almost.
So they spend four glorious days wrapped up in each other. The smooth slide of their bodies and Steve’s gentle kisses making Tony cling tighter to his alpha.
and the stock price for Stark Industries shot up so much the Board of Directors forgot to be assholes for a second.
“We have a plan; we’re going to get your alpha back,” Natasha said serenely, as though the task was easy.
Steve knows that he is purposefully ignoring Tony, which is something he never does. It would not be wrong to say that his waking moments are generally occupied with thoughts of the alpha. So he can see how this would bother the man.
Steve ponders over this and realises that what his friend is saying is true. He has lost his fighting spirit. He hasn’t been called stubborn by every single soul that he knows for nothing. One look at his rival should not be enough to scare him away.
He hears a soft whimper and assumes that it is him but then it gets louder and he realises its not him that is making the noise, it is Steve. He looks over to where he is standing and he can see an erection straining in the confines of the uniform, and his eyes blown with lust.
“What are your conditions, Tony,” Steve asked, still smiling and clutching his hands like he’d never release them.
No sex in this chapter but I did want to add. Would you guys be interested in actual sex scenes? Please do tell me.
“But Steve, I am working, I don’t have time to eat.” Tony looked up from his work, pouting at having to stop. Like a child, not wanting to sit down for his lessons, ready to throw a tantrum.
He had been planning to propose a bond. The idea of being one with the love of his life had been circling his mind and with a heat coming up he and Tony would have been one. He was sure Tony would have said yes. He knew he was loved.
Bucky looks at him like he is crazy, “I’m talking about how you are pining over some man when you used to beat up alphas for calling you names.”
Getting up when his body started to protest, Tony stretched. It seemed that the confrontation with Steve had put a hold on his heat. So he decided that a warm bath and a clean bed were the way to go.
He was unsure what his actions should be now. Should he leave Tony or should he stay and share him with someone else.
To sum up, the alpha was stunning and arrogant to boot.  And yet, Steve felt his heartbeat just a little faster and his palms started sweating.
Their plan hit a snag as they rarely got any chances to try for their future baby. And what little time they spent together was not nearly enough for anything to happen, what with the Avengers, Stark Industries, SHEILD, and a million other reasons.
Steve knew that he couldn’t live a life without Tony. His heart was tainted with their love; it would never accept anyone else. He knew that he would have to put up a fight. But how?
Tony kneels too. He doesn’t know what to think. Lack of sleep and his heat have left him slow and sluggish. He looks into Steve’s face and sees only love. But he knows that’s not enough.
Their love was rare and he knew that it was better to work through their issues than go out in the world alone. He would never find an alpha like that again. And he didn’t want to.
“I would tell you sir, but you wouldn’t believe me.” Tony decided that being polite was his best option right now.
How could a mere soldier with no money, no reputation and no title win against Lady Virginia Potts, daughter of one of the richest Earls in Christendom?
“Steve you have to see how difficult it is for me to believe. It’s Bucky. He was the love of your life.”
Tony looks like he is ready to murder someone. As Steve stops next to Tony his hand is snatched up and he announces that they are leaving. Steve barely has time to say his goodbyes to his friend and Lord Rhodes before he is dragged away.
He was regrettably informed that she was pretty, with a fiery temper to match her fiery hair. She was smart and extremely educated, her father sceptical about the notion that omegas were good for nothing except running a household and needlepoint. She rode horses and was rumoured to be an excellent shot with the pistol. She would take none of the alpha’s nonsense.
He had arrived at the club around 2 A.M. with a group of ‘friends’. Unable to deal with the empty house and emptier bed, he had called up some people up for a night out on town, on his card.
Steve spent some time just existing with his omega. But soon after Steve was ready for another round. He hadn't even softened up and the news that his mate is pregnant made his blood burn. So he wrenched his omega's legs apart and enters in one swift move while staring deep into Tony's eyes.
He stands up quickly and his heart hurts from being separated from the man he loves. But this is what he needs to do. He looks into the face he loves and sees love but he doesn’t know if will ever be able to trust the man. Mind made up he again utters the three words he had regretted for the past few months, “Get out Steve.”
Tony knew there was something about them that he should stop. But he didn’t want to. His days went better when he smelled that orange cinnamon smell on himself. He felt better when his eyes met Steve’s.
But anything to get the alpha out of his mind. Anything. Even though he never wanted to forget a second. So he continued to dry hump the alpha in front of him, tall, wiry, and brunet, as different from Steve as he could find.
What he can’t figure out is why. Steve got exactly what he wanted, his old omega Bucky, so why was he sad?
Steve feels like a fool; a fool for agreeing to this asinine plan and a fool for thinking that Tony will care. A fool for thinking that he could get the best alpha in the kingdom to fall for him. If it hasn’t happened yet then why should it happen now?
“The team is currently in Central Park, still fighting the doombots. Would you like me to relay a message to Captain Rogers, informing him of your heat?” Intoned the cool British voice.
Steve is so overjoyed at this that he asks where Bucky had served in the war. Soon he, Bucky, and Lord Rhodes are comparing stories about the war. And Tony's face is getting darker with anger with each passing second. But he doesn’t leave. He keeps standing there and then suddenly an arm sneaks in to hold Steve by the waist, and quite tightly at that.
Resigned to his fate, he got off the bed and straightened himself; it wouldn’t do good to look frazzled.
It was there that Steve finally realised how much he had hurt his omega by his insistence on keeping the various parts of his life secret and separate. He finally understood that for Tony, meeting Bucky was simply the straw that broke the camel’s back. That years of being kept on the sidelines had hurt their relationship.
But saying all that would make Pepper think they were co-dependent. And that wasn't true. He didn't need Steve in his life because he couldn't live without the man. He probably could. But he didn't want to live without how Steve made him feel. He felt safe, loved and cherished with the alpha. He was a better person with Steve. He knew that he made Steve feel the same way.
“Do you remember what I offered…?” Steve breathed, hands moving down Tony’s body, silently worshiping the movement of their hips.  “It was a while ago, but…”
“Do you need to use the bathroom?” Steve murmured, suddenly very aware that he hadn’t showered in a while.
He could feel Steve falling asleep beneath him.  Tony nodded, a hollow look to his eyes. “Yeah,” he whispered, holding onto him and staring off into the dark.  Mercifully, exhaustion finally took over and Tony fell asleep being held by the one person that would.
His dark, lonely blue eyes trained on Tony’s chapped, imperfect, beautiful lips. Breathless and craving another kiss. Craving more. He wanted to feel him, touch him,
“You son of a BITCH!  THERE WERE KIDS IN THERE!!” Tony roared, getting up violently and striding towards Stark.
His gaze actually passed over a man in a dark coat… then he saw the blue scarf, and his eyes darted back.
Tony’s fingers dug into Steve’s blond locks, pulling him down onto the bed, the flag pressed down onto the sheets by their bodies.  He couldn’t think of a more fitting place for that flag to be– tragedy covered by their undying love.
Tony could hear the exhaustion in his voice, and though he was tired too, he was used to not sleeping.  He contemplated the question, not answering for a few moments.
Steve swallowed thickly, his tired eyes burning as he bowed his head, running his hands through his hair, his suspicions confirmed.
Fury nodded agreeably. “The files are in your room. Nothing fancy, I’m afraid. We had to go back to paper to avoid detection aboveground.”
No… this felt like some kind of tribute. A twisted memorial to the young scientist’s fallen potential.
“Where the hell am I?” Tony rasped, getting up without taking Fury’s hand.  He hunched in on himself with another wince.
Thankfully, the cab pulled up to the hotel.  Tony really didn’t want to have this conversation with a third person potentially listening in.  He got out of the car, taking out his wallet to pay the fare.
Tony watched Fury walk off and shook his head. “That man is infuriating in any reality,” he commented before glancing over at Steve. He pursed his lips and rocked on the balls of his feet.  “Lead on.”
The days were spent memorizing corridors and perfecting his impression of Stark. He spooked a few people, even gaining a wary look from Steve at one point, causing him to drop the act instantly. He had it down. He was ready, even if he wasn’t happy about it.
Tony winced at the thought, wondering how the rest of that fight went different. Was he still stuck on the roof alone?  He shuddered again, closing his eyes tightly. He didn’t want to think about it. He still had nightmares about it.
Steve sunk his fingers into Tony’s hair, breathing in his scent, his taste, everything. “I mean…” he whispered breathlessly, pulling away just enough to look up at him, a trace of mischief in his somber blue eyes. “You deserve a turn…”
Steve swallowed, glancing between the interactive stations… then, he approached one of the princesses.
Tony winced, looking at the hologram with a new perspective.  As Shuri began speaking about the construction of the building and the repulsors, the hologram moved seamlessly, not making a sound on the tile while the tourists’ footsteps echoed loudly.  Hollowly. It was macabre.
He reached back up, holding Tony’s neck and kissing him back. Their tongues slid against each other, warm and intimate and hungry. Steve pulled away for air, the fireworks between them bright and startling, almost dazzling in the darkness. “Really bad idea…”
Steve almost looked apologetic. “SHIELD has a few contained viruses that he designed, and an early version of Ultron’s master satellite,” he confessed. “The information density is insane. Not a lot of our technicians managed to get very far, and it’s not much to compare with what he’s created since then, but Bruce got the farthest out of anyone. He said that if you got access to the blueprints you might be able to think of what improvements would hypothetically have been made by this time. What kind of upgrades would a paranoid Tony Stark have come up with? That sort of thing.”
…” he whispered. “No matter where you come from, you’re just… you’re Tony. You’re snarky and unbearable sometimes and you make my life miserable. But I love Tony Stark.”
Tony panted rapidly on the floor, the water spraying in his face and vaguely reminding him of being waterboarded.  He just breathed harder, sputtering. But Steve’s quiet voice pulled him back. He blinked up at Steve, craning his head until his face was out of the stream, allowing him to breathe, if a bit raggedly from all the steam.
Steve grinned at that, pressing a kiss to Tony’s temple and holding him close. His eyes wandered over the wall, focused on some point far in the distance. “He told me later that there was some kind of ‘historical fascination’ where I was concerned. He said that over time, he realized why Howard had never stopped talking about me and he
This was uncharted territory for Tony.  He and Steve had spent years bickering and throwing snarky comments back and forth… and smiling and laughing.  They had so much but nothing had never come from it. It wasn’t that they didn’t care, they both certainly did, but somehow they just kept it to a close friendship… until they parted ways.  It was something that he always regretted.
Steve sported a beard, long dirty blonde hair that he could’ve almost pulled into a ponytail, a haunted, wary look in his eyes… and his left arm, his shield-bearing arm, was missing from the mid-bicep down.
That was three months after they’d met. They weren’t Iron Man, or Captain America. They were certainly an unlikely couple… but they weren’t anything like that yet. They enjoyed each other’s company, ever since their fourth week in a veteran therapy group together. Their relationship was rocky at first. A lot of sass and snark and all at once there was pain and confession and a need to be close.
