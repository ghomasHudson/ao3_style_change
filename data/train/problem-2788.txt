And he wants to stay out of
Cas reaches work at 9:30 as always and he places a coffee cup down on Dean’s desk. It surprises him — he hadn’t expected Cas to get him coffee. Dean looks up from his computer, absently taking it. “Thanks, Cas.”
CHUCK
Cas looks at him, tilting his head, "Your escape plan?"
We just need souls.
“If you can’t hear a bullet you’re seein’, chances are it’s coming your way.”
WHO’S THIS!!
Locker 275 is a boy.
Castiel rolls his eyes, but with the hint of a smile playing in the creases of his eyes. "You forget yourself."
"Fuck! Where's Rome?" Paris shouts over the rapid gunfire, ducking behind a shelf. Dallas and Salem shoot at the SWAT officers and Dean, Crowley and London try to find something to prop the steel sheet up, still firing as well. Meg and Angeles fire at them from behind a mini barricade.
right now. The Shadow has Castiel
, but he feels happy and he actually likes his life and himself for once.
“Nice Louboutins, Winchester,” he replies, glancing at Dean’s shoes.
I visit the school pool at least once a week and I'm not even part of the swim team. I go there to collect snails.
I do not love Dean.
Violet considers it carefully.
“And there’s going to be Fashion Week in two months. I haven’t decided who will be going with me yet, but note down that Gabriel and you will definitely be coming along. Just in case, tell Balthazar Freely, Meg Masters, Pamela Barnes, Kevin Tran, and Charlie Bradbury to keep their schedules free,” Castiel continues as Dean scrambles to key it into his phone’s notes. The words are misspelt and shortened, skipping most of the vowels, but he’ll just clean up the notes when he gets the time to do so. “Help me check which ones Bela Talbot and Lucian Morningstar will be attending.”
Cas nods slowly, saying, "That happened with Anna once, and her ex-boyfriend."
FUN!!! what are we gonna do
Dean doesn't bother looking to see who it is until he says, "We don't need to make a big deal of what happened."
“Dunno, Winchester. Think he saw you and his heterosexuality and common sense held hands and ran off into the sunset,” Gabriel says wistfully, reaching a hand out like he’s referring to a vast expanse of adventurous land. “This may be your fault, Dean-o.”
Michael listens intently the whole time, processing Adam’s words. Eventually, he nods.
“Well, the leather jacket you’re wearing seems pretty creased, I’d assume you wear it pretty often,” the boy observes, reaching out to touch Dean’s leather jacket’s sleeve to show the visible whitened creases in the material.
"I love you but please stop talking." Dean kisses Cas's nose before checking to see that the water for the pasta is beginning to boil. "Can you get the spaghetti noodles ready? I think the whole box is fine, it's not that big a box."
Locker 275:
YOU sound pretty gay
Better luck next time.
Once they're alone, Sam walks over to bring Dean into a hug. "I'm sorry about John and Cas."
i mean, i study with him too, but i was mostly studying with cas. you've never met him.
“About that, we gotta cut that article,” Lucian cuts over, glaring at Dean. “Something’s cropped up, we can’t run the Novak piece.”
"Your brother is really cute," Gadreel blurts out. Dean's eyes widen at that and Gadreel remedies, "I just mean that I'd like to get to know him."
Dean’s aware that he’s been talked about in tabloids and fashion magazines since his status as Castiel Novak’s personal assistant gained traction. Most of it just talks about his impeccable fashion sense, how it’s to be expected to come from Cas’s P.A., and about how hot he is. Dean appreciates the ego boost. Some of the tabloids go a little crazy though, and he’s seen at least three that have mentioned Sam. He hopes they don’t dig too deep, he doesn’t like having too much personal information out there. Sometimes, it’s nice to keep some things to yourself.
"I got shot and then almost died. Why would I want to go back in there?" Dean challenges. He looks over at Adam and says, "I'll go back in if you free my brother."
Jack enters the cafe.
A loud explosion shakes the landing zone but the C-4 busts down the barrier. Gordon stumbles back from the impact, other hostages behind him catching him before he can fall, and they marvel at the door collapsing. They raise their arms, blinking against the smoke and Gordon shouts at the SWAT team, "We're hostages! Hostages! We need help!"
Anael and Adam volunteered to take care of the body. Gabriel readily agreed to serve as his alibi — Cas would have volunteered if he hadn’t been under surveillance and very clearly been with only Alfie and some other inmate during the time of Lilith’s death. Crowley said he’d make sure Naomi doesn’t tie her death to him and Anael and Dean is checking with Meg to make sure their escape is ready for tomorrow. It’d be too suspicious to leave now and with the lockdown, impossible.
Dean...
She sees Meg, Angeles and Houston creep past the office she's in and she stays quiet and still as they go to the other hallway before splitting up. Once she's sure they're gone, Toni sneaks to the office that she'd seen the gurney disappear into. Peeking in, she can see a woman, Palermo, standing guard but she's not currently looking at the door. Toni recalls her communicating with sign language, which could only mean she deaf or mute and she's spoken before.
baby relax i'll just tell him i was out with kev he likes kev
It's a cute dog.
Dean FREEZES -- this is way too much like him and Cas now, and Cas’s death threatens to rip him apart again.
dean???
"I'm proud of you, Cas. Truly," she says.
Castiel, it's in October.
“No, I want to know why,” Dean says, moving closer. “I’m tired of this, why does my being with Pax bother you so much?”
metatron is a poo poo head
"I don't think it'd get to anything that dramatic, but thanks anyway," Dean says, offering up a small smile. Castiel calls for quiet on set and then Gadreel and the other photographers are snapping away, the flash blinding and the lights hot. Dean wonders how models do this so much.
He takes a quick shower after texting Cas his address and changes into a mint and black tartan-patterned army shirt by Vivienne Westwood. It’s almost like his cheap flannel shirts but on the off chance Cas qualifies this as a date, he doesn’t want to underdress. He’s sure Cas doesn’t own anything remotely not branded. He pairs it with plain black sweatpants from American Apparel. He gets started on the pasta, trying to make it as fast as possible while retaining as much as the quality. Cas texted back that he was on his way so Dean has about half an hour unless Cas doesn’t mind if the pasta isn’t ready by the time he arrives.
“Yeah,” Castiel nodded minutely.
i think i'm in love
I apologize if I have crossed a line.
BOYFRIEND?
“You too,” Benny agrees, returning the hug. “I heard from your pal Pamela Barnes when she came here. I thought maybe she meant a different Dean, y’know? But here you are. You’re in fashion?”
I don't know... September is very close to October...
Cas turns around and breaks into a smile once he realises who it is. “Dean.”
big scope of things.
Yeah, but I love him.
"I am," Castiel affirms. "Well, no need to pick a new outfit. I'll wear this."
that out loud?
97 i love to see it
Dean thinks of something to say, somehow lost for words, and he says, "Cas, I'm so sorry, I —"
Mick protests, "After how deep I am in this? I'd be incriminating myself! No!"
They all debate internally on what to do with Chuck now that he’s human.
Gotcha. C
"Is he awake?" Dean asks, looking up at the three of them.
good.”
i'll let gabriel know too.
He gathers most of the robbers in the office to tell them their new plan -- throw one of them out and turn them in, to the police. Have them insist on testifying only in court, and then Dean has a team of people Adam helped contact to bust them out on the drive there. Five people including the two who will enter the bank alongside the one they turn in. It's risky, and the plan entirely belongs to the one out of jail. He probably shouldn't have approved a plan so reckless but it's the only plan they have that they can actually do.
"I insist," Cas replies, gently taking her hands and putting the stack between her palms. "Thank you for saving my life."
She hails a taxi to take her to Naomi's office at Hearst Tower in Manhattan. Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire and Seventeen were housed there which may make navigation difficult. Thankfully, Meg knows her way around and Dean doesn't, which means she's going to beat him to Naomi.
“Their loss,” Cas agrees, huffing a soft laugh. “I worked in commissary when I was in prison. It wasn’t bad, I secretly ate snacks or snuck stuff back to my cell with me so I didn’t have to spend my own commissary money.”
“I did,” Cas answers, grin audible in his voice. “I can’t believe it.”
Dean looks over at him. "If you go, I'll make you dinner."
Dallas scoffs loudly, kicking his feet up on the table as he asks, looking around at the others, "Can we really get two billion?"
I remember you said you didn’t
ADAM (V.O.)
Dean ends up feeling a little unwell after being out in Lenox Hill when the snow suddenly began now that it's the first week of December. He didn't see any weather forecast before leaving the house but maybe he should have. Sam insisted on moving into Dean's apartment from Cas's so he could help him out with the breakup and now that he's sick, it's just even more reason for him to do so. Eileen offers to stay with Cas so they won't crowd Dean's small apartment.
“Because I know he won’t agree! He’s busy with this one and I’m pretty sure he’ll be retiring from stealing after this one,” Bela says exasperatingly. “He’s going to take his cut and do whatever the hell he said he was going to do with it and then he and Angeles will elope somewhere --“
"Dean, what are you doing?" Cas questions.
we need?
. He says firmly, "You’re
Dad's overreacting to me fainting in Barcelona and reassigned my transportation to Michael.
I hate that.
Shakily, Gilda Good’s voice comes through. “
"Probably propose to Ruby," Anael mumbles, looking down at her blood red nails. "I think it's time, right?"
pushback. I did bring a token
"Believe me, I want to. All of us would," Dean replies honestly. "But I need you alive for now."
Crowley raises an eyebrow.
Because I like him a lot...
when i get my own farm i'm gonna make all the chickens wear hats
Cas updates him on London with Gabriel. He tells him he made it through without smoking a single stick. He confesses that he'd gotten desperate on the fourth day but Gabriel caught him before he could buy anything. Dean tells him that as long as he's making progress, he can't be happier. He's glad he's trying.
Michael frowns. “No.”
“I see how you and De Luca keep hiding off-camera, I know the two of you keep talking and meeting in private. I do spend time in surveillance, you know. I may not have seen your face but I can surely use the process of elimination to know which guard is CO Milligan,” Lilith says. “Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me. You and De Luca can keep going if you’d like.”
Are you talking back to me?
A second chance to be a better man. Sam feels relief wash over his being.
"Naomi and Arthur are planning to break in at 3," Mick informs, twisting the phone cord around his finger. "They had me call the CO19."
i know
first time, it really feels like
cassie darling is your father coming to chaperone?
Toni's eyes follow him cautiously. "I am."
who did you guys get roomed with
Sam gives him that look — the same look he gave Dean when he said he was fine when he and Benny Lafitte broke up when he was 24, that look that says he’s covering something up. “You don’t really like Pax all that much, do you?”
weaken it enough for us to
Meg lifts up a handful of notes pointedly. “But now you know what you need to be ready for this time. We have money for better supplies now; military-grade protective equipment, real surgeons -- we could probably even bring one in with us. Money is power, Dean. And we collectively have millions of that. This isn’t the same as two years ago.”
"We could have invested a little bit more in these masks," Paris says disdainfully and London points to her in agreement. "If I knew that we were going to wear this for almost two weeks, I would have offered to buy us nicer ones. I know someone who makes these excellent masks..."
he looked really tired so i thought i'd wait until tomorrow
Dean hesitates -- he didn't know if it was possible to save Adam from Naomi and Ketch without at least one of them going out to bargain for his release. He takes Cas's hand into his own and presses a light kiss to his knuckles, slightly scratched from all the diamonds he's been handling, and says regretfully, "Cas, I can't promise you that."
Dean dials Sam’s number and listens to it ring until Sam’s voice breaks the pattern, “Dean, what’s up?”
anyway i wanted to ask if y'all were done packing for the trip
[Found on Dean’s locker with Reese’s Cup]
bitch is earlier than the early bird
Dean runs a hand over his face, letting the heat from the mug spread warmth into his other hand. "You can't just go off and try to get arrested or something, at least talk it out with me. I know you're stressed out but let me help you. It's literally my job to pick up your shit, sir."
i love euoouuy
Skilled robber
"Couldn't make it today," the cop replies as easily as he can manage to sound, combing through his hair to hide the way his hand is shaking. Finally, the guard decides that it's fine to let them pass and the boom barrier rises. Dean is just itching to get into the bank and find the governor. He'd visited the bank way before he even recruited the other robbers for his heist under the guise of a potential investor so he could case the governor's security team. There's only one person who could be of any real threat, Abaddon Knight. Hopefully, they can get her out of the way.
The buzzing sound is louder now and Sam follows the sound to see Dean on the floor, leaning against the wall. His face is buried in his hands as he weeps quietly. He kneels down next to Dean, raising a hand to his shoulder to comfort him only to see a bloody handprint. He stops an inch away, staring at it.
“Yep,” Dean answers. “She’s going with the Giambattista Valli dress you selected for her.”
The runway passes much quicker than Dean thought it would feel, but it’s exhilarating the whole time. No matter how many or how few models were left waiting for their turn to walk down the runway, Dean was just as excited to see them walk out. After the last model comes back behind the stage, all the models walk out and line up in a row on the runway. Cas comes out after them, beaming as the audience claps for his collection. He bows once in silent thanks and as the tradition, holds hands with the last model, Anna, as they all disappear backstage as the runway music comes to an end.
"Well, who said I was gonna take it?" Adam asks, voice dropping low so nobody can hear him.
The two of them take off down the hall, running down the stairs while they grip their rifles tight. Meg's mask falls off while they run back to where they left Angeles but she doesn't bother with it.
"Oh come on, you've got the princess in one of the rooms. I saw her when we were getting trapped here," Ash says, playing a more English accent like Jo was. "Who is he?"
Victor comes into the tent, warning, "Inspector, three unauthorised motorcycles are about to enter the vicinity."
Michael feels betrayed by his body, and he curls his hands into fists. “You’re fucked up, you know that?”
Now, every moment in his life where people have judged him and insisted he stay in the closet, it all came rushing out like a broken floodgate, unwilling to stop as it clouded every inch of Dean’s rationality all the way to Cas’s place. His mind was in an unclear fog and Dean’s anger was at a new high. He wasn’t sure when was the last time he’d been so livid -- maybe back in elementary school when a bunch of boys trapped him in a locker because they caught him staring at another boy and Dean hunted them down once a teacher freed him.
Dean gathers Adam and Angeles again to talk about their next move, Adam and Dean informing Angeles that Sam and his team have discussed and decided to take Jack Kline instead of the ten other kids. Dean has to admit that he'd been a little concerned when Sam told him their choice because if the decision went public -- and it will -- Sam would get implicated since he's leading the investigation. Though Dean didn't think Sam would go with the more morally compromising decision, Adam told him that it was Zachariah's insistence and that he will bear the responsibility.
He HITS him again.
I got the photo printed today. The one I took of Cas on our first date, the sunset one.
“You hear that, Dino? You get used to it,” Gabriel adds unhelpfully.
Pax is unavailable for dinner apparently and Dean marvels at the fact that Pax won’t cancel on his friends for his boyfriend. He has a feeling they’re both well aware that they have an expiration date. Pax probably assumed Dean was going to break up with him over dinner, which can’t be further from the truth, but Dean thinks the break up is becoming a little inevitable. Pax can't run forever.
Gabriel calls Sam to the office with his radio and Sam arrives not long after, rambling about how scared he'd been and how they've caught the shooter, an MI6 agent called Antonia Bevell. At some point, Rowena insists on them leaving Dean alone for the night to recuperate but neither Sam nor Cas wanted to leave Dean's side, so they ended up falling asleep at his bedside.
The angel nods once, watching the two as they go back through the door.
Michael and Adam were able to get Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve off from work to celebrate with Dean, Sam and Eileen. Dean could tell they felt bad that Cas wasn’t there but it was for the best. Adam was excited for his first Christmas with Sam and Dean and got them fairly expensive presents; a Nanoleaf Rhythm device that lights up to the beat of the music you’re playing and a costly bottle of Cabernet Shiraz 2017. That purchase has Adam going on a rant about how it’s absurd that there are bottles of wine over $100,000, and Dean thinking about how Cas would have appreciated the good wine.
flirt.
had no idea kevin had it in him but go girl give us everything
Cas frowns. “What are you talking about?”
"He's out with Bela Talbot, won't be back for at least another two hours," Dean says, looking at his watch. "I can take a message."
"Paris... maybe Anastasia," Balthazar continues. "Salem would have an innocent name like Emma or Zoe."
"Dean Winchester," Hannah answers, eyes darting to the door. "He set this up."
Anna notices them and reassures, “Don’t worry. Religion isn’t too big a thing here. If they aren’t interested, they’ll probably just leave you alone.”
Dean knows they need help. One man is dead and nothing in his plan had prepared him for fatalities, especially on his side of the fight for the Bank of America. He needed to bring people into the bank to help -- get the exit done faster, help split the work and cover more ground so they can leave earlier.
this is WAR
“For what?” Gabriel asks.
“Thanks,” Dean nods once, waving goodbye as he walks to the elevator. The building isn’t horrendously high, only being about ten stories tall.
” Cas questions, beginning to feel anger under his skin.
Why didn't you join the art club?
“So you’re going to fire her?”
“Or what, Angeles?”
“Don’t tell me about Wikipedia. Tell me about you, from you.”
to,” Cas says steadily. “It doesn’t make up for poking into your business when I shouldn't but I hope it makes up for my attitude with Pax.” He hesitates and draws in a short breath, like his chest has gotten too tight to take in any more, and says, “What I said about me being your boss... It’s true, but you’re also my friend above anything else, Dean. I treasure our friendship. As your friend, I’ll support you and Pax if that’s what you really want. And I’m really sorry, I was rude and you were just trying to talk. I’m trying to be better for you.”
"A lot. Police plans, the science of the gold..." Bela trails off, flashing her a brilliant smile. "But I think it's manageable. It has to be for all that money and gold. How did you find it?"
” The song fades out. As Sam eats, Dean talks.
i know, nobody likes him!
Why are you sitting there?
Meg mutters, "Governor sure as hell won't open that fucking door."
google how do i delete a month
Sam doesn't even know if Dean felt the same. He'd had his suspicions but he didn't even know if Dean's tastes were exclusive to women or if he liked a wider playing field.
look at it? like what, like dying is okay?
“You know, a CO sister would have been useful to know about
But he’s not here. All Dean has right now is Cas’s brother.
Michael just asked if you want him to drive you and Sam to school too since your place is on the way.
"Aye," Rowena acknowledges, grabbing the supplies from the bag they took with them. Eileen and her each grab one board, holding it to opposite sides of the room while Ash walks between them, hands occupied with his laptop as he gets a headstart on cracking the code. The styrofoam boxes prevent the sensors from detecting their body heat until Rowena and Eileen get close enough to duct tape the sensors.
oh and bela and i are dating now
Let’s light it up.
"I could be worse," Angeles mutters, hand tentatively coming up to touch his face. He hisses when he feels a piece of glass that has embedded itself into his cheek. "How bad is it?"
then he started talking about
i just joined and we’re already getting into the gritty huh
He was talking.
well dad can piss off
," Jess greets, relieved. "
The book. Hand over the book.
"God, I knew I should have gone to Spain for Dean’s classes. If I knew you were there, I would have dropped everything and bought a ticket to Madrid," Adam says regretfully.
stick around. No wonder Cas left.
"I knew we should have stayed in bed this morning," Cas says, resigned, but he smiles anyway.
not when it’s a RAT
Industrial equipment specialist and former miner turned robber.
Nope.
"We're waiting for Rome to come with food," one of the hostages fills him in. It's then that Chuck notices Gordon behind the door with a metal pole, ready.
"I barely did anything," Cas points out, bringing the bowls over to the table while Dean puts the pan and pot into the sink to clean later.
I heard that love starts with trust.
i told him we were gonna meet with some friends so the only surprise is cake
it does, we'll deal with it accordingly."
we believe what we know and we know you're like madly in love with each other at this point
MICHAEL
DEAN BABY OMG
“Who’s Michael anyway?” Dean asks, pointing a thumb to Michael.
Cas guides her to the couch to sit and he settles next to her. “Alright, calm down. Everything’s going to be fine.”
“He doesn’t want this out there. Take it down,” Dean says in a low voice, closing the mock-up and dropping it on the desk.
"Angeles, calm down," Kansas says, holding a hand out to him, placating.
Unable to stand it any longer, Gabriel snaps, “This isn’t fucking funny.”
Dean can’t bring himself to break up with Pax. He knows he should. He’s not as into Pax as Pax is with him. Pax is sincere and he likes to buy him gifts, but he’s also a little too competitive for Dean’s taste, he chews on the ends of his plastic straws, there’s always that one strand of hair that can never go the right direction, and his mom Fortuna doesn’t like Dean, and Pax is very simply not Castiel Novak. Even if he looks like Castiel with a beard when he squints his eyes. But Dean thinks this has got to be better than being alone. He always hated being alone — just because he’s used to being left behind doesn’t mean he likes it.
Zachariah starts protesting, "We need to get Jack Kline out, he is the top priority. Higher than even the governor. If they're giving him up, we need to take that chance. They already know he's important." Victor is silent but nods along with Zachariah, leaving Sam in disbelief.
The thief frowns at him, the satchel strap falling off his shoulder. "Who the hell are you?"
Touché.
"Angeles! Angel,
Crowley nods, though his lack of certainty is unsettling. “And you are sure he will no longer harass you?” Dean hums to affirm it. “Do you have a plan?”
Wow, look at you, bro. The
and thanks for telling me
Not if I kiss you first.
Castiel replies, sorting through the polaroids, "It was good, thank you. Will you be free this Thursday for lunch with Sam?"
“Sir, I’ve got Bela,” Dean informs him.
YOU'D CRY TOO
And now Dean.
“No can do,” she replies glibly. “An article’s an article and it is sure to
And honestly? I hate praying. I
"You were gonna destroy their lives?" Dean asks, eyes wide.
Impulsively, she presses a quick kiss to Bela's lips before pulling away, startled by her own actions. Bela stares at her before she cradles Meg's face to kiss her again. Meg's heart goes a thousand miles a second, having Bela so close to her. Though they would be leaving for the heist any day now, it was still exhilarating to feel like they had time.
"What the hell are you talking about?" Dean shouts, trying to get back to Benny's side. "Benny, what the fuck? Come on!"
ROWENA
“Dean Winchester,” Dean replies.
you have a big crush on him is that not reason enough
“Don’t be crass,” Cas says, rolling his eyes as he walks ahead with Belphegor jumping around him like a demonically excited puppy.
everything. Maybe there’s people
"Finally, some sun," Salem grins. She and Castiel were at the doorway of the roof -- out of sight of the snipers but certainly not out of sight of the sun. The sunlight is warm on his face and Castiel is grateful for this small window of opportunity to get some fresh air. While the windows do let light in, it can never compare to feeling it on your skin.
"Harrison," Balthazar says decisively.
"I don't need you to watch me. I was just concerned," Michael mutters, returning his attention to producing his next diamond. Castiel stares at him -- unnerving to most but it didn't disturb Michael. Meg had joked before that Michael and Castiel could have a stare-off to the death.
Castiel waves his hand to gesture to Dean to make space. Dean shifts inwards at the bench and Cas sits by him, saying, “I’m aware of your skills. But I’d think you would have gotten the higher paying job.”
I also believe in God, which makes some people roll their eyes, but I love the idea that there is someone out there who loved you regardless. And I am aware of the people who hate in his name, and they are no Christian. I believe in love, basically. I like having faith too. It provides a sense of comfort and faith.
Not one thing. Toni couldn't get Dean to say anything even with the threat of cardiac arrest becoming more and more apparent with every 10cm
Angeles raises an eyebrow and it's like his blue eyes reflect the cigarette's smouldering end. "I thought you said no personal information. You didn't even let us share names. I had to use
speak for yourself rat
Ed starts to walk away as Kansas comes out, pulling up the sleeves on his coveralls, and asks, "What the hell was that about?"
"The inspector told me he found Vegas's face and I guess they tracked her through old bank footage when you two were doing recon," Dean explains, running a hand over his face. "He gave me one hour to decide if I should surrender or not."
"I'm... afraid, I suppose," Castiel says and Dean can see his drunken trance shattering into jarring sobriety. "I don't like being judged. It's one thing to have people talk shit about the work you do. You could always change that. It's another when they're talking shit about you because that's not something you can throw out and remake in a better image. It's different. And being in this position, being fairly new to fame, where everyone is just waiting for me to mess up, it is nerve-wracking to imagine telling people that I'm gay." He drinks the last few drops of his wine before he puts the bottle on the floor. "I'm not ashamed of who I am... I'm proud of myself and the work I've done, what I've been through. But I'm just afraid."
he's likeable to you," Balthazar says, raising his eyebrows as if willing Castiel to lie his way out of the question. Castiel rolls his eyes and Balthazar walks into the room, sitting down on his bed, "You know there's still five months to the heist, right?"
"Dean," Cas huffs a laugh, a soft and affectionate thing. "I love you too."
yeah and you're forgetting that you also told him to shove his bullshit up his ass
LMAOOO RIGHT?
"Why did you pick Kansas?" Angeles throws the question back.
-- humanity. You see that now,
Crowley MacLeod, Castiel Novak
John stalls, uncertain, but he finally pulls his eyes up to look between Sam and Dean. "I have a son there. I was here because I was visiting him at work but ran into you two while waiting for a cab." John starts rambling on as if his words would make them forget the bomb he just dropped. "I didn't think I'd ever see you two again. You know, I always wondered what happened --"
Oh, there is. But only Death
the happiness was in just
[Found in Dean’s locker]
Missouri nods, looking slightly distressed at the idea that the police had refused help. Sure, they were committing a crime, but they weren't hurting anyone. There had been no reason to withhold medical aid. She turns back to Crowley and asks, "Speaking about the police, what do you have to say about the allegations against you about the trafficking charges?"
god squad
"I thought he took something from the coat," Castiel answers. "But he said he was just looking for food."
I loved him, Sammy.
"Hey, Sammy," John greets semi-amiably, but it's clear in his tone that he wanted to ask about something else. "I wanted to congratulate you again on Eileen and your engagement."
i'll pick you up tomorrow
alright, alright. i'll respect your choice.
Adam looks up at Cas, still on the radio, and asks, “Where the hell is she?”
Dean and Michael look at each other -- they have a plan.
what the fuck is a destiel.
he didn't come in but he saw us
what the fuck is bel2
I don't.
"Since I turned 5," Sam answers, taking a match from Dean to help light up the ropes. The two kneel down and work on it before they stand and take steps back.
The runways go past one after another and Dean can't stop taking photographs of the models as they strut down, branded heels and boots clicking rhythmically with the booming music. The bass is deep in Dean's chest and it almost feels like being at a concert. The show ends far too soon for Dean's liking but the adrenaline from each show lasts until the end of the week.
as strong as God or the Darkness,
why not, i'll do it.
Michael raises an eyebrow. “What?”
"I'm in our room. Door's locked."
Berlin can’t help but laugh. “Do we all think that?”
deserves to die because he
Okay, Dean.
Sam tells him to give him a second and he turns to Zachariah, saying, "You heard Kansas, he needs medical aid."
Dean is different.
Dean asks, “Have your eye on anyone? I like giving advice.”
Cas deliberates. "Well, it’s legal."
Dean snorts. "No way. I think she'll agree that it's funny." He looks over his table and makes sure he's not forgetting anything and says, "Listen, Charlie. I gotta go pick up some stilettos for Cas. Call me again after your date, tell me how it went?"
Snail dude:
Castiel stares open-mouthed at Dean and for a second, Dean almost thinks the time has frozen until Castiel’s head drops into his hands. Castiel exhales shakily in relief, a small smile on his face. “Holy
“What is it?” Kelly asks. She waits patiently while Castiel stares at the way his hands tremble and becomes acutely aware of how shallow his breath has gotten. She touches his arm, gentle and grounding. A different way from Dean’s, again, but helpful to his stress all the same.
The Met Gala itself is a lot more buzzed than Dean thought it to be. Celebrities dressed in the most popular labels walk past the long line of photographers, turning every which way and posing with pleasant smiles. It’s not Dean’s first time in front of a camera, but it’s his first time in front of so many. The flashes go off warm on his face and he resists the urge to blink and tries to listen when photographers ask him to smile or give them a look over the shoulder, or to wink, or whatever else they want him to do. They compliment his suit and he tells them with a practised but stunning smile, “It’s Versace.”
Gabriel knew why Michael and especially Adam were so against the plan from the beginning — Michael had barely survived his time here between spending almost half the time in solitary confinement and cocaine or heroin. He’d seen it himself, it’s why he instantly agreed to come along when he heard that Michael would be going. If Adam wasn’t going to be there, then Gabriel would volunteer to look out for him.
“Of course, lay it on me,” Charlie nods as they start making their way back to NOVAK.
is no one ready?” Castiel mutters, disappointment and annoyance dripping from his tone. “Eden, I swear to Christ, if Duma and the makeup team isn’t here in the next two minutes, none of you needs to come in for work tomorrow.”
Castiel keeps him close the whole night, introducing him to celebrities he knows personally and meeting ones he’s never spoken to before, all the while Dean gets to meet them.
"And you'll actually pay for the coffee this time. No more running," Adam says.
Dad still doesn't know that I went on a date with Cas and I plan to keep it that way. I don't know what he'd think of me being bi but I'm not taking any chances. Dad gets extreme when he's drunk and he's rarely sober so I'm not risking getting kicked out. Bobby would take me in but I can't leave Sammy there on his own. I'd worry too much.
"Can you call them, see if they've reached yet?" Sam requests and Jody steps away to contact the drivers.
“I helped some plays in school for extra cash,” Dean answers and Adam just smiles wider.
Dean Winchester, Castiel Novak
there, or God and Amara.
Cas, I --
It feels like a whole minute has passed before Dean processes a bang and liquid spilling over his hand. He looks back down at his body, his vision blurring as his red suit grows darker. He crumbles to his knees, unable to stand as he tries to process what the hell just happened. The shooter at the doorway has a mask over the lower half of their face but the body figure suggests that it's a woman. She disappears down the hallway and Dean barely grasps his radio.
Dean pauses - way too early for a conversation about this.
he's more important
back to sleep.
DEAN YOU DID THAT
Dean lingers, hesitant to leave them like this, but eventually nods, “Okay. See you tomorrow.”
Dean falls silent as Cas waits for him to answer until Dean says, "Someone has to get Adam out of that tent."
Elite Gayz II Women
Now, he's set up in a dark warehouse Dean had rented out as his hideout. Salem has connected their own cameras to the computers she set up for him, so he will serve as their eye in the sky during their operation. He is connected to Dean and his team through an earpiece so that even if he has to leave the hideout, he will not be unreachable. There's a separate phone as well, in case the earpiece becomes unusable.
“Yes,” Michael answers, picking up some books off the coffee table so Dean can put his mug down. The books are mostly about business. At Dean’s interested look, Michael explains, “I’ve been thinking about starting a business. I don’t really know what I’ll do yet so I’ve been reading up.”
"That cut is awful," Cas says as soon as the first model walks out. Dean frowns as he stares, about to agree, until both he and Cas's faces pale on their double-take when the model takes two more steps. Cas barely whispers, "What the fuck?"
he’s so cute pls
He didn’t say the exact words but Dean knew what Adam had implied. Clear as day — he’d pick Michael over him if it comes down to it. Sure, Dean had been afraid of this choice. In fact, he'd told Gabriel that he thought this would happen but he couldn’t say he didn’t anticipate it. He did know Michael far longer and all Michael had ever done was try to protect him. Dean had him run into danger. He couldn’t be mad at Adam for it, he would have made the same decision in his shoes.
Lucian scowls at him and puts one of his employees on speakerphone. “Ruby.”
Sam starts walking towards the door and Dean shouts, "Open the doors, Sam's coming in with med supplies!"
I'LL DO IT
did y'all get clarence a gift because i need to get one in 15
the right thing to do, not to
She REALISES:
Sam clenches his jaw like he has something to say, but he shakes his head, “You’re tired, I’m tired. Whatever. Forget it.” Dean tries to apologize again but Sam changes the topic again, “What did he think about you and Pax?”
“Exactly,” Gabriel said lightly, running a hand through Castiel’s soft hair. “Why’d it bother you so much? Are you gay?”
"I'm going to start cleaning up," Cas says, kissing the tip of Dean's nose before getting up to start cleaning the kitchen. He leaves to get a rag and Dean sits up, looking at the messy kitchen. He sees his reflection, dark in the oven door, icing smeared across his cheek and frosting at the edges of his hair and he laughs.
Mick gets the handcuffs off of Adam's wrists as Ketch leads Dean to the back of one of the ambulances where his jumpsuit and Naomi are waiting for him. Naomi says, gesturing to the red coveralls as she lifts up his Dalí mask, "For your return."
The Impala rolls to a stop outside a church. Lightning and thunder crash overhead ominously.
You take care of yourself,
Cas raises an eyebrow, deciding to take the bait. “Not what?”
Salem puts the glasses back in the plastic tray and Meg brings it back to the surgeons and Sam. Sam puts the false glasses back on, having to keep up the ruse, and Meg barely stifles a laugh at his poor act. Castiel brings them to the lobby where Chuck is laid out on a gurney. "Kansas says you have one hour. Will that be sufficient?"
Then he wasn’t.
so you know how you guys gave advice to sam for the girl he liked?
“Why the f—“ Castiel cuts himself off, sighing loudly. “Tell Duma to get the collection here in the next five minutes or she’s out.” Gadreel quickly runs off to call Duma and Dean hangs back awkwardly. He’s in a bad mood. “Winchester.”
Dean quickly remedies, “I’m not saying you have to come out, Cas. You do that when you want to. I know you have your own history like I have my own, you aren’t the problem. The problem is people like John who keep insisting that I be someone else and I’m tired of hiding.” He pauses at the sight of Cas looking like he’s trying to understand. “I’m not making you choose, Cas. I still love you more than anything and I’ll wait for you. Whenever you’re ready, I’ll be waiting. But I don’t want to pretend to be something I’m not. You may be good with that, and that’s fine and all, but I’m not. So you take your time. But I’m not going back in there.”
Anael takes it from him and frowns. “This is Alastair’s. But he was seen on the cameras. Someone must have stolen it.” She glances back at the bloodied floor and says to Cas, “You go help them. I’ll try and find out what happened.”
do that shit! We’re supposed to get out of here!”
Maybe he is still unclear on their relationship?
"I know, and I have a way to take care of that. We can get the gold out without even opening the vault door," Dean says. That grabs the thief's attention and he continues to convince him, "You'll get out with a few thousand kilograms of gold and hundreds of thousands in bills if you join me. I promise you won't get caught. Are you in?"
Saying "good job" and giving me the car still doesn't make you a good father.
Castiel blinks, wide-eyed, but finally asks, "How do you feel?"
"Anael," Dean says, smiling. "Oh God, so good to see you."
[Valentino Fall 19/20, look 53]
Dean glances at his watch before he points out, "It'll be 10 by then, everyone would be home by now."
“Sam, what are you talking about?”
They’re gone as soon as they pass and then Dean’s on his way to hail a taxi back to his apartment.
[Found on Dean's locker]
Again, the 3 parts were inspired by La Casa De Papel and Vis à Vis, so if you haven't seen them but you liked these, I think you'd like the shows too! Forewarning for mature content, especially from Vis à Vis.
Let me guess. Castiel.
Cas’s face pales slightly and he looks back to look back at the others. “How did they even know we would be leaving right now?”
MICHAEL
"Like what you see?" Naomi taunts.
long as the next time you die,
"Of course, go ahead," Castiel nods, trying to shoot a pointed look towards Meg.
Dean lies, staring at his hands, "I didn't want him to know how I felt so I ended up going off on him."
no offense but that sounds pretty gay
Dean sits down across from them in the booth. "Hey."
Cas sits on the hood of the Impala as Dean sets up the fireworks display. Ellen lends the brothers the empty lot behind the Roadhouse whenever they want to set them off. The floor has black marks from old ones and there will be fresh ones by the end of the night. Sam digs out the earplugs from the backseat and hands them to Cas as Dean straightens up, smiling at his arrangement.
He doesn't find much; there's still some people milling around watching the Factory despite the time and of course the police are still discussing among themselves on what to do. Gilda just waltzing into the Factory was a damn miracle. Adam wasn't sure how long they could have held their ground if they didn't have someone of national value in there with them especially with people like Naomi and Ketch heading the negotiation.
ok tell me now
hey isn’t the swim team captain gay
Cas knocks on the door and Sam opens it, smiling, "Hey, Cas. Come in." He looks up and sees Michael, adding hesitantly, "Do you want to come in?"
Sam LAUGHS and brings her into a HUG.
DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE
Sam freezes. "You can't be serious."
Dean asks, slowly moving down the hallway with Castiel close behind, "How's your wound?"
: DEAN
won’t shut up. Kept going on and
In the camera, she makes some comment to one of the inmates that he can’t make out since the footage has no audio, but the inmate scoffs at her. Michael puts the list back into the drawer, trying to think of what to do.
There's some from the present day as well -- we see the Wayward Sisters laughing over dinner, Adam sitting at a desk in Heaven watching Michael pace around him, smiling. Chuck collapses on his knees in front of a throne, showing ROWENA who grins mischievously at him. Then, finally, Dean, Sam, Cas, Eileen and Jack sitting together, happily watching a movie together. Dean raises the remote towards the screen, at us, as if going to turn it off and --
They skid to a stop outside the room and Meg kicks the door. They both raise their rifles as the door swings open and Sam, Dorothy and Amelia look up in shock.
"Balthazar," he instantly returns the favour.
IT wizard, master of hacking through security and cyber attacks.
So maybe Winchester’s crush on his brother may never come to any sort of resolution, but Gabriel thinks if, on the off chance it does, he would readily approve of Dean. Maybe at the start, he wouldn’t have, but now things are different. Dean is good.
Meg ponders it quietly. She's never liked the emotional side of things, preferring to keep things black and white. Even with Bela, Meg and she had made it clear that it's a no strings attached kind of situation — clear-cut. But she listens to Dean and she understands.
i got out on good behaviour
I found the word, by the way.
Michael’s in the Empty, whatever
yeah me neither
do you wanna come with us? i've been meaning to ask
A little over half an hour later, they're in the kitchen waiting for Dorothy, Meg, Mick and Jo to arrive with the truck to get them out. Adam, Anael and Cas were still there just to make sure everything goes smoothly.
that’s left?
"Okay," Cas says like a weight's been lifted off of his shoulders. "I'll go on a date with you, Dean."
At least, for now, it’s the calm before the storm. Roman doesn’t care enough for his prison to try and find out Dean’s plan to free Crowley and Naomi seems to be distracted by interrogating him.
LET'S GO ON A ROAD TRIP
Castiel is used to stress — in fact, he doesn’t even know what life is like without the strain on his sanity by now, but for some reason, it seemed like the world is caving in on him and for fuck’s sake, he needs a cigarette. Where’s Winchester when you need him?
He sips his coffee, letting the warmth sit in his mouth as he sinks into the comfort of the drink, closing his eyes and dragging out a long breath. It can only be the calm before the storm with a cup of coffee he'd been so eager to receive.
Cas stares at Dean with wide eyes, stopping himself from grabbing the box of pasta. “What the fuck is al dente?”
“Relax? You’ve gotta be kidding me.” Gabriel pulls the curtain shut behind him to give them some semblance of privacy and sits down next to Michael. Clearly, he’s been here for a long time, the aftereffects having kicked in by now — he’s drowsy, barely able to keep his head up, and breathing slowly. His skin still has a slight flush to it and Michael’s eyes are unfocused and hazy as he frowns over at Gabriel. Horrified but not wanting to show it, Gabriel schools his voice into something more steady as he says, “I thought you said your ex wouldn’t want you to touch that shit.”
do i really
this is what i mean
"I think it's a beautiful city in Italy..." Angeles trails off. "Why?"
"Sons are always like their fathers," John says sagely as Dean opens the boot to check.
i’m sure he ain’t that bad
"Well, there's a Batman villain called Bane so if you ask me, I think I nailed that one," Dean says, giving Cas a shit-eating grin, and Cas can't help but smile when he rolls his eyes.
Straight As as always, Sam. Good.
Dean tries to placate him, "Hey, come on. I'll just find where the cameras are hooked up and fix it. It's fine, okay? Maybe sewage messed with it or something."
“Okay, okay, let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Dean says, raising his hands in surrender.
Gayz II Men
Dean grins and leans on his elbows on the table, "So bossy. You did good in my place when Sam came."
Alright.
“I’m desperate. Just tell me any plan you have,” Anael pleads.
“Thank you,” Gabriel says when Dean tells him that. He’s rarely so sincere.
"Confirm my dinner with Bela for tomorrow, ask Channing Ngo where she wants to meet for that interview she wants, and tell Amara Shurley that I don't want her for the streetwear photoshoot," Cas lists off. "Otherwise, that'll be all."
"I don't want to give up on us," Adam says quietly, pleading.
Some time while Dean is talking, Alfie seems to have slipped away to a different table, not wanting to get involved. Smart. Gabriel simply stays put next to Dean, though he continues eating like the conversation isn’t happening.
“Beat the shit out of him before he tells a CO,” Dean answers. “Or we kill him.”
I couldn’t stand it, the idea that
There is a pause — too short for Pax to catch, but too long for it to go unnoticed by Dean — before he takes his hand in his, shaking it once with a firmness that Dean knows by now that Cas reserves for people he doesn’t like. “Luck.”
You talk too much.
Dean doesn’t answer for a while, the words too hard to say without wanting to cry, but when he does say them, they come out broken and tearful:
You said it yourself, Dean. The
nutted out and murdered pretty
“Balthazar and Meg taught me about it during Fashion Week but I think you should let Meg have the job,” Dean says carefully.
"I'm gonna call for the car to take us back to the hotel," Dean says. "Wait here, I'll go out nearer to the road."
novak??? is that cas's brother??
true happiness".
and you’re still alive? i applaud you.
Did you invite Eileen over?
Crowley.
it’s my face
me unless I ask.
Dean sniffs. "I know I don't. But it's just... God, I hate him so much but he was my dad and I thought he was trying to fix things between us, and then he says this is wrong and asks me to hide that part of myself. It got me so angry."
He hadn’t expected this, they’d gone through a whole conversation without her trying to kill him or bringing up her “holy mission”. It went a lot better than Michael thought it would have, but it doesn’t mean he’s going to let down his guard.
“I’ll do it,” Dean finally accepts, feeling guilt settling deep within him.
You’re gonna let a dog sit in the
All in all, Dean felt good about his chances for now. It already feels like prison will be out of sight and mind soon. Cas was right, being here is awful, regardless of if he was getting out in a few days or not. He got why Cas, Michael and Crowley hated it so much. Even Gabriel didn't like it there, no matter how at home he acted about it.
“I’m glad you like it,” Dean smiles. He glances over to the kitchen and says, “Hey, if we’re both free tomorrow night, maybe we can use Ellen’s cake recipe, make you a birthday cake.”
"I don't know." Cas breaks away from Dean to pace in thought until he decides, "Call everyone who was at the conference last week. Don't bother with Chuck first, keep it to NOVAK employees only. No use getting this to a magazine writer if it's an internal problem, he'll just write a tabloid-worthy article on it. Tell them to meet me in my office in two hours."
Adam laughs sarcastically and it feels cold in Dean’s gut. “Yeah, when Sam kidnapped me and Ketch and Naomi used me as a punching bag, you sure kept me safe.”
is a reaper?
I thought joining the FBI would be really cool.
"Hey, it's Dean," Dean says happily. "What are you doing tonight?"
Detroit stares at Dean, sound asleep, and says, "But Freddie Mercury is..."
Chuck SNAPS his fingers to kill him as he did before, but this time, it DOESN’T WORK. He tries again and again and AGAIN, getting more desperate.
"No," Crowley says, pulling a disgusted expression as he shakes the jacket in his hand. "Try this one."
he didn't want to worry you.
Hey, Mike? This silent treatment
Angeles pauses and turns to look at him. "How did you know?"
When Cas says
God doesn't hate gays, for the record.
Sam finally sighs, giving up, and he has a short talk with each hostage that comes out. He asks after their wellness and if they're injured. If they have sufficient supplies and any complaints. Most of them say that the robbers leave them alone and do their own work and that they get supplies if they need them.
Dean finds Meg at level three, at the in-house runway. His eyes track Anna’s trademark red hair to find her sitting on the runway stage, talking to other models, all of which are dressed in a NOVAK collection. Gabriel is there with another makeup artist, touching up their faces. He finally spots Meg at a foldable table, eyes scanning her computer screen. She tucks a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear, mouth moving minutely as she reads off of her screen.
"God, you two are gross," Meg fake-gags from the corner of the room. "Not sure if you'll want me at the wedding so I guess early congrats are in order."
see jo this is why you’re my sister
your father. Everybody makes
"Big day."
There's still time, Dean.
Meg huffs a chuckle, tucking the baggie into her jacket. “From what I’ve heard, she does sound like a handful.”
I gave everything for you and this
Dean considers it. “Meet me in the laundry room at 12:15.”
“This is about more than you talking,” Dean says, making sure John stays down. His face is clearly hurt, his nose leaking crimson, and his uniform has been dirtied by their shoes. “This is about how you left me and Sam! How you left Adam and his mom! All the bullshit you said to us, and the bullshit you never did. How you never left Sam and Jess alone no matter how many times they asked. You just never know when to stop.”
“And I will deal with it when it comes to that. The plan is the priority right now,” Dean says. The last thing he needs is his teammates getting panicked about him not having a plan on their second day in jail. He doesn’t need one to decide to feed the rest of them to the sharks to save their skin. With being in prison, surrounded by inmates who are willing to kill you for drugs or even just for looking at them the wrong way, he’s aware tensions are higher than they have ever been during the heists. He didn’t want to worsen it. The best he can do is pretend he knows what he’s doing until he actually does — fake it till you make it, as they say.
again?
Look at all the time we wasted
have to fight me now, so... What
London sticks out her tongue at him and walks off, linking arms with Vegas, and Salem runs out of the room in excitement for the festival. Knowingly, Balthazar slips out as well, leaving just Castiel and Kansas. Kansas looks at him and his face lights up.
hey not a shabby idea
"It's not mine," Cain says, nodding towards Bess. "Not hers either. She's been here the whole time."
What now indeed. Cas didn't know what to do until something big happens. Eileen had confirmed that operations were still going as strong as before Michael and Dean got shot and before Dean's departure. Michael had been saved and Dean and Adam were likely both in the tent right now. Jess is not at her station but Bevell was restrained and guarded by Meg so they no longer had anything to fear. The police have been quiet since taking Dean off their hands.
"No shit?" Gabriel asks, placing his brush on the coffee table so he can come to see the designs too. "
"Yeah, it's a secret and he's trusting you with it, so shut up. Not even Eileen can know unless he gives the green light," Dean warns. Sam nods in understanding. "Anyway, enough about me. Why are you going out with Cas tomorrow?"
Lucian’s smile is mocking and smug when he asks, “Did Cassiel send you?”
i'm just gonna stop there before i sound like an even bigger jackass
. I just let him find me in a situation where he would know about it.”
“He’d need to actually be around to pay for it,” Dean says. He didn’t mean for it to come off to snippily but he sometimes has a problem with holding back his emotions. Specifically, anger, and he was pissed at John. His brain knows that Adam didn’t choose for John to stay, or to be born to John, or to have John pay for his education, but Dean is bitter and it is unrelenting in his chest. Adam looks uncomfortable and Dean almost feels apologetic.
Dean says with a faint smile on his face, "Okay. Forgotten, but I'm still gonna be watching you. And of course. I love your room. It's way bigger and nicer than mine. Plus, someone’s gotta cut off your wine before you get any other ideas tonight anyway.”
"Nonsense, boy. It's still your work," Bobby insists, looking around the hall. Cas had planned the runway in an event space in Midtown Manhattan on 7th avenue, so to make it easier on himself and give him more preparation time, he sent one of Cas's cars to pick up Sam, Eileen, Ellen, Bobby, and Jo when they arrived. It's big enough to seat 150 people, or 180 if they were really packing them in. There's Dean's family, Cas himself, some NOVAK employees, other designers like Bela, fashion writers like Chuck Shurley, photographers like Gadreel, and various other fashion-inclined guests.
Since Dean’s outburst and then his attempt to resolve their tension, Castiel and he have gotten along much better. Dean still buys coffee for Castiel before he comes in for work, only to realize that Castiel has bought coffee for him on the way. Dean assured him that he didn’t have to get him coffee but Castiel told him it was his way of trying to be a better boss to Dean, so he lets him knock himself out.
Sam blinks once, then twice, then the corners of his lips turn up into a bright grin. "You shitting me?"
none of us are godly i thought we agreed it was fitting
Meg eyes Cas as the group made their way down another hallway. They'd split off -- Eileen and Sam as one unit and Detroit, Cas and Meg as another. With Cas knowing as much of the plan as Dean did and being so vulnerable, Detroit insisted that more people stuck with him. Eileen had talked Sam's fear into vengeful anger but Cas's remained in terror.
End of the road, little brother.
he’s staying hands-free.
BE QUIET
And I love you. I will always love you.
Hell. The Cage? Where is he?
me, poetry ???
i have my genius boyfriend and genius friend to thank
"What do you plan to do? Are we really letting Jack go?" Angeles asks.
“I’ll never be ready,” Castiel replies in resolve. “But it’s all a leap of faith, as I have learned. Dean has a point in the way he lives, I guess. He’s more of a ‘take risks first, think later’ kind of person. Even if he’s intimidated.” He adds, hands skimming the spine of the Daredevil comic book in his YSL bag, recites from heart, a line that he read on the taxi ride over, “Fear can be overcome if you have the will.”
That's what Windom is for -- Adam Milligan. Dean found his half-brother in Windom, Minnesota when Adam called and asked for John Winchester. Dean went to see him and coincidentally enough, Adam had dabbled a little bit in thievery to help get expensive medication for his sick mother. Dean invited him to join his heist, claiming that if they pulled it off, he would never have to steal again. Adam agreed instantly and is now serving as his outside man, keeping as close an eye he can on the police's investigation and tying up any and all loose ends that they may have left on the outside. Dean would do it himself but he has to keep control in the bank.
The case no longer belonged to just them -- other than Naomi Intel from FBI on a flight over, an Interpol agent was sent, Toni Bevell. Although, she disappeared by the time the tent was set up so he has no idea if this is Interpol protocol or if she decided that the Dalís weren’t enough of a threat for Interpol to handle.
CUTTING A FURBY OPEN???
"Inspector Naomi Intel... Welcome back to the heist. I'm honoured you caught the earliest flight." There's a pause and then Kansas says, "He's alright. I have to admit that I didn't expect you all to fire when you weren't aware of how much of the supply team were hostages."
"He had another son," Dean blurts out.
He doesn't sit in for the meeting and waits at his desk outside of Cas's office. When it hits 7:30, Dean is sent to pick up two lawyers and bring them to the office. When it's a little over 7:45, Sam goes into Cas's office, leaving Dean with a 'wish me luck' expression, crossing his fingers before he disappears behind the door.
Dean pauses and quirks a smile at the cashier, telling her he’ll come back later. He turns to Adam. “What?”
i'm back
I GOT A DOG
"Ooh yeah, good call," Gabriel says, bending forward slightly to check if Michael is bleeding through his shirt. "I think Adam will kill me with his bare hands if your stitches reopen. Rowena, you gotta check on him again!" Rowena follows them out and then Crowley and Ash leave for the hostages. Jo and Eileen go as well to deal with the gold which leaves Sam, Dean and Cas.
As in the archangel?
He was thinking of you when he
Sam sighs and pulls his jacket tighter around himself in the evening chill. "Please tell me you have some good news."
you really think i’m so weak willed to fall for bribery?
Bela apparently had a history with Castiel — they both started up their labels around the same time so they supported one another as they grew their businesses together. They were close despite being part of different brands and Castiel trusted her implicitly.
cas and i went on a date and now we're boyfriends there y'all all caught up now
I know it bothers you. You worry about him. So do I.
dean went “when she turns we’ll turn around too”
“I will be,” Dean says. Cas presses a hand to Dean’s and it’s enough.
Maybe it’s paranoia born out of never having a moment to breathe every time she does something with the Dalís, but she doesn’t have a good feeling. Though the day has been going quite well so far, something always goes wrong. Prime example? Her name being given up. She can't imagine who would do that; she has some people that she's certain would never do this.
"Hey, it's alright," Dean assures. "You okay?"
Dean raises an eyebrow and huffs a laugh, saying, "You’d think that by now you’d realize I don’t want you to be perfect. I want you as you are."
we'll just say it's writing club
Is that better than asking Jack?
There’s only so much he can handle on his own.
Snail dude:
Dean knows his relationship with Cas is very simple; loyal, God-defying and odds-defying. Cas is the one who tore out Chuck's ending and wrote his own because of Dean. That's not something someone can just forget. Dean knows it's deep-rooted in love. Unsure of what kind of love, and if it is mutual, but Dean knew what he felt. He knows it's a dead end.
“Shut up.”
The silence goes over for a few more minutes, serene and relaxing, until Angeles finally asks, "What are you going to do with your share?"
"I don’t know, man. I think he's gonna fire me by the end of today,” Dean mutters. He can hear his heart in his chest. “I wouldn’t normally worry but he’s been in a bad mood since I came back late from lunch and then the whole thing I told you about how nobody was ready for the shoot... How am I supposed to turn this around?”
6 isn't late
im gay
Empty.
Well, good job on the improvement.
Cas stops and turns around. “What is it?”
can i come over?
If I said I didn’t kinda tear up at that, I’d be fucking lying.
"Look, I'm fine," Dean waves off, clearing his throat when Adam arrives at the table. Michael shifts inwards to the window so Adam can sit next to him and Adam's smile falls off his face when he sees Dean.
“Yeah, I am,” Dean affirms.
Cas. You gotta bring him back.
be here with your long coffee
He wonders what Cas prays about.
Dean pauses. "Am I changing offices?"
It’s just power. I don't need it.
Yeah, I wish ‘sorry’ fixed a thousand
Five months after, Palermo still feels just as lonely even with Sam and Jess to keep Cas company. He still missed Dean just as much. He'd had a message passed on to him from Alfie a month after, when the kid had been released, from Dean — that he would be back to him as soon as possible and to not visit him for his own safety.
Michael is silent, staring at the ground. Dean is put off by it.
i think it’s the name of dad’s car
Mentions of blood

something is wrong w sam
"For the outfit," Bela affirms. "And Castiel. All of it."

TW / Violence (fighting, slight suffocation, graphic stabbing, blood) at 3:43 PM section
Dean had gotten concerned about Adam's safety because he'd set up the small television set in one of the offices and checked the news, then he asked Ash to monitor it as well -- nothing about Adam Milligan. Arresting someone related to two of the biggest heists in history would have made front-page news overnight so Dean was more than afraid for Adam. Chances are that he's being detained in the tent without an arrest warrant. He won't be able to rescue Adam unless he gets in that tent.

needed to ice you.
Dean frowns in an amused kind of way. "What are you talking about?"
loved me and that was enough?
Dean sends him a sarcastic reaction image and stows his phone away, beaming at Castiel who just rolls his eyes.
John Winchester, Dean Winchester
Dean shakes his head, “No, I can go. Do I need to make a reservation?”
"I got you," Adam assures. When it hits one minute and he hears the alarms go off from Dean's end of the earpiece, he tells him, "You have three minutes exactly."
Dean looks over at Cas and gives him a bright smile. "We can just push them together."
“I think they’re great,” Dean says honestly. “I can imagine them wearing these and looking awesome. Man, you could literally get started on these tomorrow.”
Michael blinks but refuses to show his confusion on his face. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Cas’s eyes are steely when he answers. “Sam Winchester.”
Cas looks like he’s about to explode — two days to the Emmy’s and there’s a big hole in Viola Davis’s dress. Everyone there is going to see the horrible attempt at reparation. Dean says quietly to Kevin, “Bring the dress to Isaac, see if he can fix the hole.” Kevin nods, taking the dress and hesitating, checking if Cas is alright with him leaving before he goes. Alan watches Cas as if, if he took his eyes off of him for a second, he would get shot. Dean puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder and watches them sag when their eyes connect as if just the touch of Dean is enough to stop him from going into hysteria over a torn dress.
Jack leans on a large potted plant, crying to themselves.
“Thank you for bringing me,” Dean says sincerely.

This is what Pop wanted to get
sammy’s sick it’s just us today
What are you gonna do with it?
“Yes, I just came here to let you know what happened to the tapes,” Anael clarifies. “Adam already arranged it with Michael.”
"Okay, not too bad. I'll make sure she doesn't bully him again," he says. "Today was fucking crazy and I wasn't even around to witness most of it."
John answers, “Not really, officer. I just keep to myself.”
Anael slips it into her pants pocket, nodding. “Yeah, I’ll take care of it. I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions.”
"Meg, get down!" Dean shouts, pulling on Meg's arm to get them both to drop to the ground as the grenade detonates behind him. All logic went out of the window, no voice in his mind telling him that if he kills Abaddon, they're done for. There is only one voice telling him that she's killed two of his family, so fuck whatever happens to her.
there’s this really cute guy and he keeps ordering black coffee at the cafe i work at but every time he drinks it he looks disgusted so i wanna bring him something sweeter but i get weak in the knees when i get near
“Thanks, Sammy,” Dean grins, pulling Sam into his side for a quick hug. “If you come to visit, let me know in advance. I watched
Cas chews on his lower lip, putting his hands on his hips as his gaze casts down to the floor. Italian tiles that Cas and Dean had picked together, tiles Dean has seen almost every day for the past five years and now Dean will be going to prison voluntarily, and he won’t see these tiles beneath his feet.
Sam calls out before he disappears through the basement door with Rowena, “I’ll see you soon, brother.”
and PROUD of it
Kelly raises her eyebrows. “Sorry?”
Michael presses his lips together and casts his gaze down on the linoleum floor. “I’m a CO this time. And Dean asked me to not tell you.”
YOU IMPROVED SO MUCH
I love you.
Anael doesn’t have a good feeling about today.
“Hey, you need to chill the hell out,” Dean snaps. Gadreel stares at Dean like he’s just killed Gabriel in front of Castiel.
DEAN (O.S.)
Castiel says, “I think I’m going to tell my own brother. We’re going to church on Sunday, I think I’ll tell him then. And given what I’ll be telling him, the location is a little ironic but church calms me down.”
Be honest with me, please. Would
But now he has Dean, who not only loves cooking but is good at it. Dean insists that they try not to eat out so much during their month in Paris and let Dean cook. Or, even better, let Dean teach him how to cook. Dean was excited at the prospect of teaching Cas how to cook, even buying an apron for the occasion with a ridiculous 'KISS THE COOK' printed in bold black on the pocket.
I’m not opposed.
Gabriel shuts right up, staring at Castiel. “What do you mean Dean?”
I always thought that after we
what???
Jess would remain a sore spot for Sam for the rest of his life, and Dean felt awful about almost bringing up the way Sam got together with some girl with a degree in hotel management half a year after who looked an awful lot like Jess, down to the mole on her face and the pleasant smile. Sam broke up with her the moment she broke the illusion by asking him to meet her parents.
The way to Cas’s apartment has long ingrained itself into Dean’s mind, the path there was almost like a childhood memory with the familiarity. He knew Sam and Eileen were out on a date right now which was probably for the better. Though, even if they were there, Dean doubted it would have made the situation better or worse. He was too angry. Not angry enough to not be sensible — he'd hailed a cab instead of driving.
The thing about Toni is that she's not afraid to do immoral things to get what she wants, so she finds a vent in the next office and climbs in, pulling the lid back over as she crawls through as silently as she can in case other Dalís hear her. Once she looks through the bars and sees Palermo looking to the door, Kansas thankfully having fallen back into unconsciousness, she takes the lid off and silently descends, landing in the room behind her. Grabbing a glass ashtray, Toni skulks up behind Palermo and slams the ashtray to her temple, knocking her out after another hit that draws blood.
for real?
Snail dude:
wow tell him how you really feel
"Be careful. Be quick. Out and in," Dean says instead, readying his rifle. He had no intention to open fire because he didn't think the cops would do it. Just out and in. The moment Adam says 'now', the doors open and they run out.
Dean pulls Crowley to the side, out of the camera’s range, and starts, “Do you think you’re the only one with a family to look out for? Everyone sacrificed something to come here and save you, you’re just gonna throw them into the meat grinder?”
Sorry, can’t. I need to go home early. Maybe next time.
How romantic of him.
good luck
There's a heavily silent beat that passes before he speaks up again, "
you knew him before???
"Have fun," Michael nods, giving Cas a side-hug before putting out the cigarette under his shoe, walking back to the car.
"Thanks," Dean replies, watching as Angeles settles against a pillar, lifting his mask to show his face. They didn't really worry about their identities in the bank. By the time they get out and give witness statements, they'll be scattered all over Earth on their own business. Untraceable like every gold grain and dollar bill they will leave with.
They talk about anything that comes to mind and it almost feels like a date. Almost, because Dean still can’t find an opening to allude to their kiss after the runway show, but they are enjoying themselves over Italian dinner and they’re laughing. It feels nice. There is a moment where Cas gets tomato sauce on his nose somehow which he wipes off with his hand and he licks it off his thumb, and Dean has a fleeting want to kiss him but he stays at his side of the table.
Dean agrees, "Nobody's leaving, not until I think of something. Until then, we have to keep operations going." Detroit looks like he wants to argue but he doesn't say anything else, stepping away from the conversation. Sighing, Dean asks, "Cas, can I talk to you alone?"
, Winchester.“
“But don’t worry!” Kevin quickly says, realizing that he may be psyching Dean out. “He won’t ask you to do that kind of thing. You’re just keeping track of events, picking up stuff and calling people for him. Posters and all that will be the next marketing director’s job. Yours is good.”
no it's my brain get your own
Dean is a hollow shell for the rest of the day, from when he pretends to wake up later in the day for school, to when he comes home. Sam's obviously too young to have any sense of if Dean's out of it or not, but he does insist on hugging Dean. Maybe Sam's psychic or something. Jo notices. She always notices, but she just offers him a hug and doesn't try asking what the problem was. She probably already knew, or just didn't want to remind him about it.
Charlie drags Missouri over to look at a brown suit with button detailing while Dean busies himself with one of the looks, a grey velvet coat with a darker grey suit underneath. It’s a simple look, but classic, and Dean wonders if Cas would buy it. He’d look good.
be in pain.
MICHAEL
why do you call him wings
Chuck burned Michael inside out.
The first thing the SWAT team will do is to case the building and see how their set up is like. They can't do that very well from outside, which means they will only rely on a small camera and instructions from the tent on how to proceed. Dean has all the hostages dressed in the same red coveralls as him and his team and distributed Dali masks as well. Now, they are indistinguishable from the robbers, all one and the same.
“Winchester, Clarence is calling off Shurley's Heaven magazine shoot for April and replacing it with the Tom Ford shoot from June,” Meg says from the other end of the phone. “You need to pick up his coffee order on the way to the office right now and handle it.”

"I'm 30 years old, Gabriel," Castiel points out.
Violet shifts uncomfortably.
Dean shrugs, tries to play it off, “You know, you reserved this dinner as a date for me and Pax, right? So since you’re coming instead of him, then it’s a date for you and me.”
go to sleep ???
ROWENA
“I don’t fucking know, that one bullshit piece that Belphegor kid did on Patricia Nicolás,” Lucian suggests bitterly. “Stop printing and switch that article out.”
Wait. No, nevermind. Too loud, maybe.
you were talking about someone else that i also know
They all turn to see none other than Chuck.
I think that was the moment I
Dean echoes in disbelief, “
for such a petite woman — and Bela smiles. “That’s for being a colossal fool.” Before John could react, she turns him around by his shoulders and he just looks so discombobulated that Dean almost laughs. "Now walk away and don't come back. You're not welcome."
coat, you walked here? That won’t keep you warm in
... told me something. He said
Rowena, Inias, Isaac, Mirabel, and Bess deny it too after that, and Balthazar sighs, "Cassie, you're a close friend of mine. I couldn't even if I wanted to. I'd feel too bad."
“Fuck,” Anael curses, gesturing to Hannah to split up to look for Alastair. As soon as Hannah is gone, she switches to her private channel with Michael and says, “Alastair has a shiv. I don’t know who he plans to get, but you check on Dean and Gabriel.”
Reluctantly, Dean relents, knowing that he could either contest Cas all day or agree with him and start the search party. He walks over and supports Cas up off the bed. He helps with securing a Kevlar vest on his body and slings the rifle over his shoulder. He redistributes, "Fine. Santiago with Lebanon. Dallas, you go work on the tunnel. I think we should get out of here by tomorrow. Berlin, with Athens. Angeles, you're coming with me. Everyone clear?" At their nods, Dean sends them off and they go down separate paths in the bank, wary and alert.
“Get them prepped for the models when they arrive,” Castiel orders. Duma nods and runs off to prepare the outfits and Castiel turns back to Dean. “If you want boundaries, then get a job somewhere else. This isn’t for you.”
Do you think they’re here?
"I'll go catch up with Michael and Gabriel," Cas says, leaving them in the office with Gilda.
he closed off immediately ?? saying we didn't need to meet whoever he was dating
Angeles hesitates before reporting, "I don't like being a snitch but I thought you'd want to know that Vegas tried to get Sam to stitch Chuck up."
[Vera Wang Fall 2019, look 1]
He presses his lips together and trails her back to the main area of the suite where all the outfits are. "Look, as long as he doesn't know you know, I think it's alright."
Dean levels him a look. "Okay, and how much of that was actually his words?"
you can...
Dean hauls himself off his ass with Salem's help and he raises his rifle, joining in the shooting. With the SWAT team slightly slowed down by the grenades, Dean calls out, "Angeles!" He doesn't hear him this time, still shooting, and Dean tries again, "Angeles!
“You guys always talk about your coworkers like this?” Dean asks, acting appalled. “I’m afraid of what you say about me when I’m not here.”
Sam Winchester, Crowley MacLeod, Gabriel Novak
And now I can't sleep.
Alright, so maybe he has a crush on this snail-collecting, Sherlock-like guy. So what?
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH HIM??? who named him THAT
Before Dean can say anything in response, bullets suddenly blast at them and they both drop to the ground, looking over. Abaddon laughs loudly, sadistically, as she shoots from her rifle. Dean thanks God that they all decided to wear their Kevlar vests. Both of them get behind the elevator's sides and start to fire at her from the vague cover. Dean shouts over the noise, "If you need to stop shooting, then stop!"
We knew it was in October. Halloween is one of the last dates.
“Yes,” Cas affirms, running a hand down the front of his blazer from his chest to his waist. “And?”
“The office,” Dean answers, sniffing as he looks up at the ceiling light above him. “Nobody here and I didn’t feel like going home.”
ROWENA
They pull up outside a small abandoned warehouse where Dean had stored weaponry and explosives. They had no intention of using them to harm anyone, simply just to ensure that the police cooperated. In actuality, the hostages will be under their protection while they hijacked the bank.
Frustrated, Adam runs a hand through his hair.
So, do you have it?
Cas goes quiet.
"Yeah, Berlin's good. He's sharp, smart, adaptable, calm under pressure... But you're all those things too," Dean points out. "Why not you?"
In the bank, the three hostages manage to find the room Abaddon and the guards are held in and they get to work on the handcuffs. One of them digs out a paperclip from a drawer and picks the lock on it until something in it clicks. The cuffs slip off Abaddon's wrists with ease.
"Dean," Castiel cuts over. "You tried anyway. Thank you."
“We should go back to the hotel,” Castiel says, standing up. He turns to the barista and smiles, “Merci, au revoir."
Just got home from meeting him. His body type and gait suggest that he imbibes copious quantities of alcohol. Shaky hands, craving for his next drink, possibly kept off it for a while to make a good impression on me. It's not working, not with what I know about him from Dean.
Give me my angel back.
“Spangler? Really,
Cas visibly looks drained. "Why me?" Dean can't help but chuckle at that and it does bring a faint smile to Cas's face even if it doesn't last long.
"Let's not be too hasty. We're getting crucified right now by everyone outside this tent," Naomi mutters, massaging her temples. "Letting go of Adler was easy, but that bitch Abaddon just dropped my name and let's be real, it's obvious that the British man is you. And those fucking caskets, someone just hurry up and get them to the morgue before they release more state secrets." Donna Hanscum runs out to get on it.
"Your faith in the authorities is misplaced," Castiel says in his most placating tone.
Michael?
"I'll tell them as soon as I can," Mick promises just before Ketch comes in. Mick is sent out promptly but he stays near the partition in an attempt to catch anything else that can be of use to Dean.
Instead, she surprises him. “And you’re cheating on him with that inmate.”
"Why are you wearing a mask and they aren't?" One of the surgeons asks, glancing at Crowley and Meg.
at the moment, there still aren’t
Cas likes writing. I don't know what he writes, he never wants to show me, or anyone, but he enjoys it. It's cute. Maybe one day he'll show me.
Angeles has a wall of steel up, being as good a co-leader as he can muster himself to be after Balthazar, but Dean knows he's losing his grip on that. It's only a matter of time before Angeles breaks or worse, and Dean doesn't want to imagine losing Angeles. He's too important; to the heist, to the other robbers, to him.
Crowley smiles tightly. “My respect lies with the city-named commander with the Dalí mask who walked right into a police tent and tricked them into saving his life. My loyalties lie with myself.”
i was made aware that dean thinks we don't like him
Once Inias is done talking to Castiel, he leaves and Dean asks, “Is there anything else you need to be done, sir?”
"Look, you need it and we don’t have another choice," Cas insists, looking over his gun before pulling his mask back down over his face.
that’s what happened.
“I sell weapons, you think I care?” Roman replies with disinterest. “Two; Anael Jo and Michael Milligan. You put in a favour for me to hire them and now one of them is in the hospital. Are you aware that that puts a spotlight on my prison? Makes it very difficult to handle my business discreetly when authorities are examining it, so you better explain.”
“I’m Kansas, the mastermind of the heist of the Bank of America and the Diamonds Factory. My name is Dean Winchester.”
His brother looks at him, realisation sinking through him. It’s silent and still for a few seconds until Gabriel pulls him into a hug and it comes crashing into Castiel like a wave on a shore; He tried so hard to keep this part of himself hidden from everyone else for thirty years, even his own brother, and yet, with it finally out on the table, it’s incredible just how
. Dean peers over her shoulder in his strain and sees Cas holding up a finger to his lips, a blue tie in his hand.
“I know.”
"Well, it's my job," Dean says.
Rowena asks quietly, "Am I exerting your stitches?"
Sam nods absently, asking, “Dean, can I talk to you?” Dean follows him a few feet away from Eileen, Jo, Ellen, and Bobby, and Sam starts, “I feel so bad.”
ending. Cain and Abel, the whole
summon it. Obviously, going in
No. What are you doing here?
“Did you see the news?” Dean asks, looking back at Sam and Eileen who seem to be texting people about it. Sam gets on a call with Adam.
Even with their grief, they knew they had to move or Benny's sacrifice was for nothing. They quickly change into their disguises -- not all of them can be in the escape truck just as a safety measure, and instead will be hiding in plain sight. Sam, Meg and Crowley get into the back of the truck with all the loot since they would get recognised and caught walking around, and Anael and Adam take the driver and passenger seats, driving off to meet up with the rest at the house Dean rented later in the day to split the loot.
Cas and Crowley rejoin them, now in the red jumpsuits alone without the security jackets and caps from earlier. Dean turns away from signing to Eileen instructions for the gold vault and gives Cas as light a smile as he can muster. "Hey, Cas."
“Lilith is going to make me sell drugs,” Dean explains calmly.
With a little Luck, maybe Dean will forget about the way Cas smiles in the thin orange light of the lamp when they're both alone in the office.
"No gun because that's a little risky here but we do have a lightsaber Bobby got Dean for his birthday last year," Sam answers, pulling it out. It's the kind with retractable coloured plastic. "Not the best and not even the correct colour, but I'll make do."
Castiel and Eileen choose not to eat so much, appetite lacking, so Sam and Dean gorge themselves on as much food as their plate can carry. Eileen makes an offhand comment about how embarrassing they are and Castiel laughs, signing something to her that Dean isn't well-versed enough to understand, but it makes a grin split across Eileen's face and that's good enough for Dean.
i'll come along.
Jess runs through the crowd of people gathered outside the Factory to watch the robbery unfold, muttering apologies as she gets to the front. Cas filled her in on Dean's plan and she'd left her station instantly, running down the street to the Factory. She stands at the barricade the police had set up, squinting to locate Dean.
"You're scared out of your mind, you're practically the human embodiment of an earthquake. You were at the coat rack. What did you do?" Castiel asks again, voice leaving no room for bullshit. "This has been a tense morning. I suggest that you don't fuck around with me."
“That’s fine.” Naomi nods understandingly. “I’ll just note down to also arrest Ruby for assisting in hiding a criminal from the authorities.”
I need to get away from here.
Michael gives control to Adam, eyes flashing blue.
Right as Cas says yes, grinning, Michael's eyes widen. "
Dean's hands instantly go up and he assures, "I'm unarmed. You can check. I don't even have one in the glovebox. I just wanted to talk to you." The thief narrows his eyes and cocks his head, wary, before checking the compartments in the car -- no guns or recorders.
You forget that we're both boys.
"Dean," Cas barely utters. "You came back."
"We're free," Dean affirms. "And Cas? I promise you that's the last time I'll ever do anything like that again."
Gadreel says quietly, “Mr Novak, the models are waiting outside. Should I let them in?”
“Okay, dude, what is this?” Dean asks, stepping back to look at Crowley with a suspicious look.
Thank you for reading <3
pray to me again. I’ll always
"Someone was shot on the roof," Sam says, sounding like he's beginning to panic. "We have an ambulance on the way for him. If you'll bring him to the door, we can tend to him."
we never went home
Sigh.
,” Dean reminds. “Second, what, did Castiel tell you I said that?”
Dean puts his legs up on the desk in one of the offices, belonging to some dude named Lee Webb. Someone knocks on the office door and Dean tells them to come in. Cas stops at the doorway. "Hello, Dean."
“Me neither,” Sam says wistfully. The mood dampens slightly when Sam adds, “I used to have this recurring dream when I was a kid. I don’t get it anymore, but it was like... you, me and Dad in LA. I don’t know why I had it, I don’t know what LA’s like, but I kept getting that dream. I just wish Dad was more of a dad and took us, you know?”
how did you ask him out in the first place
The memories stop playing and the Shadow looks around, wide-eyed as if checking to see if anybody has woken up — nobody. It looks UNSETTLED.
Meg and Balthazar occasionally show him how it works backstage if Castiel is busy talking to other designers. It's so busy there, packed with makeup teams and models. It's insane for Dean to be in a room where he isn't the tallest person around for once. Being 6'1, Dean's used to it, but there are models just as tall and even a handful who are
Castiel already has a limo waiting for them when they arrive to take them straight to the Palazzo Reale. The runways aren't so different from the New York ones other than the location and brands present. But still, it's exciting every time.
He leans against the doorway and gives them his easiest smile, asking, "Having fun?"
"To Palermo, yeah," Dean grins, sunny and maybe a little bit excited at the idea. "You know, I'm thinking Il Capo, I saw that they're big on art and I know you like that kind of thing. Or Castellammare? The nightlife there's fucking great, there's gonna be good music and dancing --"
but i was just told that he punched that metatron guy for talking shit about him
Castiel barely smiles and walks back to the main part of the living room to watch the news. They announce a press conference by the president and the other three quickly move to the couch to see what it's about. He sits on the armrest next to Bela. The president comes up on the screen, camera flashes going off on his face as he speaks.
They had a cell-phone that Anael brought into the prison for them and left in the interiors of their hollow steel bedposts. Dean relayed all the new information to Meg when it was an hour past lights out and together, they tried to readjust the plan as such:
up myself? Well, here I am.
do not sound like that."
Cas and Crowley move to the landing zone and Crowley orders, "Sorry, but you're going to have to move to the main lobby. We're investigating a possible break-in."
Before Dean can press about it, two men walk into the office; the taller one of them has dark hair and green eyes and the other is blonde, young blue eyes, and an awkward smile. The taller one is dressed in a plain white shirt, a black bomber jacket, and basic dark blue jeans while the blonde man is in flannel and denim. Obviously not from the fashion industry and Dean doesn’t know them, so he can’t imagine what they would possibly want to meet him for —
Gabriel tries, “You were just being selfless, Michael. Hey, you only have a year left. Maybe less than that if you try to keep good behaviour in the next couple of months. Once you’re out, you could go look for him again.”
I love that.
Three weeks after agreeing to the heist, Dean woke up in bed to see Cas looking at him next to him, a book in his hands. Dean smiled, runs his knuckles over Cas’s cheekbone, and greeted, "Morning, sunshine."
Cas nods, adding nervously, “Of course. I wanted to make it up to you, so I made a reservation for you and Pax tonight at 8 for Bouley. It has an 80’s aesthetic to it and I remember you wearing a Led Zeppelin shirt once. I thought you might like the retro setting.”
The thing about having an experienced jewel thief on your side of things is that he knows exactly how to conquer most, if not all, security measures placed before him. Most of the vault breaking plans had been thought of by Cas, with just some suggestions by Dean. That's why he's in charge of getting to the diamonds.
that's my job
Dean starts to regret doing this on a call instead of text. He tries, "You know what, I'm beat, man. I'll talk to you tomorrow --"
Gayz II Women
Dean looks around at the other devouts praying and turns to Castiel, requesting, "Can you teach me how to pray?"
Uncertain but I think I can go too.
no michaels allowed
Adam looks surprised - he thought Michael didn’t hear anything since he would be asleep.
“His Sherlock thing. He learned it from you,” Dean clarifies, rubbing his hands together as he glances out of the car window. Cas looks back at him and Dean waves him off. Cas hesitates but nods, going off with Sam into school.
Where is your brother?
"I know a thief when I see one. You would have taken it if I didn't," the man replies, just as quiet, and puts some distance between them to look at bandaids. He interests himself with a box of Star Wars-themed ones as Adam stares at him in wonder.
Cas asks, the first time he’s speaking since Rowena dropped the bomb on them, “What’s he in for?”
"He's new," a surgeon explains, taking the needle and thread from him. "I'll do it."
See for yourself.
One hour passed. Sam calls Kansas and waits for him to pick up. When the beeping ends, he immediately gets to business, "What's your choice?"
Keep it.
Gabriel nods lazily, looking through his supplies to get the toothbrush. “Any luck?”
Castiel himself is an enigma. More often than not, Castiel comes in, spills orders onto Dean’s desk and then leaves to handle other business. Dean rarely gets to see him for more than five minutes at a time which is bewildering as his personal assistant. Though, he did get to see him a little more recently so Dean chalked it up to how he was probably just busy with tying up all the loose ends before he hired Dean.
We’ll give you what you want.
"Well, if she calls, I'll gladly do it," Cas replies. After Gabriel nods, it's quiet again between them. Cas starts to try and gather the courage before Gabriel says something and he has to find another opportunity. Who knows how long that will take?
you when you go for good.
“Everyone’s a kid to you, you gigantic asshole,” Dean bullies. When he hears the elevator doors ding, Dean quickly puts the photo down and retreats back to his desk. “Hey, Castiel’s back. You wanna ask him about that car?”
"We didn't even want to come," Cas says absently.
should i come over tomorrow
"Yes, Winchester. It's good," Castiel affirms. "I don't have the words to thank you. I think if I had to see that headline all over every tabloid in the country, I'd kill myself."
WHERE IS HE
The snails are doing fine. Bee's a little slower than usual but I think he's just lazy. Clarence and Chevy get along well. I wish Cas could come over more often to see them. I send him photos of them all the time but it doesn't feel like it's enough.
Castiel is still learning about the human race. Even though he'd spent the last couple of years of his life around humans, while he learned, he still didn't know.
"Maybe he's jealous that Winchester's getting some," Meg smirks.
Where do you want to go?
“Pamela couldn’t be here right now so I offered to get you all settled in,” she explains. “Pam used to help keep some of Mr Novak’s events in order but since you’re here now, you’ll be doing that.”
"Why not
Dean feels confronted.
gonna give u a big big kiss when i see u <3
Dean nods slowly, the gears in his brain shifting as he thinks. "So I need to stop Naomi from printing the article."
Anael appears at his cell door, practically a sight for sore eyes. She goes in, shutting the cell behind her. “I got rid of all the security footage. What the fuck were you thinking, Dean? Killing Roman’s favourite toy?”
the Empty?
Hannah blinks. "A writer of NOVAK's came to me and Marie Claire to organise this so I suppose you can say we're working together."
"What about Hannah?" Dean asks.
Dean clears his throat and says, his voice comically gruff, "Hey, Cas."
Cas laughs, kissing Dean sweetly before standing and taking one of the dresses off of the rack. Cas came over to work on some dresses from the fall collection presently in production. Cas takes them back to his own house if he doesn't intend on staying over, but for tonight, Dean's pretty happy that Cas plans to stay the night. While Cas doesn't personally work on all the pieces of a collection, there are a few that are special to him that he insists on doing himself. Only he is allowed to bring pieces home with him, though. Dean heard of a former designer who brought a piece home to finish and ended up getting fired because Kevin reported him thinking that he stole it when he couldn't find it in the workshop.
that is kinda better i guess...
mean, I know Chuck lost, but...
What he knows about vault security in America is that they don't cover thermal lances or explosives, or they're at least not one of the main testing points for vaults. Either way, Dean intended to have Berlin and some great blacksmiths weld a hole and build an interconnection antechamber on the 14-ton vault door within the sixteen minutes it takes to fill up. Without opening the door, one of them will go through the chamber and come out the other end to weld the tube to the vault. They'll have to use the remaining time from the sixteen minutes after construction. It's risky, but Dean is sure they can do it. Once it's welded, the gold will be free to grab.
Dean closes his eyes and basks in the gentle warmth of the horizon, breathing in Italian air and listening to the sound of Anael and Charlie trying to convince one to let the other pass the ring to Adam and Michael when it’s time. He opens them again and turns to see Michael looking at the sunset. He asks, “So you’re taking Adam’s name, huh?”
DEAN I NEED HELP
"Good, good. You should tell him where you're comfortable," Kelly smiles, clearly glad, “This is amazing progress, Castiel. And you’re sure you’re ready?”
did something happen?
“Nothing,” Cas replies. Cas never lies, at least not often, so Dean still doesn’t know of any of his tells. He doesn’t know when he’s lying or not. When Sam lies, he tends to bristle and look away. When Jo lies, she gets flustered and giggles a little too much. When Ellen or Bobby lie, they get this weird macho act and get defensive. Cas? Cas is unpredictable. Dean still doesn’t know what he’s gonna get with him.

cassie are you ok
playing from his phone and he seriously wonders why he's kept that song as his ringtone for this long. He looks at the caller ID:
Crowley gives him a look, the kind where he's calling you ridiculous without even having to one his mouth, but he catches himself. Maybe he's intuitive enough to know Dean's being dead serious and a snarky comment would deprive him of the answer he wants to hear. Either way, Crowley answers, "My mother knows when to keep her mouth shut. And she didn't have to. I've been friends with Wings for years. I know what he's like. I know what he likes. He's not exactly Mr Subtle."
CAS HAS ANOTHER BROTHER???
"Are you working with a writer from NOVAK and the CEO of Marie Claire?" Bela asks as the door clicks shut.
Kevin leans against the desk and asks, “How’s your first day so far, P.A.?”
I loved him and I never got to
Michael is quiet, but Gabriel can tell that he’s thinking now. Michael’s throat works as he blinks himself into a more sober state. “He’d be disappointed.”
Joking, Anael says, “I’d think that’s something Angeles would say.”
He turns to look at him, and Dean watches the way Cas shrugs out of his Prada trench coat, hanging it up on the rack. “Okay.”
Do you think we’re it? We’re all
Castiel rolls his eyes, and his smile seems to stop the rain. "You're ridiculous."
wow, don't sugarcoat it, wings.
"No," Dean says, trying to be as comfortable as he can. He knows he'll be here for a while.
fuck class man
"I'd think a lot of celebrities would have been booking this dress for ages," Bela says. "So how did you get it in time for a last-minute styling?"
She sees Adam watching the news in the diner near the bank, sipping on coffee. She slips into the seat next to him, asking, "You're Adam Winchester, right?"
Dean barely gets any sleep until Castiel wakes up at 6:30 AM for the flight to Paris. Castiel smells like the hotel's lavender shampoo, the cigarette smoke that clings to his clothes, and there's an underlying scent of something like fire, almost. Or he just smells like Castiel. Dean stops himself and frowns when he realizes he's actually thinking about what his boss smells like.
"Yeah, and —" Dean suddenly cuts himself off, pulling a dramatically appalled expression at him, his mouth in an 'O' shape. "You motherfucker." Crowley chuckles and waves his hand to tell him he's just playing. "Man, enough."
understand. One of you idiots woke
Crowley hands Rowena off to Jess and says, "You have to act like you're here for Dean and say you found my mother instead. Get her help."
Are you going to go back?
Castiel looks like he’s barely holding back the urge to roll his eyes as he replies, “That’s fine, we’re a little early anyway. But where the fuck is the collection?”
looks so beautiful. I should get the photo printed.
This is what Crowley has to deal with while Dean is still unconscious:
"Yeah, can I talk to you outside?" Dean asks, using his thumb to point over his shoulder. Frowning in thought, Cas nods and leaves Gabriel and Michael to continue talking among themselves as he joins Dean in the hallway. Dean moves them into the office across the hallway and once they're alone, out of Michael and Gabriel's earshot, he says, "I need to tell you something but you gotta promise you won't overreact."
"You were
“Once for me,” Anael corrects. “And you never got Bela, Balthazar and Benny out.”
Dean turns around to see Michael, in Adam’s vessel.
"Then whose is it?" Castiel asks.
Adam?
When he comes back, Sam says flatly, “You didn’t have to do that.”
Cas says, disturbed, “I was hoping that you would say that your death wouldn't be a possibility." Dean winces -- maybe he should have said 'I can't die' and put his boyfriend's heart at ease. Now that Cas said that, it sounded like a far better answer than the one he gave.
He ate the pie I made and he liked it.
i like this arrangement
Inias smiles at him, “Have fun at Fashion Week, Dean.” Castiel hangs up and calls Inias in and he waves once at Dean before going into the office.
most demonic bitches i know
After I realised he was sleeping, I hung up.
“Why wouldn’t he?” Dean questions. Cas doesn’t have an answer.
"Tell them the area's restricted, stop them," Sam says, following him out of the tent to spot the motorcycles. Victor signals to the SWAT officers nearer to the drivers and they shout to them, waving their arms. The motorcycles ram right through the yellow police tape, tearing them up as they speed up towards the bank. Sam's eyes widen, shouting, "Who the hell are they? Stop them!"
Dean gives him a sheepish smile, explaining, "They thought we were here to visit the kids and I felt kinda bad about it so I promised that we would drop by before we leave." Cas nods, trying to peer into Sam's bag.
This is Satan's time.
“Okay, why do you think that?” Dean asks, looking up from a spot on the floor to Sam. “He’s great! Yeah, he’s sarcastic, his humour’s a little deadpan, but he’s also nice and —“
“It’s a prison break, Gabe. Not a heist. We can’t afford a big team,” Dean points out. “Are you coming or not?”
Dean winces. "His brother wants to see me tomorrow."
"I'd love to meet them," she says conversationally. "Will you do anything tonight?"
Sam glances at Dean, who looks determined. He’s switched out his grief for motivation.
When they enter the elevator to meet up with Cas and Belphegor in the hotel lobby, Crowley snaps right back to his normal self.
Gone, I'm sad to say. Exterminated
HOW DID IT GO
“What block is he in?”
"I'll manage," Castiel assures.

A shuffling sound over the receiver lets Dean think that Sam is consulting with his colleagues. A moment later, Sam says, "At least let us send in a medical team.
The boy says flatly, “You’re on the wrong floor. The party is upstairs.”
by Steppenwolf.
Sam frowns, confused.
Adam is DISGUSTED.
What did Dad say about
On Sunday after a last-minute dinner, the paparazzi finally manage to catch them. They'd been trying to get Dean and Cas since they came back but Cas had expertly navigated through and away from them those times. You just can't run forever.
Zachariah challenges, "They have
Now alone with Jack, Lucifer turns to him, inviting.
When Metatron picks up, Dean instantly decides that he doesn't like him. Metatron's voice somehow toes the line between whiny and smug as he complains about Cas being unable to appreciate true literature. Dean asks him what the article was about. Metatron says it's going to be a headliner for Cosmopolitan magazine, about how Cas and Dean might be secretly dating. Dean laughs in his face for the balls he has to tell them about the article, then he says if he sees the article go into print in the next issue of Cosmopolitan, Dean will make sure he eats every page about the article from every copy of the issue.
Who the hell--
He walks through the halls, mostly ignoring the inmates. Given that he’ll only be there for less than 14 days, Michael doesn’t care enough to bother scrutinising them. They’re not his problem, someone else can do it.
He nods hesitantly. "I cannot shake the feeling that there is something wrong. You are acting a lot like Dean, and Dean is acting like you." Dean hadn't expected Cas to notice, but Cas is the smartest guy Dean knows and honestly, it's not like Sam and he are Oscar winners. To believe Cas would fall for it is probably insulting.
“Who’re you?” Gabriel asks conversationally.
So after Cas gives him the task of stealing a model from Harper's Bazaar that he claims is too good to be wasted on that magazine, Dean accepts the model's invitation to a dinner for two. (This has Sam absolutely bewildered, asking him
Do you want to name it?
"I'm good," Dean assures. "Alright, so you and Bela have a lunch reservation at 1 at The Modern. You have a photoshoot with her afterwards that you said you were going immediately to from lunch, for Vogue Magazine by Hannah Johnson. After that, I think you and Kevin are meeting to discuss NOVAK's SS16 collection and then you're done for the day."
“No problem,” Dean replies. “Anyway, you were saying about Gabriel being shit-faced?”
and time. An unstoppable force
up where they came from.
"Hey, Dean," Jess smiles. "Systems are up."
"Last chance," Toni says, the tip of her syringe pressing gently against his neck. "Or you die a slow and painful death."
nobody has talked to dad like that before
you’ve showered?
"Dean," Mick says, hoping to God that Adam knows Dean's name and that it means something to him. It does because he can see Adam trying not to burst out laughing in triumph. "If you have anything to tell him, I can try to get the message to him."
Dean settles next to Cas on the hood and says, pointing to the earplugs, "You should put these in right about now." Cas obeys, putting them in his ears and giving Dean a thumbs up when he can't hear Dean anymore. Sam sits on Cas's other side, legs kicking excitedly in anticipation.
I AM NOT SMELLY
“For what?”
you… Oh, yeah!
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Adam says weakly; he knows it doesn’t help.
No, I meant with Cas.
The police car's sirens wail loudly as it drives past them.
"I agree with you there," Cas mumbles, looking over each sketch with scrutiny. He finally points out two designs each for the dress and the suit, saying, "I think these ones have the most potential. Of course, you know them better than me so go with your gut, but I like those ones."
Correction: I have met Bela.
“We wouldn’t be in this if you didn’t ask him to join you on your heist.”
Adam listens to the soft 'beep' of the barcode scanner as a woman buys something at the counter. He paces the shelves, trying to find an opening to swipe some medicine without getting caught. He didn't have enough money on-hand to buy everything he needed when he was already using what little he had for rent, bills and taxes.
You could bring her back out.
“Surprise.”
but it is vast. The damage has to
“Oh, that? Nah, I just didn’t like the guy,” Dean says breezily. “Anyone want champagne? I’ll go get us some.”
Cas asks, "If you worked so well then why did you break up? If you're okay with telling me."
Dean snaps his fingers in recognition, “You always sit at the front! I literally only know how the back of your head looks like.”
"Are you dating Bela Talbot? She was in Paris, did she visit you?" one of the paps shout above the noise. Cas narrows his eyes at the reporter and mutters a no, trying to get to the car. Then another pap tries a different name, "What about Dean? There have been rumours online that you are dating your assistant —"
Belonging to something and feeling belonged are two very different things.
“Hey, you did the right thing. He shouldn’t have been talking to them like that,” Sam assures. “But if you feel this bad about it, then you could try to undo the damage, do something good. What could you do?”
Dean gives him a meaningful look for a split second before turning back to shoot at the SWAT team. He shouts over the gunfire, "Then when you see Angeles again, tell him I love him!"
Missouri and Dede exchange shocked looks and Missouri asks, raising her own handheld microphone to Abaddon's face, "Why did you kill them?"
"Do it yourself. Take the phone," Dean says incredulously when he sees Chuck shrink back. "I thought you wanted the phone. Now that you have to take it yourself, you don't want it?" When Chuck doesn't make a move to grab it, Dean shoves it into his pocket with a roll of his eyes. He hated people who won't do anything themselves.
I was thinking of the name Clarence today.
Violet is retrieving him as we
“You know, if you want to meet her that badly, I could arrange lunch or dinner with her and you could invite your brother,” Castiel offers. He pulls out a folder from one of his drawers and Dean sits in the chair on the opposite end of the desk. "It wouldn't be much trouble, but I don't guarantee her free time."
Suddenly, the whole group is there (except for Dallas, Paris and Salem) and Dean informs them, "Abaddon's in the vents, we don't know where she is."
“Maybe,” Dean says carefully. He doesn’t want it to sound like he’s accusing Cas of being an asshole. Yeah, he
And then?
He keeps his pace normal but quick as he walks by inmates and guards — CO H. Johnson had given him a strange look as he passed — and when there are no more people around, he speeds up and comes through the door of the med bay, seeing Adam in a white coat. The other doctor, Rufus Turner, doesn’t seem to be around.

This is it. Tomorrow will be the operation, and then it’s in God’s hands. I trust him to make the right decision, but if it were in my power, I’d want to stay... I don’t dare get my hopes up, so while there’s a chance to get through it all, there is also a chance I won’t.

Yes. What are we going to do?

Someone whistles behind them and they turn, seeing who it is. The woman carries a big bag and a cylindrical tube with paper sticking out of the top. She walks closer, a familiar smile playing on her lips. "Who knew following the sound of a fight would take me to you?"
Gabriel drives ahead to catch up with Sam and Dean before slowing down, rolling the window down. “Hey boys. Need a lift?” Dean squints and bends down to see the driver and his eyes widen when he sees Cas in the backseat, looking embarrassed. Sam stares at Gabriel and glances back at Cas.
When Mick watched the way Ketch handled the Dalí case alongside Naomi two years ago, he felt completely sick to his stomach. While they didn't get to do much, they were still so eager to kill them for doing nothing. They took notes they printed themselves and after the Dalís left, they discovered that they melted gold. Though, who did use gold reserves? They were useless, at least to Mick.
Dean inwardly grimaces — the relationship talk is just weird no matter when he got it. When he brought back his first partner, some girl in elementary school he no longer remembered the name of — Rhonda? Who knows? — Bobby and Ellen were strange about it, at least it was strange to a young boy. Asking if he really had a girlfriend. Dean never liked talking about that. He gives John a forced smile. "Yeah." He regretted doing a Q&A on Twitter when he was tipsy over some good champagne. He faintly remembered answering someone's question of if he was single with a blatant 'hahaha nooo i'm taken losers'.
i might be going as leia!!!
allowed to rot in Hell.
Adam, that’s not --
you're the one who calls him an angel.
“Me?” Cas asks, frowning in disbelief.
Sam lets the last questioned hostage go and asks Jody, "Hey, we have any news on Masters yet?"
Jack nods and splits from him. Sam moves down the hallway.
Whose blood is that?
Richard Roman, nicknamed Dick by, well,
Anael answers, "Charlie and I decided to get up off our asses. Listen, Dorothy has a bike ready for you two down in that alley." She points a little way down the street before she brings Dean into a hug. "This heist was incredible, we watched it on the news. Good luck."
I have an operation at the end of the year to replace a heart valve. I was on a waitlist and they said they'll be ready around October.

A hand claps onto his shoulder and he turns around to see an angel.
Cas takes the phone back and puts it down on the desk as Gabriel says, "This is the most alive you've been the whole time I've known you."
Crowley sighs and says, “Don’t tell him I said this, but Wings is actually a dear friend of mine. While you are too, I have a soft spot for Churchy.”
Also don't do jumpscare ones anymore, please?
Dean shows up at Cas’s door in a plain black button-down shirt and dark blue jeans, with his hair done up by Sam just before he left the house. He’d originally thought that a leather jacket that he saves for special occasions, I.E. dates, over his best flannel shirt would have been alright, and his normal hairstyle, until Sam insisted that Cas deserves better than flannel. This results in Sam going through Dean’s closet to find something moderately classy -- the black button-up -- and five rushed minutes of styling Dean’s hair in the mirror to look good.
and the other kids
“You’re not the only one who pays attention,” Castiel replies simply.
“Despite all that,” Anael says. “I really do respect you, Kansas. It was an honour to be a Dalí with you.”
"I love you, Cas," he says with as much sincerity he can convey. "You're literally so great."
Silence befalls the room before Rowena's shrill 'You must be joking' cuts right through it. Before Dean can say anything, Ash complains, "Dude, I so don't wanna go to jail."
Touché.

“Cassandra!” a British accent rings out in the empty hall where the runway is being set up. Castiel turns to the voice and smiles, waving.
Too late for that, I think.
Dean points out, looking through the second clothes box, “Well, there’s FaceTime and all that crap. We’ll live.” He digs deep and feels around until he catches onto what he’s looking for. He drags it out and holds it up to Sam; it’s a jacket he’d bought purely on impulse. He regretted the expensive purchase as soon as he left the store, but it was Christmas and he was sad, so the remorse didn’t last very long.
After Dean had gotten shot by an intruder, he'd spent the next couple of hours operating on him as best as he can alongside his mother and Jo while Gabriel and Ash guarded them in case the shooter came back for Rowena. Detroit, Castiel, Meg, Eileen and Sam returned with the said shooter, an MI6 agent named Antonia Bevell. After Dean got shot, Crowley had to step up in his position as second-in-command and it wasn't going so well.
Kelly looks at him, amused. “You and Bela are close.”
she hates the holiday but it’s a reason for a party
Dean looks around the studio and almost rolls his eyes when his eyes instantly find Castiel. He sees Gadreel staring at them before he finally walks over to them, a warm smile on his face.

"While you were arguing over a bullet graze," Toni answers, glancing between him and Meg. "A graze, really? A whole argument over a little bit of a burn?"
Michael stares at him -- even though he isn’t biologically related to Cas, Dean can still see some form of resemblance between the adoptive brothers. They both have blue eyes, even if they’re different types. Cas’s are like bottled lightning, Michael’s are like harsh tides. They’re the same kind of steady. They stare at people the same way.
okay. i'll let sam know.
KMDSKVND????
Dean asks, “Can I come in, or is that too stalker-like?”
"Yes, boss," Charlie laughs, taking advantage of his tipsiness to hug him before she, Meg, Kevin, and Gabriel leave Castiel's hotel room, leaving just him and Dean.
"Wake up!"
Angeles sits in that for moments and says, maybe in a gesture of sympathy, "I have a brother too. Older."

Death by gun
I will come over soon.
"Dean," Mick affirms. "If you have anything to tell him, I can try to get the message to him."
"Yes," Naomi hisses. "The article is destroyed, alright? Irretrievable even in code. It's gone. Do you just go around asking magazine CEOs to take down pieces about Castiel? Do you have nothing better to do?"
“That’s fine. You know I’m working if you are so it’s all good with me,” Dean says with understanding. “As long as I get to spend time with you.”
"I'm sorry, Sam," Dean says, sounding defeated and tired.
SORRY I CANT HELP IT

I want to see them again.
"Welcome back to NYC, Castiel!" someone shouts in good nature. Another asks loudly in Dean's ear, making him wince, "What happened to Cassie Robinson?"
Dean asks quietly, "How much of that was actually his words?"
The door opens -- EILEEN, standing there with a smile on her face.

“Hey, you’ll probably be her stylist or something, not her best friend,” Sam laughs, shaking his head. “But if you do get her phone number, you better leak it to me,”

Dean gets out of the car and Castiel teleports out, meeting him halfway.
Why was he so happy with that

Cas is still steely, and he only gets more so when Pax is there. While Dean understands that Cas is riled up because Pax makes Dean distracted (and not even in a good way) and he wants his errands done right, Dean still doesn’t get it because Cas is getting too bothered around Pax for it to just be about work. He can’t, for the life of him, figure out why. Sam claims he doesn’t know despite how much he talks to Cas in his downtime. Dean knows Cas only gets this tense when he's stressed but the next awards season isn't for a few more months and other than the summer runway next month, there isn't much for Cas to get riled up about. Maybe Pax is just a way for Cas to fixate his frustration over something else.
“I’m not sure. I think it’ll be at least another three days,” Anael estimates. Hannah goes through the mail, cutting open another envelope to read the contents. Anael thought the whole process of filtering the mail is invasive, regardless if the recipients were criminals or not. Everyone deserved some level of privacy. However, as long as she’s here, she’s going to have to drag the black marker ink across anything questionable.
Castiel’s crush on Dean gets worse by the day. It doesn’t help that it has been a long while since he has last been in a proper relationship with someone that lasted longer than a cab ride to their apartment. His first boyfriend from high school thought Castiel was too indulgent in things like smoking and drinking which, to be fair, maybe he shouldn’t have been deep-diving in those frankly problematic areas at 17, but Castiel has always been a stressed-out person.
LITERALLY WHEEZING
and I are.
"I'm not leaving that bank without at least two," Bela says decisively. Kansas grins, wide and easy, draping his arm over the back of Angeles's chair. His thumb strokes Angeles's right shoulder where his hand rests and neither man says a word about it.
Sure, has Anael lost most of her liking for Dean? Yes. But she did still like everyone else that’s there and she didn’t feel like leaving them behind again.
"What is it?"
“Yeah, well, after the military, I figured I should get an easy work kind of job. Sit around, yell at people to listen to you, beat people when they don’t,” Lilith says casually, stepping back to leave ample space between herself and Michael. “And I thought: Hey, a correctional officer. Seemed to be a good call.” Michael nods once, dreading having to talk to her, and she says, “It’s good to see you again, brother. What have you been up to?”
"Sorry to break it to you, man. Country's crap," Dean shrugs against Sam's protests. He snaps his fingers to shut him up and continues, "Third! If you so much as eat a salad with my mouth, I will make you eat the unhealthiest burger you have ever seen."

"Yeah," Cas admits, and he looks so fucking adorable like that, and Dean kisses him.

"Fair enough," Adam agrees. "So Crowley's gonna be the only one going on?"
The truck pulls up and the backdoors open to reveal Meg and Mick. Mick gestures for them to get in, saying, "Come on, we don't have a lot of time. Someone fucked up—"

“Thanks,” Dean says again, sincerely. “It’s okay.”

He leaves for the cells, walking past and checking if inmates are where they are. If some of them are missing, he doesn’t bother reporting it. Again, not his business. He’s not planning on getting shanked by a provoked inmate.
," Kansas says.
Crowley orders, giving Michael anaesthetic, "Find Bevell, we don't need to worry about a shooter on the inside on top of snipers. Eileen, move Dean to another room, we need to work." Eileen gets moving, taking Dean's gurney and pushing it out into a different office as Cas, Jo and Meg set off to find the runaway MI6 agent.
Unsurprisingly enough, Naomi refuses to say if it was Crowley who gave up a few names. Originally, she only knew Crowley, Meg, Sam and Adam and she’ll recognise Dean, Mick and Jo. Now, she also knows Anael.
, thanks to Castiel, and he knows he has to get some to let Sam try when he comes to visit.
"Salem, go get London and Dallas. Paris, you get Berlin and Rome," Dean orders. The two women immediately run off to get the other robbers and Dean picks up the phone, "Come on, Windom." He gets no response and Dean tries again, only to get the same result.
i miss seeing cas in the gc :(
Why not?
Help me? I'm stuck at 7
"To be or not to be," Dean beams.
No noted clothes
"Gabriel got this for me as a joke!" Cas defends. After a pause, he admits quietly, "And it's comfortable."
Amelia finally accepts the money and Cas smiles as best as he can -- Dean doesn't really know why he rarely smiles. He looks good. Like an angel, almost. Maybe that's how he gets away with so many robberies. If Dean was getting robbed by someone like Cas, he'd probably give him everything.
“I’m not gonna be in prison forever,” Dean says, amused. “You do remember we’re rich, right?”
Sam internally groans at how comfortable Kansas has gotten but he had to admit that he had a point -- nobody had gotten fatally injured yet. Other than his robber who got shot (who was fine according to Kansas), and the two officers who got shot as well who were also fine. There's still no casualties and Kansas's point stood in that aspect. He mutters into the phone, "You're facing sixteen years. We can make you a deal. If you surrender, we can knock it down. If you give up the names of every robber in there, we could cut the sentence in half for cooperation, and you'll get out even earlier on good behaviour. How does that sound?"
Dean scoffs, “You have a washing machine at your place. Clean it yourself. Anyway...” He takes out a Vivienne Westwood Hypnos jacket. Blended wool with mint green and black tartan. There’s voluminous pockets on the front and its tasteful asymmetry. Tailored for an oversized look. “Think I’ll wear this shirt to work.”
Dean decided that Jo could give him some good advice on it — she was often willing to do things without asking for any context, for the sake of allowing privacy and Dean wonders why he hadn’t thought of consulting her in the first place. He tells her, Cas’s identity redacted, about what happened. She says the same thing as Charlie; fix him up a good dinner and ask him out, but after hearing that that fell through, she tells him to just tell him the next time they meet. “It will never be the right time, you will never be ready. So why not just go for it?”
He picks up and Sam looks at him, curious.

Mick looks up, startled by the sudden attention, and glances nervously at Ketch who turns to him as well. "What calls, Agent?"

of air." Dean can feel the colour drain from his face the moment she says that. Dean may not be the most proficient in methods to kill but when you're dating someone like Cas and friends with people like Meg and Crowley, you learn a thing or two. "Do you know what happens when I put this air into your arteries? When that air goes into your bloodstream?"
His eyes are like sunflowers if the skies were green.
When he wakes up in the morning, he opens his eyes blearily to adjust to the sight of Cas sleeping next to him. No matter how many times Cas has slept with Dean, the way he looks so innocent, free, and beautiful in his sleep just takes Dean's breath away every time. Dean can't help but smile, pressing a kiss to the tip of his nose and he shifts, about to get cleaned up. He's still blurry with sleep and he ends up falling off the side of the bed. He quickly looks over to see if he's woken Cas up.

Castiel’s gaze snaps to him, eyes widened slightly, “There’s an alternate ending?”
Dean remains notably free for the rest of the day, actually, after he does the few errands Cas has bestowed upon him. He even has time to go to the nearby McDonald’s with Kevin, Rowena, and Gabriel. They sit at the same table he and Cas sat at the last time they were there and Dean tries not to think about it.

Maybe they arrest one of us and keep us without a warrant. A hundred things can happen and I can't plan for all of it." Everyone listens intently as Dean explained himself. "So in light of unpredictability, I don't have a plan."
Dean presses the ‘open’ button and a redhead runs in. Dean eyes her outfit. It’s entirely Chanel; a black wool crepe coat, cotton navy and white blouse, black crepe de chine and black satin and strass sandals. She looks good, it makes her red hair stand out. He recognizes her, though.

Gabriel, ever the conversationalist, answers, “Me, I’ve been in for five years. De Luca’s never been, I think.”
I don't like him so I told him that.
see ya angel
Sam stares long and hard at Dean and the mask, the painter's face bearing so much more meaning, a different meaning than before. What used to be a symbol of taunting and overconfidence is now a revolution for the people who never got what they deserved.
took him.
I love my friends so much.
“Kind of,” Dean mumbles, drumming his fingers on his desk anxiously. If Rowena is as in-demand as she seems to be that Castiel wanted her instantly, then every second he spends on the phone with Crowley is another second someone else could be picking her up, and another second closer to Dean possibly getting fired on his first day from a fashion house titan.
I'm on my way. I'll be there in five minutes.
Dean wonders what Castiel is like during Fashion Week (Fashion
Meg jeers, grinning, "You heard him, get the fuck outta here." Hester searches for words to say, nothing coming to mind, and she just silently leaves the office. Meg nods, satisfied, and says, "What a day."

guy only, that’s all I agreed to.”
but as a viewing experience,
It's a brand new day and Dean is feeling a lot better about being caught off-guard by Sam's presence. At the very least, he should have more information from Adam in about an hour, so that's a huge weight off of his chest. The hostages are awake and standing, awaiting Dean's instructions. Paris stands among them, between two other women. Dallas is in the third vault, starting work on the escape route. It's one that Dean spent years planning -- eighty-five feet away from sewage so the police's seismographs won't detect it. He had the hole dug five years prior, leaving six inches of steel, thirty-two inches of reinforced concrete and twenty-two feet of dirt between their place in the bank and Adam's hideout. It would have been ten to twelve days of work, but he has an experienced miner down there. Hopefully, he'll make quick work of the tunnel.
Kelly smiles, patting his hand once. “It’s supposed to just help you along. It takes time, Castiel.” She repeats his name often, he notices, but he’s read about it before. A psychological trick; repeat a name throughout the conversation to keep attention. Sam has the same habit, though Castiel doubts that it’s for the same reason as Kelly. “You admitted that you were hiding something and you came so close to saying it! Castiel, that’s progress. More progress than I anticipated. I’m sure it’s more than you expected from yourself too.”
Adam bends forward to be a little closer to Ketch as if he's about to spill everything but he just gives him a shit-eating smile. "No."
Lilith turns around with a twisted smile. All Dean notices is the blood on Adam’s arm. “De Luca! Aren’t I doing you a favour?”
“I get it. Missouri and Gabe told me how you get around this time,” Dean says. He pauses, then figures that nothing can go wrong and asks, “I don’t think either of us is gonna get to sleep anytime soon after today, so do you maybe want to get coffee?”
and this is how you repay him?
Cas stirs and he smiles, running an unconscious hand through his messy hair. "Good morning."
Castiel shakes his head but he humours him anyway, "I don't know, Winchester. I think I'd like to be an FBI agent. You?"
“Can I ask who?” Dean asks.
Gadreel whispers to Dean, “Dude, what the hell was that? Do you have a death wish?”
demon clique
not at all
“Get in line,” Dean chuckles, pulling out an

little? He was happy with
"Well, could I meet them?" John says. Maybe this is his way of bridging the gap between them. Dean will humour him, but he's unsure of how effective his efforts are.
Thank you.
Dorothy’s grin is charmed when she glances at Charlie, who quickly hides behind the catalogue. “Is that so?”
He was my friend too, you
Since they were injured, Dean assigned Sam and Cas to watch the hostages while Dean tried to get the phone line up again. Dallas went to work on the tunnel and Gabriel and Dorothy assisted him after dealing with Abaddon.
"Sam, holy shit!" Dean laughs, ecstatic, and Cas grins so wide as he gives his congratulations. Dean kind of cries a little bit because his little brother's all grown up now and Sam just told him that he's obviously going to be his best man.
so will you switch or...
Berlin and Vegas come to the office as soon as Dean sends Angeles to get them and he'd moved the hostages there to an adjoining room. The moment they walk in, Dean asks, "Did any of the hostages use a phone?"
Cas walks over and gently pulls Dean into an embrace. “I’m sure they can let one hug go. Hello, Dean.”
It was.
After dinner, they washed the dishes together and it just never felt like a chore whenever he did it with Dean. A lot of things didn't felt like a chore whenever Dean was around, actually.
Someone has to reap the Shadow.
There, in the privacy of the bathroom stall, he taped the tools to the lid of the toilet, careful to be silent so Rome wouldn't hear him. Earlier, he'd plotted with Gordon Walker for his grand escape plan, his attempt to be a saviour. Gordon will tape the tools to his body and bring them to some other hostages and they will use them as protection on their way out.
see ya kid
Ruby splutters over the phone, “What, but... What will we run then?”
Ketch hits him again and he looks out the partition to see Mick flinch away.
Nathaniel leads them to the guard on duty and picks up the clipboard, reading off of it, “Sunders back to his cell at D block, De Luca and Novak to C block. Alright, Ben, you take Ishim. I’ll handle the newbies.”
I'm going to call you and run over the syllabus again.
Locker 275:
Thanks.
Somehow this doesn’t surprise me.
Dean's voice crackles through the earpiece, saying, "Salem's turning the alarms back on in one minute. You got me?"
Dean holds a hand over the receiver, barely able to hold back the grin on his face as he calls out, “I have Rowena!” He redirects the call to Castiel’s office and watches as he picks up the phone, speaking. He looks up and connects eyes with Dean, and a hint of a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth before he turns to look out the office window.
This is so embarrassing.
"Not really," Cas replies before he pauses and answers again. "Well, I do you too."

,” Sam cuts over pointedly. “Seems like your replacement for Cas.”
Where is it?
"Your first runway! I'm so proud of you," Jo says excitedly, pulling away from him.
Adam connects the dots as Chuck stands. When Adam realises who this man is, he is UNDERWHELMED. This is the all-powerful God Michael idolised?
Cas emerges from the room in hotel slippers, the envelope mid-layer and a pair of sweatpants the hotel provided. He's wearing
Balthazar scoffs, pressing a hand to his chest like he's offended, "So I was just second choice? How rude."
wtf i raised him better than this
Michael walks closer to it and recognises it.
“What makes you think that?”
Sam pauses and looks over to the tech experts who begin trying to clean up the voice. He says, buying time, "Your voice sounds strange. Are you okay?"
Rowena gets them a container to store it in, cotton placed in it so it wouldn't make any suspicious noise, and Eileen puts the bug in it. Dean nods towards the door and Eileen leaves with the bug so they can continue discussing without the bug around.
Cas's arms go over Dean's shoulders to take the sketchbook from him. He flips through and looks over the new concepts, saying, "I said it before, but it's hard designing suits for men. I think you're better off going for a basic suit with good colours and match Eileen's dress with his colour scheme. You have a lot of impressive dress designs so all you can really do now is match her with him to make his suit look a little less basic."
Does that make sense?
Dean chuckles fakely. “I thought I was clear.”
Alfie says lightly, “He’s not the worst guy here if you’re worried. I mean, people have been in for worse than that.”
Dean was 4 years old when Mary Winchester died. He was 5 when John started drinking. He was 6 and a half when John hit him and apologized the next morning. He was two days away from turning 7 when John ran away. He was 7 when he and Sam’s things got moved into the Harvelle-Singer residence. He was 8 when he cried at his birthday party.
All the guns are silent, no triggers pulled, but Kansas feels like all the bullets are emptied out on him.
stealing his date LMAOOO
“Holy shit, you’re pathetic,” Dean mutters to himself, hiding his face behind his planner notebook.
Neither Adam nor Gabriel will have a good reaction to it. Crowley will be stuck in the same room as Naomi for a while which makes him a terrible choice. It leaves Anael as the only one who can help him so he looks right at the camera, knowing Anael is watching and nods once to his cell. Gabriel’s gone, probably talking to Cas.
You catching up on some light
"We're not gonna force you. If you wanna skip out then go ahead. We can find someone else," Dean assures. He can tell she didn't want to go again, not after what they lost the first time. Even Cas didn't want to go. Even himself.
“I hope you didn’t have too much fun last night, boys,” Crowley teases once Dean and Cas come out of their room into the hallway. Belphegor gives them a shit-eating grin and Dean automatically has two thoughts: 1, thank God he and Cas’s roommates switched rooms and 2, in a different context, maybe Dean would have gotten along with him.
“Dean wanted to save his favours with Roman in case anything goes wrong so we all agreed that I would just avoid her,” Michael answers and Adam rolls his eyes. In Dean’s defence, Michael says, “He was just making sure we have contingency plans.”
he's up for it
I wish it was different too.
"He is, he is. He's here," an employee cowers, hands shaking as he tucks them behind his head.
”No, I don’t think it’s gonna be years,” Dean says.
He wants to talk to him, tell him all of this without faltering, pray the kiss meant as much to Cas as it did to him, but when he sees him, the words slip through his fingers and he is left speechless until his wit kicks in for some stupidly flirty comment about whatever brand he’s wearing that day.
That’s cute, you bringing the rose for her.
Who’s Jack?

I guess he just loved you that much.

Easy. We gank the bastard. We
“Thank you, dear,” Rowena says.
Sam regrettably takes Kansas off hold and says, "We'll have Jack Kline."
Dean looks at the vacant apartment, boxes piled up on the side. He moved in with a new job and no friends and now he was moving out with a boyfriend, a newfound brother, new friends and his own label. It’s funny how things come full circle sometimes.
"The heist," Dean replies, fiddling with the hem of his shirt now that his hands are free from the distraction of a cigarette. "What I'll do after." A moment passes and then two, and Dean finds himself asking, "What are you gonna do with your share?"
"Do you want me to come with you? I know you don't like meeting your father," Cas offers. Dean wishes Cas was always this nice but he also gets that Cas has some repressed anger and he knows that shit doesn't go away easily. It's hard enough for Dean himself sometimes. Plus, when Cas takes charge and fires off orders, it's kind of hot.
"Because it's
Charlie frowns dramatically, “But the runway is such a good opportunity. There are tons of Oscar shows, can’t she cancel?”
noted.
he's earned my approval
"I love you too," Michael quickly says before the line gets cut off.
Gabriel looks uncharacteristically serious for once when he says, "I know, this isn't a big bro talk. This is a..." He trails off, waving the lollipop in his hands as he finds the words. "Cas is... a fragile kid. Do your best, okay?"
What makes you think he doesn’t?
Sam and Dean walk into the bunker, the lights still on and everything exactly as when they left. They walk through until they get to the library and stop.
"Then why not get Gabe to live with you?" Dean asks, walking over to the window to look out at the city underneath. It's a beautiful sight, the city this late at night. Red and white lines skating the dark road as people go across the city, lights flickering on and off in the countless buildings.
are you in math with him right now?
what do you want my queen
"Dead on impact," Crowley says, standing and turning away to look for something to cover her body with, and Meg takes his place by Bela's side, devastated. They were pretty close the entire time they knew each other, clicking like the safety of a gun.

big Milligan coincidence.”
"Hey, Sam," Adam greets and Sam smiles tightly, stepping aside to let him in. Adam looks around the mostly empty apartment and his face begins to fall, realising something is deeply wrong, "Did you just move in or what?"
Dean and Cas busy themselves with a conversation about Sam and Eileen until the lights dim and Dick Roman walks out to give a speech about the collection. He talks about how hard he and his people worked on the collection and that 'many things' inspire him. Despite the vague explanation of the 'many things', he somehow manages to bullshit a solid speech. Dean thinks Dick must really like the sound of his voice. Cas is still and silent beside him but Dean knows he's annoyed and just wants him to hurry up and start the show.
Castiel Novak, Gabriel Novak, Anael Jo, Inias Garrison, Balthazar Freely, Anna Milton, Zachariah Adler, Metatron Scribe, Michael Shurley
Michael echoes Chuck’s earlier statement, mocking:
The doors suddenly swing open and Dean and Cas automatically move away from each other, heads turning to see who it is — Michael’s clothes and hands are stained a horrifying red, a shiv sticking out of his abdomen, and he whispers, “Help.”
"I'm here, I'm—
Electrical doesn’t have many inmates there — Dean assumes that it’s because it’s one of the lower-paying jobs in the prison compared to other ones like the kitchen. It’s about half the wage but Dean doesn’t mind, it’s not like he’s going to be there forever. Michael and Anael can get him anything, he doesn’t need the commissary money.
YOU THINK I DON’T KNOW THAT???
Dean nods, looking around to make sure nobody is peering through into the office before taking Cas's hand across the table. "You deserve a win."
Kansas is truly a force to be reckoned with, for sure. Constantly achieving the impossible. He'd robbed America and London blind and they let him get away with it.
“I wasn’t gonna say that,” Anael mutters, rolling her eyes. “Alright, Winchester. Back to what you were doing. Stay out of trouble.”
," Kansas informs. Whether he's being sarcastic about taking comfort in Amelia being a vet, Sam can't tell through all the layers of voice modification. But it does set his heart slightly at ease that there's someone there who he knows can help if the surgeons aren't allowed in when something happens to Chuck. A medical professional, albeit specialising in animals, a medical professional nonetheless. He still felt awful about wrongfully getting him shot.
with october coming up... idk i just don't want to regret not being able to spend more time with you
Defeated, Michael huffs. “Fine. Are you going to tell Castiel that you died in the ambulance too?”
Dean explains, pacing, causing Cas’s hand to fall off his shoulder back to his side, “I was talking with John earlier and he didn’t approve of us because you’re a guy.”
“Nah, you have the right to your own secrets, brother or not,” Dean says, waving a hand dismissively as he takes the seat next to Michael. “How’d you know him?”
Roman nods, looking mildly annoyed. "I'm tempted to ask you what tricks you have up your sleeve but you won't tell me, will you?"
Punching
They were now just clearing out shelves and were almost done with it. As Dean moves the CDs into the same box, Cas gets started on his closet, the last thing they had left on their list of things Dean needed to pack up.
You’re God.
Dean looks down at his beer bottle, opened but not touched yet, thinking about all the possibilities now that he knows Michael is firmly on their side.
Castiel walks in, texting somebody. He puts one of the two Yves Saint Laurent bags on Dean's desk and says, not looking up, "Gift from Vaccarello." He finally brings his gaze upward and looks at Dean, holding out his phone. "Yes?"
Dean shakes his head. “Jesus, Cas. In

So does that mean you’re
Adam slams his elbow into Lilith’s side but she grips him harder. The scalpel in her hand slides across Adam’s arm and Dean rushes over, raising the crowbar just as Lilith turns around to face him.
i like that
He got a cheap room at a motel under a name he'd seen at a cemetery he passed on the way there. He did odd jobs until he pooled enough money to rent a room in the apartment of a woman with three too many cats for Dean's preference. She passed away in her sleep when he turned 20 and he took the apartment for himself.
He didn't want to believe it but it made complete sense with everything Jody pointed out to him. He did randomly show up the same day the Dali robbers did when he had so many other times to appear and everything else.
“Missouri.”
“Go fuck yourself, Benjamin,” Ishim mutters, and the two guards laugh. The other one, Nathaniel, speaks into his radio, telling them to open gate 1-1.
THE SHADOW
It's Tuesday night, and I have History with Cas tomorrow. I know he's awake right now -- Cas has a hard time falling asleep (not insomnia or stress, Cas just doesn't tend to sleep early), and he likes to do puzzles or read until he's tired. Ever since we started dating, he's taken to texting me instead. Right now, he's texting me about last week's Sunday choir. They sang this song and Gabe cried, which was very funny to Cas (and me).
“I told him not to —"
?” He huffs a bitter laugh and Meg’s eyes follow his, wide and angry. He leans in a little bit and asks, “Was it the whole year?"
"How long has it been since you last slept?" Jess asks in concern, bringing Sam's face down so she can hug him to her chest in an attempt to relax him.
EXORCISM?
"He got one stitch in before he gave up," Angeles answers. Dean nods slowly.
"I know, I know," Dean replies, stepping away from the pillar. "I'm just... Angeles is down there."
“Not when it comes to you!” Dean cuts in. “
Dean at least gets to befriend a few celebrities there, and at least two ask him what’s with the weird energy between him and Cas, to which he lies and says Cas just forgot his morning coffee. It’s an easier answer than saying “I don’t know”. About three actors give him his number, one of them with the intention of having some fun in the bedroom, and accepting her number must be some red flag when he’s dating Pax, right? But she’s an actress, which means she attends award shows and premiere parties, which means she’s a potential client. Dean rationalizes a defence for himself and Pax is not even there.
"This is unbelievable," Kevin shakes his head, chuckling. Dean can't stop grinning — he likes seeing this side of Castiel, the side that tells stupid stories and lets himself ease up.
