Cas leans forward and brushes his hand across my jaw, caressing it ever so lightly. I want to lean in. The physical intimacy he offers is so enticing.
Cas laughs awkwardly, probably not sure how he should react to the fact that I just drank poisoned coffee and am now joking about it. After a moment, he says, "I guess I'm looking forward to mornings, too. With you." He turns away from me, a slight blush visible on the tips of his ears and his cheeks.
I shift in my seat and glance around, making sure nobody was close enough to hear him say that. Then, I kick him under the table.
I walk to the front of the store and find Cas waiting there for me, his stuff already bagged. The man at the counter rings up my food haul, a kind of dazed look on his face the entire time he's scanning, and sends us on our way.
"No one human. I took care of a small squirrel I found one day while I was out." Castiel continued working. "She had fallen from a tree, and I took her home and nursed her back to health. When I attempted to release her, she only returned to me. I named her Hannah. She passed a few years later of some sickness I was unable to cure."
It's a woman, his boss I'm guessing, and she has a stern look on her face. She has long, blonde hair, and is dressed plainly in blue jeans and a white blouse.
As he is brushing his teeth, Dean realizes what he hadn’t noticed before: he had seen the frames of this wild dreamland before. It’s the same every bathroom mirror in the bunker is cased in. Looking at his own reflection it’s hard no to imagine Cas next to him.
Dean hands them to Cas. Instead of letting go of Deans hand he just places the photos on his own lap to skim through them.
Castiel giggles. He doesn’t know if Dean means to be funny or just hasn’t thought about his words, but he likes it nevertheless.
“I know you need time and I want you to know that it’s okay. Everything of it is okay.” Cas voice is soft and warm and comforting. Yet Dean isn’t happy about the implication that the situation they are in is all due to Dean.
their talking, not like sound hitting his ears. But he kind of feels what’s going on there: the laughter, his own words (
“Hello Dean.” Castiel’s smile isn’t as bright as it was the last times. There was neither an e-mail nor a call from Dean and he gets that unspoken message. He decides to switch to a professional worker-customer-relationship before he’s making an even bigger idiot out of himself. “Cheeseburger with extra bacon and fries, right?”
He smiles, shrugging. “I was…finishing my backup plan.” I raise an eyebrow at him, and he chuckles. “It’s a surprise for you. I’ve been working on it for a while, actually, but I thought I should finish it before I talked to you, in case you required a little more coercion.”
Cas’ eyes were closed, tear tracks still shining on his face, and Dean hesitated only a moment before reaching out, cupping the angel’s cheek as he shook him lightly. “Cas? Come on, man, you gotta wake up...I need you...please...Cas!”
“It’s a surprise,” I answer, digging in the bottom of the closet for a moment. When I set the small wooden box down next to him he glances over curiously. “No peeking,” I reprimand softly. “It won’t be a surprise if you see it. Get comfortable, this might take a while.”
I laugh, nodding. “Yeah, I know. It’s kinda crazy. I never thought I’d be comfortable with that kind of thing. But…I want people to know I’m yours too. And that’s kinda the best way humans know how.” I pause, raising an eyebrow at him. “You still haven’t given me an answer.”
“You took care of him too,” Benny points out. “You did really well. I’m proud of you, kid. I know it ain’t easy to face your fears. You want me to stick around until he wakes up, or you think you got it from here?”
“I’ll be sure to let you know,” she assures him. “Take it easy, alright? You’re still going to be sore for a while, so it’ll help if you don’t push yourself.” She gathers her supplies, nodding to Cas and casting one more worried look at Dean before disappearing.
Smirking, Cas gently ran a finger around Dean’s pink, puffy rim, laughing at Dean’s sharp gasp as his hips ground down into the bed involuntarily, putting too much friction on his over-sensitive cock. “I think you’ll live. Have I mentioned that you’re beautiful?”
He shrugs. “Well, there were an awful lot of them, Dean. Even if we could figure out how to get them all down here, how would we contain them? Holy fire is one thing, but it also means we can’t get near them. And besides, even if we could, what are you planning on doing with them?”
“Yes. Of course, at the time, he understood that you wouldn’t allow yourself to do that. But he always wanted it for you. I think he’ll be happy for you. And you aren’t abandoning him. You’ll still be his big brother, even if you aren’t by his side every minute of every day. It’ll be alright, and if retiring is what you want, of course I support you.”
I feel his grin against my skin. “The same place I learned to do lots of other things.” He nips at my left ass cheek before his tongue drags slowly up my spine, making me shudder. A gasp escapes me before I can help it, and he laughs. “I’m very multi-talented, it seems.”
Castiel raised an eyebrow at him, processing this. “I’m...still not entirely sure what you’re saying...Are you...are you saying you have...feelings, about me, that aren’t purely platonic?”
Cas chuckles. “I told you, Dean. I want to give you what you need. All you ever have to do is ask. So take a minute, take some deep breaths, and then we’ll put you to good use.”
Dean sighs, but nods, continuing to let water run down his back, and after a little while Cas relaxes, the stinging sensation gone. “Better?”
Dean nods. “It did. For as long as I could remember, I was always the protector. I had to be, for Sammy. No one had ever stood up for me before. They may be kind of weird, but they’re my family.”
“Don’t worry, baby,” Cas laughs, kissing him softly. “We’re just waiting to make your big introduction, remember?”
I hesitate, and Sam cuts in. “Well, Dean was telling me that you said your memories of what happen didn’t quite make sense, and that you were having dreams about them that were…stressing you out. So we thought maybe if you tried to talk about them, we could help you figure out the parts that don’t make sense, and maybe then you wouldn’t have those dreams all the time. We’d just like to help.”
“But love isn’t,” I point out. Cas freezes, staring up at me with wide eyes while I realize what I said. Well, so much for not telling him. His wings flutter uncertainly, pulling closer to his body, and his mouth opens and closes several times, but nothing comes out.
“Well in that case, we’ll give you some time to rest,” the witch smiled, hugging him lightly. “And if you need anything you know where to find me.” She turned to hug Dean, shifting up on her toes to whisper in his ear. “You’ve got your second chance. Don’t waste it.”
Cas shakes his head. “No, it wasn’t your fault. I just need to work on it a little. I’m okay.” He pauses, thinking. “Did you really…mean what you said before? You…love me?”
Cas nodded, biting his lip. “I am, actually. We’ve already been thinking about it. We...thought you might have come from a situation like that.”
“That’s alright. You don’t have to tell me unless you want to. Did you sleep at least?” I ask. He nods. “Good. I’m gonna go take a quick shower, alright? I’ll be right back.” When I finish washing up, I take an extra minute to let the hot water relax my muscles before my worry about Cas starts eating at me. I quickly throw on sweatpants, and when I return the sketch pad is at the opposite side of the bed, and Cas is staring at the wall, breathing harshly. “Everything alright?” I ask cautiously. His head snaps up, and he shakes it once. “Well…what’s wrong?” I notice his white knuckled grip on the blanket, frowning. “Your memories trying to suck you back in?” I guess.
I can’t help but cringe, remembering how we ended up here. It’s true, though. That was the first time I willingly sought contact. “It wasn’t so much that I didn’t like it,” I admit. “It was just uncomfortable before. It was too unfamiliar. The night I came here was the first time I really wanted it. I still don’t like it from most people. But from you, and Sam…it’s not so bad anymore.”
Dean sent the picture, laughing at the wall of emojis he got in response. “I think it’s safe to say she approves.” Cas grinned, kissing his cheek again before walking off to the bathroom to finish getting ready. When he returned he slipped into bed, turning the lights off. “Did you have a good birthday?” he asked, cuddling up to Dean as the hunter settled down.
“Indeed it does,” Cas sighs. “I don’t see why he needs me to come. Everyone has been extraordinarily happy to forget that I’d ever existed.”
Woot! Sorry for the delay on this one, I fell a little behind in my editing due to some exciting new stuff I have going on, but I promise I will not abandon this story! As always, if you enjoyed, please feel free to leave me a review, they make me so happy! You can also come chat with me over on Tumblr, @thesongsmithtumbles.
“He’s coming,” Dean murmurs, though he’s not sure who he’s repeating it for. “We’re going to fix this, I promise. Just hang in there for me, okay?”
Dean laughs breathlessly, leaning in to press their lips together softly. “Oh God, I love you so much,” he murmurs, his free hand finding Cas’ own erection and running his thumb over the head, chuckling at his gasp. “But we should probably postpone the make-up sex until you’re feeling better.”
Eileen nodded, shrugging slightly. “I told you you wouldn’t like it...but it’s possible. Even if it could work, we’d still need a way to get there. And get back.”
I nod. “Slowly, yes. I’m being very gentle to allow them to assimilate the sensation a little at a time without overwhelming you with it. I don’t want to hurt you.”
Dean frowns at the hint of panic creeping into his voice, and he nods, squeezing his hand gently. “Okay, okay. I won’t make you go. But I…I think we should call Benny. I know you have issues with him, but he has a lot more experience handling stuff like this than I do. I don’t want to do something wrong and hurt you. I’ll be right here with you, I promise. Can I call him?”
I think for a minute, then take him by the shoulders, gently pushing him back. He watches me cautiously, tensing as I slowly part his knees to expose the scars. I feel him lean back as I move forward, holding his breath. I glance up at him as I slowly lean down to kiss the marks gently. He lets out his breath, his eyes closing as I move to repeat it on the other side before stroking his cheek lightly. “I’m sorry, Cas. I know it wasn’t really me, but I’m still sorry that someone hurt you. And I know nothing I do could ever make up for that, but I’m going to do everything I can to make this right.”
“I’m aware,” Dean answers, spearing a bit of pancake and holding it out for him. “That doesn’t mean I don’t like doing it anyway. Unless you have any complaints.” Cas shakes his head, smiling as he settles against Dean’s side. Dean sighs happily, holding him close. After a while, Cas glances up at him. “You doing okay?”
Gabe chuckles. “Yeah, well, you’re a tough nut to crack Dean. I think you finally let that last bit of resistance go, and Cas’ instincts responded. Did he tell you what it means for an angel to allow someone else to touch their wings?”
He shakes his head, pulling away. “I…nothing. I just…I didn’t realize…It’s nothing.” He pants slightly, flushed.
He nods slowly, and I feel him relax a little. “It’s okay, Cas. I’m not afraid of you. I know you wouldn’t.”
He chuckles. “I guess that’s true.” He parks a few blocks away from the nest. “Come on. We’ve got some bloodsuckers to behead.” We sneak through the nest, taking out vamps as we go, and Dean has this crazy sort of zeal that I haven’t seen in him since he was a teenager. When we finally make our way to the main room, we find it surprisingly empty. “This feel like a trap to you?” Dean mutters. I nod, and suddenly the room is swarming with vampires. We manage to hold them off for a while, but soon there’s just too many of them, and I lose sight of Dean when one of them slams me into a support beam, pain spreading through my back, head, and wrist where I collided with the metal. When my vision comes back into focus, I see Dean struggling in the hold of another vamp while the one who flung me across the room holds my wrists pinned behind me. Normally I’d be able to twist out of his hold, but the pain in my wrist and shoulder becomes unbearable with even the slightest pull. I can’t do anything but watch as the vamp leans closer to Dean.
He laughs, shaking his head. “I’m not saying anything else. But I mean it about that invitation. I could give your precious little Cassie a lesson or two.”
Cas hesitated, glancing over at Dean as he slept on the couch. “He’s...interesting...definitely a lot clearer than last night, but still not talking. He’s writing more, though, and we had a...kind of interesting conversation...I’m starting to think your theory is pretty likely...”
Now this is a game I can play. “I want your cock, Sir,” I manage almost evenly, whining and squirming as he continues his task. “I want to feel it inside me, filling me up. Want you to take me, fuck me hard like the good little slut I am.” A choked sound escapes him, the tips of his ears going pink as he starts rapidly losing the battle for control. It’s turning me on at least as much as it’s turning him on, and I start talking faster. “Please Sir, take me…claim me…need your cock…Please…” The last half comes out as more of a whimper, but it works, and Cas grabs for the bottle of lube again as the last bead pops free. He prepares himself quickly, and I gasp as two of his fingers enter me roughly, spreading apart for a moment before they withdraw. “
All day, Cas remains entrenched in his books, sitting still and silent in a chair while Sam and I watch TV, as if he didn’t just come for the first time in his life. Actually, it seems too harsh to think of it that way. It hadn’t just been about coming. It was probably the first intimate moment Cas had ever had, and certainly a new one for me, and there he was, cool as a cucumber reading his books while I sweated like a pig, everything suddenly too warm as I run the memory over in my head, trying not to let Sam know anything is up. Occasionally, Cas would glance up, staring at me and cocking his head to the side in thought before returning to the book. I mentally curse myself for being such a girl about this. Why should I be expecting him to want to talk about it? Why do I want to talk about it? Maybe casual sex is all angels do. Hell, it’s one of my favorite pastimes. But then, why does it hurt so much to think about it that way? It doesn’t make any sense, and the longer I sit here the worse it gets. Get it together, Dean! I order myself silently. It doesn’t work, so instead I plan a quick getaway. “Gonna take a walk…be back,” I mumble, jumping up and out the door before either of them can respond. The fresh air is a nice reprieve from the stares and silence, and my head starts to clear as I walk slowly down the road away from the bunker. There’s a sudden rustle behind me, and I’m already drawing my blade when I turn around to find the one person who could possibly make this worse.
Dean smiles, gently tipping his chin up to kiss him softly. “Thank you. I appreciate that. I won’t let you down.” Cas smiles, snuggling up against his chest. His hand drifts slowly down Dean’s stomach and along his thigh, making him shiver. “Cas…?”
Dean nods. “Yeah, sorry about that. I’m good. You’ve been helping out for a while now, why don’t you go take a break? I think Cas can fill in for a bit.”
Once Dean is warmed up and in place, wrists cuffed and pulled over his head, Cas takes a step back, taking a deep breath to calm his nerves as he takes in the sight, admiring the way Dean’s muscles shift under his skin. “I’ll do the first few,” Benny says. “I want you to watch his body language and tell me what you see.” He walks over to Dean, laying a hand on his shoulder and talking to him quietly for a moment before backing up. His arm goes back, and Dean cries out as the first strike falls across his back, but he doesn’t jerk away the way Cas expects, and he seems to relax into his restraints more after each stroke, his cries quieting a little. “Color, Dean?”
I chuckle. “I suppose that would be useful. But you know, the best way to learn is through experience.”
You guys are awesome :D This one is mostly just fluff. I promise the sexytimes will return next chapter!
Cas smiled sadly, looking so much like the last moments Dean saw him before the Empty that there was a physical pain in his chest at the sight. “You really don’t have to-”
“G-Good, Sir,” he breathes. For a moment he panics at the idea of what he’s doing, and he looks away, only to be reminded at the sting when Dean’s hand comes down across his skin again. For some reason the reminder settles his nerves, and Dean smiles when he takes a deeper breath. “So good, for me, Cas,” Dean murmurs, starting to kiss and nip along his jaw and neck, not protesting when Cas’ forehead falls to his shoulder. He continues that way for what feels to Cas like a long time, the pressure of his finger slowly increasing. Cas pants softly against his neck, his hips rolling slightly as he listens to Dean’s murmured praise and encouragements. Suddenly, the sensation changes as Cas’ body yields to the light pressure, and he gasps, jerking away from it. Dean must anticipate this, because his hand moves with him, his other arm wrapping around his waist, stilling his movement. “Shh, it’s alright, you’re okay,” he soothes. “Cas, look at me.” Slowly, wide eyes meet his patient gaze. “Did it hurt?” he asks calmly. Cas swallows and shakes his head, trying to control the shaking that’s started in his limbs. “Okay. Are you in pain right now?” Dean continues.
I snort, shaking my head. “What, about the whole Gabriel thing? Nah, I kinda figured you two had something going on. I’ll kill him if he hurts you, but if you’re happy, I’m happy.” I look back to the archangel, who’s still watching me warily, like he thinks I might lunge at him. “I mean it, you hurt him you’re dead.”
“You got that right. I don’t believe that you’re just getting in touch with your inner Martha Stewart here, so what’s this really about?”
His smile only widens. “Oh, I’m sure. But he didn’t see me doing it. He saw you. Don’t you want to know?”
Dad nods, letting out a breath. “Of course, that’s...the offer is open, as long as you need. For you too, Sam. If I did those things to Dean, I’m sure I wasn’t great to you either...”
Dean sank down to a chair, burying his head in his arms. “What word?” he asked before he could stop himself.
Dean laughs, kissing his forehead softly as he pulls a strip of black fabric from his pocket. “You know me so well. It wouldn’t be fun if I didn’t challenge you a little.” He smirks, tying the fabric over Cas’ eyes and letting his fingers trail over his skin. “And I’m also not going to tell you if you get them wrong or right, so it’ll be a mystery if you’re going to be rewarded or punished.” Cas moans again, and Dean chuckles. “Easy tiger. Let’s warm you up first.”
“I don’t doubt that,” he chuckles. “I’m so proud of you. You’re doing so good. Do you want to continue, or should we end here for now?”
, he’d said, but Dean knew better than to think Castiel would still want him here once he figured out the truth. Still, it would be good to have a place to stay for now, until he could figure out what to do next, so he nodded in agreement.
“He’s been coming to our room in the mornings a lot lately,” Dean added. “Not just for nightmares. He seems to like to snuggle for a bit before we all get up. Actually, he’s been really affectionate in general lately, more than he’s been before. We don’t mind, and we haven’t made a big deal out of it or anything, but we did want to ask you to make sure we were doing the right thing. The last thing we want is to hurt him, or confuse him.”
Dean nods thoughtfully. “Maybe he got tired of being a second-class citizen and decided to go where he could be top dog.”
And then one night, Cas once again dreamed of hospital beds, how small and frail Dean looked in them, with tubes and wires protruding in every direction. The lax hand in his grip was cold and pale.
“I’d like to meet him one day,” Cas murmurs. “I’d like to thank him for saving your life.” He pauses, thinking. “Do you still sub for him?”
I grin, wrapping my arms around his waist and pulling his closer. “That might work better without your lips attached to my neck.”
“I kind of was at first. But I do know a little bit about fixing things. It comes in handy in our line of work.”
“I won’t let you hurt him,” Benny assures him, patting his shoulder lightly. “Besides, we’ve got work to do before we get near another person. You’ll do just fine.” Though still nervous, Cas nods and follows them towards the playroom, watching as Benny chooses a whip from the wall. “Alright then. Dean, why don’t you start preparing yourself while I talk to Cas here?” Dean nods, kissing Cas’ cheek once more before wandering to the far side of the room and pulling his shirt off. “So, you wanna tell me what it is about this thing that has you so scared?”
Cas hesitates for a moment, but nods, leaning heavily into Dean’s chest. “Okay,” he murmurs faintly, the words heavy with pain. “I trust you.”
Dean shakes his head. “I didn’t get a lot of details. I was mostly just worried about him and trying to keep him calm, and he wasn’t really coherent much. We can ask tomorrow. Whoever it is, they’ll be sorry they touched him.”
I hadn’t considered that angels had mates either. While I wonder at all the things I never thought about, I watch as his feathers twitch and move. When I glance back to him he’s watching me nervously. I stroke his cheek lightly, leaning in to kiss him softly. “Hey, it’s alright. We’ll figure this out, okay?”
Cas nods slowly, and Dean looks around with him as if seeing it for the first time. “More than I thought I would.” He hesitates, biting his lip for a moment. “So you do this a lot, then? Enough to have a…dungeon, at least?”
He nods against my shoulder. “Good. Does it feel the same as what you felt just now in hell?” I shake my head. “That’s good. Is anything hurting you?”
When I step out of the shower, a towel is left for me, along with a change of clothing. I dry myself and change into the comfy flannel and jeans and run my fingers through my hair. I'm already feeling infinitely better than a couple hours before.
Lady, you didn't even know him. I shrug. "I did too, but he's gone now. You can't bring him back." No matter how hard you try. I take a tired breath. Thankfully, my headache is almost completely gone, but now I am just tired. "So, since I am not at all who you wanted, can you let me go now? I won't press charges."
Cas glances briefly behind me to the staircase, and I understand. I grab his hand and sprint up the steps and into our room. The bed is made with a simple sheet set we bought a week ago when we couldn't stand the motel ones any longer, and I am delighted to throw myself down on it.
I hide my face in my hands, slightly embarrassed. No wonder the man at the counter looked so surprised.
" I see." Cas responded as he poured the strong drink into a paper cup. " That is a very reputable Auto shop."
Dean meandered over to stand in Cas’ little kitchenette. “What Kind of Coffee.” He asked. Cas didn’t miss the slight hopeful tone in Dean’s voice.
Charlie sighed and got up to peruse the closed. " Why didn't you tell me you had this?" She pulled out a navy dress shirt. " Wear this instead of that tired sweater."
He turned around but Dean was still in his personal space. His breath hitched. He suddenly felt like prey and that Dean was very much a hunter. The man's eyes looked too dark and Castiel was very, very aware of how much smaller he was than Dean.
Castiel rose a brow. Then tilted his head to the side indicating the chalk board that sat on the counter. It displayed the coffee flavours and types of regular coffees and teas.
Cas held up a hand. " as long as everything gets done, I don't mind you doing school work while you are here." Alfie gave him a bright smile and assured him that everything would be completed.
Dean leaned cross the seat and took Cas' face in one hand and pressed a sweet kiss to Cas' mouth. Dean's mouth tasted of beer and sweet desert. It was lovely. When they broke, Dean licked his lips and kissed Cas once more.
Pup99: When I have the area wet enough, I would slip my tongue in and out of his tight little hole. I bet it would be a virgin one too... nice and tight. Then I would press a finger in, hooking it to hear him moan.
It took Cas a moment to realize that the stranger was looking for his name. " Cas, Castiel Novak." he replied.
The redhead rolled her eyes. " Do I remember every word to the firefly opening theme? Of COURSE I remember Pup."
By the time he is through, Dean is wearing the shirt and looking at Cas’ photographs. He looks up with a smile when he enters. “Snooping I see.”
" t-two" He cleared his throat. " two fifty please..." Dean pressed the money into Castiel's hand and gave a little wink before turning to leave, raising the drink up in a form of a wave. " Thanks Cas, see you tomorrow." And then he was gone and Cas could breathe again.
Cas brought his mouth up beside the man's ear, biting the lobe before saying. " Should I allow you to come?"
Alfie showed up on time like he always did. And put on an apron before setting his book bag down awkwardly. " Uuh Castiel... Could I ask you a favor?" he asked.
" hmm." Castiel smiled against the man's ear, his fingers pressing at the base of his erection. " Should I touch you? Do you deserve to have me pleasure your cock or should I make you come from my dick alone?"
" Morning Cas!" Dean called as he walked in. Cas brought Charlie's coffee to her and nodded to Dean.
By the end of dinner they were touching hands as they spoke. Dean's mask was gone and Cas felt bold enough to feed Dean a few bites of his desert. It felt like he was into the fabled Car too soon. Dean drove him home and Cas lingered in the car. He wasn't ready to say good bye.
He froze then as he felt breath on the nape of his neck and fingers over his own as Dean reached past him to slide the book home. The man lingered there before giving a light chuckle. " Maybe you should get a stool."
" Listen, Cas, I am sorry If I have the wrong idea here... but I wanna take you out for a drink... would you like that?"
He canted his hips forward, burying himself deeper into the other man's body. He pressed his chest along that smooth back. One hand played with the chain connecting the nipple clamps, tugging at them lightly as the other pressed down that abdomen again to the straining erection between the other man's legs.
Before he can answer, a redhaired girl next to him interposes. “Make that two!”, she says with a bright smile. “We’ll sit right over there”, and with that she drags Dean to the nearest table.
Unfortunately, there are more customers who want to order, so Castiel gets back to work. He stares regularly at Dean, though. He observes Castiel’s movements the whole time.
Dean and the girl are whispering with each other. Neither of them takes notice of their food. Castiel takes a deep breath before he calls: “Dean”.
life is fucked up. But his friends, his family- All of them deserved so much better and he misses every one of them.
life – is not a fucking soap opera! It’s silly. He accepted his life – this cursed version of a life long ago. Life is a bitch; let go or be dragged.
“I remembered.” Castiel winks at him, seeing how his opposite blushes a bit more. “Do you want anything else – need anything else?”
Dean remembers the moment. It was the night before they faced Raphael. They were in the brothel together and Cas- was just being Cas. It was a good night.
Cas opens his eye to look at him. They are as stunningly blue as always. “You could frame it like I’m having a better signal here”, he explains.
His naked feet are echoing from the walls as Dean steps closer to one of the frames. At first, he thought it is a painting, but as he comes closer, he sees the picture is moving. There is him and Cas, laughing in some dark alley, walking to Baby. He can’t
“Maybe”, Cas says, “we could make a photo album with these and some more. We could ask Jody and Claire.”
“Hello Dean.” Cas is standing there, further down the hallway, in front of another frame. He faces Dean with his gentle smile. “What are you doing here?”
With nothing to do but the photos still in hand he goes into the kitchen. Surprisingly he finds Cas there, sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall. His eyes are closed and he doesn’t react to Dean’s appearance. He’s asleep. Well, sort of.
He knows Cas is right. He knows that Cas knows that he loves him, and that he loves him back and that it won’t start the next apocalypse and that no one else would even be surprised and still-
How could he? There is not much to proceed. They’ll be saving people, they’ll be hunting things and then they’ll start over again. There is not much in between and if there is, it won’t end well.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable”, Cas reacts nonchalant, guiding him another way.
Cas crocks his head a bit, thinking about how to answer. “You could compare it to that, yes, though it’s also nothing alike. I’m an angel”, he adds as if it’s needed.
“Of course.” Castiel passes Dean’s order to Chuck. When he returns, Dean has stepped aside far enough for the next customer, but is leaning heavily on the counter.
“What’s over there?”, Dean asks to change the topic. He is busy not to think about what he has seen; to think about how it would feel, when Cas’ lips close around his own dick. There is no way he’ll let this end in a wet dream.
A ring signals Castiel that another order is ready. For a second he hesitates, checking out Dean one more time. The man, gathering some more self-assurance through the distance, winks at him. That’s all Castiel needs to finally pick up the pen, actually meant to mark different meals in same packages, and write down his phone number on the paper bag.
“I’m doing better… now.” It’s true. The day was hectic and Castiel yearns for closing time. But seeing a friendly – and damn good looking – face lights up his mood.
“Don’t I deserve a day off?” It’s clear that it dawns on Dean just now that Cas doesn’t spent every day at his work and he smiles awkwardly.
Dean searches for an answer, but doesn’t seem to find the right words, so he settles for a small nod. They just smile at each other every now and then. When Dean’s food is ready, Castiel grabs the pen again. Maybe Dean is more of a writing guy. He scribbles down his email address to hand it over with a wink. He clearly sees Dean blush before he makes off.
This fic started out as an idea that hunted me for months and an ending I found within hours (after I spent weeks struggling, of course).
“I can’t quite tell. They do exist after all.” Cas begins to wander down the hallway, Dean follows him.
“You made me miss them”, Dean says, “You know, not just-“. Deans voice is rough. They talk about chose family all the time, but it seems like there is no more place for them after they passed away, which- most of the time Dean blames himself for it.
“Two cheeseburger, extra bacon with fries”, Castiel declares, louder this time. Still no reaction. Castiel feels lost behind the counter. There is no other work to busy himself with and clearly, he’s responsible that the customers are getting their food hot.
Before Castiel can decide if it’s worth it to eat his fries in the constant rain outside, the girl leaves Dean’s table, only to come over and take a seat at Castiel’s table.
Castiel enters the order into the register. “Extra bacon?”, he asks, remembering how he insisted on this the last days.
“Okay”, Castiel completes the order in the register, “and, what’s your name?” He will give it a try.
Cas sits there, literally all dressed up and with nowhere to go. Just waiting for the Winchesters to start the day and give him orientation on how to spend time. Dean wonders not for the first time why Cas bears with this: being cooped up in this bunker with nothing to do. Well, might explain what happened last night.
“Why?”, Dean snorts, even though he’s not sure whether he really wants to know the rules behind this stuff (because that would lead to too many questions, too much thinking about nonhuman structures).
Now that they are doing it, now that they kiss, Dean realizes that he expected it to be more different, something groundbreakingly, trumpets of Jericho like special, something supernatural. But it’s only a kiss. Dean loves the simplicity of it and the soothing feeling it causes. Only now he realizes the huge tension he was under for so long. And now nothing feels easier than sitting on the floor in the dim kitchen and kissing Cas.
Dean knows this place isn’t real immediately. Because he wouldn’t step in some third-class gallery (not barefoot in any case). Because everything seems a bit blurry. Because when he concentrates on it, he still can feel his body laying on his mattress like it should do.
“So, what are you doing here? Even you can’t have binged everything on Netflix by now.” Dean is trying to make sense of all of this. But thinking fells like reading in dreams right now: The moment he focuses on a thought he can’t make out the ones before anymore.
“Nothing would change, right?” It’s not like Dean hadn’t thought about the impact it would have to act on his feelings. Part of him knows that his concerns are unjustified, but he could need some reassurance here. It’s been so long now and Dean is tired of his own insecurity. Fucking coward.
“Your food’s ready”, Castiel declares and point at the plates. For a split second he panics he might have to serve him his order, but the girl kicks him very clearly against the shin with a bright grin and Dean gets up to come over.
he pulls his photos out. There are the ones of Mom and him and Sam. He also got one of Bobby and one Selfie of him and Charlie in their LARP-Costumes and – yes – he even has the photo of him and Crowley, where they had a fantastic-demonic evening with beer, cowboy hats and more beer. Dean printed it out at some point after Crowley was gone because, - well, he had no good explanation why, but at least he has a photo now. Because that is all. Seven crumbled pieces of paper and there are so so many faces missing.
Cas looks over to the place, which lays in darkness, as if the non-existing lamps were turned off. “I prefer not to go there. Not all stories end happily.” Cas’ glance becomes blank. “I have seen you die more than enough, I don’t need to see it in different variations.“
Castiel looks up as the little doorbell rings for the hundredth time of this day. This means, a new customer just entered the shop. A smile lights up his face – genuine, not as any sales pitch – as he sees the man walking towards the counter.
“I have to work”, he declares and shoves the rest of his meal to Dean and puts his apron back on. Before he steps behind the counter, he turns to Dean once again. “I’ll be off at 9, though.” Dean winks at him.
Dean hates this. When something is going on and Cas is going fully angelic and he doesn’t understand shit about what’s happening.
“Order is ready”, he announces and places their plates to the side, hoping they will just pick them up, but neither Dean nor his company reacts. They are too focused on their conversation.
“No”, Cas answers slowly, captivating Dean with his look, “everything will stay the same and still it would change everything.”
It’s been four days since this strange experience and Dean has to admit, that he is kind of disappointed every morning when he awakes. He wants to see it again, just one more time. He wants to see the what ifs and he wants to see his friends. He hasn’t thought about anything else since then. The thought of thousands of different versions of himself scares him, but there is an urge inside him, he can’t quite explain.
The gallery seems to get more spacious as he averts his gaze. Dean notes new corridors here and there, all stocked with these strange frames. His sight lands on another scene. He observes himself dressed in military uniform patching up Cas’ shoulder. “Are they all real?”
The next day, Castiel has a day off. His phone doesn’t ring once. He won’t admit it, but he’s slightly disappointed.
“It’s”, Cas begins, but seems to search for the right explanation. “It’s various possibilities of- of us, our journey, our story.” He points towards another frame, where Dean walks through the dusty forest of what he recognizes as the alternative world.
“Cas”, he whispers and kneels next to him. He doesn’t want to wake him, like you shouldn’t wake up a sleepwalking kid. Cas’ expression is soft and peaceful, his breath slow and steady. Without thinking Dean takes Cas’ hand.  He has never been that aware of the feeling of Cas’ skin and the warmth of it. Gently he caresses his hand.
“Well… I got distracted” Dean smirks, then nods towards the menu boards. “I’ll take the same again.”
Even now he lies in bed, tossing and turning, and thinking about how he could get back to the multiverse gallery. Of course, he won’t ask Cas about it, but until now he can’t find another way.
Dean blinks a few times before the room he’s in falls into place: Black and white tiles, bland walls and no defined ceiling. Though there is light coming from above, highlighting metal frames.
He hands it to Dean, who stepped closer to the counter again. Dean rolls his eyes funnily as he sees the big numerics.
“Sorry, Chuck!”, Castiel replies, pushing the right button to print the order. He smiles again before turning to hand the paper into the back. When he faces the counter again, he sees Dean standing some steps aside.
Dissatisfied with himself Dean stands up. It’s nearly two am. He sure as hell can’t sleep right now, but he sure as hell won’t lay in bed moping either.
He reaches over, starting to fill the tub while I watch him. When he straightens up again, I pull him into a hug. “Thanks…” I murmur. “For everything. You always seem to know what I need.”
“If you want to. Wanna start the bacon?” I ask. Sam nods, and I see Cas smile, kissing my cheek before wandering off to the living room. “So, where’s your little shadow?” I ask, glancing over at him.
He looks away. “It’s…complicated. And probably dangerous. More danger than I should be willing to put myself in. And yet, I have no desire to stop it.”
Cas snorted. “I’ve been told I don’t want to know. Charlie is a good person, but...she’s more of a chaotic good, if you know what I mean.”
Once he had double checked the door was locked, ( the last time he had gotten drunk he had forgotten to even close the door) he meandered into the living room and logged onto his favorite forum. He didn't expect to receive any messages. He stumbled around the small apartment, getting ready for bed.
" Sooo." Charlie started taking a cautious first tip of her coffee before deciding it was still too hot. " Who might you be. We don't get very many new people around here." Castiel was hoping that she would be too preoccupied with talking to notice the faint blush he could feel on his cheeks.
“Great. I’ll just go freshen up.” Dean headed to the bathroom, knowing where it was from using it earlier. Cas went to survey his room. There was a pile of dirty laundry in his reading chair. He hauled it into the closet. Next he rooted for the t-shirt for Dean. He made his bed then despite the fact that he was about to use it. Placed the shirt on the bed.
" what was what?" Cas asked with a raised brow. maybe if he played dumb, she would let it go. he had no such luck.
Dean was in Cas’ space then. He hesitated then drew his fingers along Cas’ jaw line, angling his face up. “Can I kiss you again.”
When Charlie went into Bliss is a Book with Castiel's daily pastry delivery, she was pleasantly surprised at just how cheerful Cas seemed. She hung back as he finished up with the first customer of the day. When the elderly lady left, she stepped up with her basket of goodies with a huge grin on her face.
Dean pressed a soft and sensuous kiss to Cas’ mouth. A thin whine sounded in Cas’ throat. “I like that your place isn’t perfectly neat. It shows me character.”
Cas' eyes shot open. No! He couldn't think of THAT here! He was suddenly glad that he had gotten a booth when he spotted Charlie making her way over to him.
" And you already know Castiel by nick name. hmm, you move faster than The Enterprise at Hyper-speed."
" That obvious." Cas asked with a smirk as he took off his apron and moved to grab a stack of unwanted books. He moved further into the back of the store so he could put them back in their rightful places. Dean followed.
" Good Boy..." Cas breathed. His hand encircled the man's weeping erection as he pulled his hips back only to slam back into him. He fucked him hard and fast, Milking the man's cock until he came hard against the sheets under them. Castiel thrust once, twice and came on the third thrust after, burying himself deep.
The next day was the same as the last. The same boring people came into the shop. Everyone but one spunky redhead buying their 'usual' drinks. Charlie worked down the street at the 'Green Briar Bakery'. She was in every day to display the cakes and treats that Castiel had displayed in his small desert counter. It was a good deal that he had going with the bakery. He was a coffee shop first and they only served simple coffee and tea. Castiel purchased baked goods from them at a discounted price and they got free advertisement out of it.
Dean leaned one elbow against the counter and grinned at Castiel. " Whatever you gave me yesterday will be fine. That was one fantastic cup of coffee. I am used to that shit they sell in diners."
" I just took a job here. R+C Auto. I am their new Mechanic." Cas nodded, pouring hot water into the press and then pressing it down slowly. The water turning a dark amber. " Just rolled into town. Thought I could use some Java to help me unpack.
When the coffee was steeping, Dean reached forward to caress Cas’ chin. He pulled him over the counter for a kiss. “I’ve been wanting to do that since we met.” Dean admitted.
Castiel stopped pumping his erection and blinked at the screen. He swallowed once, his stomach clenching.
" If you get the burger, we can split the nachos" Cas suggested. Mainly because he couldn't pick what one he wanted more."
He made her the drink and she thanked him with a wink, wishing him the hottest little sub he had ever seen.
Whipped-boi98: I came really hard just from Jacking and reading your responses. Can I add you to my friend's list?
Castiel snorted and proceeded to make the drink. He looked up when he heard the bell ring on the front door and froze. It was Dean. Why did he have to show up now when Charlie was here? She knew him well enough that when he stuttered or... Cas would never hear the end of it.
Dean talked about it until Jo arrived with their food. Hearing about the car was like reading a synopsis of Dean's life. He learned more about him from that one question than he could have playing twenty questions.
The stranger pursed his lips ( which were rather kissable actually) and looked above Castiel's head at the menu on the chalk board. His brow furrowed.
This was excruciating. All Cas wanted to do was go and chat the mechanic up but there was still a line up. It seemed like Dean was taking his time, just reading a news paper and slowly licking cherry filling off of his spoon. Castiel didn't miss him look up at him with a sly expression as his tongue flicked against the utensil... although he wished he did. The action was making his pants tight.
The rest of the day carried on as per usual. The usual customers with their usual orders. It was nearing the end of Cas' shift that he was starting to miss Dean. He had been in every day this week. Cas was getting used to seeing this little bit of eye candy. Well... he also had to admit that the casual flirting also set his blood on fire.
Pup99: No I want to taste you... We have been doing this role play thing a long time... I want to meet you in person.
Castiel's hands ran along the sides of the quivering body under him. Up underneath, along a heaving abdomen to toned pectorals. It was there that his fingers found what they sought. The nipples were hot and erect. He pinched them slightly, earning him a throaty gasp. his fingers moved then to the contrasting cold of the clamps drawn tight around those nipples. Castiel grasped the clamps them, pulling them until that gasp became a moan.
"Good." How he wished to say 'boy.' Dean's little moment of submission there seemed so natural. It was delicious. One arch of the brow and he was fumbling, dropping the playboy act a little. He wondered how easy it would be to dominate Dean. Would he submit like a good bitch or would he make Cas fight for it. Both options were appealing.
Dean said nothing and Cas couldn't decide if he was relieved by that fact or if it just made him more anxious. He had the drink ready and handed it to Dean.
Castiel wiped down the counter before standing to stretch and straighten his spine. He sighed and looked about his small shop. There was no one in at the moment and Cas was glad. The lunch rush had just gone through and he needed a good moment to tidy before the smaller rush at four. He really disliked it when the shop was messy.
Charlie nodded, noting that this was the end of the Dean talk. She had known Cas long enough that some times he closed things off about himself... like his family or his past. She had learned not to pry at those times and to take what information he offered and moved on. She was some times the same way. It was one of the reason's why they were such good friends.
The mocking look left Charlie's face. " Hey... everyone gets like that some times." she said gently.
Charlie gave him a little glare. " Cas there was some hard core flirting going on there. I don't usually see you get like that. All red faced and stuttering. It was kind of adorable actually."
Cas' fantasy came rushing back to him and he felt his cheeks heat up slightly. " Y-yeah... Probably should."
" He wants to meet me." Cas slid the signed check to Charlie with a smug smile. Her mouth dropped open as she took it.
When the tables were wiped down, Cas stepped behind the counter so he could wash the china and set them to dry. He was always careful of the china. He liked the beautiful designs on them and he didn't have a duplicate of a single cup and saucer. He was elbow deep in the hot suds when the bell on the front door rang, indicating some one entering. He shook his hands off over the sink, reaching for a towel to dry his hands on.
" Touch me. Please touch me. Please come in my Ass. GOD Sir, Please just move. Fuck me, stroke me till we come." The man paused when Castiel did not move. " Please sir." he whined.
Cas nodded and moved to prepare the coffee. His coffee was always made from fresh ground beans. The deep woodsy smell of the dark roast filled the air" Where are you from?" He asked to pass the time.
Castiel rolled his eyes. " Its the drink... they mix them strong here." he dismissed. " How was the bakery?"
Later that evening Cas went home. The outing with Charlie had gone better than he had hoped. After managing to convince him to drink copious amounts of alcohol, She loaded him into the back seat of a taxi and sent him home. She didn't bring up Dean again after he had avoided the topic. For that he was grateful.
“How considerate.” Cas smiled as he looked in his fridge. “Please do. So I have Orange Juice, Milk… Water. I could make coffee or tea.”
" Unfortunately unless we leave town, there isn't much else." Dean looked a touch disappointed. " But if we go early enough, they have a small dinner option and we can get a drink without dealing with the bar crowd."
Angel-of-Thursday: Meet me on Saturday 29th at 1.00 at the Starbucks at 22 Main. I will be wearing a blue jacket and I will put a red bag on the table.
Cas felt his brows raise. " What are you doing here?" He asked. " This is a long way from Sioux falls..."
Castiel could not help the flutter in his stomach or the shit eating grin than appeared on his face.
Cas barked a nervous laugh. “ Of course you do.” He moved to his bed and pulled the covers back. He slipped into them and patted the bed beside him to invite Dean. Dean laid down beside him with a content sigh.
" You were frowning before you frowned at me." She teased, reaching across the counter to poke his nose." Cas waved her hand away.
Cas let a groan as he slid a hand to cup his erection. In his mind he pictured Dean, coming up behind him and roughly pushing his chest against the counter of his coffee shop. Binding him there.
" Good. its a date then. Just no getting fresh." she wiggled her finger at him and it made him laugh. It had long ago been established that they would be nothing but friends. She was into girls and he was into men. simple. That didn't mean that they didn't flirt for fun once and a while.
Cas stripped off the sweater and shrugged the dress shirt on. It was tailored close to his body without being tight. Cas was used to looser clothes. Not something that hugged him so well. Charlie whistled as he rolled up the sleeves.
The man who stood at the counter was one he had never seen before. He had short dark brown hair and a pair of gorgeous emerald eyes. " Afternoon." Castiel said, setting the towel aside and tightening the apron about his slender hips. " What can I get for you."
Cas turned to him, a smile pulling at his lips. “If you want to come downstairs, I could make you a cup of the dark roast you like.”
Dean grinned as if he were glad he got something right. It was adorable. He seemed to be hiding behind a mask. like he was trying too hard to impress. Cas was already impressed. Dean didn't need to try. "Tell me about your car." He asked. Hopefully getting Dean to talk about that would get him to be himself
Castiel really hated to be a dick. He supposed that it was a little ridiculous to wait the return of his friend on the BDSM forum he frequented, but he couldn't help it. He was such an avid reader off of the forum and he really wasn't much for this... Internet short speak. It really broke the flow for him. this 'whipped-boi98' had been decent at the game, but still wasn't up to par.
" Nah, I've been there already... Know of anywhere that I could take you that would be a little more intimate?"
"Yeah." Dean was smiling that panty dropping smile. If Cas hadn't been the way he was, he would be in trouble. " So tell me about yourself. Got a favorite book."
" Castiel." He rolled the name on his tongue as if tasting it then rose a brow. " Interesting. Well Cas, You will be seeing more of me. Name's Dean by the way..."
First, he collected the books that had piled on the counter in front and behind him. Books that people had brought in, didn't want or had returned. He then went far back into the shop to return them to their places on the shelves. Far to many of them were going into the Romance section for his personal tastes, but who was he to dictate what his customers read.
Castiel shrugged. " Just because I am meeting up with him doesn't mean I am going to sleep with him... Did you want the same coffee as yesterday?"
Ooh God! Had he remembered to turn off the screen? Was the forum going to be open when Dean walked in? What would he even SAY to seeing something like that?
His apartment was small. There was a kitchenette off of the living area. There was enough room for a half moon table that was just big enough for two people. Off of the living room was a hall. One bedroom off one side and a bath off the other. What if Dean was unimpressed by his meager home?
Pup99: I want to eat him out master... I want to nuzzle his balls and swallow that cock down until I choke on it.
" How much to I owe you?" he asked, lifting the cup. Cas could have sworn that the man brushed his fingers on purpose. He was staring at him and it made Cas feel a little edgy.
This was his routine. What he had done since he had come to this place and inherited this little shop. He couldn't' complain. He enjoyed the quaint shop. A used bookstore / coffee shop. The shop tended to attract intellectual types in beanie hats and long skirts. Hipsters, he believed they were called. At least that was what his part timer, Alfie had called them.
The man left, waving over his shoulder and Cas wondered why he found it hard to catch his breath. He paused a moment before returning to his dishes. Once the china was all washed and the sink was drained, Cas set to sweeping the floor and the general clean up and supply fill he did for when Alfie came in.
Normally he would use a coffee maker but he was only making two cups. Dean watched avidly as Cas worked. Grinding the beans fresh and putting the grinds into the press. They were quiet as the coffee was being made. It was nice. It wasn’t often that Cas didn’t feel the need to fill the silence with nervous chatter.
Damn it he was an adult and if he wanted to invite his adult friend to sleep in his bed than he damn well had no reason to be guilty. Was slut shaming yourself a thing? Cas had to stop thinking.
He twists his wrist at the same time as his other hand brushes lightly over the marks crisscrossing his back, and Dean moans loudly. “Please, please…”
“Hmm. Well I suppose I can do that,” Cas answered, nipping his lip lightly. “Can I touch?” he asked softly, one hand hovering over Dean’s bare chest.
I try to step forward, to stop this, but I can’t get to him no matter how hard I try. Cas looks up at my evil twin, shivering. “Dean, please…” he whispers. The other me just grins, stepping closer and picking something up off a tray that makes Cas go pale.
Dean considers it for a moment, then nods, grabbing onto his hand tightly and allowing himself to be lead to a chair. “Don’t let go,” he murmurs shakily.
“How’s the pain, Cas?” I ask. “Better?” He nods, his shoulders slumping with exhaustion. “Good. You want to try to eat something?” He shakes his head. “Alright then, bed it is.”
“I understand that, Dean, and I appreciate it, but that’s not the point. It’s important for us to lay these things out now. I know you trust me, but there are a lot of things on this list that I doubt you’ve considered, and that you may not be comfortable with.”
“Yeah, I kinda thought he might be. He had one when he was a kid, until dad made him throw it out. That’s why I bought it.”
Hey guys! I'm sorry this took so long, I kinda had to wrestle with it, and I'm still not sure I'm completely happy with it, but so many of you guys seemed to like the first part that I figured I'd post it and see what you think. Someone pointed out that chapter one is a bit OOC, and I get it, but I'd like to think it's forgivable considering the situation. Still, I think this one is a little more in-character, but I'm sure you'll let me know if you don't like it :P
It takes a second to realize what I’ve said, but I only have a minute of doubt before I hear Cas’ possessive growl in answer. He takes a deep breath, looking at me curiously. “Color?”
Dean felt his face heat up, glancing away again. “I don’t know about that...been eating a bit too much pie lately...”
The knock at the door made him jump, but Sam grinned, jogging up the stairs to open it. When he did, Jody and Donna spilled into the bunker, and Dean smiled, getting up to meet them at the bottom of the stairs, where he was promptly tackled in an aggressive hug. “Hey,” he laughed, hugging them back, “to what do we owe the pleasure?”
Dean smiled, nodding. “Okay, good. It seems to make him really happy, but we just wanted to be sure we were doing the right thing.”
Cas sighs. “I can’t. For several reasons. But the biggest one right now is that I promised you we’d talk. I keep my promises. You know that.”
“It’s like a kind of safeword,” Dean explains. “Painplay can be intense, and I figured we’d both feel better if you knew you could get my attention even if you couldn’t say your word.”
“Just when I think I’ve figured you out, Dean Winchester, you always manage to surprise me.” I pause, watching him for a moment. “You’re really sure this is what you want?”
His embarrassment is almost endearing, and I kiss him softly. “Well lucky for you, you have me to take care of you. Now, let’s get you in the shower.”
I nod, setting Dean down on the couch while I grab the child-friendly cup. When I return, he’s poking his head curiously into some of the remaining bags Sam brought. Grinning, he pulls out of one a fuzzy stuffed animal. “Cas! Elphant!”
He shakes his head, sighing. “I should have realized…I shouldn’t have let you…you didn’t even know what you were doing…”
The angel looked up sharply, unable to smother the small flame of hope that sprouted in his chest. “Well then, I...I’d be very happy to explore that with you...Dean, what...what is it that you want? With me?”
“Good. If I ever, and I mean ever, find out that you chose not to use it when you should have out of some misguided attempt to please me or your idea of what you deserve, you will be in more trouble than you’ve ever seen. And considering your past, that’s saying something. Understood?”
“I know. It’s okay,” Cas says soothingly. “You don’t have to.” He releases Dean’s face, offering him a hand instead. Dean considers it for a long moment before taking it, then suddenly pulls him closer, kissing him hard. It’s Cas’ turn to be surprised. “I thought you didn’t want that,” he says when Dean pulls back.
Okay, so I'm the worst, I totally forgot I was supposed to be updating this. Sorry! Life has been crazy (for reference, yesterday I got slapped and elbowed in the throat- preschool is a contact sport) but now you get this super special Saturday edition woo!
“Are you sure?” he asks. His voice is calm, assured as he pets soothingly over my skin, and I know he already knows. “If you’re not honest, I can’t help. Are you scared?”
He slips out, and Cas digs into his food enthusiastically. “Guess you were hungry,” I chuckle. “Just take it easy. You don’t want to puke it back up again.” Cas makes a face at me. “Just warning you.” While he eats I reach for the antibiotic cream Sam left behind, moving to put it around his throat again, but he startles, flinching away. “Sorry, sorry,” I mutter, mentally kicking myself. “Forgot. I’m gonna put this on again, okay? It shouldn’t hurt as much as last time.” He gives a short nod, stilling while I carefully spread the cream. He sighs softly when I finish, closing his eyes for a minute. “Why didn’t you tell me it was hurting again? I could have given you some medicine.” He shakes his head hard. “Okay, okay, no medicine. Just eat your food.” He does so quickly, downing the glass of water before lying down again. “You want me to lay with you again?” He nods shyly, so I shift over beside him, and he presses close. He looks up after a minute, staring at me curiously. “What are you looking at me like that for?”
He makes a soft humming sound, as if he’s considering information he didn’t already know. “Do you think I would hurt you in any way you didn’t like?” he asks after a moment.
Cas gives an involuntary squeeze and whimper, making Dean moan. “Want you to take me…” he chokes out. “So close…”
Dean blushes, smiling shyly. “Yeah, well...I love you. And you make me happy. If he doesn’t care enough about me to see that, then...I’m not missing out on much, am I?”
Dean grins, kissing him softly. “Good. I’m really proud of you, Cas. I know this was kind of outside your comfort zone. You did really well.”
Cas smiles, leaning up to kiss him softly. “I know, Dean. I understand. It’s okay. I promise I don’t worry about it all the time. Last night it just…spun out of control. On any normal day, I know.”
“I know,” he interrupts. “It’s not right. But we’re having a nice day and I’m not going to let hateful people like that ruin it. They’re gone. Please, just take a breath and sit down with me.”
He chuckles. “Yeah. I am sure. It’s in there somewhere. You just have to focus. Pick one thing and focus on it until everything else is quiet.” I nod, deciding that Sam is the easiest thing to focus on at the moment, given his proximity. Cautiously, I press closer to him, trying to block out everything else. Surprisingly, instead of pulling away, he pulls me closer, one hand resting low on my back, avoiding my injuries, and the other pressed to the back of my neck. His grip is firm, but not alarmingly so, and I find it oddly comforting, despite being strange. I wonder idly if this is a purely human reaction or not. After a minute or two of focusing on his solid, steadying presence, I once again attempt a deeper breath, and this time it’s a little easier, a little less tight. Sam must feel it, because a relieved sigh escapes him. “See? You did it.” I nod, staying that way for a minute until I think I can keep it together on my own, before slowly looking up at him. Though slightly less worried than before, his expression is still soft with concern. “Feel better?” he asks.
Dean grins at him. “Met God, became a Guardian, and got a promotion, all before breakfast. I’d say this is going to be a good day.”
“Holy shit, Cas,” he rasps out once he manages to find his voice, hearing the low, warm chuckle in his ear.
Slowly, he sinks down to one knee. I watch him curiously as he pulls a box out of his pocket. “Cas, I…you know how hard it is for me to talk about feelings. But I also know that you want to be sure I’m ready before you do this, because you care about me. I know how much you’ve sacrificed and done to make me comfortable. So I figured this way, you’d know I’m sure.” He opens the box, and a sliver band gleams up at me. “I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and…Yes, Cas,” he murmurs. “I’m ready. I love you. I want this.” His wings fold back, in full agreement with this decision, and I watch as he slips the ring onto my finger.
Dean doesn’t relax, of course, but Cas didn’t really expect him to, only speaking to let Dean absorb his tone, hoping the surety of it moves him closer to a place where he’ll allow himself to be cared for. As much as he wants to berate himself for allowing him to fall so far, he knows he needs to focus his energy on Dean right now if he has any hope of bringing him back after so long falling prey to his own self-destructive thoughts.
“I think ‘dungeon’ is a little dramatic,” Cas answers as he watches. “I’d say it’s more of a…playroom. I thought maybe we should have a place to put all this stuff. These rooms are soundproof, so you wouldn’t have to worry about who’s around. And I had Gabriel charm the door, so only we can get in.”
Dean shrugged slightly, squeezing his hand lightly where their fingers tangled together on top of the blankets. “We’ve got time.”
In the morning, Dean woke to soft snores, the arm over his hip tightening slightly when he shifted. He chuckled softly, kissing Cas lightly as he stirred. “Morning sleepy...”
“That’s okay,” he says quickly. “I’m just…glad you’re feeling better. Hey, listen. I might have a potential case, if you’re interested.”
“I told her you were into dudes too, and she said I was crazy,” the girl shrugged casually. “So are you two, like, together now, or...?”
He smiles, glancing around the room and giving a low whistle. “When I said we were gonna destroy this place, I didn’t mean it quite so literally.” I follow his gaze, chuckling at the destruction we’ve caused. Even the edges of the curtains are singed, little wisps of smoke still coming up from the furniture. I set everything right, and he chuckles. “That’s going to come in handy.” I shift, and he gasps softly. When I look at him questioningly, he smiles. “You’re still kind of…” he gestures, and I look down to where our hips are joined.
He nods, scraping his teeth just under the bolt of my jaw, his hands traveling up my bound arms and interlocking his fingers with mine, squeezing tightly. He lets out a rough, broken sound as I feel him pulse inside me, and the sound pushes me over the edge after him, shouting his name to the ceiling.
Cas nodded, his hand shifting slightly. “Okay. Might be a bit uncomfortable at first. Breathe through it, and tell me if you want me to stop.”
I think about it. “No, but my social compass doesn’t always point north, so I’m not the best judge.”
Sam laughs. “It’s not that hard to figure out. Honestly Dean, I’m not freaking out.” He pauses, looking at the wings curiously. “They are interesting, though…”
Dean chuckles, stroking his cheek lightly. “You’re so beautiful baby. It always feels like that at first. Take some deep breaths and try to relax.” He reaches down, wrapping his hand around Cas’ shaft and stroking slowly, grinning at the low moan that escapes him as the tension in his muscles starts to ease. “There you go. Better?”
“Of course I would. Cas, it’s not the instrument itself that’s scary. It’s who’s behind it that makes a difference.”
I hesitate for a moment, pulling the note from my pocket. “I found this weird symbol in...a book, and...I was hoping you could tell me what it is.”
“No problem,” she answered cheerfully. “I’ll keep digging into these files and see what I can find. If you need anything you know where to find me.”
“If that’s what you want,” Dean assures him. “I asked them to stick around for a while. Let’s get you cleaned up and comfortable and then you can see them, alright?” Cas is suddenly aware of the uncomfortable mess he’s made in those stupid shorts, and he nods in agreement, holding on tight when Dean carefully lifts him to his feet. He cleans up the mess gently, helping him into soft sweatpants and a t-shirt. “So? How was it?”
We have to drive about an hour before we reach the nearest mattress store. I've been so focused on Cas and me working that I completely forgot that Cas was real fucking rich. The expensive mattress he buys us feels well worth the cost in the store.
I look at him intensely. "Cas, I know we're married and shit, but I would really like to wait a little bit before we, y'know—"
"Of course, man. It would be rude for me to just show up without asking." Dean paused, then lightly shoved Castiel's shoulder, pointing down into the water. "How about that one? I'd bet I can catch it."
"You're making me jealous of the pie, Dean. Bring it over here, and you will really get to enjoy some of it."
Castiel lowered the wreath down atop Dean's head, fingertips brushing Dean's short hair lightly. He admired the look of the crown on him, head tilting and lips pursing in realization of how endearing Dean looked with it on.
"You didn't get any food yesterday, and we can't have you starving before my sister gets her wishes answered."
I'm not sure how much time has passed, but when Cas returns, I have assumed the fetal position on the thickly carpeted floor. He grabs at me, pulling me up into his arms.
I'm bouncing in Cas' arms as he practically sprints out the front door toward whatever vehicle he has secured for us. He lays me gently in the back seat, then starts driving the car.
Cas gives me an incredulous look, shrugs, then answers, "Yellow, I guess." I glance down at his clothing, not seeing a hint of yellow. I raise my eyebrow, and he shrugs. "What about yours?"
His beautiful eyes go dark again, filled with want. I delight in the knowledge that that's all for me. And then he takes me back in his mouth, his fingers rubbing over my asshole again and again and again until—
"I was trying to get home. My dad wanted me back before sundown, especially since he didn't want me leaving in the first place. I didn't think I would find anyone here though." The man broke his smile with his tongue brushing between his teeth.
"Sounds good." I start to walk towards the door, but Cas catches at my hand. I turn around and he pulls me into a hug. I wrap my arms around him and take in his scent, the same one on me, probably, but it smells different on him. Better on him.
Rachel pouts, then gets up off the bed and strolls towards me, a smirk revealing itself on her face. "How about if I do this?" Rachel says, before sitting herself in my lap, and pressing her lips against me.
I make a move to sit upright, but I am stopped by a clanging pain that shoots through my head. I groan in frustration.
"Don't fluff yourself too much. I wasn't "in awe at your awesomeness," I was thinking about you in an apron like her's, and how cute you'd look."
He stumbled upon a small bed of red flowers and gathered them together in his skirt after realizing that he had left his basket next to Dean. The flowers would be perfect for Dean, offsetting the brilliant green of his eyes.
"When we were little! Surely, you must remember when we first met. It was 12 years ago, when I was 9 and you had just turned 17. At your party! I wished you a happy birthday and asked if you would date me, so we could get married."
“Well, we both have the day off...so a couple more rounds? We’ll get pie in between. I still need to see if the cherry pie is still better than sex.”
"Who would? I'd like to know someone before I decide to tie the knot..." Dean's eyes caught at Castiel's. "How old are you anyway?"
Castiel was pleasantly surprised at the ease at which Dean had caught the fish. And Dean's delight, of course, was memorable.
After a couple of minutes of torture, I apparently lose consciousness because, suddenly, I am woken up by a sharp pain in my arm, different from the throb in my head.
I turn back to my cooking, removing the cooked meat from the pan and onto the buns. I stops in front of Cas, holding the plate out to him, smile bright on my face. Cas grabs the plate, puts it down, then takes my plate too, and does the same.
"We also need some pepper and cinnamon. Our stores are running low," Anna said. Castiel's stomach delighted at the thought of Anna's specialty sweet cinnamon bread.
"No, that's alright. You weren't told that you couldn't." He steps towards me, his frame making me feel small despite my height and muscly build. I had seen before in the café that he was tall and real fucking ripped, but there I was behind a counter. Here, with nothing between us, I can't help myself from feeling small. Especially under his gaze.
I stare at Cas, letting my eyes run over his delicate yet strong features. So pretty, so handsome. The sense of want in me rises as I observe him. I kiss the side of his mouth, lightly to not wake him. Then I dive under the covers. Finding him down there is easy and I waste no time grabbing his dick and massaging it inti hardness. I hear Cas groan above the sheets. Smiling, I move my head to his dick and kiss the tip, like he had done yesterday. Another moan from Cas.
Eventually, I get up out of the bed, my legs shaky and weak from disuse. I walk around the room, finally seeing it's full size as I emerge from the cocoon of drapes around the large bed.
My heart races as fear overcomes me, and I don't speak or move, and I try to make my breathing as shallow as I can.
After a few moments, he releases me. I'm left a little dazed, and hardly realize that he's leaving until I hear the door close quietly. I sit down on the bed for a minute, trying to catch my mind up to the events of this morning. I slowly dress myself and get ready, snagging some of the food we grabbed yesterday as breakfast. I leave a note on the complementary notepad the motel offers, telling Cas where I am if he happens to get back before me. And the. I exit the room.
The boss glares at me. "No. If I can't have him, you will simply have to do." She crawls up onto the bed and creeps closer to me, her eyes darkening.
I increase my walking pace, hoping to get back sooner. I hear Cas laugh behind me, and then he's right next to me again.
The man is there and he hands us the keys and the place is ours. I rush inside as soon as Cas unlocks the door, and dance around happily in the front hall. Cas shuts the door, pulls me to him, and kisses me. I gasp, then meld into him. The kiss is perfect and I'm melting into Cas' arms as he pulls us ever so closer together.
“I think I’ve created a monster,” Cas responded before grabbing my dick and placing a deep kiss onto my lips.
"Wow, uh," Dean stammered, red slightly flushing across his cheeks. "Well, I like your flowers. These ones," he reached up and brushed his fingers across the wreath atop Castiel's head, the digits lightly grazing his hair and forehead.
I push myself further back on the bed, trying to get my jeans off as quickly as I can. Cas stops and watches me, staring intently at my crotch, then into my eyes.  I manage to wrestle out of the damned blue jeans, and Cas kneels back over me. One of his hands drift low.
"It was more than alright, Dean," Castiel responded, his breath coming out in small pants. "Uhm, Winchester, it is that way. You should be able to make it there before sun down. Be safe, Dean. I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow."
She spins around to face me again. "It's not that easy! I tried before and you barely even looked at me!"
Charlie turns back around. "Yes." She sounds relieved at the idea of someone else working with her. "We are. Are you interested?"
"Exactly what poison are you going to use?" Now that I know that this is happening now, my worky starts to increase. It's not like knowing the name of the poison will help me in any fucking way, but I tend to crave answers to everything when I'm paranoid.
Cas grins at me. "If you wanted to, you'll probably smell like hotdogs all hours of the day though," Cas laughs. "I'm not complaining, it might just make me want you more than I already do."
When we reach Virginia the next day, we are both a little worse for the wear. We stop in Richmond and Cas gets his name legally changed to Steve Smith.
I groan as I finally put the pie in my mouth. The tart and sweet cherries melding perfectly with the buttery crust. "This is better than sex," I proclaim.
This time, Dean shocked Castiel, who had been so used to hearing 'Cas' from his mouth. Dean smirked at Castiel's expression, then he winked again.
"Oh uh, cool, man." Dean pressed his lips together. Castiel moved and sat down on the edge of the running stream. "Uhm, yeah me too," Dean stuttered out.
The man shrugs, his face blank. "I don't know what she wants with you. But I myself have learned that you can never escape your past easily." He runs a hand through his messy hair, the strands going effortlessly, well, everywhere. The movement makes me momentarily forget what he just said.
"Where do you think you're going?" He says, then grabs my face, stopping me from moving, and kisses me on the cheek. He nuzzles there for a moment, then takes my hand, and we start walking again. I can feel my face burn a little bit.
Cas smiles at him. “What’s that?” He looks down at the photos Dean absentmindedly put on the floor next to him.
“Just like you, it seems.” Dean breaks into a laugh about Cas’ words. Cas enjoys the sound of it and continues with his meal. Without invitation Dean takes some of his fries to.
Dean moves on. There are more and more memories of him and Cas along the walls. Some of them he remembers clear as day (Cas walking into that barn, sparks everywhere, Cas nearly killing him in the crypt, Cas passing the pizza box over to him), some he can’t quite bring into line. The more he moves on, the more abstract the scenes get. He is pretty sure he never stood next to Cas, who leans over to look into Baby’s hood just to realize she is out of coolant.  And he definitely wasn’t ever a window cleaner of Cas’ office! What the fuck is going on here?
It’s a quarter past nine when Cas finally leaves the diner. Just as he breathes in the fresh air, his phone rings. He answers with a smile.
