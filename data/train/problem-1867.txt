It looked like he was getting married.
John smiled, watching Sherlock twitch and writhe on the bed.
“Be right back,” he said.
“What?” she snapped when she answered.
“Fuck,” he said, trying to catch his breath.
He looked up, breathing through his nose, and saw John looking down with wide eyes and an open mouth.
It had to be…
“John, answer the question,” she said.
Things get steamy.
“Yes?” Watson said, a little breathlessly. He licked his lips and Sherlock knew he had him.
“We were too similar. She’s with Kate now. She texts me occasionally to tease me about finding myself a boyfriend.”
“Ah, ha, nnguh!”
John looked up, kissing Sherlock sweetly before standing and walking weak-kneed back into the bathroom.
“Go slow, Sherlock,” John said, hovering over him.
“Fuck, yes,” John said and hurriedly grabbed his cock, knelt back up and shoved it in Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock saw him wince a bit as he caught one of Sherlock’s sharper teeth.
“I don’t know if I can still do this,” Sherlock warned.
Sherlock came so hard he saw stars. He grunted as he worked himself through it. The relief was palatable, he could
Sherlock could feel John’s tongue poke and prod him but now that he was over the shock of it he wanted more.
“Fuck,” John swore and started getting dressed.
Then they’d exchanged rings. His sub had been shot and had slight nerve damage to his left hand, his dominant hand. But the tremors weren’t just from that. And the cane wasn’t always in use the way it should be if his leg were actually injured.
“Green for good, yellow for nearly too much, red for stop,” Sherlock recited.
So, Sherlock wasn’t surprised when Molly grabbed John on their way to the lab. Lestrade had blabbed and Molly probably thought Sherlock needed a moment to set up.
It was a hard strike and Sherlock cried out as his erection was crushed beneath him. The only reason it hadn’t flagged was due to the ring. “Five,” Sherlock sobbed and realized he was crying.
He flipped through the envelopes, diving the bills into “pay now” and “pay next month” (the second was alarmingly large) when he saw it.
“What? No, I… what?” John stammered. He decided it wasn’t important and said what he had intended to say, “I don’t have the address.”
John smirked at him and repeated the treatment on Sherlock’s other nipple.
Fair warning, I don't know squat about sounding. I got all my information from these websites: https://www.lovehoney.com/bondage/cock-ball-toys/buyers-guide/what-is-urethral-sounding/   https://mrracy.com/urethral-sounding-guide/ and I hope I didn't write something terribly wrong. If I'm giving bad advice please tell me in the comments. If I can't re-write the bit then at least I'll leave a new note in the comments.
“Fourteen,” John corrected.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, smiling at it.
“John?” he asked, looking at John’s blood-soaked denims.
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanks to my beta for pointing out all the things out that I should know but forgot. They made this brilliant instead of lacklustre.
He did know that John wasn’t only sad, that he was angry. He needed an outlet.
Sherlock whimpered. It wasn’t enough.
Sherlock fell forward; he braced himself against John’s thighs but his nose still mashed against John’s pubis. Sherlock’s throat closed but he successfully suppressed his gag reflex.
He used the back of his hand to wipe the come from his chin and licked what he could off his lips.
When he got back upstairs with the frozen peas John was sitting on the edge of the bed tugging on the cage fruitlessly making little destressed annoyed sounds.
“Now, John Watson,” Sherlock looked into John’s deep blue eyes, “fuck me, slowly.”
"Do you have a name?" John asked.
The water-based lubricant was starting to get sticky and Sherlock felt John’s movements drag. This couldn’t go on much longer without risking getting sore.
“Sherlock!” he shouted. He was close, too close.
"No one is here," Sherloc said. They were wondering if their Jawn was injured and was seeing Terrans were there were none.
If you like this version of the D/s world and want to write in it link me or put me in an inspired by. I would be honoured. Also, if you are just inspired by a line and write or draw something, even if it seems completely unrelated, I want to see it. Drop me a link in the comments so I can revel in your awesomeness.
“Nnguh,” Sherlock groaned into his pillow. No matter how many essays John wrote he never would have understood.
“No, it’s not.” Sherlock felt horrible. Now John would think that either there was something wrong with him or that Sherlock wasn’t interested in John enough to keep an erection.
John came back and set the glass on the nightstand. He rubbed cream into all of Sherlock’s sore spots, being very careful and gentle. Sherlock soaked in the attention and had a small smile when John was done whispering praises and tending to Sherlock’s welts and bruises. He said he hadn’t broken the skin and Sherlock smiled, John was always so careful, so perfect.
John handed out condoms.
Sherlock leaned in and so did John.
,” Mike clarified
Finally, John sucked in a rattling breath, his eyes were wet but tears weren’t falling.
“Oh, righ—ah!” John gasped when Sherlock rested up on both elbows in order to grab and hold John’s hips in place. His fingers dug into John’s thighs.
John rang off without requesting that Mycroft contact him when he heard from Sherlock. He was angry. The worst part was that he knew that if Sherlock had told him he was going off on a dangerous mission John would have dropped everything and followed, leaving Rosie to whomever would take her. God, he was the worst father. Sherlock had done what Sherlock had always done, making the call without consulting anyone. John wouldn’t thank him; in fact, he might punch him when he came back.
Unsurprisingly, he didn’t see anything.
He looked away. It was shameful. He didn’t know John. He had his deductions but he didn’t have anything real. Love, true love, took time. Besides, he’d never see him again.
“You-hoo, boys. Client.”
The two just grinned at one another.
Frankly, Sherlock found John’s behaviour alarming and he wondered at John’s mental state. He gave John a simple command, to get in the elevator, to see if he’d respond. He did, even following the order without undue hesitation.
“John,” Sherlock whimpered.
So, when John said he wanted to go out that night Sherlock had put on his best suit and the purple shirt John liked so much and tucked the little box with John’s ring into his pocket, just in case.
That was a matching envelope.
“Joooohn-nnguh,” Sherlock said, undoing his trousers with one hand and taking out his cock.
This was getting out of hand. He thought that maybe he should stop, that they should take it slow. Have some time to process their new relationship before having sex. He stood over Sherlock, looking at the tent in Sherlock’s trousers, his flushed cheeks, his dark eyes, his swollen and moist lips.
Sherlock could feel John’s erection through all the clothing. He wanted it. He needed it.
John snorted. That was the exact reason he had never looked the man up. If he remained in London there was a chance, a slim, stupid, pathetic chance, that they’d run into each other. John was sure he’d recognise him even if he had changed his hair.
Sherlock kissed him, devouring him, owning him.
He found that he was losing his erection due to the cold.
“Sherlock?” the counsellor asked.
“I have to go out there to get more clothes,” John hissed. “I can’t find my shirt.”
“Yeah, got some more condoms too,” John said. His eyes raked down Sherlock’s chest and stopped at his flushed erection. “See you managed to get him to follow my orders.”
“What?” John asked, thrown again. He’d suspected Sherlock could read minds. He always seemed to know when he was using to much pressure, how he needed to move his tongue, when to clench and how to press every single one of John’s buttons. It was almost as if he were some sort of succubus.
Well. That answers a few questions.
John dragged the leather over the plug in Sherlock’s hole and Sherlock rolled his head and moaned. Sherlock stretched out his hands and closed them, kneading the sheets like a cat. When John tapped lightly at Sherlock’s testicles he threw his head back and moaned.
Sherlock’s scent was everywhere. It was his hands pulling John down. Wanting John to join him. To come where he was and have adventures in the afterlife.
When he glanced over and realized John had no such compunctions regarding watching him disrobe, Sherlock started putting on a show. Nothing overt, he just told his body to slow down and move more fluidly.
Arms wrapped around Sherlock, one undoing a button in the middle of his purple shirt and sliding inside. The other stroked his erection through his trousers. He could feel James grind against his arse.
“Boys?” Mrs Hudson called. “You have a client.”
In that one word Sherlock could read the answer, yes John always moved like that on prostate exams. Sherlock felt sorry for John’s patients.
Her eyes lit up as she handed over the papers.
“I can’t do this,” John said.
Sherlock got defensive. “You ordered it! I thought you wanted this!”
“I wish—”
Rosie nodded and started a fight with her veil. John straightened it out for her and she smiled, eyes bright and gleaming when they met his in the mirror. At her father’s expression her smile fell.
“Oh, my god. Sherlock?”
hadn’t he researched all this beforehand? Why had he been so focused on the counselling?
Sorry for posting a few days late.
“My turn,” he announced. His hard prick was shiny from precome.
There was no response so Sherlock sent another.
was etched into Sherlock’s skin. He kissed up and down John’s neck, licking the sweat from his skin, biting little marks of his own on John’s body. The ones he’d left before were still vibrant.
“It’s not Christmas yet,” he said.
“Stay down, you idiot, you’ve been shot,” Sherlock snarled at John’s advancing form.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hummed as he bit at John’s collarbone.
“Well, I can see you boys are in the middle of something. I’ll leave you to it,” Mrs Hudson said brightly.
“Alright,” Sherlock said, agreeing and ending the conversation. He would just have to be more careful. It wasn’t just him anymore.
John allowed it so Sherlock took it as welcome. He kissed John while he peeled his nightclothes off, covering every bare bit of John’s skin with the press of his lips. He kissed over John’s nipples, down his stomach, up one leg, down the other, each of his toes, then he took John’s cock in his mouth and sucked. He licked and lapped at it until it was hard.
Just when Sherlock’s brow furrowed and his mouth twisted John thought he’d had enough. He dragged the feather along the arch of Sherlock’s foot.
John stated that he had survived the crash. He'd heard from O'Murtagh and Martinez was dead. He wasn't quite sure what to say about the creature so he didn't say anything. Whatever it was, was obviously intelligent and John didn't want to receive orders to kill it... or worse.
“I’m glad you did,” Sherlock said. He wanted to ask John all sorts of questions and he might have if he were still the same man he was when they first met. Now, he knew better. John didn’t want to talk about that time, about his discharge and Sherlock wasn’t going to force it.
Bees! Now, on the roof. And while he watched them John could be with him, taking care of the plants.
“Oh my god,” John whispered. His face was twisted and Sherlock couldn’t read it.
And lately sometimes, he thought of other things...things that he really hadn't thought about for a very long time. Things that had certainly been dormant since his very late boyhood and had re-surfaced briefly again in his university years when life had been so,
“Everyone’s here!” replied Lucia happily. “Sherlock and Mycroft arrived yesterday and their friend John arrived just after lunch today.”
The shower took quite a long time, they were both very noisy again, and by the time they were finished, they had used up all the hot water. John had not experienced so much sexual gratification in one afternoon since he was about 22. It was truly exhilarating. This was the best kind of sex; hot, exciting and intense - with laughter and honesty, and with someone you really cared about and who cared about you. With someone you loved. It was the emotional connection that made it
And then Sherlock smiled.
But Agatha was feeling great. “
used it from Sherlock, that he didn't know what to do with this. They lay there, breathing rhythmically together under John's duvet, in John's bed, and didn't speak or move or look at each other. John closed his eyes and took a very deep breath, and he found that the warmth and the presence of Sherlock in his bed was strangely comforting. He realised he felt very…grounded, suddenly. Brought back down to Earth by the welcome weight and pressure of his friend's body beside him. It was like being anchored. He began to relax. So much so, that he only realised he'd dozed off when he opened his eyes again and found Sherlock gone and that he was alone.
“You chose
“Of course,” replied Mycroft, adding, “inside right pocket…”
"Like you loved…
"Cold fish, Mycroft!" John said apologetically, reading it out, though he already knew what it would be, and some more raucous sections of the table laughed. John noticed that Sherlock was grinning from ear to ear. John felt a bit bad for Mycroft. In his family, people had been many things, but no one had ever been a Cold Fish. Wordlessly, and seemingly completely unbothered, Mycroft took the fish from his palm as John had done and held it in the air for a second before silently offering it across the table to Siger, who had also nearly finished his scallops and salad and put down his knife and fork for a break. As Siger took the fish, Lucia jumped up from her seat. "Ooh, gosh, hang on, hang on!” she said, belatedly spying some empty glasses and the empty bottle. “That second bottle of wine you opened will be ready now, Sigs, back in a moment!"
And he was getting an answer to those questions. The fierceness of their embrace was changing form as they stood there inside it; he could think things that he couldn't yet say, and he was struck afresh by the realisation that he
He glimpsed himself in the floor-to-ceiling mirror as he strode past it in the short, dimly-lit entrance foyer. The vast antique mirror took up the entire wall of one side of the small room. It had a black walnut frame which matched the front door, and was itself framed by delicate green leafed plants in tall dark pots. Mycroft did a double-take to throw a quick appraising glance over, but only to be sure he looked presentable. Yes, he thought, pleased with his appearance, he’d been
As he lay there on the cold pavement - with everyone scurrying frantically around him and John almost deathly still, silently weeping beside him - he thought, if he survived this, if he came back from this, he could never do this to John again.
Sherlock felt moved to speak at that. "Nor could I, John,” he said.
thought Greg.
Mycroft smirked. “As I said,
Greg rounded the doorframe slowly and silently, peering round it cautiously a bit first, to see if Mycroft was awake. He was wearing a fleecy blue and grey checked dressing gown in a thick heavy fabric, and his hair he seemed to have simply brushed back roughly with his hands, just as Mycroft had. His feet were bare. To Mycroft, he looked

He'd been worrying that this new emotional attachment was clouding his judgement.

and for the benefit of the table, he then glanced towards the kitchen where Lucia was, sighing in a comically lovesick way.
them anymore with that desperate clawing need. And there was a vast difference between the want and the need.
There was more blood now but not a terrifying amount.
John just stood there and raised his eyebrows and blew his cheeks out at the same time. He just didn’t know what to say. He was still holding the note, so he stepped backwards again and put it down next to him onto Sherlock’s chest of drawers.
You can thank StarsAndStitches for the Geometry textbook. :)
"Train times to Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex,” replied Sherlock, typing and frowning.
Greg snorted laughter and then his smile softened. “Listen,” he said warmly, “when I saw you at that party….” he paused and smiled more broadly. “Basically, I took one look at you and I knew I just wanted to knock you right off your haughty pedestal—” and here he actively grinned again, “—and stand underneath an' catch you.”
and that was when Lestrade arrived, and so he began to wax lyrical with various combinations of profanities and obscenities, describing the police and their numerous activities, and when Lestrade read him his rights and arrested him, he announced, 'What total utter fucking
And John had thrown him a look and smirked at him in a warm, familiar way, and Sherlock's heart had emitted a single, sudden, hard beat. And that had been strange.
"Ok. So, er - why have we got it?" John asked, puzzled.
Before we both—I’d like to return the favour….”
"Er, thank you," John replied, embarrassed. John felt like a slightly naughty child that had been caught in the act, but Gabriella and Clarissa were much too distracted by Sherlock's words to notice John and his scone indiscretion.
Sherlock calmly selected a potato. “How could I forget…Mycroft nearly screamed the place down.”
Greg was totally into this. “Yeah?” he said, in a challenging tone, as if he were a teenager about to get told off.
- with this wonderful man. So really, he should be extremely grateful to Sherlock for…setting this up.
“Oh no, none at all. Goose is fine! Sounds lovely!” said John, before concentrating on taking an eye out of a potato. Then he continued, “I’ve never had it before, but I’d like really like to try it!”
- and although at the beginning of this little escapade, he had genuinely just wanted some ideas for what he could put in his blog and had been hoping for something that he could clean up and make into a good, usable and expletive-free sound bite, he was also quite tired and had a headache, was frustrated and pissed off, and Sherlock was being evasive about something John wanted to know and particularly bloody annoying full stop this morning anyway…so although, yes, he
Lucia grinned back at him. “Oh no, not a mistake!” she said, “Just a joke! He’s so
Sherlock chuckled. “I'm a drug addict, how clean do you expect my flat to be?”
“Hey, do you need some help?” Sherlock looked away, embarrassed by his withdrawal symptoms.
Dr. Watson stepped in and took a seat by the Sherlock’s bedside. He was intrigued by this peculiar man. Most of his patients were so ordinary, and rather rude, but Sherlock was different. Sherlock was fascinating.
“Thank you, John, honestly, I mean it.” Sherlock held out his hand to shake John’s. John eagerly shook his hand.
“Act natural, Pippa, you really want to sniff this patch of grass.”
Sherlock beamed, “I invented the job, I assist the police as well as take on private cases.”
“Yes, you were right about everything. Now, tell me about your dog.”
“What?” Dr. Watson looked at his puzzled.
Thanks again for reading, not sure when the next update will be, but I am working on a coffee shop au (my life is a coffee shop au tbh), so be on the lookout for that. It will be posted soonish.
“When will my brother be released from the hospital?”
Sherlock smiled sweetly, “This is Pippa, she’s a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and I just adopted her today.”
John nodded and thought about giving Sherlock a distraction. “How about another deduction?”
Sherlock shook his head. “Nothing is wrong. I've never had anyone show interest in my website or my casework before. It's nice. Thank you, John.”
The doctor cleared his throat. “Yes, I suspected that to be the case, unfortunately. I’m sorry to hear that.”
“You are the first one to call my deductions ‘Brilliant.’”
“You’re a doctor, an army doctor in fact, you’re used to seeing traumatic injuries, so crime scenes wouldn’t bother you. I talk a lot, out loud, and usually to myself, it tends to make the others around me uncomfortable. It would be rather nice to have someone to talk to.” A look of regret passed over him, briefly. John noticed this and gave his shoulder a pat.
The doctor walked over to the window and looked outside. It was a beautiful, sunny day, quite rare for London. He threw open the curtains to let natural light into the room and was greeted by a loud groan. Dr. Watson turned around quickly to see his patient sitting up, a thin hand covering his eyes.
“I love you, too.”
John was in awe. “You saw simple religious pamphlets and knew that that was the avenue you had to follow to find out more?”
Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock strode over to the table beside the hospital bed, took the notepad off of it, and scribbled a note on it. “Here’s my mobile number. I’m not sure how late you will be in this hellhole, but you are more than welcome to stop by tonight. I’ll order takeaway.”
Sherlock frowned at that remark.
Sherlock walked over to the chair and hugged John.
Sherlock nodded. “I've been told that I should have pursued acting, but I much prefer detective work.”
Subject: Resignation
“Forty-seven days.”
“Yes, Sherlock?”
"Ta." He went on up and noticed Sherlock's flat doors were all open. Before he could knock, Sherlock called to him.
“Hello doctor, Mr. Holmes, I have this for you.” John took the blanket from her.
“Cold.” John chuckled at that.
“Unusually tired, I was probably sedated. I’m assuming I overdosed because the last thing I remember was injecting a sizeable amount of heroin into my bloodstream and now I’m in a hospital. It would have been nice if my obnoxious brother hadn’t disturbed my sleep because now I’m drowsy.”
“Yes, I need a second set of eyes.”
One hour, the longest hour of his life he was sure of it.
“Oh please, spare me the details of this. The last thing I need to think about is he and that MI6 woman again.” John looked up, surprised by Sherlock’s comment.
“I hope you like the food, this is my usual takeaway spot.”
"Ah, yes of course." He said as he walked inside.  "Which flat is Sherlock's?"
Pippa looked up at him with a judgemental look on her face and went back to sniffing all of the other dogs’ smells in the vicinity. Just as he had deduced, the dog walker came around the corner, walking directly towards them with three dogs on his leash. The sun reflected off of his sandy blond hair, complimenting his tanned face, and bringing out the rich blue of his eyes. Sherlock knew he was a goner. Pippa saw the other dogs and tugged on her leash to get a closer look. Sherlock smiled, “Okay Miss Pippa, let’s go introduce ourselves.” He followed an eager Pippa to the sidewalk, directly in the path of the dog walker. The dog walker grinned at Pippa and stopped his dogs in their path.
“So, Sherlock, any other things you can observe about me?” John asked as Sherlock clasped his hands together, fingertips resting just under his chin, as if he were praying, and closed his eyes. A few seconds later, he opened one eye and peered at the doctor.
Living so close to Regent’s Park had its perks. For Sherlock, the biggest perk was the handsome dog walker who walked there everyday between ten and eleven A.M. without fail. The first day he observed the dog walker, he was actually paying more attention to the dogs. In fact, he went frequently to watch the dogs. He loved dogs and had not had a dog since he was a child. University campus didn’t allow dogs in the dorms, and after university, his drug habit took priority. There was no way he could take care of himself and another living creature when he was using. Since moving to the new flat on Baker Street, Sherlock has been clean. One full year is quite the accomplishment, but he had been so busy assisting the Met with cases which left little time to take care of a dog. Seeing that dog walker made his desire for a dog much stronger. He was far too shy to approach the handsome man without some help. Having a dog with him would give him an excuse to walk up to him and introduce himself. It was one thing when he was on a case, but outside of work, he struggled to come out of his shell. He didn’t have any friends, and never dated. Simply going to Regent’s Park to gaze at the dog walker was blissful, but he wanted more. He was tired of looking and not touching.
John smiled. “I'd like to read it.”
A knock at the door interrupted John before he could begin. A nurse’s aide entered carrying a thicker blanket.
“Three weeks. They assumed that it would be simple because the same gun was used and they had a small family and friend group, but no evidence was left at the scene and the conflicting theories left them confused.”
"Hey Sherlock, how are you feeling?"
John smiled and gave his hand a squeeze. “Good. I'm glad. Y’know, the circumstances of us meeting wasn't pleasant, but I'm really happy that I met you. I haven't really had anyone to talk to since I left the army.”
“Hello there Mr. Holmes, glad to see that you’re awake, I’m Dr. Watson.”
Sluggishly, he limped back upstairs to his bedroom. He sat on his bed and opened up the drawer of his bedside table. He reached for the only object in the drawer, his gun, and held it in his hand. It felt heavy, but it would lift away all weight from his shoulders. He would be at peace, at last. John stared at the gun for what seemed like hours. Things like this took a lot of courage. Of course, he was a brave man, yet he found that he faltered. This time he had to do it; he couldn’t chicken out again. Taking a deep breath, he set down his gun and picked up his phone. Opening up a new text message, he decided to leave a note.
“Much. Thank you.”
Sherlock was stunned, “Really?”
John quickly devoured his portions of the food, but Sherlock only picked at his portions. Sherlock's hands were shaking more and he had trouble keeping the food on his fork. John watched him, frowning.
“Yeah. You did all of that work by yourself and put it online. That's amazing!”
John smiled and reached forward to put a hand on Sherlock. “I thought they were fascinating. You're fascinating. Everyone else is an idiot.”
John got off work a little later than expected that night, but he did not forget about Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock had asked him to text with his takeaway order before he arrived at the flat, but he was running late. Had Sherlock already eaten? Before hopping on the tube, he sent Sherlock a quick text.
“Anyway. My brother is annoying, but his position can come in handy sometimes. My landlady got busted by a speed camera, and he was able to pull up the speed camera and delete all of the footage.” John’s eyes grew wide.
“Where were you stationed, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Afghanistan, but how did you know?”
“Your tan is only on your hands and your face, if you had gone on holiday, your tan would be more extensive. Your haircut is neat and very short, it’s not your preferred style, but it’s what you are used to. You’re left handed, I can see that by where you wear your watch, yet you’re holding the leash with your nondominant hand, that tells me you have an injury on your left side. An injury would explain why you are no longer in the military.”
Sherlock stared him down for a few moments, “I’m no amateur.”
“That better, Sherlock?” Sherlock nodded and closed his eyes.
Sherlock Holmes:
“Oh, that’s what you call seeing through people?”
John laced their fingers together. “I don't have a hospital shift tomorrow, I'll stay.”
Holy shit guys I am so slow, thank you for being patient. Please enjoy this chapter, I do not have a beta, but I did have a friend read through it for funsies first. If I make any mistakes, I apologize. The cases Sherlock talks about are based on real crimes, if you watch Buzzfeed Unsolved, you will recognize them. ;)
“Yes. ‘The Science of Deduction.’ Not many people have read it. Most people would find it boring because they are idiots.”
John shot him a disapproving look.
Dr. John Watson
John nodded and collected Sherlock's food, sealing all of the containers and putting them all in the bag they came in. Nervously, he opened the fridge, not knowing what to experiments to expect. The fridge was just as messy as his flat. John carefully moved containers around in the fridge, attempting to make the bottom shelf orderly, and placed the bag inside. He turned to Sherlock and laughed.
“Your brother has a date and he’s probably not going to come back to visit you tonight.” Sherlock made a gagging sound.
“Your brother said that about you earlier.” Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock smiled genuinely and turned an even darker shade of red. John gave Sherlock's leg a squeeze.
Sherlock chuckled heartily. “Adrenaline junkie.”
Sherlock had curled himself up into a ball under the thin sheet, faced the windows, and was shaking. John approached the bed, taking in the sight of the man before him. He looked so small and so fragile. He circled the bed to face Sherlock, he appeared to be sleeping. Gently, he pulled back the sheet to feel his skin. Icy, no wonder he was shaking. John grabbed the phone from the table beside the bed and dialed the nurse’s desk.
Yes, what would you like? I’m ordering Chinese, they deliver. SH
“Alright John, come to 221 B Baker Street after I’ve checked out of here. I’ll be there whether my brother likes it or not.”  Sherlock smiled briefly and laid back a bit. “I’m about to start withdrawals, this is not going to be pleasant, as I’m sure you know, so I’d recommend you check back with me later.” John frowned, got up, and walked to the end of the bed.
"John, come in."
John chuckled, “Wish I could take credit for the training, I just pick them up and come to the park. They are very good listeners.”
“He doesn’t like being idle, he won’t want to stay for long. I must leave for now. I have an appointment I must make. I’ll return to see him later. Please do give him a bit of company when he wakes up. He gets bored so easily and I don’t want him to damage any property.” He started walking to the door. “Thank you Dr. Watson.”
“He’s one of the most quintessential British fictional characters of all time. He’s an MI6 agent, codename 007. There’s loads of movies, and books. The series has been around since the fifties.” Sherlock gave him a weird look.
Sherlock found a cab willing to take his new friend in, and headed to the park. He plotted how to enter to the park to make the meeting with the dog walker look like a chance encounter. Also, he had to make sure to bump into the dog walker early enough, so that he can spend as much time with the handsome man as possible. The cab arrived right on time, and Sherlock tipped him well for not being an idiot. Naturally, Sherlock had deduced the dog walker’s route weeks ago and knew all of the best viewing spots. He led Pippa to the area of the park that he believed would be the least conspicuous and would grant him maximum dog walker time.
“I see something else in you, though.” Again, he was taken by surprise and looked up at the detective.
“Sherlock, please.” He winked as he started walking by John’s side.
“I wouldn’t necessarily say “better” because I have an intense craving for heroin, but it is nice to be leaving the hospital.” Sherlock turned back around and zipped the duffel bag.
He smiled at that comment and walked over to check the other man’s vitals. He glanced upon the dozens of little red dots on his arms. He remembered what the man’s brother said and felt sorry for him.
Sherlock was taken by surprise, but happily obliged. “You get bored easily, but you seldom admit it.”
Dr. Watson chuckled at the last comment. “Yes, it was a bit overbearing, I must admit. Now, Mr. Holmes, I need to run a few tests on you.”
He got up from his seat and exited the train. With his mind distracted on the thrill of spending time with the strange detective, he was not troubled with the sharp leg pains he was used to dealing with since returning to London. He even had a spring in his step tonight.
John petted Pippa’s big ears, “Well if you need someone to walk this little lady, you have my card.”
“It is delicious, thank you for buying my dinner. Next dinner is on me.”
“Yes, precisely.” Sherlock was at a loss for words at this point, he had no idea what to do next. John could sense the growing silence and tugged lightly on the dogs’ leash.
“I'm just glad to have intelligent company.” Sherlock smiled wider and looked over at the couch. “I'd like to move to the couch, if you care to join me, I'll tell you about another case.”
Moments later, the train arrived. John boarded and quickly found a seat, his cane prompted someone to stand up and offer a seat. His leg was not really bothering him, but he did not want to snub the polite gesture. As he sat down, his phone pinged with a response from Sherlock.
Sherlock suppressed a laugh. “That’s such a lovely string of questions. I am in a moderate amount of pain, but it’s manageable. None of that, really just fatigued and cold.”
“Shall we walk on, Mr. Holmes?” Sherlock grinned.
Once an hour had passed, he made his way back to Sherlock’s room. He slipped in quietly, he wasn’t sure if Sherlock was asleep or not, and he didn’t want to bother him. What Sherlock said earlier was true, withdrawals are not pleasant, and quite frankly, he hated dealing with them and druggies, but Sherlock was different. He was so very different.
“Dr. Watson?”
“Yes, also, I read your medical records. Terrible shame, really, you seem like a really smart bloke. You must have a pretty decent detective job, too.”
John rose from his seat and excused himself from the room. He could tell that Sherlock was wanting to go back to sleep.
Sherlock looked up and smiled at John. “Would you like to see it? My laptop is by my chair, if you can get it for me, I'll pull up the website and show you my latest experiment.”
The dog walker chuckled, “Oh, it’s really no trouble, I’m always happy to say hi to a dog.”
“If you insist, John.” Sherlock chuckled and took small bites of his food.
John went into the kitchen and set the bags on the floor. On the table was a microscope, dozens of slides, and papers strewn about. He delicately moved everything from the table onto the kitchen counter.
John nodded, “Typical symptoms, unfortunately.”
John smiled, “Do you have a business card for me?” He said it jokingly, but Sherlock reached in his inner coat pocket and pulled out his card.
He stared right at the man. “What?”
Sherlock gestured towards the red armchair opposite his. “Please sit.”
Sherlock smiled, “They have an excellent leader.” He winked at John. He desperately hoped that John was picking up on his flirting.
Attached is my letter of resignation. It was a pleasure working with you.
He froze and looked over at the pale man sitting upright, staring right at him.
“Of course.” John rose and rushed downstairs, neglecting his cane by the chair. Moments later, he came back up, a large bag of food in each hand. He looked around, trying to find a table to set up for dinner. “Where do you want these?”
“Oh god, if you insist.”
Mycroft walked back over to his brother’s bedside and brushed a few stray curls out of his face and kissed his forehead. He grabbed his umbrella and walked back to Dr. Watson.
“I do have to bring up your brother, though, I have a deduction of my own.” Sherlock stared at John.
“A companion.”
To: Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock smiled as he headed for the door. “I’ll see you tonight, text me what you want from the takeaway before you head over.”
“Nice to meet you, John Watson.”
I will be at 221B Con next week, if you are going, let me know and I'll come find you!!!
To: Sherlock Holmes
“Pippa, please slow down.” Sherlock tried not to sound so fake when “scolding” her. “I’m very sorry if we are inconveniencing you.”
Sherlock nodded, “Absolutely, your other dogs are well trained. I can tell that you’re very good with them.”
“Above the toaster.”
“How long has it been since you’ve been clean?”
“One day. I spoke with everyone after going through the flat and Lestrade’s case files.”
Sherlock blushed and looked away from John. John frowned when he saw Sherlock turn away from him.
“Oh yeah?”
I ordered both. SH
John beamed at Sherlock. “Yes! I'd love to hear some. Why don't we go back to the chairs by the fireplace? It will be more comfortable for you.”
I’ll be waiting. I don’t know what to expect.
John smiled and started on his Kung Po Chicken.
John was taken aback by that statement and cleared his throat. “What makes you say that?” Sherlock sat straight up and looked John in the eyes.
Sherlock smiled, “So I was right, magnificent.”
John gave Sherlock a kind smile. “That was really nice of you. You did the right thing.”
“What?”
The doctor stood there dumbfounded. “My god, that’s brilliant. You must be a detective or something.”
“Consulting detective, actually, not a bad deduction yourself, doctor.”
Sherlock took John's hand and got up from his chair. He collected all of his blankets and carried them over to the couch. John grabbed a couple of them and laid them on the couch for Sherlock so the cool leather would be covered. Sherlock bundled up in the remaining blankets and sat close to John. John looked at Sherlock in anticipation of the next case story.
John smiled, “Yeah I’ll be out of here in the evening, I’ll stop by.”
Depending on the support of his cane, he stood up and began walking around the room. He took in his surroundings, desperately searching his brain for memories of the detective. It had been almost two years since he jumped. John’s surprised that he’s lasted this long without him. Before meeting Sherlock, he was planning to end it all. He was bored; his life had no meaning if he couldn’t be on that battlefield. Sherlock showed him a whole new battlefield. One he didn’t see anymore, not without Sherlock. Boredom got to him again, so did grief.
“Sherlock that was extraordinary."
“People are usually not that kind about my deductions.”
Sherlock had seen an ad on a local shelter’s social media page about a “curvy Corgi.” The female corgi needed an owner who was able to take the dog on frequent walks so she could lose weight. He had inquired about adopting her, and after interviewing with them and a visit to his flat, she was his. He put a brand new, violet colored leash and collar in his coat pocket and went outside to catch a cab. Once at the shelter, he was given a folder with all of the pup’s information. She is a three year old, pure blood Pembroke Welsh Corgi, spayed, up to date on her shots, housebroken, good with people and other animals, high energy, and loves to run. Her name is Pippa.
“Your hair is kept short and tidy and your posture is impeccable, not even someone obsessed with keeping good posture can match, that says military. Your hands and face are tan, but there is no tan above the wrists. If you were vacationing, you would have an allover tan. Therefore, Afghanistan or Iraq.”
“Unfortunately. Enough about me, Mr. Watson what branch of military did you serve in?”
John smiled and used the cane to stand up and flop into the chair. “This is nice,” he waved his hand around, “Very nice flat, just a bit untidy.”
It was nine thirty in the morning and he had a date with the handsome dog walker. The dog walker was completely unaware of that fact, but he’ll soon find out.
Sherlock looked down at their hands. “Better. I'm not as shaky, my eyes aren't watering anymore, but I am still cold.”
The door behind him creaked open, breaking the overwhelming silence in the flat. He was afraid to look back and see who was there.
Give me one hour, I promise I will be there. Do not kill yourself, please.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand back, still looking at their hands. “Stay with me tonight.” He looked right in John's eyes. “Please.”
Rain danced against the window and a sharp ringing came from an old fashioned clock. Each morning was harder than the next. Even after all these months, life was dull. Every moment lacked that spark, a spark that only he brought to the doctor’s life. How is it that that impossible man had made such an impact? John sat up in his bed and slammed the alarm clock to shut it up. Sighing heavily, he checked his phone. He knew there would be no message from him. There never was. He couldn’t deal with this anymore.
“That's incredible. I'd love to hear more!”
Nothing would ever be the same without Sherlock Holmes.
Kung Po Chicken if they have it, if not Curry Chicken.
“You're the most interesting person I've ever met, Sherlock. Thanks for inviting me over.”
Sherlock leaned his head on John's shoulder and sighed. “Thank you, John.”
“You certainly don’t need to get to know the park.” John chuckled. Sherlock looked at him puzzled. “I see you here every morning, you’re usually sitting on a bench. See, I can do that thing, too.”
It took a while, but John read through the entire tobacco ash study. He looked up from the laptop and saw Sherlock reading something on his phone.
“You have been standing the whole time you have been tending to me. There are three chairs and a stool with wheels that you could have sat on, but you chose not to. If your leg was truly in pain, you would have taken a seat. You forget about it when you’re focused on something. When your mind is free of serious thought, your leg bothers you and the limp returns.” After that, a huge grin came to his face. The doctor was standing in the doorway, mouth agape, shocked by what he just heard. “I know I surprised you with my deduction. You go on and do your job, I’ll see you later.”
John said nothing and retrieved the laptop for him. He set it on the table in front of Sherlock and sat back down. Sherlock slowly opened the computer, not wanting to damage it because his hands were unstable. The website was already up when the computer came on. He turned the laptop towards John.
Sherlock blushed, “By that thing, you mean making a deduction.”
“That’s fantastic.” John couldn’t stop grinning.
When Pippa first saw Sherlock, she got excited, ran up, and jumped on him. Sherlock smiled, “Now Miss Pippa, you musn’t jump on me, good dogs don’t do that.”
“So I’m guessing my brother told you about my problem.” That interrupted his thoughts and he looked up at the man. His face was void of emotions.
Frowning, John walked around so that he was facing Sherlock. “Listen, if you want me to stop by your flat, I can do so tomorrow, I won’t be working.”
The doctor frowned. “Sorry to hear. I need to fill out some paperwork.  I’ll return in a couple of minutes.” He headed for the door.
“Life is so dull, I don’t have much going for me.”
Dr. Watson set his cane aside and reached his hand out to shake. The taller man stood up from the chair and shook his hand.
“What makes you say that, Sherlock?”
Reading and rereading the message dozens of times, John finally pressed the send button and picked up his gun once more. He knew he would get an error message. That number is out of service, no one has used that phone in two years. The phone beeped, the screen flashing “new message.” It was probably an error message, but he still opened it up.
Sherlock pulled an
He bit his lip a little at the thought, looking Mycroft over, and Mycroft knew he didn’t even realise he was doing it. Very telling. And rather exciting. “What are you thinking?” Mycroft asked suddenly, just to see if he would tell the truth. What would he say? But Greg was unabashed. He smiled easily as he brought his eyes back to Mycroft’s and said, “I was just thinking that you’re the only person I know who wears a watch on a chain.”
~~~~~
Sherlock smiled. "She said, 'It was odd really.' And then left it there, so of course I asked her, 'Odd? Why?', to which she replied that Gabriel Peters had used the exact same phrase as his sister. She said that they had both said, 'Final word', and then both had finished the conversation there -
right about the new peacock blue tie after all. He had dithered slightly between this tie and his other new deep red one, as both went equally well with the charcoal grey suit, but no, he’d been right all along. Instincts were there to be trusted. As always. This particular tie really brought out his eyes, and it was a subtle but noticeable touch. He ran a hand lightly over his neat hair and, satisfied, stepped confidently into the reception area, the black-and-white chequered marble floor announcing his arrival.
Greg watched him for a moment, admiring the elegant way he held the fag between his long fingers and drew in the smoke, turning his face away from Greg to blow it out.  He made it look like an art form.
The way John drove him mad with his not-thinking, with his inane questions, with his tidy tidiness when all Sherlock wanted was some chaos around him to be able to think clearly... But then, sometimes John being around was like Sherlock having his own lightning conductor. John sometimes had the ability to ask exactly the right question that would focus Sherlock's raging electrical storm of nearly-but-not-quite-knowing into a single point of light, a beam of energy that shot down and hit the ground and engulfed him and became him suddenly
"Right. We're going to A&E," said John firmly.
"What should I do?" asked John.
Then Sherlock leaned forward and said clearly in a low voice, "Tell me what to
to see you…” but Agatha was nothing if not undaunted herself by the actions of the two brothers. She treated Mycroft’s greeting-distancing technique
at these things?”
thought Mycroft with a sharp spark of desire,
Now. Gold star if you spot the line from the film/book ‘Maurice’ in this chapter.
Just then, there was a sharp movement on the table next to them that Greg noticed out of the corner of his eye, and then the man at the table leaned in to the woman he was with and Greg distinctly heard the muttered words, “…just didn’t think we’d be sharing the place with a couple of bloody queers...”
they both said, at exactly the same time, in two different ways - Mycroft furious and Greg incredulous.
There was so much that had been un-done.
He smiled under her scrutiny. “We are…” he said agreeably, tipping his head modestly to the side.
"I–I just...erm..."John found it hard to lie on the spot. And particularly hard to lie to Sherlock, to whom lying was totally pointless. "Erm, er...nothing. It's just strange to hear you..." He decided it would be best to tell a half-truth. "It's really strange hearing you swear, that's all. It's—I've never heard you swear before. You
thought John,
“Tell me what else you liked about me at the party...‘quite interestin’' is just not good enough...” said Greg softly, pleased with Mycroft’s enthusiastic response to his leg, and he slid his hand firmly round and over Mycroft’s lean right hip.
'That's precisely what I mean,' thought Sherlock crossly in irritation at his own thought processes, 'now I'm quoting children's literature! I can't even think like a mathematician or a scientist anymore - I'm beginning to think like a
Lucia and Siger had put John and Sherlock at one end of the table, on opposite sides of it, with Lucia next to Sherlock in the middle and Mycroft on her other side, at the other end. Agatha was next to John and Siger was next to Agatha. John found it interesting that Lucia herself separated and yet joined together her two sons at the table. He also smiled at the fact that he had been positioned next to Agatha.
He went back out to the sitting room and just stood next to Sherlock, who was now reading about Botulism poisoning on his laptop. John didn’t say anything, just stood there and waited, and after a half a moment, Sherlock stopped what he was doing and looked up. “You like it?” he said cautiously, like he wasn’t sure.
Mycroft paused, stony-faced. His mouth opened, but before he could speak, Sherlock interjected. “Or a cake?” he offered, thoughtfully, from the background.
John turned his face away and hid his grin behind his hand. Just seeing that exchange then was like a glimpse into the past - suddenly imagining Sherlock and Mycroft as actual children - how the fur must have flown when they were growing up, he thought.
he thought. The thought of him and Sherlock being noisy in bed together made his insides clench and his cock jump with lust. Maybe Sherlock felt the same way, as he suddenly reached down and had to adjust himself through his trousers. John could see his erection pressing against the fabric.
…Oh, right, yeah, ok…Ok, got that; but can you just…can you just tell me what he actually
“What you did…what you did to me…” Mycroft explained, equally out of breath. Greg rolled off Mycroft a little onto the empty side of the bed and one of his elbows, and stroked his other hand down Mycroft’s side. “You don’t ‘ave to—” Greg started, but Mycroft interrupted.
And John snapped. “Oh, you're the fucking
“Like….'I’m glad’, or ‘You’re welcome’ or ‘My pleasure.’ Something nice though, don’t be sarcastic.”
but then he came back to himself again. He brought his hands up quickly, to pull Sherlock away from his neck, enjoying a moment of seeing Sherlock's shocked surprise before John took his friend's face gently between both his palms, and watched the expression dissolve as he leaned in and kissed Sherlock softly and lightly. Sherlock closed his eyes, in pleasure, like a stroked cat, and John closed his own eyes and kissed him again, slowing it right down; first feeling Sherlock's full lips with his own, and then tracing across them with the tip of his tongue, and then pressing his teeth into them lightly. At Sherlock’s soft rumble of appreciation, their kiss immediately intensified again, and John decided instantly it was time for a chair, or the sofa or the wall or anywhere; in fact,
"Quite." Sherlock agreed, after a long pause. "That's what it's called actually, 'Excellent Birds'. Now the point is, John, the artist who painted this has disappeared. He was due to exhibit at a tiny gallery near to the Tate Modern - a one-off display for January and February of some contemporary mature artists who have found fame later in life, and he has already supplied several paintings for his exhibition...however, he was due to supply four more but he has now inexplicably vanished. 'Into thin air', it has been said. Which as any idiot knows is impossible."
Sherlock was busy collecting up stray peppercorns that had escaped ono the table. “Cats,” he murmured to John, without looking up.
Downstairs, Greg directed Mycroft to (and left him in charge of) what he referred to as his "amazing coffee machine” and the container of different flavoured coffee-pod selections. Then he quickly shrugged on some appropriate outdoor clothes and a coat, and was gone out the door.
They each examined the menus briefly and then discussed what they liked the look of. “What do we fancy then?” asked Greg with a grin, and as Mycroft announced his choice and began to describe the intricacies of Constantine’s extraordinary prawn and small seafood cocktail, Greg sipped his drink and watched him and thought, ‘I fancy
Then they lay there for a moment in silence, Mycroft’s hand resting on Greg’s waist and Greg’s on Mycroft’s shoulder, stroking lightly, and then Mycroft thought that really he should be the one to say. ‘Better not presume…’ he decided regretfully. He couldn’t see an alarm clock and his pocket watch was in his waistcoat, but it was obvious that the hour was extremely late. Well gone midnight, he thought.  “Well, I suppose I should order a taxi…” he began wistfully.
Sherlock looked up at John steadily. “As I said, why do you even need to hear it? You met him, you heard how he spoke. You can guess what he would have said to me and I can assure you, you won’t be able to use any of it anyway.”
John sat back in his chair and gave Sherlock his full attention.
he said, and on that command, they all pulled at once with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Varying enthusiasm or not however, it was still a very noisy event.
When he closed his eyes, suddenly everything was Sherlock.
While John was in Tesco’s, deciphering Sherlock’s scrawled additions to his list, Mycroft was at his desk speed reading an urgent missive from the foreign office in Venezuela. Suddenly Anthea popped her head through the doorway. “A note, sir,” she said, producing a sealed white envelope and holding it out delicately between finger and thumb. She seemed somewhat bemused.
Lucia turned to John and held out the diminished plate of mince pies and biscuits. “Well, no,” she explained, ignoring Sherlock’s outburst, “she’s not, actually, she’s Jilly next-door’s sister.”
Mycroft rested the side of his face on his hand. “That does rather depend on what you have to offer?” he said, and he smiled as he spoke, to say he hoped he wasn’t being too difficult. But he was very particular about tea and coffee.
...” before Mycroft could even answer, Greg altered his position and pressed his lower body full against Mycroft’s, to find Mycroft’s erection with his own. “Oh! Well, I definitely got
I love the posh way you talk, Mycroft…” he murmured, and he smiled against Mycroft’s skin. “I think I might ‘ave said that already…!” He paused and kissed the bit he had smiled against. “But, ‘onestly, I could listen to you all night.”
"Why didn't you realise he was armed?" blurted John, suddenly, realising that Sherlock would have known in a moment whether someone was armed or not.
There was a thoughtful pause then Clarissa said, “Anyway, more tea?”
But to his horror, Greg was just carrying on with his rugby-support daydream. “Yeah…I can see you on the touch-lines…” he said, sipping coffee, looking slightly dreamily into the middle-distance, “…wearing my spare rugby shirt and holding up the banner with my name on…”
meaning Gabriella - had just walked out and left, and
a moron for once, for my sake, and just shut up and watch the bloody film?…And next time, don’t tell me five minutes in what you think the twist is gonna be…” he paused, then decided to chuck some fuel on the fire - knowing full well that to say it would definitely get a rise out of Sherlock, so he was smiling when he said loudly, “…And besides, you were wrong about it anyway!”
he continued fiercely, pointing at Sherlock, “You’re like a machine - you never feel anything about anything! All you do is…deduce stuff about people!" John was well aware he sounded like a total idiot, but he was embarrassed, and he was angry at being made to feel that way.
he thought.
, in equally big letters. Nothing else.
Despite his self-flagellation about all the teenage gasping, Mycroft nearly stopped breathing altogether at that.
Sherlock smiled. He didn’t need to say,

Sometimes Sherlock looked at John secretly, when he was busy not noticing Sherlock, and Sherlock would see the folds and creases and lines on John's face deepen as he frowned at something he was doing, or thinking about, and Sherlock found he wanted to soften them by making John look up at him and smile. Or even laugh. And John's laugh was a thing of beauty indeed. John's laugh was precious and so deeply infectious. Hearing it often made Sherlock laugh. And that was a pretty rare occurrence. To put it in perspective, before John had come along, he had very seldom laughed at all. Before John had come along, there had been very little laughter in Sherlock's life. There had mainly just been getting high. Scoring the drugs and getting high and then the slippery roller-coaster of descent down into the big black hole of oblivion…only to have to crawl back up again eventually. The cocaine brought with it the gift of frantically excessive creativity and an insanely increased speed of thought, but as its thrill deserted him, the speed and depth of the drop was a terribly high price to pay.
Sherlock made his own face blank and stared back at him and then John tipped his head sideways, rolled his eyes and blew a bit of air out through his mouth, as if to say,
"Go back to bed, John," Sherlock said, turning his head again to look back out of the window and sipping his coffee.
This was becoming farcical.
“Essex, apparently,” replied Sherlock, glancing sideways at John, and John knew he was impressed. John couldn't help his quiet glow of pride.
For Sherlock though, it was slow, it made a lot of noise, the seats were upholstered in cheap, rough, velveteen fabric that had seen much better days...
He had thought he knew precisely how he would react to, in, and from certain situations, and he knew how he ticked. But recent events had proved this not quite to be the case, and now he needed to think about why.
Mycroft, in his heated up state, could truly not tell if Greg meant to tease him or if he was still unsure whether it was permissible to use the word that he been using so freely for the last hour in this blunt way.
Sherlock's assailant looked at John, then, possibly picking up on something that John was thinking. There was still blood seeping from the man's nose and one of his eyes was darkening and swelling closed. It looked like Sherlock's elbow had caught him full in the face. He stared back at John with his one good eye. ”What're you lookin' at, short arse?” he said and then he called John a name that would have had John's mother rushing for the soap.
Sherlock froze.
like his Baker Street bedroom in that it wasn’t exactly neat - Sherlock had slept in this room last night after all, so the bed was unmade (nothing new there, thought John) - but the main difference was that the walls were covered with pictures. There were various photographs, paintings and prints; some in frames and some not. There was an small, unframed print of Escher’s ‘Waterfall’ - which was one of his that John quite liked too, funnily enough - and there were quite a few seascapes, including a lino-cut black and white depiction of a three-masted sailing ship in rough seas and with a bright crescent moon overhead, and a glowingly beautiful, ornately framed print of The Fighting Temeraire, by J. M. Turner, the colours of the setting sun in the painting vibrantly bright against the wall.
And then, sometimes, John just sat there - like today - calm and quiet and thoughtful, with his calm, quiet thoughtfulness spreading secretly throughout the flat, permeating every nook and cranny, until it made Sherlock feel calm and quiet and thoughtful by virtue of its soft persistence.
about John. The feeling of
There was a tiny pause and then Sherlock asked, “Are you offering me a massage?” still standing with his back to John, still looking around at him over his shoulder.
"Sometimes you're like an old woman, with your moaning!" John said eventually. And that shut Sherlock right up. Ten minutes later, he asked John abruptly for the poetry book, and then he pretended to read it the rest of the way.
Sherlock had said, feeling his heart break as he said it, and while he respected John's decision, it didn't mean he had to like it. Mary was surprisingly tolerable, he had developed a grudging respect for her, even, but she stood solid and squarely between him and John.
he mumbled softly.
“So I replied, 'Well, he's not going to be there and that's it.' Nicolette was behaving like a petulant child! 'But he
Sherlock looked at them both, each in turn. “I am not four now,” he said clearly, reminding them both to shut up. Then he returned to the task at hand.
There was only one option.
The front and sides of the balcony were made of waist-level thick slats of wood, weathered silvery with age, and they not only let in light to form a striped pattern on the floor, but also offered a good measure of privacy. Just as well, thought Mycroft, as right now Greg was, in full view of anyone who happened to be looking, completely and very visibly nude - his modesty hidden only by the wooden slats. Greg opened the glass balcony door on the left a narrow gap, just about wide enough to reach through and retrieve his lighter from the stool, and once he had it, he stepped back inside the room but left the balcony door ajar.

“Lucky indeed,” agreed Mycroft, his fingers stroking through Greg’s silver hair again, feeling extremely lucky in all sorts of ways.
about John. It was hard to quantify but it was vast and nebulous.
But maybe now was the time to break all the rules. “Of course,” he said smoothly. “Only not too much…It’s my favourite.” He lifted an eyebrow and smiled.

he snapped impatiently, letting go, and John obeyed immediately, releasing Sherlock and rising up with difficulty to kneel awkwardly between Sherlock's endless legs and unbutton his shirt as quickly as he could. As he did so, he stared down at the sultry and seductive mess that Sherlock had become.
“I wouldn't have thought so...” replied Mycroft, as Greg took it, tapping the ash off into the beer can. Which brought him onto something which had been playing on his mind, rather. “...So when did you actually make the booking?” he asked, intrigued. “You must have been …erm….
it whispered conspiratorially.
like John thought he was. The photographs that Mycroft sent through to him - at personal great risk to himself, for were that fact to be discovered, Mycroft's actions would have been answerable to at the very highest levels - those few snatched photographs only served to make Sherlock suffer more. John wasn't getting on with his life, John was irreparably broken, grieving, and was not mending. The pain that Sherlock felt when he saw the photographs was quite surprising at first, and then it became indescribable. He hadn't realised he would feel…
Mycroft moaned loudly and instantly.
John had spotted his own name first at the end, and then went round the table to see who was opposite and where everyone else was.
to go through and say hello, and so he shrugged and got up to go and meet her alone.
thought Greg, watching Mycroft crack the caramel surface delicately, and his long, pale fingers on the silver spoon as he removed individual shards of caramel and thin slivers of creme brûlée from the dish, one at a time.
Anthea smiled. “Of course, sir,” she said. “I’ll leave you to it,” and she left the room.
"I must say, John, you seem very worried. It's only a flesh wound - its not like it's anything vital. It's not like its my heart."
and then he addressed the other police officers present by remarking, ‘…and you fucking useless
Mycroft shoved the covers down to give himself a bit of space and Greg threw his head back on the pillows as Mycroft went to work. “Oh!” Greg said.
Lucia muttered under her breath, and then called back loudly, “Have you looked in the nut box?”

it. He had to do this one thing for John. For them all. And it had to work.
“But I didn’t, John,” said Sherlock, softly, reading John’s mind, “and I’m here now…with you,” and he brought John’s fingers up to his lips and kissed them.
“Or you could just get it yourself?” suggested John, but he wasn't angry, just bemused. He paused. “Actually, you can unpack everything,” he said, “I just need to pop out again.”
- what's happened?" he asked in concern, getting up from the desk, all his irritation at Sherlock's disturbance vanished.
Maybe he couldn't say that yet, and maybe neither could Sherlock, but their words earlier had made their feelings clear enough. And now, still held in each other's arms, their bodies began to speak to each other too.
she exclaimed excitedly about the chocs. She did a lot of exclaiming, as well as thigh slapping too, John had noticed. She finished her exaggerated stirring in the teapot and clapped the lid on, bringing it to the table. “I did! And I remembered your After Eights too, don’t worry…” then she flapped a hand at Mycroft. “Oh, do you remember - you loved those too, didn’t you Mycroft?” then she said “John!—” loudly and excitedly, making him look up - she’d clearly remembered a funny story, “—After Eights were always Siger and Mycroft’s favourites, and Mycroft had told little Sherlock he wasn’t allowed to eat them - he was only about two! He came in here one Christmas Eve all upset and when I asked him why, he said he’d wanted to try the special after dinner chocolates but Mycroft had told him you could only eat them after eight o’clock at night, and that was his bedtime - so Mycroft had been very firm that that meant he couldn’t have
John knew he had never read that book in front of Sherlock, but hearing him describe that image of John reading it was so accurate, it was as if he had sat there and watched John do it.
she said, then added. “Ooh! You do make these so
Then he jumped to his feet. "Because you were
Greg bubbled up with laughter at that, just as Mycroft had planned, and he caught hold of Greg while he was off-guard and laughing, and in an perfectly executed manoeuvre which resembled a dance step, guided him backwards, turning him quickly as he did so in a very tightly controlled way to spin him around and press Greg’s lovely behind further along the worktop, against the wide white edge of the vintage butler’s sink. Now their positions were switched and Mycroft was in the driving seat; much in the position that Greg had been a moment ago, standing with his feet on either side of Greg’s. “My turn to show
Almost immediately, there was a sound of clattering and rummaging and then Siger called back triumphantly, “Aha! I knew they were in there!”
“Hey Sherlock, where do you keep plates?”
“Good deduction.” John glanced at the detective as he spoke. “Was it the cologne that told you that?”
Just seconds later, another ping.
"I'm sorry, you are?"
“I assumed you would. Please call me Sherlock, this “Mr. Holmes” thing is really too much.”
“Yes this is Dr. Watson in room 2112, I need a warm blanket immediately. Thanks.”  He placed the phone on the receiver and turned his attention back to Sherlock, who was now staring right at him.
Dr. Watson nodded, “That’s correct. If he wasn’t found when he was, he probably would have died. I also cleaned up a few fresh gashes on his wrist; they appeared to have been self-inflicted. I was unable to determine whether the overdose was intentional or not. I advise that he go to a rehabilitation clinic and/or consult a therapist. I can bring you some information if you’d like.”
“Yes, I’m his brother, Mycroft Holmes. I was told he was hospitalized for an overdose earlier this morning.”
“Hello, I’m Dr. Watson, I’m Mr. Holmes’ attending physician. Are you his next of kin?”
221 B was just a short walk from the Baker Street tube station. He noticed a vivid red awning for a sandwich shop next door. Must be nice to have that just outside the front door. His attention switched to the black door of 221B which strongly contrasted the red awning of the shop next door. There were large, brass numbers and a knocker on the door; the knocker was slightly askew. He grabbed the crooked knocker and rapped hard on the door. Moments later, an older woman he did not know answered.
“There was a triple homicide, a young child and both her parents. It was not as grizzly as it sounds, they were each shot once and likely all died instantaneously from their wounds. However, the police were stumped about who could have committed the crime. Detective Inspector Lestrade, who I work with the most, interviewed the family and the few friends that they had and each story was more wild than the other. The male victim had contacted the police because he was afraid his father would kill him, yet the father was in a nursing home on the brink of death. He passed away before I could speak with him. One of their friends stated that they were paranoid lately and believed their flat was haunted. Another friend said she thought they started using hallucinogenic drugs. The mother of the female victim said they were having financial issues and there was no way they were using drugs or that their flat was haunted. The flat was searched and there were no signs of drug usage or ghosts, obviously, but I found a lot of religious pamphlets. These pamphlets seemed to come from the same place. I asked if anyone was aware of their religious affiliation and where they attended services, and only the female victim's mother knew about this. They had recently started going to a church after chatting to a woman who handed out the pamphlets. Apparently the woman was really kind and welcoming, but after a few months of attending services, they realized that the church was a cult and the charismatic woman was chosen to talk to strangers and lure them in. The family was having problems leaving the cult and considered moving away to distance themselves from it. The only reason the victim's mother knew about this was because one of the cult’s leaders called her and made a threat. I knew that it was obviously the cult who orchestrated the crime, whether they did it themselves or hired a hitman, so I gave this information to Lestrade who ordered a raid. When the first officer entered the building, he heard them talking about the victims and how easy it was to take care of them. They were all promptly arrested, and when threatened with being charged with accessory to murder, almost everyone sang like canaries. The leader of the cult planned the homicide and his two assistants were stalking the victims and told the leader when to strike.”

“Call me John, and if you would like a companion, I’ll be yours. Honestly, friends are few since I’ve been away so long. It would be nice to find someone to talk to.” Sherlock shook his hand.
“Hi Sherlock. Glad to see you’re doing better.” John walked over to the detective and Sherlock turned to face him.
“Sherlock.”
John laughed heartily. “So, your brother’s hooking up with M?” Sherlock looked puzzled at John’s comment.
“Close the damn curtains, it’s way too bright in here.”
Sherlock smiled briefly. “I like to keep busy. I post all of my reports on my website.”
“Not offended, just impressed.”
Pippa and the other dogs were sniffing each other excitedly. Sherlock smiled and knelt down to pet the other dogs. “I love dogs. Are they yours, or are you employed as a walker?”
"May I help you?"
“Well, that much I figured. Any pain? Nausea? Diarrhea?”
“John, one of my best cases happened outside of London, near Sussex, where I grew up. In a small village, a man was murdered in front of a dozen people, yet no one would say who committed the crime. Everyone refused to speak to the police, they all requested a solicitor, and I was called in to assist. I had to do a bit of undercover work for this one so the villagers would talk to me, so I pretended to be a reporter for a university newspaper. The villagers began telling me about the victim and how awful he was. The victim had assaulted an elderly grocer the week prior to his murder. The victim had also started a “relationship" with an underage girl and she fell pregnant. Her family called the police, and the victim tried to burn their house down. The villagers called him a bully and a menace. I heard countless stories of the victim stalking, assaulting, and threatening his fellow villagers. He also had targeted underage teenage girls for “relationships.” Finally, I spoke with the pregnant girl's father, and he said he witnessed the murder and that the victim had started a fight with him and broke his nose. I talked to the police after doing all of my interviews and they told me that he was shot once with a hunting rifle. I remembered seeing a hunting rifle at the home of the pregnant girl. Of course, I knew what had happened, but the victim had it coming, so I told the police that I was only told awful stories about the victim and no one would speak of the murder. I refused to send that man to prison for doing that village a huge favor.”
“You know, James Bond. M.” Sherlock stared blankly at him. John couldn’t help but laugh. “You don’t know James Bond?”
“That sounds really fun, I’m just surprised, is all. I do have a busy schedule at the hospital, but when I’m not working, I can definitely give you a hand.” He smiled at Sherlock. Sherlock closed his eyes once more and smiled back.
“No need, you are the best patient I’ve had here.”
“How long did it take you to solve the case?”
John, put down your gun. You cannot kill yourself because I didn’t kill myself. If you give me the chance, I’ll explain everything. Tell me where you are.
“This is Baker Street. Change for the Bakerloo, Jubilee, and Metropolitan lines.”
John chuckled, “It’s Dr. Watson, actually, I was a doctor in the Army. I was shot in my left shoulder, so I cannot perform surgery anymore.”
“Your hair, posture, and tan.”
John smiled at him and stood up, his dogs getting restless. “I have to continue with my walk or I’ll never get the dogs back home on time. Care to walk with me?”
Sherlock lifted a layer of blankets to reveal his mobile. He peered at the screen briefly. “John, the food is here, can you go down and grab it?”
Sherlock hobbled into the kitchen, still wrapped in a fluffy blanket.
The handsome man reached in his pocket and pulled out a business card, handing it to Sherlock. “My flat would never allow me to have a dog, so I walk them.”
Sherlock Holmes:
“Depends really, there’s a chance that he is still a suicide risk and we try to keep any suicide risk in the hospital where they can be supervised at all times. However, if he is well enough to leave, he is an adult, and we cannot force him to stay if he wants to leave.”
“Okay, recovering drug addict. Is that better?”
“MI6?!”
“Assist you?”
I know I’ve lost my mind, now. I’m at Baker Street, I never left.
Pippa understood and sat at Sherlock’s feet, nudging them with her nose. Sherlock patted her head, “Good girl, now let me put your collar and leash on.”
John reached in the cupboard and grabbed some plates, setting the table for them. He dug in the takeaway bags and divvied up the food. The smell was wonderful.

“Mentioning my brother will cause nausea, this isn’t about me, this is my deduction of you. Simply asking for another deduction is proof enough, you have other patients, but you’re here, talking to me. You could have just left after calling for a blanket, but you hung around. They are likely very dull cases anyways. One of your patients is elderly, by the way, nursing homes have a very distinct odor, tends to linger. I am entertaining you, I make smart remarks and tell you things you already know about yourself, but are intrigued to hear from another person. You said you had few friends, so you likely spend a lot of time at your flat alone. The telly gets dull after a while, so why not hang out with the suicidal, druggie detective from the hospital.”

“Cold.”
“Will do.”
“Your limp is psychosomatic; you don’t really need that cane.”
“Thank you, John.”
“Ah sorry, Mr. Holmes.” He rushed to shut the curtains back up. “How are you feeling?”
Dr. Watson didn’t know how to properly react and he left the room. He couldn’t believe that guy knew all of that. People stared as he muttered to himself in the hallway. He stopped at a computer to enter information into the man’s chart. The entire time he was typing, he was thinking about what a bloody genius that man was. He was blunt, too. He probably didn’t have many friends because of that. He suddenly remembered what that man’s brother had said about needing company. He hurried back to the room, knocking before entering once again.
Today was the day.
“John.”
"Hi, I'm here to see Sherlock Holmes. I have the right address, don't I?"
Today was different; today, he was getting a dog.
Sherlock read over the business card that said “John Watson will walk any dog, anytime, anywhere. To inquire, call 01632 960816.”
"Mrs. Hudson, I'm the landlady."
Dr. Watson smiled. “Well, they are brilliant, Sherlock. You’d have to be a fool not to think so.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s John, still up for takeaway?
“Of course, Sherlock. I'm not going anywhere.”
“I'm chuffed to hear another case. I haven't had this much excitement in a long time.”
Mrs. Hudson pointed up, "His is the only upstairs flat. Go on up."
Mycroft shook his head. “Thank you Doctor, but I already have some information for him. This isn’t his first time doing this as you probably know from his records.” Dr. Watson nodded at the man’s comment. “He’s not a happy man, so I’m quite sure this was a suicide attempt.”
“Come.”
John stood up and held his hand out for Sherlock.
“You have your own website?” John sat down across from Sherlock again.
“Certainly, Sherlock.” Dr. Watson smiled.
John took it, reading it out loud. “Sherlock Holmes, the World’s Only Consulting Detective. thescienceofdeduction.co.uk. What is a consulting detective?”
“You weren't kidding when you said ‘be careful,’ Sherlock.”
“Well hello there!” The dog walker called out as knelt to the ground to greet Pippa. His dogs all sat in front of him, trying to get a closer look at Pippa. Sherlock sped up to stop Pippa from tugging too hard on her leash.
“Better it be adrenaline than it be narcotics.”
“There are a lot of foolish people in this world.” Sherlock grinned, and John chuckled and held out his hand.
The voice was all too familiar. He turned around and knew immediately that it was him, even though he looked a little different.
Sherlock pointed in the direction of the kitchen. “I apologize for the mess, but there's a table in there. Do be careful with my equipment.”
“Oh I woke up when he kissed me. I need disinfectant for that by the way. I didn’t open my eyes because I didn’t feel like talking to him. I still smell him in this room; he needs to lay off the cologne.”
“Thank you, that will be all.” She nodded and left the room. John unfolded the blanket and covered Sherlock with it. Sherlock adjusted the blanket to his liking, and John pulled up a chair and sat down by him.
Sherlock smiled at him, “Thank you. I was hoping not to offend you in any way.”
He put the gun on the bedside table and waited for a response. He must be dreaming, or insane, maybe both.
There was no way. He was delusional. A dead man texted him, he really lost his mind. He felt compelled to respond, though.
Sherlock hummed in agreement and collected his blanket bundle and slowly walked over to his chair, curling up in a ball and cocooning himself in more blankets.
“I'm not really that hungry anyway. Can you put my food away? Be careful in the fridge, I have experiments in there.”
"Home?" John suggested practically.
He said Mycroft’s name repeatedly, and moaned and gasped and groaned with pleasure. Mycroft’s ears were filled with the sound of him; his dark throaty voice, the swearing, his moans and sighs. The taste and smell of him were equally divine; by turns musky, salty and dark. It was very easy to get carried away.
unlike him it was to be unsure whether to voice an opinion or not - brazen or otherwise, he thought. And now he could feel his damned ears going pink again. “What else do you like?” he asked suddenly, as Greg passed him his second drink, desperate to know.
Greg sat up a bit and held out one hand to Mycroft. “Come over ‘ere…” he said, inclining his head over to the bed behind him, his voice soft, rumbling and enticing.
of course, there was the fact that John had also shot a serial killer to save Sherlock. Well, he thought that was what he had done - obviously Sherlock knew he had chosen the right pill, so he wouldn't actually have been poisoned and died, but still - John had thought he was shooting a serial murderer to stop Sherlock from becoming his next victim - so, more precisely then, he’d done it specifically to save Sherlock's life, and who else would have done that?
from Greg, it’s from me.” He scrubbed his face with his hands and yawned and stretched a bit to wake up properly.
pissed-off-John-ness. Sherlock was lying down again, but he rolled over onto his side to face John and came up on one elbow to look at what ‘this’ might be.
or a…
and, Oh! What a surprise! The approximate time of death coincided with the time of the thunderstorm!…and etcetera, etcetera, etcetera;
Sherlock grinned wolfishly, his eyes alight and fixed on John. He reached down and adjusted himself discretely through his trousers. “Oh. Well, that certainly works for me,” he said agreeably, still grinning, and then he added, “I’ll see you up there,” and he started to get up.
Here he was. He had come back to Baker Street. But really, it felt like finding his way home.
were two entirely different things. Greg didn’t take his eyes away from Mycroft’s and there was absolutely no way Mycroft could tear his gaze from Greg’s. His erect penis was nearly touching Greg’s face.

"I need to see properly, can you take your shirt off?" John asked, matter of factly. "And you need to turn around so your back's to the window - I need to have good light. It’s so bloody dark in here."
And he was the first man that John had shared a shower cubicle with that was really only meant for one person. But for all of these reasons combined, it was the most memorable shower that John had ever had. At least,
“Water?” asked Sherlock randomly, proffering the huge decorative glass jug that happened to have been placed near his elbow. He lifted his eyebrows at John in question while holding the jug.
Mycroft thought suddenly, randomly, as he took his next step into the room, closer to the source of the dimmed light and to Greg on the bed. Greg twisted around and pushed up on his arms to swivel his body and turn to bring his legs over to sit up on the edge of the bed. He’d been looking at his phone as Mycroft had walked in, and now as he sat up, he put it to sleep and tossed it lightly onto the pile of GQ magazines stacked up on the nearest bedside cabinet. “Sorry!” he said, sheepishly, meaning being on the phone. “My sergeant just texted me…”
(See the end of the chapter for
To deduce it properly.
"I did."
Mycroft nearly faltered at that but he also saw a perfect opportunity here to get his own back. He upped the ante on his Upper Crust accent and purred in a low, deep rumble, “Oh dear. Did you not hear me very well? Perhaps I wasn’t clear enough?” He paused for a long time, letting the sexual tension build incrementally; while Greg waited, unmoving, and then he growled,
When Mycroft came to pull him from the Serbian hell hole, twittering gaily in his ear that he was 'back to Baker Street', the pain of the beating he had just received faded into insignificance. He had smiled. Actually smiled for the first time in what felt like months, despite the pain he was in at the time. Oh, the pain was present, it was still agonisingly real and
Agatha turned to include John in the conversation again. “So you’re all down from London!” she said, reaching for her nearly full sherry glass behind her on the table. He had just started to tell her yes, that was right, when there came the clear (and somewhat embarrassing) sound of lowered voices having a minor disagreement from the sitting room and Siger instinctively raised his own voice to cover it. “Sherry, John?” he asked over-loudly, gesturing with the open bottle and an empty glass. “It’s got a lovely bouquet! Have a sniff!”
John burst out laughing; delighted, warmed, genuinely absolutely charmed. “Oh, that’s…so lovely,” he said sincerely,
with him.
John, surprised, looked over and saw a large piece of white card face down next to the Persian dagger that was currently stabbed into the latest electricity bill. The piece of card definitely hadn’t been there when he’d left. He snorted. “What’s this?” he said, going over to it.
get off your phone, darling!’ He must have been washing those bowls very quietly, John realised, as there was no sound of it happening. At Lucia's words, however, there was immediately a loud metallic clattering from the downstairs loo sink and the sound of scrubbing and rinsing, and then Siger called back, “I’m done!”
they actually just said to each other?
Where was his dignity, he wondered.
As he was pondering this, something rubbed firmly against his lower leg. He jumped and looked down to see. “Oh! There’s a cat!” he said, surprised at its sudden appearance, and he reached down to stroke it.
"Actually," said Sherlock, and he glanced at his watch, "I suppose I'd better let Lestrade know he needs to get something out of the freezer."
As they cleaned up, Greg said, “Christ, I really need a drink…” and then hastened to add, “…of water, I mean!” But the subject of drink had jogged his memory. “Hey, we left our whisky downstairs - did yer still want yours?”
“Oh, they were so terrible to each other, John,” said Lucia. She waved her arm in excitement. “Sigs, tell John about the time when—” at that moment, Sherlock stood up abruptly, his potatoes completed.
“Ecstatic,” replied Sherlock dully, who was resting his chin on one hand and still looking down at Mycroft’s newspaper as he idly turned the page. Then he sat up suddenly, slamming the hand that had been supporting his chin down on the table with a sudden bang. “Why can’t we have a nice murder over Christmas?” he asked the room in general, beginning to flick the remaining pages over violently in irritation until he got to the last one. “Just the one would be nice…” he added sulkily, as he closed the paper and pushed it grumpily aside.
a little voice in Sherlock’s head said. He agreed with it and admired the darkening marks all over John’s neck.
“What happened?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock pounced on it pulling the device out of the sack and examining it closely.
“And by the time I figured out I was in love with you I was too late and I was happy to stand aside because I want you to be happy. That’s all I want, is for you to be happy.”
They tried again, turning so the spray hit both of them but it washed whatever they tried to use as lube down the drain.
John looked exhausted.
Manoeuvring onto one knee Sherlock knelt before John and opened a ring box. Inside was the ring John had picked out. “And you’re an essential part of it.”
“But if you were locked away I would have to behave.”
It was a dream come true.
Sherlock hissed angerly.
“What did you find out?”
“Sorry,” John said. “Too rough, how’s this?”
This seemed to upset Sherlock and he fell back into his seat with a huff.
He closed his eyes and focused on the sensation.
“Aarguh!” Bill shouted as he came, buried deep. John was waiting and once Bill bottomed he shoved his cock all the way down Sherlock’s throat. The sensation of being impaled on both ends nearly made him come. He was so close!
With a noise of displeasure, Sherlock brought his arm back to John’s chest, tightening his grip and pressing his whole body against John’s briefly. Just long enough to make it clear that John wasn’t to go anywhere.
“Here, I’ll take care of the laundry,” John said, picking up the bathroom floor. Sherlock used toilet tissue to clean the worst off his face and then washed the rest off.
Sherlock was excited. He clapped his hands together.
Sherlock sawed at his violin for a few hours and shouted at the idiots on the telly for a few more. Then he got really bored.
“Why don’t you just apologize. I’m sure she’ll drop the charges if you just—”
John looked at Sherlock sharply. Was he serious? He couldn’t be. There was a
He kept looking down at John, smiling smugly whenever he caught John adjusting himself. Since the pavement was empty John started doing it just to see that expression. Sherlock was preening and John thought he deserved to be.
John didn’t remember much of what had come after. Thank god Molly had come for Rosie. John felt bad for making her hand the note to Sherlock.
John took the ring and slid it onto his own finger. He frowned when it stopped before the second knuckle.
“Aaah! Sher—! I’m--! Nnguh!” John came, the effort of keeping still made his whole body shake and he was grateful for Sherlock’s hand on his hip as his knees went weak.
At that question, Sherlock’s eyes lit up and John realized that sometime soon he’d be experiment fodder. This was one experiment he didn’t mind participating in.
If he was in the military why was he getting married? Weren’t subs in the military like him, married to their work? Sherlock didn’t know and he disliked not knowing. He was eager for the ceremony to start now so he could see his sub and deduce everything himself.
John sat in Sherlock’s lap, straddling his legs while he recaptured his lips.
John wondered why Mrs Hudson had never remarried.
“John? Come back to bed.”
When Sherlock’s hips finally stilled John kissed him. A peck, a small nibble of that perfect cupid’s bow softened with a lick.
That seemed to surprise Sholto, as Sherlock suspected it would. He straightened his posture into something more professional and said, “Oh, Mr Holmes, we weren’t expecting you personally—”
Sherlock smirked and started putting plasters over the deeper lacerations and bites.
“God, no,” John whispered.
“What?”
It took John a moment to process Sherlock’s lips against his own. He’d hoped for this outcome, but he hadn’t really believed it would happen.
“You had your tongue up there, of course, a finger fits,” Sherlock said with a snorting giggle.
the cabbie commanded John as he got out of the car.
He tapped his foot and fumed silently on the quiet street.
“It’s time, Sherlock, beg me. Do a proper job of it.”
And sexually frustrated. Apparently, Sherlock didn’t eat on cases and neither did he have sex. Though, the last one, at least, was probably accurate.
“You’re right, he does have a date. He cancels all of his meetings when I’m in hospital, except when it’s with this woman. He also had an obnoxious amount of cologne on, Clive Christian No. 1to be exact, it’s the most expensive cologne in the world. He’s being wasteful and overdoing it, ironic considering it’s meant to be an understated cologne. I’m sure he forgot to have his coat laundered this week so he spritzed his coat as well. Silly of him, really, but my brother is a strange creature. I can still smell her perfume on his coat, though. Claire De La Lune is a bit young for her, my brother prefers mature women, but to each their own, I suppose. Honestly, I cannot go on anymore, I am now nauseous.”
Sherlock rubbed at his eyes, hands shaky, “Couple of hours. My hands have been shaking, mind racing, and I'm tired, but I cannot fall asleep.”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“No… should I?”
“Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. How long had the police been working the case before they consulted you?”
John chuckled at that last comment. “You like wearing disguises?”
“I recently did a study of tobacco ash. It's rather long, but I really enjoyed studying it. I find that it may be useful to the police someday.”
“Oh, forgot to mention, my brother is the government, he’s messing around with the woman who runs MI6.”
“Thank you for putting this together, John.”
John found himself thinking about Sherlock the entire time he was doing his rounds. He had no idea why he had agreed to be this guy’s friend or go to his flat, but it sounded a lot better than what he had been doing most nights. Sherlock had been right, he was a lonely man. He wanted nothing more than to have someone to spend time with that didn’t pity him for being a crippled war veteran. A real friend sounded like a nice break from the norm.
