John looked up at him and this time Sherlock could see the brittleness around his eyes. His own features softened in response. “I don’t think denial is going to work, John.”
When he finally came to his senses, John was sprawled on top of him, face pressed to Sherlock's throat, hot puffs of air against his skin with each breath John took, Sherlock's hands tracing soothing patterns on his back. He realised he was trembling, his heart beating too quickly in his chest.
"Lestrade," John clarified. "Called me and asked to meet with me after he left you in Mrs Hudson's care. He wanted to ask how much I knew about this marriage of yours, wanted some advice. Told me about your text and how he had found you and that you ...” He swallowed. “... that you loved your husband. And before I knew it, I told him the entire story. I honestly didn't have a single clue until he told me."
If anything, John had seemed amused by the revelation, however, so Sherlock hoped it had not done any lasting damage to their friendship. After all, it was a purely academic preference and not something he ever put into practice. At least that was what he liked to think, but he could not guarantee to hold firm to that decision if John ever decided to test his limits.
"If it helps, I had hoped to come back sooner and for our reunion to be a happier occasion." Sherlock found himself fiddling with his coat, unable to look at John's face.
"Clever," John murmured appreciatively. "How long do you think they will take to get back to you?"
His phone buzzed in his pocket and he pulled it out to glance at the screen. "Come on, then. It seems Lestrade has the info I asked him about. Let's go to the Yard and solve this case."
Weronikia Walczak, who had joined their group along with her husband some minutes ago, leaned forward with a conspiratory whisper. "I heard the boy was killed by someone in a fight over money. A young man of his age and with his job, how could he have gotten the money for an expensive watch and an engagement ring? There's something fishy there."
Under John's watchful eyes, Sherlock had been brooding over the print-outs, writing notes into the margins and doing complex calculations in his head or - in some special cases - on paper, using formulas John could not remember ever hearing about in school.
"For you to sign the papers," John said, because there was no other way of putting it. He couldn't quite bring himself to look at Sherlock as he spoke. "We've clearly managed to save our friendship and I'm sure as hell not going anywhere. You've already promised the same. And Mary is getting impatient, to tell you the truth. We were hoping for a summer wedding so we could make the most of the British weather and time is sort of running out."
For the longest moment, John had no idea what to do. Ignore it? Not possible. Sherlock was too tightly wound for this to end in anything but disaster if John tried to pretend it wasn’t happening. And if Sherlock were to wake up now ...
“Sorry,” he croaked, as if there was anything he needed to apologise for.
*****
"Always," John murmured, and started carding his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
"Oh, poor John!" Mrs Hudson exclaims. "That woman was no good for him anyway, but what a terrible shock it must have been."
There had been nothing soft or hesitant about Sherlock's actions, nothing even close to the way he had conducted any of their experiments in touch. So. Not an experiment, then. It made his heart squeeze painfully in his chest. Sherlock had walked in, taken one look at him and all but lunged at him as if he couldn't possibly hold back for even another moment. That had to mean something and John would be damned if he didn't find out exactly what.
Sherlock waited for him to disappear down the hallway and then ducked behind the desk as voices came from the dining hall - the other guests leaving and heading for the lounge.
John shot her a grateful look. "That would be fantastic. I'll talk to the alpha, too, if they insist. Just let me know where and when and I'll try to be there." He glanced at Sherlock. "Unless something unexpected comes up, like a new case or something, I'm usually quite flexible with my time."
. An utter moron. An imbecile.
If this was what Sherlock had based his conclusion on, then John could not help but agree with him. No one in their right mind could possibly read this and think John wanted to so much as look at Sherlock ever again.
Some of you expressed an interest in seeing more of this world, so I'm sure you will be happy to hear that I will in fact be writing a sequel to this. I haven't started yet but I do have some ideas that I hope to turn into an actual story soon. With the way NaNoWriMo has been going for me (I'm at 72k), I might write part of it before the month is over.
He woke at half past eight and stumbled down the stairs and into the bathroom with a muttered "G' morning" towards his flatmate, who grunted a greeting and promptly flicked on the kettle so the tea would be ready by the time John wanted some.
Two steps brought him to the bed and his hand to Sherlock's forehead. "Shit shit shit."
Of course, all of his idle musings on the subject were quickly suspended by John bounding into his bedroom, tail wagging back and forth like a flag in the hands of an overly enthusiastic football fan.
John smiled. "You smell angry."
"That doesn't make any sense," Sherlock said, more to himself than to John. "There were no hints of anyone having a skin condition, Mrs Forsythe mentioned nothing about a rash or anything of the sort, and Molly hasn't dug up anything relating to one either. So what was the son doing with skin powder?"
John wished he could speak so he could point out that Sherlock himself had a terrible track record of throwing away anything and clearly didn't care about waste separation. Since he couldn't, he simply lay there, his head on the armrest of his chair, his injured paw on the edge of the seat, and watched as Sherlock paced and ranted.
Sherlock shrugged. "I prefer to have some advance warning. Logically, when encountering a large wildcat in one's sitting room, anyone not used to changelings is going to be startled. Knowing what type of cat you are will help me distinguish you from a more dangerous predator who might be there for reasons other than a warm spot by the fire."
For example, there was the first time Sherlock walked through the door that very day and Rosie shrieked "Pa!" and threw herself at him before he had a chance to even put down his bag. He dropped to his knees and held her in his arms for longer than he thought should be allowed but he couldn't make himself let go and she was clinging to him just as tightly, saying "You're back!" with so much delight that Sherlock actually started to cry because he really was.
"When do you want to leave?," he asked, trying to squash his disappointment.
Sherlock shrugged. "I was honestly too surprised to question your motives. And you were right. It did make sense. I hadn't realised at the time how desperately I
And John says: "I love you, too."
John nodded. "Okay then. Is there anything in particular you want me to pay attention to?"
It took John a moment to identify which of the rocks on display Sherlock meant and then he began to laugh.
But what if John had thought to question why everyone was so very convinced they are a couple?
Sherlock smiled. "Perhaps you'll be lucky and we'll get the chance to have a good run through the city soon, then. It's too early to make any promises, though. Lestrade still hasn't gotten back to me about the origin and identity of the baby, so we will have to wait for the Yarders to do their jobs to the best of their limited abilities."
*****
"Do we have audio of this?"
John shook his head in frustration. "It doesn't help you, though. You still can't drop out. Unless ... what about Molly?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Yes, people are idiots. Nothing new there. Well, perhaps someone did feel inspired.”
"Do you expect me to wear this instead?" John demanded, plucking at the edge of the lab coat he wore wrapped around himself like a very unusual dressing gown.
It had been five months since he had moved into Baker Street and so far, everything had been going fine.
After that came what felt like an entire questionnaire, specifically designed to be answerable with clear 'yes' or 'no' options - or in this case, whuff or growl.
He rolled his hips before Sherlock could open his mouth and let his rational mind ruin the moment for them and Sherlock's head dropped back, a sharp moan spilling from those lips. "Oh, oh god, John!"
"Well, I guess this is going to be all over the Yard before the day is over," John sighed.
"Why would I?" Sherlock asked quietly, dropping his gaze. "You were already doing enough denying for the both of us."
So far he had not gotten the chance to inform John that the flash drive in question was of the water-resistant kind and the data stored on it had thus been saved from otherwise certain destruction. Which was largely thanks to his quick reaction, consisting of shedding his coat and jumping head-first into the cold water the moment the thief had thrown it in there.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I haven't spoken to him yet," Lestrade said. "Just wanted to give you an update. He's getting his rights formally read to him right now and then I'll go in. I'll call again when I'm done. Don't come to the Yard. I mean it, Sherlock. There's nothing you can do here."
Sherlock shook his head. "Let's not draw attention to ourselves. They likely haven't heard of us and wouldn't believe our story. We can argue the lack of footprints leading from us to the goat but on one previous occasion it was burned down by people firing flaming arrows at it, so I'd recommend not to chance it."
"What?"
Sherlock gave her a look. "I am here because otherwise there would be no conversation happening, Sally."
"No, that was Dimmock's foot you stepped on," Sherlock corrected him absently. "But you snatched the last ham and cheese sandwich right from under Donovan's hand, so you're definitely even."
Sherlock very nearly fell to his knees again.
He looks calm, almost blasé, but it doesn't escape her notice that his gaze keeps flickering to John, as if to check he's still there. As if to reassure himself he didn't imagine his presence.
"Must they? He just got hired to do the wedding photography and then the bride was murdered. I suppose some odd behaviour was expected. But we do not know the details yet - I'm sure he will tell Lestrade everything. And he promised he'd talk to the man and see if he'd be willing to talk to you. I suppose there are some questions you would like to ask, or things you want to say."
John tilted his head the other way, clearly questioning his reasoning.
"Oh god," John groaned. "Please tell me you remembered to actually make a booking."
The radio crackles again with more information.
His friend shakes his head. "No. I'm missing information."
Sherlock dared to glance up and found John staring at him with a look of absolute bafflement on his face.
And John was murmuring things to him, gentle, soft words that bypassed Sherlock's brain entirely and went straight to his core. It didn't matter what John was saying so long as he didn't stop talking, constant evidence that he was there.
Cursing inwardly, John pulled it out of his pocket. Mary's face lit up the screen but just then he found it hard to be pleased to hear from his fiancée. If only she had waited another five or ten minutes, he might have learned more.
"-with the fact that you are telekinetic," John finished for him.
Lestrade gave a low whistle. "That's half a million motives for murder right there. I'll have our accountants go over the files with a fine tooth comb. Do you have any idea who could have done it?"
"What?"
And suddenly, hot tears burned in John’s eyes and his throat was painfully tight. His fingers clenched around the fabric of Sherlock’s threadbare t-shirt and he finally started to cry.
tell me we aren't going to burn down the goat."
To stave off boredom, Sherlock started up a new experiment that was best conducted in the cool environment of 221c, not least of all because he had chosen to concoct an effective mould remover. He didn't say it out loud and John didn't comment on it, but they both knew it was mostly an excuse to give them both some space. Cooped up in the flat with nothing to do, things might escalate more quickly than either of them was really comfortable with yet. The tension their nightly massages created was already bad enough without them sitting practically on top of each other all day long.
"Good. Time to go them. We've found what we were looking for, let's get to the breaking and entering," Sherlock said hastily and brushed past him, starting to pick his way back to the door.
He pulled his phone out of his pocket just to confirm what Sherlock had already told him - there was no phone reception or internet access to be found here.
They both groaned as he unceremoniously pulled their hips together. Sherlock drew away and dropped his head to pant against John's neck. "Fuck,
Sherlock nodded at her and watched her walk away, wondering if she knew how valuable this favour might turn out to be. Favours were the one type of payment he had learned never to refuse.
"I don't remember that at all," Sherlock murmured. "I don't recall it being Thursday. I know you said you'd come by on Thursday night. I must have lost track of time."
Something tiny and warm sparks in John's chest, a glimmer of some long-forgotten thing he never dared to examine for fear of what it might become if he paid attention to it.
John stared at the paper and crumpled it in his fist. Clearly he and Sherlock would have more to talk about than he had ever thought possible.
By the end of their discussion, Molly looks determined. "Our boys are in real trouble this time. I suppose we should get them out of it."
John whuffed at him.
After, they lay tangled together in a sweaty, sticky pile of limbs, unwilling to move as they caught their breath. Sherlock was kissing John's throat and chest and jaw and any inch of skin in between that he could reach, hands stroking up and down his back as if trying to map his body through touch alone. If anyone could do it, it was probably him.
Some minutes later, he could hear two pairs of footsteps approaching and just about managed to pull himself together before Sherlock and Patrick Wiltshire turned the corner. They both startled at the sight of him - or, in Sherlock's case, pretended to - and John forced a stern look on his face.
"Well, I just hope no one starts any riots," Mrs Hudson says, patting her hand. "Do come over for lunch the day after, though."
Another gust of wind carried him through the automatic doors into the shop and he sighed in relief as the warm air hit him.
There was no ring. There was no sign of there ever having been a ring, either. Granted, after two days there would be no noticeable discolouration, but there would be other signs, perhaps a slight reddening from twisting it around and around as John got used to the weight around his finger.
It had also meant that Sherlock had not visited his old landlady in three years because the thought of coming back had hurt enough even without the knowledge that John would be just up the stairs, unaware of his presence and uncaring even if he knew.
Mary hasn't tried again. She simply sits there, poker-faced as the prosecution lays out every single piece of evidence against her. It's overwhelming, really. The list of names of her known victims is scarily long. The list of her aliases that they have found is almost as long.
He raised his gaze and there it was again, that complicated expression on Sherlock's face. It looked a little bit like desperation and hope.
John hadn't, but that was mostly because "coitus" was not the word that had come to his mind and in fact never would so long as the good old "fuck" was around.
He just couldn't seem to let go of the thought, no matter how hard he tried. The longer this continued, the less convinced he was that anything could be done to reverse the effects of his accident in the lab.
“God, Sherlock. What ... what am I going to do?”
"I hope you don't mind me bringing my dog along," he said casually. "We were on our morning walk when I decided to come by."
"In our hotel room, soaking in that massive tub," John told him immediately.
Well, so much for that. "Right, sorry. It's mistletoe, Sherlock."
The week they had spent up in the Highlands, Sherlock swinging back and forth between bouts of euphoria and nostalgia and about one step away from a breakdown as he asked for just one week where they went back to the way it used to be.
"Oh, right." John paused. "I'd love to try some."
Yes, that would definitely go down well.
He’d show him, he promised himself as he drifted off to sleep. He would make sure Sherlock knew.
Either way, John pulled his trousers off along with his shoes and socks, first on one foot, then the other, before reaching for the pile of dry clothes Mycroft had brought and helping his friend redress. Socks, trousers, shoes... By some unspoken agreement, he didn't even suggest that Sherlock take off his wet pants as well, though he definitely should do that the moment they were back at Baker Street. For now, this would do.
Four days passed without anything happening at all.
And life goes on.
"Impressive," Sherlock said, sounding like he meant it. "And very interesting indeed. Your senses will most likely improve further as you continue to adapt to them. We will have to experiment on that, see how far your hearing range goes." Suddenly, he grinned. "This is fantastic! You can spy on Mycroft from all the way across the street!"
John sighed. "This isn't going to work."
He hung up. "That should keep me occupied for a while. If someone has been siphoning money out of that company, I want to know how much. Perhaps we will find some interesting financial activity in the personal accounts of someone working for the company or otherwise related to it. Eventually, there has to be something to lead us to the fraudster."
Yes, that would work. He would grumble and complain and glare at Sherlock and then he would do what he always did, which was to give in and let Sherlock have his way. Particularly because in this instance, Sherlock knew that he had all the right arguments on his side.
That night, Sherlock stayed up late. He went over the notes he had taken on John today, trying to somehow keep the dog separate from the man in his mind as he sifted through the information.
"A gift basket," John repeated tonelessly. "Do I want to know why? Oh, fuck it, of course I do. What did you do?"
He thought about John's hands on his own, a gesture both ridiculously simple and unimaginably dangerous, and wondered about what it would be like to reach out and stroke thick fur, to feel powerful muscles tense and relax under his hand, to learn the shape of tendons and bones through touch alone.
He entered the sitting room to find John sprawled in front of the fire, looking like the picture of domesticity. Wasn't this what everyone wanted? A comfortable home and a dog in front of the fireplace?
But there were others. Psy whose Silence wasn't quite so perfect, who were not yet beyond the reach of emotion. Psy who could, in time, learn to break the Protocol that had been enforced upon them from birth.
"I'm afraid John and I must be on our way now," he said before John could draw attention to his action. "Why don't we meet up for drinks after lunch and continue our conversation? It sounds as if the hotel management has kept us in the dark about quite a big event here. I would like to know the particulars before deciding whether it is indeed safe to stay." To add extra emphasis, he raised his arm so his hand came to rest on the small of John's back - possessive and protective.
Even now, just hearing these words, no matter how casually, made Sherlock a bit weak in the knees.
"But nothing," John tells him, dropping onto the sofa. "Absolutely nothing. I would have had an equally good time going to the Pub with Lestrade or Bill Murray."
John decided to mark that as a win anyway and to not think about the whys and hows too much.
And then everything went black.
“John...”
Sherlock mournfully committed the time in between reaching consciousness and now to memory before opening his mouth to give some sort of reply but John shifted a little and all the air left his lungs because, god, he was so close!
He hesitated. "You ... you never did answer me."
The thought should fill him with joy and happy anticipation but all he felt was a sort of hollowness that didn't quite match up with how he knew he was supposed to feel. But who knew? Perhaps all people felt like that when they were about to get married. Perhaps it was just nerves.
Sherlock made a sound that was very nearly a sob, or possibly a laugh, and turned his head to kiss the palm of John's right hand. "My John."
And it was an improvement, there was no arguing about that. They now shared comfortable evenings at home and spent their nights on stake-outs and chasing criminals. They had brunch at their desks in the sitting room and shouted at the TV at night. They worked and talked and joked and rarely argued and all the tension and awkwardness that had been between them after Sherlock's return had slowly faded. He couldn't even pinpoint when precisely it had disappeared for good. Perhaps Mary's departure was related to that. John had severed all contact months ago and it had been as if a huge weight was lifted off Sherlock's chest, allowing him to breathe freely for the first time in years.
He knew it couldn’t go on forever. Sooner rather than later, John would scrape himself back together. He was good at doing that. In fact, he was already taking the first steps. He had gone from mourning Mary to mourning Mary and a child to mourning a life he might have had and trying to accept the fact that the woman he had loved had betrayed him and lied to him over and over again.
Afterwards, John realised that Sherlock likely hadn't eaten anything in several days and promptly deposited him on a kitchen chair and handed him an apple to munch on while he prepared some actual food for them.
He smiled to himself. It didn't matter if John ever confirmed it or not. He was what he was and Sherlock ... loved him.
"No offense taken," he said cheerfully. "Must be hard to get a date with him not liking other men, though."
Sherlock frowned. "John, I all but shouted my feelings from the rooftops."
"So ... he is alive at this point in time?" Judging by the confusion in her voice, Mrs Humperdinck was one of the few people who didn't read the news.
"You need to
"That is very kind of you," Sherlock said, placing the bowl on the floor for John. His voice sounded much warmer than it usually did when he was talking to strangers.
Sherlock's eyes flicked from the pajamas to John's face, then back down, then back up again. He frowned. "Why?"
"You're alive," John murmured. "You're alive, you're alive, you're alive."
His nose close the floor, he stuck his head under the bed and sneezed at the cloud of dust that greeted him. Time for Mrs Hudson to pretend not to be their housekeeper again.
He nudged the envelope towards Sherlock. "Read it. Please. You know me. And you know paper and ink. I promise this is not a trick. You'll be able to tell I wrote this three years ago, that it's been sitting in this envelope for longer than two weeks, that I've had it all this time, that it really always was intended for you."
And while John is still grappling with all that he sees, Sherlock tells him.
"Care for a night cap?" Sherlock asks. "I nicked an excellent bottle of scotch from my brother when I last had the displeasure of visiting him in his lair."
wants to. He says he does but I think he just wants to do it because he believes he should, not because he really wishes to. So I've been pushing back."
John put his hands on his hips. "And how do you know all of that?"
John, apparently pulled away from the edge at least for the moment by his words, stopped him. "Sherlock?"
But not yet.
The moment John realised what he was staring at, he tore his gaze away, swallowing hard.
John pulled open the door that had caught his eye. He grabbed Sherlock's arm and pulled him through, closing the door behind them and fumbling for the light switch.
“It’s certainly a lot better than it used to be,” Sherlock agreed, ducking under a low-hanging palm leaf.
"I was... I had no choice but to accept that you would never ... that you didn't ... you had Mary and that was that. And I could accept that. I
"What am I supposed to do with it? I'm not the dog here."
Small's shoulder sagged. "Thank you," he said softly, sniffling and wiping at his eyes. "I never meant to cause you any pain but ... I couldn't stand the thought of her getting to marry someone and being happy when my sister never will. Sam always wanted to have a really special wedding."
As was to be expected at this time of day, the other guests were assembled in the lounge, chatting quietly or playing a card game at the antique wooden table that dominated the left half of the room.
Yes, John could see how that might look bad. Eventually, Mycroft would learn that not everything was as bad as it seemed. But he would have to trust John until then and trust was not something the Holmes brothers gave easily.
An open-ended question, the dangling hook hardly hidden at all. But Sally didn't fall for it. She had simply shaken her head.
John whined at her and flicked his ears uncertainly. This was not something he could - or wanted to - explain to Mrs Hudson under the circumstances.
"Is that an attempt to make us slow down?" John asked.
Was it really so difficult to believe Sherlock would care if his own flatmate broke his neck? Was it so unlikely that he would experiment with touch and risk a cerebral aneurysm or even a stroke just for the flimsy excuse of not being caught off his guard if anyone else ever dared to touch him the way John did?
"That was supposed to look like a suicide," Sherlock reminded him. "The entire point was to make you stop looking for something. And I'm still sorry."
John stood and put a careful hand on his shoulder, making him turn his back towards the window so he could better examine it in natural light. He barely managed not to snatch his hand back when Sherlock flinched at the touch.
"She was," Sherlock confirmed. "I used to spend all my summers here as a child. It seemed ... like a natural place for me to go."
“Don’t confuse me with yourself,” John murmured automatically. “You’d have excelled in being a godfather for sure, though.”
A gentle breeze blew in from the sea, bringing with it the taste of salt and seaweed and the sweet, heavy scent of the lilac blooming around the edge of the garden.
John brought him the messenger bag and held perfectly still while Sherlock hooked the lead into his collar and rummaged through the bag to make sure they had everything. "All right, got it. Come on then."
John ensured that the anteroom was empty of all threats and then moved on.
Sherlock shook his head. "Amazingly, this is the first time in my life where I really want him to give me a call. It's also the first time that he can't lord his superior connections over me and I can't even enjoy it."
There is a glint of approval in Mycroft's eyes as he replies. "Nothing. Yet. You are already in an ideal position. We have time yet. Keep your eyes and ears open. That is all."
*****
The older woman smiled at him. "That's me. I suppose you've already met my husband. He works at the reception and does the general maintenance around the place." And to Sherlock she said: "I suppose this is your young man, then?"
John watched his former best friend carefully but couldn't find any hint of a lie in Sherlock's face. Oh, he had always been a good liar but it had mostly worked if you didn't know him or if you weren't expecting a lie. John had gotten quite good at telling when Sherlock was having him on, or at least he liked to think so. This time, there was no hint of guile in Sherlock's face. If anything, he seemed to be actively stopping himself from saying more.
Hennings furrows her brow. "I might have misheard but it seems they found someone unconscious under a bonfire."
John lowered his hand. "The one you dropped? No, I burned that one."
Perhaps he was just compensating for his lack of a wife. Perhaps he just wanted to kiss someone.
The moment the words were out of his mouth, he knew he had been too harsh. John wasn't homophobic - something Sherlock was fully aware of. His relationship to his sister may be strained, but the problem was her being an alcoholic, not her being a lesbian. His own overreaction just now may very well be the final straw that tipped John off to what was really going on.
- "Rewind" by Poets of the Fall
He could feel the bond anchored deep within his heart, a connection that would not be severed by anything but death. Right now, he couldn't feel a thing through it - Sherlock was too deeply unconscious for any emotion to be transmitted - but John knew it would open again once Sherlock woke. He had been able to feel him earlier, before the flame-out had knocked him out, and it had been the most beautiful thing that had ever happened to him in all his life. Beautiful and breathtakingly terrifying, seeing as Sherlock had been at the mercy of a murderous psychopath at the time. If anything had happened to him, if John had lost him ... the agony would have killed him, frankly.
"No idea. He isn't here yet. I suppose he is taking advantage of the chance to sleep in and won't be up for hours yet. We should keep an eye on the situation in any case. Passion gone wrong always makes a good motive for murder."
Sherlock barked a laugh. "My expectations?
John tried to see things from Mycroft’s perspective, i.e. through CCTV. They had spent a wonderful day in the Gardens, almost (or, depending on the camera angle, likely) kissed and returned home to Mycroft’s news. Clearly the bloody British Government was well aware of where John spent his nights. And this morning, Sherlock had left the flat in a rush and still hadn’t returned.
A moment later his train of thought was derailed when both of Sherlock's hands sank into his fur and started massaging the shampoo into the dense outer coat.
When John returned to 221b two days later for a quick visit, he made a point of looking in on Mrs Hudson on his way out. Sherlock's comment about his negligent behaviour where his former landlady was concerned had hit deep.
"You found something unusual about the son?" Sherlock inquired.
Looking at the images and examining the samples, Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if this was what a Psy's brain might look like if the dissonance killed them. He hoped he would never have cause to find out. The risk was there, though, and growing with every day and every touch he and John shared.
They trooped down the stairs and out into the mild afternoon.
His eyes flicked to John, surprised.
"This," Sherlock said calmly, "takes me about as much focus and energy as it takes you to breathe. I could let all our furniture float like this all day and hardly notice the strain. You think my telekinesis means I can make things fly. The Yarders think the worst I can do is drag a fleeing criminal back towards me if there is no other option to catch them."
John flinched but managed to hold Sherlock's gaze. "I deserved that one."
They made it to Kings Cross in plenty of time for a coffee and still-warm croissants before boarding their train. It was an early one during the week and not too many people seemed keen on going to Edinburgh at this particular time. John frankly couldn’t understand why. London was dreadful in this heat. At least the train had air conditioning.
"Don't you look at me like that," Sherlock grumbled. "It's your fault my transport has decided to betray me and it's absolutely unacceptable."
As expected, Mrs Munkeld was already waiting for them. She turned out to be a short, smartly dressed woman of slight build and sharp eyes. John could smell the stress on her despite a layer of freshly applied perfume. Losing the head of the company as well as his heir and successor in a matter of hours had clearly not done her any good, but he had not expected anything less.
John frowned. "I don't get why that is such a big deal. What's the worst that could happen?"
Hours later, when she finally drags herself home in the early morning, Sally is still shaken by it.
He turns, scans the sitting room to find his friend sitting in his chair, turning his phone in his hands. He looks pensive.
"Molly, we've got a couple of hours at least. Come on over."
*****
"James, of course," Patrick said, shrugging. "I only got the gist of it, but apparently each thinks the other slept with him although they had agreed to share. I'm honestly not sure how they came up with that. I know for a fact that he has no interest in either of them."
“Don’t think I’ve ever seen this table without anything on it,” he noted.
For all intents and purposes, he had made his home here, in London. Baker Street was more of a home to him than the North or the hot Afghan desert had ever been and Sherlock was the only person he truly considered pack, regardless of what Sherlock himself thought of the matter.
"They did, though."
Soon, they had a list of likely suspects between the two of them.
Sherlock was almost bouncing on his feet and John was happy to oblige him. This was what they did, after all, and a dog keeping company with the police was hardly special.
Sherlock stared at the table, at the wall, at both of their mugs, and finally accidentally met her gaze and blurted: “I almost did it yesterday. And last night.”
Sherlock rather thought that might be more than John would be ready to tell, so he tried for another smile. This time, it seemed more successful. "I'll try and restrain myself."
It was as good as a shouted accusation and Sherlock knew there was only one possible response. "I have no intention of breaking Silence, Mycroft. It is a preposterous idea. Sentiment is a dangerous disadvantage and a distraction I could not possibly have any use for in my work."
A brown, fluffy head appeared in his line of vision and a soft cold snout snuffled at his hands before the dog - god, Sherlock had a dog now - put his head on John's knee and looked up at him with soulful eyes.
Sherlock's gaze snapped back to his, so he continued talking. "I wanted you the moment I saw you. But you weren't interested, you said it yourself, so I told myself I couldn't have you and that was that."
******
They had both been sitting by Sherlock's bedside in silence for the past twenty minutes, watching the steady rise and fall of his chest. The fever had already gone down from 42.1 to 41.9, much to John's relief, but the doctor's had been adamant about putting Sherlock on a course of antibiotics and running some tests just to be sure. Perhaps that was due to the brief conversation Mycroft had had with them upon his arrival at the hospital.
Judd ignored their silent conversation and continued. "I am of the sub-designation TK-Cell, if that tells you anything. While my TK works just as well as yours, it is specialised to work at a cellular level. I was trained to use it to kill people, to stop their hearts in their chests. Recently, I have found a better way to put it to use by rearranging cells and tissue to heal wounds. But the triggers in my brain are likely very similar to yours. If this is the case, there will be a kill switch somewhere. If you get too emotional and your TK gets out of control, this trigger will cause your death."
When Sherlock was in the Net, he didn't take notice of anything around him. John wanted to ask how he was supposed to alert him - if he touched him in public, someone might notice and then who knew what might happen.
John dropped the stick at Sherlock's feet, privately amused at the idea of making him bend down to retrieve it.
He shook his head.
Without really meaning to, Sherlock wrapped himself around him, throwing one leg over John's and wrapping one arm around his mid-section. Instead of complaining, John pushed his arm under Sherlock's head and grasped his hand and now Sherlock could hear John's steady heartbeat again and feel his hot breath in his hair.
John did as he had asked but left the door to his room open, a visual reminder that he was there if Sherlock needed him.
He poured Sherlock a cup of tea, added the prerequisite two sugars, and started buttering a bread roll for him. "Jam?"
He hadn't said it but it was obvious that it was mostly for John's sake, something to distract him - and perhaps Sherlock, too - from all the mess they had left behind.
Sherlock huffs. "Don't be silly. I think you're confusing me with your daughter."
"Sherlock?"
"I just like hearing you say it," Sherlock admitted, somehow even closer now, though John honestly couldn't recall having seen him move. "I like hearing you finally admit it."
John tried not to seem too eager as he approached, but it seemed ridiculous to even pretend that he didn't like the idea.
*****
"John," Lestrade said, nodding at him and doing his best to seem casual. "Sorry to intrude. I haven't heard from you since you sent round that mass text saying the wedding was called off after our ... uh... chat. I just wanted to make sure you were doing all right."
Sherlock talked right over him. "And, finally, the burning of the Yule Goat through vandals has definitely become a tradition in this city. Not only are we celebrating Christmas in one of the most Christmas-y locations on earth, we are also observing their own quaint traditions in the process."
Sherlock couldn't find fault with his logic and had acquiesced. Being a little tipsy was fine. Being completely smashed might be dangerous. He still had rather vivid memories of John's stag night, the last time they had gotten truly drunk together, and even a year and a half later he still wasn't sure if regret or relief won over in regards to that night and all the things that hadn't happened. He knew he had come dangerously close to revealing entirely too much and that was enough to make him wary now.
"Apart from the police, you mean?" she asked. "Not as far as I know. It has been locked this entire time and of course there's no reason to go in there. The police took all the files and his computer with them, there is nothing anyone could have wanted to get or drop off in there."
John sighed but decided to let it drop.
The paper had been folded up several times and felt soft in the way paper did when it had been handled often. It unfolded easily in John's hand, almost falling open on its own accord. It had probably been unfolded and refolded many times over. He felt his heart sink - if the paper was old, it was unlikely that it contained any information relevant to finding Rosie. But he had to know.
There was laughter among the officers when nothing happened.
John used the other Psy's monologue to carefully round the next corner, being careful to stick to the darkest shadows. He couldn't risk looking around the next corner to take in the scene, not until he knew where the Psy was. It wouldn't do for him to notice John's eyes reflecting the light.
He didn’t entirely succeed.
"How about asking
He jerked his mind away from that memory. It wasn't a day he could think of with any sort of equanimity and he was already in too much upheaval today to want to add more to it.
Only minutes after John had left, DI Greg Lestrade and Sally Donovan walked through the doors of the hospital and managed to extract Sherlock's room number from the harried nurse, who took one look at their police badges and sent them on their way.
John wanted to tell him that this was ridiculous but then Sherlock's fingers moved along his ribcage and towards his hips and he jerked at the sensation.
Sherlock let him, sinking back down onto the mattress while John processed this.
Here we are, my lovelies. Another story done. For now...
John wrinkled his nose as they got closer. "I can smell blood. We must be downwind of the crime scene."
Sherlock hung his head. "I didn't do it for you."
Sherlock surged forward to meet him, sighing into John's mouth. His fingers trembled against John's face but he was reasonably sure that John didn't care, if he even noticed it at all.
*****
Sherlock watched it with trepidation. Any moment now their hands would be close enough to touch and John would dissipate like so much mist in the sun.
“Anything.” The word was out of his mouth before he had even had time to process it.
Sherlock frowned but followed him over to the comfortable armchairs and sat down, his face carefully expressionless as he looked anywhere but at John.
Yes, they had managed to celebrate their first Christmas as flatmates. They had even entertained guests. Irene Adler's fake death, the long-overdue end of Lestrade's marriage and John getting dumped again, however, were not conductive to proper holiday cheer.
"How did you get these developed?" John laughed, looking at the pictures of himself covered in foam or with his fur just dried and poofy, just like the ginger cloud of candy floss Sherlock had said he resembled at the time.
"Sherlock," he began, not sure how he wanted to finish the sentence.
John grunted into his bowl, clearly seriously questioning whether Sherlock even knew how to cook.
“How do you feel about being back?” John asked that night as they lay in bed. They had curled up on their sides, facing each other on top of the blankets so they could get as much air in through the open window as possible. He had noticed that Sherlock had grown a bit more quiet as the evening progressed and had decided to wait until they were in bed and shrouded in darkness before he broached the topic.
"What's your flatmate like?" Tyson asked, then wrinkled his nose. "And where the hell have you been today? You absolutely reek of Psy."
"John?" Sherlock asked, shocked. "Of course not. No, it's just ... you know, I really suck at this relationship thing and I'm kind of amazed we've made it this far so I don't want to risk it." He exhaled a long stream of smoke. "I don't want him thinking I don't value his opinions. And his concern is touching, in a way."
Sherlock took a surprised breath, a warm puff of air on John's cheek as he exhaled. A tentative hand grasped John's hip and the other wrapped around his elbow.
Mostly, they just chat about their lives - Mrs Hudson's hip, Molly's plans to spend Christmas with her fiancé, Tom. Sally can't help but notice that Molly doesn't seem quite as over the moon about him as might be expected.
Sherlock closed his eyes to steel himself before shaking his head. "Nothing."
Initially, Sherlock had not wanted to put up a tree at all, his argument being that
“I’m sorry, John.”
He laughed and the bitter sound of it did nothing to disperse John's horror at what he was hearing. "Do you know I was relieved? She was dead and I was so ... relieved. She killed me and she kept making those little digs at me ... you never noticed. She was always careful to make sure you wouldn't hear or realise what she was doing. But she knew."
"Nothing?"
Now, though, Sherlock smelled ... different. Unhappy still, yes, but angry, too. John wondered what had caused the change, what thought process had made Sherlock arrive at anger.
"Yes?"
"No matter what," Sherlock echoed.
His voice cracked on the word "feelings" - pitiful, embarrassing. Stupid, stupid Sherlock.
John smiled and took a step closer so he could look into Sherlock's eyes as he spoke. "I want you. All of you, all the time."
Sherlock paused. “We both do. Come with me.”
Finally, he remembered.
“Was there anything else?” he demanded. “You could have simply texted.”
"You follow me into dangerous situations on a regular basis, John. I should very much hope you trust me."
"If he doesn't, he'll find one soon enough," Sherlock told him. "And if
She rolled her eyes and stepped back. "Ignore them. They still haven't forgiven him for being a loner instead of becoming the prestigious Sentinel they wanted him to be. And they're convinced that their children only exist as a stepping stone to grandchildren."
John pulled his head free and turned his attention to the rest of the room, sniffing at the night stand and biting back a growl at the unmistakeable scent of tobacco.
"Hm, true. Never thought he'd use that on me, though."
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s not your fault.”
Next to Sherlock, John had gone still and Sherlock realised rather belatedly that this was news to him as well.
"Ms Conall, you are under arrest on suspicion of the murder of Benjamin Forsythe."
Blue eyes sparkling with amusement, thin lips parted around a quiet laugh. Sherlock tried not to stare, filing the visual and audial memory away in the section of his mind palace reserved exclusively for John Watson.
John sucked in a breath and Judd held up a hand. "This is the first trigger we will disable. You do not require it. There is no way you could ever harm your mate. My own TK has recognised my mate as a part of myself, something that will automatically be protected from every outside threat. However, this does not extend to others in your vicinity, as far as I have been able to discover. We will therefore reprogramme the kill switch so it will merely make you black out. It is not ideal and may leave you vulnerable at unfortunate moments, but it will also give you the assurance that you will not be provoked into an accidental flare of your power. And, of course, it won't kill you and thus spare your mate from worrying."
"Human contact?" Sherlock echoed, now earnestly puzzled.
The defeat and despair on his face spoke volumes.
She placed the tin on the coffee table and left.
An indescribable emotion flickered across Sherlock's face at that, something like hope that was quickly squashed down. His shoulders slumped and he visibly pulled himself together after another moment. "It doesn't change anything. He doesn't
He read for a while, checked his blog and closed it when he saw the outpouring of support in the comment section of his latest entry, and finally began to tidy the flat a little. God only knew when Sherlock had last hoovered in here, provided he even knew what a hoover was and where Mrs Hudson kept it.
Sherlock nodded. "I felt it," he said. "When it snapped into place. I felt it. Why then?"
your brother?”
Sherlock thought they should have. Someone must have. People were so obsessed with their relationships, surely someone had thought to make people share a bed and see what happened. If only he had internet access here, he could have pulled out his phone and researched it.
"The victim's accountant sent over the files I requested. I've started going over the numbers last night but-"
Frowning, he shoved the ticking countdown in his head away. Now was not the time. Solve the murder, then worry about everything else.
"Yes. I'm only ever yours, love."
"God, anything," John groaned and then almost sobbed as Sherlock bobbed his head again, letting his tongue swirl around the head of John's cock.
If John died, this would have no impact on Sherlock's life.
In the end, he stayed silent and simply let John grapple with the fact for a bit.
"Emily has messaged me. DarkRiver have responded to our request for a call."
John, who was starting to wonder if he had developed some form of sixth sense for this sort of thing happening, sprang forward and managed to wrestle the man's arm down before he could do more than swing in Sherlock's vague direction. The older man was quite spry for his age and put up a good fight but John knew how to quickly and efficiently disarm an attacker and within moments he had Henryk on his knees with his arm twisted behind his back and the crowbar on the floor.
Sherlock shook his head. "No one ever wants me," he said calmly. "Psy do not operate based on baser instincts. Until you walked into my life, there was no one who would have ever even considered anything but cool indifference."
John had known it was going to happen sooner or later, male physiology being what it was, but he still wasn’t very happy to wake up hard and aching in the early hours of the morning. Under normal circumstances, he would have simply shoved a hand in his pants, dealt with the issue and gone back to sleep, but Sherlock was asleep not quite next to him, his left leg slung across John’s and his face all but mashed into John’s left upper arm.
But well, if it came down to it... there were certainly worse things than being Sherlock's dog. He clearly liked dogs and by his own admission even used to have one of his own, and he was taking good care of John and treating him wonderfully. But, well, what about John's life expectancy? Had it been shrunk down to that of an average dog? Were eight to twelve years all he could hope for? Or would he retain his human life span and just stay with Sherlock for the rest of both of their lives?
John stared at the certificate, which bore what were unmistakably his and Sherlock's signatures and therefore created an entire new reality he had not previously been aware of. "I ... don't know."
He shuddered. "They would rehabilitate me and kill him, both as a warning to others and in revenge for the recent high-profile defections from the Net."
"It's not the touch," Sherlock repeated. "That's it, isn't it? You don't use touch simply for the sake of contact. It's not the touch, it's what you express with it."
“What?”
It was a long conversation and he could feel her exhaustion and wariness in the way her hand moved only listlessly at times, as if she had forgotten all about him and was far away in her thoughts. He gave her a soulful stare, making the best puppy eyes he was capable of, and felt her mood lift a little in return.
A second glance around the room showed that James Marquis was nowhere to be seen, which probably wasn't all that surprising, considering the circumstances.
"John!" Mary calls from downstairs.
Footsteps came rushing towards him and moment later Sherlock dropped into a crouch next to him. "Here, let me see. Stay still."
It probably wasn't very nice of him, but John couldn't help but smirk to himself. Well, the wanker certainly deserved that discomfort after the stunt he had pulled. To randomly enter a pub with the sole objective of getting drunk was certainly not something John had seen him do before. It was probably a stupid experiment of some sort that had gotten quite out of hand, as these things usually did when Sherlock Holmes was involved.
He started massaging the oil into Sherlock’s skin in earnest and felt him melt into the mattress beneath his touch.
It took several attempts, but finally John seemed to have figured out how four legs and paws worked and was able to stand - still a bit shakily, but on his own.
It should have given him pause, perhaps, a moment's surprise or hesitation. Instead, all he felt was puzzle pieces clicking into place and the world finally making sense.
In four quick moves, Sherlock has John flat on his back on the carpet and is hovering on his knees above him, pinning him by the shoulders. "There."
John looked up at him again, consciously avoiding his crotch and making an effort to focus on his face. "Everything all right?"
"John..."
Sherlock shrugged. "Found it in his office this morning."
John grinned. "So he is. Now, what was it you were saying?"
"Ah, John," Sherlock says as soon as he walks in. "I've been thinking we should take her to the zoo tomorrow. Tuesdays are statistically days with fewer visitors which will allow even the shy animals to emerge from their hiding places and we can teach her to identi-"
“I do,” Sherlock said. “But he should have presented his reasoning and asked for your permission first instead of thrusting you into all this without any warning.”
Sherlock shook his head. "I think he didn't need any chemicals this time around because his victim was Psy. Low gradient, I would say. Any mental shields he had would have been far easier to break than those of a changeling."
There were a lot of things he had never expected to do before meeting Sherlock Holmes.
Later that night Sherlock sneezes. John wordlessly hands him one of the family-sized tissue packs.
In a house containing John and an affectionate, non-dominant deer changeling, Sherlock had chosen John for his little experiment in touch. Mrs Hudson, John knew, would have given Sherlock all the hugs he could possibly ask for. But he hadn't. He had asked John.
“No need to explain,” Lestrade said. “None of this can be easy for you.”
He noticed that Sherlock had stilled and though he was still staring into the microscope, it was obvious he wasn't paying attention to what he was seeing there.
When he finally returned to the sitting room, John was just examining Billy on the mantle with what Sherlock thought was a slightly wistful expression on his face. He turned away when he heard Sherlock enter though and smiled at him, which promptly chased all of Sherlock's lingering anxiety away.
Sherlock made use of the distraction by smartly bringing his knee up into a very sensitive region of the other attacker's body, who folded to his knees with a garbled moan of pain.
Sorry for the delay here, guys - got a bit side-tracked yesterday. Enjoy!
The other man relaxed as well and moved closer. "Not allowed to smoke, are you?"
John thought about it a lot more often than he wanted to admit.
He shrugged. "Whichever conclusions you draw are yours alone."
Sherlock had to admit that perhaps Lestrade had had a point.
John thought it all sounded reasonable, but had to wonder why no one thought it odd that two people who had named their sons
Was this something all people who had never been Silent experienced all the time? He had no one he could ask and none of his teachers had ever thought to tell him. It was becoming increasingly clear that in the sea of emotion, he was entirely out of his depth.
She jumps but doesn't turn. "Go away."
Sherlock grumbled into the collar of his coat but refused to open his eyes. There really was nothing for it. John had to do it. He took a moment to collect himself, then barked "Sherlock Holmes, you will get up and exit this car immediately or there will be severe consequences!" in his best I-am-Captain-John-Watson-don't-mess-with-me voice.
"What?" Sherlock asked, confused.
Sherlock gave him a long look. "Because I don't wish to."
All he had to do was take it.
"Memories, you mean," Lestrade growled. "I'm not stupid. It's a mental network, everything you 'upload' is something you have seen or heard."
"You-" John began and then stopped talking to figure out what he wanted to say.
Sherlock smiled but before he could reply, he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. He pulled it out and glanced at the screen. "Ah."
That was enough then.
“Don’t be,” Sherlock said softly. “It was worth it.”
He could say "Yes, I know." He could shrug it off. He could pretend he has no idea what Sherlock is talking about. What he says instead is: "If you know why it's there, why did you ask me about it earlier?"
Bit Not Good turns into Could Be Dangerous in a heartbeat.
She linked her arm through his and pulled him along. "Come on, let's check the formal wear section. I can't believe you managed to get a table at our favourite restaurant on such short notice."
The scent of chemicals was biting, as was the disinfectant he and Mrs Hudson regularly put to good use in the kitchen, but mostly the flat smelled of old furniture and wood and dust, all of it covered in layers and layers of his and Sherlock's combined scent. That was quite amazing, actually. He had never before realised just how much space he and Sherlock shared.
"Perhaps your Psy doesn't know everything," Mike suggested. "Seems to me like their Council wouldn't want the news to spread in case other Psy decide to defect as well. It's easy to keep control over an entire race when all its members depend on the same thing. Tell them there's a way around that and I bet many will be happy to explore this new possibility."
"Oh."
"Ready?" Sherlock appeared beside him, following his gaze. "Do you know, I've always hoped for a murder in one of those capsules. That would be quite entertaining."
"Oh, John, luv. Of course you did. When are you coming home?"
Three hours and fifty-nine minutes until it would become too much - if he was lucky. Add another hour or two to make his way from Baker Street to his old haunts, most likely closer to two or three hours depending on where his old dealers had moved. Even during the worst of it he had still had enough presence of mind to go to his regulars, not trusting strangers. So, about six or seven hours until he fell right back into the spiral he had clawed his way out of. It was more than enough time.
Sherlock shrugged. "For a while, I was. I think the conditioning held for about a year. After that, I started to pretend. It was easier, at times, and Mycroft had me reconditioned very carefully after I got off the drugs. Don't frown like that, it was the only thing he could have done. The reconditioning helped me overcome the addiction. So much of drug addiction is due to how a drug makes you feel. It's easier to resist when you don't feel anything at all."
Now, he put his skills into practice.
“Good morning,” John replied. “I made tea and there’s still some toast if you want any.”
They stared at each other for several long moments, finally acknowledging this thing between them and staring it right in the face. John felt as if they were finally on the same page. No words were needed.
*****
Not about to give John or himself any time to hesitate, Sherlock whirled around, effectively boxing John in against the wall and leaving not an inch between their bodies as he cupped his best friend's face in both hands and kissed him.
There it was then. And John didn't sound as if he was angry. Or ... disgusted. He sounded almost as if he might have been thinking about it, too.
Whatever action of John's had made him realise this remained unclear to him, but John nodded anyway, settling down on the carpet next to Sherlock, his head comfortably squeezed through the gap between Sherlock's right arm, torso and right thigh. He got comfortable and eyed his friend expectantly.
He shrugged. "It's the best you can get. We caught the killer and eliminated him. He will never hurt anyone again. My advise is to let it go. You won't get any more than that and it is considerably more than we could have hoped for."
"Perhaps there is a queue. Or he met Stamford on the way," Sherlock said, trying to sound as if he wasn't worried. "Changelings are sociable - he will stop for a chat with anyone if there is no pressing need for him to be somewhere."
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Or perhaps it simply put John in a better position to figure them out.
Apart from the rant, Sherlock's very scent had carried undertones of anxiety and worry during their trip to the vet's and the entire ride back to 221b, only to be gradually replaced by fury along the way.
"Lestrade yelled at you?" Sherlock asked, surprised. "When?"
John left the alley to flag down a cab. When he turned to look down the street, a large, beautiful silver fox had stopped at a corner and was looking back at him. Lestrade flicked his ear before disappearing into the night and John squashed down the ache in his chest. Lestrade might be going home in his changeling form but John was going home to Sherlock. And although he'd never say it out loud, he preferred it that way.
He hesitated. "Well... I was just wondering... how long do you expect this situation to last?"
"A wedding ring. I want one. Titanium, just like yours, with the same date and everything. And I want you to put it on my finger when we renew our vows. We're married already. We can tell our friends we never got around to having a proper ceremony and just renew our vows and then have a private party afterwards. Anything you want. But I want a ring."
"Yes," Sherlock said, and now he sounded frustrated. "I wonder how she did it."
But he couldn't ask. The man who had walked into this office was all but a stranger. He certainly treated John like one.
John sat up expectantly, waiting for the moment to happen.
John, who was starting to wonder if he had developed some form of sixth sense for this sort of thing happening, sprang forward and tried to wrestle the man's arm down before he could do more than swing in Sherlock's vague direction.
Sherlock shook his head. "Not yet, but he will any moment now. I kept a tally of how long it usually took him to get CCTV footage from the Underground network on previous jobs. Based on that, I was able to calculate an average response time. Factoring in the likely size of the files on such a busy line, he should be receiving the files in the next five minutes. Therefore, there is no point in us returning home just yet, so we may as well go to the Yard directly."
Incidents such as these had led to the introduction of dissonance - the only way to teach them not to feel.
There were only so many things John could have intended for him to do and he was rather certain that blowing his nose wasn't on the list.
"Got my own, thanks. Wouldn't mind a light, though."
, John," he repeated, finally forcing himself to make eye contact. "You're already two days late for your honeymoon. Go home to your wife, forget all of this, and live the life you always wanted. The life you deserve."
Sherlock pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to Lestrade. "Perhaps we can hail a cab to the Yard so I can take a look immediately."
*****
"At this point, there are a number of possibilities."
"Oi!" John said, instinctively reaching out and stopping him with one hand pressed to his chest.
Sherlock exhaled in a soft "Oh" and turned his head a little. John thought he felt his lips ghosting across his temple and his laughter cut off abruptly, all mirth replaced with something else.
“Just woke up and thought I heard voices,” John said. He crossed his arms and hunched his shoulders. “Well? I assume this is important if you show up in our sitting room at 8:30 in the morning.”
"Bloody hell, mate, this is a surprise!" Lestrade exclaimed, slapping his back and beaming with open delight. "Didn't think I'd see you around again. Worked it all out, have you?"
They are, as far as she can tell, a perfectly ordinary elderly couple. Upon closer inspection, though, she can't help but find traces of Sherlock in them. His mother's eyes, cheekbones and mouth, his father's statue.
This time, John was the first to look away. There was only so much time he could spend staring into Sherlock's iridescent eyes without wanting to drag him off to his lair and ravish him.
"Nothing," Sherlock rasped after far too long.
"I'm starting to," she said. "See you tomorrow."
John thought of a Psy Sherlock had pointed out to him on the street two days earlier, one who had been rehabilitated for daring to laugh. It was the closest he had ever seen to what post-apocalyptic novels described as zombies. He shuddered at the memory.
Suddenly, he turns his hands, laces his fingers with Sherlock's. "She aimed a gun at you."
*****
He didn't get any more time to ponder the issue as John was determined to drag him down to the dining hall for breakfast, making it very clear that Sherlock was definitely going to eat something.
He paused, hesitated. "Change is coming. You should both brace yourselves for it. A few months from now, the world may be a very different place than it is now. Hold on until then."
He had never had anyone pay this much attention to his body, including himself. John's undivided attention was more intoxicating than any dose of Jax Sherlock had ever taken in his youth.
Of course he insisted on taking a couple of pictures and then rejoined Sherlock for a selfie, which had to be the most ridiculous thing Sherlock had ever participated in. Still, the result pleased John and they were both grinning like madmen in the photograph, so Sherlock chose to let it slide. Anything that made John happy had his stamp of approval.
Sherlock's thoughts screech to a halt, his breath snatched from him as the physical contact occupies all the space in his brain, easily trumping the need to breathe in favour of processing the toasty 38.4°C of John's hand after a night in a warm bed, the texture of Sherlock's own shirt pressed to his skin in an exact outline of John's hand, the closeness, the
Indeed John had.
A careful examination of his friend while he was engrossed in some task or other had led John to conclude that Sherlock was not to be disturbed. There were dark circles under his eyes, he kept pacing around the room, shifting papers back and forth and rambling on and on about everything that still needed doing.
Another term she doesn't use for him often. It brings a smile to his face, like she knew it would.
"Sure."
Not all of them reply. Those who do either admit to having fake cameras or inform her that they don't actually keep any of the data for longer than a week at most. Sally only sighs at those. It was rather a long shot to hope that there would still be footage left almost three years after the fact.
John didn't need to see the look on Sherlock's face to know what the answer would be. He folded away his newspaper and went to join him on the sofa, leaving a bit of room so Mrs Hudson could sit between them.
"Or were very good at hiding," Sherlock added.
, either.”
John frowned and breathed in deeply through his nose. The flat smelled like it always did but Sherlock's scent had gone stale, for lack of a better term. He must have been gone for hours, had probably left soon after John this morning.
"Don't be ridiculous, my dog needs to be seen by a vet immediately," Sherlock snapped at him and rattled off the address to the nearest vet. Sometimes, knowing every street in London was awfully handy. "I'll pay double the usual fare if you get us there in under ten minutes."
Sherlock cleared his throat. "Lucas Hunter said you might be able to help me find a way to circumvent the dissonance."
John smiled, set down the bag and went hunting for plates and mugs.
John looks devastated. "Sherlock ... I'd never ... she means nothing to me anymore. Surely you must know that."
The flat was empty.
It was a sorry state of affairs all around. At least Sherlock looked alert and bright-eyed as usual, ready to take on the world.
"Luckily you are extremely skilled at disarming people," Sherlock commented as they walked down the hallway to their room. "He could have done a lot of damage with that crowbar."
*****
The speed with which he had adapted to his circumstances was impressive – Sherlock wondered how much of it was due to John's army training and general ability to adapt to new situations quickly. After all, he had easily settled into their life together as well, fitting into Sherlock's life as easily as if he had always been a part of it. By now, he could no longer imagine anything else.
*****
He realised that Mycroft was waiting expectantly. "Fine," he said because there was nothing else he could say. "But I'm changing out of it as soon as we're back at the inn. I haven't been a soldier for almost two years."
"Treasure, John! Everyone needs something they can treasure!"
Up until now, she has always thought Sherlock Holmes is fearless.
"Well, well, well, brother," he said. "I see you once again gave up every pretense of proper decorum in order to make as much of a spectacle of yourself as you possibly could under the circumstances."
John was very glad he couldn't talk right now, but that didn't stop him from thinking that, if Sherlock wanted, he could have that even if there was no dog around anymore. All he had to do was ask.
recall, I am the one who manhandled you all the way from the car, up the stairs, through the flat and into your bed last night." Sherlock glowered at him. "The ability to carry a grown man does not necessarily indicate the ability to throw the same man to the floor."
"Are... are you all right?"
And, of course, there was the matter of Sherlock's brother.
*****
Instead he just sat there, his mind spinning in endless circles as he tried to figure out what the hell he was supposed to do now. He was still sitting there when Lestrade came to collect him for the stag night.
"Sarcastic?" Sherlock asked. "Almost never. You may have fallen for my reasoning but the Council wouldn't." He paused and considered. "On the plus side, they also likely wouldn't be able to detect sarcasm, so I think I'm in the clear for once."
It didn't, of course. In fact, John didn't even get close to accomplishing his goal because somewhere in between him approaching the bed and reaching for the sheets, Sherlock turned into an octopus of some sort. In short, John ended up exactly where he had been before - lying on the bed with Sherlock hovering above him. Decidedly where he should
"Yeees,"  Sherlock drawled, rolling his eyes. "But I wanted to."
"It wouldn't make a difference, Lestrade. He's ... very firmly set in his ways."
"At least one of you is reasonable about this," Lestrade said, shrugging. "More than I could have hoped for, really. Have a good night, boys. Remember to call ahead, Sherlock."
The house smelled mostly of the people who lived there, naturally, and so while Mrs Forsythe's scent was very strong and clear, he could still easily pick up traces of an older man, certainly her husband, and a younger male relative, likely the son. There was an interesting addition to the son's scent that kept John's attention for quite a while as he tried in vain to figure out what it was. Something ... clean. A kind of powder, perhaps. It was hard to describe and he had no idea how to make Sherlock aware of such a thing, not without being able to speak.
"My god, he actually likes you!" Donovan commented, sounding scandalised.
"Only if he managed to literally stab himself in the back." Lestrade held up a close-up of the wound.
As he hugged Tyson in greeting, John wondered what Sherlock made of this entire interaction. He didn't think Sherlock had ever seen him around his friends. With no little amount of guilt he realised that this was because he so rarely spent any time with them. Not since Sherlock had come into his life, at least.
He did so and continued, aware of John twitching every now and then, although he was clearly trying to stand still.
"That's exactly what a hallucination would say," Sherlock pointed out, even as a tiny voice of doubt piped up in his mind. It had never gone like this before. He shifted a little, felt a tiny rock in the grass poking at his shoulder. That was a bit detailed for a hallucination or a dream.
John actually managed to lift his eyebrows, or rather the place where his eyebrows would have resided on a human face.
*****
It's then that she notices the dried blood on his face.
"Or?" Lestrade prompted.
"Sherlock-" John starts and that's as far as he gets before Sherlock flies forward, grasping the lapels of his nicest shirt and crushing their mouths together.
"Mmh-hm," Sherlock hummed in confirmation. "A token. Something you will give to me before leaving that I can return when you come back."
Sherlock shook his head. “The only thing I ever doubted was my ability to make you stay.”
They looked at one another from across the room and Sherlock gave a half-smile. It looked sincere and that was enough to make John want to leap across the room and repeat his entire loss of control all over again. Psy did not smile.
John whined at him and gave a complicated shrug, which Sherlock took to mean that he had an answer but no possibility of properly expressing it at the time.
"None taken," John said cheerfully.
John had never been supposed to find out. Well, not like this, anyway. And admittedly the chances of him finding out in the one way Sherlock would not have minded quite so much where below zero anyway.
“Yes?”
"God, I missed food," he sighed. "You have no idea."
John let out a soft curse and Sherlock felt his own mouth drop open. Empath.
"No, that's what I thought," Sherlock sighed. "Except for the obvious, of course, and I really can't be bothered."
"And so would you, if you had been snooping through the attic with me yesterday," Sherlock said, straightening. "Come on."
In front of him, Sherlock stood bare-chested, his dark hair starting to curl wildly in the humid air. It made John's fingers twitch. God, he wanted to touch. He wanted to lick that chest to test his theory.
Sherlock actually looked a little hurt. "I haven't done anything, John, I swear. I slept, just as you asked me to, and when I woke up, I decided to go and bring you breakfast in bed. People like having breakfast in bed, don't they?"
John opened one eye and glanced up at him without moving his head. Sherlock’s eyes were unmoving - not REM sleep then but the deeper stage 3 non-REM sleep, based on his lax body. He likely wouldn’t wake for some time yet. Plenty of time then to think about their late-night conversation.
She must have seen something in his eyes because she nodded. "All right. I'll just be downstairs. You shout if you need anything and I'll make sure no one comes up to disturb you."
Certainly his friend had a new tendency to become very stiff-backed and short when John's wedding was mentioned or alluded to. He didn't seem to have taken the comment about best men as the compliment John had intended it to be and instead looked like someone pretending he didn't have a tooth ache.
"As it happens, we are," he therefore said. "William Sigerson. This is John."
Here, in the dark, everything seemed possible.
He blinked, trying to place the round face.
Several seconds ticked by in silence. Then John sighed and hung his head. "No, you're not wrong. They can smell me on you."
He caught himself almost immediately, a condescending "Well done" half-formed on his lips, but that moment of distraction was all that John had needed.
The moment they were out of sight of the police, Sherlock bent down and removed the lead from John's collar.
to be anywhere else or do anything but kiss Sherlock for hours on end.
"And then I need you to play along," Sherlock told him, forcing himself to pay attention to the hall instead of the way John's body felt pressed so closely against his. It would be far easier for everyone involved if he managed to stay calm and aloof.
They seemed to be having lots of those these days. Perhaps there was just something about waking from a nightmare to find someone there who would understand. And recently even John’s waking hours had been full of nightmares.
"We're going to train you to use the loo," Sherlock groaned. "Fine. Get off me so I can get up. You're undermining your efforts to bully me into a normal sleep cycle."
He knew it probably wasn't a good idea and he didn't have any sort of excuse for reading a personal note of Sherlock's but if this could in any way help him understand what the hell was going on, he couldn't risk letting the chance slip through his fingers.
After a not entirely uncomfortable silence, the kettle flicked off and Molly returned to the table, pouring fresh tea for them both.
Next to him, he heard John's breathing pattern even out and deepen, and something in the way the mattress dipped suggested that his body had gone lax as he fell asleep.
Yet the very thought of John dying caused him to shudder, his entire being shying away from the thought as if it was a searing flame.
He reached the top of the hill and found a suitable rock to sit on, leaning his back against a slightly taller bolder as he stared out across the land.
Vast empty space greeted Sherlock where he usually found his speech capacity. Clearly he must have misheard. Surely John hadn't just told him what Sherlock's ears claimed to have heard.
They both sighed and relaxed a little more.
"You're right," John murmured, slinging his arms around Sherlock and pressing his face to his chest. "I wish you weren't but you're right. I told myself,
Sherlock shook his head. "Oh no, I'd have given it to you. I'm not the type to run others through."
Sherlock doubted it but merely nodded. "Of course. I shall monitor the situation."
Mycroft raised one eyebrow and continued unperturbed: "... and the other option would be an identification number tattooed to the inside of his ear."
She shrugged. "She's a nice young thing and he's a moron for letting her go, but that's men for you. No offense."
Sherlock shook his head. "John ... what are you saying?"
But not anymore. Whatever hope there had been for them, that blasted letter had destroyed it.
His words were disjointed, his handwriting shaky - that might be the whiskey, along with the anger - but he managed to dump it all out there, taking himself to task, taking MARY to task, damn her.
"Bloody hell! What are you doing here?!"
John reached the dark corner in time to see Sherlock tense at the sound of steps coming his way. John could see him hastily putting the torch away and producing a cigarette and lighter from somewhere.
"It wasn't like I had much of a choice. I could hear the trains rattling in and out of Baker Street Station."
he was suggesting.
He shook his head. “Not really. They’ve finished looking into our finances and couldn’t find anything to support the theory of us having hired a killer, so we should be in the clear for good now. But the list of her known aliases keeps getting longer.”
"So what are you going to do now?" he asked carefully.
And Holmes, wide-eyed and suddenly very pale indeed, says: "Thank you, Sally, I think we can skip that part."
John actually looked surprised. "Really?"
“Thank you, Mrs H.” John kissed her cheek and waited in the safety of the hallway while she went out back to the bins, stopping to chat to Mrs Turner for a bit before returning inside.
Every word was a blow. Sherlock shook his head, unable to believe any of it.
"Oh, no. No, it was fine," Sherlock replied. "Molly has discovered trace amounts of a chemical compound in the stomach of one of the victims. She is trying to analyse and replicate it so we can study it in more detail."
John almost turned around and left again but Sherlock's coat hung in its usual place, right next to his scarf. It was too cold out for him to leave without either.
Right. Mary.
Perhaps this was another thing it would be best to ignore. That was all they seemed to be doing these days - ignoring the issue and pretending everything was as it should be. The longer it went on, the surer John was that something was most decidedly wrong. If only he could put his finger on what the hell it was.
"So, nothing useful then," John murmured. "Any theories on why the killer went for a Psy this time?"
"I don't need any," John said. "I know you and I know how you think. And that means I can do
"Hm, I still have my scars, too," John husked and cleared his throat several times until someone got the point and handed him a glass of water. "Thanks." He drank a few sips and when he spoke again, his voice sounded much better. "Didn't think I'd get those back, actually. Could have done without them, really."
"Yes, but three family-sized packs?"
Sherlock wanted John to stay. He wanted it so badly it physically hurt, because he knew with absolute certainty that he wasn't allowed to want that. The world didn't work like that.
And now it was over. Today he had solved the last out-of-town case John would ever accompany him on. And tonight was the last night he would ever get to be this close to John for any length of time.
She turned to John and hugged him. "And hello to you, stranger. You look ... good."
Sherlock grabbed a pen from somewhere and, to John's utter astonishment, signed swiftly. And then, still eerily wordless, he walked into his bedroom and closed the door behind himself just firmly enough to make it clear that he didn't intend to come back out.
Sherlock had to make sure the house was clean and emptied of any food items, ensure it was closed up properly to discourage any burglars (though he doubted anyone in the vicinity had ambitions in that direction) and - most importantly - find a solution for his bees. He obviously couldn't take them with him. The lack of space at 221b aside, he was fairly certain that border control would throw a fit if he attempted to bring three beehives into the country. Things like pet passports, vaccinations and quarantine were sort of moot points when it came to several million bees, after all.
He showered as thoroughly as he could, had an equally thorough shave in front of the bathroom mirror and inspected himself carefully.
Had she been important? He frowned.
He stopped short when he saw John standing in the bathroom, wearing a towel wrapped around his waist and nothing else.
He carefully lifted Sherlock up and carried him down the hall to dump him in his ridiculously comfortable bed.
Sherlock looked pained. "I'm glad this amuses you, John. Personally, I found his conduct highly unprofessional. I'm surprised none of the guests have complained yet. He dismissed your presence with barely any acknowledgment of your order."
"It was all I could think of," Sherlock confessed. "Even as he was attacking me, all I could think of was you. And suddenly... I felt it, like an electric shock, like the snap of a rubber band around the wrist except it was around my soul." He frowned. "That doesn't make any sense."
Sherlock shrugged. "Nonetheless, it has become a tradition. It has burned down more often than not. Sometimes even twice in the same year."
Sherlock relaxed. "Oh. There's bread in that box over there."
It would kill him, Sherlock thought. What Moriarty himself, his entire network and Mary Morstan had failed at could without a doubt be achieved by John Watson going out on a lark. And, Sherlock thought miserably, the worst thing was that he still wouldn't say no if John asked.
A moment later, his footsteps retreated down the hall, leaving John alone with the endless carousel of thoughts showing him all the things he should have done differently.
John laughed. "No, you wouldn't. Let's just say I didn't get shot when I was wearing them in Afghanistan. But I definitely got laid a lot."
"My brother will be fine," Mycroft said calmly. "I would ... appreciate ... being able to put him down in his own bed, however."
John lets out a sigh that threatens to turn into a sob halfway through.
"You're the one who brought me home," John said. "Who took me in and kept me sane and looked after me and comforted me and did everything you could to help me through this. You were ... everything I needed. And you always will be."
Sherlock thought, biting his lip to stop himself from speaking out loud.
"I like that one," John said a couple of minutes later. "I didn't even notice you taking that, Mrs Hudson!"
Mrs Hudson, meanwhile, had quite a lot to say on the subject of crime in the South.
Finally, the t-shirt was gone and Sherlock pulled John with him as he rolled onto his back, moaning as John's warm weight settled above him, their bodies pressed together.
That got a reaction. Sherlock threw one leg over John's, slotting their bodies together as close as he could, and shook his head.
"Yes, what are you on about?," Sally demands, surprised at how strong her voice is. Angry.
It's the driftwood he clings to, wondering which shore he'll end up on.
"Did you like that?" John asked, had to ask. This was important.
"Well I'm not bleeding out of my nose or ears," Sherlock noted. His gaze turned very serious. "I think the effect you're having on me is wearing off, John."
“It’s down near Battersea Park,” he explained, rattling off the address. “Found the body next to the train tracks, shot to death.”
"He was the one who pointed it out in the first place," John told her.
They had come to a stop right in front of the gate. The barking was impossible to miss now.
After all, this was John curled up next to him,
Finally sharing the story of their wedding, lacking in sentiment though it had been, was a huge weight off his chest as well. He wished he could have told John earlier. He wished he had simply told him without waiting for John to ask. Perhaps he would have understood then. Or perhaps he would have insisted on a divorce far earlier than he eventually had done.
"Good idea," John said, smiling. "God, this smells fantastic. That dry food and dog biscuits weren't half crap to a dog's palate but I'll be glad to never see them again."
Luckily, his actions had not gone unnoticed.
He had researched weddings extensively and silence definitely didn’t play any part in them unless it was of the hushed, reverent sort.
He made himself walk up the stairs as naturally as possible, trying his best to pretend that everything was normal. Which of course it wasn't.
"You all right?"
*****
He knew he would have to tread carefully today. He couldn't stand too close or say the wrong thing or even give the wrong (or rather: the right) impression. If anyone were to comment and mistake them for a couple, he knew John would vehemently deny the assumption and then retreat so far into his shell it would take weeks to get him out again. And Sherlock knew he didn't have weeks.
- I have two Sherlock crossovers and some other stories in the works that are in various stages of being unfinished so far (that's what NaNo exists for!) - look forward to seeing at least one of them in spring 2019.
But John is angry now. "Seriously, if I ever get my hands on a TARDIS, I will travel back in time and kick everyone in the nuts who ever made you feel like you are anything but the most amazing man I've ever seen."
John woke in a warm bed, soft sunlight streaming through a gap in the curtains. He stretched and groaned softly as various muscle groups complained. He didn't mind. There wasn't a single ache he wouldn't mind feeling all over again if only he could get up the energy to wake Sherlock and repeat the entire thing.
Sherlock nodded. "Yes. Yes, we have. Good thing we finally admitted that."
“Describe her to me,” the officer said, glanced at him and added. “What she looked like, I mean, not her personal history.”
John gulped, trying desperately to remind himself that Sherlock was definitely in no way responsible for what he was saying. Not even remotely. Maybe someone had spiked one of his drinks with something. The prostitute seemed like a good suspect.
"I never doubted it for a second," John said. "You bloody genius."
Sherlock sighs. He hasn't even glanced at his phone. "John ..."
"He said he'd spend Christmas with someone named Anderson if it got him out of having to deal with his brother," Mrs Hudson says, shaking her head. "Those two..."
"Yes." And Sherlock looked so certain as he said it, as if no alternative had ever occurred to him, as if it was obvious. Perhaps it was to him.
Yet even as he thought it, Sherlock knew he would never change designations even if it was possible.
"We've got a huge family get-together on Christmas Eve," Sally replies. "I know most of the UK does the whole presents and food thing on Christmas Day but in my family, we've always done it on Christmas Eve so we can have two full days to recover from the feast. What about you?"
"Married?" Mrs Hudson echoed. "So soon after Sherlock?"
Lestrade leaned forward eagerly, then frowned. "That's a newspaper."
There weren't many people around at this time of the evening and the bandstand stood empty. It was a good place to meet. An open space where no one could sneak up on them to listen in on their conversation. Their contact must be feeling very secure in his anonymity if he didn't think twice about being so exposed.
The wind whipped through his fur and he barked again as the sheer joy of running at top speed took him. He all but shot across the large field, swerving every now and then to avoid random trees or people stretched out on picnic blankets.
"It would have been his own damn fault," Sherlock said, impatiently shifting his hips to get some friction.
"Oh, is that supposed to reassure me?" John demanded, opening the door to their room with more force than strictly necessary. "Because it really doesn't."
Sometimes, he simply forgot that Johnny the dog was also John the human, with all the senses and appearance of a dog but the intellectual capacity and personality of his human persona. Which was why Sherlock had thought nothing of indulging a little this morning when they encountered the soldiers in the park.
bothered him. He wondered, too, where it came from. Why should he be worried about any of this? They were friends. Currently, one of them was a dog. Physical contact was important; canines communicated mostly by using body language, after all. And Sherlock had always enjoyed the company of dogs. They were honest. They didn't even know how to lie. No matter if they liked you or hated you, they made sure you knew either way. It was uncomplicated and thus in many ways preferable to humans with their conflicting signals and their expectation of you to understand the things they left unsaid.
Mary was in high spirits all day and clearly pleased with his attention. He watched her try on dresses for two hours and finally paid for the one she selected, a lovely light blue one that complimented her eyes. The left the shop arm in arm, returned home for a bit of a rest and to get changed, and made off to the restaurant.
To be entrusted with John’s pain, to be allowed to help him through it, was more than Sherlock had ever fathomed possible.
John took another deep breath, straightened and sat down next to Sherlock on the sun-warmed rock.
He held Sherlock's gaze, making sure his words registered. Sherlock nodded, that smile stealing across his face again. It was breathtaking.
And so here they were, just the two of them in a city in Sweden at Christmas. He had to hand it to Sherlock - he was cold and feeling amused and intrigued despite himself and he had been enjoying himself from the moment they had stepped off the plane. So perhaps this idea of a distraction was actually working.
See you next time!
Sherlock looked frightfully pale in the stark white hospital bed and John was grateful for an excuse to look away.
That John had had the nerve to tell him to just go and shag whomever he wanted! As if it was that easy. Perhaps it was for him? But Sherlock wasn't like that, couldn't even fathom how people just looked at random strangers and chose to take them to their bed, as easily as getting groceries.
Sherlock was wearing a black suit with a dinner jacket that had a slight shimmer to its lapels and beneath that was a plum-coloured shirt similar to one he used to own years ago. He filled it in much better now and looked absolutely gorgeous in it.
"What the hell happened?"
"Well then, since you're back in action, how about we go see what Lestrade has been up to?"
Sherlock dared to give him a heated look. "I'd have to agree."
John shoved all thoughts of that particular decoration out of his mind and refocused on the punch bowl. "Alright then. Care to share a glass?"
"When are you going to do it?," John asked. Sherlock could feel his eyes on him as he took off his Belstaff and started clearing it of the larger dust mites that had attached themselves to it in the attic. As soon as they got back to London, a trip to the dry cleaners was in order.
want to touch. Having you offer them must have been like Christmas coming early."
Sherlock grinned. "So I suggest we get dry and have something to eat. I have a feeling we might need the energy."
“Perhaps someone gave him a hint,” John continued happily, dragging Sherlock along. “But what do I know? You’re the genius detective here. What do you deduce, Mr Holmes?”
He hadn't expected to have a panic attack in the middle of the night but here it was and he clung to Sherlock and tried to breathe while he waited for it to ease. There was a low rumbling sound and he focused on that until the words became clear.
*****
"Thank you," John murmured against his shoulder, gave him one last squeeze and started to step back.
Sherlock's blood ran cold.
Sherlock sighed and turned back to John. "There, you heard him. Bark once if you can see red and green."
"He's a doctor," Sherlock said with a shrug. "You know, all the talk about lung cancer and so on and so forth." He took a defiant drag from his cigarette. John decided to berate him for that later. "What about you, then?"
He shuddered, Molly's words still echoing in his mind.
“Fair enough” John said and forced himself not to read anything (much) into the fact that Sherlock had said
"So I did," John conceded. "And I'll keep going, now that I've finally got you used to a normal schedule."
He was probably right about that. Several well-chosen words would have been enough to send the man running, John was sure. And yet ... "Why did you say no?"
"Oh, of course. Do come in!"
John beamed at him. "God, I'll never get tired of the sight of this," he murmured.
"And helping you with that would be so much easier if you told me what your theory actually is."
John spent that evening wondering if perhaps it was time to try and shift. His one-night stand with Amber the previous night had helped settle him somewhat, his body's desperate hunger for touch sated for the time being. He was relaxed and didn't expect any catastrophes that might cause him undue distress, so it was probably as safe as it could possibly be.
John was staring at him with something that could only be called 'intent' and it sent an almost violent shiver down his spine.
"Ah, John. It is good to see you in your correct body again. I take it the procedure went well?"
"For a random
John froze.
Sherlock sat up in one fluid motion, putting his head between his knees and trying to breathe.
John couldn’t even argue with him and he hated that. He wanted to argue but he knew that Sherlock was right. Three lives? Hell, John would have done it for complete strangers.
There was a pen in his hand and a pile of blank paper on the table in front of him. John blinked at them for a bit before he remembered. Right.
John sat on an uncomfortable plastic chair in a bland hospital hallway, clutching his second paper cup of coffee and wishing he had actually found a moment to sleep.
"Pretty straightforward," John commented.
Sherlock smiled sadly. "You not noticing was rather the point."
And now here she sits, surrounded by boxes full of her stuff in a dingy subterranean flat. Mrs Hudson has managed to get rid of the mould but never got around to actually putting the flat up for rent. Sally is proud of herself for insisting on paying rent. She won't have to for her old flat, not with it being unfit to live in. Mrs Hudson refuses to let her pay the full rent the flat should be worth, which is just as well because Sally knows she wouldn't be able to afford it.
John shook his head. "Yeah but that's not an excuse. I shouldn't have attacked you. It wasn't .... good."
John responded gladly, moaning softly as their kiss deepened again, and let the hunger another inch off its leash.
"Here, help me with this."
Sherlock looked honestly baffled at the idea. "Of course not. I know every corner of my mind palace, John. Why on earth would I get lost in it? You don't get lost in Baker Street, do you?"
Sherlock opened his mouth but John was too focused on getting the words out to notice. “Someone whom I can love in return."
Turning the suggestion over in his mind, Sherlock looked at Mycroft. His brother shrugged. "If you consider your landlady trustworthy enough, I do not see how it could become a problem."
"Why do any of this?" he managed to ask. "The changelings I get - but why the Psy?"
He had always wondered about Sherlock's parents. A mathematician didn't surprise him at all. He wondered what Sherlock's father was like. He must be quite fearsome, to be happily married to a brilliant woman and raise two equally brilliant sons with her. John wondered at his profession. Astrophysics? But no, Sherlock didn't know shit about the solar system. Perhaps a chemistry professor or something.
Finally, he opened his eyes again, nodded once, turned, and walked back to the house.
The woman pursed her lips. "It appears, Dr Watson, that you are already married."
"They got him."
*****
"Can't we just go back to bed?" John asked. "We can wait for Lestrade to call us there and-"
There are interviews. Lots and lots of interviews. John and Sherlock both came along to the Yard, John furious in his disbelief and Sherlock mute. Sally can almost see the wheels turning in his head, sees the way he looks at Mary, reassesses, re-deduces. She sees the moment he finds whatever he was looking for, sees the flash of terror in his eyes, quickly hidden, as it clicks into place.
"Something I didn't mention about this token," he murmured against Sherlock's mouth. "The interest rates are extremely steep."
Sherlock blinked. “That’s in an account in France. I don’t think I’ve even looked at a statement about it in the past fifteen years or so.”
Perhaps one day, he would learn how to love John out loud, to actually put it in words. Right now, he could already feel the beginnings of the dissonance setting in again as his TK reserves slowly recharged.
London at night was more input than John remembered. He shuddered to think how changelings had fared even 50 years ago, before the last fuel-driven cars had been replaced by something sustainable that wouldn't poison the very air they breathed.
"That's fine, I wasn't really expecting anything. What's your opinion on Mrs Forsythe. Possible suspect?"
But when he searched for any emotion coming from Sherlock through their bond, there was not a smidgeon of fear to be found.
John ran. With his eyes fixed on the stick he tried to calculate where it would start to descend and extrapolated a likely landing zone, then sped up in order to reach it in time.
John, dazed, stared at the ceiling and tried to blink the black spots away. His head ached, a dull, throbbing pulse above his right ear.
"I'm sorry," he says and Sally thinks she may faint after all.
"You should go to bed," she said softly. "The sofa is not a good place to sleep and you must be exhausted."
Sherlock changed out of his tuxedo as soon as he arrived at home. He exchanged it for his usual suit, just in case he found himself wanting to go out again despite the lateness of the evening.
Donovan actually took a step back and raised her hands a little. "Oi, don't start with me. It's your head that's going to roll."
John gave a low rumble that sounded like reassurance, though Sherlock could not quite tell what made him think so.
"How is my brother?"
They spent the rest of the night playing a children's clapping game to get Sherlock used to casual contact. Trying to deduce when John might try to clasp his hands next kept his mind engaged and John's quicker reflexes evened out the playing field enough to keep it interesting.
John blinked. Why had Sherlock gone to see the WhiteSpot pack? Had they found him somehow? No, they wouldn't go near a Psy without good reason and the only reason they had right now was bloody revenge. Sherlock appeared unharmed. So why had he gone looking for them? He must have spent hours in their company - John could clearly make out Emily and even Tyson, who was far too sceptical of Psy to voluntarily be around one of them.
"Has your landlord given a time frame for when your flat will be inhabitable again?" he finally asks.
"Now," John repeats, closing the door to the hallway behind him. "I'm ready now."
"Never mind, dear," Mrs Hudson said before John could think of something else to throw. "He's just a grouch."
"Of course." He hesitated, rubbed the back of his neck. "So you're, uh, leaving again?"
"To prevent the killer from running away in the dead of night, should the mood strike them," Sherlock said. "It would be a shame if they suddenly remembered a pressing engagement and left, seeing as in ..." he glanced at his watch, "approximately twenty minutes the police will be here to make an arrest."
"Posture," Sherlock said. "Look at his legs - at perfect angles, straight lines, shoes polished to a gleam, not a fold out of place on his trousers. The newspaper is also held at a perfect angle. No human sits like that."
"You sound awfully sure," Lestrade noted, crossing his arms. "What aren't you telling me?"
"And one more thing," Judd said and now he was grinning. "You need to find a way to channel your TK. I may have disabled your triggers but your TK will still run rampant when you are engaged in any sort of physical and emotional intimacy. My mate and I have had to replace the furniture several times already. It is not easy to keep control."
John folded the paper and carefully put it in his pocket. It was old and who was he kidding ... Sherlock wouldn't write down relevant information. He would keep it safely locked away in that big brain of his where no one else could access it.
"He has?" Lestrade asked, sounding like he didn't know whether to be doubtful or pleased. "Well?"
John opened the fridge, blindly reached inside and pulled out the note, which he held up in front of the detective's face. It said:
"Give him an order," Sherlock suggested.
John shrugged. "I tried. But we just ended up arguing every time we got anywhere near the topic. And I honestly couldn't handle thinking about it. At first I thought it had been his idea and he'd just coerced me into it, but I quickly realised that was bullshit. He does many fucked up things but he wouldn't ever do that. And he was honestly horrified when I suggested it. He said it was my idea. Which doesn't make much sense, because why would I suggest getting married out of the blue?"
. If he hadn't known before, surely he could not be left in any doubt about it now.
It was inexplicable.
Sherlock looked up when John shuffled in. His hair was a mess and at least he had changed into his pyjamas at some point, but he was clearly wide awake and probably hadn't even tried to go to bed. He was sitting in the middle of the room, surrounded by books and pieces of paper in his own messy handwriting.
John wished he could get a look at his face but Sherlock clearly didn't want the other man to know they weren't alone, so he had to contend himself with staying where he was and listening intently.
Several long minutes passed, he wasn't sure how many, before he became aware of someone else's presence in the flat.
"Hey," John said happily. "Hoped you'd be in. Listen, Mary's gone off to meet some of her friends and I saw this advert on the tube. The Science Museum has a new exhibition going on that I thought we could check out. Want to come?"
"Stop that, John," he said, leaning back a little and using both hands to fend John off. "What has gotten into you? I've only been gone for a couple of hours!"
"That's not the only trouble with scars, though," John pointed out. "No one seeing those could think of you as anything but brave. But if the scars don't heal well, you might experience movement restrictions due to the skin tightness. Have you been putting anything on them?"
"Still sorting through the information?" John asked, bending to remove his shoes.
The door was slightly ajar, the lights out, the curtains closed. Sherlock had switched off all the lights in the flat before going to bed but John didn't need his eyes to know his friend was still there. Not when his nose could smell him so clearly, his familiar scent like a beacon.
"I'm not
Sherlock hesitated. He hadn't expected this to come up tonight. But then again, when else?
John nodded. "Listen, can we ... talk for a moment?"
John swallowed. "God, you're gorgeous."

He gestured towards the monstrosity.
Sherlock shrugged. "A murdered relative, most likely. We know she did a lot of dirty work, it wouldn't be much of a stretch to expect someone to take revenge. I know I would not hesitate if something happened to you."
She nodded. “Right. Still, if you need anything you only have to say the word. We all know one of the other teams is still looking into all angles-” she rolled her eyes “-but you’re among friends here.”
"Indeed."
"Don't want what?"
John barked.
God, John was warm. Warm and solid and
John sighed but didn't really want to let go anyway, so he held on, rubbing his hand up and down Sherlock's back. "How are you feeling?"
They sat and John went about making the tea. He ignored Sherlock, just as they had agreed in the handful of seconds they had had before Mrs Hudson opened the door and let in their visitors. Well, he pretended to ignore Sherlock but his senses were all attuned to him, picking up every breath and movement. Sherlock was doing a great job pretending to be completely engrossed in whatever it was he was doing. John thought he might be reading the news or playing a memory game.
There was a moment of silence as the changelings in the room remembered their history lessons about the Territorial Wars. They were still fresh in everyone's mind. Only the youngest packs had not lost members or friends to the vicious bloodshed that had spanned large parts of the world. The British Isles had only caught the edges of it as most of their packs had been (and still were) too small to be involved, but they still remembered.
Sherlock opened his mouth and found he didn't know what to say.
Sherlock snorted, avoiding his brother's sharp gaze. "It was more a case of him being too exhausted to argue. He's sleeping in meeting room 3b down the hall."
Sherlock smiled. He did. A month into this, he did. "It doesn't hurt to hear it again."
Mary doesn't reply. There is nothing she could say anyway.
“See that you do,” Sherlock said haughtily.
John thought he might have laughed but the sound died in his throat. “Probably. God ... what do I do?”
“John,” Sherlock called softly. “John!”
John nodded in agreement. "Even for a changeling it's close to impossible. Members of the same pack know each other by sight and scent, of course, but I'm not sure how well that would work for the birds. You'd have to ask Sergeant Donovan if she could match a changeling bird who wasn't part of her wing to a changeling in his human form if she saw him on the street."
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Yes, thank you for your input."
He finished his shower, blow-dried and gelled his hair into submission and walked back into the room they shared in nothing but his pants to collect his clothes. It was worth it just for the gob-smacked look on John’s face. Pretending nothing was out of the ordinary, Sherlock got dressed and turned towards him expectantly.
And she dragged him along, introducing him to their alpha and the other members of the pack that was now technically also his. They were lovely people, if a bit rough around the edges, and John's parents seemed to be the only ones who took offense to his being male, though there were a few raised eyebrows at the fact that he was Psy.
Both hands followed the path of the whip marks, long, angry red slashes running diagonally across his back from his right shoulder to his left hip, criss-crossing every so often.
He glances at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye and hurriedly looks away again. Sherlock is staring out the window, watching the city pass by with a pensive expression on his face, and he looks like he should be on the front of a high-end magazine. The fact that he's sitting in the same car as John instead seems to be some sort of grand universal mistake.
John gaped at him. "And you didn't think to tell me this?"
John licked his lips, uncertain how to go from here. He was aware that his desire was too much. It didn't fit the neat parameters of friendship and certainly wasn't something that should ever be applied to a Psy. Particularly if the Psy in question was not only determined to use touch as a way to strengthen his Silence rather than breaking it, but also when that Psy happened to be the brother of one of the powerful members of the Psy Council. There were only so many risks worth taking and this one was too big to not consider it carefully.
"There's only one plate and cup," Sherlock reminded him.
he thought and it felt like a part of him was dying.
The Psy in question looked faintly amused, which had to be a trick of the light because Psy didn't know what humour was.
"I'm not brooding," Sherlock said. He hadn't turned around or given any other indication that he had noticed John's approach but he certainly didn't seem surprised at his presence.
He held out his phone to show John the screen. Sherlock had sent a single word.
Sherlock shook his head. "Not yet. It will take at least one or two weeks for them to come up with an antiserum and then there will be a testing period to ensure it isn't harmful or has any undesired side effects. Until then, all we can do is wait and go on as we have."
"Wrong answer again. Come on, I'm treating you to dinner."
Sherlock hummed in agreement. Whatever it was John had meant to add - fantastic, glorious, a bloody stupid idea - he could only agree.
His voice wavered on the last sentence and he took another deep breath, another lungful of John-scented air.
"Lestrade says the results of the drug test were negative. The substance they found in the son's flat was some sort of skin powder. They're still trying to figure out what kind precisely."
"How was the girlfriend?" Sherlock asked.
He was close to drifting off when John finally spoke again. “I can’t fault you for that,” he said, voice quiet and oddly pained. “And I don’t know how I ever managed to give you that impression when all I ever wanted was to have you here with me. Sometimes I think I don’t know myself very well.”
Sherlock blinks. John wasn't the one asking? That's ...
He smiles to himself as he packs away Sherlock's purchases. It's nice to have physical evidence that Sherlock cares about Rosie and takes his duties as godfather seriously. Then again, John supposes he shouldn't be surprised. Not after Sherlock put every professional wedding planner to shame for his and Mary's wedding.
Before Mycroft or Sherlock - or possibly even Lestrade, who was just sucking in a breath to speak - could do anything, John took the leap ... and was perhaps most surprised of all to find himself standing quite firmly on all four legs, the way a dog was supposed to.
"Sorry," Sherlock rasped, looking stricken. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean..."
By this point, Sherlock seemed to have caught on to what John was trying to say.
"I rather envy you," Sherlock grumbled as he poured food into John's bowl and also over John's nose when he stuck it into the bowl far too soon in his eagerness. "I can't be bothered to cook tonight."
Sherlock nodded, glowering at the bed covers. "Fine. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."
, you mean,” John corrected. “I doubt god had anything to do with
Oh, it had hurt. He couldn’t possibly describe how much it had hurt to come home to find all his hopes being ground to dust before his very eyes. But given the choice, he would still do it all over again if only to keep John safe. He had accomplished that much at least. For the longest time, he had told himself that was enough.
doesn't, I will."
John tugged at his hand, drawing his gaze back down to him. "You do know that's not how it ends, right? You do know there's a second part to that saying, don't you?"
"Well then, John's sister has checked into rehab again and he has gone to Scotland to be close to her and offer his support," Sherlock suggested. "He will be gone for an indeterminable length of time and I will of course be getting regular texts and e-mails from him."
"She's mated."
John pursed his lips. "They wouldn't go around sharing that information though, would they?"
The look he got in response to that was one that said that John was utterly done with his shit.
"I developed a nosebleed and lost consciousness," Sherlock said. "That scared him, I think. He got very angry with me. Well, and with the Psy in general for the way we live. He called it cruel and barbaric, just as you did."
He couldn't help himself - he reached out and grasped John's hand, marvelling at the feeling of soft warm skin beneath his fingertips as he brushed his thumb over the back of John's hand.
Desire is written all over his face but there is something else there, too, something Sherlock knows is mirrored on his own: joy.
"It helps pass the time."
John barked lowly.
A bit of a shorter one this time - I chose to combine the original chapters 14 and 15 in last week's chapter, which messed up the lengths. It should all be back to a more regular length next week. Thank you for all your lovely comments, you guys always make my day1
Yet he didn't seem to have any issue with that, or with being close to John. In fact, he did such a good job of being near John that all the other guests and the hotel staff were utterly convinced they were a couple and believed it wholeheartedly, despite the fact that neither of them had ever actually confirmed it or acted in an overly affectionate manner.
John clears his throat. "Sorry about earlier, by the way."
He looks away and strides past her to the door. "Enjoy dinner."
Sherlock slowly removed his arms from around John's body - not a position he had thought he would ever find himself in. He stayed bent over him, though, ever watchful in case he lost his balance and fell again.
They sit in silence for a while, digesting that. Sally is still struggling with the concept of Sherlock Holmes caring about other people but all the evidence points in that direction.
"When will you be back?" Sherlock asks, switching off the telly and standing as well.
It was almost a mercy the current situation was as it was. If John had been human, there was no telling what Sherlock would have done. Perhaps gotten even more worked up and more quickly, too. It happened once in a while, after all, and he didn't want to imagine what might have happened if he had been this horny with a human John in the flat and so soon after running into a whole troop of soldiers.
“I’ll remind you of that when you’re seventy-five and struggling to get up,” John told him, clearly unaware of what it did to Sherlock to hear John making plans that reached so far into the future.
It was indeed Mycroft and now that he was ensconced in their flat, surrounded by their own familiar scent and reasonably safe from having a panic attack, John was finally able to pay attention to what his nose was telling him about the other man.
Sherlock mentally marked off at least two suspicious Councillor deaths as solved.
John didn't know, didn't dare let himself think that what he had seen was a split second of longing, didn't allow himself to think like that. Because Sherlock had already made his stance clear on that subject and John was being an idiot right now.
Sherlock considered this theory. "Yes. Yes, that makes perfect sense. We'll get Molly to confirm but this killer obviously does his research. Clearly he doesn't understand changeling physicality all that well, though, so he got the dose wrong."
"Thanks for the warning," he murmured to Greg again and walked over to the body, making sure to approach Sherlock from the side, which earned him a nod from Donovan and slight softening of her scowl.
"Stop thinking," Sherlock told him, dragging John's head down for a kiss. "It's distracting."
"I do," he assured her. "But I also want to salvage our friendship and if I make him sign these papers by force, it will all go up in flames. This is important to me, Mary."
Molly grins. "I just might."
Sherlock groaned and opened his eyes.
It was only natural that, if his body ever managed to override Sherlock's supremely rational mind, John would be the one he turned to. Years of trust and their mutual comfort with each other's personal space (a concept that had never really existed between them) would make it all the easier to move their relationship to an entirely new level.
*****
John, now fully awake and with his eyes wide open, blinked at him. "Don't what?"
Sherlock frowned. "Not good?"
(See the end of the chapter for
have a dog?" Donovan demanded rudely, marching towards them. "Did John get fed up and found you substitute?"
"Whenever that happens," Mary muttered, but she softened a little.
"Sherlock, I really don't have time for-"
“Don’t worry about it. We’re going shopping - perhaps I can talk Sherlock into getting an electric fan that he won’t take apart in a moment of boredom,” John reassured her, privately already determined to stop by that fantastic bakery in the shopping centre to get Mrs Hudson a treat. That woman worked far too hard for her age and deserved a bit of pampering.
They reached the Crags after about an hour’s casual stroll and found a flat rock to sit on and enjoy the view of the city with the sea stretching away to the east and the Pentland Hills rising up in the northwest.
“Please sit down, Dr Watson,” the officer urged, reaching for his shoulder to press him back into his chair. “Mr Holmes is currently being interviewed by one of my colleagues. You can see him when we are done.”
Outside, they could hear wheels crunching on gravel as several cars rolled to a stop.
home rather than his. Almost 10 months had passed since his return and yet the thought of John living anywhere but 221b Baker Street was still incomprehensible, catching him off-guard each and every time the topic arose, like reaching the end of a stairwell and expecting one more step that just wasn't there.
John nodded, blithely accepting his painfully vague answer. Sometimes Sherlock wasn't sure if John really was that oblivious or if he simply chose to let Sherlock get away with it, like indulging a small child in his imaginary games.
Ten minutes later, he found himself under the hot spray of the shower, his muscles twitching and limbs trembling as the last of the completely displaced adrenaline ebbed away and his body began to relax. He could hear John walking around the flat.
“Go away, Graham,” he said tiredly. “We’ll get back to the interviews once John feels up for it.”
And if he got skin privileges with Sherlock out of the deal, who was he to complain?
"No, I know that. I apologise, I was merely overreacting."
Sherlock has been standing in the middle of John's bedroom for several minutes now, silently staring, unable to tear his gaze away. He meant to wake him, drag him off to St. Bart's so they can have a look at the hands Molly texted him about yesterday, but then he walked into John's bedroom and all his plans were derailed.
"Be careful, little brother," he said instead and hung up. It was just as well, because Sherlock wasn't in the mood to lie to him.
"Pardon?"
"Could be hacked," Sherlock said easily. "I believe there is another list hidden somewhere in the Council's archives on the Net, but trying to access that would potentially kill me if Nikita Duncan was in any way involved in the security measures."
He couldn't even get enough inflection into his voice to make it a question.
"If you're quite finished?" Sherlock said, sounding impatient.
He turned the laptop around so John could read the e-mail, then tried not to stare at John's lips. He had the most frustrating habit of moving them ever so slightly as he read to himself.
"Less than half a minute coverage," Sherlock commented, shaking his head. "Finally there's a boring murder that suddenly becomes a very interesting murder and they hardly bother to mention it at all."
John thought that was a rather offensive comment about his character and gave a short warning growl.
He got up from his crouched position on the ground, stretching strained muscles as he surveyed the scene surrounding the body. There was nothing there to catch his interest, nothing to indicate anything but what he had already deduced had occurred here. What a shame. There was always the chance of something interesting about dead people outside their homes, but this one was so obviously a father-son quarrel he really didn't know why Lestrade had bothered to call him at all.
There was no harm in it, after all, and Sherlock's touch was gentle and careful. He even went so far as to give him verbal warnings such as "I'm going to turn your ear inside-out, make a sound if this hurts" and "I want to touch your canines, don't bite my finger off".
John released a shuddering breath. "Me neither."
It was a cosy affair with a large double-bed that looked like you could drown in it, a desk, TV and two comfortable-looking armchairs squeezed into a corner. The bathroom wasn’t big but enough for the two of them and they weren’t going to be spending too much time in their room anyway. Not with an entire city to explore and re-familiarise themselves with.
John, on the other hand, did not fall into that category. He was the one person Sherlock actually turned to for the simple sake of companionship, friendship even. It was a privilege John was proud to have and one that he would fight until his last breath to keep.
, for god's sake!
Shortly afterward some of the other guests arrived, including the Walczaks and the identical twin sisters whose names John didn't know yet. Sherlock probably did, so he resolved to ask him later. Better to know who he was dealing with. It wasn't as if he could chat them up - he wouldn't even know which of the two to go for, for one thing.
John woke to find long arms wrapped around him and the pleasant sensation of someone kissing the base of his throat.
It remained unsaid that Sherlock would not be extended the same courtesy.
He would have known the moment he next saw John, of course, but at least it would have spared him having to sit around the flat, wondering with every passing moment what John was doing and whether he was going to come home before morning. Drinking himself into oblivion had worked spectacularly well in that regard.
Patricia made pretend gagging noises into her glass, winking at them at the same time. "Were you ever like this?" she asked, turning to the Walczaks, who sat at the other end of the long table, playing a game of cards.
Perhaps it was time to try for something more hopeful, something better. Something he had been waiting to do for so long now. Perhaps it was time.
John shook his head, then hesitated and rearranged the tiles into a row of crosses.
All things considered, everything went much simpler and quicker than Sherlock could have ever hoped, and it was barely a week after John's visit that he stepped off the helicopter Mycroft had sent (again) to spare Redbeard the transport box and all passengers and crew of any given aeroplane the presence of an antsy Sherlock Holmes.
John lifted Sherlock's other hand to his face as well, pressing a soft kiss to his knuckles. "Including this one?"
"All the more reason to get in quickly," John said. "Wouldn't want to risk hypothermia."
*****
"Well what else was I supposed to do?" Sherlock asked, as if that was in any way a justifiable reason.
"Mrs Hudson made us join her for lunch," Sherlock lied. "I left my phone upstairs."
Sherlock rolled his eyes at him but John saw the corner of his mouth twitch in a hidden smile.
"She's good at that," Sherlock confirmed. "Very cool head in a crisis. You should have seen her back in Florida when I had her husband arrested. Her first question was how quickly she could get a divorce and come back to England."
Greg grimaced. "I hope I didn't pull you away from anything important."
The words hit him right in the solar plexus but John knew he had no right to argue, to make demands. There was nothing he could say to make Sherlock believe him, nothing that wouldn't sound utterly manipulative after all that Sherlock had confessed to.
John has to agree - their target has been looking at them every now and then with a frown.
The kettle boiled and he strode into the kitchen to flick it off and pour himself a cuppa, wishing he could at least press one into Sherlock's hands and get some liquid into his mate.
Sherlock blinked.
Once he had finally eaten his fill and an astonishing two hours and eighteen minutes had passed (and forty-eight seconds, as Sherlock insisted on pointing out), John ended up letting Sherlock examine his teeth, eyes, ears, paws and claws.
"I'm 100% convinced," John assured him and tried to squash down on the unease in his stomach at the thought. "You couldn't be more stunning if you tried."
"All I wanted was to come home to you," he admitted softly. "It was all I thought about for those two years. And then I did and saw you in that restaurant and I knew what was about to happen."
Finally, Lestrade turned to leave. "They're not back here, either. Probably somewhere further inside the building. This place is a maze," they heard him call and everything was silent again.
"Thank you very much for stopping by, Mr Holmes. If there is anything else I can help you with or you learn anything new, please do let me know."
Shaking his head, John took a deep breath, shoved all thoughts of kissing Sherlock senseless resolutely away and made to follow his friend.
, huh?" she asks him.
"Our," John corrected. "She's our daughter. Or near enough. Mycroft texted to say we've got an appointment tomorrow to sign the papers."
The intense humidity was wreaking havoc on his friend’s hair, the once carefully tamed strands now a veritable riot of messy curls that made John’s fingers itch to touch. Sherlock seemed utterly oblivious to both the state of his hair and John’s reaction to it, which was probably for the best.
They stared at each other, John at the foot of Sherlock's bed. Sherlock struggled upright again. "It was worth it," he said firmly, even though his voice was cracking around the edges of the words. "It was all worth it to keep you alive. I'd do it again in a heartbeat."
Thank you for your comments and your kudos and subscriptions and the (very entertaining) yelling and cursing in my inbox. I loved every single bit of it and I cannot wait to see you again for the next fic!
John couldn't bear another moment of this. "Why didn't you tell me?"
Clearly he could not be suggesting what Sherlock
"But you don't," he said, hoping the sudden agony he felt wasn't in his voice. "Do you?"
"I am open to negotiations."
"Okay." John squeezed Sherlock's hand. "Then we have a deal."
He wasn't deluding himself - Mycroft would have been tracking, or at least trying to track, his every move for hours. He was certain they hadn't realised he had gone to the train depot or an entire squad would have burst in there.
"We should keep him," Lestrade wheezed. "It'd make catching criminals so much easier."
Sherlock sighed and checked his phone for any messages from Molly, then slipped it into the inside pocket of his jacket. "Fine, let's go. Where's your ball?"
A muffled bark drew his attention and he turned his head to see Redbeard running towards him, tail wagging and ears flopping, his brown fur shining like copper in the sun. He was carrying a stick that was just this side of too big for him and almost tripped over his own legs in his excitement.
John frowned, clearly suspicious. That was fair - out of the two of them, it was rare for Sherlock to be the reasonable one in these things. And yet here they were.
"Only you look a bit ..." John hesitated, waving his hand vaguely. "... distressed."
*****
"Will you get in trouble?"
"And you dressing up as a French waiter didn't?"
Sherlock sighed, feeling the weight of all he had done. "John ... you do know I'm sorry, right? Because I am. If there had been another way-"
"... going to be home soon," John was saying.
Then, after meeting John, he had thought that if he ever lost John, it might feel like this. A solid punch to the sternum, smashing through skin and muscle and bone, leaving him impaled, helpless and dying.
John grinned. "Well, how could I say no to an offer li-"
Sherlock follows this time instead of standing there passively. When their lips meet, his mouth is already half open and
Sherlock gasped and pulled his mouth away.
It was comfortable and warm and John thought he would happily spend a couple more hours in this way when Sherlock shifted in his sleep, accidentally revealing that his problem from the previous morning seemed to be back as well.
After sixteen months in Afghanistan with its blazing heat, he was no longer used to the English weather. Yes, the nights in the desert had been freezing, but they had still been dry. Dry and full of sand and blood and adrenaline.
"Yes John?"
"I'm ... he could kill you," John said, ignoring the curious pack of Foxes surrounding them. Some things needed to be said out loud.
Talking to him as if he were simply a person - and Sherlock hoped he still was - seemed to be the most obvious course of action, so that was exactly what he did. Lestrade's interference annoyed him but seemed to calm John somewhat. And the idea of showing John what he looked like seemed to have some merit, so he snapped a picture and showed it to him.
He decided not to play this game. Not this time.
“Feel better now?” he asked hopefully.
"Oh. Right." John shook his head. Of course it was and of course Lestrade would think that was what they were doing.
"You, feeling like ..." He gestured between them.
And the way he shied away from the idea was just another reason why it was the only correct option.
“Is it?” John asked softly.
He laughed and was horrified to realise it sounded a bit wet. "And say what exactly? He doesn't want to hear any of it. He even asked me about our wedding the other day. Wanted to know why we got married and when I told him it was because he had wanted to, he just nodded and walked away and he hasn't mentioned it since. It's like he's deliberately avoiding the issue and I can't tell if it's because he knows and doesn't want me to say it out loud, or because he doesn't know and is afraid of finding out anything that would throw his neatly arranged idea of who we are into disarray."
"And he agreed?"
They barely stopped long enough to put down their bags and refresh themselves a little before they went out for a stroll along the Royal Mile and lunch.
Special things go to my dear friend Sniper_clam, without whom I would not have read these books and this story wouldn't exist. Go read her Avengers/Jumanji crossover!
Because Sherlock had kissed him.
There was a short pause as Mycroft considered his words.
"I think I prefer this outcome," John agreed, winking at him.
John flinched as the driver slammed the trunk lid closed and Sherlock actually tightened his fingers in his fur for a moment. Of course. He should have expected the improved senses. At least that explained why John had been moving so gingerly all the way from the lab to the car. He had assumed it was due to lingering unsteadiness on his feet but now it became glaringly apparent that the sensory input must be quite overwhelming.
“Right, yeah. Lead on.”
Stay tuned for more of my fics. I've got several Johnlock stories in the works where our favourite idiots get to be the main characters again so we can all suffer together. I hope to see you in the comments when I start posting the first of them soon.
"I knew I wouldn't be able to stand it, so I took ... precautions. When we returned here right after it happened, I made you go take a shower, remember?"
Sherlock thought he might expire from happiness.
"Oh." John struggled upright as well. "Actually, I said I wanted to be married to someone I
John rose up on his knees, leaning forward, one of his hands rising to touch Sherlock's cheek. "Not quite."
He shifted ever so slightly, just enough to make Sherlock aware of John’s unmistakable erection pressed against his arse, a wordless reassurance that John was in the same boat as him.
The first time they made love would have brought them both to their knees if they hadn't been lying down anyway, that very night in their newly shared bedroom. They had managed to refrain in France, mostly because they had both been too overwhelmed by everything else to add any more upheaval on top.
"Upstairs, having a nap," Sherlock pushes a cup towards her. "Sit down and tell me everything."
"There was something I wanted to ask, actually, since you're both here," he said, glancing around uneasily.
"And you
"Hello there," John managed, voice hoarse. "Sorry, don't have any treats for you."
Sherlock had not gone far. He sat about twenty feet downhill in the grass, his head in his hands. The mere sight of him made John's heart hurt.
Sherlock blinked, then decided to just go with it and relaxed. "Precisely."
"I could take a picture and show it to you," he suggested. "If you're having trouble seeing it yourself." He grinned. "Dog or no, there's nothing stopping you from being your own doctor after all."
"It depends on how hard you try."
Next week: bath time ...
He whistled as he walked into their sitting room, leaving his Psy to recover from his surprise and deal with the carrots.
He knew his Psy would be unlikely to tell him about it, but it didn't matter. Anger in itself was already an improvement, a sign of progress. Anger was a rather volatile emotion. Not something Psy usually experienced. John thought of all their furniture floating around the flat, thought of Sherlock dragging a fleeing suspect toward himself with his Tk, thought of how Sherlock had once smashed a gun in a man's hand from 20 metres away, and found himself fervently hoping that he wasn't the one who had inadvertently triggered Sherlock's anger. Instead, he found himself hoping the Psy Council would be at the receiving end of it.
One winter, on a particularly fine day with heaps of snow and sunshine, Sherlock had been very young and the proud owner of a brand new sled. The cold air on his cheeks had been biting but that only added to the thrill of racing down the hill behind their house, a slightly bumpy ride towards the cove of trees at the bottom. He hadn't figured out how to steer yet and was headed right for one of the trees when a hare had jumped out of the undergrowth, forcing him to throw himself sideways and tip the sled over to avoid hitting the startled animal. Sherlock had rolled through the snow and come to a stop right next to the tree, bruised and with his mouth full of snow, but otherwise fine. It was only when he sat up that he noticed the broken-off branch sticking out of the tree trunk at just the right height for, say, a young boy on a sled to impale himself on in a direct collision.
He simply looks at her and waits.
"Is it?" Sherlock asked. "You know they'd never say anything of their own accord. I'm the only one willing to face you even when you are in a strop. Believe me, by now I am more than used to you being angry with me. I hardly see why anyone else should have to face your inability to deal with being called out on your mistakes."
Sherlock was almost relieved. So that was what had finally tipped John off. He supposed he should have expected that, but hiding the evidence hadn't even entered his mind at the time.
John thought about brushing his teeth with a longing he would have previously only experienced when thinking of a good night's sleep and maybe a nice long holiday somewhere warm and sunny. He nodded decisively.
"Let's just hope he won't betray the entire thing in his surprise," Sherlock said as John pulled on his jacket. "Perhaps I should have warned him after all."
Sherlock is biting his lip, hard, his jaw tense and ... the bastard is trying not to laugh.
"Don't mind him, he's sick," John tells her, nodding towards a heap of blankets on the sofa. "He's been sleeping all morning."
"What?" John and Sherlock demanded in unison.
"This is your fault," Sherlock complained. "I never used to be hungry so often until you started bullying me into eating all the bloody time."
John yipped at her, gently head-butted her thigh in lieu of a goodbye, and made his way back upstairs to where Sherlock was already waiting, his hair still dripping wet.
"One out of two isn't that bad," Sherlock offered, dropping his gaze to the ground.
Well, perhaps "forget" wasn't the right word. He had certainly supressed it, forced himself not to remember that this was going to happen.
That tricked Mrs Munkeld into a small smile. When she glanced down at him, John wagged his tail at her.
John whined and tugged at his lead until Sherlock let it go, allowing him to walk over to the armchair Mrs Forsythe sat on and put his head on her knee.
"Jim Moriarty," he drawled. "Hiiiii."
"Oh, Mr Sigerson! I didn't expect you to come back so soon," the old man said. "What can I do for you?"
failed to notice them.
Sherlock's head jerked up and he gaped at John in surprise. "What?"
John accepted the key from the innkeeper and his bag of clothes from Sherlock and marched up the stairs.
"Or he will be frustrated by his failure and go looking for his next victim immediately."
"But why drag John into this? That doesn't make sense."
"Everything all right?" he asked as soon as they had closed the curtains and locked the doors for their now usual evening activity.
A bartender came and took the plate away and still they sat in silence. He took a sip of his beer. Sherlock would talk when he was ready.
Lestrade frowned. "Right. We're not having this conversation on your bathroom floor. Come on. Up you get."
"Oh bugger."
Sherlock's expression shifted into something even more pained. John decided to take it as agreement.
Sherlock looked at him, took in whatever John’s face showed at the moment, and did as he was told for once. He also got a pair of dark blue skinny trousers that ended just above his knees. John had not hitherto spent much time thinking about calves but found himself quite unable to tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s pale skin.
The silence dragged on all the way to London. It felt as if, in the days they had not been able to, he and Sherlock had forgotten how to talk to each other.
"They didn't say a word this time," John noted. "Why do you think that is?"
“Wha-” John began and the rest of his question was promptly muffled by Sherlock’s mouth on his.
Sherlock closed his eyes. "Yes. No dissonance."
The words had become a mantra in his head.
"Didn't you hear him when he excused himself?" Lestrade asked. "He's gone looking for the loo."
All he was permitted was to pay attention to John's footwork and his posture and his knowledge of the steps and that was absolutely it. He could do this. He had done so on numerous occasions at 221b. There was no reason why it wouldn't work now.
John had nothing better to do and no real reason to decline, so they gathered the rest of their groceries, paid and went to find the nearest coffee shop.
The sight was unbearable.
They end up having fish and chips at a food truck on a cold October evening as they wait for a suspect to emerge from the house on the opposite side of the street.
Donovan, who had so far been listening quietly with a doubtful expression on her face, snorted. "Well, as long as we have such a detailed plan..."
He bent down, picked up the stick, and stood. "Ready?"
Sherlock snorts. "Don't be ridiculous, John. We're playing airplane."
If he hadn't come already, he thought this sensation alone might be enough to push him over the edge. His cock made a half-hearted attempt to harden and Sherlock moaned around John's hot length in his mouth. John's hands pushed at his shoulders, rather feebly, a clear warning that Sherlock chose to ignore. He wanted to
There's a chair in front of him, turned to face him.
"I was watching everyone," Sherlock said. "Someone loitering by the departure boards for half an hour? You might well have been an accomplice biding his time."
It is all he needs to know to get through the day, to keep treading water. He wraps these words around himself and settles in to wait.
"That's no problem at all. What a handsome dog you have!" she exclaimed. John wagged his tail at her and got his ears scratched in return.
There was a desperate sound and a gasp and then John's mouth was forcibly dragged back to Sherlock's, now responsive and more than a little eager in its sudden reciprocation.
What had given Greg the idea that John was leading Sherlock on? Leading him where? No, he mustn't play stupid. He knew precisely what Lestrade had been saying and he didn't quite know what to make of the suggestion. It seemed odd for the DI to believe that John was the one giving Sherlock false hopes when, as far as John knew, he was the only one who had ever hoped that perhaps ...
The hot shower helped relax his muscles further, removing the lingering traces of tension. A generous application of shower gel and shampoo were sufficient to overpower the scent of sex and wash away the semen on his skin. He could only hope that John's nose wasn't good enough to detect them anyway.
It occurs to John that no one ever compliments Sherlock on anything but his mind, if at all.
They are in the kitchen of 221a. Sally has no idea how they got there but there's a chair and she's sitting down and trying to take deep breaths.

"You know what I'm saying," Sherlock told him. "Lestrade said they interviewed everyone in the photographs. But did they also interview the photographer?"
"What is that?"
He was right, of course he was, but Sherlock felt close to vibrating right out of his brother's grip and rushing into that room.
On the fourth day of this press-enforced quarantine, Sherlock suggested going out.
And now all of that was gone and all that remained were the scars on his back and the fresh horror in John’s voice and body language as he tried not to imagine what Sherlock must have gone through and clearly failed.
“Ah, there you are,” he said. “Good morning. I hope I didn’t wake you.”
They did drag themselves out of bed and into the shower after some hours and another round.
John nodded. "I didn't know where else to go, so I just took my stuff back to my old room upstairs. Hope you don't mind." He rubbed the back of his neck. "I, uh, I can of course leave if you want me to. Find somewhere else to stay."
He took some deep breaths and occupied himself with laying out some clothes to wear to dinner while John finished his shower. They likely weren’t going to go out again but he felt he should look nice anyway. This was going to be their first dinner away from home since Mary had died and since they had both acknowledged that they wanted more.
"Oh." Greg leaned back. That was rather unexpected. "Did he say why? Have you done anything? Left entails in the bathtub or whatever?"
John grunted, barely remembering to add a higher-pitched noise at the end to indicate a question.
John rolled his eyes. "Fine. Remember to reciprocate."
He held her close for the entire ride, her bee stuffed into a pocket of his jacket. He could have lost her. He had lost her, for a time. But he could have lost her for so much longer, possibly forever. Earlier he had told Sherlock that she would likely be clingy for a bit, but the truth was that he rather suspected he would be holding on for much longer than she would. Kids bounced back quickly and she had the support system needed to see her through. Still, it would be some time before he would feel confident enough to let her out of his sight beyond being in the next room.
He gave them a nod and started to make a cup of tea he had no intention of drinking.
She watches as he adjusts the strings and tightens the bow.
"Why do you have a dog? Psychopaths and animals don't go well together, haven't you heard?"
Sherlock hesitated for barely a second before he stood and unbuttoned his shirt. He turned around and shrugged out of it, exposing the patchwork of scars that criss-crossed on his back.
There's more laughter, muttered apologies and some more scrambling until they have somehow managed to get their legs thoroughly entangled and it turns out that both of them trying to get up at the same time is not a good idea.
Sherlock squeezed his knees. "He'll confess," he said, inflecting his voice with a certainty he did not entirely feel. "Apparently he was already expecting them and seemed almost relieved when he saw them outside his door. Nothing about him struck me as a killer when I saw him very briefly upon our arrival. I would have been more surprised if he had simply carried on as normal."
John was exhausted.
The following day was an exercise in self-restraint.
"He's used to my scent by now, I should think," Sherlock pointed out quite logically. "After all, we share a flat that is drenched in both our scents and we have spent a lot of time in close physical contact since his transformation. It would surprise me if he couldn't filter me out by now."
"Is your bloke that strict?"
“Hmm, good luck with that,” John told him and unbuttoned his shirt. “I won’t be getting in your way.”
Before he knew what he was doing, he had climbed onto the bed and was pulling Sherlock towards him. He didn't resist, clearly too surprised to process what was happening, and John managed to get his arms around him and hold on tight, pressing his face into the space between Sherlock's shoulder blades.
"Threatening?" Donovan echoed.
There were no words after that, or at least none that didn't boil down to "Is this all right?" and "God, yes".
"Does he?" Sally asks doubtfully. "I think he is a bit, well ... in denial, I suppose. I don't think he realises. Not with that fiancée of his."
Someone noticed that Sherlock was bleeding and someone else mentioned that Rosie should probably be checked through as well.
"Well, damn."
Sherlock had asked for one week where they could simply be the way they had been before all this. One week away from weddings and anything but the two of them and the case.
word.
"Says the man who spent two years hunting down people on the off-chance they might try to kill me," John retorted.
He wondered if it was something about the way Sherlock stood as if a cab not stopping didn't even occur to him, or if he was subtly manipulating them.
"Fine," John said eventually. "I'll explain anything you might want to know about skin privileges. I even agree to show you the basics of it, but under the strict understanding that you will be honest with me about any adverse effects so we can stop before you suffer brain damage."
John gave a demonstrative yawn and turned away.
"I'm sorry," he muttered. "I'm so sorry I didn't realise what was going on. I should have. In hindsight, you were obvious enough about it, if only I had bothered to pay attention."
