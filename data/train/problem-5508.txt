"Every year we do the lodge on Christmas Eve and then we have Stark Party New Year," insisted Tony as he followed Pepper out toward the pool deck.  "That's
"He's... he's a good guy, if that's what you mean.  He's more dominant than Tony but not quite as dominant as me."
"No," repeated Tony.  The helmet was expressionless.  The voice inside it was, too. "You know what?  That kid was right. The last time I saw someone tortured for information, for secrets, it was me, in Afghanistan."
Tony sobered up damned quickly at that.  Keeping the knot in increased the chances of... that?  Tony
Natasha ran her hands over her face and through her hair with a loud sigh. "Черт," she whispered softly.
Pepper was sitting in their living room, gathering up some research proposals; she looked up and her brow furrowed.
"So the week after SHIELD fries my brain, it's your birthday.  I was thinking we could go to New York," said Tony casually.  He was still trying to get his hands on a bald eagle but so far no one seemed very willing to sell him one for some reason.  "...if you want to, I mean."  He was testing the waters.  Steve's reaction to his old war memorabilia had driven home the fact that Steve's age was a sensitive topic.  He was both young and old, stuck in a time that wasn't really his, and most of his friends were dead.  Those that weren't, like Peggy, were close.  But Tony still wanted to do something for Steve.  Assuming his SHIELD didn't destroy his brain.  Flunking the psych eval or having a psychotic episode would probably put a damper on any celebrations.
"He's dead.  They-- they killed him.  It's gone. Just gone, completely gone, I can't f-feel..."  Tony had a stricken expression and had gone an ashy color; in the suit, he was starting to shake violently.  He hadn't realized or appreciated the constant sense of his mate over the last eight months, but suddenly it was no more, clicked off in an instant, like a light switch.  It was as if he'd suddenly gone completely blind.
Pietro made a derisive sound.  "We'll never be like that, Wanda.  Forget it." He flopped back into the sand moodily.  Wanda continued to watch the omegas playing. They were probably their age, in their late teens, and Wanda envied them.  She would have loved to join but she'd probably only end up popping the ball. Pietro was right. They weren't normal and they'd never live carefree little lives like that.
Steve's head was bowed, so Tony couldn't see his face, but he had an idea Steve's expression was one of ecstasy.  Certainly, that was how Tony felt.  It was so strange to him.  They hadn't touched, hadn't kissed; this was as thrilling as anything he'd ever experienced and yet it was not sexual, at least not conventionally; admittedly, Tony was rock-hard; he could smell Steve's lust; but neither of them were rushing, there was a right way to do this, one that Tony knew somehow, had always known.
"Yeah, actually, if you could put on these safety goggles..." began Tony, offering a pair to Steve.  "I need to do some jack hammering and I'd hate a shard of gravel to hit one of those pretty blue eyes.  I have a, uh, thing about shrapnel for some reason."  He tried to pretend he was joking.
"Over forty omegas and betas walked out of that building. Because of you. That's making a lot of enemies," Brennan said.
"No.  I want you to clear up your Friday night for a sit-down with the King of Wakanda.  They're having some civil unrest in the north and a lot of the insurgents are using old Stark technology."
"I'm sorry if you got the backlash from that," he said, and he meant it. Steve glanced over at the auctionees. "Do you think... do you think I could go talk to them? Or do you think I'm a no-go for them too?"
"I'm not coddling you," Steve said. "I'm just saying I'm here if you need me to be. I'm not trying to mother you. If you say it's fine then it's fine." He nodded and pulled out the key, taking the collar off. The skin underneath was red but not swollen like it had been the night before. Steve still felt bad for it all the same though.
"You're not late," he assured Tony from where he was fixing his hair in the mirror, or rather, attempting to tame it. Steve turned back around to inspect Tony's neck. "It's a lot less pink than it was.  But I think you shouldn't wear the collar."
"If we don't figure this out soon, a whole lot more people are going to die," said Sam.  "We're doing what we have to, to protect--"
Steve ended up spending a good few hours tearing through punching bags. He wrapped his hands but his knuckles still got sore. Then he had angry sex with Tony before passing out in bed. He woke up out the other side of his heat feeling strangely unsatisfied and generally frustrated. It felt like the world was slowly turning against him.
Fury was quiet for a short while. "That's classified Captain. Maybe you could explain to Stark what that
By the time they got home it was a small wonder they hadn't wrecked the car.  Both of them were nodding off.
better, lighter on his feet than he had been in a while. Steve felt an odd sense of relief wash over him.
The drawing was good. Steve had had time to work in a lot of details while Sam and Tony had been rolling around on the floor. The eyes were angry.
“What?  I’m fine.  Peachy.  Just… just had too much sugar.  That’s on you, Stan.  You oughta make them put less fruit in these things,” snapped Tony, wincing as he tasted his smoothie.  God, slugging down this disgusting green crap was going to kill him, if the decaying palladium didn’t.  Tony wondered which would be more painful and found himself chuckling at the morbidity of the thought.  He caught Steve’s eye, and reached out to pat his leg reassuringly.  “Sorry, I was thinking about… well, never mind, you wouldn’t understand.  I’m fine.  Really.  I always am.  I’m, you know, invincible.”  He winked.
Tony's eyes snapped opened immediately.  His movements were fluid and instantaneously; he grabbed Steve's hips and pulled him into the bed, and rolled onto his back to position himself.
A drunk girl in a short pink dress flopped onto the ruined couch next to Steve, hiccuping, her mascara smeared under her eyes.  "This is
Tony slid an arm under Steve's neck and another around his body, pulling him close before (fuck, Steve was
Tony ran a hand down his back.  "I'll come with you," he said with determination.  Seeing Steve's face, he added, "Oh,
Steve pulled out his phone to find out that Aria had sent him a load of photos from the shoot for him to look at that. Most were Steve looking over dramatic in nice looking clothes. The group photos were cute or funny and then there was a few more political ones. They'd painted a 'collar' onto his neck in the colors of the American flag and photographed him smearing his fingers through it and holding them up, his hands smudged with blues and reds and purple.
Steve stared down at Cooper and his eyes went wide. He could see the similarity almost immediately. The boy had Clint's exact eyes. Natasha was grinning at him, waiting for a response.
"Our admiring fans have noticed us," said Tony.  "...you wanna make someone's night and play pool with 'em?  There's a group of four kids over there about your age... we could cut in.  Make teams."
"...and he fights for you, too," said Justin very, very softly, rising unsteadily to his feet, brushing himself off, wincing.
Steve suggested that he bite his shoulder, but... it wasn't the same.  There was something so intimate about biting Steve's neck. It was like Steve had suggested Tony jerk off his arm instead of his dick.  What was the point?
He had no idea what he'd just witnessed.  Steve had gotten all dopey from the heat, had maybe had a few confusing little flashbacks (he'd mentioned frostbite, after all), but then... then he'd woken up and it had all gone to hell.  The way he had looked at Tony, with such... what? Not hatred. No. Just an intense desire to annihilate him. He looked at Tony with the look of a predator, and the swing he'd taken had not been a playful one.  Every time Tony looked at the wall, he imagined his head. Steve would have caved it in like an over-ripe melon. He'd missed by mere inches. His movements had been weird and jerky, like he was suddenly unused to his own body; he'd practically tripped over his own feet.  His words had been garbled and nonsensical. Tony's heart was still hammering but it wasn't just himself he was scared for. His mate had gone fucking crazy. Had he done this, somehow?
Then he stopped. He saw Donner straightening up and the seven other kids began to walk after the others. And Steve wanted to know what he
"As you know, we've been conducting a search through Europe for Barnes.  So far, we've turned up empty.  But since we know, through you, that he's alive, we'd like to recruit you to help us find him.  Alexander Pierce, who's a member of the World Security Council, asked for you specifically.  I have it on good authority that you're getting antsy and I don't blame you.  I'm guessing doing daytime talk shows isn't as fun and being in the field, is it?"  He paced through Steve's old kitchenette, trailing his hands over the counter.  "I'm asking you like this, in private, because contrary to popular belief, I don't have it out for you and Agent Stark.  Every day that goes by without knowing where Barnes is, that's one more day we're at a disadvantage.  We're running out of ideas.  You're the only connection we have to him... other than the Winter Soldier."  Steve must have looked surprised, because Fury nodded.  "That's right.  We know there's a connection.  What that connection is, though... that's something we'd be better off knowing.  So, it's up to you, Captain.  If you want to be put on this assignment, we're happy to have you.  But I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess you still haven't told your Alpha yet, have you?  If there's one thing we got out of his psych evaluation, it's that he's a man who's crippled by a fear of not being good enough.  And if there's one thing we got out of yours, it's that you got a hero complex and you'd rather handle things yourself than risk hurting a third party."
Tony looked at Steve. "Whatever makes you happy, Steve."  He set down his drink, hopped off the counter, and walked over to wrapped his arms around Steve's waist.  He closed his eyes and rested his cheek on Steve's back. He wondered if Steve realized that there were probably lots of people-- specifically, older, conservative Alphas-- that would be watching and looking for anything to criticize.  But, he figured that was why they had Pepper and Aria. They would tell Steve what to wear, where to stand, and veto anything too controversial.
Across the room, there was cheering and someone held up an omega's wrist like he was the winner in a boxing ring.  He had a dazed but happy expression and a black eye. The other omega, on the floor, was scrambling up, trying to staunch a bloody nose.
Steve stared at the recorder curiously. It seemed fair. Though he was sure that meant Fury and countless amounts of scientists would be listening to him later, all deciding if he was capable for the field or perhaps even sane. Fun.
They discharged Steve the next day, after only a few days. Brennan figured being in a SHIELD facility wasn't any good for his mental health and Gleason had confirmed that his neck was no longer infected; it was healing well thanks to the serum. So he could go home.
"You've been spending your time around an Alpha 24/7. It's possible," Phil said. "We knew by the chip. Your heart rate is going through the roof, as well as your core temperature. And then that disaster on the track-" Steve opened his mouth to speak. "Not your fault. Didn't see it coming. You did the right thing."
It's not electrified, I can see infrared on this thing," replied Tony, tapping the helmet with a couple of metal fingers.  He tore open the chain cage like it was tissue paper and ripped a panel off the box, pulling out a tangle of wires. "All we gotta do is cut the red one.  It's always the red one. ...too bad I'm color-blind, huh?" he said, pulling out a few green wires and preparing to snap them.
Pepper turned to give Tony a stern look. "You don't drink anymore tonight, you hear me Tony? It'll make you feel worse and you'll be no good to Steve drunk."
"Aren't you Pepper Potts?" asked Danielle, turning her attention to Pepper while Steve unbuttoned his waistcoat.
He could begrudgingly appreciate at least one thing about Steve's old Alpha.  Bucky had wanted to protect him. Tony understood that. He still hadn't told Steve his inner thoughts (or rather,
"Oh you know, it's fun." Yes, she speaks! Piper finally look up at him. "Alphas do their thing. You know how it is."
Tony ground his teeth together, leaning into Steve's touch.  "You're right... you're right, he's not worth it... I just... I should've been there, to protect you..."
. She has great theories." Eric was obviously a bit of a fan boy. "She says omegas who act out are actually the most submissive when you break them in."
He ran his tongue over Steve's balls; they tightened a little.  Experimentally, Tony pulled them into his mouth gently, running his tongue over Steve's sack.  Steve squirmed under him, body tense, clearly trying not to buck up.
bleeding?  It was a clean cut, but deep.  Lousy glass.  "I'll just... wrap this... if you have bandages..."  Tony hiccupped and swayed, but the sway turned into a practiced swagger and Tony let himself into Steve's living room, strutting around the room, examining Steve's inner life.  He had never seen this place before.  There was a stupid-looking, overly patriotic mug on the kitchen counter, some pictures on the fridge, an easel in the corner with a half-finished skyline in watercolor.
"Great!" grunted Tony, stretching dangerously, wobbling a little.  "I need a boost.  Steve!  Pick me and this cabinet up, I can't reach the hook.  How about you, Rhodey, you took a few hits in the suit--"
"Oh, I agree, I think it's unhealthy for them to have more than one.  Too many mixed signals about who to obey, you know? But Rogers was always all about defying social norms.  You look at his record and even in the forties he was a loose cannon, like the whole liberation of-- are you
Tony's hackles rose up and he tugged impatiently on his collar.  It was only late morning but Malick's earlier jab about his neck had done a lot of damage.   Physically, and emotionally. Tony hid his mark well and had never had to answer any questions about it.  The hackles did a good job of covering it, and Tony's hair was a bit on the long side anyway. But there were enough pictures out there of Tony that, surely, anyone with enough time on their hands could probably note that the marks on his neck and back and shoulders appeared after 2008.  After his capture.
Sometime after midnight, with a tentative knock, he peeked in.  Tony was lying sprawled on top of Steve, shiny with sweat, not moving, his knot buried into Steve.
"Four days?" Steve echoed. It hadn't felt like four days. "I only slept once." Natasha gave him an alarmed look. "The room...it was always light. I had no idea." He shrugged. He wasn't surprised Natasha had been tracking him and he didn't really mind, knowing she'd done it as a friend and not SHIELD. And after everything...he was damned grateful too.
"No, no, I'm great.  I'm fine," insisted Tony.  "It's just that... Dan, what the hell?  ...I didn't know you were into this shit."
"I'm Justin Hammer," the Alpha grinned wolfish and stuck out a hand. Steve instantly didn't like him. He remembered the name from the list. Avoid- Pepper had added the note of '
Tony nodded slightly.  He hadn't asked Steve yet, but he was wondering if it would be a good or a bad idea to invite Clint to Zephyr Hill.  If Trickshot was there...
He curled an arm around Natasha's waist, catching her in the middle of the dance floor. "Enjoying terrorising the guests?" he teased gently as Natasha curled her arms around his neck.  He’d seen the accidental drink spill. Her smile was innocent but the glint in her eyes was wicked.
Karpov reached out and he flinched away, but Karpov was only going to pat his cheek again.  He relaxed.  "Good boy," said Karpov, gently, and the words were like music to his ears.
Steve turned to his head to look up at Tony. "Did you really not know?" He asked softly. "That Alphas do that?"
about that- that's how I grew up, that's perfectly normal.  There's trios all over the place, it's not a big deal. I mean, Dad was in one, apparently, (news to me,) but that's not the point. I'm just saying, it's not
"Alright, alright! I'm coming," Steve held up his hands like he was surrendering and stood. The beta woman waved at him until he walked out and away from the auctionees.
"--I'm sorry.  Am I mathing too hard?  I was just about to get to the coolest part, though.  For an aspect ratio less than the square root of three, embedding a rectangular
Tony would have liked to continue but he couldn't help laughing at Steve squeal of surprise, and also he had to pull away because Steve had nearly kicked him in the face.  Steve's reflexes made it damn near impossible to ever really surprise him, and even if Tony managed to, it often ended in Steve going full soldier on him; Tony had been shoved against a wall a couple of times when he jumped out at Steve.
The space was freed up so Banksy dropped down next to Steve. He gave him a tired sort of smile. "Hey I thought... I thought what you said this morning was really brave. About, you know--"
"Well, Pepper basically gave me a list of like twenty-five places, but there's only a couple I really care about," said Tony, reaching for some sort of dessert that looked good.  "There's a lock exhibit at the British museum I gotta see, and I'd like to check out King's College... lemme see..." Tony chewed on some strawberries, pulling out Pepper's rumpled list.  She always wrote things down for him in addition to e-mailing them because Tony often didn't bother to check his e-mail. "...oh... Fury wants you to check in with MI-13. You also have a meeting with some guy named-- Peter Wisdom.  For the love of Lorentz, why does everyone have such a fake-sounding name? Do they like, assign you a dumb name when you get to a certain level in an intelligence agency?" Tony shook his head, then turned back to the paper. "Oh! And I-- I, uh, really want to see Churchill's war rooms.  But if that's too intense for you... I mean... I know you fought in the war. And... and were probably also there," fumbled Tony awkwardly. "And, y'know, we're going to see Aunt-- I mean, Agent Carter."
"Yeah.  Yeah, it's me, Steve.  What's wrong? I felt you panicking," he said, clearing his throat a little.  "Do you need me? I can be there in a few minutes if you need--"
"Tony, Tony, Tony, you just can't stay out of trouble!" said Lowenstein, beaming.  "This is our new junior partner, Mr. Narayan--"
Everyone's talking about it.  Do you know what Twitter is?  You're trending on Twitter.  ...Nat's really worried about you, though.  She says you looked like shit when she dropped you off last night.  I just got back from New Mexico and you won't
"I doubt it. But you never know, maybe he was born an angry looking baby," Steve hummed. He had to bite back a moan as Tony began to knead at his shoulders. The engineer was good with his hands- that was nothing new.
"Well, I think you can be forgiven for that, Steve.  Come on.  Let's go down to your party."  She offered Steve her arm; Steve took it.
Natasha was staring at him and he wasn't sure he liked it.  She was clearly judging him but her own face revealed nothing at all.  Tony hated people like that.  He found himself staring back, not willing to seem submissive to her, not while Steve was in the room.
Steve spent the rest of the afternoon drawing. He asked JARVIS what the least used room in the house was and picked a white wall. A biro would do for the drawing itself though he'd gone through about three pens in the space of four hours. He knew Tony wouldn't mind and the impact would be worth it when it was done. When he was a kid Steve would always draw on the walls...it would make his ma so mad, but so proud. Especially when they were the spitting image of her.
It was perhaps a little interesting, Tony would contemplate, later, that everyone talked about pair-bonding with such flowery language, made it seem romantic and sweet and frilly. But there was also a lot of intense fucking, apparently, the dirty, primal kind of fucking where both parties lose control.  Tony was perfectly fine with that, though.
Steve's shoulders shook. His neck throbbed as he ducked his head down again, screwing his eyes shut as hot tears balled up around his eyes. God, why was he crying? He wasn't a child. He was a grown-ass man.
"...he won't wake up for a little while longer.  Doesn't have your metabolism," said Tiberius with a little smile.
"On the mend, thanks to you, I hear. Look, I get you don't wanna talk about it. But I just gotta ask... did he recognise you?"
All of the shit with Steve and the protesters had provided an excellent distraction from the dreaded upcoming anniversary.  But now, staring at all the photos in his lap, he was reminded of a family he never really got to know and a childhood that ended as suddenly and traumatically as his parents' car.
Steve couldn't help  but smile at the sight. Tony's hair plastered all over his face...it was kinda cute.
The night was a total blur.  Open bars were Tony's personal kryptonite.  His whole body ached and he had a vague idea he had lost money and gained something else but he couldn't remember much of it.
How about going AWOL for two months, invading a sovereign nation, nearly causing a war, and endangering the public?  Huh? You wanna tell the
Tentatively, the redhead walked over, heels clicking.  Tony remained draped over Steve; he looked up at her questioningly.  His eyes were bright again; relief flooded her face.
"Okay. Very impressive and all...but your lab safety is terrible." Steve told him fondly; then, before Tony could protest, he picked him up. There was no one else to see it. And sometimes Steve couldn't help but mother him.
He glanced back into the hall; the twins had stepped out, wrapped up in bed sheets. "I'm pretty sure Sera has someone in there. She's number five," the girl offered and Steve went a little pale.
Steve smiled as Tony apologised. He shot a text off to Gleason then dropped his phone. "It's okay. I still enjoyed it. I wasn't going to last long either; it was pretty intense. It was kind of insane. I can't believe I didn't know about something so...it's on my body and I didn't even know it was there. That's bad. I wonder if everyone else knows, and it's just me being from the forties and not getting taught this stuff."
On the set, Banksy and Bowell were talking; Banksy had just finished saying, "...World War II veteran, civil rights leader, and the world's only genetically enhanced super-soldier, Captain America!"
"They are," Gleason hummed, returning to his side with a rather menacing-looking syringe. Steve hadn't admittedly taken in everything that he'd said. He'd been too caught up in the article, his eyes a little red around the edges. All he grasped was that that syringe was going into the back of his neck.
He walked in line with Mike's step which certainly didn't help him endear the Alpha to him any further. "Everyone's talking about you," he said, voice gruff. "Causing quite a stir."
"I told you already. Probably off screwing somewhere. When the captain was in heat he looked about ready to beg for--" Natasha shut him up with a kick to his jaw.
"--because obviously he recognizes that it's 2010 and omega rights are still a big issue, and Clint's backing you up all the way--"
"Okay.  So we have one lead.  Here's the others," said Natasha.  She held up a couple of flash drives.  "I pulled a list of all currently known HYDRA bases.  Steve could be at any of them."
Gleason was moving to help Steve sit up. He was still swaying, only half with it and was entirely unaware of what was going on. "You're
Tony drew away with a nostalgic smile.  "You remember when we first met? Not when you smacked Happy onto the floor, although that was hilarious.  Not when you interviewed. I mean like your first day as my PA, when we started talking about omega rights.  And I called you uppity. And nicknamed you Sparky. And thought you were such a smug little omega... oh my God, I was just like the rest of them, I was such a tool."
He let out a long, shaky groan of pleasure, melting into Steve's body, the tension slowly easing itself from his muscles.  The world came back to him slowly, in pieces; his hand was still gripping Steve's length; he had let go of Steve's neck, which was bleeding a little; body of them were drenched in sweat; the whole room was filled with orchids.
"...I took the liberty of setting up an appointment for you," said Brennan.  She offered Steve an appointment card; Dr. Brazinski pulled out one as well.
Steve was confused when he realised that T'Chaka called his mate his 'wife' too. Usually, marriage was a beta thing. They didn't have anything like mating and it helped to solidify a relationship. Like mating it was a sign of commitment. So Steve was surprised when T'Chaka mentioned they were both married and mated. Maybe it was because they were royalty, or maybe in Wakanda they viewed marriage differently. Steve didn't know, but he found himself curious.
Sitting in a desk chair, legs propped up on the desk and cradling a black office phone, George was chatting away pleasantly.  "...Cynthia's still waiting to hear from Vermont, but at least she's already got Washington and Lee, and frankly I thought that they had better--"
Tony settled back onto the bed, hands behind his head, watching Steve lovingly.  "You are good for me.  I love this.  This is amazing, Steve.
And suddenly Tony getting high made sense. Steve couldn't feel his guilt, only a low buzz from the drugs. He felt bad because he probably slept through Tony feeling like shit, instead of being there for him. If he'd been awake he might have felt something and gone downstairs... but he hadn't been.  Tony's mania with the suits was fueled by guilt.  He should have known.
Nick wasn't a simple man so Steve had expected something like this. It was evident why he couldn't have sent Peter Wisdom. Alone, a normal man would have struggled to do this without simply murdering all of them. And whilst Steve was prepared to kill them (goddammit, he thought he'd moved on from this) he didn't want to if he could help it.
"Usually about twice a year, three to seven days, averaging five, and, yes, we cycle together.  Tony, I have to go, it's doing something weird again."
The van was gone.  He ran along the rooftops, following one van, then another, not sure where Karpov was.  He couldn't feel him.  Why couldn't he feel him?
The past was past. Tony's "Merchant of Death" title still haunted him but he'd rather try to ignore it. As if it were a ghost whose power came from acknowledgement.
"Jail," said George casually.  Donner looked horrified and the room was definitely feeling increasingly tense.  George tried to rescue it. "...
Steve reached his fingers up to gently push damp hair back from Tony's forehead. He didn't look especially with it, his gaze a little unfocused but he seemed to understand what Tony was saying. He didn't comment. There was no need to. Everything Tony was saying was true. He just hummed and butted their foreheads together affectionately.
And when Thursday dawned, Tony was up at his usual time, looking well-rested.  Which made sense, since he'd slept away the better part of two days. He greeted Steve with a kiss and a nuzzle, and headed to the bathroom to shower without any indication he'd spent the last two days acting like the world was ending.  Then again, Tony's moods had always been capricious.
the time?" Steve felt a little funny. And not in a good way. Gideon hated him. He made an extra effort to demean Steve every time he was around him. He spent thousands of dollars buying those tickets just to make fun of him. What kind of game was that man goddamn playing?  "Tony is the best mate I could have," Steve told him calmly, making an effort to not sound confrontational. Donner frowned. "I know that if you've read the news that sounds stupid... but it was Tony's idea to turn up in a collar, because we wanted us to come as
Natasha held a tablet out to both of them and smiled a little. "I thought you might want to know how your evening's being... perceived."
"The '94 case?" repeated Tony.  His brain reeled back to '94, what the hell had he been doing in '94?  He would have been 24, which meant he was probably snorting cocaine and having orgies and crashing Lamborghinis into the fountains in front of Caesar's Palace.
"What's all this nonsense about?" Howard's voice rang out into room and everyone fell quiet instantaneously. The moment Howard entered the room, the whole dynamic shifted.  Howard's presence was like an elephant's, impossible to ignore.  He was older, quite a bit older; his hair and mustache were white but he still had a straight-backed posture and looked fully capable of running a 5K.  His age only gave him more of a commanding air, not less.  He had a tumbler in his hand, the liquid inside it golden. He took a sip as he sauntered around, eyes landing on Steve.
"I didn't even know there was a lodge," Steve protested as he pressed a triple espresso into Tony's hand before pulling away with his own cappuccino. (He couldn't really feel the caffeine kick so for Steve it was all about the taste.  And the calories.  He put whole milk in his cappucinos and lattes; he had tried not to look too disgusted when Tony had eagerly told him about almond milk.)
Could omegas have back-to-back heats?  Was that it, maybe?  Could Tony blame his actions on that?  He didn't know enough about omegas to know.  The room smelled like arousal but that meant nothing, considering the position they had been in moments earlier.
Even Steve's gentle touch wasn't enough for him to shake it.  Steve didn't get it; Steve had never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.  Steve had never killed anyone unwitting or on accident like Tony had. Steve's goals were noble and Tony's were selfish and Tony felt like a piece of shit.
day's notice.  Probably because they knew if they had more, Tony would be able to wear Steve down, guilt him out of the mission, maybe, find some excuse not to do it.
"Oh, yeah," said Steve, nodding.  "Super dominant.  About the same as Buck--"  He stopped.  Too late.  Tony's hackles were up at the mention of Steve's other Alpha.
"I'm heading to the medical ward," Steve told Tony, brushing his fingers against the other's. "Are you gonna look for Trickshot? Keep me updated."
Stern was studying him closely, his hang-dog face a perfect portrait of his name.  "...I guess it's true.  Bonding really does change a man."
Aria turned to MacKenzie as she pushed sausages around a frying pan. "Does this mean it's going to be over for Steve too?"
He took Tony's hand and lead him over to the bar. He got him a glass of water and put it in his hand and told him: "Drink it."
This was yet another reason Tony was itching the join the team.  Not just to protect Steve, but to prove to Steve he wasn't just a spoiled brat in a business suit.  He could get low and dirty, he could throw and take a punch.  He wanted to prove to Steve that he was more than capable of protecting them, of being a good Alpha who could assert himself and throw down when it was time for that sort of thing.  Tony wasn't sure what Sam's deal was but he was confident his suits would blow Sam's gear out of the water.
to get force bonded, right? Like, genuine question. I do know your type can sometimes struggle with our overly-complicated, cutesy omega things.  Like consent."
Steve moved to sit down. This seemed like the kind of thing he should sit down for. Also, since when had Nick had their house key?! That was a discussion for another time, however.  He took a seat at the breakfast bar opposite them and the women took their own seats quickly after, clearly keen to be on equal ground with each other and Steve.
"Mescaline?  LSD?  C'mon... give me a hint."  Tony's eyes were already heavy.  They slid over to a monitor; the screen was currently blank.  He glanced back over to the window.  On his side, it was mirror.  He stared at himself.  Consciousness was starting to bleed a little bit around the corners.    Tony struggled to focus on things that were good, safe, comforting.  He didn't think about
"I didn't..." Steve swallowed thickly and looked up hesitantly to meet Tony's gaze. "I didn't know it felt like that," he admitted in a gentle murmur. "Thank you Tony."
If Tony had had the ability to feel anything aside from lust, he would have been panicking.  They were not doing a fantastic job of keeping up with the pill regimen yet. They were ten minutes behind this time.  Would ten minutes matter? Should Steve take two to be sure? Could they hire a beta or something to just... stand by and cram pills into Steve while they were fucking?
"It's a party!" George said, speaking a strange high pitched accent. Maybe he was doing an impression of someone... but Steve didn't recognise it.
"Captain Rogers, I-- I can't thank you enough, me and my mom, we-- we never thought-- I mean--" stammered Doug.  He was clearly aware he was one of those kids Steve wanted to help.
"Hey. Do you..." the guard stopped a little way past him, putting an arm on his colleague to make him stop too. Both Alphas, Steve noted. "Do you smell something?"
"Well, let's see... I'm your friend and I'm worried about you.  How's that for a good reason?" asked Natasha.  "Are you okay?  ...do you need me to bring you anything?"
."  He stole a glance at Steve, then said, a bit more confidently, "Yeah.  Yeah, let's go out to eat. I want some bar food. And when we get back..."  He trailed off, giving Steve another devilish smile.
Fury glared at Tony, clearly assuming Tony had taken the bed for himself, then looked up at Steve, ignoring Brennan entirely.  "Glad to see you're looking better, Cap. I have something for you. A friendship bracelet." He held up a small black box on a thick leather and metal strap.
As Tony picked up the pace Steve curled his legs up, feet pressing into the small of Tony's back to draw the alpha in deeper with each thrust. He was letting out soft, breathy little moans with his head thrown back against the soft living room carpet. Every time Tony thrust inside Steve trembled around him, clenching around him too as he felt more slick gather on his thighs from just how goddamn aroused he was.
Tony was frozen, stock-still, desperate to find his omega, to try to fix things.  He felt Pepper's hand on his shoulder but he barely even registered it. His mind was elsewhere, searching for his omega, for the bond he knew was still there, for the man whose scent sang to him, for the stupid, courageous, hard-headed blond that was Tony's best friend and partner.  For the omega he was missing. For his other half.
"Okay. Good, considering," Steve replied softly and accepted the coffee mug she gave him in thanks. He pulled the fruit bowl towards him and began picking at grapes. He wasn't overly hungry but he felt like he needed something.
?" Steve asked, low a low rumble. This was always something him and Tony would have that was just for each other. How could he feel like a weak Alpha when he took Captain America's virginity? It was time Steve reminded him of that.
"You'll be whatever you are," said Natasha.  "Eat your breakfast. So, Steve. I heard you met with some bigwig from the World Security Council."
Tony was currently in Steve's lap, nosing at the bruise on Steve's neck, licking his gland, as if he could fix it somehow.  Maria, as a beta, had no idea what was prompting his behavior, but knew well enough that it was something intimate, and was looking up prudishly, hands clasped before her.

The words washed over Steve and he stopped understanding them after the word 'quotient' and zoned out. Tony was certainly vert excited about it and that was very cute but that was where it kind of stopped for Steve. He didn't get it. He wasn't sure he wanted to. Math and science had never been his thing and it never would be. "Very cool," Steve hummed, looking slightly bemused.
"Or maybe something happened," Clint finished for her.  He grunted, reaching over to grab his phone from the nightstand. "You call Sam. I'll call Phil."
"You love fuck?" repeated Tony in a murmur, slowly rolling his hips, thrusting rhythmically, languidly, into Steve.  "So articulate, Rogers..."  he purred teasingly.
"Are you a real Alpha?  Lots of the Alphas here aren't real Alphas but you're not s'posed to say that."  She put Tigger's ear back into her mouth. "Am I gonna go home now? 'Cause Mom says I can't 'til I'm a beta."
"You..."  Tony's voice was hoarse.  He cleared it.  "...you made me... breakfast," he said, staring at the tray in front of him.  He looked around the room.  Not his room.  Definitely not.  Tony's room was stark, spartan.  Large but empty.  With an enormous bed, with silk sheets.  This room was... homey.  Comfortable.  One of his suits was standing by the window.  Tony couldn't remember taking it.  Or rather, he did, but fuzzily.  He was pretty sure he'd hit something on the way; there was a few scuffs on one of the suit's shoulders.
"Giddy doesn't let me watch Breaking--"  Donner's eyes lit up mischievously. "Yes.  Yes, I'll do that. And can you let all my friends in when they come?  George said he would come, and Banksy too, and probably Pepper and Aria."
The orchid was truly beautiful and if they hadn't received so many already Steve probably would have been more enamoured by it. But he still appreciated the gesture. They probably shouldn't auction this one though... it was too significant a gift, and too beautiful. And it was too soon to the auction now; to sell it would be in bad taste.
Bucky couldn't remember ever asking for anything other than orders, or necessities.  This wasn't a need but a
"Perfect, great, yes.  Lemme just swap this bad boy out and we can get started," said Tony happily, digging around the sinkhole that was his desk.  Pepper often criticized Tony's seeming lack of organization, but Tony knew where things were; he had the precise methodology of all mad scientists and refused to move anything.  The result was piles of papers and circuit boards and wires and old coffee cups.  He knocked over a tangle of wires and a stack of journals before finding what he was looking for; a new palladium core.
"You're avoiding the question," accused Tony, accepting the mug from Jarvis and sipping it.  Bitter as fuck.  He winced, wondering how Stane could stand it.  "Are you and Dad bonded?"
Steve curling up against Tony like this worked because of his flexibility. Maybe now if he was going to work out less intensely he could pick up something like yoga- something
George set the phone down and everyone let out a collective sigh of relief. "We did it. I'll set something up, but you need an Alpha to be there."
weird," said Tony awkwardly.  He could feel Steve's upset and it bothered him because, well... Tony's last girlfriend before Steve had been nineteen.  And the one before that, twenty-three. Tony didn't consider it creepy; he liked beautiful women and besides,
Steve was beginning to move forward towards Tony on the bed, his hands crawling closer to his Alpha because all he could think about now was pleasing him. And having Tony inside of him.
She'd put up with years of what probably qualified as sexual harassment from Tony and was willing to dismiss this as him perhaps being a little bit stupid because he was upset about the disruption to his routine and because he was flooded with hormones from Steve's heat, but she couldn't just ignore it, either.  She couldn't let him sabotage his relationship with Steve. She liked and respected Steve, and she was all too aware of the concerns Aria had expressed to her only days ago, before they'd taped
"I mean, it's not like we're going to say people should have abortions...we just want to give them the option," Steve said, keeping his voice calm. "Whether people want to keep it up, or consider adoption...that's their choice and we want to support them through it out. The important thing is people making the right choice for them."
"I think it's in our best interest to explore this further," said Coulson coolly.  "One omega to another, Captain, you understand you're at an increased risk in the field.  The simulation is not
Tony cradled him, noting with admiration how Natasha made some lame little excuse about checking the instrument panel so that they could be left alone.  Tony didn't dare take off his helmet. He was still erect and it was incredibly painful; he didn't want to know how much worse it could get. Smelling Steve directly like this... he wasn't sure he'd ever lost control like this, even under the influence of drugs.
When it was about seven in the evening Steve called it a day and dropped his tablet down onto the sofa before heading up the stairs to their bedroom. He hesitated in the doorway, watching Tony sleep. He looked peaceful, until he stirred, grunting softly in his half-awakened state. Steve stepped forward, "Tony? Hey? You awake?" He asked softly and moved to sit on the edge of the bed.
"Borrowed time... I get that," said Tony with a small smile.  He took Steve's hand and guided it to his arc reactor.  Tony had felt like he was living on borrowed time ever since he woke up from a bomb blast hooked up to a car battery.  Sometimes, randomly, it struck him all over again how lucky he was to be alive.  No, not lucky.  Tony didn't believe in luck.  But his almost-death had certainly shaped his entire future and Tony was often hit with a sense of uncanniness, knowing how close he had come to the brink, how delicate his mortality was.
When they arrived, the house was already lit up.  Pepper, Aria, Banksy, Tiberius, and Donner were in the living room; Donner was sitting beside Banksy, a blanket over his shoulders, holding a cup of hot chocolate.  Tiberius, as usual, was sitting off to the side. George wasn't present; he had already texted Steve to let him know he didn't expect to be back before midnight and he wouldn't see them until the morning.
Before Steve could answer, Tony's cell phone went off.  He grabbed the pants he'd discarded on the floor, searching the pocket, and pulled out the phone.  Pepper.
thought Tony affectionately, climbing painfully to his feet.  Half-limping, half-hopping, he threw on a plain black t-shirt and a pair of jeans, imagining how Steve would be fussing over him if he were here.
Tony thought it was actually a little funny.  Steve was so against Tony getting drunk or high, and yet he practically had a "pure ecstasy" button planted right on his body.
"I dreamed about the accident.  ...lately I've been having this dream where I can see them.  They died instantly but in the dream, they didn't. My mom's alive and asking for my dad and I look her right in the eye and then I reach for her and then I wake up."  A pause. "I drink a lot so I don't dream. Since the whole Afghanistan fiasco, my subconscious hasn't really played nice." Another pause. "I feel better today, though."  Pause. "Y'know it's been almost a year since we met, almost? We met in April and bonded in June." Pause. "...you can count them if you want."
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and leaned his head on top of his. He sighed softly. He stared at the ghoulish blue glow thrown across the room and the way it made shadows stretch across the walls. He kissed Tony's hair. "Installation piece?" He echoed in a murmur, smile evident in his tone. "I thought it seemed a bit more like vandalism..."
"Everyone's different," said Dr. Gleason tactfully, pulling away.  The large syringe was filled with a pink-tinged fluid that smelled strongly.  It wasn't exactly a bad smell but it was incredibly familiar to Steve. It was...
you'd meet Miss Frond... she can help you... you know, Donner here used to be terribly behaved but we set him straight, didn't we, Mags?"
'Kind of out of it' had become Steve's polite way of saying that Tony was going through a bad drinking phase. It meant he could talk about it with Natasha and Clint in public or around other people and not have to worry about dropping Tony in it. Laura seemed to also know what it meant though, or at least...she knew it wasn't good. "But with my neck he's great, actually," Steve added softly. "Better than me, even."
Tony yanked open his front door furiously, still in his bathrobe, and realized why JARVIS had kept repeating himself.  There were at least twenty people standing there. Clearly, they had been waiting for some time and had elected a leader, a not-very dominant, heavyset Alpha woman who stepped forward with two large stacks of envelopes in her hands.
Tony looked over at Steve in alarm.  He'd seen it was Fury and he doubted they were getting a call to wish them happy anniversary.
"Phew, okay... let's get this show on the road," said Tony, throwing it aside and walking into the garage.  "Steve, go get me... let's see... I need... okay, I think i have some old fiber cables I can repurpose somewhere around here...  I'm gonna need a sledge hammer, that wall over there will need to come out... we'll need all the jennies up and running to do this, so I'll put a hole here, and here..."  Tony's mind had already begun building; he gestured madly around the garage, his inner eye seeing the finished project, unconcerned with the amount of destruction he was going to need to do to his house.  You had to crack eggs to make omelettes.  Tony liked cracking eggs.
There was another crash from somewhere in the house; Tony tumbled off the second-floor mezzanine, hit the jets on his boots, and managed to land rather delicately on the floor with a loud clank of metal on stone
"But what if he hates me?" Stupid words. Stupid thoughts. Steve's mind was in pieces. Natasha frowned and sighed quietly before pulling her hand back, a slight crease in her brow.
"Ah, yes, I'm sure you've seen the headlines.  Very unfortunate. A rather abrupt cut-off to our evening's entertainment," said George, who was swinging back and forth in the chair airily.  Everyone else was watching with interest.
"Tony," he whispered. "Talk to me. You don't have to tell me what was it about, just talk to me about...something."
He relaxed a little.  "We really dodged a bullet."  He paused.  "Metaphorically, I mean.  Not literally.  Literally you... you got shot."  He laughed a little awkwardly.
Steve probably should have been upset, listening to everything Frond had to say...but he was just honestly struggling not to laugh. The idea that he would be happy if Tony abused him, hit him...? It was laughable. The idea that he would supposedly be happier if he was not actually himself. Steve held a hand over his mouth and struggled to suppress incredulous laughter, pressing his face against Tony's shoulders as Frond went on about kneeling and how beneficial it was.  Oka,y Steve had to admit. It
Tony looked at Steve fondly, remembering how he'd slammed Happy to the ground the first time they'd met.  "...I sure do," he agreed.  He gave his head a little shake to clear it.  "...feisty and inexplicably socially conscious.  Which brings us back to your charity idea.  Yeah, I say, go for it.  Rogers's School for Wayward Omegas.  Or whatever.  It'll make you look good, and like I said, tax breaks like crazy if you're heading one of those foundations.  Just don't do anything with reproductive rights.  If you start passing out birth control and suppressants, you'll make a lot of enemies.  People aren't ready for that.  Focus on education or something.  No one can really be against education, right?"
Despite wanting to panic, Steve still made it to the toilet. He was pretty sure he managed to pee in the bowl but it was hard when he couldn't actually see it.  He made a mental note to leave Tony's maids a nice tip.
"Yes... yes. Okay. It's a base. We think we might have a Winter Soldier lead. We don't know if he's there or not, but there might be some answers.  The base is dedicated to the recruitment and study of enhanced persons.  Mutants, mostly, but it's a facility that would have the equipment to work on the Winter Soldier as well. It shouldn't be too much of a fight.  Just a basic in-and-out stealth mission, intel collection.  We thought we'd offer."
"...never say what again?" he asked, trying to remember the last thing he'd said before the headache had hit him.  "...that we're together?"
"Oh, shut up, what do you know about it, Robot-dick?  Mute," snapped Tony. "...jerk... four minutes... we need to work on that, clearly."  He kissed Steve's neck sweetly before going to grab a suit. He'd tie his tie in the car.
.  Maybe Captain Rogers was a national symbol back in the forties, but it's the twenty-first century, and I, for one, don't feel like an omega crying out for special treatment is really how I want my country represented."
"Yes! Yes, please... wanna feel your mouth Alpha, please. I'll be good. I'll be good I promise." Steve was evidently thrilled at the idea and wriggled even more, letting out a low whine as Tony closed his lips around the head of his dick.  Steve happily groaned, working his body between Tony's mouth and fingers.
Phil didn't ask any questions, waiting for Steve to explain what had happened.  It was a likely possibility that Steve had already been assaulted but he was going to let Steve volunteer that, not immediately begin prying.
Tony hugged Steve back, nuzzling into his strong, broad chest.  He shivered when Steve whispered into his ear, but couldn't quite shake the anxiety that always accompanied sobriety.  Two drinks?  In a whole day?  Tony needed a damned bottle.  But Steve seemed so happy and he couldn't stand to take that away, so he nodded slightly.  They could bargain later.
Bucky. It wouldn't be the first time.  Was it supposed to be comforting, or a warning?  Unclear.  Often he'd had the sense of Bucky coming, or his arrival, usually when Steve was getting creamed in a back-alley brawl and Bucky appeared to save him.
"I'm not drunk.  I'm just a tiny bit tipsy," said Tony petulantly, taking his shake and sipping it loudly.
Downstairs, Aria had opened the back windows to smoke and she was pacing in a zig-zag, stepping around the orchids and the two staff that were attempting to arrange them to clear space for the party.  "Good morning, Steve," she said with a smile. "...Mac and Sitwell just stepped out to make a report. You look great."
They had one last final charge with Cooper on Steve's shoulders, their pile of snowballs rested precariously in Cooper's lap and Steve's pockets. Although he couldn't start throwing until he'd set the boy down (safety first, and all that). When the final blow ended up being a headshot to Natasha, ruining her once-perfect hair, it was decided it was a draw.
Hawley blinked and actually looked surprised for a moment, like she'd been expecting a fight or at least some protests. She straightened up in her chair. "We're prepared to review the situation in six months time at the very earliest, and even then we can not guarantee an increased amount of freedom. And if something happens which means we want to reinstate the ankle monitors, then we will do so immediately. Do you have therapy set up already?"
Brent nodded.  "Yes, we're in communication.  He testified at the trial that shut them down.  But that was one camp. We want to get them all.  We don't want this to end up like the hydra, where you cut off one head and have two grow in its place."
Brock still had his hands in his hair. Steve didn't want to admit it was calming. Goddammit. He was glad he didn't work for these people anymore.
Time slowed to a crawl and Tony watched Steve's body arc through the air, coming to an abrupt stop as it hit a wall.  Tony felt like he was being impacted himself; all the air left his lungs; he could have sworn his heart stopped for a moment; he was watching his omega get hurt, maybe even killed, and he couldn't stop it, there was no time...
Tony had already automatically begun to bristle on Steve's behalf, but Steve seemed a hell of a lot more upset by the tesseract than by any of his usual status civil rights stuff.  No one had yet explained what the hell the tesseract actually
Whilst the two of them were arguing about smoothies Steve was pawing at the door. He was naked as the day he was born and pink all over. He was both sweating and shivering, eyes glazed over as he tugged at the door handle uselessly. He couldn't think. He had caught a whiff of an unbonded Alpha, and he
you could get away with, you couldn't. This is the day you regret ever thinking you could do this to us." He squared right up to her. Melinda was tall, especially in her heels. She was a dominating Alpha but Steve was full of a righteous and quiet kind of fury and he stared her right down.
"...Steve, everyone loves you.  They loved you before you were unfrozen.  You were like America's Queen of England... you were like the living embodiment of Uncle Sam or whatever.  You stood for everything this country is supposed to. You should read the stories about you... how you rescued hundreds of POWs, how you... in basic, they say some guy threw a grenade down and you threw yourself over it without even thinking.  You were this incredible, well-spoken, heroic son of a bitch. And then when you were unfrozen and came out as omega and now you're a big civil rights crusader... people
Tony swore mentally at himself for the slip.  "...I only heard a little bit when I first tuned in," he lied.  "Hey, speaking of eavesdropping, guess who got ahold of SHIELD's intercom records?  Wanna see what Clint is up to in New Mexico?"  He gave Steve another tug.  "Or we can go have a celebratory fuck in the pool."  He turned around and wrapped his arms around Steve's waist, resting his head on Steve's chest to listen to his heartbeat.
They were fighting. A whole lot of them, including some omegas.  He could see Tony having it out with the dog guy in the center and they looked like they could seriously hurt each other. Their hackles were up and teeth were being bared.  Steve sighed loudly. Let Tony get beaten up, or damage his bravado by intervening...?
They sent Clint and Natasha the flowers.  Red ones, at Steve's request. Clint sent Steve a lot of thank you messages with excessive amounts of sun emojis. Natasha just sent one:
Trey grinned. "You got arrested? I thought Captain America was supposed to be all wholesome and shit?"
Iron Man didn't need emotions to keep the world safe.  Didn't need friends, either.  Didn't need anything.
Clint sighed. "Maybe he just got good. You did train him, Nat," he pointed out, voice thick with sleep. "If you want, we could always tell SHIELD--"
"...Tony.  I know you can hear me.  This isn't the Tony Stark I know.  The Tony Stark I know never gives up and never sits around pitying himself like this.  Tony, Natasha told me what happened.  I don't know all the details, but I know this.  You mated Steve, and you two are scent-mates, and you love him, and you were the happiest I've ever heard you when you called and told me about it."
Steve squeezed his hands again and lead him back to bed. It would be hard to get Tony to try and eat now no doubt. "I'm just gonna grab you a coffee," he said and kissed his forehead before disappearing for a moment.
"Already on it," said Pepper, concentrating as she tied up the knot.  "...there. Okay. Now, listen. I'm not going to sugar-coat this. Steve, people love you but there's a lot of backlash from the more conservative side of things.  You caused a political crisis and frankly you're getting away with it, and being an omega, there's a lot of protests. So I want both of you to be aware that there's going to be protesters outside of Bonaventure and they're going to be saying a lot of nasty things and holding a lot of nasty signs.  Happy, Tom, Marco, Daston, Ido, and Bethany are your detail."
Those two words earned him a retraining session.  By the end of it, his brain was static, electricity having swept away the remains of the ashes of those words, and even if he could have remembered them, he wouldn't have dared uttered them again.  They sat him on his cot and he didn't move, eyes unfocused, once again unburdened by emotions, feelings of arousal, memories, or fog-drawings of wings.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Tony.  I told Natasha because she's my friend.  And she knew anyway because it was in my files.  And I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed, because I- I was scared you wouldn't want me.  I thought he was dead.  I thought it was
"It was hell.  Didn't you say you'd come up with a... a preventative method for us?  It's nearly fall. Is Steve still going to cycle normally?" asked Tony.
you." Steve breathed, voice trembling a little in what was probably anger. "You can't force me to keep hidden anymore. You can't bug my goddamn apartment. And you can't make me spy. I can't
"It's fine, just... try not to let Tony get into any more tiffs.  You're not a piece of meat, Stan  Feel free to be rude to people if they're treating you that way.  Tony will stand up for you.  He acts like he doesn't care about omega rights, but I know he does."  She reached for a flute of champagne, sighing softly, trying to calm down.  Tony's actions didn't just reflect badly on him, but on her and on the company.  As a new CEO, and a woman, she had a vested interest in presenting herself well.
"Yes," said Piper.  Tony looked at her wrist; she had on several bracelets made of braided embroidery thread, like something a kid would make at summer camp.
"We've got the right Clint. He is deaf," Steve assured Trickshot quickly. He turned to Tony and explained. "I've seen Natasha sign to him before."
"...may I... see it?" asked Tony slowly, eyes on the box, one hand still stroking the rose petals.  He didn't want to touch the box. He just wanted Steve to show him. Five bucks? Did he mean five thousand or something?
Donner looked surprised.  He actually looked at Steve; his hand went up to his stomach.  "With a baby?" he asked.
see that stupid jerk," said Tony.  Hammer was one of the few Alphas Tony felt he could handle, and he was itching to put the guy in his place.  The way he'd come on to Steve in Monaco... yes.  If Tony was only going to assert his ownership of Steve over
"--I'm pretty good," said Tony.  That was an understatement. Tony was very, very good.  "I just... I'm still... considering..."
Steve tried to stand but his legs gave away beneath him. He stretched out to Tony on the floor. He could hear fighting. Or rather, he could hear Maria shouting and Tiberius grunting. Steve reached out with fuzziness in his eyes, his fingertips brushing against Tony's shoulder.
"It was a sharp pain at first," Steve said quietly. "And now it just kind of... aches, if that makes sense?"
"That's Steve's decision.  Not yours," said one of the doctors pleasantly.  A beta, Tony noted.  One who had no idea what it was like to be an Alpha, the drive to protect omegas, the desperation to shield Steve.
Steve came over Tony's fingertips and clenched around his member as he did so, groaning lowly as he rolled out his orgasm with slow rocks of his hips.
"Oh, shut up, you love touristy stuff.  I saw those photos of you and Clint and Nat hanging out in Washington," said Tony.  He was thinking back to when he and Steve had first bonded, to the pictures on his fridge.  There had been the one of Steve giving a cheeky thumbs-up next to his own gravesite, and Natasha and Clint giving each other bunny ears in front of the Washington Monument, and--
"Lots of buddy-buddy photo ops," confirmed Pepper.  "--page three, a list of media coverage, highlighted in
'Plan B' consisted of black slacks, a dark red shirt and a dark grey waistcoat. The tie was black and plain to match but the left breast pocket of the waistcoat had Santa's cartoon head peaking out of it. It was cute. For Aria, at least. "There you go," Steve told him with a bemused smile and leaned down to kiss his cheek before pulling away to get dressed himself.
He nuzzled a kiss onto Steve's lips, his hands running over Steve's body lovingly.  He hadn't forgotten Gleason's warning about using protection; the condoms were on the bedside table.  Tony was hungry and his head was pounding, but he didn't care about that. He just wanted to pleasure his omega and then go to bed for twelve hours.  The events in that bunker had taken a lot out of him. Hell, he was even considering taking up smoking again.
"Just us sounds good," he whispered. "You could show me some of your favourite films, catch me up with this century when we're not, you know..." His cheeks flushed a little, skin blushing pink as he inferred at all the constant fucking they'd been doing. Even with the serum he was beginning to get a little tender down there. But he also kind of liked it...
The EMTs had come to Steve like moths to a flame; Phil handed off the kit to one of them, and Steve found himself being pushed down onto a gurney and an IV pushed into his arm.
Five.  Only five had left, the other thirteen still on the stage.  Some looked longing or envious, clearly wanting to go but lacking the courage.  Yet some had the same looks of anger and disgust as the Alphas in the room. Some were glaring at them just as harshly, and clearly agreed that Steve was dangerous, his ideas radical and crazy.
"And..." Steve pushed away to stand right in front of Tony, smirking faintly. "The reason I keep 'whining' about you slapping my ass is because you're not sorry you did. Not sorry at all."
"I'm going to recommend both of you stay here overnight for observation," said Dr. McCloud, scribbling notes to herself in a folder marked with Steve's name.  It was strange to see his birthday displayed on the plastic hospital wristband he was wearing; Tony stared down at it.  July 4th, 1918.
"It would piss off all the Alphas but they couldn't complain, right?  Since I'm an Alpha? There's no rules against Alphas wearing collars, right?"
Steve didn't dream about Bucky anymore. He felt both relieved and sad- the final point of contact seemingly severed for now. A month after the attack Natasha texted to let him know that Fury was fully recovered, which was a relief. After everything... Fury wasn't allowed to die.  Not after they survived all of that together.  Steve texted him but received no reply.  He tried to call but was directed to his voicemail.  He took a hint and stopped trying to contact him.
Steve sighed quietly as Tony pulled him closer, his legs loosely wrapping around the other's hips as he felt Tony's own arousal press up against him. His vision was a little blurry and his eyes were wet as he looked up at Tony. His cheeks were wet too. Had he been... crying? Huh.
Steve took the pill and downed the whole glass of water. He nearly dropped the glass but Tiberius caught it in time. He shivered a little at the graze of teeth near that sensitive spot on his neck.  Steve swallowed.
He reached behind Steve's ear and felt his neck.  Soft, warm, dry. Not a single bump or dimple to indicate where the fuck the stupid scent glands even were.
it's hardly my fault if you're dumping a bunch of unstable compounds into the soldiers I'm supposed to be programming!  That's a variable I can't-- yes, of course the Winter Soldier is still-- now you listen, there were plenty of subjects enrolled in Project Guiding Star that
"I thought you'd never ask," he murmured back to Steve.  He had just finished up a conversation with an ex-member of the EPA about nuclear energy and was feeling worn out.  "Go speak to the Ellises, thank them, reassure them we won't blow any shit up anytime soon again if we can help it, and say something about how you look forward to seeing them at your charity dinner.  Then we can blow this popsicle stand."
"The authorities?" Steve's eyes flew open wide. "No, please don't- I didn't mean any trouble at all, I swear.  Please just call my ma-"
"I'm blocking this number," replied Tony, and he plucked Steve's phone and hung up.  He looked at Steve worriedly. "...Donner can't stay here. It's game over if Gideon talks to him.  He should go stay with George, at least until he can stand up for himself. ...we should go check on him."  Tony wasn't sure why he was suddenly so concerned with Donner. Maybe because he looked so much like Tony's mate, or because they were related.  In any case, Tony found he had a vested interest in Donner's welfare.
He shifted his weight again, trying not to dig his erection into Steve's leg, even though it was difficult because Steve was practically sitting on his lap.
"...Steve's got jealousy issues.  He'd go crazy if I bought an omega in front of him.  I'm looking for someone who maybe, uh... could provide omega services, discreetly."
Tony groaned internally and strode away.  He needed a break and Steve was MIA, probably off signing autographs with one hand while saving someone with the other hand.
"...do I wish I could stop thinking?  Yeah. Every day. That's why I drink.  That's why I have sex. It turns my brain off.  Every day, constantly, there's just... so many thoughts.  It's overwhelming. And when I get drunk, I feel... normal, I guess.  I feel like I relate to people better. There's less noise in there."
"Hey," Steve returned softly and went to sit down next to him, smiling faintly at the invitation. "I... I imagine there won't be much to show. I assume it's changed a lot in the past few years, huh? Aria's thrown the word 'hipster' around a lot. Whatever that means." He went quiet at the mention of his mother. Steve distantly remembered his amnesia after the ice, not being able to remember his mother's face.  Guiltr tugged at his gut. But he could always remember the day she died vividly, the way she'd clung to his hand so tightly...the way Steve had cried when Bucky had made him let go.
