The archangel hums around a mouthful of cereal, raising an eyebrow. After swallowing, he points his spoon at Castiel. “Yet you stayed late?”
“I have never had occasion to try it, so why not,” the angel finally says. The small glint in Dean’s eyes makes Castiel’s wings flutter as he looks back down at his menu. Dean notices the happy motion and turns a smile to the waiter. Nathan glances at Castiel with a small frown before looking back at Dean.
While Dean focuses on breathing, the angel tilts his head up with a finger. Castiel starts at the clerical collar, kissing each freckle he comes across. He tugs on Dean’s earlobe with his teeth, laughing when it causes the man to jump. He sighs against the Dean’s neck, biting the skin when he sees the goosebumps rise. Dean’s hands move from the angel’s shoulders to his hips, pulling him closer while pushing him away. The priest rocks against Castiel’s thigh.
This is crazy, ridiculous even. He’s capable of finding love on his own, without having to dish out 4,000 dollars to take the easy road. Dean never took the easy road. He cut his way through all obstacles and always came out on the other side. Sam always complained about his resolve, but this is different. He’s putting his faith in something that isn’t even human, something that can kill him faster than a single heart beat.
“I’ll remember that,” James says as he lets go of Dean’s hand. He clumsily grabs for his wallet, taking out the bills to pay off his tab.
“I’m thankful for Ellen’s good food, ‘specially the pie. I’m grateful for my family, my son, and my health. And I’m grateful for friends who stay by your side.” Dean holds his glass up, the others mimicking him. “Happy Thanksgiving, y’all. Now, let’s eat.”
“’nother order?” he asks around the lollipop. He sits on the side of Balthazar’s desk, kicking his legs as he reads the screen.
Dean gasps, stomach dropping and heat rushing through his veins. Running a hand through his hair, he takes in all of the underwear in front of him. He chuckles, laughter growing and filling the entire apartment. Castiel watches him, smiling as Dean holds his stomach and doubles over.
Castiel takes the chance to take in his surroundings. The building is nice, the air cool. The air pushing out from the vents tickles his hair as he follows Dean through the maze of cubicles. The human casually greets person after person, his smile as bright as his soul. Dean’s comfortable with these interactions, even playfully winking at a secretary as he passes her desk. Castiel pauses, tugging at both their souls to look into their connection. Dean’s soul sours around the secretary's, the color of their future moments a sickly yellow with sparks of maroon. Castiel frowns and pulls his grace back, wondering why Dean would flirt with someone he couldn’t possibly be interested in.
“That was… something…” Dean mumbles into Castiel’s hair. The honey scent fills his nose, makes his smile grow as he lies his head back.
“Would you like a grocery bag for your clothes?” Castiel asks, picking up the folded pairs on the floor.
Castiel frowns, turning his attention to the storm outside the car. He raises a hand to touch his fingertips to Dean’s forehead, to transport them to the overhang by the door. Dean grabs his wrist and shakes his head.
The sound of water splashing fills the kitchen as Gabriel starts cleaning his dishes. Castiel turns around and watches his brother work, still squinting. He pulls his wings close to his back, body stock still as he goes through his memories of training. The process of matchmaking is simple, but there is something special about soulmates. Something designated by God himself, and it’s beautiful. But every relationship creates a different reaction.
what he’s doing, he’s squeezing Castiel’s bicep under the fabric of Dean’s henley. Cas doesn’t look away from his charge as the human touches him. Cas doesn’t tense up like either them expect. Instead, the touch causes him to relax. That warm connection comforts Castiel more than it should. He should be the one comforting Dean.
Responding to the subtle transition in body language, Dean steps closer. His fingers twitch, as if he wants to reach out for the angel and Cas’s grace pounds like it has it’s own heartbeat.
“Thank you,” Castiel gasps out, hand reaching out to grab Dean’s neck and pull him into another kiss. Dean feels tempted to lean their combined weight into the shower wall so he can really press into Castiel’s wings and explore his sides. The curve of Castiel’s arms and thighs are impossible to ignore though, demanding the full attention of Dean’s touch. Dean knows Castiel won’t admit it, but he preens under the attention, leaning into every moment of contact. Dean mouths at Castiel’s throat, tasting the ghost of the ocean scented shampoo they all started using. It tangs on his tongue, but quickly disappears. Castiel tilts his head and grabs Dean’s waist to pull him closer. They both shiver, the heat enveloping them nothing compared to the bonfires trapped under their skin.
The tabby purrs, jumping from his perch to follow Castiel to the door. Checking the peephole first, Castiel’s eyes widen. A man, about his age with a slightly taller build, stands on the other side of the door. The stranger bounces on his toes, looking around at the other apartments. Despite the fish eye perspective, the stranger’s distorted features are attractive. Unlocking the door, Castiel opens it.
The motion of their bodies becomes a harmony. Their hips press together, each man exploring the other carefully. Despite the their constant movements, the insistent press of Castiel’s thigh against Dean’s crotch, both are hesitant as they touch each other. Both search for those places that make the other jump or gasp or shudder. Castiel chuckles when Dean jump in surprise as Cas squeezes his ass. Dean laughs breathlessly as well, noting how much he loves the other man’s laugh. Or just his voice.
Dean and Lisa stand in the doorway. Castiel pulls his wings back, still smiling. His wings press closer to his shoulders when he notices Lisa and Dean staring at him as well, but Ben’s excitement soothes Castiel’s nerves.
Smile still on her face, Ellen makes her way back to the kitchen to help the chef. Jo brings Dean a plate with a burger and some fries. “Thanks, Jo.”
At lunch, Garth, Benny and Crowley push Dean away from their table. They shoo him like a pigeon, snickering and whispering among themselves.
The hunter can barely see the angel, his face swollen in a way he’s familiar with. He remembers talking Cas out of Naomi’s spell, of saving him from Rowena’s curse. He hears himself say the words he always did, the ones he always told the angel, the ones he used to hide the ones he should have said all along.
The three words seem so simple, but they hit Castiel’s grace hard. They carry weight the angel’s heard before. I need you. Don’t make me lose you too. We’re family. The need, the want, the love in Dean’s eyes and voice push Castiel over the edge. He comes with a soft groan of Dean’s name. His muscles weaken and he relaxes against the steering wheel. He smiles at Dean as the hunter continues to move his fist over his erection, using Castiel’s come as extra lubricant.
Castiel’s lips stretch in the cutest way when he smiles. A little curl of his lip that Dean notices now that he’s fixed on the man’s mouth. He also has a little stubble that shapes the sharp curves of his jawline. Biting the corner of his lip, Dean looks away.
Both angels nod, leaving Castiel to his thoughts. Cas stands, stretching out his arms above his head. Some of his bones crack from sitting in the same position for so long, a reminder that his body is very human despite his wings. Castiel’s reflection also stretches out his wings, and the cupid notices the bright red color of his shirt. The same Henley Dean had let him borrow a week ago.
“I do not understand what you mean,” Castiel says, biting the inside of his cheek like he saw Dean do seconds before. The pain takes him out of the moment, but then heightens every other sensation.
That one moment of connection, their shared breath, how the hunter gasps, all of it, makes Cas’s grace brighten even more. Gives him the strength to do what he knows needs to be done.
The person he laid down for, the person he didn’t raise a hand against when he had the Mark. The person he found humanity in when he was a monster. The one he gripped tight and raised from Perdition.
“No problem,” Dean tugs his wash rag from his belt loop and starts to wipe down the counter. “Ya look like you’ve gone through the ringer today. Ain’t nothin a lil sugar can’t fix is what my momma always said.”
Before Dean can even process what the cupid’s words could possibly mean, his cell phone buzzes in his pocket. Dean frowns a little, digging it out. When Lisa’s name lights up his screen, Dean’s stomach drops. “Shit, Lisa’s here.”
“So?” Dean asks, taking a long drink of his beer. Castiel mimics his charge, finishing the beer with an audible gasp.
Castiel squints at the counter top. “In any case, Dean just wished to spend more time together before I begin the search for his soulmate.”
Dean snorts and Castiel beams up at him. Ben looks over Castiel’s shoulders, eyes still wide as he steps into the apartment with his overnight bag.
He’s wearing his favorite pair of jeans with a soft t-shirt and dark red flannel, and he feels confident as he enters the bar. The sounds of pool balls cracking against each other and classic rock fill his ears. The air smells of grease and beer and sweat. The lights are dim, giving the room a warm feel. Jo smiles at him as he walks up to the bar. Straddling the seat, he grins back.
There’s a disturbance in his apartment not much later. Dean’s not sure how much later, startling awake when he hears glasses clink in his small kitchen. Dr. Sexy still plays on the TV, but it’s a different episode. Dean slowly stands, picking up one of the empty beer bottles. If anything, he can slam it against the intruder’s head before tackling the bastard to the ground.
Dean hums. The sound rumbles between them like the impala’s tires on the highway. It’s a sure sound, one of comfort. Dean presses closer when Castiel teleports them to his bedroom. His eyes droop as he whispers before falling asleep, “You always do.”
As he turns to stardust, a supernova so bright it would wipe out planets, he can hear so many voices. He hears the voices of his brothers and sisters, of Crowley, of Bobby and Ellen and Jo, every human he ever came in contact with. He can hear Sam thanking him, see him smiling. He can hear Dean telling him he loves him, that he’s needed. He hears the voice of His Father.
“Maybe Ellen’s right, Bobby. I ain’t seen him around before. ’N ya know how Sam keeps track of all the crossroads. He would have drawn him. I’d remember.”
His lips tingle with whatever electric current coursed through Castiel’s body when they kissed. It tickled when he drank from the cold glass bottles. He stared at the black screen of the television, wondering if he should try to distract himself with mindless plot lines instead of thinking about
Shaking her hand, Castiel hopes his smile appears polite rather than strained. Jo’s wariness of him causes his wings to tense up. Before he can feel uncomfortable under her curious gaze any longer, Ellen makes a surprised sound. She takes the wine from Castiel’s hand, eyes warm when she looks up.
“Quit teasin, Cas,” Dean mumbles, pulling the angel closer. Castiel laughs to himself before kissing the juncture of Dean’s neck and shoulder.
Gabriel dries the dishes and puts them away, wings flapping slightly as he stands on his tip toes. Castiel stares into space as he contemplates what his brother said. With a decisive nod, Castiel stands. “I’m going to go to bed. I will probably be gone before you wake up. Dean goes to work very early.”
The sound of the words ring in Castiel’s grace, makes him shudder. Lucifer says it with such conviction, the tone flat but hinting at concern, even love. Cas wonders if he actually sounds like that, grace warm with embarrassment. Lucifer smirks and rolls his eyes at his brother.
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel says, rubbing his sweating palms on his trenchcoat. “If you do not approve of me taking on this position, I am happy to report back to my employer and request for another cupid to assist you.”
Clearing his throat, Dean leans over and bumps his shoulder against Castiel’s. “Wanna stay for dinner? I’m makin’ chicken fajitas.”
Castiel nods against Dean’s chest, moving his hands so they can rest on the priest’s shoulders. He clenches his eyes shut, prepares himself to teleport away from the man, to erase Dean’s memories of him. Castiel isn’t sure why he didn’t question his motives earlier, why he didn’t think about how his grace would react to sex. He just hopes that he can leave Dean with the feeling of satisfaction, the feeling that he doesn’t have to hide who he is from himself.
“I’ve had a connection with her since she was freed… Through the Mark, ya know. And a little while ago I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Like someone was choking me and burning my neck. Just like when the Mark felt like it was burning. And that connection, it seems dead now.”
Ignoring his brother, Castiel watches Dean. How his eyes search Cas’s, how they show his every emotion. The darkness there shows his worry, his fear, but something lights up when he looks at Cas, like there’s hope. They’d always been able to communicate without saying much, unspoken agreements that Cas held just as dearly as Dean’s words.
Dean turns on his heel to walk away so he can share the news and to not freak Cas out with his excitement. He stops mid-turn, repositioning himself to plant a quick kiss on Cas’s cheek. The freshman jumps, gasping and touching his skin when Dean pulls back.
“He kissed me,” Castiel whispers, still staring at his knees. Admitting to what happened makes Castiel’s heart skip a beat again. Shivering, Cas pulls his wings further around himself to hide his face.
Dean tilts the angel’s head back as he slides closer into his personal space. Castiel’s skin pulses with the warmth of the hot water. Dean’s gaze trails from the open sky of Castiel’s eyes, down the sharp cliff of his nose, to his plush lips. “Mean it, Cas. I’m not fucking around.”
“Ya want a bite to eat? Benny ’n I are scrapin together some pies. Cherry’ll go great with the whiskey. On the house.”
What used to be late nights hustling pool and drinking is now working in an office twice the size of his bedroom, having a paycheck with more than one zero tacked on the end and having partial custody of his 8-year-old son. And, surprisingly, he’s okay with it. The life he was living before, it was even lonelier than the one he lives now. At least he has a nice place to go home to, at least his brother is as successful as he is, at least he has a son that he can still see.
Shaking the thoughts from his head, Dean focuses his thoughts on the tasks at hand. He watches his hands methodically wash each dish, then dries them and puts them away. He wipes down the counter with a Clorox wipe, smiling at the finished product. He goes about opening all of blinds, letting late morning light fill the living room and kitchen. Outside the windows, the sun beats down on the parking lot. Kids race by, moms and dads hurrying to follow. A little noise from the small park across the street leaks into his apartment and his smile grows. He should enjoy a weekend alone. With Ben at home, it means he can do whatever he pleases.
Gabriel opens his arms out to the dark haired angel, a grin lighting up his face. “Cassie! We were just talking about you.”
This Sunday, heat coils like an angry snake in the Devil’s Backbone, but folks still laze about. Garth plays a slow tune on the piano, filling the air with bloated notes. Dean works in the back with Benny rolling dough to make pie crust while Charlie tends to the bar. Dean hears the front door swing open and
Dean stood there dumbfounded. He didn’t know whether to correct Aiden for yelling at an adult, cry because this was obviously his fault, or profusely apologize for not being papa, and being the reason he wasn’t there. After the outburst, Aiden seemed to have gone limp. Dean finished putting Aiden in the harness and closed the door.
“Sweetheart, we need to be honest with ourselves, you need professional help. I can give you all the support in the world but it’ll all mean nothing if we don’t get you the tools you need to pull yourself out of this….” Ellen gestured vaguely in the air.
“I don’t know what to do Charlie!! Its been days he won't wake up…..no…. those files are sealed for a reason!!! Charlie don’t you dare!! They said all we can do is wait, the specialist already flew in.”  Dean took a few centering breaths; Charlie was saying everything to get him to calm him down on the other end of the line. When they finally hung up Dean flung his cell phone against the wall. “Damn it!!!”  Cas could hear his husband falling apart but wasn’t quite in control of his body enough to open his eyes just yet.
“Well I do have plans, but I can spare a few minutes, is there something that requires my assistance? “ Castiel turned to grab a small notepad out of his messenger bag. He always processed things better if he could write them down. “ Well, spring break is coming up next week.” Daphne was beginning to blush but was determined to get through her obviously rehearsed speech. “There is a group of us that are going to Cabo San Lucas for the week, and I would really like to know if you wanted to go with us.” Daphne rushed through those words so quickly Castiel almost didn’t hear them all.
Dean slowly opened his eyes reveling in the feeling of being wrapped in the arms of the alpha of his dreams. The last two weeks had felt like a fantasy that he feared he would wake up from. They both admitted their feelings and then Castiel slowly took him apart on the roadhouse floor of all places. Clearly, Castiel was not the innocent and unknowledgeable alpha he’d seemed. He took Dean apart every night, basking in their joint scent and every sound he could pull from his body. The only part to concern him was the fact that Castiel wanted to wait to mate each other. Not getting mated on the roadhouse floor, although it would totally be Deans style, was understandable Castiel deserved something better than that.
On the flip side, the moments of joy also made themselves readily available in his dreams. Dean could easily remember and dream about the mornings he would wake to Cas between his legs. Pulling him from his fantasies, moments where reality was easily better. Those piercing blue eyes looking up at him while sinful lips worked him to completion.
Castiel got into the room and sat the bags on the respective beds. Finally, with a second alone he decided to make a call.
"This song is for someone very special to me, I know it's been a long year and I don't always express myself in the best way. I hope this song explains how lucky I feel to have you in my life. " Dean chuckles to himself before a few practice strums on the guitar.
Samantha pushed Deans' hand away every time he tried to feed her a vegetable. She would dodge around his hand and pick up a new piece of her burger. Ketchup and pickles only. “
“Yes we did dear and I win!! It was so obvious from a young age how much you adored each other, then when you presented I knew it was only a matter of time. We are very happy for you and Dean. I would love to discuss this more but we will see you soon at your graduation. Love you my sweet Castiel.”
he would be old enough to remember. His silence actually only meant one thing, sadness. Aiden never dealt with change well. If there was a call from school about his behavior in the coming days Castiel wouldn’t hold it against him.
“Wait, you said you had an alpha to throw off the trail AND an alpha that you decide you want!! That’s not possible cause Sam was with the crowd watching the whole time how could your boyfriend protect you?!?!” Gabe was practically yelling
“Sammy, Gabe. I would like you to meet Samantha Jean and Lenox Gabriel.” He handed each uncle their namesake and watched the tears well up in their eyes.
Castiel was stuck somewhere in limbo. He could tell that he wasn’t dead but he also wasn’t completely alive either.
“No! I wanted to protect them from seeing me like that!” Castiels punches got harder. “I should’ve never gotten to that point!! But I was lost and lonely and if Dean had just….” Pam interrupted his train of thought.
The guilty look on Deans face and the way he shied away after their brothers left only makes him believe that his presence made Dean uncomfortable, but when they were on the couch they were practically cuddling while watching Deans most recent movie obsession.
Dean walked into the shop looking a little disheveled but better than she had expected, mainly because she hadn’t expected to see him at all. Cas went into the hospital yet again so she had passed off his work to the other guys.
“That’s Hershey Park, we’re going there tomorrow. This is Chocolate World, now we’re not here for a tour..”
“Dean I don’t know what or who made you believe any of that stupidity, but you and they are completely wrong. Dean! You are an amazing, caring, and beautiful person. You have such a wonderful giving personality and that is why you have such close friends that you refer to them as your family. You’re strong and ooze confidence. You claim to be barely hanging on when you and I both know that you are in the top 10% of your class.” Dean was struck mute at Castiels speech. He had no idea that Castiel saw him that way. ‘
“Well said Red.” Gabriel giggled at his own rhyme. “but first we have some major damage control to do.” The two knew exactly how to apologize and set out to make it happen
Dean made his way up the stairs and pushed the door to the study. “Cas, sweetheart you in here?” The computer was off and the room was dark. Dean closed the door and decided Cas probably was on a run to the store. Dean grabbed a beer and plopped on the couch to wait.
Dean sat at the airport bar a few glasses of whiskey already in his system his duffle bag at his feet.
And that’s an exact quote. He’s convinced he’s ruined this trip for you.” Dean finally turned to look at Sammy in disbelief Cas was leaving? The trip wasn’t over yet, they still had... ”When you decided not to show up to breakfast he booked a ticket on the bus. I’m dropping him off at the station later today.
“But Dean you didn’t even ask me how it went. For all you know I flopped and ruined everything.” Castiel didn’t miss the rolling eyes.
“Oh really Dean? Tell me, if you could do anything to me right now…would you?” His chosen girl of the week embraced his flirtatious ways not knowing that at this point in the night he couldn’t even remember her actual name.  She looked up at him with her midnight blue eyes, not quite the color his heart desired, but close enough. “Youll find out soon enough, let’s get out of here and go back to my place.” Dean wrapped his arm around her waist and led her out the door to his precious Impala, his baby.
“That’s it! File the paperwork, Sam. He’s made his choice.” Castiel sat at the dining room table in the dark sipping on the whiskey Dean had left behind. His voice was more growling that speech.
“Some rich old guy just hired me to restore his 1936 Mercedes-Benz. It’s a 540K Special Roadster. I can't wait. I’m gonna have her purring like a kitten in no time, then paint her all black she’ll be the belle of the ball when I’m done.” Dean was bouncing on his feet talking, he sounded like a kid on Christmas and Sam couldn’t help but poke a little fun.
“Yea sure baby, anything for you.” The tight look on Castiels face pained Dean so much. It hurt, even more, knowing it was him that put it there.
Back home Castiel camped out on the couch while Gabriel used the kitchen for his newest dessert experiment.
“Umm…no well yes he called to tell the kids good night but that was about it.” Castiel held back the hurt he felt, of course, Dean would discuss life choices like that with his brother, but not Castiel. It didn’t matter what Castiel thought if Dean decided to stay there was nothing he could do.
“There are two things wrong with that statement Dean, one, you didn’t drive here and your precious baby is back at your house, two..” Jessica’s voice instantly became louder at this point.” HOW IN THE HELL CAN YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING INTO WORK RIGHT NOW?!?!?”
“I know Missouri, I know. But this way, I can save other people.” Cas thought he would be anxious or even in denial when this day came, but he wasn’t. He was serene. Resolute in what was going to and had to happen. “I can’t put them through this rollercoaster of heartache when I know I can end it. Make sure they get these when I go back for surgery?”
“Pam says that I’m doing pretty good. Oh, that’s my therapist by the way.” Cas noticed the confused look on Sams’ face. “She’s...unconventional to say the least.” Cas thought about his initial response to Pam and her punching bag, workout, yoga mat, and Zen garden. He barely gave her a chance in the beginning, but she was his last chance.
“Shh..they may not be able to smell you in here but they can still hear you. We gotta whisper or be completely silent.” Dean peeled Cas’ arms from around him and handed him a bottle of water. Luckily Dean remembered his phone, he sent a text to Sam that Cas had made it now all they had to do was wait.
Sam pulled out his cell phone yet again trying to reach Dean. He needed to be there. If for nothing else to be able to say goodbye. Sam needed him there to yell at him. To scream that it was all his fault. To tell him how if he had just come home Castiel would still be here. He would be conscious; he would be happy. Sam was pulled out of his own mental spiral by the rapid beeping of a machine. An alarm was going off. Sam jumped to his feet and screamed for a nurse.
“Now I want you to come and tell me all about your day and that crepe while I pull dinner out of the oven and put together plates for the kids. And don’t leave out any of the details.” Dean lifted Castiel so that he could stand up.
“Dean, Dean, Dean. Did you really think you’d be able to get away with this without me knowing?” Dean looked up to see Ramiel standing on the other side of the glass speaking to him through an intercom system.  “You’re one of my best, I trained you myself. I was hoping one day I could move you over to management, and this is how you repay me?” The quiet controlled rage in the timbre of his voice told Dean all that he needed to know.
By the time the other two came down, it looked as if Dean had decided to take a shower with all of his clothes on while Claire was all smiles with damp hair.
When Dean walked back in carrying a mug of tea for Castiel and a mug of coffee for himself, Cas couldn’t even bother to pretend to be embarrassed.
Waiting up for his brother to drop off his meds, Dean started to think back on the last couple of weeks, wondering how he could have missed his husband going through something so serious. If he wasn’t getting on a plane in the morning, he would be halfway through a bottle of bourbon with a pie as a second course.
A million questions went through Sams' head, did that mean that Dean was a match? Did Cas not want to be saved? Or was Dean not a match and Cas didn’t want him to feel guilty for it? Was Cas ever going to say anything about the lab results? Either way, only Cas would ever know the answer.
“Papa, today we worked on painting and mixing colors!! Did you know if you mix blue and yellow you get green?” Claire yelled over the ongoing Minecraft narration Aidan was giving. Cas glanced at his daughter in the rearview mirror. Finger paints…that explains the multi-color streaks in her hair.
“So what is it this time?” Castiel didn’t even bother to let Dean reach his seat and get comfortable, the only time Dean seemed to need to talk is when he was leaving again. Chasing after some magical amount of money to fulfill a space that money wasn’t going to ever satisfy.
“You and I both know that I can’t do that” Jess didn’t even bother to look over at Dean. She shook her head and continued the drive to her home. “Sam would kill me and Cas would get up from his hospital bed to tell me how wrong I was if I took you anywhere but to food and a bed.” Jess took on what could only be defined as a ‘mom voice’ and tilted her head in Deans direction.
Then there was one that Castiel couldn’t remember. The woman he was looking at seemed very familiar. Standing there in a wedding dress, with tears in her eyes. Those bright eyes.
Gabriel is leaned against the hood of his car, sucker in his mouth and his arms folded across his chest when the bus pulls up. Castiel gets off and retrieves his bags, without a word, just a shared glance the brothers get in the car.
“Ok spill, what the hell happened?” Charlie plopped down in the booth across from Gabe who already had his hands wrapped around a mug of hot cinnamon cocoa.
“He's never done this before, Aiden has always been a star student. The teacher said he is advanced in his reading and math level and has never caused so much as a peep in her class. How soon can you get here? I can’t leave him in the middle of the floor it’s a safety issue.” The counselor sounded as if she was at a loss for words.
Of all days why did he have to call today? Cas never could lie to Sam, it was something about those puppy dog eyes that they even worked over the phone. It was like he could always see through whatever mask Cas tried to put on.
“Sam you’re hesitating and bumbling as if you assume this is going to upset me. I’m sure having someone speak to the children isn’t the worst of ideas. They have to have many questions about what’s happening. Also, you wouldn’t be here making the request if you didn’t have faith in whoever Dean is working with to resolve his issues.” Castiel flipped to a blank page in his sketchbook and created a quick rough sketch of what seemed to be a ladybug sitting on a mushroom. Clearly the conversation was over as far as he was concerned.
Aiden didn’t know exactly how to answer, he wasn’t much older than her, but older was older. He remembered a little bit of what uncle Sam had told him. “Papa is sick and has to stay with his doctor. When papa gets better, he will come home okay?” Aiden curled around his sister like the overprotective older brother that he was.
“Dean?” Castiels voice was rough as if he’d gargled rocks. “Hey Angel” Deans' voice cracked, he was on the edge of tears. “You still insist on calling me that.” If his voice wasn’t so weak, you’d be able to hear eye roll over the phone. “Well, you’re my guardian angel, Cas” Dean tried a flirty town but he was so busy holding back tears he ended up sounding like a 16yr old girl. “Dean, I can’t talk long but I wanted you to know that I’m awake and ok. Now I want you to do everything Jess says. Don’t make me sick Ellen on you.” Dean knew this was a real threat. Out of town or not Ellen would gladly fly in to give Dean some enforced resting time. “I will Cas. You rest now ok?” There was a bit of a shuffle on the other side of the phone before the call disconnected.
Claire was excited. “Are we going to be able to go to the beach? I want to live near the beach. Then I could meet a mermaid and we’ll be best friends!!”
Dean hung up the phone before his brother could answer. Two weeks early out of the contract? There was only one way to make that happen. He had to take out one of the top five on the board.
“How does she do that?!?” Jess asked Sam as they were stepping in the door of Castiels room. “I told you she’s magic or something.” Sam shrugged.
“Ok, Cas.” Sam got up and walked out of the room, he desperately needed coffee and time to wrap his mind around it all.
Unknown to him Castiel was watching his every move beaming at the joy on his face and in his scent. Castiel looked as if he was staring into the sun with adoration.
This one ended up a little longer than intended but the story just spilled out and had to be told. Ty_R_Bluent that flashback is just for you :-)
The kids, thanks to their uncle Sam, were starting to bounce back. Although Claire had not had any type of change in her behavior yet, Sam had put both children in counseling. He knew from first-hand experience just how much the rest of their lives could be damaged if they didn’t learn to talk through and process everything that they were dealing with and going through. The one person Sam wasn’t really sure how to help was Dean. Dean would never agree to see a shrink on his own even though he seriously needed it. Dean was the king of repression, deep-seated issues that would spill out only after a bottle of whiskey had been ingested.
“Daddy?” Lenox pulled his attention. “If I eat my burger and my vegetables can I have a treat?” He always was the one trying to negotiate a better deal.
“That didn’t go over well with my dad, who found out about some of the negatives in the equation, if ya catch my drift” Dean finally says, shaking his head while looking at the ceiling. “I’ve never seen him so livid… Just a few years outta high school, he forced me into ministry work. I didn’t fight him. Everything I planned on before fell flat, like one of those theatre backdrops that look real.”
The angel stands taller, arms straight by his sides. Vivid blue eyes lock onto Dean’s facial expression, eyebrows furrowed as if Dean’s smile isn’t what he expected. Dean’s heart thuds at the heavy gaze. The blue is bright enough to feature in a cheesy romance novel, bright enough to remind Dean of the dream he’d had the night before. Bright enough to throw him for a loop when the angel starts to speak. “Hello, Dean. My name is Castiel. I believe you requested a cupid this morning.”
“Hello, can I help you?” Castiel says, leaning against the doorframe to make it appear that he’s calm and collected. The stranger’s eyes are a vibrant green with flecks of gold, freckles dotting his cheeks and nose. He has a few wrinkles around his eyes and the corner of his lips, laugh lines Castiel finds endearing. The slope of his shoulders to his waist is defined under his v-neck shirt, but he appears more soft than chiseled.
“S’alright, Cas. You can just bring em back when you come back,” Dean says, offering a smile he hopes is encouraging and not awkward. “When are you coming back anyway?”
“I take it you didn’t wear that suit for me,” Gabriel snorts, scooping more chocolate chips into the batter.
He sits in a lone arm chair next to the couch, both Bobby and him quietly watching the others talk enthusiastically. Every now and then, Dean would look away from his brother and at Castiel. Every time, he found Cas intently watching them with a small smile. Seeing Cas there makes things feel even easier than they normally do, makes the space feel more like home. Dean swallows the feeling when Ellen orders him and Sam to set the table.
Dean looks tense when they appear before the Winchesters. His eyes are darker than usual, something about the shadows under his eyes suggesting he hasn’t been getting much sleep. His shoulders lower when Castiel appears. His facial expression relaxes, lips parting as he sighs in relief. Cas stares at them in his mind as Lucifer keeps their features stoic. His brother softens his body’s eyes when they finally land on Dean, something he never noticed he did before.
Besides that, Dean never enjoyed the idea of going home to his empty apartment. The whole place feels stagnant, nothing like the place he shared with Lisa or his old bedroom at home. Those places were full of life: dirty laundry, cassette tapes and CDs, school work, books, posters, and some trash. It smelled lived in, if not a little gross, nothing like the various fabric softeners Dean started using because he still couldn’t find one he liked.
Dean huffs when Jo shoves him away, but smiles. He looks at Cas, soul more relaxed than Cas has seen in their week together. Dean bumps his shoulder against Castiel’s, causing the angel to rustle his wings and smile. Sam and Jo watch the interaction, Jo with her arm’s crossed over her chest and Sam with raised eyebrows. The younger Winchester moves his hair out of his face, then extends his hand out to the angel.
Dean closes the office door behind him with shaky hands. He turns and leans back against the cool wood, then fist pumps. Castiel reveals himself to his charge, sitting on one of the cushioned arms of a chair on the other side of Dean’s desk. He can’t help but smile as he takes in the human’s happiness. Dean’s cheeks flush when he takes in the genuine grin on Castiel’s face, noting how most of it manifests around the angel’s eyes in laugh lines. Castiel takes it as Dean’s excitement over his success and continues to smile.
Castiel’s wings rustle happily behind him at the request. Even though he never celebrated the holiday, he always felt jealous of humans. Thanksgiving’s about family, about coming together. He never was close to anyone else in the garrison besides Balthazar and Gabriel, and neither of them cared for the tradition. He always spent the day in his room, wondering if the molecules that make up turkey do taste better when in the presence of loved ones. He grins at Dean. “I would be honored to join your family for Thanksgiving.”
He wears a red flannel, fabric hugging his chest and arms in a way that is more provocative than practical. Dean’s dealt with quite a few fae in his time as a bar owner. He never turned them away, long as they kept their deals to the crossroads. Dean stares at the new stranger, smirking as he cleans a glass in an attempt to assert his hold over the bar and his feelings. It isn’t until those eyes struck against his own that his heart stuttered again. Dean is familiar with the feeling when meeting glances with a few attractive women and men he’d seen in neighboring towns. It’s that trip wire in his heart, thrumming a low note and sending explosions through his blood stream. His hand tightens around the glass as he forces oxygen through his lungs.
it. He swallowed, looked Dean in the eyes and told him the honest truth. Showed that shred of self-hatred, gave Dean another piece of himself for safe keeping. And he still knows that Dean kept it safely buried inside his mind where no one else could reach it. Every time Dean looks at him, he can see that spark of fear, that quick scan to make sure he won’t disappear on the brothers. That he won’t walk off and never come back.
Air gushes through the cab, bouncing around them in short bursts. Castiel takes a deep breath, closing his eyes and enjoying the feeling. Dean senses the lack of tension, and turns up the music with a grin.
Dean notices his line of sight, adjusting the collar and laughing. “I should know, seeing as I got ordained little over a month ago. Took me a couple years but my baby brother helped out.”
As they kiss, Castiel takes Dean in hand. Hips buck forward and Dean moans into their kiss, begging for release. While Castiel has little practice, he knows what feels good. As he strokes over Dean’s dick, thumb teasing the slit to spread precome across their skin, Dean breaks their kiss to breathe. Castiel smiles as the hunter pants against his lips.
Balth and his partner glance at each other with knowing smiles. This time, Balth answers the question. His British accent surprises Dean.
Dean speeds up as he weaves through the Monday morning traffic. He quirks an eyebrow at the question. “What?”
Castiel tries to ignore the small leap his heart gives at Dean’s action, smiling at his charge instead. “I would love to.”
Before he even provides an answer, Balthazar and Gabriel enter. The two angels frown as Castiel wraps his wings around himself to make a shroud of blue and black. Balthazar sits on the bed next to Castiel, Gabriel at his feet. They say nothing at first, just let their graces call to Castiel’s. Both his brother and best friend are colored with yellow anxiety. It’s almost nauseating.
The quietness in Dean’s apartment drives him crazier than usual. Sometimes he likes the space, likes having time to himself after all the noise that fills his life. But three days of silence from Castiel and no motivation to go out anywhere makes him restless. He turns the radio on, then off again after the first chords of Can’t Fight This Feeling plays. He washes the few dirty dishes he has, takes out the trash, then cleans his bathroom in a frenzy similar to the week before.
Without saying a word, Cas looms over Dean’s recliner. Cas holds Dean’s cheek in his hand, the touch cooler than Dean remembered. Cas finally looks at him, eyes so dark the blue is gone from them. Dean’s breath catches in his throat and he thinks of pulling away. Instead, he stays stuck as Cas leans in close enough Dean can feel the angel’s breath on his lips. He shudders, but doesn’t close his eyes. He tries to speak again, but nothing comes out. There’s just silence. Not the warm silence Dean had grown accustomed to when he’s with Cas. This silence feels wrong, cold and tense. It makes goosebumps rise on his skin again.
“Dean,” he gasps out, hands scrambling against the human. He grips Dean’s shoulder, squeezing so hard it’s sure to leave a handprint shaped bruise as he drags Dean’s weight against him. Dean groans from both pleasure and pain, eyes drooping closed as his own climax builds.
Taking a deep breath, Gabriel leans closer and puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “I think he does.”
Cas never closes the distance between them. The angel glares at him for what feels like hours before pulling away. Turning on his heel, Cas starts walking away. All Dean can see in the darkness that now shrouds his apartment is those wings glowing pale blue. Dean scrambles to dislodge himself from his chair and chase after Castiel. He starts running into what looks like a railroad tunnel, black surrounding him on all sides. He calls Castiel’s name over and over, but he can't hear his own voice. The only thing in that tunnel is the glowing of Castiel’s wings, which go farther and farther ahead no matter how fast Dean runs. Soon, the glow gets swallowed by the shadows and the man is by himself.
“Not as good as this,” Castiel offers, leaning into Dean’s arm to stay upright. The hunter pauses, looking at the content expression.
Gabriel turns to Balthazar, nodding towards Castiel. Balthazar sighs quietly and shakes his head. “No, Castiel. It does not concern your normal work. Gabriel and I were discussing another matter.”
Castiel cross his arms over his chest, fingers clenching around the sleeves of his trench coat. He watches Dean tip toe around him, closing the door and placing his laptop bag on the kitchen table. “It’s almost been a week, Dean.”
Lucifer sifts through Cas’s every memory of earth, stopping every now and then to smirk or laugh. He pauses on each moment Cas is with Dean, appraises their body language like their pieces of furniture at an auction, and scoffs. He laughs at every prayer, rolls his eyes at every touch and sentiment they shared, snorts at every fight they’ve ever had.
Castiel furrows his eyebrows, trying to recall if he has ever seen such a thing, but comes up short. He squeezes Dean’s shoulder once before pulling away. “If you would prefer, I can remain here during your meeting. I do not wish to make you feel even more uncomfortable during your presentation.”
Trash thrown away, he starts working through the few dishes in the sink. When Ben’s at his place for the weekend, his apartment is full of sounds, smells and boyish charm. The kid left small messes everywhere he walked. Dean smiles fondly at the thought, ignoring the pang of jealousy in his chest. Lisa deserves someone nice in her life, someone who will treat her and Ben good. If this new guy does that, he should be okay in Dean’s book. The logic doesn’t make the loneliness fade though.
Castiel stares at his older brother, frowning. He glances at Balthazar, surprised to find the other angel giving him a similar curious expression. There’s another moment of silence as Cas gathers himself. He’d spent the past three days trying to tell himself to ignore his feelings, to pull himself together enough to face his charge again.
In all honestly, Dean had pondered over the slight tingling sensation he gets in his gut when he looks at the guy.
Pain erupts in their head when Dean’s fist hits the side of Lucifer’s jaw. Cas’s grace roars with happiness, repeating the hunter’s name like a mantra. “Bullshit!”
Castiel shakes his head at the thought. He watches how the sunshine lights up the children’s hair, makes them look like angels. He enjoys the scents of fresh cut grass, the sound of games and mother’s voices. He smiles at the humanity.
Dean looks over at the cupid, once again surprised by the blueness of Cas’s eyes. He nods, unable to find the right words to explain the leftover joy singing in his veins.
Clearing his throat, Dean gets the angel to look at him, an eyebrow raised in curiosity. A tan hand pats the empty space, a soft smile on Dean’s lips. Cas hadn’t seen Dean look so at ease in months and couldn’t help but smile back as he steps forward.
As he lets the conversation flow around him, Castiel feels belonging for the first time since he left Heaven.
Heading back into the kitchen, Dean lets out a deep sigh, rubbing his face. Benny stands by the oven, arms crossed over his wide chest. He raises an eyebrow at Dean. “Wanna tell me what all that was bout, brother?”
“Well… thanks…?” He holds up the bag to make a point. Castiel smiles back, nodding. Dean continues, “You’re the first person I’ve told about this… It’s kind of a relief, knowing that someone knows and doesn’t judge me. Takes a load off, ya know?”
Garth rolls his eyes, taking a huge bite from his own sandwich before speaking. “Just ‘oll with it ‘enny.”
The woman’s smile grows. She nods before pulling Anna aside to speak with her. Ben turns his attention from the couple and towards Castiel. His soul flares, faith bubbling inside him. The brightness makes Cas sway on his feet as he turns to Dean. Raising an eyebrow, Dean holds on to Castiel’s shoulder to keep him from toppling over.
The sound makes Castiel’s grace shiver, wings flaring out. Running with instinct, Cas lifts Dean off the ground, the human’s back still against the wall. He strokes his hand over Dean’s thigh, the other resting against the wall next to Dean’s head. He’s capable of holding up Dean’s weight, but his body spasms with shudders with every movement.
Warmth seeps into Castiel’s fingers as he brings the coffee closer to his face. He inhales the steam rising from the brown liquid. It smells rich. Dean smiles as Castiel inspects his drink.
Jo stares at Castiel for a couple seconds before she shakes her head and writes down the order. When her gaze lands on Dean again, Dean already has an answer. “Jo, Ash, this is Castiel. Castiel, this is Jo and Ash.”
The smell fills his mind and his grace surges pleasantly. Normally eating bothers him and he avoids the action. When in the company of humans, it is viewed as rude to not eat as well because it makes them uncomfortable. Castiel normally followed the rule, but never quite enjoyed the food placed in front of him. Castiel takes another large bite of the burger, grease dripping from his lips and down his chin. The sensation would repulse him in any other situation, but now it adds to the experience. He feels almost human as the muscles in his jaw work together to chew. He closes his eyes, reveling in the mixture of flavors, picking out cheese, tomato, lettuce, even the pepper steak seasoning in the meat. His wings flutter happily.
Castiel takes in dark blue swirl in Dean's soul and his lips turn down into a frown. “Do you wish to talk about it?”
Dean’s brain finally catches up with him and he starts to hear what the men are talking about with the hoss. The smaller man offers a sleazy grin, leaning forward as if he’s about to share a secret with the woman.
Dean’s ears turn hot, knowing Castiel’s words show that they are out together. Jo and Ash look back and forth between Dean and Castiel while the angel waits for Dean’s answer. “Well, yeah. It’s kinda rude to not eat or drink anything when someone takes you out.”
Touching the hunter’s face, he heals Dean with a small smile. Before Dean could react, other than to lean into his angel’s touch, Cas presses his lips to Dean’s forehead. “I love you too…”
He spends hours in the library now instead, reading up on the lore. Even if there is nothing on Amara, he can learn more about other things. He can occupy his mind. He can erase his consciousness of any thought of her and their weird bond. Ground himself.
Castiel kisses Dean’s temple, stroking the base of his skull with his thumb. “I’m here, beloved. Come for me.”
Gabriel’s wings flutter up, feathers rustling like leaves on a tree. His eyes flash with the blue tint of his grace at the memory. The archangel stares at the empty space beside Castiel, hands still holding the dish rag. “I didn’t so much as see it, but taste it. Like chocolate and sea salt caramel. The client’s relationship was smooth, sweet. Our second client, Balthazar handled. He said that it looked like a rose bush grew around the souls.”
"Your request for a cupid has been received. Please expect him or her to arrive at your household no later than 1 p.m. This gives our angels the chance to make sure you are paired with a cupid suitable for your needs.
Dean pushes the door open, eyes immediately scanning the blank walls for the wings he just saw. They’re gone, as he guessed, ghosts lingering in his vision like sunspots. He forces himself to not frown in disappointment, especially when he finds that Castiel has wrapped a damp towel around his waist.  Castiel clears his throat when Dean doesn’t say anything after entering the room. The hunter leans against the lockers and stares at the angel.
Shoving the human away, Lucifer kicks him in the chest. Each word sounds disgusting in his mouth, and Cas pulls away from his brother’s anger and disgust. He holds his chest, pining to help his charge as he pants and coughs on the floor. “He’s weak, just like you humans.”
So with a giant inhale, Dean brushes his hands on his own ratty pair of jeans before pulling out his phone. He takes a second to stare at his friends and survey their expressions. Crowley smirks knowingly, Garth smiles as he eats, and Benny raises an eyebrow.  He stands slowly, trying to not startle anyone around them into looking at him. He keeps his head down as he approaches the freshman.
his grace keens. Dean blinks, his lips twitching into the slightest smile of relief at seeing Cas okay. Cas wants to bury his face in his hands, but doesn’t, too afraid of forgetting his charge’s face. He carefully examines each freckle, each scar on his arms, each shadow of an eyelash on his cheeks, each fleck of gold in his green eyes. Even without control over his body, Cas can still feel Dean’s longing, his relief that they made it through okay.
And that’s something he can’t have. If he had stayed, tomorrow would come and change it all. The morning after that kiss, Cas went back to being Dean’s cupid. Castiel admits to himself he’s a placeholder for what the human really longs for. An angel isn’t a soulmate.
Tonight, he finds Cas sitting on the edge of his bed. He frowns slightly at the angel, taking in his button up, tie, and dress slacks. Castiel’s hands sit in his lap as he looks around the room. When he senses Dean, he jumps and stands up.
Castiel turns on his heel to follow Dean to the bedroom, squinting at Dean as the man starts to undress. Looking at Dean without pants on makes Cas forget what he had been about to say, instead he stares at Dean as he cleans himself off with his sweatpants. When Dean turns to dig around in his dresser, Cas takes the opportunity to look at the man’s backside.
Castiel searches his eyes for a second more before resting his weight against Dean again. He shoves the jeans down enough so he can run his hands over the curve of Dean’s ass. When Dean hums, Castiel grins and kisses along his jaw. He stops at Dean’s ear, growling as he drags a finger from the bottom of Dean’s ass to the small of his back. Dean rocks forward, gasping when Castiel’s voice drops. “Good…”
Soon enough, Crowley, Benny and Garth sit around him with their trays of the normal high school mush.
Dean’s smile falters slightly at the reminder of why Castiel is actually with him. The man scolds himself for forgetting that he paid for the angel’s assistance, that Castiel isn’t there to make friends with him. Castiel is a cupid, not someone he’s supposed to take on lunch dates. He forces the smile to stay on his face and nods in agreement with Castiel.
The angel’s pink cheeks flush a darker red, but he smiles. He kisses the small dimple on Dean’s cheek, a sense of belonging settling in his grace. “I assume that means my coital skills are more than satisfactory?”
“I know, Sammy,” Dean says right before the moment is crashed by Ellen and Jo appearing in the dining room. Ellen starts handing the boys pans and bowls full of food, rubbing her palms together as she looks over her hard work.
Sneering, the priest puts his hand on top of the glass. He pushes it down, staring at the angel’s lips. His fingers clutch at Castiel’s, voice tight. “Don’t say that when I’m trying to not…”
The moment of silence after the question makes Dean’s palms sweat. His bathrobe suddenly feels too heavy over his t-shirt and boxers. Castiel’s soft answer makes his heart hiccup against his ribs. “Yes, Dean.”
There’s a flash of dark colors and Dean’s body slams against the opposite wall. The hunter grunts, head rolling as he looks up at the angel. Lucifer stands, straightening his tie and shaking his head.
Dean chugs down another glass of water, sighing when he finally stops to breathe. Putting the glass down, he rubs his temples. The only thing ridiculous is him. He’s tired of being lonely.
It’s a small town with rustic looking buildings. Cars motor past, people waving at each other from behind their windshields.   Castiel smiles as he passes by them, holding up his right hand whenever they gesture at him. Its late afternoon on a Friday, everyone on their way home from eating out or going out to celebrate the end of the week. Castiel always marveled at how humans spend their days of Sabbath, taking opportunities to try out these activities for himself.
Castiel can feel the pain in his hands, the throbbing in his head, the beating of his heart, the sweat on his back. His grace sparks, lights and roars alongside his brother’s. Instead of falling back, hiding from Amara’s touch, it presses forward. It pushes more energy through his body, works with Lucifer’s to seal her away again.
The grin that graces Ellen’s face barely prepares Dean for the flush of embarrassment coloring his cheeks as Ellen says, “Ya never forget a pretty face, Dean.”
Ripping at the fabric, he pulls up the sleeves of his shirts, scratching himself in his haste. His forearm is scar-free as the heat fades away. He shudders in the bathroom, jumping when his brother opens the bathroom door.
Dean’s eyes widen at the comment and he quickly admits, “I don’t have- I mean… I’m not dating- I’ve been single for a while.”
Dean nods, eyebrows rising in question. He gestures at Baby, shoulders braced even more to prepare for possible rejection. “Can I give you a lift?”
“Good, because I don’t plan on sharing it with anyone. Except maybe you.” Dean winks, causing his friend to blush more.
Dean shakes his head as he finally stands up. He grabs a folder from the backseat, tucking it under his arm. He sticks his tongue out as he figures out how to hold his coffee, keep his bag from swinging forward and hitting the car, and not spill his coffee on himself. Castiel moves around the car and takes the coffee from Dean’s hands, holding it for the man. Dean gives Castiel a small smile in thanks as he locks the car. “Sounds like ya know him well.”
Gabriel eats a couple more bites, eyebrows furrowed as he thinks. His wings flap lightly behind him. “I’m asking as your brother and employer. This is your first client after all. Balthazar and I are gonna check on ya anyway. You might as well spill some of the beans now. In confidence, of course.”
Dean follows his gaze across the courtyard, searching for the boy’s tan trench coat and dress slacks despite the fact Crowley stated he’s wearing something different. Not too far away from their table, the boy sits on the brick wall lining the courtyard, legs crossed underneath him. Dean’s breath hitches for a second, a small noise no one else at the table heard.
The angel stares at his charge, lips parted in surprise. He looks at the wall above Dean’s head for a second before shaking his head. “I am restless. With my grace back I don’t need sleep, but the silent time while you and Sam are asleep makes me anxious.”
Gaping at the man, Castiel can’t help but smile. He had leaned forward into the priest’s space without realizing it, inhaling his every apple-tinged word. He starts to absentmindedly count freckles again. Something inside his vessel feels empty and full, like his grace is pressed thin within his skin. He wonders if he will explode or implode, goosebumps rising on his skin. Each breeze of air conditioning, each brush of his skin against his clothes, each inch of space between him and the priest make his skin tingle. He doesn’t say anything, afraid of making the moment awkward.
Dean takes the new silence as an opportunity to watch the fae work the poker table. “Capricious,” according to this stranger, meant
When Dean finally returns, it is with a dictionary in hand, a grin on his face and cock softened to half-hardness. Cas lets out an indignant whine that doesn’t seem to faze Dean at all.
He swings his feet off the bed and stands, gritting his teeth against the throbbing in his head, the pain in his chest.
A thing in which Cas is testing the validity of the phrase 'suck your brains out', Through, you know. Dean’s dick. An experiment that seems to produce excellent results because Dean can’t form a single coherent thought other than,
To its credit, it seems to be doing everything it can to look considerably less threatening than it did just a few seconds ago, what with its mouth now shut, and backed off on the mattress as far as the width of Dean’s bed allowed.
Upon closer inspection, he also notices that the lion head isn’t even the weirdest thing about early-morning-Cas.
The whole Winchester clan, who has previously been busy discussing the state of the flowers on Winchester’s side of the room, is now directing their attention to Cas as well. It makes him uncomfortable, to be the focus of their scrutiny.
Fingers brush through Dean’s hair, then lower, tracing a warm line down Dean’s spine. He smiles and sinks deeper against Cas’ chest.
Looking around, Dean notices most of the wing eyes, too, have averted their gaze bashfully, and if he didn’t know any better, he’d say the lion head was sporting a faint blush around the whiskers.
He didn’t know where he was, didn’t know where he’d been when he lost consciousness, or the fact that he lost consciousness at all.
Different as they are from how they were originally programmed, this longing for a purpose, for someone to
“Ya know, all this talk about Dean – fascinating, don’t get me wrong, but the real question is, why did healing this one girl wear ya down so much, huh.” He shaped the question like a fact, so Castiel didn’t deem it necessary to reply.
One miscalculation though – Dean’s been on hundreds of roadtrips like this with Sam’s burrito-digesting ass. So he just rolls down the window and, to Cas’ immense displeasure, endures.
In any case, the (almost) unafraid touch to that part of him that’s new to Dean, makes Cas relax quite a bit. So far, in fact, that the fur under Dean’s palm begins to vibrate.
Cas doesn’t say anything. He just keeps glaring – at the ground for a change so Dean gets a reprieve, if temporary – and that’s an awkward silence if there ever was one.
Castiel takes a deep breath, and exhales. Tries not to murder his lovely brethren again because that would be really rude as well as counterproductive to their mission. “I think if we all just work together again–”
?” No one but Balthazar has ever called him that, at least not in that same fond tone Anna's applying. He looks over to where his estranged brother is twirling a glass of wine in his hands and indulges the twinge of pain from the unresolved conflict between them. Maybe, someday, they’ll get to repair that relationship.
Dean parks Baby off to the side of the parking lot at the Roadhouse that night. He’d spent most of the day doing errands: washing laundry, vacuuming, grocery shopping. After a day of being responsible, Dean figures he deserves a fun night with a good burger and a cold drink. And maybe he’ll get lucky.
Her voice cuts off as Lucifer leads their hands to grip her throat, to squeeze the air from her, to forbid her from making their biggest fears becoming reality. Lucifer gawks at his brother’s grace, at the spectrum of colors. He shakes his head at the contact between their graces and pushes his power with Castiel’s through their hands.
“Cupid Company’s approach to the matchmaking process is not based on statistics and personality quizzes. Instead, cupids rely on their grace to glance at two potential souls. If the souls react positively towards each other, the cupid delves further, going as far as looking towards the future to be sure the two people are soulmates. This procedure takes less than a few seconds and requires no interaction between you and the other person.”
“Dean he’s….” Sam was interrupted by Charlie’s triumphant cheers from the living room. “And that’s how the war was won bitches!!!” Charlie skipped into the kitchen to start some popcorn for her movie.
“Whatever guys, just so happens I already have a plan and I’m gonna ask Cas to marry me.” Dean couldn’t even lift his eyes from the beer he was holding in his hands. His nerves made his hands shake.
“I’m just saying bro, I’ve been there to witness the heart eyes when you think he isn’t watching, which he isn’t but that doesn’t mean that Sam and I don’t see what’s happening here. I’m just looking out for you bro, I don’t want you to get your heart broken.”  Gabes hand rested on Castiels shoulder with a firm squeeze.  He found it hard to believe this was really about him and not about the infatuation his brother had with the younger Winchester.
After a quick kiss Dean relented and let go, grabbing a pillow to burrow his face into instead of Castiel.
Dean just couldn’t accept that someone like Cas could love him as strongly as he himself loved Cas. Castiel knew how much Dean always fought his feelings and was more likely to run from the raw truth instead of expressing his feelings.
“okay…” Castiel let it hang in the air clearly Dean had something planned to say, he might as well let him get it out.
“Ramiel, umm.. sir, well I wanted to talk to you about the contract extension that you offered me.” Any other time Dean was the most confident man in the room but sitting opposite his boss he couldn’t help but fidget and stutter like a prepubescent teen.
A 5 o’clock meeting meant another late night. He’d have to put off finishing the paperwork until after just to make sure he didn’t miss anything. Dean made a mental note to let Cas know that he wouldn’t be making dinner, so he should go ahead and eat without him. Which now that he thinks about it…. had been happening a lot lately. He shrugged, at least this time he was giving him notice instead of having Cas probably wait around. Cas could appreciate the heads up this time at least.
Castiel knew she was right but he just couldn’t find it within him to really care. He’d already shown what type of excuse for a husband and father he was by trying
Dean walked over and looked through his messages and missed calls, Charlie had been trying to get ahold of him for hours, there must be something up with the shop. “Hey Jess looks like Charlie is having a meltdown, I gotta get back to the shop!!” Dean yelled up the stairs so his sister-in-law would know he hadn’t disappeared. Jess came back down with a determined look on her face.
“Alright Dean I’m heading home, and you should too, that paperwork will still be here in the morning.” Dean rolled his eyes and looked up at Charlie wondering how she was still somehow bubbly at 10 pm.
“Castiel Winchester?” The nurse was standing by the doors holding a clipboard as her eyes roamed around the room looking for her next patient.
“So whats for dinner? Did my favorite sister-in-law happen to make me a pie for dessert?” Dean knew it was a long shot, no one had a clue that he was coming, Cas even looked a little shocked when he walked through the door.
Charlie didn’t know that little piece of information, she hadn’t found it odd that Cas never mentioned it because his family life seemed normal. His parents, well, adopted parents, had died of old age, and he had no siblings. Charlie decided to break a promise she’d made to Dean years ago and went back to her hacker ways, just maybe if she can find his original family maybe she can find him a match and add family love to his life.
“I cant lose him, and if he can keep something like this from me….then I’ve already started to…I…” Dean trailed off as his voice left him.
“Talk about what? Talk about how I’m a terrible husband? I drove Cas to do this, it's all my fault. Or how about I’m a terrible father? Aiden barely speaks to me. Claire isn’t old enough to really put it together but she’s starting to realize that I’m the reason Cas isn’t around. Pretty soon she’s gonna hate me too.” The self-deprecating speech was running on a loop in the back of his mind at all hours of the say since being kicked out of the hospital by his husband. Papers or not Castiel was his husband.
“If you choose to stay, you stay because you choose to. Not because of someone else’s desire or else you will only end up returning here.” A voice echoed through the endless darkness. Castiel looked up at the memories he’d lived and the moments he would miss should he not wake up. Castiel knew in his heart what the correct choice was and walked away from the montage.
“Did you forget your key again Cas?” Dean turned off the vacuum and jogged over to the door. When he snatched it open, he barely hid the look of shock on his face. “Lisa?” With a hand in the center of his chest, she pushed him back into the apartment. “What are you doing here I thought..”her lips silenced the end of that sentence.
Castiel rolled his eyes, he was not in the best of moods and thought only about how satisfying it would be to hit Dean so much that he could barely lift his arms due to exhaustion. Ignoring the cold calculating glare the therapist followed up with “and then we can let you visit in the garden with your kids.”
“Damn it!!” Castiel chucked a pillow across the room bouncing off the window. Taking stock of everything that had just happened and everything that he’d said, some of it true, some just part of the word vomit he couldn’t seem to stop. Castiel figured it would be a long time before he was allowed anywhere near his children. Forget even being allowed out to the garden. The doc would most likely label him as a hazard to be around and lock him up somewhere no one would ever see him again.
“Hey honeybee, glad to see you decide to stay with us. My names Ellen, I’ve been your nurse since they brought you in a week ago.”
Castiel almost spit his drink all over Gabe when he turned to see five of the most popular guys from his school on stage. They were all on the varsity football team and yet here they were…. singing and dancing at karaoke. Tearing Up My Heart by NSync…of all songs….
Dean walked his date to the door, only thinking of what school work he had to get done for the day. “
This doctors office was designed to put the patients at ease. Between the super comfy couches with squishy pillows, the soft lighting or the not-so-cheesy elevator music that played through the speakers, you could tell it was made for a peaceful atmosphere. A far cry from the stereotypical sterile office that Cas and Dean were expecting.
“Gabriel” Castiel put his hand on his brothers shoulder, making him jump a foot in the air. “Geeze Cassie, warn a guy before you scare the bejeezus out of him.” Knowing his little brother and his absolute loathing of the morning, Gabe didn’t expect a response, he merely reached over to the counter where a fresh cup of extra strong hot coffee was waiting for him in his mug shaped like a honey bee. Cas kept it here instead of at his own apartment for a few reasons, one, he didn’t want it to get broken when Dean and all of his rambunctious friends were watching football and he didn’t want Dean to make fun of him for it. Alphas don’t have such silly things.
Using the phone to pass messages they started talking. Yea Cas was Sams friend and they had played together but other than being the little blue-eyed boy from next door.
“What’s up bitch?” Dean had personalized every ringtone on his international phone. Mostly with his favorite songs so he could get a sliver of home whenever it rang.
No way was he going to open up for that type of rejection. If Cas told him that there was no way that they would be together, he no longer had a reason to live. They had been neighbors growing up and as soon as they presented he knew that Cas was the one for him, but he never told Castiel that. He was always singularly focused, first graduate high school, then college followed by a secure job where he could climb the ranks. As much as it hurt Dean, he’d rather be a friend along for the ride than admit his feelings and be shut out forever.
Before he knew it, Cas was engulfed in a warm, crushing hug. Dean’s body was twisted awkwardly in order to reach him, and despite the low number of hugs Cas had enjoyed in his life, it was not the most comfortable one he had ever engaged in.
Except they do, Dean thinks, as he grabs Cas’ hand to pull him out into the hallway and towards his room. Good things do happen, and Dean’s determined to hold onto them for as long as he can.
He hears Cas let out a long exhale that tells Dean exactly how hard he’s still plaguing himself with worry, before he says, “What you’re seeing is, thankfully, a mere reflection of a fraction of my True Form.“
After the first wave of emotional reunion hugs has passed, they decide to take everyone to the Bunker for the time being. It is the most sensible course of action since for one thing, all those people are legally dead until Charlie works her magic, and for the other, the Bunker might just be the one big enough place for such a large group of people.
“Benny?” Dean said, and again some secret communication seemed to go down between them because Benny took that as his cue to leave.
It seems to be Jody's complete household that greets him, Donna and the girls; plus a skinny looking guy who must be Garth, and Rowena of all people.
Minutes, or hours in – it can’t be expected of Dean to keep track at this point – the sensory overload starts to fill Dean up just as much as Cas’ cock already is. If Cas working his hole tirelessly wasn’t enough, the guy’s also got something extra to give that Dean swears makes him see Heaven As It Should Be: his grace.
Cas might appreciate their banter more if he weren’t stuck in a paralysis on the floor. Although Dean thought to tuck a soft pillow under his head, which is needless but very thoughtful of him and if it could, Cas’ heart would swell at the notion.
Winchester blinks. “Wait, seriously?” he asks, forehead wrinkled in a way that can only be described as confusion. “I was kidding, that was what a social call sounds like for you?”
“Aw, that’s just not a fair game,” Dean mumbles, complete bafflement competing with his awe at the absurdity of it all.
But it brings a smile to Dean’s face and he calls that a win in itself. “No, I know you’re not.” He bridges the gap between them again to drag the back of his hand over Cas’ cheek. “That’s kinda what I love about you.”
“Sure don't look that way,” Winchester comments, but Castiel has already removed his attention from him, trying to breathe through his nose in a way that he hopes will make the panic attack recede.
His whole body joining in on his eye-roll, Cas says, “For the last time, Dean, cursed objects have and will never be something as absurd as a human's genitals.”
Cas feels his own annoyance represented in the full-body eye roll Dean performs at that. “Can’t they deal with it alone? Kinda in the middle of somethin’ here.” And he winks at Cas in a way that recovers his hope for a shared objective which leads preferably onto a flat surface in Dean’s room.
Flexing his hand to assure himself of the presence of his angel blade against his Grace, Cas prepares himself for this hunt, when Dean's hand on his chest stops him in his tracks.
“Cas, you have giant wings with terrifying eyes on them, and a second head in the shape of a predator. What hunter doesn’t dream of baggin’
“See, that’s the thing,” Dean begins as he shoves the phone unceremoniously back into his pocket. And then he surges forward in a movement not even Cas could’ve predicted and his hands lock on either side of Cas’ shoulders, effectively trapping him.
But Cas just turns a cool look on him. “With both my hands on the wheel, I wouldn’t be able to eat this,” he points out like the evil genius he is.
“So,” starts Claire, once they've all assembled in varying positions around the tables. “You and Cas hooked up, huh.” And then Claire punches Dean on the arm, hard.
The trauma she must have endured, it was all gone. Castiel swallowed it all into the black hole in his stomach, in his chest, until it swallowed him whole.
“I don’t hate you,” Castiel said, almost as if pondering to himself. “I owe you. You kept Dean safe when I –,“ His breathing stopped short. After all this time the guilt still felt like a punch to the gut. “You kept Dean safe,” He continued. “And I trust you to do it again. So this responsibility you feel for him – I’m glad for it. But dragging Dean into my business is not the way to care for his well-being.”
is Dean’s life now for the nearest future. All that exists is Cas' cock pistoning in and out of him.
“Dean, it really is just a scratch,” says Cas. “A regular gun shot can't kill me, see? It's already healing.”
His fingers loosen their tight grip on the bedsheets and Cas’ upper arm respectively, and he opens his eyes to find the angel inches from his face, brushing sweaty strands of hair from Dean’s forehead.
“Look, man,” Benny said. “I just thought Dean’d like to know why you passed out on a hospital floor, creeping over some girl in the psych ward. Least I could do. No matter how low a’ me you think.”
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Sam stands with his arms crossed over his chest, looking down to his brother like the very picture of disapproval, signalling to him that
that Dean’s been teasing him about. Castiel still doesn’t believe in its existence, but stranger things have happened.
He can’t move anything but his eyes in their sockets and this immobility is so terrifying, it immediately goes on the list of his most traumatizing phobias.
And suddenly something clicks in Dean’s head, and it all starts to make sense. Because the summation of Cas + madness isn’t so far off from the equation of Cas = safety, and really, Dean shouldn’t have expected his first night with his angel boyfriend to be any less crazy.
His phone has forsaken him the three times before when he tried to connect to the head office, and this time is no different. Castiel grumbles under his breath and pulls the useless phone off his ear.
Castiel rolls his eyes, but that can’t stop his cheeks from heating up and unfortunately, it’s not something Gabriel misses. His eyes go wide and he waves a finger in Cas’ direction almost like in accusation. “Oh oh no! Tell me you didn’t! Did our dear little Cassie finally get his cherry popped by our good ol’ reliable righteous man?”
her. I told you.” Benny made it sound like he was being indecent, and the mere thought appalled Cas.
to get you in the mood again, then, I wager.” And with that he winks, and moves down Cas chest and...
The plan where the laptop dies a tragic, unexpected death foiled, Dean narrows his eyes at him. “The thing’s not coming,” he repeats with finality.
That seems to pull Cas out of his pleading spell. Remembering to feign indifference, he huffs, and rolls off of Dean, folding his arms in front of his chest. “Noooo!” He drawls.
the lion head, plus a dozen of wing-eyes, naturally – and there’s such a hopeful glimmer in his eyes (yes, all of them) that Dean’s heart aches for him. Only logical that he reach out with a comforting touch to Cas’ shoulder in order to quell that ache.
the true Bad this world could offer, knew it by heart, by his own bloodstained hands. Because that was where it belonged.
Sam widens his eyes comically, a deliberately worn facial expression of Sam’s that aims at showing his judgmental disbelief, as Cas has come to realize after all the years of spending time with him and the corresponding attempts at categorizing his moods.
His hand clenches tightly on the steering wheel as he grits out, “Yes.” Doubting his driving skills and sense of direction is the fastest way to drive him up the wall, and Cas knows it.
Claire throws her hands up. “Hey, what are we, chopped liver?” And she gestures to herself and the other two young women in her company that Cas doesn't yet know very well.
“If I get a cold, I’ll fucking send you the bill,” he says, as Castiel makes his way back to his bed.
Castiel’s fingers reach for it as though pulled by a string, and indeed, the intriguing smell of freshly acquired, sinfully unhealthy burgers hits his nose. Closing his eyes, he cherishes the way it fills a deep longing inside him.
With angels like Gabriel in their midst, however, it doesn’t stay calm for too long. Soon enough, 80s music is blasting from some unidentifiable source and the few of the more boisterous among their ragtag garrison are dancing over the ashes of their vanquished enemies.
But Dean shakes his head firmly. “Fat chance! You're not going in your condition, it's way too dangerous.”
Castiel nods his understanding and bumps his fist against Ash’s. The awkward moment over, Ash waves at Dean and starts to back away. “Love to stay n chat, amigos, but duty calls.”
Dean’s hand freezes and his eyes focus on Castiel’s. He searches the blue for a hint of doubt, a hint of mockery. He finds nothing. Grinning, he laughs, “I think I can fit you in, yeah.”
Sighs of relief litter the air as the men start to reshuffle their cards. Bobby rolls his eyes, a gesture only Dean sees but is sure Ellen could sense as she crosses the small distance to them. She pats Bobby on the shoulder, ducking underneath his hat to kiss his bearded cheek. “Oh, don’t worry, Bobby. I’m usin the winnin’s to pay for the liquor.”
Nestled deep in the western heat wave, just south down the muddy river, lies Ouroboros. There, the water trickles into something sweeter than stars and honey and the grass pulls your feet into the earth. Folks around those parts all know the stories. Ouroboros is a town of bones. Those who live there are all tied by soul and blood to the dirt. Try to leave and it yanks you back with a whip. Fae hunters, non-believers, eager priests, runaways, poor men—they all tumble through on the whirlwinds of a dusty afternoon. None ever stay—spit out by the snake and scared by the rattle. The ones with real grit never shake the town’s poison.
Castiel’s cheeks flush, but he smirks as he stares at Dean. His grace tingles, body aching to touch more of Dean, to never let him go again. “I believe so, yes.”
vibrates with the thrum of an engine. The smell of leather winds it’s way through his grace as the pounding of wind fill his ears. Like flint against steel, the connection sparks a never ending series of memories neither Cas or Dean has lived yet. Images of them kissing, holding hands, watching movies, walking with Ben, cooking together, sleeping together, rain down on Castiel’s grace like a waterfall.
“All of our clients have either known or lived near their soulmates. Humans are just so preoccupied with other things that they miss what is right in front of them. Trust me, you’ll find Dean’s soulmate.”
When there’s a soft knock on his door, Dean lets out a relieved sigh. He yanks the door open to reveal Castiel, wearing the same pink uniform and tan trench coat. Dean laughs, some tension leaking out of him.
“You guys do spend a lot of time together, don’t ya. You’re putting a lot of time into this case.” Gabriel turns to put his cake in the oven and start the timer, ears focused on Castiel’s tone.
Castiel nods, still holding Dean’s coffee as the businessman leads them towards the building’s entrance. “I have known Balthazar since I was a fledgling. He’s been a close friend of my brother, Gabriel, and I for years.”
Another, less logical part of Dean’s brain wants to believe the angel will stay despite Dean’s dumb actions. That would mean Cas continues searching for Dean’s soulmate. The thought makes Dean shift uncomfortably in his seat. He doesn’t want some stranger, someone that Castiel thinks may be suitable for him. He wants Cas. But finding his soulmate will help him forget the angel who made him rethink everything he thought he wanted in a partner.
Castiel nods along until he hears the word “uniform”. He swallows, rubbing his hands on his dress slacks.
In the soft after silence of a productive phone call, Dean Winchester sits back in his office chair. He swivels it around, arms behind his head as he smiles at the view of downtown. Car lights blink off the asphalt and glass windows, sparkling in Dean’s eyes. It’s 4:30 in the afternoon, meaning rush hour traffic gives him an excuse to remain in his office until 6. Zachariah would be pleased to see that he’s logging more hours anyway. Dean can imagine the man’s bird like face pinched forward in that sleazy smile as he slides a white slip of paper across his desk. Dean’s so close to this promotion he can taste it. He sighs, turning back to his desk to begin sorting through his emails.
Castiel settles in the passenger seat and nods. Dean puts the car into reverse, quickly pulling out of the parking garage and heading to the closest diner. Castiel watches the human drive for a couple seconds before answering. “I understand. Finding your true partner is a stress inducing journey, but that’s what I am here for. You are my charge until your request is satisfied, and I do not intend on disappointing you. You deserve this.”
Castiel nods, tilting his head at the nickname. He says nothing of it, but still grins about it. “Yes?”
In the dining room, Dean joins Sam in setting the table. They set plates down over the nice table cloth Ellen pulled from the attic. Dean runs his fingertips over the fabric, smiling at the softness he remembers from every holiday here. Forks, knives and spoons clink in Sam’s hands as he goes around the table, long hair swinging in front of his face.
When the fae smiles this time, it exposes his teeth. The canines look sharper, hinting at the power lurking under the façade. Dean’s mouth goes dry, and he offers a small smile of his own.
“I know that you are sorry, Dean. And I want you to understand that I reacted that way due to my own fear. Not from disgust.”
Throwing on some flannel sweatpants, he avoids sitting back in his bed. Instead, he goes into the kitchen for coffee, glad he set up the automatic timer the day before. The dark liquid does it’s work to revive his brain cells and he goes to work in his office.
Castiel’s eyebrows unfurrow and his wings rise in confidence. This is his job, what Gabriel and Balthazar and His Father trained him to do. To help humans, to answer their prayers. “Yes, of course. Should we sit?”
“Even if Castiel doesn’t find you someone,” Sam says, voice quiet. “I hope you realize you still have him.”
The human stands beside the couch, staring at the words scrolling past. He doesn’t read them, his mind too occupied by the angel he can still see in his peripheral. He clears his throat when the end of the credits make the screen go black. He puts the bag on the couch next to Castiel. “I put your clothes in a bag.”
Castiel moans Dean’s name to show his agreement, thrusting again when Dean keeps petting his wing. His movements become erratic the more Dean touches him, grace throbbing through all his nerve endings. Dean’s own whines of pleasure at the friction on his dick encourage Cas to keep moving against his charge. Not just his charge, his soulmate.
“Those are to pair you with an appropriate cupid and for said cupid to learn some basic knowledge of their charge. By knowing your answers, Dean, I know where to start with my search.”
Dean bounces on his toes for a second. “Great, I’ll message you on Facebook tonight. Talk to you later.”
“Everything alright?” Castiel asks, eyes searching Dean’s face for more signs of distress. Dean shakes his head, rubbing the back of his neck.
Dean puts the plate on the the table top of the high chair, using a soft sided spoon to scoop up some of the cherry preserves. He wiggles his eyebrows at Creedance, taking the first taste of his homemade pie. “Mmm, s good. I dunno if you’ll like it.”
Nodding along with the explanation, Dean carts his hand through the feathers close to Castiel’s left shoulder blade. The angel moans, a full sound like a cork popping loose from a wine bottle. Dean swallows as Castiel presses into his hand. “They’re amazin.”
There’s some low grumbling and stomping to be heard, the couple talking in more hushed tones in the other room. Jo still stares openly at Castiel, so he looks back at her. He isn’t sure what to do with himself now and suppresses the urge to wrap his wings around himself so no one can see him.
Dean furrows his eyebrows, realizing that Castiel just admitted that his employers are his brother and best friend. It doesn’t seem strange to Dean, having worked for both Bobby and Ellen growing up. Pays the bills. But it does surprise him that Castiel has a friend who seems more socially ept. He absently grabs the door into the building, holding it open for the angel. Castiel stops at the threshold and looks at Dean. He holds out the coffee for the man to take.
His brother rolls his eyes at that, lips upturned like he plans on saying something sarcastic. That’s when his shoulder’s tense.
When Castiel’s palms brush over Dean’s nipples, the human arches up onto his toes and gasps. Castiel smiles against Dean’s skin, purposefully dragging his thumbs over them again. Dean bites his lip to keep from moaning. He yanks at Castiel’s hair, pulling the angel back for a bruising kiss. Dean’s thankful for the wall behind him, his legs shaking as Cas rubs his chest.
“No,” Dean mumbles, clearing his throat when his voice comes out weak. “The color actually looks good. It's just that it suggests something softer, but you're…”
“I gotta take Ben back to Lisa’s before Monday,” Dean blurts, heart jumping when he realizes he probably sounded too eager to see the cupid again. “The kid’s on break, but they’re gonna go to his grandmother’s house this year. I get Thursday and Friday off. Friday, we can go out and see if ya find anybody.”
Gabriel nods enthusiastically, going up to Castiel and putting his hands on his brother’s shoulders. Gabriel’s bright eyes make Castiel’s wings pull closer to his back with worry and he raises an eyebrow in question.
Castiel’s secondary flight feathers shiver when Dean tells him he can keep the clothes for now. Every time he moved, Cas could smell Dean on the fabric. It still catches him off guard, making his grace swirl into a tight coil inside his chest. He stares at his charge for a second, some his earlier anxiety weighing on his wings. “I’m going to assume you do not wish to continue our search while your son is present, so I can resume my duties when you next see fit.”
Sitting across from the angel, Dean taps the table with his knuckles. “Before you give me the whole spiel about professionalism and what not, I just want to say I am sorry. I explained the situation to Gabriel so you don’t get in trouble. And I understand if you don’t want to be my cupid anymore, I crossed a line.”
Sam nods along with Jo’s words, just as curious. Dean had never mentioned having friends outside of work, and certainly never said anything about angels.  Dean sighs, rubbing the back of his neck.
Dean whistles, then grins. He takes Castiel’s hand and squeezes it. With a blink, Castiel restores the power of the neighborhood, everything within Dean’s apartment back to normal. The human shakes his head, patting Castiel’s shoulder as he walks past to his bedroom. “You’re somethin else, Cas.”
Breathing deep through his nose, Dean takes another couple swigs of his drink. Castiel scans Dean’s profile, still amazed at the beauty of his charge.
Castiel’s eyes open, his gaze focusing on Dean’s amused expression. The angel’s wings pull closer to his body, an action Dean figures is similar to an embarrassed blush. He lifts the burger up slightly to bring Dean’s attention to it. “This makes me very happy.”
“Cas?” he whispers, afraid that if he blinks the cupid will disappear and take this feeling with him.
Relief floods through Dean, drowns his nerves, unleashes his tension. His muscles buzz and he fist pumps the air. He sighs loudly, standing and shaking out his feet. Castiel watches him, laughing silently to himself. Dean looks down at him, a giant grin on his face.
With a new found silence between them, Castiel passes the time watching Dean again. The human twists a ring on his right hand, the silver band shimmering under the restaurant's lights. Dean’s eyes are unfocused, staring at the space past Castiel’s shoulder. His hair starts to fall out of the careful part, drooping slightly over Dean’s forehead. Castiel surprises himself when his fingers twitch with an urge to fix Dean’s hair. He clasps his hands together to hold himself back, eyebrows furrowed as he tries to understand the urge.
For the past couple months, he’d attempted to feed the baby with no success. She’d spit out her food, pick it up in her tiny fists, fling it out onto the kitchen floor. Dean always ended up giving up halfway through, handing the jars of baby food to Cas. The former angel could coax Creedance to actually eat rather than finger paint with the mushy foods. Whenever he watched, a metallic taste settled in his mouth. Dean had always wanted this, a home and a child and someone who loves him. But he still has nightmares. Demons will come. Or vampires. Or werewolves. Or shifters. Or himself. He’ll drop her or accidentally drown her. He’d somehow hurt the kid.
Jo walks around the table and puts a hand on Dean’s cheek. At first, she doesn’t say a word, only offers him a small smile. Then she finally whispers, “I’m glad you wanna find someone, Dean.”
Cas kisses Dean, swallowing the words. He wants to etch them into his grace, wear the words like a badge in front all of Heaven. He isn’t nothing. He’s Dean’s angel.
“Cassie…” the angel mumbles, chin resting against his chest. Dean huffs a laugh, shaking his head a little.
Instead, the corners of the cupid’s mouth quirk up and his wings pull back from their dominant stance. “I suppose the pink is misleading, although it suits my profession.”
The next day, he comes home from his work out and kicks another dark garment across the hardwood floor. Covered in sweat, muscles aching, and a much needed shower on his mind, Castiel leaves it, though curious. After cleaning himself, he wraps a towel around his waist and goes to the fridge to get a cold bottle of water.
With a huff, Castiel pulls off his trenchcoat. He folds it over his arm and places it on the end of Dean’s bed. “What do you want me to wear?”
Castiel stares at the priest, blinking multiple times as Dean continues to laugh. He waits for the priest to stop laughing, to tell him that’s not possible, to go into shock. After a couple more minutes of Dean chuckling to himself, Castiel realizes that Dean’s not going to do that. The priest believes him, had seen and felt his grace for himself.
Castiel’s head snaps up, and he unleashes the most genuine, adoring grin on Dean. His eyes shimmer, dimples shaping the smile. Dean’s heart skips a beat, his hands sweat, his stomach flips. Without thinking, Dean winks, which makes Castiel laugh. Peals of baritone laughter follow Dean down the hallway.
Cas tries to open his mouth to interject, to present one of the many arguments he’d created in his mind over the weekend. Holding up a single finger, Gabriel cuts his brother short. “No, listen, Castiel. You should check the bond. Angel grace is similar to the human soul, it’s possible.”
The solid knock on his front door makes Dean’s face break into a grin. He jolts off his spot on the couch to open the door. Castiel stands on the other side of the threshold, a dark green bottle in hand with his tan trench coat folded over his arm. Dean raises an eyebrow at the bottle, glancing between the object and the angel’s eyes.
He swipes the app open, bouncing on his feet as he holds the phone to his ear. “Hey, Lis, go on and bring him up.”
After a minute of unwavering staring, Dean looks out at the rest of the bar. “Ya know, Cas, flattery will get you everywhere.”
Dean stands awkwardly in the courtyard, navigating the tables and faces around him. His entire body quivers, muscles twitching as he walks around. When he sits on the brick wall, feet dangling over the edge, they still shake. He clutches his lunch in tight hands to hide the fact they’re wobbly as he continues to look for Castiel.
The feathers on the top of Castiel’s wings arch, the black color rippling. Dean watches the irritated movement for a couples seconds, eyebrows raised. He puts Baby into reverse, leading her out of the parking lot. He tries to hide the pleased smirk on his face.
Angel and priest stare at each other, a silent exchange of empathy and understanding making the air thick. Castiel leans forward, skin tingling the closer he gets to the man. “I do not wish to offend you, but you are unlike any priest I have ever met.”
Cas doesn’t hold her hand for long, shaking it once before stepping back. He then kneels in front of Ben so they’re close to the same height. He offers his hand as he did with Lisa. “Pleasure to finally meet you, Ben. Your father speaks highly of you.”
They arrive at the Roadhouse too quickly for Castiel’s liking. He wishes to stay in the car, feeling the wind push around him without actually moving his body. His cheeks are flushed, carefully parted hair fluffed out by the wind. Both men exit the car, the buzz of the drive echoing in their limbs. Dean huffs a laugh when he takes in the cupid’s appearance.
The rest of the journey to Dean’s office is short, but Castiel looks into two more potential mates. One being a different secretary, a redhead who makes fun of Dean’s suit as he passes. That bond didn’t taste like sour apple juice, but only showed friendship. When Castiel spotted a future moment where the woman is with another woman, Castiel smiled. The other was a gruff looking man Dean addresses as Benny. The man looked at Dean appreciatively and the brief touch on Dean’s shoulder made Castiel curious. But that bond ends after a couple years and the two go back to being friends.
Castiel quickly decides that watching Dean cook is one of the more fascinating things he’d ever witnessed. The human moves confidently in the kitchen. He’d changed into a pair of jeans and a black and red flannel, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Each cut, each smooth motion of his hands and wrists, makes the muscles flex under his skin. Castiel’s eyes focus on that for a while, amazed at the connection between Dean’s wrist and his individual fingers as they clutch the kitchen knives and spatula.
Castiel’s eyes widen at the description of his physical appearance. Human’s use of adjectives always befuddled Castiel. Gabriel and Balthazar consistently teased him, telling him he’s always been a  “baby in a trench coat” or that sometimes his eyes “bored into people’s souls.” Dean chews on his bottom lip as he waits for Castiel to respond. He expects the cupid to disappear, or tell Dean fuck you  in that gravelly voice.
The Roadhouse is a small bar. Laminate tables glimmer under the worn out light bulbs. Neon signs glow on the walls, giving the bottles on the liquor shelf flashing smiles. Castiel’s nose wrinkles at the smell of grease, his vessel unsure about how to react to food. Not many people loiter about, it being early on a Sunday. Dean makes his way around the tables towards the bar where a young woman with a strong gaze and a young man with a mullet stand talking. Castiel follows close behind, his grace reaching out to get a sense of the souls around them.
Castiel hums softly as he carries the baby to her crib, hand patting her back gently. Dean watches them go with a grin. He decides a slice of pie for himself would be a good reward for finding something Cece actually enjoys. Cutting himself a piece, he uses the same plate with a larger fork. His eyes close as he savors the sweet burst of cherries mixing with the butter glazed crust. Everything melts inside his mouth and he can’t help the satisfied moan that escapes his lips.
Castiel takes Dean’s other hand, eyes hooded as his wing leans into Dean’s gentle tracing of his feather pattern. “Very.”
Castiel does that small frown again, and this time Dean catches it. The human adds it to his growing list of expressions as the cupid.
Castiel licks his lips, wings shifting their weight unconsciously. “My grace hasn’t fully regenerated. It takes time to restore, especially since I’m away from Heaven. It makes it easy to contain their visage.”
As he speaks, Castiel keeps his hands folded on top of the table. The cupid’s voice is even, a comfort to Dean. The angel notices that Dean shifts a little in his own seat, often glancing around them as he takes in the new information. Dean takes another swig of his beer, nodding along.
Castiel’s words have a serious and concerned tone, but the angel also uses air quotes to accent his point. The gesture makes Dean smile. Castiel’s grace swirls happily in his body when Dean relaxes.
Dean strokes under Castiel’s eye, watching it waiver. The hunter’s prepared for rejection despite what he heard earlier. Just because Castiel wants him in the heat of the moment doesn’t mean he’ll say yes; doesn’t mean they’ll be able to make this work. The fear of blowing down the house of cards forces them all to hold their breath. They may suffocate, but at least things still feel solid.
Leaning back, Castiel blinks. “No, not at all. It’s quite refreshing actually. Some priests seem removed from the people they serve. Like they think their title separates them from all of humanity.”
The connection breaks with a snap as Castiel stands abruptly. His chair falls back against the floor with a loud crack. Dean quickly stands and moves closer to Castiel. He puts his hands on Castiel’s shoulders even as the angel’s wings stretch outward. The feathers rustle, light still shining from the cupid.
Castiel turns and looks up at Dean, holding his free hand over his eyes to see him better. “Hello, Dean.”
Castiel takes a deep breath, wings still puffed. He watches the streets and cars and buildings pass by them as he tries to reword his concerns. Soon, Dean is pulling into the parking garage and Castiel finally speaks. “Why does my wearing a certain color amuse you? Does the shade clash with my complexion?”
