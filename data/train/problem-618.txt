John grumbled something about it not being any of Sherlock’s business and that he was going to his room.
A few days after the shirtless fiasco, John realised that he might have to introduce Harry to Sherlock. (Or else Mr Dramatic would be extremely huffy that he didn’t meet her) He wasn’t too worried about Harry meeting Sherlock, in fact, he was much more concerned about how Sherlock would be affected. After all, visits from Harry always end up a bit... disastrous.
When they pulled apart, they seemed to be in a perfect little bubble. Just the two of them, in a noisy bustling Italian restaurant. Perfect, happy and beautiful.
“What?”
Sherlock couldn’t fight the oncoming blushes that came with each message if he tried. It was all too lovely, too endearing. He wanted to find out who it was. But he knew that if he found out, he would ruin it. The notes would stop.
“About time, Watson! You’ve been writing to him forever!” Lestrade yelled, winking exaggeratedly.
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he immediately fumbled to “unlike” the photo. Clicking hastily, the red heart on the screen disappeared. Unfortunately for Sherlock, John would have already received the notification. Groaning loudly at his mistake, Sherlock cradled his head in his hands as he contemplated what to do next.
Either way, Sherlock was embarrassed. So embarrassed, that he was about to call Mycroft to ask him if it were possible allow Sherlock to reside in one of his dwellings in Paris.
Fuck it, let’s go.
“Jesus...I...Gregory...please...” Mycroft groaned, thrusting into Greg’s hands. A wet patch form by his precome was already forming, not that Mycroft cared. All he wanted was Greg, just more and more of Greg.
John placed his hand on Sherlock’s neck, effectively silencing Sherlock. He felt a blush creeping up his neck as he effectively stroked Sherlock’s neck to check his temperature.
“FOR GOODNESS SAKES, SHERLOCK, ASK HIM SOMETHING. YOU DON’T LOOK VERY NORMAL.” Mycroft yelled, the tension getting on his nerves as he glared at the screen.
“SHUT UP BOTH OF YOU AND JUST SNOG”
Option b) He could steal John’s phone and delete John’s Instagram account.
“You are married.”
You have the sweetest lips. I wonder... how it would feel if I kissed them.
As soon as they were in the kitchen, Harry’s eyes lit up and a flood of questions escaped her lips. “He’s so hot. Are you dating? You can’t tell me you guy are not dating. Have you seen that shirt? His eyes? His cheekbones? Oh my god the cheekbones-“
“Oh fuck yes.”
“Er...no. It wasn’t.” John whispered, relishing the hot air that came with Sherlock’s quiet breaths. The Detective smelled like toast and tea, two very welcoming scents that made John want to just lean into his shirt and breath it all in.
John walked carefully to Sherlock’s room, balancing a food tray laden with tea, biscuits, medicine, a cold towel and some science magazines for Sherlock to indulge in. He also brought his romance novel along, seeing that he might have to watch over Sherlock for a while.
“Just bring him over before your date and you can go.” John sighed as he stared at Rosie. She really did look like him, precious thing.
Sherlock paused.
Sherlock winced and made eye contact with Asher, “So, Asher. What are your intentions with my Daughter and will your anatomy come between your relationship if taken further?”
“You don’t know that, John. Also when are you going to tell me that you are going to visit your Sister? Why can’t I meet her? Is it because we are both addicts? Does that make you uncomfortable?”
“I will get a candle, it’s more romantic...” Angelo announced before scuttling off to find a pretty little candle. This time, John didn’t say anything, he just smiled and let his eyes wander over to Sherlock.
But meanwhile, he had to deal with a crying baby. John scrunched his nose at the stench from Rosie’s diaper.
The statement had no bite to it, no vicious intent to wound Sherlock mental state. Yet John sprung to Sherlock’s side immediately, poised to defend Sherlock.
John looked on at Sherlock in disbelief. Was Sherlock being...nice? But...he was Sherlock, he didn’t do “nice”. John frowned and just shrugged, at least Sherlock was on his best behaviour and it would make this exchange go smoothly.
Sherlock let out a high pitched whimper and grumbled sleepily as John withdrew his hand, “But... I want... “
Greg smiled as he surveyed Mycroft. He was lying on the couch with his legs spread wide open like an invitation to fuck him, his little pink hole clenching at the mere thought of being filled. So pretty, so vulnerable and sensitive, so goddam perfect.
Do you want to meet the model? ;)
And that was only the beginning. With the roaring lust Sherlock had harbored inside of him, he kissed John in a way no man had ever kissed him, slow and sensual. Sherlock slid his tongue inside John’s mouth, tracing the sides of John’s tongue. Sherlock slid his hand up along John’s side to his cheek to deepen the kiss.
John laughed as he unconsciously felt the rings in his pocket, “Why don’t you go ahead and put the groceries in the food fridge and I’ll go clean her up.” (I’m going to just interject as the writer that Sherlock and John now have two fridges, for food and experiments because I can imagine them agreeing to this.)
John was, quite frankly, about to scream. Hearing Greg mutter the words, “Why the heck is he so near her...” didn’t make it any better. He could almost foresee this... tattooed, evil boy influence his little angel’s future by breaking her fragile little heart.
John cracked a faint smile as he reached out toward Sherlock to brush his hair out of his face. His lips were a little swollen and he could see a slight puffiness of Sherlock’s lips too.
“Asher, do take a seat.” Sherlock gave him his ‘new people’ smile, effectively looking like one of those killer clowns.
Mycroft was not in the best mood. The higher ups in his place of work had recommended that he should have a break. Upon finding out that it was because China’s secret service refused to work with a homosexual, Mycroft was, quite understandably, upset and did not  take the news very well.
Just a few more rough, deep thrusts and dizzying jabs to his sensitive prostate and Mycroft squeezes his eyes shut and spasms as his orgasm explodes out of him, untouched.
They separated, eyes heavily clouded with lust. Greg smirked as he looked down at their matching hard ons before saying, “Now, don’t you want to know why the higher ups can just go fuck themselves?”
Sherlock, you are the most precious thing.
John gulped as Sherlock smiled (genuinely?!) at Harry, messing up his curly locks. “Hello, Miss. I’m Sherlock Holmes, John’s flatmate.”
“Mycroft, shut up! I’m trying to interview a kid here!” Sherlock groaned aloud, making Rosie flush with embarrassment and rage.
“Her and her? A romance novel? Well, I wouldn’t put it past you John, since you’re such a romantic. But aren’t you ‘not gay’?” Sherlock tried to suppress a giggle and failed miserably.
Apparently Sherlock agreed.
And when they get bored of leading him on, they’ll break him with their laughs and jeers. Well, not today, idiots.
“Angelo!”
“Sherlock, you have to take the medicine.” John chided, setting the tray down on the bedside table. He drew up and chair and sat next to Sherlock’s bed, immediately setting up. He arranged the pills in his hand, balancing it so that he could carry a glass a water at the same time. In his other hand, he grabbed a cold towel, poised to slap down on Sherlock’s forehead.
Mycroft stayed silent, eyes hooded with anticipation as Lestrade hitched himself higher on his lap to grind their erections together. Mycroft moaned, definitely unashamed as he whined and bucked his hips forward for more friction. His crotch felt like it was on fire and he needed more.
“Urm...no, not really. You can read it though...” Mycroft’s voice trailed off for the first time in his life. He ducked his head down as he felt Greg shift his head to get a proper peek at the paper.
If he tried to confront the writer, or catch him. He might not like Sherlock. He would probably be all happy about it at first but will change his mind about Sherlock once he got close to him. And he’ll leave and never come back and break Sherlock’s heart.
John’s chest felt so full that he felt that if he inhaled, he might burst. “Really?”
“Classified...” Mycroft sighed, bringing his free hand up towards him to massage his temples. “The long and short of it being that I am temporarily suspended from work due to...my sexuality.”
John huffed in mock anger as he motioned to get closer. “I’m going to check if you’re warm and if you are, you are not going out. Honestly, why do I have to take care of you? You are such a child.”
“Dammit Sherlock!” John groaned, interrupting Sherlock’s adorable rambling about gene splicing, “You’re preventing your own proposal!”
The star of the show, however, was Sherlock’s pale, scarred torso, which was on full display underneath the coat. The rainwater gave it a pearly sheen and the faint lines of lean muscle could be seen. His waistline was incredibly small, and Sherlock’s taut belly showed signs of abdominal muscle.
“Alright, I’m coming down!” Sherlock yelled back in response, finishing his violin session with a series of high pitched notes. He scrambled towards the door, adjusting the collar of his purple silk shirt as he did so.
However, since humans needed to do this terribly inconvenient thing called breathing, they had to pull apart. Neither pointed out the very suggestive trail of saliva that was joining them together.
They pulled away, lips swollen and red. A trail of saliva links the both of their lips as they part. Their eyes are both unbelievably clouded with lust and longing. Sherlock is the first the break the deafening silence.
All just cause he caught a stalker.
Which leads us to the now, 10 minutes before Harry was coming over to the flat. John had already yelled for Sherlock to come and wait in the living room like a civil person but he was somewhere in his room, screeching on the violin in private. The poor man must be stressed, since John hadn’t heard such terrible sounds since Irene Adler.
Watson turned towards his Detective and grinned back, teeth and all. “You are, without doubt, an insufferable git.” He announced, before bursting into laughter.
“Woah, Charlie. Calm down.” John firmly stated, gripping onto the boy’s arm a little too hard.
Sherlock was as stiff as a board, his entire face tensed considerably when John’s lips touched his. In just a split second, Sherlock had melted. His mouth moved slowly against John’s, not knowing quite what he was doing, but wanting it so badly.
For Sherlock.
“Ding dong!” The bell rang throughout the apartment, prompting John to pull open the door with rehearsed movements. The smile on his face was so artificial that it physically pained Sherlock to look at him.
My clever baby boy.
After a quick call to Angelo and a scuffle for the bill (Sherlock won) and the pair were walking merrily back to 221b Baker Street, giggling and holding hands like a pair of blushing teenagers on their first date.
“I don’t need those...I just need you.” Greg grinned as he reached over to clasp Mycroft’s hand in his. Mycroft’s cheeks turned a gentle pink as he rubbed little circles in Greg’s palm.
Number one, realising that he was gay was freeing to John. It was like a cage had been lifted from his body and left him a free spirit. He felt really good about himself, more confident, no longer wanting to feel too insecure about who he was. Jesus, the first thing he did was to call Harry. (And of course that went... “well”)
“He’s excellent, of course but...he’s informed me that we have no less than seven moles in Scotland Yard.” Greg sighed, biting his lip, “He won’t tell me who. Just told me that it’s unfortunately not Anderson or Donavan.”
Those plans for promised fun times, however, were unable to be carried out due to something unexpected coming up on Greg’s end. Poor Mycroft arrived to a silent house, no roaring fire or a sexy half dressed Greg. Just a pathetic note on the table accompanied with a cup of very cold tea.
9. The sex. (No elaboration)
So it was quite understandable that he didn’t see John Watson, a well liked member of the rugby team, fresh out of the changing rooms from a rowdy game of rugby. The two collided head on and Sherlock, being ever so dramatic, had made a spectacle of himself falling onto the floor.
Harry stared into John’s eyes in mock seriousness and pointed an accusing finger at his face. “What more do you want? He’s hot, he’s smart and he’s availableeeee. God, if I wasn’t married I would turn straight for him alone.”
Sherlock’s eyes drifted shut as John pulled him closer to capture his lips in his own. A little sound escaped from his mouth as John twined his fingers into his curly locks. Everything was so warm and so good and Sherlock didn’t know if he could stop. He felt shaky, like a tiny lamb, yet the comforting feel of John’s hand on his jaw kept him grounded.
I find it perfectly nice. It’s an acceptable picture and the angle in particularly flattering. -SH
“Harry, I just wanted to call because I figured something out!” John whispered as if he was conspiring with an enemy. (Sherlock was in the other room, having woken up to update his boring blog)
You don’t look terrible. To be honest, you’re quite a good looking bloke. -SH
“I think...you’ve Long outstayed your welcome, Miss Watson.” Sherlock gritted through his teeth, lowering his hand to his side.
“What would be this thing that I am doing?”
“What did my Brother do this time?” Mycroft hummed, tapping the other side of the desk to tell Greg to sit.
When John told Sherlock to dress well, he didn’t expect him to pull out his purple shirt. The sexy, fitted purple shirt that accentuated all the good things about Sherlock’s body. To make matters worse, Sherlock had paired the shirt with a lovely black pants that was tight... in all the right places.
Even on the earphones, both Sherlock and John heard Greg let out a disapproving gasp. It was quickly followed by a ‘shut it sweetheart, I need to see this’ by Mycroft.
“Oh, well that’s very nice!” John grinned, fingers accidentally brushing Sherlock’s as he talked.
(Meanwhile, Harry’s just having the time of her life, teasing the great Sherlock Holmes into saying that he wouldn’t mind stripping. She’s not even drunk, mind you, but she bet that she  could goad Sherlock into stripping if she were drunk.)
So he bowed his head and worshipped in the only way he knew how.
“Like this?” His voice is a deeper husk now.
“My teacher was an idiot.”
“I plan on having
“Oh, John,” Sherlock sighed. He stretched out luxuriously, body rolling and shifting, and clenched around the fat tip.
Set the tips of his fangs against the tender flesh.
John jiggles the key in his lock, cursing it under his breath. The flat is small but surprisingly clear of clutter, and there's been a valiant effort to cover a faint musty odor with a vanilla air freshener. Sherlock doesn't have the opportunity to observe much more, as he is dragged by the wrist down a short hallway.
John's hand dropped from Sherlock's arm, to his side, to his hip, and Sherlock's breath caught—ragged and whimpering—as John's fingers slid over the flies of his trousers, curving along the contour of Sherlock's cock.
“A little over a year.” John said on an exhale. “I'm on a fifty-six day interval, so this is only my seventh job.”
“A vague sound of interest.”
Alone in the foyer, brain having finally resurfaced, Sherlock had looked back at the bulletin and pulled a tab off the freshly tacked flyer for one John Watson, chemistry tutor.
“That's lovely, John,” I say instead. “Why don’t you give us a wag.”
John slid his mouth back down, following the thin seam leading to Sherlock’s sac. “God,” he sighed into the skin. “This is lovely.”
He slips off his seat and does his best to adjust his shorts, but there’s no way he can hide the plump line of his cock distending the fabric. His gait is slower than normal, his legs slightly wider to accommodate his thickness. Each step jostles him, causes the bulge in his shorts to bounce and sway. It’s absolutely mouthwatering.
“Should I move it?”
He tries to glower at me, but the blush across his cheeks rather ruins the effect. I smile back, a flirtatious quirk of my lips, and lift my double soy latte in recognition of his displeasure.
“Ready?”
Sherlock feels something unfurl in his chest—a knot of tension he hadn't even known he'd been carrying—and smiles.
Jacking himself fast and hard, he scooted forward to rub his wet head between Sherlock’s cheeks—groaning each time the tip of his cock caught against the slackened rim of Sherlock’s hole.
I reach back with both hands, curl my fingers around my arse cheeks and pull them wide. “C’mon,” I growl, taunting.
Sherlock ran his other palm over the front of his trousers, needing pressure against his own rock hard prick. His mouth fell open, a weak, choked off sound escaping from his throat. He stroked and squeezed them both in time, until John was thrusting up into his fist and his own rutting had him teetering on the edge.
“Why’re you wearing a that?” Lestrade asked, bemused.
John’s pulls his fingers from his mouth, a lazy smile curling his lips. “You gonna fuck me in the bathroom?”
He walked back into the sitting room in all his naked glory, heavy erection bobbing obscenely with each confident stride. Sherlock, who had stripped to his too-tight briefs, fell to his knees in front of John’s chair.
Standing at the edge of the pool, John’s grin was frozen and preserved in the picture. The sun shining brightly over his head, tracing over the golden mop of hair on John’s head. Someone seems to have thrown a ball into the water and John was playfully deflecting of the spray of water droplets. (Basically, John looked ethereal)
“I know, dad.”
Shaking his head, Mycroft used his fingers to hastily comb back his hair as Greg entered his office. The inspector looked a little worse for wear, eye bags heavy and a slowing gait. (That only meant one thing)
John’s reflexes acted faster than he did, making him spit out his pasta. The chewed up bits spattered over Sherlock’s navy suit, causing John to wince before saying, “I’m sorry?”
He felt like a spy. All to fool his brilliant Detective.
“Sherlock, come on! It’s my Sister!” John berated from the door as he peeked through the eyehole to anticipate his sister’s arrival.
A very disgruntled Sherlock walked into the kitchen, carrying a wailing Rosie in his hands from a distance with a clear look of disgust on his face. “Thank goodness, please take her. She has excreted in her underwear and has not stopped screaming since.”
“Here.” Watson’s eyes shone gleefully as he peeled the star off his forehead and pasted it onto Sherlock’s cheek, “A star!”
“Elevated heartbeat and the dilation of your pupil. I noticed it...recently.” Sherlock blurted, his cheeks turning an adorable shade of pink. He flopped over to John’s left and grinned shamelessly at John.
I lower myself down, elbows on either side of his head, and kiss him. Long and languorous, like the liquid undulation of my body. The glide of our tongues never gets old, but that hungry nip to my bottom lip is new. He licks into my mouth and I suck on his tongue, tasting something dark and sweet—a fresh bloom of lust.
Sherlock ducked his head again, running his lips against the thud of John’s pulse. “People do little else.”
, did he smell delicious. Sherlock would be remiss if he didn't savor this meal.
John withdrew his fingers and gave Sherlock's arse a sound spank. “Good kitties don't speak. They can whimper and grunt and groan, but they cannot speak.”
The chime of the bell followed them out.
John’s cock. Christ. It’s magnificent. It sways, heavy and thick, away from John’s pelvis. The tip, still sheathed, is positively drizzling precome.
As soon as he begins to soften, I collapse onto my side. My muscles are jelly and my heart is still racing. I’m spent in every possible way.
The sudden rush of blood to his groin left Sherlock lightheaded. “Oh,” he exhaled.
Sherlock shuffled forward, one hand still wrapped around his cock—now a tight fist around the base.
John was every bit as beautiful as Sherlock had imagined: sitting up against the headboard, flushed cock in hand, eyes ember-bright with want. His face and chest were flushed, his nipples peaked into rosy buds. He shifted, widened his legs and tilted his cock forward in offering.
He repeated the incident with Lestrade. The look of bewilderment on his face, the confused accusation in his tone. Though Sherlock had buried the flash of mortification, it lingered—a constant presence just under the surface of brilliant deductions and hauteur.
"Yes what? Yes you'll come down?"
“No.” Sherlock peered into large, fluorescent tank. “The part about the fish.”
put it in
Sherlock throws his head back on a whine, because really. What’s he supposed to say to that?
“Gonna fuck you,” he grunts, breath ghosting over my skin, making me shiver.
He rolls his eyes and harrumphs, but I can see a bit of the tension drain out of him. Overcome by an urge to make up for my lack of tact, I stand up, walk the two paces between our chairs, and slide into his lap.
Sherlock moves with him, thrusting up into his tight fist, seeking more. More pressure, more friction, more of that incandescent pleasure building low in his gut. Making his thighs tremble and hips stutter.
"C'mon, Sherlock. Tell me."
John’s eyes drifted down to find Sherlock’s hanging cock—silhouetted in the firelight and throbbing. He wrapped his hand around the girth and stroked once from thick root to leaking tip. Sherlock shuddered, a single curse falling from his lips with a gracious rumble—
Sherlock smiled and leaned down, tongue darting out to catch the remnants glistening against John’s lips. “No, John. Thank you. And thank Mrs. Hudson for her yarn basket. But I think we'll be keeping that crochet hook.”
“Ohhh,” Sherlock breathes, a soft revelation.
“He called hydrogen a noble gas. A noble gas, John. I mean, really?”
There was a wet squelch—a sound filthy enough to make me bury my face and sob out in embarrassment—followed by the warm rush of semen. And John Watson—retired army captain and licensed GP—spread my cheeks apart and ate my arse like a man starved.
. These fucking Omega thoughts—so cloyingly sentimental. It must be the hormones. But as much as I’d love to, I can’t deny the appeal.
“There!” I cry out. “Ohhhh. . . Fuck! Right there! I’m. . . I’m. . .”
Release is like coming up for air after sinking into a churning ocean. It’s gloriously violent. He spurts out thick ribbons that splatter in streaks along the marble between his feet. And it doesn’t ever seem to end.
“Yes,” he groans, already broken.
John’s fingers find the hem of his shorts and, slowly, he tugs them up. It’s an unbearable tease as more and more of that strong thigh is revealed. Pale skin, rarely touched by the sun. Hair so fine and fair that it can’t be seen from this distance.
Sherlock rode John at an ever quickening pace, his breath winding up into keening gasps. He leaned back, sipping in a sharp inhale as the angle of penetration steepened. John filled him perfectly, fat cockhead rubbing against his prostate with each roll of his hips.
“Huh?” Lestrade crossed his arms over his chest. “What’s ‘huh’?”
Sherlock has a predilection for bottoming. But that isn't all it takes to be a bona fide power bottom, as John demonstrates.
“May I?” Sherlock asked, his tongue peeking to trace along John’s thigh.
“I told you I had a surprise ready.” Lips brushed across Sherlock’s shoulder blade. “Now stand right here and close your eyes.”
John’s hand was a warm caress at the small of his back, anchoring Sherlock to the here and now as he was guided up the stairs. The bedroom, often drafty and having gone a bit stale from a lack of use in the last few years, was surprisingly inviting. The bedside lamps bathed the room in soft yellow light, making the towels that covered the duvet and lined the floor look like clouds at sunset—thick and fluffy and drenched in gold. Sherlock counted six chunky candles placed around the room, each giving off a flicker of light and the soothing scent of vanilla, honey, and lavender.
. I try to give these fractured thoughts voice, but sound that comes out of my mouth instead is primal. It starts deep in my gut, clenches in my chest, and punches out in a deep groan. I throw my head back and clench my eyes shut. The only coherent sound I can manage is a grunted out, “Fuck. . .!”
“The lack of orgasms is a pretty big difference.”
“Better. And what are these false pretenses?”
This wasn’t how the morning had started. It had started slow and soft and sweet, with Sherlock nuzzling into the hair at John’s nape and John pressing back into the warm crucible of Sherlock’s body. It had been lazy as Sherlock slicked the leaking tip of his cock over John’s hole and plunged two fingers inside—John still been loose and wet from the night before. There had been no rush as Sherlock fingered John’s arsehole. He’d peppered John’s shoulder and neck with feather-light kisses as he rubbed maddening little circles against John’s prostate, until he was nearly sobbing with the pleasure of it.
“You daft angel! You made me think that you didn’t want to marry me, you complete idiot!” John laughed as he tried to scold Sherlock, effectively looking like a madman.
Rosie blushed, a pretty pink colouring her pale skin. “I have a date on Friday. I hope you won’t mind...”
Mycroft nearly flinched out of shock before answering truthfully, “Your list.”
“Sherlock, just a random question.” John asked, rummaging through his bag for his lunch, “What happened to the secret admirer?”
Greg had obviously noted that Mycroft had arrived back home. However, seeing that he had a tiny child in his hands due to “a dire emergency, Gavin”, he could not go to the door to give Mycroft his usual warm welcome. (Kisses and tea equals a very happy Mycroft)
“I could er... help you.” John grinned, grabbing his bag and reaching in the take a piece of paper.
“Not gay...you said...” Harry teased, waggling her eyebrows at Sherlock, whose cheeks are now tinged the most delicate of pinks.
John’s hand snaked around Sherlock’s waist and pulled him in, the hand holding Sherlock’s snaking upwards to his face. He gently caressed Sherlock’s jaw with his thumb, marvelling at the swirling greens and blues in his eyes before finally getting lost in them.
Depends. -SH
“God, you know I love you.” Mycroft gasped, throwing his head back as Greg unbuttoned his shirt to kiss his neck.
“THAT IS NOT THE VOICE OF REASON!” John shrieked after her.
“Hello, baby bro! So good to see ya! How have you been??!” Harry blurted as she wrapped John in a tight embrace. Without awaiting his response, she leaned over to exhale in front of John’s face.
“My body is a transport. I refuse to succumb to such mind numbing activities.”
“Sorry, Sherlock. He’s a bit-“
John shook his head and came to his cornered husband’s defence, “Your Father is one of the best judges of character I know. Why don’t you just trust him?”
I’ve definitely not been scrolling your Instagram for ages to find any photos of you.
10. The gentle kisses we exchange, almost daily but he still makes it feel like being kissed for the first time.
“Oi! Whatcha up to Sherly boy?” A tall boy named Charles Magnussen (affectionately called Charlie by his mates) slapped Sherlock’s back with force, causing Sherlock to drop his books.
Sherlock leaned in, bumping his nose against John’s, his breath ghosting over John’s lips. As he tried to press his lips against John, neither of them anticipated the hollering of the entire rugby team and the one and only Irene Adler.
“Soo... she’s quite the...character.” Sherlock mumbled, looking at Watson with curious eyes.
(Needless to say, Mycroft and Greg were promptly informed about Rosie’s potential suitor meeting on Friday.)
Lestrade imagines what they must me seeing and cringes internally. Mycroft is lying on his side all fucked out and very naked with Lestrade behind him, his face is no doubt sporting a “I just got laid” look. Mycroft also seems to be drifting off due to sheer tiredness, flushed and breathless.
This one was addressed to him, his name underlined three times in regular black ballpoint ink. The handwriting was a little messy and slightly slanted as if it was written in a hurry. The lined paper was folded into fours and cut to look like a four leafed clover. A cute little holographic sticker in the shape of a heart was pasted on the back.
“Father, I’m not going to discuss fungi on Friday! I have a date!” Rosie protested at Sherlock, who was merely helping John to bake a cake before being attacked with such trifling news.
John smiled and used his fingers to raise Sherlock’s chin upwards to face him. Leaning forward, he marvelled the way Sherlock’s breath quickened when he was about to be kissed. His lips crashed into Sherlock’s, the Cupid bow mouth moving frantically against his own, mouthing his name in a way that sounded like heaven.
He didn’t tell John the most haunting thought in his mind though. The thought that made him a little excited and afraid at the same time. The thought that Sherlock was slowly but surely falling away from John.
“ACCEPTABLE!” Sherlock pronounced, standing up quickly. John gaped at Sherlock from his seated position, not trusting himself to speak lest a string of very unpleasant words tumble out.
Sherlock scrunched his nose up at John’s words and shook his head grouchily. He was situated on the couch, balled up into a mess of luscious curls and long limbs.
“I mean...erm...” John fumbled, taking out the ring with his shaky hands and bowing slightly to make up for not kneeling, “Be my husband? I mean...me marry...JESUS! Will you marry me?”
Asher shook his head and chuckled one of those weird chuckles where the person looks like they might shit their pants. “My intentions are pure, I wouldn’t want to offend or hurt your daughter’s feelings.” He paused to exchange a sweet smile with Rosie, who beamed at him like he was the center of her universe.
“Okay...I will. Just don’t tell Uncle Croft and Uncle Greg.”
“Christmas list?” Greg snorted, giving Mycroft a kiss on the cheek, leaning down to have a look.
Sherlock froze, his brain pausing to relish the touch of John’s callused hand against his cheek. John was touching him. John was touching him. JOHN WAS TOUCHING HIM. OH MY GOD.
“Oh...fuck. Mycroft...” Lestrade sighed, pushing his cock deeper into the other until he was fully sheathed in Mycroft.
“What? Did you finally realise that you were gay for Sherlock?” Harry spoke, voice muffled by phone’s poor quality speaker.
Soon, Lestrade’s two fingers turned into three, each helping to scissor and stretch out the moaning mess that was Mycroft. His quick fingers almost never leaving that precious bundle of nerves, constantly pressing and abusing it, making Mycroft whimper and blink back tears of pleasure.
Lips swollen and puffy from kissing, John swore that he had never been as happy as that night. With Sherlock near him, how could he ever be upset?
Through the earpieces, Mycroft murmured, “Yes, her- bollocks I mean his file is extremely interesting. Why...he’s...”
Great, it’s a date! See you tomorrow, handsome! ;)
“Go to bed, Sherlock. I’ll go there later.” John smiled as the Long legged Detective whined sleepily, finding his actions a little too endearing.
Which led to the second thing John realised. It really was quite simple but it was kinda difficult to totally ignore the fact that the object of his affections was not... receptive of his feelings. John knew he was in love with Sherlock but he didn’t really know what to do about it.
Based on the prompt where Sherlock finally accepts one of Rosie’s boyfriends. Enjoy!
“I can fight my own battles, Watson.” Sherlock snarled, feeling humiliated that he was so weak. He gathered his books quickly and tried not to look at John, trying to will himself to look upset.
Mycroft moans lewdly and starts pushing back against Greg to meet his thrusts. It feels like he’s being split open, and it’s so addictive and amazing that he wants to scream. Then Lestrade changes his angle, tilting Mycroft’s leg upwards and starts rubbing hard over his sweet spot with each thrust.
It was a regular rainy day in the flat. Sherlock had went bouncing off to the morgue to bother Molly for body parts and John was at home enjoying a particularly lovely cup of tea.
As John read, he noticed Sherlock was slowly nodding off to sleep. Sherlock was still cradling John’s hand, pinning him next to the Detective. He smiled at Sherlock, knowing that Sherlock would not see him. The man usually wore a horrendous scowl on his face but while he was sleeping, he was the perfect picture of innocence.
A kiss.
“Sherlock, “ John spoke slowly after a few minutes of intense nuzzling, trying to remove his poor hand so that he could make some tea, “You are running a fever. You should go lie down.”
“No! That wasn’t my intention!” Sherlock’s eyes widened in amusement as he shook his head. His voice lowered considerably as he said, “My answer is a yes.”
They still in the same position and panting feverishly when the door flies open, revealing Sherlock and John, here to collect Rosie.
“I’m doing alright,” Sherlock mumbled, ears turning pink as he snatched the paper heart from Irene.
“But I love you.” John agreed, his hand finding the comfort of Sherlock’s warm spindly fingers.
In a swift move, he pulled Mycroft’s legs apart and licked one bold stripe over his trembling hole. Coating his fingers in his own saliva, Lestrade gently inserted a finger into Mycroft’s arse, relishing in the moans he was eliciting from the other.
“The face you make when you’re about to deduce the shit out of someone.”
John pushed the door open quietly, cursing under his breath as it creaked. “Sherlock?” John whispered, “I’m here.”
John choked on his tea, snorting it up his nose. He scowled at Sherlock, slouching terribly in his chair and trying not to think of a rather disturbing image that involved a shirtless Sherlock wearing army gear. My, what a luscious sight that would be. John bit his lip in thought, it would definitely be a sight John would prize.
Greg nodded understandingly as he set Rosie next to him so that he could properly pay attention to Mycroft. He had spent enough time around the man to know when he needed time alone and when he needed to confide in someone. Today, he sensed that Mycroft was decidedly needing the latter.
Sherlock was pretty much asexual. (Or so John thought) The man said he was married to his work and that (to John) screamed asexual. Curse Sherlock and his vague explanation of his sexuality. Curse him and his “women aren’t my area” bullshit. Stupid Sherlock and his pretty hair. Idiot Sherlock with his pretty eyes and nose and all the other equally attractive body parts. Stupid.
Pointing to the star on his forehead, John explained, “Coach wanted a reward system. The boys got out of hand with it... They apparently can’t be trusted with stickers.”
Momentarily forgetting that Asher by her side, she growled, “Father, did Uncle Croft look him up?”
When he zoned back in, Sherlock was staring at the empty hall, cheeks burning with a naughty shade of crimson.
“I’m not gay.” John admonished to himself, nearly dropping his book when Sherlock raised his eyebrows at him.
Yes. -SH
“I’ll...wait...” Mycroft muttered, eyes already lighting up in anticipation of what was going to happen next.
Although the secret admirer probably didn’t exist, Sherlock couldn’t help but feel a little flattered. It was nice to know that someone liked him, or even bothered to pretend to. At least they tried to sound that they liked him.
“What the hell? Sherlock, he had tattoos! And he looked...!”
“Now, you two go out and have a lovely time. The little babe will be fast asleep when you get home.” Mrs Hudson tickled Rosie under her Chin, rejoicing in the tiny peaks of laughter she was eliciting from the little one.
If I could fit a pair of thigh high stockings in your locker, would you wear it?
“You are... hungry? Are you serious, Sherlock?” John nearly gasped in disbelief at the admission. Almost immediately, his caretaker instinct took over, making him sound like an overprotective Mother hen, “Great, go get your jacket and coat. Bring your wallet. We are going to Angelo’s to get you a proper meal.  Bring an umbrella, it looks like it’s about to rain. If you forget, I will be very disappointed in you.”
Greg paused as he rubbed comforting circles into Mycroft’s palm before breathing out two little heartbreaking words, “Oh, Mycroft....”
“I’m not gay.” John huffed, tearing his eyes away from Sherlock’s chest.
“You are a fucking genius.” John muttered before shaking his head.
“You could say that...” Mycroft groaned as he sat on the couch across Greg. He leaned backwards and swung his umbrella dramatically to the side, looking rather discontent.
Sherlock checked his phone, ignoring the sinking feeling in his stomach as he went into Instagram.
“What did you say?” Sherlock spluttered, nearly dropping the mixing bowl on the ground in surprise. He knew John would react in a much more “normal” way but he was in the toilet and was not setting any standards right now.
“Of course, I am a transgender male but I don’t really see it coming in between us. Rosie has been very understanding.” Asher explained, his cheeks turning red, obviously a little embarrassed.
Greg looked up at Mycroft and blushed, giving Mycroft a small smile as he replied, “Right again, Myc. Anyway, I was curious, is this where you say curiosity killed the cat my love?”
“I’m gay for you, Sherlock”
Well, I know a good place to have coffee and I’m free tomorrow so... if you want to........
“Is it really that terrible?” Mycroft raised an eyebrow, pressing his lips together.
“I won’t.” John smiled.
“Thank you, Mr Holmes.” Asher nodded, before clasping his hands together out of anxiety.
So he told John. He told John, the literal love of his life about how he might be falling for someone else, someone whom he doesn’t even know the name of. He told John about how wonderful the person sounded and how he wished to get to know him, even if his personality might drive him away.
Oh well, it was too late to stop now, he’s already 30 weeks in and there are no signs of stopping. As Sherlock scrolled through John’s Instagram, he recalled what had happened earlier in the afternoon that prompted this chain of events...
Sherlock stared at the paper and sighed. Sneering at the heart, he ripped it into tiny pieces and left it scattered on the greasy floor. When he looked up, he saw John staring at him, baby blues wide open.
“Yeah, of course. Not gay.”
“That you are.” John laughed, wrapping his arms around Sherlock. His hands stroked the other’s back gently, trying to reassure the suddenly very shy Sherlock.
“Sherlock, as your doctor, you should really get some rest.” John glanced at the back of the Detective and giggled internally before sternly continuing, “I refuse to accept no as an answer. I’m going to get you a blanket to sleep in right now.”
They both walked into the cozy Italian restaurant, settling into the booth where they first had dinner together. However, one thing was different:
“You’re doing that thing again.” John mumbled, eyes narrowing at Sherlock over his book.
“So do you, strawberry.”
They quickly ordered their usuals and settled down to eat. Halfway through their meal, Sherlock decides to interrupt the mutual respect for food and manners by blatantly asking John, “Do you like me as a lover, John?”
Harry nodded cheerfully, unaware of the damage she has done. “I know, I’m just here as a voice of reason.” She chirped, standing up and walking to the door by herself. There was a definitive spring in her step.
“Hmm...let’s be gentle tonight. Since you’ve finally admitted to loving me.” Greg hummed as his fingers tilted Mycroft’s head to face his heated gaze.
“Uhh...it’s probably a prank. They didn’t put my name.” Sherlock mumbled, clutching his books tightly to his chest as he walked past, “I need to get to class.”
“They sound lovely.” John spoke reassuringly, patting Sherlock’s shoulder. It was the first thing he had said after hearing what Sherlock had said.
It’s final. It’s impossible, John cannot possibly propose to Sherlock. The rings shall burn forevermore in his pocket until he dies. Alone. Unwanted by anyone.
As Sherlock trudged his way to his room, John went to the kitchen to make two cups of green tea. Sherlock had never been sick before, although it was inevitable, since that man viewed his body as a transport. John bet that he had to be the one to personally nurse Sherlock so that he would actually recover.
“Do you want to smell like me too?” John snorted, reaching a hand up to massage Sherlock’s scalp gently.
Mycroft immediately tapped a sleepy Greg next to him and narrowed his eyes on one of the many monitors in front of him. All of them were of the wonderful Holmes apartment, spanning every room, from the master bedroom (oh dear) to Rosie’s bedroom. (Not the bathroom, because both Rosie and John were about to throw a fit.)
However, it invited a very different reaction that the pouting John though he was about to hear.
Lestrade’s grip tightens around Mycroft as he thrusts in harder. Mycroft feels so good and used like this, pinned under Lestrade, sweat dampening the couch. The other man picks up the pace again, definitely close, mumbling a string of filthy swear words and Mycroft cries out loudly with every thrust.
John leaned forward and captured Sherlock’s sweet lips in his own (which were jabbering about a man cheating on his Wife). He wanted to show Sherlock that he loved him, that he just wanted to hold him and hug him and accept him, deductions and all.
John’s eyes narrowed as the door opened to reveal an Asian boy with a luscious head of black hair. His ears were pierced with black studs and there was definitely some sort of eyeliner on his face. He was wearing a leather jacket in a shocking shade of blue and a pair of slippers adorned his feet. (The tattoos were basically part of the look at this point)
“Argh, right there! There...perfect...” Mycroft babbled as he twisted his head to the side, biting his lips to prevent himself from yelling.
“Too much blood on my shirt, so I threw it away. The coat helped me cover up.” Sherlock mumbled as he stared at the book in John’s hand.
“Move...Greg...” Mycroft gasped at the new feeling. He finds himself panting and squeaking while he fists frantically at the nothing, but the feeling is so good and so consuming that he simply does not care and all he could think about was GregGregGreg.
Are you flirting with me, Sherlock Holmes?
“Fine,” Sherlock relented, turning his body to face John. He reached his hand out to grab the pills and he quickly dry swallowed them. John shook his head in mock disapproval and placed the cold towel on Sherlock’s forehead.
It’s been a while since he’s read romance novels. But he was sucked into the story, like the romantic he was. He could feel his heart swooping in and out as the female lead struggled with her feelings for her female roommate.
“I...erm...couldn’t quite...tell you.” Mycroft finished lamely, trying to look away from Greg’s passionate gaze. He tried to grab the paper and get out of his seat but Greg held him down by his waist instead.
“Sherlock, dear?”
Harry rolled her eyes at him and scoffed, “I’m married and a lesbian but guess what? I’m not blind.”
Sherlock nodded and nuzzled John’s cheek, hiding his burning face. His whole face felt hot and his lips were tingly. “I don’t think I can kiss again, I’m really hot.”
Mycroft hummed his agreement while Greg spluttered incoherently. (“W-what??? Why????? asdfghjkl!!?”) As Mycroft scanned the screen, he took in Asher’s appearance one last time before pulling out his earpiece. “The boy needs a suit, that jacket is most unbecoming of a man.”
“When I fell ill, you fell asleep tending to me. Your saliva also has a very distinct smell which left a residue on my forehead. This was why I looked slightly confused when I woke up as there were traces of your saliva on my skin. You must have kissed me.” Sherlock stated, all the while chewing merrily at his sandwich. (Who orders a sandwich at an Italian restaurant?!)
“I’m not ill, I’m just slightly... not good.” Sherlock muttered, his face flushed a gentle pink due to the high temperature he was running. His words were slightly impaired by his blocked nose, making it very hard for John to take him seriously.
7. The silly dates he brings us on that I secretly love. Especially the little picnics in the park at night. (Even though my best suit was thoroughly stained with grass stains)
Greg nodded as he lifted the tiny babbling child, cooing at her as she giggled. He tucked her into her crib, smiling at the little girl. He knew had a soft spot for the little girl, probably because she reminded him of his own children when they were born. Now, they were more prickly that ever, seeing that they’ve just entered the terrible teens.
Honey, I want to make you smile.
“Well, it’s hard to pay attention to spelling when I’m so close to you, isn’t it?” John whispered, sneaky fingers tracing teasing circles on Sherlock’s arm.
“Be gentle, Mycroft, she’s just a child. Why don’t you just be a little patient, I know just what might cheer you up. Let me just put her in her crib, so that we may not be disturbed.” With that, Greg winked at Mycroft, causing the latter to blush a rather dark shade of crimson.
Still hate it.
4. The fact that I don’t think twelve reasons are enough to cover what I like about Greg.
“I know.”
“She sees you as her Father.” John explained, setting a gentle hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Sherlock has an admiiiiiiirrreeerrr!” Irene sang, giggling at Sherlock’s flustered state. She gave John a suggestive wink and slowly licked her lips for effect.
“Shut up.”
The shirt looked so tight and luxurious. It was probably tailored to Sherlock’s size. Pearly buttons held everything together, protecting the lithe and delicate skin underneath. It was all a perfect little package of beauty. John gulped as his eyes travelled downwards to Sherlock’s pants.
Sherlock slowed his steps, taking time to marvel at John’s adorable embarrassed face. He crawled past the rugby team, pressing his lips in distaste as the sweaty backs of sportsmen made contact with his arm.
John’s so wet that Sherlock doesn’t need to worry about lubrication. He can just pump and twist and wring moan after moan from John’s throat. As he strokes, slow and considerate, he observes the glide of foreskin—rolling up to cover the head, then sliding back to reveal a gently flared crown. Over and over again. It's mesmerizing.
“Of course you did,” John laughed.
He plunges in again, drilling deep, twisting.
“Ohhhh. . .” I whimper. Because that would be lovely. John's thick come marking me, absorbing into my skin. Anything to make his claim that much stronger.
John giggled, a bit manic. “So good. Fuck. So sensitive. It's this pressure, like when you come so hard you nearly pass out.”
The lighting is warm and inviting, the décor a tasteful art deco—replete with mirrors and generous swaths of black and gold. There's a baby grand piano in the corner and the woman at the keys is crooning something soft and sensuous.
“Would you like to taste?”
Lestrade nodded and turned to walk toward his car. Sherlock followed, deigning to accept a ride.
“I know.”
So much warm skin, flushed and glowing. Hard muscle and tight nipples. Golden hair trailing down from the divot of a navel. The steady thrum of blood called to Sherlock, and soon that slow simmer of desire under his skin turned into a blaze, a conflagration he had to fight to control.
John’s balls draw up tight and liquid pleasure burns through his veins. He shouts loud enough that his voice breaks, then he’s coming. Coming so hard a ribbon of semen hits his own chin. His heart is hammering and he’s still panting when Sherlock pulls his thumbs free of his grasping hole and takes him by the hips. He pulls John back onto his cock once, twice, three times, then lets loose a bone-deep groan as he goes rigid. John can feel him pulsing deep inside, making good on his promise.
Fist flying over the head of John’s cock, Sherlock could feel his own climax building, throbbing deep in his balls in time with each of John's soft grunts.
Sherlock unwrapped his scarf as he looked around the shabby apartment. Thatcher-era furniture, little in the way of decoration, and a kitchen that seemed more suggestive than functional. The bleakness of it all made the high end saltwater aquarium on the far wall glow like a beacon. Curious.
—as Sherlock arched back.
“I'm not talking about clients.”
.” John threw his head back, tendons in his neck straining. “Close.”
“Water’s almost boiled,” he said over his shoulder as John finally crossed the threshold.
devolved into grunts of pure pleasure, when his grip on my hips shifted and tightened, when the fat head of his cock pulled back to piston, rapid and shallow, in my arse.
John’s answering smile is nearly blinding. “Fantastic!”
Sherlock pulled back his lips, let his fangs slide against supple flesh. He lapped once more, savoring the brine of sweat and metallic tang of blood pumping just under skin. His tongue traced the path of hidden arteries and veins, a preternatural instinct driving him to seek out the perfect place to bite.
John’s hands slide down his back, tracing fire through his shirt. They settle on his hips, tug him closer, and—oh, God.
I lean back, plant my hands on Sherlock’s thighs for balance, and thrust into his hand. The angle has his cockhead glancing against my prostate with every undulation and a dense pit of pleasure has formed behind my balls. The stimulation that flares up with each pass of his hand along my cock is suddenly too much—too sharp, too bright. I sob for him to let go and he does, moving both his hands to my hips, pushing and pulling me. He kicking his hips up again, following along with the rhythm I’ve set.
"I've got us all set up, upstairs." To the uninitiated, John would have sounded perfectly placid. But Sherlock could hear the clear undertone of intent.
“John?”
“Dinner?”
John’s other hand came up to card through Sherlock’s curls, pushing the fringe from his forehead. It was a tenderness Sherlock hadn’t experienced since he’d last felt sunlight on his face. He let his eyes drift shut and leaned into it.
He grips my phone firmly in one hand and brushes the curls back from my forehead with the other. His hips are trembling, little quakes that bump his cock against my tongue as I flick and circle at the very tip.
He looks at me askance, but doesn't object as I comb back his fringe and lean in to press featherlight kisses along his hairline. I rest my temple against his, brush my lips over the shell of his ear. “But, since we're having the conversation now...” I whisper, thrilled to feel him shiver beneath my touch, “Yes, I do enjoy getting bummed from time to time. And when I do, I prefer to take control.”
khakis he confiscated from my wardrobe. “You've never bottomed before.”
Sherlock gave Lestrade his third most withering expression. “It doesn't change the fact that this body has no defensive wounds, or that all the previous victims were working class and this man was obviously in a high-stress management role with aspirations of climbing the corporate ladder.”
I could come like this. With him draped over my back and a quick fist running over my cock. God it would be amazing.
He dragged Sherlock back into the nest of bedding, covering them with the duvet once again. John hugged Sherlock close—wrapped his arms tight around his middle and pressed soft kisses into the nape of his neck. Sherlock gave a contented sigh, pushing back into the embrace. Without the adrenaline of the case or the ardor of their lovemaking, exhaustion was quick to take over.
“Oh?” John says, but his nonchalance is belied by the way his tongue slips over his bottom lip. “That seems a waste.”
“Old world vampirism.” Sherlock grinned, not bothering to hide the razor-sharp tips of his canines.
“That’s my good kitty,” he said, wistful and affectionate. “Why don't you take a little nap. You've earned it.”
“So you boiled it.” Sherlock couldn’t resist drawing this moment out. Pulling it like taffy—teasing and enticing.
“There’s more?” Sherlock asked, teasing but nonetheless intrigued.
John glanced at him, harrumphed, and looked back out the window. Sherlock scooted closer, pressed himself against John's side. He dropped his head to John’s shoulder and slipped his hand over John’s thigh. He squeezed, released. Squeezed, released.
But I’ve never shied away from danger.
When he hears the rasp of the zip, Sherlock sighs in relief. He's beyond aching—so hard and on edge, it's a bit of a surprise that he doesn't come in his pants when John reaches into the open vee and palms him.
John fisted the duvet. He wanted this. If the thick bulge distending his briefs wasn’t evidence enough, the rough gravel of his voice gave it away as he growled, “Oh God, yes.”
My eyes flutter closed as the stretch changes from a fleeting suggestion to a bold intrusion. That sweetly tapered crown inches deeper, catches on my rim for a wonderfully agonizing second, then pops in. I can feel the way my body wraps around him. Welcoming.
“Oh, fuck. Oh! Fuck!”
“Sherlock. . .” he whines. It’s an exquisite sound, pure and fine and unwittingly revealing—like dust on a mantle. It tells me everything I want to know.
“Sherlock,” John sighed. “What are you doing?”
John was, in Sherlock’s opinion, being a bit dramatic. The collar wasn't blatantly obvious. And Lord knows, this lot would be hard pressed to find a puddle in a rain storm. But still. The threat was there.
Sherlock nodded, nuzzling his cheek against John’s thigh. “A double negative like that must mean I've got quite the punishment coming. Am I going get a spanking?”
Lestrade grimaced. "Do I even want to know?"
“It was. . . Interesting, I suppose. But after a few times I got bored.”
Sherlock’s heart began to race—adrenaline pumping through his veins, blood rushing to his cock. He looked at John with a hint of challenge and traced the tip of his tongue over his top lip. The answering flare of heat in John’s eye could melt glaciers. He pursed his lips and the message to Sherlock was clear:
John and Lestrade responded in unison.
“You can and you will, provided you want to me to suck you off. You do want that, don’t you, John? To pump a hot load straight down my throat?”
This is going to be so good.
“Hmm?” He still looking at me. Still suckling on his fingertips.
The femoral vein sat slightly too far back and a bit too deep—the position would be awkward. The great saphenous vein, though. That snaking blue ribbon was perfect.
“It helps to pay for books and lab fees.” Sherlock pulled back, looking for a glint of humor in John’s eyes. He frowned when he found none. John shrugged. “As a paycheck goes, it's not bad. It’s not like it's hard work. But, ya know. People talk.”
“That is
Above him, John moaned like a man undone. He gasped and cursed and held nothing back. Bellows of pure pleasure, rumbles of distilled ecstasy. From his position on the floor—kneeling at John’s feet, with a hot prick between his lips—Sherlock marveled.
Sherlock looks over at John, utterly confused.“Who’d want me for a boyfriend?” John lifts an eyebrow and Sherlock blinks. “Oh.”
John doesn’t wait for Sherlock to get to the table, he grabs his pint and meets him in the middle of the room. “Fancy meeting you here.”
Mycroft had never felt so upset at Sherlock in his life. Okay, that was an exaggeration. Mycroft was far more upset when Sherlock childishly covered everything in his office with whipped cream. But still.
What do you mean? -SH
“Ugh.” Greg groaned as he collapsed on the chair, rubbing his forehead as he gratefully accepted the glass of water that Mycroft pushed in front of him.
There were two things that John felt after he came to terms with his sexuality.
Mycroft closed his eyes and sighed, “You know, your comforting tactic may have worked a lot better if my dear Brother hadn’t left that child here.”
“Oh. You...aren’t ready?” John offered, heart sinking as he watched the love of his life say nothing in response.
As Sherlock typed, he let a slow smile spread on his face as he conversed with Watson. They continued to chat till the evening, arguing about the wonderful picture John had posted of himself.
John’s eyes drifted to the detective’s face, a perfect image of innocence and smiled. Maybe he did. Maybe he did like Sherlock. Who cared? He kinda does like Sherlock.
“I am not bringing him home. You scare away all my dates, Father. Every time I want to go out and have fun, you spoil it!” Rosie huffed and turned away from her parents.
“My Brother is quite the piece of work, I sometimes find myself thankful that I do not work in close proximity with him.” Mycroft smiled fondly at Greg, “Do you want anything? Massage oil? A massage? Biscuits?”
John smiled when he heard Sherlock’s “I’m annoyed at you” huff. A few weeks ago he would have recoiled at the thought of even entertaining the grouchy man but ever since he realised he had feelings for the insufferable git, he’s become more tolerant of Sherlock’s antics.
“Let’s go to the living room, I’ll get tea.” John mumbled, turning toward the Kitchen.
“You could write back.” John smiled, the tips of his ears turning a slight pink. (Must be from the heat of the sun....)
Greg mumbled the words as he read, eyes brightening with every line he read out. Almost simultaneously, Mycroft’s cheeks were tinted a slight red with every word Greg mumbled. When Greg reached the end, Mycroft’s cheeks and ears were basically the epitome of fire engine red.
You’re so pretty.
The pants were so clean and well cut. Not a single piece of lint was found on it and it was very snug in different areas. Not to mention, Sherlock’s.... ahem. It hugged Sherlock’s thighs just so that everyone could see his toned thigh muscles. John didn’t realise his friend was so fit. But then again, Sherlock was full of surprises.
“Sherlock, you are sick and you can’t go out!” John berated the pouty mess of a man lying on the couch.
Sherlock’s eyes sparkled as he mumbled quietly, “I like that.”
As Watson left the room to find a blanket, Sherlock felt the corners of his mouth turn upwards into a reluctant smile. Somewhere in his mind palace, he was berating himself for having feelings for his flatmate. But John was the first person to genuinely like Sherlock and it was only natural for Sherlock to feel an attraction towards him. (Also, quite embarrassingly so, Sherlock had a thing for army men. Not that he would admit it. But the thought of it was... entertaining)
“Was it a good kiss then?” John blushed, his face still ever so close to Sherlock’s.
Harry’s pride was rather apparent as she grinned at her Brother. “Tad— oh my...who is this?” Harry purred, glancing behind John’s shoulder to look at Sherlock.
Sherlock nodded awkwardly, trying not to freak out about the mere five centimetres that kept them apart. He could nearly smell the mint in John’s breath and was trying not to desperately sniff John’s mouth.
John couldn’t help himself as he reached out his spare hand to stroke Sherlock’s curls. Smiling fondly at the sleeping man, John wanted to give him a little kiss, right on the tip of his nose.
So Sherlock just let it happen. And he basked in the happiness he felt every time he received a message. Yet somehow, in the bottom of his inner consciousness, he wanted more.
“But you love me.” Sherlock pointed out, poking John’s ribs in protest.
Sherlock nodded, a tiny smile gracing his lips as he handed the still screeching Rosie to John. A gleeful grin spread throughout John’s face as he watched Sherlock unload the groceries into the fridge, totally unaware of the question John was about to spring on him that night.
John snorted. The mere thought that Sherlock’s devilishly handsome looks were more than enough to change a person’s sexuality was hilarious. He was about to say so until he remembered Irene Adler. Damn it. So he really was that good looking a bloke?
John smiled at Sherlock, whose eyes were fixated on how perfectly their hands fit together. The taller was shocked into silence and he was just smiling fondly at their hands.
“John?” The Detective in question asked, shaking John out of his stupor. “What I’m about to ask of you is something very strange and out of the norm for me. You must answer me honestly without getting too excited. Can you do that?”
“Sherlock, you haven’t slept for days.” John crossed his arms and frowned at the Detective across him. The silver moon outside the window would mark the third night Sherlock refused to sleep and John was getting a little worried for him.
It’s been four years since The Kiss and John was very happy and content with where they were. They were boyfriends who solve murders  and kiss and have sex. They were also Boyfriends who were still loving and sweet.
“Oh, I’ll help you Johnny boy. I have questions.” Harry winked at Sherlock, who managed to look incredibly adorable and mildly disgusted by it.
Sherlock ducked his head and whispered, “Wanna give them a show?”
“Noooooo. You smell good.”
John sat across Sherlock on the couch, not really listening to the boring conversation that Sherlock and Harry were immersed in. He was far more interested how Sherlock looked in his outfit.
Option d) He could delete John’s Instagram account by guessing John’s password.
His heart was stalled in his chest as Sherlock’s shocked expression turned into one of utmost anger. Sherlock huffed and leaned back, muttering angrily under his breath.
He had been timing his own grocery runs to see how Long they were on average. He would then get Molly to buy all the things on his grocery list while he ran to get the rings and collect them on his way home. All within the average time it took for him to go to the supermarket.
