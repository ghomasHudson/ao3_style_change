Dean had taken a moment to himself in the car then. He sat on the seat of the car with his boots settled on the cement of the parking lot. The door to the Impala was swung wide and the lights of the parking lot cast a warm orange glow around the edges of everything.
Dean was eating alone for once.  Normally, Cas would come to fetch him when he deemed it was time for meals.  Dean had waited around, loitering in the courtyard for Cas to make his appearance.  But, the bird never showed.  Dean finally made his way into the kitchen when his stomach started to growl at him.  He’d managed to walk off most of his irritation earlier and was in a reasonable mood now.  It was weird that Cas wasn’t there with him, mealtimes were the only time he spent any time with Dean and that was like… the whole reason he was here.
Dean sighed and rolled his eyes in irritation.  “Nevermind, it was just a joke.”  He set his glass down a little more firmly than necessary and looked over the available items.  “Alright, how does stir fry sound?”
Castiel ruffled his feathers against his back in agitation.  He didn’t like keeping things from Dean, but he couldn’t disclose this information to him.
Dean stood quickly and scrubbed a hand over his face.  He turned towards Castiel with a firm resolve on his face and nodded to the bird once.  He stepped across the hall to grab his bag quickly  and clenched his fists at his sides firmly.  He met Castiel’s eyes and frowned.  “Okay, I’m ready.”
The drive to the hospital always took way too long in Dean’s opinion.  It was around a twenty minute drive, Dean always managed to cut it down to about 15 minutes, but it always felt like an eternity.  The sounds of Sam’s wet cough were the only sounds that broke the air between them the whole way.
He was crashing hard from the adrenaline of earlier. He was going to have trouble keeping his eyes open that night. He ran his hands through his hair and placed his fingers together against the back of his neck.
“Dean…”  Sam started but shook his head.  “Dean, what in the actual fuck are you talking about?  Are you being serious?”
Dean had asked him one night what he liked to do in his spare time.  He hadn’t had an answer, he wasn’t familiar with the concept of doing things for fun or recreation.  As a member of the Host, he’d either been carrying out orders from his superiors or singing along with his brothers and sisters in the Heavenly Choir.  He supposed he had enjoyed the singing, it had been uplifting and beautiful.  Though, there was no way this large avian throat of his would be able to conjure the sounds the way he remembered them.  Instead, he had told Dean a story of his time as a soldier when he was younger.  It had been carefully edited to remove some of the more incriminating details, bound as he was by the curse he was under, but he had been able to get his point across.
There was a stiff silence around them for another minute before Bobby sighed heavily.  “Alright, look.  Your daddy and me had a nice long talk this morning before the two of you got up.  He’s promised to drop all of this bullshit for now so we can stop walking on damn eggshells around here.  He ain’t happy-“
He wasn’t nearly smart enough to debate that topic.  Which was why he was so uncomfortable with the position he now found himself in.  He huffed in irritation and slammed a fist down against his mattress.  What the hell was he supposed to do?!  Disgusted with himself, he threw his covers off of him and swung his legs over the side of the bed.  He rested his elbows on his knees and his forehead in his upturned palms.
Dean thought back over every interaction he’d had with the bird.  It had all seemed innocent and genuine.  But he was starting to doubt his own memories.  Was that really what had happened, or had those memories been faked for his benefit?  He honestly couldn’t be sure of anything right now.  And he only had a few days left before Cas came back.
He wondered just what he would be eating here.  He hoped like hell it wasn’t going to be muskrats or pigeons or something.  If it was… well, at least he would be able to cook it first.  He had a million questions swirling inside his head.  In fact, he seemed to have more now than he had before Castiel had come to get him.  Where did they go from here?  What was he eating?  Where was Castiel’s room?  Who had lived here before?  What happened to the rest of Castiel’s species?  There was no end to his questions, every topic and every subject held his curiosity.  But, first and foremost, he needed one thing answered.
Sam shrugged, but Dean knew that he was just as curious if not more so.  He still hadn’t forgotten Sam’s little presentation on Thunderbirds.  The three men had a quiet breakfast together while they waited, and avoided the topic of Dean’s departure.
Please note that my Spanish is VERY limited.  So if you're looking for the translations and they're bizarre you can blame my dumbass brain.
Dean felt his brows slam down. To stay with this thing? Where? For how long? To do what? He had a lot of questions and it didn't sound like his buddy Castiel here was going to be giving answers.
She gave him a wry smile before her face became serious again. They had instituted a policy pretty early on in Sam's care with his healthcare providers and Pam specifically. They wanted good news and bad news, bad news was always first and always delivered with brutal honesty, no sugar coating. Good news was given after to soften the blow.
They eventually reached the bay doors of the ER and Dean was quick to usher Sam into the waiting room.  Most of the staff of the hospital was at least marginally familiar with the brothers.  They were here frequently enough that their faces were recognizable if nothing else.
Dean turned to blink at the bird.  Castiel gestured behind him with a tilt of his head.  Dean’s eyes followed the movement.
A muscle twitched in John’s jaw and he sucked on his teeth aggressively.  He studied Dean around Sam’s larger figure, the wheels turning quickly behind his eyes.  Dean missed the calculating expression in the man’s eyes, he was too busy rubbing at the bridge of his nose in an attempt to stave off a headache.
“Good.”  Dean said with a little more enthusiasm than necessary.  In a flash, he’d reached out with the backs of his fingers and flicked Sam sharply in the crotch before tearing ass back into the living room.
His stomach let out a particularly loud grumble the closer he got to the kitchen.  He was starving!  He hadn’t eaten all day and while it had been interesting to wander up and down the hallways and get the lay of the land, he should have paid more attention to his body's cues.  Once in sight of the kitchen, Dean scooted just a little quicker than he had been and entered the room before Castiel.
Dean felt a small tremor begin in his hands.  John wasn’t a BAD man per se, but he was a master manipulator and Dean was familiar with all of his father’s gaslighting techniques.  Ignoring them was another matter entirely though.
“I’m thinking!”  Dean snapped in agitation.  He could likely tell him everything he’d told Sam, and maybe a little about Cas, without revealing his name or anything like that.  His best shot was to be vague.  The only thing Cas had truly asked was that he not spend any time alone with his dad.  So maybe it wasn’t as secret as he was making it out to be?
When he finally trotted back down the stairs, he had around 2 hours left.  John was sitting silently in the armchair in the living room and Dean gave him a tight smile but didn’t greet him other than that.  John scared him, he always had.  And despite his warnings and threats about Cas, Dean really didn’t want to have a problem today.  Once he was back at the clay mansion he’d have plenty of time to consider his next move.
This was another of Dean’s references.  A character named Bugs Bunny would say this to a farmer with a speech impediment, he wasn’t sure how that related to him.
Dean’s momentary joy at seeing his father faded like a candle being snuffed out.  It was time to face the music, as they said.  He just wished the music was something upbeat instead of the funeral dirge he thought he could hear playing.
“Just don’t stab him or anything.  I mean, it won’t hurt him but it gives a bad first impression, ya know?”  Dean teased them.
He grinned in triumph and wiped the back of one hand across his brow.  He’d cut open one of his eyebrows at some point but he wasn’t paying attention to it.  He couldn’t stop smiling.  It had been forever since he’d been on a hunt and he’d done this one all on his own.  It felt freeing to be out on his own and doing what he was made to do.
“What the Hell are you talking about, boy?”  Bobby looked at Sam suspiciously and placed his hands on his hips.
An indeterminate time later found Dean sitting on his bed morosely.  He must have spaced out at some point, because the sun had set significantly since he’d entered the room.
Dean ran his hands over the area gently to assure himself that all was back in its proper place.  The feeling of his calloused fingertips running along the tender skin of his wing made Cas shudder involuntarily.  Dean stilled immediately.  “Did that hurt?”
The same couldn’t be said for the others.  They were each in various stages of disbelief: Bobby was in a half crouch as if he’d started to rise from the bench only to stop midway through, Sam still had an arm raised halfway across his face and his mouth hung open in shock, and John… well, John looked…  Dean couldn’t place the expression but it wasn’t a friendly one, shocker.
Dean was brushing his teeth in the kitchen and eyed Castiel suspiciously.  The two regarded one another silently for a moment before Dean spit in the sink and washed out his mouth.  “What’s up, Doc?”
He pulled easily on the trigger and the sound of the gunshot shattered the peace of the forest around them. Dean continued to hold the gun level, waiting to see what the reaction of the creature would be. Hopefully, the damn thing would keel over and Dean could pop it once in its feathered brain before getting the hell out of here.
Dean was also allowed to go on more hunts on his own from time to time.  Castiel knew that he liked stretching his legs, so to speak, and feeling as though he was doing something useful.  He wasn’t able to go often, and even then not for long periods of time.  The requirements of the spell wouldn’t allow it, but Dean didn’t seem to mind.  And he was always so spirited and happy when he returned.  It filled Castiel with a warmth in the space where his heart resided.
He was held immobile for another few moments before Bobby turned to him expectantly. Right, right, no freaking out now.
It took a few more weeks for Dean’s days to start to take shape.  Eventually, he and Cas managed to develop a schedule.  Dean would wake early still, clean up in his copper tub, Cas would call for him politely from the other side of the sheet that Dean had hung over his door.  They would eat breakfast, he would amuse himself for a few hours, they would have lunch, more self entertainment, then dinner and bed.  He’d gotten used to the soft sounds he heard every night and the weird pressure on his bed and he hardly noticed it now.  Life here wasn’t terrifying, it was just boring.
Bobby chuckled at the brothers and rolled his eyes.  “Like I don’t know my own kids.”  He mocked them lightly.  And it was true, Bobby knew exactly what the two of them liked and exactly what the two of them hated.
Dean eyed Cas in disbelief.  Considering the state of the bird’s health once he’d returned, Dean found it hard to believe that he could have any kind of good news.  Unless it was some strange Cas version of good news, like “the wild marmot population of New Guinea has moved out of endangered status” or something equally as bizarre.  It was hard to tell with Cas but Dean listened politely to him nonetheless.
Bobby huffed in irritation beside him.  “One foot in the grave and you’ve still got a damn smart mouth.”  He stepped up to the bed and ran his rough hand gently through Sam’s hair.  “Get some sleep, idjit.”  Bobby gave him a tender look before stepping away in his heavy work boots.
“Don’t JOHN me!  I ought to knock your fucking teeth in, Dean!  What were you thinking?!”  John had finally stood from his chair and was towering over Dean with a look of abject fury on his red face.
Another bang followed the first.  Dean hurried from his room to see Sam across the hall, napping on his bed peacefully.
Pam took another quick glance at the monitor’s around Sam’s bed before nodding to them all with a half smile.  “I’ll be back in a few hours to check on you, Sam.  You two,”  she turned to Dean and Bobby, “get home and get some rest.  Sam will be fine here, he needs some sleep too.  And I don’t doubt that you’ll be giving him a tongue thrashing about taking care of himself, but save it for the morning.  He’ll likely fall asleep half way through at this point and that takes all the fun out of reprimanding someone.”
He said solemnly one morning.  He’d been thinking over the situation for a while and had finally resolved to do something about it that day.  He just needed to let Dean know his intentions.
He smiled at them and felt the tension in his heart relax. People were still out in the world, living like normal. How long had he even been gone? How long had it been since he’d seen people in the flesh? It wasn’t a thought he wanted to dwell on.
“Boy!  They didn’ have any of that kale or whatever it’s called at the store.  You’ll just have to make due with lettuce like the rest of us common folk!”  Bobby’s gruff voice called out from the kitchen.
Sorry for the delay everyone!  I took some good advice and took a little break for my mental health.  It was much needed but I'm feeling refreshed and will be posting regularly again now!  I promise that things will lighten a little bit in the story soon, then of course they'll get dramatic again, as is the nature of fairytales.
It took only a moment for the two of them to smile at one another sadly and then embrace fiercely.  They gripped one another tightly as if trying to make sure that the other was actually there.  They hugged for longer than they ever had before stepping back from each other and searching each other for injuries.
If he was being honest it was strange, but he assumed it was just because this was a wholly new experience.  He shifted his wings against his back and settled down further on his feet.  He was as comfortable as he ever got, he supposed, and it was nice being so close to Dean.  They were close enough that they could be touching if one of them shifted even slightly.  It gave him a thrill he couldn’t explain.
He needed to get cleaned up.  He felt grimy and uncomfortable in his clothes.  He’d been wearing them for the last 24 hours so that wasn’t a surprise.  He eyed the copper tub surreptitiously and the open archway of his room.  He didn’t love the idea of being naked in a new place without a door to lock but he didn’t have much choice.  If he went quickly, maybe he could be done before Castiel woke up from wherever he was sleeping.  Did he sleep?  Whatever.
Bobby frowned at the paper, but looked it over and listened as Dean explained everything.  There was more to go over than he had realized, he’d been doing all of this for so long that it just felt natural now.  He’d spent hours compiling all of this information and he was hoping that he hadn’t forgotten to include anything.  But if he had, he didn’t doubt that Bobby and Sam could figure it out together.
Dean paused again. This thing could heal Sam? No, of course it couldn't. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. This was a ploy, just like any other, this thing just had a better bargaining chip than most. Normally, these things offered riches and women, fame and glory, everlasting life or any of the other things people dreamed of. No, it was a tactic.
He wasn’t sure what time it was.  Not that it really mattered in this place, with everything blending together inside the clay walls of his new home.  But, he liked to have an idea, it made him feel more in control of what was going on here.  He wasn’t feeling particularly hungry at the moment, he’d eaten just a few hours ago.  Cas had told him to find him when he’d gotten up so it looked like he was going on a bird hunt!
Dean turned back towards his new home and braced his shoulders.  He’d stare down whatever was waiting for him in there, just like he had everything else in his life, with a smirk and his GED.
. He had begun counting in his head to see how long it would take until John’s temper snapped.  He made it to four before the man spoke.
He yawned quietly before turning on his side and nuzzling back into his pillow.  He was sleeping in a new place, it was probably just his nerves.  He was back asleep within a few moments.
The two were silent after that, Sam was busy clacking away on his laptop and Dean poured himself a fresh cup of coffee.  He doubted that Sam was going to let the subject drop, but he had a reprieve for now.
He’d found that the longer Dean was here, the more he wanted to spend time with him.  At first, it had been a chore to force interactions with the human, he was used to observing, not communicating.  But, Dean had quickly wormed his way beyond Castiel’s exterior and found a space for himself inside his thoughts.  Castiel frequently wondered what Dean was doing, where he was, what he was thinking; it was a strange experience for him.
After a time, John joined them in the backyard.  The atmosphere was a little tense but they were all bravely pushing forward as if Dean wasn’t about to leave them for an indefinite amount of time again.  They grabbed plates and ate their burgers, thanking Bobby profusely for cooking them.  Sam and Dean joked and teased one another, Bobby grouched that they were still acting like toddlers and all the while, John sat silently and listened.
Castiel approached him from behind and looked up at the building before them.  Dean wondered what the strange creature was thinking but he didn’t ask.
Cas puffed his wings around him a few times before settling down again.  He looked pensive, which made Dean even MORE doubtful that he had good news.  Christ, was this bird trying to make a joke?  Dean crossed his arms over his chest and raised his eyebrows to urge Cas to continue.
The thing was still trying to talk to him and Dean shuddered at the sound. The creature's mouth wasn't moving but the sound was still coming loud and clear in his mind and on the wind.
Dean frowned at that in thought.  “Is that why it feels so weird when you carry me places?  We aren’t flying, we’re like hopping between reality and whatever the other place is?”
Castiel looked affronted from his position at the door and Dean watched in amusement as the feathers around his neck and wings puffed up in irritation.  “Guess not.”  Dean muttered under his breath with a smirk.  Castiel was REALLY easy to rile up, that would be entertaining if nothing else.
“You too, boys, get some rest.  I have a feelin’ tomorrow’s gonna be a rough one.”  Bobby said quietly.
That actually earned him an indignant squawk and he felt himself smile at that reaction against his will.
Dean levelled his younger brother with a hard stare.  He’d given Sam and Bobby the basics and really hadn’t said anything to them about Cas, hoping to protect the guy for some bizarre reason.  Sam was trying to be sneaky, like Dean was under some kind of spell and couldn’t speak about the terms of his contract.  He rolled his eyes and took another sip of his coffee.
The water swirled lazily out of the faucet and down the drain.  It was a hypnotic motion and he watched it for a few minutes, allowing himself to relax and refocus on the situation at hand.  He needed to get his bearings first.  Castiel had told him he was safe, but he didn’t ever trust people at their word, human, bird or otherwise.
“I know you SAID that you couldn’t tell us more about this super secret, mysterious, magical bird that you’ve been living with but…”  Sam pressed.
Dean startled at that. Castiel looked nervous and wouldn't meet his eye after his simple pronouncement. Oh no, he needed more than that.
“Now then,”  Bobby lifted a wrinkled bag from somewhere and the smell of grease permeated the room.  “I know the food here ain’t worth a lick, so how about we forget your lungs for a while, boy and clog your arteries instead?”
The wind continued to pick up until the dirt made its way upwards and into his eyes. Dean snapped his eyes closed with a soft cry and covered his face with an arm. Finally, a gust smacked into him so hard that he had to spread his feet quickly to keep his balance. There was silence then and Dean tensed.
He continued to wait, but no further sounds came.  Dean felt himself relax slightly.  He had just woken from sleep, maybe it was leftover from a dream.  Cas had told him he would be safe as long as he minded his own business and slept in the dark.  The instructions were pretty simple.  Dean didn’t feel like he was being watched, there was no malicious intent in the air.  He actually felt pretty comfortable all things considered.
“Uh yeah, so this is Cas.  Um, Cas… this is my family.  John Winchester, Bobby Singer, and Sammy.”  He pointed to each person in turn as he was giving introductions.
Silence echoed around the house and the three men in the kitchen looked at one another in resignation before putting on brave faces and exiting to the living room.  Dean was irritated with himself for not feeling excited to be seeing his father.  He’d once idolized the man, but that had been tempered by disappointment over the years as John had continuously let him and Sam down.
Dean felt his temper spike at Sam’s condescending tone.  They’d been over this before, over the entire course of Sam’s illness, Dean had hoped and he’d prayed and he’d begged for a cure, one that never came.  He refused to believe that God existed, and even if He did, He didn’t give a shit about them.  And angels?  Yeah fucking right.  He didn’t want to start a fight with Sam this early in the morning though.
“What happened?”  Dean asked quietly.  He was mostly sure that Cas was okay now, but he enjoyed the feeling of the large, smooth feathers under his fingertips.  He’d been wondering what they felt like for months and now that he had the opportunity to get his hands on them, he was reluctant to let them go.  They were softer than he’d realized and he just barely resisted the urge to rub his cheek against them.
“It’s not-  I’m not…”  Sam ran a hand through his hair and blew the air out of his lungs with a whoosh.  “It’s school stuff.”
The minute the feather brushed against Sam’s forehead, that same blinding light spread across the room.  Dean refused to close his eyes this time though, he simply squinted and did his best to focus on Sam.  He still wasn’t convinced this bird would keep his word, and so he didn’t want to risk closing his eyes with Sam so close to it.
He’d been listless the last few days, and he knew that Cas had noticed.  The guy might not read social cues that great, but even he could see that Dean was miserable.  He was picking at his lunch without much interest, another stir fry that he was starting to get sick of.
Dean's thoughts of matching member jackets and ID cards came to an abrupt halt when he finally got a good look at his brother. This wasn't right… there were too many machines. There hadn't ever been this many machines before…
“I ought to tell you, boy.  I called yer daddy this morning.”  Bobby said with a scratch under his hat.
The three men settled at the dining room table, groceries forgotten and abandoned in various states of unpacking.  Bobby and Sam were looking at Dean expectantly and Dean swallowed nervously.  He hadn’t really checked with Cas on what he could and couldn’t reveal.  It would obviously be best to err on the side of caution.  He could make something up, but he doubted Bobby would believe some bullshit, the man was like a human lie-detector.
He felt the hair on the back of his neck prickle again, just like in the parking lot of the hospital.  He wasn’t willing to let it go this time though, something was watching him.  Likely that same something that had been spying on him in the parking lot.
Sam realized his mistake too late, and there was no way to get around it now.  He glanced awkwardly at Dean and Dean again turned his eyes Heavenward in a plea for assistance.  He just could not catch a damn break.
He wandered around the hallways and sloping corridors of the mansion for a time.  He could likely just call out for the bird and find him easily enough, but he wasn’t in a rush and it felt nice to feel the warm clay under his feet.
He could hear John inhale sharply, likely about to start in on him again, when an angry voice cut him off.
Dean woke feeling groggy.  He’d stayed up much later last night than he should have.  But… he was leaving today, and he had wanted to spend as much time as possible with his family before then.  He hadn’t actually wanted to sleep at all, but his body had overruled his brain on that one.  As it was, he had only managed to get a couple of hours.  He wiped a rough hand over his face and looked out the window to his left.  It was still dark out and dawn didn’t look like it was coming anytime soon.
Bobby turned around with a hand on the counter and a coffee mug in the other.  “You know I’ve been tellin’ ya this since you was in diapers, but you gotta learn to slow down!  That instant gratification yer always lookin’ for comes with a price.”  Bobby lifted his eyebrows meaningfully, and Dean assumed he was supposed to read more into the statement than just a comment on drinking coffee too fast.
“Please leave.” There was a beat of silence in the air. Neither of them ready for what was about to come.
“And I could not. Cas, could not open it either. I don't know why it opened for you, but we have to stay calm, okay?”
“You have to know that the attraction you fear is mutual, Dean. Always has been. Otherwise, the spell would have never worked.”
as he walked over to the cardboard box. Not many things were in it yet. A few books on which he put his pseudo magic guide, a few torn letters and a plain wooden box. The wood was smooth and looked almost new. It didn't seem to belong in there at all. Dean picked it up and walked back to his chair, still looking at the box in his hands. He turned it over, looked at all sides and felt something inside it move.
He would fix this. Whatever that may take. With determination within reach, Dean slowly stood up before falling onto his mattress when a headache greeted him in a low beat against his skin. He groaned when the dizziness did not go away as he approached the door, holding onto the wood in support.
Dean was breathing heavily as thousands of scenarios ran through his head and not one of them had a happy ending.
But Dean couldn't finish his sentence. The locket had sprung open with a click. He didn't dare to move as he felt magic gushing around him, lifting papers and spinning them through the air before it dissipated. He looked at Cas and found the Angel already staring at him with an unreadable expression.
The light in the hallway was not helpful either, but he managed to slowly make his way through the bunker and look for any signs of Cas. He ended up standing in the library’s entrance hoping to find the Angel sitting in a chair, head in a book perhaps. But nothing. The library was empty. And Dean was not surprised. Yet still he called out for him.
Cas was sitting across from Sam, hands occupied with inspecting a book that looked as if it might combust if only one looked at it the wrong way. The angel hummed quietly seemingly satisfied with whatever conclusion he had made about it and looked up.
“It's selfish of me, but I like it when you're near me. Yet at the same time I can’t bear it. I always end up hurting you be it saying something without meaning it or simply by you trying to protect me. I'm not good for you, Cas.”
“No, I thought he was already at the bunker with you.” Sam spoke softly and Dean knew that tone all too well.
“You may think that falling is the greatest punishment that could have happened to me, but Dean, it was the best decision I could have made.” Cas’ voice was soft and sincere. The eyes of the Angel seemed desperate to get every word into Dean's brain and make him understand.
Sam had stood up and rounded the table to get a better look at the now opened locket that lay on the floor. A small linen sachet had fallen out and little bits of dried flowers covered the floor around it.
The door opened and Cas stood in front of his bed. Dean averted his gaze. He could not look him in the eyes. Not now.
Dean raised his brows. It seemed as if Cas wanted to add something, but he remained silent. He simply looked at him again.
Cas touched his shoulder again. Dean gulped and against his better judgment, turned to look at the Angel standing next to him. They simply looked at each other without saying a word. And Dean really should be used to this by now. Dean could swear there were lines on Cas’ face he hadn't seen before. He didn't want to know if the Angel was actually aging now or not. What good would it do? But his eyes, those blue eyes that had looked at Dean with genuine curiosity from the start - as though he could look right into his soul - were focused on him yet again. And Dean not once minded it. Until now.
“Dean, look at me.” Cas put his hands on Dean's shoulders to steady him, but they were pushed roughly away.
Dean slowly went back to his room and closed the door. He soon found his phone and a message from Sam lit up his screen.
It was a discussion they’ve continuously had for the last couple of days. And Dean knew they had to sort through everything eventually, of course, but a few days of doing nothing could not hurt.
. I can't do that again.” He looked at the Angel and knew that Cas couldn't follow his train of thought.
“Sam, just spill it.” Dean ran a hand through his hair in frustration and braced himself for what would come next. He heard Sam clear his throat before speaking.
The last part was nothing more than a quiet whisper. Dean smiled sadly at the Angel who had not moved from his spot on the mattress. And even though everything hurt, his heart began to feel lighter.
It was as if the walls were closing in on him. Dean stared with wide eyes at his phone, a ringing filling his ears.
Cas raised his hands defensively as he approached him, as if Dean was an animal, he could scare away with one wrong move. Those blue eyes never left his, not even when he stood right in front of him.
Dean wanted to believe him. He really did. But he felt sick to his stomach at the possibility alone.
“It's just…” Dean swallowed. He could not get out of this situation unless he was honest, right? No tricks, no back door to escape through.
“I think it is an honesty spell, Dean. That's why you can't control what you say, and it does match the inscription.”
“You familiar with that?” If Dean’s voice was higher than usual, then Cas thankfully did not mention it.
The chaos in his head had been replaced by deafening silence. He felt empty. His emotions were now numbed, his heart beating in a steady rhythm. The only thing that could ground him. He took a steadying breath and started to slowly make his way back through the hallway. Dean found the kitchen empty as well. No sign of Cas or even Sam.
So Cas had still tried to help Dean after his outburst. His heart felt lighter at the thought but worry spread through him when his brain finally caught up with Sam's words.
“I, I mean I'm…” He couldn't say it. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't say he was fine. He shook his head and looked from Cas to the locket and then back to Cas again, in hopes the Angel could solve whatever was going on.
“We're going to figure this out.” Cas’ voice was calm now and controlled. It didn't make Dean feel better in the slightest. And when Cas touched his shoulder, where the handprint once was, Dean sucked in a surprised breath. Warmth spread through him, and his skin tingled underneath the strong hand that held his arm in a supportive gesture. But Dean knew right then and there that he was fucked.
Dean sighed loudly, already regretting stepping foot into this room. He plopped down on a chair and looked at what was lying ahead of them. He glanced at the bookshelf that stood almost empty against the wall and then at the piles of books right in front of them.
Dean could hear the sadness in his voice. His heart was hammering in his chest as Dean made up his mind. He was not going to hurt him again.
“This is how you feel?” Cas’ voice sounded pained as he slowly stood and made his way toward Dean. Dean bravely stood still and met his eyes.
“What are you doing?” His voice was barely a whisper and Dean could not help it when his eyes wandered over Cas’ frame. The dark blue suit hugged his shoulders and complemented his eyes. The suit pants stretched over strong thighs and revealed a bit of skin around his ankles. Dean felt like he witnessed something entirely forbidden.
“Ok so I won’t meddle for a long time, but seriously…” She was ushering him to the door, more than slightly shoving him along, “...just go kiss the boy already.”
In no time at all, Cas was sliding into the bed next to a very naked and aroused Dean. Cas hummed as he leaned forward and started to nibble at Dean’s neck, pulling their bodies flush together, hard pricks rubbing enticingly against each other. Harsh panting and moaning was all that could be heard in the room as they explored each other’s bodies.
“Please. And I am actually the Queen, and not for some fictional land. Dean won’t stop texting and mopping about you shutting him out. Look, see…” She flipped her phone to him to let him read through a series of texts she had received from Dean over the last couple days.
He had called Gabe the night before to let him know what was going on. Though he was upset by his parents’ behavior, Gabe wasn’t surprised. He had even offered to drive down and help him move but Cas begged him not to. He wanted to be able to ask for his help in the future if need be and besides, Dean was there to help him in the meantime.
Sam laughed. “Seriously Dean? Mom got brand new batteries and cleared the memory on her camera just so she could take a million pictures of this tonight.”
It was quiet for a heartbeat too long. His mother was glancing back and forth between Cas and Dean as if she was finally putting all the puzzle pieces together. Once they clicked into place, you could visually see the change on her face take over. Puzzlement became anger in a split second.
“Oh shut it.” He had a smile on his face as he pushed himself up from the bed, grabbing Cas’ hand and pulling him up too.
Dean was annoyed. No, that wasn’t quite right. Dean was mad, furious even, and tiny bit hurt. Okay, maybe a lot hurt. It had been almost three weeks since Dean caught his hot new neighbor red-handed, stroking it with him in the building next door. Three weeks since Dean laid it all on the line and invited Castiel to come over the next day.
Cas shifted as he pulled his mouth from Dean’s, leaning down to mouth at his neck, his chest and slowly over each sensitive nipple. He was hoping this would lead to where all indications showed it would. He moaned loudly as Cas took to lightly biting his nipple as he dragged his hand down his body, cupping him finally and giving his neglected cock some much needed attention.
“Fine, now that we are not going to be able to hear him read from one of his books, can I please go home?” Dean knew it was an immediate no the second that both girls crossed their arms and stared at him, one eyebrow rising on each of their faces. “You know, it is really rather disturbing when you two do that. It’s like you’re completely in sync with each other.”
Several people around them laughed, clearly listening in on their conversation. “I don’t think so. I couldn’t find anything on a Jimmy Novak, just his books and what little news articles and information that’s out there via his publisher - so definitely an alias.”
Cas felt the shudder run down Deans spine in tandem with the deep groan vibrating through him. Dean was close, too close. He pulled back, blindly reaching for the dropped condom on the bed.
He sat down on one end of her couch and motioned to the other side to get her to sit down. He just wanted to get this over with, whatever this was, so he could go home. He was getting over a cold and had been miserable for the last few days but they were so shorthanded at work and he had no sick time available. Simply put – he was exhausted and irritable.
“I want.” Dean pulled him in, capturing his mouth with his own, kissing him intently to let him know that Cas was not the only one feeling as if this thing between them could be so much more than they thought – if only they would let it. “Come on…let’s go shower and clean up. I want to take you to get the best burgers in town and introduce you to a few more friends of mine.”
“Just a new guy by the name of Samandiriel, but you are trying to change the subject, and that isn’t going to work.” Balthazar sat forward and pointed his finger at Cas like he was scolding him. “Look, I know that you are tired of hearing me hound you about this, but for the last month it’s all you can talk about – even though you swore the first time was a one-time only thing and that you only told me to make sure you don’t do it again. Fuck that, he left his blinds open and he does know you can see in because of that wave.”
Sam and Eileen had been making themselves scarce. Not because Dean or Cas had said something to them, nor hopefully because they made them uncomfortable or anything, but because they were in their own little honeymoon stage. Sam had come to Dean earlier that day to let him know that Eileen and him were going away for a couple days and to not call Sam about anything unless they found a way to Mom, or the world was actually ending, and Dean and Cas couldn’t handle it themselves.
The room filled with the sounds of Cas humming, licking and swallowing down Deans cock. He took extra time to lick the slit at the top hoping it would cause Dean to moan deep and low. He quickly learned that when he used his hand and mouth in conjunction together quick and fast, Dean’s hips would try to follow the movement and his breathing would get shallow and fast as if he was running in a marathon. And if he used just his hand and teasingly breathed on his cock without actually putting his mouth on it, Dean would whimper low in his throat as if begging Cas to go faster, to touch him, to lick him; to basically do anything to him. He couldn’t decide which sound he liked best. He couldn’t wait to catalog them all.
Clearing his throat, Dean turned towards the girls who were watching them with evident scrutiny. "Um Cas, I would like to introduce you to my two best friends, Jo,” he pointed to the blond and then motioning to the red head, “and her girlfriend Charlie. Girls, this is my neighbor Castiel, who you apparently know as Jimmy Novak."
angel. As lame and clichéd as that sounded, he was truly an angel. He arrived and saved him from himself. But it was Angel’s place to tell him who he was, not Sam’s. Dean sat back down in his chair and cleared his throat, “I don’t think I want to know who you think it is.”
Clapping Cas on the shoulders, Dean steered him away from the scene and down the hall towards the kitchen. “Come on man, let’s give them some privacy.”
Deans other hand found its way to his ass, pulling Cas in tighter as Dean tried to roll his hips in tandem with his own. Deans breathing was becoming labored as he got closer to coming. Cas pulled away slightly so he could bite at Deans neck. It was obvious that he really enjoyed that. “Yes Dean, come for me. Let me see up close in person what I watch you do many lonely nights at home. Let me see you…”
each other. They had both said something to the idea of wanting to tell their parents just so they could see the look on their faces. Dean had said that it was almost worth it for the look on his dads face. Sometimes Cas wishes he could have seen it. But here was his chance. He could tell his mom, seal his fate, and have the strength of his boyfriend at his side. He didn’t honestly know if he could be so brave without his support.
They had been tracking this creature for the better part of three weeks. Sam had come to him in the bunker with a news article about a boy getting drafted to the Yankees at the age of fourteen even though legally he couldn’t play until he was seventeen. Once they started digging, they found all kinds of odd occurrences happening every five years during the month of June, dating back almost 150 years. Even the Men of Letters had records of all the odd happenings - lottery winnings, children born to barren parents, kids getting their own candy stores – but also some decidedly less fun things happening as well. People suddenly dying from all kinds of situations, which is why they were taking this so seriously.
Dean never claimed to be the smartest man alive, but it couldn’t be any more obvious that things had seriously changed since their run in with the Jinn creature. He couldn’t shake the feeling as if the creature had seen down to his very soul and knew things that Dean didn’t want anyone to know. Things he had only just barely acknowledged himself. And the really disconcerting fact was the Jinn’s line about Cas. He only wanted one thing and apparently it was the same thing Dean wanted. All the evil in the world to go away? Hell, that was hands-down the first thing Dean had thought about. No more monster hunting. No more Heaven verses Hell verses them. No more losing the many, many, many loved ones, friends, and family to this life.
When Dean finished his tirade, he turned to look at Cas. He was sure he was looking at Dean with a gob smacked dazed expression. That was the first time anyone had stood up like that for him and couldn’t stop himself. He gently grabbed Deans face and planted a resounding kiss on his lips – right in front of his mom. He didn’t care anymore. And Dean deserved to know in this moment how much he had just changed Cas to the core.
His meaning could not have been more clear. Cas had to look down and away from his prying eyes, in order to try and hide his reddening face. Within a matter of minutes the girls had gather their belongings, with quick hugs and drawn out goodbyes - they were suddenly and blissfully alone.
“One question though.” Sam turned and looked back at Dean. “Without giving too much away, how did you figure out who he was?”
Cas was lying in bed as he read Gabe’s text messages and had actually dropped his phone on his face with that last message.
He had been attracted to Cas since the very first moment in the barn all those years ago. How could he not when Cas had those crystal clear blue eyes, sex hair and a voice that Dean wanted to hear on repeat in the bedroom? And with his damn near unwavering loyalty to them, his friendship, and his obvious love for them had done nothing to stop Dean from developing feelings.
He had to stop himself from gasping loudly at what the drawer contained. Old faithful was sitting right there on top, but surrounding it was what Cas was sure was half a porn shop of different types and sizes of toys. He couldn’t wait to try them all. “My, my, Dean….look what we have here, quite a little collection you have huh? Imagine all the things we could do with these…” He had to peruse through half the drawer to find what he was looking for.
He was just sitting there with a shy smile on his face as he looked up at Charlie who was standing in front of him, energy overflowing as she bounced in place while he signed her book. “I am such a huge fan…” He could hear Charlie talking to him but it was like it was all in a tunnel until suddenly everything snapped into focus.
Dean was sitting at his desk in his room, attempting to do homework when Angel’s email came in. He couldn’t help but to agree with him about all of it. He had just opened up an email to respond to him when Sam knocked on his door.
“Dude. My mom is the artist and that man?” He hooked his thumb over his shoulder, pointing to the painting behind him without looking at it again. “That’s probably my dad.”
With a quick shared kiss in the car, Dean grabbed up his stuff and got out. “Ok, we should sign in. Are you nervous?”
He slammed his laptop shut and stalked off to the kitchen. It was too late to accomplish anything more on it tonight and he just needed some sleep and a clear head. Perhaps tomorrow he would have a new perspective on it. Without turning on any lights to blind his tired eyes, he managed to get into the kitchen and grab a beer from the fridge. He knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep until he got a chance to unwind a bit, so a beer and maybe a rerun of Law and Order would make him drowsy enough. But the best laid plans don’t always come to fruition. As he walked past his half open curtains he got a glimpse of Dean in his living room, partially lit by the light coming from his TV screen.
There was no mistaking the image on the TV in the neighboring apartment. Dean was watching, and by the looks of it, thoroughly enjoying gay porn.  Cas watch in rapture as Dean bit his lip and sped up his stroking. He leaned forward a bit as his other hand reached to the floor to grab something Cas couldn’t see. As if he was presenting it specifically for Cas to view, Dean produced a large gray dildo.
Cas was quiet for so long that Dean was ready to get up, throw on the first thing he could find, get in the Impala and flee. He was terrified that somehow that creature had made Cas do this against his will, despite what the Jinn had said.
“I was unaware that you were bringing someone into my house.” She planted her hands on her hips in her authoritative way of trying to be the "bigger person". She had started doing that as soon as him and Gabe were taller than her.
Dean wound his hand its Cas’ hair, holding on for dear life as he tried to keep his eyes open to memorize the way Cas looked as he worshiped him. “Cas… Cas…” he moaned, “if you keep this up I’m not going to last.”
Since Cas moved out they had been more open with each other in public. They hadn’t held hands or kissed in front of anyone at school or anything, but Dean always rode to and from school with him now. And any time they were together outside of class, they were side by side. With school almost out, and now literally out, they didn’t see any reason to really hide anymore. They had both faced their worst fears – their parents – and had come out on the other side relatively ok. They were more confident in themselves and were prepared to face the realities of the world. In fact, tonight was their last night in the closet. They had decided together to end their high school career by being open about themselves. Hopefully, if there was anyone else scared and in the closet, they could let them know that they weren’t the only ones and they had support out there.
“No buts Castiel! You only come out into the world if I or your brother drags you out - or if you have to for your books. And while being a homebody suits you perfectly, you need to get laid too.” Balthazar’s voice had risen by this point and Cas was beat red in the face.
“That’s definitely a dick.” The man beside him whispered and Cas couldn’t contain the bark of laughter that escaped out from himself at the man’s very poignant comment. Unfortunately, it was so quiet in the gallery that his laughter was loud and seemed to echo throughout. It was only then that the guy seemed to realize he wasn’t alone while looking at the painting.
“Hey Sam?” Dean came downstairs in his nice slacks and button up shirt, tie and all. It all made him feel a little claustrophobic to be dressed up but he knew it was just for tonight. Sam was sitting on the couch, close to his girlfriend as she was teaching him sign language. Every time Sam seemed to mess up, Eileen would laugh, grab his hands and try to arrange them into the proper form. Dean thought, given the smile on Sam’s face, that he was purposely messing up a few times just so Eileen would do this. He moved himself into the line of sight, catching both their attentions.
He just hoped that the comments the Jinn made were in reference to these feelings, not some unknown other thing.
Dean laughed. “Sure man, if that’s what you want to do. I’m gonna go change and get comfortable, be back in five.”
“Forgot his eyes, look at his smile!” Jo whispered back. Dean’s head snapped up to see what all the fuss was about. His breath caught and it took him an absurdly long amount of time to take another breath. It was him. His ridiculously hot neighbor.
“So…what’s with the cryptic text?” She ran her hands through her hair and avoided eye contact with him. It was obvious she was nervous about something but, as she had said earlier, two plus two was not equaling four here and he was so very confused. “Come on Charlie, whatever it is, you can tell me. Your secret is safe with me.”
“And you don’t think you deserve good things, is that?” Cas had sat up too, unexpectedly sounding angry. He reached forward, a hand on each side of Dean’s face, pulling his head up to be able to look him directly in the eyes. “You do Dean. You deserve to be happy, to have something good for yourself, whatever that may be. The world, every other alternate world out there, Heaven, Hell, myself included, owe you more than we can ever hope to repay you for the life you have chosen to live. So when there is something within your grasp that would make this life more bearable and worth living – take it.”
That’s why Cas was currently hating himself and his very new, very unhealthy obsession. It started purely by accident, as most things do. It was late at night – far later than he realized since he had gotten wrapped up in reading a new book – when he finally decided to get up and turn off the lights and close the curtains for the night. It wasn’t the first time he had gone to close the curtains and had seen directly into the homes of his new neighbors. One living room was perpetually dark and he guessed that nobody actually lived there. The other had a nice older lady in it that reminded him of his grandmother, cats and all, who clearly went to bed by 7pm. But the third living room? The one that always left his blinds half open? He was very tempting to watch, despite his normal aversion to “people watching”.
“Cas…” Dean croaked out. His eyes shot to Dean, almost like he was afraid of being caught looking. If you later asked Dean who moved first, he honestly wouldn’t be able to tell you. He thinks it was probably himself. The tether between the two of them, keeping them constantly in orbit of one another of the last couple weeks, finally yanked them together in a clash of hands and lips. Cas pushed him back on the couch, wasting no time with climbing into his lap as Dean pulled him closer, hands burying themselves in his hair, finally getting a chance to yank on it. Which was apparently the right thing to do because it caused Cas to let out an ungodly loud moan. He was suddenly extremely happy that Sam was not around to hear or witness this.
“Anyhow, when Dean moved in with you, I noticed an immediate change in his behavior. You only know the Dean that lives with you. He’s always been open and tactile with you right?” He nodded. “Well Dean before he moved in with you was rather closed off and hesitant, with almost everyone except with Sam and me. After seeing him interacting with you and you being all moony eyed over him – I just assumed that you guys were secretly dating and that you guys would let us all in on the news when you felt comfortable with it. I thought, rather erroneously now, that you were keeping it a secret because of Daddy Winchester.”
“Oh fuck…” Dean sighed as Cas bit down on his neck while his hips continued to move at a torturous speed. “If you don’t want this to end like were 15 again and not in our thirty’s, you better stop.”
“Moping is what you are.” She lightly punched his shoulder. “That’s why I invited you out to this with me-”
Slowly he lifted his hands and cupped Deans face. It felt like his heart was going to beat out of his chest. “Dean…” He whispered but, in the end, he didn’t couldn’t tell you for sure if he leaned forward first or if Dean did. They were trading kisses between smiles while stumbling towards the bedrooms, laughing as they tripped and slipped while shedding their clothing. Cas was happy it was Friday – they could spend the rest of the weekend making up for lost time.
“That last one was sent right before I asked you to stop by. I haven’t answered him – I had to talk to you first. I had to apologize for being a complete utter bitch. I wanted to ogle pretty girls with my best friend, but my best friend just wanted to make heart eyes with you. I shouldn’t have gotten between you two. I was drunk and being stupid. It’s not an excuse, but the truth. I should not have taken his phone and texted you. I am so so sorry.” There were tears running down her face as she reached out and grabbed back her phone. Her fingers flew across the screen.
Dean barely had time to register his movements as Cas dropped the bottle of lube and the condom by his hip and ducked down, immediately engulfing his cock. “Oh f-f-f…uck Cas. A little warning next time.”
“Now…I have answered him. I told him that all will be well. I know, I know, cryptic again. But you are going to march your happy ass home and talk to him. Like adults. Clear the air and lock yourselves away for the weekend. Bump uglies and be all happy joy joy with each other. Tell him what I did, its my fault for this hiccup between you two. I’ll never stick my nose back in where it isn’t wanted again.”
She took a shaky breath, swiped away a tear, and held her hands up as she took a step closer to Dean while glancing at Sam and then leveling Dean with a solemn stare. “I don’t know.” She took another breath, glanced over at Sam who was still kneeling. Sam was unable to believe it was really her but wanted more than anything for her to actually be real, that she had come back to him much like Cas came back to Dean. “All I know,” she continued, “is that I died from that Hellhound attack in South Carolina. I woke up in this beautiful cottage somewhere in Ireland. It was so peaceful that I knew it had to be Heaven. I don’t know how long I was there, but I heard this rustle behind me one morning, and this beautiful creature-man-thing, I don’t know what he was, but he touched my shoulder and said, ‘Your destiny is not this, not yet,’ and I awoke in that same forest in South Carolina.” Dean lowered his gun slightly. “It took me a while to get my bearings but I didn’t know where else to go. Do your tests, please, make sure I am human, because I don’t want to hurt anyone.”
“NO NO NO WAIT!” Dean yelled as he stood up quickly and started pacing the room. Did he actually want to know? The moment of truth. What if Angel was…..what if Angel was what? Angel was
“Dean, don’t be a spoil sport. I want you to come see this author and hear his work. Then maybe, just maybe, I can finally get you to read the series.”
“-you need to get out of your apartment and out of the auto shop. Man does not live on porn and cars alone, you know?”
As Dean resumed his tortuously slow stroking, Cas slowed his to match. He didn’t want this to be over too quick. He wanted to savor this moment, make it last, come with Dean and then put this memory into a safe place where he would review it for years to come. His breathing had become harsh as he desperately tried to keep tempo with Dean. It was getting difficult watching such an erotic scene with the man of his dreams as he rocked down into his hand holding the dildo, pumping it energetically while his other hand stroked his perfect cock. His eyes rolled back as he increased his speed to keep up with Dean. It felt dangerously good and he was so very close that before he knew it, he was coming into his pants and stomach, groaning loudly enough that had he shared walls with neighbors they would surely be upset.
“Yeah…” The stranger looked relieved, “My mom told me that a few of her new works were going up this week here. I come see them every time. I thought she was only doing like trees and shit. Not my dad in all his glory!” He laughed awkwardly.
He sat in silence for a moment wondering what to say. “Sooo…” His voice cracked slightly, “What you are saying is that you thought we were dating and that prompted you to send me that text?”
“You can have this one, on the house.” He quickly wrote a few sentences in the book and then passed it across the table to Dean. His smile was brilliant, and as their hands touched he felt a spark travel up his arm and then down his spine. He was so fucked. Between his eyes which were so much bluer up close, his voice and the undeniable chemistry he felt – there was no way that this could end well. “I think Dean, that you will enjoy this book immensely.” The cat clearly had his tongue as all he could do was smile and give a small wave goodbye as Cas called out a fair well.
“So, how did you two meet?” Dean had just sat a beer down in front of him as the redhead asked her question. His and Deans relationship was already a few months in when they were finally able to get everyone’s schedules to match up so they could meet. So here they were at a bar with Charlie, Benny, Jo, Garth, his brother Sam and his wife Eileen.
echoed around the table. “Good, because we’re moving in together and could use your help.” So what if they were moving a little fast? To them it almost didn’t feel fast enough. When you know, you just know.
“Ah ah ah…no Dean”. Cas said as he pushed Deans hand away from his own cock as he slowly stroked it while he watched as Cas generously apply lube to himself. With his none lubed hand, Cas grabbed one of the pillows and stuffed it under Deans hips.
“Uh, Dean….” Sam pushed into his room, shutting the door behind him and shuffling over to the bed. He looked nervous.
The day he moved in he met Dean, literally running into him on the sidewalk as him, Balthazar and Gabe were moving him in. He was charming, surely, though Cas could only pay attention to the smirk of his lips, the deep green of his eyes and the smattering of freckles on his nose. Bal and his brother had carried the conversation, and with those two, who knows what was actually said. He managed to miss 95% of it. It took two weeks before Balthazar and Gabe would let up with the teasing about him being in a trance at meeting Dean. But Cas had not ran into him since, besides a quick wave two weeks ago across the 20 foot span between buildings one night when Dean was walking over to his couch and Cas was shutting his curtains.
Things are going to start getting heavy. Homophobic behavior, slurs, etc etc. I don't think like I write, just FYI. I am gay myself, and writing a gay story obviously, soooo....heads up. This chapter is the kick off for some bullshit conduct. But all in all I prefer to write HEA/ "this aint how the world actually is but wouldn't it be nice" type stories so yeahhh
This could all end tomorrow. That’s one of the main reasons Dean didn’t ever pursue anything – he was too afraid that this life he lived would take anyone or anything he loved, like it had already done, many times over. But in this moment he knew as corny as it may sound, wishes did occasionally come true, thanks to the Jinn, and that Winchesters can have happy endings too. They just had to make sure they took them when they could. “I love you too Cas.”
“Dean…” Cas whispered as he pulled back. They were panting, faces only inches away from each other as if it just dawned on them what they had done. And then Cas cautiously rolled his hips, dragging his own hard cock against Dean’s and he no longer gave a fuck about hiding how he was feeling. He grabbed ahold of his hips and urged him to do it again. Cas just quietly moaned as he leaned in to start mouthing on Dean’s neck, kissing and lightly biting a path from his shoulder to his ear. He sucked on Dean’s earlobe, causing Dean’s hips to stutter off the couch and up into Cas, broken moan echoing through the room. “Would you…” Cas managed between to get out between dragging his mouth back to Dean’s, “…would you… uh… like to move this to your room by chance?”
“Oh Dean, you’re back!” Charlie snatched the coffee out of his hands and whipped back around to glance off into the crowd, jumping up and down trying to get a better view. The place was packed with people. Dean didn’t think this many people ever came to this small local bookshop, let alone all on one day. “Can you see him Dean? Is he as pretty as the people online say he is?”
"I don't mind Dean; it's rather flattering to see my works get so much love. I never get to interact much with the fans."
“Yes. That’s why there is huge speculation of an upcoming TV series and more books, because he has been touring the country for the last couple weeks doing signings in small bookshops here and there. They only announce the bookshop he will be at like a day beforehand, and nobody has been able to get a clear picture of him yet.”
“Man, that’s so creepy. You sound just like her.” Charlie smirked at Dean. “Fine.  I will stay, but I am going over to that coffee shop down the street to get a coffee. I’ll be back.”
He couldn’t breathe. He had to be dreaming as he watched Dean as he paused in his stroking to crack open a bottle of lube and coat the toy and himself. Once Dean got resituated with his feet on the coffee table, legs spread and hands once again disappearing between his legs – Cas couldn’t take it any longer. He moaned loudly once he had stuffed his hand into his sweats, taking himself in hand. His other hand smoothed over his naked chest to pinch at his own nipple. He had to bite his lip to keep from groaning any louder, not like he had neighbors that could hear him. But since he could faintly hear Deans TV through his cracked window, there was always that chance that he could hear him in return.
“Well, I know I invited you over to join in but I feel I should have taken you on a date first. Charlie is gonna give me hell that I didn’t court you or some shit.” Cas leaned over and kissed him, pushing everything he was feeling from that days emotional high forward. “Mmm, what was that for?”
“This is your gay friend you talked about isn’t it Castiel?” Her voice hissed. It was a damn good impression of a snake if Deans almost snort of laughter behind him was any indication. Plus, Cas couldn’t help but think, how many times in history has someone used the phrase “I have a friend that…” and actually meant themselves? Was his mother really that dense?
“Yes.” She jumped up off the couch and walked into the kitchen, returning mere seconds later with her phone in her hand. “You see, I was of course with Dean the entire trip to Vegas so I was privy to the fact that you guys were texting each other
“Well, I am nervous…b-because I don’t know how to say this or how you will react, or… I don’t even know if I am right, but it feels like I am, so I came to you because you should know….”
“And some girl on girl…” Cas interjected, because yeah, he couldn’t help himself. He had now seen no less than a dozen times that Dean had masturbated on the couch in his living room in the past month, and each time there was a different video on the TV. If he didn’t know any better, he would think that he was putting on a show for him. He was the only occupant on the top floor, the only one that could actually see into his living room. Perhaps he had gotten too use to the condo being empty and not having to worry about spying meddlesome neighbors. But it would be a cold day in hell before he admitted to Bal that after each time spying on Dean, he had to quickly run to his room and get himself off. It was the most active sex life he had had in years, if it even counted as one.
“Hi hi, sorry I’m late. Lunch hour was slammed, and I was just barely able to get out of there to meet with you guys.” Jo slid into the line with them, hugging Charlie and giving her a quick kiss as the queue of people slowly progressed further down the street. At this rate it would be closing time before they ever made it inside to meet their so called ‘favorite author’.
"Whoa whoa whoa Charlie," Dean broke in, "No fangirling. No theories. He isn't your ‘message board’ to ‘bounce ideas off of’ for your next ‘whatever’."
Usually Dean liked when the creatures got cocky and decided to do a speech like this, it would give him more time to free himself and fight back. But his voice was hypnotic. Even Cas was devoting his attention to the words.
Laying in Dean’s bed, after cleaning up, they were now awkwardly avoiding each other’s eyes. Dean stammered and asked, “So….I have to know….” Cas looked away from where he was studying the ceiling to Dean’s red face, suddenly shy “Was this all because… you know… because of that Jinn creature?”
Dean held still while Bobby performed a number of tests on him.  Cutting him with silver, dousing him with holy water, the whole gamut.  It was when Bobby started mumbling about finding some lamb’s blood that Sam had finally had enough.
Dean leaned forward and gently pressed his lips against his brother’s forehead, between his brows.  “I love you, Sammy.  Be good.”
“Come on, let’s get going.  I’ll even let you play with the dials on the radio on the way to the hospital!”  Dean said with false cheer.
Cas inclined his head politely and Dean threw a fist in the air in joy.  “Hell yeah!” He shouted and immediately pulled out his duffel from under the bed.  It was already packed and looked as if it had been prepared days ago (which it had).  Cas was glad to see how cheerful his human looked.  It had filled his chest with an uncomfortable pain to see him struggling recently.  He was happy he was able to do this one thing for him.  And though Dean didn’t know it, he would get to go home permanently in just a few short months.  Cas ignored the fact that that thought brought back the pain in his chest.
“Personal space?”  Dean said in exasperation.  He threw out a hand to emphasize his point, the other had a death grip on the corners of the towel around his hips.
Sam had been silent while the two had had their moment but he stepped in eagerly now in an attempt to fill the silence.  “So!  Where have you been?”
He took a single glance backward and spared a thought for his brother and the patchwork family he’d left behind.  They’d be alright, and Sammy would get to live the life he deserved now.
Dean rolled his eyes. Maybe it was an alien? It definitely sounded like it was from another planet. “Yeah, I mean, I'm sure you can see me. It’s only fair, right?”
Thunder rumbled in the distance and Dean was disturbed to note lightning on the horizon.  What the hell, was Cas doing this?
“S-sure thing, Cas.”  He mumbled quickly.  If he had needed a reminder of the bird’s power, that had been more than effective.
Cas blinked at him, startled at his suggestion.  If he were human, he likely would have blushed, but thankfully he was covered in feathers and any physical signs of embarrassment were hidden from Dean.  Cas merely nodded in acknowledgement and encouraged Dean to head back down the hallway towards the kitchen.
She pinned him with a hard stare. “Hold on, sugar.” She frowned at the paperwork in her hand before comparing it to the readouts on the large monitors on either side of Sam's bed. She chewed her lower lip thoughtfully before closing the chart and placing it gently near Sam's feet.
Eventually, he had the idea to stop by the courtyard.  He turned down a hallway and meandered easily towards the wide courtyard in what he assumed was the center of the mansion.  He realized it had been a good guess when he passed a window facing into the sunlit area.  He could see Cas standing in the center of the circular open-air room, with both his wings stretched out as far they could go.  It was an impressive sight and Dean paused to marvel at the sheer size of the bird.
“Do you already have a pile for things we're probably gonna toss in the trash?” Dean waved the book around as he spoke and searched the floor for a pile that looked like only a trash can label was missing.
“There are too many thoughts in my head. And I'm scared.” Cas eyes widened, and his hand reached for Dean again, but the latter stepped back to create a distance between them.
“You are not responsible for my decisions, Dean. And falling is something I decided to do. And I am here. With you. Because I want to.”
“I'm gonna go to my room.” He announced and when Dean heard footsteps following him, he added: “Alone.”
Dean had wanted to apologize on his own terms, but this? It was his very own tragedy and the spotlight tauntingly followed him.
Dean did not even remember how the call had ended when he sat there on his bed. Phone still pressed against his cheek as if he might get another explanation the longer he stared into his wall.
"Ok Charlie, calm down," Dean guffawed as he moved out of the kitchen and approached him. "Hey Cas....um...thanks for coming...sorry for the audience."
However, the last thing they were expecting to see as they pulled up in front of the bunker was a tiny beat up black car that had clearly seen better days. Dean stopped the car in a hurry as they all quickly filed out with guns drawn. There really weren’t many people left in their lives that knew the location of the bunker, nor would they show up unannounced.
Smirking, Dean looked up at Charlie and Jo. “Sooo…. do you guys remember me telling you about my new ridiculously hot neighbor who has a bit of a voyeuristic fetish?”
Moving on to the last painting in the room to view, he came to stand next to man. A very attractive man if Cas was being honest with himself. He didn’t fit the stereotypical art lover, to Cas he looked like he would be more comfortable in an auto shop than an art gallery. Said stranger stood slightly bowlegged in rough worn jeans and a flannel shirt over a black t-shirt, but what really stood out to Cas, even in the low light of the room, was the smattering of freckles across his face.
He groaned. Dean was beautiful as he lay back on his couch, naked as the day he was born, slowly stroking himself while he watched the TV. Granted, it was straight porn, and definitely not Cas’ cup of tea, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Dean anyway. And he really should have. He shouldn’t be watching his very attractive neighbor in an entirely intimate private moment. Yet, he did. He watched every flick of his wrist as it stroked up and down his perfect cock. He watched as his other hand would occasionally trail from his chest down to his balls and back. He was fascinated as Dean switched hands to continue stroking with his left hand, then back to his right again. He must be ambidextrous and all Cas could think was how he would love nothing more than to have those hands on him too. He was painfully hard but he would not be that person, the one who fondled himself while spying on his neighbor. It was creepy and wrong but man did he want to.
“That’s all we ask Dean.” Jo was eying him with satisfaction. She was his rock. She was steady and always able to get him to slowly step out of his comfort zone to see the possibilities of things. Whereas Charlie was like a wrecking ball and just liked to knock him over and drag him into things. He loved them both so much. “However…” Jo hesitated. “When I was passing the line by the entrance, I heard some people say that only the first 100 people were going to be allowed to stay for a reading.”
The creature peered down at Sam. “Ah yes, the scholar of the three…. yes… I see, I see it all. What is in your mind, what is in your heart, I grant. I mean no unnecessary harm, unlike my brotherly kin. Your wishes and your body are the way that he feeds. I have developed into being able to live differently. Where he lives off of dreams, I live off of reality.”
Cas laughed, “Give me one good reason why I should stop…” he punctuated each word with a slight nibble on his neck and a corresponding thrust of his hips.
She laughed. “Ok…sooo that text was meant for you.” It was so quiet in her house he could hear the clock ticking in the kitchen.
“Jo!” Charlie practically screeched in his ear. Coming down the sidewalk was his other best friend. He met Jo when he was just a kid. Her mom had married his pseudo-uncle Bobby who was his dad's best friend from his days back in the military. They ended up growing up together, were each other’s first kiss, and ended up coming out to each other and then their families, together. When he met Charlie, when she brought her car into his shop to get fixed, he knew right away they would hit it off, so he introduced them. That was almost ten years ago now, and they’ve been attached at the hip since.
“Actually mother, I was talking about myself, but trying not to say the actual words. But since you can’t read between the lines I will actually say the words now. I am gay and this is my boyfriend who I love with all my heart.” He was having a hard time keeping his words steady. Dean’s hand squeezed his reassuringly. “Your life and my life are no longer going down the same path and I need to go because I should be able to hold his hand all the time but instead I am holding onto shame and I shouldn’t be. Love is not shameful and I won’t let you try to change that for me.”
The door in front of him whipped open and a short blonde woman he vaguely recognized from earlier was standing there. She smiled at him nervously, "please, why don't you come in." As he said his thanks and followed her into the apartment, he finally got to see firsthand what the inside of Dean's apartment looked like, instead of what little he could see from his own condo window. It was obviously a bachelor pad much like his own, but it clearly had some feminine touches to it, probably thanks to the two girls. As he turned into the kitchen following the blonde girl he heard a squeak from the redheaded girl sitting on barstool at the counter.
Balthazar gave an undignified snort. “Please.” He took another bit of his croissant and continued, “Just because he gets off to straight porn…"
But this? This was amazing. Cas fit perfectly between his hips, lips attached to his own as he dragged his hands up and down his back. The slow drag of his cock against his own was sweet torture. He didn’t know where this would go, or even if it would go any further than this, but he never wanted it to stop.
you could tell me. Not like I would judge him if he wasn’t the most attractive guy but I’m not gonna lie, I have been extremely curious.”
“You fucking better not stop,” Dean growled out. His hand slid into the slightly curled hair on the top of Cas’ head, directing him to continue to blow him with what was surprisingly an amazingly talented tongue.
“Hey!” Dean yelled at the figure sitting in the front seat. They couldn’t see her face, but as the figure got out of the car, hands held up high, all the blood drained from Sam's face as he fell to his knees. “This is impossible. Eileen?” Dean stepped closer, hands still held high keeping the gun trained on her. He had to be closer so she could read his lips but he wasn’t going to trust that this was her. “How are you alive?”
There was always the ‘but’ that held Dean back. But, he thought selfishly, it would be nice just once to get something he didn’t think he deserved. The one thing that apparently the Jinn granted to Sam. In the days following Eileen’s return, it was quite clear that they had feelings for each other, strong ones. And not only that, but the two days they spent sequestered in Sam’s room meant that they not only acknowledged them, but no doubt acted on them as well.
Cas was barely two steps in his front door before Dean was standing there, suddenly next to him and obviously worried. He had been so preoccupied with his own perceived heartache that he didn’t take the time to really notice how Dean was acting. He could kick himself because Dean was plainly not well.
“It was your freckles,” Cas blurted out, then groaned in embarrassment, dropping his head into his hands.
“Soooo…” Balthazar singsonged as he sat down in the chair across from Cas. They had weekly Saturday brunches together since they had meet six years previously. Brunch had become their thing so that Balthazar could brag about his Friday night escapades and his latest fling while getting through his customary hangover. And Cas, who usually talked about his most recent novel development, could grumble about his neighbors and their lack of decent window coverings. “Have you talked to lover boy yet?” He picked up his coffee cup and gave Cas a look that said ‘get a move on’.
“So, tonight’s the big night…” He paused, trying to find the right words. “Just….um – please be recording or taking pictures when I walk the stage ok?”
It wasn’t every day that Cas came to this museum at lunch. It wasn’t even every week. But whenever he had the spare time at the end of his lunch, Cas would go into the free little museum just down the block from his office building. To be fair, it was more an art gallery than a museum, but they did have a large section in the back of the building dedicated to the local history and artifacts found nearby.
They hung around the neighboring towns of where they happened to find the ‘Jinn’ for two weeks following their meeting. They wanted to make sure that he wouldn’t strike again, but as the days bled into July, all signs that the creature was still around and operating had disappeared. With nothing left holding them there, they began the two day drive back home to the bunker.
Sam laughed. “Yeah, well, I could see it. You two. Together. It would be a good fit. I think you guys probably have more in common than you even realize.”
Charlie; her girlfriend, Jo; his brother Sam, and his wife Jess were the only people that still talked to Dean after the last few dreadful years. Charlie had recently started dragging Dean all over town trying to get him interested in “extracurricular activities that aren’t sex and cars, or sex in cars,” as she put it. So far, he had attended a pottery class which was not as fun as the movie Ghost made it look. Also, he took a cooking class for couples; which was awkward attending with your best friend once he had learned from the instructor that it was a ‘sensual cooking class,’ to learn how to ‘bring the bedroom and the kitchen together in a delightful fusion of passion’.
When Cas entered the museum today it was the large paintings once again. These weren’t as big as the walls, but they were definitely the size of a full-grown man. Last time he was here, there was nothing but sculptures. Some made no sense to him, others were quite the work of art. But todays art – he could say with certainty that he recognized. This same artist had displayed their art work several times over the last year. And there was something about it that drew Cas in. It was abstract, yes. No formal lines or obvious defining subject matter. More than splashes of paint but less than ‘
Dean held up a hand to stop him, still smiling as if Cas hadn’t been watching him get off over the last month. “To be honest, the first time I noticed you there was a little awkward. But apparently, I really like getting off while being watched which makes me the kinky fucker, but you just watched, only ever watched. So I guess it became a challenge for me.” Cas felt like his body was on fire as Deans eyes raked over him. “So I decided to see what I could do to provoke you. To see if you would join. Who knew all I had to do was break out my old faithful toy.” Cas lightly groaned but it was apparently loud enough for Dean to hear. Dean licked his lips and when he spoke again his voice was sinuously low. “How about tomorrow you come join me? Apartment 4A.” He winked before he turned around, shut his window and let his blinds fall down, still partially open. Cas watched Dean as he walked away, openly admiring his ass as he turned off his TV and lights in order to go to bed. Perhaps being a voyeur had its perks.
“In the….oh-h-h” He arched his back, he was getting close. “…the nightstand with the condoms.” Cruelly, Cas broke away from him and leaned over to the drawer, wrenching it open to get inside.
“I will not tolerate this perversion in my family. Consider yourself not my son anymore.” Her icy words washed over Cas, physically knocking him back a step. He knew it was a possibility. He had read others stories online about their parents disowning them after coming out, but he had always held out hope that his parents would just not talk to him except at family functions or holidays. To actually hear the words come out of her mouth was like a kick to the gut.
“Come on brother, you know we want to know even more now.” Benny had a rich Cajun accent, and Cas would never admit it to Dean, but it was a bit of a turn on. He always did have a thing for accents.
Cas took his time here today. He had decided to stop in after getting off work early. It was a Friday, he had no other plans than cooking himself dinner and settling down with a new documentary to watch, but he was glad he decided to stop in. A good 10 to 20 minutes or better was spent looking at each painting on the wall. He lamented to himself once again how he wished he could afford to purchase one of these artworks. It would be displayed in pride of place in his living room. But alas, he wasn’t to the point of being able to afford an extravagant purchase like this. It was a goal – someday.
“Let’s take a break. We need a bit of rest on the research. Maybe we’ll be able to hit the books again tomorrow morning with clear heads.”
Laughing, the guy shook his hand back. “Dean, nice to meet you Cas…ya know, I am pretty sure I have seen you in here before.”
Cas honed in on that word and sat, suspended in disbelief. He was sure that Ramblin didn’t mean to say that. But jock sure narrowed down the pool of people that Ramblin could be a part of. Football, basketball, baseball and soccer. All of them “jocks”. Perhaps Ramblin was on one of the teams? That would definitely explain his comment about ignorant jocks. At their school, what the jocks said and did was the way it was. And it didn’t escape his notice that calling anyone they didn’t like a fag was the “it thing” for those guys to do. Wouldn’t it shock the hell out of them to learn one of their own was pride flag waving member?
Dean snorted and tried not to laugh at her. “Really Charlie? Your girlfriend is standing right here.”
“God yes. More than anything, but not if he isn’t the one to tell me. Or I honestly figure it out on my own.”
“No. I do not take away your free will. I just….heavily encourage events to happen before they would have naturally. But you have the choice to not allow those events to unfold. I am truly at your mercy in this scenario.”
He wouldn’t call himself a connoisseur of art. He couldn’t tell the difference between certain classical artists – no matter how famous they might have been. He knew he enjoyed the art he recognized by Van Gogh and da Vinci - but honestly Cas liked to see the abstract art presented here by local artists. Sometimes the museum/art gallery would have a couple weeks of nothing but pottery on display. Some weeks it would be statues, some weeks small, tiny paintings or drawings as big as your hand, and then some weeks paintings as large as a wall that you could spend hours looking at. One really fun couple of weeks it was all art by a local welder who did sculptures and hanging lamps with scrap metal.
“And when was the last time that happened?” Charlie countered. She knew full well it had been too long, thus the reason she dragged him out everywhere. Like the child Dean was, he stuck out his tongue at her in response.
It took them no time at all to find themselves laid out, divested of clothing, across Dean’s memory foam bed. It had been so long since Dean had found himself in a position like this, he was trying to memorize every moment but he was feeling overwhelmed by the sheer feelings that was involved with this. The first, and only, time he had been with a man he was so concerned with not getting caught and being nervous that he barely got off.
Within weeks of meeting Bal, his creative juices flowed freely and before he knew it, he had outlined an entire series and had a good half his first book written. Luckily he had found a publisher willing to let him hide his identity. Apparently it was more common than he thought in the industry.
“Enlighten me then. I happen to like this artists’ works so far.” He crossed his arms and was fully ready to be a public defender of this piece.
Cas knew when he found this place that he had hit the jackpot. It was perfect. Nice hardwood flooring throughout, several bedrooms – one of which he could turn into his office, and a beautiful open living room and kitchen. The only hiccup, despite it being the top story of a condo building that sat just a little bit higher than the building next door, was his view. It was decent enough, overlooking the town, but he could see down into the living rooms of three apartments of the neighboring building. They were almost eye to eye; his windows sat just a smidge higher up.
“That ‘Jimmy Novak’ author you love so much….” He took a deep breath and ran his hands threw his hair, “I don’t know him by that name. I know him by the name of Cas.”
“Nah man…I should apologize. I…shouldn’t have said that.” His face turned a becoming shade of pink as he blushed at his faux pas.
“Mother.” He could feel Dean at his back, just slightly behind him to the left but carefully not touching him. He wanted to grab his hand for support because he had an overwhelmingly bad feeling.
Thankfully Cas saved him from continuing. “Wait Dean, first please please allow me to apologize.” Cas held up his hand to stop Dean who was about to protest. “No, seriously, I should not have done….what we did…and then just disappear on you after your rather gracious invitation. Believe me; I wanted nothing more than to take you up on it.”
“Dean…” He barely recognized his own voice, “That was the hottest thing you could have done in the moment. Get in the car; we are gonna go find a nice quiet backroad to get lost on. Right. Fucking. Now.”
“But you’re right.” Cas motioned towards the painting at what was obviously, clearly, a penis. They both looked at it and burst into laughter.
Jo nodded her head in agreement with her girlfriend. “Really Dean, Charlie is right. I thought the name and premise was horrible and clichéd too, but because I love my dear girlfriend so much, I gave it a shot and read the first book, and I got hooked too.” Jo leaned over and pecked Charlie quickly on the lips. “It’s really a monumental thing, this series. It’s one of the most popular fantasy series on the market right now and the fact that the main character Credence is gay, plus the inclusivity of all the supporting characters, is a big deal in the industry.”
His orgasm slammed into him and he was unable to stop himself or give Cas any kind of warning. “Fuck fuck fuck,” Dean panted as he came.
“Wait, wait, let me get this right.” Dean looked around him at all the people in the bookshop, “This guy’s books are so popular that he’s on the bestseller lists, but nobody know who he is or what he looks like?”
His heart was pounding out of his chest, and he could feel the flush starting up his neck towards his cheeks as he turned towards Cas. The smirk and the raised eyebrow on Cas’ face clearly said ‘well are you going to or not?’ Stepping up to Cas, he didn’t take the diploma in his hand like everyone else did. No, just like planned, Dean swept Cas up in his arms and in front of the entire school and half the town’s population and  he kissed his boyfriend in happiness.
Cas took the stage and gave his valedictorian speech. Dean had heard it so many times by this point that he kind of zoned out. He was being allowed to stare at his boyfriend in public. They had gotten lucky that their cap and gowns were black this year instead of red, and Cas made the required outfit look good. He had a jubilant look on his face; obvious nervousness about giving this speech had disappeared. His voice was steady and deep and so very hypnotizing. It made Dean flashback on their impromptu rendezvous after moving Cas out where he had taken charge and a submissive side of Dean came out that he didn’t know he had. They were both surprised by the shift in them and that dynamic. Dean couldn’t wait to get some time alone together uninterrupted so they could experiment a little more.
Dean was angry, rather hurt, and a lot embarrassed too, if he was being honest. He came on too strong and wanton, and probably scared the poor guy off for good with his false bravado. But Castiel was hot, and it had been too long since Dean had had any interest in anyone since calling it quits with the disaster that was Abby.
Without answering his mom, Cas reached back and grabbed Deans hand, interlacing their fingers together. Dean took the half a step forward that put him squarely at Cas’ side.
“This is all your fault,” Dean grumbled from the floor. He was pissed. They had all been caught off guard and were currently being held by magic, which had stopped them from moving. Sam knelt on the floor to the left of him, arms bound behind his back like himself. Cas was to his right in the same position – angelic powers be damned against whatever this creature was. Powerful. It was powerful. He thought that they were tracking some kind of wayward crossroad demon but they were unnervingly wrong.
Dean threw back his head, laughing loud enough that several people up ahead looked back at him. Quieting, he whispered back to Cas, “Oh there is some thrusting I’d like to do tonight but it definitely can’t happen out there for the real world to see.” Wiggling his eyebrows at Cas he ducked into the hallway and over to a side door to the auditorium where they were doing staging for all the graduates. All the students with A-M last names were on the left side of the auditorium while N-W were on the right. It just so happened that Dean was the last one that would be called up on stage to get his diploma that evening as weirdly enough, there were no students in their graduating class with last names that started with X,Y or Z.
Looking at Dean, he could see the rage steal over his features instantly. Dean was suddenly yelling before Cas could stop him. “You know what? Parents like you make me sick. When you decide to have children, you’re supposed to love them unconditionally. You’re supposed to support them and cherish them and be there for them! Not kick them to the curb at the first sign of hardship. And God forbid if they grow up to be their own person with their own ideas and deviate from the path you think that they should be on. Newsflash lady, normalcy is just a crowd sourced fantasy. Nobody is normal. What’s that saying your kind always says - God is love?  Being gay is not a perversion; it’s just another way to love. So fuck you. He will always have a family with me and mine. You’re not worthy of him anyways.”
“Without giving too much away?” Dean nodded. “I know his name.” Dean was more confused by this answer than if he hadn’t asked. How did knowing his name lead to knowing he was Angel?
Turning, Cas went to snap the last picture and found Dean, smiling with his arms crossed, leaning against the wall next to his closet doors. Cas took several pictures of him as he stood there.
“No…” he sighed, “And I won’t, Bal, he is obviously straight and since I am buying my condo and have to live there for some time to come, I don’t want to ruffle any feathers. So stop asking.”
Cas laughed, “No, you like anyone and everyone – especially if they call you daddy. Which, by the way, your kink is not my kink and I am perfectly ok with that but, no Bal. Just no. You are one of the few that I have meet that has said, and I quote, ‘I have no preference, I’ll get off with whomever’ and that is just not the standard thing with most people, remember?” Cas took a deep breath trying to put a damper on his rising emotions enough to continue. “Enough. So who was the latest interest last night, huh? You aren’t looking as hungover as usual today.”
For the tenth time that day Cas slipped his phone out of his pocket to glance at it while working. It was the oddest thing. He thought for sure that this text couldn’t possibly be meant for him. Charlie didn’t text him often, usually only about that next weekend’s meet up or to have him remind Dean of something. She was Deans best friend, not his.
Cas couldn't help but laugh. Leaning forward he took the opportunity to whisper in Dean's ear, "I thought you didn't mind an audience?" It was worth it all to see the blush steal quickly across his face. It highlighted his freckles in an alluring way.
“That’s harsh don’t you think?” He tried to keep the agitation out of his voice, especially when this was just some stranger. He didn’t particularly want to start a fight in a museum/art gallery.
Who knew that a Netflix show had so much sex in it? Sam knew. He had watched this before. So, once again, it was all his fault. Not that Dean didn’t enjoy sex on TV. Fuck that was the exact opposite of problem right now. He enjoyed it too much.
The Jinn cut Sam off, “Men of Letters. Yes, pray, how do you think they came into some of the vast knowledge they have?”
It was decided that the next day both Dean and Cas would skip out of school at lunch time. Cas knew that his mom had meetings with her editor on the second Monday of every month and his dad was supposed to be at the church today so he figured it would be safe to get in, pack his stuff, and get out.
“Oh pssh…don’t give me that crap Cas, I’m smarter than that. See I figured it out a la Sherlock Holmes style. You conveniently stopped texting as much the same night that I took Deans phone from him and texted you myself. You know the night. At the strip club. The one I dragged him to. And I figured that you thought Dean must have slept with someone on that trip.”
