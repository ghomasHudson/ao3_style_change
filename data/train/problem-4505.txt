“You know,” Gilda began, “Dean is the closest thing Krissy and Ben have to a father. He spends as much time as he can with them. Krissy wants to be a warrior, so Dean will occasionally give her lessons in sword fighting and combat. Ben is a bit softer. He likes being in the kitchen with Dean when he cooks.”
“Really?” Cas asked, pushing back to meet Dean’s movements and gasping when his prostate was hit. “Maybe I can — ah! — can fulfill that daydream — ah!”
When Dean turned on the shower, he wondered what temperature Castiel liked the water to be. Dean wondered what kind of sheets Castiel would like most as he stripped his bed, and when he put the dirty ones in the washer, Dean wondered if Castiel used the same detergent as he did. When Dean was picking out an outfit for the day, Dean wondered what Castiel would like him in best—loungewear or something a bit more fancy yet still casual? Maybe just a tshirt and some sleep pants? That sounded right.
sorry,” he said, and Castiel carefully let his power flow through their bodies, fixing the breaks and cuts and bruises that he’d caused. “We were just kids. We didn’t deserve what dad put us through.”
Dean leaned down and kissed Cas sloppily before letting go of his legs and reaching between them to guide his cock to rest against Cas’.
“No, no. You’re right, I need to apologize,” he said, and Dean thought he was being genuine for a moment so he lowered his hand. “You’re right, Dean. I’m sorry, Sam, I misspoke…” Dean
Gilda threw her head back as she laughed. “Okay, okay,” She said, pushing Cas’s hands away. “Okay, I won’t say any more about how
“You want my knot?” Dean asked, and Castiel moaned in agreement. “Come on, omega, you gotta say it. You gotta say ‘yes’.”
Gilda smiled, looking at Dean’s profile before tilting her head to the side and asking, “Why don’t you take him with us?” Dean felt his lips being tugged down.
“Go back to your ship and raise the white flag, or I will destroy you and your crew,” Dean said. “I'm giving you a second chance.
“That’s probably it,” Lisa said, “Benny’s really humble. Dean’s the one who likes to show off and compliment.”
“Alright,” Dean breathed out, closing his eyes and gripping Cas’s thighs. Cas could tell he was having a hard time controlling himself.
Dean brought himself out of his head as he ran his thumb over the slit of his cock.  An image of Cas with his mouth open in a perfect little
Dean’s stomach grumbled as he was making up his bed again and when he’d finished, he almost jammed himself in the hip in his haste to start making food for when Castiel woke up. He wondered if Castiel liked bacon or sausage more? Toast or pancakes? Eggs with or without yolk? There was so much to learn about Castiel, and Dean wanted to get into all of it with the omega right that second. Dean controlled himself, though, reminding himself that Castiel needed his sleep after last night.
“You, uh…” Dean flopped down next to Cas after he wiped off the cum from his chest. “Are you sure I didn’t go too far?”
“Fuck, Cas, I love you so goddamn much,” Dean groaned, and Castiel felt this thrill shoot through him.
Cas pouted, “No, please, I’m sorry. I won’t do that again.” Dean shook his head again, running his hands on the sensitive skin of Cas’s inner thighs.
Dean asked, and Castiel looked up to see a black muscle car pull over and then Dean was rushing out and over to him. “Hey, I’m sorry, I got in my car as soon as I heard the gunshots and looked up the address of the academy.”
“Okay,” Dean said, breathing out shakily. He gripped his member and lined himself up, pushing in slowly.
heart. I would do absolutely anything for them, no questions asked,” Dean said, jokingly shushing the kids who awed at that. “Then it’s my mate. I love him so much and he gave me the greatest loves of my life, so of course he’s second.” Dean chuckled as more
“Well, hello,” the man said, his voice coming out smooth and dark, in a way. Cas stumbled a few steps back, the stranger following him and crowding into his personal space. “You’re a pretty little thing.”
“It’s not too bad,” Dean mumbled, reaching into his nightstand and grabbing gauze and a strip of cloth. He dressed it quickly, and Cas didn't have the want to tell him that he'd be able to heal himself by tomorrow morning. So he stayed quiet, and continued to lay in silence. Taking time to just feel the warmth of one another.
“Yes, father,” Cas said, doing his best to hide the giddiness he felt. Seeing as Crowley would take at least six months to get back to Michael about the proposal, Cas was safe. He’d be gone with Dean in three and never have to deal with his father’s nonsense again. Everything was working out in his favor.
Benny rolled his eyes, “‘Cause you’ll probably want one tomorrow. Or the next day, or sometime in the future.”
“What do you want to do?” Dean asked, putting his papers down. Cas smiled and rolled onto his stomach once again.
“I love you, too,” Cas echoed as Dean started his ministrations on Cas stomach again. The feel of Dean’s strong, calloused hands on his skin made him weak. He was in his own little utopia of just him and Dean.
“I don’t want to, Dean.” Castiel reached out and unbuttoned Dean’s pants, pushing them and his boxers down just as he had done his own pants and underwear. He couldn’t help the little smile that spread across his face as Dean’s lips parted and his breathing came out ragged.
Castiel stared up at Dean as a million thoughts ran through his head too fast to decipher, or even process really.
“Everything is annoying to you when you have to do something you don’t want to,” Cas said. Dean nodded, placing a quick kiss on Cas’s forehead before he sprang into action. He got off the bed, helping Cas up, too, before walking over to his dresser and pulling out clean clothes for himself and Cas.
“Well, Castiel, I do not want to take up too much of your time. Especially not so soon after your first heat, however I feel we really need to talk about our possible eventual mating and marriage,” Dean said. Castiel stiffened, “And due to the reaction I got just by meeting you—which I do take full responsibility for and I apologize, Castiel, for the upset I caused you. I swear, that was not my intention. I only… I simply… I am sorry. It had been so long since I last saw you and I could not help myself. I should have shown greater restraint while you were so close to your heat. I am deeply sorry, Castiel. I hope you can forgive me.”
presence,” Alastair said, “Many of the omega’s and children who ran away left mates. Those alphas want their families back.”
“I’d be careful if I were you, Uriel.” Dean nodded at Lisa. “She’s so close to taking out a Demon Deal with me. They’re real cheap for people who work for me. Almost
was here before any knock on his door told him Dean had arrived. Castiel was already several steps back towards the door when he heard the knock Dean had established as his own, and Castiel opened the door willingly to let the alpha inside.
“No, baby,” Dean whispered, kissing Cas’s neck tenderly before lifting his head to smile down at Cas. “No, don’t be sorry. You’ve done so well, Cas. You did so perfectly and you didn’t even have to try. Okay? You’ve impressed me so much, already, baby. Don’t be sorry.”
“Yes, omega, I will give it to you,” Dean said, digging his fingers into Castiel’s hips, “Do you want my bite tonight, too?” He asked, his voice deep and searing. Castiel let out a pathetic little whine and nodded his head. He wanted Dean’s bite badly, he and his omega needed it and he was certain if he didn’t get it tonight, he would die.
“Yes,” Cas replied, smirking as he fumbled around in the nightstand drawer for the bottle of oil. Dean trailed kissed down Cas’s back as Cas placed the bottle in his outstretched hand.
Dean gripped Cas possessively before kissing him hard. He picked Cas up and laid them down on their bed, practically putting all his weight on Cas as their kiss turned heated.
“It’s…” Dean tried again, swallowing a lump in his throat. “This is much different than what I remember birthdays being.”
friends, but maybe she was the one to talk to about this. She was a few years older than him, and Gilda and Charlie, and Jess.
When Dean looked back, he had trouble tearing his eyes away from between Castiel’s legs because he was perfect. His cock was small, but not disproportionately so, and as Castiel pulled his legs up to expose his hole? Dean couldn’t
“Exactly,” Cas said, nodding. Dean let go of Cas’s wrists and slid them down to Cas’s hips, tugging at the hem on the button up shirt Cas was wearing.
“I understand,” Gilda said, linking her arm back through Castiel’s. She pulled them closer together and held him firmly. “Sam is quite tall, and that can be intimidating.”
Dean groaned in defeat, giving Cas’s neck a quick kiss before hauling himself up and off Cas. “Fine. You make a good point,” Dean huffed, sitting back on his heels. “An annoying point, but a good one,” he added as an afterthought. Cas pushed himself up onto his elbows, smiling and giggling softly at Dean.
’s whispered against the other’s mouth, skin pressed against skin, and tears mixing together on their cheeks.
“Okay,” Dean said, smiling. He turned to the rest of the table. “Hey mates, Cas and I are gonna head out. We’re both a little tired.”
“Right,” Castiel said, backing away from Dean. He watched the alpha turn around and walk away, his steps heavy, but insistent. When Dean was at the door to his trailer, Castiel blurted out, “You don’t love her, do you?”
Jess broke away from him and ran over to Sam, jumping up to hug him before she tugged him off towards what Castiel assumed was the garden.
The lights in his father’s study were on, hopefully meaning that his father was running late as well. Usually, his father would come wake him up at nine and have him get ready for his schooling until two in the afternoon, and then town council meetings until six. This was the routine every day, except for Saturday’s and Sunday’s. His uncle had convinced his father to keep those day’s left open.
“Really?” Dean moved to lean against his door jamb. “I’m typically shirtless when I’m out there. You like watching?” he asked, and Castiel’s eyes widened just a bit before he blushed madly and looked away. Dean grinned again. “I’m Dean, by the way.”
Castiel wasn’t stupid. He knew what it meant to be an omega in this world. It meant pain and suffering and never being able—never even getting
“I’ll see you at home,” he said, giving Castiel another quick peck to his cheek. Dean waved bye as his family started walking out, smiling happily at the scene before him. And then he remembered why Castiel had gone to the doctors. “Wait! How did the appointment go? Is everything…” Dean flicked his eyes down to Castiel’s stomach. “Good? Everything okay?”
After a few moments, Castiel saw the doorknob move and his heart raced anew as the door was pulled open to reveal Dean in his night clothes.
“Now if you don’t mind,” Meg began, “I haven’t been able to sleep in my own bed in…” she inhaled a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Quite a long time. Thanks for being there for me, Cas,” she said, and then laid back and seemed to melt into her mattress. “I’m going to sleep now.”
“Well,” Dean smirked. “Maybe there’s something I can do to persuade you to tell me?” He started to move his hands down Cas’s body.
Dean growled, feral and animalistic. He wasn’t going to be able to last much longer. Castiel was whining for his knot and the omega was raking his nails up and down his back as he tried to find purchase.
this leaf that had blown on board. I asked him who he was talking about and he just looked at me as if I had just asked the craziest question ever before telling me he meant you.”
“Screw you, Rachel,” Jo snarled under her breath before she held out an urn. “Anyone want to say anything?”
“Penetration, yes,” Ellen said. Alfie looked away and his arm loosened around Castiel’s shoulders. His face grew redder and he chewed on the inside of his lip.
“I think I’m adorable,” Dean said in earnest. Laughs were heard and Cas found himself looking up at Dean in adoration. He was not the man the rumors said he was. He wasn’t selfish or conceited. At least not with Cas. But the way he joked with his crew and was so obviously proud of his brother, it made Cas think he was
as Dean turned, using his shoulder to open the door to get to their cabin. Shoving his face into Dean’s neck, Cas felt tears ready to fall once they made it to their room.
“I don’t know,” Dean pressed his forehead against Cas’s. “It’s as if, there was me telling myself that you were special and I wanted to get to know you. But there was another thing or being, or whatever, whispering in my ear and confirming you were —
Thankfully, Dean caught on to his frustration, and promised he’d make time for them. It took a few days before Dean finally said he would come to get Castiel when he was finished with the day’s duties, and treat him to dinner, but in the grand scheme of things, Castiel wasn’t able to be upset about it because he was finally getting to talk with Dean.
Luckily for Castiel, it was easy to start school work. Even if it was tedious, he’d always had an appetite for learning anything he could and since he’d stopped his medication, it was even easier to bury himself in homework and studying.
Sometimes it worried him how much of his relationship with Cas was based on sex. For him, it was never just sex. Not ever. Sharing that part of himself with someone meant something more to him than it did to a lot of people.
“Okay,” Dean began again, moving back to the center of the classroom. “Today is going to be an easy day. For obvious reasons, I mean.” He looked around. “Anyone have any crazy—but appropriate for school, of course—dreams they want to share?”
“Dean,” Cas gasped, dragging the hand he had on his cock through the cum and precum on his stomach before he brought it up to Dean’s lips, urging the man to lick it clean. Dean smiled as he darted his tongue out to clean off Cas’s hand. He kept his eyes on Cas’s the whole time, feeling a sense of pride at the dazed look in his lover’s eyes.
Cas moaned, pushing into the man’s touches. He heard Dean let out something that sounded like a growl and he trembled. “Oh, Captain.”
“No,” She whispered, “It’s not.” Cas wasn’t sure how to respond and her gaze was so intense. “Don’t let yourself think that because of the way your father is — abusive — that you have to sit back and endure it. You don’t.”
When Dean stepped out of the shower, smelling like Lisa’s perfume infused soaps, he grabbed a towel to wrap around his waist before walking out and checking the time again: 11:58.
Castiel grabbed his robe, pulled it on in a rush, and then left his chambers. He practically ran through the halls towards Dean’s bedroom, not getting lost in the repetitive halls like every other time he walked through them because now he was letting his omega guide him.
“Dean!” Castiel moaned, asking for something he wasn’t sure he knew what it was. Dean huffed and crooked his fingers on the next push. He hit something inside Castiel that had him arching off the bed with a silent scream.
Michael scoffed and pushed Cas’s face to the floor. “You’re a disgrace to this family and a disgrace to the Novak name.”
“You’re so beautiful, Cas,” Dean whispered, nuzzling his nose into Cas’ hair. “You take my breath away, Cas. Gods, I love you so much, you’re so perfect and amazing.”
just barely behind his parted lips. Cas didn’t want Dean to ask, because the answer would always be yes, so he whimpered needily for him and bent his knees up to open himself for Dean to do as he wanted.
“I think it’s really hot when you say stuff like that, when you throw caution to the wind because you want my knot so badly, but it’s really not a good idea—” A loud strike of thunder cut Dean off, and he laughed breathlessly. He grabbed Castiel’s hips and tried to guide his movements, but Castiel slapped his hands away and glared at him.
Dean was snoring into the back of Cas’s head, not loud enough for it to be a nuisance. Cas found it cute. He liked knowing that Dean was able to get a good night’s sleep.
“You’re telling me to calm down?!” Dean yelled. He pounded his fist on the table Cas was on, rattling the wood and sending vibrations throughout Cas’s body. “I'm going to rip his lungs out! I’m going to
Castiel jumped up, blushing like mad as he offered to help the man up, too. He felt something akin to static shock when the man grabbed his hand. It took Castiel off guard, and when the man tried to get up Castiel almost fell back over because he hadn’t braced himself yet.
“I’m fine,” Dean rasped. Cas hummed out another pleased noise, signaling to Benny he had done an amazing job with dinner. Dean glared at Cas from across the table and mouthed for him to stop. Cas only smirked and brought his fork up to his lips, exaggeratedly licking away the excess sauce. Dean had to bite the inside of his cheek to keep himself quiet.
“Has anyone told you you’re a workaholic?” Sam asked, sarcastic disgust dripping from his words before they took on a venomous tone. “You’ve killed so many people, Sandover. Mothers who needed to feed their family had to watch their children die right in front of them. More than one family go to the point where they found their kids eating the others because of how hungry they’d gotten.”
Cas cried out. “Right there!” He moaned brokenly and Dean lost the last bit of willpower he had to hold off his orgasm. Slamming his hips into Cas with reverence, he crushed his mouth onto Cas’s, slipping his tongue in for a second before he had to pull away to breathe.
“What’s what like?” Dean asked, “Having a family?” Cas nodded. Dean frowned and searched his eyes; Cas felt as though his soul was being examined. “I didn’t always have a family, either,” Dean whispered, not breaking eye contact. “I know how hard it is to feel alone; like you’ve got no one. I’m sorry, Cas.”
Dean chuckled and threw the sheets into his soiled clothes basket. “No need to apologize.” He smiled reassuringly at the boy. “It was actually bloody arousing.”
“You did not immediately react to his scent?” Meg asked, “Oi, tough blow for Dean. You are his true mate and if you had no reaction to his scent—”
When the music started, the chapel doors opened and Sam and Jess began walking down the aisle. A few seconds after they disappeared from Castiel’s view, Jo and Gilda began walking. Then, Victor and Charlie followed as well as Meg and Gadreel. Before Alfie and Benny were to go, Alfie turned to Castiel one last time and kissed him on the forehead.
“You don’t have the right to speak, here, Castiel,” Jo said, and the iciness to her voice made Castiel want to disappear.
Castiel pulled Jo down to him and wrapped his hand around her throat. “Tell me where he is because I will not let you, the Garrison, or anyone hurt Dean. And if you do?” Castiel squeezed his hand harder and harder around Jo’s throat. “I will end you, and everything in my way without thinking
“When I said that if your and Gabe’s positions were switched,” Cas started. “Not even my love for you could make me stay.”
“No!” Cas gasped, trying to rock up into Dean. He felt the faintest brush of skin on skin and that’s when he noticed that he and Dean were naked. “Please, I want to.”
“Yes,” Meg said in a bored manner. She moved over to Cas’s desk and looked to Cas’s most recent finished painting and studied it. “This is a pirate ship, is it not?”
“What do you want me to do to you, Cas?” Dean whispered, giving Cas a smug look. Cas didn't answer and instead kept his attention on Dean's hands. Dean doubted Cas had even registered any words were spoken. "Cas." Dean said firmly, taking his hands off of the young man.
Charlie leaned forward and began, “We understand that being an omega of servant status and working in the castle under a Winchester’s rule was... Indescribably terrifying. Starting with the first Winchester to rule, each new Winchester King grew more despicable than the last. John was...” Charlie looked down at her hands, “Awful. He... He hurt so many.”
“Dean,” Cas gasped, arching his back just slightly. He reached his hand up to fist in Dean’s hair and pulled his head to the side. Cas lifted himself off the table enough to lick away the remaining cherry filling on Dean’s cheek before moving his legs around Dean’s waist to pull the man into him. Dean smiled, running his thumb across one of Cas’s nipples. Cas pushed his chest into Dean’s hands again and closed his eyes as Dean pressed his lips to Cas’s.
“I’m so proud of you, Cas,” he said. Castiel felt tears prick at the corner of his eyes, but before they could begin to fall, Ellen ushered Alfie and Benny to the doors for their cue.
“Secure,” Cas answered. Dean nodded and headed back over to the other side of the bed to do the same to his other leg. “Why didn’t you just tie them around my knee? It bends, you know. It would’ve also been a lot easier.”
“Um, it’s uh, the s-seventh,” Castiel said, still in shock to see his sister standing here in front of him.
“Did I hurt you, Cas?” Dean asked, coming to sit down between Cas’s legs and rubbing them soothingly.
“Alpha, of course,” Dean said, and Castiel nodded. “So, freckles, green eyes, light brown hair, tall, a couple tattoos, lots of muscles and big hands, he’s strong—
“N-no,” Cas gasped. He could feel the familiar feeling of heat pooling in his belly and wanted to warn Dean he was about to come but he couldn’t get the words out. All he could do was pant and moan as Dean continued his assault on his chest. “Dean! Dean, I’m —
Castiel had had orgasms before—involuntarily, of course, and they weren’t pleasurable, but he’d still had them. So, he knew what those orgasms had felt like, but this one was different. Castiel felt this climax differently. It had come from deeper inside him, it was bigger, it left him feeling satisfied instead of guilty and disgusted with himself. It made Castiel feel so much, and it was all for Dean. All because of Dean.
Castiel couldn’t do anything but stand, frozen. He felt this wall of worry, relief, sadness, pleading, and guilt smash into him, and he realized it was coming from
Dean smiled back at him, raising his eyebrows. “Ah,” he said, writing it down and laughing. “That’s good.”
Castiel nodded his head slowly. He’d never had anything but water; and tea, on rare occasions. “Could I have water?”
Castiel sighed. “It started last week. I was talking to my friend Gabe about how I should go about asking you to take my virginity, and my second oldest sister was visiting for the day and one of her old friends from high school came to catch up and she was eavesdropping on my conversation. You’d been with her before, and she butted in to tell me that you didn’t like virgins and that you’d turn me away immediately. I was skeptical because I knew she was a virgin the first time you had sex with her—and there were other kids I’d gone to school with—older than me and graduated, I mean—who’d talked about you during church sometimes, and I know most of them were virgins before they were with you because I go to catholic school, so... I needed to be sure, and I asked if you did and you said you didn’t like being with them anymore, and I couldn’t
Castiel nodded as Gilda looped her arm through his just as Jess had. The two of them directed him out of his room.
“Yes, Ellen,” Castiel said. Ellen smiled at him warmly. She got up and moved over to help Castiel under his linens and quilts. Once Castiel settled against his pillows and had time to let out the breath he’d been holding in for God knows how long, he finally felt the exhaustion Ellen said she saw in him. There was something else he felt, something new, but he ignored it in favor of closing his eyes.
“Cas, please,” Dean said, his voice so broken and begging so desperately, “please don’t send me away.”
“Good.” Jess ran her hands through Castiel’s hair and sang softly, urging him to get more sleep now that his heat wasn’t keeping him up.
Dean started the conversation with Cas about him being descended from angels; with Gilda’s help, of course. Cas didn’t believe it at first. But then Gabe appeared, almost out of nowhere, and confirmed the claim. Apparently, Gabe had been researching this since he was a kid; it’s part of the reason that Michael hated him so much. Gabe was like Cas: he had more Grace in him than Michael. And Michael was not happy about that.
“Now just move your hand like I did with you,” Dean said, running his hand through Cas’s hair gently.
. It was made from bone. Bobby said it was from the jaw of a donkey from ancient times he just had lying around, but Dean wasn’t entirely convinced of that.
“Alright then,” He said curtly. The brusque tone had Cas flinching, almost imperceptibly; but the corner of Michael's mouth twitched and Cas knew his father saw the effect he had over his son.
right. And Dean was decent enough to admit when he was wrong. “You’re right. I am letting my past get in the way of my present and future. But...” He replayed what Jo had said about Cas being head-over-heels for him and felt like he was going to die from sheer happiness; a smile tugged at his lips that he couldn’t help. “Is it that obvious?” Dean asked.
Finally, Dean was able to tear his eyes off Cas and he headed towards the bathroom connected to his room to shower and get dressed. A routine that usually took ten minutes. But Dean was done, turning the water off, stepping out and grabbing a towel to dry himself in six. He slung the towel around his neck and walked back into the bedroom. Cas jumped slightly when he walked in.
Castiel yipped in surprise and excitement, but he nodded, grabbing a handful of Dean’s hair and tugging the alpha’s head to the side. He buried his nose in Dean’s neck, taking a deep breath before he felt that feeling of ecstasy overtake him and he sunk his teeth into Dean’s neck, riding out the waves of his orgasm with his teeth firmly in Dean’s neck, not letting go until he felt it right to let go of his alpha.
“I am very happy to meet you,” he said without thinking. Gilda smiled back at him, and her smile was like nothing Castiel had ever seen. It was like she was casting a spell on him.
“You not being able to talk does sound appealing,” Castiel said, threading his hand into Dean’s hair.
“Cas,” Dean groaned. He lifted his head from Cas’s neck and put his forehead against Cas’s, feeling himself come undone just as fast as Cas was. “Been so long,” Dean groaned. “I’m close.”
“Yes, for you,” Dean said. Castiel smiled in thanks and reached for his fork and knife. Dean did the same and they each took a bite.
Cas had a hard time getting his words out when he finally spoke. It was hard for Dean to understand him, too, but it wasn't hard to guess what he was trying to ask:
“Thank you,” Dean whispered, laying back on his bed and covering his eyes with a hand. “I know you want to ask me the question; go ahead.”
“Fuck, Cas!” Dean almost shouted, Cas gasped and barely registered the feeling of Dean squeezing his hands through the deafening pleasure flowing through him with each beat of his heart. He whimpered and hung onto Dean with blinding strength until he was able to think clearly.
“Don’t worry, angel,” Dean said as pulled Cas back again and snapped his hips forward, causing Cas’s legs to give out. “I got you.” Dean held Cas up while still thrusting hips.
“Cas.” Dean let his eyes drift closed. Cas looked up at him and watched his face until the pirates eyes snapped open again. His hand fisted itself in Cas’s dark locks. Dean’s lips twitched up in a smile as he moaned. “I don’t know how you do it, but I can’t seem to control myself with your mouth doing the things it does to me. I hate it.”
Dean’s first week back from sea went by in a blur. The two saw each other whenever they could and spent the majority of the time talking and laughing together, as well as getting to know Dean’s crew better. At one point Cas even risked sneaking out of one of his father’s town meetings to see Dean and his first mates during the day.
Even then, when Castiel was barely keeping upright on top of him, Dean didn’t stop. Instead, Dean gave up control to his own wolf and moved his hands up to Castiel’s hips, using his strength to push and pull Castiel so his cock rubbed the omega’s walls while his knot massaged that spot inside Castiel that made him see stars.
As Dean walked back to him and Gilda, Castiel realized that for as much as Dean doesn’t know him? he really doesn’t know Dean as well as he thought, either.
Castiel almost looked up at Dean. “Look, I don’t like talking about this and I really don’t want to go into detail about all of what they did.”
Not beating around the bush, Dean spoke. “You’re the son of Michael Novak?” Cas looked startled for a second before gripping the towel around his waist and nodding. Dean closed his eyes in frustration. “Why didn’t you tell me?” He looked into Cas’s eyes.
Cas looked around Dean’s cabin and noted how much smaller it was compared to the Impala. And the furniture was completely different. The bed was pushed against the west wall and his desk was turned to face towards the entry to his cabin. Sam saw Cas’s face change in slight ways as he took everything in, but as he walked over to Dean’s wardrobe, he saw Cas’s face go back to impassive and blank.
“You’re sure?” Dean asked, looking back as Cas, who still had a pleased smile on his face and drool coming out of his mouth.
Cas wouldn’t be able to handle that; he wouldn’t be able to truly live. If Dean wasn’t able to come back to Heaven… Cas knew he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from receding into himself to the point of just going through the motions.
!” He heard multiple shouts call from the main deck before he felt several hands on his arms, pulling him back up.
Dean nodded, picking up his pace and power behind each thrust. He could feel his orgasm approaching, but willed himself to hold it off. Cas’s legs squeezed around his hips and Dean groaned at the feel of how powerful Cas’s legs were. He leaned down to Cas’s neck and kissed over the unmarked skin. And at the first touch of his lips to Cas’s soft skin, he whined and bared his throat to Dean.
“Fuck,” Dean gasped. “I never thought I’d like seeing someone else's cum on my face...” He collected all the cum on his fingers, wiping it off on the bed before he dropped the mirror.
“We need to clean up and I need to get back…” Cas said quietly, frowning as he turned to look at the alarm. “You have to leave in an hour.”
Cas’s eyes blinked slowly, still coming back from his pleasure trip. His neck was peppered with light pink spots and his mouth hung open. Dean wanted Cas to not regret this night. He leaned down and kissed him lovingly. Cas responded rather quickly, yet with sloppier precision. But it didn't bother Dean in the slightest.
“Are you okay?” He asked immediately and came to stand in front of Cas, between his knees. Cas nodded.
The next morning Castiel awoke to the feeling of something tickling his neck. It only took him a moment to realize it was Dean’s breathing. He turned to face the alpha, and smiled when he saw the small bite on Dean’s neck.
Dean was seconds away from attacking Cas’s chest with more hickeys and pushing his hand into Cas’s linens when someone pounded at his door. He groaned in frustration as he got up to answer it. Cas sat up on Dean’s bed and pulled the first shirt he found over his head. Judging by how it wouldn’t stay on his narrow shoulders he guessed he had put on Dean’s shirt.
Sandover’s eyes widened and he let out a feeble “No.” Dean stood up and walked slowly around him. Benny put his hand on his throat as Sam walked away to grab more rope, throwing it towards the ceiling and over one of the crossbeams. Sandover watched Sam closely as he came back and threaded the rope through the bindings on his wrists. “What do you want? I haven’t done anything!”
“What is that smell?” Castiel mumbled to himself, scenting the air and looking around to try and pinpoint where it was coming from. He started in one direction, halting a few steps into it before turning and going the other way. It’d began to get fainter in the other direction.
“What do you mean?” he said, almost gasping for air because it was hard to breathe. “I-I had to. Dad made me. He—”
Castiel keened in the most primal and submissive way, and Dean gave an involuntary shove forward. And even though he remained unable to move his limbs, Dean could feel Castiel shaking through another orgasm.
“Charlie’s family had kicked her out,” Cas said, turning his head to speak into Dean’s hair. “Gilda was being abused, Kevin was being hunted, Ash was being forced to abuse his gift, Sam was with your father, Benny was in Purgatory, and you, Dean… You saved yourself, too. You saved everyone on this ship in one form or another.”
“Yeah, I was… I wasn’t—I was the black sheep,” he said in hopes of easing the tension for Dean. He wanted to make it as easy as possible for Dean to leave because that would save Castiel some heartache later.
you have to promise me that you’ll never leave me again. You’ll never drop me off on some island or whatever else so you can go fight a battle. Promise me that?”
“I got you,” Dean turned his head to kiss Cas’s forehead before he wrapped his arms around him and rolled onto his side, pulling out of Cas as well. He carefully laid Cas on his back and put his arm under his head. “You okay?”
“Well, when you grow up the only powerless kid in a family where everyone is powerful… You tend to fall by the wayside.”
“Okay,” Cas said. He smiled wider at Dean as they pecked and Dean left. Cas started to walk towards Benny, who caught his eye at the counter where the warming trays of leftover dinner were and smiled, but Gabe stopped him.
Dean and Benny made their way back to Dean’s home, doing what they could for food and shelter. And when they got there, Dean sneaked into his house and woke Sam, who started crying with how happy he was that he could see Dean again. He was so young when Dean was sold, but no matter what happened, he wasn't able to forget Dean's face or what his brother meant to him.
,” Castiel said, and he watched as his siblings’s eyes moved from looking at him to looking behind him. Their eyes widened as Castiel felt his wings materialize behind him and stretch up in a threatening display. “I won’t let you hurt him.”
Castiel moaned quietly as the delicious smell of the meal invaded his sense. “It smells wonderful,” he said, closing his eyes and taking another big inhale.
“Of course,” Cas said, giggling. He craned his neck forward and latched onto Dean’s neck, sucking a dark purple bruise into his skin. He wanted this one to hurt a little bit for Dean and for it to last a while.
Dean nodded his thanks and then turned to Victor. “Gather anyone who wishes to come with us. Make sure they know it’s not an order, but we need ten people at the very least to man the ship.”
“I spent months catatonic because of him and I can’t be with him again if he’s just going to leave me at a moments notice!” Cas shook his head in both anger and sadness. “I have to think of myself first and protect myself here.”
“First time you’ve ever had a prostate orgasm,” Dean said, “It’ll do that to you.” He laid Cas down on his back and situated himself on his arm and knees. “I’m gonna pull out; are you ready?”
“Do I like you in panties?” Dean asked, dropping to his knees and pulling Cas’s trousers off quickly. He looked at the panty clad angel in front of him with hungry eyes. “Angel, I’d like you in just about anything.”
Cas’s emotions were bottled up during the day; he saved them for at night when he would stand on his terrace and watch the sea in hopes of seeing the Impala. He hadn't, yet. But Cas still held hope.
“We’re almost to Lawrence,” Chuck said, his voice quivering just enough to be noticeable. “But… There’s a problem.”
“You came so hard,” Cas stated, standing up and nuzzling into Dean’s neck as he gave Dean’s cock one last stroke that had Dean sighing deeply.
Dean waited until Castiel’s breathing evened out, and the omega finally moved to reach out for him, moaning as Dean leaned over him and moved just enough inside him.
“Fuck,” Dean grunted, feeling Cas clench around him almost unbearably tight. After a few stuttering thrusts, he came. He fell onto Cas’s and closed his eyes, savoring the feeling of
“I get it, I mean,” Cas said in hopes of dissipating some of the awkwardness in the air. “You’re the only one who could really understand what he’d been through. I… I would’ve done the same thing, in your place.”
“Dean, I want everyone to know you are my mate, too,” he said, “And I am happy you chose me, as well.”
“I understand,” Benny said and took one of Dean’s hands in his own. “It’s okay.” Dean sobbed again, gripping Benny’s hand. “Mates,” Benny whispered after a few minutes. Charlie and Sam left after giving Dean hugs.
“Yes,” Cas cried, thrusting his own hips in Dean’s hand and heaving again at the sensation of the older man’s length against his own.
“Aye, I will take care of you. Calm your heart,” Dean whispered, placing tender kisses all over Castiel’s face.
“You need to go, Amara,” Dean said. Castiel felt the change in Dean’s demeanor and moved over to him, turning Dean to look at him. He made Dean look in his eyes and smiled for him, trying to let him know things would be okay.
“Dean,” Cas started again, closing his eyes and clutching the stone to his chest. “I need you back as soon as possible. I need you here with me. I need your arms around me, and I need you to tell me everything is going to be okay because right now it does not feel like
“I don't want you to go either,” Cas said. “But you have to go kill some bastards.” Dean only huffed in response, not making a move to get up. He just pushed his face into Cas’s neck further. “Dean, c’mon.”
“Um, yeah,” Castiel said, “But it wasn’t like what you’re thinking. My siblings actually are extraordinary. They have—”
Figures. They were running out of food here, and they couldn’t keep eating at the Roadhouse every night. Even if the food was some of the best Castiel had ever had. It still wasn’t practical. Plus, the idea of cooking with Dean again sounded like a really nice date.
“Of course,” Cas teased. Dean smiled as they entered his bathroom. He pushed Cas up against the wall opposite the shower and kissed him roughly. Cas opened his mouth when he felt Dean lick along his bottom lip and moaned as the man’s tongue pushed into his mouth and rubbed against his own. Dean’s hand left Cas’s thigh and snaked between them to take his cock in his hand. He ran his thumb over the tip of Cas’s length and felt him shudder and gasp.
NOTE: This chapter isn't edited, so, excuse any mistakes or any awkward places in this chapter, please. :)
Dean snorted, “Right, and I don’t love pie.” Cas smiled and giggled a little. “So, what were you really thinking of?”
“I’m really sorry for this,” Lisa said, sounding on the verge of tears herself. “He’s just trying to get used to life on the boat.”
“Good night,” Castiel said, “I am going back to my chambers. Dinner was delicious, thank you.” He walked away from Dean, ignoring his calls until he couldn’t hear them anymore.
Castiel didn’t want to trust an alpha. And in the time he’d know Dean, he still didn’t want to trust an alpha. But Dean was making it hard.
Okay, Dean's past is not for the faint of heart. Some truly terrible things has happened to him and once you're done with the smut scene, if you don't handle sorta gorey suff well then just stop there. I'll post in the next update what all was discussed between Dean and Cas about Dean's past.
“Congratulations, father,” Cas said, forcing a smile onto his face as he lied straight through his teeth. “You performed above expectations. I don’t think this case would’ve panned out in favor of your friend if you hadn’t been here.”
When Dean reached the two women, he hugged them both, handing the boy, Ben, over after he’d pulled away. Castiel watched at Dean talked with the four of them, his heart thudding a little bit at how easily the two omegas and the kids interacted with Dean. He could feel his omega stirring inside him, reaching out towards Dean, but he pushed it down because it didn’t mean anything. His omega was only acting this way because he’d been told about the whole true mate business. It didn’t mean anything, so Castiel shoved it down as far as he could.
“I love it,” Castiel said, taking the last bite he had on his plate. He chewed slowly as to savor the taste, and smiled at Dean after he swallowed. “Thank you, Dean,” he said.
Cas perked up at that announcement. King Crowley was not one to make decisions in a timely manner. He preferred to...well, abuse his power and push peoples limits. It took just over six months for the King to even accept Michael’s first appeal to meet years ago. Since then, Michael and Crowley’s relationship had mostly been Michael asking a simple question and then getting an answer months upon months later. It was ridiculous, if Cas said so himself. But right now, Cas couldn’t be more happy about that fact.
“Fuck, Cas!” Dean groaned, and he snapped his hips into Castiel, hitting this spot that made Castiel scream out at the pleasure that lit him up from the inside. “God, sorry,” Dean said, giving one more gentle thrust before resting his hips against Castiel. “Fuck, did you come just a second ago?”
“I-I’m glad,” Dean said, and if Castiel didn’t know better he would say that Dean sounded flustered. He shook that thought from his head and focused on their next step for the evening.
Cas soaped up his hands and raked his eyes over Dean’s front as his hands left trails of soap where they went.
Cas shivered again when he used the voice to make his question seem like more of a statement. “A little.”
Castiel forced all the emotion out of his voice in a way that took years of practice as he responded. “No, I don’t. I was—I mean, you know, I was Unlucky Number Seven. I’m just… Ordinary.”
“Will you look at me?” Dean asked. Castiel couldn’t help the small choking sob that escaped past his lips. He knew Dean hadn’t heard it, and he was glad for that. He didn’t want to give the vile man any reason to think he was winning.
When Castiel’s heat had finally passed, and he’d had a few days to recuperate, he was summoned by the King.
“Please, alpha,” Castiel begged, gasping each time Dean’s hips jolted him up on the bed. “Please knot me! I need it!”
Cas nodded and did as asked, handing the bottle back to Dean who opened it and dipped his finger in, letting it warm up on his hand before touching Cas’s entrance.
When they were back to a more conscious and coherent state, Cas slid his hand down Dean’s front and palmed Dean’s erection, pushing away from the wall so he could switch their current positions. He dropped to his knees and tugged Dean’s trousers down enough to free Dean’s manhood. Dean inhaled deeply and ran his hand through Cas’s hair, watching as Cas enthusiastically took as much of his length into his mouth as he could.
“Yes,” Castiel said. They passed patch of tall yellow flowers, and Castiel had to pause to look at them. They were absolutely beautiful, and so bright. Like the sun itself had colored the petals.
But he knew when Dean was lying. He’d been to the dungeons of Castle Purgatory with Dean; he was incapable of lying to Benny.
Castiel narrowed his eyes even further at Dean. “So, of course, I’ve been raped,” he said. “That’s the part that’s obvious?”
“When I look at you… Dean, I feel like I'm looking into the sun.” Cas took his hands from Dean’s and walked around to kiss the man’s back. “You’re the single most beautiful being I've ever seen.”
“Um, no offense taken?” Dean said. Castiel rolled his eyes, slowly lowering his hands and moving a few steps in front of Dean. He looked at his siblings, taking them in, and he almost felt guilty for what he’d done. Benny’s arm was in a sling and he looked like he hadn’t slept in days. Meg was faring about the same, and her skin looks paler than usual. Rachel looked like she’d lost an unhealthy amount of weight, while Gabe looked like he was about to keel over and empty his stomach right there on the floor. And Jo… Jo looked the worst of all of them. There was a fading hand print around her neck, and her face was sunken and looked grey, almost. She looked like she’s lost more weight than healthy, too.
“Dean?” Cas started, “I’ve said this before, and I meant it then just as much as I mean it now: You deserve to get what you want. And I know that I’m what you want; or at least something you want.”
“Gods, Cas!” Dean groaned as Cas moved his hips down to meet Dean’s thrust. Cas scrabbled to find purchase on Dean’s back again, making him groan loudly.
“His Majesty has prepared a chamber for you to spend your heat in,” one of the guards said. Castiel snapped his head up to look at the man in shock. How could he speak of something as private as a heat with such blatancy? And in such a public space. The other omegas in the kitchen had to have heard the guard, and rumors spread like a wildfire within the castle servant staff. Every omega in the castle would know he was in heat and being claimed by King Dean before the sun even rose in the morning.
Cas shot up in bed, breathing hard. He felt a sharp, intense hopelessness work itself up from his chest in the form of a sob. Dean was still asleep, if his snoring was anything to go by, and Cas quickly clamped his hand over his mouth before the horrible wail of the leftover distress from his dream could get out. He curled into himself and squeezed his eyes shut, willing the images of Meg in a dress and the minister standing there, bible in his hands as he married him to Meg. It wasn’t real, and it would never be real. Cas knew that. It was just a nightmare and the only power it held was the influence he gave it over himself.
“If you tell me yours I’ll tell you mine,” Dean said, and Castiel snapped his eyes up to Dean’s like he was a kid whose hand had been caught in the cookie jar.
“I love you, too, Cas,” Dean said, “I’m a little confused as to what’s happening now, so I’m gonna need you to explain, because one moment I was coming back from grocery shopping and the next I woke up on the ground in a box.”
“Good.” Bobby turned to Dean. “Do you Your Majesty, take Dame Castiel as your mate, and pledge to him before every soul in this holy room to be his protector, defender, and supporter, to honor and sustain him, in sickness and in health, in fair and in foul, with all worldly powers, to cherish and to forsake all others, keep only to him, so long as you both shall live?”
When night fell, Alfie had found him in his bed, pillows and bedding fashioned into a makeshift nest around him. Castiel had spent hours in there, crying off and on because he felt like something inside him had been twisted and gnarled into something ugly and he had no say to stop it. He felt like he’d done something wrong.
“Those are new flags,” he said slowly, studying the ship. “That ship is weak, though. It has many weak points. Tell Jo to load the cannons and Ash to help. We need to be ready. These are new pirates and they may be looking to pick a fight. Get everyone ready.”
“I have been told Dean was quite enthusiastic in telling anyone he could he had a true mate,” he said, “I find it sweet.”
“I don’t have a boyfriend at the moment,” Castiel said softly, “a-and I heard that birthdays were a good time to…do it.”
“I love you, too, Dean,” Cas whispered, tracing small patterns into Dean’s shoulder blades. “We can’t fall asleep, though.”
Hearing that his father had passed, though, Castiel figured that would make him feel more than muted and quiet sadness; but seeing as he felt like he had when he’d dropped his coffee just a few moments ago…Castiel knew today would just be a normal day.
“You love him,” she stated. Dean froze before sighing and pushing his chair out to walk to his bed. Jo followed him, leaning up against the post at the foot of his bed.
The man who attacked him turned his attention to Benny. It gave Castiel just enough time to catch his breath again and get up. He saw Benny fighting the man and the man wasn’t actually holding his own. It threw Castiel for a loop because there had never been someone that could stand up to Benny’s strength and speed, but this man was… Castiel watched as the man was able to lift Benny up and slam him back down on the ground. And Benny didn’t get back up right away.
“On how many times you wanna come on it,” he said, moving to put his hands behind his head. Castiel stared down at him with wide eyes and Dean smirked. He planted his feet and gave a small thrust up. Castiel mewled and instinctively moved his hands to rest against Dean’s chest.
Castiel sat in the uncomfortable chairs of the waiting room to the vice principal’s and principal’s office. He’d been called out of class because VP Barnes wanted to talk to him. It was because he was the only person at this school who knew how to work the lights and sound in the auditorium and there was a presentation tomorrow in there, he knew that. His drama teacher warned him he’d be pulled out of class for this, but he couldn’t help but be a little nervous.
Dean growled and shoved his hips forward again. Castiel cried out once more as he clamped down on Dean and climaxed. Dean felt where his hips met Castiel’s grow wet and his alpha roared at that, clawing at his insides to let go of the short leash it was on.
As they got into the room, Dean picked Cas up and pushed him against the door, making him gasp in surprise. The pirate moved to nip at Cas’s neck while on of his hands came to palm at Cas’s groin while the other supported some of his weight under his thigh.
“I’ll be the judge of that,” he said and then tipped the bottle all the way upside down and gulped down some of the clear liquid. It burned going down, but Castiel ignored it and instead just chugged for a good five seconds before putting the bottle back down on the table. He gave it another few seconds to settle in before meeting Gadreel’s gaze again. There was a little smirk on his face and questioning in his eyes. Castiel shrugged again and shook his head. “You were right,” he said, “I really did not like that.”
Castiel didn’t feel he could go to Rachel with anything Dean-related, so he’d asked Gadreel to talk. And as he explained what his encounters with Dean had been like the past month or so, Gadreel had sat and listened. Never interrupting or looking judgemental or bewildered.
“Not too long,” Cas responded, reaching up to trace his finger along the arch of Dean’s brow. The man cracked an eye open for a second before closing it again.
“Dean,” Castiel’s breath caught. He swayed forward, almost throwing caution to the wind, and wrapping his arms around Dean and Dean looked about ready to do the same…
“It’s not your fault,” he whispered, pulling his family in tighter. “It’s not any of our faults. We were all kids, and dad should have been better. He shouldn’t have done any of what he did. I was wrong to blame you, any of you. It was unfair and unkind, and
“Castiel, I know you are wary of me. I understand why. All I ask is you give me the chance to prove to you I do not want to cause harm to you or any other omega.”
“Trust me, the way I’ve done it will be more comfortable,” he said. “Do me a favor and push against the slats in the headboard as hard as you can while I tighten these? And tell me if it’s too much, okay?”
me. I want you to fuck me hard enough for it to hurt. I want to be able to feel it for weeks to come.”
Cas was still standing in the middle of the room, shifting from foot to foot and watching his father warily. “I’m sorry, father,” Cas whispered, expecting his father to just glare at him. But the next thing he knew, his father’s hands were on his shoulders and pulling him down to violently knee him in the stomach.
“Is Jane there?” she asked, and Castiel tried to keep his distance and not eavesdrop despite the way voices always tended to carry in the library. “I want to talk to her!” Rachel almost shouted. “Inias, she’s my daughter. I have a right to—Inias!”
“Green please,” Castiel said, “And don’t be a dumbass, Dean, you don’t need to feel icky. I was in control of the situation—ever since I had my first heat, the only say you had was a two letter word the
“I...” Castiel frowned. He needed to talk to someone. Gilda and Jess had become his closest confidants, but they were unavailable. So was Charlie, and Alfie would be asleep. Castiel knew if he asked for Alfie’s time, he would get it, but he also knew Alfie worked hard. And he would be getting up again tomorrow to work hard. He needed his rest. So, that left Meg.
Just a quick thing: I may have fucked up Dean and Cas's ages here, but I'm not certain... I'll go back and edit if I have to, but for now, it is what it is.
Cas looked up and around, familiarizing himself with the surroundings. While doing so, he caught the eye of the red-headed woman; she smiled at him.
“Bye,” Cas whispered. He stood there, looking at the front door and waited. When the staff scurried back into the house, Cas felt himself break out into a smile. He raced upstairs and packed a bag for his time with Dean, too happy to really check what he was throwing in there. All he cared about was getting to Dean and seeing what he had had planned for tomorrow.
Dean scoffed. “Get out of my head.” Dean shook his head. “You’re using your powers. That’s not fair.”
“You’re still growing,” Cas spoke into Dean’s skin. “Improving… Molding yourself into a better man.” He came to stop his hands where the scar did and he slid them to encircle Dean’s waist, massaging his palms into the man’s abdomen. “It’s hard to believe that you let me help you with that.” Cas placed a tender kiss right in the middle of Dean’s back; where Alastair had cut him the deepest. “I love you, Dean.”
“It’s good to finally meet you,” Amara said, smiling wide. Her teeth were almost too white and if Castiel hadn’t chugged some of that absinthe, he probably would have been slightly worried. But in his buzzed state, he was just upset Amara came and messed up his time with Gadreel. “I’ve been trying to chat for quite some time, and I had hoped it would be in a more private setting than this, but you are a hard one to catch.”
“Castiel,” Castiel replied, giggling a tiny bit as Dean’s breath tickled his neck when he exhaled. “You can call me Cas, though.”
“Okay,” Ben yawned again. He settled down quickly, curled up in Dean’s side with his head on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean kissed the skin where the inside of Castiel’s thigh met his body and he pouted. “You’re not gonna let me eat you out?”
“I know, baby,” Dean cooed, “Me too. I love you, too.” Dean grunted, pushing flush against Cas and coming buried deep inside him. “Fuck, Cas.”
“You’re wrong,” Dean said, “because as long as I’m around, he’ll never have to fear them. I’ll never let one get near enough to hurt him.”
Crowley nodded uninterestedly. “It was a piece of junk, if you ask me. A man nearing the age of fifty goes out to restore chivalry? Not likely.”
“Forgive us, Castiel,” the second guard said while the first guard gave Castiel an apologetic wince.
“Are you sure? I’ve got more bee facts I can tell you,” Cas asked, bringing his hand up slowly. “May I?”
“Yes, though today was the first time you met with a clear head. And no misconception about the grounds of his intent to mate you,” Meg said. Castiel flicked his eyes to Charlie and Gilda, growing even more nervous as he realized they were interested in what he had to say as well. He took a deep breath and coughed as all the scents of the room flooded his senses. Everything began to feel so overwhelming again. It was all so new, and he didn’t really know anyone here besides Alfie.
“I love you, too,” Dean said. Cas twirled his fingers into the hair just behind Dean’s ear, chewing on his bottom lip a little before speaking again.
“Have the bridge readied,” he said, turning back to cautiously survey the ship next to them. “Aye! I am Dean Winchester.” There was a long silence before anyone responded.
“I want you to try riding me,” Dean began, Cas opened his mouth to protest, but Dean cut him off. “Let me just show you, okay? We’ll stop immediately if it’s too much.” Dean pulled him onto his lap and ran his hands up and down Cas’s back.
as my father put it. The only reason I'm  not going is because Michael thinks I'm going to thwart his attempts to repair the irreparable." Cas sighed. "Oh well. He's just... He's... Stressed."
“It's either early in the morning or late at night,” Dean said, happily chewing the apple in his mouth. Cas made a small disgruntled noise in the back of his throat.
“Hey, why the long face?” Rachel asked Castiel, giggling as Gadreel tickled her. She took another drink of the celebratory tequila the arena gave to them as a prize for winning tonight’s fight. “We won, didn’t we? And the arena threw this party for us, didn’t they?”
“Mh-hm,” Cas hummed. He gritted his teeth as he pushed himself farther down no Dean’s cock. Cas’s eyes snapped open to look into Dean’s as he bottomed out and a broken whine was pulled from his throat. “Oh!”
“You do not have to say what you think I want to hear, Castiel,” Dean said, “Nor do you have to force yourself to say anything you do not mean. I hope one day that you will be able to truly accept my apology. Today does not have to be that day.”
, I got so wet for you,” Castiel said, and Dean’s hips gave a little push. The action drew another high moan from Castiel, and Dean almost laughed as he felt the omega squeeze around him. “I can’t—I can’t
“You don’t have to, Dean,” Cas whispered. He pushed Dean back down and snuggled back into his side. “We can go back to sleep.”
Castiel wanted it. He really wanted Dean, so he reached out for him as the alpha climbed onto the bed. Dean slid his hands under his back, hoisting him up enough to carry them both to the head of the bed. He laid Castiel down gently against the pillows, looking deeply into Castiel’s eyes, silently asking the question of if he was ready. Castiel nodded enthusiastically, wrapping himself around Dean to bring their bodies as close as he possibly could.
“That’s a really great mindset,” he said. Dean stared at him for a second and smiled. He opened his mouth to speak again when the principal’s door opened and principal Harvelle called Dean in.
“All good?” Dean asked, standing up and looking at Cas’s face. Cas nodded and Dean smiled. He reached back into the nightstand’s drawer and brought out a smaller length of rope to tie his hands up with, finishing in no time.
“What do you do about your heat?” Alfie asked quietly, “I do not mean to be so crude or pry into business that I do not belong in, except I had a mate, once, too, and now that he is gone my heats are almost unbearable.”
Dean loved Castiel. It was plain and simple. He was totally, completely, profoundly in love with the omega. He loved spending time with him and talking about everything they could think of. Dean would do utterly anything for Castiel, and he would do it with love in his heart, a smile on his face, and the words
Castiel latched onto that voice and focused on it with everything he had, because it held remnants of Dean’s brightness in the words.
Dean blinked at him in surprise, and then sprung into action, tearing his shirt to get the piece of clothing off. Castiel couldn’t help but giggle as Dean finally shared the same urgency as he did.
Dean grabbed Castiel’s hips and pulled him down as he thrust forward, and the way Castiel clamped down on him and cried out as he orgasmed just made Dean smile because it proved his point.
“I knotted you last night. Twice,” Dean said, grunting as Castiel ground down in his lap. “It’s not—
“Let’s go,” Dean whispered, and leaned down to wrap his arms around Castiel. “Fly us home, sweetheart.”
Back on that fateful day when Dean first saw Cas, something in him snapped. He was drawn to the boy stumbling across the ports’ quad and he wasn’t entirely certain why…perhaps it had something to do with just how much Cas was calling out—seemingly to the heavens—for someone to love him. And with so many years of no one—not God or angels or whoever may or may not be up there—answering? Cas’s longing began to just seep out of him. From every pore in his skin he oozed of the want to belong. It reached out to Dean—to his own want to have someone love him, too. They were both reaching out for something or someone in the dark. And in that reaching they caught each other. That was a miracle and a blessing if Dean had ever seen one.
Cas smiled, saying, “Me too.” He cupped Dean’s face. “I don’t want you to disappear into our relationship either.”
“Sure,” Gabe laughed. “But anyway, they don’t know that and it’s their job to find wealthy men. If it makes you feel any better, he doesn’t seem to be reacting to it. He seems like he’s ignoring them, Cas.” He shrugged.
Amara sighed and rolled her eyes. “Fine. You got me.” She stepped forward into Castiel’s trailer and crossed her arms. “I couldn’t care less about Castiel’s outstanding performance. What I care about is what’s mine. I’m here to take back what’s owed to me. I’m here to
Castiel grabbed the water handed to him and swallowed both pills in one big gulp of water, ignoring Gadreel’s question, because no. He didn’t want to talk about anything that had happened yesterday. True mates weren’t a thing, and Castiel had just latched onto Dean because he had helped him. Nothing more.
They didn’t talk while Dean settled himself between Cas’s legs, busying himself with checking out the cut Ava had given him when he had settled in his normal spot.
Dean pivoted slowly to look at him with a menacing smile on his face. “We’re going to give you what the people paid for.” He picked up the Heretics Fork and walked back over. “It’s getting late though.”
His entomology class was proving to be fascinating as they continued their unit on bees, and Castiel almost went down a video rabbit hole of learning all about bees. The math class he was taking was easy, numbers had always been a friend to Castiel. His psychology and philosophy classes gave him a new appreciation for life after he’d finished the work for them, and his economics class gave him a headache even though he liked learning about micro and macroeconomics.
“What-?! What’s wrong?” Gilda asked, “Oh my god!” Cas clutched onto Dean’s hand, whimpering for Dean not to leave as he was laid down on the examination table. Gilda grabbed a  pair of scissors and cut Cas’s shirt off. “What happened?”
“Sorry,” Castiel said distractedly, and Dean laughed under his breath as he climbed back onto the bed.
Dean smiled, “Okay, baby,” he said calmly. “You’re doing so good for me, Cas. You’re almost there, just a little more.”
“Cas!” Dean yelled, enveloping the young man in his arms and holding him tight. “I got you, baby, I got you!” Cas buried his face in Dean’s chest and clutched onto the pirate. “I got you.”
“Have you talked to Dean about this?” Gilda asked. Cas shook his head, closing his eyes as a slight breeze rustled his hair.
“How long until your knot goes down?” Castiel asked, panting as Dean started kissing down to his neck.
“Okay,” Dean agreed, making quick work of oiling up his manhood and pushing in right away. Cas sobbed, letting his head fall back onto his pillow. “I love you, Cas,” Dean whispered. “You’re perfect, my angel.”
“Oh, we are gonna have some fun tonight, Cas,” Dean said, quickly moving through his house to his bedroom. He dropped Castiel onto his bed when he got there, pulling his shirt over his head before coming up to settle over Castiel. “So, tell me Cas, what’s your favorite part of foreplay?”
A little over five months after Dean had left, Cas’s father went on another trip to Crowley’s kingdom. He spent a few weeks there, and came back madder than ever. Michael locked himself in his study right after he got back. He took a week to be alone with himself and didn’t let anyone but the maids come in with food or drink.
“If you’re still interested, I think you’re ready,” he said, uncertainty tainting his words. Cas’s heart swelled for the man.
“Oh,” Castiel whimpered, “Yes.” He pushed back to meet Dean’s thrusts, begging Dean, “Alpha, faster!”
Dean looked him up and down, his eyes stopping at his groin for just a second before going back up to his eyes. “If you want. Do you want me to?”
“Of course, father,” Cas answered, no trace of emotion in his voice. He looked up at the woman on the stand now and jotted down key details of her testimony and anything that didn't line up with what had already been said by previous witnesses.
utterly moronic of him to think he could help when his siblings were who they were. Hell, last night was just like training exercises their father used to put them through. Almost dying was just a regular family game night activity for his siblings.
to get up. He didn’t want to break eye contact because that meant moving away and the divine scent invading his nose would dissipate. It meant the feeling rushing through Castiel would stop, and Castiel didn’t want that. It was like electricity was wrapping around his heart and squeezing something exciting and invigorating into his blood. He hadn’t felt something like this ever, he thought, and it caused Castiel to just stare at the man beneath him.
“Please fuck me,” Cas whispered, blushing slightly at the dirty word. “Please, I want to feel your cock inside me.”
Castiel knew he needed to tell Dean about them. And he had to tell him soon. Dean was invited out by the two each week. Furthermore, Castiel knew they only invited Dean because they had a fifty-fifty chance of Castiel coming, too, and so far, he had been able to get out of going each time, but he couldn’t keep it up for much longer…
“Who’s fault is that?” Cas teased, moving down to straddle Dean’s thighs. He grabbed the oil from Dean’s outstretched hand. Dean put his hands behind his head for support as Cas tugged his drawers off.
Dean flung the door open and snapped, "What?!" He stood there with his shirt off and only his leather pants on. Cas couldn’t see who it was, but he knew the voice: Benny.
Castiel pushed his bag away and let his head fall into his hands. “I have this medication I take for my nerves, and I can’t find it. I’ve been taking it since I was a kid, so I don’t know what will happen if I stop.”
“Nice, Jo. Just perfect,” she called over her shoulder, “I’ll be in my room, plotting my next assassination.”
“Well, wait, maybe I can walk with you for a bit?” Dean said, and Castiel spared a look up. He was greeted with this hopeful look on Dean’s face. It was completely disarming and Castiel felt this odd sensation in his stomach he realized had to be butterflies. “I mean, you look a little unsteady on your feet and I wouldn’t want you running into someone else,” Dean joked. Castiel blushed and looked down at his feet. “I could walk you to your next destination?”
“I wouldn’t change a thing about what I’ve done to keep Sam safe,” Dean said. Castiel’s vision went blurry from unshed tears and he slid down to sit on the floor with his back against the door. “And I would do it again and again to keep him safe. Cas, I would do anything to keep the omegas I care about safe.”
The kid, Dean, shrugged and got comfortable in his chair. Castiel averted his eyes at first but found he was unable to stop from looking back at Dean. He was insanely beautiful to the point where it just wasn’t fair. Each time Castiel looked back at him, he knew he was pushing his luck at not being caught, but he couldn’t help it.
Dean kissed Cas quickly before sitting up and smiling at his angel; he didn’t do anything for a while as his eyes went from Cas’s face to his torso, down his legs and back to his face again. “You’re so beautiful.”
“Of course, Cas,” Dean said and leaned down farther. Cas got the hint and stood up on his toes to connect their lips. Dean was gentle and sincere in his kiss. Cas opened his mouth and tried to push his tongue into Dean’s mouth, but Dean pulled away.
“Don’t move,” Dean instructed. Cas nodded, still not able to close his mouth. “Let yourself settle down.”
“Fine.” Castiel looked at Dean and waited for him to look back, but he stood next to Amara and stared straight ahead. He tried to do something with his scent to get Dean to notice him. The way Dean was acting scared Castiel and he felt like a fight was coming on. He turned away from Dean and looked straight at Amara. “What do you want?”
“What?” Fear flashed through Cas’s eyes. “Is Dean alri—” he cut himself off, schooling his features again. “What are you trying to tell me?” He asked.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and turned to lean back against the door. If omegas and betas didn’t want Dean, there wasn’t anyone left but… “Was your first time—”
“Yes,” Castiel said, and if Dean were a worse person he would’ve commented on how turned on Castiel sounded or how he could detect hints of slick in the air, but he wasn’t that much of a jerk.
“How did you get him to smile at you? He never smiles at anyone but me,” She said, wiping away the tears and snot on Ben’s face.
“Why don’t you you just tie them to the bed posts?” Cas asked, gripping onto the pillows by his head to keep himself from reaching down and touching himself.
dismissed Castiel even though he had powers, too. They didn’t even stop for a second to think that maybe, just maybe, he was just as involved in the fucking apocalypse as they were.
“What do you think you’re doing!?” Crowley yelled, crying out as he fell forward. Cas had a hard time keeping himself from laughing at that.
“Bossy,” Dean mumbled, smiling as he added two more fingers at once. Cas’s eyes went wide and his mouth formed the perfect
Castiel was carrying Claire while Ben clung to the belt loop of his pants, and Emma was talking animatedly with Dean’s student.
Dean groaned and stopped his hand. He grabbed the oil and quickly oiled his cock up before lining his head up with Cas’s entrance. “You can come,” Dean started, “But if you come, I’m not stopping until I’m finished.” Cas pouted while he tried to push himself down onto Dean’s thick length. He wanted more than anything to be filled up by the pirate. “Do you understand?” Cas nodded eagerly, whining loudly. “Nod your head if your color is green.”
The pirate kissed Cas’s neck, soft and tender, before responding. “I love you, too, Cas. I love you so much.” He was breathless and his thrusts getting faster and more agonizing.
Dean's birthday has come around and he's agreed to celebrate it for the first time in over ten years. Cas and the crew have something special planned to show Dean that everything he ever knew about birthdays is wrong.
“Thank god for fairy magic,” Benny said. He and Sam sat down, not looking at Cas as they each took an oar and started rowing.
When Castiel finally started relaxing down, Dean slowly lowered him back to the bed. Castiel’s chest heaved and he let out these harsh, stuttering breaths that made Dean’s chest swell with pure pride.
“What’s that?” Cas sighed. He gasped and convulsed forward as he continued to rock his hips lazily against Dean’s. “Fu-uck!”
“Oh, my gods!” His arms gave out as Dean fucked right into his prostate; the only thing holding him up was Dean. Cas gasped for breath as Dean continued to move his hips hard enough that Cas was sure he wouldn’t be able to sit right from the way Dean’s hips were slamming into him.
“I’m fine,” Dean rasped, smiling nervously at his friends. “I’m just excited for dessert.” Charlie gave him a weird look, but left him alone to sit and go over what he’d seen when Cas reached over.
They stared at each other for a moment, bathing in the affections of the other. But that moment ended much too soon for their liking. It was interrupted by Dean’s alarm going off. Alerting them both that they needed to get going.
me there. I fought so hard to get his disgusting hands off me but I… I couldn’t — he wouldn’t stop!”
, so all they really wanted was me on my knees,” Dean said, “Only until I hit my growth spurt and got taller and bigger than all of them. Then they stopped paying attention to me.”
“He told my dad to name a price. My dad did and… And I was his. Just like that...” Dean said, inhaling a shuddering breath. “The next day I was on a ship headed out to the man’s castle. I was alone and the man’s crew leered at as if I were a piece of meat. I was so scared. No one would explain to me what I was going to be doing for the bastard. I thought I’d just be a whipping boy or a fucking stable hand. But no,” Dean let out an almost hysterical laugh. “No that’s not at all what he wanted me for.”
ordinary compared to me,” Castiel said, debating where he should fly himself and Dean to in order to protect Dean from his family. Cancun or the Amazon were his top choices at the moment…
“For the past few months, dad’s been acting weird. He’d been withdrawn, unresponsive to me, and has been in his study at all hours of the day and night. He—”
And the fact that Rachel didn’t attend these after parties anymore didn’t bother him as much because he didn’t do anything wrong. There was a period of time where Castiel blamed himself for Rachel hanging out with them less and less, but Dean and ultimately Gadreel, really, we’re the ones to snap him out of it. Now, it was usually just Gadreel and him spending a few hours together after a fight. And Castiel really didn’t want it any other way.
“I helped your mother give birth to... You. And the moment I saw you?” Dean inhaled deeply. “I was gone. On you. I felt the deepest pit inside myself filled. I felt such an overwhelming sense of peace and safety not even being in my mother's arms could recreate. All I wanted to do was protect you, it was the only thing going through my mind as I looked at you,” he said, “and I cannot say for sure, however if I had not looked into your eyes that day... I probably would have turned out like my father.”
“You want me to touch you?” Dean whispered into Cas’s ear. “You want me to take your cock in my hand and make you come?”
“Have you been listening?” Michael asked, coming over to stand in front of Cas. A break had been called during one of Heaven’s meetings and Cas was supposed to read back the notes he'd taken while everything was in session.
“Fuck,” Dean groaned, giving one final thrust before pulling out and smiling. “Me too, angel, me too.”
“You should be afraid of me!” Dean yelled. He refused to look at Cas. “You should be afraid of me… The things I do when I carry out my deals… You have no idea how merciless I am.”
“Dean,” Cas whispered into his pillow later that night. He was staring at the stone Dean gave him and praying to someone — anyone, at this point — to bring Dean back as soon as possible. The feeling of being alone was getting to be too much at the moment.
“I do not know what's gotten into you as of late, but I like it. You're much more compliant with how you should be acting as a Novak. Well done,” he said, giving Cas a smile before getting out and gliding into the house. Cas sat in the carriage for a moment, feeling tears threaten to fall, before he got out.
Dean smiled wider, “Okay,” he whispered and moved to sit down on the edge of Cas’s bed as he started telling Cas about one of the old pirate stories that he’d heard when he was little.
Castiel giggled and pulled Dean into another kiss that was more smiles, teeth, and tongue than a true kiss. Dean wasn’t complaining in the least, though, because if Castiel wanted it, he would gladly give it.
“Gramercy, Jonah, Elijah,” Dean said to the guards, and then Castiel was left alone with him. He snuck a peak up and was slightly relieved to see that King Dean had his back to him. It gave Castiel the chance to seek an escape route in the case something went wrong because… He wasn’t sure about Dean, still, and even if Dean had made the kingdom a better place, that didn’t mean Dean was a saint.
Castiel turned to where he heard his sister’s voice from, but instead of Meg he saw his father. It took Castiel by surprise and he froze as fear coursed through him, but then the image faltered and Castiel saw Gabe. Gabe was trying to use his powers to distract him.
screams I’d ever heard before. I didn’t realize that I’d been the one screaming until months later when I woke up from a coma. I was telling one of the nurses what happened and she piped in that it had probably been me or Rachel screaming. I knew it had been me—my voice making that
time devising ways to make you pay for the suffering you’ve caused,” Dean said, and at the look of pure fury and hatred in both Jess and Andrea’s faces, even he had to cower a little.
“Yeah, I can feel you,” Dean said, “Come on, Cas. One more and I think you’ll be ready. You’re already very…” Dean inhaled shakily,
Castiel gasped sharply, sobbing a little as he begged, “No! Please!” Dean looked back up at his omega. “Oh, please, Alpha!” Castiel chewed on his bottom lip. His eyes fluttered as Dean gently dragged his nail across his rim and he cried out, “Alpha! Please!?”
“I love you,” Dean breathed out, not moving more than an inch away from Cas’s lips. “I love you, Cas.”
“Do we need to show you the tape again?” Jo snapped, and Castiel had to stop himself from rolling his eyes at her usual abrasive self. “You all saw what happened.”
Dean had been nothing but gentlemanly the entire time Castiel had known him. And not just to him, but to everyone. Omega, beta, alpha, servant or lord, peasant or knight, merchant or noble, every single class or designation, Dean treated as he would a friend. Castiel didn’t understand how a single person could be so... Perfect.
“Don’t I know it,” Dean said, making the group laugh and Cas bury his face farther into Dean. He tuned the four crew members out and inhaled Dean’s scent. You would think he’d smell like fish or salt — something oceany. And while that was somewhat true, Dean smelled more like the leather trousers he always wore and wood after it had rained. It was something Cas found very pleasant.
Dean laughed, “Sounds good to me,” he said and pulled out the picnic blanket he brought. Cas helped him to smooth the wrinkles out before they both laid down next to each other. Dean’s arms around Cas and their legs slotted together in a pattern of
“I have a small vessel I keep docked at an island two weeks south of here,” he said. “As long as you take good care of it, I’d be happy to let you use it for as long as you need.”
“Hard,” Cas said, forcing himself not to blush. “Fast. I want to be able to feel it for days after.”
But then Castiel looked up, and even from where he was, he could picture Dean in the owners box above the seats for the fans. He would be sitting next to Amara, watching this all in worry, because Dean wouldn’t want him to give up, not if he knew Castiel could win. Not if Castiel could do this for them.
Anyway, just an update to where the ending to this fic is gonna be: three more chapters, and then an epilogue. So, we're nearing the homestretch.
“If I did that,” Dean started, taking the other ends of the ropes and tie them in a figure eight. “Then you’d be able to close your legs; this way, because it’s close to the floor, it’ll almost be like your legs are tied down to the bed itself.” Dean lifted Cas’s leg, kissing his ankle as he slid his foot through both loops and then up to his knee. He situated one loop just above his knee while the other just below and then tightened it. “How does that feel?”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas whimpered, feeling heat start to pool in his abdomen. He tilted his head to give Dean more room on his neck and felt the man’s hands come to pinch at his nipples. Cas clung onto Dean as he started to shake and his hips stuttered. “Oh gods!” He felt something explode inside of him and he screamed out Dean’s name.
“Yes!” Cas wailed. He turned his head into Dean’s to kiss him. But, Dean pulled away. He didn’t give any sort of satisfaction to the man beneath him.
“That's what you mean to us, Dean,” Cas said, moving his hands up to tug lightly at the hair on the back of Dean’s head. “That's what you mean to
“Heat aids?” Alfie said quietly, questioningly. Jess looked away and a blush took over her face. She cleared her throat and shook her head to brush Alfie off.
“M-may-maybe,” Cas whimpered. Dean chuckled as he grabbed a pillow, that wasn’t being used and situated it under Cas’s hips
But soon, Castiel knew Dean would start asking questions. And as much as Castiel didn’t want to tell Dean about them, he didn’t want it to get to the point of him asking questions. Castiel couldn’t lie to Dean. Not only that, but he wouldn’t lie to Dean because he loved that man more than anything in the world. Dean was his entire fucking heart, and he didn’t ever want to lie to him. But he knew, as soon as Dean started asking questions, he’d shut down. He’d close himself off and push Dean away.
“Dean,” Cas gasped, “You — oh!—” he moaned. “You need to go. Sam’s right. Sun will be up soon.” Dean groaned, upset, before lifting his head back up to Cas’s and kissing him again.
“Yes, she went mute as soon as I asked about them,” Alfie explained. Ellen chuckled softly and shook her head fondly.
“What?” Cas asked, his throat going dry. It wasn’t a huge secret that Michael had a particular hatred for Dean, but he wasn’t aware that that was the reason Michael wanted Heaven to become part of the Kingdom. That news had him to the point of almost crying again. For once he was glad Crowley was a gigantic dick. “Who told you that?”
Dean leaned back in his chair, an inferno of rage in his eyes as he looked to Castiel. “What do you think?” He asked.
A loud thud sounded. “I do not disagree with you that I am in love with him, but watch yourself,” Dean said, calmly but forcefully, “I made an oath to this Kingdom to protect and serve it. I do not take promises I make lightly. I will not deny that I do try and please Castiel as much as I am able, but I will not let myself be distracted from my duty to the extent you are implying.”
“July twenty-first?” Ruby said, looking down at her documents as a blush rose to her cheeks. “I see no one has asked for the Circle that day and all of my usual staff and vendors are available.”
The next thing his omega had him remember was the Easter carouse Dean threw the week before Easter, and yeah, Castiel had celebrated Easter before with Alfie and a few other kitchen maids, but he’d never seen anything like when he was at the Easter celebration. There had been dancing and skits, mountains of food and drink, and even some of the castle’s servant staff had attended. Castiel’s omega—after Meg had answered his question of why the servants were attending and he’d been told that Dean invited everyone in the castle to holiday celebrations—had puffed its chest in pride that his—
Jo smiled, “Alright. I’ve got some work I’ve got to do. Wish me luck,” she said, tipping her hat and walking out. Another loud crack of thunder sounded; Ben didn’t scream but he scrambled to cover his ears while pushing his face into the crook of Dean’s neck.
“I’d love to meet Sam,” Castiel said, and he really did want to. He wanted to know more about Dean and what he was like growing up, and Sam was sure to have stories.
Castiel groaned and swung his legs over his bed to stand up, grabbing Gadreel’s shoulder to stabilize himself as his vision blurred.
“Lisa, calm down.” Dean rubbed her back, “Why don’t you get a full night of rest, and we’ll go get Ben back tomorrow. I promise.”
“Be quiet, Dean!” Cas said breathlessly as he lined the head of Dean’s cock up with his entrance and immediately sunk down.
“I didn’t even feel you pull out,” Cas said, looking down at Dean’s erection. He licked his lips and reached down to wrap his hand around his own cock. “Gods,” he gasped, arching his back as the feeling of immense pleasure coursed through him. “Dean!”
“Nuh-uh,” Dean said, pulling Castiel down just as he made the motion to sit up. “That would hurt the both of us. You’re not going anywhere.”
The mother cradled the crying child into her, rocking and shushing him. She looked up at Dean with watery eyes. Recognition set into her features and she tensed up. Dean took another step back.
Cas grabbed his things and headed out, smiling at his father's co-workers as he stepped his way carefully to the Novak carriage.
“Really?” Dean asked, and Castiel felt his face heated up and he looked back to the little figurines to hide the blush.
“I’ve already come four times,” Castiel said, moving past Dean. “I think that’s enough to relax me. I’ll be alright.”
“Fas-faster!” Castiel choked out, and Dean’s breathless laugh was too much. Castiel cried out as he came.
“He was scared I wouldn’t be able to control my emotions?” Castiel asked. Before his anger could rise, he felt Dean squeeze his hand. And for the millionth time Castiel couldn’t help but thank whatever was out there that Dean Winchester was part of his life. “I don’t understand why he couldn’t have helped me. I was a kid. I was supposed to throw tantrums. He should have
“What?” Dean furrowed his brows in confusion. “Of course I didn’t! I never want to go a day without you by my side.”
“Cas, you have to understand,” Rachel said, her voice pleading. “He’s the reason the apocalypse is going to—”
“Dean did what he could,” Sam offered. “But he’s not perfect.” Cas’s head turned so his eyes met Sam’s. The anger from before was dulled and instead the only thing Sam could see what hurt. “He never stopped thinking about you.”
“As cheesy as this sounds, I don’t want to hurt you, Dean, but I will,” Amara said, “I can find another you if I have to.”
That voice… Deep and rich and so, so soothing. It made the ache deep inside him lessen, and Castiel found himself blindly wishing for the person that voice belonged to to be the one with their arms wrapped around him, comforting him, whispering encouragement into his ear or telling him a story—he didn’t care! He just wanted to hear that voice.
“Cas! Of course you are! Amara loses hundreds of thousands of dollars when Arkangel’s name appears in the upcoming fights of the week. People don’t bet when you fight because there’s no one in their right mind who will bet against you!” Dean turned away from Castiel just slightly. “Amara is pulling all the pilots she can from her web to throw at you because she’s tired of losing money over you. Your last ten fights have been Amara working her ass off to find a team who can beat you. And she’s willing to do whatever it takes to bring you down,” Dean said, his voice shaking in a way that Castiel was certain he was the only one who would be able to hear it. “After how you told her to go fuck herself in public earlier… She’s done with you and wants you gone. She’s past making you one of her demon deals.”
