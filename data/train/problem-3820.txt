I climb into my car and devour all of the pizza before I even open the door to my room. It was amazing and eased the pain in my stomach instantly.
When we get into the building I drop his hand and he sighs slightly, making my heart flutter. The things this boy made me feel were amazing and terrifying at the same time, I glance at him and roll my eyes which he laughs at. Halfway through his laugh he stops and hugs his torso tightly, grimacing in obvious pain.
*          *          *          *
I nod my head and then shake it, I have told her but I never talked about it. Every time I did I had a panic attack and so did Cas, so I avoided mentioning that day. Bobby just sighs.
"Because he's supernatural, he just went into your head and I couldn't get either of out of it." Sam's shaky voice pipes up from behind me and I watch Dean's face go pale again. I feel the cool metal of a gun being pressed into my skull and I hear Sam begin to talk.
"I'll never lie to you, Dean." At this, he covers his eyes and turns away, Sam frowns and touches Dean's shoulder lightly.
He drops his head and the team leaves. I take a deep breath and sprint towards Dean, almost crying at his bruised and battered body. I crouch down and gently rolling him onto his back, trying not to cry when he groans in pain. I lift him up and he leans heavily on me, he takes a deep breath and whimpers quietly.
I see the medics approach Dean and touch his shoulder, he flinches so violently that he jumps backward into the lockers. The medics mutter soothing words and I see Dean's eyes stare at them fearfully, his bare chest gleaming with sweat and heaving. His eyes are still dull and hollow and I wonder again what the demons said to him to make him so...un-Dean like. The medics continue to mutter and my world starts to dissolve as the painkillers start to knock me out.
"Come on, Dean, was it really just a stress build up or something more? Family don't end with blood boy, you're like my son and I care about ya, so tell me what happened."
"I purposely left this early so we had time to talk this morning. We have an hour before school actually starts so Sam, ask away." We sit in a circle and Dean glares at the ground, his arms wrapped protectively around his torso. Sam clears his throat and begins.
"What did you do, Sammy?" I ask cautiously. He just throws his phone at me with a smirk. I look at the screen and blush profusely, it was a video of me dancing as I sang 'Enter Sandman'.
I look down and see he has no shirt on and there are marks down his body, I can't make out what they are through the tears falling from my eyes. The pain in my torso was beginning to become unbearable again.
"There's this girl in his class, Jessica Moore, and he is absolutely smitten. He talks about her all hours of the day and tells me -in excruciating detail- everything they talked about and everything she does. What do I do? I'm used to flirting with people but I don't know what to do if you actually
*          *          *          *
"Never, good man!" He then laughs and leans down to tickle me again. I end up yelling for him to stop as I profusely apologise. He stops tickling me and I groan at the aftermath of so much laughter.
"I'm fine, Cas. Just a couple of cuts and bruises, nothing to worry about." I shake my head dazed, he's the one that's been beaten and he's calm whereas I'm a mess. I cover my mouth with a hand and shut my eyes tightly, trying to suppress my emotions. I was terrified for Sam and Dean and I was selfishly worried about myself. I feel Dean's freezing fingers hold my face and wipe my tears away. When he speaks it's like he's reading my mind.
"What the hell is an OTP?" Dean whispers to me.
"I know I can trust you, Cas. I'm just...not comfortable with the scars." He shuffles his feet and fiddles with his pants. I slowly walk over to him and quickly glance at his scars, three thin lines down his front and a red, jagged scar on his shoulder. He looks up at me and I smile, cupping his face.
"Dean, please!" Sammy whispers.
I sigh and pull into the motel car park, barely putting my baby into park before Sam scrambles out of the car and rushes inside, claiming he was starving. I groan and rub my eyes, leaving baby's door open as I poke my head inside the door.
* * * * *
"You just gotta take it step by step, and start by talking to Sam and Cas, okay? Then let your daddy over and keep things calm, start with happy stories and when you build a better relationship, then talk about the dark stuff."
I slide his shirt off as gently as possible and gasp loudly at the blood that was drying on his torso, he had two lines down each side of his ribcage with a small one across his sternum. The lines down his side were still bleeding a little bit and underneath the blood lines, I noticed a few dark bruises.
We laugh our way inside and sit down in a private little booth at the back. A young girl walks up and we order our milkshakes. Blue Heaven for me and Death by Chocolate for Dean.
I grab both sides of his face and crash my lips into his. For a second he doesn't do anything, then his arms are wrapping around me and his kissing back with a passion. It feels like fireworks and dizziness, it feels like nerves and fire. It feels perfectly right. My heart thumps and my stomach tightens, I move my hands to the back of his head and curl them through his hair. He rubs a thumb along the line of skin between my shirt and jeans and goosebumps follow his every touch.
"I'm fine, Sammy. Get some rest." I lie through my teeth. I am not okay, I'm shattered inside. The one thing I thought I could control in my life had been violated. And Cas...Cas is bruised and bandaged because of me.
"I'll tell the nurse, but you two have to promise you won't leave, or get upset." His voice is frail and petrified, Sam immediently jumps up and calls for the nurse. A crowd of doctors walk in and look surprised that Dean let me touch him, a police officer follows and Dean swallows nervously before opening his mouth.
"Hows your new house going?" He asks.
And it feels like fireworks.
I dream of peace and love.
Cas glares at me as I go to bite my taco and kicks my shin, which causes me flinch and I end up sticking the taco into my face. This is it for Cas and he bursts out laughing at my stunned expression and taco juice running down my face. I place the taco down and reach for a napkin to wipe the meat off my face and Cas pushes his chair back so he can lean forward in laughter.
I sigh and think about Football to myself, my face softening at the idea of being able to play the game. It helped get my mind off my social anxiety.
"I blame you, Cas."
I wake up before my alarm and lie in the warmth of my bed before it goes off. I sigh and push a foot out of the covers, shivering when it encounters freezing air. I groan and heave myself out of bed, shaking from the cold and hugging myself to keep some warmth.
He stumbles back a bit, his eyes wide and grips my shoulders to stop me from falling.
Groaning, I heave myself out of bed and change clothes, I fell asleep in mine last night and the pants are covered in blood. The shirts fine because it's black, the blood doesn't show on it and I can't bring myself to move it.
The lunch bell rings and Dean grumbles against my lips, I laugh lightly and pull us up. We drop hands as we exit the willow and Dean sends a sly wink at me. I laugh again and we walk off to class, the stupid jocks long forgotten.
I race outside grinning and almost yelp when I step into the cold, I stumble into the car and groan at the warmth inside it.
"I heard the good news from outside the house. Congratulations." We laugh again and Cas comes and sits on my knee, wrapping an arm around me and hugging me tightly.
"You're mine Dean Winchester, not Abbadons, not anyone else's. Mine." He grins at my words and I begin kissing him again, letting all the pent up frustration show through my actions and Dean does the same. We silently comfort each other until we hear a rustling of leaves and a shout.
Until another one of them pushed me into a locker and whispered an insult to me as I hit the floor.
I school my face into neutrality but inside I was a nervous wreck, my palms were sweaty and my heart was thumping wilding. Not the thumping that followed Cas but the thumping of fear. My father raises himself off the couch and starts circling me, something he does before a lecture.
The drive home is completely silent as I brood over my flashback. Occasionally I got panic attacks and couldn't pull myself from memories but normally I'm able to lock it up until I'm alone. I hated when I wasn't in control of myself and when Sammy had to see it happen, he's just a kid, he doesn't need to see me like that.
"Dammit, Cas! I deeply apologise for doing the funniest thing of the evening." He just laughs and leans in to kiss me. He then rolls off and I stick my tongue out at him, a warm feeling in my chest as I watch him high five Lucifer and sit down again.
"Alright sweetie, we only have one team so we're gonna get you ready in the stretcher and then we're gonna bring your boyfriend in next to you, okay? He seems to be physically stable so we'll take care of him later." I nod in a daze and accept the painkillers. My head whips up when Sam bursts through the door.
He smiles against my mouth and sighs.
Then a light touch on my shoulder, an arm around my waist and my feelings calm. A kiss on the cheek and I'm able to think clearly yet be completely befuddled at the same time.
"What would that question be Dean?" He grins at me and holds my hands in his.
"I FIND SAM ALONE! NO BIG BROTHER WATCHING OVER HIM! HE COULD HAVE DIED, HE COULD HAE BEEN KIDNAPPED! BUT NO!" He yells and I flinch slightly, still staring directly ahead.
"C-Cas?" He says, his voice breaking. I see Sam sit up in my peripheral vision but I ignore him instead leaning closer to Dean.
"Dean! Cas! Wake up, dammit! Wake up, it's a dream! Oh my god, where's my phone, I need Chuck."
Another sob escapes my mouth and I take a deep shuddering breath, trying to keep my breakdown quiet. I desperately map my surroundings to calm myself. I was leaning on the wall just outside the kitchen and just down the hallway was the lounge room. The walls were a pasty yellow wallpaper and the carpet was tan and stained. My eyes trace the outline of the walls and notice the many dents in them, how could Dean live like this?
"Fine, fine. But I'm staying here to pull you out, I have a feeling you'll need me." I smile against Dean's chest already feeling drowsy and drift off into a deep sleep, my smile vanishing as laughter follows my dreams.
I dream of Dean, his candy apple eyes, the scattered freckles across his face, his wide smile and his bright soul.
Castiel Novak, my guardian angel, at it again.
I follow his car into the car park and feel my heart sinking in my chest as Sam clambers out of the car and enters one of the motel rooms, waving to Dean with a carefree hand. Dean waves back and pulls out again, spiking my interest. I had never been one to pry into my friend's lives before but Dean Winchester just made me so damn curious.
"C-Cas?" I hear a voice stammer out. I rush over to Dean's side and clasp his hand tightly. He chuckles and rubs circles on the back of my hand soothingly, he coughs and his breath pauses for a second afterwards. I look up and see him grinning at me, then his grin slips and he heaves himself upright, clenching his jaw in pain.
"I didn't quite catch that, Dean. Could you repeat it?"
I run my hands through my hair and take a deep breath.
"You probably didn't know, but Uriel, from your old team? Yeah, he's best buddies with me." I stiffen at Uriel's name and clench my fists tightly.
"Who's blushing now?" I glare at him and we continue the lesson with hushed conversation. The feeling of elation in my chest slowly disappears at the jocks words continue and I try to block them out until Crowley whispers something to both of us.
"Who, what, when, where, why and how. Go" I whisper harshly at him, scared that more than a whisper and he'd close himself off. His brows furrow together and he looks confused.
Bobby leans back, his eyes wide and his face pale, I run a shaky hand through my hair and look down, ashamed.
Where are their parents?
I had just set up my homework for my night off work when my cellphone started ringing. Sighing I pick it up and frown when I see the contact.
"Good evening, table for three? Right this way, please..." I lead them over to a table and hand out menus.
I blink at his thoughts. Their dad told him Dean couldn't do anything properly? My chest aches at the thought of my best friends upbringing. But then something else snags my attention, Sam thought they had plenty of food, which means Dean doesn't tell him. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, trying not to let my emotions show.
*         *         *          *
I sigh as the yellow taxi pulls up in front of us, I was in no condition to drive and Sammy's going to Cas', so I had to call for a ride. I climb in and I try to hide the pain I was in, I pay the driver in advance and fall into silence.
He runs his hand through his beard and looks silently at me, his gaze calculating. I look down and nod but he doesn't stop staring.
Chuck was hugging me.
We pull into the driveway of my house and dad opens the door before I can reach for the handle.
"I'll go first, okay? I have severe anxiety and certain things set it off, like large crowds, people purposely mentioning it and someone yelling at me loudly. At my old school, it got so bad that one night I went to a party and got completely blind." He shudders slightly and I reach up to gently touch his face. He smiles down at me and continues.
She walks right up to Dean and he stiffens slightly until she smiles at him and starts clapping. Dean pulls me next to him and I see his frown as the rest of the class starts applauding, he blushes slightly and we both stand at the front before Charlene leans in.
The football team silently take us to the locker rooms, making sure no one sees us. They drag us inside and throw us onto the floor, quickly tieing our hands up, I shuffle over to Cas and make sure he's okay. He sobs as large hands grab me and force me against a wall.
Come on Castiel, get a grip. He's only one human...granted incredibly hot human...
He looks back up at me through his eyelashes and laughs. That's it. If he isn't gonna the first move then I will.
"I would erase inequality." We both sit there awkwardly for a bit while drinking our milkshakes. I try to think of a question to break the ice, I grin at him mischievously, an idea forming in my head.
The last thing I remember is Sammy's face crying next to me in the back seat.
"Fine, fine! I'm sorry, Castiel for wiping taco juice in your hair."
*          *          *           *
I wake up to an empty hospital room, alone in the hard bed. I sit up and clutch my ribs in pain, groaning I swivel off the bed and grab my crutches, slotting them under my arms. I make my way over to the door and I see shaggy brown hair turning the corner ahead.
I rip my hand from Dean's shoulder and scramble backwards. I stand up shakily and stare open mouthed at Dean, who was casually brushing himself off. I notice the slight shake to his hands though and I gasp when he looks at me and freezes.
Romance, why Dean and I were attacked.
Dean and I stand outside the classroom door, ten minutes late and very scared. It was our first day back since the incident and we were both terrified of the students and the whispers that would follow us. We didn't have to worry about the football team because they had been expelled, every single one of them.
We walk in and all talking stops. We both stand there awkwardly as the teacher welcomes us back, Dean stands in front of me slightly as one of the students walks up to us. I remember her, a small red head who always hung out with the nerdy group, Charlene Bradbury.
"I can't help falling in love with you either, Dean Winchester. What a pair we make." What a pair indeed, the best friends, the broken boy and the fixer, the ones who had found love against all odds.
"You can can't you? Pity you don't have the high to turn to now, imagine how disappointed daddy would be if that happened. We're gonna make your life hell, kid. Just you wait." I look away and swallow my reply, knowing that this was all to get a rise out of me.
The last thing I feel is the steady pulse of pain from my body.
I wait patiently outside of my house for Dean. The cool air bites at my exposed ears and I pull my trench coat tighter around myself. I see Dean's car pull out of his driveway and I begin walking down the street, hoping to work some warmth into my limbs.
I barely register my dad's stunned expression before I grip his wrist and drag him into the hallway, hesitating slightly before letting him in. I call out to Sam softly and wince as he groans when he moves. He stumbles out into the hallway and freezes when he sees my dad.
"I have taco filling up my nose because of you!" Cas just laughs even harder and I notice Sam, Chuck, and all his siblings trying not to laugh as well. I smile evilly and stand up slowly, I make my way over to an unsuspecting Cas. He was still doubled over in laughter and I pull his chin up, stopping his laughter effectively. I grin at him and kiss him, smearing taco filling all over his face, he tries to push back and I move away a bit before I wipe my hand down my face and put in Cas' hair.
I grin and almost launch myself at him, hugging my arms and legs around him like a blanket, he laughs lightly and my heart flutters at the sound. He lays back with me still hugging him and I end up sprawling on his chest, one hand caressing his face, the other on his hip. He chuckles and Sam and my dad set up at the foot of the bed.
"You're late Dean! But I saved your table, computers free as well, just make sure your still watchin' over the people." I nod my head and she leaves. I shuffle over to the desk and sprawl my homework over it, groaning in frustration. At least Missouri let me do my homework on the job, or I'd be failing as well, it was my last year and I was gonna make it count and graduate with flying colors.
"I'm so sorry son, I couldn't get away from the fire, from the heartbreak of Mary. Every time I saw you it was just like she was staring back at me and it drove me insane, I couldn't stay, I had to hunt the thing that killed her, but now I've lost." He sinks into the chair next to me, holding his head in my hands, but I was frozen, so still I almost couldn't breathe. I feel Sam and Cas stiffen at the same time and I knew they were awake, and that they weren't moving in order to protect me.
I feel my heart shatter into a million pieces at the noise and that's when I realised I'd fallen in love with my best friend.
Only then do I notice his eyes, intensely blue. I stare at them for a minute before he glances away shyly. I notice the pink tinge across his cheeks and he suddenly glances back and offers me a small smile.
"A little louder, please?" He grins at me and I groan.
He snuggles into my chest and I gently place him in my car, I pat his pockets to find his phone and unlock it. I scroll through his contacts, calling his Dad, Chuck.
I jerk awake with a frightened cry and scream when my eyes don't immediately adjust to the light, I can hear terrified noises coming from behind me and I blink as Dean's hospital room comes into focus.
"I love you too, Dean."
"The other seventy percent of the time, he's drunk and can't remember a thing. He becomes our commander, not our father. He's strict, rude and arrogant, he shouts orders at us and expects us to be the perfect little soldiers." I laugh darkly at this.
I let out a shuddering breath and tentatively wrap my arms back around him. He rubs my back and I start sobbing again, the hug reminding me of the days that dad came home happy and sober. I fell asleep in his arms.
"I'll always worry, especially when you still have nightmares that bad," I grunt out, my voice deep from sleep. I try to shake the fog clouding my mind but instead end up slightly dizzy. Dean smiles and gives me a small kiss before placing a plate of bacon and eggs in front of me.
"But can you answer my question rather than giving each other goo-goo eyes." I rub the back of my neck and with my other hand squeeze Cas' hand tightly. He returns the pressure and I feel confident enough to tell Sam. I go to open my mouth but the sound gets caught in my throat. I glance down at Cas and whisper quietly.
"Dean," I say softly, crouching down in front of him. He shudders and I touch his shoulder gently which causes him to flinch violently and whip his head up. There are tears in his eyes and his gaze is frantic as he identifies that it's me. He gently reaches forwards and strokes my face in wonder.
"Stop touching him you bitch!" I scream at her and the yelling outside stops briefly, but the banging against the door continues. I mentally urge them to break the door down faster and Abbadon laughs. I look at Dean again and notice him sitting stiffly, Abbadons arm moves and Dean winces slightly, I frown.
The line beeps as my dad hangs up and I lean against the wall, letting my emotions show for just a minute. I slide down to the floor and press the palm of my hands into my eyes, remembering when Dean did the same thing after work. He kept all his secrets so close to his chest and was so selfless that you couldn't imagine anyone hurting him.
"Cas?!? Dean?!? Your phones say you're in here so why aren't you letting me in?!?" Sams frantic voice calls from the door. I hear another loud bang, a frustrated scream, and quiet murmurs before a new voice starts talking.
I smile the biggest smile and skip back down to my chair, pointing Dean into the one next to me. My dad sits down again and Sam leans forwards to shake his hand firmly and offers his gratitude. I see my dad's face light up and the mood at the breakfast table is one of peace and happiness, but I still couldn't look at Dean's face. I couldn't bring myself to see the damage.
"Nothing happened to me Cas, I'm as right as rain." He grins tiredly at me. I roll my eyes at his answer because I know he'll never tell me anything. If the past month had taught me anything, it's that Dean Winchester is not good with feelings.
I smile to myself, this is a good first day so far.
"I'll stay, thanks. Can you come get me in about thirty minutes?" She nods and smiles sweetly before calling out to my siblings. They all pile into my room and Anna bursts into tears, Gabriel curls up next to me and Lucifer just hugs dad. I smile at them, the pain medication kicking in as we all talk about what happened.
A few hours later I frown at the time, that's an awfully long meal. Just as I go to open the car door, Dean comes sprinting out and jumps in his car, speeding off to another destination.
I drive towards the woods and park just outside them, climbing out of the Impala with Cas. Cas walks over and puts a blindfold on my eyes, effectively shutting out the pale light from the setting sun.
"I can't believe your late, Winchester. Now drive me to the woods, ten minutes east." I roll my eyes and mutter under my breath about impatient boyfriends, causing Cas to grin again.
"Please." We both pay and wander out the front door. The familiar tingle of a crush seeps into my stomach and I mentally beat it with a large stick.
When I see tears in his eyes I wrap my arm around his waist, supporting both of us, but my thoughts are scattered completely.
"I'm working on an apprenticeship for NASA if that makes anyone feel better." Ash says from the floor.
I carry him to his bed and take off his shoes and jacket before tucking him in and smoothing the hair off his forehead.
I hear a crack and watch as Deans face screws up in pain and he screams. Everyone else starts to back away, looking terrified of the football team, the people I thought were our friends. Deans scream was one of heart-wrenching pain and I have to lock Sam in the car to stop him from racing to Dean.
Azazel and Alistair let me drop forward and I curl into a ball on the bench, in too much pain to go to Dean. Then Abbadon stands up and I see why Dean was wincing, screaming at her I let all my anger at that one touch out.
I felt the bed dip and suddenly Sam was comfotring me as well, I felt pressure build in my chest and suddenly I was sobbing into Cas and Sams arms. The memories threatened to overwhelm me so rather than fight, I let the blackness consume my mind.
"Hey, reject, how are those Daddy issues going? Crowley here says he has a good hit on him." Azazel's slimy voice filled the air accompanied by a metal ruler to the back of Dean's head. Dean flinched and bit his lip, continuing to stare at the board. I took a deep breath and prepared to talk to Dean quietly when Alistair began talking to me.
Before I know whats happening he's sitting on my stomach and running his hands along my sides, causing me to laugh. He ontinues to ickle me as I gasp for air, tears streaming down my face and laughter bubbling from my throat.
"That's my brother you asshole. Touch him again and I'll rip out your lungs!" I knew I was gonna get my ass kicked but I couldn't stop. I was weak from hunger and exhausted from lack of sleep, but that didn't mean I wouldn't fight back. On a normal day, I could've taken all of them easily, but not today.
"Not perfect, but he's doing okay. He's calmer when you're around, at home he was a nervous wreck. What about you? and don't give me that crap about how you're fine, Castiel told me you're not good with admitting you need help." I smile at how much Cas has told his dad and then my smile drops.
"You too, huh?" I nod and grin at him, which makes him blush. He scratches his chin a bit and then asks another question. I take a long drink of my milkshake, this place did have the best Blur Heaven I've ever tried.
"I'm here because we moved here, I have no ulterior motive. I was born just like you and raised just like a normal person, I pretty much am a human. The only difference is I have the ability to see souls and read minds, but only when I concentrate really hard." Sam blinks slowly and begins to lower the gun, but Dean is still pale although he's warily watching me.
"They hurt Cas, because of me, because they wanted to make me suffer." I blink, that was not what I was expecting at all.
They eventually stop and move back, their black eyes gleaming in the dim light. I sag down when I see Cas, his face bleeding and his body in an awkward position. Abbadon laughs as the football team force me to sit on one of the benches. She swings a leg around and sits on my lap, wrapping her arms around my shoulders.
I pull my sleeves nervously and run a hand along the grease stain on my forearm. Bobby sighs and his eyes turn sad.
"If you had the power to, what human trait or emotion would you erase?" His gaze flickers from my eyes to his milkshake haltingly.
"Alright boy, the easiest problem first. Sammy's crush. Talk to me." I smile at him and he chuckles.
He sits down and starts to inhale his breakfast, I swear I've never seen a kid eat so much! But looking at how much he's started to grow it didn't surprise me.
He wraps his arms around me and glares at Charlie.
"God, I'm giving out so many hugs today, no more chick-flick moments." I make my way over to him and lean in slightly, about two inches away from kissing him.
"Eat," I order him.
I hated school, shoving sweaty, hormonal teenagers into a stuffy building together for 6 hours a day was torture. I managed to use my ability to absorb information while completely zoning out. I look at the buildings and notice the old chairs and scratched desks. Basically, the school was trying to look impressive but the kids were the same as everywhere else, judgmental and arrogant. As Ms Talbot shows us around I watch the students start to file into the building, a few of the girls look me up and down and I give them a lazy grin, easily falling into the popular ass role. It's not that I'm not interested, just that I want a proper relationship this year, not a high school hook up.
"Yes but Caaaaaas! You know I like girls and Black Widow is just, ugh." We both groan and turn to Dean expectantly, watching him grin at us.
"Okay, Sam. But Dean might not open up yet." He nods his thanks and slides into the kitchen, warily eyeing my father. The poor kids been through so much that he was wary even of someone that had helped him. I smile at my dad and he grins back, gesturing towards the plates of bacon, eggs and sausages.
"Let's go."
"I assume you all know about what happened to Cas?" I ask, hating how my voice sounded, frail. I receive nods from everyone.
"Castiel?!?! What's happening! Officer they've been in there for almost two hours, get my son out!" My dad's frantic voice can be heard from the door and I close my eyes. My dad was here to rescue me and Dean. But, hang on a minute.
"I would love to move in with you, Dean." I grin at him and hug him close, holding onto his warmth as we go to sleep. My arm is wrapped around his waist, effectively trapping him against me. I just want to hold onto these little moments forever, the things that make life feel so amazing when they happened, especially after the news I received today.
"When you come visit us, and you will, Dean will explain that hit. Until then, don't you dare die on them Mr. Winchester, they've both been through enough crap and you will not add that on top, understood?" Cas says, his voice hard and cold, before dropping it to a sad whisper.
"WE PASSED, WOO HOO!" we both yell, dancing around each other and hugging excitedly. Sammy walks in with a surprised expression on his face, one that causes me to laugh all over again. He sighs and rips the paper from our hands, looking at the grades. His eyes sparkle and I smile fondly, anything that made him that happy, made me happy too.
I gently pulled him down with me and he curled up in my lap as I leant against the tree trunk, his head was burrowed into my shoulder and his arms were wrapped tightly around my neck. He sniffles and grabs my hair tightly, pulling my closer until I gasped in pain.
I look over at Dean again and notice he's still gazing into the distance, pale as death. I'd lead him over to the car park already and he hadn't noticed that he was standing next to his car. I nudge his shoulder again and start to panic slightly when he doesn't respond, I look around for help but the car park is empty except for a teenage boy sitting cross-legged on the bench opposite us, reading a book.
"He just hit me, that's how he did it." I rub my face with my hands and sigh. My stomach dropping even more when he shifts and tries to hide his grimace. Frowning I reach out and lightly touch the side of his torso, he jerks backward and hisses in pain, but I'm too busy staring at my hand, which had a smear of blood on it.
*          *          *          *
I feel the familiar boil of anger and the new pang of jealousy erupt in my stomach. I try to wriggle away but the movement sends pain shooting up and down my body, causing me to cry into the gag. Abbadon grins and leans back down to Dean again, who just screws his eyes shut and goes completely still.
"Yes, yes, yes! A thousand times yes!" I giggle uncontrollably and feel butterflies soar in my stomach. The willows swaying leaves seemed to swish in time with my erratic heartbeats andI feel pure joy. Dean just laughs and kisses the tip of my nose before we head off to our separate classes.
Comedy, the laughs of the demons as I was beaten.
And everyday I fell in love a little more.
"Yes, he would leave for long periods of time and not leave us enough money. Whenever he got drunk he would sometimes hit us, but never when he was sober." I avoid outright blaming my dad because I still loved him and I knew he loved Sammy and me.
I bump into the corner of the table and quickly manoeuvre around it, trying to keep it between me and the creepy grin on Cas' face. Chuck leans back in his chair and raises an eyebrow, doing nothing to stop Cas' slow approach.
"You have the brightest soul I've ever seen, Dean Winchester." He chuckles lightly and continues to stroke my hair as I fall asleep, letting the darkness take away the pain coming from every part of my body.
It's been...forever since anyone has said that to me, someone that wasn't Cas or Sammy.
The next few hours were spent with me dancing and singing obnoxiously loud to my music while I set up my room. I moved my bed directly across from my door, directly under the window and pushed my desk to the left wall. The rest of the wall was covered in posters and there were books and art supplies thrown everywhere. I grin at my handwork and admire the view from my window, a fairly dirty street on which our house was the big mansion. There were a few dirty motel rooms down the road and a small grocery store on the corner.
I was out before I hit the ground.
"Jesus, Dean. That was almost thirty pancakes!" He shrugs slightly and guiltily looks at his hands.
"What happened to that poor boy, Castiel?" My father says, trying to sound stern but coming out more worried.
"I love you, Cas."
I knew Dean would want me to watch Sam, so that's what I did. Until another crack follows and I watch his eyes screw up in pain and he tries to make himself smaller, at that I begin to stride over to Alistair who is currently whispering something in Deans' ear and staring directly at me.
"So Cas." Dean begins with a sly smile. "You wanna go get those milkshakes now? Sammy's going to a friends' house and we're not doing anything so....?" I grin at him and nod excitedly, elated with my new friend. We race to his car and manage to find the little cafe down the street that claims to have the best milkshakes in town.
We were studying different animal species and their scientific names, the teacher had let us choose pairs and given us an animal to study, it was fairly simple, two weird facts and its scientific family. I nudge Dean and grin at him, almost swooning when he does the same back.
"What happened to him?" He asks, his voice shaking at the sight of Dean like that. The medics rush over to stand next to Sam and apologize for not realizing how upset he was. Sam just glares at them and tip toes over to Dean, calling to him softly. Sam reaches about a meter away when Dean whimpers and tries to move away, only for his bindings to get stuck. Sam freezes and turns to look at the medics slowly, a look of fear on his face.
I just want to make it go away.
I move my head back to position and nod at Sammy, who slips out of the room. whenever dad's drunk he has a shorter temper and is easy to infuriate.
I grip his tightly and rub his back, murmuring soothing words as he cries into my shoulder, this seemed to happen a lot. He tightly grips the fabric of the jumper I'm wearing between his fingers and pushes his head into my shoulder. Two weeks he's been bottling up these emotions, two weeks and he's finally snapped.
"May I have this dance, fine sir?" He giggles and bows back, taking my hand in his.
"Azazel is the demon that killed your mother and he was trying to get rid of me. So he used you as a bargaining chip, he wouldn't hurt you if I handed myself over. That boy wasn't meant to be involved, but I guess demons need fun somehow." I gasp, trying to even my breaths in order to ask my dad a question.
Sam and I wave goodbye to Dean. Dean had requested that we take Sam to hang out with Gabe and Lucifer so he didn't have to sit thought the interviews with him. We climb into the car and make our way to my house, but I have to worry about Dean.
I wake up to Cas' hair tickling my nose, and I smile at the feeling it sends shooting through my body. I blink my eyes open and see Sammy snoring next to me and Cas still sprawled over my chest, like my own personal electric blanket.
"Okay Castiel, lets call the nurse back." They press the button and Meg walks in, her dimpled smile surveying Lucifer briefly. I explain quickly and Meg smiles, handing me my clothes. I awkwardly get changed, trying to minimalise the movement of my ribs and then I grab my crutches and slowly walk out to into the hallway.
"You boys think you can go against me? I told Dean if he interfered again I'd hurt you...and, well, here we are. You're both, hm, off the team. And your life is, hm, going to be, hm, very painful from now on." He forces a fist into my solar plexus and my knees give out at the radiating pain, I gasp for air and Alistair and Azazel leave.
I go to help him when a strong body collides with the back of me and I go flying into the locker, slamming my face onto the scuffed doors. I hear a familiar snicker and turn around to see Alistair grinning at me with a cruel gleam in his eyes. I go to stand up when I hear a hiss from next to me, twirling into a defensive position I see Azazel pushing Dean into a locker by pressing on his ribs.
"Then I woke Cas up and now he's worrying and when he worries, Sam worries. And then yesterday I got a call from my dad telling me he's gonna come visit and how he's now sober. How am I supposed to say no? He knows where I live and if I told him no, he'd break in and probably break Cas' neck!" I take a deep breath and groan.
"Don't ever do that again, okay? We were so worried about you!" I smile softly and hug him until he steps back, he walks around me slowly, something we'd picked up. Whenever anything happened we would circle each other and double check to see what condition we were in. We both knew each other inside out so it was almost impossible to keep secrets, that being said I could fool him easily.
"We're dorks, you realise that, right?'
Candles covered the tables and the couch was pushed against the back wall, where it usually sat was covered with our mattress and lots of pillows. Dean was laying down and humming softly, his body covered in blankets and a basket on the other side of the bed.
I open my laptop up and decide to get to know the area a bit better. I found the nearby library which was a ten-minute drive, two nice looking diners which were called The Roadhouse and Jody Mills Diner, a few auto repair shops, three cafes, my school and about eight small convenience stores. I hear my dads voice from downstairs and wander into the makeshift dining room- aka a cardboard box and cushions.
Sammy is sitting stifly on the couch, his expression fearful as he avoids my gaze, next to him is John. I sniff my surrounding slightly and smell whiskey, I glance back and Sammy and he nods his head slightly, it was our conformation code. I nod back slightly and straighten my back, holding my chin high and staring at a blank spot on the wall across from me.
He immediately leant backwards and grabbed my face, studying me for injuries. My stomach flipped at his care and a blush rose to my cheeks as he kissed my nose. He smiles slightly and manoeuvres so he's leaning against the willow's trunk next to me. He then pats his lap and I obediently lay down with my head in his lap, looking up at his sapphire eyes.
"Instead I see my own son, kissing another boy over the protection of his brother. I couldn't give a damn who you kiss as long as it doesn't interfere with Sam!" He rears his arm back and slaps me across the face, snapping my head sideways and causing me to clench my jaw.
"I come home, expecting a cold beer and both sons. What do I find instead, hm?" He begins softly, his voice laced with malice. As he moves behind me I look at Sammy and see his petrified expression, I jerk my head quickly to the door and he nods in understanding. If dad threw a hit, scram and leave me.
My dad sighs and drops his head into his hands, giving Sam a small smile. I leap out of bed and throw myself into my dad's arms, sobbing as the images of Dean's scared face flash across my mind. He hugs me back and then pushes me towards the bed again, gesturing to the whimpers coming from behind me.
Fantasy, the demons black eyes as they laughed.
"That's horrible Dean! How could your father let you do that?!"
"You're smart, Cas. You'll ace your exams and you'll get into college easily." He hugs me tightly and we make our way upstairs. We pass Kevin freaking out in the bathroom.
Dean wriggles to try and get away but Azazel just clicks his tongue and squeezes harder, which causes Dean to bite his lip and glanced towards the sky. I start walking towards them when a meaty hand grips my shoulder and spins me around so I'm face to face with the sneering Alistair.
"We understand your father has given you legal possession of your brother, Samuel Winchester." I nod and hand the man the papers that I had signed. The man glances at the paper and nods slowly.
"Hello, Dean."
"Please, Cas. He won't tell us what happened, he won't explain why he's so upset. The doctors just want to know the things the demons said." Sam pulls back with tears in his eyes. I give him another one armed hug and sit him down in a chair on the far side of Dean's room, giving him a glass of water and telling him to rest.
I head back to our room to get dressed and hear Dean shout a quick goodbye to Sam and me as he goes to work, taking the extra second to tell me he loves me.
"It's a bit baggy on me, so you can keep it." He gazes at it in wonder and then looks back up at me with gratitude in every line of his face.
He pulls back after about five minutes and wipes his eyes on his jumper sleeve, wincing when his bleeding knuckles rub against the fabric. I wrap an arm around shoulders and pull him up, guiding him towards the Impala.
I take a step back and wince as my back shifts under the hospital clothes. I stop moving, letting my body adjust to the pain radiating from it when I feel a warm hand on my shoulder. I look up and see Chuck smiling softly down at me. He pulls me in for a gentle hug and then hands me a steaming cup of coffee.
"Dean...?" I breathe softly, causing him to jerk upright and cough, surprised. He stands up and walks over to me, the candlelight reflecting in his apple green eyes. He smiles slowly and kisses me, pulling my jacket off. He steps back and places my jacket over a chair before gently grabbing my hand.
"We'll get through it Cas. We just have to be strong, can you do that for the next few classes?" He asks softly. The next classes we were separated and I felt dread seep into my bones at the thought. I hug Dean closely and murmur to him.
He was still ashamed of his scars, the things carved into his back and the lines drawn over his body. A small voice pipes up from the bathroom.
"'Morning Cas, how are ya?" He slurs while rubbing his eyes tiredly.
someone. What advice do I give him?"
Cas grins at me from across the table and I feel a foot rub against my calf, I narrow my eyes at him and he pushes against my toes. I smile and push back, it starts off a silent war underneath the table with Cas and I trying very hard not to laugh out loud.
"Okay, now I've seen you, can I get my crutches and go see Dean? I'm really worried about him." I bite my lip and furrow my brows.
"Ha ha, Cas, very funny. How are the hands?" He waves two bandaged hands in front of my face and I have to tilt my torso to see the road. He explains the injury as I try not to scream at the fact that the shirt just pushed against the wounds.
"Take care of him, okay? I've got to go to class." I nod and Sam shoots Dean a worried look before running to class.
He stares open-mouthed at me and I begin laughing again, this seems to cause a chain reaction and soon everyone is in hysterics. He frowns at me and slowly wipes the dripping taco juice off his face, he then gets up very quietly and I start to back away. Lucifer ooh's dramatically and I see Gabriel cover his mouth with a hand to stop the laughter threatening to spill over his lips.
"We walked into the living room and dad was there, with two more presents and a huge stack of waffles and mugs of hot chocolate. That day we just spent with each other, playing with the new toys we got and spending time as a family. Sammy was so happy, it's the best memory of my dad."
"You wanna catch up after school today? Maybe get milkshakes and work on history?" He blushes slightly and nods slowly, milkshakes it is. I feel giddiness rise in my chest and I know I probably look like a grinning fool, oh well, this was Dean we were talking about.
Ms Talbot said our homeroom teachers would assign our lockers and tour guides for the day. I mentally map my surroundings, a habit I find helps me concentrate. The floors are a grey blue and covered in marks, the walls are a faded cream and the lockers are faded blue. Outside looks nice, green grass and a small forest bordering the perimeter, a small pond reflecting the grey of the sky and benches everywhere. I start to fiddle with my black hoodie and wonder if I would miss the city and my old school. I hear Dean clear his throat and I focus my gaze back on him. He grins and opens the door, bowing dramatically at me.
We talk for a while and finally sign the piece of paper.
"I'll explain later dad, can you please hurry?"
"I said you couldn't ask inappropriate questions, not me."
I swallowed and closed my eyes again, hoping that if I couldn't see everyone it would be easier to talk about. I felt dirty, like a had just rolled through mud and then landed in dirt. But I could only feel fear, nothing else, that's why I needed Cas here, he grounded me.
"I've done something unforgivable, I've done something awful." I feel dread seep into my chest and I inch away from my dad.
He grins and introduces himself.
I'm proud of us, to be honest.
"Goodbye, Dean."
He looked smaller with his shoulders hunched and a shy smile on his face rather than his usual grin. He shuffles over to me and rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, his eyes look into mine and I find myself losing myself in their flawless mix of greens and hazels. Sam clears his throat and we both glance down, blushing furiously. The things this ridiculous boy made me feel were unsettling and exciting.
I felt a lot better after confessing to Dean.
The fabric of his shirt catches on my wrist and I end up pushing it up so I can wrap my arm around him properly. He would never admit that he needed someone to be there for him, but I knew without him telling me.
"Bye Cas. See ya tomorrow." He grins and waves before heading to his home.
He was sitting up with his knees tucked tightly into his chest, his arms protectivly wrapped around them, the blankets pulled up to his eyes, covering his whole body. His eyes were closed and he was shaking slightly. I get another blanket and wander over to the chair beside his bed, frowning at his hunched figure. What on earth did they say to him?
I lean against the door frame of his house and smirk as he fumbles over his words.
He wanted to be a doctor and save lives, he has a cat called Bee, his father is a bestselling author, he has three siblings: Anna, Gabriel, and Lucifer but his cousins all live close by as well. He was the defense for football and loved to draw.
As I walk out, I think about my life.
"I know I haven't been the best father, drunk most of the time or gone. I don't remember much of my time with you at all, but I am sorry, drinking was the only way to blur her face...but I should have been there, Dean. I should've saved the day rather than deal with Azazel, but that doesn't matter now, he went back on his deal."
Sammy laughs with me and we fall onto the couch as a giggling mess. Cas walks in and grins at us.
I shudder and gently touch the still bleeding wounds on my torso, I hadn't told Sammy about them so they weren't bandaged. I would have to do that at school. I turn the pan on, spraying it with oil for pancakes.
A few times throughout the movie Dean gripped my hand tightly whenever they said something really bad to me and I did the same back. In the end, Dean just continually traced circles onto the back of my hand to calm me down. When the teacher flicked the lights back on we quickly withdrew our hands and I almost cried at the loss of contact, although my hand was slightly warmer without Dean's freezing one in it.
"I'm sorry kiddo but you need to learn to take care of yourself. I do look after you, just differently from what most people would do." I feel a pang of jealousy in my chest because I know that if I spoke to dad like that I'd end up with a black eye. Sammy sniffles and notices me over dad's shoulder. His face contorts in anger and he shouts at dad
"I need to talk to Dean seriously, but I need you to be there otherwise it's not gonna happen. He won't tell me jack squat but I'm almost fifteen, I can handle whatever crap he's dealing with." The poor boy looks like a lost puppy, his eyes wide and imploring. how could anyone say no?
His car makes its way out of the decrepit parking lot and onto the main street, heading straight for one of the diners. Good, he was going to finally get some food into his system. He hadn't had lunch for the past two weeks, he's probably been too busy with hangovers.
"Because I didn't know how. My whole life I've locked every emotion away and now I don't know how to let people in. And I'm scared, Bobby, scared that everyone will leave me." I shrug lightly, pretending it's no big deal that no one knows.
He looks warily at my dad and angles us so he's standing closer to my dad. Dad just laughs and pats Dean on the back.
Because her hand was down Dean's pants and I couldn't do a thing about it.
I pulled myself up and slowly made my way to the kitchen while clutching my ribs. I carefully rub the sleep out of my eyes and wander into the kitchen, freezing when I see Chuck sitting there with a newspaper and a coffee. He was so kind and accepting, he helped me without hesitating. He glances up and smiles broadly at me.
We laugh awkwardly and Dean rests his forehead on mine, staring into my eyes. He bites his lip and softly whispers to me.
"Can I get a hand, please? These stupid buttons won't do up and I need to look presentable apparently. His voice his hoarse and rough and it makes my heart break at the emotional stress he's been put under his whole life.
"Of course, Sammy. Now get some sleep, we still have school tomorrow and I can take care of myself." He smiles and heads off to bed. I gently place the ice pack against my torso and let out a sigh of relief at the cool release it brings. I lay back on my bed and let my emotions out, remembering the rest of the memory.
"Dean! How are ya boy?" He asks as he pulls away, I shrug and look down a bit. After the 'incident' Bobby became a second father to me, I can talk to him without having to express my emotions. But I can't hide anything from him either, he's become a second father to a lot of people and he can tell when something's wrong.
"Go on a date with me. A real, proper date." I blurt out spontaneously, caught up in the feel of the moment. He grins at me and nods, his cheeks tingeing themselves red.
*          *          *          *
"Go on Cassie, you can use your angel abilities, we know you can't hurt us with them. Until then, Azazel explains the thoughts these kids are having while we possess them." She smiles and kisses Dean again, digging her nails into the scars on his side, he gasps and she takes the opportunity to deepen the kiss. Dean gags and Abbadon presses her nails in further.
"This is where our father left us and I've been trying to save up for an apartment around here since we got here."
"Will you do me the honour of being my boyfriend?" I squeal (a very, manly squeal) and jump into his arms.
"Where's my brother?" He asks, his young voice loud enough to make everyone freeze and watch the encounter between Sam and Dean. Sam looks around the room and sees Dean still against the lockers with his hand's tied and his whole body shaking. Dean stares directly ahead, tears still streaming down his face as Sam slowly approaches.
"I said you couldn't ask inappropriate questions, not me."
Sam was rocking back and forth, hugging himself tightly and worriedly staring at his brother. His long brown hair was sticking up in every direction and his eyes were puffy and red. His left cheekbone had a large purple bruise on it and just above his eye was a small cut from the ring Alistair always wore.
"My father recently gave me access to our college funds, and I currently have a few jobs that are bringing in the money I need to provide for Sammy. I am going to finish school, and then I'd like to attend the college in this town. But what allegations are there against my father?" I dread the questions to come but I know to keep Sammy I have to answer them.
"Come on Samuel, we got a class to get to." Gave winks at me and drapes an arm on top of Samuel's shoulder, almost having to stand on his tiptoes to reach the shaggy boy.
I scream at him through my gag and struggle to get to Cas, who was sobbing through his gag on the floor, a petrified look on his face. Alistair stands up with Azazel and the both kick Cas in the side, causing him to cry into the gag and hunch over of his knees, his arms pulled back behind him. Alistair laughs and kicks him again, the heavy sound of steel cap boots hitting flesh resonating through the air.
"Hmmm, chicken, lemon, potato and mushroom." He grins and I begin preparing dinner. Sammy walks in and smiles at us.
"I'm proud of you, boy." I froze, my breath catching in my throat.
But he also wore a mask of arrogance. A mask that even fooled me into believing he was the idiotic stereotypical jock, even when he started working himself into the ground. A muffled sob escapes my mouth, not even Sam knew Dean's hard work. He thought Dean hung out with the football team every night, Sam didn't know Dean had three jobs.
I chuckled at syrup dripping down his chin and get up, ruffling his hair as I move to the door.
"And no. I'm not ready but I'll fake it till I make it. How are you, Sam? Have you had breakfast?" He smiles sleepily at me and nods.
I slowly walk forwards and hand him the glass of water, he smiles at me and reaches out with a shaking hand. He takes a small sip and I hand him the towel,  furrowing my brow in concern. What did he dream this time?
"Sure, but only if when we meet outside of school, it's with milkshakes involved." He replies with a grin. The breath leaves my lungs and I find myself nodding, his grin was irresistible. I flush a little after a realize what he said. Was Castiel Novak flirting with me?
I finish singing into his ear and he grabs the back of my neck, pulling me down for a kiss.
"You. The infamous Dean Winchester. Are afraid of heights?" I snort loudly and begin cackling again. He rolls his eyes while trying to control his laughter.
I think about who to call when I remember Dean's little brother Sam. He would still be at school since Dean was driving him home, my head snaps up to look at the teenager on the bench and almost cry when I recognize the shaggy brown hair.
"Dean's getting changed, they're letting him come home today. They have to conduct a whole bunch of interviews but your dad managed to let them all happen at home." I smile at him and he leads me back into the room.
Abbadon huffs and touches Dean's elbow, I see his eyes widen and then his face smooths into a mask once again. He turns around and I watch carefully, yes I was being overprotective but Abbadon had just about been with every guy in the school. Abbadon leans forward, giving us the perfect view of her chest and then twirls her fiery red hair around her manicured nails.
"I have an announcement to make." Everyone ooh's and Jo wolf whistles.
"You're so smart, Sam. The smartest kid I know, so do something with that, okay? Always keep fighting and look after Dean will ya? I don't know what else he's been through, but look after him." Sam nods and crawls off the bed, hugging dad tightly.
He looked smaller with his shoulders hunched and a shy smile on his face rather than his usual grin. He shuffles over to me and rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, his eyes look into mine and I find myself losing myself in their flawless mix of greens and hazels. Sam clears his throat and we both glance down, blushing furiously. The things this ridiculous boy made me feel were unsettling and exciting.
"Well, Cas lets go start our day."
2- act like a convincing stupid jock
I shake off the epiphany and instead rush him to the car and slip into the driver's seat, I look back and see Sam has Deans head in his lap and is crying softly. He strokes Deans forehead and murmurs words to him quietly while I drive to their house.
I hear a noise from the bathroom and stumble towards it, rubbing my eyes tiredly. I look around dazed until my eyes focus on Dean. He's pale, sweating and crying into the toilet, dry heaving and shaking.
Dean's POV
"Are you alright, Cas?" I nod at him, trying not to show how much the punch actually hurt me and how much it hurt to breathe. If Dean could deal with all of his injuries I could deal with one tiny bruise.
"Great, I really like it here, you?" He shrugs and the teacher walks in. I frown at Deans attitude, he's not good at talking about himself, but that makes me even more determined to get to know him. I've only ever felt this way with a girl at my old school, April, and that did not end well at all.
"Please, De. I deserve to know!" Sammy's heartbroken expression is what finalizes my decision. I feel Cas' hand on my own and I look at him surprised, my heart thumping wildly in my chest. I can feel the blush creeping up my face as he nods at me and smiles gently. I take a deep breath and summarize without details.
My heart plummets and I grab his wrist, leading him to the bathroom next to the janitors closet. That was a bruise on his face and I wasn't there when he got it, I look back in worry and see him with a clenched jaw and a gaze fixed on the floor in pain.
"Good, Dean, here's your second serve of pancakes, eat up." I see Sam's grateful expression in the rear view mirror and Dean's eye roll out of the corner of my eye. I chat to Sam about books as we drive to school and Dean eats his maple covered pancakes with a barely controlled hunger. We pull in and Sam runs off to his friends while Dean finishes his pancakes.
"Alright," I reply. "First off, there's Lucifer. Yes, he is named after the devil, no he is not completely evil. He has this slight obsession with mythology, particularly the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Then there's Anna. She is very self-righteous and slightly rebellious. She once wanted to defy our old school's principal so she blew all the lights in the school building. Then there's me. Then Gabriel. He absolutely loves candy and will play tricks on anyone and everyone he meets."
Claire and Ben race ahead of us, their chubby legs making it difficult to run straight.
"Hey, De. Come on, you gotta snap out of it okay? Just focus on my voice, yeah? Just listen to me and mimic my breathing." His voice is perfectly controlled and I wonder how many times he's said this to Dean. I scoot away a bit and take a deep breath, allowing my angelic ability to rise. I look at Sam first and see his soul burning in fear and worry, pulsing angrily out of concern for his older brother.
"It's only been the l-last year o-or so but I-I had to...to...ugh." I take a deep breath and rub my face, trying to escape more memories.
"Dean?!? Are you in there?!?" A frantic voice calls from the door. Not long after loud knocks can be heard, along with hushed voices and dogs barking. The demons in the room freeze and I almost laugh when the person speaks again and I recognize it.
"Why'd you stand up for that freak, Winchester?" Azazel asks. cracking his knuckles.
"You could, you know, move in if you wanted to. You practically live here already so, there's no pressure or anything but if you wanted to. I mean I would love you too, but it's your choice-" He cuts off my babbling by kissing me passionately.
"Castiel Novak, what ungodly hour do you call this?"
"We'll get through it Cas. We just have to be strong, can you do that for the next few classes?" He asks softly. The next classes we were separated and I felt dread seep into my bones at the thought. I hug Dean closely and murmur to him.
He shuffles the papers on his desk and quickly scribbles something down before dropping them and rubbing his eyes. He sighs and looks at me, resting his head on his hands and leaning forward.
"Dean!" She says with a grin "How've ya been? Can you pop on your uniform and get bustling, tonight's a busy one." I smile falsely and start work waiting tables.
"Yeah, yeah. I know, it's stupid but come on! How does being up high not scare you?" I just shake my head and wipe the tears from my eyes.
He remembers his kids' graduations.
I had been through terrible times, and amazing times and no matter what, I had family. Friends.
Faster, I urge the memory. Move along.
And I loved every second of our story.
Damn, he was perfect. Full lips and candy apple green eyes, a couple of inches taller than me I reckon and really toned. But unfortunately he probably wasn't boyfriend material, he looked like a stereotypical jock.
"Fairly boring question but what is your favourite colour?" I twist the straw through the thick blue milkshake.
"What do you want to know Cas? Ask away." I place a hand on his shoulder and inhale sharply when he flinches at the touch. I wasn't used to this broken Dean, I knew him as arrogant and over confident, not shy and sad. I clear my throat and ask the questions that have been in my head all day.
"He doesn't Dean. Sure he's traumatised and a little scared, but he told me that when he's around you, that disappears. As for the rest, you are surrounded by people that care about you, whenever you feel lost or scared we're here to comfort and ground you." He smiles and wipes his eyes with the back of his hands.
"Dean, you'll get your ass kicked by the entire football team!" I laugh and ruffle his hair, pushing him towards Cas. He looks back terrified and I glance at Cas. Pointing at Sam, Cas nods and makes his way over.
"When was the last time you ate?" He swallows and mumbles something under his breath, avoiding my eyes.
"That two years ago you would've accepted and now your blushing so hard I could fry an egg on your face." I giggle into my hand and Dean just rolls his eyes at my antics. He leans closer to point at one of my questions and I blush as his hand touches the inside of my leg, he leans back grinning before whispering back,
"We gotta be home in ten for the first interview, Dean." I visibly see Dean's shoulders sag and I pull his chin up, he smiles at me but I can see the sadness in his eyes. We walk out, me on crutches, Dean limping with every step and Sam soon joins us.
"Evening brother the names Benny" I smile at him offer my hand in return, noticing his football jersey and athletic build, I'm guessing he was a jock. I introduce myself and Benny grins at both of us.
"Dean, ya idgit, you need to talk to explain." I rub my face and scratch the back of my neck before clearing my throat.
"Byeeeeee! See ya after school!" I sing loudly the next morning as I walk out of the door and hop into the family car. I get to see Dean again today, that thought puts a smile on my face again. I hope we're friends cause I would love to be, I mean, anyone with a soul that pure is trustworthy.
"What did Dad mean when he said to ask how you'd gotten quick money?" His question feels like a blow to the stomach. I jerk back and begin to scramble away, only stopping when Cas places a comforting hand on my shoulder.
Groaning inwardly I try not to fidget with my ripped jeans, the ladies at the front desk were routinely stamping their papers and tapping their manicured nails on the desk.
I push through the willow leaves and see him repeatedly punching a tree, his screams turning into sobs. My heart breaks at the sound and the realization that he wasn't coping very well with the bullying. I touch his shoulder and he turns around, his blue eyes bloodshot and his cheeks red and puffy. I look down at his hand briefly and see the blood pouring from his knuckles before he sags into my arms.
Hugging me like he cared.
"I'm good, can I ask a favour?" I ask, my voice wavering.
"So your first day went well, I assume?" I nod vigorously and describe each class to him, finishing with an excited yell about making the football team with Dean Winchester. This was what I loved about my dad, you could to him about anything. I tap my fingers absentmindedly on the black dashboard and examine the scenery passing by my window but I can't help but compare the green trees to Deans' eyes.
I hear a shout from outside and groan, heading over to the door of the bustling diner once more.
"Why didn't you tell me, boy?" He asks, his voice wavering. "All this time, I never knew- never even considered. Dean, why didn't you tell anyone?" I laugh softly, the look of horror on his face etched into my mind.
"It's okay, Dean. We'll figure it out, I'll help you, okay? We're best friends, that's what best friends do." I pull back and instead hug myself. How could anyone do that to such a sweet, selfless person? Dean deserved better, and so did Sam. Speaking of Sam I could hear his voice yelling, looking at Dean I saw his fear filled expression for a split second before it changed to anger.
"Dean is more of a father than you are! He's the one who raised me!" I inhale sharply and gulp, my hands started to shake uncontrollably. For a fourteen year old I had practically raised Sammy, but the way he phrased it I knew I was gonna get my ass kicked. Dad stiffens at his words and slowly turns to face me and I knew what he saw. A blond boy starting to fill out his body, shaking like mad and deathly pale. He stalks over to me and grips my hair, pulling his face close to mine and growling
Next up was the scrawny kid trying out, Crowley did the same thing and the poor kid went flying with Crowley landing on top.
"It's a bit of a weird one but being defenceless. Like, not exactly knowing I can't defeat something but circumstances meaning I can't even try. Like being tied up or someone that needs help not letting me help. It scares and frustrates me." I glance down briefly before looking back up at Dean's surprised expression.
"Dean." He sighs contentedly, his voice never fails to amaze me. His brows furrow as he glances between me and Sammy.
"This is why I only keep you for entertainment, you don't do any work!" I laugh playfully and he shuffles his feet across the floor, I stop instantly and tilt my head at him wonderingly. He clears his throat and raises an eyebrow
"Crap, I've got a shift in fifteen. Bye guys, see ya later." We wave her out the door and soon everyone leaves, I hug Cas tightly and then walk into the kitchen, pulling out random ingredients from the shelves.
"Just, remember you aren't alone Cas. We're all here for you...and Dean." He smiles again and Dean limps into the room, his shaking fingers trying to button up his shirt. He looks up and grins at me, his jeans back on and his blue flannel resting on his shoulders.
That lasted maybe twenty minutes. The time it took for Dean to start flinching at the things being physically and verbally thrown at him. I had heard the murmurs throughout the class and I knew they were being said to us but I continued to ignore them until Dean reacted.
"Oh thank god! The tension between you two was crazy, oh Gabriel owes me twenty dollars." Then his words sink in and my ears tinge pink.
I woke up on the couch with an old blanket covering me and a new shirt on. I sit up and wince at the ache in my rib, I remembered the events that had unfolded last night. I shivered at the cold that usually accompanied me and wished for another hug that meant something.
"I'm worried about Cas, he hurt his hands real bad yesterday and I want to know if he's okay." That was true at least, I was worried about Cas' breakdown last night. Sammy nods understandingly and I press the car horn outside Cas' house, my mood lifting the second I see him.
"Do you want to get an ice pack?" He whispers while evaluating my face. I shake my head and he leads me to class. Where the same routine as yesterday continues.
Sams grip on my elbow was tight enough to cut off circulation but the expression on his face caused me to swallow my protests. He pulls me into the lounge room and spins around, his face pulled together in worry, fear, and wonder.
I smile as the image of Sammy's toothy grin and chubby cheeks appears in my head. After that, the session went a lot smoother and we organised another date to catch up. She says goodbye and I lay down on the couch, groaning as the remote hits my back. I hear the door rattle and Sammy runs into the living room, his eyes wide and his face red.
He remembers the nightmares for years afterwards.
"I dig the hair." The table erupts into laughter and Dean squeezes my hand harder, letting me know that he was acting again.
Two weeks and I still couldn't call Dean mine in public. It was driving my crazy. The words had taken their toll on me and now I was screaming in rage and pure hate.
Bobby nods slowly and twiddles with the pen in his hand as I blush slightly. I hated dumping my problems on other people but Bobby might be able to help me fix them.
Smiling, an elderly Castiel softly grips the hands of his children. His chest wheezes with each breath and the machines keeping him alive beep sporadically. Claire sobs beside him and Ben quietly comforts her, but tears are falling from his eyes as well.
"I can't do that to you Cas, I just can't," I growl and force him to turn around almost crying when I see his back. Across his right shoulder blade is a word angrily carved into his skin, the lines harsh and straight. His shoulders hunch forward and his small whispers carry over his shoulder.
I greedily open the container and begin to devour the delicious food, moaning a little at the taste of fresh food. Cas chokes slightly and I look up to see his red face and him biting his lip, I grin and continue eating my food.
But each word only fueled my anger and I was soon shaking with the urge to knock Alistair's teeth down his throat. This behaviour followed me to the next class and whenever the teachers turned their backs, his words wormed their way towards me.
"I. Don't. Care. What. You. Did. Dean" I say, barely managing to control my anger at his horrible situation. He looks up and my heart shatters as he begins to put his mask back together before facing his brother, he allows me to see how broken he feels.
I imagine the hot water washing off the pain and instead leaving the usual mask that I wore everyday. When I exit the steamy box, I pull on some fresh clothes and mentally prepare myself for school today.
"Fix. Him." He demands and that just makes Dean cry harder, his eyes now screwed shut and my heart shatters at the sight. What did they say to upset him this much? I try to reach for Dean to comfort him but instead I find my dad's hand, squeezing it tightly as I watch the medics approach, Dean. My dad squeezes back and the painkillers I was given begin to work themselves through my system, turning my thoughts foggy but thankfully removing the pain.
Smiling into Cas' hair I let the darkness of sleep consume my thoughts, effectively stopping my constant worrying for the other shoe to drop and my perfect life to be ripped away. I let my thoughts slide away and gratefully embrace sleep.
"Cause when you're scared I'll always calm you down, and when you're upset, it makes me upset." I kiss him, grateful for such an amazing boyfriend.
"Excellent, what happened to you?" He chuckles at my comment but stops when I don't laugh with him. He looked awful and wanted to know why- he was my best friend after all. I deserved to know why he looked dead on his feet and why he was struggling to open his eyes after each blink. The last two weeks he began to look like he was fading away, it was small things that gave it away.
"Hey, Cas."
"Have you seen the new movie? It's amazing, you two should come see it with us! I actually think you know someone in our group, Dean? You work with her, Jo Harvelle? Yeah, she says you work pretty hard and earn some sweet tips. Talking about tips, have you heard...."
I shuffle into the kitchen with sleep clouding my mind and slouch into a chair. I sniff the air and smile when I smell bacon, I open my eyes and study Dean. He was wearing loose army pants and a grey shirt with no shoes. His smile is only small when he see's me and then he's back to cooking breakfast.
"I'm just getting a degree in engineering," I mumble and Cas rests his head on my shoulder. We talk about the things we will and won't miss from school and soon the clock strikes five, which causes Jo to jump up.
Two hours?! We couldn't have been here for two hours! It was only an hour when I passed out, I couldn't have been out of it for an hour...Maybe it was a good thing, I mean they must have waited until I woke up to hurt Dean so nothing happened to him. I let a sob out of my throat and see Dean shift towards me, wincing as he does so, and I hear my dad yell again.
Ignoring the pain in my lips I lean down and kiss him softly, smiling warmly down at the most important things in my life.
"Good evening Mr. Novak, my name is Meg Masters and I'm your nurse. Can you open your eyes for me?" I take a shaky breath and open my eyes slowly to the blinding light.
"Thank you, sir, honestly. how could we ever repay you?" Dean's voice cracks slightly on the
"You're getting married?"
I only woke up occasionally when he had a nightmare and I've told him multiple times to wake me up but he doesn't. Some times he disappears into his own thoughts and only I can get him out, but both of us had improved.
We walk hand and hand into the grey building. My heart thumps wildly in anticipation and fear.
I open the door and see Charlie, Jo, Ash, and Kevin grinning at my door. I invite them in and we sprawl across the lounge room, Cas sitting on my lap. I idly play with his hair as we talk about our after school plans.
I briefly look up and see Cas slowly walking over to me, his face pale and his hands clenched tightly. I feel another crack from my face and squeeze my eyes shut in pain. The kicks stop and a hand grips my hair, pulling my bloodied face from the ground. I feel hot breath on my neck and Alistair's voice weaves its way through the air.
But that's not what's wrong, I turn to observe Sam because if something was wrong with Sam, Dean would be upset. Sam was bundled up in a jacket too big for him and a thick scarf but he looked fine. I tilted my head to the side and noticed that Sam's jacket was actually Dean's.
"What are all these from?" I whisper, afraid of the answer.
I observe his face to get my ability under control, brown hair that hung around his ears and big brown puppy eyes, the colour of coffee beans.
I glance to my dad and his eyes are red and puffy, his beard and hair unusually messy and his glasses sitting crooked on his nose. He offers me a small smile and I try and manover my aching face into a smile back, but it turns into a wince.
He remembers Deans funeral.
4- find something in the fridge to cook for dinner or buy something
"I guess you want the full story then?" I nod once. "Alright, here it goes. You have to promise not to tell anyone, okay? Not a soul." He stares intensely into my eyes and I nod slightly, a little scared for what he was going to tell me.
"Whats so funny?"
I focus on the information our history teacher, Mr. Cain, was giving us about World War Two. He begins to talk about the Nazis and then starts explaining the newest assignment.
Whatever happened last night obviously shook him badly and now he was reserved. I concentrate and focus on his soul, squinting a little at the white light emanating from it, but the emotions it was portraying were fear, sadness, happiness and pride.
Right into Alistair's arms.
"Great, so, did you know all clownfish are born male? And when the breeding female dies the breeding male becomes the breeding female?" I twirl my pen between my fingers and laugh out loud at his stunned face. He opens his mouth a few times and then just frowns at his hands, shaking his head and whispering 'what?' quietly to himself. I grin and wave my hand in front of his face,
"See ya tomorrow, Dean" I smile at him and climb into the Impala, smiling at Sammy's sleeping form leaning against the window. I drive down the street and open the motel door before coming back and picking up Sammy.
"Hey sweetie, my names Ellen, I heard you're lookin' for work?" I nod politely and offer my hand, she shakes it firmly and begins a quick interview. I keep my mask up and try to be as convincing as I can, I really need this job.
I walk into class shyly and duck my head at the attention. I feel Dean walk in behind me and I turn slightly, allowing him to walk ahead and talk to the teacher for us. I still didn't like talking to new people that much, I'd only ever been to one other school and only ever hung out with that friend group.
He grabs my hand and entwines our fingers together, he brings it to his lips and kisses the back of my hand.
"This continued for about three months until Gabriel came home crying. He managed to talk some sense into me and since then I've been stone cold sober, haven't picked up a substance like that since. Half the reason we moved here was so that I could get a fresh start." He smiles down at me again and nods at me to begin. I frown and he smooths my forehead with a hand.
The smile slips as Chuck walks up to the door and stands in front of me. I straighten my back and lower my chin a bit, almost stumbling when he laughs.
"You're a squirrel!" I shush everyone and sigh when they finish yelling out random suggestions.
Dean rushes into the classroom just as the bell rings, his hair a mess, his usual plaid over shirt missing and dark circles under his eyes. The teacher clicks her tongue tuts at him and instead of the usual sarcastic comment that would've followed he stumbles to his seat next to me and slumps down.
"Come on Cas. Let's bring you home." He nods rejectedly and I drive him home. When we pull into his driveway, I run around the car to open his door and I wrap my arm around him again. He smiles weakly and snuggles into my body, I smile at him and knock on the door. It flies open to reveal a dishiveled Chuck followed by the rest of Cas' family.
"Alright, problem two, night shifts." I bite my lip and shrug.
And I felt simply amazing after he kissed me again.
"Yes."
We slow dance to Elvis, his breath tickling my ear as he sings softly. I bite my lip and sigh, relaxing fully into his arms, letting his words wask over me, and when the song ends I pull him in for a kiss.
Dean grins as he pulls over next to me.
I stand frozen as the football team kick the crap out of Dean. My hands are shaking but I can't move from the car for two reasons, the first, I think I'm in shock, the second is that if I leave I know Sam will try and help his brother.
I swing my chair around and lean over him to point at his notes. I notice him stiffen and I glance up at his red face, this was going to be so much fun.
"I have a very serious question for you Cas." He says, his tone joyful. My lips curl into a smile and I reply.
"Well squirrel, better get that rib of yours fixed up before the game cause that's gonna sting in defense." I pale slightly at his statement before brushing it off and laughing, I thought I hid it well. Dad would blow a fuse if he found out.
God, I hope this goes well.
"Dean! When are you coming back to work, man? We're dying without you there." She smiles at him and I watch as dimples appear on her cheeks. Dean smiles again and soon we're all babbling on about movies and books, but the whole time Dean is clutching my hand like a lifeline.
*          *          *          *
"Sore, how did Dean take all that without hardly making a sound?" Sam looks upset and almost like he knows the answer.
"What do you mean they hurt my son?" My dad asks, his voice dangerously low.
We sit there for about half an hour before Cas groan. I sit up straight and stare wide-eyed at him, my heart thumping. He opens his good eye and it immediately fixes on me, I try to warn him with my eyes but he just frowns at me.
We break apart breathing heavily and he leans his forehead on mine, staring straight into my eyes.
"Never, bitch. Leave us alone." He snarls at her, which causes her to just laugh lightly and wink at him. He spins around and leans closer to me, looking straight down at the questions. I take the hint and begin answering them while we have a whispered conversation.
"Yeah, I'm alright Sam. How are you holding up?" He looks a bit dazed.
"Could you use your powers to bring Sam and you into a memory? A different one that is, not so...harsh." He nods and we all sit down, my heart pumping wildly and my hands sweating. Cas reaches for Sam and then nods at me. Time to go into a memory, but the familiar feel of being swept away begins it shows something different.
"Alright, boy. Last two problems, your therapy and stress. Have you told your therapist that? And talked about it?"
I trudge through the front door and gently close it, trying not to wake up Dean. I put my bags on the kitchen table and massage my eyes, trying to rub the sleep out of them. Luckily that was my last night shift at the hospital for a month, groaning I shuffle into the lounge room quietly and freeze when I see the scene in front of me.
