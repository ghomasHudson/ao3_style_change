He spots me out of the corner of his eyes as I march down towards him.
“Or I could do this.”
“How long have you got again?”
“Oi, move your legs.”
“I’m just so happy to hear your voice.”
Sherlock pressed a parting kiss on johns lips before slipping out the door.
Mrs Watson reached out to squeeze Sherlock’s hand.
“You go out!”
Moly swallowed, and left with the baby.
“Mmmm... we have to go to the movies in like half an hour.”
“Class dismissed.”
John was watching with hooded eyes as Sherlock ran her hand down his chest.
“I need new football trainers. I wanted your opinion.”
“Celebrating in style?” He asks, referring to the half smoked cigar in John’s hand, end still alight.
“How much do you reckon Mycroft heard?”
That’s all it took.
“Mmm.” Sherlock whimpered.
John glanced down at Sherlock the best he could to where the curly haired teen was resting on his shoulder.
“That’s my good boy. Just relax.”
“I didn’t know that, no.”
“Don’t stop!” Sherlock cried, clawing at John’s back.
Never miss my parents, never want to spend time with my brother, it never bothered me that I didn’t have friends, it just wasn’t something I concerned myself with.
“I’m bisexual. Welcome to 2019.”
“Tomorrow? Behind the greenhouse. I’ve been assigned to watch grounds crew.”
The girl in question didn’t move, her eyes remaining fixated on the wall in front of her.
“Read.” He said, holding up his book.
Sherlock stammered out a moan. He trembled in his shoes as John made a start on pulling down his jeans.
He attacked Sherlock’s mouth with his own, forcing his tongue past his lips as he lifted the brunette up so he was straddling his waist.
“Sherlock’s in labour?!”
John was in unfathomable bliss in this moment. The wet heat of Sherlock’s channel clenching around him like a vice, Sherlock’s lips on his, the vibrations spreading through his body. He knew he was going to finish faster than normal, but that just meant he would need to get Sherlock off faster as well. He reached down between them, and began to pump Sherlock’s rock hard shaft.
She still wanted more.
“I’m a murderer.”
How she had been coerced in to this task, she had no idea.
When John pulled away, he grabbed Sherlock under the ass, then got him to jump up, and wrap his long legs round his waist. He pushed himself between Sherlock’s legs, using his body to hold the brunette in place. He grabbed Sherlock’s arms, and pinned them above his head.
JOHN’S POV
“We’d better go in then. After you, my love.”
“I won’t tell.” I press, thinking a huh is by far the least unprofessional thing that’s happened to me.
I’m screwed.
Sherlock age: 13
John raised his eyebrows, searching for confirmation. Sherlock offered him a nod in return, and reached forward to grab at his shoulders, careful to avoid the bite mark.
He was ruined.
Sherlock hung up, leaving John alone with his left hand, a bottle of lotion, and his imagination. Normally he would just take a cold shower, but he knew that if he didn’t get rid of this energy, he’d likely ravish Sherlock before he could even close the front door. He began to move his wrist up and down as thoughts of the curly haired boy raced around his mind. It didn’t take long for him to reach his climax, doubling over in intense pleasure as he shot his load on to the bedsheets. They needed to be washed anyway. He fell back panting, his eyes rolling in to the back of his head. He lay there for a moment to catch his breath.
“You like that?”
“Oh, Hello.” She said awkwardly, her arms slowly crossing over her bare chest.
“What’s this?” He asked when he felt the silky band.
“Home.” He said, almost questioning, looking all around him.
“I love you, Sherlock.”
“Is he ok?” She blurted out, tears brimming in her eyes.
“You can do what you’re doing in a café, we can’t!” The girl’s voice shouted his time.
“Ummm, I’ve actually been here before.”
He let out a strangled groan when he felt John’s hands running down his chest and underneath the waistband of his pyjama bottoms.
“Ordinary.”
“Now, just breathe normally.”
“Did I say you could do that?” He asked in the low register he adopted during ‘play time’.
The second the door is shut, Sherlock is on me, kissing me like his life depends on it.
“What are you doing Rosie?” Molly asked, mournfully shoving a handful of minstrels in to her mouth.
Sherlock and John looked from each other to Irene and back again. They were amazed at how well she was behaving. Sherlock grinned to himself at the reminder that this by no means meant he had to behave. He toed off one of his shoes, and discretely began rubbing his foot up and down johns ankle. He didn’t seem to mind, and affectionately bumped his knee against Sherlock’s.
“So what’s going to happen to him now?”
“Have her sit down.” Mrs Holmes suggested, patting a spot on the sofa for Lucy.
“You’re very welcome.”
Mycroft reached in to his coat pocket, and slid a pouch across the table.
“Please...” The brunette whined.
Sherlock giggled, and shook his head.
“Am I?”
His eyes are screwed shut, and his mouth is parted, all sorts of ungodly sounds falling from him as ropes of creamy, sticky fluid shoot from the end of his cock.
“Perhaps another song by that bad we listened to the last time.”
Oh. That’s interesting. Not that John cared.
“Can we change positions?” He rumbles, his voice practically a growl that causes me to start weeping.
“Take me somewhere. I need to be fucked.”
“A soldier fights for his country.”
“So what did you what?”
“I love you, John.”
“Yes.”
“Right...”
“Sure.”
“Those ones are nice aren’t they?”
“Coffee for you I think.”
“Hello, dear.”
He leans forwards, and gently presses our lips together in a short, but passionate kiss.
“Sherlock...”
“What did she want?” Sherlock asked before dropping back in to the leather arm chair by the fire place.
“Gah!”
“I loved her dearly, but she did drive me bonkers. Though, I suppose that’s all mother in laws.” Mrs Holmes chuckled.
Everything he’s doing, every move, every noise, everything has me on edge.
Sherlock’s POV
He was completely overwhelmed by all the thoughts hitting him.
“No, no it’s not.”
"I'm going to see if your brother wants to eat. He undoubtably wants caffeine." Mrs Holmes mumbled as she poured another cup of tea, and disappeared up the stairs.
"But I've just solved a murder for you, aren't you going to do something about it?" Sherlock asked in dismay.
"You prefer tea, right John?"
“God... John- oh Christ!” He moaned as their bodies ground against each other.
JOHN’S POV
The blue eyed boy looked down at his companion, eyebrows raised. John still wanted to hang out with him.
“Mmmmm, I will.” Sherlock muttered.
Sherlock furrowed her eyebrows.
Sherlock happily obliged, and swung his legs over johns broad shoulders.
I chew the inside my cheek.
He lets out low whines and moans as I press him even further in to the wall.
“Yes! So horny! Please- ah!” He squealed when John restarted his actions.
When she came back, she reminded Sherlock of the rather unpleasant task of delivering the after birth.
“No, do you think they’re nice?”
I stalk through the corridors, head down, choosing to ignore my surroundings. This may have been a bad idea because out of nowhere, someone grabs my arm and pulls me in to what I believe is a cupboard. After I get over my initial shock, I realise that my ‘attacker’ is none other than John.
“Did you mean to set this fire, or not?” John asked as he set his rucksack on the table.
Sherlock let out a strangled moan when he heard John refer to himself as ‘Daddy’. He was so desperate to cum, his limbs shaking with arousal, his head fuzzy.
John didn’t want to pull away, but he had a surprise waiting for sherlock that required getting up.
“Oh-oh-oh” Sherlock panted, thrusting his fingers in and out even faster.
Sherlock felt his cock throb between them at the quality of his voice.
John age: 19
“Sorry.” John chuckled as he wiped his hands off on Sherlock’s bed sheets.
“Yes, I have a daughter, Harriet. She’ll be 14 in the summer.”
“Dad, I-“
“You can do your shirt back up now.” John chuckled.
Sherlock shrugged her shoulders as she sat down in the arm chair by the sofa.
“John,” Sherlock sighed. “Thank you for taking me out. I’m so glad we finally did this.”
As I look at the brunette, eyes wide and youthful, a constant reminder of how, while not inadequate, as he put it, how very innocent he is.
Sherlock briefly announced their return before leading John back upstairs.
Sherlock was grateful for the change in whether, for it meant she could spend more of her time outside.
“It’s miso.”
The blond raised his head at then mention of his name, and smiled weakly at Sherlock. When Sherlock looked back at Mrs Watson, she had snapped out of her daze, and was looking at both of her children.
With this confirmation, John gingerly pressed a lube coated finger at Sherlock’s hole.
“Hey, John. When did you get here?”
The hormonal teens quickly broke apart. Stood in the door way was a doubtful looking Mycroft.
“Your grandmother dies, and you’re thinking about literary terms? Don’t you care?”
“Please.”
“Oh, would you stop with your bally crying?”
Sherlock delivers her son
“Well, I must depart.”
“Walking is a loose term. I’d say hobbling.”
That wasn’t Sherlock.
“Do you want tea?”
“I that am lost oh who will find me, deep down below the old beach tree.”
Sherlock giggled, and threw a pillow at John.
Sherlock age: 15
“I missed you too.”
I may not have much... or any experience... but I think that kiss was pretty incredible.
She tried not to sob. John didn’t need to hear her crying. He didn’t need to know that the crying extended into the night because of the heartache, the sorrow, the pain.
She paused for a moment, and inhaled deeply.
"Oh it was good..."
“I’m close... I... ah!”
I frown again.
I grin.
“Mmmmm...” Sherlock moaned at John’s suggestive tone.
“Would you please say something.”
“Can I take your trousers off?” He asks after a moment, already slipping his hand down between my trousers and briefs.
“I’ve never really... felt... before.” His eyes are down, staring at our hands. “But last night... I felt everything.”
I eventually realise she’s talking to me, and throw in some noises of agreement and nod my head.
“We could do it without one...?”
He hesitantly reached out to close Thompson’s eyes.
"Ummm..."
“Ok, first things first. Boundaries are very important. What are your rules?” John asked, pulling Sherlock into his lap.
John began to rock his hips softly against Sherlock’s ass, their trousers causing maddening friction.
The three women all looked at each other, but didn’t say anything.
John had a look of disbelief on his face as he took in the sight of his son in his arms.
John experimentally rolled his hips, looking down at the place where their bodies joined.
“I’m going to touch you... and pinch you... tease you...” John snarled in his ear. “Till you’re a whimpering mess, begging for my cock.”
Just as soon as my legs stop wobbling.
She knew this was Mycroft’s way of checking she was ok, and keeping on top of things. Mycroft didn’t ask anymore questions, and stayed quite for a moment, just looking down at her shoes.
John buried himself to a hilt, his hip bones pressing up against Sherlock’s ass. He started slow and steady, pushing in, and pulling out, emitting small whimpers and whines from Sherlock with each movement.
Since coming back, time has gone by slower.
“I love you too.”
Sherlock shrugged, a small smile on his lips.
My mouth gapes in a silent gasp as I nod my head, my hips arching forwards.
He offers me a teary smile at that, and nods.
“Don’t stop! John!”
“Hello, John. My mother made this for your family.”
“I expect this is a given, but if one of us says no, the other has to stop.”
Sorry his took so long, and it’s kinda short. But! I needed a set up for the next chapter...
“I cannot believe you came all the way up here.”
“Oh for- sherlock, give me the jam! You don’t even want it.”
John dropped down beside him to take a look at Sherlock’s restraints. His hands were cuffed together, and another set of handcuffs were linked round the chain, and cuffed to the bed post.
“Oh, ok.”
“Alright. That alright with you Holmes?”
John.
The blond looked up at the other boy, and happily took the coffee from him.
David Smith, a young man from his bunk.
John slipped an arm around Sherlock’s waist as they re-entered the club.
“I missed you.” He pants when he pulls back to rest his forehead against mine.
“No.”
John fingered him till he was right on the edge, then pulled his fingers out.
“Now, tonight... I want you to think about this moment.... while you pleasure yourself.”
I feel myself relax when the smoky drag reaches my lungs.
Sherlock moaned softly in to johns mouth as he began to buck his hips faster.
Thanks ☺️
“Sherlock.” His mother warned curtly, although it was clear she was holding back laughter at the expression.
“You feel ok?”
Sherlock receives her first letter from john.
“Alright.”
To me, she is simply a memory, and to my brother, nothing but a lesson to teach me, a tool in order to mould me, and keep me from beckoning the worst version of myself.
She readjusted him so she could get a proper look at him.
Sherlock dropped his head forwards as his cock spurted sticky fluid down the wall. He could still feel Johns thick cock pulsing inside him as they both came down from their high.
“Oh, thank you. Do you want to come in?”
I’m afraid to meet his gaze again, instead choosing to stare down at my shoes.
“Please... please...”
“My sentiments exactly.” Sherlock breathed. “What do you want anyway?”
I traipse along beside him, keeping in time with his marched pace.
Sorry this took so long, I actually had no plan as to what to do next 😆
“Well then... Go and get the toy box. You need to be punished.”
“Because- Ugh, you. You and that fucking outfit.” John sighed in exasperation.
“Here.”
4th of July 1917
John closed the gap between them, and connected their lips. It was passionate, but gentle; heated, but loving; desperate, but slow. Sherlock pulled back, and looked into johns eyes before pressing their lips back together. John smiled into the kiss, moving his hands up to cup Sherlock’s face. His skin was soft and smooth, his cheeks burning. When they stopped for breath, Sherlock kept his eyes focused on John.
“Get it yourself. Consider it your daily exercise.” Sherlock said with a wink as he crammed a bite of toast in to his mouth.
The last day of school rolled around eventually. It dragged on for what felt like days before finally coming to a signified end with the loud ringing of the bell. Sherlock was looking forward to the summer and spending time with john. When she got home, he was alone in the kitchen drinking tea.
“Make love to me.”
John floundered for a minute, wondering what exactly his dad was getting at. His next words said it all.
“She knew you wouldn’t want your hair up, so she bought you this.”
Yes, doctor, why do you think that is?!
Of course, there were physical kicks from the inside too.
His request snaps me from my daze, reminding me that I’m just standing there, blinking like a complete twat.
“This is going to be good.” John mumbled to himself as he watched from the doorway.
They would have stayed there just basking in the after glow if John hadn’t felt Sherlock dozing off.
A act on a whim, grab him by the hips and carry him across the room where I drop him on the counter top, mindful of the presumably out of order, forgotten toaster.
I move to the door and unlock it, the shift of the tumblers making a quiet series of clicks.
“I wasn’t aware our relationship had changed status?”
“Yeah, yeah of course.”
There was no more screaming. No more shouting.
(See the end of the chapter for
The corners of his lips quirk up in a boyish grin.
“I don’t know.”
“Do I worry?”
“Oh right.”
Christmas Day at the front.
So... John Watson. He looks like a John, as much as anybody looks like a name...
“Mmmmm!” Sherlock moaned in to his mouth, providing John with an opportunity to slip his tongue past Sherlock’s lips.
“Go on John!”
“Thank you.”
“Yeah...”
I look around the corridor before entering the break room. Sherlock appears a moment later.
I’ll switch back to writing from Sherlock’s POV in the next chapter. Hope you guys are enjoying. Xx
“That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.” He husks, his voice deliciously deep and raspy.
“Agh!”
Keys in the door alerted their attention. Hair in a messy bun, eyes shielded by sunglasses, a loose fitting shirt hanging off her frame; Molly stood in the door way.
John narrowed his eyes.
“I know he does! He gets letters from some posh bird all the time.” Brenton called from where he was perched on a table. “She’s got some fancy sounding name. Like she’s a fairy tale character, or something.”
“Sherlock, why don’t you sit down.”
“Sounds great.” Irene and John agreed before either of the other two could respond.
“Ok.”
“What do you want to watch?”
Sherlock grew more confident with each pump, his strokes becoming smoother. He watched John closely for his reactions. His eyes were shut, his head was lolled back, cheeks flushed, and his rhythm was becoming less precise.
John slid his other hand round Sherlock’s front, and situated it between his legs, just under where Sherlock’s testicles sat in the panties. Sherlock groaned quietly, and chewed his lip between his teeth.
The group turned their heads to see John in the door way juggling a folder, a textbook, and a bottle of wine.
“Yes, What?” John barked, tugging at Sherlock’s hair.
I am completely incoherent as John follows after me, biting down on my shoulder to silence himself.
“You’re basically a sack of stubborn potatoes, aren’t you?” Irene asked, waving a pen at him.
He spots me pretty much as soon as I walk in to the room.
A knife.
I can just about see her face from here. Her eyes are soft and her lips are chewed in between her teeth as she waits for John’s answer.
He cups my cheek in his large, calloused hand and stares at me intently.
“How do you mean?”
He successfully managed to avoid John for most of the day, spending his time with Molly and Mike instead. Unfortunately, he couldn’t avoid him forever. He saw John in the courtyard, and thought he’d managed to get by unseen. But John has spotted him, and trailed after him.
“It’s so nice to be able to say that to you first thing.”
“You didn’t need to submit a complaint! You self-righteous weirdo! The whole neighborhood heard!" The Coach started walking towards Sherlock
Sherlock sat, looking at her and blinking. Dr. Quentin’s advise to make new friends flashed insistent in his mind. “Sherlock? Sherlock?” Charlie looked alarmed.
“I didn’t pick it up! Herndon did it! No! I just happened to stumble close to it Donovan! Well, you know that, because you seem to have a modicum of intelligence, Herndon will never realise it! Well you are Detective Inspector now, Donovan, if you have a more legitimate way to obtain evidence against the murderer, then by all means, get rid of this, but if not, it stays between you and I. And I’m busy starting now, so don’t call again!”
Once Watson was asleep, and before Sherlock said anything about going home. John brought out the inflatable mattress. It was much more comfortable than it looked. He put clean linen on it and offered it to Sherlock. “I’ll take the sofa. That way, if you have a nightmare, I’ll be close and you won’t get to Rosie.” So Sherlock stayed.
“The bloke who arrested me when I was a junkie? Well, he didn’t quite arrest me, just detained me in a holding cell and provided me with a hot meal. Who’s he marrying?”
“Obviously, I had one at a given time as I’m here. She’s dead.” Rosie admitted.
“I don’t understand how referring to someone being old enough to be your parent is in any way considered an effective motivator to get that someone to dance.” grumped Sherlock. Mycroft laughed until tears came out of his eyes. Greg, took a little longer to get it.
Before Sherlock said anything, the DI spoke again. “I said it to you,
Sherlock went back to work. He talked with people, and made an effort to communicate. Six weeks after the wrecked night he had arrived at his brother’s door, he felt confident enough in himself to return to Baker street. Mrs Hudson, who called daily, and Watson were as happy as he was.
“Cooking…” John said, smirking, “... that thing people do to have something hot to eat. Those of us who like to eat, that is.”
Rosie, safe and at home at last, finds out what Sherlock thinks of her behaviour.  John gets a chance to explain his actions, but is Sherlock ready to move on? As they are both busy, Sherlock with work, John with his and his drawings, we get a glimpse of what they are working on in therapy. (Welcome to this universe's take on S4). John joins Sherlock when there is a break on the Missing Veteran's Case, with some..., interesting developments.
He was rendered speechless. Then remembered this was Sherlock. He did things like this. Gave people what they needed. The workshop was wonderful, filled with space and earth science facts and all kinds of experiments involving homemade solutions and beakers and many more Sherlock-ish things. Rosie was so happy. She continued to call John by his name, continued to hate the flat, and eat sparingly. She did warm up some towards him, especially as they worked through the experiments.
“Rosie, some people’s phones can be either low in charge or incommunicado due to being in the tube” Said Sherlock.
She pushed a donut into his hand. “Who do I have to go after? Dr.Watson? Give me the word, I’ll find 15 different CBO’s to pin on his arse.” Donovan talked without changing inflection.
*******
They looked at one another and smiled. “Well, take a guess then” Lidia said.
He came to, dizzy, drenched in sweat and fluids, feeling quite unable to move.They had fallen back on the bed at some point. Luther was next to him, the picture of satisfaction, smoking a cigarette and smiling at him. “Hey there...welcome back, baby.”
“Well, we haven’t had any time alone. I came back pretty clear that I prefer to go back home, than to stay here and be her booty call. I don’t need her games to fuzz up my head. She wants to make her family happy and call me when she misses me, and that is not happening again.”
“Your husband, he was alright with you coming to a conference so far away?” Sherlock asked him.
“Are you alright? Sherlock where are you hurt?” he asked as his hands went up and down the detective’s torso, over the shirt.  Sherlock hissed as John palmed a rib on the left side.
And oh, how those words hurt. How many times had he thought about proposing to  Sherlock, just to stop himself because of his disastrous experience with Mary? Or he had stopped himself thinking Sherlock was not the type to want a ring? Maybe he should be honest with himself, he didn’t want to repeat the experience of being married, the old ball and chain. He thought Sherlock had gotten close to asking himself. At least once, during a holiday at the beach, he had started talking about weddings, and ceremonies, and John had shot him down, saying it was an unnecessary expense and ritual for something that was 50% likely to work out at best. John hadn’t really been talking about their particular relationship, but Sherlock had hurriedly found a different conversation topic.
“To take a shower- and shave this thing off.” He kept walking.
The set was proudly displayed in front of the Bingo ladies, a couple of months later, when she hosted evening tea at her flat, making sure Mrs Turner was present. She also made sure to have the recently engaged couple (John had proposed the week before)  drop in so she could show off her boys and her cute grandchild
“I know.”
Sherlock crinkled his nose and  shook his head furiously. “I made a friend at a club a while ago. He invited me to travel with him for his meeting.”
“Oh yeah. With everything he does.” said John.
“No!” Pepsi said. “It’s you!! He will love it! Calm yourself down. You’ve said it a hundred times, you’ve sung the song a hundred times. You will be great!"
There was a promenade, the fairy lights were on, giving off golden light. Everything was decorated. There were sand colored hearts with tiny off white tulips secured to them with blue ribbons, everywhere, there were the chairs, grey, with blue green slashes.
John saw Sherlock’s eyes squeezed shut, his hands clenched on the sheets “Sherlock, come now, love.” He started him off, his hand on his lover’s cock, until Sherlock’s larger hand joined in and he came, making a mess of both their abdomens. John was so close he only needed a few more thrusts, and they were down, lying next to each other.  John got up to wash and brought flannels to help Sherlock clean up, though the detective was mostly down for the count.
-Surprisingly well. Charlie is smart and insightful and we happen to share experiences. Also a liking for Mango Rum. SH
“Sherlock?” John approached slowly, “are you alright?”
“Ms O’Keillie? The substitute director you got fired, when your ex came to his senses, threw you out with the trash and took you off of the child’s papers. You made such a racket the higher uppers never called her again.” Reid growled.
Sherlock struggled to get his hands out of John’s. “Help me sit, can’t breathe.” John shifted him some, tears falling now. Sherlock stared.
John tasted and smelled like him. That was wonderful. He was still kissing him. He said there would be no one else. “You will move into this room, obviously. That can be your side of the bed. You may bring your things, but don’t touch…”
“I’m waiting. It wasn’t a question.” Harry could assume the Captain Watson voice without ever having been in the army.
“A case? You are…”
- Breakfast date? Day after tomorrow, cycling first. Will supply track bike and helmet. Then crepes.
Rosie woke up then, there was dinner to be warmed for her, a walk to the playground, late tea with Mrs Hudson. She gave John a very kind report about the last three weeks. “Oh, he was a darling! He came to keep me company (twice, when she had dragged him into her flat to feed him), he did the shops when I asked him to (Online, paid for delivery), and played only the nicest tunes on the violin! (Hudders deserved the best tea set available at Harrods! He would see she got it). John positively beamed at him, his smile making Sherlock’s lips turn upwards too. Sherlock made sure to kiss Mrs Hudson goodnight and that his eyes showed her all his gratitude. Her eyes let him know he was loved regardless of his horrible behaviour of the last week.
“Do you not understand the word irrational? What does it matter how much you talk, if when the bloke comes around, your lover totally blows you off? I would think you would understand about irrational given how insanely jealous you were of the Adler woman. And she was totally the wrong flavor for your man.”
Sherlock paled when he finished reading and placed the letter in an evidence bag, then offered it to John. As Lestrade walked in, Sherlock said, “I believe these shoes are a souvenir Moriarty kept from a crime he committed. He did not steal the shoes to use them, as they are in almost pristine condition. Therefore, he committed a crime against the shoes’ owner. In order for him to keep the shoes, he most likely killed him. I say 'him', because the model seems one for boys, that were in fashion some 8-9 years ago. They show some sign of light usage, and have what looks like oil stains on the inside. The man I used to know was able to use different plants to make both mixtures to make horses’ coats healthy and shiny, and boys’ skin itchy and irritated. It’s doubtful the stains will yield any evidence now, but I believe the latter was applied. Have the team look for DNA. I have to think about who the victim could be."  That said, he left, while John showed the D.I the letter. By the time John was done with Lestrade, there was no Sherlock anywhere in the building.  John's calls were not answered, so he texted.
“Oh!...so are we meeting Sherlock at the station? What are we going to do in Cardiff, anyways? Will we go on a case?”
“It’s alright, Rusty, I’ll make it there tomorrow morning then.”
Donovan  had the suspects on their way when the two men got to the Yard. She reminded Sherlock to keep his head. Even then, she gave Reid to Stewart to interrogate. Sherlock did not protest, and headed to question the lover, former substitute headmistress, Fiona O’Keilie.
“I was following his directions, John!  You can ask him about it next time the two of you go for a pint. Now we are home and I can think of 57 much more pleasurable things to do than continue this conversation.”
********
“No,” said John, “it must be something they injected him with, maybe an insulin base.”
*Look at the comment section. Have a question for you! ;)
John sighed. “Sherlock, the man lay his hands on you. He called the smartest man alive a freak. He spoke about your private life. Insulted you! You are brilliant and beautiful. You can have your pick of lovers and companions. Just look at Luther! You are not alone and will never be. That he dared say I ‘threw you out’!”
Sherlock walked up to him, took the paper and they sat together in the library, consulting formulas and skyping with some friends of Wiggins, until Mrs. Hudson, curious due to the silence, walked up with the afternoon tea. She didn’t recognize Wiggins, until he spoke, then she screamed happily and hugged him. She had, after all, been witness to how hard the younger man had worked to leave his old life behind. She used Sherlock’s kitchen to prepare them dinner.
“No, no, no! You wiped him out, you wiped everything out. I said your name over and over!”
*********
without whom I would not be posting this chapter today. A special dedication of the first song "Soldier" to my guys. I'm the soldier now.
Sherlock was with D.I. Harris at a crime scene, comparing different shoe prints related to a series of neighborhood “accidents” in a well off neighborhood when his phone rang. John. He always texted. He stepped aside to answer.
for being such loyal supporters and finding time for me as you write your own stories and live your talented, fulfilling lives.
The building where the doctor Mike recommended worked was modern, stark and impersonal. Sherlock and Greg waited in a room with a glass wall overlooking a view of the river. Sherlock’s leg would not still. If there was even a window, through which he could be seen, he would turn around and walk out. When the assistant lead him to the office door, Greg told him he would get a coffee and be back to pick him up.
John had had a long day. He enjoyed his time in the shelters, talking and tending to the veterans, but he was finding bureaucracy difficult to handle when he needed support and care for the men. To unwind, he had asked Angie for a date. She had been delighted to accept. They had been friends with benefits for almost a month. Angie had been set on watching a movie, a paranormal mystery thing that John had “solved” within the first few minutes.
So Sherlock started boxing. He wanted to toughen up his muscles and it was something John would have never considered. He signed up to a place he found online and went very early in the morning on non-Watson days. He loved it. The exercise left his muscles burning, the re-learning of techniques took concentration. It took his mind off everything else. He discovered he liked it very much. It went on his chart of happiness.
“Yes. I wanted to show you what I couldn’t say. I wanted you to remember you belonged here, with me, but…” Sherlock cut off, he was looking at the wooden floor of the living room.
“I guess so. I haven’t told Sherlock yet. It’s all so new!”
“Well, since you have invited me to be your flatmate, do you want to come over to mine, until you can move into the other flat?” John asked with a smile.
“They had a huge fight and now he’s taking me away from him! Sherlock!!” Rosie crying in earnest, out of fear and rage.

John’s temper flared, “I would like to give that brother of yours a piece of my mind! What a git! I do know the real you, I’ve seen you at your worst, I’ve seen you with Angelo, and with Lestrade, deducing people, solving old crimes no one else could. I have a past of my own, and I assure you, I had times when I have been far from good. I have a messed up family, too.  Listen to me Sherlock: I. Am. Not. Leaving. We are moving into Baker Street, where you will be the World’s Only Consulting Detective, I will be your only colleague, and your blogger, because people should know what you do for their safety.”
The man clucked his tongue. “Don’t even remember me, Captain Watson? I’m hurt! But then again, you were always so ‘holier than thou’, weren’t you? Alright. We’re done. The Boss said ‘don’t kill him, I want to make him dance first’, but since
“No.” Sherlock pouted, and Harry knew it had stung him, badly even.
“Soooo…” she whispered to him with a smile, bumping his shoulder with hers  “...I take it no more african boyfriends….”
“Oh save it genius.” she said, walking away; “You’ll be thanking me soon enough,”
Sherlock looked down, and spoke softly, “You didn’t say anything. I was happy I didn’t have to spend the night in hospital. I wasn’t aware what I said could be interpreted that way. I apologise John, I know you are not gay. Now, people will talk.” Sherlock looked crestfallen. John did not like that. He wanted the genius happy.
-I didn’t think anything of the sort. Merely that you said you thought it unfair that it was your sole responsibility to take Rosamund to social gatherings. I have this one covered, John. SH
Sherlock hovered at the bottom of the stairs. Should he go to Mrs. Hudson’s? He could pretend it was to show off Watson’s clever science project. He was honoured she had thought of using honey. Her display was perfect, with facts, diagrams, pictures, and actual honey, in different states of crystallisation and realistic bee and beehive decorations. He decided not to bother Mrs. H. It was rather late. He would skip dinner and have some tea. Upstairs, the flat was cold. It always was when it wasn’t a Watson night. He meant to look at some cold cases Donovan had asked him to review, but got caught up filing away everything about Watson’s science fair. Down to the light in her eyes when she first realised he was there. Watson’s school had a classroom of it’s own in his Mind Palace. Unwanted, the memory of how John had not looked at him when he arrived surfaced. Of course, John would correct him when Sherlock said they were separated. It did not hurt him when John said they were broken up. After all, it was already 3 months, one week and four days since John could not “take
“This was outside when I came back from the bakery. We usually don’t get any post on Sundays, and it immediately felt wrong to me. Sherlock had already left, so I went inside, grabbed a pair of gloves, and brought it in, just as it was. The phone did not even move,” she explained.
-John. Case closed. I find the prospect of returning to Baker street boring. SH
“You solved it?” John was amazed.
When Sherlock woke up, the sun was in his face and he was alone. It took him a couple of tries to be able to move; getting out of the bed was a triumph. He felt as if he had been run over by a bus. His whole body hurt. He made it to the shower.
Then I got married. To a woman. And oh, wouldn’t you have liked her! I was so used to your filth, I didn’t even  notice her lies, her need to control everything about me, her own sick brand of abuse. She almost killed my partner…” he stopped to breath. Passed a hand over his wet face. Breathed deeply to control his anger. “Even when I finally got together with him, raising my child with him, your ghost was there in my head telling me to put him in his place, to not let people know I loved him, that he made me less of a man on purpose. I ended up leaving him, to prove to him he couldn’t make it without me, sure that he would come and beg me to come back home. I almost lost him to another man. One very sure of himself. Very much a man. I knew then I had to get rid of you. For my own good. To raise my child the right way. So they could grow up knowing they are loved and respected, always. I have been putting in so much work, and you know what? My partner, who is the best man I ever knew, gave me one more chance. Therapy helped. Anger management helped. You could have done it for us too, you bastard, but you chose yourself instead. I have proven to myself that, faulty as I am, I Am Not You. I will be there for my family and I will love them and have the love of my beautiful, genius, very male partner. Together we are raising my child. And just as if you were alive, you will never know them, never know their names, because you are not worthy of them.
“You might want to check your phone, Sweetheart. It’s been non-stop.”
John has left London with Rosie. On Sherlock’s days. He only meant to find refuge with his sister, unthinkingly leaving Sherlock fearing the worst. Alone in the night, what will he do? Is there anyone to help him? How will they go on from here? While the beginning of this chapter is indeed full dark, with no stars, there is a door, a warming fire behind it, and a long road to discovering how to rebuild oneself when all seems lost.
“Bumble?’
“Dunno…,” said the man. “The young one said he could help with it, if I tried a periment medicine. He even gave me some money.” He showed them a 50 pound note.
A bit angsty, this chapter. A bit more to come. They men are together and fine, though, and will have, as promised, their happy ending! Songs for this story on the
“John, I need to come, please!”
Dr. Quentin’s words about befriending new people lead him to say. “If that is the case, why don’t you come with her? We recently renovated the flat and there is a guest bedroom. The girls could stay in Rosie’s room.” This prompted the girls to scream again.
“Of course he does! And a website, not that us mere mortals can make any sense of that. Why don’t you get your arse over here, John. I’ll pay the cab, just come.” begged Lestrade.
“Well, that my body did need to recuperate from it. I didn’t go to the club and when Luther texted I told him I was on a case, which is true. I also continue to feel mortified about calling out someone else’s name.”
“Molly, for goodness sake, don’t be idiotic! That was then, and this is now. Bill is a proper pharmacist. He works as head of Sanoff review teams for new medicine.
“Fantastic! Since when do you go to therapy? You have always hated it!"
Sherlock was frankly staring at her now. He nodded his head yes. She continued,
“If you are done, Reids, you really need to leave. If you want to continue the conversation about my partner, we can do so outside school limits. I don’t mind. Half the Yarders are my friends. At most I’ll get a nice private cell for the night and a free dinner.”

“When will he be back?” snarled Lestrade back
“Of course I will sweetheart! I wouldn’t miss it for the world!” and when he looked up and saw his family smiling, John knew that was well worth sacrificing the conference for being with them
The next day Sherlock received a call from Mrs Hudson. She was back at home and they could move in. The boys started packing up John’s things, mostly books. Then they heard Mrs Lewis yell out; “My bag! You thief! Stop it, come back!!" and Sherlock, who was closer, flew down the stairs and out the door, while John ran into the room to get his gun, and then went after him.
John nodded. He knew exactly where and when they had met. He had been there. He should have dumped that date and taken Sherlock home, and the hell with the consequences.
“Do. Not. Call. Sherlock Holmes a freak or a ‘psycho’ in my presence ever again, if you do not want me to report you and demand you go through sensitivity training.” Captain John H. Watson said in a calm, dangerous voice.
Bill stood on a stool and said: “Well mates, listen up. We wanted to thank you all for coming. If you’re here it means we really wanted you to be here, because you are special to Molly, or me, or in some cases, both of us. Just wanted to share our happiness, both for the new place that's actually turned out nice, and also because we found each other, and that, in this day and age, wasn’t very probable.
-What is it? You said taking care of her would not be a problem.
“No. He is not coming on this trip. He is in London.” John said, not looking at her.
“He had a tattoo! It was a tiger and it was very colourful. The tiger was hunting, very well done and distinctive! I would say due to the pigmentation of the orange, he had it done in the US, some 5 years ago, he could have been military, but dishonorably dismissed. Now he is working for a dominant, possessive man who is interested in me. I wonder if you would recognize him if we found his real hair and eye color.”
“I’m high-functioning sociopath, addicted to drugs, and done. How will talking with you help? I refuse any type of medication, or trips to hospital. I will go ahead with the overdose in its stead.”
“ I would say zero to minus five,” John answered, returning Sherlock’s smile and giggling.  Rather than walking around looking for something, Sherlock sacrificed his vest, cleaning first John, then himself and not having any other option than binning it in the tiny garbage basket under the desk.
“But you would say you two were ‘friends’? That is cold, John. Couldn’t you tell it bothered him?”
“Anyway, a look into his finances reveals no outstanding debt, no casino privileges, no serious health concerns. By all indicators a man with many reasons to live. Find out what the poison is, and compare it to the other suicide victims.”
A crass description of acts that could only be performed with a woman. There were also pictures. Selfies of the two of them at some restaurant. She wore a blue dress that looked painted on, a deep V and a ton of eye liner, her head on John’s shoulder, squeezed together. The woman holding John’s head and kissing his cheek. John was smiling. Another picture; Gianna in lingerie, winking at the camera; young, beautiful, curves in all the right places, small hands, long hair. There were more. Sherlock stopped himself from looking. John’s girlfriend. His new lover. The realization hit him like a bucket of cold water. What was he doing here?
******
Sherlock stood there, blinking, not knowing how to respond to that on the phone, in presence of a DI from the yard. He wanted to say so many things, and words failed him.
He caught up to Sherlock just in time to see his face go pale and his mouth fall open a tiny bit, as the man, who only had eyes for Sherlock, said, “Hello, baby....” At the endearment, Sherlock’s cheeks flushed pink, his lips hinting at a smile. ”... I’ve been waiting for you.” John felt his stomach clench and his mind go blank. Punch in the guts, lack of air, ‘No. MINE!' thought his brain, and he had to clench his hands to stop himself from doing something ridiculous, like throwing himself on this giant of a man.
“I’ll get our stuff, we’ll go together.”
Rosie went through the whole process again. “John just helped me open the honey jar. He insisted on supervising the whole experiment, even though it was just a tiny one. He took pictures though. If you want I’ll have him send them to you.”
“I might have a few scrapes, some bruising.” Sherlock admitted.
Luther and Sherlock were in a cafe. They were almost done with their civilized talk. “You know what I feel, baby. It has to be good for both of us, so it’s alright if you are not feeling it anymore. If it’s about what happened last time, don’t feel bad. It’s ok.”
********
They walked towards Sherlock, and found him handing over the bubble machine to Mark’s dad and showing him how to use it. Rosie ran to talk to Jackson.
“You sure you haven’t heard anything?  Hasn’t he been around?” John asked Molly. “Odd that, right?’
“Sherlock, when you’re on the rebound and bi, a person of either sex can look good to you. I think maybe he went for women cause he just wants to get laid and he feels it’s the easier way. Maybe he’s not willing to give another bloke a try. Might a) fall in love with the sod, or b) compare him to you all the time. Who would you be more jealous of John dating, a woman or a man?”
“Oi! Look at you all normal like. Who would think he got his talons in you? Fine, Dr Watson. Your
He stood up, got a bottle of gingerale and some ice and mixed new drinks for them. Soon, they were deep in conversation. Sherlock had known Lizbeth came from money and was bisexual. He had not known she had been married to a man many years ago. Upon moving back to London with Charlie and Nyla, her family had started a successful campaign to separate them. Charlie told Sherlock this was both women’s second marriage, but Charlie had been sure Lizbeth was “the one”. They had been happy, until they moved to London and Lizbeth’s work and family interfered.
John quickly pulled away. Sherlock giggled at the slightly perplexed look on the boy’s face, then turned her head towards the hall.
“Good boy. Now sit up so I can untie you.”
“I love you.” He said quietly.
Sherlock had settled on the mauve panties, black crotch less panties, and some thigh high tights. The things Irene had grabbed were more dental floss than pants. He couldn’t deny the kick he got when he tried them on, although they would of course look better when he didn’t have his briefs on underneath. He grinned broadly upon seeing himself in the mirror. John was in for a nice surprise.
“Darling, of course. You love who you love. I don’t care who it is, as long as they’re good for you, and they make you happy.”
Sherlock smiled flirtatiously, and nodded his head.
“So gorgeous.”
His legs were shaking as John pounded into him.
Well, maybe not so innocent, I think to myself as I remember the pair of underwear in my pocket.
She bit down on her lip so hard she drew blood, but she didn’t even notice, her focus entirely on the agonising burning from between her legs.
“Now you have to reasons to get home.” He said with a wink, then went about cleaning his boots.
Once John got over his surprise, he moved his hands down to cup Sherlock’s thong clad ass, pulling him closer. He felt himself salivating as he looked down at Sherlock’s erection straining against the thin fabric of his lace panties.
“Mmm... I don’t know.”
She didn’t care if anyone saw them, and neither did he. As she ran her tongue along his lips, John couldn’t help but note that finishing school hadn’t changed her at all.
It was the blond’s turn to take a shaky breath this time.
“What’s the matter?” He asked gently.
“Just platonic?”
He reached the top, and there she was.
Sherlock giggled, and pressed his lips to johns.
Amidst the flurry of blue and beige, I catch sight of John.
John chuckled.
“Your tone is slightly nervy, the pitch of your voice is raised, you keep moving your hands, and looking around you. You’re worried. Somebody made you worried. Obviously.”
Sherlock looked up, “Done for the day?’
Mrs Hudson opened the bedroom door with her key. She found Sherlock in the loo, sitting on the floor next to the toilet. Gone. Off line. She called his name twice, he didn’t answer. It scared her badly. She grabbed his hand and pulled upwards. He sat up straight. She held him up by his waist and guided him to her sofa. He sat there for a long time. Mrs. Hudson, tea made and croissants laid out, came to sit next to him, hugged him, and whispered loving words to him, and he buried his head in her shoulder, hugged her tight, trembling like the broken creature he was.
“Sherlock, you had a boyfriend. I know. And you didn’t tell me. I don’t like that.” Rosie admitted.
Sherlock tensed and got up abruptly, ”NO!”
-What is this insistence with the idea that I can not attend birthday parties with Watson? Saturday is my responsibility, and therefore I shall be there. I am a consulting detective of international fame, surely I can manage three to four hours of children playing, singing, running around and having tons of sugar. For your information, Rosie and I have already chosen the gift for the young lad. A pirate costume. Rosie assured me Jackson has a healthy obsession with Black Beard. Furthermore, the party is in a park, with various activities. SH
John sighed and took a deep breath.
“I know you’ve missed me, but I’m not God, John. Ahh!”
Dr Ian Quentin was almost giddy with relief to see Sherlock. He looked very well put together, his hair in well taken care of curls, he looked very fit, and was quite talkative. Sherlock had missed a couple of sessions, due to work, making it a month since he had last seen him. Dr Quentin had to admit he had missed his patient.
“I’m free from pretending to be someone I wasn’t. Sherlock, therapy has helped, but the most jarring experience for me has been missing you. That made me reconsider my actions and my reactions. I see you now, working on being a better father, on being healthier and you make me want to be those things too. I want to know more, to be able to do things in better ways and to know what you need of me.  I want to deserve another chance with you.”
you daddy anymore, does she?”
Rosie had stuffed her school bag into one of the desk drawers. She took her school ChromeBook out and showed him the photographs. Rosie had taken pictures of each note after she read it, and hid it in a folder she named “English Essay first draft”. This had just proven extremely valuable, as the notes had been erased.
“I admit to being quite confused and fuzzy brained. After all, John wasn’t being specific, he was throwing questions at me while I could look in his eyes, feel his hands and his breath, catch his scent. I understood that he wanted to kiss me, so I hurriedly said ‘Yes!!’ Quite enthusiastically.
“John!” said Lestrade, sounding relieved.
“John. I couldn’t talk about this yesterday. I was overcome. The song alone would have been too much. The adoption… You didn’t have to do that.”
“Not extraordinary, simply the result of focusing one’s mind. Any idiot could do it.” Sherlock hissed.
“Think so. Not as fast as I used to be, though." John drank some of his beer.
“Maybe it's not all that John. Maybe Rosie just wanted to exaggerate. She has been teasing you lately.”
Finally, Sherlock and Wiggins looked at each other. Wiggins smiled. “It’s been a long time Sherlock. Kept clean have you?”
As always, thank you to my readers, those who just read, those who kudo and those who comment and have conversations with me. You guys light up my life. Thanks for all your support and ideas and for joining me in trying to get my idiots from A-Z .

The package did not have any post stamps, and was wrapped in gift paper. “Sherlock” was artistically written on the package with black ink and the burner phone on top of it. John understood what had raised Mrs Hudson’s suspicions. He also took some gloves and used them to feel the package. Whatever was in there was solid. He didn’t open the package, as it was addressed to Sherlock, but he couldn’t stop himself from picking up the phone. A run of the mill burner phone, with four digit password. John steeled himself and tried 221B. The phone opened. There was one number pre-programmed. Going out to the patio, he pressed the call button. It ringed three times on the other side before Moriarty picked it up.
Holmes and I know each other well by now.”
Sherlock took his hand, and pulled him out the door, John was lucky to grab his sports bag. Of course a taxi stopped in front of them immediately, and by the time they got home, Sherlock was a mess of fidgeting legs and tambourine hands.
“Your going away, it didn’t affect Lizbeth? The heart grows fonder and all that?”
“But that is the way you started anyway, right? He’ll come around, John. You two have to end up together. You have been through way too much.”
“I’ve been to the States a couple of times, I spent some time in Florida, when I was a young adult and I later went to Texas for a case.”
“Yeah. You still visit every week?” John asked, trying to look nonchalant.
They were a little more than 10 blocks from the trattoria to John’s flat. Sherlock glanced at John every now and then, and he felt everytime John looked at him. He kept his distance and put his traitorous hands behind his back, when they wanted to reach out and touch the doctor. Once they were only a couple of blocks away from John’s flat, Sherlock got in a cab. Both John and Rosie waved goodbye. Sherlock caught John looking into his eyes, and he could almost fool himself into thinking he saw some of the old admiration, or even love in them. Even if it was love, at the present Sherlock wasn’t sure he wanted to do anything about it.
Sherlock sighed, “I find, that (pointing around his own mouth) very distracting, John.”
“Calm down, you right git.” said John, affectionately. He looked at his chart. The nurse looked from him to Sherlock and back again, wide eyed. John talked to her, “Everything seems to be in place, vitals alright, levels of oxygenation within normal limits. His primary doctor will sign his release.”
Sherlock raised his glass and clinked John with it. “To my Dearest, because I was homeless until he came back to me. We are home now.” They drank.
“That she possesses the ability to think fast and act instead of freezing does not mean she doesn’t need to be protected!” Now Sherlock was getting upset.
Luther laughed, got up, brought him wipes and a glass of water. Sherlock drank the water gratefully and cleaned up halfheartedly. Luther turned on the television, to black and white Hitchcock movies. He put a plate of strawberries between them. Sherlock ate most of them. Eventually he fell asleep. Woke up once when Luther picked him up to put him under the covers.
He came downstairs, where there were his books in the bookcase, apparently ordered by something less boring than author or size.The kitchen things in their new places. The red armchair in front of the fireplace beckoned, he went to look around the kitchen, the shelves, the fridge.  Mrs Hudson had provided them with some basics; milk, tea, bread, eggs, orange juice, dish washing soap. He was thinking of what else to buy to make lunch with when he realized Sherlock had been very quiet.
Voicemail: (tense voice) “John, it’s Sherlock. I’m calling because you stated you wanted to assist in cases. It is fine if you can not at the moment, though an answer would be appreciated. If you have chosen not to participate at all, an answer would still be appropriate.”
“Green shirt. The night I first went with Luther. Why didn’t you come to me, then? Oh. You were with someone else.” Sherlock looked away. “Gianna, still?”
“John, is this really why you called? It seems like an odd hour to show off we are... boyfriends.”
“Not good, then?”
That evening, after leaving Rosie and a still quiet Sherlock at 221, he went to dinner at Gianna’s, and had her for dessert. It was great being with a women after so long. Really fantastic for their first time. He had been reluctant to take the step, but he didn’t remember why. She had been lovely and curvy and tiny and enthusiastic. He had stayed with her after they cleaned up, but John found he couldn’t fall asleep. Gianna eventually ended up with her head on his chest, her dark hair tickling his nose. John stroked it, smooth and silky, his fingers half expecting to catch in curls. She was still asleep when he left. He called her in the morning, and things had been alright.
“Woah there, big boy! Why are you making faces at my food? It’s the rice you liked at that South American place close to NSY!” Greg whinged.
“Sherlock! Really, what a pet you have gotten!” The man’s Irish lilt was a bit off somehow. John knew better than to show it, but the constant smiling was unnerving. “Master will be mad now. He doesn’t like to admit it, but he’s a jealous bloke, mate. And he’s nasty.”
Sherlock looked at his brother. Constant pain in the arse. Meddler extraordinaire. Fierce protector, loving uncle to a girl that wasn’t even his. “Gladly, Mycroft. I look forward to seeing you happy at your wedding.”
Luther made sure Sherlock and Rosie were secured and understood what to do. Sherlock first tended to Rosie and climbed with her, participating in a race with Mark and his dad. Sherlock and Rosie coming up the winners. Then she raced by herself and tied with Pepsi. Some races later, she went back to the trampoline with her friends. Sherlock decided to climb to the top. He stood for a good ten minutes looking at the wall. Then he proceeded to scale as if he had done it many times before.
The texts were so Sherlock. Facts, not even a good night. He imagined him at home, in their bed, texting and he missed him, just a little. The tiniest bit.
“Mrs. Wood, always a pleasure.” Sherlock had said, shaking her hand.
The signatures in place, the documents collected and safeguarded in Mycroft’s suitcase, the group returned to the dining room. Mycroft announced them; “Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and family, Ms. Rosalie Amelia Watson-Holmes and her father, Sherlock Holmes.” The group erupted in applause, everyone getting up to hug them and greet them. Sherlock noticed his parents had also joined the party. Angelo served dinner, then dessert and coffee. Angelo even put music on, the guest moved the tables.
Today's featured story is a fantastic AU
“Sherlock!! This is unbelievably kind and thoughtful!! The best gift I could have dreamed of. These numbers are insane!”
Rosie called him as he was gathering information about a suspect. She wanted him to procure thin carton boxes to make a school project. She had to make a model of her home for the following week. “We can work while I’m home. If it’s ok to stay in…”
“Oh Sherlock- how? I, please!”
Mrs Hudson said from the back “Now Sherlock, behave. Molly wants her friends over. It’s nice of her to have us! You will be nice to her!”
“I saw you, you know. That night you were dancing. You had a green shirt on. You looked gorgeous, Sherlock. I was there. You were very slim, your hair very short. You danced like a pro.”
“I’m fine Sherwin…” Both men laughed. “.... wanted to check in and brought you breakfast, just to see you strolling down the street, looking like the cat who got the cream.”
“Yesterday, when Charlie was over, she talked about Lizbeth’s behavior. It seemed odd to me. Figured there was something I could find out. They should talk. Charlie should know.”
started reading this story when it was still little more than halfway written, therefore forcing me to finish it so as to not disappoint this insanely talented video editor, author and poet. Then
“Look John! She is valedictorian! Donovan. Tell her I love what she decided for her hair.” Sherlock was beaming.
“Finger marks make me think diabetes, sugar testing. This guy was younger, but could still be affected.”

on YouTube.
Though Rosie’s expression brightened like fireworks, he said, “We’ll have to see”.
Sherlock, in lieu of a material gift for John, had set up a foundation for Veterans of war, named it “Gratitude” and boosted it on social media, with Wiggins as one of its patrons. He brought up the page to show John now that it was officially Christmas. Sherlock had started it two months ago, and as a result, all the veterans currently in hospital or in the outpatient Vet’s program at Bart would get a care packet, tailored to their needs, plus a Christmas Dinner.
“Mr. Holmes, John. Come in. To what do I owe the pleasure?” She asked, looking warmly at John, sternly at Sherlock.
“I was quite sick, in no condition to see you. Dr. Quentin said Depression/Anxiety disorder and suicidal ideation. That in addition to all my usual diagnoses. I felt I had to stay with Mycroft for a while, until I was able to get out of the dark place I was in. Watson was my beacon. Dr. Quentin has been very helpful providing guidance as how to better my routines and how to let myself know what I will and will not accept from other people. I have worked hard, to get better, to be able to work cases, to take care of my physical condition, and of Watson. I won’t let anyone compromise this, John - not, not even you.” Sherlock said.
“Yes, I know. No boyfriend. I’ve been busy trying to get my business running.” Sherlock kept staring at John.
“You were living in that tiny bedsit, wanting to save your sham of a marriage. I took to just going in, unannounced. You usually didn’t protest, just ordered food and watched  telly while I used your facilities.”
Sherlock was panting, but whether from nerves or actual lust, he couldn’t tell. Luther kissed his lips and sucked on his tongue. Luther raised himself up to look at Sherlock as if he were a work of art.
Even more frustrating was the other note. "An alcoholic and a junkie", the note said. Harry was an alcoholic. But Rosie had never stayed with her when she was a baby. At that time she had not been doing well. She had to research what a ‘junkie’ was and found out it was a drug addict. She knew Sherlock had health issues, like when he got sick and stayed at Mycroft’s. Dad had been worried about him, ‘using’, she heard him ask Dr. Stamford. Sherlock couldn’t be a ‘junkie’ though, could he? He didn’t live on the streets.
He took them and read. “This is for real? Have you thought this through? This can’t be taken back John.” His voice was a whisper.
It turned into a standing “date”. Sherlock would spend his Rosie day afternoons with her, playing and listening, completing school projects, and playing karaoke. Watson had a great singing voice and tone and was totally into it at the moment. On the other days, Sherlock boxed, checked in with the Yard (or Donovan), went to therapy, now twice a week. Dr. Quentin was divided on the subject of sex. On one side, it was a vastly different experience than what he had with John, and it had made it on Sherlock’s “Happy List” on the other, Dr. Q felt the potential for emotional dependence was present. In the evenings of his non-Rosie days, he went dancing and left with Luther. It was certainly a learning experience. Luther was clearly very knowledgeable about sexual acts and techniques, and loved getting Sherlock up to speed.
Sherlock suspected the reason he couldn’t finalize the case was John. He found it increasingly difficult to remain concentrated on his cases, without his conductor of light. Even when they were at the height of discontent, John mere weeks away from moving out, Sherlock had known that no matter what, John would at least physically be home. Even during their bitterest arguments, Sherlock had taken comfort that he was there, that he hadn’t left. There had been something worth going on for. With him gone, his thoughts split between his ongoing cases, Watson, and broken up John. It was quite frustrating, and he didn’t see an end to the situation.
His arms are very firm...
Sherlock giggled and wrapped his arms around johns neck as they reconnected their kiss. John placed his hands on Sherlock’s hips, pulling him closer, forcing their bodies flush together. John’s tongue tracing sherlock’s lips made him moan low in his throat, and his hips buck forwards.
“Ready?”
John nuzzled Sherlock’s nose affectionately, inhaling the brunette’s scent of coffee, mint and honey, this time with the addition of the distinct smell of sex.
Both Sherlock and john’s eyes went wide.
“Try it again.” John nodded, guiding her hand back up.
“So, geff....”
“Yes, she’ll probably be saying that too in a few minutes.”
“Oh bugger.”
John shook his head, bottom lip chewed between his teeth in frustration as he pressed his head against the door.
“Sorry. Didn’t mean to startle you.”
“As have you.”
Johns pace increased, and so did Sherlock’s pleasure.
Their tongues fought for dominance, their teeth clacking.
“Gah!” Sherlock moaned, grabbing at the sheets.
I took a chance. I took a chance, and I think it went well. I keep an eye out for him throughout the day as I move from post to post. The amount of times I spot him, I wonder if he’s looking for me as well. After catching his eye in a crowded room for about the forth time, I finally see him on his own, in the garden, watering some marrows. He goes inside after a moment, and attempts to lift a bag of soil, but he seems to be struggling. I check to make sure there is another CO around to watch the other inmates before walking over to him.
He took the object from johns hands to get a proper look at it, turning it over in his hands.
“But right now, I’m going to do things to you.”
I walk in to the large, noisy room once I’m sure everything is in order.
I have a long wait till I need to meet John, and each of those hours goes by achingly slowly, my job of turning soil doing very little to occupy me.
Dear, John...
“Thank you.”
“Name?”
He looked up at her, and saw that her eyes were wide, dark with lust, and deadly serious.
“Careful.” He chuckled as he gripped the walking stick at his side.
“What about you Watson?” The tall boy asked, turning his attention to John.
Sherlock stumbled in her heals, and tumbled into johns arms.
“You’re a friend of Molly’s.” Sherlock addressed the blonde girl.
Johns husky voice breaks the silence.
John age: 18
Maybe I should ask Sherlock what he thinks.
“When my parents sent me things I’d often trade them for cigarettes or something. But I always kept everything you sent me.”
Sherlock definitely thought so as John kissed him senseless in the dark room.
“Afternoon, pretty boy.”
Sherlock’s POV
Sherlock giggled as John pulled them onto the bed, his legs flying up in the air.
John eventually rolled off of her, and pulled her in to his arms.
“I just want to make sure it went well. That nobody got hurt, and you’re alright. It can be quite emotional.”
“Sure.” Sherlock beamed, a bean that stayed on his face long after John left.
John age: 17
"Yeah, ok."
“Moly dear, would you like a cup of tea?” Mrs Holmes asked, placing a hand on the young nurse’s arm.
“He infuriated me by pretending nothing was wrong, and trying to be physically affectionate. But then, when I was ready to cave in, he would go back to working all hours and being less than civil, and what we had completely froze out.”
********
“And you may never be, love. But he does love you, you know. Don’t waste this, my boy.”
He  walked for a while and found a smallish disco. He decided to go in, as it could count as something he had not done with John. He found it not too crowded, being Wednesday. Sherlock went to the bar, and had a rum and soda, taking in the music. The DJ seemed to have an eclectic taste, going back and forth from older to newer songs. He went to the center of the dance floor when he heard “Can’t Stop Feeling” (Franz Ferdinand), which reminded him of his time in Florida, when he had just met the Hudsons, and he was a stripper. He let himself dance, and had to slap and push away people  who liked what they saw. “Mad Love” (Sean Paul) came next, then (“Cake by the Ocean.”) and some older songs by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. Sherlock was sweating profusely by the time he gave up. Somebody pulled his shirt, and he turned around to glare at the culprit, then met eyes with the DJ, who smiled at him, giving him a once over, offering him a sealed bottle of water, which Sherlock took. Big, handsome man, ebony skin, brown eyes, playful smile. Interesting music choices. Sherlock felt, flattered? by the man’s attention. He was definitely happy to have come.
“Oh, this isn’t a date.” John blurted out quickly.
“Right, on the bed.”
John whipped his head around to give Rosie a questioning look.
“Alright Holmes?”
Harriet spoke again this time.
Sherlock wrapped the blankets tightly around herself, and the steady rhythm of Johns breathing eventually lulled her to sleep.
“Oh fuuuuuck...” I groan as I slam my hips in to him a few more times.
“Hey, you ok? That wasn’t too much, was it?”
"How did you know all that?"
“Home sounds good.”
“Just a few interactions such as that one.”
Was John dying?
“Oh god...” murmured Sherlock, seemingly in retaliation.
“Fuck... oh god, sorry.”
“I like him too.”
He blinked a few times as he took in the marvellous view of Sherlock, kitten ears and all; perched, ready to pounce.
“Harriet. What are you doing here?”
John immediately felt a stab of guilt go through him as he remembered that he’d inflicted that pain on him.
She bids him goodbye, then departs in to the corridor again.
I can’t help the small sound that escapes my lips, nor the pink flush that immediately follows.
4th of November 1918
“Alright, we’ll leave you two to it.”
“You got it from rugby. It’s a rugby scar.” Sherlock said flatly.
“Oh, bite me!” She lashed out as Mycroft offered her a hand up from the floor.
“You’ve let your guard down... it’s sad, to tell you the truth.”
John was crying by this point. Sherlock could hear the sobs that wracked his body.
She fisted his hair in her hands, tugging pleasurably at the roots.
She had insisted that Mycroft and her mother left the room. If she’d had it her way, she would have done this all on her own.
I ball both socks up and hide them underneath my bed before settling down and drifting off back to sleep.
“I can’t eat, mother.” Sherlock mumbled.
Sherlock is innocent until John corrupts him. Wait for it 😉.
“Because I killed him.”
Sherlock didn’t say anything, so John continued, slow, gentle stokes from base to tip. Sherlock knew he had little experience to compare this moment too, but it was mind blowing. John kept their lips connected as he pumped his wrist, enjoying the moans and whimpers that Sherlock emitted. He clawed at John’s shoulders as he felt waves of pleasure wash over him.
John kept his lips on Sherlock’s as he laced his fingers through the waistband of Sherlock’s cotton briefs, only pulling away briefly to admire his raging hard-on.
I knew I never liked her.
“Sherlock-“
“Ok. I’ll see you in the morning.”
Sherlock remained quiet for a moment, which lead John to believe he had offended him. John began drafting an apology when Sherlock answered.
The train pulled in to the station right on time, much to Sherlock’s disappointment. She wasn’t ready to say goodbye to him. Not again. She could only hope he wouldn’t try and throw himself on to the tracks like she did. She brushed off the thought and simply tightened her grip on her suitcase.
That’s what Mycroft had said when Sherlock had mentioned it to the wiry woman. It had taken the younger of the two a while to fully piece together why on earth would he miss it. He seemed perfectly traumatised to her. Then she realised that it was the lifestyle, the adrenaline, the sense of being part of something. That’s what he missed. Compared to all that, sitting in the garden of your country estate in sunny Shropshire might just be a bit boring. Sherlock knew all about being bored. There were moments when she felt like she’d go insane from all the normality and simplicity of the events unfolding around her. She thrived on the complicated, the unusual, the unsolvable. She lived for adrenaline highs.
“Yes...”
I want to do it again.
“I have to go back.”
I need to get out of here.
“What do they normally say?”
John had his eyes screwed shut, and his jaw clenched as intense bliss spread through his body.
“John?”
“I should probably go home and get a few things.”
She used his shoulders to lift herself up, and rearranged herself so her legs were wrapped around his waist. From this angle, she could feel his erection poking in between her legs.
Except I don’t fall, because John has caught me. Of course he has.
I state honestly as I begin to walk back to my bunk. Lestrade follows me down to the dorm, asking a few questions, primarily about my ‘confrontation’ with the librarian.  “I hear there are going to be new guards. Am I correct?”
“Ah!” Sherlock wailed, screwing his eyes shut.
“John, it’s gone weird!”
“I said no.”
Sherlock grumbled, but kept his mouth shut. He slumped down at the breakfast bar, and picked up a newspaper.
“Thank you, Sherlock.”
“Me too.” Sherlock grinned.
Sherlock wasn’t sure if he’d heard John right, and turned to look at him, blue eyes wide.
Her voice was a breathless expression of demure as she searched John’s eyes, waiting for his answer.
“Miss Holmes, would you do me the honour of giving me this dance?”
Moriarty.
Sherlock shakes his head and murmurs notions of silence.
“You remember that episode of Big Bang theory where Sheldon is unemployed?”
“Seriously though, that dude needs to get laid!” Rosie giggled.
Sherlock was stood in front of his mirror trying on the black crotch less panties. They were high rise, with two extra bands, one that went just below his belly button, and the other sat on his hips. He’d decided he wanted to wear one of the new things he’d bought, but he wasn’t quite ready to wear anything that would show. This would be his little secret; One that he might let John in on. He pulled on a grey T-shirt with the ‘queen’ logo on it, and a pair of black skinny jeans, the two bands peaking over the waistband. He rearranged himself when he felt the denim push the fabric of the panties flush against his skin, sending a little shiver down his spine.
It’s Christmas lights, not candles; it was orange juice and pasta for dinner; it’s not a king sized bed, it’s sofa cushions adorn with pillows and blankets, but I don’t care.
“No. We thought we’d wait for you and get breakfast. We figured you had to leave your room at some point. It’s more like brunch now though, mind you.”
“Are you ok?”
A grin broke out on the blond’s face.
“I suppose so.”
Oh, how many wondrous yet clumsy metaphors one could apply to myself and a certain blond...
He clearly notices my change in demeanour.
I lean in and press my lips to his.
“FUUUUUCK!”
For all his faults, I know he cares.
“Oh...” Sherlock cooed happily as John began trailing kisses down her collar bone.
“Not for this.” He murmurs with a shake of his head. “For assisting me earlier with Moriarty.”
“I missed you.”
She then recalled the details of her biscuit burning experiment. As expected John had some interesting opinions, and laughed at the retelling of the doily burning incident.
Sherlock perked up at this, a small smile forming on his face.
Enjoy! Thank you for the comments, I love reading them. Xxx
“John...”
“Right, you two are going to need to keep on either side of me. Any funny business, and you’re both getting shots. Have I made myself clear?”
He brought his tied wrists up to his face, and stuffed his fists into his mouth. He let out muffled sounds of pleasure as John continued to smack his ass, no doubt leaving marks all down his skin. Sherlock felt Johns breath right by his ass, followed by a bite. Sherlock cried out in ecstasy, his fists falling from his mouth.
“Crap, I said that out loud, didn’t I?”
The brunette let out a small yip, and grabbed at the sheets.
“Oh, John. Can you do me a favour?”
“That’s not a no.”
My legs feel as though they’re about to give up, and become one with the floor as his words are whispered in to my ear as a raspy husk.
“J-o-h-n!” Sherlock yelled out each letter of John’s name between pants as the broad teen pounded into him.
He walks towards me, and places a hand on my hip.
“It’s my uhhh... underwear. It’s really uncomfortable.”
“Sorry, could you repeat the question?”
Hope you enjoyed. I apologise to those who like Sally and Phillip, but I needed bullies, and they were there.
“I’m glad we did this.” He says when it’s time for me to go back on duty. “You’re right, I never get to hear this sort of thing. I only observe ‘useful stuff’. I never get to hear what matters.”
“Yes. Yes, I’m sure.” Sherlock said honestly.
“I love you.”
Greg arrived about half an hour later.
Sherlock pulled his towel up, showing his newly bare skin to John.
John sat there, completely dumbfounded, staring after the brunette as his raging erection throbbed in his boxers.
“I’ve been working alone since Wednesday, after I told Sasha Hopkins she was an idiot for thinking electrolytes and electrolysis were the same thing.”
“Well yes... I mean... well Sherlock’s in labour.”
Wait, what?
“Yeah, Alright.”
“Yes!” Sherlock gasped, a strangled moan falling from his lips.
Sherlock and John get to know each other l.
“Stay.”
This was an opportunity. It was a loophole.
Frantic, was the word they’d used to describe her.
He stops trembling, and remains still, chest and shoulders heaving.
Hope you enjoy! Possessive, Dom John is always fun to write, but man it took a long time 😆.
In the excitement, John had completely forgotten about the ice cube tray sitting on the chest of draws.
“I know.”
“Oh, thanks.” She smiles, and sits beside me.
“You’ll be home for holidays, won’t you?”
“Although, that is a good idea. Over my lap. Come on. Quick.”
He stretched his arms up to stretch out his muscles, making sure to groan loud enough for Sherlock to hear.
“Well he’s pissed alright. He’d put Anna Nichole Smith to shame at this rate.” John remarked as the boy in question was attempting to climb him like a koala.
“Excuse me.”
Lucy chuckled, and shoved the last piece into her mouth with a sigh of appreciation.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but John could see a twinkle in the blue orbs as the cogs inside the brunette's head started to move.
“Agh-nnnggh... agh! JOHN! FUCK!”
Throughout the lecture, a few people stared at Sherlock, but the only comments were positive ones. Sherlock practically skipped back to the flat, dragging John along with him.
Sherlock was stood behind her mother in the kitchen, trying to convince her to let her go into town with John.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, and crawled back on to his bed.
“Touch me John.”
Oh shit.
“Mmmmm...” I moan in a pathetic attempt to communicate to John how good I feel.
Well, I know what I’m doing, but how to do it is another thing...
Sherlock’s lips pulled in to a smirk.
“What were your intentions when you... ‘kidnapped’ me?”
“I missed you too.”
My fantasy is short lived as I remember he’d have to put down the address when he leaves and he’d get checked up on. They can hardly see he’s living with me.
“I have to. I don’t have a choice.”
“Come on baby.”
“Of course Mrs Holmes.”
“Yes, I do. Is that ok with you?”
“Ooo ooo.” Harry chimed in a sing song tone, reaching forwards to squeeze John’s shoulders.
“Ok.” John smiled at him, and pressed a kiss to his temple.
“Music?”
Although Sherlock was shy, and bashful, he spoke his mind, and asked for what he wanted. Said boy was staring up at John with wide eyes, lips parted, and chest heaving.
“No, no, no, no I just need a minute! Please.” He begged.
“Yeah?”
I’ve never given much thought to what sexual intercourse feels like, but if it’s anything compared to the lustrous sensation of his imprisoned erection attempting to penetrate me through my corse woven trousers, I will be rendered dumbfounded in an uncomprehending state of euphoria.
Sherlock age: 16
His voice his strained, breathy, and fuck it gets me going.
Sherlock watched with wide eyes as John unzipped his trousers, and slid them down to his ankles. He felt his breath hitch when he saw John’s pulsing member spring free.
Sherlock and John have a little alone time, and Sherlock first begins to realise he might have a thing for authority...
I reach out for the table in front of me, and bear down on it so hard I can feel my nails making indentations in the repurposed wooden surface.
“You always sing that one.”
“It’s nice.”
“I think I’m going to...” he began, his voice raspy and strained as he desperately chased after the intense sensation that was building in his abdomen.
Oh, the burden of feelings.
“05:45”
John age: 16
Sherlock caught sight of John as soon as he entered school. He was talking to a blonde girl, and she was laughing. Sherlock stalked over to them, an uncomfortable nagging feeling in his stomach.
“Thank you sir.”
“Are you sure?” He asks cautiously. “This isn’t just because I sprung this on you, and now you feel like you have to-“
“Sure. Give me fifteen minutes.”
It wasn’t like last time.
“Ah! Oh god...” Sherlock moaned.
“Ok.” She said quietly, nodding her head in understanding.
“I want you to do it.”
After a few more minutes of cuddling, they both came to the conclusion that they were in great need of showers, so decided to shower at each of their houses, then meet up again at midday for a movie.
“I... I can’t believe I’m not there...”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good, thanks."
Her father still wasn’t home, and of course Mycroft already knew.
John quirked his eyebrows, but pulled Sherlock up so he could unbutton his shirt and pull it off. Beneath it was a scarlet corset. John sat back on his haunches, eyes wide.
“I don’t want to start something I can’t finish.”
“Yes- yes- oh god... don’t- don’t stop- ah!”
“Sorry.”
He bit back a low moan as he worked his wrist up and down, his head dropping back against the door. He didn’t need Sherlock to know his plan was working, so keeping quiet was a necessity.
It felt so good.
“Ah! Yes! I’m- I...” Sherlock gasped, screwing his eyes shut.
Greg went to answer, but John waved off his answer.
She smiled at Sherlock before going over to the kettle.
He was going to lose his virginity to the boy he loved.
The housekeeper, a young woman, maybe in her early 20s, took the pie, and placed it on top of the arguer before leading
His grip on the sheets tightened, his knuckles turning white.
“They get spanked.”
“Water please.”
“Yes... as a matter of fact I did.”
Sherlock nodded slowly.
“We’re gonna take off too.” John said.
He reached forward to cup her face, his thumb circling her cheeks.
John was coming home.
JOHN’S POV
“It hasn’t really come up. Mycroft knows though.”
I shiver.
I tried to make this as realistic as possible, awkward and bumpy. As their relationship progresses, i’ll have them settle in to themselves, e.g. John will become more dominant. Also, I don’t believe that having a discussion about boundaries and rules is a mood killer. It’s important.
The brunette was light on his feet as he sauntered back over to John and handed him a green tinted bottle full of a glue like fluid.
I try and keep the hope out of my voice, not only so they don’t get suspicious, but so as not to make myself any promises.
“When I use to ummm... I always used my own needles. I was always careful.”
Sherlock took a deep breath. She put her knitting down, and followed Mrs Hudson in to the kitchen, where a mushroom and chicken pie sat on the table.
The boy chuckled mirthlessly.
“John, I’d do that again right now if I didn’t feel like you’d just fucked me in half.”
“Sherlock.” He said through gritted teeth. “Say hello.”
I think he must have been reading 50 shades of grey...
Her eyes are fierce but friendly as she eyes me over her cigarette.
Oh god!
That wasn’t how I meant to do that, but oh well, I’ve done it now.
John gritted his teeth, and swallowed.
I almost get whiplash from how fast he whips round and presses the knife against my throat.
She made a noise of intolerance before finally meeting his eyes.
“Mmmm... oh... oh...” Sherlock hummed as John took his cock further in to his mouth.
Back in Dublin, in their room, Sherlock was concerned about what they had discovered; John reassured him that Mycroft would most probably know how to proceed. “He has the MI5 and the MI6 at his beck and call. He also has one Army Captain and a ton of resources. We are not alone, love. We can enjoy this, tonight. Let’s order in. I’ll take the first shower and then we can relax, OK?”
Sherlock sat down with her on his lap, his Belfast open and light sweat on his forehead. John busied himself setting up.
“Quite well, lovely, lovely lady” said Dr.Q with a smile.
When he got back in his rental, he felt lighter, his head clearer. He took one deep breath, let it out, nodded to his image in the mirror and started the car, heading back to his life
“Hello John” Said both Rosie and Sherlock in unison.
‘Touché’, thought John. Served him right.  Luther shook John’s hand, while his right one was low on Sherlock’s waist. He gave him a once over that left John feeling on the receiving end of a total body MRI. This man did not feel “friendship” towards Sherlock.
“What brought all this on, Sherlock?” John asked as they held hands  in a cab.
The men went to Barts to ask about some evidence they had to pick up for a case. Molly noticed no change, nor commented on it, greeting them happily, though a bit distractedly, taking them to Allen for the fingerprints and promising to have a get together soon.
“Yes, anything...stop this, Myc!”
“I wouldn’t have accepted that from Meghan. Hidden relationships are so not on. Didn’t it bother you? Why didn’t you snap him out of that?”
“Of course I did. I said I would. What happened?"
“Jackson said Rosie’s dad, Sherlock, was going to climb the mountain. I know Rosie is your girl’s name and really, baby, how many Sherlocks do you think one can encounter in a lifetime?”
“It’s like I’ve been flirting forever, but the person either doesn’t notice or doesn't care that way. I really thought the latter, until very recently. Anyway, I needed advice, and Clara and Harry gave it plentifully. Harry told me I should change my whole appearance, shake up this person who has known me for years. Then I should just come out and say it.”
Sherlock opened his eyes: “Yes John, but why are you doing this? You’re not…”
“So, thanks to your investigation, the two ladies are re-evaluating their relationship?” He sat in his armchair, much like his patient would, legs crossed, hands intertwined at chest level.
“I’m afraid I tend to look for dance partners closer to my own age, Hal, though I’m flattered.”
“Yes mother, no chance of neither me getting pregnant nor getting him pregnant,…”
*********
“No, please, sweetheart, let me help. I’m here with you. I will always be. Let me make you feel good, Sherlock’. He tugged at the sheet, and Sherlock let him take it, still on his side. John took the flannel and cleaned him off carefully. Then he became a big spoon/octopus and tangled Sherlock’s legs with his. He kissed his neck as he carded his hair and pulled it a bit, got one hand under and around to touch his chest and belly, while the other caressed his legs. “I want you to feel loved. I want you to know I’ll stay with you.” He played with his bollocks, talking to him, saying how beautiful he was, how brilliant, then wet his hand and gave Sherlock’s cock the attention it was needing. It was hard and heavy, but not ready to come, while Sherlock’s breathing was fast and shallow and this forehead was sweaty.
Sherlock and the thief were wrestling about a block away from John’s building. Suddenly, the well dressed robber stopped and raised a hand to wave at John. Sherlock started to turn and the man knocked him out, picked him up as if he were a sack of flour and put him in the back of his blue van, taking off seconds before John could reach them.
“Of course. Lotion?’
**********
“She’ll be alright with almost anything if you get her to help prepare it. There are few things she objects to, such as Brussel sprouts, cooked carrots and beans on toast. Just remember to present her small portions. Other than that, you should be fine. Is she staying with you tonight?”
********
“Fine. Then we are going to start this for Rosie, until you get to a place where you do it for Sherlock. Mike told me this is the only alternative you find acceptable as treatment, as you will not accept inpatient intervention of any kind. What do you think about visits three times a week for three weeks, we would reassess then.”
This did not have the desired effect. Sherlock’s leg was jump, jump, jumping. “Some people do not need infinite time to know that they have met the one they can not be without. They dated for a year, which you would have known had you observed Lestrade, or had any kind of conversation with me the last six months of our situation. They have lived together for three months. They are getting married, after giving it serious consideration. Mycroft wants Lestrade included in the family trust.” Sherlock had given up on the ice cream and thrown it in the can. He stayed farther from John than necessary. John thought for a moment about asking him how had he been supposed to ask him about his brother and Greg’s relationship, when Sherlock never spoke or answered him in the last six months without screaming, but he prudently closed his lips.
Sherlock came to bed, and John kissed him, hard, passionately, to erase the case from his mind. He even nuzzled his neck gently, licking around the tender scar there. John took his own clothes off, and Sherlock followed him. Sherlock’s hands went to work on John’s body, caressing him just how he liked it, the last two weeks proving the genius was a fast learner.
“Yes!” he said, smiling but impatient.
“Problem Holmes? Not liking the label?   Planning on kissing other blokes?”
Molly was beautiful tonight. She was wearing a red summery pencil dress, with flowers, that livened her eyes. She had kept her short hair, and lightened it. She had been animatedly talking with her Barts friends for a while, but now she, Linda Stamford and Mrs. Hudson were setting  tables with food, Sherlock had been talking with Dylan. John, Mike and Wiggins came around handing out champagne flutes. John came to sit next to Sherlock.
“Of sorts. He is a doctor, a diagnostician. He can find out what ails you and how to treat it when no one else can. I was laughing because he lights up, just like you do, when he gets excited by a case, or talks about his work. He’s really a proper genius, but a holy horror to work with,” smiled Wilson, knowingly.
The girls got all the materials ready and got started with three light haired dolls. One would be tested with purple drink dry mix, another with art markers and the third with permanent marker diluted in alcohol. While Sherlock helped cut open the permanent markers and mix them with alcohol, Charlie filmed the process. With little help and some directions, the girls were able to carry out their experiments, and thanks to the extra pair of hands, the whole process was filmed.
Greg looked at him stunned.
That day, Mrs Hudson had casually talked about Sherlock’s underground network and how often she had fed and sheltered them. She had contacts, she mentioned, to punish people who hurt her family, or dared to break her boy’s heart. This, John did not share with Sherlock.
John came in, ready to see Luther sitting in his living room. Sherlock was alone, with a naughty little grin on, impeccably dressed. “Come say hello, dearest.” He waved him on. Putting the bags in the kitchen, he came to look into the computer, where he found an elegant lady of  50 something years old, waving at him. “Iyanna, this is John, my partner. John, this is Iyanna, Luther’s fiancee.”
