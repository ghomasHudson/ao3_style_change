Had he wanted that part of Steve that hated to fly over open water and knew the smell of burnt flesh or had he only wanted the man on the posters?  Or had he thought that was the only part of Steve he could have?  The same part Steve shared with the rest of the world, but this…this part he let Tony only barely glimpse, and even then, it had always been so careful, cautious, as if letting Tony know too much would ruin whatever it was he thought Tony had built up in his head.  He wasn’t sure, if he was honest with himself, but he was here now.  He only hoped that counted for something.
Not to mention that he had several inches and a good bit of muscle on Tony, so it was clearly ridiculous.  Still, it somehow made him feel some strange combination of embarrassed, cherished, and incredibly turned on to hear the name slip from Tony’s lips.
It was stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid. Of course, it was.   Stupid and weak, and he was going to fail.  It was inevitable.  It was what he did.  As much as he liked to turn this litany off, it kept coming back and coming back, because, let’s face it, it was true.  It was true, and he knew it.  Everyone knew it.  He needed to cut this guy loose and come up with something else.  Anything else.  He couldn’t do this again---fourteen, squeeze, breathe—dammit, breathe for fuck’s sake.  Hell, he probably had enough lawyers on the payroll to bury Stern and his minions in motions until this blew over, though at this point, he wasn’t entirely sure whose ass the SI legal team was going to try to protect.  Thus, his newfound ability to put up with Matt.
He wasn’t sure how long he stood there, watching Tony watch him, but he could definitely feel himself responding to the scrutiny.  Ok, well, that was a little humiliating.  Not that Tony seemed displeased at all.  In fact, Steve heard him make some kind strangled sound, and then Tony surging to his feet in one swift movement, the tablet spilling to the floor to join the pile, to stand motionless a few inches from Steve.  It took all of Steve’s control not to stumble back at the sudden invasion of his space, but he held his ground, determined to see this, whatever this was, through.
“Really, it doesn’t look that serious.  You sure this is all there is?” Steve asked, then continued at Tony’s nod.  “Look, I’m going to give you these,” Steve said, holding up the one morphine shot they all carried with them. Tony’s had apparently gone down with what had been left of the suit when the jet blew.  In his other hand, he held out a small plastic package with two antibiotic pills that Bruce insisted they carry.  He took those from the package and handed them to Tony first, along with a small cup of the boiled snow he’d set aside earlier.  Tony tossed the pills into his mouth, then drank down the water.
Anto was healer, as Maara had been before him, and it wasn’t in him to simply leave the Stranger to his fate, as the clan wanted.  But, it wasn’t his decision. He was healer, and that gave him status, but Tyber was clan leader, and Tyber had wanted to kill him, Anto remembered.  There was little anyone could do to dissuade him, and certainly nothing Anto could do. The more Anto pleaded with him to let him do something, even just give the man water from his bag, the more Tyber grew rigid and angry at being questioned.  They were making the rest of the clan uncomfortable. Clan didn’t argue. There was rarely a need to yell or raise voices. Everyone understood too much what was going on for there to be misunderstandings, and the clan’s structure was very clear.  Everyone had their roles. Anto had known that he was overstepping by trying to bargain with Tyber. He had known Tyber would punish him for it. He had also known, though it had come after years of failing to see, that Tyber both loathed and wanted this from him, even as he berated Anto for it.   He didn’t know why he kept doing it to himself. He had not been able to simply walk away from the man, though. Maara had not left him, when she could have and her life would have been much easier for it, though he knew she would have, if she had been told to.
“My mother said something like that, too,” Steve replied, though his own mother had been far more blunt about the matter.
“So,” Tony began, then let the word hang there for a long moment.  “How’s the shitty Belfast ghetto?  Lovely this time of year, or so I hear.”
There were small starbursts from the lights dangling above the table reflected on the silver flatware, Tony noticed.  White china proudly displaying the Chef’s moniker outlined in silver stared back up at him from the table top.  His gaze followed the outline of silver and swirls and curls that made up the custom crest.  The glassware had its own design on it as well. Something custom, no doubt.  His throat was parched, but if he tried anything now, it would taste like it had sand in it no matter how much he told himself it didn’t, it didn’t dammit all to hell, but he knew from prior experience just how well his stomach listened to his head.
“How do you feel?” Tony asked, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist and fitting himself against Steve’s side.
dreams--you’re in my head, you made me come here!  Somehow. You--you-” Steve broke off, his voice shaking as he tried to somehow find purchase in this strange, new world he suddenly found himself living in.
“We are to follow orders. It is not our place to judge the King,” the smaller of the guards said, though his voice was low and stiff.  “Nor is it yours, Raj’Inama,” he finished pointedly, though the two guards exchanged displeased looks.
“--Guess you never expect the Spanish Inquisition, right?” Tony asked with a brittle smile. “Sorry. Sorry, I’m just—I’m trying to figure out how to say this. I practiced it God knows how many times, but now, it’s happening, and…well.  Okay. Okay, so, here we go.”
“They took you from me.  They took you, and I couldn’t find you,” Steve husked out.  The hand on Tony’s neck flexed, not hard, not really, but hard enough Tony could feel the power there.  He leaned into it, feeling Steve’s thumb rub soothingly against the pulse point there.  “Three months.  Three months.  I couldn’t eat.  I couldn’t sleep.  All I could think about was if you were hurt.  Or scared.  Or—“ he stopped, looked away.  One hand dropped to his leg, rubbing at the top of his thigh.  Tony covered Steve’s hand with his own, stilling the motion, then locking his fingers between Steve’s.
“Can you possibly flirt with her when she’s actually in the room?” Steve requested with slight roll of his eyes.
“Anyway, Switzerland!  That sounds so romantic!” Maria burst out with false gaiety.  “You’ll love it, Anthony.  A trip abroad.  How exciting! Oh, their chocolates are divine.  Like heaven. Have them melt those in some milk for you.  You’ll never want to drink anything else.  Do you remember, Howard?  They used to bring it to me at the chalet while you were off skiing. Such a lovely country,” she recalled.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve replied in a clipped, precise tone that made Tony think of nails on a chalkboard.
“Don’t get all offended, now, Bruce.  Or, do, actually. Steve doesn’t believe me about your temper, and you know how very much I enjoy being proven right,” Tony said, a gleam in his eye as he looked over his shoulder where Steve trailed behind them.
Well, it was rather sterile in there, Tony considered. Steve was an artist.  He probably liked color and texture and artistic things. Furniture and lighting were a start. But it needed something else. Something artistic, because Steve was artistic, and Tony loved artistic things.  Like Steve.  Pepper might be surprised to hear that Tony loved artistic things, but it was nonetheless quite true.  Tony should see about some paint to go with the furniture.  “What’s your favorite color?” Tony asked curiously.
There was a trap in those words, Steve knew. Hiding underneath them, covered in sand, perhaps, lay a pit for him to fall into, and ask, again, for something Tony could not—or would not—give him.
“It won’t be easy,” Tony continued.  “Being with me.  The press, yeah, they suck, when they aren’t being useful.  But, there’s…,” he stopped, rubbing at his forehead with the pad of his thumb.  He wanted to sweep Steve off his feet, not talk about the admittedly long litany of reasons Steve should run like hell.  But, he supposed, they’d loved each other like kids, and that hadn’t worked out so well.  Loving each other like adults meant actually talking about things and being upfront with each other, and for Steve, he could hold up the mirror and actually look at the reflection.  “I work.  A lot.  Weird hours.  If this clean energy thing takes off, it’ll be even more time away from you, and I know, the timing sucks, but I’ve got to be out front with that.  I’m eight years sober, but I still go to meetings.  Carol—Rhodey’s ex—she’s my sponsor.  I forget things like birthdays and anniversaries.  I try to control things, because I’m scared shitless most of the time.  About messing this up.  Losing you.  Which probably means I’m going to mess it up, and I can’t seem to make myself stop, even when I see it coming.  I want this too much.  So…yeah.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Steve replied, shifting Tony’s weight slightly while he pressed firmly against the wound on Tony’s chest.
He didn’t seem to need a response. Tony stepped behind him and unclasped the chain that connected to the top of the hook, then slowly eased it out of Steve’s hole. It’s absence left him feeling empty and sore, with a low, pulsing ache that settled somewhere deep inside.
Tony ignored the question and walked over to stand behind Steve’s chair, bracing his hands along the edge of the back as if he could keep Steve in place, keep the focus on the team and talk of tactics and pretend the gulf between them was distance and a roster of names.
Steve had already mastered the basics of the speech to text dictation software, which largely ran itself once you clicked it on.  Tony walked him through a few other features, like the auto-click, and helped set up some shortcuts to reduce Steve’s need to use the touchpad or mouse.  He also set up the predictive assessment tool, which would learn from Steve’s patterns and searches and further help reduce the need for typing or touchpad use, talking through what he was doing while Steve listened attentively.
“It is settled.  You need not think on it again,” Tony told him firmly.  “You are…you…” he stopped and looked away, mouth twisting in frustration before he sucked in a shaky breath and looked back at Steve.  His eyes were wide, shining bright in the low light of the torches, his face drawn tight.  A muscle twitched in his jaw, but his touch was gentle, as always.  “You give me all that I need.”  He cupped his hand over the side of Steve’s face, and Steve leaned into the touch, seeking it, as he always did, but this time, it was different, something passing between them that felt like a promise.
.  Follow wherever the voice inside his head wanted him to go, and he would know.  He was almost sure of it. It was true that he was frightened, but probably not as much as he should be, Steve realized after a moment.
“I’m on pins and needles.  Figuratively.  I actually think that might be a bolt of some kind.  Literally getting screwed.  Who knew? Anyway, so, yeah, art. Therapy.  Go,” Kirk huffed out with a wave of his hand.
“Can’t return a gift,” Steve agreed softly, smiling hesitantly over at Tony as he held open the door.
“Someone had better start talking,” Tony muttered, looking between Sam and Barnes.  “Look, you two were over at our house yesterday morning, eating our leftovers and bitching about the Yankees—”
“Please tell me you said a mule,” Tony said, stepping out from the dressing room in just his breeches and boots.
“Always do,” Tony smiled and shoved a pair of sunglasses from his pocket onto his face, shielding his eyes.
The camera had panned away from the two women, taking in the lake, dotted with other homes and docks reaching out like wooden fingers, and the low, rocky mountains beyond, where the sun was lowering behind the tree-studded peaks. The camera’s view slowed, seemingly transfixed by the momentary beauty of the scene, catching the sun just as it dipped beneath the veil of mountains, a last, bright gasp of golden color before the landscape was blanketed in a gray, evening haze.
“Yeah, it’s ok.  Sore.  It’ll be healed up by morning, most likely,” Steve said, shrugging, then remembering he really ought not do that when a sharp pain spiked through his shoulder.  “Itches a bit.”
“Yes,” Steve admitted, shifting his eyes away for a moment before he dragged his gaze back to where Tony was watching him with the intense sort of focus he seemed to reserve for Steve or his machines.  He felt himself tense, but held Tony’s gaze.
“No, it won’t,” Tony sighed. He sounded sad or… resigned, Steve thought, which Steve found fascinating, given that he just about figured that the man--or whatever he was--was here to kill him.
“One of the votes is really for you, though, so.  If you, you know, had a preference.  Ellis seems decent enough, I guess,” Steve observed, brow crinkling into a frown that was frustratingly adorable.  Steve looked a bit like he wanted to bang the photos of the candidates into the table, crinkle the paper up and put it back together until he got a pattern he liked better.  Like giving a toddler a Rubik’s cube.  “Says he’s gotten some endorsements from the Chamber of Commerce, industry groups, that kind of thing.  Might be good for SI.”
him.  It did something to Tony.  He couldn’t explain it.  Maybe he should have been afraid or felt debased in some way, to be used like that, and that was what Steve was doing.  Using him to fill some need, some deep, primal urge to take, to have, to
“Look, I just… I need to do this.  For closure or something, I don’t know.  But, I need to, okay?” Steve said, sighing and dropping his fork to his plate with a clatter as he pushed back in his chair and ran a hand through his hair.  Steve’s phone buzzed, and he glanced down at it.
“Can you?” Stark asked, then hummed lowly, the light catching his expression pulling into something sharper. He sounded curious or...bemused, maybe, Steve thought.
Jarvis would tell him he had his Issues on speed dial.  Well, he wouldn’t say it like that.  He’d use Jarvis-speak and probably suggest something stupidly helpful like tea and actually telling Steve how he felt.  9-1-1, what is your emergency?  I kissed my Alpha, and he kissed me back, and there’s a knotting wrap in his closet and my picture in a book I think he reads because he likes me?  Send help.
“They want to feel special, Steve. Not as if  you just happened to find time for them, but that you are always looking forward to seeing them.  It’s part of the fantasy for them.  So, no, I will not call Mr. Stark, Tony Stark of Stark Industries, one of the largest and most lucrative companies in the world, and tell him your busy schedule has suddenly cleared and you now have room for him,” she finished with a note of warning in her voice.
“On the airstrip, right after you and Colonel Rhodes landed.  I said, ‘Welcome to Bagram, Mr. Stark.  I understand the items for your weapons demonstration have arrived ahead of you and are being deployed to the staging area’,” Steve continued.  “And you said—“
“Keep telling yourself that.  That’s what I do.  You can see how well its working out for me,” Tony deadpanned, spreading his hands wide.  “Ready?” he asked, nodding towards the door as the car slowed to a halt in front of the Rio’s entrance.  “Showtime, then,” Tony said at Steve’s stiff-necked nod.
“Tony,” Bruce said gently.  “Don’t…this isn’t as bad as it looks.  The repulsor actually cauterized most of the wound.  This isn’t the problem.  I mean, it’s not good, but—ah,” he cut himself off at Natasha’s sharp, annoyed look.  “Um, he’s got a puncture through his back. That’s where the blood loss is coming from, and I think it might have nicked the liver.  Maybe the spleen, too, I don’t know. Whatever it was, it wasn’t anything to do with you.  Something either from the explosion or on impact, I don’t know.”
A few drinks, give or take a few, later, and Tony was leaning against the now-padded headboard of his bed, carefully plucking the feathers from one of the pillows that had littered the floor of his bedroom.
“It’s a type of long, small weasel-like animal, known for its beautiful pelt and quick bite where he comes from,” a man said, riding up next to them.  He was older, thin, and spoke with some kind of accent Tony couldn’t place.
Steve nodded.  He knew his eyes must be the size of the coins Cam had thrown to the crowd earlier in the day.  He couldn’t quite process Tony’s words.  There was no context for them.  He wet his lips and watched Tony’s eyes narrow on the movement.
Since he didn’t really have much of a choice, he followed Coulson back to the elevator, which took them down two floors to what served as the Medical wing for the base, cheerily decorated in post-apocalypse dystopian-edition chrome and the utilitarian line of beige, lighter beige and this-won’t-show-barf-beige.  Charming.
Steve was lying on the surgical table, surrounded by a gauntlet of doctors and nurses holding long, thin metal instruments made for cutting.  His hair was mussed. It stuck up in spikes at the crown and was slicked down with sweat on the sides.  That was the first thing Tony noticed.  Something inconsequential, but off.  His gaze trailed down the rest of Steve’s form, taking it all in, or trying to.
Maybe it was like Tony’s other picture. Maybe Tony was giving everyone in the room the finger on the inside, Steve thought with a mental laugh, side-eying Tony again.   He was beginning to see how much of Tony was hidden under these layers, the way paintings became coated with layers of dirt and detritus over the years, keeping their true form hidden from view underneath. If he looked at those pictures now, would Tony’s smile seem so bright?  Or would he know enough now to see it didn’t quite reach his eyes?  Or maybe it was just Steve.
He wasn’t jealous.  Not of some poor, likely long-dead Omega who got through the war by doing whatever it took.   Steve loved him, Tony, and they did plenty of
“Good,” Tony said.  His voice tremored, and he dropped his gaze to their hands, then lifted his eyes again.  “I would never want that from you,” he said very quietly, but his eyes held Steve’s with a fierce intensity.
“I’m fine,” Steve replied.  Even through the door, Tony could hear the tension in Steve’s voice, turning it brittle and wrong.  “Didn’t mean to wake you.”
The plan was both insanely convoluted and essentially straightforward.  Use the machine Howard had been working on in the years after he first came across the Tesseract to go back in time and grab the cube before Thanos could.  Simple. Or, as simple as time travel could get. It was a terrible idea. A desperation play. An idea born out of an unwillingness to face what was right in front of them.  They failed. The Avengers failed. And now, half the universe was gone.
“I’ve no doubt of that,” Tony said gently, placing a hand on the boy’s head.  “She is well settled, then? Her room is to her liking?”
“Good, good,” Tony said to the wind.   This was so pathetically awkward.  He was trying to be normal about this and not scream at anyone who would listen that Steve—God,
“They come and eat my food and drink my wine and give me some dust-catching statue in return.  Honor has nothing to do with it,” the King replied. There was a loud thump, followed by a clattering sound, and Steve watched as parts of whatever the King had been working on scattered and fell from the table.  “Ah, damn it all to hell!” the King shouted, and a sweeping sound sent the whole thing crashing across the table.  A long sigh followed. Then quiet.  “And what does my harem Master want this time?  Surely, Lord Hammer is in dire need of your services this evening, what with it being a day where the sun rises and sets,” the King said in a tight, rough voice that reeked of annoyance at the distraction.
“’Please tell me you’re here to help me shoot off my missile’,” Tony quoted, remembering.   “Oh my God,” he groaned.  “You’re Hot Disapproving Guy!”
“Hmmm?  Oh, yeah. Right,” Tony remembered, nearly running to the bathroom to find something.  He came back out to the suite’s living area and tossed a towel, blanket, large tarp, whatever, to Steve, who caught it and managed to get it wrapped around himself with some semblance of modesty intact.
Thoughts like that were probably the reason Tony didn’t even notice the woman until she was shoving a handful of papers and pictures under his nose.
Clan were smaller than the Stranger, but sturdy and heavily muscled.  Anto thought of the man at the last Gathering who had his nose flattened and two teeth missing.  Tyber’s doing, Anto knew, though not over some Omega, but because Tyber had been angry at missing his chance on the hunt and accused the man of taking his kill, though the man had offered him half, as was custom.  Tyber had signaled Anto that night, he remembered, thinking about downcast eyes and heavy silence that hung in the air as he knelt and presented. They didn’t understand Tyber’s interest any more than Anto did, or why he was different with Anto than with other clan Omegas, but he was Omega and Tyber was Alpha and their leader, and they wouldn’t think to question it.  If anything, Anto, as undesirable as he was, should be grateful for Tyber’s interest. Perhaps the spirits would even grant him a child, if he pleased his Alpha well enough.
“Do you want me to decide?” Tony asked, voice soft and gentle.  That was good. Easier. He could reach.
“I love you, Tony,” Steve said. He tightened his grip on Tony’s hand and felt Tony’s hand do the same.  “Always.”  Steve felt Tony relax and heard him let out a breath. He smiled up at Steve.
“Beautiful,” Tony said, arranging the chain of pearls so that it hung from the end of the metal cock and dangled down between Steve’s cheeks.  Steve could feel each one of them, cool and strangely soft against the sensitive skin.  He could see the image in his mind, small ivory pearls dripping from the golden cock that filled him.  Tony made this, Steve thought, the idea spreading like a fog through his head.  Tony made this for him.  Wanted to see him like this.  It was a wondrously powerful thought.  Tony wanted this, and Steve had given it to him.
The wrongness of it, the incomprehensible wrongness of the whole thing, soured his stomach, making it roil and turn over.  He looked up and stared at the blank metal of the jet’s hull in front of him, one hand gripping the bags of blood while he tried to make some sense of something that refused to compute.  404 Error, he thought, with an edge of hysteria.  There was a low ringing in his ears.  He could hear it, drowning out the voices behind him, saying things he didn’t want to know.  He forced a deep, shaking breath into his lungs, and braced a hand against the side of the jet above his head, letting his weight lean into it for a moment.
“Come on, Tony! Think of it! You’re talking about the most powerful force on Earth,” Bruce reminded him. “It starts and ends wars, it makes people do the most extraordinary things, the most terrible things…the worst of ourselves and the highest expression of humanity, all in one. To be able to understand that…but, okay, sure, I can wax poetic about the science of that kind of love all day long…why are we talking about this? Didn’t think this was really your kind of thing.”
“Your distress is never a disturbance, Steve. You calmed soon enough, but I—I worried.  That last night had perhaps been too much and too soon.  I wondered that I shouldn’t push you too far, not with everything you’ve been through, but you…” he broke off and shook his head, mouth curling into a rueful smile.  “You always surprise me.  You were beautiful. Incredibly so. I don’t think I could ever tire of the feeling of watching you give yourself to me.  Your pleasure…it is truly a wondrous gift, my treasure.”
“Okay, so, that’s settled. I’ll invite Thor and Jane.  What about Old McDonald?  That, uh, guy who was in your unit?  With the farm,” Tony recalled.
Morning was announced by the room’s door banging open and two domestic slaves coming in, one bearing a tray of food and a new candle for the nook.  The other emptied the contents of the buckets into a larger pail and promptly leaving without so much as looking at Steve or Cam.  Breakfast appeared to consist of a hunk of bread and the same thin, brown gruel he’d been served yesterday.
recordings I previously downloaded from your personal server for him.”  That fucking radio.  Honestly, Tony was going to accidentally-on-purpose break the damn thing one day.  He ran a hand up and down over his face, a confused frown forming.  He had loaded the audio files on the radio for Steve, as promised.  Well, JARVIS had.  Tony hadn’t wanted to touch the thing with a ten-foot pole, for whatever reason.  He’d forgotten about the recordings, with everything that had happened since then.
.  This was a show for him, and Steve was playing some kind of part here, he knew, but he didn’t know what it was.  It wasn’t going to end well for him, though, of that much he was certain.
“I know, I just really like it,” Tony replied with a contented sigh. Steve snorted, but didn’t object.   “Are you hungry?   Of course, you’re hungry. Stupid question. Let’s get you something to eat,” Tony said, slowly peeling himself off of Steve and standing up on somewhat wobbly legs. They dressed, though Tony insisted on a V-neck for Steve because of reasons. Well, because Steve probably wouldn’t go for a tube top, however good he’d look in one.
Rumlow looked down at Steve, blood still pouring from his ear.  He walked up and slapped Steve hard enough to send him sideways into one of the guards holding him prone.  “I should’ve cut your cock off and shoved it down your throat the moment I saw you,” Rumlow spat out.  “When you’re done with him, send him back here and I will,” he promised, giving a quick look to the Lord, before turning and walking back toward the warehouse.
I’m more, Tony thought dazedly.  To him, I’m more.  Maybe that was what love was. Seeing someone as they were, flaws and faults and failings, and still seeing them as more of everything.  Use your special viewing, he thought.
“I wasn’t sure if I was really here earlier,” Tony told him. It seemed important, though he wasn’t sure why.  “But, I am,” he sighed.  “I’m here.  I don’t know where here is. How do you know where here is?”
Tony swallowed and felt his mouth twist.   “Nothing. Just checking in. You know. On your—“ he waved his hand in the air. “Science stuff.”
“So, ah.  Is the spark gone, or--” Tony began, clearing his throat and aiming for a humor that he didn’t at all feel.  “Look, I’m just--this is weird, okay? I think of myself as pretty open, bit of a risk-taker, and, hey, nothing like being on death’s door to really open yourself up to new adventures, but, this, well.  It’s a lot, you’ve got to understand, I just need to know what I’m getting myself into here, that’s-- “
“Stark? Sure. Hard to forget,” Bucky acknowledged.  “The fancy jet and gear, all the brass hanging out playing lapdogs for him. Hard to forget. I
How much the last few years had meant to him. What it felt like when Tony somehow tracked him down in some roadside diner in nowhere, Kansas and told him there was a place for him at the Tower when he was ready. That movie nights were one of the best parts of his life after the ice. That he liked sitting down in the workshop and talking about nothing, or just watching Tony work. How deeply grateful he was for how much Tony helped with Bucky, when God knew he didn’t owe Steve anything, let alone
Steve doubted that was true.  Steve doubted the man liked or disliked much of anything, not anymore.  Whoever he had once been had long ago been wiped away, and now the man had gone somewhere else in his mind, the same way those poor souls Steve remembered seeing after they liberated one of Shmidt’s camps had simply left themselves or gone so deep inside, they couldn’t find their way back.
“It was awful and terrible and I kind of nearly died, but I’m glad it happened.  Well, I don’t know if glad is the right word, but…like your—your best memory thing?  You got the shit kicked out of you, sure, but, you—you felt something change.  Something important.  That’s how it was for me,” Tony told him, breath hitching around the words.  “I can’t believe that was you,” Tony added after a moment, shaking his head and letting out a huff of disbelieving laughter.
“It…physically pains me to agree with that,” Tony said with a visible wince.  “But, I’ll allow it. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  Your turn.”
“A year ago, I thought all I was getting was a night of fun before the shit hit the fan,” Tony said.  “There I was, making goo-goo eyes at you, having no idea any of this was even possible. Jesus, that’s hard to believe.
“I was told I should allow him the dignity of his choice,” Steve replied.  “Guess I’m still having issues with that.”
Not that Steve had really done anything.  Of course, Steve wouldn’t do that on purpose.  He wouldn’t wrap his hand around the back of Tony’s neck and push down, press Tony down, until his forehead touched the floor and he was fully presented, slick and ready and open.   The concrete would be smooth and cold under him, hard against his knees, and good, God, it would feel so good, and smell a bit like oil, metallic and coppery, and—ow! Fuck.  Tony’s hand jerked to his mouth, and came away with a line of bright red along his finger.  He’d bitten his lip.  He traced his tongue over it, then pressed his hand to his mouth again, blinking and looking around the garage.
“We do sometimes,” Tony replied as close to truthfully as he could get, but it seemed enough to satisfy Steve.  The thing was, they didn’t really do this.  Go out together, and certainly not just the two of them. Not that he wouldn’t.  Of course, he would.  This was…nice.  The two of them.  Just being normal for a bit.  Or as close to it as the two of them could get. Two guys out together on what was definitely not a date.  Nope.  He was not thinking that he was on a date with Captain America.  Was not.  Was not. Was—okay, maybe a little, but only for his fifteen-year-old self who deserved this.
“Shellhead?” Steve called out, shading his eyes with one hand as he glanced around.  He stopped, breath catching in his throat. His heart slammed against his ribs.
The last thing Tony remembered was Arnold telling the Predator it was one ugly motherfucker.  When he woke up, he was tucked in his bed with his shoes neatly lined up next to his dresser, the laces even tucked inside.  He groaned and rolled over, scrubbing a hand over his face.  Tonight was the gala.  He should get up and iron his suit.  Maybe spend some quality grooming time.
“There’s a witness,” Pepper said. “From the penthouse. Someone was up there and supposedly overheard the whole thing with Stern.”
“Tony, slow down,” Steve urged as gently as he could. “It’s fine. It’s--actually, it’s kind of funny when you think about it.  I thought it was, anyway. I thought it was,”
“I know what you dream, Steve,” Tony told him, his voice grim, but determined.  “I thought I could ignore it.  I told myself that I would never--you were a child, an innocent.  In my life before--when I was human--I was...not a good person.  I whored and drank and cared only for my own pleasures. My selfishness and my lack of care for those entrusted to my protection were responsible for far too many innocents losing their lives.  Including the man who saved me from death, giving me this chance, and that’s what this is, Steve.  A chance, Steve, a chance to be better than I was before. I swore--I made a
Steve’s face hardened.  He’d had enough of whatever it was Stane was suggesting, wanted to find Tony and…somehow protect him from all this.  How, he had no idea.  If Stane told the Board about Steve’s relationship with Tony, there was no telling what they would do.  The thought made his stomach clench.  It had never occurred to him that somehow this could hurt Tony’s business.  There had to be a way to counteract that, though, something that Steve’s jumbled mind wasn’t thinking of.  Tony, though.  Tony would know what to do.  This was Tony’s world.  He lived and breathed it.  He’d figure something out.  Steve had to believe that.  The idea that he had somehow cost Tony this…this much…he just couldn’t.  It was too horrible to contemplate.
When the coffee machine beeped its readiness, he poured it into a thermal carafe and arranged everything on a bamboo tray. The towels he had bought for the occasion were next, soft Turkish cotton cloths he had found in one of the specialty shops downtown that catered to Omegas. He added a few drops of sandalwood oil to each towel, because he knew that Tony liked the smell, then wet them and wrung them out. They went into the microwave next to warm them. Traditionally, it would be done over hot stones, but he figured Tony wouldn’t mind if he skipped a step. He rolled them up carefully to keep the heat in and placed them inside a small clay pot he’d purchased at the same shop, nothing fancy, but with a delicate pattern of small circles around the lip that had reminded him of the reactor. Steve put the lid on the clay pot and added it to the tray next to the food, fiddling with the arrangement a bit until he was satisfied. He carried the tray down the long hall to the bedroom, then stopped in front of the door.

Tony’s tongue teased over Steve’s lips, his beard scraping against Steve’s skin as he delved lower, across Steve’s jaw and down his neck, nipping and sucking as he went.  The sting of Tony’s teeth, the rough feel of his beard, the catch of the chains against the taut peaks of his nipples, the hard, rough roll of the chains across his cock, it was almost too much. Too good.  His legs were shaking. His cock ached. His vision was hazy as white stars danced at the edges. All Steve could manage to do was tip his head back, close his eyes and let out a groan.
“I’m sure, and no, thanks hon, I’m fine,” Steve said, clearly trying not to smile, so Tony assumed he was pleased with the dinner plans.
His father never came home.  Steve expressed what he thought was the proper dismay at this happening, but something niggled in the back of his mind, dancing away every time he tried to think too hard on it.  Commonly accepted knowledge said that Joseph Rogers fell into the river and drowned on his way to the tavern down in Gulleytown, though by the time his body washed up down at the lock, it was so bloated and picked over so badly, it was hard to say what might have led to such a fate.  At least, that was what Bucky heard, and he somewhat haltingly shared this information with Steve.  Steve thought Bucky might have expected him to be sad about it, and he was, in a way, but mostly, all he felt was relief.   Bucky, at least, got to say good riddance out loud.
“Still can’t believe you caught up to me.  How many classes did you test out of?  No. Don’t tell me.  I’ll just cry,” Rhodey sighed.  “Alright, alright, let’s go.”
“Seriously.  J-man, you see what I mean?  I leave them alone for five minutes, and this is what happens. Every. Damn. Time,” Rhodey said as he leaned a shoulder against the bedroom door.
“Well, I don’t know about ‘do art’ but I actually had plans to go to art school before the war broke out.  I still dabble a bit.  Just maybe give your designers something to go by?” Steve tried, knowing he probably sounded ridiculous, but somehow it was important that he draw Tony not some random person in SI’s graphic design department who had probably never met Tony and certainly had never seen him piggyback a missile through a portal in space.  Hard to impart that level of knowledge based on Google image searches.  And Steve was frankly somewhat dismayed to think what those might produce anyway.
“No.  Well.  I mean.  Now that I know that you…feel the way you feel, and I feel the way I feel.  It would be okay if maybe
It was awful, to be standing there like this, though Steve couldn’t quite put his finger on why, except that he suddenly felt ridiculous, standing in Tony Stark’s hotel room in his old Army dress blues.  This had been a terrible idea. He wasn’t this person anymore. He was the stripper hired to pretend he could ever have something with someone like Tony, not whoever this person was he was trying to be again.  He couldn’t have that. He couldn’t be that. Tony, of course, looked fantastic. Amazing. The tuxedo fit him like it had been made for him, which it probably had, Steve realized. People like Tony did that. People like Tony—God, what the hell was he even doing here? He didn’t belong here, next to someone like Tony.  He shouldn’t be here.
“A different—I like the cabin. I don’t want to leave the cabin—wait, you are?  You’re going, too?  You’re not…sending me away?” Tony asked, blinking down at Steve.
Tony unbuttoned his shirt to the middle and pulled it apart enough to see the curve of the reactor sitting in the center of his chest.  A webbed map of raised lines branched outward, faded now, but still there.  He wondered if that was why the skin always felt tighter, because it was pulled together into scars.  He sucked in a breath that went down cold and drew his eyes back to the mirror.  Steve had asked, of course.  He hadn’t pressed, but he’d asked.  Did they touch you?  Not like that, Tony assured him, wrapped safe in Steve’s arms, when it had all seemed further away than it did when he was alone.  I had my pills with me.  Don’t worry.  They wanted me to work. To build.
“I didn’t mean—last night was great.  Amazing. Like, seriously, you have no idea, but trust me, I have something of a metric for comparison, and I’m telling you—Ah-May-Zing,” Tony assured him, turning around and looking up at Steve’s raised eyebrows and playful, teasing expression. “Buuuut, you know that, and you know what I meant, you’re just a giant troll. An amazing, massaging giant…troll.  What am I saying? God, I need coffee. My brain is mush. I blame you. You and your---magic fingers or whatever,” he added accusingly, while Steve smirked. “Wait,” Tony paused, wiping a wet hand over his brow where trails of sudsy water were leaking down towards his eyes. “Seriously. Coffee,” he added with emphasis.
“God, you taste amazing,” Tony gasped, panting a bit as he pulled away.  “Look amazing, too,” he observed with a pleased note in his voice.  “Needy and desperate is a very, very good look for you.”
Tony sighed in obvious frustration and ran a hand through his hair, leaving it in even more disarray than Steve’s grip on it had. He was nodding to himself, hands on his hips, like he was having an internal debate. When he finally looked at Steve, there was a small smile playing on his lips, and Steve half expected him to tell Clint to go tend the horses or some such, but Tony just picked up Steve’s hand and tugged.  “Come.  Let’s return to camp and see if we can’t get a bit more sleep before Rhodey has us up at some ridiculous hour,” Tony muttered.
“Hey, you,” Tony replied with an easy grin as he turned around.  “So. That was fun.  One small kitchen fire, but otherwise, fairly without incident for one of our get-togethers.”
“Tony,” Steve said, tugging a bit at Tony’s hand.  “Hey there,” he said when Tony opened his eyes and turned to look at him.
“Yes, of course, Your Highness,” Cam said formally and bowed low, before grinning widely and scampering off to see whatever it was that waited for him back in their rooms.
“Unfortunate,” the buyer remarked, seemingly without interest, though Steve watched as the man’s head cocked to one side, eyes narrowing as he examined Steve.  The man had a smooth head, tan skin that wasn’t from working outdoors and spoke with a mealy-mouthed precision that sounded practiced.  The man moved behind him.  Steve kept his eyes straight ahead.  Every once in a while, someone would open the warehouse’s wooden door, and he could get a glimpse of sand and a small, bright strip of blue beyond it, where the sea lapped against the grey rocks along the shore and seabirds danced in and out of the waves, looking for fish and crabs caught on the boulders.
“You think I’ve loved someone who lives in a box of memories, but I love the guy who stood out on the street, saw me for the first time after a decade of hating me, and asked if I was okay.  The guy who sees my Tower for what it is?  He’s the same one who sees me for who I am.  The guy who gives me checks he’s held onto for a decade because they make me happy,” Tony tried, his voice quavering as he spoke.  “The guy who should hate me enough to want to take everything from me, but who keeps giving me what he can, over and over.  That’s the guy I want to get to know.   I think---I think that guy and I.  I think we’d have a shot.  I think we could be good together.”
“I know, I know, we’re not that old, right? And you, look at you!  Putting a ring on it and all that,” Hammer continued, unabated. “Living the dream, man.  Living. The. Dream. Marrying a stripper, that’s like—that’s like full-on Tony Stark modus operandi to the max, right? Twelve for twelve Maxim cover girls, this guy right here,” Hammer added, pointing at Tony and looking around at the other guests to make sure everyone was paying attention.  “
In addition to having to skirt areas too damaged by Pierce’s assault to allow for their passage, part of the reason their journey took so long was due to all the additional provisions they were carrying, far beyond anything Steve was used to seeing even at Fury’s camp. Along with triple the soldiers he had requested, there were more supplies, weapons and armor than Steve had quite known what to do with, even given the importance of their mission.
“I--I tried to go talk to you again. I thought, maybe you'd change your mind. Maybe I could show you—you know, what I did with place, but then...then, you know,” Steve stammered, eyes dropping away from Tony's face. “They said I had to leave, so. So, that was it, I guess.”
that for him, Steve told himself firmly.  Tony deserved that kind of happiness. A real family, not this makeshift bunch of foundlings Tony cobbled together around him.  Steve could almost see it, if he closed his eyes, this future where Tony was surrounded by people who loved him and who he loved, and Steve was some long-forgotten memory.
“Would you like to sit down?” Rogers asked, nodding his head towards the conference table.  Maybe this was the interview portion, Tony thought dully. Let’s see….he wanted to be a good Omega, please his Alpha and world peace.  Of course.
“You could always tell Lord Rand that you can’t attend the tourney because your concubine’s need for you is too great.  I would be willing to provide whatever cover such a ruse required. Purely in the interest of you avoiding discomfort, of course,” Steve suggested with a small smile.  That earned a surprised bark of laughter from Tony, and a quick kiss to the center of Steve’s chest, just below his ribs, where Tony flattened his cheek, using Steve as a pillow.
“I am!” Tony burst out.  “I’m pleased.  Like, super-pleased.  Crazy-pleased.  Why wouldn’t I be?  First Omega to go to MIT.  Probably a big honor, huh?  This is me. Totally and completely pleased.”
.  Of course, he was sending Tony away.  Captain America.  Jesus.  Steve could have anyone.  Literally anyone, and he’d gotten stuck with some SHIELD hanger-on’s kid who he clearly didn’t want and didn’t need.  Captain America. Needing Tony Stark.  It was laughable.  It was so laughable, he wanted to cry.
“Your name is Cam, right?” the King asked.  Cam nodded.  “Is he demanding?  He is, isn’t he?  Always wanting you to fetch him treats from the kitchens, fan him all day so he doesn’t break a sweat, tell him how fine he looks, that sort of thing?” the King asked, waggling his eyebrows a bit at Cam.
Tony should have a ring, though, Steve thought.  A Bonding ring.  Tony hadn’t asked about it, but Steve had checked. That was still something people did.  Exchanged Bonding rings.  Tony was probably expecting something, and Steve was, of course, behind the ball, he thought with a mental sigh.  He wanted something nice for Tony, of course. but not too flashy. He didn’t think Tony would want a big diamond or something like that. At least, he hadn’t noticed anything remotely like that in Tony’s room, and Tony hadn’t dropped any hints that Steve picked up on, the way Steve sort of imagined an Omega would, at least they had done that in a couple of the movies Steve remembered watching.  Leaving a page in a magazine open, talking about someone else’s ring, those kinds of things. Tony didn’t do that.
“If you take that off, it should be hitting my floor,” Tony muttered, head tilting to the side as he regarded Steve.
“You did.  I’ve got it right here, in writing, signed even,” Tony said, pulling out the creased check and spreading it flat, face down between his fingertips.
Just move, he told himself.  That’s what one of the other dancers had told him after his first, somewhat disastrous, performance.  Just move. No one cares if you’re Fred Astaire or not. Which was good, because as Bucky liked to point out, on the list of things Steve was good at, dancing wasn’t exactly making the top ten.   He toed his shoes off first, settling in as the soft, bluesy music got going.
He pulled back and looked down at Anto for a long moment.  It was still strange to Anto how much the Others seemed to look at each other.  For Clan, it was rude for Omega to look at Alpha like this, but Steve seemed to like to look at him, and Anto liked looking at Steve, so he thought, maybe it would be okay, though only with Steve, he thought.   He dropped his eyes to Steve’s chest, only to have Steve lift his chin up with the curve of his hand. He blinked up at Steve, watching Steve’s dark eyes as they seemed to search his face. He felt Steve’s hand leave his chin to cradle the back of his head, fingers massaging at the base of his neck until Anto shivered.
than it once did.  A mate could be good for you.  Help settle you, perhaps?  We know Omegas are stabilizing influences on their Alphas, and offer Alphas an outlet for those baser urges that can cause such a problem—“
“Yeah, I know.  Sorry,” Tony apologized at Steve’s look.  “Seemed like a good idea at the time, I guess.”
“What nonsense is this? Beautiful abstractions.  I love them all, and I am surely the best judge of these things. Ask anyone, and they shall tell you this is true,” Tony said with an exaggeratedly confused frown and a twinkle in his eye.  “Besides, I’ve heard not a single word of criticism of them. Only that I have discovered who will surely become the finest sculptor in the land if only I continue to employ Master Len indefinitely so as to groom such talent,” Tony added, mouth lifting into a wickedly pleased grin that he tossed Steve’s way. His gaze softened then and his smile went loose, eyes crinkling at their corners.  He stopped and took Steve’s hand, bringing it up to brush his lips across the backs of Steve’s knuckles, his warm breath prickling the skin up and down Steve’s arm. “You really are talented, my treasure.  I would love anything made from your hands and mind, that is true, but my newly installed Lady Chamberlain insists I play patron for enough artists and Enclaves that I can’t help but know a little of it.  You are learning, yes, but there is talent there.  I can see it as plainly as Master Len can.  His enthusiasm is not entirely self-serving, you know.”
Steve wasn’t sure what that meant, until he found himself chained to the back of the wagon, forced to walk behind as it trundled away from the port, following in the wake of the Lord’s carriage, a smaller one for his servants, another wagon loaded with goods and a host of outriders flanking them.  At least they moved his arms in front of him, though they left the length of heavy chain between his ankles, making each step that much more difficult.  Move, he told himself, as the wagon jerked him forward.  There wasn’t really any other option.  His legs still hurt from being strung up for so long this morning and shook with the effort.  Even at that slow pace, he had to hurry to keep up.  Every motion of the wagon pulled at his already sore arms.  A few hours in, and he was desperate for something to drink.  His throat tasted of the sand and grit that spewed off the wheels of the wagon.  He wanted to stop, rest, anything, but if he did, he wasn’t sure if he could get up again.  So, he kept moving.  One foot in front of the other.
“It's just...I thought I was done having feelings about that,” Tony responded on a shaky breath that he couldn’t quite catch.  He closed his eyes for a moment and covered his face with his hands, then shook his head clear and dropped his arms to his sides.  “Jesus. Fuck.  You're Captain America.  The--the ice, and--and God, seventy years, Steve, fuck.  And now, you're telling me Howard didn't manage to slam them into tree all on his own, and
life.  What a fucking joke.  It had never been his life, not his own, not in the way that he imagined it must be for other people. He was someone else now, but he’d never really been him, so what did it matter?  They’d sloughed off his entire identity and given him another with the stroke of a pen, and were too busy patting themselves on the back for their sheer awesomeness to notice Tony’s world crumbling in on him.
“Yeah?” Tony asked softly, brows arching in question.  He planted his elbow on the back of the sofa and leaned his head against his fist, returning Steve’s look.  A soft smile played on his lips, warming his eyes.
Steve, unfortunately, while somewhat annoyingly overly concerned about Tony’s drinking habits, had, of course, been too nice to take advantage.  It turned out that he was some kind of strategic analyst at SHIELD, which is how he knew Howard and how he ended up at Tony’s Post-Kidnapping Party that he supposed his parents threw with the money they saved by not paying the ransom the kidnappers had demanded.   Good times.
He was down the stairs and out the door, greeting Happy with a genuine smile.  Happy opened the back passenger door for him and he climbed in, sinking back into the deep, leather seats.  The ride back to Tony’s place was pleasant enough.  He made small talk with Happy from time to time, wondering briefly how odd this must be for the chauffer, but mostly just watched the world go by.  He’d missed most of it last night, but much of the drive down the coast was stunning.  They pulled into Tony’s driveway, the gate swinging open for them automatically, and arrived back at Tony’s house in what seemed like less time than last night’s trip had taken, but that was probably because last night’s drive had been a bit of a blur.  He hopped out of the car on his own, nodding his thanks at Happy and trying to walk nonchalantly to the front doors.  Standing in front of them, he searched for a doorbell on the flat walls, but nothing was obvious.  Feeling rather stupid now, he was about to knock when a disembodied British voice announced, “Welcome back, Sir.  Please come in.  Mr. Stark will be with you momentarily.”  With that, the front doors opened on their own, because of course they did, Steve thought, smiling a little.
“Isn’t it still pouring out there? I swear I saw animals going two-by-two on my way in,” Tony remarked, realizing that he was agreeing when he’d meant to tell Michelangelo here he was leaving, painting or no. Apparently, he was quite that desperate, he thought as he stood up from the futon and walked over to the small window, easing carefully around the easel. Rivulets of water were running down the pane, though it didn’t look like quite the deluge it had been when he’d dashed from where he left the car on the side of the building. He didn’t want to leave, not yet, though he couldn’t quite grasp the why of that. It was just there, ridiculous as the situation was. Maybe it was the surreality of the whole thing that was keeping him, like he’d fallen into a story that he needed to finish.
, and a few others that Steve couldn’t decipher, many of which seemed to be written in strange alphabets that Steve had never seen before.
It turned out to be less of a trail than Steve had assumed. He should have checked it first and made sure it was clear before bringing Tony down, he thought, stomach twisting with embarrassment.  He kept looking at Tony, who didn’t seem particularly bothered at the oversight, though he occasionally gave the overgrowth a baleful look.
It had been burned into his skin.  Melted through into a deep swath of Steve’s side that was just…gone.
“The King wants you,” Zola announced.  He didn’t look especially pleased about it, either.  Steve scrubbed a hand over his face and stood up, keeping the towel at his waist as he did.  “Come, come, hurry now,” Zola urged, snapping his fingers for emphasis.  “No time. He’s in a mood.”
“You don’t want it,” Steve observed flatly as the car pulled to a halt in front of the large, wooden front door that was set into the rounded, tile-roofed turret that formed the front of the mansion.  Out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see Steve bite his lip and look down at his hand holding the offending box, brow ridged with frown lines like the damn thing held the Enigma Code.
“Steve. It’s—St--I’m Steve,” Steve replied.  Wait. Was he? No, he was Roger. Roger Grant.  Damn it. Tony had him all twisted in knots. At least that feeling was familiar, Steve supposed with a frustrated sigh.
“I just have one more question…” Tony said, taking a long swallow from his water bottle.  “Why does that Clint guy keep sending me an eVite for a ‘Hot Tub Time Machine Party’?”
Tony grunted in response.  “Nat could’ve done better,” he said with a shrug, but he kept his voice light.  He’d always liked Natasha.  Smart, scarily fierce sometimes, but she’d always been nice to Tony, and managed to get Barnes to play nice.  Hell, he’d even liked Barnes well enough, eventually.  They’d gone round and round on the who-loves-Steve-best carousel of fun for a few months before finally settling on the profoundly world-altering view that maybe Steve had enough love for both of them.
“When I file the patent applications at two a.m., I’m blaming you,” Tony said, scowling at Steve with as much mock indignation as he could muster.
“Deeper,” Steve said, letting his shoulders relax against the bed, and head loll back, eyes locking on Tony’s.  “Harder.  More.”
“Because I’m an idiot,” Steve answered blearily, sounding extremely pleased with himself. He could practically hear the lazy smile in Steve’s voice. Tony crawled out of the bed and disassembled the suit back into the briefcase. That was going to need a thorough cleaning, Tony thought with a lascivious grin. He undressed and took a couple of power bars from his suitcase, then mixed the electrolyte powder with some water from the room’s mini-fridge and brought the glass and snacks to Steve.
“I see you found your way back,” Tony slurred.  “Feel free to take a load off,” Tony suggested, pointing the tumbler of amber liquid at the bed.  “Hard day of unplanned bonding, SHIELD briefings, hormone-crazed Alphas, evil robot attacks and all that.  You can rank those according to suckitude, if you like.”
The Tower’s garage door opened automatically for him, and Steve parked his bike in its usual spot, then took the elevator all the way up to the living quarters. From the elevator vestibule, he could hear the party in full swing in the living room, with occasional bursts of laughter filtering through.
“I don’t understand,” Steve said, shaking his head and frowning. Tony looked down at him, his expression full of such regret it pulled at somewhere deep in Steve’s chest.  He wanted Tony to stop, swallow back the words, dispense with the thoughts and take him to bed, make him feel and forget, and let Steve wipe away whatever it was that troubled Tony this much.
people, when I wanted to give orders or get them to do something, and that’s maybe what I’m doing with you, I don’t know. You’d probably splash me if you got bored, I reckon.  Though, I gotta say, you do manage to make your feelings known just fine. Who you?” Steve grinned when the creature looked taken aback and put a hand to its chest, as if startled by such a scurrilous accusation.  “Yeah, you. Come on now, you know you do! You hurled a coconut at me when you got annoyed I wasn’t putting that board for the lean-to in the right place. It did not, ‘slip out of your hand,” Steve said, rolling his eyes as the creature mimed something that resembled dropping a coconut.  “That was on purpose, I know it was. Your aim is too good,” he laughed.
The cloth was warm against Steve’s cheek when Tony held it up, wiping gently at the dirt and grime there, cooler against the other side, but Steve instantly felt cleaner.  Tony was working the soapy cloth down the column of Steve’s throat, over his collarbones and along the ridge of his shoulders, slow and methodical.  Solving a problem, Steve thought.  Finding a solution.  Today, that meant getting Steve cleaned up.
“Huh?  Me? No—I—no.  I mean, I’d understand, if you, you know, needed someone.  On the side kind of a thing.  That’d be fine, if you wanted,” Tony stammered, the words sort of falling over themselves in his rush to get them out.  It didn’t register what he’d said until the words were already out, sitting there in the space between them, while Tony stared, horrified, at the gaping wound they left that he couldn’t quite figure out how to close.  “The whole first, second thing, that’s kind of awkward, though, right?  I’m guessing.  It seemed awkward.  When she—when she mentioned it.  Maybe it’s good for some people, I suppose. Some couples, maybe that’s good.  For them.  Extra help or, like, companionship, maybe, I don’t know—I don’t…For us, though, I don’t think…I don’t…I was thinking we didn’t really need that.  So much.  Unless you think we do.”
“Gonna have to start helping with the rent if you keep showing up,” Steve said without missing a beat. “What are you doing here, Tony?” he asked in the same weary tone from last night. He shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on a hook behind the door, then walked over to the kitchen and started putting what looked like leftovers from his lunch away. “I said I'd drop the papers by tomorrow. Matt's on his way over, we'll go over everything, get 'em signed. You really don't need to look over my shoulder.”
“Can’t think of a better reason.  Well, technically, the starving children, but you get my point,” Tony said with a nod.
“We should stop soon, anyway,” Tony offered. “The sun starts to set.”  That wasn’t quite true, Steve noted, glancing up at the sky where the sun still shone bright and high between the branches, dappling the leaves and grasses with dots of light.  It wasn’t the first time Tony had called an early halt to their course, and Steve was not blind to why.  Subtlety had never been Tony’s strength.
“I’m sorry, Tony.  I thought I was maybe putting too much pressure on you.  Being too…forward,” Steve said, the smile dropping off his face.  Put it back, Tony thought.
“You wanted something.  And here you are,” Tony said with a snort, spreading his hands wide before crossing them across his chest.  “Do tell.  How may the King be of service to his concubine today?”
“Yes.  Yes, thank you, Jarvis,” Maria said, as if he needed her permission.  Steve heard the door bang shut and watched the room sort of deflate, as if that had let the air out along with Jarvis.  “I think it’s best for tonight if we all just—” Maria started.
“Cute,” she replied, giving him a half-smile.  “Charming, when he wanted to be or needed to be. Said all the right things when I talked to him.  How brilliant his father was, how hard he worked for the company, that kind of thing. Quiet a lot, though, but like he was right on the cusp of saying something, you know?” she huffed as she ran. “Like he would be loud, if he could, but he was hiding, keeping low, I don’t know. The dad’s a dick. Drinks too much,” she hefted her shoulders almost apologetically.
“So, I got this buddy at CCF. Army Central Clearing Facility,” Rhodey clarified at Tony's blank look. “See, Army doesn't run financial checks on enlistment like the Air Force does. Basically, the bullet-catchers'll take anyone,” Rhodey said with typical Air Force objectivity, though he held up his hands in front of him in a placating gesture. “No judgment.”
“I’m having another delivered, calm down, the animals will still cross or whatever,” Tony promised with a roll of his eyes.  Tony walked over to where Rhodey stood and grabbed at his shoulders, giving him a small shake. “It’s kismet, Rhodey. Come on.  You can’t fight fate!”
, so he slowly guided his hand off of Tony’s cock, thumbing at the slit as he did and earning a nice shudder from Tony, who sighed heavily at the loss.
No answer came to him now any more than it had any other night.  Finally, he drifted off, only to awaken with a jolt, drenched in sweat.  His heart was pounding.  He reached over, only to find the other side of the bed still empty.  Breathing in deeply, he tried to calm himself, but his whole body was quaking with the effort.  He rolled over and curled his legs up to his chest, stuffing his fist into his mouth to hold back a sob.  A dream, he told himself.  Just a dream.  The dream was already leaving him, but the terror of it held on.  Smoke searing his lungs.  His ears ringing with an explosion. Tony looking up at him from a rocky ground, mouth red with blood.
“He is a good man.  General Rhodes,” Steve said, feeling his stomach go cold.  He squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, breathed out, and looked down at Tony.  His throat worked, but no sound came out.
“Which tells us that this black hole is significantly more massive than any other,” Tony finished triumphantly.   He didn’t quite do jazz-hands, but, under pain of death, he wouldn’t entirely swear he didn’t do them, either.
“You have ideas.  About the Board.  Of Directors.  And you want to talk to me about them before rushing in and telling them all why they’re, and I’m quoting, if you remember, all a bunch of ‘knuckle-dragging, stone-bangers who wouldn’t know a good idea if the gods wrote it down, rolled it up, stuck it in a Coke bottle, dropped it in Africa, where it was found by a tribesman, who threw it off a cliff where it landed in the sand, rolled down a hill and literally spelled out Good Idea.’  I mean, you were very specific,” Pepper reminded him.  “Not saying you were wrong.  Just specific.  So, now you want to talk it out first?  Who is this and what have you done with Tony Stark?” she teased.
A handful of other Omegas milled about in small groups, chatting amiably, with occasional bursts of loud laughter.  Tony caught a few curious looks aimed in his direction.  Most everyone seemed to know each other, which made sense, he supposed.  Omegas were such a small part of the population as a whole. The stereotype that they all knew each other wasn’t completely without some merit.
“I don’t like thinking about that.  You.  By yourself when you needed—someone to take care of you.  But when I think about someone else…I don’t think…if he had…I don’t think I’d much care why,” Steve was saying, low and slow, his mouth barely moving as he spoke.  The words sounded slurry around the rush of blood pounding through Tony’s ears.  Tick-tock, he thought dazedly.  “I’m not sure what that says about me.”
“What, ah.  What would—“ Tony started, leaning back against the bench and rubbing his fingers against the side of his nose.  A nervous energy spiked through his chest, making his heart pound in his ears.  Steve would have courted him.  In his mind, he saw Steve with a bouquet of flowers, greeting Jarvis at the front door and felt a smile softening his face at the image.  “What would you have done?”
.  What is it that you want?  Hmmm?” Tony cut in sharply.  He leaned his hands on the table, splaying his fingers and rocked forward, closing his eyes for a moment before turning his head to look at Steve. “Tell me. What do you want that I have not already given you?  That is why you are here, is it not? Finally figured it out, did you?  Well. Out with it.  What is it? What is it that you want so very badly that you come here like this?  Speak it. This thing that you want,” Tony sneered, nearly vibrating with the effort to keep his anger contained.
Happy maneuvered the car into what amounted to half a space, good enough for New York parking. Tony pushed the car door open and climbed out.  Steve followed, and Rhodey scooted across the seat far enough to lean his head out.  Tony shook his head, and Rhodey grabbed the door handle and pulled it closed, leaving Steve and Tony standing in nearly the same spots they’d been standing in a few days ago when Tony had barreled back into Steve’s carefully ordered life and turned it upside down.
Under the notebook was a cigar box, one of those cheap, yellow, wooden ones with the shiny, gold edges. Inside, a white handkerchief with his initials sewn in red threads at one corner was wrapped around a small sprig of flowers. He recognized it as the one he’d shoved in Steve’s hand at his mom’s funeral, and the wispy, dried flowers were the gesture they’d carried with them that day, both too young to have to be that old. A dark red leather ring box sat in one corner of the cigar box, though Tony didn’t touch it. He knew what was inside, and if he looked at that now, he’d probably run from the building.
He was taken to a small room.  Two pallets lined the floor.  Two buckets, one empty, one with water, stood in a corner.  A single lamp burned behind a screen in a cubby cut into the wall.  Zola was waiting for him.  Of course.
“The one and only.  Though, Tony, please.  If we’re going to do this, we might as well suffer on a first-name basis. I take it you’re Steve,” Stark said, sliding easily into the seat across from Steve and picking up the rose, twirling the stem between his thumb and forefinger for a moment before setting it aside.  “There is a way I could verify that, but you’d probably be offended at this point in the evening.  Maybe later.  Anyway, so, Steve, my ex-girlfriend-slash-current-CEO…I tried to get her to let me go with EGSCC there, but she says it sounds like egg sack, and that was a hard no.  She thinks I have an issue with naming things appropriately, but to be fair, she goes by Pepper, so I don’t think she really wants names to be the hill she dies on, you know?  She tells me you’re an artist, ex-Army Captain, Brooklyn College.  Born and raised, so that makes sense—you think I didn’t look you up?” Stark broke off his soliloquy at what must have been Steve’s surprised look.
Tony scrubbed his face vigorously with both hands, then shook his head hard, trying to clear it, though he ended up looking at Steve again, letting out a groan of surrender and scraping his hands through his hair, leaving it wild.  He was still breathing hard, mouth working around words that wouldn’t come out, his eyes darting from Steve to any other place, then back again, as if he couldn’t quite stop looking.  His expression was one Steve had never quite seen before, of nearly unbearable awe and tenderness, pride and possessiveness, all rolled into one that warmed Steve’s skin and made his cock pound with desire.
“Shopping for a desk from Ikea, I hear,” Jarvis replied with a tip of the kettle in Tony’s direction.  Tony let out a surprised huff of laughter, then shook his head and grinned more fully at Jarvis.
A part of him wanted to Cameron Frye the thing over the side of the mountain. He thought he might hate it a little bit.  Or hate something, anyway.
“You know you’re talking out loud, right?” Steve asked, shifting slightly on the bed and watching Tony’s eyes grow wide and dark, mouth dipping open a bit and just staring down at him. It should make him uncomfortable, the intensity of Tony’s gaze, but he found it rather comforting, warmth and something else rushing over him as Tony looked him over.
.  It’s who we are. It’s the life—the risk we all signed up for when we pledged ourselves to whatever cause we honor.  This,” he shook his head.  “Look, I’m just—I’m trying to say that I understand why this is hard to accept, even with everything Tony keeps doing to try to make it, I don’t know, appealing or whatever is in his head.  Tony, he…he’s a great King.  And better, a good man. The best I’ve known. But, he’s not a soldier.  He plays at war on a table, going over and over it in his head, and I’m damned glad we have him doing that, but it isn’t the same as being out there, breathing in the smell of blood and death, wondering if it’s you next and why it’s not.   It’s hard to walk away from a battlefield.  Harder than he realizes.   I’ve seen far too many who can’t leave it behind, or have left too much of themselves there to ever truly leave.  But, you have a chance here, Steve.  A real chance.  Tony, he—he cares for you.  He’ll do anything to make you happy, you must see that.”
Well, if Steve was stupid enough to take that deal…apparently, he coveted SI more than an Omega he actually, well, wanted, so, fine.  Whatever.  Joke’s on him, right?  Tony got left alone and carte blanche to do whatever he wanted so long as he kept it in his garage, out of sight, out of mind.  Healthy living, as far as he was concerned.
He was fairly sure the SHIELD therapist would disagree with that assessment, but there was no way Steve was telling her that he couldn’t get this one Omega out of his head, not when she had all but stamped Anthony’s file with a giant, red 4F, Steve thought with a slight frown. She didn’t need to know.  No one did.   It was private.  For him.  Just something that helped, sometimes, to think of Anthony, to hear Anthony’s voice in his head, to see him, standing there in his pale suit with fire in his eyes.
“No one is having sex on the conference table,” Fury said, then shook his head and rubbed his temples.
“In the meantime, they left him like this and he’s….” Steve trailed off, leaning close enough to the glass so that he could see his breath fog the window in front of him.
“Huh—” Tony started, then had to clear his throat where it had tightened to the point he couldn’t quite get enough air. “Hi, you.”
Steve looked over at Brock, who was puttering around the kitchen making a cup of instant coffee.  Brock wanted a fresh start for the two of them.
“Pierce, too, though, right?  He was in on it,” Steve guessed.  Tony didn’t reply other than a curt nod, but his look was sharp now, focused and edged with something  that Steve would have called almost hopeful.  It didn’t sit easily on Stark, that much was clear.  Steve could see how quickly it pushed the other man off-balance, like he’d been hovering on some cliff just waiting to fall over it.  He was back to curling his hands into almost-fists and then snapping them together, rapid-fire bursts of energy that he couldn’t quite seem to contain.  Tony’s breathing was becoming harsher, more labored as he patted at the center of his chest, Steve noticed, before he seemed to regain some semblance of control.
“Ah, well, I know—I know I’m not really on the schedule today, but.  Well.  I thought maybe, if you could.  You could let Tony—Mr. Stark—know that I’m available.  If he wanted to see me,” Steve stuttered, realizing that he hadn’t entirely thought this out.
He brushed past the frowning salesman and hurried over the desk in front of the register.  Two salespeople were carefully folding and bagging their purchases. Tony added his handful of clothes to the pile, with a quick glance over his shoulder at the salesman hanging that…thing…back up on a tall rack of similar garments next to the aisle.
“Me,” Steve said.  “I would.  I’ve never felt better than with Iron Man at my side.  But, you’ve got to let me, and the rest of the team, stand by you, too.  The world should know. You deserve that.”
“It’s complicated,” Steve replied. He looked down at the ring.  He kept looking at it.  He’d been doing that all morning.  He was fairly sure that was what got Bucky going in the first place, watching Steve mooning over his ring, but it was just…there.  Something that had never been there before. Something that he honestly never imagined being there, and suddenly, it was there, real and tangible, and this whole charade felt a hell of a lot more real than it had before.  Obviously, it wasn’t real. They weren’t really married, of course.  They weren’t going to
“Well, er…yes.  I mean, these things take a long time, and, of course, there’s a substantial investment involved, but we hope to grow the program.  In the future.  Actually, ah…I mean, soon.  Very soon. We already have plans to send another couple out for testing.  We have a waiting list a mile long.  You should see the letters we get.  Heartbreaking, I tell you.  I wish we could help them all.  Heck, I even had this one guy come all the way out here from New York or something, trying to get his buddy on the list.  Even offered to work security or scrub toilets or whatever, can you believe it?”
“He could maybe stay some.  If he wanted to,” Steve said with a shrug, like it didn’t matter, except it mattered more than anything.
“But you want to solve this with just us, and we are not going to be enough, Steve,” Tony was saying, as if plucking thoughts from Steve’s mind.  “We are going to lose if we do it that way—hell, you know that!  And maybe we will anyway, but it isn’t going to be because we didn’t try everything possible to stop it from happening, and if that means I end up fucking up over and over again, then so be it.  That’s on me, and you can’t handle that, then fine.  Walk away.  Or hole up here and do exactly the same thing we’ve been doing, but when whatever is coming comes, do not think for one fucking minute that I’m going to watch this world burn, that I’m going to—that I’m going to see you die, and think there was anything left undone that I could have tried to stop that from happening.”
