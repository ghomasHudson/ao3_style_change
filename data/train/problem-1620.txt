Without thinking about it, I raise the covers and slide in beside him. It’s something I’ve dreamed about, a dream too late to realise, but I’m not about to question the reality of this. It feels real: Sherlock’s cold hands on me, his bony knees poking into my thigh, his shallow breaths ghosting across my face.
“A pleasure to meet you, Doctor Watson,” Mycroft says smoothly. The loathing is still there, under the polite facade. “I understand that you are a graduate of the Priory School, like my brother. Perhaps what I have to say will interest you as well.”
“True. What I mean is, I never thought of it for other reasons as well. I never thought I’d meet someone like you. Or that a person like you even existed. And I made up my mind that whatever I didn’t know about you yet would be fine. Your nine daughters, and many as of yet uncounted daughters, fall into that category: things I wasn’t aware of then, but now know, which are all fine.”
I wanted.”
. When he arrived, Lestrade was already waiting, looking tanned and suave in a linen suit that set off his silver hair. Sherlock hated interviews; they made him irritable. He’d put on his usual, a slim black suit with the aubergine shirt that made his pale eyes look even more alien. He had forgotten to check his hair before leaving his flat. “Fuck,” he said, slumping into a chair for the stylist.
“Not at first, but after we started rehearsing, I became suspicious and did some research. He’s got a history of this sort of thing.”
. “You have to—“
, or maybe an
They’re still holding onto each other, and John leans in, lays his head against Sherlock’s chest. “But I’m not confused. Or concussed, or delirious. I just finally realised.”
“Of course. The study of any science requires the ability to imagine, to hold multiple scenarios in the mind and compare them.”
He shakes his head, exasperated. It’s a stupid argument. He doesn’t want to talk about it. “I’m not trying to do anything.”
I hadn’t made a mark on Charles, who was standing over me, his foot on my chest. He gave an angry kick into my ribs.
“Oh, yes,” he sighed. “I want… I want…”
“Nonsense. Invalid? Bah! You still have all your limbs. Now climb up there and do as I say.”
Maybe they should talk about this, he thinks. But it’s not familiar ground, having conversations about sex, even in bed. They aren’t talkers.
“Everyone.” Carmichael points at Huxtable. “Even he knew. Was he worried? Not until parents started complaining. We all accepted it because it was the same for us. We rose above, learned to be men. Nobody told us it should be any different.”
John pulls his phone out and begins to text, looking at his daughter. “I’m texting your mom. Do you have anything to say to Sherlock before I take you home?”
He tries to imagine how this— John’s divorce, his daughter, his wife who writes novels about their marriage— will affect their relationship. It would be so much easier if— no, it’s selfish to wish those things didn’t exist. Everyone brings baggage to a relationship. God knows, Sherlock has plenty of that. He will learn how to incorporate John’s family into their relationship. He can be supportive.
Feeling at loose ends, he hailed a cab and gave the driver his address. Home wasn’t where he wanted to be, but he hadn’t any better ideas. Greg and Mike had both taken off after the rehearsal, each of them with plans for the evening. Though Sherlock rarely accepted social invitations, he almost wished he had somewhere else to go.
“Okay, you’ve called her friends?”
Mycroft looks at me, a surprised almost-sneer on his lips. Perhaps he’s curious: what threat can John Watson make that will move him?
Sherlock knows all about the frontal lobe, centre of decision making, planning, and impulse control. He knows that an injury to the front of the head can change a personality.
Ella knows he’s angry. He doesn’t like talking about it. He knows she just wants him to let it out, examine why he’s so filled with rage and despair, but he just can’t. To do that, he’d have to talk about the mother who abandoned him, the father who didn’t care, and the sister who channeled her own anger into alcohol.
I imagined running into him some twenty years hence. I would be prematurely grey, bent over before my time, out of work and living off my brother’s largesse.
John sees a counsellor and arranges time with his daughter. Sherlock broods and jumps to conclusions.
I tried to make my voice light. “If you recall, I did promise you a holiday some time ago, as a result of a small wager we had at Stamford’s wedding. I conceded, as you know, and if you will forgive the delay, we might spend some time abroad, as I promised you.”
“I love you, Alex.”
It went on and on, the two of them borrowing every romantic trope that had ever existed, trying to outdo each other.
She gazed at him for a long moment, then nodded. “Molly, Mike, and the others are your friends. Don’t forget that. Now, what did you want to ask me?”
“A love affair, Watson. She is a spinster, a woman of great size but no great charms, who has fallen in love with a man interested only in her fortune, though that is the smallest thing about her. So, a small-scale bigamist, perhaps, looking for a gullible, insecure woman. She has doubts, but wants me to tell her this man is her true love, and will hear nothing against him.”
The whispers ceased; a hush fell on the room. John heard his blood thundering in his ears, felt every eye on him.
“Shut up!” He raises his eyes and glares at Holmes. “Why are you invading my privacy?”
“You could call her and tell her.”
“At what cost to my reputation?”
1894 April
Something moved among the trees, something hanging… swaying…
“You’re a good actor. I’ve seen all your movies—“
We climbed further, stopping at a place where the path went behind the waterfall and we had a view of the valley below. The veil of water rushing past us was awe-inspiring. For several minutes we simply stood there. A painter might have reproduced the vista, but not even a great artist could capture the grandeur, the terror of such a place.
“Alas,
“Well, you could invite him along to a crime scene.” Her grin tells him this is a joke.
Sherlock plastered on his best sociopath smile while the stylist fussed with his curls. “I’m so happy to see you, Greg. Sooo happy to be here today.” The smile vanished and he turned to the stylist, frowning. “Go away.”
For Mike’s benefit, they act out a little drama, plan to meet the following day, but when he returns to Baker Street, Watson is already sitting in his chair, waiting for him.
“Let’s go home,” John says. He hasn’t let go.
When he hears John’s key in the lock, he realises there’s nothing for dinner. He’ll just say he forgot, since he’s not at all hungry. He opens John’s laptop and pretends to be absorbed in something.
Watson sulked, clattered about in the kitchen, cleaning up the remains of my last experiment. Listening to his noisy discontent, I finally could stand it no more. “Come, Watson. Time for a ramble.”
has been spray-painted somewhere near each victim’s body.” He cocks his head, a slight smile curving his lips. “As it happens, he’d already painted it on the wall in the alley where he planned to kill you. That’s how we know you were going to be his next victim. Interesting, that. Why would he leave his sign when he obviously hadn’t done the deed? It tells us something. He’s confident of success, and wants to taunt us.”
“How’s the investigation going?” I don’t have to spell it out: the charges against Sherlock that led him to the roof of Barts. I’d like to see his name cleared, but rarely see anything in the news about it now. It’s almost as if it never happened. Since I know the things said about him were all lies, and expect that Mycroft is just as eager to see him exonerated, it’s surprising that nothing has been said publicly.
He stands in front of the door for a moment. Inside, a spring squeaks. Lying in bed, then. He knocks.
I explained that I’d been assaulted by masked men who beat me and ran away. With real concern, she insisted that I lie on the sofa in the drawing room until my head cleared, and offered to call me a doctor. I declined, saying that a few minutes reclining with my eyes closed would set me right. She would send someone to check on me in a half an hour, she said, and left the room.
“When you came to me and asked for money, I was reluctant because I did not trust your judgement, or his. But once you’d explained it to me, I saw that something unexpected had happened. Your reasons for asking were unselfish. Your argument that educating him would help your firm was specious; clearly he did not need a degree to do the kind of work he was doing. You admitted that you wanted it for him because it would fulfil him, and not in a way that would benefit you directly. He was already practicing medicine on you, stitching you up and treating your accidents. You wanted an education for him because it would make him happy, not because it would make him more acceptable. That is why I agreed to pay.”
“Unless you want me against the wall.”
“I guess so.” He hangs his head, remembering those feelings.
“Well, it wouldn’t be the same without you!” She beamed at him.
The entertainment ended when coffee was brought out, along with port for the men.
It’s normal to hate the way time changes everything. Most of Sherlock’s past life is best forgotten, but there are moments that make him tear up with nostalgia, just because he can never live them again. Most of them involve John.
“He was sitting right next to me. Tall, long legs. Dark hair… he looked at me… actually, he looked… sort of like you.”
“Are you talking to someone? A counsellor?”
“He took care of it.”
and his current,
“What about him?”
“Tell me about the arguments.”
He opened the book and squinted at the flyleaf. Edwin leaned in and looked as well. “Is that her name?” he asked.
“Is there a rule about such things?”
“He was supposed to bring Adam to a meeting, blindfolded, so they could torture him. He refused, so they found another boy who was willing.”
A half hour later, we slept.
, Sherlock thinks. “Almost romantic,” he says. “Did I say that out loud?” He pops a grape into his mouth.
And they don’t touch, except in cases of small medical emergencies. Checking a pulse, gauging a fever, applying a plaster.
“Did you, like, time travel to get here?” Andy asks. “How do you know these people?”
For some reason, Nature had given him a gift he hadn’t asked for.
Watson leapt to his feet and drew the gun. “Keep your hands where we can see them!”
“Well, there’s writing, too. Molly’s been working on that reunion episode for a few years.”
Christopher nods. “A lot of standing in surgery.”
and fondle his hair. He wants to hold his hand when they walk down the street. That would be good, but not if John isn’t aware that this is not normal. They’ve been living in a delusion since the accident. They’re only friends, not whatever this is. Sherlock accepts this; he won’t ask John to change, to be someone he’s not. And he won’t take advantage of John’s injury to advance his own fantasies. When you love someone, you don’t do that. Sherlock loves John, a lot.
“Hey,” he says.
“Yeah, sure. If she’s ever home.”
Lestrade chuckles. “And how long has it been since your last date?”
He sighs. “To be honest, I’m not sure I can survive the humiliation, Mrs H.”
Sherlock cut him off. “—love—“
Striding back, he chastises himself for allowing it all to get to him. Coolly, he plucks it from those long fingers, files it in his pocket, turns (without a dramatic swirl), and resumes his progress towards getting the hell away from Sherlock Holmes.
(See the end of the chapter for
. John chuckles to himself, amazed at how comfortable it all feels. He’s pleasantly tipsy, not drunk, and he thinks he could get used to this every Wednesday. Not that he expects it to lead to anything romantic. He’s pretty sure he’s not ready for that yet.
The door bangs shut. Sherlock hears a car, no doubt black and nearly silent, cruise up to the kerb. Bits of conversation float up through the windows, doors open and close, and the car pulls away.
“Horrible.”
He laughed. “You guarantee it? Come, then, let’s have a wager. What will you bet?”
Sherlock was an addict, and I used to be hard on him about that. Alcohol is bad, but drugs scare me. All those hours I spent learning about the effects of various drugs on the human body made me realise that using drugs recreationally is like playing Russian roulette. I hated the idea that Sherlock was so casual about his former drug use, and always suspected that he’d go right back to using if I didn’t keep watch over him.
“I’ll send your things.”
“Do not ask,” she said, pulling the comb painfully through a tangle. “You may hate it here, but there are far worse places for children— workhouses and orphanages. Now, hush. Your aunt is asking for you to be sent to the library at once. Look smart, and hold your tongue unless you are asked a question. Do not argue or carry on in your usual fashion.”
Sherlock Holmes probably predicted that, too.
Once they’re in the flat, John avoids his eyes, puts on the kettle to make tea.
“My manager advises me to wait,” he finally admitted. “And for once, I agree with him.”
, and when you mock my script, you’re mocking my life.”
This is all on Sherlock. They’ll wonder what he did wrong, how he managed to drive away a man who tolerated him at his worst. Molly, who knows them both, will assure him that she’ll go to John, talk him round. She’ll want them to reconcile. It will be more awkward than that first date.
None of those things seem right.
And it came to him. Mary was balm for his wounds. She brought him back from the edge. He is grateful to her. But gratitude isn’t love. Being in such pain for so long, and then a bit of light— that isn’t love, it’s relief. He’s seen patients in physical pain almost become high when given a dose of something that takes their agony away, not even enough to make them high. Relief feels like intoxication when pain has gone on so long.
They return to the station. Holmes points out a small restaurant across the street.
“Love you, Sherlock.”
People use first names now, so he says, “Mike, can I borrow your phone?”
He sighs. “I feel like we don’t know one another anymore, Rosie. I went away and missed so much. I don’t know who you want to be, what you want to do with your life, and I wish I did. I hope you find something you want as much as I wanted to follow my dreams.”
“Baker Street.” I had a terrible thought then. “If you want to, that is. Have you made other… arrangements?”
“I’ll take your word for it.”
He nods. “Just came from Baker Street. Gave him a few cold case files to tide him over until I get a case that’s not boring.” He raises his eyebrows. “John was there. I guess he was pretty upset with Sherlock.”
“Let’s talk about that for a moment. Sherlock Holmes, the actor.”
“Do you feel ready?”
When John shoots the cabbie, Sherlock realises that there is another kind of love. Or maybe it’s what he’s been looking for all along, the thing he had almost decided was a fairy tale. He loves John Watson— selflessly, with his whole brain (never mind his body).
She sat and looked at him.
His mirror image winces back at him. Time to go. He’ll soldier through, make polite goodbyes afterwards, and return to his flat. Alone.
“Mary,” he says.
Mrs Hudson enters the room, carrying a small stepladder. “I found it! Now, if you’ll just hand me that end, I’ll fasten it—“
Like that, only more surreal. The scenes were filmed with real actors, and then drawn over digitally to make it more dreamlike. Even the sets were largely animation. When Magnussen abandoned the project, all of the original film disappeared, probably destroyed. The rotoscoped version might still exist; I’m sure Magnussen has it in a safe somewhere. The thing is, before the production had completely closed down, somebody pirated a copy of the rotoscoped version. You can still find it on the internet, if you know where to look.”
“The String Quartet No. 1. And
“You said you don’t have friends,” he begins. “You surrounded yourself with enemies. Didn’t you ever wish, though—“
“Put him in the Red Room,” my cousin Emma suggested.
“Revision, fine,” Sherlock said, his suppressed irritation finally rising to the surface, shattering any pretence of civility. “But most of these problems could have been avoided if only the writer had collaborated with her fellow actors, trusting us to help! I see no point in going any further, not until some significant revisions are made.”
“Mike,” he said. “I’m not going to have a breakdown. I’m not going to slip back into bad habits and need another rehab adventure. I’m going to do my part, hope that my costars appreciate my effort, and that my agent will get me some not-boring scripts to read. That’s all.”
At some point, he began reading books about knights. He liked the stories with dragons and people who needed rescuing, and this was when he became aware that there was another love.
John is grinning back, despite his intention to appear annoyed.
, and he hadn’t yet figured out what it was.
“You’re not,” he replied.
“You let him— he might have—“
Sherlock shrugs. “Obviously.”
too much had already come between us for him to ever want me back.
“Only when necessary, to achieve some result in the present. There is no point in digging up John Watson’s grave.”
Maybe he shouldn’t wait. If he calls him now, he can make sure Sherlock’s ready to talk about it.
I glanced at Watson, who had turned pale. “Mother, though I have never given it much thought before, I am amenable to your suggestion. However, I am only twenty-five. Do you not think it reasonable to wait a few years? Watson and I have—“
Smiling, he pulled it out of his pocket and put it on. “Fancy a bit of burglary, my dear?”
“She has no issue with your choice of partner,” Mycroft continued, pouring boiling water into each of the mugs. “But she will not hear of you being married at a Register Office. It’s common, which embarrasses her. You and John must have a proper wedding.”
Footsteps in the corridor meant that discovery was imminent. Grabbing Watson’s arm, I propelled him towards the door and out into the garden.
“I am an officer of the law,” he replied.
He laughs. Then he kisses me. That never happened, but imagining it helps me sleep.
he reminded himself.
I put on evening dress and studied myself in the mirror.
“Saying it doesn’t make it so,” replies Holmes. “If it could, I would be rid of mine by now. Annoying git.”
“Good. That’s… good.”
“We should eat something,” Watson notes.
“Professor Bellamy.”
He’s a bit envious, as always, of people who are completely comfortable making a fool of themselves. John often makes a fool of himself, but he’s never been that easy-going about it. Somehow it seems that if you’re making a fool of yourself and you’re obviously enjoying it, you’re not a fool, not really.
No sleep, then. John smiles. “You always do.”
“But what good will it do for us to leave the city?” Watson cried. “We cannot simply run away from him!”
Many of my clients are foolish, especially those young ladies who have been indiscreet, record those indiscretions in writing, and live to regret putting a postage stamp on said indiscretions and mailing them to another person.
“Oh, yes,” said Philip, clearly unenthused. “It might improve efficiency as much as twenty percent, and produces as good a product as the machines we’re using now.”
“Well, there are some advantages to having a doctor on the premises, I suppose. If you wish, I can have the flat searched while you’re out some day, just in case you’ve any forgotten stashes.”
“I’ll do it.”
“Nonsense. I’m enjoying the walk and have no wish to sit around with invalids. Go, Watson. You worry too much about me. It is not the Professor’s modus operandi to follow his enemies into the wilderness and assault them. We will see him again, but not today. Go, take care of this woman, and we will see one another tonight.”
Instead of leaving, she sits in the chair opposite him. “How was your date, love?”
Watson sighed. “When I was in his class, I struggled a bit, as you know. Chemistry is hard enough, and my mind doesn’t absorb things as quickly as yours. Professor Bellamy offered to tutor me privately. While there isn’t anything wrong with that, I’ve been propositioned enough that I was sure that’s what he was doing. I turned him down, mentioned that you were tutoring me.”
“Welcome home, Sherlock,” I whisper as I hear his breathing even out and become deeper.
“Civil partnerships are legal,” he pointed out.
“Sherlock!” Molly grabbed his arm. “You didn’t even like John!”
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, willing back the tears that were threatening. He’d already cried once this week, more than enough. “Do you ever… wonder if…” He sighed and shook his head.
A face rose up in my mind, round, red-cheeked, smiling. “He’s found a wife? How did that happen?”
“Right. She called it
“I understand. I may have done some things myself… self-destructive things.”
“That—” I stifled the urge to use profanity followed by a vulgar insult. “The lady declined.”
so often. The social ladder was steep.”
John kisses him again.
Now there’s something flashing.
“What about the counselling? If she sees that we’re trying, maybe it will help.”
“Yes, I would.”
The look I gave him must have startled him, for he began to stammer a bit.
Moriarty’s face filed with sudden rage. “Watch me,” he growled.
He grinned and rose up on his toes to kiss me. “Ten years,” he said, slipping his arms around me. “We’ve done well, haven’t we?”
doing here?” Hands on hips, she glared at Sherlock.
His smile is immediate, relieved. “Good.”
In many ways, Watson sees the Priory School as a rougher neighbourhood than the one where he grew up. Privileged boys vying for power, encouraged to be ruthless; adults looking the other way, accepting it as part of adolescence. Outside of the playing field, the rules are unclear. How far can one go to gain that power?
I returned to an empty house.
It might be 1895.
John smirked. “I think you mean,
The talk moves on to other things, and John eventually checks his phone, sees that Sherlock hasn’t replied, and makes his excuses.
care about John, more than he ever expected to care about anyone.
“My dear boy—”
But John seems like a steady person. He has regular habits and urges regularity on Sherlock, reminding him to eat and sleep and dragging him out of the flat when he can’t move from the sofa. When they met, Sherlock perceived that he was suffering from depression, probably the result of his injuries and his divorce. Because he doesn’t talk about either of those things, it’s hard for Sherlock to know what his recent mood is about.
It’s embarrassing to be past the age of thirty and just realising you’re not as nice a person as you’ve always thought you were. It’s a lot. He should think about it all— his shortcomings, the rage he feels, the bottles that are accumulating in his flat, the gun in his drawer.
“I have never taken another life.”
We did not talk about his daughter. I knew it would not be the last we heard from her, but I wasn’t worried.
“She is a singularly lovely woman, is she not? And intelligent as well. Our royal client was right; she would have made an excellent queen.”
I am a selfish man. I write this letter because I do not want you to think badly of me. I cannot demand your attention, but I ask for it nonetheless. There are things I should have said long ago.
“Ridiculous.” I stopped. We had reached a level place in the path where I could catch my breath again. Composing myself, I looked out over the valley.
“I did.”
Sherlock leans in, inhaling as if he can simply breathe John into his lungs, pressing against him as if he can absorb him through his skin. “I have another idea.”
I was walking towards the trees, of course, to the spot where I had seen John’s bones all those years ago. I hadn’t seen him since I almost died of scarlet fever at Milford. That time he had appeared more clearly, and spoke more words than ever before, likely because I had begun to cross over into his world. Ghosts who remain after death are strongly bound to places from their earthly lives; they cannot wander far from their bones. If I were to see John again, it would be here, near the house where he had died, where his bones remained under the trees.
“Not yet. But I think he will. We’ve been going out for three months.”
I follow Mycroft out. He tells me I can ride with him in a car following the hearse. That’s all he says to me. He knows there’s nothing else to say now.
“Harry?”
“A toast!” Molly raised her glass to him. “To Alex Tribble!”
He returns to the sitting room and plops down in his chair, drinking his tea, now cold.
“His daughter is fine. She is home with her mother now.”
He has work today, and fixes breakfast for himself. He just makes toast because he’s not sure if Sherlock is going to get up and wonder why John didn’t make him some eggs, too. He munches his toast silently, sipping his tea.
Yes, he is.
“John.”
It’s a nice hotel, an excellent restaurant, I’ve heard. I’m not sure if anything I have to wear is nice enough, but just as I’m beginning to fret about the state of my trousers, all of them being too loose, and the lack of any dress shoes, Mrs Hudson calls up the stairs.
“Sociopath. Huh.” He feels another giggle rising up from somewhere. Or maybe he’s going to be sick.
In an oddly familiar gesture, she folded her arms and tilted her head to the side. Then she licked her lips and sniffed defiantly. “He’s my dad.”
Irene and Molly could work on revising the script. Finding himself without commitments, Sherlock thought he’d use the time to follow up on some of his leads in the disappearance of John Watson. That was how he was thinking of it now, as a disappearance. A question mark, an unsolved mystery. Maybe John really was dead, and he would have to deal with that all over again, but the tiny bit of evidence that had taken root in his mind wouldn’t permit him to let go.
“You’re afraid he doubts your commitment. If you haven’t talked about it, though, you don’t really know what he’s feeling, and you could be mistaken. Again, communication is the key. Why don’t you tell me how you met?”
I encountered several ostlers in a lane which ran beside the house. Seeing me stumbling, they ran to help me. In a very few minutes they’d brought me to the house, where the bruise on my face gained me entrance.
He feels hands grab him from behind, turn him around gently so he’s facing the next batch of stairs.
Pulling back suddenly, Sherlock frowns at him. “You’re delirious. You don’t know what you’re doing.”
“How long have you known?”
The Baker Street building was a renovated Victorian terrace in a neighbourhood that had become more upscale over the last ten years, while still retaining the charm of an old neighbourhood. Lawyers and government employees populated the flats, and there was a nice assortment of shops nearby. Mycroft had helped him afford it initially, and later, when his income rose, encouraged him to move to a more prestigious area. He was content to remain, though. It was comfortable, not posh, a bit bohemian, and the location gave him some anonymity. Neighbours and shopkeepers recognised him, but nobody seemed overly impressed that Sherlock Holmes was living at 221B.
“Really?” He remembers Clara— a pretty, dark-haired woman Harry’s been with for a couple of years. He wouldn’t have guessed. Well, stereotypes are just things people make up so they don’t have to think about the nuances of human sexuality. People like labels; they save time and narrow down your choices.
“Plenty of things happen in this business. People see things and talk. Without pictures, though, none of it matters. Just rumours. There were plenty of those after the news came out.”
With some people, it’s a casual endearment. Mrs Hudson calls everyone
he had learned that this was no joke. The police drama filmed just eight episodes a year, each filling a two-hour time slot. While this ought to have given him lots of time off to do other things, he soon realised just how many hours a script took to film. Most of that time was spent waiting.
“I read it.” He shrugged. “Let’s just say, it didn’t surpass my expectations.”
“It’s… lovely.”
“I do think. And why not? We know John isn’t particularly imaginative. Why not reach for a name he’s already familiar with? He was used to answering to it, which eliminates the problem of not recognising when people are addressing you.”
“I see. So you consider me his latest conquest, and expect him to cast me aside, onto the pile of rejected boyfriends. I suppose he’s brought all his boyfriends to crime scenes and you’ve observed this pattern.”
In the morning, there is still tension. They prepare breakfast together, John making the tea and Sherlock toasting the bread, but this morning there are no little touches, no sleepy kisses. Sherlock spent his night on the sofa, and slept badly for the hour or so he drifted off.
“Kill me,” he said. “Let me see the other side.” If this holy man knew so much about Death and Life, perhaps he could show Holmes the way between them.
I suppose that explains my initial attraction to him. He had grown into a handsome man, with the kind of face women trusted. Women always flirted with Watson. I was used to it.
For a long time they lie there, neither of them asleep. When he hears John beginning to breathe deeply, Sherlock gets out of bed. He goes to the other room and sits in his chair, thinking.
I found him hovering over a spot on the edge of the woods, covered by grass. I had played here many times. Now I felt, rather than saw, what lay under the grass.
“You’re on the continuum, with everyone else. Maybe you’ll find a comfortable spot along it, but it won’t be through deliberate choice. As for your new relationship, I sense that this is a person you feel some commitment to.”
“Yes, indeed,” said Mr Allen. “And in your line of work, many practical applications. Just imagine how improved photographic methods might capture details of a crime scene— position of the body, murder weapon—”
life does he want now?
“Nothing. You don’t tell Sherlock things; he deduces them.”
No, this was John, solid and strong, holding him, kissing him. His lumpy old jumper under Sherlock’s hands, his warm body pressing against him, smelling of cheap shampoo. John Watson, whom he had silently loved for years, was kissing him.
“Wasn’t it? I thought… you’re… erm…”
“No, you weren’t.”
They are lucky that forensic science was still in a primitive state. The ability to match a bullet to a particular gun depended on the improvement of magnification, and did not come into forensic use until the early 20th century. The use of fingerprints in criminal investigations was beginning at this time, but it wasn’t until 1901 that Scotland Yard established its first Fingerprint Bureau. Henry Faulds, a Scottish surgeon, had published a paper on it in 1880, but when he tried to sell Scotland Yard on the idea, he was rejected.
Did you have a room for yourself? I wonder if that’s where you are now. Maybe you’ll get lonely in there, without me. Not that I’m stimulating company, but you seemed to like having me around. Well, sometimes you didn’t notice when I was gone, so I guess you could just talk to Mind Palace John. I bet he never yells at you. Never calls you a
“It’s a crime,” he pointed out.
“Irene, let me be honest with you. There was nothing between John and me. We worked together. Why does this interest you?”
He opened his laptop. “Hm. Looks like you won the internet last night. And Twitter, and Facebook as well. You’re the Most Googled Person.”
The train goes under a small overpass. I see shadows flit across your face for a moment and then we’re back to the overcast sky, the endless landscape. Your face is likewise shifting, emotions passing over your features. You’re staring out the window, composing yourself. Finally you sigh. “John.”
, they call it. A deep, dreamless sleep. The body heals, and the sleeper wakes.
He nods. “I’m fine.”
Back upstairs, I find Sherlock asleep. He doesn’t lie sprawled out across the bed, as he used to. Not that I’ve ever slept with him, but flatmates learn these things about one another. He’s a sprawler, by nature.
Mycroft smiles, a genuine smile that means he’s really pleased. “Good.”
.” I watched him hang my jacket and shirt, fold the tie and tuck it into the pocket. “Is there anything else,
“He’s hurt that you didn’t tell him, and he thinks that you trusted others more than you trusted him. He’s angry and confused because just when he thought he might move on, there you were. He probably thinks you’ve been off on holiday.”
Before anyone spoke, Irene said, “You’re right. Let’s see what we can cut out.”
He laughed. “Don’t be afraid of it,” he said. “It takes practice. I think you are a boy who has the patience to learn things, if you really want to learn.”
The Yarders had gathered around, smiling and nudging one another.
“What should you have done?”
“And how am I to help her? The blackmailer cannot lose. Either he receives the money he has demanded, or he gains credibility for his threats against others by following through and ruining her.”
“You’ve become sentimental,” Mycroft says. “Don’t say I didn’t warn you. As far as I can see, he has never returned that particular sentiment.”
“Your face is tanned, as are your hands. When you tugged at your collar, I could see that your neck is pale. Above your wrists as well. So, you’ve been serving abroad, not sunbathing. Wounded in action. Only two possibilities: Iraq or Afghanistan.”
“My middle name is Mary, same as my mum, so that’s no good. She only married my dad because she got pregnant. Now they’re getting divorced— and ruining my life.”
A cab ride later, they’re at Barts, taking the elevator down to the path lab. Mike says nothing about this person they’re going to meet, smiles mysteriously about the whole thing, as if he’s playing matchmaker.
There was a cabbie named Jason Bradford driving around London. This cabbie may or may not have been the one who picked him up that night. A picture of the man was needed, and an address. He would challenge his fantasy, track down the man, see that he was a bald, paunchy, middle-aged man who was not the John Watson he knew. And he would stop thinking about him.
“Michael? How…”
My approach was rational. I had read the newspaper account of the investigation, I told him, and happened to have viewed the scene myself shortly after the murder occurred. I was struck by several things, I said, and pointed out several pieces of evidence that the police had overlooked.
“Who’s the current Prime Minister?”
“Weddings are not for the happy couple,” Mycroft continued, nodding at Rosamund Three. “They are for family and friends, an official expression of support. Your family wants a wedding, and they will have one.”
“So do I,” he says.
The summer after I left Cambridge and moved to London, I went back to Greenwood Hall, where my aunt still lived. I felt nothing for her, nor for my cousins, remembering how they had tormented me. I had not seen Aunt Kitty since I was nine, and though she looked older, she had not changed much.
David has never been convinced that the limp was psychosomatic. Pain is not well understood, he always says. He’s seen people whose MRIs say they should be in agony, but they’re walking around with minimal pain. And there are people whose scans show no damage, no underlying cause for the excruciating pain they feel. It’s a nerve thing, he’s decided. “Maybe when you fell, you knocked something back into place.” This isn’t a scientific theory, but it’s better than the theory that says John has to endanger his life at regular intervals in order to be a whole, healthy human being without disabilities.
“Queer,” Holmes pronounced. “Desperately trying to prove he’s straight. Keep an eye on him in the showers, gentlemen.”
Charles hesitates. His captive lets out a whimper as the knife presses closer. “Nothing will change. Their fathers are powerful men. The teachers let it go on. They say it builds character. This is the way it’s always been.”
Holmes shrugs. “Not quite like this. There’s more to this situation than meets the eye. It’s not just unhappy boys being picked on and harming themselves. It’s more organised, I think. But yes, in our day there were boys who made it their mission to make other boys miserable. You know that.”
“Well, you said we have an early flight to Corsica or Crete or whatever island we’re spending a week on, so let’s just—“
“I thought of moving out, but it’s home.
“No, no— it was so great— sooo great that they just decided to cut to the chase and give me a BAFTA. And an Oscar. Best piece of work I’ve ever done.” He looked around for a bottle of something.
They follow Mr Crawford upstairs. He knocks on the closed door, opens it, and ushers them inside.
Watson shrugged. “You’ve always said that women are incapable of intelligent thought.”
Who has a
“Love interest?”
He heard the applause from the previous scene. Drawing a shaky breath, he went on stage.
The visitor at the door does not speak. No introduction is necessary.
“John.” He sounds like he’s pleading, like he’s asking for everything and has nothing to give in return. “John.”
I re-read the letter over and over, obsessing over every word.
He sometimes doesn’t give Molly the credit she deserves. She’s not an idiot. Her observational skills are above average when it comes to people, both living and dead. As soon as she sees Sherlock flounce into the morgue, she frowns in concern.
“Do stop babbling, Watson. We are both single gentlemen and have no need to clarify our position with one another. Continue. You are hypothetically writing a love letter to an entirely imaginary woman.”
and when we made love. I listened to your heart and it told me.”
“Sherlock, there are many lessons I hope you have learned over these last years. One of the most important is this: all hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage. You had been through a difficult rehab; telling you about John would only have sent you into another spiral of regret and anger. I thought it best that you simply continue to believe him dead.”
Before Watson can formulate a sensible answer, one that doesn’t sound like he was willingly assaulted by a sexy man who reminded him of Sherlock Holmes, the door downstairs bangs shut. Heavy feet pound up the stairs.
“People change. I’m not trying to be anyone other than who I am. It’s just… I left home and never went back.”
“Oh.”
Sherlock sighs. “I’m not sure what my next move would have been if you hadn’t shown up here with all your stuff and started talking to the skull. I thought about having you evicted from your awful flat, but I was afraid you’d wander around the streets, pitiful and homeless. It’s a mystery how you can take down a serial killer with your skull and still not know how to manage your life. You’re an enigma.”
He sighed and took another biscuit. “Brother mine, she is not immortal.”
with him. I just want to find him. Can you help?”
“You can’t just call him?”
Backstage, everyone was hugging John, laughing and crying.
Sometimes it feels as if Sherlock is actually married to his work, and John is just the affair he’s having on the side. Or maybe John is the long-suffering spouse, and the Work is the dangerous and irresistible mistress that makes him forget about John. Like Sherlock, John craves danger, but Sherlock also craves interesting problems. And John craves Sherlock, his brilliant, mad, mercurial—
When I wake up tomorrow, I’ll start looking for a new flat. I’ll pack my things and move somewhere else, where everything won’t remind me that I lost you. That I should have told you.
“You were always my friend, Alex,” he went on. “My best friend. There’s never been anyone else. Just you. I don’t want you to leave again. Stay here, with me.” Stepping towards Sherlock, he took his hands. Small, warm hands holding his own freezing fingers, dark blue eyes staring into his.
I’d want you to forget my name. And it wouldn’t matter anyway. You can waste your last bit of mental energy thinking about it, which is what he wants you do to, but it’s much more important for you to remember anything at all that stood out to you, even in your drug-induced state of depressed awareness. Physical characteristics, vocal tics, anything he said or did that was odd.”
“Did she?” She looked up.
“Yes,” he says. “I didn’t mean to snipe. It’s just upsetting that the boy wouldn’t tell us anything.”
When she goes on to warn him that he’s taken up with a
“She is an American,” he said. “I met her when she performed at the Opera House in Prague. After that meeting, I enjoyed a relationship with her for several months. Obviously, she is not on my level. Though she would have made an admirable queen, it was necessary to end our relationship.”
“Excuse me?”
“Maybe you can explain it to me.”
We heard heavy footsteps on the stairs, laboured breathing, and then a knock. Watson opened the door. A short, stout man wearing a heavy astrakhan overcoat entered. His face was round, and might have appeared kindly but for the hard glitter of his penetrating eyes.
Sherlock is right about him: he does crave danger. In the short run, it’s the best antidote to the depression that sometimes overtakes him. There are times, though, when his new life feels more like a dream, and he worries that in the long run, the adrenaline will not be enough for either of them.
“Stop. If you sing it, I will kill you. That is a promise. I do not need an earworm tonight.”
He gave her a sharp look. Being gay wasn’t something he had tried to cover up, but there was an unwritten rule in show business that you don’t flaunt your sexual choices— if they’re gay ones. If he’d come out at thirteen or fourteen,
Mike cast a nervous eye towards Irene, who was frowning at them. “Right. I just thought you should know. There will be interviews in the coming days, and I want you to be prepared for the questions. They’ll ask how you felt about John, if you loved him, how you felt when he died. You know how they are, so be ready.”
Sherlock looks sad. He nods. “Of course.”
Holmes: No, not
The barista used a waxed paper to grab the chocolate thing and placed it on a small plate. “And a cup of…?”
“Some things we don’t choose,” he replies. “They just happen.”
On this particular day, she had set Edwin to copying the page he had just stumbled through, and it was my turn. I read all the words on the page with ease.
“Thank you for the tea, Molly.” He stands and gives her a small smile. “And for what you said. I think… I don’t know the words yet, but I know what I want to say.”
His offer having been met and raised, Watson thought about ripping Sherlock’s shirt off. That was what he felt like doing, but the smile on Sherlock’s face told him that he was about to make a really brilliant move.
“If you won’t be needing anything—“ he began.
He nodded at the ring box. “Do not think too long.”
“Oh?” Knowing this to be true, he would do well to keep his mouth shut. “A love interest, you say?”
“The money can not be obtained,” I replied. “You would do better to take two thousand than leave empty-handed.”
Watson hesitated, then began unbuttoning the trousers. He paused as my prick sprang out at him, fully erect.
One more angsty chapter after this one, and we'll be on our way to Johnlock.
“Soup sounds good,” he says.
Maybe she wrote
There’s a button or something he’s supposed to push, but nobody ever calls and he doesn’t remember what he’s supposed to do to make the buzzing stop. A button that says
Instead of setting the opening scene in the surgery where Jason and Neil worked, Irene had made it a chance encounter at the local coffee shop. Holly and Neil would do a quick catch-up of the last few years, express their concerns about Jason’s obsession. Then Martha Hudson, playing Jason’s grandmother, would make her entrance. She would appear distressed; Jason had returned from his UFO sighting trip, but didn’t seem to be himself.
He hesitates. John is no idiot. He sees things that Sherlock ignores, sheds light in the dark corners where Sherlock would rather not look. But if you love someone, you trust them. You admit your weaknesses and failures. “Okay.”
to mean what everybody assumes they are to one another. It confuses him, thinking about it. John loves the Work almost as much as Sherlock does. He looks mild, but wouldn’t hesitate to shoot a man if the situation warranted it. And most of the things Sherlock does that set other people off scarcely bother John. He can be grumpy, and often corrects Sherlock when he is behaving in ways that are
Lestrade winces too. Maybe he’s seen the autopsy photos. I have not. “I dunno. Maybe five seconds?”
“I just live around the corner,” he protests. “Pretty sure I can make it without being assaulted.”
“Did you sneak in the back door?” I ask.
More people arrive in various approximations of seventies fashion, from hippy funk to metal chic, shaved heads to big hair. Christopher is holding a contest to see who can name the tune. John wins by identifying a couple of flip-sides to singles.
“He has to leave, too,” he tells the nurse.
Watson looked up. “Do you want me to leave? If you’re afraid that I will be a liability—”
Squeezing my hand, he gave me a small frown. “You need an education if you hope to be independent of your relatives. You told me that you despise them too, even though they supported you.”
was his first role In his parents’ home. With two dysfunctional parents and a defiant sister, he became by default the one who managed. Dealing with people comes naturally to him, along with a personal radar that warns him when things are about to get ugly. When he goes to crime scenes, he observes a cycle of insult and abuse that bounces between Sherlock and Lestrade’s people, acting and reacting. They clearly resent their consulting detective, not only because he can see the things they miss, but because he isn’t polite about it. Sherlock doesn’t merely lack people skills, he sees no point in them. At the same time, it bothers him. John notices him tensing up the moment they duck under the yellow tape, and can tell that it’s not just anticipation of what they will find. It’s a shield against the unnecessarily rude remarks the Yarders throw at him. They’re like kids in a schoolyard, taunting the outsider. While Lestrade appreciates what Sherlock brings to the scene, he doesn’t do much to rein in their hostile behaviour.
It was late, but he was thinking about John. It was time to close that door, leave John to live whatever life he wanted, put him out of his mind.
saying it, to pretending that he’s married to his work, that for a moment he can’t think of what to say. “Yes, John,” he finally stammers. “But Doctor Gurung said—“
They want to see the two of you in a relationship. There are hundreds, thousands of stories on fan sites, written by fans, with Baz and Hawke having sex.” She waited for his reaction.
“Hi, Sherlock.” She was giggling. “Sorry. Don’t mind me.”
Eyes full of tears, he gave a short laugh. “I’m hardly a boy, Holmes.”
There’s a card on the floor, something that fell out of the mail when he was sorting through it. A business card. He picks it up and reads.
“She will no doubt want to stay in touch,” I said.
Watson’s amazement was worth the bruise that still throbbed on my face. “Brilliant!”
“Why?”
He considers this.
He comes back into the sitting room and takes his seat opposite John.
“Singing and dancing?”
“Of course he will. He’s afraid of someone. Why should he trust us?”
He seemed to have regained his composure and continued. “Love letters should be handwritten, should they not?”
“Is there a phone?”
“I am currently engaged to be married to the daughter of the King of Scandinavia. It is an excellent match which will resolve certain diplomatic issues between our countries. Miss Adler, however, possesses a somewhat suggestive photograph of the two of us and threatens to send it to the family of my fiancee. This family, one of the foremost in Europe, has very strict old-world principles. The photograph would bring to an end our engagement, which is to be announced three days hence. Miss Adler has promised to make the photograph public on that day.”
Lestrade shrugged. “I can’t see any other explanation.”
John never left me. He became part of my life, and I tried to make it a useful one. I spent years in London, talking to ghosts and solving crimes with Scotland Yard. The ghosts I helped, with few exceptions, moved on and ceased to haunt the living. Only John remained.
“An idea, really, and the producers love it. She suggested that the episode be broadcast as a live performance. An event, you might say.”
His leg is vibrating again. He looks.
“Why would he be disappointed? You’re a lovely person, Sherlock. You have your moments, of course, but you’re really a very kind person. And you notice things about people. I know you wouldn’t have been rude to him, seeing he was depressed. ”
pictures.” Anderson looked down again, speaking softly. “Look, if you’d rather not… I know what you’re like, though. You’ve been obsessed since Molly sprung it on us, and it’s easy to see that this is tearing you apart. What I can tell you is not comforting, but if it were me, I’d want to know.”
Dead, definitely. Rigor mortis is just beginning to wear off. His face is still frozen into a ghastly rictus, as if he’s sneering at Holmes, taunting him.
“Months?” Watson gaped. “You’ve been working on this for months and didn’t think it necessary to inform me?”
He had to admit that the evidence was not enough to support his hunch, and that confirming something he wanted to believe was the wrong way to go about things. He’d studied science at uni, and knew that looking for facts that support a hypothesis invited bias. Conclusions are drawn from facts, not the other way around. Hypotheses are formed from observations.
Sherlock’s face.
Well, it wasn’t an alien, Mike had clarified; he would be playing a genetically-engineered superhuman. For all purposes, an evil alien. Villains could be fun to play if they weren’t caricatures, so he didn’t object on those grounds. But why was it that whenever anyone had an alien part to cast, people still thought of Sherlock Holmes?
Sherlock, being the younger, is the sole focus of her displeasure now. Her friends have eligible daughters; she has an eligible son. Such arrangements require more intense negotiation than most international treaties, as well as skills that she has spent her entire life honing. Sherlock has nearly reached the ideal age for marriage, and she is ready to open deliberations with several families. Her displeasure lies in his refusal to consider marriage at all.”
“Because I failed. He wanted real sex, not just a hand job or a blow job, and I couldn’t do it.”
Lestrade shook his head. “I’m afraid that’s not possible; they’re still processing him.”
I slept, I woke. I sat in my garden, spent quiet evenings with John. Sometimes I saw him clearly, a young man, an old man, a child again. When I slept, I felt his hand on my shoulder.
“She was there when I needed someone,” he says. “I just knew.”
“Someone else was here, and they took the case.”
. For once, she didn’t look hesitant or uncertain. “We need to talk, Sherlock.”
“I’m an army doctor, trained to look at horrible injuries. And I’ve worked with the most observant man in the world for the last year and a half. I know what I saw.”
“You have become a respectable gentleman, John. I didn’t want all of that to be thrown away. How would you ever go into practice?”
She raised her chin, giving him an appraising look. “You’re Sherlock Holmes.”
A hand closes around his arm, pulling him up, guiding him forward. A laugh, close to his ear. “You’re an idiot. An inebriated one to be sure, but an idiot all the same.”
them!”
With a positive attitude, of course.
When the scarlatina came upon the school, the two sleeping areas were repurposed, one as an infirmary, the other as a dormitory for the healthy boys. When Victor became ill, he was moved to the other room. Several nights later, I woke to see him looking down at me. Dressed in his night gown, he was luminous, and I could feel the cold wafting from his body.
Mason leans into the room. “We’re ready to talk to Carmichael. Would you two like to sit in?”
“Okay,” John concedes. “But what about me? Bowie was a solo act.”
“Sperm donor,” I said.
“Did I greet Wilkes like an old friend? Did he seem glad to see me?”
“It’s late, Watson. Go to bed.”
Sherlock has no biological imperatives. He eats and sleeps when he has to, but sex doesn’t interest him as it did when he was using it to get drugs. Two things he never neglects, no matter: the Work, and John.
He’s not entirely sure he can think anything right now. His brain is still slogging to keep up with all that’s happened since he walked into the Rock Garden, nervously hoping that he might meet some new people, have a pleasant evening. Holmes was there, watching him as he limped into the bar and spotted his friends. He now
Leaving my book hidden behind the curtains, I stepped towards him. Charles was eleven, and much bigger and heavier than me. I wished that my brother Mycroft had taught me how to box, as older brothers are supposed to do, but I had not heard from him in two years, since he sent me a letter for my birthday. He was in India then. I did not know where he was now, or even if he was alive. Perhaps he did not know that our father had died. I made up stories for myself, imagining him coming to get me, bringing me to a big house where we could live together, reading books and finding skeletons.
Watson made an impatient huff. “Holmes, this makes no sense. How will you be safer alone? How will I be safe, traveling by myself? If the notes are so important, surely we can pay a courier to take them to London. There is no reason for me to go. Clearly you wish to face Moriarty alone for some reason I cannot divine. Perhaps your pride makes you think you must meet him man to man. Perhaps you wish to claim this dubious victory for yourself. I know your disposition well, and I will not leave you alone to meet him.”
I think about other things I could say. I could talk about the rain. I could say that I stepped in a puddle and my feet are wet and cold. That’s about the least disturbing thing that’s happened to me lately. Much better than seeing my best friend die. I won’t say that.
“Did I what?”
It’s time to break his safe little routine, go out and meet some people. How that will happen, he’s not sure. But he’s certain he can’t be this careful, fearful person any more. Nor can he carry this anger around, looking for a target, letting it slowly poison him.
“How can you bear listening to him?” I asked him later that evening as we sat warming our feet before the fire. “I despise him.”
“Consulting criminal. I think you’ll find he’s responsible for a number of unsolved crimes.”
“Jesus, John.” Lestrade rubs his hands over his face. “This is morbid. I really think you need to talk to someone—“
He put Brook out of his mind and focused on one thing: getting through it. He’d done live theatre before and enjoyed it, loved the reactions of the audience and the feeling that they were hanging on his words, immersed in the story so deeply that they would startle when the curtain went down and the lights came up. He loved the final bow, the company standing together, receiving the shouts and applause.
“Destination?”
“I’ve kissed lots of women,” he replies. “I don’t need to kiss a man to know I’m not gay.”
“Where am I supposed to put him?” she inquired of my uncle.
as a real person. He learned to be selective.
Dressed and ready to leave, he considers waking Sherlock to say goodbye. No, he never sleeps much, and John hates to wake him for no good reason. He leaves the flat and takes a bus to work, still thinking about their argument.
“I’ve been thinking about coming out,” he said. “Mike says no one will be surprised, so there’s that. No, I’m not angry. I hate people being all up in my private life, but that’s the price of being successful in this business. And when being with you is the reward…” He felt his face grow hot.
They’ve had two fights now, the one after running into Mary at dinner, where John introduced him as his
He tried again. This time I could catch bits of his voice, but it was not like the voice of any living creature. It sounded as if it were being conveyed from a distance, across many miles. Or years, perhaps. The sound of it made me think of a ghostly voice traveling along a wire, like a telegraph.
He’s going to do it, he’s decided. He might not feel ready for what’s on the other side, but he’s ready to make the leap.
The John Watson I knew had never brought a ring box to a fancy restaurant.
He looked neither intoxicated nor anxious nor depressed. Clearly, he had been successful. Edith Wickham was not a catch, but he had made his move. I shuddered and gave a great sigh.
Tonight he will push, he decides. John will probably be more comfortable inside Sherlock than vice versa, and that’s fine. Sherlock doesn’t have any preference, but he doesn’t have much experience, either. He doesn’t see them falling into defined roles, top and bottom. This first time it will be easier this way.
Before I can reason it out, Sherlock has disappeared into the crowd.
“She does it to see him blush,” I said, smiling.
Molly finally conceded that
“You loved a man,” John says.
One day while Mr Anders was reading us a Psalm, Victor’s slate slipped through his hands and broke on the floor. The teacher was on him at once, hauling him by his collar and standing him on a chair as I had once stood. He chastised him in front of all the boys for being careless and wasteful.
"If you'll be needing two bedrooms, I'm afraid there's just the one." Mrs Hudson looked at them expectantly. "What do you think, then, Doctor Watson?"
“Don’t leave,” he says. “I don’t want you to leave again.”
“What do you think happened?”
Lestrade hurries back down the stairs; the door slams behind him. Sherlock grabs his coat and scarf and heads down, hollering to Mrs Hudson that he’ll be home late and might need some food.
I prepared another piece for him, adding a dollop of the honey. “Have another.”
Ignoring the hand, Sherlock turned to Molly. “How is the final scene going to work in a live performance? Do you have another doppelgänger hiding in the wings?”
“Could you…?” I ran my fingers over the scrolling. It was a beautiful thing, this violin. I could see the marks of his hands on the wood. It must have taken him many hours
Only one person lived here, and he was not a slob. His diet consisted mostly of takeaway, but the fridge contained eggs and milk, and there was a half loaf of bread on the worktop, so he might make his own breakfast. He drank Yorkshire Red, probably because he thought the Gold wasn’t superior by a wide enough margin to justify the cost. He wasn’t a snob, this flat-dweller. He counted his pennies.
This wasn’t what he expected. “I’m sorry. I know I behaved badly today… it was harder than I expected.”
“Well, I suppose it’s enough to hear that you’re sorry. The question is, which of your overbearing, insensitive actions do you regret?”
It’s Sherlock. He’s dyed his hair auburn and cut it short. He’s not wearing the Belstaff, but is dressed in jeans and a parka, the kind of thing normal people wear when they travel. Sherlock never wears jeans, never dresses like a normal person. On him it looks odd, like a disguise.
“Very funny, Molly.”
He nodded. “Thank you, Molly.”
“Molly hasn’t grown up,” Sherlock replied. The beer had loosened his tongue, but he couldn’t quite let go of the
or something. That’s what he needs. A button that says
It’s after midnight, and the nightly horror show has been going on for hours. It happens every night when I close my eyes and try to sleep. You on the roof, talking to me, casting your phone aside and tipping off the edge, falling…
“Hey, did you get Molly’s invite?”
I pad down the stairs, into the sitting room. It’s been tidied up here; I couldn’t think of any more excuses for Mrs Hudson. She’s grieving too, and the way she copes is by cleaning. I put her off for days, but finally I let her pack up the chemistry equipment and pick up the scattered dressing gowns and files and random clutter. She put them all in the bedroom and closed the door. It’s made her feel better. Sometimes I can hear her humming in her kitchen downstairs.
He can’t say that John doesn’t love him, because there is evidence that is true. But there will never be a vow to stay. It’s exhausting, just thinking about the effort that will be required. He can do everything right, and John, who has always dated women, who still finds women attractive, will one day wake up and realise that’s what he wants. Maybe Mary won’t ever take him back, but by then he will have met a woman who is everything Mary was not. Everything Sherlock is not.
Amnesia can strike at any time.
He’s not sure he wants to know the details, but he can’t help himself. “How?”
I fiddled with the panel until it slid open. As I expected, it was empty.
Lestrade is looking at his phone, paying no attention to Anderson and Donovan. Though they’re talking quietly, he can hear them making observations and generally being mean. John is standing somewhere behind Sherlock. Maybe he’s tired and wants to go home, but it was his idea to come, so he won’t say anything.
“Mrs Cecil Forrester gave me your name,” she said, straightforward. “She is my employer. I believe you solved a small domestic mystery for her.”
John wakes up with a headache and gut pain. He hasn’t anything but paracetamol in the flat, so he takes that. For most of the day he lies on his bed and tries not to think about last night. He doesn’t check his bank balance or call his sister. More bad news is the last thing he needs.
as he’s been calling it in his mind, he phones Harry. She might have read the papers, but his name was not revealed in the article. Holmes refused to allow the police to release it, and he must have some kind of pull with the Yard.
“Indeed.” He pulled John closer. “Whatever you decide, I’ll support you. Whatever it means.”
I yawned. “Sufficient time to manage. As to money…?”
It’s curious. He hears the gun fire and sees Watson fall. It’s a gut wound, he can tell, which means he will bleed out quickly and go into stasis.
As he watched the two of them, tears gathered in his eyes. Embarrassing, to be nostalgic about something he had been so eager to leave behind. He’d never had a friend before, and didn’t know how to act. When he realised with horror that he had a
“I doubt that. You’re drunk, though not nearly as disgusting as the last time I walked you home, and you’re wearing tight jeans and a leather vest that says,
“I don’t,” said Lestrade. “I absolutely support fans’ right to creatively interpret our characters and invent… things. But it helps me keep my focus if I don’t read other interpretations.”
“Stop calling me Mister. It makes me feel old. What the hell do you want, then?”
“You look fine,” says Lestrade. “Just great.”
Harry is learning from her mistakes. John has never understood what his mistakes are, even in chemistry. But she is right, he can change, if he could just figure out how to do that.
Sherlock says nothing. He’s barely been off the sofa all day, and doesn’t budge over to make room for John.
When he was sixteen, he wanted to be a doctor, an improbable achievement for someone of his background. He had no idea how hard it would be, no idea that he’d almost die, that he’d find himself back in London, struggling to start over. At sixteen, he was sure that he could do whatever it would take to succeed.
fans, to see you two together in this.”
Turning, he viewed his attacker. It was hard to tell much because the man was standing in the shadows, shining a torch in Sherlock’s eyes. Squinting into the light, he could see the shape of a cricket bat and congratulated himself for being right about that, at least.
“Sherlock, listen to me. Even if he’s in counselling with his wife, it doesn’t mean he’s leaving you. He’s going through a divorce; that means he has things to work out with Mary. He has a daughter who’s going through a lot. And he has a relationship with you— he’s never been in a relationship with a man before, and maybe he’s trying to figure that out.”
He doesn’t know whether to feel flattered or embarrassed. He’s mentioned that he has a flatmate, but never referred to Sherlock as his
“Your ambitions are within your grasp. You no longer need me.”
“I’ve participated in a number of… activities,” he replies. “But not that. And not with anyone I cared about.”
John’s smile is radiant, sincere, but there’s still something he’s hiding. Sherlock does miss the intimacy, though. He misses John’s arms, his smile, and the way he looks at Sherlock. And he wants this so much.
“That’s my cue!” Brook giggled. “Oh! My line—“
“It would,” Sherlock agreed. “A sure way to end the run of a popular series is to resolve sexual attention. Either that, or a pregnancy.”
“The boy has refused to tell, and his father was reluctant to force him into counselling. Instead, he has brought the matter to me, hoping I could advise him. Naturally, I thought my brother would be eager to assist in such a matter, especially when it involves his
“Sherlock,” Mrs Hudson chides. “It’s Christmas. No more talk of serial killers. And John’s jumper is very festive.”
“I want to know about Rich Brook. He tried to drug me— did you expect that?”
He looks at Sherlock, lost in some reverie about bees.
“I wouldn’t have understood you then,” John says. “I’m not even sure I completely understand you now. Doesn’t matter, though. I’m not sure what Mycroft was trying to say in his toast, which was actually pretty weird, but maybe we wouldn’t have fallen in love if we’d been friends in school. We would have drifted apart. I would have gone into the army, and you—“
“I can’t find Jason.”
“You like my dad, don’t you? Otherwise, you wouldn’t live with him.”
He nodded. I stood and went to him, pulling him up from his chair and into my arms. “I will enlighten you,” I said quietly. “If you will allow me.”
She nodded. “I think his mother pushed him too much. A lot of people in the business pushed him, once they saw that he could make them money. They would have taken everything from him and dropped him as soon as he was too old to play those roles. I bet he hated all those stupid teen movies.”
John looks down at his phone. Four messages.
“What the fuck are
“I refuse.” Sherlock began putting his coat on. “Nice seeing you all.”
He hummed in reply. He was wondering if John would watch tonight. If he did, he wondered how John would feel about it, seeing them all reprising their roles and dedicating the whole thing to his memory. Would he feel guilty? Would he regret that he was in hiding, wish that he were on stage them? Maybe he missed those days when his best friend was an alien. Or maybe he was glad to put it behind him.
“There is this,” she said, taking a folded paper off the mantel. “It’s addressed to you, though I hardly know why he would write to a dead man.”
He is silent.
“But you didn’t—“
“Okay, that doesn’t sound so bad. My… my boyfriend is very important to me. I want our relationship to be strong.”
. People like Watson can only find the perfect words once they’ve left the room and find themselves at the bottom of the stairs.
“But not the butler, I hope.”
Holmes follows him inside and up to his flat. John thinks about getting ahead and shutting the door in his face, but he is still a bit pissed and isn’t sure he can outstep the git.
“Sarah, I like you very much,” he begins.
Sometimes we get an email or a text from another Rosamund. The girls have established quite a network, trying to reach other daughters of John Watson. John has daughters in Ohio, California, and Canada. We even got an email from one in Australia. The youngest is ten, which tells me that in the year 1999, the sperm bank ran out of John Watson’s sperm.
I played with my teabag, dunking it up and down. “I don’t care. I love John and he’s agreed that to marry me. If she’s unhappy that I’ve chosen a man, she will have to live with it.”
Holmes gives him a scornful look. “You said you would show me something interesting.”
Holmes frowns. “You’ll stay in tonight?”
On the platform he turned back as the doors closed and saw her face, smiling, her hand raised in the alien salute, her mouth shaping the words
His lips moved then, but no sound came from his mouth.
Seeing what I was doing, Watson came beside me pulled on my shoulder. “There’s no time. We must go!”
Morstan smirked a bit. “Maybe they’re more open than you think. It’s an edgy series, always confronting the news of the day. You’ve had episodes about mental illness, sexual abuse, human trafficking, transgender issues. And your characters’ private lives have always been part of the drama. It wouldn’t be out of character to go in this direction.”
“It doesn’t matter now.”
was an acceptable substitute. Sally suggested
“Nothing. I was just thinking about you, and we haven’t talked in a while…”
Unfortunately, the sofa was already occupied. Ariel was back, and she’d brought a friend with her. Teenaged girls always travel in packs, I remembered.
The darkness you must have felt as you contemplated dying is something I have felt myself. At first I was angry that you would do this, but now I am only sorry that you could find no other way out of the dark. I hope that my continued love and regard for you can lift you in some way, even though you cannot requite it. Whatever you have experienced, you do not deserve to be taken advantage of or hurt by anyone. You are worthy of love and respect. I am sorry if I contributed to your darkness, and I hope that life will treat you better from now on.
“You thought I’d leave you because that’s happened to you before. Someone left you, someone you loved.”
“Sherlock.” John is wearing pyjamas; he tugs his robe closed and ties the sash.
that can’t see what he sees.
“Really, Sherlock. A
“Would you have been angry?” he asks suddenly.
They were alone.
But that’s not who he is.
His voice is almost a whisper as he looks down and replies, “Very good.” It’s as if he’s ashamed to boast. Ashamed of the man he’s become. Afraid that no one will ever believe who he used to be.
Mycroft was no doubt hoping he’d be discouraged by the amount of work and humility needed to succeed, and Sherlock had gone only to prove his tenacity, not with any serious thought that he’d get the part.
“Yes.” Sherlock smiles sadly. “I was here yesterday. Last night I landed in Bucharest. The hotel is dismal and I miss Baker Street so much. I miss you. I’m lying on a dirty mattress, trying to sleep, thinking about how to begin this mission, and I wish you were with me. I wish I’d told you before I left. So I’m imagining that I did tell you.”
“That’s creepy, you know. That smile. So, you went to see Molly?”
and slips out of sight.
“I will.” Ending the call, he stood and filled the kettle, set it to boil. “Magnussen has been arrested. Mycroft told me.”
That sorted, John sighs involuntarily. He feels a bit light-headed. “So, how did you know I was a doctor?”
Eyeing her cautiously, he takes a sip of the tea. “How do you mean?”
Sherlock holds him at arm’s length, studying him. “You’re doing that thing. The thing I always do to you, where I confuse you into agreeing with me.”
Sherlock is having a strop because visiting hours are over and he’s not allowed to stay. Watson can hear him yelling.
“Whatever is quickest,” he replied. “It’s quite a handicap for me, not being able to…”
“If not today, when?”
“You looked very nice when you left last night. All dressed up.” She shrugs. “Of course, you always look nice. But you were nervous. That’s not usual for you. So tell me, what is he like?”
“Sherlock, he doesn’t hate you. And that’s not why we love people, to get something from them.”
Consider me, six years old, huddling behind the heavy velvet curtains, hoping to avoid the notice of my cousins Emma, Charles, and Edwin. There am I, pitiful boy, dark curls that refused taming, pale eyes that unsettled anyone who met my gaze. A wan child, skinny and forlorn, lacking the appropriate disposition for one assigned the contemptible station of impoverished relative. I had not the disposition to be likeable, and so I made myself withdraw from my cousins as much as possible.
and another four, going on five, of
“One night a man came to me for confession, and his voice told me that he was a murderer. It had been a long time since he had killed, but now he was dying and wished to confess what he had done.
“That’s… good.”
“Why are we here?” he asked.
Sherlock sat up. “Of course! I’m an idiot.”
“John, there is no membership badge to earn here. You are what you are because that’s how you define yourself. There is a spectrum that reaches all the way from heterosexual desire and sex, to being completely homosexual in these things. Even bi-sexual isn’t easy to define. And there are many variations, people who are asexual but have romantic feelings—“
He can say things like this to Molly, and she understands. Perhaps she’s more forgiving of him because they are friends now. She used to look at him with sad eyes, and Mike Stamford had finally explained that she was
Setting the photo aside, he finds his old chemistry book. He’d taken the class because he expected to go to medical school, and had almost failed, he recalled. It was his second year at Priory; up till then he’d found his classes challenging, but not daunting. His marks weren’t stellar, but good enough. Biology was his best subject; Chemistry nearly killed him. None of his mates were taking the course, so he had to struggle along on his own. Seeing the book gives his stomach a lurch, remembering exam days. He passed, just barely. When he took organic chemistry at uni, he found someone to tutor him.
“Then it’s fortunate one of us had the sense to suggest that we bring our revolvers.”
” I silently stared out the cab window until we pulled up at my mother’s townhouse. The clocks were just striking six as we climbed out of the cab and hurried up the walk.
He expects Holmes to make a snarky remark, but he just nods. “Fine. I’ll probably be out. The footage didn’t give us a view of your attacker’s face, but we know what he looks like from behind. He’ll probably have changed his hair colour, but I can recognise a man by the slant of his shoulders. I’ll hit a few bars, talk to people, see what I can pick up.”
“Daddy— I don’t want to leave. I don’t even really want to go to another school. Some of those kids— yeah, they’re idiots, but a new school isn’t going to be better. I have friends. Mum complains about them, but I’ve known them since I was in primary, and I don’t want to make new ones.”
He looks around the flat, the tacky, faded chairs, the faded wallpaper, the worn carpet, and he feels comfortable. But he needs a flatmate to afford it.
“I will endeavour to stay healthy so that I don’t die.”
“He was a juvenile offender, entered the system at fifteen. I can’t tell what he did because the record is sealed. Richard Brook is the name he took on release. Before that, he was James Moriarty. No, don’t bother. There’s nothing there. Moriarty has been wiped from the internet, not a minor accomplishment.”
always been the one on the losing side. He felt bad about not loving Molly
smile.
“Decline?” It took me a moment to realise that my mouth had dropped open. “Oh. I see. Your modesty prevents you from accepting this unexpected proposal. You do not wish to appear desperate; therefore, I must woo you. Very well. We could perhaps go to a few concerts or plays. A month’s courtship will be enough to sooth your vanity. I will ask again.” I put the box back in my pocket. “Would you like coffee?”
I examine the wounds. Only a couple are deep enough to be worrisome, but he’s avoided infection, which would have made it so much worse. He cringes a bit when I touch them, applying the salve he was prescribed. I cover them with a layer of gauze and pull a clean cotton t-shirt over it all.
“He is a
“Chocolate,” I said. “We were going to get married today.”
“I don’t know why I am whatever I am,” he says. “But you must believe me.”
One night, and he could put it all behind him.
Lying in hospital for weeks had given him a lot of time to think about this. It was normal, he’d decided. Maybe it even explained his failed marriage, in part. He’d been trying so hard back then, trying to fit in, please his family, do what he was expected to do. He remembered telling his dad that he’d gotten his girlfriend pregnant. Instead of being disappointed, his father had clapped him on the shoulder and congratulated him, as if it was a greater accomplishment than being the first in their family to go to university.
Watson smiled and held out his hand, bowing as he did. “I am very honoured to meet you, Mrs Holmes.”
He looks a bit sorry, as if he believes that they might just have sex and forget about what’s happened.
Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
“Who the hell is Murray?” Names were Watson’s area. I routinely deleted most names and faces now that I had someone to sort all of that out for me.
believe me.”
“It did.” He sighs. “It made all the difference. If I was hurt, or ill. Lonely. Especially the last time. That was the worst. I don’t know… I might have given up…”
The kiss eventually happened, but not as I had imagined. We had just returned to Baker Street after a day of fairly boring casework, and John, hanging up his coat by the door, was giggling at something I’d said.
“Well, let’s see, I’m still being bullied, Dad hates me for being gay, I hate me for showing emotions, and now you’re here. How do you think I’m doing?”
“Mikey, what’s - ?” She stopped midsentence as Mycroft, who had moved across the room, held his hands out towards a crawling Sherlock. When the baby had reached the middle of the room, he fell, limbs splaying out beneath him, but he was determined, and soon he made it into Mycroft’s arms. Mycroft looked at Mummy, smiling proudly, while she made sure to snap a few photos.
“How should we do this?” Greg asked. “Two face off, then the winner goes against someone else, or what?” Everyone pondered this as they realized they had an odd number of teams.
“What happened?”
“Hm? It was… it was fun, yeah.” John didn’t know where this was going.
“Mrs. Hudson!” he yelled. “Mrs. Hudson, come here!” She came upstairs as fast as she could, concerned by the edge in John’s voice.
“Oh, come on,” he’d said. “Do you really need to meet them?”
“What do you want me to say?”
“Probably,” said Sherlock.
"You can go first," John said after a pause. "What do I do?" Mrs. Hudson gave him a brief lesson on applying makeup, making him decorate the back of her hand and the inside of her wrist. "Okay, what colors do you want?" he asked. Mrs. Hudson had finally deemed him skilled enough to apply it to her face.
“Thanks. Have fun here!” He turned back to his partner and continued burying him (the sand was up to his neck). Then Sherlock tapped John’s shoulder.
Be safe.
“Oh, nice, maybe we can have a beach day while we’re there.”
"Oh, um," John stammered, "Mrs. Hudson and I were just, um, doing... makeovers." John's cheeks were reddening. "Fashion show."
“I didn’t know you were ready, we were waiting,” said John. Sherlock blinked.
“Shut up.” Sherlock looked away, but John could see the corners of his mouth turn upwards. They stood there for a bit, the waves lapping at their ankles. “Let’s go.”
“Sherlock. Listen, my friend over there, he likes you,” said Sherlock.
"Okay, fine. I'll do the makeup. But it has to be subtle! I don't want any bright green eye shadow or anything like that. Alright?" John relented.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said.
“What a poor sport.”
“Nope,” said John, shaking his head and smiling. Myron sat back down with the new album and opened it up to the first page. Mrs. Holmes was in a hospital bed with a bundle of blankets in her arms. She was smiling, though she looked very tired. Sherlock’s face was just visible under the blankets, and his eyes were squeezed shut. He was sleeping peacefully. John turned the page, and it was Mr. and Mrs. Holmes with Sherlock in the car, ready to drive home. Then there were a couple photos of just Sherlock in the car seat. Turn the page. Mrs. Holmes, carrying baby Sherlock, was walking through the door into the hall, where seven-year old Mycroft was waiting, visibly excited to see his new baby brother. A couple shots of him peering into the seat, and poking Sherlock with his finger. Just then, the front door opened and in strode Mycroft himself.
“Well, we should probably go pick out a good spot while we wait for the others,” suggested Lestrade. “I mean, there’s not much use standing around here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
NEW BELL
“Fine,” he said. “If you’ll all shut up after.” Sherlock and Lestrade grinned wickedly for a moment before Sherlock turned his attention back to his crabs. He reached his hand into the bucket and scooped up some sand and water, and picked up one of the crabs. The crab crawled around the tiny puddle of water. Sherlock smiled to himself.
“Do you?” John grinned smugly.
“At any rate, we know now, and we’re happy,” said Mr. Holmes, assisting John in defusing the situation. Sherlock’s face was now propped up by both of his hands, and he was sulking.
The rest of the trip followed a similar pattern. People wouldn’t wait for an explanation and assume they were a couple, then the boys would nod along, flustered, and awkwardly attempt to show affection. One time, Sherlock came out of nowhere and kissed John on the cheek. Lestrade had managed to snap a picture, much to John’s chagrin. But now the case was solved, Sherlock lauded, and it was time to head back to London. They made it to Boston long before they needed to be at the airport, so they decided it would be fun to walk around a bit. They didn’t have a particular destination in mind; they just went wherever they felt like. At some point, they passed a bakery, and Lestrade wanted to go in. He went to go get some pastries (it was a very late flight and they were hungry), and Sherlock and John waited outside. Neither of them spoke a word, but Sherlock seemed strangely on-edge. John chalked it up to being in a strange new city that Sherlock hadn’t committed to memory yet.
“So how are we going about the investigation, Sherlock?” Lestrade asked.
“And what’s same as always?” she pressed.
“I get it.” Molly smiled at him through shiny eyes.
“I guess we’ll have to do that,” said John.
“What about Dad?” he repeated, voice breaking.
“But you will,” he said. Sherlock made a face.
NEW COURT (6)
“Sherlock! Long time, no see, eh?” he asked, clapping a hand round his shoulder. Sherlock smiled in return.
“And how could I refuse such a generous offer?” said John, grinning. Not even Sherlock’s glare could wipe the smile off his face. The three turned back to the album, flipping through and pointing out funny (embarrassing) photos.
“Well, we are posing as a couple. We need to look the part.” John sighed and turned to the menu. A moment later, their waitress appeared.
“Victor,” said the man, offering his hand. A look of confusion briefly crossed Sherlock’s face before he put out his own.
“Sit,” he said.
Over the next few months, Mycroft spent lots of time playing with and taking care of his new brother. Sherlock didn’t seem very interested in what Mycroft thought was fun. He mostly just lay on his back and slept or cried. Sometimes he would just stare at Mycroft. One time Mycroft tried to explain to him the physics of how a superhero might be able to fly, but Sherlock just put his hand in his mouth and chewed on his little fingers. This annoyed Mycroft, but he was willing to let it slide because he was only a baby, and babies were interesting. They didn’t know anything, and so everything amazed them. Mycroft liked being able to amaze his brother.
“William.” Mycroft scrunched up his face.
“Ow, John, you’re pulling my hair!”
When John and Lestrade arrived at the lot, they were surprised to find what they were looking for almost immediately. Well. Not really. They found another clue, though. Taped to the gate was a paper that on first glance wouldn’t arouse suspicion, but upon closer glance would pique anyone’s interest. It read as follows:
“Are you sure you want her?” He asked his friend in a low voice. “You could do loads better. She has a reputation for partying, which is clearly true. I’ve done a study on the long-term signs of the occasional use of different liquors and drugs. She’s a big spender on a small paycheck, too, I mean, look at that dress, it’s expensive, and so’s her jewelry, but the dress has been rehemmed and its cleaning job is far from professional. Not very responsible, in my opinion,” Sherlock said quickly, rattling off his observations. “I’d say she also has a boyfriend right now, and he’s cheating too, based off of…” Sherlock trailed off, suddenly aware of a pair of eyes burning the back of his head. He turned around to see Sally glaring at him.
“So, Sherlock, what do you think?” asked John, making a face. They didn’t do small talk.
“Thanks, Sally,” said John, turning to leave. He could call Mycroft, but this seemed like it might be safer to discuss in person. He went outside and found the nearest security camera. He waved at it, and a few minutes later a sleek black car pulled up. Anthea, caught up in something on her phone, waved him in from her seat in the back. He climbed in and the car sped off. Soon they were outside an abandoned building. John went inside and immediately spotted Mycroft.
“Sherlock?” Mrs. Holmes’ shocked expression turned to one of perplexity. Sherlock looked ashamed.
“Same as always,” he said, continuing to eat his food.
“Right,” he said, and hurried off to the bathroom.
Sherlock was very confused as to why Mycroft didn’t want to play anymore. He’d make his way upstairs and toddle over to Mycroft’s closed door.
“How old are you?” the person on the other end asked.
"Thank you, John." She grinned. "It's your turn now!" John gave a deep breath and hoped it wouldn't be too bad.
After dessert, Mycroft’s dad lit a fire in the fireplace and he and Mummy sat on the couch, watching Mycroft play with Sherlock. The infant seemed to like it when Mycroft threw his stuffed animals into the air and caught them again. He made funny gasping noises while doing it, too, adding to Sherlock’s wide-eyed stare of amusement. He hadn’t laughed or even smiled yet (Mummy said that was normal), but Mycroft thought he could tell when Sherlock was having fun.
The Sunday before Christmas, the 18th, the Holmes family went out to get their tree. The tree farm they went to neighbored a regular farm, and as they drove by it, it was clear that Sherlock wanted to go there instead. Animals are much more fun than trees. They pulled into the lot and got out of the car. After trying to encourage Sherlock to walk, they decided it would just be faster to carry him. While Mummy and Daddy were picking out the tree, though, they set him down to play with Mycroft. He was standing still, nervous to take a step.
“Alright,” John said. “But never show these to anyone other than us three.” Click. Then the bathroom door opened, and out came Lestrade, looking as if he had never been roped into the fashion show. His face was plain and he was back in his normal clothes.
“Where are you guys?” John asked.
“Being your arch-nemesis is hard work, Sherlock. Sometimes I just need a break. To turn off the constant noise in my head.” He made an indescribable face. “But what are you doing here? You don’t seem like the beach-going type.”
“What’s Griswold laughing ab-” someone began before emitting a low chuckle. John turned around and Sherlock was standing above him.
19-15-18-18-25, 10-15-8-14. 20-8-5-25-22-5 7-15-20 13-5. 9 3-1-14-20 20-5-12-12 25-15-21 13-21-3-8 13-15-18-5 20-8-1-14 20-8-1-20, 2-21-20 13-1-25-2-5 13-25-3-18-15-6-20 23-9-12-12 2-5 1-2-12-5 20-15 8-5-12-16. 7-18-5-7.
“Hm?”
“Went to school, did the work, had lunch, did more work, came home.” Mum sighed.
“I’m so proud of you, Mikey. How about a biscuit to celebrate?” Mycroft followed Mummy into the kitchen, where a plate of biscuits fresh from the oven was waiting on the table. He eagerly took one and finished it in three bites.
“Oh, alright.”
After an hour, Sherlock was getting drowsy, so Mycroft brought him in for his afternoon nap. He set him down in the crib and went to get ready for Billy to come over. Billy always came over to play during Sherlock’s afternoon naps, so Mycroft was never bored. They had written over fifty issues, and had no plans to stop any time soon. Sometimes they’d spend the afternoons with Mycroft teaching Billy different things that they could use in their comic, and the other times were spent drawing and writing. Mycroft was such a good teacher that he and Billy were the two best students in class. Billy wasn’t as smart as Mycroft, but he was still remarkable compared to the other students. They were like goldfish.
“What do you mean?” he asked.
“Having some trouble with the suntan lotion?” asked John, suppressing a chuckle.
details on BACK.
“Oh, nice,” said Dad. “What’s that sample?” Sherlock was confused by the direction of the conversation. He thought they’d be discussing his homosexuality, not his fake experiment.
“A missing persons and a murder. Possibly the missing person is the murderer, but evidence doesn’t look like it. The head officer on the case is a cousin of Lestrade’s, which explains why he’s so confused and needs our help.”
“Nothing. Good night.” John left and went upstairs to his room. Sherlock remained in his chair for the better part of the night, past even when Mrs. Hudson came home.
“I wouldn’t say genius,” she said. “I wrote a few books, but when Mikey was born I decided I’d rather raise him and this young man.” She gestured to Sherlock. Mr. Holmes shook his head, a bemused expression on his face.
“Where in America will we be going?” John said after a pause.
“Since when did the police become the unemployment agency?”
“Yes, Sergeant, I was wondering if I might see what he took. Since I’m his brother,” Mycroft said. Lestrade nodded.
“Oh, hey, Molly,” he said. “Did you bring the doughnuts?”
“Because we’re bored and you were in the wrong place at the wrong time,” answered John. “Now, Mrs. Hudson, what shall we do?” They started with scrubbing his face raw.
“It was still cold,” Mycroft said, arms crossed.
“Whatcha got there, Sherlock?” said Lestrade.
“Yes, they are, aren’t they?” The boys continued their walk in mostly silence as they enjoyed their cones. They were about to turn onto the street for home when Mycroft looked over at Sherlock and saw that his mouth was covered in ice cream. They couldn’t walk in the house looking like that. Even Mummy would notice it, and then they’d get in trouble. “Sherlock, we need to get you cleaned up before you go inside.”
“Sherlock, this seems a bit… romantic.”
“I’m sorry I’m late, you know how it can get at the office,” he said upon leaving his car.
“For some people,” said Sherlock arrogantly, dismissing the compliment.
That evening, Sherlock prepared a detailed argument on why he should be able to adopt Redbeard. He told Mummy and Daddy how having a dog would make him happy, instill responsibility and how it would help Mr. Billings. It would help keep him busy and out of the house. He made extra sure to say please and use his best diplomatic voice. Mycroft taught him about diplomacy, and Sherlock had never used it before now. Mummy seemed to be convinced he should have the dog, but Daddy was on the fence.
Mycroft did his best to enjoy his remaining time with Billy that summer, but as soon as he came home he’d immediately go upstairs and distract himself with a puzzle, or schoolwork, or extra work he’d assigned himself, so he wouldn’t think about the end of the summer. He still couldn’t get the hang of the violin and in early August he gave up entirely. The violin was put in the closet with the book of manners. He only came downstairs for dinner, and always ate as fast as possible so he could leave quickly. He ended up eating more, as when one eats fast they don’t realize they’re full until much later.
“Never mind. Don’t know why I assumed that,” he dismissed.
“That wasn’t sentiment. That was survival. You were freezing.” John said nothing, but buried his face in Sherlock’s chest.
TW: Blatant homophobia (internalized and external) and implied aro/acephobia.
Mycroft was very pleased with his gifts. He had gotten some comic books from Grandma and Granddad, and his parents had given him some too, as well as some candy and a book of puzzles (technically, that last one was from “Sherlock”, though Mycroft knew that wasn’t true). Grandmother and Grandfather had given him a “Boy’s Guide to Manners”. As soon as they weren’t looking, Mycroft put it in a bin at the very back of his closet. Uncle Rudy had gotten him a violin, though Mycroft didn’t play. Uncle Rudy thought that maybe it would be fun for Mycroft to learn, and would be beneficial to him. Mycroft decided it wouldn’t hurt to try, so he had no trouble smiling and saying thank you. Sherlock also got a good haul of presents. Mycroft had picked out for him a fuzzy blanket with bees on it, and the baby was over the moon about it. He seemed happy enough about the other presents (mainly picture books and stuffed animals), but the blanket stole the show.
“I’m glad you thought that was funny, I tried really hard.” Lestrade’s mock anger faded into a smile. The three stood there for a while until Mrs. Hudson decided to make some tea.
“Alright, then, let’s have some lunch.” Sherlock reluctantly put the crab back in the bucket with the others and went to his chair. His legs were covered in sand and he tried to brush it off before sitting down but it wasn’t enough. John passed him his lunch: a salad and a water. Light enough that Sherlock would probably eat most of it, meaning less waste. John, on the other hand, was having a ham sandwich with crisps and a lemonade. While they were eating, Molly and Mrs. Hudson returned. As Molly wrapped herself in her towel, Mrs. Hudson regaled them with the tale of her wooing.
“Lestrade was being mean.” Lestrade looked shocked.
“Too busy with, um, work.”
“Great. Second, you need a job.”
“Science.”
“What’s the matter, Billy?” asked Mycroft once all the other guests left. They were sitting on Billy’s front porch, snacking on some candy. Billy fiddled with the hem of his shirt.
“Knowing you, it’s hardly a coincidence. What are you doing here? Got any murders lined up?” Sherlock responded coldly, pushing off his hand and taking a step back.
"Would you like to go first, or should I?" Mrs. Hudson asked.
“That’s a lie.”
Food’s getting cold.
“Mycroft Holmes, I swear to God I will topple your entire country if you don’t stop moving,” Jim said, getting increasingly louder with each word. He managed to stay still long enough for Jim to climb up. He patted him on the head. “Good job, Mike.”
The kids who play football during break always end up with a cloudy brown dirt stain on their lower legs, and darker spots of soil on the bottoms and lower sides of the shoes. Often their knees are dirty as well. The kids who stay up past their bedtime have bags under their eyes and usually look dazed when they enter the class, and they move slower. Mrs. Morris smoked in the past, though currently she’s in the process of quitting. Her teeth are slightly yellowed, and so are her nails. She has breathing issues if she gets too worked up, and her voice is sometimes raspy.
“Hi, guys!” said Molly. Lestrade lowered his sunglasses.
