“We better get back to work.” Bruce reminds them softly, and they all shuffle a bit awkwardly in place before approaching the worktables, readjusting to the mindset necessary to focus on the pressing concerns displayed on the projection board before them, if not a little hesitant to begin.
And Tony pretended he didn’t know why at the time, that he simply respected her wishes, but that’s not true. He
it’s not true, because they all saw it. They all saw the mob, the crowd who wanted to set this building on fire not because of the people inside, but because… just
, after all these years, the one who won’t let him give up no matter what. So Tony remembers. Not only because the world will not allow him to forget, but because he has to, because it is his duty, it’s his burden to carry, because it’s the weight of his choices and the shortcomings of his actions that led him to this.
“Go hit your own robot!” Steve complains, but at the same time, he throws his shield again, and not only it hits Tony’s target, but also the poor, innocent robot to his right, in the other free lane.
“Well…” Scott hesitates, waiting for him to continue, and when he doesn’t, Scott sighs and his breath causes a static to go through the phone, uncomfortable and noisy— The very same noise Steve can hear inside of his head now. Like a missing connection. An interference. A huge fog that clouds all of his senses and makes him completely
From here on out, I will loosely divide this fic into arcs - and in each one, we'll discuss a different character, and address whatever issues need to be addressed by that character, and take a deeper look into their relationship with Tony. I say loosely because you'll be able to see clearly their starting point, but you probably won't be able to see the ending point, not for all of those arcs. Some issues transcend a two-person relationship. Some issues involve all of them. Some issues never end. The lines will get a little blurred sometimes.
I think you’re going too far with this.” Natasha warns, with a slight hint of humor, but it’s hard to tell if it’s meant to be lighthearted or mocking. It somehow ends up being both.

“The Reality Stone is able to create illusions.” Thor offers, a little louder, so they all pay attention to what he’s saying. “Visual illusions, yes, but also in a way that distorts reality itself. A being can give itself a larger, stronger form, one can walk a path where there is none, and it – it always looks for a host.”
“I don’t know.” Steve admits, but it barely sounds like an admission. It sounds more mysterious, more guarded, just…
“No, it wouldn’t.” Steve admits, a little bitter. “Either you gave them to him a long time ago, and although he had months to read it through, he still went for it… Or you gave him recently, and he barely read them before he accepted. None of those options would make me feel better.”
Bruce looks at Tony, and Tony actually feels a pang of something that almost feels like nostalgia, a soft, almost bittersweet sensation blooming like a shy flower inside his chest, old, frazzled memories resurfacing at the corners of his head like old photographs, blurred at the edges, but still carrying weight and meaning to them anyway.
And it’s not the same, it just isn’t, to fight a guy that’s human, and to fight something else, that comes from space, and you have no idea how to beat it.

Steve thought that it would be enough, even thought Tony still made his head spin with so many conflicting thoughts running around at the same time, he thought what they had had been good enough. He had been happy

not his therapist, and it’s not his job to take care of Tony’s pile of issues and traumas. That’s Tony’s problem, not anyone else’s. and it’s not cool of him to make Bruce uncomfortable just to avoid the conversations he doesn’t want to have. If Tony was a normal adult, he could simply talk about it without going irrationally emotional over it, or maybe he could respectfully ask to be left alone, and never address this again – but Tony is

The hands on his shoulders disappear suddenly, and Tony has a brief moment of the most complete, absolute panic, the lack of touch as terrifying as the darkness outside the windows, as the silence surrounding him – And when a jolt makes something in his chest pull forward, a tug that comes straight from the place where is Arc Reactor, his
“They’re waiting in case we need backup.” Natasha clarifies, calmly. “If it gets critical, we call them.”
A wave of pure hopelessness washes over the entire room, Agent Ross going as far as letting himself drop onto one of the couches like a sack of potatoes, losing all control of his weight.
Tony curses through gritted teeth, ignoring the way his heart beats one very painful beat, hope dying violently in the crooked, hidden spaces between his ribs.
he uses it on the two people who hate you all the most in all of Sokovia. If that thing really works that way, is it really any wonder how Ultron came out the way he did?”
And Steve ignored him, in favor of Bucky’s words. In favor of Zemo’s threat. They have always been stronger together,
Bucky wouldn’t want that. So Steve would be back, and as soon as he was, they would go, together, as he promised.
“That’s not a fair bet.” Steve complains, but he’s smiling too. “I’ve been asleep for seventy years, I haven’t been up to the economy lately. I heard the inflation is pretty high.”
Tony remains completely unresponsive for two entire days. Those two days are filled with the most unnerving unease she has ever felt in her life.

Tony doesn’t answer. If he opens his mouth, he will sob. He can only shake his head, turning his face to the left so the creature won’t be able to see his red, swollen face, tear tracks along his cheeks and blood staining his lips, mixing iron and ash at the back of his tongue, the flavor of cruel, cruel
Tony had missed him during the mess with the Accords. Just like he had missed Bruce. Tony had missed them both, for so many reasons, but now, mostly because he had believed that of all of them, as a
The sun has already gone down and soon enough they’ll have to sleep. Their hotel is on the other side of town, too far away from the tiny apartment Clint rented for himself and Wanda, so they decided to split up for the night. Steve decided to stay, taking up Clint’s offer for the couch – despite him knowing he won’t sleep at all, his body thrumming with nerves, a low hum of worry sizzling under his skin, making the hairs in his arms stand like static –, while Nat and Sam spend one more night at the hotel and gather their belongings in the next morning. As soon as they can they will move closer, and decide what’s the best course of action based on the final outcome of Scott’s trial.

relax when they leave the open field and are back again inside the safety of a secure building, and it pangs on his chest for a whole another reason, for nostalgia and regret, something softer, something quiet.
Because he’d trusted Steve. Even when they fought even when Steve was out there, doing the very same things Tony asked him not to do, not seeing how catastrophic it would be when the consequences of his actions finally weighted on the civilians – even then, Tony had believed in him.
“Guilt makes us do amazing things, Cap.” Clint says cryptically, giving him a wry smile before returning to seriousness. “I trust Wanda to learn that guilt is not something that should hold her back, it should push her forward. I trust her to be strong and get over this, because she
“I cannot tell with only our private satellites, Boss.” FRIDAY regretfully answers. “I would need your permission to extend my reach of research and produce a more accurate estimation of the numbers.”
Tony lets himself sag back into his seat when the room goes silent again, feeling like he has just been hit with a truck, or an entire convoy of trucks – or maybe just a giant, purple alien with the biggest weapon ever created. It’s like he has been drained dry, his body just a husk, his head pulsating and aching incessantly, exhaustion seeping into his bones like stains into cloth. Not even the kind of exhaustion that would make him shut down and sleep for days, because that type of exhaustion Tony knows far too well. No, the kind of exhaustion that makes him feel like his limbs are about to fall off, all strength of his body melting and dripping away, while his mind is too alert to shut down properly, as his body does.
She stops and blinks repeatedly, as if she’s holding back tears, and Tony runs the pad of his thumb over her wrist, caressing the blue veins on her pulse, and Pepper shudders as she takes in a deep breath, letting the air flow into her lungs, closing her eyes for just a second to reign her emotions back in and calm down.
“Alright, that’s as good as any.” Tony mumbles to himself, scratching his head nervously, a sheepishness he hasn’t felt in years crawling under his skin with sharp pinpricks of needles. “Let’s talk about the other ones, then. What do we got?”
Tony tried his best to keep his Avenging and his life with Pepper separate, after what happened with the Mandarin. She tried her best to be comprehensive and supportive of Tony’s role as Iron Man, even after experiencing firsthand the dangers of it. He tried to step back, when she admitted she missed him and was scared for his health. She tried to be understanding and to help him after the fallout from the Accords hit him so hard that he couldn’t stand to look at the suit for the first four months.

We're gonna get a little technical from this chapter on. We still have to finish talking about Pepper, of course, but we can't forget that the world is ending, now, can we? We have to do something about that. So we will!
Tony wishes he could keep her from this. That he could erase this from her mind and keep her safe from this tragedy, but he can’t.
– staggering down the ramp in quick steps, arms flailing to keep himself upright with his hasty rhythm, eyes flicking between his own feet and Tony in Rhodey’s arms, and Tony thinks he’ll end up falling over in his clumsy trajectory if he’s not careful.
“You gonna talk or do I have to drag it out of you?” Sam insists, stepping forward to stand right behind Steve, in a way that Steve cannot continue fighting unless he wants to shove his elbow in Sam’s face.
Tony would make a joke about this hurting his ego, but he doesn’t – no need to give Steve any more ammo if he’s not gonna play nice.
“I always am, Tony.” Bruce says, but not unkindly – simply factual. “I understand why you two would disagree over it – but this… This is
It’s them, and years and years of unfiltered information; It’s them and the possible answer to their survival, hidden between lines and pictures and old data files, and he’s not sure they’ll be quick enough to find it. It’s Tony, and the shivers down his back at the sight of Rogers and the other two leaving, with both whispers of

“We are not gonna split.” Natasha says, with immensurable distress in her voice, and her gaze, when Tony finally manages to cease his staring contest with Barton to look at her directly, is fiery and pointed, as lethal as one of knives, unbreakable determination. “Stop it, Tony.”
“I don’t know.” Pepper admits, sniffing discretely, but still keeping the tight smile on her face. “It’s been a lot, Tony. It’s – It’s difficult.”
Before you can say "But Machi, is that it? This tiny piece of subjective conversation, that's what you mean by talking about it?", worry not: No, that's not it. There is more to come, my dear drama-loving friends. We'll go for the full meltdown, I promise, but unfortunately, this chapter had to be cut for word count reasons, because if you know me and my previous work, you know that this bastard does tend to get the best of me.

a date!?” Tony looks back in the direction of the Archives, but it lasts less than a second, his gaze snapping back to Steve like magnets. “Is that why you were flirting with me?”
And when he looks up at Tony and the sentiment in his eyes does not fade, Tony can’t do anything but exhale slowly, deeply, a ridiculously infatuated sigh.
“What?” Steve blinks, and groans loudly once he realizes what Tony means. “No! Tony. I’m just saying it’s pretty impressive how you use your armor.”
“There is no guarantee that’ll work well, Scott.” Steve reminds him. “They might put you back in the Raft.”
In fact, if Natasha wasn’t here, he wouldn’t even bother with it. He probably wouldn’t even think about it, because he knew he’d have no help and there would be no other way. He’d just swallow the bitterness down and do what he has to do, because it’s what’s right, and that was that.

Vision isn’t here, JARVIS isn’there, Ultron isn’t here. If this is all meant to be ironic, Tony fails to see the humor in it. Such an awful coincidence. Or maybe it’s not. A coincidence, he means. Maybe it’s not. There is some odd pain attached to it, some sense of hollowness he can’t explain, not sharp like before, when he first lost JARVIS, but no less present; Like it’s an old wound, that only hurts from time to time, beneath the scarred tissue. Tony has many of those, some more visible than others, but the origin of this one is strange.
It’s no surprise Barton is the first one to break and to attack Tony. They never were in the same page, not once, not since Ultron.
“Not for lack of trying, right?” Ross stares him down, provoking. “Rogers might have other priorities, but you sure would do anything to protect him, even lie. It’s a shame he doesn’t feel the same.”

“Tony.” Pepper repeats, trying to get him to listen, in that tone that makes his name sound like a whole sentence.
Some of them nod, a little uncertain, but with enough willingness to let Bruce’s explanation continue that no one interrupts.
“He was trying to stop Stark from stopping Steve.” Wanda points out, her brows furrowed in puzzlement.
“Don’t worry, we won’t leave anything behind.” Steve assures him, completely confident in his words, while he stares at the window, as if he could see Natasha return if he looked for her hard enough. But he can’t. Their room faces the outskirts of the city, close enough to an abandoned industrial complex that if the necessity arises, they would have a place to escape to. Their rooms are always right in the middle of the building, never top floor, never street level, because they need the option of running up

who can’t understand how grave the situation is. “Just because you hate politics, Cap, doesn’t mean you are removed from them. You wear a flag as a uniform.”
I don't expect the movie to show the reality of it, because the reality is dangerous. It is, after all, just a movie. They would never put actors and famous people in a situation where they could actually get hurt; but once you craft a story that will use reality as an argument, and you use a place I am intimately familiar with in one of your films - I think I have the right to point out something very, very important that you missed: The Accords are built by governors, from a desire that foreigners should respect their sovereignty. Which, to anyone with no trust in governments, or that's used to being well-received rather than suspected, might sound shoddy and mistrustful. So let me tell you something about a special kind of sovereignty; the sovereignty built by people, and the means they are willing to use, to maintain it.

For anyone who might be freaking out about my posting schedule as we're getting closer to Endgame - I hope to bring at least another chapter before the movie launches, which I'll be seeing in the release date in my country, April 25. The next chapter is already in the works, with a big section already written, so it should come considerably faster than the previous ones. We'll continue to talk about Pepper and her influence in Tony's life and decisions, and her own development and story arc, now that she is, inescapably, part of the consequences of Tony's superhero side of life.
“Ok.” Sam exhales harshly, pushing all the air out of his lungs with force, grunting as he shifts in place again so he can pull his legs from the edge and turn his body to Steve, so they can have this conversation face to face. Steve feels pressured to do the same, even if the discomfort he feels by being so openly vulnerable makes his neck hot with shame. “Do you wanna hear what I think?”
“And we should be thinking fast, we’re closing in soon.” Rhodey calls over his shoulder, curt and loud. “We have fifteen minutes. We’re gonna go lower so we can see what’s happening, so hold on, we might have some trouble with the route, we could hit something.”
“Also Time is complicated.” Bruce offers. “Even if certain events are set in stone, not all of them might be, and Thanos coming might have been only a possibility and not a certainty until a specific point. Maybe something happened that shifted the universe in a way that set us on a path where it would cross his, and only then the Stones thought it would be necessary to warn us about him.”

Tony watches her face, the way a shadow of muted grief passes through her midnight eyes, like dying stars in the depths of the vast space, and, for the briefest of moments, Tony remembers Thor, Thor and Loki – and the quiet, somber fondness lacing through the whispered memories Thor weaved right before Tony’s eyes in the morning cold of this same workshop, where secrets and silent hurts come to be pried open and bleed, apparently, and he imagines, as someone who grew up so very alone, what it must have been like, to grow up… not alone; And yet, not being able to live peacefully with someone who you’re supposed to share such a deep connection with.
And he makes the mistake of looking at Rogers, unconsciously, and, as if sensing his gaze, Rogers’ eyes flick back and find his, and they stare at each other, in silence—
He also doesn’t think if that uncomfortable feeling is coming from him, from his obvious refusal to look in Rogers’ direction,
. Rogers looks at him like he can see past his skin, into his soul, like he has something he’s trying to say without opening his mouth, and it makes the hairs on Tony’s arms stand on edge because he doesn’t
But on another note, one that has less to do with plot and more to do with characterization, we have another issue we need desperately to discuss: Pepper Potts and James Rhodes. As you can see in the tags, this is full-on IW compliant, which means that at this point in time, Tony and Pepper are still very much engaged, as IW establishes. But as the tags also say, this is a SteveTony fic. Not only that, we've all seen how Rhodey reacted to Steve coming back to the Compound, how not-enraged he was and how strange that is, considering what happened in Siberia - and as the tags say, this is also a Team Iron Man fic. So what the hell is going on here?
, none of them could, how vital was for Steve to get Bucky safe and acquitted of the Winter Soldier’s crimes.

trapped inside his mouth, and no strength or desire to utter them out loud – and a group at his back, silent and watching, and unaware, unaware of the storm that rages within, oblivious to the ache that echoes inside, that Tony hides after a long blink, a breath, and a shudder.
“I wasn’t here. I didn’t see.” Tony says, and the words hurt like he’s being gutted. “So I need to go out there and see it for myself. To help people. And then, I’ll know how to fix it.”
“Well, you noticed too.” Tony grumbles, almost childishly. He knows why Thor is assuming – correctly – this is about Steve, because they all

, he won’t allow anyone to mess with his AI, not again, no matter who they are; But the moment dies almost as soon as it forms, a rush of air leaving his lungs harshly as he remembers that Nebula has literally fixed his nanite housing unit and saved his life just a few days ago, while he was unconscious, and nothing bad came out of it. Which doesn’t mean it
Rhodey takes half a step forward unthinkingly, responding to the spike of raw and uncontrolled emotion in Bruce’s voice, and both Tony and Thor flinch – not because of Bruce, but of Rhodey’s reaction, and a suffocating feeling of grief and shame falls upon Tony like a heavy blanket, despite not being him the one who moved, but far too aware of how the movement will be perceived by Bruce’s mind.
Nebula gives him two more slaps, strong enough to sting, to make sure he stays awake. “We can land. Tell me where to land.”
The world will not explode – it has already been cracked, and now it will crumble from within. It’s just human nature. It’s just…
“I mean…” Lang makes a face that doesn’t explain anything at all, and at Tony’s lack of response, he poses his question in other words: “How can you be sure he didn’t destroy them?”
That’s… Steve hadn’t thought this could happen. Even more so after Leipzig. This is a glaring, ugly, enormous contradiction to his version of things, a gigantic hole in his argument against the Accords, and… What can he do?
“Thank you, Your Highness.” He says, equally professional. There isn’t much feeling in his words, but then again, he’s not really feeling much at this moment. His thoughts are elsewhere. His adrenaline is picking up at the thought of

“I had to stop him, Nat—” Steve begs, begs for her to understand, even if he knows she is way past listening now.
“A few hours after your disappearance.” FRIDAY says, “They interrupted a video conference between Colonel Rhodes and Secretary Ross, and soon after, Colonel Rhodes suited up and followed them to Wakanda.”
“You are a SHIELD agent.” He stated, making his unwillingness to cooperate very obvious, unless the man gave him more details about his unwanted presence in his home.
But it’s awkward. Of course it’s awkward. But it seems like it’s so awkward for Tony that as soon as they pass by Van Dyne’s Outfits, he hands Steve off to his friend, the bubbly and enthusiastic Jan, that seems very excited to give Captain America the tour when Tony has to

Dear Christ, no one else knows, besides Bucky. He never told them. Isn’t that the biggest joke of them all, the divine punishment for everything he’s done, for every single time he accused them of hiding something from him? This is penitence. This is the universe finally, finally getting back at him, the hypocrite, the coward part of himself, who speaks of graveyards of untold truths and judges others for their reservations, but hides a secret so big that it’s literally bursting out of his mouth with the need to be freed—

“Helping you.” She assures, pushing away from the wall and approaching him with steady steps, even though Steve is still holding the gun, just in case. “It’ll be much faster and much safer if you have help. The Raft’s security is not easy to override.”
? Am I making fun of you?” Tony repeats, incredulous, and Steve’s expression clouds so quickly that he immediately hastes to correct himself. “No! Of course not, why would I—”

“Your Highness.” All three of them greet at the exact same time − but then, Natasha immediately keeps talking, her tone incredibly respectful and professional, even if a little rushed. “Thank you for allowing us entrance. We understand the delicate position you’re in, as a King, to grant fugitives access to your nation.”
until they both cram themselves into the elevator with no care at all, as the door closes and FRIDAY takes them up in the direction of the landing pad.
“Nevermind, it’s… I get it. It’s really not—” Sam exhales harshly, pushing all the air out of his lungs in a very exaggerated gesture, as if he could push the terrible thoughts about it along with it, expelling it from his body. “It’s not easy. I get that.”
“So yelling at your teammates is something you usually do ‘round here? Does it work? It didn’t seem like it works.”
Tony twists a little to take a better look at Nebula, and something sharp stings him from the inside, and he wobbles in place. He takes in a hard, difficult breath, his body still not fully his own, and Nebula takes this as a sign she must push him forward and guide him inside with slow and soft steps, their shoes making muffled sounds against the cold floor, the vast emptiness of the hallways making them echo into nothingness.
It’s not… It’s not Rhodey’s fault. Tony’s issues, that is. It’s not his fault for pushing Tony – Tony knows he is a handful. And Rhodey is right to ask, it’s not like he has no reason to be concerned. But still.
“Technically, no.” Jarvis concedes. “It’s a program that replicates young Anthony’s speech pattern. And he grasps speech patterns from people who interact with him and classifies them, so he can recognize who is messaging him. That way, he can’t message anyone without authorization.”

But it’s ok. It’s ok because Tony is back, and she’ll take whatever piece of him Howard brings back to her.
“I don’t think he’s staying with us.” Clint answers. “He mentioned Tony would be back at the Compound by Monday, so he probably should be gone before that.”
He didn’t intimidate Bucky, he didn’t threaten Steve with the Accords. He was… He was a friend, he was listening to Steve about the Winter Soldiers, he hadn’t even been trying to trick them into coming back after the problem was solved.
“We don’t know. He never came up for the call, and when we checked his room, he wasn’t there.” She clarifies, and instead of being filled with concern, her voice carries a light tilt of curiosity, as if she’s wondering about the mysterious circumstances of Lang’s disappearance not as a problem, but as a puzzle to be solved. “The book he took with him was missing too.”
That same heavy, suffocating grief trickles in again, terribly familiar now, and it’s impossible to resist the impulse to avert their gazes to the floor as they are yet again forced to relive the reality of the situation they’re in, that doesn’t get any easier each time they have to talk about it out loud.
“Huh, not a lot?” Lang admits. “I can handle myself on quantum mechanics, but that’s pretty much it.”
, in his rational mind, that Pete was, at most, a mentee or a protégé, and that’s all. The kid had his own family, after all. He had his Aunt, and his friends, and all the people that already existed in his life before Tony came around. Tony was not his father.
thoughts. “I need to start on damage control, right away. Find out whoever is… left. Gather a team, get to work.”
Bucky huffs out a laugh, as if he’s vexed with Steve’s obvious display of sentimentalism, and he quickly finds a way out of what he probably thinks was about to become a very uncomfortable topic.
And it’s completely involuntary, a reflex so instinctive it’s nearly primal, but the feeling that comes over him, immediately, is a pure, unshakable, completely raw feeling of—
“Ultron was always… odd.” Bruce tilts his head, thinking. “He had this speech about all that’s left is metal, that sort of stuff, JARVIS didn’t talk like that, and neither did Wanda. Loki did, a little bit, but it was a lot more…” He huffs. “I don’t know.”
, and here Tony is, agonizing over his feelings; he deserves better. Better than someone like Tony, who couldn’t even protect him in the first place, like he said he would. Tony knows, somewhere deep inside his mind, that Peter’s disappearance in particular is not
, that’s completely destroyed, concrete and stone piled like corpses on top of the entire right side, burying it beneath an enormous mountain of rubble. The heat signature panels warn them, in flashing messages, that there are still some small fires in the middle of it. Tony can’t even see where.
The man gives him the tiniest of smirks, a secret, quiet little thing, just like the rest of him. His eyes glint in a way that almost make him look softer, a bit more friendly, like a man who still has a very warm soul underneath a very hard and carefully constructed exterior. His mirth can be felt in waves in the air. Jarvis would’ve liked to appreciate It more, if he wasn’t so tense and worried as he is.
“It’s their instinctual response. They won’t politely ask what you’re doing there, if you just barge in with a gun, when they’re not expecting. If they don’t want you there. They just shoot back. Because they can’t take the chance you won’t shoot first. More so when you’re military.” He takes in a wet, choked breath. “I couldn’t go back to make sure the people who helped me were okay. There was this girl, Martina – If they suspected she helped me, and if they thought I had something to do with the unit that invaded the slum, they could have taken her, to try and make her talk. She could have been hurt, and it would’ve been my fault.”
Pepper stops, and looks at him for a moment. Her eyes are not judging, but in her pause, Tony sees the rush of something flick through her gaze, an emotion Tony fears to identify. “No, it wouldn’t.”, she says, and it’s surprisingly gentle.
“I did. Flawed and mad as he was, we could be as odd as day and night, but he was my family, and I will miss him. Every time I thought he was gone, I still missed him as much as I did in the first place. Even with all he has done, his loss always feels like it’s new.” Thor says mournfully, as truthful as Tony expected him to be. “I miss all of them. My mother, my father. Asgard is all the family I have left – and they are still gone… The ones who could escape with Valkyrie when Thanos attacked our ship.”
“It’s the dust, isn’t it?” Lang, surprisingly, says, with a nearly unsettling amount of insight. They can’t
He gets into the elevator with a steaming fresh mug in his hands, feeling awkward and a little guilty, because he feels like he somehow misstepped in their earlier conversation, and he doesn’t like that idea. Tony is being gracious enough to house them, the very least Steve could do is not antagonize him – not any more than absolutely necessary.
“It doesn’t bother me.” Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “Okay, it does, but not for the reasons you think.”
But that’s where it all falls apart. That’s where the rage comes in – because Barton, at a certain point, did decide to turn his back on his family. For the goddamned
“He has been awake for a few months now.” He says calmly, and its like all air has been punched out of Steve’s chest, his lungs collapsing on themselves, and the tidal wave of emotions inside him only grows and grows, overwhelming and terrifying, completely silent under his skin. “But he asked for privacy, so we complied with his request.”
“This guy clearly hasn’t done his homework.” Tony grumbles, but it’s futile, because his comms are on, which means
Bruce feels shame, and even if Tony doesn’t believe Bruce is deserving of half of it, probably even less than that, he can recognize it when he sees it. He can’t make it stop. He doesn’t know how – and even if he did, Bruce wouldn’t let him. They are both mirrored images of men who have gone too far with their pursues, science and knowledge turning into jagged edges of knives plunged into their backs by their own hands, bleeding regret instead of blood.
“And where the hell would you go?” Tony asks, with a little too much scorn. He’s not even sure what makes him angrier. If it’s the softness in Rogers’ voice, or the burning, earnest look in his eyes, or the ridiculousness of his statement, or the
, but it’s not. He doesn’t know how he knows this, but something in the air, something in the quiet look Rocket and Nebula exchange; Tony has a quick, but very startling realization that he is not the one who feels like Nebula’s story hits a little
For a brief, dark moment, he wonders if she’s doing this because she doesn’t believe he will survive this time, not this time – and he hates that the even dares to think of it right in the next second, because it’s such an uncharitable thought, and Pepper would never do something like that.
And Rocket follows them, confused, because – How else would he feel, really. How else, when he is… When he’s truly the most stranded out of all of them, the one who came from far away and was left with nothing, nothing but the company of people he barely knew, and all forms of contact the attempted to find his own team only came back with silence and more dread?
“If Thanos was the one to send Loki,” Bruce theorizes. “He was the first person to have the Mind Stone at all. Before Wanda, before Strucker, before all of this. If Loki got the Scepter from him, that’s one more person to be in contact with the Mind Stone before it got to us.”
Tony wants to cry. He wants to, but he can’t. He’s too exhausted. But deep inside, the turbulent, roaring feeling he is developing for Nebula, this twisted mess of mistrust and gratitude, it’s shifting and mutating into something that will latch onto him in a way Tony will never be able to let go of. He wants it to stop, but he can’t. He doesn’t want to get attached. He doesn’t want to feel like this.
it existed. Because why would Tony not mention it, when Vision suggested he wanted to find Wanda? And why would he want to be ignorant of their position, if Vision knew? Tony, who is the most paranoid person Steve has ever met? Steve knows it’s safer, because of Ross, because of the Accords, but when did Tony ever care about those kind of things when it mattered?
“This way.” Wong gestures to the side, and offers no other explanation for what he has just done, for what kind of door was that they just crossed, or
feeling Tony’s getting, it makes his brain itch a little, a nagging strange sensation at the back of his mind.
“Are you hurt?” Nebula interjects, worriedly, her face distorting to something too similar to a frown.
Hands that are trembling and aching, hands who felt the warmth of the body he grasped just dissipate away, the weight and the presence blinking out of existence right before his eyes, leaving him
And so, before we get to Bucky, let's go through Wanda. And all the projecting, expectations and weirdly protective beliefs Steve applied onto her when she joined the team. Let's be honest, I'm not fully convinced about Wanda's characterization in the MCU. In fact, I'd go as far as to say she's no more than a very convenient placeholder, whose powers and motivation bend into whatever shape the writers and produces require her to, and spends almost 100% of her time having her personal story affected by the men that surround her, that make her choices for her and make her seem like a person with no independence whatsoever. The kind of character I usually don't spare a glance at. Let's fix that, shall we? She's supposed to be an Avenger, so let's make her one. It might take a little while; after all, Steve is nothing if not stubborn, but that's exactly why we're here. We're making sure he learns some stuff. Why not include 'how to properly support your guilt-ridden teammates' on that list? After all, he's gonna need it very soon.
Once inside, the Captain lays him down on his bed; Opulent, luscious furs, warm and silken, strewn on the cold floor, surrounded by the gifts and offerings presented to them as wishes of good fortune in their union. Gold and jewels, weapons and fruit, and rare items Antonio has only ever dreamed of seeing in his lifetime – He is placed among them, flanked by treasures, and at last he is where he was intended, with the Captain’s spoils, the most valuable gift his Kingdom could offer.
“Gratitude is not necessary, Mrs. Stark. I was always very fond of Anthony.” Jarvis assures her, but it doesn’t escape her that Jarvis didn’t bother to contradict her in anything else.
Tony shakes his head at him, and follows. Rhodey doesn’t ask about that the hell happened there by the workshop steps, and Tony’s glad.
, a sense of shame he cannot control and should not have at all, because it is all the Winter Soldier’s fault, not his.
“Let’s bring it to the workshop. FRI, call everyone.” Tony says. “I want to see what we’re dealing with here.”
“Make me.” He childishly replies, and Steve ignores the instinct to think why that sounds so suggestive on his mind.
When he takes off the excess, he can see his own reflection in U’s arm, distorted by its circumference and material, but even then, Tony realizes he looks like
Chastised like a child, whose parent knows he is doing something wrong but refuses to accept, because he wants to pretend it didn’t happen and let it go. It’s something that it pains him to remember – it feels him with that hot,
And Steve won’t take up on that offer for a very long time, but he nods in acquiescence and, to be perfectly honest, in gratitude.
“Sorry, force of the habit.” Steve hears a rustling on the background of Scott’s side of the line, and he imagines the man fiddling with something, awkwardly. “Hum… Hey, Steve. I think we need to talk about something.”
“Are you asking for an actual moment in time or you’re just feeling introspective? Because I have a few guesses, but you’re not going to like them.” Natasha asks, and Steve even dares to imagine she is smirking a little, even if it’s frail and a little forced, but he will take it anyway.
Bruce makes a pause. Blinks. “When you put it like that, it really doesn’t sound like it’s a good idea to sign.”
Nebula. Still could. How ironic is that, him being trapped with a being that is half-made of metal, when Tony, even today, when he tries to take his time and step away from his work-binges more often and care more about real people, about Pepper, about the kid…
, just to keep himself a little busier, trying to distract himself from the feeling of the need to stay alert for the inevitable action, a feeling he can never erase from deep inside of him.
, and it’s filled with dirt and blood and terror, of screams and noise, of gunshots, of footsteps, of dying breaths. He knows what it sounds in the city, too. It sounds like cars crashing, windows and glass doors being broken, buildings falling,
“You’re an idiot.” Bucky tells him, and Steve has no choice but to admit that he has a point. “Just ask him out.”
The outside and the inside, the chaos of the last three days versus the bitterness that brewed slowly during the past three years, all hitting him at once, and it’s very difficult to focus, even more so when he’s in such a terrible condition.
These past years on the run, these years of sleepless nights, of unanswered calls and screaming matches, of doubts and regrets and remorse, of guilt and
Jarvis.” Maria almost sobs in relief, her eyes shiny with unshed tears. She presses her hands to her cheeks, trying to will the flush coloring her face away quickly, giving an almost inaudible sniff as she turns back to the computer. “Tony will love you. He doesn’t… He doesn’t remember, actually, because it’s not how his system works, but… But you can talk, and he’ll pick up a pattern, and then he’ll be just like before.”
“Would you rather have Build-A-Bear do it?” Tony vaguely gestures in Rocket’s direction, tired. “Everyone knows Captain America. They’ll recognize you. They need a familiar face right now.”
“Not everything is lost.” Thor replies, with unsurprising determination, but a voice that almost hovers at the edge of fury. “The Stones are mysterious. Maybe we just can’t discover their secret just yet.”
his throat tight around the words he doesn’t want to let out. His jaw does that twitchy thing again, neck muscles jumping out as if he’s hiding a flinch of pain, and just when Tony thinks he’s about to try to shift the conversation away from himself, miraculously, he says, “Mine were memories too. From before the ice. They weren’t… I wasn’t actually
Kissing Steve, he means. Well – that’s, that’s the kicker, isn’t it? Tony’s an idiot, and Steve Rogers’ even
“This was all she had left.” He says, not able to look Ms. Carter in the eyes as he does so, feeling ashamed for the way he sounds as he confides this tiny piece of the woman he, to this day, considered a part of his family, to someone who never had the chance to meet her, or her son.

“We need more people.” Tony says, mostly to himself, and rubs his hands over his eyes, aching with strain and dry as a desert. “We can’t do it all by ourselves.”
“Nothing you don’t already have.” Carter says begrudgingly, as if the lack of extra information personally offends her. “Captain Rogers has given us a run-down of the situation, and we’re going to be dividing into units to make sure we cover ground more efficiently.”
“Not that we know of. We didn’t even manage to get close enough to hit him.” Rhodey admits bitterly.
sorry I signed it, and if that’s enough for you to hate me, then you can leave right now, because I’m
“Sacrifice?” Lang chokes, forcing out a winded, humorless laugh. “Are you sure that’s necessary? I mean – the first guy is still alive, isn’t he? What’s to say we can’t do the same?”
“We do.” Rogers replies a beat too late, voice perfectly leveled, but body language extremely tight and tense. “A few more just arrived. We’re rounding on eighty people so far.”
He gets it now. Honestly, it makes an astonishing amount of sense, and maybe that’s what shocks Tony to his core, how
He pauses, and looks around for someone quickly, until he find a group standing by the left, talking between themselves in hushed, frantic tones.
“He could have killed me, but he didn’t. So he didn’t need to hurt her. All he had to do was to hurt me.” She mumbles. “She was always his favorite.”
“Hostile planet.” And then, he looks at Nebula, and finds her looking back, eyes knowing and affirming, and he knows he is right. “The same thing that happened to Titan. That’s what’s gonna happen to us.”
“I realize my husband is not an easy person to live with, Jarvis.” Maria continues, lowering her gaze. “I don’t pretend to be ignorant. Howard was harsh with Anthony, even when he was little. I still keep the circuit board he built, after he tried to destroy it when Howard didn’t react well.” She sighs, as if it pains her to say it out loud. “I was not as present as I should. Not as supportive as I could. Neither was Howard. Sometimes, Anthony was more your son that he was Howard’s, and I’ve never shown you enough gratitude for it.”
“Okay, this is too much. Time out.” Tony begs, making a stop motion with his hands. “We’re not getting anywhere with this.”
what Bucky’s thinking. He’s thinking about the glass container they put him into when he was arrested in Bucharest. He’s thinking about the heavy metal shackles and the isolation, about being helpless as Zemo invaded the place and messed with his mind. It makes Steve’s hackles rise so quickly he can feel himself building up like a giant wall, ready to plant himself between Bucky and whatever may come to hurt him. But it’s useless. It’s a memory, not a threat. It’s nothing he can stop just by using his fists.
“Iron Man, now is not the time to complain about the enemy’s work ethic.” Steve warns him, with not a single heave in his breath, though it sounds like he’s smashing his shield on a bunch of the tiny robots all at once from the noise in the background.
Tony’s teeth click together when his mouth snaps shut, feeling his neck burn with the uncomfortable sensation of both Natasha and Rhodey staring at him with too knowing eyes, and all he can say is a soft
Here they are. They are actually here. Right there, next to the sofas, right by the open doors that lead down to the workshop, U perfectly still while Dum-E turning side to side nonsensically to watch their own reflection in the cabinet’s glass door. By their feet – their wheels – there are a few tools, like a wrench and a screwdriver, that seem to have been taken directly from the workshop, possibly from Tony’s own personal set. They have no shame after all, the little idiots.
He wants to ask more, but the… the idea that just popped into his mind renders him speechless. He doesn’t know what to do with it. He doesn’t
to. Thanos’ illusions of greatness and desire for power are nothing new – maybe he can see the similarities between him and Ultron, but he can also see those in Loki, in Strucker, in Killian. They all intersect at that small piece of the diagram that guards the worst possible outcome; A fierce sense of superiority, wrapped in the insulting belief that murder is somehow doing someone a favor. Tony still remembers the way Thanos’ hand felt in his head, heavy and enormous, but so infuriatingly
“Days ago.” She finally breathes, with only the slightest hint of doubt in her voice. “The day the spaceship came. It’s been like this since then.”
Steve Rogers, and he dares to snort a laugh at the sight of Tony’s utter bafflement. “And don’t act like you didn’t have the most ridiculous crush on him when he was small, because you did, and everyone knew. This is nothing new for you.”
“Okay.” Tony exhales, a little taken aback with the direction the conversation took, not expecting Thor not to press the issue of Tony’s clearly messy state or his solitude in the workshop. If this was anyone else, Tony’s sure they would have pushed – he’d been ready to argue or distract or even
Natasha’s expression quickly morphs into something ugly, shocked and almost offended, as if Steve has just admitted to doing something completely idiotic. “You asked him for info? Why did you do that?”
, with that idea. I’d go to the Smithsonian and see the Commandos Exhibit and he was there, his picture, and all I could think was how I had failed him at the moment he needed the most. Learning he was alive… I almost couldn’t believe.”
You always talked about it, when we were younger. And I knew you could do it.” And because Tony’s mouth doesn’t know how to stay shut, he accidentally says, “And I’ve seen a show you did once. A gallery, I mean, an exhibition. The one in Boston?”
, because he’s trying to be civil, here. He’s done this before, this fight that always fall into deaf ears, because people seem determined to make it so much complicated than it actually is. To him, it’s very black and white. It’s very straight forward.
Thank you all so much for accompanying me on this journey, from the bottom of my heart. This has certainly been the most emotionally exhausting and painfully detailed character study I've ever done, not to mention that crazy word count, and I've loved every
Tony knew this would happen. He’d known. The feeling had been creeping up to him since the cave, the array of weapons with his name embezzled on the side, a mockery of his dream, of his morality, and he just hadn’t realized it yet. Hard to do so, when he was counting the days until the Ten Rings finally decided they had enough of him, until he finished the Mark I, until he was
how the mesh worked, she just guessed it based on what Tony had told her on the Benatar and what she had seen during the fight against Thanos. Did she really figure it out entirely, based only on that? Did she—
Tony exhales in deep relief, and he whispers a grateful reply, his shoulders slumping a little in response to Thor’s careful nod of recognition.
for this. If you got a problem, you tell me to my face and stop hiding behind T’Challa everytime I confront you about it.”
“Bigger. Industrial size. Maybe bigger than that, even.” Tony frantically tells them. “That’s the first thing we need.”
Lastly, I'd like to give my most sincere thanks to every single one of you who have gotten this far with me, especially to those of you who have been present in every single chapter, giving me your thoughts and opinions and headcanons, making sure I stayed motivated and reminded me
There’s a sigh, deep and resigned, a sound Tony shouldn’t be as proud to recognize so easily from Rhodey’s lips, but he does. “Alright.” Rhodey says, “I’ll be there soon. Gimme five hours.”
, the shape is different, the size is different, and Tony lets out his breath in a painfully relieved rush, sagging back against his bed – because it
But others do, of course. Eventually, they get kicked out of the Archives by Bobbi, because she wants to use the computer to watch dog videos and they’re bothering her.
Natasha scoffs. “C’mon. We both know that’s not true. Who is paying for every building we break? Who is consoling the families of the people we couldn’t save? Just because we weren’t given

She hasn’t been her usual self ever since they met inside the Raft, actually. Steve’s noticed. He knows she is not happy with their situation, but to be fair, neither is he. None of them are. They would all rather be home, training and helping people as they should, as they had done for years, with none of this Accords mess or feelings of betrayal hanging over all of their heads. They’re losing so much
They follow Wong into a long corridor, to a door. His pace is quick, rushed almost, so there isn’t much time to stop and analyze the surroundings as they follow – but it’s hard not to notice the change, because when the door opens, sand, dust, and rubble reveal themselves inside, scattered across the floor and small steps haphazardly, like an explosion has occurred in this room, irrationally large for the amount of destruction and totally contradictory to the clean environment just outside that same entrance door.
what he is asking, and that is why she hesitates before replying. “Captain Rogers has, Boss.”, she says, carefully. “So did the Black Widow, the Falcon, the Scarlet Witch and Vision.”
– I thought that too – But it all has to do with space-time continuum.” Bruce points out, eyes wild.
This chapter hurts. It hurts a lot. The next one, unfortunately, will do too, but for a different reason.
That means confront. It means threat of violence. It’s not so much the idea of a fight that scares him – even in smaller numbers, they are a group of highly skilled people, and they’ve faced worse with a lot less. The terrifying thing is the chance to cause
Tony goes to argue, almost on instinct, but the look in Natasha’s eyes catches him off guard. It hits somewhere deep inside his chest that shouldn’t be feeling as tender as it is, a shock that comes unprompted and overwhelming, sudden hopelessness at the sight of her face so open, so pleading, that sharp edge between order and supplication.
Tony is barely able to stand in his own feet. He wants to be angry about his own lazy disposition, about how tired his muscles feel or how his bones don’t seem to be strong enough to hold him up, too weak for even this simple task, but Tony knows, at least at the back of his head, that he isn’t twenty anymore; And he is without food, much water or proper sleep for over three days, and he has fought the universe’s biggest asshole during that same time period.
“You jumped inside a spaceship,” Rhodey says after they’ve finally stepped back inside the Compound, and it’s a recapitulation as much as it is a reprimand, and his crossed arms and worried brows tell Tony he’s not escaping this without a proper explanation, maybe not even then. “With no backup, no plan, and no way of communicating.”
“That’s just running away from the responsibility.” Steve argues. “We can’t just retire and pretend we don’t see the danger when it’s there. We can’t sit by and wait. I wouldn’t blame Bruce for retiring, but I don’t have to agree and tell you that’s what I should’ve done. I
Steve doesn’t have anything to say. He wants to, wants to defend himself and his choice, defend Bucky from their rant, their words that feel so much like an accusation, but his body won’t cooperate. He has no words, no logic, nothing but the dark pit inside his stomach that is growing bigger and deeper with every passing second, a black hole that will trap him forever and he will never escape.
Rocket turns his head, eyes gleaming in a conflicted expression, and to Tony’s surprise, he raises a hand and places it on Nebula’s arm, not simply touching but
“Absolutely not.” Tony insists. “I refuse to eat the cheap imitation when I can have the best Italian in the country whenever I want. C’mon. We’ll take the Quinjet.”
that grew with him and warns him at every second of the day that he should keep them all at bay, never let them get too close – this voice, from beyond the haze of Tony’s nebulous feelings, can still find the strength to tell him that
And Tony will assume it was mind-blowing, it certainly looked like it, and anything less than that would be a hit to his ego. Supersoldier stamina is no joke, and Tony
His body almost physically rejects this idea, the idea that something could ever be as painful, if not
Ross affirms with a confidence so crystal clear that is honestly kind of hard not to feel a little swept away by his conviction.
“What do you need me for?” Bruce asks raggedly, as he gets up from his spot and walks up to Tony stiffly, and Tony is suddenly very aware of the fact that all the others are
“Nothing else should have mattered.” He says, and he means it. He means it with all his heart, with all his soul, with every piece of him that still cries, still hurts with the idea what this, all of this, could have been avoided if they had just
“Is it safe?” Lang asks, visibly sweating and nervous, but Tony is already moving forward into the portal, striding with purpose, and he can hear some of them following him, recognizing at least Rhodey’s steps by the soft whirring of the exoskeleton around his legs, and Nebula’s quick and pointed steps marked by the sounds of her boots.
He’s used to feel her pressed against him like this after they’ve had sex. They don’t usually sleep in this position, because Tony got used to laying on his side to be able to sleep, the press of the case of the Reactor too heavy and too constricting for him to fall asleep on his back. To this day, it’s rare that he can sleep in any other position. The exhaustion really did him in, he realizes. She slotted herself against him in the very position she found him in, like she always did – and it’s very telling of how tired he was, that he didn’t turn during the night and he didn’t wake up at all as she settled against him.
“Yeah, I seem to remember you falling asleep on me in the middle of my traumatic tale a few years ago.” Tony pokes back, not truly bitter about it, but helpless to the urge to infuse a little bit of a reprimand into his tone. “You really have no talent for the whole therapist thing.”
“Seems like it.” Clint exhales a deep, long breath, crossing his arms in a pensive stance. “I don’t even know if Stark knows he’s here. I didn’t get the chance to ask.”
“When we were in Wakanda—” Natasha gulps. “Right before he got Vision’s stone, Wanda managed to destroy it. When he got to her, she was crying. I could hear her, from where I was. He had me trapped on the floor and I was too far away to see, but I could hear them.”
…” Natasha says, almost pleading. “Bruce would have been the same. With no protection, they would’ve been able to do whatever they wanted with him. It’s what
And that’s why he knew the sensible thing to do was to not force his presence of her any more than necessary. It was just one more argument on why leaving the active roster of the team would be such a good idea.
, but he sees the arm flung to the side and the unmoving fingers, full of dirt beneath the fingertips, and he inhales sharply and averts his gaze quickly, closing his eyes too tightly.

He sees blue hands reaching under a frail back, careful with their movement, and as she finds the right grip, the body slowly gets pulled from under the car, like it’s floating on water and being washed away by the stream. Nebula scoops the boy into her arms and stands up, and Tony watches fixedly as she walks around to the other side, walking away from him, cradling the kid with such… surprising care, tucking his head into the crook of her elbow so he’ll be comfortable and still.
“Vision.” Sam suddenly calls, and they all look at him, surprised by his sudden outburst, and Vision hesitates when he sees Sam give a dry gulp and stand up from the couch.
“But you did get it back, because you said the Stone was in nowhere.” Rocket says, and then pauses. “Wait. Did
God, I absolutely hate how the MCU just used the Accords as a way to propel a conflict with Bucky as a center piece, like he was nothing more than a mere object for which Steve and Tony are fighting over. I know the movie is entitled Captain America: Civil War, and not Avengers, but still. Bucky deserves much more development than that, let me tell you. The Accords, by themselves, bring to the table a discussion that's so damn important - and they just glossed over it for the sake of a brawl in a parking lot. Nice going, MCU, real classy.
Tony drinks in the sight of her anyway. He does it like a starving man, like he knows it’s the last chance he’ll ever get, because this is how it feels. It’s how it feels every time.
All he knows is that the mere thought of it makes his heart constrict in the most bittersweet way, a wishful thinking and a fierce desire, the so naïve expectation that T’Challa might be right. That when that day comes, Steve will realize it in the form of a long-awaited ringtone, the phone between his hands finally,
But now, he’s watching himself lose. He’s being an active participant on it. Every second he has to sit still and wait is torture, every ticking of the clock like the pressing beeping of a bomb, slowly making its way to detonation – but it never does, so its just
He can see it in his mind’s eye, how it was. How this happened. This plane came crashing down, on the middle of the day, when no one was expecting it, and it crashed on the street. The people working on the buildings to the left were probably busy, having lunch, handing in reports, just trying to make an honest living. Or maybe – maybe this was a residential area. Tony doesn’t know. He can’t see enough of the street to know. The air is filled with gray. They might’ve been residential buildings, those people might’ve been families, safe inside their homes, until something from above came and
“I’ll let you know if anything changes. Sorry, Captain, I know you worry about the Accords and all that stuff. I wish I could tell you I found the perfect solution, but I’m an engineer, not a lawyer. But I hope that if I do it first, it’ll be easier for you guys to do it too, someday.”

Steve blinks slowly for a second, allowing the silence that falls between them to swallow him whole, blocking the entire world out as he fully processes the words Scott has just said. The uneasiness is immediate. The years and years of suspicion and wariness raise their ugly heads to look over his shoulder, monsters sneering by his ears, whispering about mistrust and bad decisions.
Because there’s nothing to be proud of in failure. There’s nothing to be proud of in realizing that is his resilience that’s about to put him in a position he told himself he never would be in again.
Tony looks up, eyes stinging with unshed tears, breath heaving and heart beating fast, and he feels like the world is crushing him, swallowing him whole, like the vast universe had been, in silence, predatory, with no mercy. The sunlight stretches thin, going out like a flickering candle behind a curtain, obscured by the heavy clouds that slither closer and closer with promises of rain, with the smell of sulfur and ozone, cold wind whistling loud in his ears.
“We shouldn’t leave Earth it’s absolutely necessary.” Rogers says, in a tone that is all command and authority, which only makes the absurdity of his words even more…
Steve does step closer to the bench without even thinking about it, but he doesn’t sit, looking around nervously every few seconds.
“Right away.” FRIDAY quickly assures, and she brings in yet another projection into the room, bright, colorful flashing images blinking one after another in quick speed as she reviews the footage as fast as she can right before their eyes, in a blur of jagged motions and distorted, fast-paced sound streaming in from the speakers, muted sensibly by her before Tony even needs to ask.

“What you call Bridges, and what Rocket calls jumps, you may see them as two different forces or you may not. It doesn’t really matter. The
Though this time, T’Challa’s assessing gaze is focused completely on Natasha, and Steve looks at her discretely, trying not to make it too obvious for T’Challa how
Steve has lived through the World War II. He knows what happens when the government tries to register and classify people by a characteristic or a number. He’s seen it first hand, how the bad intentions of a leader can destroy the world, how people can so easily be led to their own demise by a pretty speech and a bunch of lies. It’s an excuse as old as time, to disguise prejudice and bigotry under the pretense of protection, exposing people to danger for simply being who they are. For doing what they think it’s right. He can’t allow that to happen. Not again, not anymore.
Rogers makes that stormy face again, the one Tony always associates with bad arguments and headaches, but he’s not having
Tony mumbles an affirmative, and leaves it at that. He doesn’t ask who else is left. He doesn’t have to.
, and he knows Rhodey feels the words deep down into his bones, because Tony feels the way his shoulders and back twitch with a sharp inhale.
. And the Stone clearly left something behind, because Vision seemed to be at least a little aware that some of Ultron was still left in him when he woke up.”
“My name is Tony. Tony Stark.” Tony offers demurely, voice breaking when it travels through his scratched throat, parched mouth and blood-stained teeth. Despite all of that, when he looks at his companion, to the blue skin of the hands that are both soft and strong at his sides, to the pitch-black eyes and the mouth twisted on a frown, he hopes it comes off gentle, even if just a little bit, because he feels like he owes this to the Guardian.
FRIDAY helpfully brings up a projection, but the text is too long to be read quickly as their anxiety demands. Tony skims through it on reflex, trying to catch key-words –
Tony sees him, and smiles. It’s casual. He says hi to Tony, Tony says hi back. He asks about how Tony’s day is going, and Tony says it’s fine, and asks the same. Again,
“I still haven’t forgotten what you did, you know.” Steve scoffs, but there is no sharpness in his voice. “Pushing me and Natasha into a fight.”
Steve follows T’Challa closely, unable to keep his uneasiness at bay, even when they arrive at the marvelous country T’Challa calls
“Cap, how is it going on your side?” Tony then asks, not being able to help the urge to multitask his worries. “I can’t see you. Thor guarding your six?”
Tony’s steps are unsteady and his body uncooperative, even if with each step he takes, his blood begins to flow with more force to his unused limbs, his lungs getting used to the odd air inside de building, his hold on Nebula’s shoulders more certain than limp by the minute. It’s like his entire being is restarting after shutting down unexpectedly, and he should feel better—
He can feel the weight of Natasha’s gaze, her laser sharp focus burning in his face, but he doesn’t raise his eyes to look at her. He can’t bring himself to do so.
When Tony got the warning that he had fallen into the lake, when he got involved with the Vulture guy behind Tony’s back, when he realized Pete had been
These pants are not even his own. His tracksuit probably was torn off when he was rushed into surgery or something, as it is nowhere in sight, but
“There was a document, proposed by the UN.” Tony tells them, voice as level and calm as he can, his eyes lowered to the floor, because for some reason, he doesn’t feel strong enough to look them in the face as he speaks. “That was designed to take us from the control of the US government and make us a response team managed by the UN, to stop or at least reduce the problems we were having with some countries.”
“You knew half of it.” Natasha muses, and Clint turns his head to look at her, curious, and they share a silent gaze that says more than entire conversations ever could, in less than a few seconds.
Steve had never wanted the to change. He could do without the ego, without the ridiculous posturing and the fighting over who knows best, of course he wouldn’t miss it; But at the same time, he
“Shit!” Nebula hisses, all her anger vanishing as pure, unveiled concern washes over her features, and she lunges in Tony’s direction a little too late to stop him from falling.
“Well, you understand.” Thor drops his hands, with a sigh of resignation. “I know you have many names for these events, but the truth is that many of those are exactly the same event, simply in different scales. The force that pulls an – an
Tony still feels his stomach churn when he remembers it. But there had been emotion, there had been something alive inside him, and now, all Tony sees before him is a husk of a man, someone who, oh
“I tried to stop it.” Tony replies mutedly, helplessly, as an apology, as an explanation, and as a plea, because he really can’t say anything else about it.
“I was aboard Thanos’ ship when he brought her in.” Nebula confesses, head still bowed low, her eyes fixed at a random point on the floor, as if she could see the memory unfolding before her eyes like it was happening to someone else, like a movie reel playing in a way only she could see. “I had snuck in days before. I tried to kill him. But the Black Order was there and they were too many, and I was captured.”

There are windows broken and belongings forgotten, it’s all a cloud of dust and blaring noise and the distant sound of burning, the whistle of the wind and his ragged breathing, and there’s – there are so many cars, and motorcycles, and an ambulance, and
Tony pauses. He doesn’t know if Bruce is referring to DC, or to New York – but Bruce had been watching from the Jet, with Nebula and Rocket, and maybe he had noticed the strong ozone smell like Tony had. Or maybe he noticed here, when he stepped out of the Jet, when Tony was too out of it to realize it.
“I was going crazy. I almost got myself killed once because I was so out of it.” Sam continues, oblivious to Steve’s mistake. “But these things
– duty to protect those who can’t. To take back what is stolen. To not accept offense against the people he holds dear.
(He pauses. He doesn’t know if Tony understands what such a pause can mean, but he feels incredibly awkward for doing it all the same.)
He will also tell her, trying to give her some amount of comfort: “We thought it would be better if we did. The safest way for Vision to find us is through you, so it’s better that we don’t be separated.”, and he hopes the suggestion that Vision will be actively looking for
Painfully common pleasantries. It sounds like the kind of bullshit Tony used to say to investors in charity balls and auctions, with plastic smiles and a too-tight handshake, to people he despised or didn’t care for at all.
“You’re not flying the armor to DC.” Natasha orders again, through gritted teeth, as she paces in heavy steps towards the elevator. “Get in the Jet.”
Yeah, sure, he’d love to talk about the genius princess of Wakanda, but now it’s not the time, is it? And the very implications that they had been in Wakanda in the first place – that is a
But he mourns anyway. He mourns Bucky, he mourns the Commandoes, he mourns the love story that will never have the chance to be. A date he won’t be able to attend. A war he won’t be able to see to the end. It hurts, so bad, but he clenches his jaw and hardens his heart as much as he can, his will strong as iron, and he pushes the controls down, as if forcing them would make it go faster, end quicker, not giving him a chance to feel pain when it crashes.
It’s the worst part about this. The whole world was screaming at us and we were too busy screaming with each other to find a way out of this mess. And he wasn’t having it, so I thought I might try with you.”
FRIDAY chips in with an agreement, but the conversation is already barreling through her voice, hasty and full of anticipation, all of them too anxious to halt the subject now.
Scott takes in a deep breath, and then he just blurts out his next words. “I’m thinking about going back and turning myself in.”
“I suppose you’ve heard the news.” Steve says, nonsensically, because of course he has. The man is a supporter of the Accords and the king of a nation who abides by them. Of course he has heard. “About Scott, surrendering. Going on trial.”

I'm not making this hard on Tony because he deserves it. On the contrary - Tony deserves so much more than what I'm about to do to him. They all do. But
Tony suspects that every single person in this room, including himself, would gladly give their life if it meant they could fix this.
“Wanda didn’t get to Tony either.” Steve mentions, but at this point, is just to show Clint he’s listening, and not to actually refute what he’s saying.
, not to permanently injure or kill any of these people, no matter how hard they are trying to hurt them. Thor swings his axe with expert precision, and Tony would scream in horror if he didn’t know the guy is skilled enough to make the thing move in just the right way and just enough strength that it won’t accidentally murder anyone. And sure enough – a few people panic, and retreat as soon as they see a large, sharp projectile flying in their direction, which is smart, but others, who are not quite so smart or not coherent enough to do anything other than charge towards the House at max speed, those get a heavy handful of wooden handle hit their legs, or the blunt, solid side of a blade, pushing them over to the floor just painfully so they won’t be tempted to get back up. Tony has his non-lethal propulsors. He fires them at their lowest setting, and even so, people are thrown into the air lightly and topple over, also a good incentive to not get back up; But the bastards are
“Is he—?” She starts, but the words fade out in a jagged edge, like a record scratching, terror hiding beneath a frail attempt of composure; the terrible, terrible anticipation, the desperate hope, the nearly hopeless question.

And when he puts it like that, he has a point. Godly father, all too powerful, probably a little too overprotective of his things? Tony can imagine Odin being the kind of guy who you hide his toys in the darkest places in the universe, in the hope no one would find them.
Steve opens his mouth to reply – probably much snappier than he should – but Shuri places down the prototypes she’d been working on atop the worktable with a little too much noise to be an accident. She gets up, decidedly, and walks closer to Bucky, and Steve feels the hairs at the back of his neck bristle a little with her move, a deep-seated instinct to
Rocket’s pain, the way it sounds in the rasp of his voice, the… weird, innocent feeling his animal face gives when contorted into sadness, but the clear awareness in his eyes and the force it takes him to even get the words past his sharp teeth; it’s all so recognizable, so
Whenever he wasn’t losing himself to the fight, the uneasiness, the pure, almost instinctual drive to keep himself working to stop his own dark thoughts, he was walking around like a ghost, visiting museums and memorials, staring at name plaques for so long his vision would get blurry. He would think about his friends growing old and dying, about Peggy moving on and having an entire life without him there, not even to cheer her on, and he would
T’Challa blinks at him. “But you think you are entitled to question me for the information about his decision.”
He tries not to feel offended when they all go suspiciously quiet, thinking his words through, the air feeling extremely uncomfortable.
“Well.” Tony sighs, rubbing a hand against his sore neck, wishing the cricks would vanish, with just a brush of his hand. God, he’s
Steve’s mind is suddenly flooded with soft, worn-out memories of Peggy, like old photographs, in muted tones and frayed at the edges, but so loved and so close to his heart that he can’t help but smile a little, a longing that never quite faded making itself known inside his chest, the marks of a love that faded, but never disappeared, and probably never will.
, and that is that. The technicalities don’t matter. And they will never matter, if all they do is to make the victims feel guilty about their circumstances.
This weird goodbye reunion they’re having in the hotel room is the reason why Natasha marches in and finds them all in the same spot, her steps heavy and hard with an intense emotion exuding from her entire posture, as if she’s vibrating out of her bones.
That time, he didn’t have to do it. Tony wasn’t a bully. He just did it, because… Because he was so on edge, so rattled with the idea that the next day might be their last day, and not only one, but
“Mr. Lang left the Compound four hours after he settled in his room with the book he selected from the collection provided by Wong. He did not say where he was headed, but he left with his suit, and informed me he would be back as soon as possible. That he only needed to
Many things to be angry about. All Tony has to do is pick one and they can fight about it. Just like the old days.
They are supposed to be on the same side. Natasha is supposed to be his friend! She is supposed to help him, to support him, to understand!
“I know.” Tony says, not allowing anything but the utmost confidence bleed into his voice. “And that’s why I’m gonna help you figure out how to do it. No one can do it better than you.”
this revelation is. Tony himself wouldn’t have known, hadn’t he read on the subject years ago, when preparing to meet Bruce for the first time in 2012. It’s wasn’t even Bruce’s field of expertise. It was just… the pink, polka-dotted elephant in every physicists’ room. “Do you know what it
He would panic, but he doesn’t think he needs to, not with Nebula. And also, Tony thinks she probably meant to give them some privacy, which Tony deeply appreciates.
“I thought you weren’t that kind of doctor.” He jabs, even though he knows it’s not fair, hoping the not so amicable reply will dissuade Bruce from prodding, taking unfair advantage of his non-confrontational nature to keep himself far away from his delicate topic.
anything that was reversed. Assuming Thanos would be the only thing in existence not reversing, he would know time went backwards, but we wouldn’t.”
It’s hard to look at bodies trapped beneath rubble, burnt, or forgotten on the street. It’s hard to look at them and see what has been lost, the opportunity, the possibility, entire lifetimes taken away in seconds, and knowing they arrived too late. It breaks the heart. It
“You could have decided on a plan during the travel.” Rocket points out, like it’s completely factual, and the despite this being the only thing he says with absolutely no sarcasm or derision whatsoever, it is the thing that makes Tony bristle like an angry cat the most. “You blamed them for actin’ with no plan, but you didn’t have one either, did you.”
Tony and Thor are still guarding the House from the gates, the crowd slowly getting back into restlessness and confusion, but no longer charging forward in a way that’s frankly scary to watch, even for a superhero. Even Tony doesn’t know how to deal with such a raw, base feeling of hate as these people are acting on, not even when he felt at his lowest and felt what he thought had been at the most profound depths of the darkness in his mind. Knowing they’ve taken a step back, he’d be lying if he said it doesn’t make him take in an easier breath, and it’s the only thing that allows him to gesture to Thor and indicate that he can leave the area and relocate to a higher advantage point if he prefers to, since Tony knows he’d much rather have the high ground, and Tony blissfully won't feel completely vulnerable being alone down here right in front of the stunned attackers.
inside Tony’s head sparks with a flare of realization, something so quick that its gone before he can properly grasp it, and it only leaves him open mouthed and awkward by the entrance, body stiff as a board, like an old man who has just glimpsed a ghost of his long gone past.
“I can, but I don’t know what will happen to the internal structure.” Tony admits, and he has to cough to ease the sudden tightness in his throat, the words that get half stuck in his esophagus when he forces them out. “Right now, it’s kind of holding my stomach together. If I remove it, the particles of the mesh recede. I’ll start bleeding again.”
“Partially.” Vision concedes. “Mr. Lang has no previous history of destruction of property in large scale, and none in international scale. And as he is also not associated with the Avengers Initiative, he has no formal obligation to be a part of international operations in the future; Which means that most of what the Sokovia Accords entail does not actually apply to him.”
Thank you all for the comments, kudos, and subscriptions during the first chapter! I'm glad you guys are excited to come on this journey with me! Let's get this party started, shall we?
but stare at him with surprise and suspicion and admiration, all jumbled together, caught off guard by his so accurate guess of the actual problem – that no one has told him about yet. “Cassie has been coughing for two days straight now. She says she can’t breathe. I just… put two and two together.”
“The Accords.” Rhodey intervenes, fearing Lang might drag himself down a hole trying to explain how exactly he came to be associated with the Avengers; which is a fair concern, with how unsure Lang seems to be with the answer. “Ant-Guy was on Cap’s side against the Accords, so he was in Leipzig too, when the fight broke.”
rational, that can be put into words and maybe said out loud, is the most stupid thing he could think of:
She’s crying. She knows she is, she can’t see the screen anymore, the world is blurry and wet and so, so overwhelming.
more important than action when it’s necessary and helping people, as if bowing down to the demands of governments is the best course of action. It might be the easiest path, but that didn’t mean it was right. In fact, it rarely is.
Rhodey’s eyes flash dangerously focused, deep concern etched into his features.  “How long has it been since you last slept?”
They all stay stiffly still, too uncomfortable to know how to react to Thor’s revelation, too scared by the idea that the guy who supposedly was the only one who could help them build a replica of Thanos’ Gauntlet had suddenly disappeared – with far too great chances of being another victim to the decimation.
Steve knows he is being analyzed, but he doesn’t cower under the king’s careful gaze. Steve did not flinch under Queen Ramonda’s silent judgment, he won’t back down for T’Challa either, even if the man is a king. He can think whatever he likes.
Tony hasn’t seen her as a villain or an enemy in a very long time. He didn’t know enough about her to know if she felt the same, but it doesn’t really matter. Not now, surely.
.” The man repeats, through a locked jaw and gritted teeth. “No one is going to come looking for us, and the House was empty when we got here. Don’t even know where the President is – he probably got vaporized like the rest of them. No one is coming back, and no one is looking for us. So if we stay here, it’s safer.”
Vision seems concerned with Steve’s silence, and he makes a motion like he’s going to lay his hand in Steve’s shoulder to console him, but the movement is halted before its even halfway through. Then, he says, his voice as gentle as it was when he whispered to Wanda when they left the apartment room together. “Don’t take this as a sign of indifference, Captain. Mr. Stark is only trying to assure that our meetings occur in the safest way possible. It is by no means a rejection.”
. Tony is curious to know what happened, but he can’t muster the courage to ask, because he doesn’t want to risk bringing up something he’ll regret, whether that something is Loki or the sister, or Asgard, or the hammer, or
to get – confirmation; But is that even possible? Can he justify this wild chase to her as anything other than a deep gut feeling of an injustice that will rob him of peace until it’s fixed? Can he put this into any word that it will be of any comfort, for her and for himself?
– in Vienna and holding back the UN and finding Rogers and Wilson, all at once, it wasn’t the best scenario to build a nice and cohesive workflow, but Tony had seen enough. Enough to trust that she is good at her job, and a good person.
The others make varying noises of confusion and wariness behind him, especially Lang, who very frightfully asks
But that gentleness has never had any place between them. Or the Avengers. Even in camaraderie, gentleness is not something that could survive within the team, apparently, like a flower dying of thirst easily as anything, even if managed to get past the seed at all. Softness doesn’t survive in battle, much less lingers long enough to be missed when it’s gone.
Perhaps he would have, if Tony hadn’t figured it out. He probably would have. But Tony knew his AI, knew his
, just a little, just a small, stolen moment of fabricated peace, that he will get to keep this. He breathes in deep, wishing she still smelled like her favorite perfume and not like smoke and anxiety, and pretends the world outside is bright in sunlight and warm like the summer. His head twitches and he resists the urge to nuzzle at her belly, knowing that the touch would give away too much, would open a fucking Pandora’s box of thoughts he’s not willing to fight through now.
useful information. As is every other piece of information T’Challa has ever granted them, actually. “And thank you for helping us do this. It’s not your responsibility to help us, and you’ve gone out of your way to do it, far more than we deserve. Thank you.”
, of all people, to sleep with, because he thinks Tony won’t try to push through his defenses at all. Tony, the playboy, Tony, the guy who was built for casual sex.
“Oh, God.” Lang’s mouth opens and closes a few times, his eyes wild, struggling to find the words until he finally settles on a muted, “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Steve had come here to say he’ll be back soon. He will get everyone else out of the Raft, and he will be back, and when Bucky’s good, when he’s

Nebula doesn’t say anything to his lousy reply. The silence stretches too far, for too long, and it feels like an eternity after FRIDAY finally picks up again and says, in a quiet voice, “Shall I continue with the report, Boss?”
“But even without JARVIS, there are registers of the components of the Stone somewhere in your files, and there are registers of its
Why else would he do it? Why would he keep Bruce locked away, if not as payback for being kept hidden like a skeleton in a closet? Why hide, when he was parading himself to this foreign world, fighting and
“I will see if there’s anything important in Mr. Stark’s medical records.” He promises. “But if there’s anything I should know beforehand, Captain, now would be a good time to say so.”
He shoves something into Steve’s hands, and Steve belatedly realizes it’s a milkshake of sorts, or maybe a smoothie, with a soft pink color and a sweet smell,
, but Lang proves himself yet again a very efficient study and doesn’t ask, keeping himself focused on the task at hand.
He really isn’t used to having a beard at all. It always took him so long to grow it out he would just shave the whole thing off, even if barefaced he would look even younger than he actually is. Steve scratches his cheek absentmindedly, annoyed, wishing the thing would just grow and reach a point where it would
“Can’t blame him, Pym is a hardass.” Tony concedes, exhaling a frustrated breath. “But I guess we know all we
“We have more pressing issues than if the Hulk is actually having problems or is just taking a nap.” Bruce smiles sardonically.
Oh, God, she can imagine him saying that. She remembers it so well. He would say thing like this to Jarvis whenever she was away for too long, too busy to give her son the attention he deserved, and she regrets it so much.
It’s jarring the sensation of stepping into a room through a portal, to leave the clean, cold, metallic smell of the workshop to enter the slightly stuffy, oak scent of the New York Sanctum, the lighting completely different and the very air in the room dustier and harder to inhale, thanks to the hole on the ceiling that so easily allows the dirt and ashes trickle in through the wind. Tony’s shoes make footprints when he walks, the ground covered in a sheen layer of ash that is scary to look at, to know what it means, and Tony avoids it firmly by keeping his eyes leveled with Wong’s, even as he steps forward and hears the others, more reluctantly, follow him through the glowing orange portal.
“We need to find Wanda and Vision.” Steve commands, and both Natasha and Sam are on their feet immediately and start to follow his lead, both of them seamlessly falling into his rhythm, ready for battle as soon as they were needed. Steve turns to Sam for a moment and tells him, with a nod, “Get the Quinjet. We’re leaving.”
“What are those things?” Lang points, to the bottom left corner where Thanos’s hand is being held down by Quill’s weird little machine. “That thing holding him down?”
of it, like this is somehow her fault, like she could ever deserve such a treatment from that bastard that dared to call himself her father. “For days. It never ended. He took me apart, piece by piece, and left me there, pulling at the parts like I was nothing but a circuit he could destroy. I… I didn’t tell him anything. He wanted to find Gamora, and I didn’t tell him how. But he found her anyway. Probably in Knowhere. He must have captured her after he got the Reality Stone.”
“Yes.” Thor admits, expression closed off. “But not just Ultron. Him, Vision, whatever is left of JARVIS, because if the Stone—”
They leave, boisterously and suddenly, and somehow, the room seems even colder when they do. The awkward silence that falls upon them after Rocket’s irritated screams fade away is somehow hollow and too overbearing, disrupting the odd back and forth they had going on, the live wire of information and tension that buzzed around the room going from person to person, like two parts of a circuit have suddenly been removed.
He didn’t use to think he would ever be able to have children, not because of physical inability but… because of everything else. Bad examples, all sort of issues and baggage, never enough willingness to compromise his objectives in favor of others’ comfort, tendencies into getting himself into more and more dangerous situations every time; Tony

“Captain, I will ask you a question in return.” T’Challa doesn’t ask, he merely informs, even if his tone amicable.
Tony is himself surprised by how easily it is to let her do it, to allow her closer, with no questioning or hesitation.
” Maria chokes, the letters jumbling together in her tongue, even when she tries to stop a sob with her hand. “You named it after him.”
Tony sits on the ground, curled up in a ball, uncaring of the presence behind him. It might as well not be there. He feels alone, he feels so utterly, completely alone, an empty body floating amidst nothingness, meaningless and small and

Rogers gives a quick head signal, almost a nod, as if to prompt Tony to speak – and Tony remembers; A silent inquiry about his abrupt call before the takeoff.
Because Tony absolutely will not be the person that brings that up to him, he averts his gaze and desperately searches for something else to focus on, feeling way too awkward and guilty to just keep staring at Thor’s mismatched eyes, so full with sadness already.
Tony nods, but doesn’t supply any more information. Not because he’s wary. He just… He doesn’t feel like talking.
“But if your guy isn’t joining us when we go after Thanos, we need to know.” Rhodey points out. “We’re gonna need to get you some equipment to give you a way to fight. The Hulkbuster is not in good shape, but we can’t let you go out there with no backup.”

Caution makes him handle his thoughts a bit more gently. Sometimes, when it’s the middle of the night and he can’t sleep, he stares into nothing and picks apart his memories, from before, from the Accords, from Wakanda, and he tries to make sense of all of it together. It’s harder than it looks like.
It’s the middle of the night and Wanda has already left for bed hours ago, and Steve knows she’s fast asleep. This will probably be the only chance he has to find Clint alone for a very long time, and he has to take it. He can't ignore this any further.
His dreams had been big, and his heart had been empty. He needed something new to create, someone new to love.
It takes him a day or two. He’s not proud of it, but… but he has no other excuse. He needed some time. He needed to think.
“More like she brought me with her.” Tony shakily replies, gesturing to Nebula behind him with a long sweep of his arm, a flourish both unnecessary but also totally unavoidable in his nervousness. “Nebula, this is Pepper, my fiancé. Pepper, this is Nebula, my…”
He’s an engineer. His hands itch for a solution, an inkling of an idea at the back of his head whispering plans and numbers in his fitful sleep, and it never stops, never lets him rest peacefully, because it’s always there teasing him about something grand and perfect, that’s always just out of his reach.
“He seemed to be fond of the place.” Thor says, extremely sorrowful for some reason. “It’s the only explanation I can think of.”
but… It’s… something. It’s something, and Tony can’t grasp it, not fast enough, and it all gets drowned in the determination of favorable results of calculations, in the pressing ticking of the clock as the crowd screams and bellows, shaking the bars, and Tony makes a split-second decision before anything worse can happen, and nods sharply.
“It’s alright.” Natasha says, her tone equally quiet, if not a little regretful. “I’m sorry too, Cap.”
He remembers telling this to Tony, once. Right after Ultron. Right after they learned that Clint had been hiding his family from them for years, even though Steve had considered them a pretty close-knit team. He said
Ultron had been emotional in a way Tony never had programmed his creations to be. JARVIS had emotions, of course, but his acting on them had been
Rogers out of the Quinjet closely, nearly side by side, as he runs forward and Tony immediately shoots up and tries to gain altitude, to analyze the situation from above, to give him visuals and decide the first course of action.
“As a self-managing hero, the only problem Mr. Lang now faces is the lack of a suit. As long as he keeps himself only inside the United States territory, there will be no further restraint over his ability to act as Ant-Man other than only being able to do so after the has the permission of Judge Talbot.”
Tony does acknowledge how dangerous it is, to pretend the ashes aren’t a huge concern, but he has to make a call. Deep inside him, he knows he’ll never be able to halt the intrinsic, almost visceral instinct to protect people, to throw all other priorities away in favor of making sure the civilians are alright – and he’s going to try that first, always, because that will always be the thought at the forefront of his mind at all times.
” Wanda argues back. “You’re just so used to pain you don’t think you should care about it anymore.”
Tony doesn’t know what to do with this amount of trust. Just like he didn’t when Thor approached him, in this same workshop, much like they are now, and told him the Stones might have left a message for him to find; Tony has no reason to believe that he knows any more than all the others, but they all seem to be
“I won’t be able to help you in this mission, Captain. It is beyond my resources, and my morals, to do such a thing.” T’Challa says after a while, almost regretfully.
Tony can fight with him – against him or beside him, whatever it’s necessary. He can do it. He can accept the fact that they’re here now, they’re back, and in the worst circumstances ever, not when they should be; But Tony can overlook all of that in favor of working together and fixing this mess and saving the world. He can do it. It’s not a problem.
But if that conversation dissolves into something else entirely, that’s also not a complete coincidence.
to him, or know what he’s thinking, not now, and not then. I have a sense of what he does sometimes, but that’s it.”
“Red.” Thor interrupts. “The Reality Stone is red. The Power Stone is purple and the Space Stone is blue.”
“They were calling for Wanda to be deported.” Tony says, pointedly. “Or worse. And don’t forget how people reacted when the Iron Legion landed on Sokovia. Do you know how many countries signed that document? 117. That’s over a
He walks away of the Stark mansion with just a computer in his hands, and nothing else. And then, he wonders if he should feel guilty if he’s carrying away with him the reason why his employer was killed in the first place.
“But every little bit helps, right?” Clint smiles, teeth sharp. “So an extra hundred doesn’t count?”
It’s in the form of a flask. A tiny one. Mr. Jarvis takes it off from the inner pocket of his jacket, fingers delicate around the glass, and she reaches for it even though she feels something inside her tremble with a phantom sensation, so quiet she can’t even be sure it was real. Something shuddering. Something grieving.
so open and present, so gentle and caring. Steve thinks it’s probably insulting how jarring he finds it, but he does. It’s so overwhelming to see Natasha so unafraid of being soft, of being simply…
Steve doesn’t care where Wanda and Vision are, all that he cares is that they find them. Steve is already thinking about their next step, the step that honesty concerns him the most – because out of all the ways he has imagined going back,
Steve risks taking a glance at her, and she looks back, seeming as lost as he feels. He huffs, trying to shake away the anxious feeling running through his veins, and he lays a hand on her shoulder, because he doesn’t know how else to comfort her.
“Where are you going?” Tony hurriedly asks, slightly concerned by her posture and demeanor, uncomfortable with the pure seriousness Nebula exudes, even with her back turned to him.
and one moment in which he actually does, which happens right after "Tony takes in a huge breath (...)" and ends with "Tony blinks confusedly (...)". You can skip it if you want to, and you can check this symbol
if it was something that happened close to the time Thor got his vision, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it was. We would have to ask the Time Stone itself to know, but that’s not happening anytime soon.”
“I don’t know exactly, he was hiding it at first.” Natasha says pensively. “Somewhere around two months ago. It’s hard to tell, it’s not always visible. I don’t know what kind of Reactor it is, because it’s not the same as the one he had, but that kind of information is very hard to find, even with the connections I have. Especially since it’s Tony we’re talking about.”
He’s far more concerned with turning to Pepper and asking, incredibly confused, “You going out there with them?”
He breathes in and out. He can taste the dust at the back of his tongue, like he swallowed a mouthful of dirt. It’s disgusting. It makes him want to puke.
Ever since the serum, Steve had been floating around humankind, but not feeling like a part of it. Responsible for it, yes. Worried for it, of course. But never quite
“He never explained why he didn’t have the shield with him when we fought Thanos.” Thor shuffles in place, shifting his weight from one foot to another, also sounding like he’s a little too helpless in this situation. Unlike Bruce, who looks alarmed, Thor just looks… confused, bemused almost, like something in Rogers’ silence saddens him. “I asked him, but he refused to speak. You were the one who had it?”
Tony had learned many lessons in his years. He learned them with Afghanistan, with Obie, with the Palladium, with Killian.
“I’ll see you later.” Pepper affirms in a whisper, her eyes locked onto his, so he cannot twist her words into anything other than what they are. A kind promise. Truth. “Okay? Call me if you need me.”
Lang has other types of association to make than the rest of them do. He wasn’t there – but he admits remembering most of the public information about 2012 and 2015 quite well, the news on the attacks of New York and Sokovia broadly spread thanks to TV and paper, as well as Natasha’s public hearing after the fall of SHIELD in late 2014. A few things he has to be brought to speed on, much like Nebula and Rocket had, but it’s surprisingly easy, considering how little he questions the existence of magic crystals with the power to level the universe and how well he already knows the Avengers, from the news over the years and… everything else. All in all, he catches up quick and seems to understand why they are bringing in so much information to the table, and promises to do what he can to help them skim through it as fast as possible.
He takes the comm out of his pocket, turning right into an alley to make sure they are out of sight of civilians, and he takes the call, a small hologram materializing into thin air above the device in his open palm.
Just kidding, no spoilers for now. If we do get to talk about it, it'll be a little further down the line, when it becomes completely unavoidable - because, you know, plot. For now, we'll keep it spoiler free; But if you do want to talk about it, my twitter and my tumblr are always open to you guys. There's actually a gigantic post there about my opinions on the movie, so if you're curious about that,
And it scarred them. It scarred them and Tony can tell, can tell in the way even Nebula, who is as fierce as they can be, who growls and snaps and refuses to bend, how even she hunches her shoulders and looks away, how her metal fingers dig into the flesh of her arm, a gesture that tells more of her discomfort than her words ever could.
Steve sighs, sounding so damn broken. “I didn’t ask him myself. But when Tony saw, he asked… Bucky told him he remembered all of them. All the victims.”
. “That would mean separating us and that’s the last thing we need now. If these Kree are dangerous, it’s best if we stay clear. They probably lost people, like we did. Getting unwanted visitors will probably not be something they’ll be happy with.”
