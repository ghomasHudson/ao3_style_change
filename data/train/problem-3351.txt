Cas rolled his eyes and put the dipper back in his pocket. "It's an actual utensil that you use with a honey jar. You dip it in the jar, twirl it, and pull it out, leaving it filled with honey. Our shop is called Honey Dipper because many glassblowers, when referring to pulling the molten glass out of the crucible, call it honey dipping. Observe."
Victor put his change in his wallet and pocket. “Doc may say that you’re fine, but do you feel fine? Looks like you got some extra weight that we could turn into muscle.”
“And I want to get back to the motel in one piece, Cas.” Dean stomped on the gas and Baby peeled out of the bar’s parking lot. He gripped the wheel tightly as Cas wrapped his arms around his shoulders and started sucking on his neck. “Cas. Believe me. I want you, too. I want to help you out. But if we wrap around a pole ‘cause you’re distracting me like this, then you’re gonna have the worst case of blue balls the world has ever seen.”
"Dean." Cas placed a finger over Dean's lips, effectively stopping him from talking. "Sam merely asked why I was in your room. Then when I said I was leaving a note, he pointed out that I obviously forgot that I was wearing your pajama pants."
“Yep. And her father? Well… we bonded over that too. Her parents were only children, and she was an only child.” Dean searched the gathered group. “I wonder what is going to happen to her daughter.” He pointed to the front row. “That’s her old man, and I’m assuming the girl is hers.”
“Not gonna take all your drinking money, dude.” Dean looked over and smiled at Cas before looking back at the guy and winking.
“It’s not a no.”
Dean groaned and threw his arm over his eyes as he laughed. “Don’t ever change, Sunshine.” He reached up and pulled Cas in for another kiss. “Don’t ever change.”
He nodded again.
Yeah. John definitely knew which buttons to press.
Cas nodded. "And it is still sitting, unanswered."
“She did it,” Cas stated quietly. “I knew she could, but I was still worried for her. For Claire.” His eyes went wide, and Dean turned to watch as Claire pulled Kaia into her arms and kissed her. “That’s a new development.”
Charlie wrapped her arms around Dean’s shoulders and hugged him tightly. “You know, Dean. It doesn’t help that you don’t really have an excuse to not go tonight. Who’d have thought we were so excited to get out of here…”
“I mean clearly. Cas still hung out with us for another couple of months after that.” She gestured for him to continue.
“I’d like to see you catch me.” Sam nodded down at Cas doing his best impression of a seatbelt.
“Hey, Cas.” Ash nodded at Dean and walked up to the counter. “So, Red and I were talking….”
"I wasn't. They're very sweet. I like to think that they look forward to when their hives are taken care of." Cas watched Dean walk past until he couldn't turn anymore. The water in the kitchen turned on, and it sounded as though Dean was washing his hands. "How did my suit fit you?"
Dean stood next to Cas as they watched Kaia make her way to the river’s edge. He wanted to move closer to the former angel, to reach for Cas’ hand and take it in his own. But, instead, he slid his hands into his pockets, willing them to be still. Dean knew it wasn’t the time. Not yet. He kept an eye on Claire, knowing that she was fighting every fiber in her being to rush down and be at Kaia’s side. And honestly? He couldn’t blame her.
“I never wanted you to stop talking to us, Cas. I wanted you in my life. And even if it took a clue by four to make me realize that your feelings were reciprocated, they always have been.” Dean rested his forehead in the crook of Cas’ neck. “I haven’t wanted anyone but you.”
at some point today."
"Your point?"
“Interesting. You know, if I may put my two cents in, I'm a contractor myself. I started as a plumber before working my way up.” The man reached into his front pocket and pulled out a business card. “Frank Devereaux,  Devereaux Home Improvements” He handed the card to Dean. Dean reviewed it, showed it to Cas, then tried to return it. “You can keep that. Speaking as a contractor? I can say that I rely upon my personal beliefs, and politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs.”
Dean schooled his face and looked over to the pair of miscreants leaning on the wall between the Quick Mart and the Rentflix. “Ash, Charlie.”
“I WAS EIGHTEEN, CHARLIE!” Dean rubbed his shoulder, wincing as he rolled it. “Damn, I’m not going to be able to use my sword arm at the next LARP.”
“Is that so?” The man took the ball and chucked it towards the water culvert that ran by the strip mall. It landed in the water and was swiftly carried away. “Ooops. I guess if there’s no ball, there’s no whatever the fuck you’re playing up there. Now. Get down here and open your fucking store!”
“Why?” Cas tilted his head in confusion, infuriating Dean in the process. “I thought you were in love with her?”
"I'm sorry, Sir. I'm listening, and I want to be good." Dean took a moment to breathe in deeply through his nose as Cas pushed his thumb inside of him. "I'm just so close to coming, and I don't want to disappoint you."
“So you can give them cancer and make their lungs look like this?” The guy pulled out his cell phone and showed it to the customer. “Do you see this? These are smoker’s lungs. This is at five years—” he swiped “—ten years—” he swiped again “—fifteen years. How long have you been smoking for?”
Now that he had finally gotten used to it, waking up without Cas next to him felt almost like the bad dream that brought them together.
Dean nodded.
4:19 PM
"No." Dean begrudgingly admitted. "But you didn't have to do this. I appreciate it, but it's an all-inclusive class. I see that you blacked out the price, but I know it couldn't have been cheap."
“So, you basically asked Cas on a date?” Charlie snickered as she asked her question. “Like, did you know he’s gay?”
Dean returned his attention to Cassie. “He is my best friend. Has been since we were kids. He knows how you fucked me up.” Dean shook his head. “Anyway, I’m still not sure what you’re asking for.”
“I do not.” Dean withered under the look Cas shot him. “Not all the time.” Dean got to the end of Lydia’s obituary. “Huh.”
“And I promise you’ll have me. Anyway you want me.” Dean crossed over to his beer, taking a sniff as he picked it up. Before it got to his lips, he stopped and took another inhale. “Shit. The siren did get you.” He found an empty glass and poured the beer into it, showing the off-color liquid. “Fuck, Cas. They got my beer. You didn’t notice and drank it. You didn’t have a chance to prepare.” He swallowed harshly as Cas stepped into his personal space again. “Cas, I promise you, let me get us back to the hotel room, and we can work this out of your system.”
“Really?” She pouted again while pushing up on her tiptoes. She hooked Dean’s chin with her thumb and finger and pulled him in closer. “What if it’s just an outing with an old friend? One you may or may not have had relations with.” Cassie brought him close enough that their lips were a hairsbreadth apart, and had Dean really wanted to, he could have closed the distance between them. “Take me to dinner, Dean. Let me show you how much I’ve missed you.”
Lisa crossed her arms over her chest. “You couldn’t trust me with that fact? You think I’d hate you?”
Sam sat at the table quietly, waiting for Dean to continue.
Dean shook his head. “That’s not it at all, Cas. I didn’t know that I could love you. And when I realized that I could, and then I did, I couldn’t get to you.” Dean closed his eyes and nuzzled into Cas’ hand. “I still love you. There will never be another person in the world who completes me like you do.”
It was Cas’ turn to tilt his head to the side. “You never saw her as anything other than a sister?”
“Honor system,” Dean called from his spot on the floor. “Unless you need cigarettes, which, oops, I’m out of for the day.” He chuckled as Lisa smacked his shoulder playfully.
“If you had just answered your phone, you would have known we just needed to know how to gank a Fomorian. We didn’t need you here!” Claire aggressively shoved her research into Dean’s chest. “It would have taken you ten minutes at most, and you could have gone back to bed!”
“Shut up,” Dean murmured as he wrapped his arms around Cas’ neck and pulled him in for a kiss. “I may not be as young as I once was, but I’ll make damn sure to keep up with you tonight, as best I can.” He ground down against Cas’ cock, already hardening inside him again. “Fuck, Cas. I know you recover quickly, but that?”
"Oh! That's the thing the bee from the Cheerios box holds!" Krissy replied, excitedly. "I thought it was just a wand or a scepter to designate him as royalty."
Dean groaned as he reached for his phone. He knew it was the asscrack-of-dawn early. He didn’t even need to open his eyes to know that. And if someone was calling that early, it could only be for one thing.
look —out of place, Cas." Dean looked around the funeral home. "We look disrespectful."
The Fomorian looked at the rest of them, standing back at— what Dean hoped was —a respectable distance. After a moment of observing, he looked at Kaia and nodded. “Find me here when you have the solution. Thank you, young Dreamwalker. May your sleep be peaceful.” With little fanfare, the creature returned to the depths of the river, and Claire rushed to Kaia’s side.
“Even though it’s obvious that he loves you, and you love him? I’d ask why you two aren’t together, but I already know the answer.” Claire stepped forward, causing Dean to pull his hand back. “You’re scared. Just like me.”
“You heard about that.” She walked up to the counter and leaned on it.
Cas chuckled, his deep voice causing Dean's cock to twitch in excitement. "Being a brat may have gotten you back here, but you won't earn your reward until you've redeemed yourself, understood?"
Cas had gotten a call on his handheld, leaving Dean by himself in the
“Cas!” Dean pulled back and cried out. He spilled over Cas’ hand, gasping for air. “Please, please, please.”
It took all of Dean’s willpower to not jump out of his seat and kiss him. He licked his lips and swallowed before slowly standing up. “You, uh… You came?”
Dean smirked and winked. "Blow me, Cas."
“You know what, Cas?” Dean stepped even closer to Cas despite knowing he shouldn’t. “You’re right. I don’t deserve anything good.”
Just as Cas sat back down, the day's paper in one hand, a pen in the other, and his foot up on the coffee table, Dean entered the living room. "Hey, Babe."
Which is why he tried desperately to get out of dinner with Sam. He knew that Sam meant well. Dean had practically raised Sam, and while Dean didn't expect anything in return, Sam insisted on giving back where he could. That included the dinner birthday party that Sam had insisted on having. Luckily, Dean had convinced Sam to have a small dinner with just the two of them and Sam's wife Eileen at their house. That guaranteed there would be no embarrassing songs from the staff, like the years prior had brought.
“Leave him alone, Victor.”
The next morning, Dean woke up to several missed calls and texts. While they were all concerned about him, they all said the same thing. His friends either knew or had a feeling that he was into dudes and that they still loved him all the same. Not ready to face them, Dean got out of bed and headed into the kitchen to make himself breakfast.
“Alright, then you left for a little bit, left your colleague Castiel in charge of the store while you were away, and in that time is when Miss Robinson entered the store.”
“It’s okay, Cas.” Dean interrupted. He wiggled a hand free and tilted Cas’ chin up for a kiss. He pulled back and smirked. “You know. I’m not supposed to be here today.”
Dean swallowed, an uncomfortable tightness growing behind his jeans. He
"You're going to be the death of me, Cas." Dean let out a moan as Cas took his cock into his mouth. "But holy shit, don't stop." Dean tangled his fingers into Cas hair, massaging the scalp while Cas worked his ministration, lavishing Dean's cock with attention. As he got close to coming, Dean pulled back on Cas' hair. "Going to come, Cas... I'm gonna...."
“You just called yourself a beard! You may not be homophobic, but you’re certainly biphobic if the first thing you thought was that!” Dean pointed to the entrance. “Get out.”
A scream pierced through the
Dean’s head bobbed in agreement. “Yeah, probably.”
[Cas, 10:00 AM]: Why is that?
“I’m not sure. Ten?” Dean watched the girl, curled up crying against Lydia’s father. “I’m a dude, and I helped raise Sam. I don’t know girls.”
“I am so fucked.”
“Are you speaking as Mrs. Moseley or Missouri right now?”
Using some sort of magical bullshit —Dean was sure of it— Cas' pout powers grew more potent. Dean found himself unable to resist the baby blues of his boyfriend. "Fine. I'll figure out a way to get in your damn suit and take care of the bees." He jabbed a finger at Cas. "But you owe me. BIG. Write out the instructions, and I'll pep myself up to face the maker tomorrow." Dean collapsed on the sofa, arms folded across his chest in his own pout, as Cas happily hummed and wrote down how to care for his bees.
“Okay, okay. So even with all of these so-called ‘independent contractors’ working on the Death Star, it still needed to be destroyed, right?”
Allowing gravity to work its magic.
“Sam says that we should be able to talk to it.” Dean exited the bathroom and stood in front of the group. “If it won’t listen to us and take the offering, we should, in theory, be able to take it out with a salt-iron blade.”
Cas chuckled, a deep throaty sound. “You assume I ever went to bed. Couldn’t sleep. Tried smoking. Tried yoga. Tried that damn ASMR stuff.” He leaned back and stretched. The edge of his shirt rose up as well, and Dean couldn’t help but stare. The fact that Cas wore clothes that were too big for him and covered up all… that? It wasn’t fair. “You alright, Dean?”
[Sam 11:03 AM]: A hunt?
"Just blowing off steam?" Sam glared at Dean. "So, you haven't been honest with him, or you haven't been honest with yourself?"
"Maybe what?" Cas took off his trenchcoat and jacket, laying them on the back of a chair, as he crossed to the bed and sat down on his side. He bent over and untied his shoes, kicking them off to the corner of the room. "Dean?"
“Good for you, Cassie,” Dean snarked, interrupting a story he couldn’t care less about. “I highly doubt you’re here to reminisce on the good old days, especially because, you know, you cheated on me.” When Cassie started to speak, Dean held up a finger. “Oh, and on top of that, I just found out
The next morning, Sam stopped in front of Dean's door. He knew that he might have crossed a line, pushing Dean to confessions and admissions he may not have been ready to share. Sam adjusted the tray he carried, careful to make sure the coffee or cereal spilled out of their respectful vessels. He knocked on the door, waiting to hear Dean yell at him or shuffle across the room. Hell, Sam half expected the sound of a boot hitting the door, followed by profanities.
He stood in a group with four other people, waiting for the instructor to arrive. A couple, Jody and Donna, were there, celebrating their third wedding anniversary together. A teen, Kevin, was there to add the lessons as padding to his college applications, and another teen, Krissy, was there because she wanted to learn the basics before learning how to make lampwork beads.
Dean shook his head.
"Sam. Did you say something?" Dean slammed his hands on the table in front of him. "What the hell did you do?"
Dean pursed his lips before taking Claire by the arm and leading her towards the door. He looked over his shoulder at Cas and Kaia. “We’ll be back. Get started on a new offering.”
“We are allowed to worry about you both.” Cas looked up from his seat at the desk, his second coffee in his hands. “We know you’re capable young women, but the ‘dad instinct’ kicked in for Dean.” He freed one hand from his cup long enough to use finger quotes before bringing the cup to his mouth for a drink.
[Cas, 10:37 AM]: You might enjoy what we have, but I'm afraid I don't.
“I’m scared!” Claire yelled. “Okay? I’m scared! I saw what Cas’ deaths did to you. I know what Kaia’s not-exactly-a-death did to me. I can’t lose her. And I don’t want her to hurt if she loses me. But you know what that’s like, don’t you? Can’t even tell Cas you love him, even though he told you first.”
[Dean, 10:01 AM]: I haven't woken up alone in a few weeks now.
“You’re a smart one.” Cas slowly walked back towards an open stall. “Beauty and brains.”
"That's good." Cas tried his best to suppress the smirk forming on his lips. "I did order it for you. And I got myself a new suit while I was at it so that we could match."
“Sorry, Dude. I really don’t remember you. I was only in my freshman year when I had my knee injury. I wasn’t able to get back to where I was.”
Cas nodded, and Dean could have sworn he felt the briefest of kisses against the crown of his head. “I know, Dean. I know. Because it’s been the same for me.” Dean felt a content sigh roll from Cas’ chest, and for a brief moment, he wondered if Missouri was somewhere in the gymnasium laughing at the pair. “Dean? Would that be okay?”
“Fucking hell. Both me and my father were here. I was in and out running errands. And I damn well didn’t sell any fucking cigarettes to a baby.” Dean dragged his hand down his face. “My dad did it.”
8:07 AM
Dean stood surprised, taking a moment to regain his thoughts. “Wait. Hold up. That’s not what we—”
“What is this?” Sam smiled and gestured at the scene in front of him. “I’m assuming you two finally talked to one another?”
"You said it yourself, Cas. You just put those applications and resumes in. They're not going to call you back in the next..." Dean looked over at the microwave before pushing Cas back and straddling his lap. "hour, or so."
“Then what did I just say, Cas?” Dean smacked the paper down again. “Cas!” His best friend was frowning, tears welling in his eyes. “Cas?”
Dean was royally fucked.
“You don’t know that.” Charlie stood up and offered her hand to Dean. “Come on, Handmaiden. I know it’s not a LARP, but I still need you by my side.”
“That makes sense, considering it should have been open over two hours ago.”
Cas wrapped his arms tightly around Dean and kissed the top of his head. "I'm just impressed by how well you were able to keep quiet. You're not exactly quiet in bed."
"Alright, that should be enough." Cas continued spinning the pole as he pulled it out of the furnace. "I'm not going to blow this. We’ll start that next week because we're going to practice this over and over today to make sure you don't drip the molten lava everywhere." He finished pulling out the blow pole, and on its end was a white-hot glob of glass.
"I know you didn't do it on purpose! And I swear, I'm sympathetic to how you're feeling. I've been in more casts than I like to count. But Babe..." Dean's shoulders dropped, and he attempted his best pout. "I can't. They're small, and they're creepy. They're crawly. I— I can't."
[Dean, 10:35 AM]: Cas?
“One and the same.” Frank pointed at Cas. “He offered a fortune. Half a mil down, the whole mil if you got it completed within two weeks. It was hard to pass up, but honestly? That was too big of a risk for me. Knowing who he is, who he’s connected to? I recommended a few names to him.”
Dean winced internally and nodded. “Yeah, that one. If you throw it up here, we can finish the period, my break will be over, and I’ll reopen the store.”
[Cas, 10:39 AM]: It's getting hard for me to maintain this casual relationship.
“Already have plans today, and I need sleep in order to keep them. So, call someone else.” Dean rolled over on his side, pulling his blanket up and over himself.
Sam shook his head. "Not this time. I have literal proof on my phone, from yours, that Cas cares about you. You're the one that's not reading it correctly."
Dean peeked over his laptop and looked at Cas. "Sunshine, I told you, we'll be okay. The severance package they gave you will float us, and I'm still working. You can sit back and take a breather."
A blush crossed Dean's cheeks, popping his freckles out. "It was fine. Just a little tight in the shoulders. It'll be good until my own suit gets here."
Despite it being fifteen years past graduation, fifteen years since his incident with Cas, things hadn’t truly changed. The cheerleaders still hung out with other cheerleaders while the football players objectified them from the food table. The goth kids were hiding in the shadows, and the band kids were hanging in the bleachers. Basically, as far as Dean could see, the cliques found themselves. No one had changed.
“To which part? ‘Cause if you’re asking if he loves you back, I think you already know the answer to that, Dean.”
“Charlie’s mentioned that a few times. She said you were there for her when she came out of the closet.”
“Uh, Cas? Did you forget?”
[Claire 2:42 AM] What?
“Dean, we’re ready!” Garth’s voice snapped Dean back to attention.
“Yeah. If you’re buying, get in line, please.” Dean turned back to Victor and Sarah. “Wait. Hold on. You knew she was cheating on me?”
Without hesitation, Cas grabbed his blowpipe and stuck it in the furnace. Dean did his damnedest to keep his eyes on Cas' face and not get any ideas from Cas' hands. However, any attempt to keep his mind from wandering was thwarted once Cas pulled the rod out from the furnace and put the blowing end to his lips.
Cas looked up at the ceiling before looking down at Ivy, “I think I know what happened to you when you were young,” he said.
She smiled and picked up the puppy it gave Stella kisses, she giggled and kissed the puppy back.
Cas rolled over and met Dean's green eyes while saying they were almost eighteen. He should at least have had a hint of what his gift should have been. It was always a worry of Cas’s that he would never figure out what he was or that he wouldn't be accepted by Dean if he did end up being ‘normal.’ Despite what the man said countless times how it didn’t matter to him either way.
“This weekend we have family dinner, everyone will be there,” Cas said, sitting down at his desk, sending a quick text to Jimmy about what he Dean had informed him.
“Not really, what happened?” Cas inquired, spotting what Dean was doing as he made himself a cup of joe. Clover explained again, while distracted by what Sam was doing on his phone, how she fell, but she was fine now. Sam smiled a bit as he scrolled, which made Clover raise a brow.
Dean brought the rod to his lips and spun the rod as he blew into it. Unlike when he filled the balloon with air, he was met with resistance. He breathed in deeply through his nose again and blew harder. The glass finally gave a little, and Dean could see it start to ooze off the tip of the rod.
“One.”
"Cas. Look at me." Dean closed his laptop and smiled, an idea starting to form. "Do you feel like you're losing control?"
"I, uh..." Dean lost his train of thought for a moment as Cas cleaned him off. "Hold on, did I want you to stop? No, not really." Dean waited until Cas climbed on the bed next to him and snuggled up as the little spoon. "Not gonna lie, that was hot."
"Which is an indication of enjoyment." Cas hooked his finger in Dean's collar and pulled him down for a kiss. "Thank you, Dean. I know you didn't want to do any of what you did today, but you did. For me. Even when you had a valid excuse of my suit not fitting you."
Once they were seated and catching their breath in the car, Dean turned and looked at Cas. “We’re so going to hell.”
Before they could go into any more detail with each other, a loud voice boomed through the workshop. "Good Evening, and welcome to Honey Dipper. My name is Castiel - you can call me Cas - and I'll be your instructor for the Beginner's Glass Working Class."
"What the hell did I get myself into!?"
He shook his head. “She was coming here to meet me… I don’t know why she had… Why she did that….” Dean drew the phrases out, trying to connect the dots in his head as to why Cassie would fuck some random guy in the bathroom.
“What are you doing?” Dean asked. “Give that ba—”
Cas rolled his head back, a thunk sounding from where it hit the chair. "I know you're scared of tiny little bees that are more terrified of you. But if you follow my instructions and put on the suit, they will not harm you. I swear. Dean, please. If their frames aren't kept clean and rotated, they can die. That's my livelihood."
“She didn’t know that at the time. And just like you? She just got you back.” Dean observed Claire closely as he chose his next words. “You know, when Jody offered to take her in, the first thing she asked was if you would be there.”
Sam looked at his cellphone. “About two, two and a half hours. You’ve been out for about three. I’m surprised you woke up on your own.”
“No.” Sam rolled his eyes and chuckled softly. “Did you think a demon was going to take you out that easily?”
Charlie’s laughter turned into a full-blown cackle. “Oh my God, and Ellen had to have thought it was a date. The only people you ever went to the Roadhouse with were me and Sam! She must have been thrilled that you brought someone new!”
Cas chuckled. "I know Sam said you misunderstood, but I wasn't expecting this level of self-doubt."
Dean shook his head and looked at Cas. “Cas, come here.” Dean waited until Cas eased his glare off the man and walked over. “Care to enlighten me?”
"And if we're... deeper into the scene? Then what?"
“That much was obvious. What happened after I left?” Cas walked back around the counter and handed Dean his keys. “What did Cassie do?”
“Don’t threaten me with a good time, Cas.” Dean took Cas’ cock in hand and lined himself up before slowly sliding down onto it. “Fuck, Cas.” Dean held himself in place as he adjusted to the shape and heft stretching him. “You feel so good.”
Dean nodded as Cas stepped away with the rod, breaking the glass on the end into what must have been the mistake box. He came back and handed it to Dean. "Again."
"You were so good for me, Boy. I want to hear you. Need to hear you." Cas gripped Dean's hips harshly. "I want to hear you cry out my name."
“It’s a pleasure, Cas. I know I was just pickin’ on Dean, but it’s nice to see him use the table. That’s what it’s here for.” Dean felt heat coloring his cheeks, but he wasn’t sure why. “I know what Dean wants. What would you like?”
Dean turned his head and saw Cas meditating. “Dumbass.” He attempted to take a deep breath before he started coughing. “What the hell?”
Dean smiled at Cas' question. "Still green, Sir. Just excited to find out what you have in store for me."
Dean refused to budge and laughed. “Whatever you need to say to help you sleep at night. Besides, you jumped right into bed with Cole while with me. I must not have been that good.”
After several more attempts, including one where Cas had Dean flip the tube, rotating the molten glass over their heads, Cas took a step back from Dean. Despite the temperature of the room around him, Dean instantly felt cold and wanted Cas back. He looked over to Cas, who crossed his arms over his chest, smirking.
“You’re not poisoned…” Cas looked over to Dean’s opponent before storming over and pressing two fingers against the man’s temple. “And you are not a siren.”
[Dean 2:54 AM] Try me.
“Not any more than it would usually be rocked.” Cas picked up his books and slid them into his backpack. “I’m the baby, and my mother doesn’t let me forget it.”
Sam sat down and signed as he spoke, making sure to translate for Dean as well. "Charlie said that when she dragged your ass to the Ren Faire this summer, you were fascinated by the Glassblowing stall. So the three of us chipped in, paid for you to go to a local shop and enjoy their beginner's classes."
Garth gave Dean a stern look, which strangely startled Dean. He sat back and allowed Garth to put the mask on him, as Garth explained. "Your tooth is cracked. Between that and the fact that it's not a tooth that just falls out, I need to remove it. Luckily, you're my last patient of the day, so I'll just do it now."
“Or you mean I was your beard?”
“Two.”
knew that Alistair was into that?” Lisa squared her shoulders. “Third, who are you to judge who I’ve given head to?”
Well, everyone except Cas.
“Dammit. Should have known I was being suckered.” Dean’s opponent kicked at the leg of the table as Dean sunk the eight ball in the called corner pocket. “You lost that first game too easily.” The man pulled out his wallet and threw the extra cash on the table before Dean handed him back a twenty.
Cas merely hummed in acknowledgment, and he slid his thumb in and out of Dean.
Dean nodded, not trusting his voice. With Cas' guidance, he cleared the glass off the end and started fresh.
“Yeah. And I lost two of my favorite knives to the river.”
Claire narrowed her eyes as she looked from Cas to Dean to Kaia. “I hate you all.”
"Dammit, Cas. Now you're just being cruel." Dean reached next to him and turned the stove off. "You want me to burn down the apartment?"
“Yeah.” Cas nodded and unlocked the door. “I just really hope you like your surprise.” He opened the door, took Dean’s hand, and pulled him inside. “Mom and Dad are out of town.”
“She better.” Dean winked and closed the trunk. “Let’s help the girls get this over with.”
it out." Cas winked at Dean. "A honey dipper, which is also what our shop is named after, is one of these." He pulled a glass honey dipper out of his pocket and showed it to Krissy and Kevin.
"Wouldn't dream of it, Dean." Sam pointed to Cas. "I'm just glad you listened to me and didn't push him away like I thought you would."
“Cas, you alright?” Dean dropped the act as swiftly as Cas had and leaned into his hand. “What’s wrong, Sunshine?”
“I swear it. He has one of those practice exams this morning, and he’ll be there right after.” John sounded relieved - and strangely thankful - something that Dean could count on maybe one hand. “Thank you, Dean. I promise. Log your times. You’ll get the time and a half for today.”
“And if you sell me any more of that skunked-out shit, I will kick your ass, Ash.”
“We’re well aware, Dean.” Cas’ reply caused Dean to snap to attention. “Did you seriously not hear me come in?”
Sam picked his own phone up. "Bet me."
“It’s me, Sammy.”
"Have I been reading this wrong?" He pointed between himself and Dean. "Because if I have, I apologize profusely. I'll switch, you can work with—"
“Yep. She’s in the bathroom.” Cas looked up at the clock. “She’s been in there for a while, though.”
Dean shook his head. "I still think you're wrong." He slid his phone into his pocket and finished off the second glass of whiskey. "Any milk runs nearby?"
"I can." Cas crossed to the coffee pot and made himself a mug. "After the shock wore off, Charlie was acting like she won the lottery. Crying out how she knew it and that there was no way you could hide that from her. Benny asked who your boyfriend was, and she admitted she had no idea." He took a sip of his coffee. "Garth was extremely regretful and was adamant that he wouldn't tell anyone how he figured out that you like to
No fucking way!” Cas stood, mouth agape, fascinated with the story.
Dean stared at the door in complete and utter disbelief.
“For everything.” Dean gave him a friendly salute before heading off to the Impala.
Castiel at least had the decency not to comment as Dean gestured for him to follow.
Dean hung his head. “I’m sure I’m gonna hear it.”
Dean shook his head as he tried to slide his key into the lock that secured the metal shutter in place. “Dad’s not here, and as long as you two don’t drag me or the shop into any kind of shit with the cops, I don’t care. Fuck!” Dean cursed and again tried to insert the key into the lock. “What the hell?”
Cas raised his chin defiantly before taking off his shoes and suit jacket. He laid it with his trench before moving to the open space on the bed next to Dean. Cas sat down, tucking his legs into a cross-legged position. “I’ll be okay here, Sam.”
Dean let out a sigh and reached into his pocket. He grabbed his keys and tossed them to Cas.
“Dean Winchester, your daddy mess with your head that badly? What kind of example are you setting for Sam?” There it was. Mrs. Moseley was no longer Mrs. Moseley. She was Missouri, next-door neighbor and kindest woman Dean had ever met.
“Yeah, well, the midterm happened…”
“Well,” Cas pushed himself up on his hands and knees, a sly smirk across his lips. “Think the rack is tight enough for a good break? I need to make sure I can sink in properly.”
Dean spit out the water he had started to sip before staring at Garth in surprise. "I'm sorry. What did you just say?"
Sam jumped off of the bed and leaned over Dean. “No, you’re not.” He grabbed onto Cas’ shoulder and shook it. “Cas. Cas!”
Dean stood in the doorway, staring after her. “Try not to suck any dicks as you head to the studio! God forbid you find number thirty-eight!” A man who had been buying weed from Ash looked over at Dean before looking in the direction Lisa walked off in. He shoved the money in Ash’s hand, grabbed his weed, and took after Lisa. “HEY! GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE!”
Dean rolled his eyes again, almost sure he could actually see his brain this time around.
“Well then, you’re in some trouble.” The interloper stole a look at Dean and smirked as he swiped on his phone. “This is twenty years.”
“You’re full of shit.”
The anti-tobacco asshat turned his attention to Dean, causing the crowd to turn to Dean as well. “So you want these people to die? Admit it! You get more money on a pack of cigarettes than you do on a pack of Chewlies!” He pointed to a pack of gum on a lower rack. “That’s why only you can access the cigarettes, but anyone can swipe a pack of gum!”
Dean pulled Cas into his arms and hugged him tightly. “Just because you didn’t need to hear it? Doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to.” He pulled back enough to look Cas in the eyes and smiled when he found them looking for him. “I love you, Cas.”
Dean made quick work of the remaining hives, repeating the actions from the first hive. He was almost sad that he had gotten through the work so fast.
"That was never my intent, Dean. I meant that I can't continue this as a casual relationship." Cas tugged on Dean's hand and pulled him into his arms. "I meant that I need you to know that I love you. That I don't want to be just a fling that hides in the bedroom, waiting until we know the hallway is clear."
“I can’t. I think she has ties to the Yakuza or something.”
“You hid it from me! That’s the problem!”
"No, Cas. Just grab a seat." Dean waited until Cas was curled up on the couch before opening the door. "Hey, Garth. What's up?"
“No one has touched me or kissed me, Dean. Only you.” He rocked his hips against Dean, pulling another quiet moan from him. “I disposed of her then came right out to you. To find you flirting with your opponent.”
“Perhaps we already do.” Desiree stared up at Cas. “Perhaps he was our target all along. My partner is a sucker for the macho-man type. Says the false bravado and testosterone make the suffering that much sweeter.” She licked her lips, a failed attempt at seduction, before continuing. “Are you sure you don’t want to try my kiss? Let your pretty little human kill you while blissed out?”
“You’re beautiful, Dean,” Cas whispered against Dean’s skin, shooting sparks down his body. “I’ve never thought in a million years that I would be able to have you like this.”
“It’s okay if you come quickly, Dean. I want to know how good I make you feel.” Cas rested his head on Dean’s shoulder. His breaths were short and erratic, much like Dean’s own. Their hips started rocking together in tandem, the two of them rushing to push the other over the edge. “Dean. Dean, come for me. Please.”
“You alright, Cas?”
"I know those fuzzy little assholes mean a lot to you." Dean blushed again, causing Cas's smile to broaden. "So, I guess that makes them a part of you, and I love you. All of you."
“I wasn’t even supposed to be here today!” Dean slammed his fist on the counter. “If I hadn’t been here… FUCK!” He practically collapsed on top of the counter, folding his arms under his head while hiding his face. “I’m supposed to be with Lisa. Not know about Snowballing. Not know about being the thirty-seventh dick. Lydia’s supposed to be alive. Cassie should be getting married. Everything’s fucked because I came to fucking work today!” The bell over the door rang, barely audible to Dean. “I’m not supposed to admit I love Cas.”
Dean.
"Garth..." Dean started to reply as the gas began to work. "You're reminding me why I hate the dentist."
"As long as I can remember," Dean added. "Please don't share with the group?"
"On a Sunday?"
“I got the siren. But she said she wasn’t working alone,” Cas leaned in and whispered against Dean’s ear. “I thought that your opponent…”
“Really? But, Cas? You got into Boston and Stanford, among others! You can leave Kansas!”
“You’re probably the only one who thinks that.” Dean looked up at Lisa and frowned. “Hell, Sammy thinks I’m no better than this life.”
Cas’ face twisted in concern. “No.”
"Yeah, well, that's Gabe for you." Dean ran his fingers through his hair. "So, you gonna keep me in suspense, or are you going to show me the suits?"
“Uh, I think so. I don’t remember my exact hours.” Dean rolled his eyes and returned his focus to the original conversation. “Cole? She cheated on me with Cole? For how long?”
Sam watched as the demon got the drop on Dean. His brother had been up his own ass again, watching Cas, as though the angel were the only thing worth watching in the world. What he had expected was for Dean to curse, turn around, and slam the demon-killing knife into the demon’s chest. Dean collapsing to the ground in a heap was the last thing he thought he was going to see.
But most of all, if Cas knew that Dean loved him… Did Cas love him in return?
Cas looked as though he was ready to yell at Dean when he reeled his emotions back in. “Call your team, see if they’ll practice on the roof. You can close down the store for an hour for your lunch.”
[Dean 2:36 AM] We’re already texting.
"You have no idea." Cas grabbed Dean's ass, cupping each cheek with a hand. "You are not allowed to come, Dean. Your punishment for being bratty is that your orgasm belongs to me." Cas kneaded his fingers into the muscle pulling a moan from Dean's lips. "Understood?"
“No!” Dean shook his head fervently. “The only person I knew that was out of the closet back then was you, and you even stayed hidden in the back of the wardrobe until we got to KU.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “I was honestly bored and hungry. I didn’t think more of it!”
"What did I say about being bratty?" Cas' thumb pressed up against Dean, and it took all of Dean's willpower not to push back on it.
Once Cas made his way between Dean’s legs, he stood up and pulled down on Dean’s jeans and underwear, releasing his throbbing cock from where it had been locked away. Uncaring about the fabric tangled around Dean’s ankles and the shoes still on his feet, Cas focused his mouth on Dean’s inner thigh, biting and sucking until a deep rouge mark appeared. “You are mine.”
The warm breath and moist movement lavishing his hole felt incredible, and Dean suddenly found himself regretting the terms of his punishment. "Sir, if you keep that up, you're going to make me come."
“Dammit, Cas!” Dean sputtered, his cock straining against his jeans. “Stop talking, or I will crash.”
Dean crawled up the bed and sat next to Cas, mimicking his position.
“Yeah, that’s a lie. For at least one of the people in the room.” Dean crossed his arms over his chest and gave Claire a knowing look. Both ladies turned bright red and refused to look at the other.
“Well, Cas, I… uh…” Dean lost his train of thought as Cas pressed up against him and took aim at one of the random balls on the table. “Cas, you know how to play. That’s not the cueball.”
"Donna and Jody at bench one."
“Again, Dean? You have always had a tendency to overthink things.” Cas folded his hands on the table. “Why did you panic?”
10:57 AM
“I never said that.”
friend?” Cassie’s eyes took on a mischievous look. “Can’t I just want to see you?”
“Her viewing is today.” Dean pulled out his cell and looked at the time. “Fuck. There’s only like an hour left.”
"What I see is you complaining that he let you sleep in so he could go do angel stuff, and then him saying that he wants more." Sam's phone went off, and he checked the text message from Eileen. She replied that she had come to the same conclusion. "Dude, even Eileen, who doesn't have the context I have..." He turned his phone so Dean could read it.
“That’s cheating, Cas. Are you truly catching me if you poof into the room?” Dean let out a cry of both surprise and arousal as Cas climbed on top of him and yanked him out of his shirt.
“Ok, tell Benny hi,” Ivy said.
Dean pulled up to the garage and spotted Fergus Crowley’s car. The man most likely seeing how the restorations were going. Dean parked, got out of his car, and headed into the office to clock in. he hoped no one was in there, but unfortunately, Crowley and Bobby were waiting for him.
Dean sighed as the warmth of his drink filled him; he looked over at Cas, who was reading the book he had brought with him; he could see Cas looking at him out of the corner of his eye.
Cas seemed like a nice guy, not like the last one trying to make Ivy talk and tried to use shock therapy. Dean was in charge of Ivy’s care since they turned eighteen. Their dad signed everything over to Dean and disappeared. There was no way they were strapping her to a table and shocking her brain; Cas was good looking a little bit shorter than Dean. Messy dark hair and a small amount of scruff on his face. Dean called the number back might as well. He didn't have to work tomorrow, and he always visited and stayed all day on those days.
The next morning Stella had a doctor's appointment to check her hearing, and Dean had to go to daycare alone. He was sad because they always did everything together. Dean was happy to see Benny and Charlie were already there, setting up the blocks for them to play.
“Cut it out. No vibrating right now,” Dean commanded, throwing the covers back and swinging his legs over the bed.
Castiel followed Dean down the hall and into the bedroom. “Would you like me to remove my clothing now? I can show you some of my features if you would like,” he asked.
“Nah, I just like the way you look, Sir,” Dean replied, a smirk on his face, “Maybe, it's been a while since I have had a drink.”
A slight look of wonder in Jack’s eyes and then nothing as the man took his final breath. Dean turned his head away, his eyes landing on his sister, standing in the doorway. She had tears in her eyes, it was always hard for her when someone passed.
Cas looked at Jimmy he shook his head, “their Daddy isn’t a very nice man, so they take it out on everyone else,” Cas replied handing Dean more food, “I’m sorry he said that to you, but it is their loss not wanting to be friends with you and Stella.”
“When did you get here?” Dean asked as they all made their way inside.
“Take a picture,” Meg said, smiling at Cas as he watched Dean walk away.
“Good boy, you with me?” Cas asked, kissing Dean's face.
‘What's wrong?” Harper asked, looking at her brother.
Dean was humming on his way up the elevator. He was excited he did have to deal with Crowley anymore. The part came he can pick up his car tomorrow. No more long days at the garage until the next restoration comes in, but that will be awhile.
Dean sighed, “why are you like this?” He asked.
“I win,” Dean proclaimed.
“Will we see him again? I know Stella got attached, and then we never saw him again,” Dean said, looking at the photo.
Jimmy smiled down at Stella who made a grumpy face at him, he kissed her face making her laugh a bit, but she was still mad folding her arms she had a hard time hiding her smile.
"Because I wanted to do something with you alone," Cas said, smiling.
“I have something for you, come on,” Ash said, waving him to follow.
”Stella doesn't like bath time, ” Dean piped up about it, telling them that they were always too rough with her during bath time, so she doesn't like it.
A  huge medium size crate was sitting in the living room. Stella looked at Jimmy; her eyes wide, she was sacred; he was sending her away.
“I can fix that for you, if you would like,” Clover spoke nonchalantly while handing Sam his phone. Sam made a face. He took his phone back, telling her not yet. He needed to figure out how to get her on his side before removing the boyfriend from the picture.
As they pulled into the park, Dean and Stella, both got excited, pointing to different things and clapping. Cas got the twins out of the car while Jimmy grabbed what they needed from the back.
“I didn't ditch you; I simply forgot to tell you I was leaving,” Cas defended with a small chuckle. He flipped the collar up on his leather jacket with one hand as he rushed across the street to the cafe. He listened as Charlie rattled on about how it wasn't safe to not tell her where he was going or that he was leaving. Cas told her he was sorry and he would get better, at the very least, by sending her a text to let her know what was going on. He heard Charlie sigh into the phone, saying fine, she would talk to him later.
Dean finished his nice long shower. Getting out, he wrapped a towel around his waist and headed into his room. The smell of bacon filled the air, he smiled at the thought of having the bot there to make him meals and clean up while he was at work. Then maybe, just maybe, eventually work his way up to having sex with him but for now, breakfast.
"Why didn't you tell us? I thought she was ignoring us this whole time," Cas said.
Cas covered his laugh, watching them interact; he could tell they were teasing. It was nice to see; it had been years since he and one of his brothers talked; today was special with Gabriel.
He felt his throat closing up when his eyes landed on the body before him. Feeling the prickling of tears as they slid down his cheek. He knelt, more like fell onto his knees, his attention looking down at the body that was the love of his life. Laying there, lifeless with blood trickling out of the corner of his lips. Dean took a shaky breath as another tear slipped down his cheek.
Cas was getting everything into the car when Jimmy brought the twins out to the car. Cas smiled at Dean when he picked him up placing Dean in his car seat, Jimmy doing the same with Stella who seemed to like being in the car she was looking around she smiled at Dean.
“Are you sure? I can stay to make you something to eat?” Alfie offered not to know what to do to help his friend but judging by his appearance, Cas didn't look like he felt too well.
“Leave him alone,” Dean warned, pointing at his sister. Clover stuck her tongue out while walking around him to sit next to Cas at the table, watching Dean hesitantly folding up the paper bag. He glanced at her as she fiddled with the burner phone that he gave her, feeling slightly bad that he made Clover leave her real phone.
“It's ok, take your time,” Cas said standing up walking around his desk when Ivy took a breath and signed for a pen. When he handed her the paper she hesitated before writing, pulling away when Dean leaned over to see what she was writing.
"So cool," Dean said, circling the car, "Daddy, I'm hungry."
Ivy shook her head uncurled and got off the bed, she went into the bathroom and closed the door hoping Cas would leave and she would have to talk to him about anything. When she was down washing up, she opened the door Cas was still sitting on her bed. He smiled at her and patted the bed next to him.
Dean went on about she wasn't going to anything, and there was nothing that the Angel could do; he stood Harper and Sam followed. Dean tossed some money on the table, telling her it was for the pie as they walked out.
``This should be great,” Karen said, stepping on the gas.
“Daddy, who is this?” Dean asked, pointing to the pictures.
Dean Winchester was everything Cas wanted in an Omega. He was small, feminine, and smart. His pretty green eyes and freckles stood out against the milky white skin. He was getting hard thinking about how much he would love to bury himself deep in Dean and never let anyone else touch him ever again. Luckily, Cas had learned to control his scent. Otherwise, the whole room would reek of Alpha arousal, and he couldn’t have that even if he could smell Dean.
"Give her time," Cas said once everyone was in the car.
“It's all new to me, and now I'm meeting kings and queens, royalty,” Cas shook his head, covering a smile, “It's amazing and overwhelming. This place is beautiful and…” he gushed as they walked up to the doors he was so deep in his thoughts and talking he did even notice they were already at their room.
Mitch took a deep breath the stench of annoyed Alpha filled the room, making the Omegas uncomfortable.
It looked like the date he had made the night before: same messy ebony hair, the suit, and trench coat. Part of Dean wanted to know if it had the same blue eyes that he had picked out. Now all he had to do was figure out how to turn it on. He noticed a tag hanging around the robot’s neck, he slowly reached out for the paper, scared it was going to turn on and grab his arm. He quickly grabbed it and pulled his arm back close to his body for safety. He breathed a sigh of relief when he got no reaction.
”Do you have a favorite animal?” Jimmy asked more to Dean but was looking at Stella.
"No, but Doc called the other day I made an appointment for her to go in he felt something in her neck wants to check it out, make sure it's nothing serious," Jimmy replied watching his baby start getting sleepy, and he knew she would want to cuddle soon.
“Come, Cas’ office now,” Meg said, point to the doctor's door.
“Dean, you will be ok. It’s fun you get to play with the other kids and do arts and crafts you'll see,” Cas said as Jimmy opened the door.
“She had nightmares last night that could be why she is tired, and all the excitement today,” Cas replied standing up and stretching.
“Sorry, Castiel Novak, I'm the new doctor,” he replied, shaking Dean's hand. He couldn't meet Dean's eye. Cas couldn't believe he froze like that when Dean introduced himself. There was no way he was getting over that embarrassment anytime soon.
“That's the guest bathroom,” Dean said, pointing to the door on the right, “Through there is Salem’s room,” he pointed to the door with an “S” on it not too far from the bathroom. Dean continued to show Cas the other three rooms, one of which was a game room they used when it started to get too cold to play poker on the deck or if it rained. “This is my room,” Dean said as he finished the tour.
Cas ran a hand through his messy hair, “They are pittens. How long have they been eighteen?” he said, pointing at Dean and his sister.
“I know how it looks, trust me when I say the last time I tried to help Blue, she ended up with a broken leg,” Dean stopped walking and looked at Cas, “I am working my hardest to get Blue, and I out of here.” He dropped Cas’s and walked away.
Stella wasn't doing that great she was having a hard time stacking them on top of each other.
“I few questions, follow me,” Henry said, waving his hand for the boys to follow.
“Ivy, darlin time to wake up” Benny said hiding a bouquet of flowers, she groaned, “Come on little sister, let me see them pretty green eyes.”
Clover’s lips raised in a small smile, mumbling about how she was just worried that Cas would betray them. Just like the one who shall not be named. Dean chuckled under his breath and told her not to worry; besides, she knew all the fun ways to get rid of a body if they needed to. Cas listened, a scary feeling settling in his chest and surprisingly turned on that Dean was ruthless and cared deeply for his sister.
Jimmy looked away and sighed, “Don't get pissed,” he said, “I just found out.”
“Uh, thanks,” Dean replied, looking at Castiel standing there in the buff cooking.
“Thanks Cas, I'll see you late,r” Dean said turning to walk through the double door to the elevator.
“I'm so glad you are ok. I was so worried; we haven't heard from you in two days,” Alfie informed Cas walking further into the apartment, before turning to look at the older man.
Cas watched as his brother's face fell; his heart for his brother was sure Blue didn't mean it the way Gabe thought, but it was still hard to watch. Blue turned and smiled brightly at the boys; Cas was taken back at her beauty, “You look like a princess,” Dean said, interrupting Cas’s thoughts.
“I love you,” Dean murmured, turning his head and placing a kiss over Cas’ heart.
“Hello, Dean. I made you a meal,” Castiel said, holding up the plate of food.
“Nothing to see, go back to what y’all were doing,” Benny said, waving his hand in the air to get them to continue on about their business. “I'm bringing you real food next time, how's a bacon cheeseburger sound?”
Finally called looking over everything and having it explained along with Tylenol and Ibuprofen for Stellas fever they left. Jimmy said he wanted to give Stella both after dinner and make sure she was clean before putting the cream on.
“What did you do to her?” Dean asked, checking for a pulse.
Ivy walked back down the hall with Roy she was different she barely looked up when she stopped in front of Dean as he talked to her. She didn't even get upset when he said he was leaving she just walked away and took her seat by the window. Dean looked a bit sad, he blamed himself, if he had gotten up on time he would have been here to stop what happened.
“I'm sorry, Ash would leave her alone,” Cas said looking up from behind his computer.
He sighed as the boy finally removed his panties to spread his ass cheeks, letting the slick slowly leak out and make everything shiny. He growled as the person on the screen ran a finger up and down his crack. Stopping to make a show by rubbing a finger on his pink hole.
The swing creaked under Cas’ weight when he sat down as Dean told him not to worry, that their dad had reinforced it. Especially with three rowdy kids running around. He wanted to make sure no one got hurt. Cas nodded, taking the beer Dean was handing him as he talked.
”She is a little bit shy, ” Jimmy said, petting her head, making sure she was alright before starting with Mr. Adler's request.
“Can't wait to meet him,” Sam stated, making a face at the bacon plate. “Don't you have a vegetarian option?” he asked after he sat down.
“Hello, Dean ’ Cas said with a bit of surprise.
Ash grabbed him by the arm. Jimmy turned and looked at him, a warning on the tip of his tongue to let him go.
“We have work for you, both of you,” Castiel said before disappearing.
“Are you kidding me?” he asked.
Cas picked up his phone and started to dial Dean's number and then hung up. He needed to figure out a way to break the news to him first.
“Hey Dean-O, they are in Ivy’s room,” Meg replied, answering his question before he asked.
“Cas, I'm not going to send you back, I promise,” Dean said, after hearing a touch of sadness in the bot’s voice.
“Hi, what's up?” Cas asked setting his pen down.
"You look at me, why did you ignore me?" Jimmy yelled.
Dean turned and looked at the Alpha, he smiled and nodded, saying he was heading home now. Cas nodded and smiled, replying to email if he needed anything. The student nodded and continued his way out the door.
“I will see you at home,” Cas said; they had worked out a schedule; it was easier now that Dean didn't work at the bar; he still picked up the occasional shift at the Cafe when Benny needed him too.
“Oh, sorry,” John's voice rang out, interrupting the men.
He sighed and turned his computer on, setting up his glasses before getting started. He made sure he had everything he needed. It had been a while since he had gotten laid or had time to watch porn, and with the garage adding in the restorations, he was double booked the last six months. He had finally finished the last car he was going to treat himself tonight.
They were greeted by a squeal and Blue running full speed towards slamming into Dean before turning her attention to Cas.
Dean rubbed his eyes, looking up at Cas, he smiled and patted his lap. Dean smiled and climbed up.
A loud booming woke Dean up at six in the morning on his day off. He grumbled about how it better be good as he opened the front door. He was greeted by a delivery man shoving a clipboard in his face while telling him where to sign.
“I thought you and Dean would be happy to be back with Sam,” Karen said, joining her on the couch.
Dean sighed, taking his sister's hand gently to get a better look at her wrist, “Come on, we can figure this out after we get Sam,” he said, letting go of her hand.
“Metallica, it keeps me calm,” Dean replied, not opening his eyes until the flight attendant came on over the loudspeaker with the in-flight instructions.
Dean shrugged off his flannel lifted shirt sleeve revealing a large branded handprint on his bicep. Harper pulled up the sleeve of her jacket, revealing the brand on her wrist.
“No, thanks. Sit back down, relax, watch some TV,” Dean replied, trying not to sound too much like he wanted the bot to sit next to him.
“You know you want it,” Ash said, shaking it at him.
“Yeah, it would, thanks, doc,” he said, leaving Cas’s office.
Stella tilted her head and looked at him, Dean sighed and repeated when he said adding in the signs, Stella nodded understanding it wasn't safe for her to go off alone, but she couldn't help it she liked to look at stuff.
“Hello Dean, um,, Ivy had an incident after you left,” Cas responded with a sigh.
Jimmy answers the call Becky was talking a mile a minute Jimmy said he would come down to see what was going on.
She nodded and pointed to the door. Jimmy noticed she was looking like a small child with the thumb and pointer finger out.
“I'm sorry, Clover. I opened my mouth before I knew anything. Will you forgive me?” Cas asked, moving closer to the girl.
“Hey I brought you a present,” Dean said holding up the bag she made grabby hands at him.
“Thanks for the update, can you put a rush on the parts? I'm not trying to rush, but I need to have it ready,” Crowley replied.
“Good Morning, Jimmy,” Cas answered sweetly.
The old, dilapidated building sat at the end of the street. A tall chain-link fence encased the front yard extending down each side of the smaller wooden railings of the neighbors before wrapping around the back. The grass was green and well taken care of, the garden was always lush with flowers.
Chuck nodded and replied with a wave; his mother did the same, telling him to make sure he was on time for once. Cas laughed as he headed out of the room, rushing up the steps to grab his jacket before heading out. As he made his way back downstairs, he spotted Dean and his sister making their way back into the dining room. He hung back for a moment to make sure they didn't see him. Calling for another ride, he waited outside for the driver to come while rocking back and forth on his heels; he didn't hear the door open.
“Please, come in have a seat,” Cas said, pointing to the chairs.
“So-um-Clover... That was unexpected,” Cas commented as he opened his beer and took a sip.
Andrea was hanging up the phone as Jimmy walked to his office and Cas to his tell Dean they would all eat lunch together.
Stella started signing and pointing at Jimmy. Dean already knew what she was upset about but translated the best he could, without getting in trouble.
“He had garden gifts,” Dean answered when Cas hesitated.
Cas was amazed by everything around him; his whole life, he never felt like he belonged, and nowhere in this magical place, he found a home. He was startled when he felt a hand on his shoulder pulling him from his thoughts. He was greeted by a young-looking man with a gentle smile.
“Shit, it's me!” he yelled again, holding his hands up after wiping the whiskey off his face.
“Ivy that's so good,” Cas said turing his attention to his patient.
”The bear is Stellas. She came in with it, ” Becky said, taking the other half from Bela, ”time out both of you.”
He took a deep breath and typed in that he was ready. The Omega asked if there was anything specific he like the Alpha said, not the moment he could do as he pleased.
“Do you know what they are about?” Cas asked; he was sure if some asked, they would have made a note in her file about it, but he didn't see anything.
Cas gripped the steering wheel, tightening his hands until his knuckles were white. This was the last thing he wanted to do, family dinner. He had to cancel his plans with Dean; his mother wouldn't stop nagging him, saying whatever it was couldn't be more important than his family. She was constantly nagging him about finding a nice person to settle down with and start building a family. He shook his head at the memory of the last dinner he went to. His mother was trying to hook him up with one of her friend's sons who had just come out.
“Ivy can I have some?” Dean asked. She handed the pie to him so he could have some too, she pointed to her wrist; even though Meg told her he was going to be late, she wasn't going to let it go.
"Where were you going?" Jimmy yelled, shaking Stella a bit.
Cas sat up and shrugged his shirt off, revealing the beautifully tanned skin beneath. Dean moved his hips in an attempt to get Cas to do something, anything! The Alpha smiled down at the little Omega and asked what he wanted. He leaned down to trail kisses down the side of the boy's exposed neck while slipping a hand under the sweater, running it up his body, making Dean moan and buck his hips.
“Dr. Novak said it was fine, she's finally communicating. You’d know that is you actually checked in” Meg said running down the hall to get Ivy.
“I took it, the glass broke. I'm getting it reframed,” Cas said smiling. It was the least he could and this way he could replace the frame with plastic on it was safer for everyone.
"I will make it up to you, I promise," Jimmy said, wiping away her tears with his thumb.
“Shut up, they are coming,” Blue said, grabbing Gabe's hand for comfort.
TRIGGER WARNING ABOUT ABUSE INJURIES.
She smiled and waved bye followed Meg out, who turned back to Cas. “I'll be down in a minute,” Meg said to Ivy with a nod. Ivy made her way down th hall, making sure she was out of earshot. Meg looked at Cas. “She never does that, ever she's been here nine years, and you are the first to get her to laugh other than Dean,” she said, excitement in her voice; this was a big step for Ivy.
, and they didn't want to make it
“I'm, I'm gonna,” Dean bit out.
“I'm gonna go,” the girl said, grabbing her clothes and pulling them on, holding her things.
“I know I had to go across town to get her favorite, and I called ahead of time to let Ivy know,” Dean replied, holding up a pie.
You know what? Fuck you and Sam for leaving me!! I hate you both! I hate that I hate you!
“Bull shit, you are hung over. What is going on?” Bobby replied, grabbing Dean's shoulder making him look at him.
“Yeah, Blue must have taken him to help her, but bouns they are with grandpa, and that means dads going to have to answer for what he has done to Blue,” Dean replied, taking his shirt off and tossing it to the side.
“What does she talk about?’ Cas asked. He was curious, especially with the way Marv was talking. There had to be more to it.
”Ok, I promise, ” Dean replied he looked up at his sister snuggled in her alpha's arms, ”up, Daddy.”
No one said anything as Cas headed up to his old bedroom, where he usually kept some clothes, just in case. He pushed open the door, walking in and closing the door behind him while he took off his jacket. Tossing it onto the king-size bed that sat in the middle of the room, he made his way to the bathroom to hop in the shower, figuring he should be somewhat presentable to meet his future mate. Turning the shower on, he made his way back to toss the clothes from the night before onto the bed, making a mental note to remember to take him back with him after all this. He grabbed a tattered band tee and ripped jeans from the drawer, knowing full well his father would have something to say.
Dean was playing with blocks when Jimmy and Stella came in, Dea was excited to show his sister all the cool stuff they could play with, she smiled at him.
Yep. His father.
tongue - any blood left in his brain had evacuated down to between his legs.
“You’re counting this as one?” Cas raised an eyebrow as he traced kisses along Dean’s jaw.
“Hey, at least remember he came to his senses, and you’re getting a sister-in-law.” Charlie rested her head on his shoulder. “Enough about Eileen, though, as much as I adore her. You explained Cas joined the friend group, but not what happened.”
Claire barked out a laugh. “And you believed him?”
—and raised his arms like a preacher on Sunday. “Friends, let me tell you about another group of hate mongers who were just following orders! Nazis! And they practically killed off all the Jews on the planet, just like the cigarette companies are trying to eradicate you!”
"Perfect. I won't interrupt further. After you." Balthazar walked over to bench one and joined Jody and Donna, who had been giggling at his antics.
It was Dean’s turn to glare. Not that Cas was looking at him. “My life’s going to explode? My boring, day-in, day-out life? What the fuck is going to explode in my life? Hell, an explosion would be welcome in my life right now.” Dean waited for a response. “You ignoring me now, Cas?”
“Like you don’t?” Cas gestured around the shop. “The only difference is you give a shit.” Cas chuckled to himself then shot a salute at Dean. “I’ll be back later. If I’m not back before you eat lunch, three minutes on the lasagna.”
A small whine definitely escaped Dean as he pulled the blowpipe out of the furnace. Molten glass was gathered on the end, and Dean had a small amount of pride along with all the other emotions and feelings growing inside him.
“I need you to show me that you’re mine.” Cas took a step back, and Dean took the opportunity to slip out from between him and the table. “Dean…”
“Sam needs to be able to leave. I can make do. Uncle Bobby’s got a job for me at the garage once I graduate.”
Dean's jaw dropped. "They were shaking cause I had a tail, Cas! A tail has to wag!"
A switch flipped back on inside of Dean. The silence he had been fighting to maintain was broken, and within moments he was cursing and crying out, begging for Cas to let him come.
A muffled woman’s voice sounded over the line. John must have covered the phone, as the conversation was cut off. After a moment, he spoke again.
“Do you know what that something is, or are you still trying to figure it out?” Dean looked up from his spot on the floor where he was working on inventory. “I mean, Luke blew up the first one because it was the right thing to do. While Lando is, at best, a morally ambiguous character, he knew what the first Death Star could do. The second Death Star was going to be just as bad, if not worse.”
Lisa reached under the counter and grabbed her purse. “You’re being a fucking ass, Dean.”
"Your suit didn't fit, and I didn't want to let you down. They felt similar, and..." Cas interrupted Dean by taking his hand and pulling him closer. "Cas?"
“Jesus fucking Christ, Cas!” Dean quickly wrapped his arms around Cas’ shoulders to keep him from leaving. “It was always part of the plan to have victory sex with you. That’s the best part of our hunts together. And while I’m not happy you got whammied with some kind of sex-craze spell, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like this possessive, manhandling side of you.” Once sure Cas wasn’t trying to pull away, Dean sat up and tugged at Cas’ pants. “Now, I believe you were about to do something?”
Dean ran his fingers along the fabric, sighing at the beekeeper's suit lying next to him and taunting him. He dreaded going to face Cas and letting him know that he couldn't do it. Dean closed his eyes and laid back on the bed, the suit still in hand. He continued running the fabric over his skin when a memory jolted through his brain. Dean bolted up and ran to the closet. He dug through the boxes he hadn't gotten around to unpacking, smiling when he found the one he needed. Dean brought it out and opened it, feeling the material of the outfit inside. The smile on his face broadened. While slightly embarrassing, he had his solution.
“Yes?”
“Stop, Cas. I’m fine!” Dean reached for Cas’ hand and slapped at it, the motion barely doing anything. “You need your grace.”
Dean continued to blow, his jaw starting to hurt from the continued motion. After several more blows, Cas stepped in and took the rod from him. While the glass was still hot, it was starting to cool, and Dean could the odd oblong shape he had created. Without thinking, he commented, "It looks like a bad sex toy."
10:25 AM
"He doesn't want to keep the relationship, Sam. Cas says it right there." Dean pointed at his phone.
“I wasn’t trying to boost your ego, Dean. Just didn’t want to take away from your win. You needed the win.” Cas handed Dean his test back. “So, I was thinking. I know we usually go to the Roadhouse on Thursdays, but maybe we could go somewhere else tonight, my treat?”
“Cas, I have read this book at least twice a year for the past ten years. I know it like the back of my hand.” Dean huffed as Cas quizzed him for the hundredth time. “It was a book of Proust that Sal knew belonged to Dean.”
[Dean 2:51 AM] Coordinates now, or I’m telling Jody.
Listening to Charlie, her words confirming that his heart sat clearly visible on his sleeve? Everything made sense. Now Dean knew why John got uptight when Cas was around. It was no secret that John Winchester was a homophobe, and he had made it clear what would happen if Sam or Dean had come out as some kind of queer. So Dean put on the false bravado and machismo that was expected of him. And since he never said that he was gay, John left him alone.
“Over here,” a voice called from the middle of the stacks.
“Hey Ruby, how are you today?” Dean asked making polite conversation.
“T...T,” she said with a huff and tried again “th...th.”
“Maybe you should be nicer to her,’ Dean mumbled as he refilled the pot for tea water.
“I got it,” Dean reassured his sister before walking over to her to hug her. He turned away to reach into the man’s body, removing the man’s soul, and sending it to the proper final resting place.
On the morning of their eighteenth birthday, the man who ran the facility, which never checked in on them after taking over for his father, said they were going to be sent to live with the new Alphas. Stella's eyes got wide; she didn't talk, but she understood what things meant.
Jimmy kissed Stellas cheek before she laid her head on his shoulder. She smiled behind her pacifier. He smiled back.
”Hang on, sweetheart I gotta get you changed, you are soaked, ” Jimmy said with a chuckle laying Stella down on the changing table.
“It's ok if you like it, it's soft,” Dean said, making his way over to the bed, he never wanted to make Ivy feel weird for liking something.
Dean looked over at Stella, who was looking around the room and got excited when she saw the stuffed animals pointing, trying to get Jimmy to look.
“Don't you start. You’re supposed to be on my side. Where’s Cas?” Clover replied all in one breath in an attempt to take the focus off herself.
Salem smiled, bouncing a bit in her chair as she continued eating her food, leaning over when the red-head sitting next to her whispered something Cas couldn't catch in her ear. Dean tapped him on the leg, getting his attention. When he turned, his mouth went dry. He knew Dean was beautiful, but it still took his breath away every time Cas looked at the man up close.
Dean and Benny had been best friends since they were 11 they were in the same group home together, Dean was small for his age, so Benny watched out for him. They did everything together Benny was Dean's first guy he ever had feelings for they did occasionally hook up now and again. Still, it never went any further than that, Benny loved Ivy she was like a sister to him, he visited when he could bring her flowers and little gifts for her room.
“Stella doesn’t talk. No one took the time to teach her beside her brother. She does point or will hand you things that she wants,” Jimmy said, setting Stella down she stood close to him looking around the room.
“Ivy if you don't stop I'm gonna leave and I won't come back for a whole day,” Dean threatened pointing at her.
“Have her bought back out,” Cas said “I’m so sorry Dean.”
“Dean are you there?” Cas asked, his voice was distant to Dean as it pulled him from his thoughts it must not have been the first time Cas called out his name.
Jimmy shook his head and kissed Stellas cheek, setting her down, he walked to the crate and opened the door. A little silver puppy trotted out sniffing the air; it had on a little yellow vest that said "In Training" on it.
Dean took Stella by the hand so she wouldn't wander off like she does when no one is looking.
“Sorry,” the staff mumbled, following Cas and Dean into the kitchen.
“Hello, Sir,” Dean replied, getting the bags from the trunk.
“Uh...” Dean replied, dumbfounded by what was going on but also kind of turned on.
”I'm sorry, all done sweetheart, I have jammies for you, ” Jimmy smiled, slipping her foot in, sitting her up and zipping it.
“It's cool, I tag along tonight?’ Benny asked looking round to see if anyone needed him.
"Well, she's mad cuz you kissed the maid. Stella thinks you don't want her," Dean said, looking back at Jimmy.
It didn't take too long for Cas and Jo to find in rocking back and forth on the bathroom floor. Cas told Jo to go look after everyone else he wanted to speak with Ivy alone.
"Ok, she thinks you are mad at her, she got scared," Elle said, looking down a Stella.
Harper and Sam were ready, as the waitress taunted Dean telling lying was a sin and to mind his tone she would drag him and his sister back to Heaven herself, Sam and Harper went to make a move Dean put his hand up there was something about the way the waitress said it that caught Dean's attention, he smirked.
“I want this,” Dean whispered; it was barely audible, but Cas heard him.
“I don’t….. she's just a kid…” Dean started to say when a knock on the door interrupted him.
"How long are you going to ignore me?" Jimmy asked.
”I want to see her rash, ” he said, sounding mad.
Jimmy walked back down to Ivy’s room. She did warn him that he could get hurt, but how the hell did he know about Jimmy's addiction? This place had to be bugged; Ivy was still asleep; he slipped back into bed with her.
Ivy stood up and grabbed the box off of Cas’s desk knowing that “Sir” would get upset if she didn't keep it with her. She hated this hopeless and helpless feeling but she would do everything to keep Dean safe.
Jimmy sighed and gently moved away from Ivy. She shifted and rolled over, pulling her pillow closer.
“Gabriel, this is Dean, my boyfriend, and Sub,” Cas said, introducing him.
“Ok how is Ivy?” Cas asked, he didn't want to hover around the patients, but there wasn't a hold lot for him to do during the day once he was done with his rounds and everyone's sessions.
“Are you sure you said the spell, right?” Dean annoyed that the thing had shown up yet.
A more massive black couch offset the white walls and tan carpeting.
“She's still out of it, but she seems ok,” Meg said when Dean asked about Ivy.
“Don't worry, Cas, you'll figure it out,” Dean said encouragingly as they laid in the sun in the back garden.
“Can I go?’ Jimmy asked. Now that Cas knew it wasn't him who had drugs, he was worried that he would wake up without him there.
Cas pushed the Omegas legs up more so Dean's ass was flush with his cock, pressing hard and aching inside his pants. The Omega gasped as Cas’s other hand and made its way around to his slick soaked hole.
Stella looked up at Becky, grabbed her pacifier, and followed Becky to the changing table. Cole made sure no one was looking and took Stellas to bear heading back over to where Bela was showing her.
“Mm, felt amazing,” Dean mumbled.
“Hey, what did I do?” Dean asked, rubbing his jaw.
Stella threw her hands up and turned around, waited, and tapping her foot. Jimmy came back with Dean, who looked like he didn't want to be a part of what was going on between the two of them. Dean tapped Stella on the shoulder and said her name getting her to turn around.
“No!” Salem shouted, looking at Sam, who looked like he was going to pounce on her.
"It's Belle," Jimmy said.
Dean shook his head. He didn't know what the handprint was from, but they were going to find out. Pamela placed her hand on Dean's biceps and the other on Harper's wrist telling everyone to join hands before repeating, “I call, conjure, and command you to show me your face.”
“You know the rules,” Dean said, leaning down so she could kiss him on the cheek; it was something she didn't mind, so Dean took it as a win. He never forced her. If she shook her head, he would shrug and say ok. “Thank you.” He handing Ivy the pie to carry as they followed Anna to Cas’s office, Ivy looked at Dean when they stopped in front of Cas’s office door as Anna knocked.
She seemed to have forgiven him a little bit, and Jimmy was going to take that he knew Stella was still upset and what he did hurt her grave, but he would consider her letting him help over being pushed away or Cas doing it any day.
“Don't tease your brother,” Naomi Novak said as she walked into the room. The woman had as much warmth as an icicle.
Arranged marriages weren't uncommon; they figured it would be Michael or Gabriel who would be married off. Not them. Cas had already informed Chuck of his feelings on this. Quite vocal about the whole thing for a month after the announcement but with the threat of cutting him off completely. Cas gave up complaining to his father about the whole thing; Jimmy was the only one he could talk to now. He figured if they didn't get along, Dean could go off and do as he pleased, and Cas could continue about his business. He was happy to just know that Dean was just as unhappy about this as Cas was.
