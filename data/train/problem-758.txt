The trio had ridden all day and into the night, stopping only once for a brief campfire at dusk to indulge in a meal of dried meat and bread and a shared skin of ale.
"Yeah." Lestrade said. "Forensics apparently had a bit of a time getting him up off the rails. Seems his clothes melted to his skin. I suppose that's gonna happen when you get cooked alive by about 600 volts."
"Yes. Well," Sherlock lowers his head again, "I had to ensure that you remained hydrated while you were ill...while at the same time ensuring that you continued to be under the effects of the ethylene glycol. It seemed the most expedient method for both needs."
He stared fixedly at the vasoline-coloured agar, which bloomed brightly with large yellow colonies, willing the sight to prod loose this dark feeling like a rotten tooth.
John had barely cleared the threshold before his legs gave out in sheer shock. It was only at the last moment that he was able to hide his outright collapse as a graceless fall to his knees. The carapace of his armour clattering raucously around him.
Dr. Sipe cleared his throat and broke them apart and Sherlock only fell back once he was assured John had been sufficiently calmed. His hand giving a reassuring squeeze before drifting back to the margins of John's awareness.
the reference to a purple sky is the color of smoke they use to signal to the helicopters for pickup in real life.
"So I rather suspect that a much more pressing concern for you right now is how you might possibly extend your life for as long as you can. Given your rather advanced age in league with this disease, I've calculated that you have approximately six more months to live..."
But there was nothing. And it incensed him most that Jim Moriarty, a psychopath who had trussed up innocent people, John included, in explosives, all in the name of some sick game that he had orchestrated for Sherlock to solve, had seemingly vanished into thin air.
It took Sherlock a long while to regain his composure as well, for he stood there like a statue staring at the place that John's face had vacated and tried to understand what he had just heard.
"Of course I do." John assured him, his dark blue eyes all that Sherlock saw. The naked awe in them. The way his little pink tongue darted out in the midst of his graying beard to wet his lips and leave them invitingly shiny. "It's extraordinary. You're extraordinary."
He could feel the exaggerated bulge of Charles' overly stuffed codpiece pressing into the back of his thigh and knew of the firm flesh that was beginning to grow inside. He could always tell by the way Charles' breathing pattern changed. Became more throaty.
Knows why the previous victims had been missing random organs. Not for profit on the red market. Not for keepsakes or collections.
"They look pissed." John muttered. Meeting Anderson's glare with positive indifference as the two men made their descent.
"Hey!" John sprang up from the bed when he finally did notice with a surprising bout of energy, descending upon Sherlock in two steps. But Sherlock was quicker and held the book up at full arm's reach, well out of John's grasp. Safe again, he continued to flip through blank pages until he found a column of careful writing towards the back.
Sherlock subsided without protest. "Yes doctor." He unshouldered his coat and jacket, revealing a sky blue dress shirt impressively tucked into his black trousers and hefted himself gracefully up sideways onto the table length. Long legs dangling over the edge.
Sherlock pecked softly at the pocket behind John's jaw, pressing against the pulse point and felt it hammering strongly beneath his featherlight breaths. He walked his lips down the slide of John's sternocleidomastoid, licking into his suprasternal notch and scraping his teeth out across the high wire of John's clavicle.
Prince Sherlock's breath caught just as suddenly as John's had upon entering the room and seeing him standing there.
He startles a bit when Sherlock's hand presses against the small of his back. It's the first time since they're conversation at Bart's that Sherlock has touched him so softly. Everything from Buckingham Palace to the hospital until now had been helpful, necessary, strategic, but not soft. And it makes John's heart peel a bit more as to why it's so hesitantly offered.
"What? NO! Absolutely not!" John barked and instinctively pushed Sherlock by the small of his back deeper into the crush, away from the man. He steered him all the way to the side where they popped out by the wall where there was the remotest alley of space to stand. "Sherlock!"
Wasting no time, knowing anticipation seemed to be worst than the actual act, Sherlock licked again, longer this time, with more applied in both pressure and amount and John gave another aborted sound that cracked that mouth just a little bit open as his chin canted up sharply. Making progress.
But John only sighed and scrubbed his hand down his face as if in reset. This had always been and was always going to be his decision: "I'm not going to read it because it's none of my business, Sherlock. I didn't ask for it. And when or /if/ any of it becomes my business, I'm sure you'll let me know. I don't need a bloody folder to know who you are or why you are what you are. You are you. And no amount of paperwork is going to make or break my opinion about you."
Sherlock surfaced with a pained gasp, breathing panickally from the shocking cold. "Stay clear! There's something down here!" He twisted this way and that, flinging wild sprays of water from his hands and hair. He slogged a few paces forward, dropped to his knees with a horrible squelch, and shuffled like a raccoon with searching hands beneath the brown water. Great puffs of hoary breath clouded out from his mouth. "Here! There's a body!" He held his hand stiffly beneath the water, marking the place as the first of the reluctant officers stepped into the frigid water at Lestrade's pointed nod in that direction.
Sherlock's hands stopped chopping the air and he turned, considering her truly for the first time now that she had something important to contribute. "Interesting..."
John sipped at his tea and chewed slowly, feeling suddenly silly halving the little butty when he could shove the whole thing into his mouth in one go. But he knew his manners. So he shifted uncomfortably some more and flexed the pained crackle out of his left fingers as inconspicuously as he could. He didn't enjoy feeling so unmoored, though there were a lot of things about his new life here that he was learning that he would simply have to grow accustomed to.
"Well?" Sherlock asked impatiently, if not a little worriedly, when he was met with silence. "John?"
Sherlock took a step towards John at this, sliding back into eyes that were so ignited, they practically gave off their own luminescence. "So then why would you even consider denying yourself your most base, biological urge to my proposal when I will hold no prejudice against you? When I am completely aware of what you have endured and will not subject you to derision because of it? I'm trying to offer to you exactly what it is that /you/ need to remain happy.
Sherlock was pushing up onto his feet soon after, completely ignoring his drink and placing his hand gently onto John's shoulder. "I feel like a bit of a wander, David. Have a dance maybe. Coming?" He kept his voice casual.
His back was tilted partially towards the camera with his arm wrapped around John's neck, revealing the dark, striated half of an irezumi body suit tattooed from his neck clear down to his ankle. The menacing icon of a Bhuddist guardian deity was quick to spark Sherlock's esoteric recognition. The icon on the man's back was recognizable by its mismatched fangs and flaming sword.
John's horse shuffled uncomfortably in place, snorting, feeling John's uneasiness flow from him in waves. He pulled the reigns taut and patted her neck, in an effort to both quiet himself and her.
Sherlock wastes no time with a return greeting. "Did you bring what I asked?" He demands, shouldering his way past Mycroft with John still cradled against him. John's face has gone ashen from the walk and he's beginning to tremble with shock. His feet have resorted to sliding against the ground instead of being able to lift into a full step.
It broke out onto the edge of the Forest, before banking up sharp and climbing the sudden stone face of the cliff that rose a hundred feet upwards. Up to where the natural rock sloped back into a man-made batter. Startlingly gray against the rich black of the earth. Hewn from foreign stone.
"You are! You're bloody jealous!" John let out a sharp bark of laughter. "Of /that/ guy? Oh that is--"
The thrush hopped out onto the limb of its tree and called out to its neighbors. Receiving little response. For the morning was far too early.
He tucked the blanket he'd stolen from the back of the couch more tightly around his shoulders and burrowed down like an angry turtle. "Go on then."
And as if he'd found the key, the right combination; John's most private area began to unfurl before him.
"Hm?" His breath is hot against John's neck. His arm slung low across John's belly. The entirety of him wholly enveloping.
He kept his eyes fixed upon the door until the meek woman left through it with the flask half full in her hand. The door closed solidly behind her.
And John obeyed, against every fiber of his being. Knowing that what was going on now was something entirely beyond his comprehension.
Clearly, something malevolent was coalescing, like a thunder head rolling in, and they were all about to be privy to its vicious beauty.
"I've just remembered something." He lies, but takes his time to stop and speak with her. Because this may well be the very last time he will get the chance. "I need to step out for a bit. Call me if Sherlock comes back, yeah?"
"Sherlock?" John prompted, finally coming out into the sitting room with his own coffee in hand, ready to face the conundrum head-on. "Why you've brought so much bacteria into the flat?"
"Jeremy Brett and David Burke." Sherlock said smoothly, producing from his inner pocket two plastic cards and handing them over for inspection. Along with two twenty pound notes. When the man handed him only the cards back, it was with a satisfied but otherwise barely moved air. Taking the dog, he walked back to a nondescript door and knocked twice.
Sherlock was hanging out the gaping maw of the window like a psychotic buccaneer, indifferent to the billowing smoke of his breath. "If you truly wanted to make yourself useful John Watson. You'd bring me back a good old fashioned murder!"
"What about him?" John asks as he looks down. His eyesight is swimming raucously with pain and worry and tears, but he can still see that the Union Jack neck man is sprawled boneless on the carpet. Arms and legs loose as though he's been snipped at all his joints. His exhumed eyeball is resting next to his mouth and there's a halo of wet scarlet dying the carpet dark beneath his head.
The question surprised him and John turned his head, looking at Sherlock from the corner of his eye to answer somewhat shyly. "No."
John peeled off his gloves, wadded up the sterile paper and stepped away from Sherlock, satisfied with his work. "So...which one swung the axe?"
But there is a loud slurping in answer and John looks over to find his own come being lapped out of Sherlock's palm. John's mouth drops open to witness it. He must have caught it when John had orgasmed and is now licking it out from between his fingers with a soft pink tongue.
"Maybe it's a metaphor? For what you mean to him." Mrs. Hudson suggested while making a decision between a bag of semi sweet and a bag of milk chocolate chips. Eventually she decided on both. They'd studied the rock only briefly before leaving, not knowing what to make out of it. It was about the size of a potato and completely unremarkable.
"Being shot is certainly a life altering thing. But for you, John, it was worse. Much worse. To be specifically shot in such a place as to put an end to everything in your life that you had worked for. Effectively negating the pursuit of your military and medical careers simultaneously. It /killed you/, metaphorically and almost physically. You came back to London a broken man. Absolutely wrecked. After all, you couldn't even stand on your own two feet properly.
She had been trying to help with the blueing of John's armour (a process used to slow the steel's rusting), but had been taken ransom by the little red calf who had sat down across her lap and had demanded to be petted.
Sherlock was lost in his own deduction, chasing threads and mending snags to bring the whole terrible tapestry back together. Bringing to light what had remained for a long while a very shrouded day. And he was completely oblivious to the way it was tearing John apart.
There was the heart, of course, uncloaked from the lungs, the shelf of diaphragm, the ruddy, lopsided mass of the liver, the stomach, the tongue-shaped pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, the flayed duodenum of the small intestine, the kidney--hang on.
He smirked as he found John staring unabashadly at him, hands frozen in the midst of sliding loose buttons, still besocked. "Do you require assistance?" He asked with a cocked eyebrow and sprang when John only nodded in reply.
Noticeably, the delicate flesh of Sherlock's cock had begun to lose its hardness, but John refused to worry, chalking it up to nerves.
"Facilitates regurgitation. Now go upstairs and check the floor for opals. You've only seven minutes to catch the train." He dropped his hand back over his face like a queen dismissing a servant.
Sherlock said nothing, staring at his mobile intently. John's eyes flicked back and forth from Sherlock to the television, waiting for something to happen. Some sort of clue.
oh yes. the piece that Sherlock plays later in the chapter is Sibelius' Violin Concerto in D minor [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujHJSzATQQ ] which is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE piece of classical music ever in the history of the planet. but also, since I tried to write my description of it being played in time with the actual music, i've listened to it so much i'm sick of it. but hopefully if you're in a curious mood you can follow along and figure out each part as I described it and it's new enough to you that you'll hear its beauty...
"You've no need, John." Sherlock spoke calmly, as if this was all secondhand information. "You've already made your guilt for leaving quite evident, you don't need to apologize." He seemed to know exactly what he was thinking and how he felt. "I still don't understand how you consider yourself to be responsible for the building across the street exploding /in your absence/. It's not as though you laid the bomb yourself."
But what John's professional eyes locked onto most pointedly was the gruesome, almost cartoonish cinch and swell of the young man's midsection. In combination to the crying woman and the double-decker bus, it left a pretty good guess as to what had been the cause of his death. Even if the results seemed impossible to believe.
But it wasn't something he thought had been noticeable. He could only see it himself when he opened his mouth very wide and pried back his cheek, but then, Sherlock's method of deduction barely stopped short of X-ray vision, so he supposed it shouldn't have been that much of a surprise.
"No no no. I don't want just one. Only one of your kidneys was the original bet, remember? Right before you made the fool mistake of doubling down with a bluff. And you nearly got away with it, until you saw I had a straight flush.
"It's quite alright Mr. Watson. You'll be totally conscious the entire time, you just simply won't have a care in the world. If you'll take a seat here." John took off his coat and handed it to Sherlock before sitting in the offered dental chair, looking over the tray of equipment skeptically before Ygritte clipped a paper bib across his chest. "So it says here that we're fixing a chipped tooth? Your second premolar on the left side?"
Lestrade suddenly looked helpless for a moment, like the world could come crashing down around his ears, speaking more to John's empathy. "I need this job. I've been at it for too long now to try and learn something new. Old dogs and all that...so I'm asking you guys as a friend if you'll do this for me. If you could both keep your heads down and not cause any trouble, ESPECIALLY you Sherlock, I'll let you stay and help out on the case. Alright?"
"Anyway. From there I was lead by a foot man to a private dining area where I was to be a participant in a poker game with three other guests. Two men and a woman."
"I located it when we were kissing just now." Sherlock said coolly, his face a smooth blade of composure as they made it out into the hall. And John snorted in disbelief. That's why he'd been so tenacious with his kissing. The bastard.
"Explain? Explain!" John exploded. "Explain why there's a fucking GOOSE in my FUCKING ROOM!" He fake laughed, a menacing noise that was high and tight. "Oh yeah. This ought to be a fucking riot! Putting one over on me, is that it?"
At John's instruction, Sherlock gently rolled the head onto its face and held it there, exposing the underside to the daylight and letting John get a closer look. This close to the water, the cold was burning his eyes and he had to blink multiple times to get them to clear properly. He leaned in even closer, trying to see as best he could.
"Alright, now that everyone's present and accounted for, can we please get on with it?" Lestrade urged, directing his words toward Sherlock the most.
Nimble fingers peeled down his jeans and pants as one, loosing the dark blonde thatch beneath his navel and the delicate flushing flesh of his prick, which lay docile against his thigh. At the draft of cool air, John gasped.
It wasn't /unheard/ of for Sherlock to make tea for him. On the couple of occasions that he had actually done it, it had waned at being not steeped nearly enough to rise above the taste of hot water, or waxed on clearly having been left abandoned with a tea bag disintegrating to bits inside it and only remembered to be given over sometime later.
So it certainly wasn't an impossibility. But it was a bit strange that he would be making it for John now...
Sherlock hummed and wandered away a bit, taking up a large tome that John had not noticed resting at the foot of the well-made four-posted bed.
"I will gather you every morning before sunrise and take you to your chambers every night after sunset. I hold the only key to this door and I will be the only one to use it.
The second portrait was of the High Steward seated in a throne. Depicted twice the size as his actual self, he was practically swimming in a sea of fur-lined robes and shining silk, ones so finely painted that the observer could possibly reach out and touch their fine hairs.
"And what, may I ask, is your answer for me today?" He purred as he laved. The same question he had asked every day. For the last four years.
When John reemerged, he put on a generous smile and made a round with the tray before taking his seat. Taking pride in the little triangle sandwiches Mrs. Hudson had helped teach him to cut, which turned one square of bread into three crust less Isosceles. With surgeon's hands, it was a surprisingly simple task.
After a brief rest, the men began their journey again at dawn, the route before them becoming more and more familiar to John as the daylight increased.
He stared at it for a long while, the entire thing only about eight inches in length, and shifted his elbows upon his knees, tilting the parchment a bit to find a better light. He cleared his throat and sat up until his scars pulled. Staring a bit more.
oo1. Athelny Jones was an inspector from Sir Doyle's 'The Sign of Four.' Just stole his name 'cause I liked it.
"For all these things to be firm and forever established, we have put the King's seal on this document and it has been signed by my hand. Given here on this day. May the peace and glory of Castle Appledore never die."
He nodded fitfully, feeling like an idiot and let out a breath he hadn't been aware he'd been holding. Sherlock saw everything as it slid across his face and pressed his scarf against his throat to keep it in place as he reached down to take up the nose piece. "You're perfectly safe. I'm right here." And he enveloped John's mouth in a kiss.
The calf's large black eyes had been closed in bliss. Her long limbs folded beneath her as she lay in utter contentment. "It's already been arranged." She shrugged.
"And I will not be held responsible for anyone else to be the death of you. Do you understand? If the worst thing I am at the end of all this is selfish, then I take that title willingly. Your death would END me. There is /nothing/ more important in this world than you are to me and I would rather watch London burn to the ground around my feet than allow one second to pass without you in existence."
Feeling the tight squeeze of hunger in his belly, John opened the fridge and found nothing immediately appealing. Or rather nothing he could convince himself looked tasty enough to want to make to eat after he was done with his toilette. "I'm starving. I don't suppose Mrs. Hudson was kind enough to make us up some breaky--"
"John," Sherlock redirected without looking away from the water. He was untwisting his scarf from around his neck and sliding rigidly out of his coat. All movements by rote. He handed both items to John, who took them dumbly without protest. Too transfixed.
After a little bit, John leaned in to whisper, unable to cool his thoughts. "Greg? Can you elaborate on what happened between Gregson and Sherlock during the Carl Powers' case? He's never mentioned him before."
The practiced ritual of making coffee for two did wonders to temper John's giddiness and settle out his nerves.
But the opening and the shutting of the medicine cupboard, however, does call the Propolis Elixir to his attention.
"Sorry? What?" It sounded absurd and John stopped completely from unrolling the stripping of gauze to the length he wanted, then shook his head vigorously. "You know what, I don't even want to fucking know. Don't tell me. I DON'T care." He pressed the gauze a little too firmly to Sherlock's head and wound the bandaging around the circumference of his skull a few times before knotting it on the opposite side.
When he returned, John had reclaimed himself. "So, if it's all the same then. I'd like to talk about this ...arrangement? I guess. Whatever it is we're calling it."
Silence settled again for a very long while between them. John watching Sherlock stare into his tumbler, afraid to disrupt the solemn moment and unguarded expression on his friend's face. The rarity of such a thing as it was made John think that Sherlock had purposely not thought of Victor Trevor for a very, very long time.
But John is already walking away at a clipped pace, his thumbs poking at his phone as his neck prickles with the feeling of being watched as he slips between the streetlights. He glances out of the corner of his eye at a zebra crossing and sees every shadow loom suspiciously larger. He knows he's being followed but fortunately nothing more menacing than the bitter cold materializes.
John could still recall with perfect clarity that golden feeling of sinking his hard member for the first time into that sweet pink arse. The sudden pop of opening flesh and the delicious puuuuush as he pressed into William. Those two round cheeks filling his small hands so beautifully as he slid inside with the most gentle persistance and brought his lover to the highest pleasure.
He only deigned to acknowledge her when John put an elbow into his side, giving her a small, forced smile. But it was enough for her face to split into a cheek-aching grin, two dimples appearing beneath her eyes. Those, in combination with the two buns her hair was pulled back into, made her look like a little girl. Her white lab coat was the only thing that grounded her back into maturity.
Sherlock held him through it, kept him tipped up and suspended in the aftershocks, until strong thighs tightened around his head with a claustrophobic whoosh of air. He lowered John against the bed and pulled himself up over the panting man's hips, admiring the spill of spunk.
Sherlock cocked his head coyly, polishing off the sandwich and said nothing. With his plush, pink lips glistening with grease and his gown sliding off one sharp shoulder, Sherlock looked nonchalantly wanton. And John was immediately struck with that unassailable feeling that took him at random moments; where he couldn't tear his eyes away.
For Sherlock, it was much easier to eat the remainders of his meal with John's body not nearly so close to him. Every second that passed made the prospect of tonight loom larger and larger until it was almost the only thing Sherlock could think about. And it terrified him that the bold invitation he'd so carelessly said yesterday with John in the bath was beginning to wither in the face of it actually coming to pass.
"But that's my room." Sherlock said, not quit understanding. Left standing crooked and shirtless in the man's furious wake.
"He's in a bit of a mood, isn't he?" She asked confusedly, turning back to John. "Let me just get a towel for that dear." She tutted at the mess in the kitchen and returned like a finicky aunt, blotting at John's chest while he still stared wide-eyed at the empty doorframe. "This will have to come off love. It's too chilly out there to be wet. You go and change and then we'll be off."
In the indeterminable amount of time it took for Sherlock's hands to end up tickling against the soft invisible hair peachfuzzing John's arse, John had begun to tremble with anticipation. His fingers were slipping on the ceramic. His breath coming out in heavy pants. His cock throbbing like a monster and dribbling merrily.
"How did you--uh, yes. Right. B--*ahem* he was mad about lore and mythology. Different cultures." John managed a small, wet smile as he stared hard at the back of the photo, as if it were the only way to see it. "Didn't matter what one specifically, just as long as it was ancient. He loved that stuff so much he started learning their languages in his spare time. He spoke five fluently, when I met him. Two dead languages as well. He could read Sanskrit."
There was no doubt Sherlock had just heard that. If he came in now, he'd be able to deduce that John had just been two knuckles deep in his own arse, tossing off desperately in the shower while imagining his flatmate like ...well, like he'd always done, sans finger, but things were /different/ now. Their dynamics had changed.
"Right. Oh, and uh John. If you could pass it along to Sherlock that if he bloody breaks your heart, I have your permission to knock his arse out the minute I find out, that would be great." Lestrade raised his cup in salute and grimaced behind a burnt tongue, appreciating John's surprised laugh. "You'll be wanting to keep it quiet I expect? For now anyway."
Sherlock threw his head back in a triumphant laugh as John rounded the landing, tossing his phone over his face as he leapt the last four steps in complete joy.
"Just touch me first, yeah? Get me off. Please?" John begs. Needing something to help spread out the tight focus of his hole being stretched wider than it ever has been. "I'll be quick. I'm close too."
Looking in, John could see that the spine itself had been detached roughly enough to crack a condyle, as if it had been wrenched from the man like a power cord from a socket. It left the ominous hole of his foramen magnum yawning strangely without his vertebrae to fill it.
Sherlock was curled around him like a cephalopod. Long arms twined tight around the bulk of John's chest, his hands willfully captured in John's fists as he'd slept or in the time that he'd assumed he'd been asleep. John knew by the interrupted breathing on the back of his neck that Sherlock was awake. "Sherlock?"
John had confronted him in the orchard shortly after hearing of the wedding party to be held in their honor in a few short days. So beset by rage was he that all he could do was take a swing as he approached and clocked William hard in the face.
Standing only in his small braies, John's nipples tightened in a mix of arousal and worry. One hand tightening on his elbow while his other curled into a fist as his hip, his arm crossing over his torso as if to hide himself.
The awkwardness dissipated and a camaraderie of silence fell between them for a time. Then Lestrade shifted in place. "Listen. I'm no expert on relationships, but if you ever wanted to, y'know, maybe grab a pint or--"
At the edge of each silver plate that was designed to butt up against another plate, the metal was gilt with the barest threads of gold. An effect that made each seam, when the full carapace was worn, seem to shine with an outward radiance.
And so he did. He watched in horror as the baskets that had come from the tired man's cart were passed around through the crowd now. More of the putrid items taken up in hate and haste until they were all gone.
'The Cross', as it had come to be called, was the center point of all the trade routes that snaked East, West, North, and South and all those in between throughout the known world. All of them came together here in a sort of eight-pointed star where trading posts for the most exotic to the most mundane goods had set up business and stayed. Over time the eclectic assortment had turned into a sort of village of its own and become permanent.
Henry Knight, William's husband, was the one who had greeted him at the door, after having watched John's limping struggle up the path through the window. John had left Clara hovering from afar at the front of the path, watching for any sign of trouble and ready to come running if he had needed her.
"So, you find yourself in a bit of a spot. What will you do this time? There are no fire alarms to pull here. No where to run. Not without leaving your friend behind. So I'll be taking both your kidneys Mr. Holmes. Along with whatever else I'd like. Does that suit you?" Her small eyes glitter in victory. Her quarry trapped in a kill jar. "Because that suits me just fine."
King Mycroft's absence from Appledore was to be filled by a temporary High Steward until his return. The position requiring someone trustworthy enough to run the daily household of the castle and, naturally, he had looked upon his younger Prince brother to fill the role.
John fought the first sickening thought that came to him concerning those particular symptoms, looming large in his mind as they were in conjunction with the bullseye's-worth hole gaping in his wallet and precisely why he'd left Sherlock alone almost an hour ago flashing in his memory. But he chewed his worry down into submission and made himself believe that Sherlock had simply come from a very hot, very loud room. Nothing else. He trusted him.
"I remember the goddamn tiles on the floor. I remember how cold they were on my arse. I remember choking and gagging and Janet's hands on me. All of it. And Jesus Sodding Chirst I REMEMBER yelling Bill's name.
To prove his point, Sherlock leaned down and unceremoniously shoved his first two fingers up into the head's nostrils, lifting it from the ground a couple of millimeters. Leaving no doubt that had it been broken; the head would have slid further down onto his hand with the weight. "What we're seeing here is the lesser studied method of extracting it through the /rear/ of the skull." He removed his hand and waved it as if it was all too tedious to continue talking.
The stretch of it stings dully. The pressure of initial resistance before the head pops in makes John's hips curl up and his knees rise into his periphery. "Sher--hmn. Sherlock." Sherlock's hands are curled around his hips and he doesn't stop his pressing until he's all the way inside.
The shock of light that poured in from the room beyond made the dark hallway flare brightly, strangely after so much darkness, before leaving it to fire-eaten shadow once more as the door was closed again.
"No. Really." Lestrade allowed himself a few huffs of laughter, "it's all about redirection. Whenever my nephew, Sam's his name, whenever he'd start to have a pout or get into stuff he weren't suppose to, my sister'd just redirect him. Make him use that energy towards something else. Helped them both out; cut down on the shouting and kept Sam out of trouble. Well, for the most part anyway. I've tried it on Sherlock a'couple of times and it worked like a charm! I'm not kiddin' you! You should try it."
"Positively edible." Charles took the sudden liberty of sinking his teeth semi-hard into the firm muscle where his shoulder met his neck and reveled in the shocked exhale of Sherlock's breath through his nostrils.
The tea cup paused midway to John's mouth, like the world had suddenly froze in place. Three seconds later and it would have undoubtedly been a spit take. He fought his pursed lips to form around the only word he could think to say and it came out incredibly meek. "Sorry?"
Usually anything born into this world was quick to die soon after. But this new life, following swiftly on the heels of John's recovery, felt like an absolution.
As John maneuvered in, he noted that the head had been left with a strip of the neck flesh still hanging loose beneath it. The front, where the man's esophagus would have been was longer than in the back, as if the victim's head had been tipped back when the decapitation had been made.
The little thrush jumped back upon the lentil as he shut the door to the adjacent room, watching him as he brought the lit candle and speared it down onto the candelabra near his bed and came to stand before the door to be ready when it swung wide.
Their simultaneous orgasms grip them utterly. Each of them crying out in ecstasy as the muscle contractions rage. John comes hard at the same time he feels the seeping heat of Sherlock's spunk spread inside his body. It is raw. It is wild. And it is wonderful.
"You clearly do not understand the significance of this, Lestrade! According to the London Bridge tide tables, this has all been orchestrated. Perfectly synchronised for the discovery of the head to happen just as Gregson was giving his speech about taking a suspect into custody! The WRONG suspect!
The main piece that housed his cock was a solid cylinder with a mushroom tip that sloped down to comfortably fit him while he was in a relaxed state. A vertical slit was carved in its tip to allow him to urinate without having to take it off, but the thick, solid wood made it impossible for him to get an erection.
And when John was able to finally lay eyes upon the great heavy door, the last obstacle that kept him from his Prince, his heart gave a mighty leap in his breast with excitement. Soon. Soon.
"I could've sworn the bugger was /you/ mate!" Lestrade wheezed as the panic left him. "He was your bloody twin."
The last one snagged on something in his memory. "Soo Lin Yao...who she?" The date beside her was written '(August 7th, 2010)'. That was incredibly recent.
"Sherlock." John sighed. "I don't want to go to a club. I want to eat. I'm starving. I haven't eaten all day."
It took a moment to locate the time that Sherlock was talking about. But then he remembered, standing amid the crates and crates stacked in their flat while they cross referenced Van Coon's and Lucas' books for a connection between the two men. That peculiar wording he'd used, the night he'd chosen to go out with Sarah instead and found himself unable to leave Sherlock's orbit. If even for a little bit. "That's very considerate of you. I remember turning you down flat."
The pliers relent instantly and slide out from John's mouth, followed by a backwash of saliva that sluices straight for his throat. John splutters and coughs, trying not to choke and despite feeling like he's drowning, his joy rises first to the surface.
The allowance was no longer than a second, barely more than a quick flash of his eyes, but John knew that Sherlock had seen what there was to see and when their eyes met up once more, Sherlock nodded minutely in thanks and John nodded back, slipping the soft fabric on and feeling a little bit calmer.
John found himself grasping at ghosts suddenly. An icy cold blooming in his guts as he thought back to his last days in Afghanistan. Those last moments of clarified consciousness that felt like they'd happened a lifetime ago, to somebody else even, ones he'd fought so hard not to think on. And he decided immediately that if they started down this particular path tonight, it was certain to ruin their evening. John decided he didn't want that at all.
When it became clear that John still wasn't getting it, that there was possibly too much blood taking precedence in other places rather than his brain, the nibbling of Sherlock's fingers stopped and he began to direct the proceedings. "Move forward. Slowly."
John had no doubt that he looked a fright as he weathered the cold rake of the High Steward's dead eyes. His clothing was caked with mud and felt a thousand times heavier than when he'd first put it on. His beard felt as solid as a sheaf of barley on the bottom of his face. And he sucked in such big lungfuls of air that black spots danced before his vision. "Please." He gasped. "Please."
"With little choice but to go into battle, he left the castle to me. But I made a grievous error in judgement that day, John. In a fit of insolence I refused my brother and what I thought - at the time - to be my most triumphant moment instead turned into my darkest hour.
"Laxatives. An enema. PhosphodiaaaAAAAH! -sterase number 5 inhibitor." Came the strained answers. "In that order."
His jaw had been broken, said the report. His eye socket fractured. His C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae had all been broken and had to be fused together. He had suffered a collapsed lung and a broken ankle. Multiple lacerations to his hands. Defensive wounds to his palms. Abrasions. Cuts. Contusions
Those sinister lips opened, then closed and John waited patiently for it to come. Like fate, just as he finally found his voice, the ignorant cabbie announced '221B' right over the top of his "John, I--".
There was only one visitor that was ever permitted to see John now, and that was William Murray. A slender whip of a man with a short mop of ginger hair and a smile that could slice through darkness like a sunbeam. A man with whom John had grown up and shared a history with as old as all the love stories.
The fish's body was a mosaic of large red scales, which stopped at the broad curve of its gill flap. It's upturned jaw with its forked protrusions almost seemed to sip at the top of the water. Breaking the calm surface as it moved.
Later that morning, still accosted by silence, John tried again at Sherlock's door. He was certain at one point that he'd heard the detective's mobile hastily being silenced mid-ring, which had only made John's confusion click up into bewildered frustration.
"By all means." John play-acted easily and stepped aside. The sting of her nickname for Sherlock seemed to linger longer and more harshly now than it had when she'd last dropped it casually at NSY when they'd been concerning themselves with the pips. Was it the change in their dynamic? Or the tanacity with which she said it? A LOT had changed in such a short time after all.
The truth was that Sherlock reading him, as he always did, and reacting accordingly. Being a rather damn good nurse maid in the process. "It's actually not been that bad." He finally finished.
John, however, didn't seem to notice this universal shift. Continuing to talk down at his rapidly disappearing food. "Although next time the mood strikes, if you could avoid the part involving public humiliation, I'd appreciate it. Sherlock? Are you even listening?"
And like being absolved, John's outlook on the putrescence that was his life had been wiped clean with one simple flash of ice-coloured eyes that had only met his briefly before sweeping away.
They went to the Lady of the Manor (who was in charge of thiers and all the surrounding land at that time) when they were both of age at sixteen seeking her consent to marry. But the Lady would not give her consent. Instead, she had had her eye fixed upon William to become her own son's husband. And lacking all alacrity, she had refused them.
"What? No." John bolstered himself at the flash of shame, forgetting that Sherlock could read minds. He supposed he should be grateful Sherlock hadn't said anything in front of Miles. "Listen Sherlock, I was out of line before. I DO trust you. I don't want you thinking that I don't. It just surprised me is all."
He had risen before daybreak and dressed by candlelight. Anticipation and doubt still gnawing at his guts that perhaps yesterday had been a figment of his imagination. But William's stroke upon the door to wake him a short while later had done much to calm his nerves.
Trusting him implicitly and wanting to convey that, John let all the muscles in his body go as limp as they could without falling over, setting down the curled tube of toothpaste and going lax. Leaving only his cock to retain its solid expression and giving Sherlock whatever he wanted. Offering it to him freely.
Henry opened his mouth to speak, but just then, William had stepped up behind him and slid his hand into his husband's, giving it a little squeeze.
"War does things, Sherlock. Things that...it changes you..." He looked up into Sherlock's sea glass eyes and tried to be as honest as possible while simultaneously remaining very vague. "It was good. What we had, while it lasted. It helped me make it through. It made it /bearable/." John knew that was not the answer Sherlock was watching him for, but as a token of his friendship, he was letting it lie. John took a bolstering swallow and tried to steer the conversation back around. "Your turn now. You've obviously deduced most of the things that there are about me with that big bloody brain of yours. I want to hear about you. What you've done. Have you been with a man?"
Ever since his convalescence, John had never been able to get used to the wrongness of this new body he had and how strange it felt to inhabit it. How drastically it now differed from the body of his youth. Gone were the lean, tight muscles of hard-laboured limbs that had once been - by his own and others' estimation - beautiful to behold. Now, they had been replaced by a stretch of thin, scarred skin warped tightly over a nest of sharp bone.
John's choices had not been made by his time in Afghanistan. Not his want to be alone. Not made because this had been his third (final) tour patching up the soldiers in the name of Queen and Country. Not made because of the stifling dry day where he'd stopped to laugh and a bullet had carved his body a new hole. Not made when he'd knocked his shooting glasses from his face in an attempt to find the source of the numbness and bring back blood on his fingertips. Not made when he found rough soft sand below him or the billowing purple sky above.
And the third, god help him, was completely dry and looked nigh unbearable. John had had to tuck Sherlock's face into the crook of his neck to keep that grimace from stopping his aching hips completely.
"Hang on. Moriarty? What are you two talking about?" John loathed being out of the loop, especially when it involved the likes of that bastard. He made himself be heard. "Who's Gregson?"
"No." Idly, Sherlock's fingertip drew a Golden spiral starting at the center of John's cervical spine and radiated it outward precisely. "But I was rarely myself in all the time I spent with them, so explanation never seemed necessary. And since I preferred penetration and intercourse was rarely pursued without the use of recreational drugs, my body would perform admirably. So it never really became an issue. But if they did notice when I didn't achieve orgasm, they never said." He could feel the tension coil minutely in John's body and instantly he cleared the air. "That is not to say I ever allowed myself to be coerced or abused because of it, if that's what you're worried about. I assure you that I was always a willing partner every time. I simply provided myself as the means to an end for something they felt they needed by necessity and I ...did not."
Sherlock ate at his mouth, allowing the closeness to proceed as John saw fit, only freezing again when John's fingertips swirled incredibly close to his prick and paused there in the dark curling hair. He pulled in a breath and tipped his chin away with a wet smack, blinking quickly.
Silently to himself, though, John made a vow that he would not use Sherlock the way he had been used in the past, whether Eric and Victor had known of his asexuality or not. That every time they engaged in any type of intercourse from here on out, it would be by mutual decision between the two of them and he hoped that Sherlock would have enough respect for John to tell him the truth of how he felt when they did.
He had approached the village on horseback, with his army of a thousand women and men making camp in the fields. As if they intended to stay. The streets had deserted themselves at his approach. No man or woman willing to come and face him until John, having fallen heavily into drinking by that time, had stumbled out from the local pub on his way home and almost bumped right into Moran's horse.
Again, as it had been trained, it knocked twice in quick succession and finally a sharp intake of breath was its reply.
"But how?" Sherlock frowned more deeply, clearly confused and angry about it. "It's not as if it's been consummated. I've no more rights to you than anyone else. What's to stop you from simply leaving?"
He's left in this uneasy fog of questions until they're headed back to Baker Street, each of them sitting side by side but too far apart in the back seat of a cab looking silently out the opposite windows. John contemplates Sherlock's hesitance. Watches Sherlock's contemplative reflection, the way his knuckles are pressed to his lips.
"You will not interfere with my feelings on it. Just as it will not interfere with my feelings about you. These things are to remain separate within me. You have to understand that."
"It was so quick." John said hollowly, as if he were absent from his body and the only thing that remained inside him was his story. "I hadn't even realized I'd done it until it was done. I remember the blood hitting my face. It was hot. And thick. And I remember his face, I will always remember his face as he fell. How it twisted. How his blood would not stop coming out no matter how hard he pressed it back with his hands. It's so much different than cutting the throat of an animal...I didn't know...I'd never killed before. It scared me...and in my cowardice I ran. I ran before his body had even hit the ground."
"No! I mean---yes. Your Highness. I can speak." John's voice was thin when it emerged. But his answer did finally please.
"And I am also happy to inform you that the King is allowing you to bring with you a second man, your most trusted companion, whom has already agreed to make this journey with you. So we are to leave at dawn on the morrow."
When the High Steward had shut the door between them, had walked them to the top of the steps which were far enough away from the door that Sherlock would not hear, he turned to John. "All this?" He asked, eyeing him critically. Trying to make John wither beneath his stare. "For an insignificant mushroom?"
"Well, you know more than I do by now that Sherlock's an arsehole and arrogant and disrespectful and a sodding dictator if you let him be, and those are just the /good/ days. But I suppose I'm just use to it by now." Lestrade conceded and then looked very pleased. "There is one thing, a trick when it comes to dealing with His Nibs that I learned it from watching my sister try to control her two year old."
"You sure Johnny?" Harry'd asked with identical eyes. "I just threw this in here to beef up my locations. To make me look like a /real/ real estate agent. Fuck's sake, I didn't think you'd actually like it! Arkham Village's four miles away and you don't even know how to drive! You won't be able to get there until they release you from hospital. Are you absolutely sure?"
"No argument there." Sherlock grinned, revealing a joke John hadn't intended to make. John busied himself with inspecting the wound, finding it shiny with moisture, which was a good sign. He carefully checked it for signs of infection, put delicate fingers to the redness to see if it gave off any heat and took a cursory sniff for any unusual odor. Satisfied, he applied another smear of antibiotic ointment to the exposed cartilage and peeled apart an occlusive bandage, snipping it to form fit over the odd shape of his ear. Sherlock continued speaking while he worked.
"Yes. I only wanted to know what this felt like. And now I have. I'm alright if you're done after this. It's fine." God Sherlock feels HUGE inside him. Overwhelming. He doesn't mind being done. If this is the only time he gets to experience this, it has been more than enough.
"Aye." John had ceded. He was pathetic. He knew it. He considered himself the lowliest of lifes now. But still he had his morals.
He doesn't look back as he leaves Bart's. He can't. Not when he knows precisely how it will look to leave the love of his life lying on the floor.
Sherlock buried the seed of his thought and turned to the window as well. Looking out onto the South valley through a torrid of pounding hearts.
'There's a birthday present on the table for you, I felt it was a good representation. Have a nice day. - SH'
John also had the sneaking suspicion that Sherlock was considering himself untenable now that his body had revealed its apathy towards sex. As if it were some broken thing that he merely got on with. And with a sinking feeling, John guessed that this was the first time he'd ever let someone willingly see it. That he'd /allowed/ someone to see it.
wow. bet you thought i was dead huh? :} well i'm not. and neither is the story. i've been thinking about it lately and am pleased to say that i'd like to get back into writing it hopefully until it's finished. thanks for the support. sorry it took me so long to love this again.
"It's just," she reached up and touched his neck with her fingertips, coming away red. "There's blood."
He kept his eyes in front, as he could not look back at William and see pity, of all dreadful things, to be swimming in William's eyes. For him to be accompanying John solely because of guilt seemed anathema.
John's shoulders slumped, something inside him twinging badly at the idea that Sherlock had had to take it upon himself to try and give himself medical aid. "You could have woken me up."
But she had thanked him with a good tea time and celebrated his victory with a delicious home-made supper and sent him finally back upstairs with leftovers and an affectionate peck on his cheek in thanks.
When he wasn't brooding in his chair, John spent some of his time brooding in his bed with the loo roll as his only companion and the rest of time poised over the toilet in case the constant threat of swirling nausea actually resulted in vomiting. But it never did.
Sherlock's breath punched from his lungs. His blood running cold as the hawk screeched victoriously, circled round, and landed back upon the window ledge with its catch.
He pulled a face and glanced down the hall to Sherlock's door once more, a picture entering his head of Sherlock poised on the other side, silently reveling in John's continued misery. Finding himself the victim in yet another conundrum, John dutifully gulped down as much of the saccharine tea as he could manage before dumping the dregs of it into the sink. He couldn't manage it all. It was simply too ghastly.
Ensconced in the warm embrace of his chair and gratified by the first satin sip of some /very/ fine scotch, John suddenly came to the realization as he looked across to his expectant flatmate, with whom he was about to discuss previously untold secrets regarding his amorphous sexuality, that his mind had come up completely blank.
He came back over to stand too close again, his crystal eyes boring into John like lightning through a tree. "Interesting." He tilted his head. His voice dropping into a whisper that was an octave lower than his usual voice. "Then, perhaps, your congeniality would extend so far as to obtain an item for me? One that, if you were caught trying to acquire it, would see you fined for all you have, would see you stripped of your title, and sent to prison for the rest of your life? Or is there a point at which your congeniality stops?"
Aware that the silence had gone on for too long, John struggled for something to say."If you have summoned me here to have an opinion on art, my Lord, I fear that I have none."
The intake read out like a car wreck. Each fact only amassing to a worse and worse calamity until all the hateful parts made up a nightmare whole.
It was the unfinished portion that had trapped his attention. And, with a subtle glance to the High Steward, apparently also the cause of the obsessive stroking of his breastbone.
One more application of threading, slick saliva to his hand and Sherlock pressed inside and curled his fingertips down against the swollen, richly sore gland of John's prostate, primed to explode. Holding nothing back. He stroked it three times clockwise and watched John's body climb to the precipice.
With his face tilted up, the light striking softly on the high crest of his cheekbone, he looks so small and helpless for a man that's larger than life. The rogue tear banks back at his jaw and scrolls down his neck, disappearing into his shirt collar. He's so goddamn beautiful.
John got carefully to his feet as the monk waved and dismounted and brought the animal with him in his approach. John tracked him carefully in his periphery as he found and slipped his shirt back on, supposing it bad manners to meet a man of the Lord half naked, though the man did not seem to personally mind.
It was here that the thrush took momentary rest upon a merlon, a large rectangle of stone that made up one of the crenellations on the outer curtain of the castle. A place for archers to hide while they reloaded. Perfectly placed above the dead-ground.
"The composite will function just like a normal tooth," Dr. Sipe was saying, "but if anything should happen; go ahead and give me a call. Otherwise, I'd like to see you back in two weeks just to make sure everything's worked out."
"Absolutely." John smiled and left, tapping the book on the bar top. "Thanks again and congratulations. Of course."
John's stab of laughter was congested, thinking on a past long gone. "Uh yeah, though HE certainly thought he was as well."
It certainly didn't feel like that long. He felt like he had just blinked or maybe slept a whole night. "I don't know if I told you before, but that was bloody amazing."
"Makes sense I guess. Might be interesting to watch since we've nothing on tomorrow." John agreed, looking out into the living room and hearing the bright harmony of foreign opera. It was nice. "It's kind of a shame though, how nice Dr. Sipe was. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill psychopaths." John scratched his eyebrow. "Threw me for a loop."
"John?" Sherlock said softly, after a while. He pressed his face against John's, swiping his jaw against his tears like war paint. Like he couldn't help it.
"I don't fucking believe it!" Came an infuriated cry from the car. "What the HELL are you two doing here?" Sergeant Sally Donovan threw the driver's side door open and stepped out with fury taut across her speckled face. Her wiry hair had been tamed back with a barrett, her jacket shining with her badge. It took little thought to know why she was here as another officer exited the vehicle from the passenger's seat.
He let out a long suffering breath as he threw down his keys and realized that the table had been cleared. Sherlock had apparently been back to the flat in John's absence and finished up his fly project in the shadow box. He found it hanging up beneath the glazed bison skull in the sitting room.
John snorted in astonishment, his spell of concern abating to caution, "what experiment?" His face flushed bright red as Sherlock's lips plodded further and further down toward the damp marsh of his groin, detouring south long before he reached his groin. Judging by the severity of his flushing skin, Sherlock guessed that no one before had ever shown oral interest in John's backside. Shame, that.
"Are you lost?" John wasn't about to turn away such a man, but his hackles still did rise at the fact that an outsider was coming to visit him. He had hoped his isolation would have lasted longer than this.
And he couldn't help himself if he admired the way he caught John nonchalantly checking the bottom third of the door handle as they came in.
"So are you." Sherlock slurs and it's the last coherent thing that slips from his mouth before a litany of soft breaths follow.
After a stunned moment, Sherlock cleared his throat and refocused himself. Beginning to pace a small pattern in front John. "R-radix pedis diaboli." His hands came up together before his chin in a wide splay of fingers. "Or perhaps known better as 'the devil's-foot root'. Named so for the way the pileus cracks up the middle when the fungus dries out, giving it the appearance of a cloven hoof.
An ugly thought suddenly flashed unbidden across his mind. Striking him cold. "Sherlock?" He made nervous circles on Sherlock's hip with his fingers, still using the faux casual tone that fooled nobody. "I meant what I said before about you not having to hide anything from me. If something..." he licked his lips, "if someone's done something to you...anything you didn't want. I--"
A tight feeling in his throat had been irritating him since earlier, no doubt exasperated by climbing in and out of Mrs. Hudson's dusty cupboards, and while it was the ONE good mark of the sweetened tea that while he drank it, it seemed to quell the scratchiness, when he stopped, it came back with a two-fold vengeance.
He hasped out a terrible breath and stifled the urge to cough. He swallowed and swallowed against the sudden pain flaring bright in his throat, grimacing and massaging his neck with his fingers. God, he didn't want to admit it to  himself, but it had almost felt like this was the first symptom of getting sick. He eyed the petri dishes still piled on the table warily, but saw that they had all been closed and stacked according to some sort of organizational scheme. If he was truly becoming ill, he was going to /throttle/ Sherlock when he saw him again.
"Alright. Easy. I'm just asking." John didn't understand the sudden shift in emotion that was playing out behind the door. Had Asano-san said something? Was there more going on? John made to move away, but then hesitated. "Hey Sherlock? The Chairman handed me something when I was downstairs. A business card, I think, but I can't read it. Can you, I dunno, maybe take a look at it? Tell me what you think?"
Miles seemed to relax noticebly after that. "Cheers. I promise I'll leave you alone as soon as they're back."
Sherlock grinned in a way that John felt in his bones and without breaking eye contact, placed his slickened middle  fingertip to John's furled hole as requested. John twitched, blowing out a strained exhale through his nose with his jaw locked up tight. A gentle circled pressure against /there/ had his breath picking up and hissing from his nose like a bull, leaning hard into his wrists.
As he spoke, the trio had reached the autopsy room and Sherlock threw the doors open dramatically, before turning immediately on the spot, frowning. "Lestrade? Where's the body?"
"This fucking light isn't good enough. I can't see. Can you make it to the bathroom?" John moved around so that he was able to pull Sherlock's arm over his shoulder.
"The pusher went through the trouble to treat both men exactly the same premortem. Both were given extravagant suits in such a brief period of time that the material used in making both is sure to have come from the same bolt of fabric. Definitely having been made by the same private tailor sewn with identical stitching and thread.
John drank the rest of his coffee with one swallow and carefully set aside his newspaper. Allowing his friend time to read his stiff body language. Sherlock's shoulders grew almost imperceptibly more taut and his hands slowed down in their work. It was then that he engaged him, knowing he had his full attention even if his head was turned away. "So. Are we going to talk about it?"
"Back. Against the headboard." Sherlock instructed and John immediately obliged, setting up pillows to lean on behind him. He pressed a thumb into his own shoulder experimentally, plying the tender muscles. It felt ...new. He watched Sherlock fall onto him, a new sort of hunger filling those incredible eyes as he made short work of John's buttons and flies. Straight to the point.
"The second and last person to which I attempted to form a relationship with was a man named Victor Trevor. We attended the same university."
John wants desperately to reach out and grab ahold of him before Sherlock can pull away and it feels like one of life's most ultimate betrayals that he can't.
There was a half done figure at the High Steward's shoulder in the portrait. Standing tall and thin like an apparition that was only given form through roughly sketched lines and abstract shapes. But it was the pair of eyes that this wraith had, not yet fully realized but instantly recognizable, that had stayed John's gaze.
These next words didn't come as easily as Sherlock would have thought. "I will make it up to you John."
He spoke his discoveries aloud to an unmoved Sherlock and moved on to investigate the skin of the neck itself.
Not wanting to embarrass him, brother Michael gently took the scroll back from his hands and read it aloud, as it was evident John could not read:
"As you wish." Sherlock's cheek crutched up into a tight smile and he winked. "I'll have a transcription of my blood work drawn up for you, as I know that would be an obvious concern of yours, though you can take it on my word that I am clean. There's no need to prepare your own, however, as I have taken the liberty to monitor your current status since you moved in." He turned back and gave Mrs. Hudson the sort of chaste kiss on the cheek he reserved for the times when people were falling dead in the street. Before his heels tapped loudly down the stairs and the front door clicked with finality in his wake.
He kissed him once. Twice. Enjoying the half-second it took for Sherlock to catch up to his plan and admired the sheer look of confusion painted on that beautiful face.
"I told you that if your presence was no longer of value to me than your absence would make no difference."
John had prepared himself so completely for this moment that when it came, so many scenarios spinning through his mind that ranged from icy stoicness to absolute outrage, that when faced with the actual reality of standing in front of the man who was married to the man he had loved most ardently for almost all his life, he didn't act at all.
He took a large sniff of the air, frowning. "I can smell her curling iron. She always sets it too hot. I don't think she can read the dial anymore."
Sherlock stood facing John with his hands behind his back. His elegant figure haloed in by the pale light of morning, which served as a perfect backdrop to the dove gray gown threaded with gold that swathed his lean body in beautiful lines and made the fabric itself seem to glow.
"No, I--" John found himself saying, though he had not thought to do so. To have those eyes turn away now felt like this moment would disappear. "No," and then his hands were moving. He slid the wide belt from his waist and loosed the strings from the top of his boots. But here he paused, for he knew that the gauntlet he had run his body through for the past three days, his back would not be kind enough to let him bend.
John had resisted looking at his companion for as long as he possibly could, but being left alone with him now, unable to have anything else familiar to soothe him, John looked.
"Then go join her DOWNSTAIRS. I can't have you two prattling on ad nauseam while I'm trying to think."
Convincing himself that he'd learn his sentencing here in a moment anyway, John lifted his chin defiantly, outstretched his arm, and mentally pulled on his thick skin. "Sherlock. Could I have a towel please?" He was free to let fly whenever.
John's wandering eyes fell upon the strange rock he'd been gifted yesterday and was reminded that he'd  totally forgotten about it. It seemed to have migrated onto the mantle piece sometime in their absence, taking residence near Billy the skull. It was no large task to imagine that Mrs. Hudson must have been unable to resist the urge to tidy while she had commandeered their laundry. "Well, anyway, on a completely different note; I never thanked you for the um...the rock. So thanks...for that." He turned back. "Why a rock?"
Sherlock bent down lower now, electricity crackling in his loosened muscles, leaning in for a kiss. Pulling back slightly when John turned his head away. His voice so small and helpless. "Sherlock. I'm ill."
"Your brother is an adult, Mycroft. Even if you've lost the ability to see it. Let me out." John scowled, not able to stand another minute in the slowly rotating car. "Sherlock's fully capable of making decisions for himself and he doesn't need your constant supervision to get on in the world."
John rose numbly, Mrs. Hudson following, both finding the intended box sitting amongst the rest of the boxes, the flies and the larvae, camouflaged in the melee. It was medium in size and wrapped in butcher paper. There was a nonsense formula scribbled on it for something in Sherlock's distinctive scrawl.
The pressure of Sherlock's tongue on the third attempt was absolute genius. It lapped and swirled, formed tight into a blunt tip to skirt along the alley of flesh between cock and anus. John's hips rocked spasmodically as Sherlock strayed close to his hole, crying out in surprise when he came too near. His sweaty palm having to readjust its hold on his knee as it had begun to slip.
It was quite possible to believe that they were the only people currently occupying this ghost town, if it weren't for the prickle of hidden eyes watching them that tingled the back of John's neck.
John did his best to sit up a little straighter, trying to look his part. Little good would come in the whispers of the townsfolk if they thought the King was now employing broken knights.
He found Sherlock seated at the dining room table, straight-backed and peering imperiously down into his microscope. Taking time to notice the tilting pile of petri dishes stacked near his elbow. If only because their gelatinous red agar appeared to be colonized by something particularly furry and the topmost dish looked rather nefarious with a scalpel balanced across its open face. As it had just received a thorough scraping for transfer to a slide.
It was a miracle this little cow had survived this long at all. Having been calved this past winter by these same oxen pulling his plough. Very literally almost having been born right on his pillow given that the cow had gone into labor at dusk and since all the animals they owned were brought inside the house with them during the night to dissuade theft and predation, she'd birthed the little calf right there beside the bedstead.
He clasped his hands on the bartop and cleared his throat. "Want to elaborate on why it is we're here? For real this time. If this is for the case, a /closed/ case as was my understanding of it, it might be helpful to let me in on whatever bit of evidence there is that's got you convinced it's worthwhile for us to come here."
John was incredibly staunch in his spending habits. He took vigilant care of their finances. Though he never confronted Sherlock about dubious purchases, only adjusted for them and moved on. It was his money that he'd earned doing cases, after all.
Emboldened by this request, John chanced to make one of his own: "Then, if this shall be the way of things, I ask that you call me John. If it pleases you. Sherlock." John offered. Unable to keep from saying his name again. Now that he had the right to do so.
"So? Who did it?" The video cut to to the camera having been mounted in the top corner of the room, putting the whole rack of tanks in its field of sight. With the lights turned off, the room was gray and full of shadows, the once colorful fish had turned to black meandering splotches against the wall, seeming to float in midair.
John's eyes took their liberty to roam the body before him. This tall, lithe thing that stood presenting itself to him with such muted power. And John let out a little gasp as he saw the prominent bulge in the shadow of Sherlock's hips, unwilling to hide. John took the time to admire it while Sherlock was held captive in his task. The long, hard cock standing proud between his legs.
"Yes indeed. He's such a lovely man." She's wearing that television smile again. "He wanted me to let you know that he was glad to finally be able to make your acquaintance in person the other night. You were everything he had hoped for. You and your pet."
John shut his eyes, trying to remember as best he could, having to swallow down the jagged feeling that kept trying to rise in his throat. Tasting awfully like bile. "The day after I went into septic shock and had to be put on a ventilator...
"Wait. Yeah. I think I remember this back from school." John smiled as he recalled it. "Except what I saw was done with potatoes."
The hot shower he took soothed him and his scratchy throat for the most part. Deliberately not thinking about where he was and what exactly he'd been doing here a few days before. He shoved those thoughts viciously out of his mind, unwilling to parse through old emotions that'd felt like they'd happened to someone else by this point.
Groaning, John slid his legs out of bed and sat up. His face immediately going into his hands as his stomach gave an uneasy squeeze. He did not rouse again until William swung a goblet of wine under his nose and pressed a half loaf of bread and some sliced meats into his hands.
"Do you require use of the closed stool?" Charles asked, indicating to the box with a hole cut into its padded velvet top one of the servants had brought up. It was a portable toilet that was always brought to him for use, as he could not leave his solar to use the garderobe.
John found Sherlock standing awkwardly between his leather chair and the table in the sitting room, holding an expandable folder in his hands and picking nervously at the edge. John assumed it was the information he'd had Lestrade send over, but when John put the paperback down on their office table, he wasn't at all surprised when Sherlock set down the folder right on top, obscuring it from view.
Being dismissed, though knowing it was on good terms, John wet his lips with his tongue and bowed at the waist, knowing the entire time that Sherlock was looking at him through the reflection of the glass. "Good day. Sherlock."
"Although there IS light scuffing on the souls of his brand new shoes, which suggests that his killer walked with him a bit as well. Helped to ensure that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time. All of these things reinforced by the fact that he was under the direct influence of a sedative."
"Do you hold to your oaths, John Watson?" He finally asked, once John pinched look of starvation had left John's face.
Having had enough of a break, the thrush pushed off and upwards, flapping its wings again and again, having to work harder against the air as it climbed higher and higher, flying as if to pull the waking dawn into the sky by its speckled breast alone.
". . . his ambition in politics is matched by that of his family wealth and besides that he's never done too much damage to anyone important." Mycroft went on. "The promise of you as a consort was the only way he would agree on such short notice. There was nothing I could do. You've tied my hands and so I have promised him yours. He will suffice." His eyes narrowed suddenly as a thought struck. "Do as he says, Sherlock. Whatever he says. Stand against him or his wishes in any way and you shall consider yourself standing against me."
"And...we appreciate you getting us in in such short notice." John fumbled to add, trying to act a part that he was actually not having to act at all.
Around forty minutes later and a second cone of shared peanuts, the conversation had turned to the subject of his friend's last week alive, when Miles and two other lifelong friends had taken said friend to his favourite place in the world called Barafundle Bay. John learned that it was at that beach in Whales where his friend had chosen finally to take his life without the rest of the party knowing until it was too late.
Their main dining area had been overtaken as a laboratory long before he'd even moved in and he saw no point in trying to change it now. Keeping his roommate's inquisitive nature confined to a centralized location was enough of a formidable challenge and he relegated himself to stopping the spread of experiments from taking over every flat surface of their kitchen as much as he could.
Sherlock snorted in a soft, warm laugh before lapsing back into the silence. And did not speak again.
"Hate me if you must." Sherlock said resignedly, going to the sitting room table and pulling from a messy pile a single sheet of paper. He handed it to John before going to the window and placing his hands behind his back, staring out at Baker Steet as if he were a hanged man looking out at the world for the last time from his gallows, feeling the weight of the rope around his neck. "But know that it will never alter my regard for you."
High Steward Charles Magnussen came up behind him quietly, appearing over his shoulder just as he felt gentle fingers tease a couple of curls on his head.
"Whatever it is, it's certainly not from a dry cleaners." He shuffled the irritant to the back of his mind to unconsciously think on with a sigh. "The corpse had been wearing the suit for at least ten hours before he died. Factoring in conduction of heat against the temperature of the street he was lying on as it affected Algor mortis...what?"
Sherlock pulled both balls into his open mouth with incredible handless dexterity, rolling them against the cup of his tongue and eliciting an impassioned groan from the good doctor. But when he slurped in more of the thin, stretchy skin and gave all the spoils in his jaw a delicate bite, the testicles compressed and John seemed to jolt back to reality.
"He said that I am not to consider myself your friend. That I am to see to it that you remain in good spirits until your marriage to him. That that is my only purpose." It rent something deep in John's chest to hear his own mouth say these things aloud.
Thankfully, Charles' eyes were on John this time when the Captain turned to meet Sherlock's gaze and using every ounce of his will John kept his face entirely impassive, for Sherlock's eyes were an absolute flood of shame and remorse.
John couldn't help but let himself fantasize briefly about what it meant to hold that distinction. It hinted to the dangerous possibility of waking up in a shared bed to a fuzzy-edged morning to a dark and messy head peeking out from beneath the duvet beside him. Their skin tight from shared emissions from the night previous. Consecrating themselves together through light, insistent kissing despite shared dragon breath. It spoke of panting into each other's mouths. Laced fingers during a slow fuck. Coming twice and whispering nothings. Interspersed with everythings.
Sherlock's mouth hangs open. Eyes half-lidded. The dark smear of bruises on his face compliment the lovely architecture of his skull like war paint. And there's a barely perceptible tremor coursing through him which astounds John Watson to know that he can feel it /inside/ himself.
John had laughed. One single scoff and self-conscious hand stroked over his beard. "I--Thanks. I am well. Thanks in part to you." He had said, glancing at his feet. Unable to keep William's eyes for too long lest the sting behind his eyes come to real tears.
John's neck went to water, letting his head fell back with a thunk as he allowed himself to give up watching and simply /feel/. Gasping harshly as Sherlock took him into his mouth without any hesitation, testing the limitations of John's impressive girth in the confines of his hot, wet jaw. And even if it all turned out to be the impractical investigations of a scientist detective; to John it felt akin to pure carnal rapture.
John groaned as Sherlock slid his body closer, bare feet bracketing shoes, sharp bones pushing against firm muscle pushing against hard counter. John's erection slotted neatly into the space between Sherlock's strong thighs and caused him to tremble when Sherlock began to grind subtly against him with upward inflections.
Sherlock growled suddenly, cutting off his sentence. His fingers flashing open in irritation. "Must you insist on calling me 'your Highness' every time?! If this is to be our new arrangement, you and I will both find it incredibly tiresome to hear at the end of everything."
Harry had grabbed the idea with both hands shaking and swore up and down she had had her last drink and that she had reigns of her life on the turn around. Clara just needed to see. Take some time to calm down. She'd said all this while spreading out her folders across John's bed trolley, taking a seat beside his thighs and ducking beneath all his IVs.
"I was still a Sergeant when it all happened, so that would make it, what, back in the eighties? /Jesus/, that's been a while. I only heard it through the grapevine around the office, but the story goes that Gregson took up the Powers' case and immediately decided that it had been an accident, based on evidence. Totally open and shut. Nothing outrightly suspicious. And I guess it makes sense; young kid in a pool, has a conniption, gets water in his lungs and goes down like a rock. Happens more than you'd think.
He pulled Sherlock's hands away from the ratty old chair and clasped them tightly in his own, trying to find those virdigris eyes by using his chin as a lever, but Sherlock remained stubbornly buried over his shoulder, unwilling to look. "You. Just give me you." Sherlock rasped. "Please. I--I won't last. It won't last. Please. Please? I beg of you. You said you would-- give me you."
The body in the water was long and pale and naked. Caught in a dark lay of seaweed. John went in up to his nipples. The surf trying its damndest to knock him down and he unwound the cold body from its colder lash.
Sherlock pursed his lips and narrowed his eyes. "Put the routing number to my bank account at the bottom, he said he would wire the money to us as soon as he could."
"I suppose I can see how bacteria could be so offensive to you. But honestly, if it's going to vex you so much, next time you make an agreement with someone, I would recommend including all possible variables within the parameters and systematically eliminating them from consideration.
"He...Victor was very encouraging of my work, which was still in its infancy at the time. He did, after everything that happened, inspire me to put my methods to more profitable use. Though I suspect now that his yearly invitations to the manor were more a means to keep an eye on me and my chemical use, rather than in want of my direct company. To this day it would not surprise me to learn of Mycroft having some involvement in the whole matter.
"Not simply flies John." He insisted. "Naturally occurring indicators in the field of forensics. They can be incredibly useful in determining the time of death on found corpses based on their individual life cycles. For example," he held up an impaled fly that had a greenish blue coloration under the light, "this particular species is calliphoridae. Usually the first of their kind to arrive at a death, drawn by the smell of decomposition. If one finds an adult calliphoridae on a body, one knows that the corpse has been dead for at least twenty days.
"John." Sherlock's deep voice cracked as loud as a peal of thunder through the room, though he'd only had it raised above a whisper. Sherlock tossed the book back into the drawer and shut it with a slam, as if he could reverse this opening of this Pandora's box. "Look at me John."
"You're not going to start sulking about the flat bemoaning your inability to get shagged now are you?" Sherlock asked suddenly.
The exchange itself took no longer than a moment before brother Michael was kicking his horse into motion once more and leading the two other goggling men northward to their intended destination.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and smirked as though he'd seen inside his head. "In what capacity could it not go well?"
John washed up at a slow pace as well, towel drying and putting the dishes away, and then finally, finally, /finally/ shrugged into his coat and muffler, hissing with a grimace at his shoulder. It was bloody awful today. "Come on then." He muttered halfway down the first turn of steps and Sherlock sprang from the chair like a frog in a dynamite pond to follow.
An idea of the Sherlock before John was coming together for him now, bits and pieces from Lestrade's, Mrs. Hudson's, and Mycroft's first-hand accounts coalescing to reveal more and more of what he had suspected all along: that Sherlock was, and had always been, a beautifully strange man with a spectacular brain lost in a world that didn't understand him.
"Well spotted doctor." Sherlock rubbed his hands together excitedly and arched an eyebrow as the whole of it dawned on his star pupil. "Where indeed?"
He started with a delicate lapping to Sherlock's corona and a swirling press to his frenulum. Paying special attention to the silky face of Sherlock's glans. Tonguing the slit. Laving the shaft. Before taking it all into his mouth.
"And as these fair and just people stand here today in witness to this ordinance, if anyone, whatever their social status may be, dares directly or indirectly oppose this decision, will find themselves transgressors against the Crown and in so doing will be found guilty of the crime of high treason and will not only incur our grave indignation as well as the punishment of the already condemned, but also a much more final and exacting sentence."
"Could be a rebound that didn't work out." Molly squeaked, speaking up. "Maybe this second victim just couldn't fill the hole left by the first one. Couldn't live up to the expectations, even if they did look the same?"
That, plus the fact that his arm was starting to complain with the strange contortions and that his fingers were too short to find that perfect place up inside him that Sherlock had been able to find it so easily last night. His long thin fingers able to reach deep, while that magic spot for John seemed to remain stubbornly just out of reach.
The length of Sherlock's pacing wicked down to a small trail right behind John's chair, the breadth of the front of the kitchen. He kept snatching glances over at the picture of the specimen, willing it to knock an idea loose. "Irrelevant. This fish was completely alone. It was being held in what they term a 'hospital" tank. A completely barren holding aquarium in which they monitor stress levels and the relative health of the fish until it's deemed fit to move into its intended display."
John squinted at his dark curls more closely, trying to find the angle. He pushed the issue further. "So were you going to have them out today? I can find you a box to put them in, maybe give Molly a call--" anything to move the process along.
"In a way. Eric preferred me sober, I preferred the cocaine. I was able to think properly while high. I had perfected my solution to a concentrate of seven percent, an amount ideally suited to..." but he trailed off, as this wasn't about /that/ aspect of his life and John had been keeping his promise about not passing judgement. Sherlock cleared his throat and tried again. "Eric came to his decision to separate when a murder took place at a pub we frequented. I had been inclined to utilize my methods of deduction, such as they were.
But despite this, brother Michael was the only one left in the castle that truly knew Sherlock. And therefor was the only one who could save him.
He came back to himself as the sitting men began to rise to their feet, realizing too late that his gaze had fallen on Sherlock and had left him staring blankly into the middle distance. But if the detective noticed this at all, he gave no indication.
He knew he shouldn't be reacting like this, but he couldn't help it. His breath quickened, his vision darkening, and the cold rush of pure oxygen burned its way into his lungs.
"Sherlock?" He knocks on the bedroom door before heading in without hearing a response. "Are you planning on getting up anytime within the next century?" John asks when the door closes.
Sherlock was fully dressed in all black, leaving only the pale root of the back of his neck and long, curled hands exposed to the caustic kitchen light. His ramrod posture and the stark beauty that was Sherlock Holmes in his element did nothing to dissuade John from dropping a kiss to the crown of his head as he passed, thrilled at the pleased hum he received in return.
John ate his breakfast slowly, deliberately, ready to snap at any indication of being rushed. But Sherlock sat silently and occupied himself with counting the number of bites John took before swallowing and the approximate volume of coffee necessary in each sip to wet his palate. John ignored him completely, like he was a ghost, scowling at the wall the whole time. And Sherlock's ear twinged something awful.
Almost as if he noticed what it was that he had revealed, Sherlock's shoulders softened and his face sobered immediately. His body becoming physically smaller as he took a step away, giving John space to stop tilting back over the chair.
"Right." John had snorted. "You do know that's a recommended night's sleep for normal humans, right?"
"Oh no. Nonononono." John growled, tightening his grip on the ice-cold fabric and the freezing arm beneath and leading him towards the ambulance. "After Sherlock. You can look at it /after/."
John's head snaps away from their guest and he apologizes while groping for the remote. He knows in his bones what this is about. They'd only been waiting for it.
John lays his head back against his chair and tries to swallow down his vulnerability. With nothing more than words Sherlock has once again flayed him wide and found new depths. He to himself is a terrain undiscovered and it's taken  someone as brilliant as Sherlock Holmes to traverse him, expose him, and relate back to him in the most intimate of ways.
The thrush regarded all this with casual disinterest. Having seen this scene remain unchanged as it was most mornings and moved on through the solar to the adjacent room. Where it sensed the occupant it sought resided.
"A ten marries a ten. Seven to a seven. I'm still pretty sure that's how the world works." John chuckled, palming the back of his own neck with embarrassment. "So that's, uh, exactly what I thought, actually. Sorry." He just failed to even consider someone from a lower class to even have been a candidate on the radar to the man who felt that all of humanity was beneath him. "Keep talking though. I want to know more."
A pair of twin windows were set into the wall at John's right, their open tombstone-shaped bodies letting in a heaven's worth of crystalline morning light.
Mycroft leaned back into his seat, relenting against John's ire. "Who my brother chooses to be with is of importance to me, of course. It is well within my right to know when he is being taken advantage of."
John bowed obligingly as he showed the client out the front door, Sherlock having made his salutations from the threshold of the flat. Asano-san said something to John with a small smile, the only one he'd seen the whole visit, and handed him a small white card. He bowed again and turned towards an idling car at the kerb and was gone.
Seeing no other option available to him, John set his jaw and dutifully downed the tea. One grimaced mouthful at a time.
John trailed behind Sherlock and did his own investigation of the body. The man was wearing a decadent bespoke, like the others, which had failed to lose its beautiful lines despite being water-logged. His jacket and shirt had been pulled open, exposing a fit but pale and completely unflawed body beneath. The killer had apparently not needed any organs from the man's torso, it seemed.
"What?" Sherlock breathed. Perhaps John thought he was sullied now. What if tonight was ruined by what he had witnessed?
John allowed himself a moment to admire Sherlock's naked torso at the same time Sherlock paused to consider a new shirt with his hands planted aesthetically on his hips. Each man proximally aware of each other, yet neither willing to break the voyeuristic moment.
He coaxed Sherlock up into a sitting position with a hiss from the pale detective. There was blood on the armrest and John set his jaw and swept back the hair from the left side of his face. "Jesus Christ Sherlock!" He bellowed at the sight of it. "What the fuck happened?"
He meets Mrs. Hudson on the front step coming in, her hands free of the rubbish sack she'd just taken to the bins. "Oh! John! Where are you off to?"
Riding three days nearly non-stop on very little food made his bones feel brittle. His stomach hollow. And his head throb in a way that made even the torch that William lit upon the wall be too bright for his eyes.
"Sherlock. Stop ignoring me." John prompted, snagging his wrist to keep him from leaving, becoming even more confused as Sherlock simply leaned in and pressed a devout kiss to the top of John's head, holding his face there. "A new list for what?"
Testing, John kissed him, pleased to feel Sherlock not hesitate to reciprocate and with the encouragement, John's loose arm began to rake trails down the side of Sherlock's torso. Combing his fingers over the ripple of Sherlock's ribcage, into the valley of his waist, and up onto the hillock of his pelvis, stroking it with his thumb. He pressed his body in closer, his own penis warming between them with the prospect of another go.
"It is not your fault John Watson." He whispered, with a voice pitched as deep as bubbling oil. He led John's hands together and transferred them both to one of his, wrapping five long fingers around John's small fists as he brought his freed hand up to his mouth and sucked liberally on his first two fingers. Shoving them nearly to the back of his throat.
"Hannibal Lecter was supposed to have been taking MAOIs for his personality disorder during the time he told Clarice Starling that line. And, as you well know by being a doctor, patients taking these medications are put on restrictions concerning high-tyramine foods; specifically liver, beans, and red wine, in the event that such a combination can prove to be fatal.
"Gah--Shrrrlo--" John was squirming with anticipation now, writhing in embarrassment, the veins in his neck standing out as he fidgeted. He was waffling on the precipice of a brand new world of satisfaction and the guilt of taboo, and he made his final decision in a breathy, choked voice: "Yes. Please."
It was not until William (a month after the Battle, after the Lady of the Manor had finally died and all the property she oversaw been inherited by her son the new Lord of the Manor to oversee) had finally drummed up the courage to pay his respects to John's surviving family only to stumble upon a heartache so piercing that he had fallen to his knees upon the doorstep.
Sherlock makes to settle in at his side, but John interrupts him. "No. C'mere. Give me your head. I haven't apologized yet for what I've done to you."
Meanwhile, once the women had finished their portions of stew, Harriet and Clara had gotten to work digging up the chest they had buried all those months ago in the ground, while John hovered somewhat fretfully at their side.
"Oh, brilliant. So us ...snogging? That was, what? Just data gathering?" John couldn't help the sharp edge his whisper took, about to be incredibly cross should it turn out that Sherlock had been using him.
As amusing as the thought was now, the bout of madness itself had been rather scary. He still  remembered waking up on the thousandth day of his imprisonment in the same bed in the same solar staring up at the same canopy and realizing with utter clarity that he no longer had the will to live.
Sherlock palmed the left cheek of John's arse and slid his hand up until it met the crook of his knee, pushing his leg back against his belly. John resisted him for a moment, in his last throes of disbelief, before allowing Sherlock to fold it up against his torso, taking the hand tangled in his hair to hold it in place and then did the same with the other.
This must be King Mycroft and Lord Gregory, John thought, as he passed them by. The true men who ruled here.
"It's nothing. Just be a minute." John reassured them. "Molly? Where do you keep your first aid kit?" He asked. He was directed towards the scrub room on the other side of the double doors, the ones she'd come through carrying the circular bone saw earlier, and drug Sherlock through it.
"It is useful if I don't want to be found." John said, closing one eye against the dying sun. By his estimation, he had slept for far longer than he had intended to, recuperation still seeming to be a heavy burden for his body and darkness came swiftly in the spring. "But I am no hero."
When she had come back, she was hauling a yellow caravan. It was bumped and dinged and the door stuck a bit on the hinges. But it had four complete walls and a roof that didn't give him a view of the sky.
Sherlock imagined he could feel every muscle as it was shredded from the bird's bones in his own body. Pulled apart in strings of red and pink.
"It was a gift from my brother on my sixth name day." Sherlock provided. He stared at it as a wash of memories poured through him. He remembered the squeal he'd given at opening the box and seeing it for the first time, the resulting tantrum he had had when his little arms couldn't pull the heavy thing almost twice his size out, and finally the absolute joy when he had been set up in a tall chair, his knees pressed into the instrument's wide waist, and he could still recall with perfect clarity that pure and blissful sound when he pulled the bow across its gut-strung strings. How proud his parents had been of him then when they had been alive. His brother standing by his side.
"Retention of its skin suggests the corpse has not been in the water all that long. Algor mortis has barely begun, so he's not been dead that long either, which immediately rules out accumulated gasses due to decomposing tissue. We're left with only one conclusion: and that is an excerebration.." Sherlock eyes lit up on the last word, seeming to glow.
"Apologies John." He mumbled, standing from his stoop and turning away to cover what John clearly saw was embarrassment on his behalf. "It's been a while since I've had decent company and I've been told I have the tendency to ...blather."
oo5. Eric Crenshaw is the creation of Basser whose story Can't Rewind Now We've Gone Too Far http://archiveofourown.org/works/594142 is part of my headcanon for Sherlock's childhood because it's so damn good.
He sat down with the laptop at the sitting room table and logged onto Sherlock's bank account - the one they shared now since Sherlock hadn't even been aware that John had made an account online for him, and matched up their jar of receipts with the corresponding withdrawals. As he got to the most recent, he frowned.
John let out a flustered burst of laughter, which clenched his anus tightly, as if in a wink. Intriguing Sherlock even more. "No it's not! It's an arsehole. There's nothing interesting about that! Sherlock! Stop."
Sherlock's had mind raced as his brother continued. Trying to gather up all the information he could about Charles, cursing himself for not having paid more attention to the women and men in Mycroft's Royal Court. The most he could remember was that Charles had risen through the hierarchy by blackmail and bargain. Clawing his way to the top upon the backs of others.
John didn't know what to say, what to do, he sat frozen in place, warm tea soaking his chest, staring into those kaleidescope eyes.
He'd resigned himself to return to Baker Street, if only for the fact that he had a shift to do at the hospital in the early afternoon. And he'd just pointed himself in that direction, when his mobile had buzzed.
Sherlock's eyes flashed around the room, taking everything in and when he met John's once more, he smiled like a viper.
"Forced me? It was you, stupid child! What other course of action would you have had me take Sherlock? Hm?" He had hissed, keeping his voice to a menacing whisper with the solar door still open. "You outright refused the crown in my place. In front of the Royal Court! Gregory and I leave in but a fortnight and you would do this to me? To our family?! I will not see any other sigil fly upon our standard. Any name but Holmes sit upon the throne. Do you understand? You were to be the next heir to the Kingdom of Appledore as your forebears have been for four hundred years before you and in one act of rash impudence...an act of absolute stupidity, you have ruined it! You refused to take what was rightfully yours out of some pathetic indulgence of pride! This was the only way to ensure that a Holmes would remain in power should I die...however diminished the capacity. Perhaps this will serve as an important lesson that the things that are necessary are far more important than your trivial wants. It's time to grow up Sherlock. Life is not long enough to waste on dreams."
Belatedly, John had the idea that maybe the answer to Sherlock's 'shyness' was in that folder he'd burned. A clue. John willed himself to stop this nonsense. Maybe he could just straight out ask the man what was going on and be done with it.
The fingers in his arse curled upwards, pushing back against John's flesh from the interior, while Sherlock's thumb on the same hand pressed into the top of his cleft from the other side, just beneath his coccyx. Essentially pinching the thick, muscled skin between his fingertips, giving them a little rub as if he were feeling the quality of cloth. Affecting a sensation that was...it was...
"Lord Sherlock has requested it." William added cheekily, coming down onto one knee and presenting these gifts to John.
From far above there was a desperate yowl and he limped backwards until he could see Gladstone's wrinkled face peering over the cliff side. Her paws stamping at the precipice. He waved his hand and she only yowled harder. Her tiny sorrow brined by the sea.
John pulled a face as Molly finished speaking, while Sherlock managed to look a little tetchy at the loss of evidence.
He teased the silken head with the tip of his tongue, having to sacrifice a hand to prop the wilting prick up now and followed the natural groove of the glans up and down.
William and John slowed their horses, eager to take in all the sights and smells and general racket of what surrounded them. Everything from cart stands to fully erected buildings lined every road and pedaled their wares and services through signs and shouting.
John opened instantly beneath the wet heat, drawing Sherlock in to drink more deeply from his mouth. Inviting him into the possibilities that they may share soon and let Sherlock explore as he chose. He went for the open corners, the margins of his jawbone, the hot air above his tongue.
The look of concern in Sherlock's eyes was only for him, he knew, encircled by the fall of dark curls. So its meaning John took to be genuine. A glance with those eyes and John was made aware of the sweat that had broken out across his forehead and top lip. "Are you alright John?"
The thermometer beeped a few seconds later and Sherlock snatched it out of his mouth, handing it over. "If you're quite finished..."
And John realized with stunning clarity that THIS was Sherlock's vengeance; a play of power between them. A silent declaration that he was reaffirming his position on being a willing, if though unaffected, participant in their continued sex life to backup his words in the bedroom. Not with anger, but with offering.
And it took only a split second for Sherlock to convince himself to execute a plan to keep this man in his life until it became the end of one of them.
The older man had plucked his fawny hairline clear back to the top of his head and powdered his whole face to a spectral white with lead ash. Achieving the high aristocratic brow and pale visage so sought after by royalty. But no matter how much he looked the part; he would always ever be a fraud.
"Selfish?" And Sherlock only grumbled with laughter. A sneer, as sharp and dark as obsidian peeling through his features as his laugh grew in size, horrible and joyless. "Oh John. Is that the best insult you can manage? If you think you are the first to call me this than you are utterly UTTERLY mistaken. And if you truly think this to be the worst of my traits then you are even more of a fool than I took you to be. Yes I am selfish. Selfish among other so many more terrible things."
And in their blinding happiness, neither men deigned to notice that of the twenty-odd-headed flytrap left abandoned on the sink's wet edge to silently witness them; seven of those heads had snapped shut to simultaneously feast upon meals most unnatural to them.
"Been a bit busy lately, what with case you just solved and all. You can't tell me you've already deleted it." John said, trying to break his own tension, finally able to turn. "It's only been a half hour."
Sherlock swallows. His eyes betraying him. He takes a step forward and puts his hands out. "Then take me. Eat me if you like. Feed me to your dog or turn me over to Moriarty. But leave John alone."
Sherlock snorted in further distaste, his mouth curling up into a grimace. "By God's bones, not that. Anything but that." And then it became suddenly clear to John that that is what Charles called him.
"Shouldn't I be the one to ask you that?" Came the rumbling baritone right against his spine. Sherlock touched his lips to his nape and rubbed them back and forth. Not quite in a kiss, but more as if in sensation. To feel. It made goosebumps raise across John's forearms.
But his stomach couldn't and it gurgled another protest to his neglect. Driving him from his office in search of sustenance, a snack to hold him over, but not before he turned the volume knob up loud enough to hear it.
The whole affair had been elegant and lavish, far more oppulant than he felt he deserved, knew he deserved. But it was there that his eyes had fallen upon a creature so breathtaking, so utterly beautiful, that it had shocked his broken heart back to life and rallied his wounded soul far better than time or medicine or any witch's potion could have.
However Sherlock functioned was simply how it was and he would take Sherlock in ANY way he came. Sexually or not. He was still his. He HAD to make him know this.
"Oh, right. Bees." John sits back against the pillows Sherlock's mounded up for him and nods like he should know why that last statement makes perfect sense.
Sherlock's face tightened into a scowl at the walls he was constantly meeting in this maze, unable to get ahead of them. "Additionally, he hires a private company to monitor his aquarium's parameters twenty-four hours a day, perform regular water changes, and the like. They have remote access to water quality readings. Temperature, calcium, phosphorus, nitrates, nitrites, potassium, and ammonia were all verified to be ideal. They e-mailed me his equipments' data for the past three months. A service they provide to all their clients to monitor trends in the water."
Admittedly, if the Met hadn't been standing about and if he weren't absolutely certain he'd get the most barbarous strop as a result of doing it; John would have kissed the selflessly selfish mad bastard on the lips right there and then.
"Oi. One more word, Anderson, and it will make it three!" Lestrade threatened. "And a second opinion's not going to hurt anything. Right doctor? Probably even get this buttoned up quicker." There was an elbow in John's side and he smiled. He always did appreciate Lestrade's generosity. Especially towards the batshit requests of his flatmate.
It was like something was pulling at him. A siren's song that only Sherlock could hear. "I'm going to need blankets." He said finally, taking a step away. "Lots and lots of blankets." And with that, he huffed a white cloud of frozen air, gulped some down, took two leaping steps, and dove straight into the water until nothing could be seen of him.
He shook his head in disbelief, turning to Sherlock and finally opening thundercloud eyes that were glittering with unshed tears. "You were right, the other day, when you guessed about the trajectory...it was too much for the rifle they were shooting us with."
Sherlock and John remained stock still when the door closed, both of them screaming with their eyes at each other, but knowing that the High Steward was cunning and could return at any moment. But the footsteps outside retreated until there was no more sound to be heard.
"Transport, John. Remember?" Sherlock sniffed, his tone reluctant, as if he were testing how angry John really was at him.
"Oh, right. Pub's the wrong circle. Um, well I guess I could take you to a museum then...or Barts?" he winced at the very idea. "All I'm saying is that whatever it is you need. Whomever. IF you should ever...anything. I...am...here...to...support...you."
"Couldn't he have just got it back from the dry cleaners?" John suggested, his voice trailing off as he saw the look come over Sherlock's face.
It had started as a whisper among the crowd. Mouths falling agape as the secret spread, before climbing in volume and growing more damning with each gasp as someone new recognized him and harkened others to see. Some had hid their astonishment behind surprised hands, their eyes wet and afraid as if he were a ghost risen from the ground.
p.s. trigger warnings for gardners in this chapter...I apologize profusely to all you green thumbs for this. I REALLY TRULY do. but I wanted to keep this shit weird...
He was propped half upright against his headboard, his comforter clutched tightly around him, but doing nothing to stop the internal chill that froze his veins. He shivered and shook, deciding that he wouldn't be at all surprised if his bones began to rattle in the mayhem.
"Hello. Welcome. I'm Doctor John Watson. Pleasure to meet you. Detective Sherlock Holmes is upstairs." The words still felt a bit odd to say all together. But he was getting more use to it.
It was the only other thing on his body that he hadn't come into the world with, which was a bit ironic, considering it was very nearly the thing that had tried to take him out. He knew Sherlock had seen it, despite what he said about the tattoo. And he'd fallen asleep roving through all the different questions and statements Sherlock might be behooved to send his way come morning.
"Talk about what?" Sherlock tried to be nonchalant, but when he raised his head, he looked immediately ensnared.
Charles' body would always be so heavy on top of him. So immovable. No matter how much Sherlock fought. The unreal mass of him making it impossible for Sherlock to breathe, let alone break free, only pushing him deeper into the mire.
She looked to her subordinate, who had said nothing throughout the whole proceeding, and she looked utterly disappointed. John assumed she wished to be looking to Lestrade, her favored DI, or even Anderson, for a defending word, and not just a faceless officer to help her if the arrest got difficult. But she got nothing in return.
"After all, it was my first encounter with a dead human body in person and it felt like a natural reaction. Eric, however, did not understand my preoccupation with investigating the facts. He refused to think properly on the matter. It was then that he shut down and turned me away. Preferring to drink. The irony is not lost on me, of course.
"I've already taken care of it. You're being too slow." Sherlock said with a look of distaste. "Come on. Come on!" John didn't know if the detective was refering to him or the incoming cab.
"Right. Strip." He ordered, turning and taking in the stiff but slightly hunched detective whose long arms were wrapped solidly about his sopping chest and whose wet hair was still sending rivulets of water spilling down his face and neck. Sherlock looked at a loss for what to do, standing there soaked to the bone. "All your kit. I want it off. Now."
Dawn had finally climbed high enough to seep in through the window now. Making the solar wall flush with a rose tint. But the bird's strange silhouette still marring the flooding light made the man turn back to the window in confusion. Not understanding why the thrush was tarrying so.
Blocks blurred past in silence. The city just starting to wake. Newspapers were being cut out of their binding and set out, hung on the racks of coffee kiosks. John vaguely wondered if Sipe's name were gracing any of their pages but mostly found he didn't care.
John's eyes were wide, frightened, his lips shaking. He had not told a single living soul about this nightmare he had experienced. But he knew in his bones that Sherlock was the on;y one in which he could confide. This terrible thing that had haunted him forever.
And though he was tempted to turn the honor down that very moment, the privileges that were to come with the title were the only things that stayed his tongue.
John clenched his fist and jaw and tried not to squirm too openly beneath the sting of his words. For everything he spoke of was a lash of truth. He was a fool to think he could ever interfere with royal lineage.
But not long after that, John Watson from Umberland of the North had come into his life and made things right.
He tucked the Stradivarius back under his long chin and John finally caught on. Ah. Of course. He hadn't disturbed anything by his presence. Sherlock had wanted him here. It was simply the first rest that he'd walked into.
He watches Sherlock's face as it shifts from confusion to a steady fear. A fear that John might indeed know what it's like to love someone this deeply and be helpless against it.
The course ginger scraggle that had once been a mess about his face was now shaped and trimmed into a handsome beard and swept-back hairstyle that let his stunning pale features push forth.
The first month of learning to sit with this contraption around and inside him had been tantamount to torture.
"Sometime after you'd left, Mrs. Hudson brought this up, saying a messenger had delivered it." For the sake of hygiene, he opened the envelope to let John see the interior letter.
"Just fire the woman and be done with it." Sherlock's statement seemingly came out of nowhere, yet struck bullseye just as they always seemed to. John never could quite get used to it.
"How come you didn't go to Sarah's tonight?" Sherlock parried again. "Wouldn't you have been welcome?"
It made John wonder what kind of lover he would be. What did he prefer in his partners? Had he ever even made love before? He couldn't imagine that a Prince trapped in a tower could have much chance at romance, but surely he had had the ability to bed whom he pleased.
The mare snuffled at the choice of grass she had beneath the tree and bumped his shoulder unhappily.
"Ouch." Ygritte was snapping on some gloves. "I'm just going to do a preliminary evaluation of the tooth, if I may?" She held up her hands to show her intentions and John reluctantly let her probe into his mouth. He comforted himself by watching Sherlock, who had taken a seat opposite him facing the shut door that they all three had come in through.
His cock pulsed as fond memory broke over him, realizing where these had come from and who they belonged to.
Sherlock, for the first time since they'd moved in together, breeched the threshold to his bedroom and strode up to stand in his space. His hair was wild as if he'd been pulling on it, trying to maximize the space for his brain. His eyes that supernova brilliance of solved mysteries. He took John by the shoulders and guided him back until his knees hit the bed, putting him into a sitting position and pushing the laptop into his chest. "What are you on about? Have you solved it?"
He drew closed the curtains and wandered back over to the hearth, "mind if I put this out?" But Sherlock was too lost in his head, muttering and gesticulating like a mental patient. He filled a large empty beaker from the tap and doused the flames until they sputtered and went dead. He stayed crouched for a moment, watching the simmering embers, reflecting on the past three days with an unabashed amount of amazement.
The entire left side of the man's face had been massacred by fire. The red skin (long since healed) would forever bear the pattern of rain disturbing a pond. He was familiar to John, and yet John did not know why.
"Interested to know how I know?" He pointed to the offending shoulder. "The red discoloration that usually accompanies the hypertrophic keloid scarring with an injury of that particular violence has long since faded. Applying the median time principals for a wound like that with its rate of matrix healing, it can take anywhere from three weeks to almost a year to heal. In your case, as you were honorably discharged back in May, I believe you were postponed in hospital for somewhere close to ...three months longer than expected. But why? Why? What could it have been? Wait, wait. Don't tell me..."
Lestrade eyed Sherlock cautiously before answering. "Tell him there's a head and a body found separated down here. Victim fits the same profile as the others. No identification found in his poncy suit. Same two teeth missing. Residue under the tongue. Blonde. Male. Fit. Late thirties. " He cocked his head, making an educated guess. "Five-foot what? Six? Hard to say without a head..."
Considering this, John laid down on his ear, hearing the gorgeous da-thump da-thump that brought life to the magnificent transport beneath him. Sufficiently calmed. "Alright. I'll keep that in mind."
He took residence between his Veed legs, resuming the hedonistic plunder of the doctor's eager mouth while John finished shucking his shirt, reserving special tenderness for his left arm. Sherlock used his own impossible arms to reach back and beneath, pulling off those hated socks before they disgusted him completely, much to John's amusement. He threw them with contempt at the floor, muttering. "Abominable things."
Through the magnifying glass, John could see that the bottom edge of the cut was smooth, suggestive of having been made with an incredibly sharp knife, possibly even a medical blade in one long, concentrated stroke. Which of course meant that it had to have been performed when the man had been unconscious or even dead, as no signs of a struggle were evident.
As they ushered themselves out, the first of the servants returned, between their hands a fresh swath of linen and that strange wooden object was handed back to the High Steward. There was a shuffle of fabric and a stone of white hot rage dropped bright into John's stomach at the pathetic sound Sherlock made at whatever was happening down there.
Sherlock rocked up onto the balls of his feet, his mind whirling as he completely ignored the DI's request. "If you're to be a consult with him, that means that these two cases are linked. Oh this is BRILLIANT!" He exclaimed, practically yelling. His baritone exaltation echoed loudly off the walls.
At that moment, pathologist Molly Hooper came shuffling into the door, mumbling down at a bone saw in her hand that she was flicking on and off, making the little motor whir and the toothed circular blade spin and stop and spin again.
It was built on a heath that bordered an orchard of trees no one had bothered to identify. Maybe fruit bearing, but who actually cared? Perhaps 'built' was the wrong sort of descriptor for this little imperfect cottage. It looked to be more discarded than anything. Dropped and left to the whims of the edge of the world.
He was unshouldering his coat when Sherlock came stomping back out, barefoot, dressed down in his pajamas and dressing gown and took up a foetal position with a massive thump on the couch. "Bedroom's yours," he muttered petulantly, before slamming his fist into the Union Jack pillow for good measure and burrowing down into the mashed leather.
John places a hand on Sherlock's head and smiles when the man leans up into it like a cat. It's been almost a month since he's gotten his cast off and John can't seem to stop touching Sherlock at every available opportunity. Good thing Sherlock doesn't seem to mind at all. "Divide and conquer hm?" John hums. He threads his fingers through soft curls before taking a bit of a handful. "You will get dressed though, yeah? Before wandering out to the sitting room? The man /was/ witness to a murder after all - well heard one anyway - which you said ranked at about a six, so that at least earns him some trousers wen you get around to it."
He looked down into his scotch. "To make matters worse - and though I still consider them to be wholly pertinent deductions, if perhaps, mistimed - my discoveries resulted in a previously unknown heart condition that had been  manifesting itself in Victor Senior for some time to induce a stroke, which was followed promptly by his death. The black mailer fled soon after and in short, it became the end of Victor and my ...relationship. His father's funeral was to be our final meeting."
For a moment, John had been in awe. That Prince Sherlock would see fit to gift him such fine things after only one day of knowing him . . .
oh noes! poor Miles. I borrowed him for the sheer purpose of beating the shit out of him. shameshame. but he's a necessary plot point so I don't feel too bad.
He's upon them both in an instant, hands clawing at the Union Jack neck man's clothes. Trying to pull him off. Grasp   slipping. Fingers refusing to grip. In a desperate gesture he goes for the soft bits he can reach, just like the military taught him, and he presses his hand into the man's skull and rends.
"Ah Lestrade, how nice of you to join us." Sherlock was saying, adjusting his coat back around his lithe body. "We were just enjoying your indictment on the telly before it was so rudely interrupted. Beautiful day to find another corpse, wouldn't you say? How's Gregson?"
The suit John carefully unfolded was ridiculously nice and it laid down well at the pressed creases. He left the suit jacket open to reveal the large strip of half-missing burnt fabric across the back, still stuck with bits of skin.
"Hmnn." John breathed indiscriminately, having to blink his vision back into focus. He squinted down at Sherlock with one eye pinched shut. Grinning widely. Playing the game. "Anything else?"
The snap of Sherlock's magnifying glass opening and closing resumed as the only sound in the room besides the squealing of his wingtips across the buffered floor. Molly shuffled quietly along behind him, filling out her clipboard in  tight, loopy handwriting with the things she observed herself, while John and Lestrade stepped back to allow them more room.
The sitting room of 221B was almost exactly as they had left it. In organised chaos. With ephemera spread from one side of the loud wallpaper to the other. There was a table buried somewhere under loose leaf papers and laptops and half finished mugs of tea. A pooling collage of data was thumb tacked above the couch; its information rendered useless now that the string of crimes had been solved.
John was discontented at how comfortable brother Michael seemed to be around his house, but after the monk bade him sit and pulled a pre-skinned, pre-jointed rabbit wrapped in a stained linen from his satchel along with a handful of potatoes for stew, he could do little but obey.
And the look he got when those lime green eyes finally met his during that slow press of scooping hips and gentle  caresses that ached in their tenderness was that of Sherlock Holmes giving off some sort of fantastic radiation, and John Watson being the only ordinary man able to absorb it.
'And hurry up. Take the perpendicular street North and then straight ahead from there. You'll know when you've arrived.' - SH
Like his head was a ball of slime, oozing out of every orifice. His nose was plugged, his eyes were weepy, and his ears rang constantly. He had two spears of tissue shoved deep into his nostrils to stem the outflow, balls of used toilet paper crumpled about him on the floor like snowballs. He was unable to do anything but breathe raggedly out of his mouth now.
Blood would flow freely down his sharp chin, failing to soil the clothing of feathers that still enveloped the rest of his body. And too quickly, he would be upon him! Dismissing the King's corpse entirely in favor of taking hold of Sherlock's arms. Trapping his hands at his sides as he licked into Sherlock's open mouth which had been open to cry out.
When John confessed that he had a limited knowledge on the subject, Miles began interrogating him about what it was exactly and why it happened. The different kinds. Wanting John's professional medical opinion, slight though it was. He danced around rhabdomyosarcoma specifically, until John finally asked straight out what his own experience concerning it was, which made the conversation blossom into an explanation of why Miles had suddenly decided on publishing his book. He said that it had been based on what he described as both the best and worst week of his life.
King Mycroft was granting John knighthood for his bravery in service to the crown. And because he had not had to climb through the ranks of being a page to being a squire to become a knight and, in fact, having had absolutely no weapons training to speak of beside minor adolescent scuffles, his title was to be purely honorary.
"What John is trying to convey, is that the pusher has made himself a convenient human grab bag, in which he can simply /root around/ and take whatever it was that he liked. He managed to camouflage such an indignity by hiding it in plain sight, thus, ignoring all the moral practices of 'do no harm'. He felt confident enough with this murder being caught on video that he suspected there would no reason to investigate internally." His tone, as he said it, was only slightly mocking.
They had known each other as children; the young Prince Sherlock having come often to call on the priest-in-training to have great debates concerning philosophy, religion, and alchemy and how it translated into the world around them. They could lose hours at a time in friendly discourse, wandering around the catacombs beneath St. Bartholomew's Church by candlelight or hiking the unexplored secrets of Baskerville Forest.
Not sure a ribbing was the best choice in prompting dialogue, John trundled on. "I'm not saying I mind, but I'd just...it's a bit...I WANT to help you, Sherlock. However I can. If I can. But you have to tell me. Just talk to me. What's going on?"
A few other industrious birds were picking the ground for snails and worms, tiny curls of insects that had been drawn out by the dew, but otherwise steadfastly ignored the thrush. Content to make the most of their own business.
"I'm not interested." Sherlock interrupted bluntly and tried to maintain his hard look. It lasted all of about seventeen seconds however, because his frown kept cracking with worry. "So, you would concede that you didn't like him then?"
John felt a deep sense of gratitude and contentment overcome him as he settled down into his chair. Sherlock remained in the kitchen, picking through the grocery sack, but not really putting anything away. He cracked open the biscuits and took one in his teeth, sucking the chocolate taste from them until they became a mush in his mouth. Discarding it after it changed texture.
