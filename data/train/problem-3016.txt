Cas says something in reply before he hangs up. Dean doesn’t know what it is because he can’t hear jackshit over the ringing in his ears, and he can’t think thanks to the pressure constricting his lungs.
“Am I hurt?” he echoes. He’s startled by the bark of laughter that bursts out, how drained he feels afterwards. “Am I—are you kidding me? You’re the one that
“No, it’s good,” he insists, and he actually sorta means it. “I’m glad you’re helping call the shots up there, man. Seriously. Makes me think we stand a chance of getting it right this time.”
“Told me what?” Dean mutters, rubbing the sore spot on his temple. Without hesitating, Cas closes the remaining distance and cups Dean’s face in his palm. The ache behind his forehead eases. Dean’s heart heaves unsteadily in his chest.
Dean’s morning, so far, has been a big improvement on the one before it. For one thing, it started in a bed—his bed, memory foam mattress, clean sheets, the works. There’s no headache threatening to blind him. His back’s still sorta sore, prickling like an old bruise when he moves, but everything feels warm and hazy, draped in a layer of sleep.
Sam’s his own person, for chrissakes, he handles witches better than Dean does and Eileen’s out there with him—if he had to choose between two legacy hunters and some jackass with an ego trip, Dean knows which one he’d put money on.
Dean stares at him, taking in the outline of Cas’s body as he swallows around the lump in his throat. Even here, in a dark kitchen, Cas’s eyes glint with something he can’t parse. His coat is rumpled and his hair’s a mess, the way Dean remembers from those early days; he’s probably all ruffled because he flew here. Now he’s flying out again, the same way he always does. Some things never change.
Dean showers for a long time, until the water’s turned cold and his skin’s stopped itching. He towels his hair dry in front of the mirror. He brushes his teeth with his index finger. Eventually he figures he should just rip the band-aid off—so he opens the bathroom door again, boxers and t-shirt sticking to the damp spots on his back.
The truth is, Dean’s a natural at sacrifice. Giving yourself up is easy: the secret is not thinking about it too hard. Don’t panic, just
“Why couldn’t you just stay put ‘til I got there, huh?” he mutters, staring at the whorls of dirt circling the drain. Then he bites his tongue, hard, and squeezes his eyes shut.
“I didn’t lie!” Sam insists. “I told you I was going out of town for a few days, which I am, I told you I was meeting Eileen, which I am—”
“I think we should stick to one death between us per year,” Sam says. He sounds riled, like he’s pinching the bridge of his nose. “Dean, just listen to me—”
, but Cas’s book-free hand ends up in his hair, scratching gently, and it feels so good that Dean leans into it without really thinking too hard, hooking his chin on Cas’s shoulder and nosing his throat.
He sits up wrong, somehow; jolts his body in a direction it really, really doesn’t want to go. Sparks start spitting down the length of his spine. Dean hisses through his teeth, one hand flying to his back, and freezes still when his hand makes contact with the familiar, unmistakable feeling of gauze under a bandage.
and he remembers coming to in the Impala’s backseat, facedown on the scratchy shock blanket they save for emergencies with Sam’s clammy hands clinging to his forearm. Nothing in-between but white noise.
The space between Lawrence and here is heavy. Dean’s life, despite his best efforts, is one big knot, held together with twine and packing tape; move any part of it, no matter how small, and you move all of it.
Dean shuts his eyes. He opens them again and crosses the room so he can lay the body down on the bed furthest from the door. He winces, rubbing the back of his neck, before moving closer to make sure it’s fully on the sheets. Forces himself to tuck two fingers under the chin and count down from sixty, then back up.
“And if he hadn’t?” It’s the kind of low snarl that always reminds Dean of that night in Bobby’s kitchen, ten years ago; Cas’s eyes glint as he stalks forward, boxing Dean in against the Impala’s hood. “If he hadn’t brought me back, where would you be, Dean? What would’ve become of you?”
Everyone’s careful with Dean, these days. If it’s not Sam’s puppy eyes watching him limp around the bunker or the sympathetic glances from strangers at the grocery store, it’s the package that showed up at their PO box in Lebanon about a week ago, no return address but Jody’s neat block capitals on the front: some socks, two packs of prescription painkillers, and a lumpy sheet cake wrapped in foil, with the words
The hot shower helps. So does drinking half a bottle of water in one go, chased down with painkillers and one of the rabbit food granola bars Sam keeps pointedly leaving on his nightstand. Eventually, moving stiff and slow, Dean pulls on sweats and a clean shirt and follows the hunch tugging him towards the library—where, sure enough, he finds an angel of the Lord slouched in the good armchair, drinking nuclear-strength coffee and squinting at the book in his lap.
“Not entirely.” Cas’s mouth brushes his forehead, lightning quick, before he gets to his feet. “I believe Sam’s stubbornness also plays a part.”
Later, Dean decides, he’s gonna pick those words apart until he figures out what’s going on underneath. For now Cas has boxed him against the door and he's fixing him with that intent, unwavering look, the one that says,
He already regrets letting go of him. He risks an upward glance, eyes flicking from Cas’s tousled hair to the painfully open expression on his face, the healthy flush on his skin. Angels don’t have pulses you can track, in Dean’s experience. They don’t sleep like the literal, actual dead for eight hours. Dean says it anyway, because he needs an answer from the only source on this he trusts. He needs to hear it out loud.
Cas pulls back to watch him, his eyes tracing Dean’s face. They don’t move anywhere else. The reality of what he’s offering jumps out between the lines and smacks into Dean like a speeding train.
There’s a part of Dean that will never, no matter what, stop looking over his shoulder to check Sam’s safe behind him. It rears its head after Cas hangs up, sinking sharp claws into his stomach.
Sam’s scowl darkens. Dean beams and pushes himself to his feet, ruffling Sam’s hair on his way to the door.
The room’s cramped. There’s a heater wheezing in the corner and a fluorescent light which flickers dully when Dean tugs the cord. The sheets are white. Or… okay, they
And it’s a good thing he did, since Dean lived up to expectations. Castiel knows him, and knows him better than most—he knows Dean’s defining quality, above all else, is breaking his word. He knew, so he adapted. That’s all.
He smacks the keyboard, tapping the power button again and again with his other hand. Sam’s stupid, know-it-all voice rings forebodingly in his ear:
“Sam didn’t ask,” Cas murmurs. He reaches out and adjusts Dean’s shirt collar, smoothing a stray corner back down with his thumb. “I offered.”
“Nah,” Dean says. Cas’s hand is brushing his on the couch. Without looking, Dean takes it. “Trust me. I’m all set.”
With any luck, their big blowout fight will happen tonight. They can get it out the way while he still feels like crap, everybody can air their grievances, yell some shit they’re not proud of, then retreat to lick their wounds ‘til morning. Twelve hours from now they’ll be on the road back to Kansas. He won’t have to think about it.
“Anyway. The cow thing.” Dean shakes some grounds out of the bag. “Get this—three per month, every month, all year, all in the same zip code—”
Cas goes quiet, the way he does when he’s got a point to make. Dean beats him to it before he can get started.
“I know what you said,” Cas says, stepping closer ‘til he’s directly in Dean’s orbit. He’s dressed old school tonight: trench, wrinkled slacks, white collared shirt and tie. First time he’d stayed over, Dean had talked him into borrowing some sweats and an old Black Sabbath shirt, but he hasn’t seen either of them since. Cas just keeps showing up like this, all suited up like he’s ready to stop an apocalypse. He’s even got his tie on backwards.
He figures it’s the rum that gives him the courage to do it; the rum, or how late it is. Dean sneaks a glance across the table, throat dry, before looking back down. Hell, maybe it’s the way Cas looks in his clothes. Soft and approachable, like he belongs here.
Cas nods. Dean’s sort of hoping he’ll start it, ‘cus he can usually rely on Cas to give in first—but Cas apparently has other ideas, and his ideas involve being a dick, because he only moves close enough to close the distance halfway.
“You need rest.” Cas’s voice would sound pleading, maybe, if you took away all the fury and frustration piled on top. “You shouldn’t be pushing yourself, you’re not—”
,” Cas repeats. Like he’s thought all this through before, a hundred times, and still reached the same conclusion.
The bunker’s quiet. Can’t be later than six, seven at most. With any luck, he can squeeze another hour in before Sam starts lumbering around in the bathroom a few doors down—and he’s almost out, his awareness just starting to drift, when the back of his neck prickles.
“Why didn’t you just tell me all this crap to start with?” he mutters, scrubbing a hand across his face. Sam makes this disbelieving, incredulous scoff of a sound that gets on his nerves.
“I, uh.” Dean clears his throat. He scrubs his free hand through his hair. “You can bunk with me, if you want. The sheets on that thing are nasty.”
Sam crosses the room. He folds himself in the armchair facing the couch. He cracks the tab on the beer in his hand, taking a long sip. Then, finally, he looks Dean in the eye.
He doesn’t really know what he’s trying to ask. Cas manages to translate it anyway: he shifts on his feet, leaning in and closing the distance between them until it’s gone. Their noses brush in the dark. Dean exhales, tilts his head, and tries again.
“I chose this,” Cas murmurs. Their noses brush when he ducks closer. “This is not an atonement, for the things I've done. I want to be here.”
“Check out’s at 10,” she says. Dean nods, just once. She’s barely done talking by the time he’s out the door.
The look on Cas’s face makes him wish he’d never said anything. In fact, he wishes today hadn’t happened at all. Dean wants to blink and go back to the beginning, warm and drowsy with Cas’s hair in his mouth and one knee wedged somehow between Cas’s legs.
The memories shift into focus all at once: the vamps, the fight, the barn. The sudden, flaring pain in his back. Knowing he was…
“Up and at ‘em, sleeping beauty,” he mutters, pulling the door open and climbing into the backseat. The body slumped against the opposite window doesn’t move. Looking at it is like a knife in Dean’s throat, pointed straight down, so he stops doing it.
. And now he’s here, crammed in a crappy motel shower with water spraying down on his bowed head, alive and whole for another day with nothing to show for it. Not empty handed, but pretty damn close.
“Sorry,” Dean blurts out, which feels like a pretty stupid thing to say, once he’s done it: too clumsy for the point he wants to make, but too small to encapsulate whatever it is that Cas brings out in him. The feeling that lives behind his ribs.
Dean clears his throat. He shrugs off Cas’s hand, glancing back at the messy spread of research notes on the table.
“Couldn’t sleep,” he admits. He jerks his head at the laptop on the table, scratching the back of his neck. “Found us a hunt, at least. Looks like a crocotta.”
“Yeah, I do.” Sam’s voice is beyond flat. Dean can hear the eyeroll. “You would’ve flipped out, insisted on coming with me, and then… I don’t know, dude, got yourself chewed by a rugaru or something.”
his dad used to say, glancing at Dean’s reflection in the rearview—which was Dean’s cue to recite back,
No more rum before bed, he decides hazily. No more rum, ever, actually. Rum always does him dirty. Dean squirms, trying to get his bearings: ten fingers, ten toes, all accounted for. One leg on the couch, and one dangling off it. His back hurts like a bitch, but that’s probably what he deserves for pulling stunts like this past forty. Sam’s in the room, somewhere—he can hear him breathing and feel his stare. The back of his neck prickles.
He hangs up, turns his phone off, shoves it deep into his pocket—and then he tips his head back, eyes closed and breathing hard.
“Right,” Sam says slowly, drawing the word out. “Well, I just dropped Eileen off at her place. She’s in Denver, I should make it back around ten.”
Maybe it’s psychosomatic, maybe not—but Dean swears he can actually feel it, now he knows what to look for. A warm, transient otherness in the center of his back, sewn behind his ribs. He clears his throat.
“Dean Winchester,” Cas says lowly. Dean knows that voice. It’s the voice Cas likes to use before he throws things into doors.
He can handle quiet. He can handle being alone. The difficulty, in Dean’s experience, comes when all that stuff collides. It’s echoey enough in the bunker when there’s two people living in it, but every noise carries tenfold without Sam as a buffer—even the TV sounds wrong. It’s too much like desperation, like Dean’s trying to make a dent in the silence. In the end, there’s only one pastime that doesn’t make his skin crawl: pulling out his tape collection and humming along to Houses of The Holy, his head ducked under the Impala’s propped hood.
“Just… do what you need to do,” Dean mutters, shoving his hands in his pockets and keeping his eyes fixed on the library’s scuffed floorboards. Cas doesn't say anything. A brief rustle cuts the silence, like a breeze rippling through leaves.
Sam huffs out a laugh. He scrubs his shirt sleeve over his face as he pulls back, clearing his throat.
At first, he tries to figure out—through the weird shoulder touching or the unreadable expression on Cas’s face—whether he said that out of interest or pity, but if Cas feels sorry for him, he doesn’t let it show. He just meets Dean’s eyes and holds his gaze, steady and expectant.
and Cas says his name again in that low, concerned voice that makes Dean want to bolt. He tips his head back, forcing himself to breathe.
do you ask? He quit one night stands a long time ago. Even if he hadn’t, this isn’t how you act with someone who's gonna leave the morning after.
“Sorry,” he grits out, trying to swallow the hitch. Cas just dips his head again, brushing his mouth over Dean’s temple. He doesn’t smell like something dead. Ghouls, revenants; you can smell it on them, this close, a telltale sticky-sweetness that always makes Dean's stomach turn. Cas smells like sleep and the spare clothes at the bottom of Dean's duffel.
He sways forward unsteadily and tips his forehead onto Cas’s shoulder. When Cas sighs, he can feel it reverberate.
In one sweeping motion, the mountain of covers next to him rises like a wave. Cas pushes himself upright, squinting as he emerges, his flushed cheeks catching the light of Dean’s table lamp. His shirt says, in faded gray capitals,
but someone tugs his phone out his hand, careful but firm. He hears Cas’s voice from behind him saying, “coffee would be appreciated. We opened the spare bag.”
“It’s, uh. It’s in Texas.” Dean clears his throat, scuffing the floor with his sock. “Montgomery County. Fucker’s holed up in an abandoned house grabbing high schoolers, they only found the nest ‘cuz the city sent an exterminator in.”
“Look, red is for cattle mutilation…” Sam makes a rapid beeline for the door, so Dean chases after him, talking as he goes— “Green means break-ins, and the blue crosses, those are—”
“Dean,” Cas says. He reaches out like it’s no big deal, brow furrowed, brushing his thumb over Dean’s cheekbone. Dean lets out a strange, shuddering breath that feels too big for his lungs. “Are you hurt?”
Baby is right where he left her, hidden in the corner of the parking lot. Dean lets out a long breath. Runs his palm along the cool metal hood and stays there for a second.
“It had already fed,” Cas deduces. His thumb dips lower, circling Dean’s collarbone. Want skitters around in Dean’s chest; he keeps his cool, doesn’t lean into it, but it’s a close thing. Real close.
Dean frowns. He fidgets, trying to drag the comforter back over them, but there’s nothing to drag. It’s shrunk in the night to a single corner, draped pitifully over his legs. It slides away when he sits against the headboard, scrubbing his face with both palms.
“You have a remarkable aptitude for impulsivity,” Cas says. “Maybe you… failed to think things through.”
The world hasn’t ended. That isn’t to say it won’t try again. They're staring down the barrel of a nine hour drive and whatever sleep Dean scrapes together tonight won’t be enough to make it easy—but he lays down on his side of the worn mattress without a fight, exhaustion creeping into him the second his head hits the pillow. The bed creaks when Cas settles on it. Dean drags his eyes open so he can look at him, face to face in the dark. Before he can chicken out, he hooks one ankle over Cas’s calf and tugs. Cas looks tired, too. He’s got circles under his eyes, dark enough that Dean could trace them with the pad of his thumb. That’s all right. He figures they’ve both earned some downtime.
“Dean, you literally died.” Sam puts his juice down so he can massage his temples. “Like… two weeks ago.”
“Woah, woah, woah,” Dean says, scrambling backwards against the couch cushions. “Listen, in my defense—we were—”
Cas tilts his head, considering. His eyes flick from the yellowing pillowcases on the bed by the window to the near-identical set on the bed by the door. Dean swallows.
Cas kisses him slow and matter-of-fact. He lets Dean tug him closer with two hands fisted in the front of his shirt, muffling the noise that escapes Dean’s mouth so the rest of the world can’t hear it. Cas settles one hand on his back, not bothering the bandages there but not avoiding them, either; he lets Dean stand between his legs and wind his arms around Cas’s neck with a sigh so quiet it barely carries, even in the kitchen’s hushed silence, broad shouldered enough to take Dean’s weight—and yeah, shit, maybe Dean’s missed him a little. So what?
, glowing warmly from the inside out thanks to the lingering taste of spiced rum. “Just another angel perk, huh?”
“Dean,” Cas interrupts. The line of his mouth has softened, exasperated but fond. “Do you really think that’s why I’m here?”
He takes another sip of the weird green concoction he’s decanted into a water bottle, leaning against the door jamb with an expression Dean doesn’t like—pursed lips, furrowed brow, eyes narrowed to slits. It’s the same look he gets when he’s translating something. The back of Dean’s neck prickles.
“Hey,” he says, dropping into the chair opposite Dean. He says it weirdly, stretched into two syllables:
“Why do you think I’m angry with you?” Cas demands. Concerned, curious, soft and low. Dean’s heard that voice from him before, a lifetime ago.
“You’re gonna check,” Dean explains, sliding a new card off the stack sat between them. “Which means you either don’t want those cards, or you don’t want ‘em yet. You’ve already paid your blinds twice, so that’s twenty bucks on the table. If I raise the stakes and you match me, that’s another twenty five. If I raise you again after the next card comes down, I’m gonna bet you’ll back out—or you’ll match me, then back out when I raise you double. Either way, I’m winning the hand.” He lays the ten of spades down on the table, meeting Cas’s eyes with a grin. “And you’ve paid for my motel room.”
“You… earlier,” Dean finishes, lamely. He can feel his cheeks going red. “You said I’d mess ‘em up, but I don’t have any. I thought that was the whole point of, you know. Angel healing.”
It doesn’t make sense that it can hurt, hearing someone say your name. Dean’s got a voicemail on his phone from two years ago, Cas asking for a lift back from a library in some small town Dean’s forgotten the name of—all the times he’s heard it, it’s never stabbed him in the gut like this. There’s some weird psychology word for it, probably. Sam would know what it is.
“Sam and the kid, they’re gonna find out.” Dean swallows. “Or… figure it out, and we’ll have to—and I’m, you know, I’m not. I won’t be...”
“Yeah, well, I don’t want help,” he retorts, shrugging away from Cas's touch, “I want both of you to stop treating me like I’m some dumb kid, and I wanna go back to doing my job, all right? That’s it.”
“Hey,” Sam says, exasperated. “Jeez, finally, I’ve been calling for like twenty minutes. You all right?”
The air feels colder away from the door. Cas’s eyes follow him, but his body doesn’t move. Dean’s hands hurt. It’d help to hold something between them—a shirt, or a towel—twist it up and force the tension out. A safer, cleaner outlet than punching something. He keeps his arms by his sides, staring at the floor again. His fingers twitch and ache.
“Currently?” Cas frowns, looking contemplative. He pushes his fingers into Dean’s hair. “No. After your brother is finished with you… I find it hard to say.”
. It’s tugged down over one shoulder. Dean reaches out and pulls it back up, swiping his thumb over Cas’s exposed collarbone as he does—it’d be easy to sling one thigh over Cas’s lap and settle there, easy to push him onto the sheets and doze with his head on Cas’s chest. Maybe he could steal back some of the body heat he’s been hoarding all night.
A dark cowlick of hair flops over his forehead. Dean's mouth twitches—and Cas must see it because he tilts his head, his furrowed brow deepening into a frown.
“I’m a grown man with a stab wound, Sam, I can take naps whenever I want.” Dean winces, leaning one hand on the couch arm as he gets to his feet. His back has some shit to say about all the sudden movements he’s making but whatever, he can deal. “You got money for gas?”
“How the hell did I miss this?” he growls, slamming the hood shut. There’s a sigh from behind him, then a rustle. He’d bet the last ten bucks in his wallet Cas just crossed his arms.
“There goes all the hot water,” Dean murmurs, stretching both arms up over his head. His back twinges right in the center, where the dressing is wrapped around his ribs. Dean winces with a grimace—and in the same instant, two fingers press gently under his jaw, tilting his chin up. The pain slips away into nothing.
The acerbic edge to his voice hits from the left field. Dean turns on his heel, surprise roiling unpleasantly in his gut.
Despite the rain, Sam’s true to his word—gone within the hour, headed out in a Jeep from the garage’s car stash that vaguely reminds Dean of the ones in Jurassic Park. Dean doesn’t wave him off, since he’s not a lonely widow or a woman over sixty, but he does make himself another coffee and lean back against the war room table, trying to ignore the silence and the ache in his back.
Dean’s initial feeling is a bright, giddy rush of adrenaline. His second is shock. The third feeling, slamming into his chest like a gunshot, is also shock.
“Dean.” Cas steps forward again, getting close enough to touch—and for a second, Dean looks right at him and has no idea what’s coming next. He doesn’t know anything at all, except his pulse is thrumming wildly and he wants—he wants to—
“Mhm,” Dean mumbles. Cas doesn’t ask him to move, and he doesn’t move his hand. He shifts slightly, adjusting to Dean’s weight, and turns the page.
The kiss is off-center. It tastes of toothpaste and sleep. Dean grunts, frustrated. The impulsive courage he was relying on to get him this far has started to disintegrate.
He tracked it to the basement of an Illinois church. Not too close to Pontiac, but close enough to make him think that for an ancient-cosmic-whatever, the Empty has a sick sense of humor. He’d stowed his car someplace she couldn’t get towed and left a note for Sam on the front seat. No guns, only old school tactics: a bag of salt in his pocket and Ruby’s knife on his hip.
“Cas,” he says. His voice cracks. From there it's like a fucked up chain reaction—shame spikes in his stomach, lurches into his throat, and makes it impossible to get out anything else. Cas cups his face, fingers curling gently against his jaw, coaxing him forward. Dean gives in once he’s close enough, burying his face in the crook of Cas’s neck again.
“Stop dying on me,” Sam tells him thickly, muffled by Dean’s shirt. “Okay? Just… get a new hobby, freak.”
“C’mere,” Dean tells him, jerking his head—and this is another testament, he likes to think, to the all-encompassing wisdom of being the oldest—because for all the posturing, for all the silence and the glaring and everything else, Sam doesn’t hesitate, and he doesn’t pull away for a long time.
“Signal’s crapping out on ya, Sammy,” Dean says over him with false cheer, and chucks his phone onto the unused bed. He can see the texts come in, one after the other, before the screen’s even had time to blink off. Looking at them makes him itch. Hell, everything itches: his feet, his shoulders, his arms. The dried salt tracks on his cheeks have turned tacky. Dean rubs his eyes again, but it doesn’t help that much.
Dean kisses him, one hand fisted in Cas’s tie. He doesn't plan on it; just follows his impulses and reels Cas in ‘til he’s close enough to touch, fitting his free hand around the back of his neck, tugging him down and licking into his mouth, gentle and slow. It’s easy, after he’s done it once, to dart closer and keep doing it. Cas makes this soft, surprised sort of sound—and Dean decides, kissing his bottom lip, across his jaw, that he’ll do whatever it takes to hear it again. Anything in the world.
The truth is, Dean’s never had many chances to look at his feelings head-on. Even if he’d wanted to, there was always something higher up on the priorities list: food money, gas money, room fees, laundry; blood to mop up, a busted carburetor, a hunt popping up two states over—and always, underneath it all, some kind of high stakes threat lurking in the rearview. Dean has lived, since he was four years old, with dread underpinning his life like a sinister, thrumming heartbeat. At a certain point, he’d figured playing dumb was just self preservation. No point wanting anything when your back’s against the wall.
“Dean,” Cas says. Dean spins unsteadily on his heel, head still buzzing with white noise, and tugs Cas forward by the hem of his shirt, which is actually Dean’s shirt,
Cas loves him, in the worst and most dangerous sense of the word. Dean’s heard him say it and knows he meant it—if he hadn’t, it wouldn’t have killed him. He has no clue what they're doing, but in a few hours Cas will let Dean curl around his back like a comma, and Dean will pull him closer while he sleeps. With any luck, the world won’t end.
That startles a laugh out of him, a real one. Cas is smiling faintly when he pulls back, the way he does when he’s in on the joke, and it’s been a lot longer than six weeks since Dean last saw that happen.
They’ll need to haul ass over there before the house is demolished. Only thing worse than a regular crocotta is a hungry crocotta that needs food and a place to crash. Dean scrubs a hand across his eyes, ready to look up routes and drive times—but Sam’s laptop chooses that moment to fritz out on him, and the screen goes dark with an ominous click.
“The process isn’t dissimilar to stitches,” Cas says, eventually. “I did what I could, but injuries like this have ties to the soul, not just the body. What remains needs to be healed by you. My grace is… filling in the gaps, so to speak, to make that process easier.”
“Because you’re stupid,” Dean hisses, pacing in tight circles across the garage’s concrete floor. “The hell are you trying to do out there, get yourself killed?”
“Yeah, go ahead,” Dean says faintly, and he barely has time to wonder what he’s got himself into before Cas is crouching next to him on his knees, what the fuck, one hand on Dean’s shoulder and the other cradling his jaw—
Dean’s not really sure what went down in the barn. His memory doesn’t have much to offer other than brief, muddy flashes. Sam doesn’t talk about it and Dean knows better than to ask. He remembers something digging into his spine and thinking with shocked, detached clarity,
Sam glares at him. Dean rolls his eyes and heads for the coffeemaker, aiming a loose kick at Sam’s ankles on the way.
He turns his head without lifting it 'til his nose bumps Cas’s collarbone. Here, in the warm hollow between Cas’s shoulder and his throat, it feels safe enough to keep his eyes closed. His lips graze the soft skin there briefly, unintentional; but if Cas minds, he doesn’t show it. He just sets his free hand in Dean’s hair—slow, almost, like it’s an experiment—and starts carding his fingers through it. Dean shudders, clawing at the front of Cas’s shirt and twisting it up in his fists. His eyes are stinging. His face feels over-hot.
“What the fuck,” he repeats, rubbing his forehead. As he speaks, a figure looms from the armchair in the corner and stalks forward. “Sam?”
“That’s your guilty voice,” Dean insists. “Was it the car? ‘Cause I’ll forgive you for anything but the car.” He leans back in his chair, considering. “Or the coffee maker.”
” Dean says loudly. He jerks his head at the smoothie bottle in Sam’s hands. “Now lemme know when you’re done with that and I’ll make us some real breakfast, all right?”
The coffee pot clicks. Dean shuffles through the sheaf of papers he’s holding, frowning at them: the article printouts he’s been going square-eyed over, the map of Arizona he sketched himself. The
“Dean,” Cas says, cutting him off for the billionth time in ten minutes, and his voice finally has enough bite to make Dean’s mouth snap shut.
“It’s not gonna be a one time thing,” Dean croaks. He can’t even tell if it’s a statement or a question. “If we do this.”
“Three,” Dean says. Cas’s thumb is keeping its rhythm, tracing circles over the thin fabric of his t-shirt.
He doesn’t really have an excuse, this time around. He’s just aware that Cas is here and aware he wants to do it, so he does. Dean chases his mouth when it’s over, seeking out Cas’s bottom lip and kissing him before he can get too far. He doesn’t want him out of sight. He wants him right here, at this distance and no further, where Dean can find him without having to reach for it.
It’s been a rough few weeks and a brutal goddamn slog, but he’s done with libraries and occultism for now. He’s traded them in for a new problem: one that sucks, objectively speaking, more ass than libraries and occultism ever have or will.
Jesus, he’s been around… what, five minutes? And Dean’s already found a way to ruin things. He scrubs his face with the back of his hand, suddenly exhausted.
Dean swallows. His eyes flick between the bed where the body was and the spot where Cas is standing, solid and warm in front of him, barely two feet away—alert, breathing, whole. He’s not bleeding. He isn’t walking out the door. He’s wearing a shirt Dean’s owned since 2006 and his hair is tousled from sleep.
He shakes his head. When he moves one hand to wipe his face, Cas’s fingers find his wrist; before he has time to shrug them off, Cas is advancing closer again, pressing him to the bathroom door, and then they’re back where they started.
“...which means they share a function,” Cas is saying, leaning against the counter and frowning thoughtfully at the ceiling. “Depending on the context, some consonants correspond with vowels.” He pauses. Dean hears the faint tinny echo of Sam’s voice over the phone. “Yes, exactly, although Hebrew is more forgiving. There are some books on the subject that could be useful—”
It's surreal watching someone want him this much. Reassuring, actually, ‘til the gravity of it kicks in: they’ve spent nearly two months apart, a decade in each other’s pockets, and in that time Cas has apparently decided that Dean is worth something. All those times he’s caught Cas looking at him, there’s a chance—a good one—that he was thinking about this. He’s seen Dean drunk and hungover and fast asleep; with black eyes, with zits, with razor burn on his chin, and none of that has dissuaded him from doing this. Even if it did, he’s doing it anyway.
Cas’s eyes land on his. Dean meets his gaze automatically, fingers twitching by his sides. He realizes, with a sudden, sickening rush of clarity, that he’s waiting for Cas to follow him.
There’s a bang from outside the living room door—somewhere near the library, if Dean had to guess. Cas pulls away, tilting his head.
Dean swallows. He wants… he wants to say thank you, maybe, or grow some balls and ask Cas what happened two weeks ago, but in the end, all that comes out is: “I don’t
From a distance, Dean hears himself make a sound. It was a word, or trying to be—it gets stuck halfway and catches in his throat. Something’s trying to claw through his ribs and out his chest. He doesn’t know what to do with his hands so they’re stuck by his sides, balling into fists and uncurling again, over and over. Dean blinks hard, willing the burn behind his eyes to leave him alone.
All this to say, Dean knows pain, but the pain of being skewered by a damn piece of rebar, not even taken down like a respectable hunter, that sticks to him, clings to him like an invisible sheen of sweat.
“Ah whatever, as long as she’s having a good time I’m all for it, but I will probably end up fighting a parent or two, they’re already vicious about the team being ‘good’ and it’s like…they’re four.”
Dean has just decided to be a complete coward and leave without telling Cas he was here when Cas, as usual, takes matters out of his hands.  He opens his front door and walks towards the Impala.  Dean considers just leaving, maybe he won’t recognize his car?  Okay, that’s the stupidest thought he’s ever had, and he’s had quite a few.
The hunch in Cas’ shoulders vanishes, replaced by hard, cold, steel-like resolve.  He’s taller now, dwarfing Dean, who’s curled protectively around his heart, self-sabotaging, not allowing anyone to break what was already shattered.
, Eileen laughing to tears when Dean does his yearly choreographed dance to “Hot Chocolate.”  Eileen has been such a perfect addition to their little group, as much a part of the family as Charlie, and she makes jokes that made Dean double over.  Sam looked a little more in love with her every second, and who would’ve thought that a botany club in Central Park on Saturday mornings would have brought them a new person to laugh with and live with and love?
“So, tell me about the LGBT+ community project you’re working on, I know it’s been a while but hey, better late than never.”
“You have a crush on this hot art dealer, and you like, never get crushes on people.  Feeling like you’re gonna die is kinda one of the perks.”
Dean leans up to kiss him and Cas hunches over, pulling on Dean’s hair.  Dean wastes no time, sliding Cas’ boxers down, laughing quietly as Cas violently kicks them across the room, and then he’s moving down Cas’ body, like he did that first night, taking in all the tiny details it would have been a crime to forget.  Cas positively whimpers when his mouth meets the seam of his thigh and his cock.
He was always so effortlessly comfortable in his sexuality, it made Dean’s whole body blush, but he was high and everything else didn’t seem to really matter.  He and Lisa had broken up six months before, and his mind wasn’t as…inhibited as it usually was with the way things were, the way things were supposed to be, and he found himself leaning back into the wall, letting Cas lean onto him, heavy and comforting, the kind of presence you cannot create, something that is formed, that is made.  He let out a sigh, trying to ignore the way his body twitched when Cas ran a heavy hand through his hair.
“Don’t worry about me,” Dean makes an effort to pull his face into a smile, “Can we, can we just enjoy the day?  That’s what all this was for anyway.”
Then they start to play, and Dean forgets how awkward he is and how weird he feels about everything and just watches.  All three of them are so intensely in their element it makes the entire room feel electric, and Dean sings along to all the songs, because he was one of the ones that heard them first.  He’s not a hipster or anything, but he can’t help but feel pretty proud to have loved this band since they started playing in the apartment four years ago, after Charlie and Benny had bet Dean ten dollars that Cas wouldn’t agree to join their band (Dean lost, obviously).
Benny shows them his fingers, which look like he had gone searching for a needle in a stack of needles.  They’re covered in flowery pink band aids.
Eileen shows up around two, smiling shyly and carrying a bottle of wine and a container of roasted carrots that Dean wants to polish off in about ten seconds.
“You have got to stop this.  Go home, try on three hundred outfits, and go get laid.  God knows you need it.”
“Fine, ate way too much, me and Charlie finally met Eileen.  She’s great.  How about you?  Where’re your siblings?”
Cas’ face betrays a little tiny bit of nervousness now, he shifts his weight, looking at the machine next to Dean.
The next morning, Dean gets up hours before anyone else, starting to put things in the oven right at eight am, turning on the Macy’s Parade (he loves it, okay?  Don’t judge.).
The situation was getting truly desperate.  They had moved a few people over to Camp Chitaqua, finally figured out a path that didn’t involve being overrun and torn to shreds by Croats.  They had people working around the clock, trying to make it fit to live in.  Chuck had been one of the first to volunteer.  Cas knew that Dean would be the last one to leave Bobby’s, so he intended to be second to last.
“What’s your name, kid?” the man asks, watching Dean tear into the soup and bread like a man possessed, hunger was a hell of a demon.
“Cas,” Dean look around helplessly for him, hoping that he might take some pity on him.  No such luck however, Cas was simply rifling through Dean’s bag that he had dropped on one of the bar tables, “Get away from that!”
He catches sight of himself in the mirror in Cas’s bathroom and, for a moment, he doesn’t recognize himself.  He recognizes the tattoos that Cas had just spent all those minutes paying attention to, he recognizes his lips, which are swollen and pink, and he recognizes his hair, which is sticking up in all directions, but there are marks that he doesn’t recognize.  They’re purple and red and pink, outlines of teeth, the starts of bruises.  “Love bites.” He had never understood the term before now, he had never been into biting or anything, he and Lisa were far from vanilla, but teeth were used sparingly, never enough to leave a mark.  Even during hookups, it was an area he stayed away from, generally.  But now?  With all these marks covering his skin, from his thighs to his neck, he finally understood the appeal.  He finds himself running his fingers over some of them, enjoying the slight pain the pressure he applied gave, each mark a memory, even though the night was far from over.
Deans heart constricts when he thinks of Sam, who John was always easier on, but he knew how little Sam talked about those years, how he wouldn’t, even to this day, acknowledge their father under any circumstances.
Lego set, and Eileen blushes crimson at the sight of her scarf, leaning forward to give Dean a tight hug that Dean returns, very much loving her right then.  Even Sam is excited for his books, eyes brightening when he hands Dean three new records that Dean had been whining about not having.
Dean rolls his eyes, but there’s no malice to Cas’ words, he looks more concerned than anything else.
“You could come trick or treating with me and Celeste,” Benny leans on the just-cleaned counter.  Dean smacks him with the washcloth.
“It just had all this research, all this stuff on how kids should grow up in an environment that’s quiet and calm and
There are balloons outside of Ellen’s, and a big banner that Dean and Benny had nearly broken their necks hanging the day before.
“Where do you think you’re going?” Cas asks, laying back on the pillows looking like a literal Adonis, with his messed up hair and those shoulders, those arms, those thighs, those eyes.
A moment passes, and Cas reaches into his pocket and pulls out the tape that Dean had given him.  Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx.  Dean flits a smile at him and sets it into the stereo.  “When the Levee Breaks” starts playing gently, and Dean sets to work on Cas’s arm.
Dean didn’t say anything about the drugs anymore.  When he caught Cas high, which was pretty much all the time, he just looked at him.  Once or twice, he thought he saw sadness in Dean’s eyes, but that could just be the opiates making him see things.
Before he can say anything else, before he can bolt straight in whatever direction Cas might be in, the door next to him creaks open, Dean turns, expecting Ellen or Jo or Ash or even Benny, only to see Cas, not in that trenchcoat, not in a tie, but in a flannel and jeans, looking so desperately beautiful that Dean can’t bring himself to move.  This can’t be real, this can’t be real, he can’t really be getting this, getting everything he wanted.  He had never, ever thought he would get anywhere close to peace, to happiness, with Cas taken from him, with words left unsaid hanging in the air.
“You’ll be great, it’ll be great, you know.  It’s for such a great cause, and you’ve worked so hard.  It’s gonna be fine.”
Dean sort of freezes in place.  Meeting Cas’ family.  Cas’ very rich, very upper class, very educated, probably very judgmental family.
“Yeah I mean, I finally got a great job that I like.  Sammy’s off to college at the end of next year.  I’ve got a girlfriend, we’d have the house to ourselves in a couple of years.  I don’t know.  Yeah. I guess.”
“Hi Sam,” Eileen has this really awesomely adorable smile and goes straight for Sam the second she put her stuff down, the size difference is hilarious, Sam is literally like a foot and a half taller than her, but it’s so sweet and Sam is so so so happy that Dean turns a little red and puts Eileen’s carrots carefully in the kitchen.
“Dean, please listen to reason.  I know you don’t want to believe that your brother would say yes, but-“
“Come on, I bet if the bassist put in a good word for you, you’d get anyone you wanted after the show.”
Before he can stop himself, he hits his knees, and Cas is there in a flash, pulling up his face, trying to get Dean to look at him.
“Okay.  I’m seeing him tonight,” Dean does his best to act casual and knows they can all see right through him anyway, “I’m gonna head home and change.”
Dean stands at the bottom of the steps leading up to Cas’ porch.  Dean doesn’t know how he’s lived without speaking to him for so long, he feels like he wants to tell him everything that’s happened, from the near accident at work two weeks ago to the fact that Sam passed every one of his classes with all As and was top of his class again.
He spent a lot of his time just being with the people he had lost.  Ellen, Jo, Ash, Pamela, Bobby, his mother, Charlie, even Benny (who, when Dean had finished giving him a bear hug, had said something distinctly vague about how he got raised from Purgatory, but Dean hadn’t felt like asking many questions), but it always felt like something was missing.  He tried to shake it, he had everyone back, everything was fine.
“It’s just that this is the first girl that Sam’s brought home and I want to make sure that this is all just right, did I tell you I’m learning some sign language?  I just want her to feel comfortable around us and I don’t want to mess this up for Sam because I feel like I’m always messing things up and I really want this to go right and-”
Dean stares at him.  Goddamn, he may have to marry this guy.  Gorgeous and he asks him about tattoo styles?
The silence stretches again, they watch the movie for a little while, but Dean knew that Cas would bring the big it up again, and soon.
“Charlize Theron isn’t your girlfriend,” Dean points out, putting inches of space between him and Cas almost unconsciously, like they had been caught.
“I really should go change,” he shift his weight in that nervous way, trying to push those usual inadequate feelings out of his fucked up head.
Usually, it takes him a while to fall asleep; he often finds himself at his desk sketching for a couple of hours before his eyes would ache and itch and he could finally sleep.  But tonight was different, he hit the pillows and immediately starts to drift, he can barely set his alarm for work in the morning before he passes out.  And he definitely does not think of Castiel when he falls asleep, that would be weird, creepy, and ridiculous.
He breaks off.  Lee isn’t judging him, not yet, but if Dean said it out loud, it meant it happened, that it was true.
Dean’s shift flies by, he drinks four cups of coffee before lunch and nearly cries over a video one of his coworkers shows him of a man in a child’s Mike Wazowski costume.  He eats a granola bar and a bag of chips out of the vending machine because he didn’t have time to make his own lunch, and sends Cas the video before he’s back in the reactor room, doing shit he still doesn’t really understand and making good money for it.
Dean had always thought that he had done well considering the circumstances.  He had raised his brother, gone to college, gotten a good job, had amazing friends, had a steady girlfriend.  Then, this unexpected thing happened.  This guy, who was the epitome of punk rock, waltzed into his life his freshman year of college, and for a long time he was just a part of Dean’s friends group, weaving his way into the fabric of Dean’s life, until that day that they had come up with their agreement, when they were twenty years old and Dean was white knuckling it the whole time.  That was probably the time the Dean had fallen over the edge, but time had slowed down, he hadn’t realized it until it was far too late, and now he had no idea what to do, there was no way that he could stop himself, because Cas was just a part of his life, he was at the foundation.  What would he do if he couldn’t go see bad horror movies with Cas?  If he couldn’t eat takeout at 3am and then feel like shit in the morning with Cas?  If he couldn’t watch Cas perform and feel like he was walking on air because he was so fucking proud of Cas, if he couldn’t smell Cas’ hair, if he couldn’t stain his hands with hair dye, trying to dye Cas’ hair some crazy color in Dean’s bathroom, if he couldn’t make fun of Charlie for passing out face down on the floor with Cas, if he couldn’t kiss Cas, if he couldn’t bite the underside of Cas’ ear, if he couldn’t get fucked by, or fuck Cas, if he couldn’t trace all the details on his body, from freckles to ridges, to notches, to ink.  Cas was as much a part of him as Dean was a part of Cas, they hadn’t realized that they had been building up to each other, but they had been, and now if they tried to break apart, everything would crumble.  But Dean couldn’t admit that he was in love with Cas, he couldn’t do that, because that would mean admitting something about himself that he had always been terrified of, something that his father had made him hate about himself, something that he had always said he would never let become a part of his identity.  He had told Cas for years that he was straight except when either of them broke up with someone, that was the only time, he thought Cas saw through that, and now he was realizing that everyone saw through it, not just Cas.  Even Sam saw through it.  But unlearning years of prejudice and fear of being who you are is hard, it doesn’t happen in a day.  He owes Cas a little growth, bot just to call him right now, when every part of him wants to do just that.  He needs to actually figure some shit out before he does that.
“How’s it going?” Eileen asks, gripping his hand as he lets her go.  He’s very grateful for her, Sam, as usual, picked a good one.
Cas tongue is in his mouth, and Dean had always though French kissing was weird, but it didn’t feel weird with Cas.  Nothing ever really felt weird with Cas, which is probably why everything just felt like it came naturally with him, because it did.  Cas is inching his way closer, so their chests are pressed flush together and Dean sighs into his mouth, like he can’t ever get enough of him.
“Before what?” Cas’ eyes widen as Dean avoids his gaze, “You’re not talking about what I think you’re talking about.”
Street, emerging on the bustling night streets of Midtown.  The theater district is always brightly lit, with people waiting in line to go into shows, and even though Dean had never been a theatre geek like Charlie is, he did like the lights and the theatres, because they got away from the blinding LED lights of Times Square.  It was softer there, somehow, even though it was just as busy, it felt like it was world away from one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, like the Northeast’s Disney, only way dirtier, the people in the costumes charging money for their photos.
They eat in silence for a few minutes, Cas leaning against the counter, his hair too long, falling, bright green, into his eyes, which keep darting over at Dean.
“Well, I mean-” Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ stomach, which is warm through the thin, ratty t-shirt he’s wearing.  He presses his lips to the side of his neck, and Cas shudders a little under his touch.
Right as Dean considers challenging Ash to an arm-wrestling contest (because he had been embarrassed at Christmas), Pamela stands up from the slanted desk behind the counter and slaps Dean’s tattoo down in front of her.
“Well, you’re the first ones in.  Well, second, my siblings came in first.  You were right Dean, they loved it,” Cas can’t hide his happiness, and Dean can feel it infecting all of them, especially after so many weeks of anxiety over the crowd, his family, the placement of the art, all that was replaced by sheer joy radiating from his every pore, “Take a walk, let me know if you need anything.  We’re about to let them in so…I’ll see you later.”
“Well, we didn’t really get a chance to talk at the party, you ran out so fast.  We thought we’d scared you off.”
Pamela and Benny are more attentive than usual, asking him round for dinner, having him spend more time with Celeste, and Dean is grateful because, in these moments, whether he’s having a quiet dinner with Pamela, The Ramones spilling from her record player, or playing pirates with Celeste, he’s allowed to just be.  He doesn’t have to try and be anything other than he is, which he was doing too much of before.  That was probably part of the problem, then again.
Dean refused to call out his name when he came, even though his drunk-ass brain really really wanted to, so he bit down on his lip, so hard that he tasted blood, and as he came down from his high, the horrible ache in his chest came back, and he longed for Cas, more than he longed for him usually, because now Cas wasn’t in the next room.  He had moved on, and Dean was absolutely terrified that he may never see him again.
Cas smiled as past Dean threw up his hands, as though to say, “I don’t want to get involved.”  It was the exact kind of thing that his Dean used to do.  He humor, his heart, all so clear on past Dean, and Cas couldn’t see it on his Dean’s face anymore.
“Well I know that’s bullshit, we see each other a lot, your dick would be exhausted if that was the case.”
It was the gentlest rebuke Cas had heard Dean give in months.  Chuck understood and back off, and Cas’ eyes softened as they looked at Dean.  Despite everything, despite how hard the apocalypse and the Croatoan virus and losing Bobby had been on him, he was still able to be a little soft, show compassion.  Despite their fight, as even though Cas knew that he was right, the plan really was stupid, Cas threaded his fingers through Dean’s fingers in between them in the Impala.  Dean looked at him, grateful, and pressed a kiss to his temple.
Ok yes hello I'm posting again literally one day later but this chapter is one of my favs and I have *Jean Ralphio voice* no self controooooolllll
“Could be the demons.  Think about it.  If they release it, it could decimate the planet, turn everyone against each other.  It makes sense.  But what I don’t get is why right now.  I mean, we all know they’ve been kicking it up a notch recently, hell we’ve taken down groups of em every other week it seems like, but this?  I just don’t see why the timing works out,”
Cock to cock is so good, it’s so fucking good, that Dean is seeing stars within two minutes.  It’s ridiculous, he was gonna come in a minute and a half like a virgin teenager, and he and Cas had been sleeping together for literal years.  He’s honestly disappointed in himself a little, but then Cas has taken control and he doesn’t really think about anything anymore, he doesn’t think about anything but Cas being on him, Cas fucking him.
“Pretty eager for a chick who’s just a friend, Sam,” he says lightly, knocking back the last of his coffee. Sam scowls, right on cue.
Something strange happens in Dean’s chest. A nervous thread, pulled taut, goes lax with relief—but he’s barely had time to appreciate it before a dull, heavy feeling starts seeping through him like oil.
(edit 23/11: chapter two! wasn't planning on adding one but pretending spn is a slice-of-life sitcom catered to my personal tastes is how i have chosen to cope, so......here she is)
He stills checks. Probably ‘cause he’s still counting cards like an asshole. Dean rolls his eyes and looks away before his cheeks have a chance to flush.
“Go to sleep,” Cas says, soft and low. He palms Dean’s jaw with two fingers—no grace, no light. Warmth flickers in Dean's chest anyway when he leans into it.
“No buts,” Cas says. “He’s happy, I think. He’s doing well.” His hand slips to Dean’s shoulder, squeezing lightly, only once, before he smooths out a wrinkle in Dean’s shirt with his thumb. “You should sleep, Dean.”
“No, I get it,” Dean insists. “All the crap that’s gone down this year, you guys wanna, y’know. Take things slow. I get that.”
He pauses, like he’s looking for the right words. Dean looks down at him, feeling awkwardly frozen in place—and he’s stuck by that, all of a sudden. How Cas, who’s older than everything in this room, including the dirt it’s built on, always takes the time to do this. He’ll choose his words carefully in a language that isn’t his, so Dean can understand him.
Dean stares at the table top. He bounces one knee up and down underneath it in tiny, jerky movements, trying to get rid of the restlessness that’s making his legs itch. Letting Sam walk unprotected into the line of fire goes against every instinct he has; the more he tries to stifle the urge to fix it, the stronger it gets.
“I love you” Dean muttered against his chest, overflowing with bliss like a melting sun, and he didn’t need to hear Cas’ answer to know the feeling was the same.
They stare at her, speechless, mouths wide open under the electricity of shock. They stand still, frozen, eyes fixed on her. Her black coat flaps around her, as her gentle dark eyes smile at them.
“It seems on brand for you and me.  I don’t think this will ruin anything.  Now come on, let’s go meet the parents.”
When they take their final bow, Dean immediately tries to get to the backstage area, but there’s actual security in his way, so he loops around the back, intent to just wait them out.  He’s foiled there too, another security guard who doesn’t even let him get close to the backstage door.  Fuck.  What does he do now?
in 24 hours and becoming convinced she would be his Tan France.  He waves to Charlie and Benny on the couch, slaps Sam on the back, and slams into Cas on his way out the door.  Cas smiles at him and kisses him on the cheek, and Dean heads to the Lisa’s with a warmth in his stomach that he can’t explain.
“We don’t have to find Lucifer, we know where he is.  The demon that we caught last week he was one of the…big guy’s entourage.  He knew.”
“Anyway,” Charlie talks over them both, “when does Jo come home, Ellen?  I need her to help me wrangle these idiots.”
People ask him all the time, before they get their first tattoo, what it actually feels like, and the best Dean can compare is like a hot mechanical pencil running down your skin.  He doesn’t mind it, especially with Charlie chattering next to him, careful not to make him laugh, and Pamela’s steady hands on his arm, he feels at peace, which isn’t something most people probably think when a needle is jamming ink into their skin, but he’s a freak, he accepted that a long time ago.
“Don’t insult the greatest music ever made Cas, even though you give the best blowjobs I’ve ever had doesn’t mean I won’t throw you out onto the pavement.”
character.  Dean sees some of the tension visibly bleed from Sam’s shoulders.  Damn, Charlie’s good.
Cas’ apartment is just as beautiful as the last time Dean had seen it, all soft light and pretty wood floors, and Dean settles himself in the pristine chef’s kitchen, laying out each of the ingredients he had carefully chosen on the massive marble island, Cas sitting across from him in one of the chairs tucked neatly into the slab of cold stone.
“It’s just that, I really thought that, when we were talking, that you were, that maybe it was, I don’t know, that it was you and me.  That you meant that you and me, what we have is real. That-” he breaks off, “I don’t know.”
“Yeah, I guess, most interesting one in here to me,” Dean says, trying his damndest not to turn up the charm on this guy.
How long did he stand there? Minutes? Hours? Long enough for Sam to come upstairs and ask the words Dean knew were coming:
The guy’s eyes travel down Dean, like he’s being x-rayed, and Dean finds himself desperately hoping that this guy isn’t one of the law partners Sam is supposed to impress.
Castiel is sitting about twenty yards away from them, and Dean recognizes Balthazar and Anna next to him, along with some friends that he had met once or twice.  He’s facing Dean, he looks a little thinner too, but Dean could definitely be imagining that.  He’s wearing those dark blue sweatpants he usually only wears on early morning grocery runs and the Ramones shirt that Pamela had given him for his birthday last year.
Cas just sighs and smiles softly.  He reaches out and traces the line of Dean’s jaw with one warm finger.  Dean shudders.
Dean tunes out the chatter and swipes through Instagram for a while, waiting for his client to show up, letting himself wake up, so the burning itch of being awake after too little sleep leaves him as the caffeine works its way through his veins.
Dean looks up from his semi-frantic search to see Sam’s wide eyes.  Why does everyone think he’s such a theatre hater?  He had only told Charlie that that weird movement thing they saw when Sam had just gotten back to the city was worse than watching a guy throw up on the subway car he was in, but that didn’t mean he hated all theatre.  They’re just being dramatic, as usual.
He feels guilty the second he kicks off his shoes and collapses on his bed.  He tries to calm his breathing in that way that Charlie had showed him when a guy out-hustled him at pool and he almost got thrown out of the bar he actually lived below, but it doesn’t really work.  He decides to go for a comfort movie, which is, of course,
It’s sorta embarrassing, he feels like a girl, but when Cas’ face splits into a smile as bright as the sun itself, that worry vanishes.
They end up staying up all night, getting semi buzzed on beer, and getting Postmates from this Tex-Mex restaurant that Dean simply adores, and he feels a little better and a little more like himself once he’s five beers in and has absolutely housed his steak burrito, watching
He tries not to watch Cas for too long, but man, there’s something about him when he performs.  Dean usually compares him to a fish out of water with all the flailing, which is quick to earn him a slap to the side of the head, but there’s an easy grace about Cas when he’s playing, his hair is all over the place, he’s got this look of peace on his face, his mouth moves to the lyrics that Charlie sings…or, well, screams, depends on the song.  Anyway, this is getting kinda girly, which Dean is not.  So the second the song ends he marches up to Cas and pokes him in the chest.
The ladies coo at this, and Cas gives Dean the kind of radiant smile that makes Dean feel like he’s worth a couple extra cents than normal.
“Any hot guys?” Charlie’s wiping down her chair, obviously trying not to inhale the chemicals of the Clorox wipe.  Dean snorts.
She lets him kiss her cheek before pushing him out the door so she can get to work, and Dean heads to work himself, in a much better mood now that he had started to smooth things over with her.  He would save the actual apology for the restaurant by the water.
No one said anything, and Dean spread them out: two in the front, two on the sides, and he and Cas would take the rear.  As they walked towards the doors of the sanitarium, Dean caught Cas’ hand and squeezed.  Cas looked at him, and, not for the first time, but certainly the most clearly, he saw the Dean that he had met six years before: young, funny, and so breathtakingly beautiful.  He drank it up, the rare seconds when Dean looked like that now, and Dean kissed him briefly, before Cas made his way through the doors, expecting Dean to be right behind him, as he always was.
Dean was a red blooded macho man that hated that he was attracted to Cas.  So, Cas fought back the only way he knew would get a rise out of Dean: start having sex himself.  It was easy, he was a relatively good-looking human, thanks to Jimmy Novak’s vessel, and the orgies that he organized?  Women flocked to them.  Maybe for the “group mind” bullshit that he was spouting along with them, or maybe it was the fact that the world was literally crashing down around them, but he started having them weekly.  And at first?  It worked, it pissed Dean off like nothing else could.  Cas would see him leaning against one of the cars parked outside, counting the people that left, his nose still bandaged and his face still bruised.  When he saw him outside, Cas didn’t say anything, even if Dean made the move to come up to him, speak to him, Cas simply turned around and went back inside.
When they finally did get the Camp Chitaqua, it was almost unrecognizable.  Hell, it almost looked like a settlement, a real little town.  Chuck greeted them at the gate, and insisted that they take a photo in front of the gate and Camp Chitaqua sign.  Dean conveniently disappeared right as they snapped the photo, but Cas liked it anyway.  Him, Bobby, Yaeger, Adrian, and Smith all holding as much firepower as they could.  It looked a little ridiculous, but when Chuck handed Bobby the photo, Bobby tucked it into his journal without another word.
When they pulled apart, Cas’ hands had found his way around Dean’s neck.  Their chests were pressed flush together, and Cas could feel both their hearts rattling in their chests.
“Yeah, you know,” Dean pauses, too much for a first date, “It’s just nice to have him back.  Plus, I can annoy him all the time now instead of over the phone.  What about your siblings?”
Sam was halfway through telling him about a science project that had nearly burned down the school (Sam was always more into English than science), and how it was hotdog lunch day, his least favorite, when the thrumming beat of cacophony below suddenly cut off.
It was a testament to how much they cared about him that they didn’t crack a joke, Cas and Lisa’s distaste for one another had been a running gag for years.
He thought that they had made some kind of breakthrough, that things would get back to normal.  Well, as normal as things can get for what kind of world they were living in.  sure, Dean was still hell bent on getting the Colt, and Cas was still hell bent on finding the world’s most perfect high, but, generally, things were pretty good.  He and Dean didn’t fight as often as they used to, they spent more night peaceably in their house, whatever record Cas picked playing on the record player.
Cas smiles at him, staring a little too long, so the guy behind the counter has to ask them what they want a second time.
Dean drove so fast that even Cas, in his hazed and pain-sickened state, got nervous as he took curves at ninety miles and hour.  Tires screeched as Dean yelled at those on watch to open the gates to Camp Chitaqua.
Of course, Cas wasn’t the one to break the silence.  A young man, one of Andrei’s friends, came up to Dean and told him that his brother was a piece of shit that ruined the world with selfishness.  Cas tried to get between Dean and the kid, whatever his name was, but Dean already had the pistol under his chin and pulled the trigger before he had made it two steps.  It seemed like the whole place went deadly silent.
Before Dean can answer, the waiter comes by, and he knows Castiel by name, giving him a hug and asking if he wants “the usual” as he brings a wine list for each of them.  Dean likes wine, don’t get him wrong, but he usually just buys a box of Franzia for him and Sam that lasts them a couple of weeks (less if Charlie comes over for movie night).  He looks down the list and recognizes exactly nothing, especially since there are like thirty different versions of each wine. (How on earth can there be four versions of Chardonnay?).  He’s sort of panicking, because as stupid as it is, he does want to impress Castiel and doesn’t want to pick a bad wine.  Oh god, he’s so juvenile.
He’s addicted to the heat, the lines and ridges and colorful ink on his shoulders and his sides, and it’s becoming more and more difficult to keep his hands to himself, especially since Cas leans into every touch, no matter how soft or fleeting they are.  Sometimes he even makes these soft little huffing noises, and that’s enough to break Dean’s resolve into pieces like powdered glass, but somehow, someway, he holds strong.  Fear will do that to you.
“I think the hardest thing for me would be the cheese,” Charlie’s really thinking, considering the obstacles in between her and the ten million dollars that don’t exist.
It doesn’t take Pamela long, maybe 45 minutes, and when she gently cleans him up, he’s left with a two and a half inch perfect blue rose, a blue that’s vibrant and peaceful and reminds Dean of something that he can’t quite put his finger on.  It’s incredible, and he tells Pamela as much, and she gives him a hug that he leans into more than usual.
He tries his best to move past his weird hangups with his past, with his father, with the part of his life that he and Sam never talk about.  It doesn’t always work, but he tries, he tries.  For Cas.
“You are so worked up over this,” Pamela tries her best to placate him, “It’s going to be fine, you’re panicking over nothing.”
“Listen, I know we’re not crazy about each other, but we have one thing in common: we’re crazy about you.  And I’d look at ten thousand galleries of weird art if it meant something to you.  I don’t think you’ll have to worry about it.  They’ll be proud of you, just like I am.”
“No we were not!” Dean tries his absolute best to not think about how his eyes kept flicking down to Cas’ lips and how they kept narrowing the space between them and how much he wished he was still at that table with him.
“Partially, they are protective of me, Anna and Balthazar especially, but they were all eager to meet you.  I suspect she was probably drunk.”
After the hangover releases him (three or so days later), he makes the decision.  He refuses to talk about it, shutting himself inside his bubble and his work.  Even when Sam eventually comes back, the prickliness and the anger wearing away with weeks and weeks of time, Dean doesn’t feel like he’s himself anymore.  Too often, he feels like he’s someone else, until he has the needle on someone’s skin, that’s the only time he feels grounded.
“Every day is annoy Dean day, just look at my calendar,” Charlie grins at him, waggling her eyebrows, “What are you afraid of?  That his big scary siblings are going to be scandalized by you?”
Dean doesn’t answer, just sets his bag down, looking around for Sam, remembering halfway through that he and his friend Travis were having a sleepover this weekend.
The lobby is marble and dark wood and the light fixtures that have to be about thirty feet tall.  It’s nicer than the nicest hotel he’s ever seen, and Castiel fucking lives here?  His building has a doorman and a keycard to get into it, and a code to get to his floor.
“Oh he definitely will,” Dean sighs, trying not to second guess how readily he said that.  He rubs a hand down his face, suddenly achingly tired, “Jesus, C, you and me need to go out and talk about this because I’m sorta freaking out.”
“I wasn’t saying, yeah, sure.  Let me get my book and I get you scheduled in.  Wait right now is usually three to four-”
Cas is flipping idly through a magazine when Dean comes back, looking about as nonchalant as you can get when you’re about to get a tattoo from your ex.
“Don’t forget that picture,” Dean calls after him, earning him a thumbs up from Benny as the door swings shut.  Dean spends the next half an hour cleaning up the shop, the nightly ritual completed a little early, until he starts getting incessant texts from Charlie, all threatening to tear up his comic collection if he didn’t get his ass home.  He sighs, resigning himself to a horrible hangover in the morning and starts the really unbelievably beautiful walk back towards the apartment.  He loves New York in the fall, the beautiful leaves, the breezy weather, it was the perfect time to live here.  He hums as he heads up their block, the orange and black decorations adorning the entrances, little kids already running around in costumes.  This was nice, like actually kinda perfect.
The movie was just what he needed, he thinks later that night, as he gives Cas a ride home so he can get a couple of hours of sleep before they both work in the morning.  He puts the car in park next to Cas’ door, trying to minimize how far he has to walk to his door, but Cas doesn’t get out immediately.  He turns to Dean, looking almost shy.
“God bless our national parks,” Dean sighed, sitting down on one of the cabin porches, “I guess you and I get first dibs.”
Cas picks up his phone, running his hand through his hair distractedly as he reads an email; lips moving silently, forming the words, trying to make his brain keep working, even though it clearly needed a break.
“Yeah I, I don’t know, it’s just hard, because it’s not like…we’ve just always kept it under wraps, or we thought so anyway.  We signed this thing.”
“Let’s do this,” Dean grins at Cas, and each of them take one half of the paper, signed and stamped by a notary, and tear it in two.  They crumple up their halves and lob them into the ocean, watching them disappear into the dark water.
Cas doesn’t make things easier, he insists on spending all his free time at the apartment, and Dean finds himself more inclined to hang out with his friends and with Sam, playing dumb board games and drinking bad box wine than to spend time with Lisa in cold silence in her big empty house.
“Oh I can tell that,” Benny smiles after his regular is wrapped up and has paid, “He talks about Cas the way I used to talk about Andrea when we first met.  Couldn’t talk about anything else.”
Dean feels like he swallowed a rock, and it’s lodged in his throat, making it hard to breathe, to swallow.
“You don’t make any fucking sense, Dean,” Sam is shaking now, “You were so goddamn happy, and you had to go and ruin it just in case it didn’t work out.  I feel sorry for you.”
“You know me, I’m into all kinds of music.  Remember that one time we put my music on shuffle and tried to count the genres?”
Just survived the longest week at work ever so I'm rewarding myself by posting the longest chapter in the world lmao.  I really hope you guys enjoy, and I would love to know what you think! :)
“Don’t fine me, Dean.  I know when you’re in a mood, and you snap like that unless you’re in a mood.”
Dean takes that as his cue to scurry back to the front, and he hopes he imagined the way Cas’ shoulders sink down when he walks out the door.
Cas smiles, and heads down his hallway, throwing Dean one last look before he makes the turn to the elevator.  Dean gives him a wave, knowing that he had done all he could to make this day a little bit easier on him.
The song, predictably, brings down the house, and Cas winks at Dean as they do an encore for the crowd, and then another one.  Dean feels like his voice is going to disappear from how much he’s cheering.  He can’t find it in himself to care if it does disappear.
“Don’t be,” Dean says, lacing up his boots, “You’ll be fine.  Plus, you’re gonna be like this baby law clerk for a while, anyway, so they aren’t going to give you think you can like mega fuck up.”
He picks up the pace, and before he knows it, Cas was digging his fingers even harder into Dean’s skin and moaning so loud he thought it might alert the people on the street forty floors below.
Dean can’t help but roll his eyes, and Cas gets that steely look when he can feel that they’re about to have a fight.
Dean rolled his eyes, and Cas hoped beyond hope that he wasn’t imagining Dean inching his chair closer to Cas.
“I did mean that, Dean.  I do mean that.  I just...I didn’t know how to say it,or if was even right to say it.”
He looks back at Cas, stunningly beautiful as usual, and the words he wants to say get pulled down by the usual suspects; his doubt, his fear.
Cas slides his hands down Dean’s chest, wrapping him up in arms that are too easy to lean into, too easy to fall in love with.
Being high really did pass the time.  He always kept it from Dean, was careful to hide the stash that Andrei brought him under the bed. He didn’t want Dean to know about this, he didn’t want him to think less of him.  But the drugs helped with the pain, helped with the boredom, and helped him get out of his head.  He did a good job hiding it for a while, well, better than he expected anyway, until Dean came home unexpectedly and caught him in the middle of smoking with Andrei.  Cas pretty much had to plant himself in front of the kid, or Dean absolutely would have killed him.
At first, Dean doesn’t rest.  He sits, hunched against the cold metal bars of the headboard, fighting sleep that made his eyes itch and ache, begging him to fall asleep in a soft bed for the first time since that hotel in Oklahoma.  He had checked his bag the second Bobby had swung the door closed, and had found the gun he had stolen from John before he left, three bullets, his knife, the granola bars, and the last two pictures of his mother that he carried.  He breathes a sigh of relief when he finds the photos, worried that they had been taken from him when he was unconscious.
“Cas,” Dean’s voice was rougher now, and Cas could feel the heat coming off of him, not that he wasn’t always hyper-aware of Dean’s proximity to him at all times anyway.
“Hey Cas,” Dean’s already working on the dressing, ready to throw it on the second rack of the oven when he was sure the turkey had enough time by itself (yes, he knows he’s kind of a freak about this, so sue him).  Cas is holding like thirty bags and drops them all unceremoniously on the floor, breathing hard.
Panic rises by degrees in his chest on their way to Gabriel’s house in Westchester.  Apparently it was the family home, left to Gabriel when their mother had passed the year before, finally losing her years long battle with lung cancer.  Cas grips his hand the whole way, and Dean insists on taking the Impala, the open air and being behind the wheel is something that he can control in an out of control situation.
Listen, he doesn’t know why, really, he loves aquariums so much.  He’s always liked natural history museums, but aquariums especially have always been his favorite.  He loves reading the little cards and seeing all the animals’ and fishes’ names, he loves the way the water reflects on the walls and the floor, sort of like you’re under the sea with them, in your own airbubble in the middle of the ocean floor, and he especially loves any time he gets to see a shark.
He tells himself that maybe things could be different when Sam went to college next year, but he knows, realistically, that they won’t be.  Not only would Cas not wait for him (and he would never ask him to, anyway), but Dean is
Dean sleeps soundly that night, probably due to the metric tons of eggnog he had consumed the night before, but he’s up and at em early to start cooking like a crazy person.  Christmas and Thanksgiving dinner really go hand in hand, and no one seems to understand that but him.  He’s already got the turkey in the oven by eight, and is humming along to the Christmas music playing quietly on his phone.
“Dean-” Cas started to say, but he wasn’t going to let him get that far.  Dean stood up, swung his bag over his shoulder, and headed to the door.  At the threshold, he turned back and looked at Cas.
“I just, it’s something that I read that said so much noise is bad for a kid and I didn’t want you, you aren’t struggling in school or anything are you.”
“Interesting piece to seek out,” comes a voice to his right.  He looks over and sees dark haired hotness standing next to him, holding a glass of red wine and gazing at the painting with an intensity that made Dean’s hands start to tingle.  Okay, he’s even better looking up close, where Dean can see his full lips and killer jawline, a little bit of five o’clock shadow that really just ties the whole obscenely gorgeous thing together.  The guy’s really wearing like a four-thousand dollar suit, it fits him just right too, he had obviously gotten it tailored.  Dean isn’t normally one to think that suit pants looked really good on someone, but the contrast of the guy’s hair, which looked like he’s just gotten fucked in the bathroom, and the way the crisp navy blue pants hug his hips is more than a little unfair.
“I don’t know why you even bother with the TV on Thursdays, you know that’s their practice day,” Sam opens the fridge and stares aimlessly for a few seconds before turning back to Dean, turning on the puppy dog eyes that he knows will get him essentially anything he wants in the entire universe.  Damn him.
Cas felt his back gingerly.  Nothing.  No blood, no feathers.  His heart was racing from the pain.  It didn’t normally feel like this, he felt like it was going to burst out his chest.

At some point, Dean’s not exactly sure when, the touching turned to a light kiss on the side of Cas’s face, which turned into a kiss on the underside of Dean’s jaw, which turned into a full on make out session in the back of movie theater.  It’s not like anyone could see, the nearest people were five rows in front of them, but Dean has to actively work not to make noise or those gross kissing sounds that would definitely carry, even during an action scene probably.  They have to stop every so often when the movie gets quiet, giggling and pressing feather-light kisses to each other’s noses or jaw or cheek or forehead.  They almost get caught when Cas bites lightly at Dean’s throat and he can’t suppress a low groan that causes the lady in front of them to turn around, looking for the source of the noise.
“You have thoroughly changed me tonight.  I may have to have you come over all the time, I’m not sure I can go back to microwaved meals after this.”
He really doesn’t have any right to be being so dramatic, this was his fault anyway, but he knew it was going to take weeks to fix and probably like three more visits at that relationship counselor’s office.  Ugh, Naomi.  He hates her.  But Lisa insists that it helps them and he’s not going to argue with her on it, he had tried that, it hadn’t worked out for him.
Dean can’t look at her, because it’s such a nice thing, such a nice thing to feel as happy as he does right now, and he still afraid that that happiness will get taken away.
Cas doesn’t say anything else, but just pulls him closer, wrapping him in this hug, the kind of hug he hasn’t had since he was a kid.  There were no other expectations to it, it wasn’t going to lead to anything else, just the feeling of Cas solidly against him, holding him in place, not wanting to go anywhere, find someone better, that was enough to get Dean through the week.
The edge of anger to Cas’ voice is unmissable, but Dean still refuses to look at him.  If he looked at him, he would lose his nerve, which was already hanging by the thinnest of thin threads, one breath of doubt and it would break.
“You, uh, you know you can talk to me about this stuff?  Like I know you and Ben are friends, and I don’t want you to think that I did this without thinking about you, you know?  Or that anything is different now because me and Lis are broken up.  She still cares about you, you know.  I just don’t want you to think that your whole life is uprooted now or anything.”
He’s not normally one to think he deserves good things.  Hell, his life experience would generally tell him otherwise, the only good thing he’d ever done in his life was running the shop with his friends, but man, things with Cas were easy to fall face first into.  He thinks about how scary it is that he’s so willing to spill his guts to Cas, how eager he is to do domestic shit with him, how much he wants to simultaneously fuck him and cuddle with him.  He hasn’t felt that since he and Lisa broke up, and since…since Chicago…and that’s not a road he wants to go down again, no matter how much of it was his own doing.
First there was the light, light like the sun which was never seen through choking smoke, and then the sound.  Cas could still hear the angels, even if he wasn’t one of them, so while Dean covered his ears and screwed up his face in pain in the alley, Cas could hear Lucifer crying out in joy.  He finally had his vessel.
“What are you doing?” Dean asks as Cas moves up to his forearm, the mountains and the twisting road, tracing the ink, pressing his mouth to the outline of the car and its taillights.
“Okay,” Bobby grunts as the two run back up the stairs, back to their loud and boisterous conversation that Dean, despite his exhaustion and fear and remaining hunger, desperately wants to be a part of, “We gotta get you to bed.”
“She’s lovely,” and Dean can feel Cas’ eyes on him which makes him feel like he’s under a heat lamp.
They go one at a time, each picking something to open, not moving on until the person before was finished with their gift.  Sam gets a plant book from Eileen, complete with several pages of pressed flowers, and he presses a kiss into her hair, something so achingly intimate that Dean finds himself grabbing Cas’ hand almost instinctively, needing to be as close to him as possible.  Charlie is ecstatic over her
Bobby was never one to wait for dramatics.  He sighed and wheeled himself towards the kitchen table, pulling his journal off of it and turning back to Dean.
