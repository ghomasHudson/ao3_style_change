“Tony, I’m so sorry. This was a once and a lifetime thing. I swear.” Steve pleaded trying to move closer to Tony, but he wouldn’t allow it. Steve could see all of Tony’s walls were up. The look he was being given was never supposed to be seen by Steve because Steve was never meant to break his heart.
·       At twenty-three he took on the mantle of Captain America just like his old man. Sam Wilson after serving as the Captain for twelve long years decided it was his time to retire as his good friend had to. James was the perfect person.
“To let you know, Steve, this is breaking me more then it is breaking you because I do love you very much. All I want is to live a full life with you, but I can’t wait for you to see or realize that I’m worth it. So, this is goodbye.” Steve laid his hand on Tony’s cheek. Tony leaned into the touch but then pull his hand away.
“No, Mr. Stark, he is not dead, but he is severally injured and will be coming home early. He has had several surgeries already, but he will need several weeks of physical therapy. We just want to warn you. He might not be the same.”
June came and went with the usual letters. Steve kept begging for pictures of Tony and Tony made every excuse up in the book to not send one of him. They each told each other how much they missed one another. Not much to share when Steve had to keep the mission on a need-to-know basis and Tony was busy in the office. He once and awhile stayed in the lab. These days he didn’t have the energy to do much of anything. He knew why. Everyone knew why but he couldn’t tell Steve. Not yet even if he really wanted to. Tony knew telling Steve what was going on back home would just stress him out. Resulting in him leaving the mission early or getting himself hurt or worst killed. Tony decided to keep the secrete. Steve will know when he gets home in threeish months.
Steve sat at the bar looking up at the tv as they covered the wedding of the decade. The playboy had finally found the one. “Too bad it’s with the wrong one.” Steve huffed bring his beer to his lips to finish off his eleventh or twelfth. He might have lost tracked a couple of hours ago. He placed the empty bottle on the counter where it was quickly replaced by another.
“Steve, it hurts so bad. It burns.” Tony cried. Steve tilted his head down trying to see Tony’s progress when he saw a small, tiny tuft of hair poking out.
Steve continued making dinner. Spicy chili is Tony’s favorite and should help move the process along.
“You know I love you right and I would do anything for you.” Tony knew this. He knew this from day one since they got together as high school freshmen. “But I can’t not reenlist, so I guess this a goodbye.”  Steve choked out. He didn’t want to leave Tony. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with him, but he had to go back in. He had unfinished business.
They were wrong so wrong. They thought Sarah would have been here in a matter of hours but sadly there was no sign. Tony was still at seven cm and hating life. Tony leaned against Steve breathing in slowly even though all he wanted to do was scream.
“No, I couldn’t really find anyone that.” Steve paused looking up at Tony’s eyes. The last time he saw them there was so much pain. Pain that he caused. He never wanted that again. Steve placed a hand to Tony’s check like he did so many years ago. Tony sank into the touch, closing his eyes. “compared to you. Tony, you were the best thing in my life.” Steve came closer hovering over lips wanting desperately to kiss them again.
“Yeah, but we were able to call, text, and even some facetime. You are being dropped into a dead zone. That means no service and no way to communicate.” Steve laid a hand under Tony’s chin lifting his head so he could better see Tony’s amber eyes. Steve wished he didn’t haven’t go. He hated the idea of leaving Tony alone for so long. The job had to be done and Tony knew that. Tony would never ask Steve to give up the shield just like how Steve wouldn’t ask him to give up being Ironman.
The wedding never came instead two more tours happened. Tony didn’t know if he could do this anymore. He missed Steve all the time and he was so worried that he would one day get the message of someone saying the love of his life would never be coming back. Tony sat at his desk finishing up some paperwork when he got a knock on his door. He laid down his pen not knowing who was at the door. Tony opened the door to find two military men standing in his doorway. His legs began to shake, and tears welled in his eyes. No, it couldn’t be he thought his worst nightmare had became true.
“Hey, dad, there is a weird car out front,” Peter called. Tony sat down the towel he was using to dry the dishes. Tony walked to the window where Peter stood and saw who was getting out of the car.
“What do you mean no?” Steve panicky tried to get Tony to move but the pain was too much to bear for him to even try to move.
“Yes?” Tony nodded and then smiled to reveal the crinkle at the edge of his eyes. Steve always loved them making him know that Tony was happy once upon a time. Steve kissed him once again.
·       Kat often would get her into wild situations. One time she dared her to put pink tips in her hair. It looked cute after it was done but she washed it out right away.
“Steve, answer me,” Tony growled. Steve moved off the bed towards Tony. Trying to grip him in his arms. Steve felt if he just held Tony everything would be okay, and all would be forgiven. Not this time. Tony pushed him away and he stumbled back towards the bed. “Put some clothes on.”
·       He was a really sick kid like Steve and was even born prematurely. The super soldier blood that was in him didn’t kick in until he was ten which was a miracle for his parents.
“Yeah, sure one day. In a couple of years so I can save some money up to give you the perfect wedding you deserve.” Tony liked the idea even though he could go down to the courthouse and get married. Tony sat up and lean over Steve to grab a silver ring from the drawer.
·       She is currently dating Ivan which is Bucky and Nat’s youngest son. He is twenty but they have been dating since she was fourteen and he was sixteen. She wants to marry him but not before she travels the world and does her first show on broad way.
·       Him and Thor are close kind of. Their relationship was better when he was a kid. They haven’t really spoken in three years. Not because of a feud but just losing touch.
“Wait, what are you talking about Steve? You’re trying to tell me you are going to start basic training in three days and then you are being shipped off to the Gulf. When did you decide all of this?” Steve came close rubbing both his hands up and down Tony’s arms trying to calm him down, but Tony backed away. Tony held his hands up trying to get some space to try to process what was being said.
·       He is the oldest of the Barnes bunch. Him and his siblings were raised in a normal household. They didn’t know their parents or extended families were avengers or assassins until their youngest sister was kidnapped by hydra and brainwashed to be the next winter soldier like their father was so many years ago.
·       Him and Kat have a past that no one knows about. She was in California one day and they “ran” into each other and the rest was history. It was the best summer of their lives but they both knew they had to go back to their individual lives. This happened two years ago and neither of them is willing to bring it back up. He wouldn’t admit it but that girl made him fall in love.
“Hey, Steve, do you want to get married ?” Steve continued playing with his hair not missing a beat.
Steve bounced from one foot to the other. He couldn't wait to jump out of the elevator and pull Tony in his arms and kiss him like no tomorrow. The elevator door finally opened. Steve stepped out and pause. He couldn’t believe his eyes. He was in shock but in awe. His bags fell from his hands and he just stood there staring. The man he left nine months ago was not the same man he came back to. Tony was pregnant and not just slightly pregnant. He was pregnant pregnant. Like he could have the baby any day. Tony just smiled at him as he held his belly in his hands. Steve just stared in awe.
“Steve! Who is she!” Tony’s whole body shook with anger. The flowers in his hands fell to the floor along with every dream they had ever had together. The girl with the long flowing blonde hair jumped out of the bed they shared together, gathering all of her things, and ran out of the door without another word. Leaving Tony staring at Steve with a shocked look on his face. Tony didn’t know what made him madder the fact that Steve cheated on him or that Steve wasn't trying to make a move to get up. To try and fight for their relationship.
“Well, yeah I still have feelings for you. They never stopped. Which whatever you say to me in the next five minutes might tell me if I’m still getting married tomorrow, Steve! I’m going to crush Rhodey’s heart like you crushed mine because it’s always been, you Steve.” Tony crossed his arms over his chest not allowing Steve away in. He wanted a response. Well, he really wanted Steve to pull him into his arms and have his way with him in bed. That wasn’t the right thing to do. Steve moved closer and Tony moved back allowing Steve to come fulling into the house.
·       Her family only came in contact with her once in the last two years. Before they were able to bring her home, she vanished.
“Remember the night at the office, yeah. So, I am pregnant and it’s a little girl.” Tony cradle his stomach without breaking eye contact. Then he saw the pain in Steve’s eyes. He saw the regret. Steve was so tired. Steve fell to his knee’s tears streaming down his face.
“Yes.” Click, the line went dead. That was it. He lost Rhodey forever. He turned away and found Steve staring at him. Steve outstretched his arms for Tony to be engulfed by them. Tony knew he made the right choice. “Can we leave? I don’t think I can be here anymore.” Steve walked Tony out of the house where they got into a taxi together. Tony laid his head on Steve's shoulder closing his eyes.
·       James is very serious and doesn’t like pranks. His sister, Brooklyn, and him often get into arguments when she does. One time she swapped his shampoo for blue hair dye. It didn’t come out for months.
“You’re sorry. What are you sorry about? Leaving close to two years ago without a goodbye. Never signing the divorce papers to let me go. Abandoning me and breaking our vows over some stupid government papers. Did you know if you just came back, and we could have talked I would have ripped those papers up and welcome you back? That didn’t happen because it’s the Steve Rogers show like always. Did you know that Peter and Harley miss you a lot? You let down your sons and your daughter.” Steve let Tony say his peace because he knew he wasn’t wrong. Then the last line hit him. Your daughter.
“If this is what you want then goodbye. But I don’t love you no less than I love Bucky.” Steve walked out leaving Tony alone. Tony slid down the close door with tears welling up in his eyes. He did the right thing. He deserved better than to be someone’s second choice. He deserved to be loved first. He deserved happiness even if his heart was breaking.
They were right. This man that came home wasn’t his Steve. First physical therapy was rough. Steve would get so frustrated some days that he would lash out at Tony.
“Did you move on with anyone?” Tony knew his answer by the way Steve dropped his hand and turned to look out into the yard. Tony rubbed his hand missing the touch.
“Yeah, we need to go now. These contractions are way too close together. At least my water hasn’t broken yet.” He had spoken too soon. He looked down as he watched his PJ pants become soaked. Tony looked up at Steve and saw the panic in his eyes. He knew he had it too.
·       He didn’t get his dad’s, Bruce’s smarts. He hated school and often skip class. He rather go surf with his buddies or wrestle with a monster.
“I guess it is.” Tony sobbed out. Tony closed his eyes as the tears ran down. Steve turned around leaving, knowing he couldn’t stay here anymore. He closed the door behind him. He stood in the hall fiddling with the ring around his neck.
“Steve” his voice dripping with sorrow. Steve traced the outline of Tony’s lips, already knowing the answer.
“A week after you left. Remember when I thought I just ate bad sushi. Nope.” Tony shrugged continuing to cradle his bump. “I’m sorry. I should have told you, but you were away, and I wanted you to focus on your mission. Are you mad?” Steve gently pulled Tony in closer for a kiss.
“I promise, my love. This is the place I ever want to be and that is here with you.” Steve kisses Tony one more time. “Now let’s get you inside and get you warm up.”
“Did you ever love me? Was I just a plaything to you? You punched a hole in your punch card. Marked off a name on your list.” Tony asked.
Tony slowly opened the box wanting to relive the memories once again for the last time. He knew that it was time to say goodbye. Especially since his first child would be here any day. It was time to get rid of his past. Tony opens the box to see the photos, the letters, the jacket. Tony grabbed the jacket remembering the exact moment when he gave him this jacket. It was senior year of high school and it was the night before graduation. Tony was cold because he always was, so he wrapped his leather jacket around Tony’s shoulders. Then Tony never gave it back. He smiled to himself at that memory placing the jacket to the side. Then he picked up the stack of letters. Each one was harder and harder to read each time. Tony read each one with tears beginning to form.
·       She also took some courses at NYU but got bored. She was already a published writer what was a college-going to teach her.
“Bucky and I got divorced.” Tony didn’t know how to process that information because that was what he ever wanted. Not to break up a marriage but to see two unhappy people move on with their lives.
“I can’t do this anymore, Steve. Why can’t you be a better man for me? Why can’t you choose me? I want to feel wanted.” Tony got up and pushed Steve out of the way. He went and gathered all of Steve’s belongings.
“It's working more of the head is coming.” Tony bore down until the head was finally out. Tony instinctively pushed Steve’s hand and continued working the baby out of his body. Steve was amazed at Tony. As the final push came their son slipped out and Tony pulled the baby to his chest with a sigh of relief and a few tears. Steve came around and kissed the top of Tony’s head.
“Steve, you are more than the military. Also, after this tour, you didn’t come back the same. You got hurt this time. What if you don’t make it this time around. I don’t think I can bear the thought of losing you. Please we can find you another job.” Tony pleaded. Steve shook his head no.
“Yes, Tony, I’m sure. Would you like to hear some options you may have?” The doctor placed a hand on his knee trying to comfort him the best she knew how. Tony placed his head in his hands not able to really concentrate on everything that was going on.
Two months came and went. So, did Tony’s due date. Tony was so over being pregnant. They tried everything from spicy food to yoga. There was only one thing they yet to try.
· He and Steve are actually the same most of the time. Steve taught him everything he knew. James got along with Tony more. When he had the nightmares and would get into arguments with Steve over something petty, he would run straight into Tony’s arms.
“He’s? It’s a boy.” Tony nodded. Then Tony felt a sharp pain knocking the wind out of him. Steve jumped up in worry. “Tony, what’s wrong? Are you okay?” Tony sucked in another breathe and moved over to the couch because the sudden pain in his back was too much to handle.
“You shouldn’t marry Rhodey tomorrow. And I know you love him, but you don’t love him in the way you love me. I can see it in your eyes. So, I have one question for you, Tony.” Steve dropped down on one knee causing Tony’s heart to stop. He began crying. “Will you marry me, right now? It doesn’t have to be anything special. We can go to the courthouse because Tony, baby, I can’t live another second without you. I was a stupid man for not choosing you. For hurting you. For not putting you first because you are the best thing to ever happen to me.”
“That’s your excuse every time that it isn’t the right time. Well if something doesn’t change then it will never be the right time, Steve. Do you even love me?” Steve whipped around to look at Tony in shock. Pain spread through his chest. How could Tony ever think that he didn’t love him? The thing was he loved Bucky too. Steve walked around the bed and kneeled down in front of Tony. He picked up both of his hands making Tony look up at him. Tony’s face showed sorrow. He was hurting Tony more than he ever wanted too.
·       He is in love with Brooklyn Rogers-Stark. He really wants to marry her and even has a ring picked out, but he does realize they are still young. He’s going to wait a few years before he does.
As each soldier was reunited with their family Tony was still standing alone. Where was Steve? Right as he asked that question his soldier was walking towards him. Tony dropped the sign and ran straight into his arms. Steve gathered him tight, kissing him hard. Missing the taste of Tony and his touch.
“Really, are you trying to make my life miserable? It wasn’t bad enough you came here three months ago throwing a wrench in my relationship because I realized I still have feelings for you.” Steve stood in the doorway shocked at what Tony was saying. At the same time, he wanted this to happened.
Steve found himself looking at Tony trying to push. Steve ran over placing a towel down. Tony leaned forward placing both hands on his shoulders and pushed again.
“I’m sorry, Tony, but I have to do this. I have to do this for me.” Steve step closer but Tony just stepped back. They stood still staring into one another’s eyes. Wishing they could read each other’s mind as they use to so many years ago.
It’s your birthday today. I bet you probably forgot because you are super busy. I know it's super weird, but I was craving cake and it’s your birthday, so I made it. Okay no I bought a cake for your birthday. It’s your favorite too. Yellowcake with chocolate frosting. I will save you a piece for when you get back. Speaking of your birthday I have a surprise for you. I feel like you will be really surprised with your present. It’s not here yet but it should arrive when you get back. It’s kind of on backorder. Don’t worry it will totally be worth the wait for when I see the look on your face when you see it. The team is doing amazing but it's so boring here. Miss my right-hand man. How’s the mission? No progress at all. Please tell me you at least found the base. I miss you a little more today than ever before. Your face is all over the news and they are throwing you a parade down in Brooklyn. I just wish the real thing was here with me. I miss your arms around me. I’m sending a picture of the fireworks outside. They are all red, white, and blue this year. I love you and please come home in one piece.
“It’s okay Tony. I understand. Goodbye, my love.” Steve walked over to the couch to grab his jacket to leave. He opened the door and walked out of the door leaving Tony with his thoughts. This was the right choice. He knew it, then why did he feel like he just made the biggest regret in his life.
·       She is a daddy’s girl through and through. All she had to do was bat her eyelashes at Steve and she would get anything she wanted. Some say she was spoiled but she does have a good head on her shoulders.
·       He went to the University of Maryland and went on to study gamma radiation. His biggest role model was his uncle Bruce.
“It burns Steve. I don’t know how much longer I can do this.” Steve rubbed Tony’s leg reassuring him that he could.
Tony turned his head placing a kiss on Rhodey’s lips and moved to get out of bed. They had a single day left before they were to be husband and husband. There still was a lot to be done. “That’s why you sir, future Mr. Stark, will be staying with Pepper tonight. I’m staying here to get the final touches done.” Rhodey grabbed hold of his hand pulling him back down to the bed. He just wanted five more minutes to have Tony in his arms before spending twenty-fours without him. Rhodey kissed along his jaw, down to his neck placing a hand under his shirt to caress Tony’s back. Tony jumped back from the touch moving off the bed to get ready. Tony saw the hurt that flashed on his fiancé’s face. It wasn’t the first time he stopped the attempt of having sex with him. Rhodey never brought it up which sometimes concerned Tony.
“Yes, but I need to call Rhodey.” Steve shook his head understanding. He let Tony go and Tony made his way outside so that the call was between the two.
I wish I could be there to celebrate with you, but I know the team will have something amazing planned for you. Please let them do it because you deserve it. Save me a slice of cake. It’s been kind of crazy around here. Could really use Ironman’s help or maybe just the great Tony Rogers-Stark? Make sure you aren’t boring yourself in the office all day. I know you can go stir crazy. I loved the photos you sent. I miss New York city so much. Also, why is Clint in the trash? Hey, maybe the next photos could be of you. I would really love to see your face. I miss it a lot. I miss hearing your voice and your touch. It gets really cold here and your embrace would be nice. I wish I could tell you more about my mission, but I promised you that I didn’t want to freak you out. Please send a picture. Only about four more months. I love you.
“Are you sure?” Tony nodded pulling Steve close for a kiss. All of what happened to them in the past several years just melted away. They pulled away. Steve looked down at Tony’s growing belly. Tony grabbed hold of Steve’s hand and place his where the baby was moving. Steve looked up at Tony in awe.
“Do you have to leave?” Tony laid against his back. He just wanted to feel his warmth one last time. It's going to be a lonely nine months. Steve turned around placing a kiss on the other man’s forehead.
“Last one. Wrap before you tap next time Rogers.” Steve looked over at Tony in shock. Peter and Harley were completely grossed out.
“Tony, no. You just need to have patience. I bet she will be here tonight.” Tony glared at him. Tony tried to force himself up from the couch. Steve ran over to help but Tony just waved him away.
·       Theo needs everything to be precise and nothing can be moved or out of place. Growing up Arne would often prank him by moving a book or picture frame. This would drive him insane.
“I’m so sorry. For everything. I had my head so far up my ass thinking I was right even though at the end of the day it didn’t even matter. I disappointed my team, the nation, but worst of all I let down my family.” Steve stayed on the ground crying not willing to move. All the anger was zapped out of Tony’s body. All he wanted was to bring the love of his life back home. He wanted his family back together. Tony carefully walked down the steps, wrapping his arms around Steve. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s legs and stayed there for a while.
·       They miss their brother a lot and don’t understand why he distanced himself from the family.
“Hey, the food will be here soon.” Pepper stopped in the door seeing what Tony was doing. Pepper just gestured at the mess but not questioning anything. Tony gathered all the stuff up and threw it in the trash.
“Hey, I see his head. He has brown hair! Keep pushing.” Steve exclaimed. Tony moved his hips wider trying to get more space, but the pain continues.
·       Freya focuses more on chemistry and biology. She almost figured out the cure for the common cold.
“I was just trying to do the right thing. What was I supposed to do allow her to lose her priceless diamond earring?” Steve wheezed out. “But enough about me. I want to know about you. How’s life? Are you seeing anyone?” Steve leaned forward and placed a hand on top of Tony’s knee sending shock waves through Tony’s body. Tony looked up at Steve’s eyes knowing the response he wanted. Tony placed his hand overtopped the hand. It lingered there for several seconds until Tony moved Steve’s hand away. He stood up and walked into the kitchen not wanting to be in the same room with Steve anymore.
“Mr. Tony Stark?” Tony shook his head yes. “We just want to let you know Captain Rogers was in a helicopter accident. He and his crew went down after several shots being fired at them. We regret to inform you.”
“Rhodey and I explored our feelings for each other um six months after I told you to get the hell out. He was always my best friend Steve but him as a partner is nothing, I have ever experience.” Tony saw the hurt flash over Steve’s face.  Tony pushed it out of his mind reminding himself that Steve had his chance. “We got engaged five months ago and we are getting married in November. I’m happy Steve. He makes me happy.” Steve’s shoulders slumped knowing he was happy for Tony, the love of his life, but he wished he were the one marring him not Rhodey.
“Explain, please darling.” Tony huffed and rolled his eyes. He never thought his husband would ever turn down sex.
Tony laid in bed looking at the one number he shouldn't call. He was getting married tomorrow and if he called this number, he probably wouldn’t be getting married. He threw his phone across the room in frustration. This was all Steve’s fault. Tony was finally happy after not being so for so many years which mostly was because of Steve. He was happy with Rhodey. If he was then why did he have to keep telling himself, he was. Then there was a knock on his door that he really hoped it was Happy telling him that the harpist canceled or something that inconvenient happened. Tony pulled on his robe trudging into the living room. He opened the door; mad to see the last person he wanted to see.
·       After she found out her parents were the Black Widow and Winter solider, she started her training to become the next Black widow. Her parents were skeptical at first since they both knew the horrors could insure through the role.
“Mr. Rogers-Stark is eight cm. dilated. It is ill-advised to go to the hospital. Captain, I recommend you prep to deliver your child. The emergency kit is in the nursery. Mr. Rogers-Stark please move to the bedroom. That will be the easiest place to give birth.” Steve sprang to action and helped Tony up and move him into the bedroom. Every few steps they had to stop because a contraction came. Tony leaned against Steve unable to stand up by himself for a long time. Tony let out a scream of pain. His whole body shook under Steve’s grip. Steve rubbed soothing circles along his partner's lower back wanting to help in any way possible. He hated seeing Tony in so much pain in such a short period of time.
It was always hard to leave for missions. This time around felt a lot harder since Steve was going to be gone for nine long months and that was the longest he and Tony had been away from each other since they got married. Steve finished packing all of his supplies in his bag. Just a few extra weapons and trail mix by Tony’s pleads. Steve just giggled to himself at how much of a worrier Tony Stark really was. Steve paused with packing when he felt arms wrap around him.
“I missed you too so much. I promise to never leave again.” Steve pulled them in tighter never letting go.
·       James has above average IQ and ended up graduating Highschool at the age of fourteen like his old man. Steve wasn’t thrilled that his son didn’t get to grow up like a completely normal child. Instead of shipping him off to some boarding school or to college before he was mature enough. Steve homeschooled him on combat training, cooking, and other life lessons.
“Hey, honey we agreed. No contact until we say I do. Is everything okay?” Rhodey could hear the sniffles from Tony indicating he had been crying. Rhodey knew something was wrong.
“Hey, we have pen and paper like the old days. It’s kind of romantic. I always dreamed that I would have a chance to write letters to the love of my life like the other soldiers got to do.” Tony smiled liking that idea. Being able to keep those letters forever and read them whenever. To be able to be teleported back to this exact moment.
“Cap, please tell me why you are standing on my front porch soaking wet.” Steve took in a deep breath not really knowing why he was here. He knew there was a hole in his heart where Tony used to lie. He realized that he was being a jerk two years ago. It wasn’t fair for all three of them for what Steve had done. He never should have fallen in love with Tony. He knew that was a lie because Tony was the only good thing in his life and when he left. Steve couldn’t blame him; he probably would have too. When Tony left, he realized that his life was a mess and that was putting it lightly.
·       He is gay and still looking for the right one. He struggles to find love when you compare every relationship to your parents. Nothing could ever compare to their love story.
·       Him and his dad are super close. They do everything together. So, does him and his uncle Sam. The three of them will go on all kinds of adventures. They often find themselves at baseball games.
Life was amazing for fourteen years. Steve and Tony were happily married. Peter was so smart and such a great kid. Then not even a year after they had Peter, Harley was born. He was a wild child but in a more curious way. He and Peter were always getting in trouble like brothers do. Steve and Tony continued being heroes. They couldn’t give it up and their kids loved telling everyone that their dads were superheroes. Everything was amazing until it wasn’t.
Then the airport battle came. That was what broke them completely. Not just the team but their marriage. Steve left for good taking only a bag with him. Tony filed for divorce. His happily ever after was gone. Twenty years of being together were flushed down the toilet all because Steve wanted to be right. Tony knew if Steve would have just come back home, Tony would have ripped up those damn accords and never look back. All he wanted was his family back.
“Wait, I love you.” Tony didn’t turn because if he looked into Rhodey’s eyes he knew it would just make it harder for him to say it back.
Steve cradled Sarah as Tony slept. Steve heard a knock on the door to find Peter and Harley waiting to come in. Steve gestured for them to come in but be quiet.
Tony felt like he couldn’t breathe. He turned away from Steve and brought his hands to his face trying to collect his composer. It just made it worse because all he saw was the pictures of him and Rhodey happy during different stages of their relationship. The last thing he wanted to do was hurt him, but he would be hurting him more if he married him when Tony had feelings for another person. Tony turned back around pulling Steve up to his feet and wrapped him in a tight hug. Tony had to make sure he was there and wouldn’t disappear again.
“It hurts. He feels stuck. You are going to have to help guide the baby out.” Tony led his hand down his opening. He could feel his baby's head but knew he would tear if he didn’t get some help. Steve looked unsure until Tony screamed out in pain. Tony grabbed his hand and guided him down. Steve worked at his opening slowly working it wider as Tony continued to push. Tony felt the burning as his opening began to get stretched to its limit. Tony whined at the pain. Steve looked up at Tony with sorrowful eyes until he felt the most amazing thing in his hand. His son’s little nose.
“Well, it was nice seeing you, Steve. Have a good night.” Rhodey left leaving them alone. Steve stared at Tony waiting for answers even though he had no right for them. Tony held up his ring which Steve finally understood what it meant.
·       He is a model out in California for nine months of the year and the other three months he’s back at home in Asgard to fill his princely duties. He stopped doing that three years ago.
“No, I have one option. I’m keeping this miracle even though it came at the worst possible time.” Tony looked up at the doctor and saw only her smile. He felt a little better.
“They’re fine. They just heard all of this mess. I think they are already scarred for life.” Peter just laughed.
“I’m so proud of you. You did such an amazing job. He’s beautiful.” They looked up at each other knowing exactly what the name of their child will be. They’ve talked about this name forever.
“Oh, Tony, but it’s okay. I got this. We got this. Do you want to sit while I go grab the stuff?” Tony shook his head no but gesture Steve to go get the stuff. He was fine in a squatting position anyways.
“Yeah, I’m sure. I should have done that years ago. That was my past, you are my present and this little one.” Tony bent down holding Pepper’s stomach. “Is my future and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Tony kissed her knowing this was the happiness he wanted and always dreamed of.
October came and went. It was finally November 1st and Steve was coming home. Tony was so excited but a little nervous too. He wasn’t sure what Steve would think about his surprise. Tony bet he would love it. He would have to because it was too late to return. Tony laughed. Jarvis had notified him that Steve was coming up the elevator. Tony sucked in a breath. His excitement was becoming uncontrollable.
Life is weird. One second you are planning your whole life with one person. Imagining all of the possibilities. Then the next thing you know you are married to some other person for the last five years and you haven’t spoken to the person of the forgotten life in ten years. It’s weird but Tony often didn’t think about the forgotten man. He only came across the genius’s mind once and a while but cleaning out the closet was making him come back full force. Tony ran his fingers across the forgotten box. He knew he needed to get rid of the old memories for his sake. Pepper never pushed him to throw them away. She understood why he kept it but that didn’t mean Pepper didn’t wish they were gone. That he would move on. Tony was happy with his life so why was it so hard to throw this man away.
“No, I’m putting my foot down this time Steve. You can’t do another especially after this one.” Tony scowled.
“Hey, Steve, I was wonder what was taking you so long out hear dear.” Steve was awestruck as he saw the scene in front of him unfold. Rhodey wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist bringing him for a side hug and then leaned down and kissed him on the cheek. Steve’s heart broke all over again. He was too late, and he couldn’t blame anyone but himself. Tony whispered to Rhodey telling him he will be right back in a minute.  Rhodey shook his head saying okay but he still looked between the two men not liking the situation.
“It’s time to go soldier.” Steve frown and nodded a yes. Steve grabbed his bag and strapped on his shield.
“Flight 219 has landed. Your soldiers are coming home.” Tony held a sign up saying welcome home Captain Rogers. He bounced from one foot to another unable to stay in one spot. His man was finally coming home.
“A proper goodbye. A way to close out the chapter of my life that never felt finished.” Steve hugged Tony.
·       She’s single as well and not looking. She likes being independent but that hasn’t stopped the boys from drooling all over her.
Then the accords happened. Tony’s world fell apart after that. It first started with the intense conversations at work over the accords and if they both would sign it. Then slowly the intense conversations turned into arguments that carried into the house. Their marriage was falling apart at the seams. Steve was never at home. Tony basically turned into a single parent.
“Want anything to drink? Beer?” Steve nodded sitting quietly. He didn’t really know what he was doing there. Steve came to visit Bucky and Sam after deciding to travel after hurting Tony. That was the last thing he ever wanted to do, and he did. Steve still remembered the night. He didn’t like to but that was his curse right.
“Of course, I’m not mad. In shock, yes but mad never. I’m so excited right now.” Steve bent down hesitantly placing both hands on top of Tony’s belly. “Hey, baby, it’s your daddy. I know I haven’t been here, but I can’t wait to meet you.” Then Steve felt something hitting his hand. Steve looked up at Tony with large eyes in excitement.
“Oh, Ste.” Tony paused when he looked over and realized that no one was there. Tears streamed down his face. His life wasn’t supposed to end up like this. Tony’s family wasn’t supposed to be broken like his was growing up. How did this happen?
Then July came and went without a word from Steve. Tony wasn’t quite worried yet. He was a little because Steve was half of his heart. Then when August came and went without a single note from Steve. Tony became really worried. Steve was on his mission alone with no backup. There was no way to communicate with him since all service was cut off. They couldn’t go in and rescue him which could jeopardize the whole mission. The team was worried too, but they need to keep Tony calm. They kept reminding him that it’s only been two months. He might be fine, and the letter was lost in transport. Tony knew that a lot can happen in two months. Tony knew he couldn’t think of a worst-case scenario. Then the best thing that happened to him in a while. The letter came.
“Hey, want to go another round.” The girl stroked a finger up and down his chest trying to get his attention. Steve continued fiddling with the ring around his next that he hadn’t taken off in ten years and he never will.
Laughter filled the room as it did many years ago. Steve and Tony talked like no time passed between them. Like there was never any pain or regret that came from their relationship. Just all of the happiness. This might have been because of the twenty beers they had between each of them. It could be because they never stopped caring for one another.
“Honey, are you in labor?” Tony shook his head yes unable to really say much as he waited out the contraction. Tony knew these contractions were coming way too fast. If they didn’t get a move on, they would be having this baby here.
“Steve! Get in here now!” Steve dropped everything and ran into their bedroom. All he could see was Tony leaning against the shower wall. Tony gave him the widest grin but then his smile faded as he bent forward in pain.
Love. Happiness. Joy. Home. Security. That is something everyone has a dream of. This is all anyone wants. This was all Tony ever wanted. He thought he found it but he thought wrong.
·       He’s a playboy but he treats women with respect. He had some pretty tough aunts and his aunt Valkyrie would probably kick his ass if he did anything wrong.
·       He’s the black sheep among all of his family even his extended family. That’s probably why he went out to California.
“Pops!” Steve and Tony turned around to see their sons standing on the front porch. They stood waiting for their dad’s permission to proceed forward. Steve stood up and outstretched his arms and the boys ran straight into them. They might be seventeen and fifteen but that didn’t mean they still didn’t miss their pops.
·       She was a wonderful surprise for the group. Natasha and Bucky thought they were done since Ivan was 5, Kat was 7 and Alexander was 9. They were long done with the whole baby thing.
Unlike her brother, she graduated from school at eighteen. She took dual enrollment classes and extra courses. She participated in sports like cheer and soccer. She was raised completely different than her brother since she doesn’t really reminder when her parents were Captain America and Iron man. They were just her dad and pops.
“Am I the reason you cry every night?” Tony shook his head yes. “Oh, Tony. There is nothing I can say to make this all right. That night was the worst night of my life. When you kicked me out, I knew I had to change. I had to work on myself so, that one day I could come back and love you right. I was so stupid for breaking your heart and letting you go.  That’s why I’m here tonight.” Steve tilted Tony’s head up. “To say I’m sorry. To say I still love you. To say I want to do this over only if you are willing to. If not it’s okay because the last four hours, we spent together was the best moment in my life.” Tony pulled Steve down closer and kissed his lips. Tony took in the moment loving how nothing had changed even though everything had. Tony pulled back placing his forehead on to Steve’s to take in the final moments of the one thing he had dreamed of.
“It was for the best. We didn’t care for each other as we did many moons ago. Bucky moved on with Sam and they are really happy together. They have that same spark that." Steve didn’t finish the sentence only looked down at Tony’s hand still stroking each finger. Tony knew what he was going to say, that same spark that me and you had. Tony bit down on his lip so as not to do something that he would regret but his body was reaching out for Steve. Missing Steve.
“Come on you have to see Sarah’s room. Harley painted the whole thing fairyland theme.” Steve mouthed to Tony, Sarah, really? Tony grinned knowing that it had to be Sarah no matter what was going on between them.
·       She was not the same girl that was taken from them, Nat and Bucky knew that, but they didn’t know how much it would hurt. Seeing the blankness in their little girl’s eyes and knowing that no matter what they did, they couldn’t protect her.
Tony and Steve laid in bed after their wonderful “date”. They skipped the food and went straight to dessert. Tony placed his head next to Steve’s heart listening to the rhythm. Steve kissed the top of his head. Tony smiled knowing this was a perfect time to ask a question he knew was crazy to ask but he truly was in love.
·       Brooklyn is a dreamer but also a futurist like her dad. She is ten steps ahead of everyone and get herself out of trouble.
I get what you mean these letters really do take forever to get here. I was a little worried something had happened but then your letter came, and I could finally breathe. Also, why couldn’t you tell me about Bucky and Natasha before you left? Of course, they have been going at it like rabbits. Have seen the looks they give each other. Those are our looks. It’s been pretty quiet here. I’ve been staying in the office a lot more. Got a lot of Avenger’s paperwork to do so, haven’t really been in the field lately. If I tell you the truth, I don’t really miss it. Weird right. The tower is so quiet with everyone gone on their own missions. Rhodey is coming into town for a little bit. I wish you were here though. I miss our movie nights. I really want to watch Star Wars, but it isn’t the same without you. Sending a few more photos. One is with Clint stuck in the trash can. Don’t ask how that happened. The other one is of New York. The lights are so pretty. I miss you so much.  Only five more months.
Tony’s heart quickened wanting to remove all the space between them. Silence fell over both of them. Fuck it, for the closure, Tony thought. Tony grabbed Steve’s shirt and pulled him in for a kiss. Steve didn’t back away but deepen the kiss. Steve wrapped his hands around his waist pulling him closer making them melt into each other. They kissed until they heard the door behind them begin to open. Tony jumped back quickly trying to pretend that the last few minutes didn’t happen.
“Wait!” Steve halted at the door of a cab of the voice he wanted to hear for the rest of his life. He smiled and turned around to see Tony standing in nothing but a t-shirt and a pleading look. “I love you too. Don’t leave ever again.” Steve ran over to Tony abandoning the cab to pull him tight into his arms.
“Babe, I forgive you. I forgive you for everything. Just come home.” Steve stood up and looked at Tony for reassurance.
“You look happy, Tony. Have a good life.” Steve turned around leaving Tony on the front porch watching as he drove away. Tony turned around to go back inside feeling hollow. No that wasn’t it. The way he felt couldn’t be explained. He opened the door and walked inside to see Rhodey smiling up at him and he smiled back not wanting him to worry.
“Tony, how could you ever ask me if I ever loved you. I do love you. I see a world of just you and me living our happily ever after.” Steve came over and placed a hand on Tony’s arm allowing him to see deep into his amber eyes. A slight tear escaped down his tan skin. Steve squeezed his eyes shut not wanting to see the hurt he caused anymore.
Tony didn’t understand why his ex was standing on his front porch. He and Steve hadn't spoken after Tony told him he wasn’t willing to be someone’s second choice. That he needed to go back to Bucky, his husband. Which was two years ago not like Tony was counting or anything. He found happiness even if he thought he never would have again.
·       She was popular in school but in a way that Kat didn’t realize she was. She did her own thing and change as quickly as the seasons. She would just get bored easily. Maybe that was her mother coming out of her.
·       He’s quiet and analytical. Ivan makes fun of him all the time for having his nose in a book all of the time.
“Oh, what do you mean the wrong one. That Stark boy he sure looks happy for the first time because I remember when he was young.” Steve looked up at the bartender as she shook her head in disappointment. “That boy had a lot of pain in his eyes. He sometimes would find himself stumbling in here being more than drunk. I’m glad he found someone that loves him because I feel he never had that before he met the colonel.” Steve clenched his jaw trying not to say anything. This lady didn’t know what she was talking about. Tony was loved long before him and Rhodey became an item because he loved him. Steve slammed some crumpled bills from his pocket onto the counter and left. This was his last chance.
They say two years isn’t a long time. You blink and it's over. They were wrong. This had been the longest two years of Tony’s life. Yeah, they had the occasional phone calls. They wrote to each other every day. But when special things came up, it made Tony feel really alone. Christmas didn’t exist, birthdays either, or anniversaries. It was okay because Steve was coming home, and Tony had everything set up for the best date they have had in a long time. Tony even had a surprise.
“Wait, Rogers, you're telling me that you got to meet the Queen of England just because you are the nicest guy in the world.” Steve cackled throwing a hand over his chest. Tony smiled loving the sound that came from the other man.
·       When she was twelve, she was taken by Hydra agents and brainwashed. They put her through the same training as her dad once was to turn her into the new Winter soldier.
“Hello, Tony.” Steve stood in the doorway looking like the man Tony fell in love with so many years ago. The plain white t-shirt, brown leather jacket, and his dog tags; the ones Tony used to wear so Steve was always close to his heart. “So, I was in the neighborhood and I thought why not come here.” Steve shrugged. Tony took in a deep breath and ushered the man inside.
Steve laid flat on his back trying to catch his breath. After going four rounds with, Steve tried to remember the brunet’s name. Amy? Maybe? Steve rolled his eyes not really caring. All the names have blurred over the years which has gotten him in trouble once in a while. It wasn’t like he didn’t care about them; he gave every single one of his hookups gratitude, but the thing is they weren’t the ghost that haunted him every night. No one could replace him. Trust him, he tried. Steve desperately wanted to forget the man's late-night adventures and stolen kisses. Steve was in a few pretty stable and long-term relationships but each one couldn’t compare to him. So, Steve just gave up trying to replace him. Instead, Steve had a little fun. Some would say he was a playboy. He would say he never was playing a game. The rules were given upfront with no tricks. Steve pulled the girl closer into his arms as he began to be lost in thought.
"Like I said, it was just a lullaby passed down from Irish families. Mostly from those who didn't live in the cities. Ma used to sing it to me every night I was sick... so every night." He chuckled. "When I woke up in this century, I figured, it had died out. But I guess not"
When they clasped hands, Steve's face changed. His smile turned into a menacing grin and pulled Tony into the mirror with him.
They’d been at the balcony waiting for the fireworks to start and Tony had been working on his tablet (which he proudly boasts his baby brother made when he was just 13—in your face, Richards!) while he and Steve were at the bar stools drinking with Sam and Nat. Sam was talking about some bullshit about being the fastest pilot to ever grace the US Airforce and Nat was rolling her eyes and taking sips of her vodka mix. He noticed Steve had gone silent and glanced at the blond who was
Tony guided him to a chair near them and had him sit down. He stood near the man as he waited for him to calm himself.
“I’d bury you alive if you didn’t, punk” Bucky replied as he took the outstretched hand and pulled himself to stand.
"I really was just surprised Tony..." Steve lowered his forehead as far as Tony's horns allowed. "I really do want you and I'm sorry if you thought otherwise." He said pressing a kiss to the horns.
They spend the night together, huddled away in their pod. Exchanging kisses and touches, tracing the stars on their skins. They fall asleep with smiles on their exhausted forms.
Bucky was snickering and Steve himself was trying to hide an amused smile. Jarvis remembered the night ending with all three boys being sent to bed early as a result of Maria’s fury. He remembered being amused by the two army boys rushing and sneaking into Tony’s room with a bottle of champagne and three glasses.
“What’re you thinkin’ about now?” He slurred his speech from sleep but Tony heard a hint of smugness and satisfaction from the blond’s voice. He giggled when Steve raised the arm draped across the younger man’s lap to hook him closer and kissed the brunet’s navel. Tony hummed and ran a hand across Steve’s blond locks before he sighed.
(read: one-night stands) came by to drop off his apparent son. James Buchanan Barnes was twelve years old when he was handed to the Starks when his mother couldn’t afford to keep and care for him and his three half-sisters. This resulted to a tense atmosphere in the household as Maria gave Howard the silent treatment. James, for his part, was immediately taken by young master Anthony. He wouldn’t leave the infant alone and when the nannies (who got fired for flirting with Howard) or Maria couldn’t take care of the baby, James took it upon himself to be the big brother little Anthony needed. A month into his arrival to the mansion, Maria was showering James with affection that no one could have foretold. For several months, the Stark household was lively and everything was normal with the exception of Maria ignoring her husband and doting over both James and Anthony.
Rhodey wrapped his arms around his best friend who asked if he wanted something to drink and did the same to the others in the room before he exited to the kitchen.
It may have something to do with his father's past as rocket scientist/engineer and the ever infamous story of their lost Captain.
“it’s not that simple, Jay.” Tony drew back and sat up straight. He kept on refusing to look at the older man in the eye which worried the Brit.
"Y-yes. Yes, Steve. Steven Grant Rogers." He said in between breaths. "C-Captain of the Nomad Voyage. I was-- my ship-"
His suit was covered in burns and his skin was a  bit singed. His chest pad luckily still had the name plate tho a bit melted by an apparent fire.
“Mmh… Steve” he moaned out. Tony opened his eyes and scrubbed the sleep away. His eyes widened when he saw the form of Steve draped over his still naked body, licking away at his hip. Little Tony stood at attention and he blushed as Steve smiled at him.
When Tony was sixteen years old, back home from spring break, Jarvis found out just how deep the teenager’s feelings for Steve were. He remembered the young master shutting himself in his workplace and only coming out on trips to the bathroom. He barely ate and barely slept, kept to himself, and became recluse. His mother got worried for the first few days, then days turned into weeks. When it neared a month of Tony’s self-isolation, his mother had barred him from entering the workplace.
Steve stood up as he let go of Tony’s hand, looking down at Tony who was still looking disheveled and well ravished. He licked his bottom lip, eyes darkening with satisfied possessiveness which Tony caught on.
The rest of the hour was spent with Tony showering and cleaning up himself and Steve trying to find clothes that would fit his smaller lover’s body. Then they went out to get bagels and of course, to finally face a getting-over-his-hangover James Buchanan Barnes-Stark.
It did, very much. Especially when Tony shaved properly, and even shaved the rest of his body. Steve felt hot just thinking of the smooth skin hidden beneath the shirt and bodice, beneath the stockings, beneath his undergarment.
At once, in the darkness of his room, a light popped up, right before his nose, and Tony yelped with surprise.
“Bucky’s my best friend and roommate,” explains Steve. “He’s my only family. We enrolled together, and he lost his arm in the war.”
He had worked all yesterday on it. He hadn’t erased much, he had just redrawn Tony’s hands and arms so he wouldn’t be fucking himself anymore, but most of the rest had been left untouched. Steve had honestly thought that the drawing wasn’t pornographic anymore, but a beautiful nude, but… but obviously, Tony hated it.
And Tony, who was about to ask her how she knew his name, fell silent as he observed a menacing figure entering the glade. It was a man, dressed in a black hooded cape, and whose head was bright red.
Steve shook his head, his lips forming the now familiar pout that always left Tony with a strange, fuzzy feeling in his chest.
’, that made the haze dissipate, and the nice boneless feeling left suddenly, replaced by shards of ice splintering through his bones as Tony remembered exactly
“Back then, when you said you could grant me a wish, you told me you could lead me to the mystery singer. And I took that literally. But that’s not what my wish was about, wasn’t it? If so, you would’ve disappeared as soon as I would’ve met Steve. But you’re still here. My wish… my wish is to be with Steve, isn’t it?”
“Her house is a good quarter from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There’s a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place,” said Tony.
“Let’s go,” rasps Tony, sliding off his tool and reaching into his inner pocket for his purse. He throws a few bills on the counter. It probably covers Steve’s drink, but Steve still stubbornly takes out a few coins to pay his own.
“Didn’t get to see him, though,” got on Bucky, ignoring him, and he shoves a piece of cake in his mouth. “Was he really that pretty?”
Steve’s head is spinning, and he takes a moment to recover, eyes closed and breathing deeply. Tony pulls out of him and collapses next to him, panting and swearing, whole body trembling.
Steve gets a name a few days later. A woman with fiery red hair, wearing a tailor and high-heels, visits Peggy’s Art Gallery. She presents herself as Ms Potts, the PA of Stark Innovations’ CEO, and asks for Steve’s paintings. She seems to know exactly what paintings she’s looking for and describes them with precision. Peggy and Steve are ecstatic, and Steve feels light-headed when he hears the price Ms Potts is ready to pay. He can’t accept such a price, it’s really too much for his average art, but Peggy accepts it, elbowing painfully Steve in the ribs before he can utter a word.
Hope you enjoyed and see you next time for the third and last chapter! Don't hesitate to comment to express your feelings! Kudos are also always appreciated! <3
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve assured him, and hesitantly reached for his hand, holding it preciously. Tony jerked up, and they stared into each other’s eyes for a long moment, Steve not daring to move anymore.
, and he doesn’t know what he’s saying, and all he can think of is the maroon silky thong that matched Tony’s shirt, and…
. Steve had been selfishly indulging in the sick fantasy of having Bucky and Tony get along, and that… that was unacceptable. Ashamed of himself, Steve nodded;
Immediately the golden rope fell down and Tony noted, a bit weirded out, that it was indeed made of blond hair. He started to climb up. To be honest, he almost gave up after the few first feet, for the climb was long and exhausting, but Jan kept needling him and making jabs at his pride, so in the end Tony climbed it all and finally reached the window, panting like a dying ox. A pair of strong, bony hands took hold of his, and he was pulled up into the tower.
It’s Thor. He’s loud. Therefore of course everyone hear him, fall silent and stare at Steve, and Steve is now beet-red. Bucky complains loudly;
“Hey, it’s just me!” said Jan, as she flew before his face. Her whole body was emitting a warm golden light, and as always, she was smiling.
“Could you maybe…” started Steve, and then he stood up, putting aside the drawing and his coals. He hovered over Tony, his hands reaching for his opened shirt and sliding the clothing down Tony’s shoulders. “You don’t need to take it off,” he said, flushing, “But it’d be nice if I could see your musculature a bit better.”
And Tony could actually imagine it, having Steve there at the city with him. He could see them living together at the house he shared with Rhodey, Pepper, and her husband-to-be Happy. He could hear Steve’s kind and caring voice and his superb singing - he would sing in the house, in the church, in the nearby theater, and be admired and loved by everyone-, he could feel Steve’s affectionate hands on him, his lips pressing a gentle kiss on his mouth, his lithe body curl around Tony’s, he could see Steve’s pouting smile and tender cerulean eyes.
It takes a while before they can catch their breath, and Steve is tempted to use his inhalator for a moment, but he’s lying spent in Tony’s arms and doesn’t have the strength to move.
Tony’s hips bucked up. He moaned deeply, pushing into the slick, warm embrace of Steve’s hand. Steve moved to bestride him, his knees pressing against Tony’s hips. He freed his thumb from Tony’s mouth and embraced him, his arm wrapping securely around him, his hand splayed on the small of his back. Still gazing into Tony’s eyes, forehead against his, Steve smiled, gently and adoringly, whispering;
Hope you enjoyed! Kudos and comments are loved. Don't hesitate to tell if you've spotted some mistake in my English, or if I missed a tag. Next chapter in a few!
“I don’t know. Back in my village, no one even knew his last name. I’m the only one who knows, because he told me.”
It seems Tony Stark had been really famous for a while, with a playboy reputation, until he had almost died from drug abuse. Since then, he had retired from the public. It took years for the paparazzi to leave him alone; they had even followed him to his numerous rehabs. There are pictures of a sick-looking, exhausted and so young Tony Stark, obviously still in rehab, and that makes Steve want to punch those assholes to the moon. Finally, Tony not playing around anymore didn’t make him interesting enough in their eyes, so they stopped hounding him. Occasionally, there is an article here and then, but Steve doesn’t read those rags, which is why he hadn’t known about him. Steve also finds out with surprise that he used to be the CEO of Stark Industries, before he was stripped from his own company by Obadiah Stane -that bald guy who always appears on TV talking about the weapons Steve had been very familiar with during his time in the army-. It shouldn’t be a surprise; it
He didn’t know what to say, didn’t know how to hold on to him, how to convince him to listen to him and hear him out. They couldn’t leave it at that. He couldn’t let Tony leave still thinking that Steve had treated him so poorly because of a lack of trust and friendship when it hadn’t been the case at all…
And it was because Tony knew that ‘better than most’, that his most loyal friends were now Rhodey, a man with the darkest skin, and Pepper, a woman with fiery red hair. Rhodey who, while born in the city, was considered a stranger, a heretic, a barbarian. Pepper who was considered a child of the devil because of the color of her hair, a witch because as a woman she dared compete with men.
The heavy golden braid uncoiled from the windows down to the ground, and he climbed up. Steve was waiting for him at the window sill, eyes lit up and piercing blue, and he helped Tony in. Tony had barely set foot inside that Steve was already wrinkling his nose.
“I mean it” he breathes in the shell of Steve’s ear, and Steve shivers, “I’m interested in you. I like people like spitfire, and that’s exactly what you are. Also, I want to see those eyes of yours in full light.”
Voice deliberately neutral, just as it had been during the whole time they had fought together, on the same side for the first time in years. While the Infinity Wars had brought the Avengers back together for Earth’s survival, their gathering had been but a necessity -it hadn’t mended any of Steve and Tony’s burnt bridges-.
“Oh,” he said, looking both disappointed and ashamed. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean… Hey, I’m not going to try anything, relax.”
They remained immobile for a moment, working on catching back their breath, and then Steve kissed his shoulder as a warning and carefully slid out of him, rolling on his back. Tony turned over and cuddled against him, and they fell asleep. They were lying half on grass, half on a crumpled mess of Tony’s skirts, but they didn’t mind. The sun was now high in the sky, its rays were warm on their skin, and there was no wind to cool them off. Eventually, as the air turned a little colder, they woke up, and Steve licked him clean, making Tony laugh and squirm when he lapped at his skittish sides and nipples, and then moan in pleasure when he reached more intimate parts, which ended in them making love again, though this time they simply embraced each other, kissing and caressing the other.
“There’s got to be a door somewhere,” he said, and was ready to approach it to check on the other side when the fairy stopped him.
Inexplicably, Ironteddy had committed the biggest crime of his kind: showing humankind that teddies were alive. Yet, there was no retribution, little children everywhere still cuddled their teddies to sleep with none the wiser. That was because Mr Stark had never told anyone about what he saw. That night, he took Ironteddy to his workshop and asked him all sorts of questions, the most animated Ironteddy had ever seen him. Ironteddy, alive that he was, still could not talk, so he could only write down his answers with pen and paper. And there were so much that he could write. There had never been a person who could comprehend all that Ironteddy had to say, and it sure was a lot. For all that he lacked in fundamental understanding on physics and chemistry and biology and, he still had myriads of ideas on creative toys and machines and cars. Ironteddy could not stop himself if he wanted to nd Mr Stark only encouraged him, urging him to draw and write and calculate and design. They spent days holed up in the workshop going through the many ideas that Ironteddy had stored in his head, smoothing over errors and planning up the framework. At the end of that week, Ironteddy was close to bursting with love, love and pride had wormed and entwined into every bit of stuffing in him, so much that his small body could hardly hold it all in. Ironteddy told himself,
Years later, Ironteddy still lived with Obie. Stane Industries were stronger than ever, specialising in manufacturing weapons for the army, all designed by the one famous Ironteddy. He was soon known as the Teddy of Death and he took it all in stride, for it had no grand meaning to him. He himself did not even know what humans used his inventions for. He just created and created, making a reality of his thoughts and ideas to cater to whatever Obie asked him to do. Need a missile that had a longer range? Or a faster sleeker jet? Ironteddy could make them all. The more he created the more Obie loved him, which in turn fed him energy and allowed him to create even more. It was a perfect relationship. Most of the time he was cooped up in the workshop, knowing nothing else but the tools and metals and his bots beeping underfoot and whatever JARVIS deemed important enough to tell him. Sometimes though, Obie would bring him to launching parties and press conferences, acting as a reassuring sight as Obie talked about whatever new products or announcements they had. He was not usually asked for an opinion for he could not speak and that made for an awkward interview, but every now and then he would scribble an anecdote on paper and show it to the crowd who went wild as if on cue. He sometimes had to go to board meetings to explain his new designs, and eventually it was too much for a teddy bear to remember, so they hired him a fierce redhead named Pepper.
“Oh no no no Bruce, I know that face, stop that face right now! For the last time, you’re not that kind of doctor! For fuck’s sake, am I the only one who remembers that he’s got PhDs in Physics, which has nothing to do with having a medical degree? And what were you doing reading a biology paper?”
Steve took a hesitant step toward him, and then reached up, cupping Tony’s face with his warm hands.
Sarah could never heal from the grief of losing her only child, and every day for many years Joseph would return to the forest calling for the fairy. But the fairy never came, and he had to renounce to see his child ever again.
Ms Potts rolls her eyes, nods in salutation to them all, and disappears in the crowd. And then Jan claps excitedly.
“I… I’m not going to stay forever at your village,” said Tony, suddenly, his throat closing up in unexpected sadness. “My work there will probably end in a couple of days.”
“Let me get the Hell out of here, Steve!” screamed Tony, turning over and grabbing Steve by the shoulders, shaking him like a rag doll.
It was just that he had been fooling himself in being someone he was not, that his mind had been deeply convinced something his heart genuinely wanted had been wrong, that he had been killing off a part of himself, and now everything had been wasted. Tony had spoiled the beautiful thing that had been blooming between Steve and him.
“That’s scary. The Schmidt from my city is a dangerous guy, lots of people are afraid of him and of what he could do if he ever succeeded in taking over the city. I know some awful people who benefited from him, too.”
He keeps thrusting gently and slowly into Tony, dropping butterfly kisses all over his shoulders and nape. He loves Tony’s nape and buries his nose in his hair, inhales his scent. Tony has a leg bent, making it easier for Steve to go deep. One of Tony’s hands is laying flat on the mattress, the other playing with the pillow’s hem. Steve doesn’t know why, but there’s an intense longing tightening his chest, and so he reaches up and puts his hand on Tony’s, squeezes it tenderly. Tony glances back at him, and smiles.
Tony blinked, the dream peeling away. In truth, their shared house was crumbling, Pepper and Happy were having trouble with the glassmakers’ guild because their guildmates couldn’t bear the idea of a woman in the profession, and Tony and Rhodey did not own the Stark Forge. Tony didn’t have enough money to buy it back from Obadiah Stane’s dirty hands -that was the reason why he spent his summers wandering from village to village as a tinkerer, while Rhodey accompanied caravans-. And as for Steve…
“Why, I’m a prince of course, so I couldn’t help myself when hearing such a beautiful voice. I thought you had to be some pretty princess in distress.”
“That’s scientifically impossible,” said Tony, and the blond young man glared at him. “Okay, okay, forget it. I’m Tony.”
Mute, Tony watched him step back, feeling strangely abandoned as the exploring fingers left him. Steve brought a chair and sit facing Tony, a blank sheet of paper pinned to the kitchen chopping board in one hand, and a sharpened piece of coal in the other. He smiled to Tony, asked him not to move, and started drawing.
“Sorry, sorry!” said Tony, holding his hands up. “I heard you sing, earlier, and you had the voice of a woman. It was beautiful, really!”
“As if you were a car without fuel, only you had no idea where or how to get your fuel,” added Tony softly.
Most Gorgeous gapes at him for a few seconds, looking taken aback, and then he frowns and straightens up defensively.
His voice had raised, loud, on the verge of a scream. Tony took hold of his head with his two hands and breathed in, deeply, almost-shivers running through his hunched shoulders. Finally, he gasped out, calmer;
No sex. They’re both half-hard, but neither of them want to go there. Steve invites him for breakfast, Tony hesitates a little.
“Yeah, I get you’re full of money, but I don’t want that,” says Steve, in his decisive voice, the one his friends jokingly called the Captain Tone.
It had taken time for Steve to integrate that homosexuality wasn’t something wrong anymore. So, it took him time to make peace with himself and admit that he was bisexual -that being attracted to Tony wasn’t an aberration, nor was it tainting the love he held for Peggy. That all the tension and constant disappointment he had felt around Tony had merely been attraction, sexual frustration, and want for more than friendship.
Steve’s anger fades out, and he watches him, wonders why he’s so wind up and why he’s there anyway, dressed up as if trying to get a warm body for the night and then pushing away anyone that tries asking him out.
Leads fills up Steve’s stomach. Tony looking to be fucked by a man, when he usually sticks to women, and this precisely
Steve kisses the top of his head and his arm tightens its hold around Tony’s waist as he guides him back to bed. They sit together.
Steve knew he was talking about Wanda, but he couldn’t help but wonder if he wasn’t talking about him, too, and maybe even Natasha herself, who had been very affected by Banner’s disappearance.
Steve doesn’t know how long it lasts. It seems like they are suspended in time. He’s breathing quietly, and Tony is humming nonsense, and it’s a melody that Steve knows will haunt his dreams.
Eventually Tony wiped his tears and calmed down enough to be able to hop on his mule. Jan came by, looking sad and worried, but he ignored her. Looking even sadder, the little fairy accepted his silence and simply guided him out of the woods.
After a while, they finally calm down, and Steve stands to get the drawing. He can see how Tony fidgets, how he’s getting nervous. He probably doesn’t want to see the drawing at all. Steve offers it to him, and waits.
He’s left mouth hanging like a fish’s, because just… wow. The famous Janet Van Dyne is chatting with him as if he was a friend, and she’s saying she wants to work with him! He’s probably dreaming. He probably fell asleep in his couch while his friends were watching their Christmas specials, and anytime soon they’re going to wake him up.
“Thanks, honey bee,” purrs Tony. “I’m always a fan of your designs, I’m so lucky you’re there spoiling me.” And then he gently pushes her hands away and turns towards Steve, whose throat is all closed up and can’t breathe. “Fancy meeting you here, darling,” Tony smiles -it’s his fake smile of his, and Steve feels like vomiting-.
“But you did, too,” insisted Steve, and seeing how Tony bristled, he added quickly; “And I’m not saying this to blame you. I’m saying this because I don’t understand your actions, just the same you probably don’t understand mine. And that’s…that’s what I’d like to talk over with you.”
It was love and lust united in a blaze Tony should only give to his future wife, feelings he should only ever give to a woman… Never a man.
“Sir, yes sir,” huffs Tony, and then he moves, kneels on the bed. Steve strips him off the red shirt, takes a moment to admire his bare, strong back, and then pushes him down.
She keeps parading him around, presenting him to so many people he can’t keep on, until she pushes him right into a circle of three persons; he recognizes Ms Potts, looking absolutely splendid in a golden dress that compliment her long, flaming hair set free on her naked shoulders. Next to her is a tall, imposing-looking colonel, his uniform pristine, the decorations shining on his chest, dark soul-searching eyes, high cheekbones and dark skin. The third man has his back to them, and is dressed in a …golden suit, which should look ridiculous but absolutely isn’t, and the suit hugs him in all the right places, and his nape is familiar, his black wavy hair so so familiar, and he turns around and smiles and God it’s Tony Stark, of course it’s Tony Stark.
“Oh, I’ll hunt you down,” he said, “I’ll hunt you down and tie you up like cattle, and then I’ll take you, fuck you in the ass, until all you’ll be able to do is holler like a wolf bitch, you evil beast!”
A tall tower was standing in the middle of the glade, its slate roof shining under the midday sun. The tower had neither stairs nor door, but near the top was a little window. The singing that so deeply touched Tony’s heart came from that window. He dismounted Dummy and let his mules graze in the bushes, while he sat on a rock, examining the tower and trying to spot an entrance.
His hands slipped out from the stockings and ran up his legs to his hips, and he held him up, making him stand on all fours. Tony trembled as he felt human teeth dig into the flesh of his ass. His sex twitched, hardening again.
Steve looked up with an unsteady, unhappy wry laugh. The sky was still all-blue, no clouds in the horizon, and the sun blazing. It was a beautiful and warm day. Sitting on his bench, under the smooth shade of the trees, should have felt peaceful and nice.
There was nothing Steve could say to make this better, and so he forced his guilt away and trailed back to the beginning of their conversation, waiting a little before replying;
“Yeah, you do. You already smelled of horse the over day, but now you smell of pig. No offense,” said Steve, his voice muffled by the sleeve. “I never got why Bambi had her inn so close to the pig pen.”
“Rogers, do you really think we have treated Wanda right? Do you really think that Vision and her would have ended like that if we hadn’t screwed up?”
Tony moans, louder, and starts fucking his face, carefully, but so wantonly that Steve feels himself pushed closer and closer to his own release, and knows that he’s leaking. His hands force Tony’s hips down for a moment, just long enough to free his mouth and rasp;
He glances at Steve’s suit, and Steve finds himself blushing harder. He knows his suit probably looks cheap next to all those expensive clothes.
He could fill in the rest easily without needing to ask him. The guilt, the stress, the break-up with Pepper, the migraine from the use of the BARF machine - all that explained Tony’s aggressive and short-tempered behavior from back then, so different from his usual cocky-upbeat-genius one Steve had grown so fond of-.
The last to arrive are Clint and Bobbi. Clint is Natasha’s best friend, so of course he and his wife Bobbi had been added to Steve and Bucky’s circle. Bobbi is pregnant with their first child, and she looks so tired. Natasha helps her sit while Clint puts his gifts under the Christmas tree.
Alas, sickness hadn’t left the child. As he grew up, he remained small and skinny, fragile and prone to illnesses. When he was but twelve years old, his lungs caught a mortal disease. His parents desperately searched for help everywhere they could: they asked the village doctor, the priest, even the good witch in the light woods. No one could save the child.
For all that Tony loves to boast and talk miles about his inventions, he’s never been one to talk about his deeper feelings. Steve can sense there is so much more Tony is holding back about Afghanistan, can see it in the tension in his shoulders, the slight tremble of his lips, his far-away look, the tap-tap-tap of his fingers against his chest. Steve wishes Tony could confide in him, but he knows this, this conversation they have, is already a gift, that Tony is never that chatty. A few years ago, Steve heard Bruce complain that Tony had talked his ears off about his problems and his disastrous run with the Mandarin. He remembers feeling angry and jealous, wishing that Tony would have chosen to trust him instead, and thinking that he would have treated Tony’s confidences better.
Joseph in the desperation of saving his child consented to everything, and every night he came by the garden to fetch fresh rampion for his child. No matter how hard he tried to remember the path leading to the tower, he never could; it was as if the trees in the woods traitorously walked away and chose different places to root, making it impossible to find the sorcerer’s garden without the help of the fairy.
Jane doesn’t hear. He’s safe. Thor pats his shoulder again, and goes on relating a tale about his college days and his friends, “the Warriors Three and the lady Sif”.
“I’m alright,” said Tony, gently, and he opened his hand to let her sit on his palm. “I just… I was just wondering something, about… about Steve.”
It’s a low blow, he knows, but he doesn’t want to spoil the surprise. Tony sighs, deeply. He looks a little consternated.
“Thank you for explaining this to me. I really did not understand what happened with you back then. Especially during the Accords thing.”
“I’ll come back,” said Tony, and felt his heart constrict when he saw the small, disbelieving smile Steve gave him as an answer.
They take their coats in the cloakroom, they’re out of the bar, and Tony’s arm has let go of Steve’s waist. Steve takes hold of his hand, and their fingers intertwine. Tony’s hand is surprisingly rougher than he’d thought; he probably works with his hands a lot.
Then again, Tony doesn’t know that Steve has taken his drawing just yesterday, and fixed it, so he doesn’t know that the drawing isn’t as scandalously pornographic as it was before.
“Take care of yourself, too,” said Steve, watching him walk away. Tony’s back looked straighter than before. He was a survivor, and even in tatters he would keep going, with that immense strength of will that Steve had admired in him ever since he had seen Iron Man carrying the nuke into that dark, deathly wormhole.
Steve cared for him. He cared for him too much, and that was what had scared him. For a long time, before the war, Steve had thought that his appreciation of the male body was only one of an artist, and maybe, just maybe, envy from a shrimp who wished to be bigger. He didn’t think that it was more, and he never thought himself to be what people disgustedly called ‘a fag’, because he was attracted to women. Then the war came, he became the big and strong Captain America, and thus he had nothing to envy to anyone anymore. By then, he had already fallen in love with Peggy, and was blind to anyone else.
Steve stops in front of his door. The muffled voices of his friends can be heard from there, and he holds his index over his lips, smiling. Tony muffles a snicker, and nods silently. Steve opens quietly the door, and slips in, pulling Tony behind him. From the entrance, they can’t see the living-room, nor can they be seen, and Steve hastily drags Tony down the corridor, leading him into his room and shutting the door behind him.
Yet, for all the love that Spideybear received, he still adored Ironteddy, an old unloved teddy bear. It was nothing short of a surprise, for how such a fulfilling teddy as Spidey could come to have affection for him was unthinkable. Spideybear’s affection was so overwhelming and blazing, Ironteddy felt like his yarn was burned every time they talked. Ironteddy, in turn, felt nothing but love to the little bear who was loving and joyful and was curious about all the things around him, jumping with joy every time he came to Ironteddy’s workshop, texting him a million questions and chasing his bots around in delight. Ironteddy did not think that Spideybear was aware of his feelings, but he would like to think that he did anyway.
And Bucky, who apparently remembered Tony, curled up like a docile Golden Retriever at Tony’s feet and pushed his head comfortably into his petting hand all the while Tony told Steve the story. That evening, when Steve came back to the living room after dinner to see Tony lounging on the sofa with Bucky half-draped on his belly, snuffling quietly with tail thumping slowly to Tony’s long stroke along his flank, he could not think of a more perfect picture. That, right there, was exactly what Steve had always wanted, a family in the making, someone he could share the rest of his life with, together with Bucky, a mesh of past and future.
It was very swell and all, but that also meant that Bucky tolerated no one else in his house and it became a huge problem when Steve resumed dating. The few people that Steve managed to go steady with since his return, Bucky hated them all. Sharon, a lovely lady working for MI6, whom Bucky barked at every single time she visited. Janet, whom Bucky tried to bite when she attempted to pet him. He chased Karen away in tears and left a set of bite mark on Andrew’s shin, which thankfully did not require stitching but had Steve worried over for weeks and pretty much killed any chance of him taking things to the next level. He had the best luck with Natasha, another special ops vet whom both had actually met back in Iraq. Bucky did not try to bite her shin when she came to the house, but still, he growled and scratched at the closed bedroom door through the nights she stayed over (which was no problem for Natasha, but they broke up anyway when she finally admitted to him that she had eyes for someone else, and two months after their break-up she started dating Clint and Laura).
“I believe it is more of a semantic resemblance than just appearance, Man of Iron. Although if I have to say so myself, it is fitting that WALL-E reminds your children of you and lady EVE the Captain.”
Ironteddy almost nodded out of habit, but somehow stopped himself in time. He had not even fully comprehend Obie’s words. Mom? Dad? Gone? What was he talking about?
But then again, Bruce thought to himself, sometimes he’d really really rather not be in the same city as the Fantastic Four.
“Hey, I’m interested in biology as well. Just because I have doctorates in one field doesn’t mean I cannot dapple in other sciences.”
All heads turned to Steve, who was looking both relieved and worried, which was a very odd look on just about any occasion.
Then Obie was carrying him off towards Mr Jarvis, telling him that he would be taking Ironteddy with him. Mr Jarvis only looked at him solemnly for a minute, then he sighed and nodded resignedly.
(then there was that time WALL-E and EVE heard JARVIS reprimanding Dummy for accidentally burning Tony’s coffeemaker and were strongly reminded of AUTO and thus tried to destroy JARVIS by uploading their conscience into the building’s main network. It would end up with them having a nice conversation with JARVIS and at the end of it were all pals again and later the team would laugh, but for a whole nerve-wrecking week everyone was on their toes primed for another Ultron event, which did no good to Bruce’s system at all.)
There they were in the middle of space, a million sparkling stars around yet not a single soul in sight. They had no idea where the ship was taking them or how far away their destination was, how long it would take to get there. There was no need for them to be in control of the ship, so they ended up having plenty of time to spare. Ironteddy and Spideybear spent hours looking through the alien technology like bright-eyed children, amazed by how alien it all was while Strangeteddy meditated quietly. Sometimes, Strangeteddy joined them as they explored the ship, somehow following their rabid discussions with no problem. When Spideybear finally knocked off and went to the living quarters to find a comfy pillow to sleep on, Ironteddy and Strangeteddy would sit in front of the giant glass screen and peered into the deep dark space, discussing everything that came to mind.
He finally did, when Obie tried to blast him into pieces with his own armour. And so Ironteddy, armed with the arc reactor blazing artificial love he created for himself, brought his most beloved human down in flames.
Ironteddy had known about the Accords for a while. Oddly enough, the first legal restriction against teddy bears was one asking them for accountability. If the situation was any less serious than this, Ironteddy would probably find it very funny. Yet, people were killed, buildings were destroyed, countries were ruined and someone had to do something about it. Ironteddy remembered Obie’s words on the podium ages ago on the launch of Ironteddies, praising his toughness and also softness. Ironteddy remembered Mr Stark, how he used to tell him that he would never be enough.
Like all the ones Ironteddy had ever loved, they were gone. Like Mr Stark and Mrs Stark. Like Mr Jarvis and JARVIS. Like Obie. Gone in a blow of dust, disintegrating like a sand castle at the end of the day.
What was less widely known was that Tony, the paranoid man that he was, had implanted a chip on himself, in case the very scenario of kidnapping arose. Which was why Steve and Bucky and a hoard of SHIELD agents were flying to Nevada, a trail of US Air Force lead by Colonel James Rhodes hot on their heels. Bucky was not meant to go, but he planted his feet and growled and snarled and Steve, already half-blinded with fury and fear for Tony, made no effort to stop him.
No, not that Steve was going to leave Tony or Bucky altogether. Just, maybe they could go elsewhere on date night, somewhere that Bucky could not go to. It felt a bit like cheating, but Steve was pretty desperate at this point, and plus it would just be for a night.
“What’s the logic in that?! I look nothing like that rusty pile of junk!” Tony was cut off by an excited beep by WALL-E and a string of offended whirrs from EVE and the bots.
Eventually, more teddies with superpowers showed up. First, the giant Hulkteddy, the alter-ego of a sweet unassuming Bruciebear, who wreaked havoc in Harlem and went on the run. Then there was Thorteddy, the mysterious alien who came from a teddy-ruled universe. Also, apparently the government had been employing teddies as spies all along, like Hawkteddy who was a master archer. Not only America, so did Russia, for there was Widowteddy who could bring down ten grown men all by herself. They were termed superteddies and there were talks of bringing them together as a team.
