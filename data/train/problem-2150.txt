"What time? What time do I need to be there?" Sherlock asked brusquely, glancing at his watch.
I uncovered the tray. There was water, ginger tea, paracetamol tablets and cough syrup. "Where is Dr. Watson?" I asked.
I nodded. I felt queasy, but I needed to get this over with.
Sherlock ducked his head. "It never occurred to me."
watered down. Sometimes one had to bring in a talented mongrel or two to keep the gene pool from becoming too insular.
John: I’m sorry, sweetheart, it’s my job.
“Yeah, I’ve already starting working on it in my head…” Sherlock made a face suddenly, mouth twisting into a grimace, looking slightly disgusted.
John pursed his lips slightly, staring him down for a moment before nodding once. “How dramatic of him,” he replied smoothly.
“It’s just another bill to pay. Besides, Baker Street is better, and you know it.” To be honest, John was a bit offended that Sherlock seemed to think he had no emotional attachment to the house he and Mary had bought together. It was where Rosie had grown up thus far, after all. Then again...Sherlock had very few emotional attachments to anything.
He jacked me off, kissing me all the way through, fingers on my nipple. Not that I lasted long – just having his big hand on my prick was almost enough to get me off.
"No." He looked hard at John. "We don't have to do this, John. I can make our apologies and we can leave."
He stood frozen before me, tall and gaunt in a kimono-style robe, the sash emphasizing how very narrow his waist had become. His head was covered in dark fuzz, an angry red scar visible above his left ear. He looked exhausted. He reached out and his hand trembled.
“But how? The police haven’t found anything.”
By Tuesday, I’d forgotten the appointment with Mycroft. I’d been taking long, rambling walks through the city, trying to leave my pain behind me. Trying to outrun my memories and my regrets. But my traitorous feet took me to places I had been with Sherlock.
As they lay in bed holding each other, John made an effort to shake off the foul mood. Shane didn't deserve any more of John's moaning – especially not after taking care of John so thoroughly.
“Mm. Mary – has she hit on you yet?”
He knew Sherlock felt the same – his vexation and discomfort came through their empathetic link loud and clear. But they had to learn to be apart. They couldn’t live the rest of their lives joined at the hips. (John’s lewd thought at that image did nothing to assuage Sherlock’s discontent.)
“I assure you I am not.” Mycroft said. He gazed at Lestrade for a moment, at the irregular grassy green soulmark on his cheek. Lestrade smiled at him and he coloured and looked down at the bowls of soup on the tray, at the sandwiches. “This looks lovely. Thank you.”
John grunted and with hand and forearm slammed Sherlock back against the couch and followed with a savage kiss. He lifted himself and threw a leg over to straddle Sherlock's lap. He bit Sherlock's upper lip, his tongue pressed against the tender peaks, following their line. His fingers plucked at Sherlock's nipple, circling with his thumb – he had remembered how sensitive they were, how it made Sherlock's back arch and his breath stutter.
“What?” Sherlock asked.
“I will. Thank you.”
As I reflect on how long I have kept this from you, the more selfish I realize I have been. Loving you was not something that I ever expected. I have struggled to come to terms with these feelings and what they mean for me. They are not comfortable feelings – they are distressing – they descended unbidden, unwelcome, and they have made me terribly unhappy.
Cam, on the other hand, narrowed his dead eyes when he saw the three of us on Moran’s doorstep.
“Moran hasn’t been back to his flat. We’re watching it, but looks like he’s gone to ground. John, every copper in the city has his photo. If he’s still in London, we’ll find him.”
Sherlock's phone buzzed – he had a text. He fumbled the phone out of his pocket, but it wasn't from John. Dusette had a plan to break into Moran's home.
“Because John is your special project. Jim gave John to you.” I saw John’s startled glance in my peripheral vision but ignored it.
"Sherlock..." I said, eager to reassure him, convince him that what he desired so much was his. "Sherlock –"
She nodded. “I’m going to examine your feet.” She set her sheaf of papers aside and without ceremony yanked the blankets off John’s lower legs and folded it up over his knees. There was ugly red bruising on his calves and ankles all around the rope burns. John’s feet were still pale and mottled but when she touched them, he wiggled his toes. “Good.” She said. “How does this feel?” She ran a finger up the sole of one foot.
"By that logic, leaving was the best thing I could have done for him."
Sherlock’s medical records detailed the treatment of his many wounds in clinically antiseptic language. I had reviewed them carefully, making sure I was satisfied with every step. Making certain Sherlock was receiving the best care possible.
"I thought you felt better."
John had learned that Sherlock was stubborn. His upbringing had been a strange mix of over-indulgence and deprivation. His family was wealthy and influential, but Sherlock was just the Omega, a commodity along with all the other Holmes assets. His brother had thought enough of his intelligence and ability to educate him, but still thought his role was to bond and breed. Despite the limitations placed on him, the Omega had doggedly walked his own path, disappointing expectations at every turn.
The floor just below street level is the original basement of the house. There’s a root cellar and a wine cellar, the furnace, electric grid and laundry along with an impressive armory that I had raided on more than one occasion.
“That’s not fair, Sherlock. You can’t put this all on me.”
“You can and you will!”
“Still not sure how this all leads to a flat.”
“Why ever not?” Mycroft was losing what little patience he had.
"Where is he? I know you know." Moran flicked again leaving another welt on John's bollocks.
“No, brother. It wasn’t.
There were hands holding me back. “Let me see him. He’s my friend! He’s my friend.”
"I don't want to talk about it." I told him.
I started towards them, fury stilling my mind absolutely, excitement filling my veins.
But after almost two years of suffering, John's joy was tempered, entwined with bitterness and recriminations.
Then I heard the match flare and smelled the acrid cigarette smoke. I made sure my sigh of relief was silent.
I returned to the conservatory. It had started to rain again. With the mist and the ocean, the whole world looked wet and gray.
Sherlock is haunted by the things he has been forced to do.
Shane crab-walked away from Moran and the spreading pool of blood, horrified at himself and Dusette. When his back hit a wall, he wrapped his arms around his knees and sat there shivering. Vaguely he watched Dusette search Moran’s pockets for keys and then systematically try them all on Sherlock’s shackles until she found the right one and freed him. They were talking, but Shane couldn’t hear them over the sound of his beating heart and gasping breaths.
“Medical school is important to me. My mate understands that. And I was hoping that if I put in some extra time, made up for what I lost, I wouldn’t have to put off graduation.”
"Keep going." John called. "I don't want you here."
What sort of man knowingly put his future mate in that situation?
Sherlock swam – he had to get to John! He had to tell John something important!
A classic symptom of lowered body temperature. I shuddered to think what would have happened if we hadn’t gone looking. “You’re safe now. I’ve got you.” I was pressed against his back, sharing my own body heat with him, my head tucked against his shoulder. For once I wasn’t bothered at all that people would think we were a couple. (I HAD taken a detour to my own room for a pair of pants. I didn’t think Sherlock wanted my naked bits pressed against him any more than I did. Although with the revelations of the last 24 hours, I couldn’t even guess what Sherlock wanted!)
Victor peered at me. “But surely…”
"Marry me. I love you – we love each other. Let's get married, John, and grow old together."
Mattered
John.
More thunks, wet and ripe interspersed with words... Thunk! “Did!” Thunk! “This!” Thwup! “To!” Splut! “Him!” Splud. Splush...
But breaking up with her... she was a limpet, impossible to dislodge.
“I’m angry.” John said. I almost laughed – John’s capacity for anger was bottomless. But he didn’t sound angry. He sounded distraught.
“I hate this.”
Sherlock begins to understand what sharing John means.
"We're almost certain this was where our sniper shot from." Lestrade told us. NSY had set up lights in the corridor, but it was obvious that it wasn't normally well-lit. It was spare, dingy and somewhat depressing. We waited there whilst Lestrade shooed his team out of the flat – my heart sank when I saw Ravi was again among them. He winked in my direction and I could feel John tense without turning to look.
The boyfriend left roughly two hours later, but it was after dark before the hunter made a move – he must think John was in for the evening and Sherlock agreed with that assessment. He followed the hunter down Baker Street, away from John.
Sherlock was moaning loudly, one hand in John’s hair, the other fisted in the sheets. Through their empathetic link, John felt his mate’s pleasure and astonishment – no one had ever done this for him before!
Sherlock grimly stood thinking he should feign weakness – only to find himself clutched awkwardly in Shane’s arms, the wheelchair still between them. “Dizzy,” He mumbled, trying to push himself upright using Shane’s chest.
(See the end of the chapter for
"May I join you?" I asked.
Sherlock is acting strangely. More strangely than usual, I mean. Strange for Sherlock.
“Sherlock…!” John started to protest.
“You have a boyfriend?” Moran asked, a touch of frost returning to his eyes.
Sherlock had thought about that late into the night. What did it mean? John had chosen Shane... did he expect that they would go back to being friends, living and working together as before?
“Ah yes.” Mycroft did not look ready to forgive the oversight, but he tucked the emotion away. “You were ambitious.”
Rooming with the smuggler was a stroke of luck. I could work with this.
"Maybe he was on to something." The doctor said. "Maybe he was targeted."
Shane nodded at the lift buttons. “Where are we going?” He asked.
I kissed him. He was pliant under my touch. Once again I laid him down on the futon, stretching out next to him, kissing him, caressing him. I felt his hardness beneath my hand.
I shrugged. "I was younger than you. And my brother is a very dangerous man – I knew he could hurt Victor, he could disappear Victor if he wanted to. I promised not to see Victor again as long as Mycroft left him alone." I took another step towards the boy. "Maybe I should've let Mycroft deal with him. Maybe you wouldn't be pointing a gun at me if I had. But I loved him too much to let Mycroft have his way." I took another step. "But no one can keep Victor out of prison this time. Your sister already called the police, they're on their way. Now Victor has a... a pattern of seducing under aged teens – I know he didn't seduce you, he didn't have to seduce you. He didn't have to seduce ME either. But the police won't see it that way."
"No! It's just... Sherlock doesn't... Sherlock didn't... " What was I going to say? Sherlock doesn't have sex? Obviously he does – or did, at least. "...mention you."
John felt the slightest hint of desire touch his groin. It was painful – psychically, to be sure, but physically as well. The memory of the torture he'd endured and what that meant for him now was a bitter, bitter taste in his mouth. He dropped his hand to the bed.
For the first time since his abduction, John felt his cock take notice – not become erect, not yet, but to raise its hand and say 'present!' It felt like it had been years since that happened. He leaned into the kiss, enjoying the sensations of being aroused. Enjoying Shane.
Eventually he started to stand straighter so I let him go.
“How was Dublin?”
They had curry and cocktails, then more cocktails.
"No one knows we're looking for a murderer – just the three of us and your friend Angus." Sherlock said. "We've kept it quiet."
*Mariah- I love your lips when they’re wet with wine / And red with a wild desire; / I love your eyes when the lovelight lies /Lit with a passionate fire. J*
"Incredibly." I said.
"Oh John... sweet, John. You loved him, of course you're upset." Shane soothed.
“Mm.” Moriarty had given Mycroft a very different impression to gain his favour when he wanted to bond with Sherlock. That he could hide his nature so thoroughly from his astute brother was frightening – Mycroft was possibly even better at reading people than Sherlock, no one had secrets from Mycroft. It chilled him to the bone.
“Yeah.” Lestrade agreed. “He’ll take it hard when John starts looking for a step-mum for Rosie.”
"I had a headache earlier, but not now. My skin... my skin hurts. And I'm exhausted by the smallest exertion."
"I know..." Sherlock started slowly. "I know you give John things that I can't. Things that he needs. I'm... very grateful... that he has you."
Angus!
I scoffed at myself. I'd been SO careful since John moved in to NEVER be naked outside the bath – with the door firmly closed and locked. It was instinctive, hiding the piercings from him. He'd felt no compunction about being shirtless in front of me – I'd memorized his sinewy shoulders, his taut chest with the thatch of ginger fur between his pectorals, the sweet softness of his abdomen, ginger around his navel, trailing under his waistband... I'd wanted to trace that scar with my lips, memorize it, rub my face against his fur, follow it down...
"We're together." Sherlock said. "We're really together."
"What do we do?" Shane had been with John overnight and looked like he'd barely slept himself.
"Where's yours?" John asked.
"But you don't like... "
“Like this.” He said with a knowing smile. He held his legs up for me. “I won’t break.”
“No! Jesus, John, give me your cock! Fuck me!”
“Yeah, send someone…”
Lestrade was far from confident that left alone, Sherlock wouldn’t pick the lock and unbuckle the ball gag, allow John to infect him with whatever this was.
“Mycroft?”
“What ‘thing?’”
“Conclusions?”
“Yes, send him in, please.” Mycroft said then returned to his phone call. “Angela, I have to go. Ja. Ok... ok... Auf wiedersehen. John. Come in. Sit.”
"John is... John is wonderful. He's the bravest and strongest person I've ever met. He makes me better - better at my work, better at life, and just... better." Walter's probing aside, I found that I liked talking about John. "We were friends first - we got on right away. We... we laughed together. I'd always been alone, always expected to be, but suddenly there was this person I could depend on. He was there when I needed him... always ... It was intoxicating." I smiled to myself caught up in the memories. "I tried not to fall in love with him. I thought it would be hopeless - he always maintained that he was straight. And I'd always kept my private life very separate. But I've never known anyone like him. I didn't want to love him, but I did. Of course I did. When he found out how I felt... I hoped he could set it aside and continue our friendship... I never dreamed..."
"No." He said.
John laughed out loud. "You're bloody insane."
“It was. I wanted you to stay. I wanted to hold you while we slept. I wanted to wake up next to you. I want that every night.”
Vinokourov stared at me for some other reason. After the first round of rapes, I’d been beaten and tortured – Vino had questions he wanted me to answer. I had deleted the suffering I’d endured, remembering only the cold facts. I had told him everything of course, but I’d held out, I made him work for it. Then I wove wild stories of hidden adversaries, men bent on vengeance, of the inevitable downfall of his empire in amongst the truth. I’d talked enough that he didn’t know what was real and what was fiction.
“We got photos – good enough to frame and hang over the mantle.” His phone buzzed and Lestrade looked at it, his brow furrowing.
John nodded once. “Good.” He said, licking his lips. “That’s good.”
John roused himself. "To get going? No. The more we do it, the easier it should get."
“John...” It was all I could manage as I burrowed my face into his chest and clung to him, all the fear and guilt and hurt of the past two weeks – of the past fourteen months! – came gushing out of me through torturous sobs. John held me, his arms and legs around me, his face pressed to my head, and shushed soothingly, a cool balm on the white hot inferno of my shame.
Lestrade told himself he was glad — it had held him back. He deserved a real relationship...
“No.” She looked small and lost. “It’s two months now. Something terrible must have happened to him.”
Lestrade wrapped his arms around his soulmate. “I’ll tell you a secret: I can’t wait for the Queen to see your soulmark.”
Sherlock joined me in the living room as I turned on the news, jammy toast and mug of tea on the coffee table for him next to my fried breakfast. True to form, Sherlock speared a spoonful of egg and beans off my plate immediately.
“Tell them he’s your brother and he’s off his meds. Trust me, that will get their attention.”
“Hey.” I said, putting my arms around him, trying to comfort him. “We’ll stop him. We’re in this together, remember.”
He ate his soup and drank the sweetened ginger tea, and he actually smiled at the little stack of jaffa cakes. Then he lay back down. "Thank you, John." He said.
"Yes, I agree. Yes!"
"Mm, sometime later. You know.. I liked Irene, she wanted a...physical relationship. I considered it, but I couldn't...I couldn't picture myself with her like that. I can't claim to be asexual, I had – have – sexual desires. I just banished them long ago when they started getting in the way of my studies, my work. I thought not wanting her, it was... confirmation... that I was meant to be celibate.
“I love your reasoning there,” he remarked, his grin widening as Sherlock crossed the room, shifting Rosie to his hip before leaning down to press a kiss to his lips.
Great was running into Mike and finding Sherlock all of those years ago.
There was another tense moment of silence between them, like a staring contest neither of them wanted to lose. John let out a soft sigh after Sherlock broke, tilting his head down to glance at his water before taking his other unsteady hand and attempting to unscrew the cap off. John kept his mouth shut, resisting the urge to yank it from his hands and open it himself.
“You need to sleep, Sherlock...that case took a lot out of you…” Sherlock hummed in response, bringing his knees up slightly before leaning over and resting his forehead against them, closing his eyes. John reached over and gently ran his fingers through his hair, fingernails scratching his scalp gently and he heard Sherlock sigh in content, his arched back rising and falling slowly.
“I’ve never been able to admit to myself that I loved anyone. I didn’t understand it! I Well, I understand the chemical imbalance in the brain, it’s all science and numbers and that makes perfect sense to me but what doesn’t it experiencing it! And I realized that…” He waved his hand wildly above his chest for a moment, looking flustered. “I realized the warm feeling in my chest I get everytime I see you is because of that. It’s because I love you, and I’m in love with you, and I don’t believe I’m ever going to stop loving you.”
He had scanned the contents of the fridge for a couple seconds before Sherlock’s music suddenly stopped. He looked over his shoulder, frowning slightly, and heard the slow creak of the guest bedroom door open. Sherlock’s heavy footsteps padded down the hall, and then suddenly he was in the kitchen doorway, staring at John rather blankly.
The noise only got louder – there was shouting, commotion. It took so much energy, but Sherlock opened his eyes and looked up. He saw Lestrade, tan trench coat flying, fighting with two Alphas. Lestrade had blood all over his face.
We left not long after that, separating in the Underground with a quick hug to take different trains home – but not before I saw the compact form of Staelich trailing after Mary.
That got her attention. She narrowed her eyes skeptically, but didn't dismiss the idea. "What makes you think that?"
I was consumed by the intense feelings – of Sherlock’s hole clenched around my prick, the stimulation from sliding in and out, the emotion of being inside my friend, my best friend, the person I loved most in this world. And now I knew him even more intimately. My hands found his shoulders and I fucked him soundly, pulling him back onto my fat cock.
“Ah, for his money!”
“What was he like? Marcas?”
“Right, every kid learns that in primary school.”
“Yes, thank you.” I accepted the mug gratefully and spooned in the sugar. “I want to take a look at the trail Sir Afan was on when he had his accident.” I told her. “I understand it starts quite near the house?”
“How do you know that?” Lestrade asked.
“It’s fine.” John said. “Though I don’t recommend it.”
"If you delete it, you better delete ME at the same time." John stated baldly. "Your regret is what redeems you."
"John..." Shane said tenderly. He sat on the bed facing John.
By puberty, all the young Omegas had been separated from the other kids. John remembered Harry’s epic fits of temper at being made to stay at home. Her friends still went to school and to the cinema and to football. But not Harry. Harry stayed home. It was for her safety their mum had explained. Harry’s heats could start, and she had to be kept away from Alphas. Alphas would take advantage of Harry, she told them. Even John had been treated like he was a danger to her.
John was very tempted. He felt GOOD right now, better than he had in fifteen months, maybe more. He wanted to hold onto that feeling.
“My Jim liked this particularly.” Moran said. “He often orgasmed twice. I’m not sure you will, though.” Moran stopped whipping suddenly and John slammed back to full awareness of his gasping, sniveling body – just in time to feel Moran’s hand grab him roughly and start stroking again.
“How’ve you been, Mr. Sholto? I heard you got married.”
?” He asked when he’d gained the deck. “You said you’d never had sex before we bonded.” His own emotions crowded the empathetic link making it impossible for John to know what his Omega was feeling.
She was a tall woman, statuesque, with her younger son’s dramatic colouring paired with Mycroft’s sharper features. At 63, she was still handsome, her dark hair threaded majestically with silver that matched her pinstriped pantsuit perfectly.
"Oh..."
“What’s funny?” Sherlock asked, flopping down next to me and starting to spoon sugar into his tea.
Suddenly he was nauseated – he barely had time to turn onto his side before vomiting. He knew it had been a mistake to have coffee this morning.
to go get him!”
John,
“You want it or not?”
Where was he? He needed to take stock. He needed to get to John!
Sherlock’s heat was approaching, his first since bonding with John. For the first time ever he wasn’t annoyed, wasn’t feeling itchy and ill, wasn’t filled with dread. John was here. His steady presence and his strong Alpha pheromones made Sherlock feel almost anticipatory.
Shane laughed out loud. "He's incredibly selfish!" His laughter died and he touched John's face gently. "Maybe that's why you SHOULD keep me around – to have something of your own, something that has nothing to do with him."
He would be the selfish, self-centered prick that John had been talking about.
Victor looked out the windows at the rain. “It never seemed right. Afan was fit, he was experienced. He knew the trail. There was no reason for him to fall… but sometimes there isn’t a reason.”
“Why do you stare at the guns, John?” Cam asked. I hated the sound of my name in his emotionless voice.
But John was coming back changed. Losing his hand had shaken his self-confidence – he no longer knew what he was capable of. He no longer knew himself.
John looked up. A young man stood nearby, trembling, ready to run. He looked older than most of the Omegas John had seen thus far, maybe eighteen or nineteen. He was breathtakingly beautiful, his tousled raven hair and pale skin reminding John achingly of Sherlock.
"That bad?" Shane asked. "Are you ok?"
But, knowing Sherlock hadn’t died, I was more functional. After that hour with Sherlock, I was able pull myself together and find a job. I stayed in the Baker Street flat – it was no longer oppressive to be there, I liked being surrounded by his things. I liked knowing that eventually he would come home. Between my paycheck, army pension and Sherlock’s annuity, I had no problem affording it.
“Ah, I can see she has!” Sherlock crowed licking the last bit of strudel from his fingers. “Good. That’s good.”
Shane did touch him now, comfortingly. He sat (in Sherlock's chair). "John? John, are you all right?"
"No." I poured myself another cup of coffee and sat opposite her.
“John Watson?” A familiar voice rang out.
“Mm. What time is it?”
John took a deep breath and stepped out to face her, dancing on his toes a little. John knew how to fight. He'd grown up in a rough neighborhood and as a short boy, had had to fend off bullies from an early age. By the time he presented when he was thirteen, he was well-versed in street fighting – it served him well in the inevitable fistfights that broke out amongst hormonal, young Alphas. He had earned a place near the top of the unofficial Alpha pecking order at his school.
I was sitting on one of the legless chairs, stretching my own legs under the low table and out the other side. I had put Puccini on the record player in the corner, I didn’t have my violin – hadn’t in over a year – so I was settling for listening to opera. I wished I couldn’t understand the Italian, it would have been more enjoyable...
“As soon as you’re completely recovered, we’ll go back to hating each other.” Shane said.
“Oh right.” Victor said.
“Oh!” That seemed to surprise her – she looked wary for a second. Then she smiled again and poked my arm. “That’s private, John Watson.” She said.
"Erm..." John didn't know how to reply.
“Yeah. Too much.”
"And then there's rehab - where does substance abuse fit into doing everything you can to save John?"
“How do you feel about the violin?” Sherlock asked.
I sighed. “This is all so different... it’s strange to feel this way about my best friend. Strange and wonderful.” I leaned back into his arms and pulled his face to mine. The kiss was slow, languid. I felt Sherlock’s long fingers caressing my cheek, my hair, my thigh.
He watched conflicting emotions cross Shane's face - he was hurt, that was clear, but there was also humor, self-depreciation and other more complicated feelings. "I'm not going to lie and say I'm happy about this." Shane said. "But it's not fatal. I've never been a stickler for monogamy. I generally prefer that we come to an agreement about it beforehand - but I did tell you to do it." He smiled wryly.
There was no such surge that late morning. He walked silently from the coach, his long legs carrying him much faster than I, up the stairs to our rooms without a word. I stopped only to great Mrs. Hudson before following, to find him sat in his armchair, his limbs tangled up around him like twisted branches. The pipe was already between his lips, and I could not summon forth the will to complain.
“You intend to trespass?” I asked.
“John,” he corrected, “I apologize, I had to-“
The young man began to run as I battled through the crowd towards him. His hat tumbled off of his head in his haste, and I nearly trampled it as I gave chase. He did not appear to know the area, although luck seemed to be on his side. The docks were full of dead ends and alleys that cut to the Channel, so it was a wonder that he managed to elude me for as long as he did. His legs were long and he moved quickly, but having been acquainted with Holmes as long as I had, I had developed quite the endurance.
“What business would a man such as he have anywhere?” Holmes mused. “If not Whitechapel, then somewhere with more people, who care to spy into the matters of others more. There, he knew that no one would look at the room once the door was closed.”
We were led through the maze of the house towards Malcolm’s study. It was full of empty rooms, decorated beautifully with expensive furniture, but every inch of it looked untouched, as though no one lived in the house at all.
The choices of the members of British Parliament most commonly lined the pockets of its members, thus I was not overcome by shock at the sight of the Malcolm home. There was a shortage of land available for burial, and yet the building spanned an entire city block. We chose to walk, given the short distance between our home and his, and talked quietly and quickly about the body. We came upon the Malcolm home not twenty minutes after we began to walk. I felt for a moment that my shoes were too dirty to walk across the fine stones leading to the front door.
“-should the court even find his death suspicious, they will hardly believe the murder of a man such as he to be a loss on society.”
“Holmes,” said I, breaking the silence that had overtaken us. He stared still, the light dancing in his cold eyes. “Sherlock,” said I. Upon the use of his given name, a word reserved for the most intimate moments, his attention shifted though his eyes did not. He hummed gently in the back of his throat and pawed for his tea, giving it an unenthused sip. “What did you see?” He sighed. It was not a question that he cared to answer at the moment, but it was the only question.
“I have two sons,” Malcolm replied. “George and Percival.”
Perhaps it was the way in which I sagged with relief that spurred Lestrade from his position by the door. He fiddled with his hat, casting his eyes on the two of us, Holmes prone on his bed, I bent carefully over him, tending to him with gentle touch. He looked as though he were struggling to say something rather important as I dabbed away the blood from his skin with the warm water that Mrs. Hudson had brought up. Finally, twisting his cap in his hands, he spoke.
The problems of the dead were not few in London. It was a subject of which I was particularly passionate, given my constant acquaintance with the dead. London’s population was burgeoning from it’s borders and growing still, and when it’s citizens expired, the coveted land not taken by the living was fought over by the dead. The rich were relatively safe within their familial vaults, but those without sufficient pay were often laid to rest in unsavory fashion. Coffins were stacked atop each other in twenty foot holes, the top most mere inches from the surface. Bodies were distrubed and moved frequently for the newly dead. I had heard stories of chopping bodies to fit within the standard grave, heads and feet packed into the spare room between legs and under arms.
Let it be said that little of what Holmes and I did at that point was chaste. This kiss, however, was not intended to bring heat out of me. It was not meant to rile me up or pull his name from my lips as his clever kisses so easily did. This was comfort, meant only to reassure me that he was there through my cold and my despair. I had to believe that he would always be there. The way his eyes held mine would not allow a different conclusion.
If this story were to ever see publication, I would not dream of interrupting such a dire moment with muses upon my lover’s beauty. Since this will only be read by the two of us, however, I will relish the opportunity to write in graceful prose his elegance, since my spoken words always seem to lack the smooth cadence of my written.
“I do not claim to understand your strangeness, Doctor,” he spoke in a great pile of words all tumbling together, “but I do know…” he seemed to grapple with his next phrase for a moment as I stopped my work to meet his eye. “I do know that you are a good man. I have a duty to my law but… I believe I have a higher duty to good men such as you. Such as Holmes.”
The steady rustle of my hair by his breathing remains to this day, the only thing that can lull me to rest even in the most dangerous of storms.
It was clear that, though he had only risen when I did, Holmes’ mind had been awake far earlier than mine. His sharp features always had about them a sense of contemplation, a constant attempt to categorize his surroundings completely. At times like this, though, when he had an interesting problem to toy with, there was an intensity in his eyes, once again grey.
The blow to his temple was the last, the killing one that ruptured his skull in such a way that much of the matter encased therein was missing. He had sustained many injuries before that, blows to the torso, arms, and legs, breaking bones and leaving bruises that caused pain until the last. If my heart had not swelled in its chamber for this young man before, it did then, the pounding of it deserparete in my ears. I abandoned my duties then, inquiring with Mrs. Hudson about food. It seemed the only thing to do.
“Good God,” Lestrade breathed.
“We have not come to speak on politics,” Holmes said. “We have news of your son, Charles.”
A moment was long enough for Sherlock Holmes to communicate many things. His eyes were clear, and in them was that feral instinct that washed over him in moments of chase. And in his eyes was caution, an urge for me to stay back. I did not know at the time, but there was very little to implicate Malcolm himself in his son’s murder. Holmes’s plan was foolish if not effective, like many of his plans are. He was a reputable witness, and should Malcolm strike out against him when confronted with his son’s murder, then he would admit guilt through his actions.
“John!”
In a breath, my gun was away and I was knelt at my Sherlock’s side. He was bleeding heavily from a deep cut on his temple, and there was no way for me to know in that dark study if his skull had fractured. His eyes lolled in the back of his head, lost somewhere in the space between unconsciousness and wake. By Lestrade’s good graces and the fact that he had thought to bring an extra carriage, myself and my patient were exhumed to Baker Street post haste, his blood staining the floors in that empty house.
“It was his brother.” Said he, gingerly examining the signet ring laid beside his clothing.
“I’m fine,” He coughed, spitting as he scowled around the putrid taste in his mouth. “I apologize, Watson. I’m afraid our conversation left me quite ill.”
“Oh?” Holmes replied innocently. “How so?” A baiting move, hoping to draw an attack.
“It was the year they repealed the death penalty for sodomy.”
“Ah, I see what you mean.” Said he. “Not at all. I am simply opposed to capital punishment in all forms.” The strike was parried, but only just.
“What did he mean,” I asked as the sun began to dip below the buildings. I drew the curtains one by one, “when he said that 1861 was the beginning of the end.” Holmes did not look up from his reading as he answered.
Ernest Malcolm was a prolific member of the parliament of Great Britain. His influences leaned towards the conservative, against the women's vote, against aid for the poor. I would state my opinion on the matter of his morals, however, I am afraid my answer would be smeared with bias. I have a particular distaste for politicians as a whole. Trade and barter are, of course, natural components to human communication. I simply do not approve of it when the compromise is made at the cost of human life.
“I don’t believe so.” With this statement he returned to the body, observing his head carefully in a way unlike he usual investigation. He gazed upon the boy’s body silently, his long fingers hovering but an inch above his golden hair.
“The beginning of the end, if you ask me.” The twist in Malcolm’s voice felt vile in my ears.
He was quiet for a long moment, laid prone in his bed. I sighed, my frustration leaking out of me very slowly.
I was surprised to see, upon arriving at the crime scene, that this was not another well dressed man abandoned in poor conditions. Officer’s of Lestrade’s police were holding back the crowd this time, forming a sort of barricade between the body and the people. Holmes moved like a dog on a scent, immediately stooping over the young man. The body looked, for all the world, to be a dock worker. His hands were calloused and dirty, his boots were hardly made for this sort of weather and I could clearly see where the soles had been repaired time and time again. His clothes were sparse and ill-fitting for the winter. Such a slight lad, he must have been cold.
“The law was created to protect even men like him. He may have been a criminal in his own right, but to kill any man, even a killer himself, is a crime.” Holmes spoke low and steady. He was not muddled by anger like Malcolm was. He was focused, the emotion that would surely choke out his voice in any other moment tucked away somewhere. I could not understand this, how he was able to remove his heart so totally from his mind in the times where it should be the most difficult. That was not one of my gifts, but one of his many.
"Dungeon? No."
“No? Thought you’d have a file on me ten centimetres thick.” Lestrade chuckled.
“Ah. Yes.”
It was more tempting than I like to admit. Getting high would have made the whole ordeal almost tolerable. Drugs would blot out my nightmares and dull the aching boredom. I’d bought drugs on my knees before, back when I was using so much I’d run through my annuity before months end. I wasn’t proud of it, nor was I especially ashamed. It just was.
Were I him, I would have followed and tried to take advantage of my breathlessness. But I was lucky, he took a moment to check his mouth and bend a tooth back into place, swearing imaginatively.
“Rest assured that we are. I’ve been in constant contact with the PM and the Chief of the Defence Staff.”
"Good." Sherlock said. "That's... good."
“That ship has sailed.”
“Best estimate is forty hours.”
I made some sort of noise. I didn't care in the least about the food. But John took it as affirmation. Five minutes later, I was propped up and sipping hearty barley broth from a mug.
“Sherlock...”
This was it. They were going to rape me. They would beat me and then take turns violating me. They might invite their friends to join in ...
"I'm... I'm not really clear on all the details. He really doesn't talk about it." Shane told Mike.
He had tried again to stand up, to call for help, to fight the burly nurse... but the ocean had welled up and taken him into its vast, salty darkness...
“Stop being so dramatic!” Mummy retorted. “Mycroft went to a lot of trouble for this! A lot of trouble!”
Mycroft’s breath caught, and red bloomed on his cheeks. Lestrade noticed that Mycroft was liberally freckled. It was adorable. “Won’t you be with your daughter tomorrow?”
But he never did. Occasionally I saw a man look at him in that special way – the tinyiest bit intense, the tinyiest bit too long. John never noticed, never returned the look. Once I followed him into a public bog known for cruising… he paused when he saw a young man jacking off another man at the urinals, then mentally shrugged and quickly did his business far from the exposed pair. John has never shown himself to be heteroflexible.
The link made their love-making incredibly intense, Sherlock’s greedy lust inciting John, the way his Omega leaned into the edge of pain, making him harder and hotter, making him want to thrust ruthlessly.
Shane stood up. "I've heard a lot about you." He said.
“Your friends are looking for you...” Moran said. “…in the playroom.” Sherlock turned his head in time to see Moran pick up the handgun, inspect it, and tuck it back into his waistband. “Let’s not disappoint them.” He tossed Sherlock’s jumper at him and stood up.
"Good. Get on top again.”
Mariah: Did they sack you when you told them you were going to Wales for a week?!
She looked at him astutely. “You’re one of my best students.” She said.
"Well... I could argue in favour of cocaine... but certainly not heroin."
“Really? Nothing?”
But their sex WAS amazing – it was hard to believe Sherlock was a novice, he'd barely gagged at all. John had had girlfriends who took a look at his big piece and refused to give him oral, and he couldn't blame them. He wouldn't want to stretch his mouth around it. Even Shane, an experienced and enthusiastic cocksucker couldn't take it all. Sherlock had, seemingly by force of will. And when he had said he WANTED it rough, John could have cum right then. Sherlock seemed determined to give John sensations he'd never experienced before.
I heard John expel a breath. He seemed angry for some reason. He certainly couldn’t begrudge my tailor.
"Stop…" John managed. "Wait."
“Is that what you’re going to eat?” Sherlock asked. “Why don’t you make the thing with the peas? Or the thing with the sauce?”
Shane climbed in after him. He hastily shed his cardigan and tucked it under John's head then he picked up John's hand and kissed it. "I'll come to hospital as soon as I can." He said.
“What are we going to do?” John asked.
Sherlock nodded and watched Shane go back in with John. Angus Church was by the nurse's station with his coat on. He saw Sherlock loitering and came over.
“All right! Fine. She’s in on it. And I’m an idiot.”
"Ianto?" I hoped I remembered his name correctly.
I’d been told often enough that I was a terrible actor, that I couldn’t possibly hope to convince anyone that water was wet, let alone fool a villain. But I didn’t think I was in danger of being called out by Moran – I strongly suspected he was as uninterested in me as I was in him. Had I not found an excuse to cut the date short, I was confident he would have.
Shane arrived at half seven with fresh bagels, coffee, John's laptop and a brand new iPhone that he unwrapped and presented to John.
"Frittata." He shrugged. "It's better when it's fresh. I used all the eggs."
Sherlock didn’t bother telling him how he knew – the vomit was the giveaway. It was tea and toast from the look of it, with a hefty amount of mucous, halfway dried and sticking to the sling. And, unfortunately, to John.
Neither of them noticed the man in the dark green coat watching John.
“Mr. Holmes! Thank you for coming!” Lady Anwen met us at the front doors.
“Oh. Some true crime stuff. Things like that.”
"Better."
John received a text alert and pulled his phone from his pocket. "I have to go out again." He announced. From where I was, I could see it was another text from Mariah. My heart sank.
"Go away." John said.
John bristled. “I don’t need anyone to take care of me.”
a good bondmate and a happy life.”
THE CASE OF THE MISSING DETECTIVE or A CASE OF MISSING THE DETECTIVE
I couldn’t bear his concern!
John smirked.
"Yes, why?"
As John well knew, there were people who believed that Sherlock had faked his death. They wrote into the blog regularly – he had had to turn the comments off, they inspired so much fury and then, inevitably, a deeper sink into depression. Sherlock was dead. John had seen him jump, he'd seen his corpse. He'd touched his corpse. Sherlock was dead. This article would inspire a whole new round of conspiracy theories.
"Can you get her chart?" Sherlock asked. "I need to see it."
As he dragged me along, I saw how John was navigating through the maze – his torchlight picking out the fronds laying on the ground. He had been here before!
John lay still, his arms around me. “Cocksucking IS the one thing completely new to me. You know, usually I like a challenge... I let myself be daunted... intimidated... it’s ridiculous, really.” John smiled coyly. “If you’re willing... I can practice everyday.”
Sherlock kept his eyes shut for a moment because, yes, he was a child. John watched his rapid breathing slow back down for a few moments before he finally opened his eyes, staring back at him with a void look of guilt. John kept a grip on his hands, and this time Sherlock didn’t try and fight it.
"I'd tell him to go to hell." Then John had sighed. "I don't know what I'd do."
John smiled his relief and pulled the younger man closer, enjoying the way Sherlock melted into his arms. The Omega pressed his nose against John’s neck, inhaling his scent deeply. “Good.” He sighed.
So far, so easy. Ridiculously easy. But inside the maze-like prison were a multitude of dangers – we had to find the block that the terrorist gang used quickly with a minimum of disruption. The last thing we wanted was a firefight with the guards. I followed the other soldiers, my gun at the ready, as we ran through dank, stinking passages. There were people everywhere – prisoners, waking loudly, mostly hanging back with canny wariness. A fair few followed motivated by curiosity and the chance this strange invasion might prove serendipitous. It made our rear guard nervous, arguably it trapped us, but it also put a barrier between us and prison guards with weapons.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He longed for John. The crime scene had been a momentary distraction, but now the cranky-itchy-lonely feeling was back. He looked sideways at the policeman and noticed him wince. “Headache, Lestrade?” Sherlock asked pointedly.
This was ridiculous. John wasn't a child, he knew how to behave in public. He had to pull himself together. He asked Mike about his work at the teaching hospital. He could hear the relief in Mike's voice as he answered.
"Yeah." Shane agreed.
belittle other people, didn’t form packs to harass Betas. Whose knee jerk reaction to anything wasn't to claim to have done better, gone faster, achieved higher. To strike out. Alphas who didn’t tear down other people to feel better about themselves. Alphas who were calm and centered.
"I ...erm, I don't feel well." Sherlock said rapidly. "I have to go... Ok."
Where to start? “Erm, what do you want to know?”
“Start from the beginning.” John urged her. “When did you realise she was missing.”
“But it didn’t.”
John and Sherlock have a terrible fight.
Of course, if he were there to tell me that, I wouldn’t be flying into Kazakstan.
Dismissed, Lestrade returned to his spartan bedroom. Deciding he had time to fulfil his own greatest wish, he grabbed a set of the clothes folded on top of the bureau in his room and took himself off to the shower.
“I know.” Sherlock said haughtily, but John felt the Omega’s affection and sleepy satisfaction through the link. Carefully he guided them until they lay on their sides, Alpha spooning Omega whilst the knot bound them together.
He set them carefully on the highboy and flopped down on his bed. All he’d done for two weeks was lie in bed and the first thing he did on coming home was lie down. Pathetic.
I slowed my hand but didn't let go. "Let me do this for you." I said, caressing him. "You feel so good in my hand." He did. And I felt desperate to please him, mitigate his disappointment with me…
I nodded, carefully keeping my irritation private. He left! He hadn't left me behind without a word in ages. I walked out into the cold night alone feeling extremely put out. I'd have to get a cab...
Now she looked convinced that I was a ghoul. I didn’t care. “It'll be one of the overlooks. Maybe five or six K from the house.” She opened a cabinet and pulled out a bag. “I made Welsh cakes.” She announced gesturing at the cooling pastries on the stovetop. She deposited several in to the bag and held it out to me. “Take ‘em.”
As he fastened his trousers, Sherlock’s stomach began to churn again, threatening to expel whatever was left – or nothing, just heave vainly in protest – and his head was beginning to ache abominably. It’s just a hangover, he told himself, completely normal the morning after a drugs overdose. On top of a concussion.
"Shh!" John shushed him. "He's still on the ward."
Sherlock brusquely put the Beta to work cleaning out test tubes and petrie dishes and went to pack something he called his ‘sock index.’
"Yeah - get your shoes and the rest of your kit, you're leaving."
“Well, come on back, kettle's just boiled. I’ll make us some tea.”
I took the opportunity to prowl through the small warren of servant's rooms – the largest was a small guest room with a double bed, chest of drawers, lamp and television. The bed was rumpled and room smelled of air freshener. I wondered if the cleaners skipped this room – the rest of the house was pristine.
Two techs came and displaced the bondmates next to the girl’s body. Sherlock stood and turned slowly in a circle, surveying the area. It was a vast wasteland bordered on one side by the Thames and distant warehouses and Victorian era tenements on the others.
Now John scoffed at Sherlock. "Just because you're besotted, doesn't mean I'm any great prize."
I wanted to demand when – WHEN – would I be given morphine, but it was obvious from the knot of his tie that it would get me nowhere.
I stared at him. “No. Mycroft, it isn’t.”
John went back and knelt in front of Molly Hooper. “Molly?” John asked. “How are you feeling?”
Mycroft paused briefly, composing himself. “You always have to stir the pot, don’t you Sherlock.”
“If you wanted excitement, you should have bonded with Moriarty.” Mycroft laughed nastily at his brother’s shocked expression. He was angrier than Sherlock had realised.
“Gentlemen.” Mycroft said.
Alone in the flat, Sherlock approached the corpse, keeping his face turned away. I stood back, taking in the room. The window wall must be stunning in the daytime. I went to it and pressed myself against the glass, trying to see the view. I looked out over the city – I could make out the Tate Modern with the Thames beyond, several other high rises amongst the lower, older buildings dense on the ground.
"No. I'm... I'm bisexual, I guess. I was seeing women exclusively when I lived with Sherlock... after a while... I thought there could be more between us. But there wasn't. Then he left – died, I thought – and I met Shane."
I really WAS put out about Ravi Vaachaspati, that miserable twat. I couldn’t blame him for fucking Sherlock nor for wanting to fuck him again – I wouldn’t blame anyone for that. No, Officer Vaachaspati’s sin was much greater: he’d caught Sherlock’s attention, however briefly, and that tasted like bile in my mouth.
The sound was deafening and Sherlock was completely disoriented, blackness closing around him.
It was warmer in the station. The Baker Street station connected to five different lines... I could go anywhere quickly, if I had anywhere to go.
“They must have grabbed you then. Put us both in here.”
But it felt
One of John's beautiful hands... he'd lost it... it was Sherlock's fault...
“Because you need taking care of.” I kissed him, tasting fried potato.
That's when John realized how unfair he was being to Shane, how selfish. Having him was a comfort and a distraction. But he pined for Sherlock. He was ashamed of himself for using Shane like this and that made him angrier with Sherlock. All of this was Sherlock's fault. How could he leave John thinking him dead and buried for TWO YEARS!?
I guessed it made a certain amount of sense. Vaachaspati was broad and strong like Victor Trevor, dark skinned and handsome... Sherlock had a 'type,' I guessed.
Jammy = Jam Roll - Control
“It can wait...”
Sherlock surprised him by slipping down onto his knees and grabbing hold of John's prick. He had the half-hard cock down his throat before John even knew what he was doing. (Sherlock had prepared himself meticulously, he knew he was safe from bacteria.)
When his Omega emerged, John relaxed and watched him move about the room. “What will happen when we leave here?” John asked.
“Mycroft’s people should be here soon.” Sherlock said. “We can meet them upstairs – let’s avoid Moran’s men, Mycroft will complain endlessly if we kill more of them.”
“Mm. After that, do you want to stay with me? My flat isn’t very big, but it’s bigger than this room. And there are in-and-out privileges…”
At the very least, Mycroft had news, information about Sherlock. Maybe even a message! I couldn’t wait to find out!
Tears. Goddammit! John refused to cry – not over that... that utter cock! The fury inside him kept cresting, but when it receded a little he recognized joy, relief... sorrow... only to be subsumed in fury again and again.
"I don't like how he looks at you!" Gereth pouted.
If it was a strange existence for John, Sherlock took it in stride. He’d grown up in a lavish home surrounded by servants after all. The Omega’s main objection was being, as he called it, ‘under Mycroft’s thumb.’ John simply didn’t like being beholden. They needed to find a place of their own.
John allowed it, but his face was stormy. "What do you want from me, Sherlock?" He asked.
“The derelict?”
“You don’t have to talk about anything you don’t want to – but I’m interested.”
I caught sight of a prone figure on the far side of the room. I worked towards him, announcing my intention into the microphone I wore on my collar. I heard the Sergeant send backup with me, but didn’t wait for them.
Sherlock’s last text had said that we couldn’t do anything until tonight. Which meant we’d be up most of the night. I should nap – sleeping in Sherlock’s chair last night had not been restful. I could go lay down on Sherlock’s bed… but what was he doing in mine?!
He shrugged again. "About some things. You know what those people are like."
“I HAVE TO FIND HIM!”
He has displayed nothing but asexuality. People try to chat him up and he either ignores it or purposely misunderstands. He doesn’t even seem notice when other people assume that he and I are a couple. I can protest until I’m blue in the face, he can’t even be bothered to acknowledge it. It’s infuriating sometimes, but it’s Sherlock.
“Over here!” John shouted. Then his lips bussed me again. “We’re getting you out of here.” More gunfire...
“There’s nothing to be done.” I said, avoiding his eyes.
Mary kept in touch as the weeks passed. We started meeting regularly for coffee or pints, her worry about Moran a constant undercurrent.
“Like you’ve eaten something sour.”
There! Invisible to anyone standing at my grave, but obvious to me as they flanked John and Mrs. Hudson. For a moment, I thought they might attack my friends right here in the cemetery. I readied myself for a fight. But then the woman moved on, circling back towards the man.
“You too?” John asked Shane.
(As doubtful as I was about my potential fellatio abilities, at least I had a bit of experience with rimming! I knew I could please him.)
“You OK?” He asked, mopping the cum from Mycroft’s abdomen.
“You don’t...!”
Shane shrugged. "Since you slept with him..." His manner turned sincere, his eyes sad. "I don't know if this will work. Sherlock... he doesn't make it easy to like him... but I... I don't want to lose you, John..."
The cab pulled up outside 221 Baker Street and I struggled out immediately. My hip had stiffened and the first few steps were agonizing. But all I could think of was escape.
But it had to be a very good disguise – Mycroft was right, we’d gone to great lengths to neutralize Moriarty, I couldn’t throw it all away for sentiment. I would have to be unrecognizable not just to Moriarty’s people, but to Mrs. Hudson and John. AND I’d have to foil computerized gait analysis and facial recognition programs.
Jesus, John disgusted himself, sitting here wallowing...
We talked as much as we fucked. He told me about his work, about his dreams and plans. He wasn't going to be in my town for longer than two years... but he said we could visit each other whilst I was 'still' at University.
John fucked me through it, ramming himself into me. As I shuddered to limpness, I felt his cock expand and fill my guts with heat. John groaned epically, his hands loosening their hold so I sprawled boneless as he came inside me. He collapsed onto my back, the sweat on his face soaking through my shirt to mingle with the sweat on my back.
They had been in this room for three days subsisting on water, energy bars and sex. John was all but exhausted from naught but cat naps. And he’d never had so much sex in his life. It was non-stop – they might get an hour after John’s knot receded before Sherlock was begging for more, his body actually in pain for want of John’s Alpha cock, and John was hard and lusting for his Omega with a desperation he’d never experienced.
John waited. "Yes?"
Honestly, I didn't want to pull away from Sherlock's kisses. I remembered kissing him just as frantically in my dream, kissing him, trying to get through to him...
“Yes.” Mary agreed, her eyes blazing. “But Seb failed. Stupid old man with his stupid rhyming slang – that’s an affectation, you know. He came up in Wexford not Brixton.” She scoffed. “I came here to see your corpse, Sherlock Holmes. When I found that THING instead…”
“And takeaway. We had takeaway at hospital every evening.”
“You ARE safe with me.” John said. “No one can hurt you here. I won’t let them.”
John!
“Not bad, innit.” Lestrade said, amused. “Not your usual standard, I’m sure...”
Anwen was grimly silent, but she was still with us, trotting doggedly. I took her hand.
The Alpha rubbed his thumb across the almost-healed bond bite on the back of Sherlock’s neck and smiled as his Omega melted against his chest. Within their link, John picked up the ball of dread and began combing through it, pulling apart the strands and examining them. Mummy was a distant figure, brusque and impatient, but not threatening… until the terrible absence of papa. To lonely little Sherlock, Mummy became a fuming disciplinarian, Sherlock’s nemesis in a battle of wills… mother and son throwing their rage and loss at each other indiscriminately. Gradually Mycroft inserted layer upon layer of intermediaries between them, not least of which was himself, so they rarely dealt directly with each other. Mummy and Mycroft would confer – Mycroft urging her to soften her more unreasonable and reactionary impulses – and Mycroft would communicate Mummy’s latest edict, urging Sherlock to compromise. Sherlock would then ostentatiously ignore them both despite the knots it caused in his stomach. Over the years, the knots had calcified and solidified into this ball of dread labeled “Mummy.”
"It wasn't your fault, John."
“Yeah.”
I just had to hope she wouldn’t tell anyone (or everyone) about this conversation when she got drunk again.
"All right." John said, forestalling another comment from Shane. "What do we do?"
Eventually they slept.
Sherlock remembered that night. That wonderful, horrible night. "It was stupid." Sherlock said. "He'd fallen asleep – we were on the couch – and I let him..." Sherlock sighed a long, shuddering sigh. "...lay in my lap." It was starting to rain outside, turning the shrubbery a deep, verdant emerald. "I... indulged myself. Just once, I held him like... like a lover would." Sherlock remembered the warmth, the weight of John in his arms, the way he smelled – faintly of aftershave, musk and wool – the way he had turned into Sherlock's chest and... and... snuggled. Sherlock's heart had broken with love and he knew he could deny John nothing.
John pulled back and thrust again.
“I’ll check. But he might not have used it there, purposefully. I’d think it’d be memorable.”
"Angus, I've been dumped – long before I met Sherlock! More than once! Everyone's been dumped! Everyone who's ever been in love." John huffed, his anger was fading. "Taz really did a number on you... but I'm not Taz. This –" John gestured at Sherlock's doorway. "This isn't anything like what happened to you." He squeezed the husky nurse's arm. "You have to trust me. This is my life. My problem, not yours."
“John, you’re in pain. Your body has undergone a trauma. It's stressed, trying to heal. Your defenses are down. You haven’t been able, physically able, to practice the forms... it’s not surprising you’re vulnerable.”
Adrenaline - John had met Shane when he was coasting on an adrenaline high. Unconsciously, he associated Shane with that feeling. He really had supplanted Sherlock.
Sherlock makes a new friend and John unpacks – moving cartons and his psyche.
As he fought with his jeans – his erection making them difficult to remove – the Omega turned onto his elbows and knees and presented, arse in the air. Freed from his clothes, John knelt behind him, inhaling deeply. John leaned in and kissed an alabaster flank, his fingers dipping between the Omega’s legs, finding his entrance slicked liberally with his natural lubrication.
“But I had to... perform... successfully.” Sherlock shut his eyes tightly against the memory, covered his face with his hands. “I let her blow me. I did whatever I could to get excited... to stay excited... to get it over with quickly.... I thought about men I’d lusted after, men who’d sucked me off, put them in her place... I did everything but think of you. John, I couldn’t have you in that horrible room.
And with the empathetic link, Sherlock knew that John truly meant it. He was completely sincere. He didn’t just talk a big game, he walked it. He believed Sherlock should choose for himself what he wanted to do.
“It has to be. Come on, where can we hide?”
"Mm. Seriously, why ARE you here? You're ok?"
John was so tense, so earnest, I couldn’t help but smile a little. “Surprised?”
In between, Lestrade and his squad were issued firearms and sent out. It was surreal and terrifying — singly, and in small groups, the infected were manageable. They were muzzled and straightjacketed and bundled into police wagons bound for hospital…
It was so strange, Nazer abused me as much – more – than the rest. He thought nothing of punching me or fucking me raw. But he also seemed to care, in his own stunted way, about my well-being. “You had a dog.” I said as I sparked the lighter under the spoon. “You had a dog you loved. You took care of it. Big dog... bull terrier.” The breed was a guess, but it was a good one.
