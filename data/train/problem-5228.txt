“Like this,” Natasha says, inclining her head and the noise is faint at first, but then grows stronger until Steve can hear the babbling of a small brook, mere dribbles of water running parallel to their path. He can see it through the trees every here and there, and as they walk onward, he can sense it widening into a small stream.
“Does that mean that if I get in the car, I can leave the door open?” Tony asks, to which Pepper sighs hugely, and Tony shoots Steve a smug grin before mostly closing the door without actually latching it.
Tony snorts, arms flapping briefly before settling across his chest. He slouches down in his seat so far he’s nearly horizontal, legs kicking out as far as possible. “Pepper likes accusing me of lacking in a lot of departments, nearly all of them pertaining to my interpersonal relationships.”
Tony’s hand lowers; slowly at first, and then snapping the rest of the way into his pocket as he clears his throat and tips his chin up. He suddenly appears to take up more room than he does ordinarily, but Steve’s been immune to his intimidation tactics since twenty-twelve.
It’s not as scary as he thought it would be. He’s not crying, sure, but there’s still a relentless flood that rushes and will take ages to slow down and calm. It’s not so terrifying when Tony tugs him in, helping to nestle Steve’s face against his. Tony helps, taking the destruction and turning what could have been the biggest mistake into the greatest decision Steve has ever made.
“I thought, if I love you, and other me loved other you, then maybe every version of me to ever exist has always, and will always, love you.”
“I am not,” Steve says, shaking his head as he dries his hands with a paper towel. He knows he doesn’t look like himself anymore, hair nearly entirely white and his face only retaining a fraction of the angled handsomeness from his youth. While appearing youthful for his age, he knows that this acknowledgment isn’t enough for even a genius like Tony to be able to approximate his real identity.
Bruce is clutching a half-empty bottle of wine and swaying slightly over in the corner, and Natasha is fully seated on the counter and mid-laugh, wrapped in a hoodie at least three sizes too big for her. Pete and Sam are arguing over the music selections, Bucky on the fringes while attempting to shake off the raccoon-looking creature who seems a little too interested in the vibranium arm.
It’s impossible not to feel for him, which is why before he’s aware of what he’s done, Steve’s got a hand on the back of Tony’s clammy neck.
“No,” Steve repeats, because no matter how good it had felt, he’s got to hold himself to some standard above getting off with Tony Stark in the back of a nondescript car on a night that one of them may or may not remember in the morning. Not that he’s not about to point any fingers, but he stuck to seltzer the entire night for a reason.
Steve thinks of the Ramirez girls, and Jackson, and how close he’s gotten to those who are still there. He still draws on the concrete, butterflies for Christina and racecars for Lance, and Ben still asks for Iron Man. He draws, wears down the strawberry and sunflower sticks of chalk until they’re nearly gone and all that’s left is the sky blue for the eye slits and the reactor.
“Bold of you to assume he’d even remember me,” Steve says, eyes flitting over where Tony is currently trying to play-wrestle Jennifer Lawrence’s newly obtained gold statue away from her.
“Morgan,” Tony says, and Steve nods. “I guess I’ve got to set a good example for her, or whatever. That’s what Pete said. Guess I’ve got to set a good example for him, too.”
Steve is just the guy who lucked out with his version of a big break thanks to a coworker’s food poisoning, and his humble beginnings aren’t going to let him forget what that means for everything else. He picks at the skin next to his thumbnail where there’s a mysterious blue pen splotch that he hadn’t noticed when getting ready, and avoids Tony’s all-too-serious soul-sucking dark eyes.
He feels it in his hand. The cosmos are still in his hand, only this time tied together to form a circlet, petals tender to the touch and stems wrought with tension. No matter how they bend and threaten to tear apart, Steve knows instinctively that they won’t, not unless he lets them. Their resilience is dependent on him.
He knows that his presence changes things. He’s capable of helping her, of feeding her and changing her and helping her move around the one-story house he’d had the forethought to purchase years before. They love their little home with their white picket fence and Steve’s garden, the wallpaper in the laundry room and the renovated kitchen that had been his gift to Peggy for their sixtieth anniversary.
“Tony is worried you won’t make it back here,” Rogers says, leaning forward to balance his elbows on his knees as he looks above them, at the sky that’s threatening to open up at any moment. “He doesn’t want to tell you, but he’s not sure what kind of strain that travel will inflict on your body.”
His heart beats a restful sinus rhythm and he measures his breathing while reminding himself that this is his job. He’s good at his job. He can do this.
“I'm greatly offended,” Tony says, pressing a kiss to her cheek. Pepper accepts it reluctantly, and Steve drains the wine and places the glass to the side of the spotless sink. “Tell me if it starts making funny noises again, I’ll come over with a real tool kit.”
Somehow during the night they’ve found their way to each other. Steve’s body wraps around Tony’s so entirely, face pressed to the back of his head so close that the faint scent of shampoo tickles the inside of his nose. His arm hangs around Tony’s midsection, loose but protective, and Tony’s bare feet are pressed to Steve’s ankles where his pajama pants have ridden up. Steve’s other arm serves as a pillow for Tony’s head, slow and even puffs of air turning the inside bend of his elbow humid.
“I wasn’t even there,” Steve says, and it feels self-flagellating and pathetic, but Tony shakes his head and holds Steve closer.
“You wanna tell me about you?” Tony asks, and his mouth, his goddamn fucking sin of a mouth, fits right up against the thin skin over Steve’s thumping artery. It’s brief but intentional enough, and Tony shifts back not more than an inch. Giving them an out, Steve notes.
“Your ribs are okay?” Steve asks, and when Tony glances down, Steve isn’t looking anywhere but the mottled red-purple-blue, the bruise ugly and still settling in. “No cracks?”
When Steve wakes, he’s neither surprised nor disappointed to find Tony absent. Instead he just calls for FRIDAY who points him in the direction of Tony’s lab - which does have secret passageway access, he makes a note to confide in Wanda. He doesn’t bother with clothes, just asking FRIDAY for blackout mode. Tony is absorbed enough in whatever he’s tending to with a furrowed brow that he doesn’t notice, not till Steve approaches from behind and wraps his arms around bare shoulders.
“Good,” Tony says, feeling exactly how Steve looks and thinking that everything makes sense now, despite how he hadn’t seen it coming at all, too absorbed in his own fantasies. “Bedroom, then?”
So he keeps his story neutral, refuses to take a side. He speaks like the most unbiased of historians, telling Tony of how he’d left his shield and Tony behind without the gory details, and manages to keep the emotion out of his voice. It’s not an easy task, but it’s an important one.
Tony hadn’t pointed out that the shield hadn’t belonged to him, that the shield had been Steve’s, but he knew better than to pick an argument when Steve’s mind was made up. He’d just sat there, mourning the loss of a man he hadn’t known even a fraction as well as he would have liked to, and let Steve do the same.)
"Car accident," Strange answered before Tony could even ask. He held out his free hand generously and Tony let it drape over his palm. It trembled on the flat surface of his hand and Tony bent close to trace the concave red lines with his eyes. He briefly - madly - considered taking his shirt off as a trade; Strange would be fascinated by the arc reactor. "Fifty-two broken bones. And they couldn't save the Huracán."
surprise Tony. It was hard, befitting of the most recent iteration of the Cap suit he wore to the night’s event, and it left no room for argument. He even seemed to stand bigger by Tony's side, feet parted just so and his jaw square and stubborn. “I need to borrow my fiancé.”
“Certainly. Congratulations on the engagement, Tony. I’m sure we’ll meet again soon," Strange clinked his glass against Tony’s in a celebratory farewell before he inclined his head in Steve’s direction. “Captain Rogers.”
Tony sighed and tossed down the book to the coffee table with a tired flick of his fingers, all of the fight leaking from him. He scrunched his toes in the soft rug beneath his feet and made a decision to ignore how surreal the whole situation was. He sat on the couch instead, slumped like a fabric doll with his legs stretched out in front of him. He stared across the room at the electric fire hearth and wondered if Steve hated it.
Tony took a few long gulps until the water was half empty, then threw the bottle aside. When Steve kissed him again his lips were cool and refreshed in contrast to the warmth of their bodies.
When the cloth was discarded over the edge of the bed Tony gathered him close, mirroring the way Steve had held him after he woke from his night-terror. He ran metal fingers along the man’s spine with the barest of touches and found himself grateful that his father had worked to make the body beneath his hand strong. Even with delicate health, Tony would want him, but he was so glad he wouldn’t have to know so keenly the worry of a Steve Rogers with brittle bones and a rattling respiratory system.
They hadn't fixed everything. And soon they would need to decide on the next course of action to take: how the outcome would affect the team, what it meant for their future together.
He hadn’t anticipated the bittersweet joy that came to choke him during his first trip back in time. He had watched as he and Tony of the past ignored each other, both too concerned with the day's events to banter together as Clint and Nat had. While his past self was tired and ran checks with S.H.I.E.L.D - keeping busy - Tony looked exhausted. He hid it well, but Steve had lived this day three times and each time it was more obvious that Tony needed the comfort of his team and wouldn't ask for it.
"So you did. You came back," Thor laughed, disbelief turning the sound brittle as he clutched at his brother's shoulders in a strong grip lest the trickster disappeared again. “You’re back.”
And, like a coward, he had jumped into the past to hide from his heartache at the soonest opportunity.
way, but something more friendly. It was a joke with respect to their past, not a sincere offer, and Tony appreciated the banter. He was never one to hide from his past (mistakes and all) and he was glad Stephen wasn't going to let it come between them. Especially if they were going to be assembling together in the future.
Steve held onto him desperately like he was weak to the force of his own desire. He rutted roughly, without finesse, and it had been so long for Tony - so long since sex was just bodies swept up in a cataclysmic need to be close and feel good. They needed this. They both did.
wasn’t that sad? He was right back where they started a decade ago; pining after a man who sought him out once for a post-victory screw.
"I briefly imprisoned his brother and helped him find Odin before he passed." He shrugged. "Thor grows attached easily. He seems to be under the impression that tentative ally means friend. He has visited the Sanctum several times since."
He shouldn't think about it. He had stolen this moment from the universe; he shouldn't let his mind wander elsewhere. He forced himself back to the present and savoured the warmth of Tony firmly against his body.
It had taken Tony approximately two and a half years before he was comfortable enough to take things that Steve handed to him. He didn’t remind his lover of that, nor did he explain why it was easy to accept something from Strange. Neither of them wanted serious, so instead, he opted for reckless. “Muscle memory. Can’t forget
(There was probably something to say about why he consistently rebranded Stark buildings for Avengers purposes, but Tony had neither the heart nor the patience to speculate.)
“Yeah, come on. I want your come all over my dick, I want to be covered in it,” he panted, too aroused to be sure of what he was saying. He might’ve felt shame, but he knew Steve got off on his talking before and hoped he would enjoy it equally in the present. “Just like last time, that’s it.”
Maybe what Steve needed (as Bruce needed to get out of his head; Thor needed companionship; Tony needed Pete within a thirty-mile radius) was to not be friends with him for a bit.
“You’re a menace, Parker!” He called after him, Peter’s following laugh unavoidably making him chuckle too. Tony smiled for a good long while after that, even as the shadow of the past loomed overhead.
Something about that seemed to do it for Steve too, who began to stroke faster, his breaths loud in the short space between them. Tony keened, arching his back to try and get closer, to feel the patter of kisses he knew the other man ached to decorate his spine with. But Steve was long, had always been long, and he could wrap two fists around himself well before nudging up against Tony's cheeks if he wanted; Tony had quite a way to go to be filled. The hand at his back kept the distance between them and, again, Tony almost came then and there from the pure
When they call his flight to board, he waits until the very last second to toss his trash and find his seat. It’s agony, waiting to get in the sky, and as soon as they’re given the okay, he slams down his tray table and picks up right where he left off.
Steve wonders if he’s capable of blushing as hard as he used to when he was young and his circulation was not yet diminished.
“So you’re here by what, pure chance?” Tony asks, shaking his head like the very concept is ridiculous. “You could have stayed there, or gone back, and ended up with your Peggy till the end of time - and instead you’re here?”
Tony enters the coordinates and helps him up the stairs while Rogers lingers, fingers white-tight around the rim of the shield. It’s as easy as can be, which perhaps isn’t saying much, but Tony jokes and Steve is leaving this world intact, which is really all he’d ever meant to do.
“Technically, I think Thor and Carol saved the universe,” Steve says, and Tony digs his nails into the back of Steve’s hand. “But you definitely helped.”
So Tony does what he does best - he takes matters into his own hands until the table is nearly groaning with the weight of it all. He encourages Rogers until he’s tried everything the waitress brings over (she’s perked up considerably at the prospect of an exorbitant tip), and it’s hard to look away from this new form of entertainment.
He doesn’t return to that parallel universe, and knows that Rogers doesn’t expect him to, that Tony isn't hoping he will.
Tony half expects Steve to back down and mumble some excuse, but is pleased when instead he stands up to his full height and levels Tony with an evaluating look.
“I have one. In fact, I have an entire compound that you’re about to be forcibly removed from,” Tony retorts, and Steve just grabs his face and - well, he figures out that it’s actually not all that difficult to shut Tony up.
Steve sets his personal phone down on the desk, grips the landline, and shifts the mouthpiece far enough away that he can exhale in conflicted frustration while parsing through what an appropriate reply might sound like.
, and Steve should walk away, should excuse himself to the Stark Industries-billed hotel room and finish off his night with sitcom reruns, something fried from room service, and a phone call to Natasha as documented proof of his self-control.
“How’d you know?” Tony asks in surprise, before shaking his head. “Of course you knew. You knew me, of course you know. Coming along swimmingly, now let’s get you inside, it’s about dinnertime. The others are out doing recon, should be back later, but I can get you something now.”
“No, you’re not,” Tony says, partially straightening and cocking a contemplative head in Steve’s direction. “But then again, if you were, I wouldn’t be asking in the first place.”
“Good question,” Steve says, and Tony doesn’t have to look to know how he’s drawing closer. “You want to dig it up, don’t you.”
“You asked me about Peggy,” Steve says, the old instinct to avert his eyes and hide overridden by general awe at his new reality. “Can I ask - ”
“Do you know what you’ll do after?” Steve says, an eyebrow raised and one side of his mouth hitched up.
“I spent a long time finding my worth in the things I was able to do for others,” Steve says. “And when I felt like I didn’t have anything to contribute, I couldn’t stay. But I know now, the kids have made me believe that I am more than Captain America. That I don’t have to stay on active duty in order to matter to the people who matter to me.”
The band holds him in its vice-like grip for months, multiplying until there are so many that it’s a miracle they don’t ruin him.
“Can you blame me for being curious?” Christine asks, lifting one arched eyebrow. “Or should I remind you that in the nearly four years since I showed you to your old, tiny cubicle back in the bullpen - ” (he scoffs at the notion that an environment in which salad without kale is as good as a carb and people regularly leave an hour early to make it to their waxing appointments on time could ever be considering a fucking
He doesn’t even notice that he’s stopped kissing Steve until he feels a bare palm right above the waist of his pajamas, skin-on-skin and sticky after so long in the steamy outdoors. They’re just panting against each other's mouths, and the intimacy strikes him stupid.
“The house isn’t in my name,” Tony states, and it’s true. The house legally belongs to Denise and Josie. “It’s not mine.”
The compound is ruined, and the Tower hasn’t been theirs in years. There are offers from others: Sam and Bucky are eager to restart their lives, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, without five years of baggage weighing them down; Clint’s family farm has a certain amount of nostalgia attached to it, but that’s a dangerous road to travel down; Pepper tells him that there are funds, and he’ll always have a place in their lives, but it only takes one look at Morgan at her sleeping father’s side to know that her words are more obligatory than anything.
He sidles up carefully, coffee cradled in his arms, looking to try and see what’s gotten Steve’s attention. “Do you want a rotisserie chicken for dinner?”
It’s darkly deprecating, a grim shouldering of responsibility that’s more revelatory than anything else he’s said.
He smokes the cigar and drinks the whiskey, and when he’s finished, he wanders outside to the snow-blanketed courtyard. It doesn’t take Peggy very long to find him, to see the tears in his eyes.
“I don’t know,” Steve repeats with a helpless shrug. “And don’t tell me, I know I need to figure it out, so save your breath.”
Morgan crashes into him, all briny-wet and smiling with her adorable baby teeth. He’s somehow earned her childlike trust, and he smiles back and enjoys the way the water cools his heated skin.
“Yeah,” Steve says, chin dipping in a nod. “I...I don’t think we’ll ever really know what happened in his timeline,” he admits, and Tony’s heart clenches at the accuracy and sorrow of the sentiment. “He never said as much, but Peggy did, once, and he didn’t deny it when I asked.”
“I’m not doing it without you,” Steve says, and he’s so stubborn and Tony hates it, and he loves it. “We’ll see how things go. If this is just a break, I’ll come right back with you. If you want to retire to Palm Beach and never step foot in the compound again, that’s okay too.”
This time, when he looks up at Tony, he doesn’t feel like an overwhelmed, crushing adolescent anymore. For the first time, he feels like the two of them standing on level ground isn’t the grand improbability it’s always been.
“Wipe your mouth,” Steve orders. “I think you’re done drinking, and I’m pretty sure your body agrees with me.”
“Really?” Steve asks, far more exasperated than Tony thinks he deserves. “Are you forgetting that I’ve lifted literal buildings off of you? Single-handedly?”
“Yeah, and you missed it,” Tony counters. “Unless the other me turned out to be a fine substitution, which is entirely plausible, but might hurt my feelings, so maybe you should lie to me.”
been inhumanly drunk, no matter how well he’d pretended otherwise. He hadn’t needed to send the tux along, but guilt
“You can lean on me, you know,” Tony offers, hoping it doesn’t sound as stupid as it does to his own ears. “I can be here for you. If you let me.”
“D’you really think that’d be a good idea?” Steve asks, and now he’s tripping over consonants and blanking on vowels like he’s never spoken English before. “Considering what happened last time?”
“Anything,” Steve swears, and he’s certain he means it, because he’s a shitty martyr who’ll do just about anything to get Tony to stop sounding like someone ran over his dog.
Are you secretly working for the CIA or something?” a crystal-clear voice demands down the line, and Steve accidentally jerks his hand, sending almonds all over his keyboard and lap. “Because unless you’re working for the CIA, there’s no justifiable reason that would explain why it’s damn near impossible to get ahold of you.”
It’s not a lifeline as much as it is a damnation. Sam nods at the screen, where a well-groomed woman is currently taking up half the spliced screen while standing on the ground outside Avengers Tower. Mouth curling spitefully, Steve shakes his head.
It’s confirmation enough, he thinks, giving in to the way his shoulder blades settle into the ground.
“You know,” Tony says, wrinkling his nose, “if you didn’t want to match, you could’ve just said so.”
“Nah,” Steve says, and they both get up, chairs scraping on the unpolished floor. Tony leaves the empty bottle and glasses where they are, figuring he can deal with them later. “We’re in the home stretch now. Gotta keep focused.”
She just licks salt from her fingers and straightens up, putting her feet on the floor to kick off her flip-flops before her bare feet are pressed up against the windshield. Steve knows he’s going to be wiping footprints off the glass tomorrow, but doesn’t stop her.
“Seriously, I can go.” A doubtful statement, considering how deeply he’s currently ensconced in the width of Steve’s overpriced leather sectional, one of the few concessions to indulgence he’s made over the years. “If you need to just brood it out - ”
“Ah, yes,” he says, as Steve rolls his eyes and faces the water. “Remind me again - how many times did you lie on your enlistment forms? Because I think they’re opening a new exhibit, and I just wanted to personally fact check a few - hey!”
Stronger than ever comes the urge to ask Tony for the truth. Steve doesn’t even have a good reason not to anymore, only that he doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to look Tony in the eye again if he has to confess that he doesn’t know what happened that one night. Which is worse: discovering that they’d been together and he’d been drunk enough to forget it, or being wrong and inadvertently revealing his years-long unreciprocated crush in the process? Tony wouldn’t ridicule him or make him feel shitty for it, Steve’s confident enough in that, but still. He doesn’t know that he can withstand the humiliation he’ll feel regardless of Tony’s reaction, but he does know that it’s no longer fair to either of them to let it go unconfirmed.
The smile that splits Steve’s face in half is such a rarity that Tony immediately thinks it belongs in the Smithsonian, but then automatically retracts the thought because he’d prefer to be the only one aware of its existence for the rest of eternity.
“Just wanted to know if you got the package,” Tony interrupts calmly. “That’s all. Got the confirmation from Bernard, but - ”
, Steve thinks furiously, with no clue how he’s found himself in this situation again - winking in Steve’s direction.
“She would,” Steve says, lingering over a small photo tucked into a mirror frame. It’s of Wanda and Vision, and Steve respectfully doesn't comment on it.
Whatever he’d been working on must not have been important, because Tony doesn’t put up any semblance of a fight. Instead he just lets Steve tug at the waistband of his sweatpants and swirls patterns over the length of his beautiful, exposed spine. Eventually, Steve sinks to his knees and then Tony is moaning, running his hands through Steve’s hair until he’s twisting and pulling hard and muttering nonsense about how the caveman hair isn’t so bad after all. Steve smiles as best as he can, hands braced on the outside of Tony’s thighs. It’s lazy and perfect and when they’re done, he settles back on Tony’s lap and stays there.
He’s beyond insulted. She of all people should know that his ideal honeymoon includes a sinfully lazy and luxurious romp through the Mediterranean, complete with marathon sex between gauzy white sheets and endless scoops of gelato. Sweaty clothing and a seriously frightening impending descent into starvation have never been on the table, and after one seriously misguided farce of a relationship where they both preferred to fantasize about what could be rather than what actually was, Pepper should
“Well, thank you,” he says as he realizes that Pepper must have opted for walking with him over immediately getting in the car after getting her coffee. “What you did, it did a lot for me. Without you, I’d still be stealing coffee from the office instead of treating myself to five-dollar lattes every now and then.”
The first time he notices, Thor is in the middle of trying to steal a handful of his fries and there’s gritty dust still caught in his eyes every time he blinks. They’re in a quiet oasis in the middle of the post-Chitauri chaos, and the food on the table between them all is the only thing to distract from the thick taste of burning metal that insists on lingering in the back of Tony’s throat.
“You seem pretty mad at him,” Peter observed, voice tense as though he was ready to go one on one with Captain America on Tony’s behalf. Again. “Did he do something bad?”
He felt someone come up behind him and looked up to find Clint peering over his shoulder. “Ugh,” the archer said. Tony frowned at him rudely.
“How’s our newest resident god doing?” he asked and subtly drew his glasses back down to the bridge of his nose so he could check the time.
"You just like it when I put the work in,” Steve replied wryly, tucking the chain of his engagement ring below the buttons of Tony’s shirt. It clinked against the arc reactor as it settled.
He pressed the heel of his palm into the strained line of Tony’s erection through his expensive trousers as he plundered his mouth, groaning at the sheer majesty of it all. “What do you want?” he asked, forehead bumping Tony's, once the overwhelming urgency was somewhat out of his system. His voice was thick and almost unrecognisable.
“They’re fucking - you’re fucking, right? You finally-” Clint said quickly, the bedraggled state of his hair and dark under-eye circles causing him to look a lot like a mad scientist. His eyes darted to Peter, before deciding any hopes of appearing polite in his company were hopeless.
He felt Tony shudder as he kissed him again and allowed the other man to fuck his newly slickened fist for a few moments before taking his hand away completely.
“Tony,” he bit out through gritted teeth, hands clenched into fists against Tony’s shoulders. There was only so much torment he could take. “Are you going to suck me or not?”
He smiled softly and sighed a breath of relief. With a final kiss - gentle and placed perfectly - Tony followed Steve into a heavy slumber.
Steve pulled back a moment and Tony was afraid he had made a misstep. He tried to keep his expression neutral, unsure how much of him that Steve could see in the dark between them. Something must have been right, as Steve was kissing him again and gripping him tightly. He rolled them, until Tony was comfortably pushed into the mattress and pillows, and lined their crotches to one another.
Hopefully, it was not the one about the feather boa. He wouldn’t have approved the one about the feather boa. Right?
Everyone turned to Thor, whose disposition quickly transitioned from eager-for-battle to aghast-and-betrayed.
He kept up the torturous pace - body trembling with effort - and maintained a keen eye on his lover, anticipating his next direction when the madman had had enough of this game.
Steve was half upright under the sheets waiting for him when Tony returned but settled into a supine position when he was joined in the bed. Tony turned to face him, discernible in the dark by strands of his hair made golden in the light of the fire. He would estimate that five inches separated them.
But, ever since coming back from the past, Steve had been risking the team harmony by avoiding Tony and keeping
“Are you ready?” Steve asked, not sure how much longer he could wait listening to Tony’s dirty mouth while his cock bobbed heavily between his legs. He pulled his fingers out from Tony, only using the tips to massage at his fluttering reddened hole.
“Yeah, yeah, okay.” Peter interrupted, his mouth twitching at the corners as he rolled his eyes. “But you owe me a trip to the Smithsonian and two-” He held up two fingers imploringly. “
“You’re an Avenger now!” Tony urged. If Spidey was on the case, he wouldn’t have to think about any of it. He would just have to wait for Steve to crumble from guilt and come find him. A perfectly adult solution to a sticky situation. “Mostly. In all the ways that count. It’ll be good for you to get some practice in.”
Sure, they'd met (and left early) at a few galas in the past; celebrating the hospital, the children, Stephen's godlike touch probably, et cetera. Tony turned up for the booze and good publicity and had always thought Strange was the same.
Tony smiled and let his eyes wander between the freckles that adorned Steve’s back. They looked like splatters of paint, leftover from an enthusiastic sunset artist. He had smiled because he knew Steve would ask and had spent some time (in-between scrolling Instagram, annoying Fury, and communicating with FRIDAY) considering their options.
"Please," Tony moaned and the word was almost meaningless. He pleaded for nothing in particular, he just wanted Steve. Forever, always.
Steve’s fingers put uncertain pressure on the skin at his waist again, but this time it felt like fidgeting and Tony couldn’t have that.
“Ready, beloved?” Tony teased, a smirk tugging at his cheek. He had intended the name to be a joke - to get Steve to blush in front of the team - but they weren’t paying attention and Tony rather liked the feel of it leaving his lips.
There was no lightning as he stepped foot into the courtyard, but petrichor and gunpowder assaulted his nostrils and the air was thick with static humidity. No roars from Professor Hulk, which didn't mean much, but no smashing either.
"Whatever you want," Steve promised, kissing his forehead and making sure he was steady on his feet before pulling back. He zipped himself back up and rummaged in his belt pockets, then knelt at Tony's feet as he procured a wipe and began swiping away lube and sweat from his body.
like that. All those years in the ice must have got you worked up, huh? I know that must have been frustrating. God, I’m shocked you didn’t bust as soon as I touched your pristine engineered prick,” Tony rambled, coaxing, his stream of consciousness only interrupted by a grunt as Steve began to finger-fuck him in earnest; forcefully shoving his fingers into his hole and the muscles had to relax against the onslaught.
He stood between Tony's thighs and gripped his neglected prick, slowly dragging his fist the whole length from base to tip, drawing out a breathy moan. Tony kicked his legs free from his trousers and reached for Steve, one hand at his waist and another a little lower.
“How-?” Steve took a step towards him and Tony stumbled, body torn between wanting to throw himself towards the man and refusing Steve the honour of being anywhere near his presence, even for a punch in the teeth.
Now that it was on his mind, Tony found that he couldn’t rightly remember the last time Steve had allowed himself to smile at one of his jokes. He knew that sometimes Steve did want to smile at him, but rather chose to keep it locked up away from view. During the past half-year since the defeat of Thanos, Steve rarely smiled with him at all.
- he didn't want to fight anymore. Instead, Steve nodded in agreement, the shawarma was… Fine, from what he could recall. The food itself hadn't made a lasting impact. He had followed the team to the restaurant, shell-shocked and trying to calm the patter of his heart whenever he looked at Iron Man.
Steve shifted away briefly, mere millimetres, but returned a moment later armed with a piece of fabric (Tony did not have enough faculties to hazard a guess as to whether it was his abandoned t-shirt or a stray abused pillowcase) which he used to wipe at Tony’s stomach and thighs with care. His movements were slow, but out of reverence or exhaustion, Tony couldn’t tell.
in the house and you just ‘don’t know’ what’s up with him?” Tony drawled, accepting a fork and a can of soda.
“I saw him give you the once over. More than once, I’m surprised you didn’t notice.” Steve argued and his hands found their way down the sides of Tony’s chest, back to framing his hips over his bruises. He squeezed. “You were holding hands.”
Steve moaned his name like a curse, closing his eyes and dropping his head back as his hands skittered over the skin and metal of Tony’s chest. He was rewarded with a lick and then another.
- that was what pushed Steve over the edge, his pleasure slamming into him as he spilt down Tony’s throat. He arched back, both hands coming up to tug at his own hair as he cried out to the ceiling in disbelief, the shockwaves of his pleasure pulsing through him into Tony’s willing mouth. He felt his cock jerk over and over and Tony sucked him down greedily, mewling his appreciation.
“It’s not- I’m not,” Tony frowned as the words tumbled from the back of his throat. He screwed up a piece of paper just so he could squash something in his hands as he tried to form a coherent sentence. He couldn’t exactly tell the kid he was sour because he just worked out that Steve was avoiding him after travelling back in time for a post-battle booty call. Tony wouldn’t shut Peter out, though; he deserved more than that. Tony would be the first to admit he was a crap father figure, but at least - unlike Howard - he would be there. In the end, he settled on a pathetic, “I’m having boy troubles.”
The two Stones had fortunately been returned to their natural positions without hitch in 2012 New York. He had two Stones left to deliver in 2014, but something made Steve pause. The mission was not complete and there was no reason for him to stick around, yet (as the dust of battle settled, shawarma was consumed, and Loki was sent away in chains) he found himself hesitating.
“It’ll be alright, Tony. You know… Whatever happens, I’ll always be here to steal your bagels from the fridge,” Peter reassured, so earnestly that Tony almost missed what he said.
“I am going to turn in for the evening; rouse me if there is a supper to be had,” Thor said, squeezing Tony’s bony elbow and patting Steve on a broad bicep as he turned off in the direction of the elevators. Thor had always been touchy and Tony was glad he hadn't lost that along with everything else. Sometimes he didn’t realise until Thor drew him into his side how touch-starved he had gotten the past few months.
He swallowed, throat tight. A wave of unbridled shame washed over Tony; not at the admission that his self-worth had been rocked after Steve refused to trust him, but from his own self-awareness: he was referring to himself in the third person. He couldn’t stop it. It didn’t even work to distance himself from the hurt. He used to do that with Howard, and Obie, too. He didn't want to do that with Steve. He didn't want Steve to see his coping mechanisms, his weaknesses.
Back then he had been Captain America to Tony; the guy fresh out the ice, clearly too young and traumatised to be thrust into another war so soon, but with enough arrogance to prove his place in the brave new world. The legend, the hero. The man Howard wasted his fatherhood to find.
Steve got like this sometimes, commanding and assuming more boldness with his actions. He was happy for Tony to take the lead, to top or bottom, to dole out pain and pleasure or beg for it himself (Steve Rogers was always so fair, even in bed) but sometimes he
“That’s right,” Steve said, voice rumbling, and the words oozed like honey down Tony’s spine. “I’ve got you. I won’t let you fall.”
"That's it, doll, that's it," Steve soothed, breathless and Tony wanted to hit him a little for being so fucking perfect. Even now, at the end of his rope, Tony felt a rush of love for Steve. He felt used and owned, looked after and slick with come, but he relaxed under the feathering of Steve’s words in spite of himself, still boneless and desperate. "Just a bit more."
He redirected his attention to a bead of dew slowly rolling down the side of his glass to pool around its base, most likely to leave an unsightly ring mark on the table. The water reflected the light of the artificial beams above them and the large floor-to-ceiling windows to the outside. He wondered if it was cold; if it would taste like the water he was used to.
"Nor I of you," Strange replied with a quirk of his brow. It was a bit smug, the curl of his lip, and Tony had a flash of memory that recalled pouncing for that cockiness. "We've both changed in the past decade," and then his eyes did flicker down to Tony's chest. "But you're half right; I'm not here solely to donate to the cause. Thor invited me."
“Let FRI know if you need anything,” he reminded. Thor had been living with them for a while now, but it wouldn’t hurt to remind him that there were always people around for company. Human or otherwise.
Almost all the way out and then as deep as you can,” Tony babbled, rattling off instructions like he was ordering lunch. They were orders that Steve could get behind. Again, Steve was struck with the feeling that he would agree to anything Tony wanted like this. He might be the stronger man, he might be the one giving, but Tony had Steve wrapped around his finger.
Steve was the type of guy that would tell someone if he had a problem with them. He enthusiastically told Tony thousands of times when he had a problem with him. Instead, as soon as Steve got wind that they might end up alone together, he excused himself and hightailed it out of there as fast as his serum-ed legs could carry him. It was demoralising, to say the least. Tony had thought… Well, he'd thought they had gotten over all that backbreaking baggage between them. Apparently, Steve felt otherwise, just not enough to do something real about it.
“It wasn’t that,” He confessed, his fingers tensing up as they dropped to Tony’s shoulders, trapping him in place. He probably didn’t even realise he was doing it. “He was awful familiar with you. He called you Tony.”
Before Steve - before Pepper - Tony had never had any kind of committed relationship. Strange was far from that, but he was also far from the nameless and faceless stream of individuals Tony had swept himself up in during the mid-to-late-nineties. Strange’s presence in his life - limited, admittedly, to bedrooms and flat surfaces - had been infrequent, but recurring. Which was very irregular for Tony back then, who rarely saw a lover more than once after they’d had their fill.
Tony perked up again when he realised he wasn’t going to push and Steve couldn’t help but stand a little straighter as the energy in the conversation shifted, falling into familiar habits. It was so easy to be around each other like this - without the pain of betrayal and the frustrated shouting-matches - and Tony's relaxed presence was a balm that soothed an ache inside him.
"What I do is much more impressive than that," Strange replied smoothly and Tony got the distinct impression that he was flirting with him - not in a
“Parker is getting good at candids,” Tony agreed, not meaning to gloat but feeling pride all the same. Steve sipped his drink, suspiciously quiet for a moment.
"Well, I'm not going to argue with you there. But even so, you can’t deny the appeal of taking absolute control of my pleasure like that. You seem to forget that we don’t do this just for you; I like belonging to you, I like it when-”
“You look so hot like this,” Tony said. He was panting and struggled to maintain eye contact as every thrust forced him further up the table and Steve felt as though he had been struck by a bolt of electricity; it seemed as though Tony was looking depths of his soul. He wanted to hide but couldn't look away. “Like I’m the fucking mission; like you need to make me come even if it kills you.”
“Not glitching on me, are you hon?” He murmured, running his tongue along the back of his teeth as he monitored the progress, text and numbers flying by in real-time as FRIDAY loaded and processed the new wealth of information.
- returned the Mind Stone to his unconscious counterpart, moments after the second Steve left to find Tony and Lang outside. The third Cap hesitated, as the second had, and looked down at the unconscious form of his younger self for a few moments with a sombre expression laced into a line between his brows. Tony recognised it as the same look Steve had had on his face earlier when their eyes had caught across the courtyard.
rub up against him. He broke free to bite at Steve’s jugular, his voice rough as he spoke, “Oh, he definitely did check me out. We banged on the regular and I still look pretty good, with a more than smoking hot husband-to-be waiting at my beck-and-call. Can you blame him for looking at what he missed out on? And I wasn’t holding his hand. The fact I have had said hand inside me several times completely escaped my notice until
Bruce held up a large hand to silence him and Thor did not react at all - did not even seem to be aware of the dark clouds looming overhead. He was panting as the sky rolled anxiously above. His gaze was transfixed, almost in anticipation. If Thor knew what they were about to face then it could go one of two ways: well, because they had the advantage of knowledge, or horribly because Thor had fought a lot of overpowered aliens in his millennium-long existence and that was before he craved the comfort of a bottle in each hand.
“He couldn’t hold a grudge to save his life,” Tony dismissed with a wave of his hand. “He’s a great kid; all heart and half as stubborn as you... I meant what I said: I won’t have you getting the ridiculous idea in your head that we’re better off apart, so don’t go looking for reasons.” He added with a sense of superiority he did not feel. He pushed his glasses higher up the bridge of his nose and tapped at his tablet mindlessly.
Not one, but two dripping fingers plunged inside his body, coaxing and demanding entrance, and all at once nothing else mattered anymore. The party, Strange, it was all secondary to this. The only thing Tony could focus on was the sudden brutal -
The rest of the team, including Steve,  slowly made more appearances in communal spaces and the great old house breathed a sigh of relief as it was filled with laughter and petty arguments and Clint’s old socks in the kitchen cabinet.
and he would never actually hurt him. Steve wasn't punishing him, he was claiming back what was his.
Like their first time, Steve’s cock remained just as hard as it had been moments before and that erotic thought hit Tony straight in the gut, a slice of a hot blade all the way down to his erection and burning him to his core. He would be able to get so much pleasure from Steve; the guy that could go and go again. Tony had always found the most erotic part of sex the knowledge acquisition and implementation. With Steve, he could learn and utilise and repeat time and time again.
Had the Stone somehow convinced Loki back from wherever he had gone to reclaim it’s lost place in their universe and prevent inevitable paradox? Was a semi-sentient Stone even a
“Naked. You need to be naked- five minutes ago,” Tony said, riding haphazardly against Steve's body.
Tony shook his head. "I’m not letting you out of my sight. You might do something foolhardy like decide we’re better off apart and, Captain, I didn’t grow all this grey hair for you to run out on me again now."
They’d forgiven each other, called a truce, defeated the big bad monster… But they had been through a lot of shit and Tony totally got it if he stirred up some painful memories for the super-soldier. It would be selfish for him to try and rush Steve through his recovery process. It didn’t mean he liked it, but he got it. They weren't friends, not right now. Tony could deal with that. No biggie.
- recall someone implying something about needing a teacher. Seems like you’re doing just fine on your own,” Tony murmured. He was briefly silent, biting his lip as Steve pressed a finger inside him before his chatter started up, fire effectively stoked. “Oh yeah, you just had to be fucking good at this as well, didn’t you? Fuck I’m never going to stop thinking about your fingers up my ass. You’re going to be off punching Nazi’s and I’ll watch the updates wondering if you’d have the nerve to fist me. Another, come on, Rogers.”
“You can call me Steve,” he assures him. “And if I know Tony at all, he’s told you to stop calling him Mr. Stark.”
The second thing he’s learned is that too much of the decision has to do with the politics involved. Tony’d been bitter about it, nearly spitting out expletive-laden complaints about governments before tapering off into a half-mumbled tirade about how right and wrong only seems simple from the outside. His voice had risen again towards the end, after Steve’s ears had thoroughly strained themselves while attempting to catch bits and pieces, to shoulder a burden that no individual should be forced to.
“Yeah,” Steve says, and he’s just as choked up as Tony is. “I asked him before he left, if I could tell you.”
Tony leaves one hand tangled with Steve’s, freeing the other to shift Steve’s face closer to his. They’re already so close, like they’re desperate to crawl into each other for the rest of eternity, but the lack of urgency makes it something else entirely, something indescribable.
Steve would have sworn he’d already made it clear, or that it was so heavily implied that it would be impossible to miss, but he looks into the tortoiseshell of Tony’s eyes and brushes his lips over his eyebrows, first one and then the other, while he readies himself.
“You haven’t told me how you feel about any of this,” Tony says, looking him straight in the eye once Steve has followed suit with his own pants and is looking at him expectantly. Steve opens his mouth, ready to deflect, but Tony holds up a hand. “No, no. None of your bullshit. Come on, I’ve told you how I feel. At least do me the courtesy of returning the favor.”
Steve levels a glare at her, hoping that she’ll dismiss any blushing on his end as a product of the heat from the thousands of bright lights dotting the venue.
“Sorry,” he says, injecting the word with hardly enough sincerity to pass muster. Sam always knows when Steve’s feigning apology; his remarkable ability to see through anyone’s bullshit is one of the many reasons he’s worth keeping around. “You know how I get when you throw things.”
this is something that might be here to stay, something he never anticipated being gifted. It’s more than his wildest dreams and he doesn’t know what to do with it as his mind quickly assembles every event that has led him here. There’s a mental highlight reel, some things in duplicate, another him and another Tony, and being so close yet so far, and this might be the real shock to the system.
It’s surreal, to say the least, to see Tony standing in the middle of the kitchen. Bonnie has indeed given him lemonade in a clear plastic cup featuring Woody and Buzz Lightyear, and she’s leaning against the counter, rapt with attention as she fiddles with her braid. The younger girls are sitting on the family room floor, homework half-abandoned as they listen to Tony talk. Elliot is seated at the breakfast table and working on math, but Steve can tell he’s listening too.
Steve thinks that he knows where he’s supposed to go from here. He thinks he knows what he’s supposed to do.
“I’m serious,” Tony says. “I’m sending you a phone. I don’t want to have to deal with a landline and sixteen other people when I’m trying to get in touch with you.”
“I’m impressed you remember,” is all that Steve can manage to get out, forcing a smile onto his own face. His spinal cord is reeling from the impact, fraying and crying out for attention that he doesn’t have time to give it, not when he’s got to hold himself together long enough to get away from the last thing he’d expected to happen to him when waking up this morning.
Tony exhales long and obnoxiously, crossing his arms over his chest and tipping his face back. There’s just enough slanting moonlight to cast his features into relief, and Steve drinks him in, from the slope of his nose to the curve of his mouth. One day he’ll be able to look at him without being struck by the urge to cradle Tony’s skull in his hands, to tug him close and know that it’s where they both want to be, but that day will have to wait.
A soft exhale blooms through the speaker. “The CIA,” the voice repeats. “Or is it witness protection? Because really, Steve, you keep telling me that you’re just some journalist, but it was near impossible to get someone to actually connect me to your personal line before I was forced to run through the server and find the extension myself. And I’ve got a top-of-the-line AI on my side, you know.”
“Why wouldn’t I?” Tony asks, and he’s got a very expressive face. Handsome, too. Steve shakes his head like he’s trying to get the last of the water out of his ear canals.
“Can Carol even get drunk?” he murmurs, lips brushing Tony’s ear. He can nearly feel Tony shiver and tamps down his grin.
“You can unclench, you know,” Sam jokes with his hallmark easy patience. “I’m not going to ask who it was on the phone that’s got you more pissed than my nephews when my sister takes the video games away.”
Tony doesn’t hold back a grimace. “Like getting the other you to his universe and back without ripping him in half?”
It’s hard not to be enchanted with the way Tony seamlessly integrates himself into the house. Even though Steve is tired from the day he’s had and the toll their drive and conversation has taken on him, he can’t look away as Tony listens to Ben try to explain some of the finer points of the plot. Alexa butts in here and there to explain things her way, and Tony gives them each his full attention.
Of course, because at this point, fate practically dictates that the two of them must run into each other whenever sharing a zip code.
“We worked together,” is all he says, but it’s the most he can offer her right now while he’s still trying to sort it out himself.
A couple of days later, a neat little cell phone gets delivered. It’s probably the same as what Tony’s got, judging from the software and design, and there’s precisely one contact already installed.
Some trivia for you: research shows that the official MCU timeline puts Tony's kidnapping on Friday the Thirteenth. Which is kinda cool, if you ask me.
“It’s just me,” Tony mumbles, and thinks of Steve kissing him slow and dreamy. “It’s okay. We’re not going anywhere. Come here.”
His phone is on the top of a stack of personal belongings on the dresser, plugged in alongside an expensive bottle of spring water and a tiny packet of Acetaminophen. He checks the pile and yeah, there’re his pants and shirt, his overnight bag from the hotel resting on the floor, everything he owns neatly set up for him. The back of his neck flames as he dresses quickly and downs the pills, images and sensations flashing through his head with varying degrees of legitimacy, because there’s no way some of them aren’t dreams instead of memories.
Despite having wrapped up with Peter, Tony’s predictably still sequestered in his workshop. He’s wearing safety glasses, which is new for him, and Steve takes his time poking around the benches. There’s an entire section of the large room dedicated to Iron Man developments, and Steve smiles to himself as he picks up a panel that looks like it belongs to the left arm.
Tony leans forward in the oversized chair, an elbow hitching forward to land on the edge of Steve’s desk. He fumbles embarrassingly but recovers quickly by shooting out a hand to grab at the simple black picture frame in the far corner.
asked too much of her.  He shouldn’t ask anyone to take his life in their hands.  Especially not quite so literally.
To his surprise and against his better judgment (which, to be fair, is usually found wanting), Tony finds himself nodding.
I know that’s narcissistic as hell.  But every time I see them, I just - it hurts.  I’m pulled back to those moments. Not that I don’t deserve to be reminded of the magnitude of my mistakes.  Sometimes I try, but I can’t see past the scars. I can’t see past the reactor. It’s an unacceptable vulnerability.  I can’t - I barely remember what it’s like to be touched or the feeling of being comfortable in my own skin.
Yanking his shirt back on, Tony motions for Steve to follow him to the overstuffed couch in the corner of the workshop, “C’mon.  Story time, Cap.”
“Alright.  Uh, where to start.  Got blown up by my own bomb in Afghanistan.  Yep. Ironic, maybe poetic justice. I didn’t know it at the time, but my business partner slash pseudo uncle - Obie Stane - was selling SI weapons to terrorists behind my back.
With nimble fingers, Steve eases out the damaged wire, taking care to not pull too hard.  He is the epitome of concentration with his eyes honed in and a tiny bit of pink tongue sticking out between his lips.
The brilliant blue of the reactor casts shadows over the hills and valleys of Tony’s scars.  Most were centered around it - thin, faded scars from the shrapnel and longer scars from the initial surgery.  But a few, fresher scars found homes on his shoulders, on his torso.
His life is a complex array of vivid snapshots, an often damning account of his transgressions.  The snapshots provide a stark contrast of befores and afters. Before Afghanistan, his life was a series of lessons in cold-hearted self-reliance.  A man without conviction finding salvation in mistakes made with reckless abandon. After Afghanistan, his life was a series of lessons in helplessness.  A man with conviction navigating a new life on shifting sands, trying to find purchase, trying to do good.
Startling, Steve pries his eyes away from the science fiction scene in front of him and sheepishly lifts his hands, unsure of how to display them.
Tony stares at Steve. Arching an eyebrow, he snaps, “Steve.  If I could teach you how to use a microwave and a StarkTablet, then I can teach you this.”
“Your vitals are holding steady, Sir.”  JARVIS’ dry response is laced with disapproval.  Tony rolls his eyes while peeling off the electrodes.  The AI must still be miffed about not calling an actual doctor.  Whatever. This went better than it did with Pepper, so it seems like a win.
So that leaves Steve.  And trusting Steve. Tony grimaces.  Not an ideal way to spend a Saturday night.   Reopening wounds and exposing his vulnerability.  Handing Steve his literal and figurative heart. Which is not at all ideal because Tony has gathered data through extremely sound scientific methods and is approximately eighty-four percent sure that Steve despises him.  Which is also not ideal since Tony is recklessly smitten. But can he trust Steve? His foolish heart beats with an insistent
Steve hesitates a few feet away, turning to plop the old reactor component on a table, “Tony, you don’t need to -”
Tony closes his eyes, willing himself forward.  “So, um, I hope you have a strong stomach, Cap. There are a lot scars.  Sorry.” He yanks his shirt off in one deft motion, tossing it to the side of his work table.
“Anyway, the shrapnel tried its damnedest to get into my heart.  An Afghan doctor - Yinsen - saved my life. Fished out what he could with the limited resources he had in that cave.  Hooked me up to a car battery. I...I was awake for a lot of the surgery. It, uh, worked as a magnet to keep the shrapnel from piercing my heart.  Upgraded the arc reactor eventually with his help. I - I owe him my life, in more ways than one,” Tony stares at the floor, and Steve gets the distinct impression that Tony is on the verge of tears.  But the moment passes as quickly as it came. Tony pushes forward - ricocheting to the next urgent thought, willing it out into the open, hoping beyond reason that releasing it will quell the anxiety.
Steve’s fingers curl around the hem, and he gently lifts it off of Tony, eliciting a tiny shiver from him.  Steve tosses it unceremoniously onto the floor of the workshop.
It’s humiliating to even need to ask someone for help.  Tony huffs and shakes his head, working to clear away the aversion to reaching out that was ingrained in him.  Asking for help is okay. Asking for help is reasonable. Asking for help is something a well-adjusted human is allowed to do.
Steve’s brows knit tightly together before he launches into one of their careworn squabbles.  “Tony, why didn’t you say -”
“I mean, getting the chance to electrocute me probably only partially makes up for all the times I’ve fought with you over bullshit -”
“Tony, what on earth -” Steve cuts himself off as he stops dead in his tracks at the sight in front of him.
It was difficult enough to ask Pepper for help when she was all he had.  When they were together. He probably - no - he
He thought about asking her again, but it felt too intimate now that they’re no longer together.  Besides, it doesn’t really seem like a favor you can ask of someone more than once. Also - she’d kill him.  She asked him to not make her do it again. And he did promise. And he was fairly certain that no number of meetings attended without fuss or Louboutin heels would persuade her otherwise.
And so, Tony settled on asking Steve for help.  Tony likes to think he reached this decision in a calm and mature fashion.  JARVIS begs to differ, and has the video recording of Tony’s sheer panic to prove it.
“Contrary to popular belief, I’m well-versed in my flaws, Steve.  The list is long,” Tony huffs. “I was raised to value the profitability of war, humanity be damned.   I was raised in front of cameras. Raised to put too much stock into my looks. Playboy reputation to uphold, you know?  But I - it’s so damn
A blessing in disguise.  A terrible privilege. A second chance to do this right.  He’s tried looking at the arc reactor through every available rose colored lens. But at times like this, it’s challenging.  All it does is bring on waves of guilt and panic and self-loathing.
Tony’s fingers grip the edge of his shirt, ready to pull it off, but they hesitate, stilling at the hem.  Tony chews on his bottom lip, anxiety coming in waves.
“The truth is that I trust you, Steve.  And that’s monumentally challenging for me.  Easier to invent a new element. Putting my life literally into someone else’s hands is excruciating.  I was waterboarded in Afghanistan. Was that around in World War II? Was that a thing? Probably. Oh, and Obie paralyzed me with my own invention and ripped the reactor out of my chest.  Fun. I know we didn’t get off to the best start. I’m so used to being alone, to going it alone,” he squeezes his eyes shut for a brief moment, then turns his full attention on Steve, “but I’m more comfortable around you than I have ever been with anyone.”
“You’ve got me,” Tony promised, pressing himself unabashedly against the lethal swathes of Steve’s body. He kissed him passionately, deeply, so that Steve would never be able to doubt his sincerity. “Whenever, wherever.”
force Cap could easily exert. And Steve knew exactly how much Tony could take, always drawing him to the edge and holding him there, never once testing or threatening going over the line. There was precision and power in that control, too. Steve could play him like a well-polished, finely-tuned instrument.
He let the footage play the whole way through this time. He watched Steve enter the workshop and leave sometime later, just as Tony remembered. His past self returned to gather the Mark VII from the floor, a pep in his step, while his other self of the second footage slept hunched over the armour, exhausted and alone.
He asked the god one stormy day why he had left the Guardians and Thor had replied with a long stretch of silence, only the patter of rain on the windows and clash of heavy clouds above filled it.
Tony paused the screen and squinted behind his glasses to compare the still images of the Loki that had deserted them to the one that returned (and had consequently been taken back to Asgard). They weren’t the same person. Undeniably, it was Loki, but in that fifteen minutes of abandoning the original flow of the timestream, something had happened to change him. The hair wasn’t right, nor his demeanour: the original Loki had been sassing Thor and the other Avengers ever since he had been put in chains, while this one was moody and quiet. Wherever he went, it hadn't been good.
In place of saying all of this, he had said something stupid and uninspired (because he could never find the right words for Steve) and Steve left with opportunity in the past. After sobering, Tony chalked the sentiment up to being loopy on space-grown painkillers. It wasn’t a big deal. Steve returned from his trip looking like he hadn’t left and Tony forgot about his missed attempt at a heart-to-heart. That was, he had forgotten until Steve sat across from him during a boring-ass meeting and hid a smile like being Tony’s friend again was the worst idea in the world.
When the tremors subsided to trembles and the occasional stubborn shudder, Tony hooked his ankle around Steve’s and let gravity coax him to fall by his side on the mattress. They faced each other and sweet kisses turned to shared breaths, brows resting against one another.
No words passed between them as they undressed. Steve's robe found its place on a hook by the door and beneath lay Tony's shoes and jeans. His glasses were dropped to the bedside table. They took turns in the en suite, the sounds of the tap and the flush of the toilet quiet despite the silence in the air. It wasn't an overwhelming quiet, but one of unfamiliar domesticity. They had both fought long and hard to get here and exhaustion was clouding the edges of reality.
“You weren’t so bad yourself. You worked really well in the team and stepped up when we needed you,” Steve replied sincerely and recalled how skilled Tony had been in battle, despite being self-taught through YouTube and Wikipedia. Steve leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed over his chest as he admired the man stood surrounded in vaguely organised chaos.
"Yeah, hm," Tony replied and brought Steve out of his thoughts once more. Tony was looking away and he took his protective eyewear off before hitting them against the back of his hand - fidgeting, working himself up to say something that made him feel vulnerable. Years ago Steve would have assumed Tony was being dismissive, too self-involved to hold a full conversation, but in reality, he was presenting a mask of a casualness. He was familiar enough with Tony’s quirks and habits that he could see it now.
Then, he had felt owned - possessed - but not in a way that was caging. It was nothing like Obie or Ten Rings. Even now, as Steve’s spunk covered his cock and wayward pubic hair, and he felt
Steve swallowed and stared at him for a moment before capturing him in a kiss again and - as declarations of love go - Tony thought he’d done okay. Two broad hands came up to cup his jaw and Steve kissed him deeply, long slow movements that spoke of the earnest devotion of his love.
