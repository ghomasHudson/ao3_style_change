“Thank you, Daniel.” Toni smiled and gave him one final wave as she walked into the apartment.
Steve watched his future wife having the time of her life, being thrown around the kitchen floor as Bucky led her in a dance they’d grown up learning. Steve couldn't wipe the joy off his face if he tried. He knew of Toni’s love for the 1930s and ’40s and loved watching her have an authentic experience of it in Bucky’s guiding arms. Ballroom dances and dance marathons were all the rage growing up in the 1930s. Steve never being one for dancing didn’t care for it then. But watching Toni spinning around the kitchen floor made Steve wish he could take her back for a night at a sock hop and spend the evening in each other's arms on the dance floor.
“Hang around this area. We might need a ride home,” Toni told him, watching Steve grin at the shock that was on the cabby's face.
Toni pulled out of Steve’s grip, much to his protests, and turned to face her father. Nothing but anger shining in her brown eyes.
“I’m serious... Toni, you are so beautiful... And this ain’t even an accurate drawing of just how gorgeous ya are... I don’t have colors to really get the chocolate-honey color of your eyes... This was just my first sketch of ya.”
“He’s a great man, Steve...” The blond pushed his face tighter against the genius’s hand and closed his eyes again.
But, Steve knew her answers to all of those questions.
Toni asked, a smile growing on her lips as she lifted her head off Bucky's metal shoulder.
Super excited for this chapter!! Slight mentions of past child abuse. Get ready for some bad ass Toni and protective Steve!!
Toni turned back to her fiancé, smiling as his eyes were still plastered to her body.
“Come on, asshole!” Bucky yelled, grabbing his attention for Steve to then jump on the bigger man's back. Steve closed his hands around the man's eyes, applying pressure with his thumbs until he began screaming for him to stop.
Nice long chapter for y'all!!!
“Dead, you’re dead.” Joseph muttered.
Toni sat there for a minute. Wanting to rub her hands up and down his back, but they were still pinned above her head, locked in the bigger man's grip.
By the end of the gum incident, Bucky had a pretty good haircut going on. Toni had done a nice job shaving the sides, leaving him a little length on top. He looked pretty good, for a victim of a gum accident.
“You’re hanging with the guys, no ifs and's or buts about it.”
_______________________________
“And once you’re done with Reed, you and I can have a little one on one time.” Johnny said, smiling at Toni as he took a sip from his brown coffee cup.
“Flip around,” Steve muttered. “I wanna hold you.”
I'm so, so excited to share this chapter!! It is very special to me and very soft! I hope you enjoy!
That means a lot coming from you.”
As the doors closed around them Toni couldn’t help but smile at the look of shock on Steve’s face.
I loved posting this story and all y'all's comments made it worth writing!! Thank you for loving this story and Steve and Toni!! I can't wait to share more of their adventures together!!! Now as a married couple!
“No, but I will be.” The feeling of the smaller man's grip tighten around her waist was all she needed at that moment. Toni watched as the sky’s color slowly changed from the dusky blue to a muted orange and enjoyed every second of her smaller fiancé’s embrace. “Watch the sunset, babe. It’s beautiful.”
Toni made her way to the penthouse floor, to see Clint, Bucky, and Sam already awake, as her super-soldier was still unconscious.
All three men shouted to Toni; chase forgotten as none of them had expected the brunette to suggest that.
“You’re my greatest creation, Steve. You mean more to me than my brat of a daughter ever could.”
“Superhero’s? Like in the comics?”
Just as Steve was about to comment on the strange life they lead. Strange opened his eyes, taking Steve’s attention over to the wizard.
Toni raised her eyebrow in confusion and asked: “Steve?”
“I love you so much, dollbaby.”
Steve watched as his best friend explained their kisses. He watched as his best friend apologized with a tear running down his face.
“I love me some Hallie Berry!” Sam informed them, rubbing his palms together.
“Don’t hurt yourself, buddy. Let’s get back to nerf war!”
“No, this will only bless you in laughter and joy for the rest of your days.” The trickster god spoke, his voice low as a soft smile grew on his lips. Toni stepped out of her suit, ignoring the shouts of protests of her teammates.
She pulled the door open, revealing an older man - he seemed to be in his late fifties, with short grey hair, and a pair of thick-rimmed, white glasses that rested on his fairly large nose.
You guys should have said something. I’d love to have a guy’s night!” Toni chuckled and felt Steve place a quick kiss on her cheek. “Thanks, doll...” He turned his attention to the guys and said: “So, what’s the plan fellas?”
Toni had that chance right here and she wasn’t going to waste it.
Taking her bottom lip in between her teeth, her eyes raked up and down the super soldier she would soon call her husband. Her fingers pressed gently onto his clothed chest, feeling the firm muscle beneath her fingertips. Making the genius bite her lip so hard she drew blood; her thoughts taking a sultry turn as her mind totally ignored the worry on his face. Toni’s voice dropped into a low whisper as she said:
“I swear to God,” Clint muttered.
“Interesting..” Toni smirked and took a seat beside the smaller blond.
“She needs it more than me.” Bucky pretended he didn’t notice the way Steve’s blue eyes softened as he looked at the dame, or how his gaze lingered, adoringly on the smaller brunette's face.
“Hey,” Toni whispered as she closed the door behind her.
“I mean she’s breathin’... But, I don’t know..”
The Captain’s pupils enlarged as they drank in the sight of his gorgeous
Toni hadn’t been long getting back from the bridal shop, having her last fitting for her gown, as their big day was approaching in the next week.
Bucky took a seat on the end of the bed, sadness prevalent in his tone and expression. Toni looked down at the teacup in his hand and smiled at the sweet heart that her man had. He was always kind, always thinking of Toni's needs before she did, and going out his way with the tiniest sweetest gestures. He was a man that you read about in romance novels, and honest to God it was hard to believe he was real. But, he was and he was all Toni’s.
“Pay the man, sweetheart," Toni told him with a soft smile. Steve reached his free hand into his pocket, feeling Toni’s cash. He brought the wad of cash out of his pocket, taking great pleasure in the admission’s man's shock.
“I’m gonna kill them,” Steve growled, as his hands ran possessively up and down Toni’s body.
“Oh yeah, after the bath I borrowed these, I hope that’s okay. My clothes should be dry by tomorrow evening, I--.”
“No, I also speak Japanese, French, Dari, and Spanish,” Toni told him.
The slight whine in his voice had Toni smiling like a teenager. God, Steve Rogers was so precious. “What are you doing?”
“You’d be surprised at how much this ‘little lady’ can handle.”
He picked the genius up by her waist, sealing his lips over hers. Toni wrapped her arms around the bigger man's neck and kissed her fiancé.
“Useless! Even my own handcrafted AI won’t help me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Bucky, stop it. It’s not all your fault.” Toni began climbing out of the sheets to move closer to the bigger man.
“He’s the luckiest man in the world,” Pepper muttered, smiling at Toni in the mirror.
” They heard Thor as he walked into the kitchen, Mjolnir in hand. “Brother! I told you not to leave Asgard!” Thor took in the appearance of his brother laying on the kitchen table. Coughing and wheezing as he tried to bring some air back into his lungs.
Natasha sent Toni a
“Okay,” Toni whispered and buried her face into his pectoral muscles like she always did. His hands ran up and down her body, being gentle as he brushed the sensitive skin at the end of her right thigh.
“I talk about my feelings,” he grunted, irritation growing on his facial features as his eyebrows furrowed and lips fell in a straight line.
“Shut up,” Steve told him, smiling back down at Toni.
“So, you already have a significant other?” The host asked. The crowd went deadly silent as they eagerly waited for the captain’s answer.
He nodded his head and turned to watch his best friend enjoy his victory.
“Doll, you would have won those dances as soon as they saw that smile.” Steve grinned down at his future wife.
“Alright, boys. Show me off,” Toni said, spinning around in her navy blue-a-line dress.
“Hurry, Toniiiii.” She heard him whine as she closed herself into the bathroom.
“Precisely. I couldn’t channel either of the unconscious soldiers back in the tower as their minds were otherwise occupied with you.” The bearded man said as if this happened on the regular. “So, I just channeled yours and here I am. You know, Stark you should really come down to the Sanctum, we could use a mind like yours. That is if your suffocating super-soldier of a fiancé would allow it.”
“Well, I’ll teach you whatever you wanna know, Danny.”
“I won’t, doll. I can't, you prove it to me every day.” Toni placed a kiss on the taller man's lips and smiled. “Can we take this slow, the whole emotions thing?”
Toni’s heart broke for him. He hadn’t seen them in over seventy years and didn’t even get to grieve their death as they had been long gone before they unfroze him. Toni just watched as the older man's lip began to quiver as he listened to his parent’s voice over the speakers.
“James, it takes two people to tango...” She rolled her eyes, taking a sip of the warm tea.
“I can’t help it! She’s gorgeous, goodness. Steve’s genes and yours, why you two will have beautiful babies.”
“Depends on what you’re packing as to just how cocky I’m feeling, now isn’t it?”
“Oh..” He whispered in shock, and crawled over the genius, taking her lips in a kiss.
As the crowd erupted in laughter again, the next hour flew by.
As they made their way outside Toni saw the tall blond man and a shorter buddy of his leaning against the brick wall. As if they were just waiting for them.
“What is it, Grant?”
“Toni?” She heard Steve ask, concern prevalent in his tone as he looked back at the genius. Toni shook her head, bringing her out of her thoughts of her handsome fiancé.
“Yeah,” Steve whispered, concern showing on his face. Toni shook her head softly, grabbing the small bouquet from his hands. Bringing them up to her nose, taking in the faint smell of the white roses. Relief flushed his body as he watched her smile grow from ear to ear.
“In the kitchen, heating up some soup Elisa cooked up last night. I’ll go get that crazy bugger.” And with that Daniel left the room, leaving the three of them alone.
“What?” Toni asked, confused at her fiancé’s sudden hysterics.
“Yes, I’m sure it’ll be great,” Steve said, throwing a glare to his friend as the bigger man's arm went around his shoulder.
“He’s correct,” Toni confirmed, standing to her feet. “We all live in the tower together, and we fight monsters and bad guys, basically.”
So, Toni stood taller.
“Does he treat her well?" Steve asked softly, Bucky turned to his best friend and flashed him a sad smile.
“Something like that, yeah,” Toni said softly, flashing the younger Barnes a smile. Bucky turned his gaze to his pizza with a bright red blush on his cheeks.
The four boys all turned to face Toni and Natasha; spoons filled with ice cream still in their hands.
“And you’re absolutely breathtaking,” Steve’s eyes drank in the appearance of his
So caught up in watching the relief that flooded the older couple and counting the similarities of Joe and Steve. Toni didn’t even notice she had been playing with her engagement ring until she saw Joseph’s eyes grow wide as he stared at her left hand.
“Gentlemen, let us calm down. It is just a game after all,” Thor said, with a deep chuckle leaving his lips.
“He’s... He’s alright Toni, everyone is safe... Just a bit... Umm.”
“You... You love me?” He asked, ignoring the chaos that just transpired in front of him.
Sarah Rogers raised him better than that, so he only did it for a second or two.
“Then I’m going with Toni.”
The blond nodded his head in thanks, feeling very proud of the emotion he could work up in someone with his artwork. Knowing he drew Toni so beautifully in their moment that someone else saw her as he did. Like the beautiful work of art she was... And of course her
Steve mourned Bucky by drowning his sorrows in whiskey and burying his face in one of his old white button-up shirts that Toni always wore. He swore even four years later he could still smell her on it.
“More handsome than you...” Toni whispered; she couldn’t help the smile forming on her lips. Steve grinned back at the genius resting beneath him and sealed their lips in another kiss.
Toni always thought this was her greatest fear, not the aliens in space, not dying, or losing Steve. But Toni always thought facing Howard again would be her worst nightmare.
“No, she’s mine. Mine only.” He told them, burying his face in Toni’s hair. “You and Clint need to cut that out.”
I’m a strong, intelligent woman. Despite how every single day of my life you shouted at me, telling me I’m nothing.” Toni poked her finger into his chest and growled. “Telling me how dumb I was and reminding me;
Hiding the smile on her lips, Toni looked back to the two men still standing. “What are you two going on about? Sit down and eat your dinner.”
Toni asked softly. Not sure what was actually happening right at this moment. All she knew was she felt a wave of exhaustion rush over her like she had just gotten out of a battle. That Bucky was taking care of her. Bucky made her feel safe.
“Eavesdropping,” Sam coughed.
“Steve--.”
Not five minutes passed before it hit him.
“Milo, nice to see you again,” Daniel said, with a genuine smile on his lips. He took his thick white-rimmed glasses in his hand, cleaning the lenses off on his shirt.
“If I could guess, Edwin... Probably some R-rated drawings of your daughter.” Natasha stood to her feet, walking over to the laughing archer. “And I would really like to see these.”
“Nope, I’d know those blue eyes anywhere. You, Steve Rogers, are an amazing leader,” Toni said and gave his knee a quick pat before standing to her feet. Steve turned to Bucky, his face in disbelief.
“I guess every time, I imagine my future
“White roses symbolize new beginnings. A pure soul, deep love, and even marriage.” The man told them, smiling at his wife from across the flower cart.
This was going to be an interesting game of Charades.
“No, no I want them to meet you, I want you to know my parents. Even if it’s for a couple minutes.”
With that Daniel led them out of the house, like he was just itching to get away from Von Doom even more than Toni was.
“Here’s your next patient.”
Steve growled as he remembered the way Toni’s hips danced in sweet, fluid, rocking movements back and forth on top of his groin. Remembering the way they were skin on skin, glistening softly with sweat, staring right into the others eyes as they made love.
Bucky turned his attention down to the shaking brunette as she rested in his arms, her face buried into his neck - taking soft, shaky, comforting breaths.
“He’s biased. They’re best friends!” Clint shouted.
“You’re having a guy’s night, no girls allowed.”
“He forgot me,” Toni whispered, stirring a laugh from the room.
“A woman? This is the Toni you spoke about over the phone? The one that fixed your radiator and radio? A woman?” Toni watched Daniel’s posture grow stiff as he listened to Werner’s words. “Ted Marshall really let a
And just as they began to pull each other out of their clothes, the lights flickered on and heard the scream of Clint.
“No, Toni’s right,” Steve said softly. “She can speak for herself.” The look in his blue eyes told Toni that even he wasn’t comfortable with that statement that just left his lips.
“He made Toni disappear!” Clint shouted.
“Sorry, sorry,” Steve apologized softly and went back to eating his slice of pepperoni pizza. Pretending he wasn’t interested in the conversation that was about to unfold.
“Oh, shut up, Steve is your favorite.”
But Toni knew with Steve by her side, the world could end, people could die, and she’d be alright - as long as those blue eyes always met her gaze.
“You can say that as much as ya’ want, doll; that don’t make it true..”
“Toni, no..” He whispered, licking his lips as his eyes continued to drink in Toni in his jacket. “That’s your money, doll. You were supposed to use that to buy ya some new shoes.”
The blond didn’t even notice Bucky and Clint’s fierce make-out session right in the middle of the office as his blue gaze was settled on the way of the genius’ hips and her sparkling brown eyes.
Bucky muttered into his hand, watching Toni grieve like he and Steve hoped no one else would have to.
“In good time, but as I was sitting here listening--.”
shorter than Steve). She has beautiful, short brown hair and chocolate eyes that could whisk you off to neverland. But she also happened to be the funniest, kindest, smartest person Steve had ever met and in their three years of working together, they quickly became best friends.
“I can’t lose you, Toni. Not when I just got you. I can’t.”
“Interesting…” Natasha muttered. “What do you say about me and you, sparring in the gym and getting a good workout in? After that, we get massages and facials. Then wine and a movie snuggled up in your bed?” Nat suggested with a smile.
With that job finished, Toni went to the bathroom, taking the coldest and quickest shower of her life. She then wandered into Steve’s bedroom, pulling on one of his white button-up shirts and a pair of his lounge pants. She washed her clothes in the sink and hung them up to dry in the living room. Hoping the radiator would speed that process along.
“Why certainly.”
After Steve and Toni shared their last kiss as an engaged couple, they parted ways right before the clock struck midnight. Clint and Toni snuggled up in her bed, eating ice cream cake and watching FRIENDS.
“Toni... You look beautiful, doll..” Steve whispered as his tongue ran across his lips.
“Next question!” Steve declared, wrapping his arm around Toni’s shoulders.
“Blond hair, blue eyes. He’s 6’4, and 240 pounds.” And with that Natasha noticed the little blond’s shoulders sag back down in disappointment, she also noticed he lost all interest in finishing his fourth slice of pizza.
Instead of feeling scared and uncertain that Daniel somehow knew, she felt safe and comfortable. She trusted Daniel, and that was something she didn’t do very often. Toni wasn’t even quite sure how it happened, she just knew he was one of the good ones.
Also short chapter, I'm sorry. The next one will be up Friday night or Saturday.
“That he is,” Sarah whispered. “That he is.”
“Can I hold you?” Steve asked, his voice timid as his eyes were full of peace.
“Oh, Woman of Iron. You’re going to love this one, I promise you that.” And with that Loki’s hands started to form a green ball of smoke.
Toni couldn’t help the chuckle that bubbled in her chest, listening to Bucky talk about Steve being like his father. When Steve proposed that night after they had celebrated - just the two of them. Steve had told Toni about a quote his father always told him growing up:
“Well... that might have to wait...” An unsure, familiar voice said behind them.
His voice leaves his lips in more of a growl than an actual word.
“How did you know?” Steve asked, biting into the beginning of his second hotdog.
“How the fuck are you here?” Toni asked, walking towards the older man.
She took in the sight of the rickety apartment with sparse, well-used furniture, and minimal decorations on the walls. Glancing down at her outfit Toni noticed she was no longer dressed in her black leggings and one of Steve’s blue, button-up shirts. But, she was dressed in a pair of high-waisted corduroy brown slacks and a long-sleeved, olive-green button-up blouse, tucked into the pants. She glanced around the room one more time and her gaze froze. Her brown eyes took in the appearance of her much,
“I’m glad you used my name,” he told her softly, slowly running his hands up and down her thighs.
Toni turned around, a smart-ass remark ready to roll off her lips, only to turn around to see Bucky holding back a pissed-off, fighting Steve Rogers.
“Sounds amazing.” Bucky agreed as he made his way over to the kitchen table.
“I’m sorry, how is giving billions of people clean water and clean energy - a waste of money? Not to mention how she’s helping millions of US veterans get into therapy. Finding them places to live and helping with their health care. How is this a waste?”
“Thank you," Steve told the driver, closing the door behind him. He smiled at Toni, reaching his arm out for her to grab. “Shall we?”
“You’re my wife! They don’t need to know about your undergarments!”
“Go, we are almost done here.” Reed told her, nodding his head.
“I think you can wait three hours,
He was a man, after all, the serum did not help him in this case.
“At least wait till you’re in the bedroom to undress, son!” Jarvis yelled, a chuckle on his lips as he watched Steve tear down the hall.
“You’ll find someone soon, Sam. I promise.” Steve reassured the fellow soldier.
“Good to be back.” Steve smiled at the shorter man, and out of the corner of his eye saw the old wooden chest that used to sit in his bedroom in Brooklyn. His gaze darted over to Toni before he did a double-take, making sure this was real. That the chest was actually there and this wasn’t his mind playing games on him.
Like this unstable matter that had found his way to hers and while it was enticing and inviting - Toni wasn’t going to lie, it wasn’t anything that she wanted. A surprised groan left her lips as she felt the bigger man's arm wrap around her waist, deepening the kiss as he pulled their chests together.
“You do realize we’ve both officially made out with Steve’s fianceé?” Clint asked his boyfriend. Making Bucky tilt his head to the left, a cocky smile appearing on his lips.
“Yours.” Toni smiled at her crazy, possessive man as his teeth nipped at the sensitive skin on her neck.
“I love you, Mrs. Rogers.”
“No, Steve,” Toni whispered, getting their argument back on topic. “You talk about other people's art.
“I know that! But why haven’t you ever told me you speak Gaelic!!” Toni hit the soldier across the chest. “We aren’t friends anymore. How could you have hidden this from me!”
“The wedding night is always the best,” Sarah whispered with a wink.
“May thirteenth, 19--”
No, his lips were like fireworks.
“Keep the spanking behind closed doors please!” Natasha yelled at their retreating figures.
“Yeah, but I can settle on three or four.” He said confidently as he went back to kissing the brunette's neck.
Toni took a deep breath, relaxing into Steve’s embrace for one more minute before she pulled away - letting her business facade rush across her features.
“Toni?” He asked softly, his blue eyes tearing up as he stared at her with the saddest look of disbelief Toni had ever seen.
“Much better.” He watched for a moment as her lust-blown pupils raked his body, before reconnecting her lips with his. Steve pushed his body tighter to hers, feeling her hot, sultry skin against his. The blond pinned his dame’s wrists to the wall behind her with a loud
“Breathe there, big guy.”
“WE WON!!” Steve yelled as Sam and Clint lifted the smaller boy in the air, after guessing the winning point. Toni sent a wink to Bucky and mouthed
But, that never bothered her, he knew that was a bonus for him.
Or hanging out with Toni in her lab for hours on end, sketching the brunette in her element as she worked on world-changing technology.
The two heroes exchanged their vows, their promises to love one another for the rest of their lives. Their promise to always be there for the other, to cherish them in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer. The superhero couple smiled as their bridesmaids and groomsmen couldn’t hold back tears as the two
Please comment and scream at me.
“Yes, back to nerf wars!” Toni agreed, patting her soldier on the chest. “I’ll be waiting in our bed when you’re done, Captain Rogers” Toni swayed her way down the hallway to their bedroom, with a laughing Natasha trailing after her.
“Okay!” Clint threw his hands over her eyes, as Bucky led her down the hallway.
“No, I don’t,” Steve told him, as he sat Toni back onto
Toni shrugged her shoulders, and said: “I dunno, I just guessed.” She went right back to eating her own hotdog. Steve smiled at the brunette, thinking of how kind she had been this whole evening. Not even to just Steve. But the cab driver, the hotdog man, all of it. She was one of the kindest, most beautiful souls he’d ever met.
“Sometimes,” She told him, watching as the smaller man's hand settled gently over the arc reactor. “But I’m used to it.”
“It’s 11:01...” whispered the older man, a shy smile growing on his lips.
“No! Please don’t!” Sam yelled, surrendering his hands in the air.
“Engaged...” Toni said and smiled down at the family heirloom she carried with pride on her left hand.
“I got him, Natasha,” Bucky stood to his feet, following the dejected blond into the kitchen.
“We’re okay. Aren’t we, Stevie?” Toni whispered, and nodded her head saying: “Yeah, yeah we are.” Bucky took a seat beside Natasha, holding a slice of pepperoni pizza in his hand.
“What stuff?” Steve asked as he laid his future bride down on their mattress, crawling over top of her body, and burying his face into her neck. Toni ran her hands through his blond hair, her nails softly scratching his scalp, comforting the bigger man.
“Well,” Coulson muttered, pulling the two from the candy exchange. “One down, one to go.”
“I don’t like him.” Toni turned back to Steve; a beautiful smile wide on her lips. “I don’t like him at all.”
This is NOT the last story of Steve and Toni! I have SO much more planned for these two!! Thanks for reading!! Y'all are amazing
“No,” Toni whispered, uncrossing her arms from her chest. She took a step closer to her father, standing eye to eye with the man who abused her - her whole life.
Then, there was Toni.
____________________
In reality, finally facing him; it wasn’t. She’d learned from Nicky, Edwin, and Steve that she was worth more. That she was a strong, fierce woman and that Howard Stark couldn’t hurt her ever again because Toni wasn’t ever giving him that power.
He began going through the smaller contents of the chest, smiling at some of the pictures of his family - the scratched and gently faded pictures of him and Toni. The worn ticket stubs from some of his and Toni’s movie dates and the tickets from their trip to the MoMA. Which of course brought a sappy smile to the bigger man's face as he remembered their adventures very fondly.
“Where?” Steve asked in shock, watching Toni as she stood to her feet.
“Mine is for Steve and Toni,” the blonde muttered.
“You’re the nothing guy!” Bucky beamed.
“No,” Steve grumbled through a mouth full of his white rice. Pulling his and Toni’s container closer to his plate. “Get your own food. I bought this for Toni.”
He froze when his eyes landed on her red and blue metal leg opposite to her flesh one.
Once the masseuse exited the room, the two heroes got undressed, and climbed into their beds, enjoying the feeling of the heated sheets on their bare skin.
“Yeah, yeah.” Toni pulled back from his shoulder, her arms wrapped around his neck as he held her three feet off the ground and flashed him the sweetest smile. “Anything to help you, Stevie, you know that.”
Till Toni was finally married to Steven Rogers.
“You’re a wonderful guy, Danny.”
“Hey, Barnes!” Toni yelled through the tears in her voice, as she turned to face the taller brunet.
“James Barnes, this is an absolutely lovely woman you’ve got here. Handy, smart, and gorgeous. You checked all the boxes, son.”
Who snuggled the most? And that everyone answered, the genius’ name falling off all their lips at the same time. Toni just shrugged her shoulders as she continued to stay cuddled up into Steve’s side.
Just as Toni was about to step out of the room, to give the family some privacy she heard Joseph speak: “And where do you think you’re going little lady?”
“Ooh, did you enjoy the show?” Toni asked with a grin, placing her hands on her hips as Strange bit back his chuckle and rolled his eyes. “But, exactly how long have you been in my mind? How many shows did you actually experience?”
Toni’s desk was about eight feet away from his, and he could sit at his computer, dance his eyes slightly over the top of the screen and watch her answer phone calls as she bit held the eraser of a pencil between her lips, accepted packages, and helped out her fellow employees.
“Right, my apologies, Miss. I did not mean to come off as insensitive. I was just in shock, you see.”
“What are we doing?” Toni asked, helping him pull her pants off her hips.
“If we don’t get a call that some random ass dragon is trying to take over the Golden Gate Bridge, I’m gonna throw myself off the tower,” Clint stated, dramatically flopping down in a chair at the kitchen table.
“This, this is not good.” He muttered, hopping off the sofa, making a B-line for the elevator.
A rush of relief ran across Steve’s face as Toni pretended she didn’t hear what had just left Bucky’s lips. Or the way Steve shifted the crotch of his pants as he waddled over to the table.
A beat or two passed before Bucky nodded once more and whispered. “Loud and clear, Stevie. Loud and clear.”
“I thought you guys had another hour left of Q&A?” Happy asked, as Steve helped Toni into the car, closing the door behind him. Thor and Clint in the back seats. Bucky, Toni, and Steve were in the middle row, and Sam sat shotgun beside Happy.
“Yes, Steve, come sit beside these love birds.” Steve threw a soft, confused glance in Bucky’s direction and took a seat on the bed, beside the two.
Toni jolted up, a wide grin on her lips. “Are you joking!? Don’t fuck with me, Rogers.”
Toni laughed into her fiancé’s back, muttering: “I can’t either.”
Steve finally got to figure out where his best girl disappeared too on the third Wednesday of every month… and now, he got to go with her.
“Oh, you’ll freeze out there,” Bucky said, grabbing one of his jackets and laying it around Toni’s shoulders. “Here, what kinda fella would I be if I let my girl outside without a jacket on.”
-eous..” Steve slurred, taking his hands, and running them all over Toni’s face. “Wh-who made you. Be-cause fuckin’ hell, you ‘ra, a -a gorgeous dame.” He gushed, as he stared at Toni’s face like she was a painting on the wall at the Louvre.
I couldn't wait any longer to post this chapter, y'all deserved the fluff!
“I’ve kissed Clint and Natasha, but like a goodbye kiss,” Toni told them with a sly smirk on her lips... “Oh and Thor one time, but that was because he thought it was a customary Midgard greeting.” Toni’s eyes glared in Sam’s direction, and the crowd laughed at the innocent smile on Sam’s lips.
“Are ya decent yet?”
“Toni? What did he do?” Steve asked. “Did he hurt you?
“That’s it!” Steve shouted, only for Toni to grab him by the back of his uniform.
“Shut up, Wilson,” Toni muttered, as she lifted her face from the bigger man's crotch. Sitting back up in her seat, promptly laying her head down on Bucky’s shoulder; not even recognizing The Captain’s still rigid body language. “You’d probably pay to watch that.”
“Yeah, he was an ugly bastard.” Toni agreed, smiling as the older man threw his head back in laughter.
said ‘I Do’.
“Apparently!” Toni shouted, causing a laugh to leave the older man’s lips.
“Steve?” Toni breathed.
“Why do I feel like there’s more to that statement?”
Steve laid back against his blue pillow panting, as he failed at trying to calm his heartbeat down from the events that had just taken place. Toni’s head laid against his sweaty chest as a soft giggle escaped her lips.
“I’d like that, Reed. You and I could get into some real trouble.” Toni smirked as she watched Sue roll her eyes. “We could give our blonds a run for their money.”
“Our past...” They heard the soft whisper leave Bucky’s lips.
The bedroom door creaked open, pulling both heroes' attention over to the door to see half the face of a blond super-soldier, peeking in the bedroom.
“It’s two in the afternoon,” Steve whispered.
“I have no idea, why are you asking me? I’m not the boss.”
The group of heroes were escorted out of the building and into the suburban that waited for them behind the arena.
They finished making their way through the museum, hand in hand, as Steve shared facts about the artists. Loving the smile on Toni’s face as he pointed out details in their work. Loving the fact that he could be so open with one of his greatest passions and have someone love them right with him.
“Go, I’ll be okay.” Toni smiled as Bucky wrapped his arm around his taller brother's shoulder and flashed Toni a smile.
“I’m afraid I cannot, brother, she should be back in a week's time though. No worries, Lady Stark will be in great company.”
“Can’t you hold me like a normal person!”
“Handed the mantle of SI over. Toni is head of R&D and Howard; she's put out more inventions in her first year as head of R&D than you did in your whole life. Toni Stark is a goddamn genius; this world is lucky to have her in it.”
“He’s everything I prayed for,” Toni whispered, twirling her ring around on her finger. “He’s one of the good ones.”
Everything you are is because of
“They’re very close as adults,” Natasha whispered to Bucky and then turned to the other two boys, who sat in their chairs in shock.
Steve couldn’t stop the grin that grew on his lips. God, just when he thought Toni couldn't get even more perfect, she had to go and speak fluent Italian.
“Yes.”
Toni couldn’t help the shock that settled on her face. She had heard Daniel defend her skills to other people before, as they did small jobs here and there. But, he had never gotten this angry. He reminded her so much of Jarvis. Someone who believed in her from the moment they met.
Toni smiled, tucking her face into her lover's neck, relaxing her body against the smaller man. She quickly pulled back when she felt something awfully familiar pressed against her hip. She glanced down at the tent in Steve’s pants, an even bigger smile growing on her face at how she easily excited her man.
Toni smiled as she watched him swallow down his water, the way his throat bobbed, and how he licked his lips. His tongue grabbing the missed water droplets off his bottom lip after placing the water down on the table. God, even half the size Steve was still fucking gorgeous. The sunkenness of his cheekbones. The brightness of his beautiful blue eyes. His slender frame was as beautiful as his broad shoulders. Two very different looks. But, both equally beautiful.
“Your wish is my command.” Steve flashed her a wide smile and then followed her down the hallway, flashlights in hand as they made their way to the supply closet.
After a minute of just the bigger man's shaky breaths, he began to speak
“What on God’s green earth is in that book?” Jarvis asked Natasha.
“What?” Clint asked, looking around the room for answers - confusion clear in his eyes.
The blond shook his head in disbelief at these so-called parents and shouted: “Who says that about their own daughter?!”
“The life this team leads..” Steve turned his attention to the older British man as he sat on the sofa watching Stephen Strange hover in mid-air. The doctor's head twisting and turning as he searched the multiverses using the time stone, looking for their resident genius.
Toni smiled as she took in the painting in front of her. A painted version of her and Steve kissing on a white, wooden bridge. His arms wrapped around her waist as she was dressed in navy blue, a-line dress from the ’30s.
Neither man
“You heard the lady.”

“Nay, the couple must be selected by the king. Both must be close to perfect specimens and share some history,” Thor informed them. “For a short period of time, Odin did not enforce the shared history but found it was more pleasing if the pairs had a level of chemistry. That be hatred or love.”
The next couple of days that passed were bitter-sweet. The couple spent every waking moment together. They made all their meals together, stayed up late almost every night playing cards or making out on the couch just to gross Bucky out. Steve would take Toni out most evenings for a walk or maybe to see a film.
“Toni, I’ve watched you start a fire with just two batteries in your hands. This... This is nothing.”
“This way,” Fury led them into the elevator, Bucky and Clint following close behind.
At first, all they saw was a green puff of smoke and heard the sinister-sounding voice throughout the room. But then the trickster god showed his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Down Pa, he’s just a punk sometimes.” Bucky muttered, smiling at the Rogers family. Sarah and Joseph turned to face Bucky in shock.
“Ugh, duh. I wanna fly and shoot stuff but be protected by all that metal! You’re like the greatest Avenger.”
Gone was her Steve and here was The Captain.
Toni pulled him into the living room, grinning from ear to ear. She let go of Bucky’s hands and ran over to the white sheet that covered some large object.
“That’s lovely, that’s everything he ever dreamed of.” Sarah whispered, as Joseph pulled her into his embrace. “Well, that and a lot of kids.”
“Go away!” Steve laughed, reaching one hand out, chucking a pile of loose paper at the shorter blond.
“Shut up, Rogers,” Toni muttered, biting back her smile.
That she never got to say goodbye, she never got to thank him.
“Well, Miss. Grant.” He placed the white envelope in Toni’s hands, a soft smile gracing his face. “Have a wonderful rest of your day. I will call if your services are needed again.”
“I can’t do it, Antonia. I can’t lose
Daniel and Von Doom stood to their feet, smiles on their lips as they made their way across the dark green rug, over to Toni.
Steve watched Toni swallow down her next words, his gaze running down Steve’s neck, taking in the sight of the wide expanse of his shoulders. Steve felt the air leave his chest as her hands ran painfully slow up his abdomen, meeting the other around his neck. Pulling the bigger man impossibly closer.
He had been sitting at his desk, drinking some instant shit Clint had found in the back of a cabinet when the phone at the front desk rang, and rang, and rang.
“Ah, right. And does he still want to be a doctor like his old man?” Werner asked.
She had to have heard that wrong.
(See the end of the chapter for
Reality sank in, as Toni was stuck in what she assumed was the late 1930’s without any kind of identification or money. She had absolutely nothing to her name, except the clothes on her back and the shoes on her feet.
hand, dance down the front of her dress. Running delicately over the lace, teasing Steve with every single movement.
“Sam, Clint, and Thor!” Steve shouted, eager to get the attention off of him.
Steve couldn’t help but smile at two of his best friends. A small tinge of jealousy ran through his veins at their interaction. But Steve knew he was Toni’s favorite, she had told him that one night in the lab many, many months ago.
“What?” Toni asked. “I didn’t say anything!”
Comment and kudos are always appreciated!!! Can't wait to update the next chapter of the love birds at the MoMA!!
Steve drew his bottom lip between his teeth as he watched the blood red, painted fingernails of his
“Well... With you..” He thought for a second, looking to the ceiling, then turned his eyes back to Toni. “Eight.” and with that, his cheeks blushed ruby red.
This room seemed completely normal, tones of brown and white, with emerald green accents here and there. A large brown couch sat in the middle of the room, a couple of green chairs opposite it, as a coffee table rested between them. A large green rug covering most of the brown hardwood floor. Toni wasn’t sure what it was about this man or his house. But he was one of the strangest guys she’d ever met, and that says a lot coming from Toni Stark.
Ta da!!! It's wedding time!!!! So, finally - here comes the bride!!
“Nuh un.”
He turned to Maria, hoping Toni’s mother would jump to her daughter's defense. But Steve just watched as she turned her attention to the shield issued table that rested in front of her.
Toni smirked, as she looked at the younger blond. Johnny never failed to flirt with her no matter the present company. Mid battle with aliens, middle of a conference at SHIELD, or even at a dinner with the Avengers. That man's first instinct was to flirt with Toni, and she didn’t hate it either.
There was Nebula and Thor, they were from Norway or somewhere over there. Thor loved to talk, and when he did it was like the man's voice was always amplified. Whereas Nebula was very quiet and got her work done.
“What’s that, doll?”
“A guy’s night?” The assassin asked as she and Bruce made their way into the kitchen.
“And what is it Antonia has you believing about her? That she grew up under the horrible Howard Stark? That I was such an awful man? Maybe, that she’s a genius and has it all put together. ‘Saves the world’ all by herself, that bullshit?”
All those years of wishing for one moment to finally tell Howard Stark what a piece of shit he was. To tell him he didn’t break her, and that she was worth more than anything he ever made.
“Toni...” He whispered, her brown eyes fluttering open as she smiled at him.
“You two lovebirds are so precious.” She whispered, applying some ointment to the newly cleaned gash on Toni’s cheek.
“Who told you what that meant?” Toni asked, shooting Clint a glare from the corner of her eye.
“Aren't you hurt?” Toni raised her eyebrow, concerned for the man's physical wounds. Not wanting to jostle his injured ribs.
“Howard,” Steve spat. “I just need to know what date you last remember, and you can go home.”
“Enjoy that, doll. I would say buy yourself something pretty, but..” Daniel shrugged his shoulders, saying: “That’s a bit sexiest. You should buy what you’ll enjoy.” Toni smiled up at the taller man, wrapping her arm around his waist.
“Sorry, I didn't want anyone to interrupt us.” Toni told them, smiling as she pulled her phone out of her pocket. “Yes, we found Steve. Alive.”
“Your brother is nothing but trouble.” She got nothing but reassuring beeps from her helper bots. They took off across the room and began doing their own, much smaller happy circles inside of Dum-E’s.
“It’s been a long day,” Steve muttered, raking his fingers through his messy blond locks. “Can we just go to bed and try this tomorrow.”
. I don’t know why you keep doing this. I love Stev-” it was that instant Toni made eye contact with the smaller blond. Her eyes immediately lost the fierceness she had just a second ago when she had looked at Bucky. Instead, a wave of sadness rushed over them as she locked eyes with the smaller blond.
Each canvas filled with the same subject.
“You as well, Steve Rogers...”
Neither he nor Toni had brought up the moment Coulson interrupted, or the whole him licking her finger as she fed him Starbursts. Steve sure as hell hadn’t mentioned that, but that didn’t mean others in the office didn’t. It seemed whenever Toni wasn’t in earshot someone was making a comment about Steve finally confessing his feelings for the receptionist. Coulson was rooting for Steve, saying something about how he already made them tee shirts that said. “I’m in love with a receptionist” and “I’m in love with a salesman.”
“How?” Toni asked, standing to her feet, arms crossed over her chest as she walked over the chaotic couple. “How did this happen?”
“Thank you, sir. A pleasure to work on such a beautiful piece.” Toni told him, smiling as Daniel grabbed the tool bag from her hands.
“I’m not naked!” Toni told him, as laughter left the team's lips. Steve froze, looking Toni’s almost naked form up and down. The heat from his blue gaze had goose bumps forming on Toni’s exposed skin.
“You are indeed my favorite Midgardian,” Loki murmured, looking the genius’ body up and down.
“Thank you?” Toni asked, unsure of what their next step was. Daniel held back a snort at Toni’s tone and knocked on the large wooden door.
“I would never.” Steve lifted up the empty trash bag to see if she had hidden them at the bottom of the trash can. “How dare you accuse me of something so scandalous, Antonia.”
Toni was right, magic fucking sucked.
“Alright, let’s talk about something other than what Bucky’s packing..” Steve interjected.
“Toni, I got your parents instead. It was a total fucking failure.” Toni smiled and placed a kiss on the taller man's cheek.
Steve stuttered; his hand dropped to his chest in shock.
“Toni, doll. You could never, you’re our daughter.” Joseph said, smiling as he wrapped his arm around his son's shoulders. “You’re family.”
Steve flipped his genius onto her back and sealed their lips together in a kiss.
I will be updating tomorrow!! I won't leave y'all to stew on this!! But, as I was going over the chapter I was like.. hmm I feel like being evil and wanted to leave a small cliffhanger hehe.
And with that Steve stood up from his seat, walking across the kitchen floor as the fully grown, enhanced-super heroes continued their arguments of ‘Nuh uh’ and ‘Yeah huh’. Steve wrapped his arms around the genius’s waist and threw her over his shoulder. A shriek leaving her lips as her face, yet again collided with her supersoldier muscular back.
“What blonde girl?” Steve questioned, making Toni quickly shake her head.
Steve forgot his surroundings as he smiled back into those beautiful brown eyes he loved so much. Having Toni’s face so close to his, her nose a couple of inches from his own. So, close he could see the small freckles that danced across her nose, even under the makeup.
“Oh, why is he here?” Steve grumbled, his hand lowering on Toni’s back.
“I can’t lose you, Antonia.
“Danny, you’ve got me all these jobs. You have to let me pay you back somehow.”
Steve turned away from the pathetic man curled up on the floor, and pointed his gaze toward Maria Stark, asking one more time.
“Get the information and get out. Howard is gonna go back to the past where he belongs, never to bother anyone ever again.” His brother told him, placing his metal and flesh hand on Steve’s shoulders. Doing his best to center Steve away from his anger and panic. “I know you wanna kill him, we all would give anything for a shot at Howard. But we can’t, you’re getting married.”
“Sounds good, Buck.” Just as Steve’s hand reached out for the doorknob, Bucky hollered: “Please use protection. I don’t need a mini Toni and Steve running ‘round here. Golly, I don’t even wanna imagine how stubborn that kid is gonna be.”
They made their way up to the admissions booth that sat in the lobby of the Heckscher Building. Approaching the stand Toni noticed the way the man was looking at Steve, with a glare of: ‘He doesn't belong here.’
“Where ya going, doll?”
“Steve, you kissed me, you made love to me, you
“Now come on, let’s fix this machine and get Howard Stark the fuck out of here.”
“Right," Steve pulled his hand away from Toni’s and stood to his feet.
“Shut up, you idiot.”
“We should head back. Buck will kill me if you get sick.” Toni whispered, squeezing his hand tighter. Steve nodded his head as his eyes caught an older couple selling flowers across the street. He had a buck in his pocket but he knew exactly what he was gonna spend it on.
The brunette flashed her fiancé a soft smile and she tightened her grip on his forearm. Knowing by the gaze of his blue eyes she wasn’t fooling him. Steve could read her like a book and could see the turmoil her heart and mind were trudging through.
“I like this one.” Teenage Bucky smirked. He looked just like the pictures Steve had of him. Short brown, sculpted hair, and a cleanly defined jawline.
Steve met Erskine and went off the Bootcamp. He met Peggy and noticed how much she reminded him of Toni. She was smart and confident, just like Steve’s girl was and he thought maybe they could have had something. But, he knew he couldn’t, she wasn’t Toni. Peggy was so formal and put together and she didn’t have that quick wit, that sass that was just so.. Toni.
“Clothes? What clothes?” Steve grunted as he stood to his feet. He shucked his shirt, pants, and boxers off his body - letting them fall, forgotten to the floor.
“Of course I do, I love him.” She told him like it was the one true thing she knew in her life and if Toni was being honest; her love for Steve and his love for her was the only thing she really knew she could depend on. “You don’t kiss your best friend's girl! Everyone knows that, James!”
.” A tear tracked its way down her cheek. “You gave me a family.”
“Come on, Toni,” Bucky panted, pulling out her chair for Toni to sit down. “I needa breather.”
“Steven, this is beautiful.”
Toni made her way out of the apartment, holding the ticket in her hands. She took a deep breath and opened their apartment door, to reveal a pacing Steve Rogers.
“Steve go in, fuck whatever the protocol is. These are your parents, say goodbye the right way.” Toni whispered, kissing the lone tear off her fiancé’s cheek.
“Amazing, she’s amazing.” He told Toni’s mother, not being able to stop the smile that graced his lips.
“Well, he’s a prick,” Edwin stated, causing the whole room to bust out in laughter at the older man's choice of words.
“Behind the scenes?” Sam asked.
“Good, good.” Howard said, taking a seat down beside Maria.  “Well, the future doesn’t sound too bad then.”
“Meh, so far away.”
“Yeah, Toni is Steve’s favorite. He doesn’t get to decide.” Bucky told them.
“‘A good man will do anything for his woman, especially a Rogers.’” Toni quoted her fiancé, watching the proud smile that grew on Joe’s lips.
“I’m right here. Why can’t you just ask me?”
“You sure? Because I don’t think you do.”
genius’s lips.
“Debat -”
“Can someone tell me again how we got roped into Comic-Con?” Sam muttered as half the team of the Avengers was gathered backstage, as they waited for their names to be called for a Q&A session. “We aren’t comic book characters; we are real-life superheroes!”
“Toni, Toni Grant. Nice to meet you.” The older man took in the brunette's appearance and nodded his head.
“No time, gotta save the world, Potts.”
“Steve told me to save the blue for the honeymoon.”
“What? I’m just sayin’...”
“Toni! Just the dame I was looking for. There is a man on the phone asking for ya, says his name is Stephen Strange. That sound familiar?” Steve must have noticed Toni’s reaction to the name because he left his spot at the door walking over to his genius, a concerned look covering his face.
“Take me to the bedroom?” A breathless whisper fell off her lips as Steve stalked his way over to her, pushing her body against the wall.
“Yeah, come on in,” Toni responded, sitting up in Steve’s bed as she straightened out the covers around her body. The bigger man walked through the door, holding what Toni assumed was a cup of tea.
me - ” Toni smiled, watching his eyes grow in satisfaction as he heard the words leave her lips. “- Way before I went back to the '30s. You got me, Steve. I’m

“You’re a terrible liar, Stevie.,” Bucky snorted.

“Yes, sir.” She responded walking over to his side of their bed.
She dropped his hand back down to his side, as a smile appeared on her own lips.
The couple laid there for another fifteen minutes. Toni smiled proudly as she was finally breaking the Steve Rogers code. She was finally learning the hidden secrets of her man's heart. Steve was smiling because of the weight that was finally leaving his chest. The weight he didn’t even know he was carrying until Toni took it from him.
Toni looked up at her fiancé and reminded him. “He didn’t kiss me before you did..”
“You’re alright, I promise,” Steve whispered, reassuringly. “We’ll keep ya safe here.”
“Howard.” Toni shrugged. “He had your whole apartment tucked away in the mansion, safely preserved. You guys got most of it back in 2012. But, nobody gave you the furniture because well... It’s old.”
“What? What’s wrong? Did I rush this?” Panic wide in her brown eyes. “Steve, are you not comfortable?”
smile made Steve wanna smash him around on the floor just like Hulk did.
“Yeah?” Steve asked, straightening the cuffs on his jacket.
“No, I quite like bothering you.”

“With what?” Steve asked, frustration clear in his voice. “The power’s out. You can’t do anything!”
He shouted, grabbing Clint by the hand, tugging him down the hall and into the elevator.
“Don’t you
Toni’s feet stopped in the doorway as she watched Daniel leave the living room, mindlessly almost.
“What the fuck did I miss?” Toni asked, and four sets of eyes turned to face her.
“Clinton, why so hostile?”
Steve looked into the black phone, down at his feet, and then whipped the chair around. A smile broke out on his lips as Toni was standing right in front of her desk, setting eight coffee cups on the wooden surface. Looking absolutely perfect in a pocket, black tee-shirt, and simple blue jeans.
“So... You fixed the heater huh?” Bucky interjected. Toni nodded her head, as she chewed another mouth full of noodles.
“Here, Captain.”
The feeling of his warm palm on her lower back, holding her tight to his chest as she felt his thumb rubbing small circles on her skin - snapped her out of her shock.
“Good, mutual feelings are important.” The brunette smiled and asked: “What is it you wanted to show me?”
“Yes, my parents were both Irish.” Steve laughed as Toni continued looking at him, appalled.
“No, I live in a tower with children,” Steve said, with a smile as he looked around the room at some of the people that had become his found family.
“I can’t tell you guys that. Sorry, kids.”
“I’m so proud of you son. Not just for… saving the world or risking your life…” Joseph turned and looked at Toni. “But for finding a good woman, for treating her right...” He smiled back at Steve and whispered. “And for letting her treat you like you deserve as well. Steven, I couldn’t have asked for a better son... or a better daughter-in-law.”
“You know I don’t want Bucky right?” She whispered, feeling the bigger man sigh against the sensitive skin on her neck.
“It’s only thirty-five cents, doll."
He shouted. His tone dropped dark as he let an angry growl rip from his throat. The dam had burst and there was no going back from this.
“What’s going on?” He asked, throwing a questioning look back to Steve and Clint.
“I’m not afraid of you, Howard. Not anymore.” Toni took a step closer, closing the gap between them as she slightly looked up at her ‘father’.
After dancing through six straight songs - Bucky was pulling Toni back to the table, begging the dame to take a breath.
” Toni whispered back in Italian.
“You’re perfect,” Toni whispered as Steve began placing kisses down her neck. Leaving a trail of bruises down her bare chest, marking her as his wherever his lips touched.
“Please, Stephen, I’m a gorgeous woman, of course, you enjoyed the show.”
“Answer her.” They heard a muffled Bucky, and then a quiet ‘ow.’
“We both know that’s a lie.” Howard laughed right in her face. “You’d be nothing without me, Antonia.”
“Bed in a minute.” He groaned, finally removing her shirt from her shoulders, his hands going to unbutton her soft, brown pleated pants.
” Her hands ran down the front of his clothed chest. “Someone should really remedy this.”
“You are,” Sarah muttered and began pulling Toni over to the group hug.
Steve had parents that loved him, Steve had the parents Toni always dreamed of.
“Okay, okay,” she whispered. “I promise, you can die first.”
Toni couldn’t help it, she nodded her head, trying to hold back the tears that formed in her brown eyes.
Steve pulled Toni to his chest and placed a kiss on her forehead. “Never Pa, she’s mine.”
Toni pulled his glasses back up his nose with her fingertips like she always did. Smiling wider as she looked into his breath-taking blue eyes. Their faces slowly inching closer, both completely lost in the moment of the other in their embrace...
“Take off your shirt,” the brunette stated, her brown eyes glowing with lust.
“I’m out for the day, Jeremy. Avengers’ emergency!”
“Can ya at least tell us what he looks like?” And with that Steve’s shoulders perked up, and he lifted his blue gaze to Natasha’s.
“Toni... Doll, my heart can’t handle much more.” The smaller man placed one of his hands over his heart as his breathing began to pick up. Toni smiled at the blond as she pulled her pants and black pantyhose to the floor. Seeing the same reaction she always got back home from her Steve as his lips slightly parted, his tongue sweeping across his bottom lips as he took in the sight of her beautiful hips, and ran his searing gaze down her almost naked form.
“I’m not freaked out, Stevie. I would love to have a baby with you, one day.” She told him, pulling the smaller man up her body and into a kiss.
Toni cried silent sobs as she clung to the love of her life.
“Oh shut up, I’ve heard the gossip around the tower. And you, Steven Rogers, are the king of dirty talk. Well, so says a little spider.” Steve glanced at his fianceé, who rested in his lap watching as the grin grow on her face.
“I don’t think your possessive man ever left. From what I remember Steve almost killed Clint in the kitchen,” Sam informed them, through crunches of cereal.
“We do have chairs,” Steve reminded the younger man.
Toni turned away from the older man and saw Steve with the biggest grin she’d ever seen on his face. Pride bubbling in his chest as his blue eyes were filled with awe.
She heard a series of *
“I didn’t know you hung out in the supply closet; I would have stopped in way sooner.”
“Fifty bucks? Where does he go?”
“Can I look at these tomorrow?” Toni muttered from Steve’s shoulder. “Can we go snuggle?”
“Listen to your father and leave us alone!” Toni shouted, laughter leaving all four of their lips.
“Yeah, that still worries me. What aren’t you telling me? Do I need to remind you who created you?”

“No, Howard.” Not a doubt of uncertainty in her voice as she finally stood up to her piece of shit father. “I did that all by myself.”
” Toni spoke.
“Okay look, I fixed the heater and took a shower. But, then there was a knock on the door and he said he was your neighbor. So, I opened the door and he assumed I was James’ girlfriend because his nosey wife saw you carrying me here last night!” The words poured from the woman's mouth, like water out of a fountain. Steve couldn't help it as he and Bucky both grinned as she explained the events of her day. “He then asked about the heater and how you got it fixed! And I told him I did it, and then he asked me if I would look at theirs, and his wife would make us dinner. James, Steve I’m
way, we are
“I’m sorry... The people of Asgard just watch two people fuck in the middle of the palace?” Sam asked, taking a seat beside the god.
“They’ll be beautiful, and very stubborn too. Don’t let Steven lie to you, he was always getting into trouble as a kid.” Joseph told her, a fond smile on his lips.
“Wait! Woah! Get back here!” Toni turned to the older man.
“What company? Where did you send her?” Steve shouted, feeling Bucky and Sam pulling on his shoulders to keep him from lunging after the god again. “
,” he whispered.
“Hell yeah, I’m a whole meal.”
As they sat Steve back down on the couch a dry cough began leaving his throat. “Sorry, got a bit too excited.” Bucky sat down beside Steve, patting the smaller man's back like he’d done it a billion times before.

“Toni?” He asked, looking up at his dame, his lips still placing kisses around her hips.
“Breath, Stevie,” Toni said softly, laying her hand down on the smaller man's. He nodded his head, bringing his left hand to his chest. “What can I do?” She asked softly, watching as he tried to regain his breath.
“She did
Elisa told Steve about sharing a bed with Bucky and he immediately agreed, saying Toni needed her rest. So, after Elisa looked over and bandaged both the boys, they said goodnight. Daniel and Elisa pulled Steve out with them, saying something about letting the love birds say goodnight, the blond just faked a smile and begrudgingly followed the older couple out the door to finish off his soup.
“Miss Stark?” He asked, confusion flowing through his blue eyes.
Making her way back into Steve’s room she couldn’t help but be nosy and opened the one wooden chest that sat on the floor of his bedroom. The only furniture in his room was a bed with a dark blue blanket covering the off-white sheets, a dark brown side table, and a chestnut-colored chest.
“For science,” Steve and Bucky replied with a laugh on their lips.
“Sorry, Sam,” Steve apologized and went right back to kissing his fiancée.
“Yes ma’am,” Steve responded to the dame’s demand and pulled his half unbuttoned shirt off his shoulders.
Toni spent the next ten minutes of the cab ride chatting with the driver. Asking him about his day, his life and so on as Steve sat awkwardly in his seat, taking in the car around him - this had been his first-ever ride in a taxi cab.
Steve shouted, raising his hands into the air, for the god to stop talking about fucking Toni. “Let’s stop talking about making love to Toni
“And me?” Sam smiled.
“Yep.” Steve popped his lips and fiddled with the graphite pencil in his hands, still looking down at the wooden table beneath his arms.
“Oh, right… Miss Toni, do ya need any help?” Bucky asked instead, placing his hands in his jean pockets.
Steve opened the front door, revealing their neighbor, Daniel.
“I don’t remember,” he told her softly, watching the smile that grew upon her lips.
“Sounds great, doll. Come on, Stevie, let's get our jackets on.”
Daniel sat the bag of tools at Toni’s feet and placed a kiss on her temple.
He heard the smooth voice of his best friend over the line. Steve hid his blush, tucking the phone between his shoulder and chin as his hands began to dig through Toni’s drawers, looking for the pink Starbursts she always hid from him.
Steve looked back to Toni, noticing she was dressed in one of his white shirts and a pair of his sweatpants, that hugged her thick thighs perfectly. Well or so he thought. Steve couldn’t help the possessive feeling growing in his chest as he saw Toni dressed in his clothes. Knowing she had the option of his or Bucky’s and she chose Steve’s. Much like how she chose to grab Steve’s arm. For
Her words had finally meant something to her pathetic excuse for a father.
“I don’t care who ya are! You do
“Well, that kept him alive. He was... Well, I guess suspended in the ice until we had the technology to find the ship. Steve is healthy, and happy... I think.” Toni nodded her head softly, her fingers softly resting over the engagement ring on her finger.
"Buck!” Steve whispered to the bigger man, “Don’t say things like that.” He pulled a worn, brown leather jacket across his narrow shoulders.
“I accept that.” Steve chuckled. “I can’t pull a mustache off quite as he can.”
Steve wanted to answer that question so bad, he wanted to say ‘yes, of course. I’d date her, I’d marry her. I’d do anything in the world to keep her happy.’
“Clint, no.” Steve held his empty hand out.
“He’s got a crush on Toni. Thinks she’s engaged to you,” Sam pointed out, using his half-eaten slice of pizza to point at the god.
Steve rolled his eyes as he watched Thor jamming random buttons on the already broken printer. The bigger man completely ignored Clint’s bright orange
“Yeah,” Bucky chuckled, as he sat down on the other side of Toni. “Who’s dating who, ya know personal questions like that.”
“Bring it on, stretchy.”
“Toni is my mechanic and many more things.”
Steve was fighting every urge in his body to reach across this table and knock Howard Stark out. Seeing how meek and submissive he had made his wife from years and years of abuse. The way her eyes never made contact with Steve’s as she spoke, her hands staying love in her lap, her shoulders dropped, and head hung. Steve’s mind was imagining that this was exactly how Toni acted around the older man and that made Steve wanna rip the bastard's head from his shoulders.
Thank you for reading!!! I have loved this story so much and it was so bitter sweet posting the final chapter!! Please scream and cry at me in the comments!!
“Is that a fact?” Toni asked, watching the confidant air grow in her fiancé.
“I don’t know many Midgardian celebrities, so, I will just say our lady Stark as she is a truly beautiful human.”
