They didn’t speak for a long moment. Sherlock was gently cradling away Rosie’s resistance; and John, well, John was mulling. Mulling Sherlock’s appearance, mulling his words. Mulling the fact that he looked a little sad, especially when he thought John couldn’t see his face.
“Why what?”
Mrs Hudson spared them both the embarrassment of responding to
They sat in silence for a few moments. John was watching the few patrons lurking outside in the chill air, pretending he could see himself among them, beer in hand, laughing insincerely at old jokes he’d heard and made before. Enjoying it.
John smiled at his persistence. “No. We had our moment, and we missed it.”
Molly’s smile was a little sad, but John didn’t detect any wistfulness in it. “I’ll always love Sherlock,” she said, and the way she said it made it sound somehow pure and innocent. “But he’s never loved me in the same way, and he never will. And that’s okay,” she forestalled John’s false assurances.
He and Rosie got back home around eight, both of them edging into “tired and therefore cranky” territory. His flat was on the first floor; between Rosie, the stairs, their bags and his complaining knees, John was almost to the flat’s door before he noticed something awry.
“I’m not high!” he snapped, when John opened his mouth to ask.
war and earned some distinction for doing what he’d always been doing in one form or another anyway.
John felt a feeling an awful lot like “acceptance” settle in his gut as he watched Sherlock do something John had seen him do a million times before. The video evoked such a clear feeling of “home” that John knew, watching Sherlock swirl something noxious looking around a glass vial, that he’d do everything to make sure this – this video – wasn’t the only way for him to still
The camera pans to the door, where a slight, dark-haired man has stuck his head in. But as soon as he sees the cameras his head disappears again. Molly follows his “Sorry, sorry!” from the room, leaving the crew alone with a suddenly unhappy-looking DI.
“How’d you do it?” John wanted to know, resigned, amused, beleaguered.
“You’ve called pubs ‘cesspools of filth’ within my hearing twice,” John pointed out, amused despite himself and Sherlock’s snobbery.
John’s eyes flew open, catching Sherlock on the retreat, ducking
“Do you trust me?” Sherlock interrupted him. His eyes flicked between John’s own.
. A set of car keys had materialised in his hand. An Aston Martin logo keychain dangled prominently from them. Sherlock was grinning, half-naughty school child, half incorrigible demon. “I’ve organised transport.”
“So why then?”
“That’s—wow,” John said before he could stop himself. He regretted it instantly. He bit his lip and glanced around, but no one was paying him any mind.
“So what’s going on? You look...” In her kindness, Molly didn’t finish the sentence.
Or teaching him to control his temper issues, but whatever.
“What the hell are you doing?” John asked him, trying – and failing – to keep the anger out of his voice. Rosie stirred unhappily in his arms.
“Dangerous?” John tried not to take it personally. He knew Sherlock helped out Mycroft more often now; Mycroft and his government friends. Although perhaps “allies” was the better word.
John frowned, scooping sweet and sour pork onto their plates. It took a moment to click. The lab on that winter day felt very, very far from where they were now, John dishing up food while Sherlock entertained his daughter.
Maybe, he thought, switching off the kitchen light and getting ready for bed – maybe ignoring his feelings for Sherlock wouldn’t be so difficult. He could find other things to preoccupy him. And the loneliness, shitty as it was, was great creative fuel for his channel.
“You’re the best man that I know,” John told him simply. It had been true the first time he’d said it, and John found that he still meant it, still believed it.
“You don’t have anywhere you need to be,” Sherlock said. “Why the rush to get there, then?”
John skipped the tobacco ash video and scrolled through the others, finally deciding on one featuring their old mantelpiece skull. To John’s disappointment, it was a no-talking video, and the only parts of Sherlock that were visible were his hands. The camera was positioned above the surface of Sherlock’s desk. Sherlock spent the better part of a half hour tapping, scratching and scritching various parts and planes of the skull, turning it around delicately and, honestly, hypnotically, in his large hands. He alternated harder sounds with softer and deeper ones. John could faintly hear his breathing.
“You really aren’t.”
, John thought.
“Dull,” the man complained. The line rattled like he was moving around on the other end. After a moment the noise settled.
– the dreadful loneliness of longing for someone who would never be within your reach. “He’s Sherlock,” he added, with a shrug, like that explained everything. Maybe it did, maybe it didn’t, but John knew Molly would understand.
, he could hear Sherlock sneer in his head and yeah, had this been anyone other than Sherlock, John would assume he was being flirted with,
It was crowded and noisy inside. John scrummed through to the bar counter, losing sight of Sherlock in the process, but he had the car keys so he at least knew Sherlock would have to come find him. It took five minutes to get a drink order in, and then another five for it to arrive. John pinged his interest off one or two women while he waited, but he wasn’t committed enough to pursue it. Had it been five years ago, he thought, he would have been well on his way to a late night and a phone number by now.
John watched Sherlock disembark and then do a slow, casual about-turn on the pavement, presumably taking in the night. He sighed again. “Shit,” he muttered, and got out, following Sherlock’s lean form into the pub.
Sherlock hesitated, then: “Yes. And important. I...have to solve it.”
“What, John?” Sherlock’s voice was husky. He finished sliding out of his jacket and discarded it on the couch, his eyes moving deliberately over John’s body. He started unbuckling his belt.
John couldn’t lie, he felt chuffed with himself, but he at least had the wherewithal to feel silly in equal measure.
else.
down John’s spine. Fear, certainly, but also...relief? Sherlock still needed him. That was...nice. It wasn’t enough, but if it was all he could get...
Sherlock paced, avoiding his eyes. The more John saw of him, the more frazzled he looked. John’s stomach dropped, right past anger, frustration and into despair.
“I hope I’m not interrupting,” she said by way of greeting.
“A ‘consulting detective’?” the producer queries.
In his mind’s eye, John saw Sherlock finally acting on the advice he, John, had given him all those months ago. John had been referring to Irene when he’d told Sherlock not to let love pass him by. It hadn’t occurred to him that, maybe, after all this time, it might actually be
It is immediately obvious that Sherlock Holmes is off his head on pain medication.
with that.
It felt natural, then, to close the distance between their bodies and their lips. Suddenly it didn’t matter that John was dressed only in pyjamas – it meant less distance between him and Sherlock. For a few, long moments, there was nothing but exploratory kisses, the slide of tongue and lips, the gentle press of their bodies against the other. John had one hand buried in Sherlock’s hair; Sherlock’s palms had found the skin of his back beneath his t-shirt.
But Sherlock surprised him by saying, “No.” He stared off into the middle-distance before appearing to snap out of it. He pocketed his hands in his coat and bounced his eyes around the room, frowning. “I tried,” he explained, sounding distracted, even nervous. “Truly. I thought about it every way I can. I...”
She’s right, so Greg affably pulls ranks. “Thought we could use some help on this one.” He explains it half to Sally, half to the camera. Only one is now focused on him: the other follows the tall man’s rapid progress around the room. “You know, show off the many talents New Scotland Yard bring together under one--”
“So what?” asked John, nonplussed. He ducked a few bites of his own meal before an unhappy squeak from Rosie directed him back to hers.
awake, telling her stuffed animals all about her dreams, I’m sure.” Sherlock’s face and voice were soft. John grinned at this, but then ducked his eyes, embarrassed, hoping Sherlock hadn’t caught it.
Forty-four-years old and turned on by a whisper! John thought blackly, but even as he thought it, he knew that wasn’t quite it – wasn’t quite
“Oh, so it’s okay if
“I don’t—there really isn’t—I think we should—oh, Jim!”
, but he was okay in a way that suggested he would have some sort of emotional collapse in the future, but not just at the moment, thanks. The situation was far from perfect and probably untenable, but it was
John was glad for the cold because it pretty much stopped the hot flush of embarrassment and horror dead in its tracks.
“He consults,” John says, perfectly serious, “as a detective.”
yells DI Dimmock.
John posted it and shut his laptop before he could succumb to the temptation to sit around hitting “Refresh”. Instead, he pulled out his tablet and his clamshell earphones, making sure Rosie’s baby monitor was on and facing him on the coffee table before he picked one of Sherlock’s ASMR videos. He settled back on the couch and stabbed “play”.
“I was clearly wrong,” Sarah said settling down opposite him. “You’re doing great. Really.”
Sherlock had started on Rosie’s bottle by the time she and John emerged. He was a dab hand at it too, which made John feel happy in a very unsettling sort of way. John gratefully accepted the bottle and carried Rosie back to the sofa, Sherlock trailing behind with their cups.
Sherlock was still moving around with Rosie, whose tears had subsided into sleepy amazement at her favourite uncle. “I can’t say much about it,” Sherlock hedged.
“It really isn’t,” John insisted.
Sarah laughed and did so. “This was unnecessary, but thanks,” she said.
“What about you?” John asked, clearing his throat. The question knocked the wind right of our Sherlock’s sails: his mouth clicked shut and he frowned, casting John a puzzled and somewhat suspicious look.
When the air between them grew heated again, John might have been tempted to disregard his earlier wisdom. But this time it was Sherlock who pulled back, but only so he could settle himself on John’s chest. John closed his arms around him. It was...something else, to have this man in his embrace.
the words out of his mouth. That fear was back, that somehow Sherlock would hear “ASMR” and immediately deduce that lonely, empty hole inside John and how John wished in some inexpressible way that
It was on a cold evening in February that John finally confronted Sherlock. Sherlock was “thinking”, his head on a pillow on John’s lap. They were on the sofa. It was late and cosy. Rosie was asleep upstairs. A fire crackled in the grate.
Sherlock shrugged off his coat and threw it over the back of the armchair he usually occupied, but rather than sit, he walked around the place, like he hadn’t been there a million times and taken in its increasingly chaotic glory before.
That got a laugh from John. He wouldn’t have thought, back when it happened, that he would be able to laugh about that time; yet here they were. Still, John would be lying if he pretended the cuts didn’t still bleed from time to time.
“Then how’d you know all that? About—being unattached?” John couldn’t help a furtive look around like Harry was about to pop out from behind a pillar demanding to know why he hadn’t returned any of her thirteen phone calls.
“You enjoyed that,” Sherlock remarked from the passenger seat. They’d pulled into a parking ahead of a Honda, but not even the Soho crowd’s cussing could drown out John’s temporary moment of bliss. The Governor’s Duck was a hive of activity on the corner, but John could have cared less.
This appears to perplex Sherlock no end. He looks around at them all – John, Greg, Molly, a pixellated corner, and the producer and her camera crew – before a look of horror crosses his face.
“Uh, I was just watching YouTube videos,” John said. This wasn’t a lie, but John suddenly felt self-conscious. The original forum thread about ASMR had been filled with comments from people who either thought it was a weird fetish thing and those who swore there wasn’t anything sexy about it. John honestly didn’t know what to think. It hadn’t
“There you are.” To John’s surprise, this came out more relieved than annoyed. Sherlock’s head snapped up.
John patted his face dry. He felt... Well, not better. But emptier. Like some of the murk had been washed from his soul.
oversleep. She did ask,” Sherlock added, with an unconvincing look of innocence, “if you had taken her advice. What does a fellow doctor prescribe for insomnia?” Sherlock wondered.
And if he wept a little before he fell asleep... Well. No one was there to see it, anyway.
“I hate flowers,” Sarah said cheerfully. “Please, sit down. Hold on.” She disappeared around a corner and returned a second later, lugging a high chair. “I’d been meaning to get rid of it since Susan’s kids are grown, which means it’s sat in the hallway for two years.”
how he’d deduced this. “I don’t
But there were so many other memories, of course.
And if there had been any doubt about it, any doubt at all, it was dispelled the next moment when a deep voice rumbled, “Today we’ll be considering a favourite topic of mine. Tobacco,” Sherlock said, moving to speak into what John assumed was off-screen microphones to the left and right, “ash. Forty-three different kinds of it...”
“How about tonight?” Sarah suggested brightly. “I’ll make us dinner. Yeah?”
“No, do go on, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock implored. It sounded like he was smiling. “I have your surname and your cell number already, but any more detail you’d like to provide...”
of the poop-filled nappy in the bin.
Molly smiled. “No, I just... You can ask, you know. I’d prefer it if you did, actually.”
“Am I dead?” he clutches at John.
, and it kept Rosie and him warm, fed, clean, dressed and going about their business.
Sherlock looked at him then, a searching look that finally resolved itself in a little nod. “Yes, we do,” he agreed, accepting his plate and scooping up a bite his fork.
“We can stay if you want.” Sherlock said this with a manner of resolve that would befit much graver situations, like volunteering to take the One Ring to Mount Doom.
Sherlock eventually decided to delete his channel; John didn’t. He made a steady stream of videos, each title starting with “let’s”: “Let’s brush your hair”, “Let’s go to the park together”, “Let’s pick out a wedding suit”. Sherlock starred in a few of John’s videos, but he kept his whispers for John himself, usually late at night, usually as John was moving inside him or he inside John.
There was silence, interrupted only by Rosie’s distracted noises – her attention riveted still on Shaun the Sheep. God, John couldn’t believe he’d just made a scene to the background of a children’s show.
But first, he had to stop off at Baker Street, to drop Rosie off at her most trusted babysitter. Mrs Hudson greeted him at the door before he could even knock. She was a vision in lilac and smelled strongly of freshly baked cookies.
“How long have you worked with Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Hooper?” the off-screen producer asks.
Sherlock, after all.
Dream of you and not wake but slumber on...
“I’ve missed you,” Sherlock said, after a long moment. “Not just lately, though it’s been...challenging, not seeing you. All along. All this time. Especially when you were close, and I couldn’t—we didn’t--”
“No, it isn’t!” John argued, thinking even as he did so,
Even after all these years – maybe especially after all these years.
John and Sarah made small talk, both of them doing so with the fervour only the truly lonely get. One of the things John missed most about living with someone was the ritual of talking about one’s day. True, Sherlock had largely deduced John’s day, but still, it was someone taking notice, wasn’t it? Mary had been really good at it. Whether she was truly interested, or whether it was because she’d spent most of it working with him, John still didn’t really know. And it’s not like he could give her the benefit of the doubt, not after everything that had happened.
“Who said you could look at the body?!” a vulture-like crime scene tech demands, his scrawny legs plucking into view. “Hey, that’s evidence!” he whines.
But his request is cut off by a sudden hiss. The camera swivels around to follow Sergeant Donovan’s glare.
This gave John a glimmer of hope. More energised, he made himself a cup of tea and pulled his mobile out. Perhaps he was overreacting. He knew how Sherlock was; he’d probably just gotten busy with some case or other. They lived at opposite ends of the city. He couldn’t expect to see or hear from him that often.
“The ‘science of deduction’?”
Unless...
At around eight, after he’d fed and bathed Rosie and put her to bed, John remembered he’d uploaded his ASMR video earlier that morning and pulled out his laptop to check how few hits he’d garnered. He kept his expectations low and so wasn’t devastated to see that it was in the single digits. First scowling at his screen, then sighing at his own neediness, John considered nuking Three Continents ASMR and selling everything he’d bought. But a fresh cup of tea, a bit of a mull and a yawning chasm of boredom spurred him back to the ASMR forum, this time to advertise his new video.
would be the one to fill it.
Sherlock stood in the doorway, nonplussed. It was easy to notice how frowzy he looked because he was usually so well put together, but John doubted anyone else would’ve noticed the crumpled button-up or the way his hair stuck up. He was sans blazer and had his sleeves rolled up.
“You’re not a bad parent,” Sherlock remarked.
for almost a decade.” John blew out a breath, readjusting Rosie’s seat on his lap. She was chattering to the bee in her arms and the stray stuffed bear on the sofa. John hadn’t meant to sound so bitter, and he didn’t want Rosie picking up on that. He forced a smile, but he knew it wasn’t convincing. “I would have been happy for anyone or anything to do it, as well.”
There was a beat of silence – well, near silence: Sherlock was moving around again.
was the moment to start, and with a swear word.
“Look, do I know you from somewhere?” John asked, suspicious. “If this is Bill’s doing, I swear to--”
Maybe, John thought, Sarah had been more right than John had been willing to admit. He needed to get out there again. A bit of fun, yeah? He wouldn’t need to resort to ASMR for
“Oh shit,” he says, knocking over his coffee in an attempt to straighten his tie.
Sherlock opened his mouth, then sighed forcefully and roughed up his hair in what John identified as “tired frustration”.
things and wouldn’t screw up his infant daughter with his reclusive tendencies.
Dr. Molly Hooper’s smile jumps around on her face. Her cheeks are flushed and her lipstick badly applied.
Sherlock looked at his knuckles, flexing his long fingers. When he spoke it sounded a bit as if he was forcing the words out, like trying to jam together puzzle pieces that didn’t fit. “Is it...Mary? I mean. Are you nervous because... You haven’t been with...anyone since--?”
John considered, but after a moment – a moment he wished very much he still had his gun in hand – he relented and closed his eyes.
“I’m not sure. Isn’t there something about sin? I can’t remember – must’ve deleted it.”
It was this thought (and the long, lonely, cold desire behind it) that snapped John out of it a little. He’d promised himself that he wouldn’t go there. If not for himself, then for Rosie.
“That doesn’t give you the authority to break into his house--” DI Dimmock is furious.
“Oh, no mind,” Sherlock said, pulling himself up to his full height and—well, there was no other word for it—
John had just opened his mouth to demand to know who it was when Sherlock’s voice said, “Don’t shoot, John, it’s me.”
“John saved me.” Sherlock’s eyes drift close, but he sounds confident of this. “John always saves me.”
“What a pickle you’ve got yourself into, John,” he muttered to himself. John considered his mobile, then tapped out a brief response:
He pondered that a bit before he erased it. He tried again:
. Sherlock was afraid.
After a while, John forgot the camera was rolling, and soon he and Rosie were eating contentedly. There was a minor fracas over who got the last bite of cheese, which Rosie won. John swapped out her toys for a fresh batch so she wouldn’t get bored and diligently got started on the cleaning up.
The next best thing would be to take up a hobby. He supposed he could start up his blog again, but without Sherlock, what would he blog about? And anyway, the whole point was to
He had just reached the stairs when he heard his flat door open behind him.
(Day 3)
“Did you row?”
This sent a prickle of—well,
“Then why are you here?” Sherlock was looking at him, puzzled.
On screen, one of Shaun’s plans ended in a spectacular barn explosion. Rosie looked at John and said very clearly, with a gummy, self-satisfied smile, “Shit.”
Not that he kept one there, of course: they were all safely locked up in the office. But if a junkie was desperate enough, even one as clever as Sherlock...
“’Shit’,” John quoted his daughter.

“They work together, don’t they?” the producer asks, but just as Molly’s facial expression resolves back into pleased coyness, the producer adds, “And live together.”
John was reluctant to do this—understandably so, he thought. “Why?” he wanted to know, suspicious.
He could try for Rosie, couldn’t he?
Of course, John realised, stomach plunging, he was assuming that Sherlock wanted what he did. The truth was that John didn’t know
Molly looked at John as if waiting for him to say something else.
the little darling!” she exclaimed, immediately reaching for Rosie. Rosie, who had been settling into a real sulk (probably because John had changed out of four different sets of clothing, and gotten more irate with himself after each change) lit up like a string of Christmas lights.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked, looking up from where he was showing Rosie a set of soft blocks. She regarded the bright purple side of one of these blocks with a frown of concentration that was ruined only somewhat by the fact that she had a Fruitloop stuck to her forehead.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “The only thing Irene and I have in common are that we’re both gay.”
It was a long, sleepless night.
“She knows her father’s a war veteran,” Sherlock rejoined, leaning cross-armed against the door frame.
John sighed. Rosie hadn’t really started talking yet. She babbled, sang and hummed, yes, but nothing resembling a language. He hoped to God she wouldn’t decide
“I—what?” He looked surprised to see John.
“Sorry guys, I’m a right klutz,” he’s saying, and then yelps, “Ouch, Jesus!” when the steaming coffee runs into his lap.
“What’s the Freak doing here?!” Sally demands. “Tell me you didn’t call him,
He paused, his heart rate picking up.
That got John a rare, full smile, and who knows how long he and Sherlock might have looked at each other? It felt like their looks were getting longer and longer, and John didn’t know what to
John’s ghosts were very loud that night.
John shook his head. “I don’t want to risk our friendship. It’s probably just grief anyway, yeah? God, I need to get out more. And now I can’t even go on a bender with Greg, or he’ll have trouble from his missus.”
“Then what the fuck is going on?” But the anger had evaporated. John just felt tired. He tried to distract Rosie with a toy, but she had started crying in earnest, upset by their friction. He lifted her out of the high chair and, after a second’s hesitation, offered her to Sherlock. “She misses you.”
“Well,” Sherlock said. When nothing presented itself to refute John’s disbelief, he switched tracks. “Are you really that adverse to company?”
For a second, John could see himself correcting her mistake, giving her the other beer, and going back to the booth she’d inevitably be able to conjure up. He could imagine exchanging pleasantries in that faux-intimate setting, getting drunker and drunker, and finally suggesting a cab and her flat or his. The sex would be good. The morning after would be brief. He wouldn’t even have to worry about her wanting to meet Rosie; she wasn’t here for that, and good for her.
He knew what Ella would want when he saw her. She’d want some kind of action plan. As his therapy had progressed, her trust in him had as well, and she now expected him to play a more active role in his own support.
“Speaking from personal experience, then, John?” Sherlock’s tone was hard and sarcastic and maybe even a little taunting. Sherlock wanted him to drop it, and who knows? A year ago, a month ago, a
John’s biggest distraction had always been being at war with himself. His respectability had only been salvaged because he’d gone off to an
“It’s Christmas!” sings the tall man, plucking his spluttering companion from beneath the sinewy skeleton and spinning him around by his shoulders.
you had a partner you’d probably be going door-to-door with pamphlets or something similarly tedious, but people aren’t likely to let a stranger into their house when he’s all alone, so you got stuck with phoning people. On a Friday night, been doing it for, what, a month or more at least? Like I said: single, unattached, loner.”
“John.” Sherlock reached up to hold his hand to his lips. “You were the good and brilliant one first, I’ve just been trying to catch up. I...I don’t think I’m quite there yet. But I’d very much like to keep trying.”
“Rosie just said her first real word,” John said, desperate to have a normal, non-fraught adult conversation.
“Yes, Anderson, evidence,” snarls the other man, “something you only have a passing familiarity with—much like personal hygiene.”
“What does a ‘consulting detective’ do?” the producer asks.
“God, I feel so--” John started, voice thick.
“Well according to you it’s a fiction of my simple-minded, cosmically-overwhelmed brain, so what did you expect?”
The man had moved his hands, just enough to free one of them so he could rub at the cuff of his shirt in a deliberate way, brushing the material between his forefinger and thumb. The hands were familiar to John, with their long fingers, pale skin, indelicate knuckles and veiny texture. He’d recognise them anywhere. They were Sherlock’s hands.
“Ah,” Sherlock said, grim, “it
The producer agrees and the screen goes blank.
“God, no,” John said and stood aside to let her pass.

Just great. And no one would have to know how

“Yeah,” John reassured him, squeezing his hand.
“What was the case?” John asked Sherlock urgently. He had to struggle to find and hold Sherlock’s gaze.
of it. It was Sherlock, John had thought, irritated, when he had to push past Sherlock at Baker Street a few weeks ago; and this was
John tried at least to pretend to believe himself when he said, “Yeah, we should do that sometime.”
John sent the text and waited, all the while pretending he wasn’t waiting for a response, taking tiny, unsatisfying sips of tea as the minutes ticked past. He had just finished the laborious and time-consuming task of rinsing his mug out when his mobile phone chimed in his pocket.
John picked up his fork and, feeling a little dazed, fed Rosie another bite before he said, frowning, “Sarah and I are work colleagues,” remembering as he said it how he once corrected Sherlock’s dunce friend when Sherlock introduced John to him as his friend.
Sherlock didn’t comment and John didn’t bother to turn around and register his expression. He could think what he wanted.
“No, that’s fine,” John said, too quickly. He chuckled at himself. “I rarely get the chance anymore. The crèche’s usually given her her bath by the time I pick her up.”
John slipped in beside him, sighing as he settled before looking over to Sherlock. Sherlock was studying him in minute eye twitches. John felt remarkably calm about the attention.
“Is Mycroft paying her, d’you think?” John asked Sherlock, picking a babbling Rosie up. Sherlock was clearing the table with as much enthusiasm as you’d expect someone like Sherlock to have for such a mundane task.
So it was that on an unparticular Wednesday night at eleven forty-two pm, when John was Googling increasingly obscure cures for insomnia, he found a thread in a forum gushing about ASMR, how relaxing it was, and how many people routinely fell asleep with it.
But he didn’t. Sherlock nodded distantly and dropped his eyes.
“You’re funny,” John told him, fetching a couple of plates for him and Sherlock, and the little Tupperware bowl he used for Rosie.
The camera zooms in on Sherlock and John; Sherlock looking peaceful, John doting.
“What are you doing here?” John asked instead, trying to pat down Rosie’s curls. She had given up the quest for the baby monitor in favour of giving John’s nose kisses with the bee.
John was up early the next day, tired but resigned to it. He spent most of the morning watching Shaun the Sheep with Rosie. He sat on the floor with her, an assortment of toys – stuffed toys, blocks, the broken-off wheel of a large plastic motorcycle – arranged around them. Looking at these, John realised the toys were probably meant to be watching
“What did you think I might be in for?” John wondered.
“I think we’re both hungry little bees, John, thanks for asking,” said Sherlock dryly, pulling Rosie’s high chair closer to the table. She and the bee toy both went onto it. Sherlock idled, picking up and immediately discarding an old newspaper.
Yeah, so calling people to talk about Jesus after hours wasn’t something John had ever imagined he’d be doing. He’d hardly even been a churchgoer before the war. Baptisms, weddings, funerals – that about covered it. But then he’d been shot in Afghanistan. It was a bad wound, followed by an even worse infection. He should have died, which was why he’d been thinking,
—John’s heart swelled. He and Sherlock had had their ups and downs – and what an understatement
“Did you have a nice time, darling?” John asked her, cuddling her close. She made those “uh, uh, uh” noise that babies seem to make for no apparent reason. He absolutely did not have a lump in his throat. “Did you and Mrs Hudson have a good time?”
“Yes, I’m Dr. John Watson,” he says.
It wasn’t even half past eight by the time they were back at Baker Street. Sherlock held the door open so John could squeeze past with their Chinese take-out. Mrs Hudson, with only marginally pursed lips, refrained from comment as she came out with Rosie. Sherlock took over the bags so John could take Rosie, who seemed happier to see him than their hour’s parting really deserved.
“This video is a combination of sounds, especially sounds that are very often requested” (the “t” broke like an egg over the back of John’s skull), but seem to not have enough time in the videos. These sounds to me are quite...
Taking a deep breath and feeling somewhat nervous, John hit record, tapping each microphone once before he sat down at the desk and adjusted his seating. He fiddled with the laptop, making sure that neither the screen nor the files would be visible to the camera. The camera was angled low enough that the viewer wouldn’t be able to see John’s face or much background; just his hands and arms.
“No. As I’m sure you’ve, ah, deduced.” The beginnings of a hopeful hard-on felt very visible through the thin fabric of John’s shorts. He rubbed the back of his neck. A part of him wanted to step forward and help Sherlock out of his clothes, and then just cover, claim, as much of Sherlock as he’d allow. But a wiser part of John – small, it was true, but insistent – told him to hold back.
“Needs must,” said Sherlock, with a dismissive wave of his hand. He looked like he was about to elaborate on his own cleverness, but John interrupted.
There was a bit of silence while they both acknowledged this clearly to be a lie, but avoided talking about it.
John chuckled. “It’s a he, and he might let me go more easily than you’d think.” Which was so true, John felt a flush of depression at the thought.
John nodded to his reflection, resolute. He wouldn’t need to listen to ASMR again, and Sherlock wouldn’t instinctively feel the need to pry, and so would never be able to guess that John’s very first thought upon hearing the blonde woman’s “Good evening” had been how much he wished it was
“So was yours,” Sherlock replied smoothly.
“You’re coming along?” This was news to John.
crew aren’t the ones doing it.
John didn’t know quite what to say to that, so he ducked his head and cornered off a bite of macaroni for Rosie. He blew on it to cool it down before beginning the arduous process of convincing her to eat it. Tonight it required him patiently pretending to feed three stuffed toys before Rosie, satisfied that her friends weren’t being left out, acquiesced.
“Did you just come in?” John muttered, voice sleep-roughened, then, “What time is it?”, then, “Jesus!” when he noticed the arc of sunlight touching his sock-clad feet, then a final, “Oh God!” with a panicked, instinctual look in the direction of Rosie’s room.
“There’s only one way to solve it,” Sherlock said. “But it’s—it’s dangerous. The most dangerous thing I’ve ever – will ever...”
he typed into a new post,
intrigued to see him bring this case to its conclusion--”
Sherlock grinned. “I’d better finish off the tea,” he said and disappeared back to the kitchen.
“Ooh, how
Funny that Sherlock had said that just a few weeks ago, about John and Sarah. The difference being that Sherlock had been right, and John wasn’t.
“And you’re not even paying for it,” John says. The camera flicks to the pixellated corner. It radiates disapproval.
“Want to drive back?” John asked him.
John didn’t confront Sherlock about it right away. It was easy, as there was a lot to keep them busy, what with John and Rosie’s moving back to Baker Street, his and Sherlock’s individual and joint therapy sessions, and their getting to third base. John let things settle.
“Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ?”
“You could bathe her here,” Sherlock said, busy at the sink, his back to John. “Sleep over.”
“You smoke?” Still surprise.
John sighed and filled their mugs, carrying them to the table. “Nothing. We’re a very well-oiled machine, aren’t we?”
The ASMR thing would be John’s little secret.
Molly’s lips thinned. “I think he misses you,” she said in a determined sort of way that John both appreciated for her sake but was annoyed by.
There was another burst of knocking. John swung his feet from the bed, not bothering with robe or slippers. Moving soundlessly, he retrieved his gun from the small gun safe in the closet before padding out into the flat proper.
“No,” John said quickly. He was glad for the dark interior of the car. He cleared his throat. “I mean. Yes? I haven’t. Been with.” He cleared his throat again. He didn’t know why he admitted that, why he thought it was important to say that. Sherlock wouldn’t care. He didn’t care about stuff like that, right? Right. So why was John so nervous? Sherlock was just trying to be supportive. Right?
“You gave me a key,” Sherlock said behind him. He’d come back in and shut the door behind him. His tone was defensive, but his posture was tired. He looked like he hadn’t been sleeping.
“If you start a fight, I’m leaving,” John said and pushed past him. He could have sworn Sherlock crowded the doorway on purpose, so he’d be forced to squeeze past him, but
John woke his laptop up and pulled up his browser. When he’d typed up the email it had automatically opened his favourite tabs, which included YouTube. He almost clicked there out of habit, wondering which of his favourite ASMRtists had uploaded since he’d been on last before he paused.
Sarah wrinkled her nose. “I have beer.”
protests John.
“I—what—
“Shh, shh,” John tells him, “you’re still in the hospital.”
There were a few seconds of silence. John was sure Deep Throat would hang up in a huff – oh, and he didn’t blame him, John was shit at evangelism – but no, the git stayed on the line.
John let out a sigh that was half-longing, half-regret and one hundred percent nascent mid-life crisis.
“You haven’t got anywhere to be,” said Deep Throat. He sounded very confident. It was, John thought, the kind of confidence begging to be asked “Why?”
Sherlock swallowed and sought out John’s lips again.
All was dark and quiet, save the shadow of a person beneath the front door.
So John said, “I’m sorry.” He meant it, too, because he now understood what he was apologising
No, he hadn’t imagined it. There was another sound somewhere behind the door; a pause, a scuffle, then silence.
Two men have entered the pub. One is tall and pale with a definite crazy look about the eye. His coat flaps dramatically as he stalks into the room, squinting at the light fixtures and doing an on-the-spot about turn. His companion is short, squishy and prematurely grey. His expression is that of a man who has outlived many horrors and expects to see many more.
“Yeah—I mean, I guess,” John admitted.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, eyes falling to the area in question. He swallowed visibly and licked his lips. John’s boner became decidedly more optimistic.
John didn’t know what to make of Sherlock’s mood. They seemed to be talking an awful lot about relationships for two British men just lately. Was Sherlock really still on this? Why did it matter – why did he care? That was sort of the problem John had been facing the last week: Sherlock didn’t care, not like that.
John had a few patients after his extended lunch break. Nothing exciting, but experience had taught him that boring was better when it came to being a doctor. He treated nothing more serious or significant than a stomach flu and managed to sneak out a couple of minutes early to pick up Rosie.
But perhaps for Sherlock, it didn’t feel that long ago. John generally tried not to think about that time, afraid that he’d be filled with the same weight of dread, terror, loss and betrayal that had filled him then... and the anger, he couldn’t forget the anger. Seeing Sherlock fall was right up there with seeing Mary dying. But at least, in some ways, often
“Hm,” Sherlock hummed, which was dangerous territory.
John snorted. Rosie was a still very alert weight in his arms, craning to follow Sherlock’s progress around the kitchen. “Well, thank you for a lovely evening,” John said, “but I’d better get her home, bathed and to bed.”
Feeling very much Devil-may-care, or more accurately, too sad and tired to care, John edited the description and hit “Upload”.
John preceded Sherlock into his bedroom, quickly arranging the bed and pulling back the covers. Then he went to check on Rosie, spending a few minutes more than he needed to watch her sleep, just collecting himself and absorbing the moment. By the time he returned, Sherlock was curled up on his side, covers pulled up to his shoulders.
Sherlock looked as he usually did, and he gave John his customary, minute up-and-down eye flick that meant he was cataloguing what John had been up to, possibly so he could use it to embarrass, startle or derail him later on. John accepted it like one accepted things like death and taxes and stood aside to let Sherlock enter.
“You know how it goes,” John said, adjusting Rosie. He felt another twinge of guilt about how eagerly she was feeding. “I started with a funny cat video and ended up learning how to build a naturally-filtered swimming pool.”
Dial-a-Jesus? Good Lord. But it was uncanny.
“Yes?”
“What?” demanded the man. “That’s it? You haven’t even really tried, have you!”
Sarah had been separated from her husband for three months. John had run into him once when he’d stopped by the surgery to pick up something. He was a nice enough bloke; maybe a bit
“Yeah,” John found himself saying. “You know what? I’ve got to dash. Here, my treat.” He deposited the beers back on the counter and pushed them over. “Sorry,” he added, though for what, John hardly knew.
“Not interested,” the man said immediately.
John looked up. Sherlock’s regard was naked, vulnerable – and understanding. “Yes,” he whispered.
“Stupid,” Molly finished for him, returning with the box of tissues she’d gone to fetch from the kitchen. “I know. But you’re not.”
“I’m only trying to save your bloody soul, aren’t I!” John returned, in the same tone.
Rosie, who was so unlike him and Mary: cheerful, curious, trusting. John had failed himself, he’d failed her mother, he’d failed Sherlock and Harry and a litany of people – but maybe, for Rosie...
was – and he was still such a drama queen, but it was like everything that had happened, with Mary and Rosie and Eurus, had stripped away his hard outer layer. These days, Sherlock was patient, kinder – gentler. And maybe John was, too.
Nobody felt
Having fetched her (she was ridiculously happy to see him), John stopped off at a store and bought an unnecessarily expensive box of chocolates for Sarah since all the flowers look bedraggled and wilted. He hailed a cab and arrived at Sarah’s place a bit after six, naturally just as Rosie was beginning to fuss. John paid the cabbie and hoisted his child, her bag, his satchel and the grocery bag up the narrow bit of pavement between the road and the Georgian terrace. Mercifully Sarah’s flat was on the ground level, so John didn’t have to navigate any staircases.
“Uhm--” The camera shifts around.
“John, phone,” the man says the same instant his front pocket chirrups. “There are no teeth, where are the teeth?” he mutters, sinking into a crouch (the camera follows him) before seizing something between the tips of his fingers.
“Look I’m—it was nice talking,” John said, finding his voice more honest than he’d have liked it to be. “And sorry for trying to save your soul,” he added, trying to lighten his tone.
“What about me?” He had abandoned his fork.
“You’re not a very good Christian you know,” the man pointed out.
“You have?” John slumped a bit, reinvesting his attention on the poop-removal process. He was so relieved he wasn’t even irritated that Sherlock hadn’t bothered to consult him first. “I didn’t realise it was that late. You must be starving,” he told Rosie, but she looked no worse for wear. “Was Sarah alright with it?”
“Are you good?” John asked her, sorting out the mugs.
bothered him, and John had been so wrapped up in his own realisation about Sherlock that he hadn’t noticed it.
“Since we’re talking love lives,” John said. “Did you ever get in touch with Irene? You said you text.”
Sherlock nodded, distracted.
“Yeah?” he croaked.
“I see.” The woman’s interest withdrew as suddenly as a tide pulling back, and John, replaying the conversation, realised what she thought he meant: that he was gay and looking for his ‘friend’.
it felt to leave Sherlock behind on nights like this...least of all Sherlock himself.
“What do--?” John clicked his tongue. “I haven’t met anyone. I don’t know why you think that, honestly. No,” John said because Sherlock had opened his mouth and was surely planning on telling him
“I usually am,” Sherlock returned, as John had known he would. “What about?”
John was very proud of himself for snapping his mouth shut as quickly as he did.
“Any videos in particular?” Sherlock asked, after a moment. He pocketed his phone.
“Better for seeing you, I think,” John admitted, trying to grit his teeth against the flare-up of insecurity. He wasn’t sure how well he fared, honestly. He handed Rosie over, feeling the strangest emotional wobble as he did so. “We’ve been having a row.”
“I...guess.” It was as much as Sherlock could hope for, John thought, with their history.
“Thank you for your time,” John said, blithe. “I won’t take up any more--”
“No. ‘Your life is not your own.’ A wise man told me that. Well,” John corrected, “a wise man’s genius, deranged sister, quoting said wise man, whilst kidnapping me with the intention to drown me. But I think the point stands.”
After a listless Friday, the weekend whipped past, aggravatingly cold. John spent much of it indoors with Rosie. He didn’t hear a peep from Sherlock and after typing out and deleting half a dozen texts (“Good luck”, “Thank you”, “I’m sorry”, “You git”, “I’m in love with you”) he gave it up as a bad job and hoped (prayed?) Sherlock’s case wouldn’t get him killed.
felt about Sherlock, and how he felt about Sherlock
“Perfectly, but I’m afraid I don’t know any Bill.” The man sighed like he was luxuriating in being a smug git. Oh, he probably was.
bad idea.
John dawdled over the post like the old man he was fast becoming, finally settling for linking his previous post asking for advice and adding:
“’Which James Bonds all have moustaches?’” John read from his phone. It had still been in his pocket. He held it beyond Rosie’s reach when she tried to grab it.“‘What are Teletubby?’”
Did he?
“You hacked my Gmail account, didn’t you?” John asked dryly.
“She’s fine. See?” Sherlock offered Rosie to John with a practised motion.
“Brilliant man,” John went on, letting the back of his fingers trail along Sherlock’s scruffy jaw. “A good one, too. Too good for me, I’m afraid.” His voice broke a little on the last few words.
Intrigued and desperate and most of all, exhausted, John opened YouTube and typed in “ASMR”. The screen quickly filled with results. He tapped on one of the first people who came up, a blonde woman with large eyes who absolutely
But time stretched ahead of John like a freezing lake with only the thinnest veneer of ice to cover it; ice that would crack at even the slightest pressure. How long would Sherlock be gone? And, honestly, would it be long enough for John to staunch his feelings?
Then Sherlock starts awake again.
John sucked in a breath, held it, looked around again. Blew his breath out. Was he really telling this to a stranger? On the other hand, this was the most interesting conversation he’d had in weeks.
John considered, but decided against answering. Posh n Deep could leave a voice message for Ella to deal with in the morning – after all, that was literally her job description. He was just a volunteer. He pulled on his coat, locked the office behind him, and set off for the tube station a few blocks away.
“Would you mind taking us through it?”
Right.
“And Sherlock Holmes is a ‘consulting detective’?” the producer ascertains when John continues to stare at her without blinking.
DI Dimmock glares at the camera as it takes up position behind him, primed on the scuffed, faded door with an untidily spray-painted ‘3’ on it. He’s wrapped up in a tan coat and clutching an official-looking paper.
“Do you need—can I help?” John asked, knowing even as he asked that it was unlikely that he’d be able to help if Sherlock and his other connections couldn’t.
He’d always been a practical man, Dr Watson, and so he tried to approach it pragmatically.
“Your number was listed!” John protested.
He had uncorked the bottle and was surprised, in turning around, to find Sherlock still regarding him.
John frowned. He was thinking of the fact that he forgave both Mary and Sherlock and they him. “If you want it to, I think a relationship can survive almost anything. Neither I nor Sarah wanted that,” he added.
Their conversation had become uncomfortable after his confession about James Sholto. That was what John kept coming back to. At the time, he didn’t really consider that Sherlock might have an adverse reaction to having had a closeted whatever-sexual (John was vague on terms, something Ella would no doubt have an opinion about) roommate, friend and colleague for more than five years. Sherlock had never appeared to have an issue with gay people – he treated everyone the same, which is to say, dismissively.
Still, he had made a promise, so he persevered.
With Rosie settled for another indeterminate of time with Shaun the Sheep, John was free to start processing the footage he’d recorded. It was rough, but he worked on it on and off the whole day, in between entertaining and otherwise caring for Rosie and himself. He set it to upload while he bathed Rosie and got her settled, and made himself yet another cup of tea before he sat down at the kitchen table to check the upload’s progress.
John’s post on the ASMR forum had received a few replies; mostly, John suspected, from types trying to avoid the nascent festive spirit. But three or four were from ASMRtists and directed him to resources, how-tos, and sales on the equipment he’d need to get started. A few pledged support once he started posting, for feedback if nothing else.
John tapped cautiously and with the volume on his tablet on low, but the blue link merely took him to a Wikipedia page. According to the article, “Auto-Sensory Meridian Response” was the name for a physical sensation felt by some people when they heard certain sounds: whispering, soft speaking, tapping, crinkling and so on. The phenomenon was largely self-reported, with little in the way of official research.
“I haven’t even had it-- Oh, you dick,” John realised.
. Proving to John that there both was a God and that he or she hated him personally.
someone you know then.”
“Is that so?” Sherlock’s eyes were focused on John’s lips. John noticed that Sherlock’s pupils were wide, bright.
and checked his watch instead. “If we hurry,” he said, doing the mixture of maths, faith and alchemy that every Londoner reliant on the underground did, “we can--”
Sherlock sat up, all the better to preen. “Two days,” he said. “And I knew you’d find it because hotlips365, the ASMR forum admin who shared Casebook ASMR is
Fortified by the tea and the possibility that his unplanned confession hadn’t alienated his best friend, John tapped out a text:
John showered and pottered about after, but of course, it was only a matter of time before he returned to the kitchen drawer. He stared at the tablet where it lay for a minute, wondering what the hell he was doing and what the hell he was
John had only been standing around in the artificially-lit tube station a few minutes when his mobile phone started ringing. The screen didn’t show any number, just “Unknown”. He was tempted to ignore it, but with his luck, it would be the clinic and there would be some kind of emergency.
“No.” John smiled to try to soften the word, but judging by Rosie’s unhappy burble, he guess it failed to do so. “I’ll always admire him, but, no.”
Anderson shrieks after her as they outrun him.
Sherlock was nodding now. “You can. Only you can.”
Amazon.co.uk received quite a penny in patronage from John that Saturday. After research –
But for all his gently swaying Rosie, John didn’t quite believe him. “Sarah invited us over for dinner. No,” he pre-empted, busying himself with the kettle, “it wasn’t a date. Just friends catching up.”
What he needed, John knew, was a distraction. Before Rosie, this would have involved many benders undertaken at many pubs, clubs and casinos with friends who weren’t really friends, merely acquaintances who were trying to do the same thing John was: forget. John was thinking of his varsity days especially. There had been borderline sleazy flirting and casual sex, screaming matches with Harry and John’s girlfriend of the week, loggerheads with his bosses and underlings at University College. Late nights, groggy mornings, beer sweat, anger.
A woman’s hands came into view, stroking over a blanket. “Good evening,” she purred, her movements rhythmic and soothing. John couldn’t see her face in this video, just the tips of her hair, a crystal pendant, a striped shirt, and pale arms and manicured nails. She spoke softly, liltingly, with a slight accent – Russian, maybe.
He paused to consider how to sign it.
“I’ve been reliably informed that I don’t have one.”
If he was honest with himself, John wanted his own bed, and he wanted his tablet, and he wanted to listen to some ASMR and finally, hopefully, get some sleep, and put this disaster of an “evening out” behind him and just accept his middling middle-ageness in the privacy of his own home.
For the next three weeks, ASMR became a part of John’s daily routine. The initial rush - “brain tingles” - wore off, but the relaxation persisted, and Maria, Emma and a few others nursed John through several bouts of insomnia. He picked up a few extra shifts at the clinic, spent more time outdoors with Rosie even as the weather continued to cool down, and helped Sherlock with two cases. John didn’t even resent the fact that in both cases, Sherlock largely used him as a sounding board to riddle together a series of clues while he, John, made them dinner and lunch respectively.
It was Molly, dressed casually in jeans and a thick emerald coloured jumper and heavy navy coat. Her smile was uncertain. She looked good these days, happier and more confident, but she’d never be a social butterfly, which was fine. She’d forgone her customary ponytail for two pleats.
ASMR, he thought.
called
“Err.” (There’s a sound like notes being shuffled.)
This puzzled John, and it rather put the fork in some of his grander conspiracy theories. Maybe, he thought, returning to the video itself (it was the newest one), Sherlock had stumbled across ASMR the same way he, John, had. It didn’t really surprise John that Sherlock would start a channel himself. A captive audience? What more could a genius drama queen want or need?
So blogging was a no-go. Maybe something athletic? John had played rugby at school, but he was on the wrong side of forty now, and his little canter with the Scotland Yarders had reminded him strongly of that fact, even if his ego has resisted. Biking? John still had his bike somewhere. The thing with biking was that it was incredibly, incredibly dull, and he’d frankly rather take up suicide than bike ever again.
“I spent an unholy amount of money on two beers, and you’d left. Unbelievable.” But there was no heat in it. John commandeered the cigarette and joined Sherlock against the hood. He took a deep drag of it, pulling a face at the taste.
He should just have told Sherlock, John reflected, rinsing the toothpaste from his mouth. He’d made it weirder by lying. Now Sherlock probably thought he’d drifted off mid-wank, like the middle-aged man he was fast becoming.
(Day 2)
“Yes. John Watson--”
“There is a box of chocolates,” John told her, “somewhere in my right hand. Please pry it from my fingers.”
Sherlock picked up his fork again, but his interest in eating was apparently dwindling apace to Rosie’s.
“I don’t know. To convince myself I still can? No,” he thought. He blew out a breath. “To convince myself I still
“ASMR can be so...intimate,” he said finally. “I hoped if you listened to my videos...I guess I hoped you’d see me in a different way. Like someone you could be close to.” Sherlock looked at him then. “I didn’t know what else to do,” he confessed, colouring. “I thought maybe... There had been moments, over the years, when we... When it felt like...”
Peering through his curtains at Sherlock clambering into the Vantage, John was unhappy to find that it felt even worse watching Sherlock leave than it did to leave him behind. John stood there long after the car had disappeared around the corner, only snapping out of it when Rosie crawled past him to the kitchen, no doubt to pursue mortal injury. John snatched her up, bounced her until she stopped crying about his impeding her plans, then got her to bed. Favoured by the gods, she dropped off quickly, leaving John at loose ends as the night ticked on.
“We’re at The Bird pub,” Greg continues, leading the jostling group across the street to a weedy-looking establishment. Seagulls protest in the overcast sky, wings bony in the cool breeze. “A barman found the proprietor dead this morning. He’d been shot at close range with his own weapon.”
Sherlock hummed agreement. Non-committed agreement.
At the very least, John reflected, adjusting his camera, it was a slightly more original name than “The Blog of Dr John Watson” had been.
John had to smile at that. The look in Sherlock’s eyes was nothing short of ravenous. This was going to be hard. But it
But, of course, they
And then he worked. John didn’t make any special effort to crinkle the paper or stroke the keyboard; he just opened the first file, pulled up Meddbase and started correlating information. It was slow, tedious going, which is why he’d left it so late. He hoped it would make a decent enough quality video.
They took their tea through to the living room. Midway between mutual commiserating about staff layoffs in the NHS and the general state of medicine, Molly went the colour of beetroot and confessed, rather abruptly, “I, er, have some good news.”
“You scared the
John was panicking, of course. Since when did Sherlock listen to or make ASMR videos? John hadn’t noticed anything like that when they still lived together and thought he was sure he’d have seen the kind of equipment ASMRtists use around the Baker Street flat if Sherlock had taken it up since then. No, John decided, checking blood pressure and prescribing antibiotics for UTIs, this had to be either a mistake or a trick.
. They could be
“You were right, you know,” John told him. He reached up with the back of a hand to brush a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead.
“What? Oh yeah. No, fine, thanks.” John pocketed his phone. “I should get back to my office. Sorry about...earlier.”
“My train’s here,” John said, just as the first screech and shudder of the impending train started up from the tunnel.
Sherlock took two drags to answer. “Yes,” he decided. He gave John a half-smile, more remote than anything, before dropping and stubbing out the cigarette with his shoe.
Listening to ASMR again after two weeks felt a lot like sinking into a hot bath. John listened to another video by the same woman he’d listened to first – an ASMRtist, as they called themselves – and was out cold before the video was even halfway through. He slept long and deeply and woke up feeling refreshed for the first time in a fortnight.
it was a very,
Molly bit her lip. “Maybe you should talk to him. I’ve always thought, well.” She reddened. “I thought maybe the reason he...doesn’t like me, is because he likes, well, you.”
Sunday, after a brisk walk in the local park with Rosie, John studied tutorials, making notes and jotting down ideas. He was starting to think about the kind of videos he’d like to make. He did this by thinking about videos he’d like to watch, and then pondered how he could produce those videos himself. He picked a few simple scenarios and methodically worked through what he would need and how to go about staging and recording. His scribbled to-do lists were something to behold.
and John realising, with complete and sudden clarity, that he now wanted
He did everything as he normally did, just a little more quietly. He boiled some eggs, fried some bacon, diced a tomato, cut some cheese; boiled the kettle, prepped his tea and Rosie’s bottle; got the toast on. Rosie was quiet, content to wait in her high chair, touching and babbling to some of her stuffed toys.
Sherlock looked at him. “There are some things relationships can’t survive?” he wondered.
The defensiveness slid off Sherlock’s face, replaced by a momentary flash of hurt. “No,” he said. “I—I’d never do that to you, John. I swear.”
It was hard to describe what John felt at that moment. He sat on his couch, half-empty mug in hand, watching the man he loved rock his daughter to sleep. The man he loved...who didn’t love him back.
“Uhm, maybe we should--” The camera drops from Greg’s startled facial expression.
John and Rosie spent Sunday morning out, which was not to either of their liking, but there was shopping to be done. They were back at the flat just after ten, cold, hungry and grumpy, and John immediately headed into the kitchen to get a proper breakfast started.
John only had a second’s warning of body heat and rustling clothing before Sherlock’s lips touched his own. The kiss was marginal – barely a kiss at all – pressure and suggestion more than substance. Sherlock smelled like nicotine and rain and a fugue of aftershave and hair gel. His lips were chapped, his beard scratchy, his hand fever warm where it rested momentarily on John’s shoulder.
“You’ve known each other a long time,” Sherlock noted.
He was not, John told himself, latching the bathroom door, fleeing. He was not. He had to pee and freshen up. If he didn’t do it now, while Sherlock was still here, who knows when he’d get a chance? A one-year-old could keep one surprisingly busy.
There was a bit of silence as they processed their mutual stupidity.
John’s punctuated his withering look with the none-too-gentle
“Sherlock--!” the short man warns, but he’s interrupted by a falling corpse.
. John had never really been able to pin down exactly what Sherlock felt, and
But Sherlock surprised him again. “Yes,” he said immediately. “Will you?”
Which made John feel endlessly dejected. “So what--” he started, mostly to stop his mood from spiralling. He didn’t need Sherlock to catch on to that.
Sherlock attempts to tackle him, but the tip of an umbrella emerges from the pixellation and trips Sherlock before he can reach the DI.
Steady on, Watson, he told himself, as the door opened.
“Oh yeah?” Molly at least looked genuinely curious.
John stifled a sigh. “Yeah.”
“Wait, guys, are we--?” DI Greg Lestrade drops his feet from the desk, up-ending a half-eaten donut onto a pile of paperwork in the process. He hastily mops up the tack of icing sugar with a crumpled paper napkin. Off-camera, Sergeant Donovan sighs.
Anderson’s hurtle toward the tall man is impeded by the second camera person; the first captures footage of the crime scene tech’s rather spectacular fall. The tall man stalks off without noticing.
“The rat droppings clearly demonstrate that Idleman is involved with what happened at the pub yesterday--” Sherlock is saying, his frustration invading personal space, knocking against John's shoulder and making the camera twitch nervously.
“Thank God,” said John, with exaggerated relief. It got a laugh from Sarah.
that about him and answer his unasked question once and for all: did he, Sherlock, feel the same? Could they...?
Time, as it was wont to do when left to its own devices, wore on. A fortnight passed, edging them into the winter season. John forsook ASMR and slept little. But it wasn’t until Sarah started making snarky comments again that John followed through on his resolution, and “went out”.
John released him immediately, but he moved a half-step closer. Their last few encounters flashed through his mind. Had Sherlock... Had he been asking...?
“What are you going to do?” Molly asked him finally.
“Why, Sherlock? Why go to all that trouble?”
Relief and then anger flooded through John in quick succession. He turned around, eyes narrowed.
“Yeah, yeah thanks guys, let’s just get this sorted--”
“He wouldn’t need to,” Sherlock responded dryly.
said anything.
“You think so?” Sherlock asked, tone imperious.
John stared at Sherlock, very aware of their history, very aware of every “we’re not a couple” and “I’m not actually gay” and “he’s my best friend”. There was a lot of emotional territory to traverse between all of
“You’re mental. I could be dangerous,” and damn it all if John wasn’t smiling into his mobile phone, much to the female commuter’s discomfort.
Sally fumes and storms away, bits of plaster drifting into her curly hair like snowflakes.
“Yeah, Greg, we’re live. We’ll take it from the--”
When they broke apart, John chuckled. “Brilliant,” John whispered in the shell of Sherlock’s right ear. “Amazing,” into his left ear.
them. Which made him worry: did Rosie feel lonely when she was away from the crèche?
“Is he the one, then?” Sherlock asked, after a long moment.
It made sense, even though a part of John – the part embarrassed by the fact that he enjoyed ASMR, specifically
“We have, yeah.”
Sherlock frowned, and for a moment he and Rosie looked eerily identical. Not for the first time, it occurred to John that Rosie could easily pass for Sherlock’s, what with the curls and the blue eyes. And not for the first time, this thought made John
“Like I said, it’s obvious from your volunteering.”
Sherlock Holmes wasn’t just a great man anymore – he was a good one too, or so Greg said. It wasn’t Sherlock’s fault this made John feel morally inadequate.
“Men are curs,” John said, honestly. He started setting the table, happy to be on the receiving end of a cooked meal rather than its chef.
“I was in an advertisement once--” Anderson jogs to keep up with the producer and her team as they hurry to follow Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson down a blustery boatyard just off the river Thames. Anderson sports a swollen nose, two candles of tissue paper stuck up either nostril.
things: a passing suspicion about Mary and Sherlock that was easily dispelled, a strange jealousy about the passing suspicion that wasn’t so easy to shake off, and a desperate warmth around John’s midsection at the thought of Sherlock as being a part of their family.
Greg clears his throat in the background and Molly mumbles to a stop, her face recolouring. She gives the camera another shy smile.
“Yes, the science of--”
“And?” John prompted, confused by the direction of Sherlock’s thoughts. The case had been a distraction, after all, maybe even a fake. Hadn’t it?
John smiled. “That’s—I’m really happy for you. Yeah, Greg’s... He’s a decent bloke.”
John nodded, too emotional to speak. “John,” Sherlock repeated. He pressed closer, pressed small, soft kisses to John’s face until John pulled their lips together. These kisses were deeper, longer. No longer searching, but finding.
John leaned forward and kissed Sherlock. It was the only thing to do, really, under the circumstances, and judging by Sherlock’s hungry response, John gauged that he agreed.
– he’d fostered more hope about how/what Sherlock felt about him than he’d wanted to consider. Maybe a part of him believed, as he relaxed into the reassuring timbre of Sherlock’s whispered voice night after night, that he, John, had a shot and wasn’t just pining away like the middle-aged fart he was. John kept returning to Sherlock’s best man speech, to Sherlock comforting him after everything, his hand trembling where it rested on the back of John’s neck...
“No harm no foul, Dr. Watson,” said Sherlock, voice inscrutable.
“I...” Sherlock sighed, drummed his fingers, sighed again. “Mycroft,” he said, face souring. “He told me about the sleeping pills. I—I thought perhaps in your exhaustion, you’d taken a few too many, and...”
Molly, bless her heart, was great about it. She rushed over to sit beside him on the couch with no hesitation, and she let him weep into her nice green jumper with so much patience and compassion that John felt even shittier by comparison. It felt like it went on for ages, but it probably wasn’t longer than five minutes.
“Right,” Greg says, glancing at the camera once before remembering that he is supposed to pretend that it isn’t there. When the producer had first told him about ‘fly on the wall’ reality television, Greg had snorted and said, “I got it.” Fly on the wall? Until four months ago he’d just called it ‘being married.’
John returned to the office in a daze. Taking pity on him, Sarah offered to take his two o’clock and directed him to the kitchen to thaw. John felt a pang of guilt at her concern. She probably thought it was about Mary. God, Mary! His wife hadn’t even been dead a year, and here her dearest, cheating husband was, pining for the only other person he’d really loved in the last five years. What would she have said?
After a critical once-over that absolutely did not arouse John, Sherlock had pronounced that what John needed was more cases; and so for two weeks, their case load increased exponentially. Sherlock took whatever case he could, and between the two of them, they solved a murder, two robberies, a missing person case, and a $3 000 000 fraud. They also found the secret ingredient to Angelo’s mushroom risotto, which they used to blackmail endless helpings of said risotto from him. Yet still John couldn’t fall asleep.
Sally smarts professionally at the camera before spinning away, saying, “Oh for God’s
The door opens. There is a comical moment of panic when both DI Dimmock and Sherlock Holmes realise they are about to make bodily contact and throw themselves into different directions: Dimmick into the door frame and Sherlock Holmes into his doctor friend.
“John,” Sherlock gasps, delighted,
“Work relationships never last,” he tells them. He does not appear to notice that there is a pencil with a pink heart-shaped eraser on one end stuck behind his left ear.
!” the man snapped.
John cleared his throat. “Well. I thought, with what happened with Eurus, maybe you and Sherlock...”
And then he found Sherlock’s ASMR channel.
(Day 4)
Having children didn’t automatically make you a good parent, or even a good person, but it did make you want to
, they’d have to cover that ground, and they’d hate it, but it would be too important not to do it.
“Oh for God’s sake!” snaps a baritone off-screen. A frown appears between John's eyebrows.
for him anymore, John thought, stomach churning. And honestly, could he blame them?
“The disillusionment’s already set in,” said Sherlock.
I dream of you, to wake: would that I might
The video was in John’s history on YouTube. He tapped through to the channel itself – Casebook ASMR. It had just over five hundred subscribers – not a lot, by ASMRtist standards. John scrolled back. There were about half a dozen videos. The first one had been posted several months ago, at least two months before John had listened to his first ASMR video.
“I—What makes you think I haven’t got anywhere to be?”
Molly’s smile hesitates. “His—his partner?”
He remembered the wedding speech. He remembered Sherlock crowding the doorway. Following him on dates. Sherlock in the boot of Mrs Hudson’s car, strung out and frightened. Sherlock with his sister. Sherlock’s face at the top of the well. Sherlock curled into a protective ball against his fists.
Rosie blinked at him. A gummy smile had appeared at the word “Shit”.
Sherlock poured them each a glass. The wine was good, smooth and fruity. John waited until Sherlock had settled before he offered Rosie a spoonful of food. Apparently, she was satisfied enough that Sherlock wasn’t about to do anything interesting outside of her range of sight that she ate without complaint or distraction, little fists banging on the table. It was only when a bite dribbled on to her shirt that John realised he’d forgotten the bib. Ah well.
“Well, there’s your problem.” John deliberately placed a hand on Sherlock’s hip; Sherlock’s body jerked, but his eyes swept John’s face, his expression tremulous. Relief, hope, fear, and loneliness flitted across Sherlock’s face as he apparently struggled for a measure of control. “You started from the wrong presupposition,” John said.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed. “Well,” he said and paused when a good excuse failed to present itself.
It was either that or prison – but this is more interesting. So which was it, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
Sherlock turned to face him. He was dressed as usual: white shirt, black suit, the big coat, the red scarf. But he looked much the same as the last time John had seen him—no, worse, actually. His hair was messy, and there was a shadow of stubble across his jaw and over his top lip. His eyes were red-rimmed, puffy and roaming.
Sherlock had turned around, face inscrutable. John couldn’t tell whether Sherlock believed him, and he felt weirdly guilty about it. He should just have told Sherlock his real motivation, John decided. But try as he might, as Sherlock walked him and Rosie down to the foyer,
himself from Sherlock, not remind him of it with every word written.
“A doctor,” said a deep male voice, “how
Before John had a chance to respond as if he knew
“Isn’t it customary?” Sherlock asked, following John halfway into the kitchen, one hand pocketed, the other drumming a beat onto his thigh.
Since most of the equipment was already set up and stashed in John’s bedroom, it only took about ten minutes to get the camera and audio set up going. The frame focused on the kitchen table, but was angled low so neither his nor Rosie’s face would be visible. John had few expectations about the quality of the video, but he thought at the very least it ought to make a good ambient track, and so he got everything ready before he started the process of making breakfast.
(Day 1)
“Is it difficult being a woman in the police force?” Sally repeats the producer’s question. Her arms are crossed and her curls are dishevelled: there’s still some dust caught in them. In the background crime techs meander about, now cataloguing the new corpse.
John checked the peephole and was rewarded with a close-up of Sherlock’s face as he peered back at him. Of course it would be Sherlock. Few other people visited John at home. Greg sometimes came over, usually on weekends, and Molly had visited once or twice. But mostly, that was just how the universe worked, right? Murphy’s law and all that.
“Now what?” he wanted to know, trying and failing to see the point of this.
“Everything alright?” John startled. Sarah had popped her head into the kitchenette again and was frowning at him.
“Isn’t that blasphemy?” wondered Sherlock.
“One of the
John was truly sad to see her go. He and Rosie walked her down, waved goodbye, and watched her until she’d disappeared around the corner. John wondered glumly if he was doomed to be forever waving goodbye to people from his stoop, which even he had to admit was a bizarre and miserly turn of thought.
“Thanks, but it’s hard enough to get drunk after forty without sharing your alcohol,” he shouted over the din, with a self-deprecating smile.
“John?”
Sherlock made a noise somewhere in his throat and scanned John’s face. If he was hoping to disprove John’s statement, John knew he would find nothing to do so. Not anymore.
social bonding.
“John? John!”
John gave Sherlock a look. “So where are you off to?” he asked instead, taking in his posh ensemble: the big coat, the bespoke suit, the navy shirt, the fancy shoes. Granted, John was hardly an expert on these things, but Sherlock looked even better than usual.
John shook his head, trying to put himself back together. “Give him space. Give myself space.”
“I know who he is,” she says, a little too hastily. There is a second of silence before she clears her throat, a renewed blush burning on her cheeks. “I’ve only known him a few months,” she says.
“I’m guessing that pub on Henrietta,” Sherlock said. “That’s where you usually go, isn’t it?”
“Chateau Fongrave Black Merlot Bordeaux, 2008?” John read the label.
The producer is screaming.
, instead carrying Rosie off to her flat. John watched his daughter go with trepidation. She didn’t cry for him.
John readjusted his butt on the squeaky office chair and checked the clock on the wall. “Summary: sin equals bad.”
He raps three times, then stoops forward to listen. When he straightens, tense nods are exchanged, belt buckles are touched, shoulders are primed. He takes three steps back, braces himself, and rushes forward.
It was one of the women whose eyes he’d caught; tall, dark-haired, early forties. She had a raspy smoker’s voice and absolutely no business looking as good in red as she did. She was smiling a very particular smile, and despite himself, John felt the stirrings of a challenge accepted as she sidled closer.
“As I understand it, he has a unique investigative style,” the producer tries.
He was first out of the office that afternoon. The five-minute walk to Rosie’s crèche became three, and they made the five-twenty train to Hackney. Rosie, perhaps sensing John’s mood, was a little more exuberant than usual, but John felt only a little guilty when he parked her in front of a children’s show so he could pull up the video again, this time with clamshell headphones on (acquired a week before from Amazon). She seemed content with Shaun the Sheep’s adventures over his distracted company anyway.
At his age, “going out” was mostly visiting a local pub on a Friday night in a better set of clothing than usual, so that was what John did.
“--even as New Scotland Yard struggles along in his wake--”
“Maybe we should...” a female mumble suggests off-screen, while Greg blushes, swears and apologises.
“So it is,” Sherlock noted, but he was harder to hear.
John stifled a sigh. The voice on the other end sounded posh, irritated, deep and sexy, but mostly irritated. John could relate; he found his enthusiasm for winning souls waning rather starkly after five hours straight of calls to complete strangers, many of them abusive.
“And how long have you known his partner, Dr. Watson?” the producer queries.
Sherlock’s gaze shifted to his from where it had been hovering on Rosie.
“What do you want?” John demanded, but much of the heat had gone out of it. He sat down, keeping as far away from the few other people as possible. And, there really was a bloody delay.
“I defy the hardest soldier to--” But John was distracted by the pastel-pink clock on the wall. “Jesus!” It was past eight am. He was late for work. Rosie was late for crèche.
side, rather than in the middle of the bed; and then, unbidden, an image of Sherlock came to him, tousled in his pyjamas. What would it be like, he wondered, to share a bed with Sherlock?
“Good night,” John told the man brightly, “and God bless!”
“I love you,” he whispered against John’s chest. John’s fingers froze from where he’d been carding through his curls. “It’s a poor excuse, and I...” Sherlock sighed, a forlorn motion that John felt echo somewhere deep inside himself. “I love you.”
wanted at seven pm on this Friday night was to spend three hours of it somewhere other than bed. “Maybe two. I’ll probably be back before nine. Or half-eight.”
“If by ‘Lord and Saviour’ you mean the fiction created by the simple-minded to cope with the crushing immensity of a cold and impersonal universe--” the man began, his tone dismissive and contemptuous and bored, and whose voice could do all that at once, anyway?
“Your evangelism technique,” Sherlock responded dryly, drawing a bark of laughter from John. But even as he laughed he was thinking that he shouldn’t. That he should ring off and forget this conversation and forget this man, before… Well, before he
There’s a bit of a silence.
“I’d better put her down,” he told Sherlock. His voice sounded distant to his own ears. He only really came to when he’d laid Rosie down. Toys made unfathomable shapes in the darkness, but she slept peacefully, blissfully unaware that friends could so easily become monsters.
“Yes?” He relaxed his hands to his chest. John placed one of his on top, weaving their fingers together.
“I’m sure that’s not true,” John said on reflex, but amended it: “No, of course you have one, it’s just buried under a lot of wank.”
“Aha!” Sherlock said. “
“How on earth is this happening?” John demanded. “Where’d you get my number?”
It was also incredibly lucky that his new boyfriend (his term; Sherlock simply spoke of John as “his”, like it was a full sentence, and maybe it was) was also into the making of and listening to ASMR. Almost
“You’ve met someone,” Sherlock decided, with narrowed eyes.
Words apparently failed him. Sherlock swallowed and stared at John hard, almost desperately. As if willing him to do something.
John smiled. Moving slowly, he rose on his feet so he could kiss Sherlock once, gently.
Nope.
“Hello sir,” John said into his headset, “do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ?”
Come Monday, John was feeling...well, not
“Thanks!” John shouted to the bartender, taking the two beers from her. He craned around for Sherlock, but he was nowhere to be seen. John strongly considered abandoning both drinks and making a break for it, but then someone said, “Need some help with those?”
“Would you mind?” John said, half-up from the sofa already, proffering Rosie to Sherlock. She wiggled her approval at this change of hands. “I just want to use the loo.”
He shook his head. “I don’t think he does, honestly.” This came out more bitterly than he’d anticipated.
“Yes, Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective.”
No sir.
Flustered, annoyed, and most of all, lonely, John distracted himself by making a start on a rudimentary dinner for himself and Rosie. He had just checked that Rosie was still alive (she was, and enjoying Peppa Pig with alacrity) when there was a knock on the door. John turned down the oven and moved the dish to the table, a sinking feeling in his stomach.
But the line went dead as John said it. He stared at his mobile like an idiot for a second or two before depositing it in his pocket with a sigh. The train had rolled in, smelling faintly like oil and dust and takeaways, a smell that took John back to his uni days.
John felt decidedly underwhelming, dressed as he was in comfortable but faded jeans and an oatmeal jumper that had seen better days.
“Tell me about it,” she returned. She leaned against the bar and gave him a very obvious up-and-down. “Who’s the other beer for?”
“I wanted to get flowers,” John said. He followed her down a short hallway and into a combined kitchen/dining room that was just on the wrong side of cramped. Something smelled delicious. “But they were all shit. I mean – uh, bad.”
A week passed. Sherlock was quiet, but whereas their silences had been companionable before, this time it felt different. After a bit of a think, John decided it must be because Sherlock wasn’t texting him. The vague feeling of guilt was back. It nagged at John. He carefully recounted their conversation in quiet moments – okay, maybe the word he was looking for was “obsessed” - he “obsessed” over their last conversation - but he didn’t know why or where it had gone wrong, exactly.
“Sally—I mean Sergeant Donovan—find out the last time the coppers were called out here to break up a fight, anything like that. And tell Anderson--”
“He uses the science of deduction,” John says.
John stared at his reflection in the vanity mirror above the sink. He looked exactly like a forty-something who had slept properly for the first time in weeks, on a sofa: dishevelled, a bit grey, a bit pasty. It had been months since he’d gone out. He spent his days working or helping Sherlock with cases; his nights and weekends he spent holed up with Rosie, or taking her to play parks or out on walks if the weather was alright. He knew several children shows’ tunes by heart. He hadn’t watched a rugby match, drank a whiskey, or flirted outrageously in ages.
Sherlock’s eyes were on Rosie. “I...needed a break,” he said. “I thought you’d be home.”
“Not really a wide margin of escape,” Greg comments. “If John hadn’t wrestled Idleman off of you...”
that, and there was no denying that his
? No, never mind, boring: failed architect by the look of your shoes, knew someone in television, about to be divorced for the third time in what, ten years?”
“Dr. Watson speaking,” he answered, trying not to let his grimace colour his tone.
“Yeah, no,” said John, and jingled the keys.
“Yeah him,” John said, rolling his eyes to no one in particular. The small office was empty save him, a computer, a lamp, a fern, the cold dregs of a cup of coffee, and the atheist on the other end of the line.
“I really, really did,” John laughed.
John shrugged but said, “I’m fine.”
Sherlock snaps, spinning around to glare at the pair of them, doing so just in time to miss the rapid ascent of a livid-faced man through the window. The intruder wields a knife.
John almost dropped his tablet when Sarah returned, another of their co-workers with her. John hastily made his excuses and returned to his office where, for the next three hours, he tried to ignore the lure of the tablet in his satchel.
“That’s very reckless of her.” The woman flashed a lascivious smile. “Abandoning you like that. She might never get you back.”
“Re—relationship?” she stutters. She glances at Greg. He shrugs.
of a coincidence.”
Energised, John pulled up the forum that had first put him onto ASMR.
“I’m not here to...that.” John sighed at himself.
The man was smiling at him, a barely-there kind of smile that verged on a smirk. It so clearly said “Gotcha!” He had a sheaf of pamphlets in one gloved hand. Rearranging his features into a polite expression, he handed John one.
“Wait – you phoned me thinking I might be an ex-convict?” John asked Sherlock, just as a woman entered John’s immediate vicinity. She gave him a look and pointedly put a few paces between them.
“Well, isn’t that worth pursuing?”
“Yeah, something gave it away,” John muttered. “You know, a simple ‘no’ might have sufficed.”
dark whisper –
“Hmm?” Sherlock’s hands were flat against each other, the tips of his long fingers resting against his lips. His eyes were closed.
Sherlock. Even burying his, well, his love – John could do that. If that was what Sherlock needed, if that was what their friendship needed, John could do that.
“Is that good?” Sherlock asked, sounding genuinely puzzled.
No one could blame John Watson for having sleepless nights. War veteran, doctor, colleague and boyfriend of Sherlock Holmes, and perpetually spied upon by the two most astute agents in British intelligence history (Mrs Hudson and Mycroft Holmes, in that order); no, in his insomnia at least John Watson was blameless.
The street outside, though still busy, was an oasis of calm compared to the pub. John pulled in a few deep, cold breaths, then made his way to where the Vantage was parked, thinking he’d just text Sherlock and wait for him. He felt cranky: annoyed with himself, annoyed with Sherlock for disappearing, annoyed with the woman in the red dress. Mostly himself, though.
“Are you Dr. John Watson?” the producer’s off-screen voice asks the tall man’s companion. He stands absolutely still, hands folded behind his back and shoulders rigid. He doesn’t acknowledge the camera.
The flat was quiet. In the background, the city slumbered as much as the city ever did. It had started raining again. John’s fingers steadily tapped their way through the backlog of admin. Pretty soon he had managed to forget that he was on camera, and it wasn’t until he’d finished that he realised he’d have to find a decent way to end the video. He smoothed over the files; then, feeling melodramatic, he closed the laptop lid and gently snapped off the lamp. Only to snap it back on immediately so he could start processing the recording.
it to be like that anymore and wasn’t quite sure when the change had occurred.
remind him of Mary. Remembering someone’s suggestion from the forum, he hit pause so he could go rummage out a pair of tangled earphones from the drawer in his bedside table. Returning, he plugged them into the tablet and settled down again on the living room couch, tapping play with a stubby and determined finger.
But John suspected the answer to that; had, ever since he fell into a fitful sleep in a too-big bed the week before. She had known, must have known. Her more caustic remarks made sense to him now. He wondered suddenly whether they’d made sense to Sherlock. They must have, right? He was the consulting detective after all. And if it hadn’t bothered him enough to say anything back then – and he’d always been woefully, sometimes frustratingly silent about people’s insinuations – then perhaps it didn’t bother him now.
Sleepy, John turned off his tablet and retired to bed, feeling guilty in a non-specific way – like he’d been caught doing something lewd. It had started raining outside. He turned over a few times, finally settling on his side. He noticed for the first time that he still slept on
“No,” John said. “Not ‘no’,” he amended, when Sherlock’s eyes snapped up, “I mean, it’s just...you hate pubs.”
lucky.
When the cameras roll again, the three men are arranged in a more traditional configuration: arms folded (Dimmock), hands pocketed (Sherlock), wrists clasped behind backs (John). There is only light panting. The penny has been put away.
, yes,” Molly said, releasing Rosie to the vast carpet of joy and mystery and toys. She immediately crawled over to her favourite blocks.
“Did I—did I misinter--” Sherlock looked ridiculously vulnerable, just then, dishevelled, his eyes deep and distracted, lips kiss-bright. John felt such a wave of emotion pass over him that it took him a second to speak.
“If I were a cynical man,” John said, “I’d say
“What?” he asked, thinking that there was no way Sherlock could possibly deduce--
“Who is she?” Sherlock watched John.
Yes, things were going better for John Watson than they had in a long time. He had put the strongest of his strange feelings about Sherlock to bed, he was working hard, his daughter was happy, and yes, even
“There’s no need to apologise.” Molly said this sternly, and John realised with a dull pang that this was probably something she’d had to tell herself often. “I’m glad you told me. I hate to think you’ve been walking around with this all this time.”
John stepped closer again, stilling Sherlock’s large hands. “There’s a lot we have to talk about. These last few weeks, for one. These last few years, for another.” John moved his hands so he was holding Sherlock’s. The touch felt...good. Natural.
Molly’s eyes were mostly on Rosie as she said, “It’s...Well, me and...” She sighed and looked at John, grinning and blushing. “Greg’s asked me to move in with him.”
sexual, but how would it look to outsiders – falling asleep to a gorgeous woman whispering to you? It was, at the very least, a little odd.
Anticipating Amazon’s delivery schedule, John had set the surgery as his delivery address, and so Monday saw the receptionist, George, receive a suspicious number of packages addressed to John Watson. “Retail therapy?” Sarah asked as John and George carted the boxes to the staff room. John nodded. He had a vague but persistent suspicion that Sarah thought he was buying sex toys en masse. Depending on who you asked, John supposed ASMR was technically weirder.
John rang off and started the tedious process of untangling himself from the headset and shutting the computer off. Just before he clicked the program they used closed, it began flashing with an incoming call. John checked the number against the printout he’d been using. Sure enough, it was Irritated Trombone.
“What’s going on?” John’s voice was sleep roughened, but calm – in action mode. “Are you alright?” he asked Sherlock when he didn’t respond, his belly crawling with worry.
“Yes, hello, darling,” John told her, leaning in for a kiss. He was only a little surprised to notice how close this brought him to Sherlock, and how comfortable that proximity was, after all. “Are you a hungry little bee?” he asked her, turning to dish up.
A distraction, John thought, absent-mindedly chewing at his nails, staring off into the middle-distance. He needed a distraction. A new job? But John liked where he worked; the salary was great, it was close to his flat and to Rosie’s crèche, and after another year he could start the process of becoming a partner at the clinic. So, no new job, not unless he absolutely had to.
The screen showed a man’s arms resting, large hands folded, on what looked like a desk. John could see little beyond the man’s torso, just his white button-up shirt, and an indistinguishable sliver of background on either side. Still, John had the strangest sense that he knew where this was—that he knew...
“So what’s the case?” he asked instead, arranging their mugs and dropping teabags into them with the wary resignation that seemed to mark so much of his friendship with the world’s most infuriating and difficult man.
“Pardon me,” said a deep voice. John followed it up a lanky, well-dressed frame to an intelligent face that was all lips and cheekbone, angular planes topped with dark, artfully disheveled curls.
Sherlock hesitated, then grinned. “In that case, you’d better drive,” he said, “as it’s the only action you’ll be getting tonight.”
“Right,” John said, deciding not to take the bait. “So I’ll try to be back in a couple of hours,” he told Mrs Hudson. “Three,” he added, trying to convince himself as he said it that what he
John met Sherlock’s eyes. He’d once thought them inscrutable, but it was easier all the time to see the kernel behind the shell. “Yes,” John said. “As I’m sure you’ve deduced, James Sholto and I were... Well.” John fed Rosie a last bite, knowing that if he attempted any more, she’d just find clever ways to outmanoeuvre him. “We... Wanted to, I guess.” John stared at the table, unseeing. He was remembering their time together in Afghanistan. The potential. The missed moments, the lingering smiles, the warmth John had carried around inside himself. “But circumstances...” John’s smile felt bitter on his face. “We never...” He shook his head and pushed his plate away.
he shouts at Greg, jabbing a finger at him. “You attacked me with a melon!”
Sherlock was mostly in shadow, but it wasn’t hard to identify the nervous energy running through him – he had trouble standing still. John stood aside to let him in, snapping on the light and shutting the door behind the consulting detective, who walked wordlessly into the middle of the room and then stood peering around like he’d never been there before, looking lost.
“I don’t hate pubs,” Sherlock countered immediately, which was an outrageous lie.
Sherlock’s face flickered before he settled on “brazen”: “You said something about dinner. Well, here--”
“John!” he shouts with a violent twitch, emerging from a drizzle of napping, scaring everyone but the doctor in question.
Maybe this time, John thought, angry at himself for the self-pity but simultaneously unable to stop it – maybe this time they’d have more success shooting at him.
By the time John returned, Sherlock had left.
John chuckled, rummaging around a drawer for a stopper. “No idea. Mary could have told you.” She had been a real wine snob.
Hesitantly, Sherlock lifted their joined hands to kiss John’s knuckles. “I’d like that,” he whispered against John’s skin.
“I don’t sense an impending conversion,” John pointed out, his tone so dry it chafed on the way out. He glanced at the clock again. “Besides, I have to--”
But John had learned from Mary. He knew Sherlock was lying.
To her credit, Molly tried. But she couldn’t keep the laughter in, which set John off. Rosie screeched, delighted to have amused them.
He slept not a wink.
Sherlock’s facial expression was inscrutable.
.” She side-eyes the camera.
“I don’t have any sleeping pills,” John said. “And I wouldn’t do that,” he added, answering the question he thought Sherlock was really asking.
John spent much of his free time the rest of the week figuring out everything he’d bought, and orderings things he hadn’t thought he would need, but did. By the end of the week, with twinkling Christmas displays and tinkling Christmas music shadowing his every movement out of doors, John had recorded a few “test runs” and figured out the nettling software. And he was actually sleeping, dropping off late every night, exhausted; but, as he’d hoped, he was fully distracted.
Sherlock was... In some ways, he was hard to look at. He looked come undone like something was shaking loose inside of him. He was frantic and, John realised with horror,
But he erased it again.
“Yeah,” John said, clearing his throat a little. “I mean, we work together well.”
It was, John thought, both endearing and horrifying to see Sherlock try to phrase something so
“Do you think their disparate personalities complement their relationship?”
, anyway, someone knocked on the front door.
“You said you couldn’t come over for dinner,” John pointed out. “And I quote, ‘Case’.”
For a moment, John could see himself doing that again. There was always a company looking for ex-soldiers, and he was a doctor to boot. There’d be people to take care of Rosie. Some would argue – the darkly amused whisper that was part-Mary, part-John’s guilt, for instance – that Rosie would be better off being raised by someone else.
But they weren’t like that, John thought. He was only mildly surprised to find that he wasn’t pretending he didn’t
“It was overripe,” John notes.
“Wow,” John said, as the full flavour of the nappy hit him. Patience had taught him to let the smell wash over him, but one never really got used to it. “You could be a little more contrite,” he told Rosie, who was giggling, feckless, at his wrinkled nose, “about putting your dear old dad through
Teletubby?” he asked, mock-serious, finally deigning to collapse into the armchair.
Sherlock was leaving – had already left. He had some assignment ahead of him, one he probably took to give John a window. Really, if you thought about it, it was a kindness. This perversely made John feel even worse because he wasn’t actually enough of a dick to be angry at Sherlock for being
a forty-one-year-old seamstress from Leeds as they claim to be on their Facebook profile, but rather an enterprising fifteen-year-old who accepts Bitcoin in exchange for ‘organically’ promoting YouTube content. I’d noticed that you liked a lot of their suggestions, so...”
“Sherlock,” John said, “I--”
“Did you really record hours of footage in what—a few days? On the off-chance that I’d find it, and then what?”
“A penny!” shouts Sherlock excitedly, arm snapping up in triumph, a dusty penny pinched between his thumb and forefinger.
It was on a Thursday during lunchtime. John had gabbed the gab with Sarah in the clinic’s tiny staff kitchen before pulling out his packed lunch and his tablet, looking for a video to line up for that night. He had gotten into the habit of frequenting the forum that first put him onto ASMR – even going so far as to create an account, though he rarely commented – and he was browsing through this when a post caught his attention. OMG, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS GUYS VOICE, the title read.
Unless, of course, it
A case, Sherlock had said. One he couldn’t talk about and had to solve.
“Yes, a ‘consulting detective’,” John confirms.
“I’m a shit parent,” John sighed, resigned.
“Or a retired soldier,” Sherlock said, all innocence.
“Middling,” John said, trying to keep the last hour out of his voice. God knew how successful he was. Not very, judging by Sherlock’s frown. “You brought wine,” he said instead.
“I did meet someone.” John watched Sherlock absorb this information. Before he could get the wrong idea, John added, “Half a dozen years ago, in a lab. My friend Mike introduced us.”
The first thing John did was type out an email to Ella’s office to bump up his next appointment. John fetched his laptop to do so because typing up anything other than texts on an iPhone was an infuriating exercise. When he had finished – unnecessarily reading it through twice before sending – it was still only a quarter to five. He sighed and cracked his neck, the laptop casting tinny light over the shadowy kitchen.
The conversation didn’t recover. They exchanged generalities; Sherlock offered to help with the dishes in a half-hearted way, but John batted him away, and after a short sit in the living room, their attention taken up by Rosie, Sherlock left, murmuring a goodnight that sounded like he was already all the way back to Baker Street.
Forty-four going on eighty, he thought, sour. He only noticed the figure when he was nearly on top of him. Sherlock leaned against the car’s bonnet, apparently lost in thought. The bright tip of a cigarette glowed from near his hand.
Sherlock, apparently deciding to pick his battles (!), disappeared into the living room and returned a moment later with Rosie. She hiccuped on his hip, stuffed bee in hand, giving a little squeal when she saw John.
The camera pans from the slim, dishevelled back of Sherlock Holmes to take in the paper tacked wall absorbing his attention. The rest of the flat gets a once-over, showing scatters of books, papers, and bric-a-brac. There is a skull on the mantelpiece, dejected beneath a Monopoly board speared to the wall with a penknife.
“And much as I want to...” John decided not to finish the thought, because he’d just noticed that his arousal wasn’t the only one at the party. “I think--”
Sherlock’s torso was back in view. With his earphones on, John could hear the satisfying crinkle of Sherlock’s clothing as he moved. There were background sounds like cars and rain, but Sherlock’s voice – smooth and deep and soft – easily occupied all of John’s attention. His enunciation sent shivers of relaxation down John’s neck and spine. It felt like Sherlock was in the room with him, delicately enumerating the qualities and characteristics of different kinds of tobacco ash into the shells of John’s ears.
“Routine’s – yeah, routine’s good, or so they say.”
“I’m surrounded,” John told Rosie, powdering her butt, “by people who are not always as clever as they think they are. Yes, I am,” he cooed, as she giggled (baby powder being one of the many, many things that amused her). “Yes, I am!”
“Well-oiled,” Sherlock repeated, almost to himself, rearranging Rosie’s blocks in a fresh configuration. He didn’t meet John’s eyes.
tussles Idleman, before John socks him in the nose.
Molly smiled at John’s stupid joke because Molly was a good and kind person, and John had never really given her credit for that before. And being good and kind, she let him pretend his face wasn’t blotchy with heartbreak, and helped him change the subject, and fussed about Rosie, and stayed an hour longer just being an adult, being someone else in John’s life.
John nodded. His voice was husky. “Now if you’d started from the assumption that I
“You’re having me on,” John returned, sceptical. “How could you possibly know how long I’ve been doing this?”
It is Mr. Idleman, murderer at large! The producer shrieks. The cameraman stumbles back. Idleman snarls at Sherlock, catching him off-guard. In the confused jumble of frames, John leaping Idleman away from Sherlock and socking him in the balls is just visible.
It was lucky, then, that John had found a “cure” for his insomnia in the guise of ASMR, both the making of and the listening to.
Sherlock fiddled with his phone. “Unless you’d rather I didn’t?”
he felt it. And he’d never really been able to pin down exactly how
“Yet here we are.”
John was aware of nothing but dreamless sleep when he startled awake, his heart pounding.
“--and I was an understudy for our high school rendition of Hamlet, so you could say I’m used to--” Anderson loses his beanie to the wind but doesn’t appear to notice.
research, owing to the fact that he was single and Rosie was content with sitting on his lap, watching his belaboured typing and clicking with amusement and interest – John bought a variety of electronic things, including but not limited to microphones, cables, an HD camcorder and its accessories, and professional editing software. The total amount was startling, but steady employment and a chunk of inheritance from Mary meant he could squeeze his eyes shut and click “Pay” without worrying about the roof over their heads.
Sherlock had arranged the Chinese on the dining table when John came up, Rosie chattering in his ear. Without comment, Sherlock took her over and got her settled in her high chair so John could peel off his coat and turn on the kettle. He was halfway through busily arranging their cups and calling down to Mrs Hudson to hear if she was joining them when he realised how automatic it had all been. How natural.
The “unless” came about the Wednesday after. John had taken his lunch to a local park. The December chill was significant enough that it meant he had the pick of the prime benches. He took one next to the little splash of pond, a steely and unattractive grey under the overcast sky. John burrowed deeply into his coat and scarf and didn’t even pretend to consider eating; just sat there and brooded on an empty stomach, freezing his arse off.
“And that’s all?” There was no heat in the question because John had let go of expectation. Therapy was paying off in all sorts of unexpected ways. It was vexing.
“Let’s go to bed. To sleep,” he clarified when confusion flashed across Sherlock’s face. “I—if you want,” John added, feeling suddenly self-conscious again.
Sherlock stared at their joined hands. “Keep in mind, I also thought I was battling for your attentions, against Sarah. Sarah!” he scoffed. “It was like we’d gone full circle. I was worried I’d have to invite myself along on your dates again. If there was even the remotest chance, and I lost you, I...” Sherlock shook his head.
– but Mrs Hudson came up then, and the conversation moved on. They were updated on Mrs Turner’s newest lover, Mr Chatterjee’s move back to Birmingham, and the continued absence of tenants for 221C. Mrs Hudson quizzed Sherlock on John’s driving ability (“Capable”, Sherlock said, with a little smirk that made John nervously swallow a larger bite of food than he’d intended), John on his working relationship with Sarah (“We’re, uh, amicable, yeah,” John had replied, suddenly worrying that they weren’t), and Rosie’s favourite teacher at the crèche (“Ms Plummer,” he and Sherlock had answered at the same time). When Mrs Hudson finally went to “bed” (coincidentally at the same time Geordie Shore started), John felt characteristically like he’d been through an interrogation.
He boarded, giving the other commuters a wide berth. The train was half-empty, with only a few seats taken. He sunk into a seat with a twinge of discomfort, wondering about the man he’d just spoken to.
Sherlock spared him a half-grin. “Well? What
“--and we’re looking forward to catching his moment of triumph on film. Indeed, observing Mr. Holmes at work has been a marvel. That he’s a genius is indisputable--”
All that remained was for John to publish the video to his channel. Here he hesitated. He hadn’t thought of a title for it. “Catching up work” he typed, but then edited it to read, “Let’s catch up work together”. He liked that. It summarised why he was making ASMR and who he was making it for – people who were lonely, who missed the fuss of living with others.
“I think he’s trying to be nice to me.” John’s eyes were unfocused; he was looking inward, back to their last conversation, and to the revelation he had had in the frozen park. “I think he’s realised that I...” He blew out a breath. “That I have feelings for him. I think he’s trying to give me an out because obviously he doesn’t feel the same way.”
. John almost sent that one but realised who he was plagiarising at the last moment, mortified. He almost gave up, and maybe if his stomach hadn’t been a large, miserable churn, he would have. But it was, and so he tried again:
John released a long, shaky breath. A breath he’d been holding since the day he’d first met Sherlock and reassured him that it was all “fine” when, in fact, it had been far from bloody
“Well, if you want to talk it over...” They were silent, waiting for the kettle to boil. Tea made, John carried it into the sitting room, Sherlock trailing behind. He didn’t sit – kept moving around with Rosie. Rocking her to sleep, John realised.
John plopped Rosie in place before embarking on the occult ritual of “What toy is most likely to keep her from screaming her head off?” While he put various toys in front of her, he asked, “You weren’t planning a family?”
Sherlock chuckled. They lapsed into silence. John was waiting for Sherlock to fall asleep when Sherlock spoke again.
John blinks once. “Yes,” he says, clearing his throat when the silence drags on.
John chewed through two bites before he said, “That doesn’t mean it couldn’t work out. I mean,” he amended, when he felt Sherlock’s sharp eyes snap to him, “she was certainly intrigued by you. Sexuality isn’t always...either or, right?”
ways, John had moved on from Sherlock’s “death”. John suddenly wondered what it had been like to walk back into a life that had gone on years without you.
A look crossed Molly’s face. “No,” she insisted, then sighed. “That’s actually why I’m here. I wouldn’t...interfere...but he’s been at the lab an awful lot, and he looks...he looks...”
Sherlock caught John’s movement and froze, halfway out of his jacket.
. “I’ve messed up so much in the past, and I don’t want this to be the same way. I--” John broke off, ducked his eyes. It felt a lot like someone was holding a gun to his head, just then, so frightened was he by what he needed to communicate – so frightened was he that Sherlock would change his mind. “This is too important to... Do you understand?”
Sarah considered him. “Look, John,” she said, moving into the kitchen. “I know we’re not exactly going through the same thing. But if you ever need to chat...”
you, then...”
do it, but not me, gotcha.” The man – Sherlock Holmes – what a name – vibrated smugness.
“He was once attacked with a melon,” says John.
“It’s difficult being a copper, period.” Sally looks at the producer as she’s talking: the camera zooms in on her face. “It’s hard work, hard hours. There’s almost no time for friends and family, so we sort of become each other’s family, you know? We respect each other and we respect the job. So it’s hard when
John felt... John
But now?
Sherlock shook his head and opened his door. “Home, John? We haven’t even gone in yet. Come on.”
“Hmm,” John agreed.
“Jesus Christ!” John startled to consciousness so fast he cricked his neck. He was too slow to catch his tablet before it slid into the crack between the sofa cushions, and struggled a few seconds to disentangle himself from the earphones. He felt a little like a train had hit him.
, Greg, your pen is behind your--”
“God, no,” John admitted.
He looked at John then; a long, clear, intense look. It made John, who was dressed in an old white t-shirt and a pair of shorts, feel uncomfortably exposed. He had to resist the temptation to cross his arms over his chest like he was some scandalised maiden.
Lord, how horrifying was that...and how depressing. Maybe, John admitted to himself –
“Yes, he’s brilliant,” says Dr. Hooper anyway, all in one breath. “He’s just so intelligent, it’s unbelievable, he notices everything and he’s so dedicated and he
“Dr. Watson, you work the graveyard shift of an evangelism ministry on a volunteer basis. You’re single, then, and not just single but unattached. A day-time job with free evenings and you choose to do dial-a-Jesus? You’re either a loner or a zealot, and I don’t think you’re a zealot.”
John didn’t know what to do. Oh, before? Before he’d have waltzed right in and either kicked arse or got his kicked – it hadn’t really mattered, if he were honest. But things had changed.
No, no one could have blamed John Watson for having sleepless nights. But they surely couldn’t begrudge him finding his peace, either.
John sighed and turned his back on the space next to him. It was no use wondering – he was unlikely to ever find out. Maybe like he and Sholto, he and Sherlock had missed their moment; but more realistically, such a moment had just never existed, because Sherlock didn’t feel that for him, and John’s loneliness was making him imagine things.
John pondered.
Sherlock accepted her with a look of such gratitude that John felt like a complete shit. “Me, too,” he murmured, settling her on a hip. John almost didn’t catch it.
Mrs Hudson tutted. “Has daddy been treating this little princess appallingly?” she asked Rosie, who was the epitome of Bambi eyes. Her bottom lip might even have trembled.
“Excellent idea,” came Sherlock’s voice, followed a second later by the man himself. He wound a red scarf around his upturned coat collar as he jogged down the stairs. He swooped in to plop a kiss on Rosie’s head (she squealed with delight) before giving John a once-over. “I can see why she’s upset,” he said cryptically.
It was the last few words that did him in. John started to sob. It was like a dam wall breaking. He was so distraught he didn’t even have room to feel embarrassed or ashamed. All there was, was misery; years and years of it, like crisscrossing scars over an ever-festering wound.
“There was something there, at the beginning.” Sherlock hummed a catch of Vitali’s “Chaconne” to Rosie, who babbled and touched his face.
“I never pegged you as the father type,” Sarah remarked. She pulled the mac and cheese from the oven; the generous cheesy top layer bubbled as she set it on top of the stove. “That’s one of the reasons I went out with you.”
Sherlock wanted. He’d been so sure, over the years, that Sherlock wasn’t like that. He remembered some of the things Sherlock had said...but John also remembered all the times he
“Very well,” Sherlock said, pleased but clearly pretending not to be, “where to start? For one thing, you’re doing telephonic evangelism on a Friday night – no close friends, then, or you’d be out with them – people do that sort of thing I hear – and no partner or you’d be with them.
It was only when Sherlock pulled away so he could begin shucking his clothing that John took a step back, then another, trying to calm his heart. It was trying to beat right out of his chest, and his dick, if he was being honest.
to. Yeah. Shit. Well?” John asked Sherlock, when the man stared at him, frowning. “Do you want to drive home? I mean, Baker Street,” he amended hastily.
As if on queue, Rosie told Molly wisely, “Shit.”
There was a moment of silence. “Turns out I do hate pubs,” Sherlock remarked.
To John’s genuine surprise, the video – which he’d called “Eat breakfast with us [Ambient]” was done and already had a sprinkling of likes. Checking his notifications, John found that his post on the ASMR forum had gained him almost two hundred followers and a bunch of likes on the first video overnight. The comments were all lovely, and so far the only criticism seemed to be about the fact that his face wasn’t visible.
