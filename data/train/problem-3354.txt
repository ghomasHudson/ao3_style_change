“It isn’t yours either. It belongs to Loki, not you.”
“I love you too, Dean,” he whispers in Dean’s ear. “Always have. Always will.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“He loved me Sam. And anyone who loves me gets dead! So of course it’s my fault! I'm the one who wanted to go after Billie when it wasn't even Billie, it was Chuck!” Dean tries to pull himself to his feet but collapses against the wall once again in exhaustion and grief.“And I love him, I’ve always loved him, but I was too much of a fucking coward to tell him that, and now he might never know. He has to come back. I’ll do anything to get him back.”
“Hey want to switch places?” Sam whispers to Dean as he and Eileen enter the room, “We’ve done enough research for a lifetime.”
Cass and Jack both smile and turn to the table. They slowly carve their newly gifted initials in: JW and CW. Their family’s mark on the bunker is finally complete. The next hunters to move in may not know who these people are, or what they did, but they don’t care. This was their home for many years, and now they will be a part of it forever.
This makes Sam smile more. “Well, you’re in for a treat then.”
“Wait, why can’t I come?”
“Ya. Sorry about that. I mean how are you blocking Jack from seeing what happened when Chuck got broken out.”
“That’s going to be a bit hard since we aren’t exactly models of high self-esteem,” Dean grumbles.
With that, Bobby starts chuckling too. “It’s who we are, boys. No retirement for us. Even in death.”
“Oh, I’ve read the Bible. And it’s all complete bullshit. I’ve actually met God. He didn’t give a shit about any of that. In fact, he was bisexual. And so is my brother.”
“Sure but I don’t even know who those people are.”
Sam and Eileen look at each other.
“But we have you guys.” Gabe breaks the tension. “So that’s somethin’ right?”
“Most of the time angels can’t but, like I said that day, you changed me, Dean. You made me more human.”
Finale Time!!! This was 100% made up as I went along. I didn't have any of it planned out so I hope it actually makes sense. Hope you enjoy :)
“I know, Cassie, I’ve died before.”
“Please also think over my offer. If you want to help people, that’s the best way to do it.” Jack turns to Cass. “I need to go back now.”
“That was my question!” Dean says exasperated.
“Ya. We’ll talk about the rest of it when we come back in.”
“Thank you for coming. I’m Micah.” Eileen shakes his hand, then Sam.
“Dude. This is officially the stupidest plan we’ve ever had,” Dean groans.
“Are you sure you don’t want to bring any more back up?”
“That’s fucking insane,” Sam remarks.
“If I’m going to do this, you’re gonna have to uncuff me,” an annoyed Lucifer says.
“We look pretty damn good Sammy,” Dean says as the two brothers stand in front of the mirror in Bobby’s house.
He sighs. “Chuck still hasn’t shown himself since the beginning of the battle and I can’t figure out why Jebediah would use a blade against Jack that wasn’t going to harm his angelic side.”
“Damn, when has that ever happened?”
Jack sits in front of two computers, one showing the footage of Chuck and the other playing The Umbrella Academy. He glances over at the screen with Chuck regularly. After a few episodes, he notices Chuck’s lips moving again and pauses the show to listen. His voice is at almost a whisper but Jack doesn’t need to hear him to know what he’s saying. It’s a prayer, calling out to any angel that is still loyal to him, asking for help. Just as Jack is about to teleport himself in there, another being appears on the monitor. And before Jack can do anything, the being is gone, along with Chuck.
“Dean, I knew you were going to be here. I’ve seen the ways that Castiel dies. And the ways that they could come back. And it always led you to this moment to ask me for my ring, so you can become Death and save them. Whether or not Castiel stays dead doesn’t hinge on my giving you the ring, but on what you do in the Empty and whether or now he leaves with you.”
“You don’t get to play the victim here. You betrayed me, not the other way around. You didn’t care about me, you just wanted to use me. Now take me back, now.”
“Where is he?” Sam stops laughing altogether.
“What are their names?”
The Shadow snaps their fingers and Lucifer appears in front of Gabriel.
“Release him, Chuck.”
“What plan did you hear?” Dean asks
~~~~~~~~~~
“Dean.” Cass stops him.
“I didn’t have one. We weren’t given names when we were created. They were gifted to us by our commanders as we earned them.”
“Na, my life was already fucked up,” he says laughing sadly. “I was never gonna have a normal life. But you made sure I wasn’t going to go down the path that everyone thought that I was. You believed in me. Thank you.”
The moment is interrupted by the door flying open. “Sam!” Jesse exclaims. “We found Chuck.”
“Okay, I’m hanging up now.”
“I killed their mother.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Michael, you know what he’s done, don’t you?” Sam pleaded
The door closes and Eileen turns to Sam. “I guess we got our guy.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You better be right.” Dean sighs.
“Cass, all that matters right now is that Jack’s okay. You can let yourself relax. Take a deep breath. Have some fun. Get laid.” Dean wiggles his eyebrows.
~~~~~~~~~~
“All I want is peace. Why would I be dreaming about the people I love constantly being in danger?”
“I still can’t believe you named me after a dude.” Cassandra rolls her eyes.
“Okay, well, thanks Jack,” Sam says yawning.
“So is that a yes?” Cass asks.
“Are you sure?” Sam responds.
“No.”
They laugh. “Well, I do.”
“Are you guys prepared to kill him?”
“Well shit.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“How? What happened?”
“Hi Rowena, it’s so good to see you,” Dean says, walking up to give her a hug.
“Sorry.”
“What do we do?” Sam whispers to Dean.
“Coffee would be good,” Cass responds slowly.
“Attacked, a pastor,” Dean repeats slowly.
Before they can continue their silent conversation, Gerald reemerges from the doorway with a piece of paper and a USB, handing both to Sam.
“I’m doing it right now.”
“Bobby you are brilliant,” Sam says as he stands and rushes out of the room.
“Moriah. Why you betraying Heaven.”
“That’s impossible.”
“Yes. Martin. They go out to his hunting cabin for a few days each month.”
“Ya,” she nods. “If everything goes okay I’ll come up after you talk. And if it doesn’t someone has to be able to come save your asses.”
“Not here, I’ll tell you that.”
Sam thinks for a moment before he runs to the other room and returns with a large bucket. He goes back into the dungeon and sets it next to Chuck. “Just until we figure out what to do with you long term.”
Dean wraps his arm around Cass’ shoulders. After a few moments, Dean has to ask, “So what’s with the similar names?”
“It’s time we go too Sam.” Michael says. “Everyone should be back soon so maybe go get ready for their return. People will have questions and will likely be extremely disoriented.”
Sam looks at him with admiration and pity. Jack never got to be a kid, much like him and Dean. “I know Jack.” Sam drew him in for a hug. “I’m so proud of you.” When they separated Jack was smiling with tears in his eyes.
“Are you going to tell me the details or are you gonna leave me hanging?”
“But using a Cambion to betray Heaven is?”
“Believe me. God doesn’t give a damn.”
“Me too.”
~~~~~~~~~~
Cass tears up as he returns the smile. “Thank you.”
“You're right, but that's not what I'm thinking. Our best bet is doing the same thing Chuck did with Amara, we toss him in a cage and throw away the key.” Sam moved closer to Michael. “You and the rest of the archangels helped Chuck do it.”
“Ya,” Sam responds. “Ended okay at least.”
“Pretty much a full renovation. It’s not just reliving memories anymore, you can travel around and see people as well. And the Angels, demons, and monsters who deserve it have a place in Heaven now too.”
“No idea,” Dean responds.
“Well, they’re at peace now. No more running or fighting.” Cass says.
“Jerk.”
“At least we’re trying to save the world, not fuck with college students or escape from family drama.”
“And you people think I’m the idiot,” Gabe says sarcastically.
“Wait, would that work, Sam?”
“Thank you for coming,” Cass says to a man in a black suit, “I’m sorry to interrupt your paradise.”
“How?”
“Yes, it’s heaven, anything you need can just be materialized.”
“This is our house, Gabe.” Dean snaps back. Both of them standing and rebutting their shirts.
It isn’t going well by the looks of it. Chuck’s army is easily overpowering Cass’ just because of sheer numbers. Chuck is nowhere to be seen though. Why would he be? He’s fucking useless. Cass is surrounded by 3 angels and 2 leviathans. Even his extra power boost isn’t cutting it at this point. He’s bleeding from his head and his coat sleeves are both ripped up and bloodied with knife cuts. Jesse and Hades are doing their best to keep Death at bay. Combined their powers are enough to keep her out of the fight and away from the angels that are the main targets in the fight. They’ve already lost one, so Chuck is already powered up to about 10%. That’s probably why they’re going after Cass so hard.
“Love you too Samantha,” Balthazar says.
“How can we make sure?” Sam questions. “I mean we all look alive but, well, aren’t.”
“I’m having them stay in the bunker for the time being.”
“Sorry. But he’s right.” Jesse jumps in. “He doesn’t have it anymore. Permanent power-sharing.”
“Well, hopefully, Jesse and Gabriel figure out where Chuck has been so we can make an actual plan.”
“You’re right, Cass. I couldn’t reciprocate then because you didn’t give me a chance to. You were just gone and I couldn’t process until after.” Dean grabs Cass by the hand, tears in his eyes but a smile forming. “I love you too you idiot. And you are never allowed to do that again. If you ever sacrifice yourself ever again I will come here just to kick your ass. Okay?”
“To where?” Cass says.
“Not in my eyes,” John says. “You two look in your twenties.”
“Well we can’t exactly have every angel go through that process,” Ash says. “Our best bet is finding a way for Jack to expel the power into them.”
Before Jack can disappear Dean speaks up. “Hey before you go, could you help me out with something.”
“He seems to legitimately be struggling and in need of help.”
“Cass. Please.”
“Yes.” Jack places his hand on Cass’ shoulder and they disappear.
“We’re off too.”
“No, I-,” he gulps back tears. “He knew. He had to have known.”
“Not long. He’s stronger than me right now. I can hear him in my head. But he also is constantly hearing me in his.”
“Yes. Normally Carl would have come with me but he passed not long ago.”
“That’s great!” Cass exclaims.
“Maybe I just wanted to meet my grandson-in-law.”
“Mary.”
“Then for now she’s safe. We have time to come up with a plan.” Cass guides Jack to sit at the table. “Just breathe.”
Sam turns off the TV and they all look at him.
“Okay, how about you fill us in on everything you know about Cassiel. Start from how you guys know each other and what you meant with the ‘having their grace’ thing.”
“What are you talking about? Your old man will be proud of all you’ve done.”
Sam swerves in surprise. “Holy shit Jack! You almost gave me a heart attack!”
“Jesse-,” Cass starts.
As they walk, Sam and Dean look around at the people in the audience. Dean immediately recognizes everyone but a man in an all-black suit sitting on the far side. And he definitely has a memorable face, looking like death warmer over and all. “Oh fuck” Dean thinks. “Not now. Not yet.”
“Will do. I’ll update you as things progress.”
“Oh I know,” they turn to Jesse and walk up to him, the others holding their blades out in case they make a move. “And you aren’t either. You’re an even bigger abomination than Jack here.”
“At least it’s a nice area,” Sam says as they all open their doors and look out on the mountain view.
“Hey guys, we need to find a way for Jack to transfer little bits of his power to a bunch of angels. Bobby’s a fucking genius. If there isn’t one God then they can’t just kill Jack and get Chuck his power back. And Jack wouldn’t have to be God anymore.”
“Cass!”
“Well, we have to try. And if it starts harming Jack then we stop.”
She smiles and signs back, “I’ll do my best to not get killed by God again.”
“Okay, whatever you say,” Sam chuckles.
Cass laughs. “My apologies for loving you. Besides, if I hadn’t said all those things the Empty wouldn’t have come, you would all be dead and Chuck would have won.”
“So many have died.”
Cass nods against the side of Dean’s head and they pull away slightly.
“Mom.”
“Wow, that was fast.” Sam remarks as Jack stands in the doorway in silence.
~~~~~~~~~~
“No worse than before,” he answers.
~~~~~~~~~~
“That’s one hell of a long shot Sam, even for you boys. Dean? You’ve been unusually quiet during this discussion, what do you think about this suicide mission? And where is your angel, Castiel? Hypothetically, if we were to do this we would need all the grace we can muster.”
Sam’s voice fades away as Dean starts hearing the beeping again. The beeping is interrupted by an echoey voice.
“Oh really? Have I?” Chuck yells back rather weakly.
Jesse collapses on the chair next to his dog who had just semi-woken up. “It’s not like I gave you the choice. I left for a reason. Because I didn’t want anyone to be burdened with me or put in danger because of who I am.”
“Thanks Sam. Me too. Good luck.” Jesse then turns away and disappears.
“But maybe, since he already has demon blood in him, it won’t affect him as bad,” Sam says.
Cass walks out of the house. “What’s going on Jack?”
“It had to happen, I’m just relieved it worked.”
“Yes. That could work.” The empty walks around Dean, looking him up and down. “What is it with you and this angel? Why would you risk everything for Castiel?” Dean looks down. “Is it friendship?” It stops and whispers in Dean’s ear, “or is it something more?”
“I’m sorry, Edward?” He says in a condescending voice. “Oh, you mean Jennifer.” Sam and Eileen roll their eyes. “Yes, I heard about her death. I’m just sorry she didn’t get a chance to redeem herself in the eyes of God before she passed.”
“What?! He caught me off guard! I didn’t even fully process it until he was gone! Let alone get a chance to tell him how I felt.”
Dean looks at Cass and smiles. “Where’s Garth at then?”
“Good. Just finished lunch a little bit ago and now we’re just catching up some more.”
“I’m doing God’s work. Therefore it isn’t murder.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. The man said he got the thing that did it but I guess not.”
Dean felt cold and grim the moment he entered the Empty. It’s pure blackness around him. Nothing but well… emptiness. He can’t believe this was where Cass had been forced to go to and where he’s been the whole time.
“Ya. Took ‘em long enough.” Sam turns away from Gabe and walks over to Eileen. “Are you gonna be okay here with Bobby?” He signs. “I know you don’t know him all that well.”
Rowena places her hand on the mark and inhales. “I can feel the power coming off of this. Even more so than when it was on you, Dean. It’s probably reacting with his Demon half.”
“Okay.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Just do what you can Bobby. We’ll try and figure out what it is.” Sam says.
“You built this?”
After a few minutes, the door opens and Chuck is led in by an officer.
“I thought we already did win! Or I thought we did. Jack made him human so he wasn’t supposed to be a threat anymore. It was supposed to be over.”
“We both have,” Sam says. “He’s gone radio silent.”
“I guess we return to Heaven and regroup.”
~~~~~~~~~~
As more and more of Chuck’s army shows up, Jesse grabs onto Lucifer by the front of his shirt. “I swear on my life, if you betray us, I will end you.”
“I dunno, did they win?” Donna adds.
Sam runs in shortly after followed by Eileen, “is everyone all right?!”
~~~~~~~~~~
“What could we even do? We don’t have powers or anything.”
“And? Did it work?” Cass asks.
“Just stop talking until Jebediah returns. Then you’re officially his problem.”
Even though it’s only 5:30 it’s pitch black out as Eileen and Sam pull onto the side of the street outside Martin’s house. No light is on in the house and the car that was there earlier is no longer there.
Dean clears his throat. “What about you? I know you already got the retirement thing, but any plans for taking advantage of paradise?”
“I thought you said Jesse was here?”
Cass nods. “Very possible.”
“They just had to choose LA didn’t they,” Kaya whispers to Jack as they scope out the warehouse.
“Where?” Jack asks.
“And what you want to do is eat a PB&J?” Sam laughs.
“No,” Jack answers. “And I’m not sure I want to know cause that means we have another fight ahead of us and I’m just too tired for that.”
“Sorry.”
“Jack created this special feature for me where I kind of see subtitles in my head when people speak.”
“I don’t think he had anything he needed to be redeemed from,” Sam says, towering over the pastor.
“As soon as possible,” Dean responds.
~~~~~~~~~~
“What does your true form look like? I’m curious to know what I just slept with.”
“Hey, I know that look,” Dean says as he nudges Cass with his shoulder. “You still got something nagging at you.”
“Sam, it’s Cass. I have to do whatever it takes to get him back to us. To me.” Dean pulls Sam into a hug. “It’ll be ok.” Dean sighs and takes a step back, “Thank you Rowena. For everything.
“I’m in,” Balthazar says.
Cass smiles widely. “Then yes, yes I’ll marry you.”
“You’re fucking with me.” John says monotonously. Sam and Dean exchange looks. “You’re not fucking with me. You two fought God, won, and now your adopted son, who is the son of Satan, is now God?”
“Jesse Turner. He’s half-demon. What happened to him after he disappeared?”
———————————————————————
Dean laughs awkwardly. “Hey, Dad? Can I talk to you outside?”
“Her own for the most part. But she doesn’t want to see the Earth destroyed so she could be helpful.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“It doesn’t matter. He is our creator. He is the only one that has the right to lead us.”
“When I was trying to write this, I didn’t even know where to start. We have been through so much together that there are just no words to explain how I feel. But I tried anyway so here we go. Cass, you were my first real friend. Not just my friend, but my best friend. I had never known what that felt like before and think that’s why it took me so long to realize how I felt about you. I thought it was normal to look at your best friend the way I look at you. But obviously, I was mistaken. I fell in love with you the second you walked into that barn and blew out all the lights. I fell in love with you again when you rebelled against Heaven for me. When you saved Sammy from the Cage. When I couldn’t stop needing you even when we couldn’t stand to look at each other. But most of all, I knew I had fallen in love with you when I lost you. When I had to burn your body and spread your ashes. But then you came back and I was still too much of a coward to tell you. And I thought I would never get a chance after you gave your life for me one last time. But here I am, telling you this in front of everyone we have ever known. I love you, Castiel. I love you in a way that I never thought I was capable of loving someone. Never leave me again.”
“Deal,” Jack says.
“Nope. Guess you’ll just have to ask him yourself. Come this way.” They are led to the back room where Sam, Dean, Cass, and Eileen all are told to wait.
Cass shoots out of his seat on Dean’s lap when a noise comes from outside. Sam, Dean, and Jack quickly follow behind him. Right when they exit onto the porch, however, they crash in to Cass who has stopped short.
“We didn’t know what was happening at the time. It was my fault for bringing you there.”
“Hell no. That crazy bastard would whoop my ass in an instant.”
As Chuck stands back up their eyes turn black.
“Well here I am,” Cass says walking up to Dean and draping his arms over Dean’s shoulders. “Like what you see?”
“So there were 2 people who died within a week of Cara and Maggie. One was classified as a murder.”
“What did they tell you to do right now?” Sam asks.
“That would be too easy though, wouldn’t it.”
“Cass!” Dean runs up to him and pulls him tight, never wanting to let go. The Empty transporting them out of the void and back into the field at the same time.
“We’ll see.”
“What if I die?” Gabe says casually.
Sam peaks through the cracked door, sighs, and enters the room warily. “Hey Dean.”
“What? No Jack needs to be here with his family. We just need to get Cass back and then we are going home.” Dean says forcefully.
“Of course, anything.”
“Well, what if all of the angels were able to absorb a little bit of the power from Jack? That way there wouldn’t be a God anymore and Chuck wouldn’t be able to just kill Jack and get the power back.”
“Do you really think we’ll win?”.
After a moment of silence, Sam speaks up. “While we wait, Eileen, I want you to meet my parents. And Dean, you should give Cass and Dad a proper introduction.”
“Can’t be any worse than 2020.”
“What about it? I thought he was hit by a car?” Mr. Kilick looks down, either distraught or a good actor.
“Castiel is fine Dean. I’ll bring them back once you tell me how to go back to sleep!”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I don’t know what we would do.”
“Well, how was I supposed to know? I’ve only been human for like two months.”
She responds with a hug. “Thank you for taking care of my boys.”
“But, I thought there were only four archangels,” Sam says. “Why have we never encountered you before?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I mean, it isn’t stupid in the context of what we have been through and what we are trying to accomplish at this moment. If this is what we have to do, then so be it.”
“And Jesse?”
Cass nods and leans over to rest his head on Dean’s shoulder.
“You can call me Jack. I’m not really God. I just took his power to stop him from destroying the world. And hopefully, I won’t be “God” for much longer.”
“Why would I do that? You’re here to lock me and Amara away, right? And Lucifer here is the only one that can do that.”
“I know.” She turns and walks back to the group.
Sam rolls his eyes and walks over to the machine. “How you guys doing?”
“I love you too, Dean.”
“Except Cass.”
“Those are the reasons I’m losing.”
Dean and Gabe laugh.
“I’m gonna hold you to that.”
“No, I heard you. But what?”
“He’s still incredibly cunning,” Cass explains. “And he has billions of years worth of knowledge and experience to work with. Just on his own, he’s dangerous, but with Amara he’s lethal. Who knows what they’ve been planning?”
“Ummm what do we do now?” Dean asks.
“We all are,” Dean adds, wrapping his arm around Cass again. “I mean you saved the world, again.”
“No cameras at work but I was with my coworker, Jackson, he can confirm I was there. We have a security camera at the front door that will show me coming home around 5:15 or so.”
“Wait, what is he doing?” Jack sits forward and turns up the volume on the laptop.
“It was pretty obvious how much you wanted to bang my bro.”
“Thanks. How you settling in Jesse?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“What about the cage?” Sam suggests. “We could talk to Rowena and see if she would be willing to take him as long as he is fully locked away and unable to cause any problems.”
“Ya.”
“It’s something to at least try,” Mary reasons.
“Revenge.”
“Oh we definitely don’t want to,” Cass says, “but thank you.”
“Benny? What the hell are you doing here?”
“This is an extremely dangerous team up,” Sam jokes.
“Because if you don’t, every angel in Heaven will smite this house and kill all three of us.”
“It’s not comprehensible to the human mind. That’s why I accidentally burned out Pamala’s eyes when we first met. Anyway, the way things work here is when you leave the ‘neighborhood’ of sorts that you have been placed in, any road you go down will take you where you want or need to go. Your fridge will always be stocked with your favorite food and drinks and anything else you need or want can be provided to you by the angel assigned to your area.”
The door closes as the officer leaves them with Chuck handcuffed to the table.
“I didn’t attack him. I just punched him.”
“I’m sorry? I’ve met God, and you are not him.”
“God, you, Lucifer, everyone.”
“Okay everyone.” Dean says as he stands up from sitting beside Ellen. “I know you all know a little bit about what’s going on but here’s the plan. We need you guys to come up with a plan. Thanks.” He sits back down and looks around at everyone’s exasperated and confused faces.
“Well for some reason he always ends up being the key to saving the goddamn world.”
“Boring.”
Everyone shrugs.
“Are you still alive?” Cass asks hesitantly.
And with that, Dean decides that they have waited long enough and pulls Cass in for the kiss that has been 12 years in the making. They are both hesitant and gentle at first, still in disbelief that it’s finally happening, but eventually they fully lean into it. Wrapping their arms around each other and holding on as if at any moment they could be dragged away from each other once again. Soon it becomes desperate and messy as they realize how long they have both been waiting for this and how long they have suppressed their feelings for once another. But, now, there is no reason for them to be afraid anymore. They’re safe and finally free. Dean slips his hand under Cass’ trench coat and pulls him closer. He finally has his angel back, even if he isn’t technically an angel anymore. After a while they separate, out of breath.
Jake nods and turns to go back into his house.
Cass sighs, “ya, but let’s go make sure it stays that way.”
“Mmm really?” Cass said teasingly, wrapping his hands on the back of Dean’s neck. “What exactly was it? I could use the ego boost.”
“How long are you gonna keep him here?”
“Jesse, you stay here, Jack, we should go fill Sam and Dean in.”
“How?!”
“Holy. Shit.”
“Sorry I guess I didn’t introduce myself,” she signs and says. “I’m Eileen.”
“Are they near the bunker too?” Sam asks.
“All you have ever done is create chaos. You don’t care about anyone but yourself and your entertainment.”
“There shouldn’t be one God. And I’m only three, sort of.”
“Someone who is half Demon.”
After a moment of panic, Jack shoots up to a sitting position, gasping for air and clutching his chest.
“Are you sure this'll work?” Cass asks Charlie. “What if it just leaves him vulnerable and they just kill him out of spite?”
“Well, that’s stupid. How’s he gonna destroy the planet without his powers?” Dean responds.
“It hasn’t babe. Jack said it himself. He left it the exact same as before he exploded in it after he got you and the others out. You were able to annoy your way out, and Gabe is much more annoying than you. He’s got this.”
“Gabriel,” comes a familiar voice. “Good to see you again.”
“They have my mom.”
Sam just shrugs in response.
“You guys are the absolute worst. Do you even get how hard it is for me to be human? I have all these voices in my head that I have to listen to that somehow don’t sound like me, I get bored super easily, I have to walk places which is exhausting and going to the bathroom, not a fan,” Cass shrugs and nods in agreement at that. “Being human is punishment enough. I don’t need the silent treatment too.”
“What?” Dean asks.
“Then why don’t you just heal me and we can get the hell out of here?” Dean snaps.
“Have you ever told him that?” Sam asks.
“We should have at least looked.”
Their eyes switch again. “The Earth is broken. It needs to be put out of its misery.”
“She’s getting the others.” Mary looks at him puzzled. “When Dean and Dad come back we’ll fill you in, ya know, depending on if Dad disowns Dean or not.”
“Jesse Turner? I thought I wrote you out of this story?”
“Yes but, well Atara was saying that he shouldn’t be God because he’s so young and naive but I am happy with the changes he’s made. He may be young but he’s done more for Heaven than God ever did.”
“Okay. Thanks. Bye Cass. Tell Jesse hey for me.”
“He has our son,” Sam says.
It’s 10:17 by the time Eileen and Sam re-enter the bunker. They walk into the main room to blaring classic rock that Eileen can feel through the floors, Christmas lights lining the railings and corny party city decorations scattered around. Jody, Donna, Kaia, Claire, and Alex are in the process of setting up a karaoke machine on the other side of the room while Patience talks to Jesse. There are plates of food covering the majority of the center table and a keg in the corner. Cass is walking back and forth from the table and the kitchen with plates of food, wearing a grey ACDC t-shirt with a red plaid shirt, both of which Sam recognizes as Dean’s. A nice change-up from his suit and trench coat now that he’s human.
“But that isn’t important. Cass I…”
“To take advantage of it for as long as I can!” Dean yells back.
“For me’s sake, enough with the short jokes already. I made this vessel back when this was the average height of mankind. Not my fault evolution got out of hand.”
Gabe chuckles. “That was fun.”
“Don’t worry, they’ll be back soon.”
“So what does that mean?” Cass asks.
“That is not something I ever thought I would hear you say. Let alone wanted to hear you say,” Sam groans.
Poor Jack
~~~~~~~~~~
“I hate you all.”
“Right?! Couldn’t even get it to respond to my knock-knock jokes,” Gabe responds.
“Do you think it’s a good idea?” Cass asks.
“Did you ever tell anyone else what they told you?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Exactly and ya know? I love our life, despite its horrors and pain but I think I’m ready for a new chapter. I’m ready for peace. I’m ready for retirement. And this time, I think it might finally be possible.”
“Ok, then how do we deal with this?” Bobby sighs.
“You are so wrong Jack.”
“Ya,” Jesse says. “He hit me with something right as I was leaving but I’m fine.”
Gabe and Jesse nod. Cass slowly turns the knob and they enter the house hesitantly, knowing Chuck likely already knows they’re there. They walk into the main room to find Chuck sitting on the couch muttering to himself.
Sam, Jack, Bobby, and Eileen are sitting at the table when Dean and Cass get back. “Hey, how did things with Rowena go?” Dean asks when they walk in.
“Sorry about that. Have a good day.”
“I died on the job. Because of that, I was able to save the lives of some kids and any people in the future who would have been killed by those vamps. I’m pretty okay with that. And it meant that Sam could get out of hunting and live a normal life without feeling guilty. Besides, at least I lived long enough to see you get beaten by the very people who you thought you could control. And I got this out of it.” Dean holds up his and Cass’ hand and presses a kiss to Cass’ knuckles. “So I definitely still say I won.”
“Well, since you’ve only ever seen me in a vessel, you technically think Jimmy Novak is adorable.”
“Hmmm. Didn’t think this through, did you?”
“Again, he’s kind of our responsibility.”
“Cass. We can’t just leave him here. You heard Atara, Jebediah will be back soon.”
“I guess that answers it,” Dean mutters.
~~~~~~~~~~
“You also have internalized homophobia and emotional constipation.” Sam adds
“Wait, so every dick that despises Cass, Sam and me is here? Like Lucifer and Zachariah and Abbadon and fucking Alistair.”
“Not yet but I’m sure with it being here we will be able to figure it out.” Rowena runs her hand over the Mark muttering words in Latin. “I never got to study this while Dean possessed it, it’s incredible.”
“Fine. Wait, since Dad never met Cass, what’ll he look like.”
“Then I can’t wake up,” he says after a moment.
——————————————————
Cass smiles. “I still can’t believe how much you’ve grown up.”
“No. We shouldn’t be, because there is nothing we can do right now. What we should be doing is relaxing and enjoying ourselves, for what-,” Dean sighs and closes his eyes, “for what could be the last time.”
“Am I missing something?” Bobby enquires.
“I’m sorry. I was wrong. About so many things. I thought you were an ‘abomination’ and a ‘threat to the world’ but that’s bullshit. You were just a kid who needed our help, you still are,” Cass sighs. “I mean, you clearly don’t need our help but, if there’s anything you do need, anything at all, we’re here.”
“What?!” Dean said, “Why the hell would you do that?”
“I think so,” Micah says as the last of the group sits up, groaning. There are 6 of them in total. All under the age of 17.
“If anyone can find the answer to this, it’ll be them.”
“A greater one actually.”
“No! Jack leave!”
“Come on guy’s this is what, a 20-hour drive or whatever? You can’t avoid talking the entire time.”
“Please don’t make me kill you, Cassiel.”
“Well, I think it actually ended worse for you because I got to live out my life while you died young and much less heroically if I might add than if I was still making the decisions about how your life played out.”
“Hey Jack, how you feeling?”
“Thank you, Hannah.”
“Definitely werewolves,” Sam says. “Their ‘hunting trips’ coincide with the full moon.”
“Honestly, he’s probably dead or something,” Eileen says. “I mean he has no idea how to get a job or buy food or do anything that relates to being human.”
“Hello. I have some not-so-good news.”
“Okay, thanks.”
“So what’s your plan here?” Cass says as the others pop back in with Jack.
Dean smiles wider than Cass has ever seen. They’re finally free.
“He killed the entire planet. We should have locked him up in the first place.”
“Is that why he’s doing everything in his power to get you better? You hear him praying right?”
“What the Hell do you mean Chuck is here. How did that fucking asshole get into to heaven?” Dean fumes as he stands up.
“Dude, we just wanted to find our dad. Now we are fighting the ex-God to make sure the new God, who is the son of Satan that we adopted, stays in charge. How the hell did we even get here?”
“And what did I do to earn the presence of God himself, Jackie boy.”
“Right,” Cass responds. “So where do we start?” No one answers. “Rowena? This is your plan.”
“The poor kid’s been through a lot. I mean I barely know him but from what I do know, he shouldn’t have to be taking on this responsibility.”
~~~~~~~~~~
The moment is interrupted by Jesse laughing. Cass and Dean look down embarrassed. They kind of forgot he was there.
“Somehow he meets all my standards.”
——————————————————————
“Whether or not Castiel stays dead depends on you Dean. On if you have the ability to accept who you are.”
Dean laughs and put his hand on Cass’ neck. Cass responds by pressing their foreheads together, smiling, laughing and crying all at the same time. “Is this real?”
“Chuck is here."
“Thank you Jesse. We couldn’t have done this without you. You truly saved the world.” Sam smiles at him. “I’m really sorry we fucked up your life.”
“How long until that kid gets off of work?” Sam signs.
“Come with us Lucifer. It’ll be a lot easier if you cooperate,” Jack says, stepping forward.
“Why are you showing me this?”
“No idea. We could see if we can help Jack and Cass with the remodeling,” Sam shrugs.
“Jake, do you know anyone who would have a grudge against your brother?”
“That’s good.” Dean smiles.
Cass stands and grabs a blanket from the loveseat and drapes it over Jack gently. “How’s that?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“At least let me drive for a while.”
“Thank you.”
“Martin,” Eileen says. “Let him go and we can talk.”
“Hell no. I’m beyond ready for retirement. I just wish it could’ve, you know, happened while we were alive.”
“Cass.”
“Chuck still wants to destroy the world and start over but he won’t if we give him his power back. So we either let him kill 9 angels and the god of death or 8 billion people die.”
“Really? Dean and Castiel finally got together? Thought that was never gonna happen.”
“Of course that was you. Anyway, a number of months before that I was living in this small town in Russia. I was really happy there. I was going to school, I had friends, the whole nine yards. I was even using my powers for good, like healing people and making crops grow. But nothing that would draw much attention or give off a lot of energy signatures,” Jesse sighs and sits back. “Long story short, I guess I didn’t have as much control as I thought I did because this power shot through me while I was making some rounds at the hospital and I… blew it up.”
“No. There are others there but I can’t tell who it is. I don’t recognize their souls.”
“Have you tried contacting him?”
Sam looks down and chuckles.
“They have no idea what they’re walking into. Chuck could have millions on his side.”
“How would you know? You never even met Chuck until after he was dead and powerless.”
“Do whatever you need to do, Jack. You have my full trust.”
“Yes,” Rowena answers without looking up from the codex.
Dean presses his face into Cass’ shoulder and takes a deep breath. He has truly never felt freer in all his life. This feels so much more liberating than when he confessed this in the dream world. Knowing that his brother, the most important person in his life, approves of this and feeling that he and the man he loves can finally be 100% honest with each other for the first time ever.
~~~~~~~~~~
“What did you think I was gonna disown you or something? We’re in Heaven. Isn’t that where we are supposed to be happy? And if this ‘Cass’ makes you happy, then so be it. I’m just gonna need some time to adjust.”
“But do you know how they do it?”
“We have a god of sorts already here.” Dean says.
~~~~~~~~~~
Sam walks into the room a few hours later to find Dean and Cass glued to their respective books. “Find anything new?”
Before they can say anything further, Sam's phone rings.
“But he said it back before you were taken right?”
Dean looks down at his feet. “What if you didn’t know how to wake up anyway?”
“They don’t need to be fixed, Chuck. Give up. It’s not going to happen.”
“Thanks, Jack but we know how busy you’ve been. We don’t wanna put anything else on your plate,” Dean says.
“Suicide bomber,” Cass adds.
“Samuel! Jack! My boys. It’s been so long!”
Jack nods. “Cass, what do I do?”
“I just hope he doesn’t try and kill us,” Sam laughs. “Although it would kinda be justified.”
“That’s all it took? Just telling him?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I’ll be fine. I promise. Besides, Jack can just pull me out of the Empty if I die again.”
“I should have just stayed in jail.”
“Because that means you’re going to lose. It is soooooo much easier to kill a couple of super-powered angels than one God.”
“Well the thing is… um… it isn’t a her,” Dean says slowly.
“How are we supposed to know that when Gabriel isn’t here to confirm? It isn’t binding without a witness.”
“You don’t have to say anything Dean. I knew you couldn’t reciprocate when I said it.”
“He’s not wrong.”
“If you don’t mind me being unattended in your kingdom, Rowena, I can go work on the cage and you and Sam can catch up.”
“You have my genes, not Cass’.”
“You’re such a child. Can we just focus on the task at hand?”
“Fuck off.”
“Is that ‘cause I’m dating an angel or one of God’s dads?”
“On that note, I should probably go get Chuck down to Hell where he belongs and where he can no longer make any trouble.”
“Yes. Well soon. He said within the hour. Well, Earth hour. So around 5 minutes here.”
“I see you’ve learned some new words from your human.”
“Jack.”
“Fine. But if you think I’m driving all the way to Sacramento, you are very wrong.”
Sam and Eileen both laugh. “Okay,” Eileen says. “Let’s get remarried.”
“Father, why? Why wipe out billions of innocents?”
“What does that even mean!” Dean yells after them.
“While you were dying and in the coma, did you have any hyper-realistic dreams that you didn’t even know were fake?”
“I think he was just saying that stuff to mess with us,” Cass adds. “I don’t think he actually believes it.”
“Jerk.”
“Where have you been? We haven’t seen you in decades. I just assumed you were killed by rogue angels or something.”
“Chuck already won Sam. He got his ending. We have no more cards left to play.”
As they all sit on the porch, the ground suddenly shakes, the sky growing dark for a moment.
“Oh.”
“The town. No one survived.”
“Thank’s Dad.” “I wonder if the real John would be this cool about me being into guys?” Dean thinks to himself.” I bet the real John would beat me half to death.”
“Well shit… I’m gonna die.” Dean thinks right when he puts his hand on the door handle. He sighs “Fuck it, what have I got to lose”. He’s gonna go in and be as “season one Dean Winchester” as possible
“Doing what, angel who tried to kill me when I was eleven?”
“I haven’t used my powers in so long. I don’t even know if I can control them anymore.”
Donna just smiles and walks towards her truck. Sam turns to Eileen and signs, “lets get out of here.”
“As I said before, you don’t have a body to return to,” Cass explains. “But he’s going to be okay. We’re going to save him.”
“Fuck you, Chuck.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Don’t worry you still look adorable.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You always made a difference, Jack,” Dean says.
“Wanna go to bed?” Dean mumbles.
“I’m still not getting what this has to do with me.”
“Any chance you could take me to go tell them and then we can all come back here together?”
Jesse can’t help but smile at Jack. “Great. So, uh, Uncle Jack. You think you could remove my powers like you did with Castiel?”
“No, it isn’t.”
“Lucifer is New God’s dad. Huh. Now I’ve heard it all.”
“I can’t tell. It’s like the scene is blurry. And Chuck doesn’t have a soul so I wouldn’t be able to sense it.”
“Hey!” Dean says defensively. “I didn’t know angels could feel love like us.”
“Better than being in pain and then dying anyway. How about if we don’t find anything else by the time we get through these books then we can cross that bridge.”
“If it would help you, Dean. Cass can take you to him while Sam and I are in Hell.”
“To take over as the leader of Heaven for a while. At least until I feel comfortable enough with my powers to return to Earth. I would be helping place souls and develop individual heavens.”
“I’m sure I can with the right materials, but it could take a while. It took both me and Charlie to crack the codex the first time. I could definitely use some help.”
Cass, Dean, and Eileen rush in. “What’s going on?” Cass questions as he arrives at Jack’s side.
“I’m on it,” Ash says. “Dr. Badass is in.” He turns and heads into the other room with his laptop.
“You literally tried to kill me. Obviously, you didn’t want me around.”
“What the hell just happened?” Bobby asks.
With an innocently shocked expression on his face, he stutters out a response. “Me too, um, can I kiss you?”
“Hmm?”
“I will. I love you.”
“Ya.”
“I’ll come with you.” Cass stands.
“Ya, you’re right. I just can’t believe we’re going through this shit again. I thought Heaven was supposed to be peaceful and relaxing.”
Eileen stands slowly and Sam grabs her hand.
“Hey, Sam. I’m in a bit of trouble.” Comes a familiar squirrelly voice.
“What about us?” Claire interjects.
“Should we start another movie?” Jesse breaks the silence. “I suggest something from this century.”
Father Jackson opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out. After a moment he is able to form a sentence. “Well, this is definitely the weirdest job I’ve ever had.”
“Do you know how he and Beth died?”
~~~~~~~~~~
They all turn and head up the stairs. Dean grabs Cass’ hand as they get to the door. Sam and Dean both steal one last look around before they switch the lights off and close the door. The Impala and Eileen are waiting for them outside.
Jesse smiles and nods.
“Your name.”
“Not by choice.”
“And he’s an angel.”
“Jack and Cass have got this,” Sam adds.
“It was safer for everyone.” Jesse says sadly as he sat down at the table.
“But you didn’t have a soul so that wasn’t your fault.”
“Is there any way for you or Jack to erase people’s memories of watching the people around them disappear?  Or just alter them?”
“Ok Michael, bring me back.”
“Oh they definitely do,” Eileen says.
“I told you! Jack can put you back to sleep!”
“I’ll join you,” Eileen says as she stands to join Bobby as he heads towards his house.
“Then what’s the cure? There has to be a cure.” Sam sighs.
“Definitely should have expected that,” Jesse mutters.
Everyone remains silent.
Dean smiles and pulls his fiancé to his feet, pressing a joyful kiss on the angel's lips.
“Dude. You got stabbed in the back by a fucking nail. You really thought your brother would let you die like that? He called an ambulance after you passed out. You’re in the hospital, in a medically induced coma, dreaming about being dead.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Good luck Dean.”
“I don’t know. I’ve made so many new angels and brought quite a few back from the Empty that I can’t even really keep track.”
“Ya. He got Cass and some other angels that deserved a second chance out to help with Heaven. He’s in the process of redesigning a better afterlife for the angels and demons who deserve it.”
“Same thing he did to me. Make him watch.”
“Ya kinda,” Sam says.
“Ummm. How about New Zealand? I spent a bit of time there before everything went downhill.”
“Given the fact that all humans are younger than me, it’s not like I have much of a say in the matter.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“So Adam he’s?” Dean asks
“Okay. Come sit over here and Rowena can study the mark.”
“That’s the problem, Gabriel. Some angels don’t want to see Chuck locked up. They still have some loyalty to him and he may convince them to start another war in Heaven.”
Amara nods. “I understand.”
“No matter. I always love a call back to earlier seasons.”
“But he has nothing to feel guilty about. He should know that by now.” Dean sighs and looks over at Cass who is staring blankly at the ground.
Jesse sighs and looks at Eileen. “What do you think? We don’t know each other so you have a more objective viewpoint on this.”
“Hiya Sammy,” Dean says, groaning as he sits up.
“I can’t let my mom hurt anymore. I have to do what they say.”
“What do you need?”
“Jack, everyone in our family has done a lot of bad. I released Lucifer and drank Demon blood. I left Dean and Cass in Purgatory. I released the Darkness for fuck sake. Does that make me a bad person? No. Because they were mistakes and I have made up for them and been forgiven by the people I love. And there is nothing that you have done that doesn’t deserve forgiveness.”
The Shadow smirks. “What do you want Gabriel?”
“Oh, you know. Here and there. Went overseas. You and your pals don’t seem to leave America all that often so I just kept a low profile and hoped I would be left alone. And I was until like a week ago. I haven’t been told much, just what I needed to do.”
“Aye-Aye captain.”
“Ya.”
“Me too. Would you like to go see the house that I created for you and Eileen? It’s next door to Dean’s place and right down the road from Bobby and your parents.”
“Ok. Start from the beginning. Tell me every detail.” Dean says to Jesse.
“Yep. It was surprisingly good.”
“Ya… I just thought the world was done needing this kind of help.”
“Well, where is she?”
“Where is he?” Sam stands up.
“Okay, let me see it.”
He turns to Jesse and does the same. “I’m so sorry for what you’ve had to go through, I wish you could have just been a normal kid.”
Tears roll down Jack’s face. “I don’t know if I can.”
“Sorry.”
“I’m not a human.”
After a few silent moments, Lucifer clears his throat awkwardly. “Ahh, how sweet. I heard about you two from deal old Gabriel.” He rolls his eyes. “So we gonna do this or just continue this pity party?”
“Well, it is.” Sam smiles. “Hey what ever happened with the Empty?”
“Agent Hoth. This is my partner agent Halen. We’re investigating the deaths of Edward Kilick, Cara Sanders, and Margret Johnson. Do you mind if we ask you some questions?”
~~~~~~~~~~
“You don’t get conditions,” Cass says. “Gabriel gave his life for this. That’s more than enough.”
“On the plus side,” Jesse starts. “They clearly don’t like Chuck so we might not even have to kill him ourselves.”
Dean runs into his and Cass’ house to find Cass sitting at the dining room table.
“Come on,” Eileen says, “we gotta get you guys checked out at the hospital to be safe.”
“Probably for the best. Anyway, do you see now that your powers aren’t bad?”
“That’s all you got out of that? I mean, don’t get me wrong, it was definitely a miracle but not really the main point here.”
“There was a recent regime change in Heaven. Some aren’t all that pleased.”
“It’ll be okay Jack.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Jesse and Patience are smiling and laughing as they talk over at the table. Neither has ever had someone that they felt this comfortable with, especially not right off the bat. They both understand what it’s like to not really belong.
“Nope.” The empty snapped their fingers and all of the angels were gone, including Cass.
“Thanks,” Sam says. “That would’ve been a long-ass drive.”
Gerald approaches the door and the woman turns back into the house.
“The hospital?” Sam asks slowly.
“Amara?!” Dean pleas, “You need to separate from him or you’ll be caged too.”
“Ya but still.”
“Gabriel. He kinda took over as Loki for a while. He might know something about it. Or at least know someone who would.”
“You can drop by any time you want,” Dean says.
“For thousands of years?” Jack asks.
“No Cass. Heaven needs you here.”
“And we have the power of God on ours. Plus angel juice on top of that and Claire and Kaya, and Garth and Benny from purgatory, and the demons, and Gabe got Hades to join. They’ve got this.”
Cass and Dean step close and grab each other by the hand before leaning in for a kiss. Dean savors this moment, never wanting it to end. It slowly gets more passionate as they forget the crowd watching them. When they pull away that press their foreheads together and laugh as the crowd cheers loudly. Dean looks out over the audience and sees his parents standing and cheering. His father finally looks like he understands. Their bridesmaids and groomsmen are all clapping wildly. Jack tackles them both for a hug before he and Cass can do anything else. This is the happiest moment of Dean’s life, even if it isn’t real.
“Because this was my home. And they like to screw with me.”
“Sounds good to me.”
“I didn’t think it mattered, the grace didn’t really change me. And Cassiel was gone. No one had heard from them since a few decades after they fell.”
“So what now?” Sam sighs.
“There could have been something that happened or something someone said that didn’t mean anything to you but would to me.”
“Ya, I think I’ll pass.” He chuckles, “I’m just glad they were finally able, to be honest with each other.”
Sam burst into the bunker, followed by Jack. Both unable to contain their panic. “Dean! Cass! Dean! Are you here? Where are you?”. Dean remained silent. He didn’t even notice Sam and Jack’s arrival. Eventually Dean was found, sitting against the same wall that Cass through him against, face covered in dried tears.
“Ya of course. You should really come meet him. Mom and he got along really well so I’m sure you guys will too.”
Jack closes his eyes for a moment, “He’s still alive if that’s what you’re wondering. He’s in Saskatchewan, Canada. Hasn’t used his powers in five years. Lives alone in a studio apartment and works at a local grocery store.”
Jack and Jesse appear aside Michael and both strike a powerful blow against Chuck. Jack's eyes glowing with rage and despair over the loss of his father and friends. Chuck just laughs like it tickled. But then Michael joins the fight and their combined powers throw Chuck off balance. Forming a semicircle around Chuck, the forces of Heaven, Hell and Earth push him almost to his knees, Chuck straining against their combined power.
“What the hell just happened?” Dean asks.
Cass and Cassiel appear on the roof of a tall building.
“Does your mother know?”
“No one wants to hear the corny stuff.”
“No, not that I can tell.”
“And?”
Placing a gentle kiss on the top of Cass’ head he sighs, resting his head on top of Cass’ and closing his eyes as well. “I know.”
Sam smiles “Well, it’s the least we can do,” Sam pauses. “I’ll let you get settled in then we can figure out something for lunch.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“I’m gonna keep them,” he looks at Jack. “But I’m also not gonna go to Heaven. I’m going to try and keep helping people. I need to stop being afraid of who I am.”
“We were a little preoccupied with the apocalypse,” Cass responds.
“Ya, soon we’re gonna be taxpaying members of society with full time jobs, a mortgage and grey hair.”
~~~~~~~~~~
As they near the impala Dean starts laughing, “I can’t believe this is actually our life now.”
Gabe groans. “Fine. Um, it was Chuck that created it. We just helped him put Amara in there. All I was a part of was binding the mark to Lucifer to seal the cage.”
“She’s right,” Sam says. “But I vote we just take turns watching the security monitor for the night to just make sure nothing weird happens.”
“Dean, it’s been too long.”
“He doesn’t. I’m what’s holding him back from living the life he deserves. He’s better off without me.”
“There’s nice parts of Canada.”
“Yes, that would probably work, but he still might die.”
“Can I help you?”
“I wasn’t going to let him and Garth go back to purgatory. Garth’s family either.” Cass explains.
“Even stronger than when I absorbed the leviathans. But this time I don’t think I’ll explode.”
“I mean you were God so it kind of is your fault.”
“Not the word I would use to describe it,” Dean mutters.
“Ya, maybe,” Cass responds. “I just hope he’s doing okay up there on his own. I feel guilty not being there to help.”
“Hey, Jack?”
“Yes, but I’ll still have to accompany you. Your soul can’t leave Heaven or Hell without me or an angel.”
“Baby Bro! What’s up?!”
~~~~~~~~~~
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. You are. So give me Kelly and Rowena and get the hell out of my home.”
“I prayed to you too, Castiel. For years before I gave up.”
“Oh, you’re not gettin’ rid of me that easily.” Dean places his hand on the back of Cass’ neck and steps close to him, their lips just an inch apart. “I love you Castiel.”
“The billions of people that Chuck eliminated need my help. And…I can’t get Cass back. There’s no way for me to enter the empty. Only Death and God can.”
“How’s he doing?” Sam asks as he, Eileen, and Dean enter the room with books and binders.
“I know right? We got really lucky.”
“What?” Sam questions. “Why the hell would he think that?”
“He died before it all happened. Sacrificed himself for Dean. Dean wasn’t gonna let him stay in that place.” The room was silent and Donna looked at Sam like he could break at any moment. “But they’re gonna make it back, Dean’s got this.” He clears his throat. “Ok lets get out of this place.”	“Okay come on everyone,” Bobby declared.
“Huh.”
“Ya. I’m back.”
“Hello, Mr. Kilick?” Sam asks.
Jack nods and disappears.
Eileen laughs. “Anyway, I was killed about a year later by a hell hound, you know that part,” Eileen gestures at Mary, “then after Chuck released all the souls from Hell I was able to get out and Sam brought me back to life. Then I died again, thanks Jack for fixing that one, and ya. That’s about it.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Well if you decide that you still want your powers removed, I can do that but I’m not capable of doing it without your say so. It’s a part of the God job description.”
“That’s Ash’s doing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jack! What a surprise.” Comes Chuck’s voice from behind him.
“You mean to tell me you boys haven’t been to see your parents yet?” Bobby questions as they head out to the impala.
“Put Chuck and Amara in the cage that was made for the Darkness,” Jack says again.
“What?”
“Sadly he’s right,” Sam responds.
“Yes,” Dean responds. “We have absolutely no reason to trust anything you do and say.”
“I’m the son of Lucifer and if I can create something this beautiful while having powers originating from the two most evil beings in the universe, that says something about what you can do.”
“Ya, well they will be. Dean went to the empty to get Cass back.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Sounds good,” Cass says. Sam exits the apartment leaving Dean and Cass alone with Jesse’s dog.
“So what happens now.”
“He has Demon blood, can he even go to heaven?”
“I learned it from your Dad and Uncle. And Cass of course.”
“I’m not sure exactly but after all the details are in place I think I’m just gonna do what Chuck did and relax on Earth. Except ya know, not play with people’s lives as he did.”
“But we never heard anything about him since. I kinda just assumed an angel got him. Like Cass tried to do.”
“To do what,” Jack responds. Cass just looks at Dean confused.
Chuck is still an asshole and Jack deserves a hug. Also, Cass is the best Dad ever and I love him with all my heart.
“I burned off my soul fighting the Archangel Michael and I pretty much lost all my morality. So I killed her when she made me angry. That’s pretty unforgivable, don’t ya think?”
“I’ve missed you guys too.”
“Ya,” Sam laughs, “we do. It wasn’t the same without you the first time so I’m glad you’re able to see me get married finally.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“Awesome. Let me guess, Dean made you a burger?”
“So what? You just gonna keep on acting like this is real? Keep lying to yourself?”
Jesse reappears in Hell, shortly followed by Gabe then Cass. Jesse stumbles as he tries to find his feet.
Cass remains silent as he walks beside Jack a little ways behind the Winchesters and Lucifer.
“Hi Cass.”
“You okay man?” Gabe asks as Jesse regains his composure.
“No, but I got a good feeling we can rule him out as a suspect.”
“A bandage that lasted hundreds of thousands of years last time. Humanity isn’t going to last that much longer at this rate anyway.” Sam explains.
“It’s just one step up. Get Googling.”
Eileen nods.
“I’m an angel and because I needed him.”
“So where have you been since you got back?” Dean asks, still wondering how Jesse escaped Chuck’s mass murder.
“They were insignificant. Boring.”
“No, I understand. I don’t even really see that body as my dad anymore anyway. It’s been so long.”
“You deserve it,” Lisa adds.
“How long can you hold on?”
Cass sighed “We were being attacked by Death and I had made a deal with the Empty a while before that in exchange for Jack’s life it could come and take me when I allowed myself to be happy. So I told Dean how I felt to make myself happy enough for the Empty to come and take me and Death away.”
Mary smiles brightly and places her hand to her mouth. “I can’t wait to meet him but I hope he isn’t here yet.”
“Give me one reason for why I shouldn’t just kill you right now.”
“Dean,” Cass says smiling. “Jesse is searching for Lucifer but part of me thinks we should just leave him be until he chooses to show himself.”
“I don’t know. We can’t exactly kill Chuck with Cassiel possessing him.”
“Ok, the cage is all set for Chuck. I’ll be back soon with him.”
Dean looks up slowly to see the man he just married, an inch away from him, tears trailing down his face. “Dean. I-.”
“You’re getting married?” John says slowly. “You know you’re dead right?”
“No reason but um, if you did at some point, and you were given the chance to live out your life with your wife, even if it was just in your head and not actually real, would you? Even if it meant you would die in the real world?”
“Jack said normally people who never met you would see how you looked when you died but since Cass isn’t dead I would guess it would be how he chooses to look. So he’ll probably look like he does to us.”
“Dang we’re old,” Sam laughs.
“Not my choice. They threatened to send my family to hell. Do I have to repeat everything I already told to them?” Jesse gestures to Cass and Jack.
“Where’s Chuck?” One of the angels asks.
“Everyone.” They all say in unison.
“Well it seems like he’s been doing fine on his own, based on the information Jack gave us,” Eileen adds.
~~~~~~~~~~
Sam pats Jack on the back, “be safe kid. You better come back in one piece this time.”
“No way are you getting out of this,” Sam says before he can exit.
“That’s just another bandage.”
“Amara!” Jack yells. “You have to take control!”
Jack, Jesse, and Cass look over at Lucifer. He has that look on his face that suggests he’s not planning on just walking away from this.
“What?” Dean asks.
“You’ve done much more good than bad.”
“So if you aren’t here to kill me, whatcha doin’ here? I mean it’s been like 10 years or whatever.”
“So Jesse, any chance you want to tell me how you’re doing it?”
“Okay, we’ll talk about that later,” Dean says slowly. “Right now, how about you tell us where Chuck is so that we can lock him back up.”
“Hey hey hey, you have to stay on your back.” Cass places his hand on Jack’s shoulder to steady him. “How are you feeling?”
“Lucifer.”
“A couple decades ago.”
“Not fully powered down. He’s still at least as strong as an archangel and he has Jesse with him.”
Dean sighs. “Imma punch ‘em”
Their eyes turn black as Amara uses all her might to take over Chuck’s mind one last time. Jesse, Jack, and Cass release them from the wall and fall to the ground in exhaustion.
Dean grabs Cass’ hand and pulls him down onto the armchair with him. “Hey, don’t say that, it’s all going to be okay. You have nothing to worry about, I don’t think Gabe is physically capable of staying dead. Any second now he’s going to come back with Lucifer and Chuck’s gonna power down again. The power is tied to his life force now so we don’t even have to worry about Chuck having more mojo once Gabe comes back.”
~~~~~~~~~~
“What!?” Bobby responds. “I thought Chuck left the angels alone?”
“Dean, I thought we weren’t supposed to see each other before the wedding?” Cass says as Dean walks into their bedroom. Cass is dressed in a jet black tux with a white dress shirt underneath. The only splash of color in the dark blue flower in his breast pocket that matches his eyes perfectly.
"That's why I ran. Just... leave me, please."
so he could bargain with us?”
“You’ll see,” Jimmy answers unhelpfully, gesturing with a flick of his head for Castiel to stand and follow.
The doors to the barn are pushed open, an all too familiar trench coat clad figure making his way into the barn. The second the doors begin to open, the lights above them brighten and shatter, showering Castiel in sparks as he advances towards the two.
, in fact.”
“You?” Sam asked, baffled. “Are going to the park? For a date?”
“…Why would it risk heaven?”
“Oh, it’ll be one to tell the grandkids, that’s for sure,” Dean joked. To Dean’s delight, Castiel at least seemed to find him funny, shaking his head as he laughed. “It actually all started because me and Sam ordered the same thing.”
What was he even planning to do? He could handle a gunshot, a knife wound… but… how could he fix
“Shut up and drink your coffee,” Castiel knelt atop the bed, swinging himself around and collapsing back with a whoosh of air as his back hit the headboard, holding the cup of coffee carefully in front of him to avoid any spillage. Castiel rubbed his free hand across both tired eyes before taking a hearty swig from the cup in his hands, ignoring Dean’s yelp of protest. Cas rolled his eyes at Dean’s gasps of betrayal, swallowing the hot beverage and wincing as it burnt down his throat. He held the coffee cup out to Dean, knowing full well Dean would become a whiny mess if he didn’t get his morning caffeine soon after waking. Dean snatched the cup form Cas’s hold, cradling it protectively to his chest. The bit didn’t last for long, the intoxicating smell of coffee wafting from the cup too strong to ignore. Dean took a sip, giving a contented hum as the delicious flavor passed his tongue.
No doubt about it, he recognized the golden-haired barista that had apparently managed to swoon his brother over. Gabriel was staring down at his phone which he held in one hand, the other hand busy holding a lollipop to his mouth. It seemed that Gabriel was so absorbed in his phone that Dean worried for a second that Gabriel was going to walk straight into him, but once he was a few feet away, Gabriel came to a stop. Putting the phone into his pocket, he pulled the lollipop out of his mouth with a wet ‘pop’, finally looking up at Dean. The cocky flirtatious smirk he had been planning promptly melted away to one of immense confusion- that of which Dean was sure he was mirroring right back at him.
“Do I detect some pride in your voice?”
“Ah yes, pamphlets. The answers to all my problems,” Dean stuffed as much sarcasm into the words as he could, smiling mockingly up at the two of them.
"You want to go in there with me?" Castiel asks for clarification.
, he loved me and… he
Sam and Eileen straightened themselves up, turning their attention towards Dean. “First of all, it’s eleven in the morning. We’ve been up for five hours.” Sam shot back. “Second of all… what’s got you so smiley?”
Castiel shouldn’t have to grace such a stupid question with an answer, but he does. “More than you could ever know. And I’ll never
“Shut up.”
“Course I remember,” Dean answered dryly, dropping his gaze back down to the paper full of complicated-looking Latin. “Didn’t work. What came back was just…”
"Cas!"
"Really?"
Dean’s breath hitches as feels Cas turn towards him. Cas had his fingers scrunched into the soft material of Dean’s shirt, his hand heavy atop Dean’s chest. It does at least get Dean to open his eyes again, greeted to the sight of Cas tucked into his side. Dean feels his hand lifting up before he can think about it, settling on top of Cas’s hand.

Sam looked ready to argue with Dean some more about that, which Dean was absolutely not having. He wheeled away from the conversation, rolling himself over to the Impala’s passenger seat. “Now c’mon, unlock this damn door before I find my own way home.”
“Long as you make me sound cool and omit the part where I nearly threw up having my catheter removed - then I’m all for it.”
“Uh… taking you home?” Sam clarified.
were written in elegant golden writing, sat upon a pretty backdrop of a blue sky and fluffy white clouds, with the ‘H’ and ‘G’ both having halos painted atop of them. Despite all of this, the most striking aspect of the sign was the ebony black wings stretched out beside the name of the shop, their tips nearly going past the edge of the sign.
“Well

better than Dean had. Sure, hunting keeps you physically fit, but all those fights, and being thrown against walls, tend to take their toll on the human body. Perhaps the drink would catch up to him - all those years drowning his liver in toxins. Hell, maybe he'd even clog an artery after countless takeouts and greasy diner foods.
Dean finds himself nodding along with his brother’s speech, exhaling heavily and brushing a hand down his suit for invisible dust. “Yeah… yeah, you’re right.”
Castiel ducked his head with quiet laughter, glancing back up when a bottle of cold beer is plonked down on the bar in front of him.
“You still haven’t explained why you’re here,” Eileen interrupts, bringing Rowena’s attention over to her. “You were able to sense Castiel’s grace and… then what?”
” Dean exclaims as the memory floods back; the two of them sat what felt like miles apart in Rowen’s throne room, unable to even look at one another as they received what – if Dean’s being honest with himself – was a much-needed counseling session from the
“Uh, guys… I don’t think we worked out the whole ‘timing’ thing too well…” Sam leaned across to pop the blissful bubble Dean and Cas were wrapped up in. “We should probably get going to the bunker before we’re stumbling back in the dark.”
, you stupid stupid angel…”
It seems to take an eternity for the doors to fully swing open. His eyes shoot up to the walls, rapidly scanning across the fading sigils that defiantly remained painted across. They had covered every square inch of the place in every protective sigil they knew. It hadn’t done a thing. They didn’t know of the creature that was going to walk through those doors.
The skies had opened, pouring down buckets of rain that made it even harder to see through the bleakness of the night. Sam hunched his shoulders up, hands shoved into his jeans pockets as he stepped out from the warmth of the hospital and into the chilling rain.
And yet… here was a new message from Eileen on his phone. Just a little over two weeks from the last message. Sam clicks on the chat bubble, opening up the conversation and tapping rapidly across his phone’s keyboard.
"You wanna hear about how I killed myself after you and mom were gone?"
“Yeah! I started not long ago, and my friends are really fun! But… do you think I can keep going to kindergarten now?”

Dean peeled himself away from Cas, glancing anxiously over to his brother.  Not that he had anything to worry about, of course. Sam didn’t even blink at the two of them, too wrapped up in the euphoria and relief of getting his best friend back that he could only stand back with Eileen, watching their well-earned reunion with a smile of pure relief.
He had a plan. Castiel had a
And really, it wasn’t the time to react to that, either. Coz Cas had just walked out of the room with Sammy out cold in his arms, and the spinning in his vision and the fact that he had just told Cas he loved him could only mean he was suffering from one hell of a concussion, so he filed it all away for later. Now, the only thing on his mind was ‘protect Sammy’ on a loop, so he stumbled to his feet and clumsily chased after them, nearly falling into the doorframe on his way out.
I'm not getting through this,
“Okay, first of all, that impression of me? Uncanny. Secondly, don’t you wanna see the show?”
Castiel scoffed,
Dean jolts at Sam’s voice, glancing up to see Sam stood behind the table alongside Eileen; a sturdy wooden bowl they used for many spells sat directly in front of him whilst the few ingredients needed for the spell were situated in smaller contains, situated around the bowl on top of the table.

I want you at my damn wedding, kid,” Dean quickly answered, sending a quick dark glare Sam’s way for his poor choice of words. “Don’t think for a second that’s not the case. We didn’t get to send you a physical invitation since, y’know… you don’t exactly have a

, is the kind of guy who likes to see the best in people. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen, right? If things don’t go entirely according to plan, then maybe he’ll get a friend out of all of this.
Something about the sentiment behind Eileen’s words sparked a realization within Sam’s mind. His gaze switched from Eileen to his brother, his face slipping into an expression of pity as all the strange moments between his best friend and his brother connected in his mind. “Oh, Dean… you’re never going to get over him, are you?”
Before Castiel could say anything in response to this revelation, Jimmy was patting him on the back with a sympathetic smile. “Look, I know this is all… a
“It’s around here somewhere,” he says.
," Castiel responds, "
I tell you this story not because I am a tree or an angel or anything in between. I am merely the wind and I hear the whispers of leaves and men alike. I hear the whispers that were never meant to reach a receiving ear. I tell you this story because that is what the wind does and has done long before the man called Dean Winchester and his angel Castiel walked this land and I will continue to listen to the leaves of trees, here on Earth, and up in heaven. And I will continue to speak, to whoever turns their ear to listen.
He doesn’t remember what the teacher said in response, but he remembers sitting in the hard desk chair for the rest of the day and picking the dirt out from underneath his fingernails. This tree doesn’t matter to us. Nor does this memory. Dean has revisited the memory, a few times, long enough so that it’s not entirely locked in the tombs of childhood memory, but it’s not part of the story, not really.
He looks at his hands and he remember he used to have a scar from accidentally slicing open his own palm from that day. He wonders if Castiel saw that memory briefly, and he puts it out of his mind. Dean knows that Castiel knows him, every molecule, but can barely fathom it. This memory itself is unremarkable, but Dean and Castiel – we will remember them.
It does not worry our tree at first. She does not mind an extra citizen taking refuge in her branches, and the girl has always had stories to tell, though they are oft repeated. She has heard about this sort of thing before, and from the record of the water that seeps into her system, she knows the town is mourning, mourning in a cycle, and it is not hard to know it is the girl.
The ghost sits on the branch she has sat on for nearly a hundred years now and it is a branch that is rotting. She is angry, angrier than our tree has ever seen her (but not angrier than she has ever been).
, our tree asks the angel.
“No,” Dean says, his voice gruff.
“I thought you were my friend,” the girl yells, and our tree would shudder if she could.
“Let me, Cas,” Dean says, and he lays his hand on top of the angels and moves it to where the locket has grown into her trunk.
Our tree does not care about angels. In the grand scheme of things, she is young, but in the land in which she has always lived, she is past middle age. From her perch on a hill, she has watched railways bustle and grow quiet, watched horses go by and then noisy vehicles. She has watched the world changed, tasted the water as it is polluted further and further, and she has never met anything outside the children who play in her woods and the birds who flit through her canopy. She knows about angels, but she has never seen any reason to care.
Castiel remembers the first trees. He does not remember much, from those times, his assignments taking him elsewhere, but he remembers those early trees. It was long before man, and long after most angels had stopped being wowed by the way of things on earth, perfectly happy to play their games up in the heavens, to make their own games and their own creatures who were destined to die out on planets less favored than Earth.
Our tree is strong by the time she meets Dean. She grew tall from a seed on a hill in the middle of Iowa. After they came on their horses, white men eventually wore a trail near the base of her roots, now only frequented by the occasional hiker and the White-Tailed Deer and rabbits. She finds herself as a home to Chickadees and White-breasted Nuthatches and Downy Woodpeckers in winter, and to Robins and Song Sparrows and goldfinches in summer.
our tree says, and the girl lets out another shriek that no one but she and our tree can hear.
Castiel hears, and he hands the locket to Dean, before pressing at her bark again.
He feels different, sharp with adrenaline. She always believed that angels did not feel but this angel is here, talking to her, talking to a man named Dean.
Our tree knows what it’s like to be haunted, or at least she thinks she does. Flies land on her and if she can manage to bring herself to listen, they always have thoughts and gossip about the world around them, the bees and the houses and the rows and rows and rows of corn that spread out from the base of her hill. She hardly ever meets them more than once. She is not young and time is faster for her than the creatures she shares her canopy with, the birds that come back seasons in a row and then disappear, the spiders that spend months crafting elaborate webs, the squirrels that dart up and down her trunk.
our tree rumbles, but the ghost of a girl does not speak the language of trees and does not hear.
The angel presses his hand to her bark and it burns. She is a tree, she is old, and she has seen highways and rail lines and cities rise and fall, but this is a day she will remember.
“Can I bring Sammy?” Dean said, because even then, any future he could see for himself had to do with hunting and Dad and Sammy.
Dean remembers planting a tree. The soil was damp under his fingers. It crumbled as he grabbed a fistful of dirt from the bucket the teacher had set between him and another student. It had gotten under his fingernails. Dean was nine, he thinks. He knew the feeling of dirt; he had sat on damp ground as he watched his dad dig in empty graveyards and said gruffly, “This’ll be your job someday soon, Dean.”
Castiel has always liked Earth, the way that it’s been as much of a laboratory as an exhibition. He liked his assignments in those days, whispering thoughts into the minds of early rodents, taking in the essence of the ocean curving itself around the planet.
His shoulders ached as he brought the ax down, and Sammy had told him to be quieter and Dean had grumbled at him. He has a dream about this moment, sometimes, of Sammy telling him, “I’m reading,” and the wind ruffling through Dean’s hair, and Dean thinking, I would do anything for you, and then usually he turns around and he’s in hell. It’s a hell of a way to spoil what once had been, if not a good memory, a passable one.
he says to her,
The man named Dean Winchester is speaking as he approaches with the angel. His voice is gruff and he’s saying, “Right over here,” and then the two of them crouch at the base of her trunk. She wonders how no bird, no squirrel, no water molecule, has ever told her how an angel makes you believe that you are important, even if you are just a tree on a hill in Iowa.
“We’ll have to burn the tree,” the man named Dean Winchester says.
Our tree does not know about Dean Winchester yet and she would not care about him if she did.
He is an angel that is older than life itself, and he is dying too, much like her. It makes our tree feel even more grateful towards him, towards the tiny piece of himself that he uses to heal her from the damage her ghost has done – is still doing, as she howls and tears through her barren branches. The hole in her bark knits itself closed, and she knows intimately, suddenly, the depths of how much angels can feel, and how much this angel feels for his companion.
Every part of our tree wants to scream out, yes, yes, yes. But she is a tree and she cannot remove something from her wood any more than a man can grow wings. The feeling of the angel is overwhelming – Castiel – he imbues upon her, not Cas as the man – Dean – had called him, but not so overwhelming that she does not notice the familiar presence of her ghost, the girl.
She does not know what he is talking about. Our tree does not know her neighbors well, and her canopy is one of the tallest in the forest. She has been here longer than almost anyone, now. She has met a thousand chickadees and a million ants have marched across her roots. Even the seasons do not come as they used to, and the girl who has taken up residence in a crook of her branches only comes angry.
Suddenly, it goes quiet. Our tree had not been paying attention to Dean Winchester, but only the angel. Or, as she knows from her moments with Castiel’s grace, she has only been borrowing Dean’s angel for a moment. The silence is great. Castiel removes his hand from her bark.
Our tree will eventually die slowly, and she will finally let go of dying her roots in a hot summer storm, the wind whipping around her. As she moves on, she will think about what she has seen, the girl and the angel and the birds and the water, and she will let them all go.
