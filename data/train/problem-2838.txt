Castiel paid Benny extra attention, whispered little asides to him, and even touched him often while talking. Benny was so ready to fall into the comfortable warmth of it all. When Benny went to get more bottled teas from the refrigerator in the garage, Castiel, following him on the pretext of helping, pushed him up against the wall, and kissed him until Benny felt off-kilter. He remembered that he’d already decided to take what Castiel would give him until he decided he was ready to move on. Benny didn’t know why he would accept it, maybe, it was knowing a little about Castiel’s traumatic childhood?
He waved to the man as he walked up to his front door. The man looked at him and waved back. The kids noticed him too. They waved at him. He waved back. His own kids had gotten off of school already. They were probably waiting for him to get home.
“She’s only been outside for a few short periods, so she’ll enjoy being out here with you two.” Dean replied through cupped hands.
“Gabriel, you’re sweating buckets. No one is looking for us. No one followed us. If anything, your paranoia is the only thing calling attention to the fact that anything we’re doing is possibly unsavory.” Michael shook his head. Gabriel was great at joking around, lying even, if it meant a prank or joke would work as he planned, great at telling half truths and lies to get out of homework or sneaking out with friends, but Michael never thought Gabriel would have a freak out about just copying papers.
“I think it would behoove you both to at least try to present a more seemingly remorseful countenance when we enter the office.” Castiel admonished them. “And keep the laughter to a minimum. Non-existent at best.”
“The more they name-called and said awful and derogatory things, the more upset and visibly agitated he became, but even though they, and anyone else, could see how upsetting it was for Jack, they would not stop. He was self-comforting, self-stimulating by twisting his body in a rocking motion while swinging his arms. I think at that point the other boy, the one who claims he got hit first, well, I guess he realized they’d pushed jack too far. He reached out to Jack, and grabbed his arms. I don’t know what his intention was, whether to calm down or to try to stop him. I don’t know, he maybe could have been doing it to be mean, but it didn’t appear so from my perspective. But as soon as he grabbed Jack’s arms, he must have frightened or overstimulated Jack, so Jack flinched and swung about, elbowing the kid real hard right in the nose. It was not intentional. It would never have happened if he had not felt ridiculed, threatened, and perhaps, fearful or anxious leading to panic. When the boy’s friends saw the blood, they jumped on Jack, and began punching him and shoving him. I could not stand by and watch them gang up on one, so my brother and I headed to his defense. By the time we reached them, his sister, Claire, and their new friends were also joining forces to aid Jack. None of this would have occurred had the original three aggressors not instigated the entire incident. Neither I nor my brother are ones to throw punches, but we will if it means going to the defense of the oppressed or outnumbered.”
Dean noticed a moving truck and a Goldish looking 1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V parked next door. A new family is moving in. That’s nice, he thought to himself. Maybe they have kids that Ben and Emma could play with. He then noticed a man in a suit and tie and a trenchcoat. He also noticed that the man did in fact have kids as he watched a blonde haired blue eyed fifteen year old girl and a dirty blonde blue eyed fifteen year old boy get out of the car. Twins. Of course. Ben and Emma would love that. They didn’t really have that many friends. It’s been five years and they
“I assure you, I will have my secretary fax a copy of all of this information to you following our call. If you’d like to make a deposit into the account to continue payment for the post office box, I can do that right now. That way you can be assured the post office doesn’t retake possession of the box and return the contents of the box to the sender.”
Finally, he had everything from the bottom section out, but the small safe. He quickly turned a combination on the small safe, pulled down on the handle, opened it, and looked inside without touching or taking anything. Closing it, he reached behind it and Gabriel and Anna heard a series of clicks. He then began to turn the combination lock on the little safe again. He pulled up on the handle as he came to the last number. The safe did not open. Yet to the surprise of Gabriel and Anna, the entire small safe tilted up and forward. There was a small recess underneath the little safe. Michael checked his watch, then put his hand into the recess. They could hear him pressing buttons.
“Hey, I’m sorry to bother you, and actually for all of this. I just wanted to say thank you for speaking up for my brother. That doesn’t happen a lot with people who don’t really know him.”
Dean hung up his phone. It was just after 10pm. He’d just gotten off the phone with Emma. He’d called earlier to speak to the twins, but once again Emma was in the shower.  Ben had talked his father’s ear off about his latest issue of Hot Rod magazine and an older issue of Muscle Machines that had a similar article on Chevy truck mods. Dean was never really a truck person, he preferred old classic cars. However, he loved the quick absorption of knowledge, ability to understand and hold discussion over pros and cons of different engine set-ups and modifications, but most of all, the enthusiasm his son displayed. He’d actually learned a few things when he and Ben began talking about vehicles Ben was interested in. He definitely was a chip off Dean’s engine block.
Adam looked up and his eyes widened. “Okay, quick, hurry and bring him to X-ray! I’ll get everything set up, then give him a sedative and something for pain.”
Castiel got in his car and almost decided to go home. He was not used to drinking so early, but was glad he’d stopped by to drop off Miracle’s collar. He really would never have guessed that he’d have gone there thinking he’d be just a few minutes, trying to make up for having kept Miracle from the person that needed her, to staying there over three and a half hours, and leaving with Dean wanting to be friends. He had not really had friends that were strictly his friends in a very long time. Not since Betta and André. Most of his friends were just parents of Jack and Claire’s friends. It was congenial, but nothing deep. He kept things that way so he did not have to lie and tell half-truths. And now he wasn’t even really real friends with Dean yet, and he’d already told a few half-truths, and though he told no lies, he did not correct any misconceptions.
Dean watched the clock nervously. He was so glad he’d gotten to have a bath and feel properly clean, but now he felt like he was as dirty as he was before the bath. He was sweating and a bundle of nerves. Miracle kept trying to jump up on him to soothe and snuggle. He’d let her up for a few seconds, because he really felt the need to have her close, but he’d make her get down after less than thirty seconds, which was the longest he could stand smelling Cas’ cologne on her. He didn’t so much mind the distraction nor the road his thoughts went down, but he was not down with the constant erections he was getting every time she’d jump in his lap. He did not like the just plain gross way the dog was sitting directly in the way when his arousal made itself apparent. It made him feel like a warped degenerate. He didn’t need Sam to notice that every time his dog was near that he’d get aroused. That would be too awkward to explain.
“Glad to know.” His smile brightened as he relaxed. The same could not be said for his department back in Witchita.
“How are your twins doing? I assume your brother, Sam?, told you he brought them to see me?” He said as he leaned against a barstool.
“Oh, I’m not here for the decor, Sugar.” Benny smiled at him. “We could be in The Louvre or in the garbage dump slums of India, and what I’m looking at right now would still make the place I’m standing in shine with all the beauty I’d be looking for.”
“Aw, Boo. We can’t get milkshakes unless we stop.” Anna hugged him closer as his mouth opened wide in a silent cry.
Michael eventually put a stop to “what if’s” and “we coulds” when they started coming up with different ideas of how to approach Naomi and Chuck, and make the deal for Castiel.
Dad!” Jack agreed. “I have a new boyfriend, Claire has a new girlfriend, you finally decided to live your truth and also have a new boyfriend. What was good about your day today, Uncle Gabriel? Spending time with us?”
“I’m really not at liberty to talk about the entire incident until my partner is finished with his interview, as I told the doctor.” She indicated Castiel. “But I can say that all of our children were some of the main players in the incident. There were thirteen to fifteen main antagonists, approximately half which included our kids. The other half were the opponents. There’s two opposing stories on how and why the incident began and who threw the first punch.”
“I swear we’re like fish in a fish bowl on display in here. No, like lobsters in the lobster tanks at the grocery store, just waiting for the chef of some pretentious restaurant to come sniff us out and point his finger at us while the seafood lackey slowly clicks his tongs, waiting to pick us out of the tank and hand us over to be submerged into the pot of our deaths in the boiling water of blackmail and deceit.” Gabriel furtively looked around, trying to figure out who among the other customers might actually be a coldblooded hitman. “I think it’s the anarchistic punk rocker over there. He looks highly suspect.”
“I see the reflector way up there.” Jack pointed. “Well, I did but now I don’t see it. It was orange.”
Finally, Dr. Novak agreed, and the entire group began to move from the auditorium. Claire and Jack headed towards the junior high side to retrieve their belongings from their classrooms and lockers, while Ben and Emma went to the high school side. Their parents and uncles went to the office to sign the papers and check them out of school.
“Ooh, your good at this espionage stuff! I’m impressed.” Gabriel gazed with admiration on his older brother.
“Alright, alright. But read the back before you crumpled up dreams.” He handed the note to his brother.
Castiel, still tearful, nodded, because he did not trust himself to speak without erupting in tears.
Ezekiel put down the bag of clothes Adam had told him he put in the room’s closet for Dean to wear home. He walked over to the bed and put his hand on Dean’s.
“He likes different ones, ham, mushroom and feta with tomatoes is his current favorite, but he likes spinach artichoke, sometimes meat lovers, vegetarian, ham and pineapple,” an audible gasp came from Dean.
At first, they used the bounty to buy things they wanted during vacations. That saw an increase in the amount of swearing, as well as in how quickly the money accumulated. Then, they used it for gifts for friends and relatives, which kept the swearing at a level status quo.
“What is going on with you, Dean?” Sam asked after this last time. “You’re the one patting your lap to make her jump up on you, then you tell her to get right back down. You’re giving the poor thing mixed signals.”
They were discussing which therapies had been effective and which were not seeming to help at all. The consensus was that Castiel was still showing “deviant homosexual perversion tendencies” when shown pictures of his friend Inias as well as other “attractive” little boys. His brain wave patterns showed increased activity as well as heightened mental, physical and emotional stimulation. This was counterindicative of any conversion, or aversion from homosexual attraction following applied therapies. During sleep and upon waking, the child showed signs of erections, self-stimulation and orgasms. Since it was not known if the child had homosexual thoughts or was merely self-stimulating as some children were known to do, they recommended mild shock treatments to try to abate the amount of self-stimulation and erections, since it appeared that neither the aversion nor conversion therapies nor medications were having any effect on abating erections or deviant attraction to others of the same sex.
“I don’t care if your dad likes my dad! My dad likes Mr. Lafitte and I’m not going to help keep Mr. Lafitte away from my dad, just because you think your dad might like my dad, because what if he doesn’t? Or what if your dad just wants to fool around? My dad hasn’t had anyone since we were born…and, and I just want him to know how special he is and to have love in his life from someone who is giving and caring.” Sam could hear the anguish and tears threatening to spill in the tone of Claire’s voice.
Castiel had found three community bulletin boards to place the flyers on at various places on the main street of the town, as well as in his brother’s shop. He was disappointed that the people he asked in the few stores open this early, knew nothing. Suffice to say one was new to this town, one was an extremely surly teenager who was doing community service picking up garbage for some legal infraction and the third was either very hard of hearing or possibly had a comprehension issue, because they just mumbled, nodded, took a handful of flyers and placed them on the counter. Gabriel said he liked the quaint informality of the small town. Castiel thought it was a bit more quirky and less quaint.
“I invited him back tonight for pizza and to meet up with his brother when he comes to pick up his twins, so don’t fret. Just plan to stay awhile.” Dean spun his chair around. “C’mon. Let’s go meet the troops.”
By the time he’d finished eating, cleaned the kitchen, emptied the majority of the boxes and showered, it was well past midnight. The kids could finish emptying the few boxes left. Most of it was their toys, books and clothes anyway. Castiel locked up, refilled the dog’s water bowl, turned out the lights and headed to his new bedroom. He was surprised that the mattress was actually perfect for him, not too hard, not too soft. He checked his alarm and was just rolling over after turning off the light when the dog jumped on the bed, did two circles and settled down to sleep next to him with her chin on Castiel’s hip. Cas gently massaged the dog’s head, smiling to himself, and promptly fell asleep.
Castiel saw the good-sized farmhouse come into view as his car got to the crest of a very small hill. The multi-gabled, very traditional farmhouse had an overall T-shape. Castiel guessed that the smaller section at the top of the “T” was the house that had formerly occupied the land by his barn home. The larger section of what was likely the original two story house on this land, had an, at least, metal roofed, two-sided wrap around porch from what he could see, and a large chimney sticking up at one end of the roof. The smaller section had a chimney of the same brickwork which led him to surmise that the chimneys were new or newly rebuilt.
Without saying a word, Michael began to empty the contents of the backpack onto the table and then spread them out into separate stacks on one of the beds.
. If only he didn’t think he was such a know-it-all. Tarantulas scuttling around in the gnarled upper branches of a deep canopy. Critters are scary. Big jungle plants. Mmhm, lots of plants.
“I don’t know. I really had no interest in him, except to get out of there. Though he did have some of the bluest eyes I’ve ever seen on a human.” Dean added remembering looking into them while the doctor attempted to clean that ungodly red sauce off his…
They explained that the girls all went to help Emma with her paper sculpture and they were amazed at what she’d accomplished so far, and were actually excited to help her continue working on it more as they went along.
Dean nodded, taking a short, sharp breath, he placed his hands on the wheelchair armrests and pushed raising himself off the chair slightly.
Dean thought about when he was in the hospital and the way the doctor kept winking at him, smiling awkwardly, the smashing of the ice cream on him, which he still had the man’s handprint visible on his arm, and the way everything he does seems to rub Dean the wrong way.
“You can cut to the chase and just tell me how soon I’m going to get this cast off.” Dean said slapping the afflicted leg’s thigh.
“We need to get downstairs and clean up the kitchen, get Anna’s things from the front lawn and hose down the blood off the front walk.” Michael directed.
“Wow, they should did a number on your jeans,” he said holding up the cut up pants. “Why’d they even save these?”
“I understand, so, if you’ll allow me, you’ll be happy to hear that I did indeed find a small account that I don’t know how, but it slipped by the wayside. Very strange, very strange indeed. A most unusual occurrence.” They could hear him clacking his keyboard and making hemming and hawing noises. “Yes, somehow or for some reason, it was not linked to any of your joint accounts or any of her private personal accounts nor business accounts. It does not even list your home address nor her married name as listed on her driver’s license identification information.”
“Mr. Winchester invited us to utilize the road anytime we wanted.” Though the last time he’d seen Dean Winchester, the man was not very pleased with him, and had rescinded his request to address him as “Dean,” Castiel decided he’d take the short cut, and deal with any anger and consequences later.
Adam nodded and helped Lee fold the chair up and place it in the bed of the truck, and then Lee hopped in the front passenger seat as Benny made sure Dean was fully on the seat, strapped in and comfortable.
“So, yeah, even though Sam knows, I haven’t told Dean, and Sam doesn’t know I haven’t told Dean. I’ve been being vague or just not answering his questions. It’s not anything either of us haven’t done before, like when he or I both had things going with Pamela at separate times. Sometimes, because of our past, we kind of use awkward silence as a way to keep our distance, especially in this small town.”
He wiped the sweat and blood off his face with the filthy kitchen towel and began refilling the large safe as it was before. He was very precise in placing everything exactly the way it was when he first took it out. He opened the small safe again and adjusted the items to their positions from before he tilted the safe forward to reach the hidden buttons. He grabbed a tissue from the box on the credenza and wiped the inside of the safe down and everything he touched, before closing the safe and replacing the painting.
“I told him the way some people are against it and some try to change gay people or say they’re crazy or hurt them. That even some people just tell them to go away and never come back.” Ben reiterated. “But he doesn’t believe it still happens.”
“Pamela? Firefighter Pamela from the calendar? And your friend Lee from the hospital, calendar and restaurant?” Castiel inquired, smiling and blushing even more.
Ellen, Charlie and Jo had picked up the snacks and cleaned the kitchen, putting the leftovers in several small single serving sized containers in case Dean wanted to snack later.
“C’mon, let’s go play our games now.” Ben exclaimed. “Uncle Benny said he’d close up and finish answering your dad’s questions. Right, Uncle Benny?”
“Yes, I think I recall several years back, during an estate settlement.” Sam nodded at the phone. “Please, to make it easier on all of us, please call us by our first names. I’m Sam; my brother’s Dean.”
“No problem. He was wronged. They were awful, I’d do it again all over, scrapes, cuts, bruises and all.” Emma held her chin high. “I can’t stand to see people bully people they think are lesser than them. Those girls will learn. They’re just young and stupid right now. Wait until they try to go out in actual real public as a couple. Then they’ll be on the other side of ridicule and bullying. They’ll change their attitudes. Even lesbians aren’t immune to being bullied. Believe me. Right, Dad?” She turned towards her father.
“Also, I want you all to pack a to go bag. Pack your most important items, whatever money you have, toiletries, passports, IDs—everything you may need to travel quickly, bc I will take him and you all, out of the country if I have to.” Michael ran his fingers through his hair. Gabriel knew, just from that one gesture, how nervous Michael was, because Michael never did that, and always had every hair perfectly in place.
“Well, that’s not helping.” He looked down at the very noticeable tenting of his pajama pants and poured another shot. Miracle whimpered and put her chin on his leg.
Gabriel had always been there for him and the kids, more than their other siblings. Michael was too busy. Lucifer and Raphael were never around and Anna was busy traveling.
“Yes, I want to be closer to you and Michael.” Castiel looked around the room as if he thought he was being watched and listened to. (He probably was, to be honest.)
After they had their files in order, the originals and a couple copies well hidden, and readied the copies they’d use as leverage, Michael would confront their parents on Sunday afternoon directly after church. Usually Castiel was driven back to the institute following Sunday evening dinner. He would not being going back their this Sunday night nor ever again.
“I gotta hand it to you, Sam, I know you’ve always had more patience than me, but I never knew you had a thing for outright self-torture.” Dean shook his head and reached out to pet Miracle’s head. “I do not have it in me to deal with this shit. Weasley little money grubbers.”
He bent down, squatting on his haunches and finally looked at the excited dog as she jumped on his lap, rubbing and whining for petting. Hugging her, he curled around her, nestled his face in her head and neck, and whispered sweet doggy nothings in her ears. Then, he gave her a hearty pat on her sides and stood as she jumped off his lap.
“I, too, have, uh, similar news. And I…I,” he looked down at his hands clasped between his knees, and reached toward Gabriel, who immediately held his left hand. “I…don’t know why it’s so hard for me. Well, I mean I do know why it’s difficult for me, but in the face of how strong you two are, I…”
“Fair enough. But no interference.” Sam admonished. “I came to let you all know that your mom, and your uncle, are on their way back from a call, so they’re running a little late,” he looked at Clark, then Claire and Jack. “Now give me hugs,” he said to Emma and Ben, “so I can get home. Be sure you all are outside, in the truck and ready to hit the road to school at six in the morning. I have court early.”
“I promise. I won’t. But Ben told me anyway and that Uncle Benny and Mr. Winchester had their own room and that bed was more fun to jump on than the bed for Mr. Winchester and their mom. He said I could try it next time I go over. I asked him if I could and he said yes because I was still not too big!”
“So, let’s all get our things together now. We don’t have a ton of time. Make sure you don’t forget anything important. After you’re all packed, take your bags down the back stairs and stow them in Gabriel’s car.” Michael directed.
Claire told them that she knew her dad went on a date and she thought it might have been with Benny. She told them how they were to have a family discussion that very evening where her dad had told her he had very important things to talk about that might create some sort of upset in their lives.
So that’s what happened. They both agreed not to talk about it. They just got cleaned up and dressed and then ate breakfast with everyone else.
They pulled into the Greyhound Bus Terminal temporary parking area for drop-offs. Michael dug in his car console and began to pull out a few handfuls of change. He handed half to Gabriel.
Dean sullenly thought that Castiel must’ve made some remarks to his children about how he was quick to anger and to try not to upset him, or something along those lines. Well, it was not undeserved, but he thought they’d gotten past that on Sunday. He wasn’t going to let it get him down, but he might confront the doctor at a later date about it.
“Alright kids, make yourself a plate and get a drink. No soda after ten. You know the rules guys.” He looked at Ben and Emma.
“I already told you I had no problem with it, cher.” Benny smiled. “”Like I said before, that boy knows what he wants and sticks to it.”
He fed the dog another chicken breast, gave her fresh water, made himself a quick bowl of cereal with sliced banana and some green tea. After cleaning the kitchen, he took a quick shower and readied to leave. He opened the door to see if the dog would leave. The dog would not go outside and just sat there looking at him expectantly.
“No, I am not. They are at home, the barn, waiting for my return right now, which is why I need to head out now and leave you to your day.” Castiel said as he stood up. “I hope that they get to meet soon, seeing as we’re almost neighbors. It’s a rare thing for twins to have twins in the same age range and school, let alone live in the same area.”
“Woah! You bring goodies like this in and you just might get a personal welcome everyday. Or I might have to demote you if I end up gaining weight.” She clapped him in the back. “Follow me.”
“Thanks. Can never be too careful these days and I certainly don’t want to piss off my partner and co-workers.”
“No, my friend Lee had picked up the mail for me earlier. I guess the package must've gotten here after my final ‘friend visit’ of the day. I was wondering why you were toting that around,” Dean laughed reaching for the package. “Pine Prairie Printers. It’s about time! They were supposed to be here last week.” he set the box on his lap. “Thanks.”
“I’ll definitely be a regular customer.” Dean said around the forkful he’d just shoveled in his mouth. “Yep.”
He looked down and rubbed her scruff, then looked up to see Benny just turning his head away and looking pensively at his feet with a slight shake of his head. He was getting ready to ask Benny what that was about, when the secretary addressed them.
Naomi looked to Chuck. “Not another child going off the deep end! This is a hereditary trait from your family and you know it!”
“I’m OK, girl,” he ruffled the fur of her scruff, smiling, “I just need this thing to calm down,” he said gesturing at his semi-wood.
“Oh, Uncle Benny is from Louisiana and speaks Cajun French. So when we were babies, he used to speak it to Ben and I, sing us songs when he’d put us to sleep, and tell us all the old stories. For some reason, I picked it up better than Ben, so…I don’t know, sometimes we just fall into talking like that.” She giggled. “I just told him he was a good for nothing, lazy old man who should not pout.”
However, Adam later told Dean that the information was supposedly wrong and there was nothing involving underage anything. It
Astonished at Dean’s sudden change of heart, Benny raised his eyebrows, then nodded and winked at Lee and Adam. Dean noticed the wink, but said nothing. His friends and his brother were planning something, but he didn’t know what.
Jack had rolled over now and was taking pictures of a worm making its way out of the soil between the blades of fragrant prairie grass in the last burst of the brilliant rays of the sunset. Claire, phone lens pointed up in front of her, was slowly spinning around in the breeze as a flock of blackbirds flew into the western light, shadows against the orange and pink canvas of the heavens. Castiel took a deep breath, locking in the scents and feelings of the atmosphere with the visions and emotions he was feeling. ‘Sometimes the only photographs one needs are the sense memories’ he’d always tell the children. This was one of those times.
“Since we didn’t really discuss housing any sheep or other critters Jack may decide to get, I’ll answer any questions anyone may ask.” Benny winked at him before they got out of the car. “Keep both of our asses covered. Sam’s usually pretty discreet, so I don’t think he’ll be a problem.”
“That is where the bottom of the slip would be, if I hadn’t written my name and number on it and torn it off to give to him.”  Michael’s smile faded a bit. “I only wish it wasn’t such awful timing. I don’t want to get anyone tangled up in our mess.”
He could feel his breaths getting quicker, shallower and shorter. He didn’t want to frighten his children, but he could no longer hold back the dam. Gabriel was rubbing his back and still holding on to his hand, but he could hear his brother holding his own breath and sniffling. Claire was holding his other hand in both of hers and pulled his hand up to her lips, gently giving it kiss after kiss, saying, “It’s okay, Dad,” over and over like a mantra and Jack had come to sit on the floor and lay his head on Castiel’s knees hugging his legs tight.
“I agree, brotha. What kind of man treats a little girl like that.” Benny shook his head and tightened his grip on the wheel. ”It’s one thing to be desperate to keep a good job, but it’s certainly a whole other kettle of fish when you leave a thirteen year old to her own devices to travel eight miles alone.”
"Please, Mr. Winchester. You’ve got to calm down. You may have done serious injury to your broken leg!” Castiel, hand pinching his own nose, tried to sooth through the pain, and blood dripping from one nostril down his lip.
“Come on, Dean, I’m not telling him to make someone he’s just getting to know, his kids’ uncle. That’s pushing the relationship boundaries.” Sam looked pained. “But if you were in the market for uncle material, I couldn’t recommend anyone more highly than Benny.” Sam grinned.
He pulled the car over fully off the road, shut the engine off and put his arm around Jack’s shoulder as they got out of the car. They walked together up the hill, Jack snapping his own photos on the way.
“I don’t know, Sam, can we just drop it. I just need to get laid. I don’t even remember the last time I had sex. There’s just someone I find attractive and I’m not their type. I just…let’s leave it at that. C’mon, I’m going to call the bank.” Dean wheeled himself back into the house.
“Exactly what I said. Or well not quitting exactly but you own the company anyway. I just don’t want to work here anymore.”
Dean always tried to take care of and help out his friends and family, and he had extended that loving care to his adopted town when he moved to Cottonwood Falls. He was not a rich man, but he was good with his hands, had developed good friendships with many of the people in the small town as well as in the sister town just a few minutes north. He liked people, never minded lending a helping hand, and people liked returning the favors. He was easygoing and tried giving people the benefit of the doubt, until he found out different about their characters.
The Crowd cheered. Crowley blew his nose into a tissue and hissed at anyone who looked at him funny.
“Yes. Angels.” Castiel pulled the door closed behind him, then opened it back up, remembering he wanted to air out the house.
“We.. we know. We’re sorry dad. Please don’t be mad. Don’t hit us. We won’t do it again.” Emma looked like she was going to cry.
“Okay Dean. There’s just enough room for us to be able to stand. Can you stand for me? We’re going to see if you can stand up.”
“Don’t hurt yourself thinking so hard.” Dean was looking up at him trying to figure out why he was so interested.
Balthazar was going to make a joke about it, but considering the small amount he’d been clued in on already, he refrained.
“I take it as the highest compliment and would be honored. But I understand you have really just met me and would have no reason to trust that I’d be a worthy bearer of the title. If you ever change your mind, I’m willing.”
The voice on the phone was deep and Dean’s brain short circuited for a few seconds. He shook his head, cleared his throat and then said,
“Ok, sir. Let’s breathe. Shhhh. Shhh. It’s OK.” Ezekiel rubbed his right arm up and down making hushing sounds. while he pulsed his open palm slowly on Dean’s naked chest, in time to what should be Dean’s normal rate of breathing.
“Well, Miracle, seems like you come ahead of me on the ‘Who Is Missed Most’ scale,” Dean laughed as she padded along behind him into the great room. He was so happy to have her back. Just having her in the room with him calmed him. Even when Sam blew up and started yelling at him about how he handled his finances, it did not phase him as much as he knew it would have if Miracle had not been there.
“My new friend Kaia’s stepfather had to go into work, and since it’s in the opposite direction of where they live, he told Kaia she’d have to walk home or wait for the bus after school. It’s like eight miles! It would take her over two hours to walk home, so I told her that you were so nice and were letting us stay, and Clark, that surely one more would be OK, until she could get a ride home.” Claire was holding the girl’s hand protectively. She pleaded with Dean, her large blue eyes glistening, reminding him so much of Castiel’s eyes that he lost himself for a minute as his heart went out to her.
Dean and Castiel came down first, then Sam and Gabe. Then the kids came down too. Lastly was Bobby with Adam. Adam stood with Michael.
“What are you talking about, Dean? Make what sound perverted? What’s going on with you today?” Sam put his pen down and turned to give Dean the once over.
make him tear up. Next to them was Benny and Lee. Awkward that Dean’s ex boyfriends were here and then there was Mick. Castiel’s ex boyfriend.
The hunter’s eyes were watering and he was still gagging occasionally. He closed his eyes, imagining the silicone was smooth velvet skin, he tried to recreate the feeling of a man attached to it, that the man was the one making Dean gag on his dick and had his eyes watering from the efforts. It wasn’t Dean giving a blow job, it was him doing his absolute best to keep up with being face-fucked, and he loved every second of it. The hunter was whimpering and moaning around his toy, and when he imagined the man attached to the dick, it didn’t even surprise him that it was Cas’ scruffy face he saw, smiling down at him in amusement, playing a game to see how far he could push Dean until he broke.
Dean was well aware of his own sexuality, and he hated himself for it with every fiber of his being, but he’d made it this far in life without succumbing to that deepest desire. Sort of. The only man who’d ever fucked Dean was himself, and tonight he was going to do the honors once again.
Castiel slid across the bench so he was sitting next to Dean. He rested his head on the hunter’s shoulder, an arm wrapping around his waist as he curled himself to fit against Dean’s side “We’re not fighting tonight. I wanted my opinion, and that is my opinion. Ignore it for now. Allow it to take root and ruminate on it when we’re not together. I know you will.”
“Yeah, of course. You guys ready? I’m starving. It’s Dean’s turn to shop which means there won’t be anything to eat here until he runs out of beer.”
He crouched next to Dean, first carefully removing one boot, then the other. The jeans were next and he folded them as he rose. Grabbing one set of pajamas from the folded pile of clothes on the table, he brought Dean’s flannel pants, holding them up with a small smile.
“Son. Son, I know this is hard. She’s your only sister and we’re going to do what we can to make sure she has the best of care.” Chuck watched Michael pull the file folder from the closet and continue walking down the hall into his office. “Where are you going? Michael, what’s the meaning of this? What are you doing? What’s that file?”
“I’m so sorry. I am. I’m so sorry!” He hugged her again and sobbed into her shoulder. “I promise. I won’t let them hurt him anymore. God, why didn’t I stop them sooner!?! I’m so sorry. Never again. I SWEAR they will not do this to him or anything EVER again.”
“Nno-o-o, hee-hee. I-I’m-m-m h-h-ha-app-py-y.” He laughed more and smiled bigger, tears streaming down in large droplets.
hit you. Just ask me next time okay? Come here. Give me a hug.” The three of them hugged and shared a moment.
“Let’s go, guys. I’ll see you in the morning. Call me at Fen and Narf’s house when you wake up, so I have time to get dressed. I’ll meet you at the library when it opens.”
“I’ve already gone over all of this with my new lawyer. He is also outlying other items I may have forgotten at the moment or had not thought of when we spoke.” Michael took a deep breath, and if we find out that you try to finagle something with any of the important people in your pocket, before the papers are drawn up and signed, remember, I have many of those important people in my pocket right now. I’m not stupid enough to think that these are your only copies of these files, but I do know that neither you nor they want any of this information known. And in a few cases, if I gave the originals back to the involved parties, you’d lose your leverage, but I’d have important friends.”
Single Father Dean Winchester had been living in Angel’s cove, Kansas for five years since he and the kids moved from Lawrence. Ever since his particularly nasty divorce with their mother, Lisa, he had been raising Ben and Emma on his own. Well, not
“Well, what a good…” Cas leaned over to examine the underside of the dog. “Girl! What a good girl! You like baths?”
“Mr. Winchester, I just explained to you the delicate process of the mending of breaks of bones of the lower legs. Please understand that it takes more than just wearing a cast for a ‘couple of’ weeks’ to properly heal your type of break.” Castiel realized Dean was still feeling the effects of the sedative, but his little crash course in Dean Winchester logic had him bracing for a heavy pushback on his care recommendations.
”I bet you’re hungry, Cas? I ordered a ton of pizza. Sam got cheesy bread and salad, too, but I’m not sure there’s any cheesy bread left.”
“I love when the sky has the high wispy cirrus clouds like that so we can see the Angels’ wings.” Jack announced throwing himself on his back as soon as they reached the top of the hill. He began snapping pictures of the sky and clouds.
“You two go wash your doggy hands and faces before anything else. I think we all received enough love and licks to smell up the couch.”
He finished cleaning up in the bathroom, made sure Miracle had gone out and was settled, and wheeled himself, naked, to the bed. He decided he wasn’t even going to struggle into clothes again tonight, after rubbing out another one while cleaning up. He was too hampered by the wheelchair, and to be honest, lack of patience alongside anxiety, to squeeze into the laundry room to constantly wash the minimal amount of clothing he had downstairs.
“Crap!” Dean looked down at his clothes.  He grabbed his beer and downed the dregs. “Now I have to struggle to clean up again and change.
The last thing he expected to hear was Balthazar telling him it was delightful, but then again, one rarely could predict things that would come out of Balthazar’s mouth. However, it was usually encouraging, expressive and positive.
Dean went to the garage and grabbed one of his cleanest shoes from the few pairs of older shoes he used for working around the farm and went to grab a sock from the lost sock basket in the laundry room. He never thought of how handy that would come in until now, because all of his socks were upstairs.
“We’re young adults, in your case, still a kid. People don’t usually suspect kids of blackmail and extortion. Get a grip. Let’s go.” Michael grabbed the backpack full of files and carefully put the files they’d sorted out to copy into the front compartment.
“I’m going to need a little help getting to the high school and getting in the building for a conference ASAP. Over.”
After piling their plates with pizza and salad, Chris and Gabriel sat at the sizable table where the kids were also taking their seats and scooping sherbet into the little bowls. The table was full and there was much loud talking and laughter between the small side conversations and the group as a whole.
Dean leaned his head against Castiel’s temple turning his face to feel Castiel’s breaths. He did not let go of the doctor’s wrist.
“Oh, I definitely think so. I’ve been thinking so for a very long time. It’s one of the reasons I introduced you to André and Alice. Unfortunately, Alice came on a little stronger than André, and though your relationship with her helped you loosen up and get you on the right road, you hit some potholes and areas of yourself that needed roadwork. I think it’s time the construction signs come down and you get back on that highway, love.”
They attracted the attention of the deputy and Castiel, both of whom turned to look at them with slightly annoyed looks, which immediately changed to smiles from both of them.
“I know, but I really don’t have a lot of time to go over this and I don’t want heavy food right now, just a salad to tide me over.” He adjusted the strap of his leather briefcase bag on his shoulder. “Just be sure to check those post office box access times. The sooner we can get there and get in it, the quicker we can figure it all out. Also, try to see if you can find the key or combination for it anywhere. Maybe ask them when you call if it’s a combo or key, double check that we only need the death certificate and your marriage certificate or whatever else they may require to legally access it if we cannot find the key. I’d prefer doing it by just being able to use her key.”
The kids put the blindfolds on. Once he was sure that there was no way they could peek, he drove to the animal shelter. He parked and helped his kids get out.
The amount of compassion and love he felt pouring through the phone almost broke him. He took a deep breath and answered.
that they would force gender roles on his kids. Whenever he, Ben and Emma would travel to Lawrence to visit John and Mary, they would give Emma little pink and sparkly things. Emma
He groaned again as his phone started ringing. It was of course, his father because who else would be calling right now. He picked up his phone and answered.
“Probably because we don’t usually wear ours at home because she has a weird thing about wanting to see our eyes when we speak with her.” Micheal smirked.
“I had a late night, barely had time to change clothes and get here. I didn’t have time for breakfast, so thanks!” She smiled sweetly at the brothers.
“Hi, this is the high school calling. Is this Mr. Winchester? Father of Ben and Emma?” A young woman’s voice spoke with a bit of trepidation.
Castiel and his two were standing near the door. Claire was talking with a young dark haired girl around her age. She was one of the two that had been signing out when Dean and his twins were called to the back. The girl looked worried and the older male that she was with was no longer in the office. There were no other students being checked out.
“You said you’d come, Bon Rien. Don’t make a bahbin! Plus it’s dark and I told you last Wednesday night we thought we heard coyotes.” Emma complained.
“Alright. Let’s get going.” Michael clapped his hands together, and headed out the door to begin packing his own bag.
When they entered the cafeteria, they were directed to sit at either one of two long tables where a few other parents and children were already seated. Dean recognized most of them and nodded as they got to the table they chose. He had to pull his chair up to the back end of the table, Ben sat to his left, Emma to his right, and Benny sat next to Ben. There was some empty space between them and the rest of the people at the table. Deputy Barker and her son, Clark were closest, sitting across from each other near the middle of the long table. The other long table was barely half full.
“How many sheep do you have? Do you shear their fur yourself?” she asked as she hurriedly picked up her plate and her drink in her hands. “Do you clean and card the wool? What do you do with all the wool? Do you dye it or spin and weave it?” Claire was getting ready to ask more questions until they all laughed.
Not long after Sam informed his brother that he was starting to pack for the Wichita move, Dean’s wife, Lisa, was diagnosed with an inoperable terminal brain tumor. Sam had changed his life around to be here for him, Lisa and the, then, eight year old twins as they struggled with the inevitable. Dean did not know what he’d have done or how he would have made it through it all without Sam.
“Now, let’s go over these files and find the most pertinent information to manipulate our parents and save Castiel.” Michael picked up the few files he’d been holding before and finished sorting them.
Castiel went to change, then grabbed the Lost Dog flyers, his wallet and car keys.  Little Missy followed him downstairs and sat on the floor next to Jack’s chair.
Sam sighed as he ran a hand through his hair. Now he had to tell Dean and Castiel that they would be stuck in that cave for two weeks.
“Cassie, Michael isn’t going to take you home. We’re just going to get some milkshakes, ok?” Anna hugged him and wiped his snotty nose. “And do you know who is buying all the milkshakes for us?”
“Um, yes, I’d appreciate that as I’ve been on the road a while this morning.” Castiel stood still with his box of pastries.
While the kids were setting up for their online school and his brothers were finishing setting up whatever else they needed to set up, Dean went into the back and checked for some supplies when he realized that they were out of honey.
“Until it was just against him and his sister.” Jack said from behind him. “Then Emma left him in the dust!” He ran back to the bar giggling.
“Then let’s go. We’ll drive closer into the city and call Anna’s friend.” He pulled out his car keys and held the door for his brother as they exited the Kinko’s. “You did write your note for Mom and Dad saying you’re out for the night, right?”
“When I was seventeen, Dad brought me into his office and started telling me that as the eldest son it’s my responsibility to carry on our family, our history, our fortune, our future. He reiterated the old story we’ve heard our whole lives of how far the history, importance and lineage of our family can be traced back and how the family fortune has only grown throughout the centuries. That it’s our, now MY, responsibility to keep building it and pass it on to only responsible members of the family who will do the same and keep and grow the family and the fortune, keeping ties with the…let’s just say for now —the important movers and shakers of the world, not just those holding high office.”
“Furthermore, when I went in to the hospital, mainly to make sure you, and my one other patient, were doing well, since I was not due in until Monday. That’s two days from now, in case you have trouble counting. I fed her, turned the tv on to keep her company, because I was not going to turn her out in the rain that morning, and apparently, she’s intelligent enough not to go out in the rain. By the time I got home, after picking up my children, the vet was closing, so I did not have enough time to come back out here and bring her to check for a chip. I have that scheduled at noon today.” He looked at his watch. “That’s in ten minutes.”
“Nice little family. That boy is just adorable. If you didn’t tell me they were twins, I’d think she was a year or two older. She’s got that sullen fifteen year old vibe.” Chris laughed. “I’m sure that won’t matter to the belles and beaux though. She’s a beautiful girl. They’ll be lined up around the block.”
“Yay. Uncle Benny.” Claire said flatly. “Can we get to me yet? I was supposed to go first. Besides, like you said, we’re pretty much both calling him that anyway.”
Jack swung himself side to side violently trying to shake Claire off of his back, both of them laughing the entire time.
“My sister, Anna, too.” Castiel said proudly. “But more on the side of medical and pharmaceutical sales.”
Dean noticed Gabriel’s gaze had shifted to Castiel, and he saw several intense emotions run across his face: regret, love, determination and pain. Before he could say anything, the hall door opened as Claire and Jack came up to the group.
“Don’t you fret. We’ll find out and make sure the girl is OK.” Benny watched Dean for a minute and smiled. “This right here is why I'll always love you. No matter what ever happens between us, I know what you are inside. And it’s a good man, whether you think that or not.”
“Jeez, Dad. No!” Emma said exasperated. “Sometimes I think you’re an idiot, Ben. Let’s get our stuff and start our homework.”
“What. Are you doing, man? What’s going on. You're making me start to worry. Seriously, do I need to get in touch with your VA docs? I’m really getting concerned.”
“Thank you.” She said in her most authoritative voice. “We are going to speak to the parents in two groups. First, we’ll have one group go to the cafeteria and one group to the auditorium. Then, we’ll possibly have the cafeteria group head to the auditorium for a final meeting, depending upon how things go.” She looked around the room, eyes resting on every parent at some point in her speech. “I am hoping to resolve this matter today. I don’t need or want the students, involved or not, to have to learn and study in a tense and possibly hostile environment. Best to get these incidents out in the open, talk about them as honestly as we can, speak to the children individually ensuring no coercion or intimidation is taking place and take swift disciplinary action as well as counseling, if needed. And that is what I intended to accomplish now. I’d like to thank and commend each of you for staying for this important moment.”
“Would you like to be topped? Squirt of Jizz Cream or we have Moist Glaze?” Samdriel said with a suggestive tone incongruent with the seeming innocence of his boyish face.
He hoped the kid’s rooms were tidy. He had no idea what condition the upstairs bathrooms or playroom were in. He hoped that maybe Ellen or one of his other friends who’d been there to help out, had made sure things were cleaned up there. He had no doubt that if Ellen had gone upstairs, it was clean.
“Oh, yeah.” Jack hung his head. “I don’t want to be alone and all Claire wants to do when she gets home is call her new friend.”
“Good, good. Thank you.” He kissed her hands and stood. “First, we get the house back in order. No word of our fight. You go gather your things from the lawn, then go shower and change into everyday street clothes. Call one of your friends to see if they’ll cover for you to maybe say you’re to go out with them later, maybe spend the night, if you don’t feel like coming home. We can meet up later and I’ll tell you what happened. Otherwise, just act as if you’re still angry, hurt and don’t want to speak to them.”
The happy, relaxed look on Dean disappeared in an instant, and his eyed shuttered. “Cas I don’t think that’s a good idea.” The hurt Castiel felt, the way his heart clenched in pain must have been outwardly project, because Dean swore. “Dammit, Cas. Don’t do that.”
He stood, walked around the bed awkwardly, then slid in next to Dean, tucking the covers around him. “Is this better?” He mimicked Dean’s position, sitting up against the headboard, then scooted over from the edge of the double bed to against the hunter’s side.
“You were what? Where?” That surprised Dean and his eyes widened in surprise. It was enough to make the momentary panic pass. “You know what. I don’t want to know. Are you okay? It’s two in the morning, Cas. We got home and you- and I didn’t- Why the hell didn’t you answer your phone!?” Anger was easier for Dean, and he held onto that. He could be mad at Cas for making him worry, without emphasizing the part where he admitted he was worried. “I thought something happened to you, man!” Emphasis on the man. Buddy. Friend. Maybe not platonic, but not... not platonic. Or something. Dean was losing his train of thought now.
He saw no other option. The hunter needed to get it out of his system, and things would go back to normal. He wouldn’t feel this loss of control that had been plaguing him. Maybe he wouldn’t be so angry (as if that’s a possibility), and more importantly he could return to burying himself in random women and letting it be enough.
The moment was so perfect, and Cas didn’t want it to end. When Dean broke the kiss for air, Cas blurted out the first thing that came to his mind.
Three hours later, the hunter stirred. Specifically, he rolled over across the bed, pressing himself against Cas’ body. Dean’s head rested against Castiel’s thigh, and his arm was snaking around the angel’s calf to snuggle it. With a fond smile, Cas allowed a hand to fall onto Dean’s head and he absently stroked his hair while he read. He hadn’t find anything useful yet, but the general monster knowledge could be useful sometime down the road. He checked the clock, it wasn’t even 6 a.m. He’d let Dean sleep a while longer.
“Yes, I’m going with you. Sam wants to spend time with his girlfriend, get rid of us, and avoid us fighting all at the same time.”
“Please!” Dean didn’t realize he cried out, begging the empty air. “Fuck me Cas!” He was almost /yelling/ out to no one, lost in his own pleasure and the fantasy.
Something was going on. Sam didn’t know what happened, but Cas was pissed. Neither of them said a word on the way over; Dean didn’t even turn the radio on once.
Cas didn’t reply, so Dean put his phone away, grabbed a beer, and settled in to pass the day with a Western movie marathon. Moping over Cas wouldn’t solve anything.
“What was I supposed to tell him? Sorry Sammy, you overheard me swearing at you because you calling made Cas move across the car and I wanted to cuddle? Outside of the fallout of that, do you know how that sounds? Do you? I’m a dude that doesn’t use the word cuddle! Especially to his brother.”  Dean probably could have been more eloquent and less loud, but it was Cas. Lately all roads with Castiel ended up with the hunter frustrated, usually with himself.
“Sure, Cas. Whatever you want, babe.” His eyes were already closed, and Dean made no effort to cover himself.
“Hello? I’m back. Forgot my laptop. Dean?? You up yet?” Sam’s voice echoed through the bunker, getting closer to Dean’s room, and the door was wide open. Castiel turned towards the voice, but he never saw the door. What he saw was the floor, as Dean had unceremoniously dumped him on it.
Dean recognized the words for what they were, an awkward very Cas-like attempt at a joke that was doing an awful job of covering up what Dean wouldn’t let him ask. He felt guilty, and since he couldn’t say what Cas deserved to hear, he swaggered over to Cas and stood at the edge of the mattress where the angel sat. Dean gently nudged Cas’ thighs apart until he was standing between them. What was meant to be a cocky smile instead projected as something soft and affectionate. The hunter lifted his hands, to cup Cas’ face. He leaned down, capturing his lips in a kiss that left no question of Dean’s intentions. It started slow; it was a chaste kiss that grew to exploration, his tongue teasing the seam of the angel’s full lips. Dean had just reached what he wanted, his tongue tangling around Castiel’s when he forced himself to retreat. He stayed in the same spot, pressing another brief kiss to the angel’s lips while he waited for his heart to stop pounding and his brain to start thinking again. What was his point again? He’d completely forgotten.
Now that he could fit almost the whole toy within him, Dean dropped his leg, spreading both of them as far as he could. His fingers wrapped around his length again, and the hunter started stroking himself. It didn’t take long for the mental images to start, and it didn’t surprise him that they were all of Cas.
About halfway through the second movie, Dean fell asleep. He woke up when Sam threw a handful of popcorn at him. His phone was still in his hand and he tried to discreetly check it. Cas’ name was on the screen. The preview had the whole text. It was those heart emojis again, and nothing else. Dean quickly flipped his phone over so Sam couldn’t see it.
Of course he’d cut right to exactly what Dean meant and didn’t want to say, then go ahead and say it.
They shuffled into the hotel room around 2 a.m. Castiel was carrying both bags, upon his insistence. Dean was dead on his feet despite sleeping in today, or yesterday technically, so he had not put up much of an argument. Cas had spent the last two hours of their trip arguing with Dean about taking over driving. He didn’t need to sleep, and he was (in his own opinion, at least) an excellent driver. Dean wasn’t having it, but at least the bickering  had kept him awake. Castiel had been tempted to simply knock the hunter unconscious after he swerved once, but he didn’t want the fallout of a deservedly angry Dean later.
“S-so, you’re staying here and Me and Cas are going?” Dean looked as odd as he sounded, asking for clarification on the very obvious.
“I’ve got some pajamas you can wear.” The hunter was completely positive he could make up a lie to his brother if Sammy saw Cas wearing his pajamas. Sam wouldn’t, so that was that.
“Why don’t you enjoy the remainder of your day and evening alone, Dean.” Cas sent Dean what was meant to be a reproachful look then was gone a moment later.
“I would hate to appear at an inconvenient moment.” Castiel’s usual way of speaking so straight forward made it hard for Sam to pick up if it was sarcastic. Cas turned, glared pointedly at Dean, then turned back to Sam. Well, that part was certainly obvious, Sam thought to himself.
Ending the call, Dean handed the phone back to Cas with a tight smile. He knew exactly what was coming “What was the point in lying to your brother?”
“Dean, are you still mad at Cas about yesterday? Honestly, I didn’t mind coming home. Cas is fine, we’re all fine, and we’re all here. It’s nice to have a false alarm for once.”
“You’re sorry you made me late?!” Dean threw his hands up in frustration, yelling at the empty kitchen. “He’s sorry he made me late and upset me. Well that’s just great!” Dean’s palm smacked the counter in frustration. “What the hell, Cas?!”
“That’s what the problem was?” The words were almost a squeak and he proceeded to choke on air for a moment while his body tried to remember how to breathe. “You let me go on and on like a moron, and your problem isn’t that I lied to Sam, your problem is with the pop star I picked?”
This was the part he hated the most. He hated how good it felt to sit there, knees bent, legs wide, open and exposed, waiting and wanting. It was weak. Unnatural. He was less then because of the desire.
The memory faded, as Castiel willfully blocked out the next scene, and Castiel was again pondering a generic flower bed. The memory surfaced without his consent, and Castiel was forced to recognize the reality that ruined his moment of bliss. This morning, Dean had woke up late, blamed Cas for it, then threw on clothes and ran out of the room before Castiel had time to consider getting dressed. When Castiel arrived at the breakfast table, Sam was on his way out the door, and Dean had already gone out to the car. They were getting an early start on a hunt, Sam said. He’d told Castiel to relax and enjoy the break.
Faster and faster Cas thrust into him, pulling out almost completely then pushing back in, as fast as he could.
He was getting too close, too soon. Dean stopped stroking his length and slowed down his movements so he was fucking himself at a more sedate pace. The fantasy changed with the speed, and now they were on a bed, slow thrusting and looking into each other’s eyes. NOPE. Dean was not handling that fantasy. He opened his eyes and shook his head, as if that would erase the intrusive images. It was one thing to think about Cas railing him, anything to do with that... absolutely not.
Finale? What finale. 15x19 and 15x20. Never heard of her. This is a bit of a filler chapter. This one shot is really turning into a whole story on me.
He’d failed everyone that mattered but Cas. That wasn’t true. He’d failed Cas, too. If it weren’t for him, Cas could have left with the angels. He’d have his wings, he’d be /safe/. He was a mortal now, with no emotional support to rely on, burying himself in any and all pleasures life could offer just to try to deal. If Dean allowed himself to even consider being with Cas like that, he had no doubt that he would lose him completely.
Dean rolled his eyes. Sharing embarrassing childhood stories was too much. He was not sure that he didn’t want to know.
It was in the early morning hours shortly before dawn broke when Dean had finally relaxed into a peaceful slumber. They were in each other’s arms, spent after a blissful night of lovemaking. Though they had started in a more position that Dean would describe as more manly for him, within the last hour or so, Dean had rolled over and wiggled his back against Castiel’s chest. Unable to resist, Cas wrapped Dean up in his arms, holding him in his protective embrace while he pressed soft kisses to the hunter’s shoulder and neck. Dean had relaxed at that, and though he was asleep, he could feel the peace radiating from him. Dean, who never dealt with his emotions. Dean, who generally exuded mistrust, and fear for his loved ones even when he slept. Dean, who did everything for everyone and very rarely thought of himself, was simply... happy. There were no words attached to the feeling, though it was almost like a prayer. He could feel it from Dean, and he vowed to himself there and then that he’d do whatever he could to bring Dean more moments like this. Castiel was not a vain being, but he knew that the change in Dean was as a result of himself, or at least the combination of himself with Dean. He would have to fight against Dean, but Castiel was strong and he knew that ultimately Dean would be happy. He’d known Dean for years. Dean had never slept like this before, not once. He would help Dean battle his own inner demons.
“Wow, what the hell, man? We take you in, we let you into the family, and then you turn my brother into some sort of-”
The plug wouldn’t be enough for the need that had built within Dean. When he got this weak, that usually worked. He could wear it all day, to remind himself of the feeling he craved, then jerk off, clean it, and hide it away with all of his desires. No, tonight Dean’s fingers curled around the dildo, and he carefully extracted it and the lube. The thoughts that plagued him required a more direct touch. First, he blared some rock music and pointed his boombox towards the window so anyone who happened by would hear that and not the sounds the hunter would be making tonight. Second was a thorough cleaning and drying of the toy. Finally, Dean could allow himself to relax. He mechanically undressed, taking off every piece of clothing he had on. Each item was carefully folded and put on a table for him to change into after. Dean was usually a slob, but in this everything was methodical and perfect. He couldn’t show any cracks in his façade later, and this was a part of the routine.
“Yeah, we’re good. No crap to figure out.” Sam was watching Cas while his brother said that line, so he saw the hurt that flashed across Cas’ face. He wasn’t surprised. Dean avoiding his problems wasn’t anything new to him. Dean must have seen the look too, and it surprised Sam when he spoke again, in a quieter tone. “We’ll deal with it later.”
It occurred to him that the least he could do was apologize for his part in making Dean rush this morning, so he sent a text without realizing how late it was.
“I honestly have no idea, Sam. They are rather comfortable, though.” Cas picked at the cotton pants, once again marveling at the comfort.
“If you wanted to argue with me about the nuances of humanity in general, I guarantee that you’ll be victorious. Unfortunately for you, the only human I’ve spent the last few years paying entirely too much attention to is Dean Winchester.”
Castiel deepened the kiss, clinging onto Dean. His tongue swept out across the hunter’s lips and Dean opened, wanting to taste Cas. The world faded away for that moment, and they were two people... beings... something, together. In lo- Making out. It was hot.
“I don’t care for much of Lady Gaga’s material.” Cas stated seriously, his gravel tone making the words sound as if they were a serious revelation, not as ridiculous as they actually were.
Could Castiel have chosen a female vessel from the start, he would have. As it was, Castiel’s vessel was no longer anything other than himself, and he was happy with the fact that this would be his physical appearance so long as he was tied to earth. He had no desire to leave when this was where Dean was.
“Excuse me, Dean. Am I allowed an opinion in this? Whether I voice one or not, you do whatever you want.”
“Fuck!” He cried out suddenly, moving in a frenzied state. He kept going, fucking himself hard and fast. The last image in the hunter’s head was him riding Cas in the passenger seat of the jeep, out on an abandoned road, too turned on to wait until they got to safety. He wasn’t riding though. He was on Cas’ dick, but he was gripping the seat behind Cas, trying to hold on while his best friend quickly fucked into him from his position on the seat beneath him. The feeling was too much for Dean, he’d been pushing the toy into himself too hard and squeezing his length too tightly for him to last. Dean finally cried out Cas’ name, coming hard and spilling onto his stomach. One spurt managed to reach his chest.
Sam was long gone, Dean had finished his dishes, showered, pretended to make the bed, and then stared at his phone for a full hour.
“Yeah, I just washed everything and- Son of a bitch. It’s sitting in my closet.” He started to slow the Impala, looking for a spot wide enough to turn her around.
Was Dean imagining things or did Sammy’s words sound like a warning? He was definitely imagining things. Sammy didn’t know. Sammy couldn’t know. He wouldn’t know, because there was nothing to know.
“Perhaps I could go? I wouldn’t mind chipping in on occasion. I do live here.” Cas said, standing and walking out the door with Sam.
Sam sat down next to Cas, and made a show of taking a bite of dinner. He chewed and swallowed before he spoke again. Dean and Cas were glaring at each other, but at least they weren’t speaking. The silence was definitely better than the screaming.
“Yeah, sure. Why not?” Dean was hoping Cas would be back, but his text was encouraging. Speaking of, Dean needed to clear that off his phone. “I’m going to grab my jacket. I’ll meet you in the garage.”
He sat up and rubbed his hair with one hand, unintentionally making his bed head worse. He opened  his mouth to call for Cas, but he didn’t know what time it was, or where Sam was. A quick look around the room showed Dean that Cas definitely wasn’t in the bedroom. He checked the clock on his night stand. It was noon? “Crap.” It wasn’t that Dean had any plans for the day, but he didn’t think he’d sleep that late. His stomach grumbled so Dean decided to drag himself out of bed for coffee and some breakfast.
Suspecting Dean would be busy feeding himself for sometime, Cas stepped back from the bed. Dean and mornings did not go well together, even if it was past noon. He was surprised when a strong hand wrapped around his forearm. He looked from Dean’s hand to Dean himself, his brow furrowed. Did Dean want him to stay? Castiel did not want to assume. The hunter lifted his other hand, lifting one hand in a clear gesture to wait while he chewed. So Castiel waited, then waited a little longer. It was a very large bite of food.
“Where are we going?” Dean asked, taking the napkin from Sam. “Possible Wraith. Jackson, Tennessee. No big deal.”
“Nope.” Sam followed Dean to the kitchen, then stopped short. “Wow. You cleaned? Awesome. It looks great, man. Anyway, I’m going to grab my laptop and head back. Call me if you need anything.”
Dean dropped the tray on the counter next to the sink, not registering his brother’s exist, or the fact that Cas managed to angel magic up a clean kitchen before he left. He’d call Cas and apologize. Once Sam was gone.
“You wash, I’ll dry. It won’t be so bad.” Dean sipped his coffee, his plate empty by now. One arm slipped around Castiel’s shoulders and it was the easiest thing in the world for the angel to lean into Dean’s side, his head resting on the hunter’s shoulder. A brief kiss was dropped to the top of his head and now it was Castiel’s turn to smile. He tipped his head up at Dean, his wide grin and unrestrained happiness showing. “C’mon, don’t do that. You made breakfast and probably destroyed the kitchen, too. All I did was eat, don’t look at me like I just did something great, Cas.” The words were delivered in a light hearted manner, but Cas could easily see the self-censure there.
“I know you don’t sleep, but I’m running on fumes. Would you mind if we just uhh... went straight to bed? I need to knock out for a few hours.”
“Why wouldn’t you tell him that I wanted to listen to Taylor Swift? You usually put her on when I ask.”
“One of these times you’re going to give me a heart attack,” Dean said in a bad attempt at a joke to cover his still-racing heart. It was because of being startled, that was all. His eyes narrowed and he looked Cas up and down clinically. “Not a scratch on you. Of course there isn’t.” He started to pace, pulling at his hair. “Where the hell have you been? What were you doing?” ‘Who were you with’ almost came out of his mouth, but Dean knew better.
Dean choked on a mozzarella stick, but he recovered quickly. Cas seemed not to notice the elder Winchester’s conundrum and answered Sam immediately. “Yes. I didn’t want to intrude on anyone’s plans.”
Shame and anticipation were the two emotions warring within Dean as he popped open floor boards beneath the rug of the small, dingy dwelling he called home. Beneath the floor boards were a safe, and Dean put in the combination he knew by heart. The numbers he’d chosen to set the lock only worsened the sense of shame and his own disappointment in himself for his weakness.
It was kind of cute, the way they stood there: Dean holding Cas in a dip, and making out like crazy. They were in the woods in the middle of the night, standing in the headlights of the Impala, and Dean didn’t think to panic for the moment. He broke the kiss first. Unlike Cas, he needed things like oxygen to survive. When his eyes opened, he smiled down at Cas, his eyes crinkling. “Hey.”
Cas wasn’t wrong. That wasn’t a bad solution, actually. Even if Dean wasn’t aware it was something the happened. “Let me grab those.” He lifted the much heavier bag over the bench, and put it on the floor next to his own bag. After a brief glance at Cas, Dean focused his gaze on the road and cleared his throat. He made sure to not look at Cas at all, because that would make this little speech impossible to get through. The hunter hadn’t said anything yet, and his heart rate had already picked up. He could feel the steering wheel slicken beneath his palms, and Dean took a deep breath to try to calm himself. It didn’t work. He hated this. “I know I’ve been a pain in the ass, Cas.” Literally. Dean smirked to himself at that thought and continued. “I know how hard it is to put up with me. I don’t know that I’m going to get easier to deal with. Thank you for not giving up on me. I’m trying, Cas. I want to get there, but I’m not.”
Dean woke up with a stretch. He reached out, expecting warm flesh, and found cold sheets. One eye cracked open suspiciously. The bed was rumpled, and the indentation from Cas’ head was still on the pillow, but there was no Cas.
Looking back now, he could see that Dean wasn’t read. Castiel now understood that for someone as beautifully complicated as Dean was, simple emotions would not be simple to him. Pure love wasn’t simple to Dean, it was complicated, convoluted, mixed up in fear, trauma, and repression. In hindsight, Cas realized that he also forgot to factor in Dean’s entrenched ideas of genders, sexuality, and that any relationship he had was doomed to end in physical and emotional pain.
It was not the first time that Cas had thought he was a lost cause when it came to Dean. He was hopelessly in love with a grumpy, awkward, mortal who avoided Cas more often than he spent time with him.
Dean stopped putting food in his mouth for a few seconds, and replied to Cas, though he was looking at Sam the entire time. “By all means, Cas. Fly your feathery ass in whenever you’d like.” The words were about as nice as anything Dean tended to say, but there was an edge in his voice that Sam picked up on.
“Oh.” There was an awkward pause then, “Yes, they are.” Castiel didn’t know what a fitting explanation would be and he did not relish lying to Sam, so he sipped his coffee instead of elaborating.
That was apparently as much berating as Cas was willing to take, because he pushed back from Dean, doing a fine job of glowering himself. “You woke up,-” Cas lifted his hands to make air quotations for the next three words. “-chewed me out, then ran out the door. How was I supposed to know when you were coming back? All your affection last night turned into terror this morning, and I didn’t hear a word from you. So I found a park, I stared at flowers, and I brooded for-” Cas stopped and pulled out his phone so he could check the time. “Fourteen hours.”
“I’m sorry, what?” Dean was already on his second piece of bacon, and his mouth fell open in shock. Several crumbles fell onto the tray. “Did you say this is turkey bacon?” His eyes narrowed in suspicion an he stared at the bacon in his hand, investigating it for flaws.
Cas, on his knees between his legs in front of the couch, while Dean held both his legs and watched his best friend relentlessly slam into him. A couple minutes later the image shifted and Dean moaned loudly as he pictured the toy he was using as Cas, fucking him from behind in the shower while the hunter had his hands splayed on wall bent over and legs spread.
He had no idea how this would work. In the long run Dean knew it wouldn’t, but for now he wanted to keep this to themselves. If no one knew, nothing could happen. Nothing would change, nothing would be weird, and most importantly, Cas wouldn’t be a target for his enemies. This way was much better. If Dean continued telling himself that, maybe he’d actually believe it.
“Because I’m sitting against the wall. If I were to move, you would still have to move to let me out. I’m not using my abilities to switch table sides in a crowded diner.” Castiel’s eyes were narrowed at Dean while he spoke.
“Why doesn’t he have to move?” Dean inclined his head towards Cas while his arms folded across his chest petulantly. Sam had to bite back a smile at how ridiculous this entire situation was.
Very slowly, he pushed it into himself, automatically tensing at the initial intrusion. Dean forced his body to relax bit by bit, and when it did, the tip of the dildo was in him.
“Sirens are worse.” Castiel stated the very obvious, then lifted his head to frown at the backseat of the Impala. “So much for my research. Perhaps one of the books has a mention of sirens.”
Somehow, this entire world they’d lived in was a direct result of Dean’s actions and his personality.
Sam walked ahead of Cas through the garage door, and Cas turned back to give Dean the kind of smile that made him want to say stuff he shouldn’t then pin the angel against the wall. He found himself smiling back for a second, then cleared his throat. “Please behave.” Dean muttered under his breath, then brushed past Cas to walk around to the Impala.
Dean definitely should not have asked. “Shut up.” He wanted to be annoyed with Cas, but instead he was grinning from ear to ear like a fool.
He sat on that bench until well into the night, staring at the flowers, barely blinking and unaware of his surroundings. As he sat he contemplated a set of green eyes, looking at him in panic and terror with none of the softness of the night before, and Castiel wondered what that meant for his future.
Cas briefly considered turning a lamp on, but Dean seemed to sleep better without light. “It’s between four and five in the morning. It’s very early, Dean. We can talk about it when you wake, if you wish.” He eased the hunter back towards the mattress, trying to use Dean’s confusion against him instead of brute strength. Castiel was certain that Dean would not want to discuss anything in the morning, if he managed to remember it, but he wouldn’t object to the discussion if he chose it.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed as he passed through the door, leaving it open. “Good morning, Dean. I made you breakfast. Your brother went to Eileen’s. He left a note on the kitchen table. He left around eight this morning.” Striding across the room, Cas settled the tray across Dean’s lap, making sure the coffee was directly in front of him. “It’s turkey bacon, eggs, toast, and pancakes.”
Last night had been different. It was great, and it was freaking terrifying. He didn’t have any time to process anything. Sammy wanted to get an early start because Dean didn’t want to spend the night on the road; Sam never asked why so he never gave him a reason. It worked out in Dean’s favor, because it turned out that Sammy had a date.
Hoping the yelling was done for now, Dean pulled the Impala onto the road. Sammy was probably enjoying the show, and this wasn’t a discussion anyone but him and Cas needed to be involved in. “I’m exhausting?”
He quickly rinsed himself off and got out of the shower and dressed with his back to the mirror. Dean couldn’t even stand to look at his own face right now, he was that ashamed of what he’d done.
Reaching out, Cas crossed the small distance between them and took Dean’s hand in his, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “I thought you’d be on a long trip because you left so early. I didn’t understand what happened this morning, so I went to a park. I spent all day trying to find a plant that matches your eyes exactly, and there isn’t one. I think it’s because the color shifts. It’s something I’ve never seen on a human before. Your eyes are the same color, but they’re somehow... effervescent. No, that’s not the word. They change with your emotions, and it’s incomparable to any vegetation that’s ever existed.”
“No, I waited until after he was gone to go to the store.” Cas replied. “I’m glad you slept in. It took me multiple attempts to make that breakfast. I have quite a mess to clean up.” What the angel thought would be so daunting to admit to wasn’t anymore. Not when Dean had that smile that crinkled his his eyes while melting Castiel’s heart so thoroughly.
Dean glared at his little brother as he shuffled past him to the kitchen. “Cas-” He abruptly shut up. He almost said too much. There would be questions that Dean couldn’t answer if Sam asked, so he had to avoid them at all costs. “Cas mentioned he was going out when I picked him up. Did you talk to him at all before he took off?” Dean already knew the answer.
“You had headphones in. In the dead silence I heard the song, said ‘huh. Cas is weird’ to myself and went back to sleep.”
It was several minutes later when Dean’s voice interrupted Castiel’s silent musings. “Did you talk to Sam before he left?”
Sam was home now, it was nearly two in the morning, and Cas sends an ‘I’m sorry I made you late’ text with heart emojis?? He had to talk to Cas about that. What if Sam saw? He’s a dude. Dude’s don’t send heart emojis to other dudes. He pulled out his phone, and read the text again, his lip curling into the ghost of a smile.
“Yeah, Dean I do. If you two are going to act like little kids, then I’m going to treat you like it.”
Dean slipped into his room, pulling out his phone to open the text and clear the notification. He wasn’t sure what to reply. The phone was in his hand, his thumb hovering aboard the keyboard. What should he say?
Sam sighed. Cas was being weird again, but whatever. “When Dean gets up, can you let him know I’m going to the library to hunt down a couple leads on potential cases?”
“I need like three more hours.” Dean had rolled onto his stomach in the middle of the bed and was mumbling into Castiel’s pillow, where his head now laid. One arm swung across Castiel’s lap.
Cas couldn’t help from snorting an amused laugh. “Of course, Dean.” He ought to take the opportunity to make fun of Dean. If the positions were reversed, he was certain the hunter would take advantage.Cas didn’t have it in him, though. He was so adorably disheveled, and it made Cas feel needed.
Happy Thanksgiving to those that celebrate, happy Thursday to everyone else! Another chapter for you. Sorry it took a few days, but the good news is the next chapter is well underway! I hope you enjoy, it's been a tough week.
This was the perfect opportunity to make a dirty comment, one that came easy to Dean. He almost did, but he made the mistake of glancing over to Cas before talking. He looked so confused and lost that Dean could no longer bring himself to razz him.
There was no foliage on earth that perfectly matched the green in Dean Winchester’s eyes. Castiel should know, he’d seen every plant that ever was and understood what evolution would lead to every plant that could be. None of them were as striking as Dean’s eyes.
Dean was uncomfortable under the angel’s knowing gaze. Cas’ blue eyes were intense. It felt like he could see through Dean, through all the walls and layers of protection he had, and that was exactly why Cas had to stay at a distance. Except now, when Dean needed the reassurance that accompanied the discomfort.
Dean typed out ‘I’m sorry.’ then deleted it. That was followed with a really message that ended in emojis he’d never admit to using. That draft was also deleted. In the end, all Dean sent was a lame cop out. ‘Sorry Angel.’
The safe now open, inside Dean removed another box. This was a metal lock box that had seen better days, but it still latched and locked. The hunter removed the key that he kept in the false bottom of his desk drawer, locked inside another small combination lock box that was more modern.
Cas leaned forward to press a chaste kiss to Dean’s forehead. “One day your head will allow you to listen to your heart, Dean. I promise you that I will do everything in my power to be by your side when that happens.” The words were quiet, a husky approximation of a whisper. The sleeping hunter of course made no reply, and Cas closed his eyes. Though he could not sleep, he could relish of the feel of Dean next to him, and enjoy the high while it lasted.
Perhaps he might have revealed it little by little, perhaps Castiel could have studied humans and learned how to be subtle. It had been months since that confession had derailed their lives, and sent them on this new path.
“I thought that something happened to you, or that you left, and I don’t know which one made me feel worse.”
Cas managed not to laugh. In fact, all he did was stand at the bedside, patiently waiting for Dean to complete his inspection. “That is supposed to be much better for you and the package promised it would taste similar.” There was a tinge of censure in his voice, though he tried to keep it from crossing the line to bitterness. “Usually breakfast in bed is better received in the movies.” In the movies, there wouldn’t have been a mess of burnt toast, dirty pans, and batter drying on most of the surfaces in the kitchen, but Cas was hoping he’d have time to clean that up before Dean saw.
He was so distracted by standing there dumbfounded, that Dean realized Sam and Cas’ voices were fading down the hall and he had to rush to keep up. Couldn’t Cas see that this was a bad idea? Like a really bad idea? There was a reason Dean wanted to talk to him later, after he avoided Cas for another hour or three. The guy didn’t even eat. Catching up to his brother and his... his Cas, Dean found Sam and Cas laughing about something, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
“Pardon? No, that was Dean. Yes, your brother was cursing at you. No, I don’t know why. Would you like me to ask him, Sam?”
“I didn’t realize I woke you.” Cas stated solemnly. “I’m so sorry.” His hand was resting on Dean’s chest above his t-shirt; he slid it under the flannel, his arm curling around the hunter’s side. Dean wasn’t a hundred percent sure what was happening until he felt the other hand slip under his jacket and flannel behind his back. Both of the angel’s hands linked together just under Dean’s ribs and he squeezed. Huh. Cas was hugging him in the car. It was a damn good hug too, not that Dean was planning on speaking that out loud. The hunter’s free arm moved from the back of the seat to around Cas, pulling him closer and squeezing him in return.
Sam’s phone rang a couple minutes later and whatever weird crap was going on temporarily dissipated. He pulled it out of his pocket, checked the name, and hit answer. “Hey Jody!” A pause. “Yeah, I’m with Dean and Cas right now. What’s up? Uh-huh. Yeah, that’s closer to us than you. Hold on a second.” He reached across Cas to grab a napkin from the dispenser. “I need a pen. Do either of you have a pen?” Dean and Cas started checking pockets fruitlessly, but a waitress was walking by the table. “Hi, excuse me, I’m so sorry, but do you have a pen I could borrow?” Sam tacked on a pitiful but adorable smile and she handed one over right away. “Thanks. Okay Jody, go ahead.” He scribbled as she spoke, mouthing to Dean that they had a case. “Yep, got it. Thanks Jody. We’re on our way.”
The discomfort in Dean was clear, so Cas leaned up and pressed a kiss to Dean’s cheek. “But you did, simply  by being you.” Color flooded Dean’s cheeks. He was... blushing? Castiel committed that to his memory. Dean, in a wrinkled t-shirt, his hair all pressed to one side, with a tray on his lap, and a shy smile. It was absolutely beautiful. “Why don’t you get out of your pajamas while I work on the kitchen?” Cas moved, lifting the tray and placing it where he was just sitting. He took the tray’s place straddling Dean’s lap. Cas was fairly certain that he had won that exchange. He leaned in for a kiss, intending to climb off Dean a moment later and depart.
Dean was not aware of Castiel’s plan, there was no way he could have been, so his reaction should not have been quite so surprising to the angel. “Oh no you don’t.” The hunter said, pulling Cas back to his lap with one arm snaked around his waist. The other hand cupped the back of the angel’s neck, pulling him in to deepen the kiss. His tongue teased Castiel’s lips, and he opened up immediately, kissing Dean with more fervor than experience.
“I know, you never gave me a chance. You’d push me away, and I had to disappear so you’d feel comfortable. When did I have time to offer an opinion?”
In this scenario, safe in his head, alone in his home, knowing this would never EVER come to fruition, he knew the answer. There were no limit with Cas. He’d let Cas do whatever he wanted, and Dean would enjoy it all. Cas was the only person in this world that Dean fully trusted. The reasons he craved Castiel so intensely was the same reason he could never have him. Trust. If he took Cas’ trust and acted on his desires, he’d lose Cas. That wasn’t an option.
There was no reply, other than a soft sigh that turned into a quiet snore. He had not expected one. If Cas thought it was possible for Dean to consciously hear him, he’d have stayed silent all night. The words Castiel spoke were solely for his own gratification. Had his beloved hunter heard Castiel, he’d be halfway out the door, with his pants on backwards. As it was, Dean slept peacefully, with the ghost of a smile on his lips, and Castiel was content to hold him as long as he could, simply reveling in the feeling of belonging and home that he got from Dean.
“Did you do anything today, Dean? Going topside for some Vitamin D is good for you every now and then.”
He started moving a little faster again after his eyes closed and the fantasy shifted. They were still on the bed, Dean’s bed specifically now, but the hunter was face down , fists gripping the sheets. His back was arched and his ass was in the air, completely on display for his best friend. Cas was gripping his hips and fucking him hard, and even with his face in the mattress Dean could see the stupid smirk on his face as he got exactly what he wanted: Dean a fucking mess for him, spread and loving being used by the former angel. Stupid smug bastard... He couldn’t even be annoyed. He was too turned on and wanted it to happen too much.
As he set the bags down on the small table, Castiel doubted he and Dean would ‘work their crap out’ as Sam requested, but he was looking forward to time away from the bunker, specifically from everyone and anyone Dean knew.
Castiel shifted uncomfortably. This was the part he did not want to tell Dean about. “Approximately twenty minutes before I walked in with the food.” He expected a follow up question, but Dean shrugged and dropped his arm from Castiel.
“Cas, you better hear this freaking prayer. If you’re not here in ten seconds, I am going to kick your feathery ass into-”
“Fuck yeah.” He grunted to himself, pushing in a little more. Once about an inch or so of it was in him, Dean pulled the toy back and started fucking himself with small movements. The thrusts became deeper in time as his body allowed the intrusion until he was finally filled, exactly the way he’d needed to be. This was the overwhelming desire that was ruining Dean’s life. This was the feeling that he /had/ to have. It had been eating at him, gnawing away at his brain, reminding him of its presence about four times a day. Today he’d had an intrusive thought at least once an hour, and he hunter decided he’d had enough of himself. He had to feed that inner darkness, and here he was, doing exactly that. He’d hate himself more when this was done, but right now the hunter was flying on a high.
“For starters, you use my spotify account. Well, it’s Sam’s account that I use, but still. You never made your own... thing. Your music is all mixed up with mine. You listen to a lot of weird music, dude.” There was no malice in the words. “C’mere.” Dean’s arm moved from the wheel to stretch out across the bench of the Impala, and Cas nestled right back into his side. The hunter released a breath that he hadn’t realized he was holding, relaxing with Cas tucked against him, where he belonged. Refusing to analyze that particularly intrusive thought, Dean kept talking. “Also, I woke up to that song like twice last night.”
Dean was feeling uneasy. He hoped Sammy was wrong. Sirens were bitches to deal with. “I’m going to stop for gas. You can dig your books out and see if there’s anything useful.” Cas was an angel, but he wasn’t infallible, and the more information Castiel had on what they were hunting, the better he’d feel. They still had a long drive ahead.
Dean’s arm dropped from Cas and he cleared his throat. “So, uhh...” He pointed at the car, stupidly then got in. Real smooth, Dean. He tapped the steering wheel nervously until Cas was settled next to him. Once he got on the road, the silence was awkward again. This is the part Dean hated. He didn’t know what to do or what to say. He needed boundaries. He was terrified to let Cas in. Even worse, Dean was selfish. He was selfish enough to take every word Cas offered, selfish enough to enjoy the way it felt to fall asleep in his arms, and far too selfish to tell the angel that he felt safe and hopeful sleeping next to him. To tell Cas something like that was to give him the power to hurt Dean. Not just hurt, destroy him. Even if Cas didn’t do it, someone would come along and rip him away. And what about Sam? What about their extended family? How would his dad react if he were here to see Dean now? What would Bobby say? Dean immediately dismissed that thought. He’d stare at Dean as if he’d lost his mind, crack a joke, and move on. A hundred other what ifs and a thousand fears were constantly running through Dean’s head, keeping him emotionally distanced from Cas.
All the parents stopped talking and turned, waiting eagerly to see what Principal Macleod had to say.
Cas looked between Dean and his children, but before he could say anything, they were jumping on their tiptoes, shouting in unison.
