And I'm truly looking forward to helping you."
"You aren't asking me. I'm just sayin' that we'll go together, on your dream trip.
The look on Castiel's face has chaned as Dean said his last words.
I'm not letting my BEST friend die in the dark corner of his living room,  beacuse of some fucking cancer."
But Charlie will always be someone that Dean has lost.
He tells Hank, too, about what a great kid Sam was, how proud he’s always been of him. How sometimes he still looks at his grown up baby brother and feels this unbearable swelling in his chest. He skates over their fights until Hank interrupts to pull them back to the night Sam left for Stanford and tries to get Dean to talk about how it felt.
Dean scowls at his brother's amusement. "Hey. Don't make fun of my medical dramas, you know there's never anything good on when we're on the road."
Dean is not going to let himself tear up at that. Not when he's always known, deep down, that Sam wouldn't care, that Sam wouldn't judge him. Knowing that and hearing it are two different things though.
Sam is in the kitchen wearing an actual goddamn apron, humming to himself as he tosses boiled potatoes with oil and garlic.
Dean pulls Cas into the open part of their living room floor, tugging him forward until they’re pressed together with one of Dean’s hands on the small of Cas’ back, the other clasped in one of his.
relationship without developing codependency, although there is certainly some overlap there. Dependency itself may not be healthy either, but from what you've told me so far, I understand that your working relationship with your brother was a vital necessity, as well as your familial relationship being an emotional one." Hank shrugs. "As far as I see it, dependency isn't a problem until it's a problem. Does that make sense?"
"It's good to see you, Dean," Eileen says, letting go and stepping back so that she can see his face. She's smiling, eyes gently crinkled at the corners. "Sam's been moping since you left."
"Whoa, hey tiger," Dean says, extracting himself and rubbing this kid's considerably more shaggy head. "You get much bigger, you're gonna start bowling me over like that. Taikwondo, huh?" Older Dean rubs his chin and now-Dean can tell he's biting back the words that belong to John, still there on the tip of his tongue, disparaging anything but a mixed martial arts approach, or better yet, boxing. But that's not the point.
“This isn’t your fault,” Sam says.
Emotions aren't vestigial, are they? They're evolutionary, like everything else.
When they kiss, it is patient. It is kind.
Dean laughs at that. "What, like float around as a ghost until you pay off your debts?"
Dean's hand shoots out and grabs Cas' wrist. Cas gets the impression that the movement was involuntary.
Dean makes something akin to sex noises when he puts the first bite of marionberry into his mouth and he notices with interest how automatically flustered Cas becomes again.
It had taken some convincing, but Dean got what he wanted.
He's half-expecting Cas to deflect or deny it. Cas takes a moment to answer, fastidiously studying his fingernails before speaking.
“I never left you!” Dean’s throat is tight and his voice comes out loud and rough. “I may have fucked up, Sam, but at least I stuck around. And you, you just keep leaving. Every goddamn opportunity, since we were kids. All those times you ran away, then Stanford, every chance you got to get out. So just… Just fucking go, if you’re gonna go. Just do it, okay? I never should have dragged you back in the first place, and all the times after - it’s my fault, fine! So get out this time. Go get what Stanford should have been for you.” Dean bites his own tongue to stop this stupid diatribe. Sam has gone still. The anger in his face has vanished, replaced by an expression that might be close to broken.
“Bad luck? We don’t need luck when I have the most gorgeous fiancé in the world.” I grin at her and she laughs loudly before rolling her eyes back at me.
"Does it matter? He's the demon prince and was born and raised to be a demon. There isn't a good bone in his body!"
"Okay, it wasn't but lets forget about that and say this was our first kiss okay?"
“ALL HAIL HIS MAJESTY, DEAN WINCHESTER. KING OF LAWRENCE.” Everyone stood, everyone bowed and everyone applauded. I nodded my head and sat down in my throne, looking out into the crowd. Then my cloak was shoved off me and a new cloak was placed on my shoulders, one that was pure white. I stood up once again and the doors at the back of the hall opened to show Anna in an all-white wedding gown that trailed on the floor behind her. He red hair looked brighter against the white gown and I tried to make myself believe how lucky I was to be marrying someone like this.
"I knew you would be in here, i was wondering why you didn't come back to your chambers." She raised a suggestive eyebrow at me and i laughed.
"Castiel hm? Why would the king of the angels be walking around the border?"
“Ergh, I’m an angel Dean. I am and always will be, I got sent here by the queen to seduce you and marry you okay?” She snaps and I smile subtly behind my hand.
"Hello Dada, hello Uncle Sammy."
“I would have given it to you sooner but I was afraid you might lose it. Seven is an important age for an angel and seen as you love angels so much I thought I would wait until now to give it to you.” Dada smiled at me as he carefully plucked the necklace out of my hands and told me to turn around so he could put it on my neck. When he had fastened it I turned back around to look at him, smiling hugely at him at he tapped my nose. “Beautiful.”
Castiel turned away from his supposedly ex-husband and his heart broke a little when he did so. Was it not enough that he had to see his daughter today, but his husband too? Why was life so cruel to him? Why did it never get better? There were so many questions but Castiel had no idea who to ask them too, who could even answer those types of questions?
"Y-you never said my lord." He bows, not wanting to show any disrespect and i roll my eyes.
I walked down to the great hall, moodily dragging my feet behind the advisor that came to get me. As we got to the doors I heard fanfares from inside to announce me presence before they opened and I walked in, carrying myself high and regal as I did so. I walked down the red and gold steps towards where Gabriel and Michael were stood, going them a look.
"What do you mean you know why?" Dean asks and I sigh.
"Good. Now get out." I run out of the room again and straight past the guards who I could hear chuckling from down the hall. I went into the kitchen and just dumped the stuff for the women to find before turning on my heel and going back up the stairs to watch the ball. I did have to wait for it to finish after all. I walked into the ballroom through the side door and looked around to find another group of angels who were serving people. I walked over to them and asked politely if there was anything I could do to help but they just looked down their noses at me and sauntered off. Wow. Rude. That was really weird and I couldn't help but think about why they would do that? They didn't know me, I have done nothing wrong and yet they just looked at me like I was dirt on their shoe.
"Seriously, it's nothing."
"I know." Is all he whispers before closing his eyes and leaving me alone to my thoughts.
“No, not yet baby.” I whisper to my stomach but another contraction came, this one even more hurtful then the one before. I stumbled over to the saddle and grabbed the timber from inside my bag. I then found some wood and quickly started a fire. I had a bowl also in my pack which I filled with water from the river and began boiling it on the fire while tearing up rags. “Okay baby, we can do this. We don’t need a doctor or physician to help us little darling, we can do this by ourselves.” I spoke to her softly, more comforting myself rather than her.
“Why, m’tired.” He says, cuddling in closer to me.
"You know, it's been exactly seven years today since we moved here." Murmered Dean into my ear seductively, waking me from my drowse in bed.
I see them both crying and lowering her body into the grave and my heart breaks in my chest as i realise i will never see my little girl again. She never even got to open her birthday presents. Me and Dean had bought her travelling clothes and items so she could go off and travel the world. She wouldn't be able to do that now.
“Oh, aren’t i?” I ask curiously and he shakes his head and hugs me, keeping his eyes closed and slowly drifting off to sleep.
"I'm sorry for disturbing your morning prayers, please carry on." I say to the angels who are all muttering in awe at the sight of their missing King. Me, Gabriel and Michael walk towards my study that is placed in the centre of the highest tower. I wanted it to be up there because the view was so spectacular and if I felt like stretching my wings after working hard in my study, I could just jump from the balcony that was attached to the tower and fly.
"Y-y-y-your, i-i-, e-e-, what?" I stutter out, completely stunned by what she just told me. "How?"
"Hang on a second, you already said to Cas that you were going to do that? But you told me that you couldn't!" Gabriel accused and I shrugged.
There was a boy in the clearing, sat on a tree strump casually as he sung the song. An eerily shine glowed off of him as his voice soothed out around the woods. He was a fair haired boy and light skinned which looked smooth, as if he hadn't ever fell over and scraped his knee or climbed a tree before. His eyes wandered too me but his voice didn't falter when he saw me, standing there looking at him. His eyes were a pale but vivid blue, almost as blue as my papa's and he had a soft smile on his face. His eyes were soft also as if he meant no harm so i approached him, slowly.
He remembered the amazing sex they used to have, even so long into their relationship as if neither of them bored of it and he remembered how Castiel used to pray every night before going to sleep, praying for he and Valentina to be safe and okay, and for their family to last as long as possible before they had to let Valentina go and explore the big wide world. Dean Winchester and Castiel never even got the chance to say goodbye to Valentina and now they would never get that chance. He had never seen Castiel once visit her grave and he now expected him to be in heaven or elsewhere in the world.
“I’m 15, nearly 16 summers old.” I say proudly and he laughs loudly.
A few hours later, with the ring on her finger we are sat talking about getting away from here and going somewhere far over the seas. She plans on telling her fathers about me but i tell her not too, they will think i have brainwashed her.
"Cas, no! Please stop it." The demon cries, i can almost hear the tears but they were not as loud as mine. "Can't you see, it wasn't him!"
“This is from dada.” He looks at me while dada looks at us both in confusion. With that I walk out of the room and wait outside for them to make up, peering through the door once again. Papa looks up and dada and smiles slightly as dada looks back in confusion. Papa stands up and walks towards him before putting his arms on his waist and kissing him gently. I smile as the spark relights in their eyes. Dada holds onto papa’s hand and they slowly make their way out of the dining room while I was still hiding in the kitchen. Once out of sight I walk into the dining room and stay still as I hear them go up the stairs.
"I have an idea."
"You forget something?" He glances at the mess I left of the floor and I coughed awkwardly before nodding.
"Dean? Are you okay?" My brother asked, walking into my chambers timidly.
What good would it do to try and speak to him now after all this time? This wasn’t a couple of years he was talking about, this was over 10,000 years!  How much can people change in ten thousand years? A lot, Castiel supposed. Dean had probably turned back to his demon ways and become evil, ripping up Wall Street and conning every man and woman he came across. That’s how demons got their kick now-a-days as they knew the angels would hunt them down if they started to kill humans.
"Fine, Sam! Angels are lower then us, we tell then what to think and what to feel we own then but we don't need them and that's final." I say and nod my head in authority.
"No, it is your choice if you do not want to be king anymore and I accept your decision. I have not come here to tell you off, but in fact to warn you."
I see a man looking up towards out house, his back turned towards us. He is dressed in a long black and brown cloak and his hair is brown and shortish. I move both Dean and Valentina behind me but do not move as we wait for the man to turn around. Finally he does and he looks directly at us with curious and wondering eyes and my breathing stops completely as i look at the man before me. His eyes are blue, not my kind of blue but paler and wiser. His eyebrows are quite bushy and he has stubble adoring his chin and upper lip. As well as his cloak he is wearing a royal black tunic and black trousers. The most curious thing though is when i look down at his feet he is not wearing any shoes, but is in fact bare footed, his toes digging into the grass slightly. I look back up at him in fear and tremble but still hold my family firmly behind me. He cocks his head slightly and moves slightly closer towards us, his movement was graceful and steady. Then he stands a few feet away from us and smiles at me, looking into my eyes and deep into my soul, telling him everything there is too know about me
When it's just him and John, fourteen-year-old Dean turns to him and says, casually, "Hey, dad, could I drive today?"
"Pretty sure that's what you're supposed to do with broken things."
"Are you being serious?"
"Mary Winchester wasn't a demon, sire." He says, looking at me sadly.
"Why should a name assert our gender?" He asks rhetorically and i furrow my eyebrows.
“What about Dean Winchester?” Gabriel asks out of the blue and I look up at him.
"Maybe so Sire, but she could still be alive." He tells me hopefully as i breathe deeply and shake my head.
“I still can’t be with you.” I mumble into the kiss.
"Cas!" Gabriel whined, trying to shake his older brother awake. Castiel whimpered as Gabriel started to untie the knots but I stopped him.
“You…” He mutters and I raise my eyebrows slightly, the smirk not leaving my face. “Why did you let those angels go?”
“Maybe he would want to see you. You never know.” Gabriel shrugs, smiling slightly. “Well, whether you want to or not I’m going to bring him here. So you better shave up.” He winks at me as he walks out of my study, thinking back on the times me and Dean used to be together… oh how long ago the seemed, when everything was almost so simple. I had a wife, I was king, all I needed to do was pretend to be a slave. No big deal at all.
“Touché my lady.” She grins wickedly at me before taking a sip out of her own drink. We had just finished our meal and were now just sitting back talking to each other quietly.
"Me and Sam are half angel and half demon?"
“Yes.”
"Love you baby girl." I tell her
Sam stood up suddenly which made my hand fall limply off his shoulders. He looked down at me and smiled half-heartedly as if to say thanks before walking away from me, leaving me finally by myself. I sighed and placed my arms behind me, resting on them as I looked up at the broken window.
"The honour would be all mine, my lady." I stood up then and bowed at her in respect before kissing her hand. "I will see you just before sunset then?"
"Well, technically it wasn't" I say, laughing slightly and he rolls her eyes.
Cas (pov)
“Valentina! Valentina! It’s me! Its daddy, please look at me!” He shouts over and over again but the little girl did not look up. He tried to approach her but as soon as he got within five feet of her, an invisible barrier held him where he stood, not letting him get closer to her. He banged on the invisible shield and shouted at the top of his voice but she did not even flinch. He could not take it anymore; he could not watch her hum and pick flowers like she used to do if she could not even speak to him. With a sob he turned around and ran as far as he could out of the clearing, out of the woods and away from this place forever.
“Nope.” I shook my head and he grunted in annoyance.
"Castiel, you realise that we are starting tonight don't you?" He laughs and I look at him in shock.
“Hello Gabe.”
"Dean, you're king of the demons-" he started but I cut him off venomously.
"I think it was a demon. I think a demon followed her from the border and set something on her or even tried fighting her him or herself. Then they took my daughter and ran away with her, wanting to turn her into a slave for when she grows up." I tell him and he nods his head.
"that was amazing." I say to him and I snuggle closer to him and he just mumbles a inconceivable reply. "What?"
"S-sorry." I groan into the pillow and he runs a hand along my back and lets it rest on my ass for a second, squeazing it tightly. Soon after, he pushes into my slowly, making me gasp out at the sudden fullness. "D-dean! Oh god, please fuck me."
"I need to-" I stop myself, not wanting to tell him about my daughter’s disappearance as then it would give him the chance to try and find her instead and I couldn’t risk having him find her before I could.
“I haven’t seen in a fairy in god knows how long.” I tell her but she doesn’t look as if she is listening to me. She is just look at the fairy and smiling like she has no care in the world. I wish I had that, I wish I could just live underwater and not have to listen to anybody complain about wars and laws. “What is your name?” I ask the mermaid and she finally looks back up at me.
“MY LEIGE!” He shouted loudly before bowing extravagantly. “How may I be of service to you?”
“Well, what do you want?”
Dean (POV)
Lucifer however found out about Crowley and his scheme and left no mercy upon him when he went to his kingdom and tortured him over and get again for the rest of time, letting him live but prolonging his known death. After that, Lucifer went back to being the devil of the world, the snake in the garden and went back to his old ways.
“This isn’t going to go down well.” I snort and he nods his head in agreement.
“Yes, you do I suppose.” I say and kiss the top of her head as she sits there happily. A few minutes later and Castiel comes back downstairs, rubbing his head and groaning.
However, sometimes dada and papa would fight and they wouldn’t go upstairs together, only one would and the other would stay downstairs with me so I couldn’t go outside and play. I got angry with them once because their fight went on for three whole days and I didn’t like them not speaking to each other. I couldn’t remember fully what they were fighting about but I knew it was something to do with me and not being able to go out. When they made up again they took me out to the beach early in the morning so not many people were out and walked on the sand with me while I ran about, pretending that the mermaids in the sea were chasing me. It was extremely fun but I was very sad when they said that we had to leave because people were starting to come out of their houses.
"C-cas, who is he?" I hear Dean whimper into my ear, his voice trembling. "How did he find us? Who is he?" I don't answer him for a second because i am so surprised to see HIM here, standing right in front of me as if it was the most normal thing in the world. I had thought he had left this world, never to return but here he was, standing there smiling as he always used to infront of me and my family. "Cas..." I look at Dean for a moment and back at the man who is still stood staring at us, his body still, unmoving as he looked at all three of us in turn and then his eyes landing on me again. He looked as if he was about to say something but instead kept quiet, waiting for me to answer Dean.
Claire flipped her blonde hair behind her shoulder. “What did I tell you? Cas is a big softie, I knew it wouldn’t take much. Now come on,” Claire stood up and tugged on Jack’s sleeve.
“That’s great Sammy, I’m really happy for you.” Dean said feeling a little emotional himself.
“Damn. I just remembered, what are we going to do with the kid? We can’t take him.” It felt weird, being a parent. It was something he never imagined himself being. Of course his universe, he was kind of a parent figure to Jack, along with Cas and Sam, but that Jack was old enough to stay at home. Or more likely, he would come along on a hunt.
“Cas?! W-what the hell just happened?!” He asked, feeling himself lose breath.
Jack opened his mouth already preparing to brush Sam off and tell him that it was nothing, but he paused. Sam was Dean’s brother and he knew him better than anyone in the whole world, even more than Castiel. He might actually be able to help him out, at least indirectly.“Can I ask you something? It’s going to sound really weird, but you have to promise not to question it.”
“Thank you, Jessica and Sam. That’s very flattering and we promise to return the favor when he or she is born.” Cas said with a warm smile.
Jack called her only to replay the entire story to her, Alex, and Patience who were listening in on speaker phone. They all sounded very disappointed by their failure although they didn’t blame Jack for it.
“I already slept long enough,” the nephilim protested even though he didn’t sleep at all.
“This isn’t your fault, Jack.” Claire spoke softly, it sounded uncharacteristic for the rugged hunter. “Dean will come around eventually, he’s just stubborn. Maybe if we try something else -”
“You make it sound like it’s that simple.”
“So, the students are nicer in real life?”
I think there's only one more chapter after this. And I apologize now for not knowing how to write fight scenes lol.
“Yeah, well it turns out I wasn’t,” Dean was now standing up walking towards them. “Now what were you saying?”
“But they are your real family Dean. They are the same people, it’s just a different situation.” He heard a voice in his head say, a voice that sounded all too real to be normal, but was his voice nevertheless. “This is what you’ve always wanted Dean. Your family. All together, alive, and happy. With no threats hanging over your head.”
“Dean he’s lying!” Sam shouted.
“H-how?” Jack stammered, glancing down at the devil’s trap.
“Woah buddy, slow down. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around the whole ‘we’re dating’ situation. Also, I wasn’t kidding when I said that I need to sleep. I was just hoping that you would sleep with me...literally.”
“Yes, of course. That’s who I am named after.”
“I wouldn’t look at you differently. I’ve done bad things too,” Jack added, hoping that they would find it reassuring.
“Say what?” Sam sounded surprised.
Dean suddenly woke up with a gasp that quickly turned into a groan. The movement was so abrupt Jack was startled out of his thoughts.
“No way,” he heard Sam laugh. “I mean this is Jack we’re talking about, he probably just misread the situation. That's definitely what happened today at the bar. Besides, why would Jack care about your sex life?”
“Really?” the woman asked, making a face. When Jack eagerly nodded she turned back to Dean. “He’s yours?”
“Sore spot,” Cas told him with a grimace before following.
“No. I mean he is… I guess.” Dean wasn’t sure if being an ancient celestial being was the same as a “genius”. “Know-it-all” seemed like a better term. “So what now? If your such a genius, does that mean your going to help me get out of here?”
Dean rolled his eyes, “About why I did it? Because there’s no big answer, I did it just cause I felt like it.” He knew he had given the worst answer in the universe, but he didn’t really care.
She lifted her head and dramatically flopped back in her chair. “I can’t do this anymore,” she moaned.
Sorry that this story took a long hiatus. Finals and a migraine kept me from updating, but now that I'm on summer break we should be back on track. To make up for it I give you a long chapter!
“Look, I’m sorry that we didn’t tell you where we were going, but I didn’t think Claire’s plan was stupid,” Jack defended, rubbing where Dean had hit him. “The deaths wouldn’t have stopped unless the demon was dead. Also, it’s smarter to attack her before we killed her hellhound. If we waited until after she would have been on to us and left.”
“Based on past experience, when Sam and Dean tell people they’re in danger, it usually leads to  a lot of follow up questions.” Cas shrugged.
“It’s fine,” Claire kinda felt bad for the big lug. He clearly had a lot to get off his chest. She had no doubt that it was a build up from being stuck in a house full of people that’ve been mopey and quiet for the past week. Claire must be the first person actually willing to talk to him in a while. “There’s a lot more action here than Jody’s. Probably because you guys spend more time together. Although, I’m starting to see that it’s probably for the best that we don’t.”
“Yeah we probably should…” Castiel said absentmindedly. Neither of them made to get off the couch yet. “Can you tell me more about him?”
“I can’t explain it. I just know they won’t.” Jack said as vaguely as he could. “Either way the risk is lower if it’s me.” He had to remember to say “won’t” instead of “can’t”, he didn’t want to tip Claire off in any way. Worst case scenario would be her thinking that he was somehow working with the demon.
“Where did you hear this?” Patience asked.
“You mean you want me to babysit the rookie?” She felt a little guilty targeting the new guy, but that’s how she interpreted Sam’s words. They needed someone to stay with Jack, while they went out and did all the cool stuff. It was the only explanation, since she had been able to force herself on to the crime scene before.
“You were at a table with your friends, it was obvious that you weren’t looking for company.”
Accepting his defeat he headed for the door, but Sam stopped him, “Jack, can I talk to you for a minute?” He nodded, grateful for any excuse to waste more time. “Are you okay? You seem a little off.”
Jack lifted his head and took a glance towards Claire, thankfully the blonde was still scrolling through her phone. He adjusted the glasses that had slid down the bridge of the nose and checked his surroundings one last time for any sign of the hellhound. Satisfied, he looked back down at the gray rock and concentrated all of his focus onto it. He subtly lifted his index finger towards the pebble. He took a deep breath and pushed a small amount of energy out of the tip of his finger at the rock. He slowly began to drag his finger towards him. He smiled when the rock followed his finger’s movement. He made the rock slide closer and closer until it tapped his shoe. Then he moved his finger in the opposite direction, making the rock follow along. He practiced rolling the rock back and forth, making it gain momentum with every flick of his fingers.
Dean and Cas try the summoning spell with disappointing results. Dean begins to think that maybe life in the dream world isn't too bad.
“Sam, that’s enough.” Castiel repeated again, but with no bite to it this time. Sam looking at him with raised eyebrows. “Excuse me Sam and Mary, but if you don’t mind I would like to talk to my husband alone please.” Cas said politely. Sam’s eyes finally softened up a bit as he gave his friend a comforting pat on the shoulder.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Dean corrected, choosing to ignore Cas’ insult. “I just meant that witches are tricky. And sometimes you and Jack can be a little... “ He trailed off trying to come up with a word that wouldn’t be insulting.
“What the hell are you talking about Dean? Of course this is real and you for real screwed up and got plowed by a car.” Sam said with a hint of attitude, clearly he thought Dean was crazy.
Jack loudly started to cough into the crook of his elbow. He tried to make it sound as realistic as he could without actually gagging. He coughed until “Cindy” walked away with a grossed out expression.
“They probably never do laundry. I mean, when would they have the time?” Patience added.
Jack quickly shook his head, “I have no idea.”
“Exactly,” Sam smiled sadly. “I’m sure we’ll be fine. Just give it a couple more days. Anyways, I’ll get back to my filing. Jack’s room is two doors down on the left hand side. Good luck.” He gave her an awkward pat and a strained smile before leaving her.
“Kelly was my best friend in college, but she died during labor. Right before she passed, she asked if I could raise her baby. She had already named him Jack, but she asked the doctors to put Winchester as his last name.
“Fine Cas! I’ll admit it! I
“Hey!” Jack and Cas said simultaneously.
“Fine. Since you’re such a Daddy’s boy, then feel free to stay here and not do shit. I have a demon to catch,” she swiftly turned, her blonde hair flipping with her movement. Jack stood there for a second, contemplating his next move. With a sigh he did a slight jog to catch up with the girl.
“You should have seen it.” Sam joined in with a teasing grin. “A four year old Jack, running around in diapers. It was cute.”
“No, Dean it’s only been a day. Michael has manipulated your memories as a way to keep you here.” Cas and Sam had matching expressions of empathy and Dean hated it. He started shaking his head in disbelief.
Jack quickly nodded dragging his foot through the spray painted line, ignoring Claire who was wildly shaking her head. As promised, the moment the line was broken, he heard Claire gasping for air. The demon moved out of the trap and stood directly in front of Jack. “I’m disappointed Jack,” she said sadly, “turns out you’re just as boring as everyone says-” Before she could finish her sentence, Claire hurled the angel blade through the air in the direction of the demon. The red-eyed demon swiftly caught the blade inches from her heart. “God, I hate children,” she rolled her eyes and sent the angel blade flying back towards Claire.
“Why? So, the grown ups can talk?” she scoffed.
Halfway through their make out session Dean made the mistake of opening his eyes for half a second. He swore he saw Cas standing behind the couch. As in the real Castiel. He was wearing the same old suit and trenchcoat and his face showed a look of stoic confusion that only angel Cas could. That made Dean pull back from the kiss quickly, only for the apparition of Cas to disappear.
“Yeah no kidding,” Claire snapped. “Besides the books, all that’s here are these dumb poems.”
“Fine, but that doesn’t give him a right to make a pass at you,” Dean sounded like he was getting increasingly annoyed by this conversation.
Jack helped Sam and Cas load all of their stuff back into the trunk of the Impala while Dean left them to check out. Once he came back they hopped in the car to start their journey home.
“You know you don’t have to lie. I promise we won’t tell anyone.”
After that incident she tried just accepting that she would never get a hold of him and move on. Except Claire was a girl of action, which meant that doing nothing only made her guilty lump feel worse. She had hoped that going on a hunt and killing something would be enough to make it go away. But by the time the hunt was over and she was wiping the vampire blood from her machete, she found that the feeling was still there.
“Because -” Dean started hesitantly, but was soon interrupted.
“This isn’t happening… This isn’t happening… This isn’t happening.” He repeated over and over. “This can’t be happening… It isn’t real… This is all just a dream… A real fucked up dream.” Everyone one was staring at him now and he didn’t care.
“I wish I got to meet Crowley.” Jack voiced the first thing that came to his mind. The Winchesters and Castiel always spoke highly of the demon, but he had died on the day Jack was born. Rowena was his mother, and Jack liked the witch, so he assumed he would have liked Crowley as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m okay, considering everything. Michael is still banging on the closet door, which is annoying, but at least it’s a reminder that he’s still trapped.” It was the worst headache he’s ever had, but as long as he kept his mind occupied the banging toned down to an incessant tapping.
“Okay…” Dean said cautiously. He figured he was going to have to say yes to whatever Cas thought of. It wasn’t like he could tell him the truth. But, he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t intrigued.
I don’t know what that is.
“W-want?” he flinched.
Somehow he managed to fall asleep, but it wasn’t a peaceful slumber. Weird images flashed through his mind. He saw a spear lying in two broken pieces on the ground. He saw snapping fingers. He saw Sam, Cas, and Jack staring at someone in shock. Then he saw himself wearing a suit that he would never pick for himself. The weirdest part was even though it was his face, it looked like it belong to someone else.
“What?” Dean asked, not sure if he understood what the angel was saying.
“Whatever dude, go ahead and fuck whoever you want! I couldn’t care less!” Dean long abandoned trying to talk quietly and at this point was just trying not to yell.
“I just mean, what’s up with you living with Sam and Dean?” Claire clarified.
“Dude, I totally could have stayed in the car.” He whispered angrily.
“Yeah and how much did you make?” the brunette teased.
“Are you okay?” the angel asked, putting a comforting hand on his arm.
Jack looked out the window at the little neighborhood in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He was feeling eager to get out of the car and properly stretch his legs, but he was less eager about what lay inside.
“We weren’t arguing Jack, we were just talking,” Castiel lied.
“Yeah yeah. We’re leaving anyway.” Dean yelled back.
“What makes you
“So what did he say when he woke up?” Sam interrogated.
“Don’t worry,” her voice softened. “As long as you’re not foaming at the mouth or unwillingly spilling all of your darkest secrets, then I am sure it’s only a minor spell. Angela is not exactly an advanced witch, it should wear off in three hours,” she promised. Dean and Cas seemed to relax slightly, but they still looked tense.
“Uhh. I hate to break up your guys’ moment, but the doctor’s going to come in and check Dean over so he can clear him to go home.” Sam told them.
The rest of the dinner was pretty uneventful, it mainly consisted of Jody and the Winchester’s catching up. Claire had tried to talk about the case a few times, but it usually ended with someone shrugging her off and her continuing to lazily play with her food. Soon enough they were leaving to go check into a motel room. Jack thanked Jody for dinner and she promised him that she would give them plenty of leftovers once the case was finished. They left after Dean turned to Claire and promised that tomorrow they would work on the case.
Alex and Patience reacted to Jack’s secret surprisingly well. Claire made her explanation short and direct. “Don’t worry guys, Jack is cool. The reason he had glowing eyes in Patience’s vision is because he is a nephilim, or half human half angel; and the reason he didn’t tell us is because Dean is a dumbass who thought we’d react as if our lives weren’t just as fucked up. Anyways, he has sick angel powers and he was pretty much raised by the Winchesters. Which means he doesn’t know much outside of Dean’s crappy music and 80s movies. So it’s our job to teach him how to be a kid from this century.”
"Get on your hands and knees." He growls, grinning wolfishly and i gulp before obliging his request, turning my back on his and spreading my legs, exposing myself to him. I felt so out of control like this and it was exciting but dangerous at the same time because i didn't know what he was going to do. He may have turned good side but that didn't stop the demon streak running through my even-though-we-are-not-married husband. Suddenly i feel lips pressed into my hole and i feel a tounge teasing it, flicking this way at that. I groan deep in my throat and drop my head down into the mattress, clutching onto the bedsheets tightly. Suddenly the mouth was gone and something else pressed against me. I rocked back against him making him moan but tap my ass lightly, telling me not to move.
"Nothing." I say a bit too quickly and he grins wickedly. He jumps up out of his seat but I'm ready for him and quickly knock him back down. He skips around me quickly but in too slow to catch him and is quickly running to the other side of the room with the parchment that I was writing on not moments ago. "Give it back."
“Just wait until she’s a teenager.” Castiel grinned and I laugh loudly and shake my head.
"Lucifer." I say, turning back to her coolly and she gulps and nods her head. "The Demon God." She nods her head again.
"Where abouts in the woods? No where close to the border i hope!" I shake my head drastically and look at him with wide eyes.
Once people started knowing about Valentina the more assassins were sent to the castle to kill her. All of them so far got caught straight away and sentenced to death but I knew it was only a matter of time before one actually got into my chambers and tried killing her. That time was coming close, I could almost feel it.
An alarm goes off on Cas' phone. He takes it out of his pocket and turns it off, opening up the messenger bag on the booth next to him and digging for something. A moment later, he sets a bottle on the table in front of Dean with a little emphatic rattle.
“What?” Dean stared at his mom, this woman who was maybe the most complex relationship of his life. “Are you serious?”
"What?"
"You don't get to make our choices for us either, Dean."
“Thank you,” he says. “You are the most beautiful being I have ever known.”
“Jesus, fuck,” Dean said, audible this time. “Cas...”
Castiel's true form is made of electromagnetic radiation. He has spent the majority of his life, if you really want to add it all up and average the whole thing out, as a wavelength of celestial intent.
That thought is too pathetic for Dean to sit with, so he turns the phone off and gets up. He pads out of his room, down the hall and up to the kitchen, helping himself to a beer. The leftovers of the chicken parmesan he'd made them for dinner are sitting in neat Tupperware in a full fridge and just standing there looking at it makes him feel a little weepy.
Dean looks at him strangely. And then his face breaks into a grin. It's tired and only half-there, but it's real. The first real smile Dean's given him since they've been inside his head. It makes Cas' heart do funny human things, like it always does.
“I don’t know, man.” Dean shuts his eyes, just for a moment. “I went through it and then the door like, spat me back out into that room and I felt like, you know, it wasn’t great, but I see that shit all the time. I don’t need a magical “worst of” recap to tell me what I already know about Hell. I told you, I’m coping.”
The dynamic when they were kids, though… Sam hasn't found a way to forgive John for that. He can't forgive their father for how he treated Dean, and Sam sometimes thinks he's holding onto the anger around that for both of them. Even now, when Dean has worked through some of his issues with John, when he's had time and distance to understand how messed up their relationship was, he still clings to some scrap of loyalty, still tries to protect Sam from a tarnished view of their dad.
"You never even looked up. I saw you, so focused on what was before you, locked in your own worst nightmare. I know you told Sam once that you liked it. And I know you were telling him the truth. But I also know that after a life spent saving people, a life of sacrifice, that to be put in a position to hurt other humans was a personal Hell like nothing else."
do anything stupid while I’m gone.”
Purgatory drops away and now it's the mark, past Dean pale and
see his mountain of a man brother as the little gap-toothed kid with scraped knees and innocent smile, holding Dean's hand. Dean's responsibility, his reason for being.
“I’m listening! Dia-whatever earth and kibble. Got it. We can go in the morning. Sam’s coming up tomorrow afternoon to help set up new fence posts.”
"You bullshitting me to make me go home with you?"
Dean stares at his brother in horror. "And you
"Hey kiddo," Dean says, kicking the door shut behind him. Now-Dean and Cas crowd in after him.
Before all of that, Cas had died.
Dean has lost everyone.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shakes his head. “Of course it is, Sammi. Of course it is.”
Cas seems startled to have been asked. “I’m not… Maybe Colorado? He talks about the mountains there sometimes.”

“So you’ve spent the last few years having your whole view of life rewritten and feeling as if someone else were in charge of it.”
The lies weren't enough, but the truth isn't enough either.
There’s nothing to do in their enclosed rectangle of hot water and warm skin, lather and lemongrass-scented steam but give in to the feeling in the pit of Dean’s stomach. He doesn’t cry or shake or break down, not really, but he puts his wet hands on top of Cas arms wrapped around his waist and leans back into the sturdy frame of him.
Adam is long dead in this time, and Dean isn't going to get back to his own timeline, and probably Adam wouldn't have wanted anything to do with him anyway. Probably resented John for leaving him too.
There’s no other way to describe it - his whole body, the glow and the image of him, flickers like a static picture on television. Dean steps back, one hand on Cas’ shoulder.
"Hey, Sammy, go out and change the plates, would you? Dad and I will be right out."
Dean had told himself he wasn’t going to do any of this - sleep with Cas or cry or any of it. Ain’t that how it always goes?
"He did."
The thing is, if there’s anything the narrative would never have allowed, it’s this. It’s Dean turning his need to help people into something healing. It’s embracing that part of him that he’s always felt a certain amount of shame over, that part of him that just wants to take care of people. It’s ignoring the way he was brought up to think about nursing as a profession, as if any caring profession was by nature somehow feminine. It’s daring to think that he could make something of himself, that he could go to college, that he could find purpose outside of hunting.
Every day for the next ten years, Dean was tortured - carved and sliced and torn apart until he was nothing, nothing but a raw throat and a pair of eyeballs, until he was just scraps of flesh lying on the floor. When he’d been put together into something like his old shape again, Alastair would come, and when Dean told him no, Alastair would take him apart in other ways.
Fourteen-year-old Dean momentarily adjusts the rear view mirror, taking in his split lip and the red mark across his cheek that is going to fade into a bruise by that afternoon. He runs his tongue over the drop of blood on his bottom lip. The taste of iron is familiar, par for the course.
If he thinks too long about it, it's going to take him all day, so Dean randomly selects the Fairlane. When he slides in, it smells incredible, like petrol and leather and history.
When they got back to the bunker, it was late afternoon and Dean dumped the bags from their grocery run onto the kitchen counter.
"What?" Jack says, mouth slightly open. The thrum of power coming from him as his adrenaline spikes makes everyone in the room wince.
“Hey.” Sam flicks him on the forearm, but doesn’t take his arm away. “I believe in doing good, okay? And I believe in what Jack said to us. That his love would be out there in the universe. I know that sounds like hippy shit to you, but I believe in love, man.”
"Like you're about to cry if i say no." He looks back up at me and shakes his head. "I can't Castiel. I have a kingdom and a dau-"
"Not Sam, Cas! I mean-"
"I beg your pardon?" I ask incredously and she laughs again.
“No Dean, we couldn’t. I have a wife and, I love her very much. You have Anna whom is kind to you and I’m an angel Dean and you’re…”
“Well?” I ask him. “Sam has a point, when were you planning on telling up about our mother being an angel?”
Sam and Gabriel met up from time to time still and discussed old politics and spoke about how the start of the world came about however this was not very often, but in fact every hundred years or so.
"What did he mean by 'where our hearts truly lie,' Father?" I asked him and he suddenly flicks his gaze to me, fury written across his face.
“Marry her instead.” Gabriel says quickly after composing himself and just before Leliel walks back into the castle. She turns around and looks at Castiel before winking and walking back inside. Castiel turns to Gabriel and nods his head.
"Alright! Well, that's a good thing right? That your were having sex with The king of Angels because that means that you can get married and there will be no more war because you're next in line to be King of the demons. Crowley has already assigned you as his heir." Sam said happily and my brain almost imploded.
“Oh stop it you.” She giggled and I chuckled back before placing a kiss on her cheek.
"No Dean, she can't. Plus don't you have a meeting soon?" He asks me and I grimace at him slightly.
"I should of known. Of course a demon wouldn't help one of us, of course a demon wouldn't know right from wrong even in his own court. You do realise there are rules against sleeping with another mans slave right?" He asks and I shrug. "Your father hasn't actually proclaimed Castiel as his slave yet, so you just need to do it first and then he can't touch him!"
"I was wondering if I could ask you a favour?" I say cautiously, taking baby girl out of Amelia's hands and looking at her seriously. She nods and perks an eyebrow up curiously. "I was wondering, if anybody asks that you say you found her at the doorstep of the angel courtyard while you were doing your daily run?"
“What are you doing here?” I ask him gently and he sat up slightly to get a better look at me.
"You okay?" I asked him so it would take his mind of it for a moment. His eyes shot open and he looked at me before nodding his head. "I told you it hurt."
I met Anael at the bottom of the castle stairs. I was standing outside a black horse and carriage when I looked up to find her walking down the stone steps towards me looking more beautiful then I had ever seen her before. She was wearing a red and gold dress that pushed up her bosom fantastically and flowed out at the hips. Her hair was in braids down her back and she had a gold circlet on her head that made her look so regal. She would make a fantastic Queen.
"Perhaps."
"GABRIEL PLEASE! NO, DON'T LEAVE ME!" My brother screamed at the golden eyed angel who had ripped off his own choker.
“Thank you my highness.” She says elegantly, fluttering her eyelashes slightly. I smile at her and pour her some wine into a goblet.
“Hm…” I look at her closely but she is avoiding my gaze. This makes me curious and I want to carry on questioning her but I don’t want her to be offended by my questions so I instead let the matter go. We finish our drinks and I lead her outside my chambers, before kissing her hand.
We walk into my chambers where an almost full bath is waiting for me in the middle of the room. Castiel walks over to the fireplace where the last bit of water is still boiling and takes it off the fire to throw it into the tub. He then drops the bucket and smiles at me.
"Nothing." He says, grinning slightly.
“I was here to find Gabriel.” He said stubbornly, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Did I?” I cough awkwardly and rub the back of my neck. “I suppose I was just thinking out loud.”
I was riding through the woods that hid the border from the demon kingdom into the angel kingdom. Not many angels and demons came this way because there was always some sort of angel or demon guard on the borderline looking for trouble. However I had my sword with me so I knew I could kill any demon that came my way and any angel wouldn’t attack me anyway. Before crossing the border I get off my horse and go towards a lake that was absolutely stunning. There were all kinds of flowers growing around it and blossom petals covered the water. Then, out of the water came a figure and my eyes went wide in shock.
"Tell me who you are Luce. Tell me you are not the one my fathers warned me about." My eyes turn sad and my sneers changes into a small frown as i look away from her.
"Samuel..."
“Dada, can I go and explore?” Valentina asked me but I shake my head.
“No, you can’t keep it because your advisors and your men will all expect you to march on us. Especially since now you know where we are.” He says to me seriously and I scowl slightly before looking back at my stroppy looking brother and the jester who was speaking to him softly.
"Sire, I hate to say this but your daughter may be in real danger. Especially if the wrong people find out about her. They will send assassins on to kill her."
"God I've missed you." He grumbles out before smashing his lips back on mine. I smile triumphantly as I grip the back of his hair tightly and tug at it roughly as a sign of my persistence. His hands travel from my waist and to my ass where he takes one cheek in each hand and squeezes it tightly.
"Oh." She says, her reaction not what i had planned it on being. I look down at the stone and frown.
"How do I look?" He asks me, winking.
"Valentina." She tells me and i smile lightly.
“Daddy!” The little girl shouted and Dean stiffened, tears suddenly pouring out of his eyes as his little girl cried his name. The girl came running towards them and for a moment, just a moment Castiel thought that she was actually coming towards them and was just going to jump on Dean and hug him tightly. However, not all things could be happy that day. The girl ran straight past the two men and towards a man and a woman stood side by side together. The little girl ran up to her dad and jumped on him like Valentina used to do to Dean oh so long ago.
"I can't do it now otherwise father will know that-"
“Yes, I have actually.” Gabriel snorts again and the woman raises and eyebrow and laughs.
“I should go; I guess I will see you tomorrow for the big day.” I smile and nod at her before she comes over and gives me a quick kiss on the lips.
"He is God."
"Thank Lucifer, but why?" He asks and i take a glance at the manor.
"Okay." She says after a minute or two of silence and suddenly i feel better, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.
“How can you be sure?” The taller one asked, his hair was dark and his eyes were a greyish blue colour.
"I haven't opened them yet. We always wait until after dinner to open the presents." She says and i grimace.
“It’s none of your business.” I snap and the corners of his mouth tips up.
"You know because you love me and all that..." She says slowly, looking down at her hands.
"Where is she now?"
“Don’t worry baby girl, he will be okay. He’s just used a lot of his energy on building this beautiful house for us.” She sniffs and nods her head so I pick her up and carry her out of the room, looking back on Cas before closing the door quietly behind me and carrying her downstairs. “Valentina, I need to tell you something okay? So I want you to listen carefully and ask me any questions after I am done.” She nods her head and sits on one of the dining room chairs, waiting patiently for me to stair. I sit down beside her and take her hand in mine before looking into her big blue eyes.
"I have to say, I liked the view when I walked in." He said calmly, ignoring my verbal attack at him. He started walking towards me and around me. I blushed deeply at his comment and coughed awkwardly before looking down at my feet. "It was a sight for sore eyes."
I woke up the next morning in a cold sweat, my breathing was haggard and my mouth was as dry as dead bone. I got up quickly and got changed even quicker before I sprinted down the halls towards the great hall where Gabriel was talking to some officials. When I strode into the hall they all bowed low and I nodded my head in respect at them. I turn to Gabriel with a wild look in my eyes and he looks at me strangely before dismissing the officials from our presence.
“Castiel?” My wife says tiredly, waking up from her slumber and sitting up slightly. I take my hands away from her belly and smile at her.
"As good as she'll ever be. Eating, playing, sleeping and pooping." I laugh at her comment before planting a kiss on my daughters head.
“No, but we will find one.” He whispers and I nod in response.
"Don't ever do that to me again!" She scolded and I let a smile slip onto my face.
"Yes." He replies back simply and smiles. "I just have a lot on my mind."
“DADA NO!”
“Don’t tell me what to do Castiel; I’m completely capable of walking up a few stairs.” I say breathlessly but was thankful that I now got too sit down. I took of my shoes and put my feet up on his desk, rubbing my swollen feet and wincing at my blisters. I looked over at him and I could tell that he was about to move to massage them but he stayed still instead, obviously knowing that that probably wasn’t the best idea in the current situation. He stood there awkwardly, waiting for me to speak as I just stared up at him from where I sat. I could almost feel my heart breaking again but I had to confront him.
“It’s true.” He says quietly, leaning against the wall with his shoulders slumped forwards and his head down in shame. “I don’t know why and I don’t know how but I do love him. I am so sorry.” He put his face in his hands and started crying silently. My lip trembled as I hated seeing him like this so I got up and walked over to him, putting my arms around him and hugging him tightly as a fresh flow of my own tears came pouring out of my face. I buried my head in his chest as he put his own arms around me and we stood there for a good couple of minutes before I pulled away again and turned to face the balcony doors.
“He’s a strange one, I have to admit that.” Anna agreed as we storm down the halls. “This is fun; we don’t spend that much time together anymore.”
"Not on your own."
"You heard." I say seriously and she gasps and puts a hand to her mouth.
"Ew, you're an old man." She snorts and i scowl at her.
“I don’t know Leliel.” He chokes out before turning his back on my but not moving out of the room. I knew exactly why he didn’t love me anywhere but I didn’t know if I had the guts to just tell him straight but I was just too exhausted tonight. The baby was kicking and I found it hard to sleep.
“SHUT IT CASTIEL!” She screams at me and I close my mouth to let her speak. “I will not let you ride off into battle alone, let me go to Anael and we can organise the woman to fight alongside you. I have a bad feeling about this Castiel; I have a bad feeling about you marching off like this. You could get ambushed and this might be a trap. Please!”
"I think you need angels more then you say you do. Take my older brother for example... Castiel." I gulp and my eyes flicker slightly as he grins at me coolly, leaning on the door which entered into my fathers private quarters.
"You're holding him all wrong." She tells me and I scowl at her.
"Hey you." Said a voice I recognised too clearly. I looked behind me and Anna was stood there looking as beautiful as ever.
"Yes, but i'm very thankful that he did. Without him doing that i would have been used by many demons in that way." She sighs and rubs her eyes tiredly but nods.
"Why the hell do demons tell their children about that stuff?" I ask incredously and he laughs.
The day came and went and it was finally night-time. Samuel, Sam, had come up to me on several occasions asking if he could come to the party but I declined all 20 times. I put on my best clothing, a green velvet tunic and waistcoat with matching leggings and high black boots. I placed my crown on top of my head and placed my black fur cloak around my shoulders, tying it up with a gold band. I looked in the large mirror that used to be my mums and straightened my outfit out. Normally I would have an angel dressing me but they were all too busy greeting people and making food for the ball tonight. I walked out of my room and down the long corridors and stairs towards the great hall. It had changed so much from when I had last been in and I couldn’t help but approve of the work the angels put in to make it look so elegant and rich.
Are you, are you, coming to the tree.
"VALENTINA!!?" I hear a frantic shout coming from my house and stand up quickly, brushing myself down.
"Yes please." I say and she raises and eyebrow at my politeness before walking slowly over and handing Sam her baby before taking mine, I mean uh... the one that I found away from me. She gets out her breast and I turn away out of politeness, slapping Sam's head as he stares. "Don't stare Sammy."
"I want to know who killed my family, angelis." I say to my horse, or more to myself. "I need to find them, i need to kill them. What should i do?" I straightned up and coughed slightly before shaking my head. "Look at me, i'm going crazy. Speaking to a horse? What next, hugging a troll?"
“You seriously did not just call me that.” He groans out without opening his eyes.
"I-i'm sorry." She whispers and blushes before looking away. I look at her in disbelief, my eyes still wide as they were before, my lips parted open slightly. She glanced at my face quickly and blushed a deeper shade of red before getting up and running away as quick as possible, leaving me sat on the grass, looking after her running away, back into the woods and to her secluded, safe little home with her demon and angel fathers.
“That’s because you’re only a silly little demon and can’t see the true beauty of things.” I comment and he gives me a shove.
“This one is for you, it’s the best one.” Dada says and I smile at him gratefully.
"Er, what?" I say, tilting my head to the side.
“I’m looking at the view.” I say sarcastically even though that is exactly what I was doing.
"Dean, you forget that I've met your father."
"Can I help you?" The king said, perking an eyebrow at me.
He was lying.
"People will talk. We must go somewhere more private." She nods and beckons me to follow her so I do. We scurry along the halls and up flights upon flights of stairs until finally we are at the top of some sort of tower, however we don't stop there. She reaches up and opens a latch that leads onto the rooftop of the tower and climbs through it, me following closely behind. When we are up there she turns to look at me. She bows low and respectfully. Not a curtsy like she is used to doing with Dean but kneels down on one knee and lowers her head before saying;
“I told you not to call me that.” I growl lowly in my throat but he just shrugs.
"Fine, but i'm taking extra precautions." He nods in agreement and we both slide out of bed and get dressed quickly as the cold air brushed against out naked skin. I begin to walk out of the door but Dean grabs my arm and turns me back around. I frown at him again but he is just smiling down at me with a twinkle in his eye. "What?"
“Oh that must be so hard for you, getting waited on hand and foot, getting everything handed to you on a silver platter, getting bowed to in the corridors and having people basically worship you. I feel so bad for you.”
“Who’s this?” The shorter one with blonde hair asked, looking me up and down.
"Half a demon." I correct and she looks at me in question.
"Because you made me be! All this time you have been making me fall in love with you, just so you can kill me when the times right! Don't think i don't know!" I am rooted speechless by her truthful words and it hurt like a thousand blunt angel blades sticking into my chest.
"Yes Cas?" His smile widens as i take a deep breath.
“Cas…?” I say and he mumbles out a reply. “Cas!”
"Castiel!" I heard my brother call and come skipping into the room.
"Is that a good thing?" Michael looks confused at my smirking face.
"Which is?"
I got woken up during the night by loud screams coming from the cot. I groan and roll out of bed, crawling over to the screaming crib and bending over it to see baby girl crying her little eyes out. I glare at her slightly as there is a knock at my door.
"H-he..." I start but the words get stuck in my throat. I hold onto Dean's hand tightly and keep an arm wrapped around Valentina who is cowering behind me.
"Alright." I agree and he smiles again and nods before walking out of his chambers altogether. My heart was fluttering as I managed to get myself out of the bath and dry off, putting on one of deans robes to do so. I start emptying the bath water with a bucket and throwing it out of the window but the whole time I was doing this my mind was in how Dean let me take a bath. I was confused to say the least as it was uncalled for, it was unheard of and it was so un-demon like. It's strange that he and his brother are nothing like their father and I pondered about their mother, what she must have been like for her sons to turn out the way that they have. So trusting and forgiving of angels. I sat on his bed and stared into space, wondering about the strange demon and his uncommon ways. Nowadays my mind was constantly on him and I wanted to believe that this was some demonic trick that he was playing on me to make me feel this way towards him but I knew that it wasn't the case, I knew that it wasn't magic or power that was making me think of him in this way but rather my own feelings. I had grown fond of the young demon, more than fond for that matter and it made me think that perhaps he thought of me in this way also. I certainly hoped so even though the possibility of us ever actually being together was slim to none. An angel can dream though, even if this angel was the most powerful of its kind.
Cas (POV) 2 years later
Dean remembered him so clearly in his mind, his dark chocolate, almost black hair. His beautiful cyan eyes, his puffy red lips and his rugged, angular facial features. He remembered his sex hair in the mornings and the way he used to be so moody. He remembered he used to have those days where he never wanted to get out of bed, either wanting to keep sleeping or… do other things. He remembered how adorably angry he would get when Dean laughed while in the midst of an argument and him crossing his arms and pouting when Dean just hugged him while he was trying to scream and shout with him
“I have been looking for her for 7 years.” He says, his voice cracking slightly and I nod my head in understanding. “You have no idea what it is like to lose your own daughter and think she is dead for 7 years, I was so angry and upset.” He looks back up at me and shakes his head.
“You crazy little girl!” I say, standing up and picking up as I did so, swinging her around so she screamed and laughed. I smiled like crazy at her laugh and pecked her nose. “Time for bed.”
“How do you know, you seen it?” She asks, giving him a crooked smile.
"Because I've got things to do Cas, besides a little someone will be missing me." He smiles fondly and I snort
“They call me the trickster. My powers are meant to have drained by now but I still got a bit of juice left in me to play a few tricks.” He winks at me and I grin back at him.
The point, really, was that they didn’t talk about it. Dean had let Cas repeat the experience a few times, and each time Dean had become overwhelmed at some point and cried. It was always just a little too much, Cas pushing him just a little too far, just trying to make Dean see that he was desired and loved. It was an exquisite kind of torture for Dean, and yet he allowed it, as confusing of a headspace as it seemed to put him in.
Sam shakes his head. “Look, I love Cas like a brother. I’m devastated that he’s gone. And I know that he loved us all like family. But, it’s not - it wasn’t… Ten thousand years of faith, Dean, and he gave that up for you. Not me, not Bobby, just you. Because he believed in you.”
If Dean had just listened in the first place… but no, he had to go charging into that sanctuary and tip the angelic tripwire, and now here they are with Dean's consciousness trapped in some hell dimension while his body slowly loses its life-force.
to be held by him.
Not what happened with Jack and Mary, although that hadn't helped. That period of blame and bitterness still stings, but Dean cares too much not to forgive, eventually.
Dean is absolutely lost.
Dean pulls back, his hand slipping from the back of Cas' neck.
As if fourteen-year-old Dean hasn't killed all sorts of monsters single-handed, hasn't proven himself in a fight over and over again. As if fourteen-year-old Dean isn't making nearly every damn sacrifice in the books for his family at this point. The things he's done, the things he's seen…
“I’m setting you up with an encrypted drive, because other Dean is a mess and never remembers to have me look at his computer whenever he gets a new one. At least Sam can handle a walk-through on how to set up even the most basic of security measures, but gods forbid Dean even has to look at code.” Charlie’s fingers stop flying across the keys, and then she’s opening up a browser tab and saying “Okay, now a lot has happened in the last fifteen years, buddy boy, so keep up.”
Instead, Dean drove back to Denver and went to a bar. He called Sam first, checked in, told him he might not be back that night.
Crowley glances over younger Dean and sniffs. “I think you’re being a tad ungrateful,” he says to Dean. “You got yourself into a mess, I provided you with a ticket out. That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?”
Chapter title from
“I know,” he says quietly. “I know. I…”
Younger Dean drops back with a bit of a grin on his face, even though his breathing is labored.
Cas smiles a little. "You've forgiven me for worse."
John's checking the messages on one of his burner phones. He doesn't look up.
In spite of himself, Dean feels a little stab of empathy for older Dean. He feels that way too, a lot of the time.
Dean's heart breaks. He knows that's not the point of this memory, knows what's coming, but Sammy is laying in the middle of the twin-mattress, wrapped up in a blanket like a baby burrito, with a motel pillow propped on other side of his tiny body to keep him from rolling too far in his sleep.
The waitress snorts. "If you three are really auditors, I'll eat my apron," she says. "What can I get for you? The usual?"
I'm still… I know I'm going to be looking out over my shoulder for Chuck for a long time. Maybe forever. But if this is really it, then… this is the light at the end of the tunnel and I think maybe it's our chance to try, you know?"
"Anything else for you, loves?" The waitress asks.
The door bursts into flames, and when Dean blinks the spots out of his eyes, the number two has been replaced with the same charred X.
Older Dean shoots him a glare. "You're not coming," he says.
Sam is smiling at him, a little sadly, maybe, but like he's glad to be with Dean too. It's all too fucking weird.
“What do you mean ‘
"You make sure Dorothy invites me to your first match or whatever, yeah?"
It’s actually… Well, it’s actually incredibly sweet.
Dean tips his head back against the hard rock and laughs. When he's done chuckling he leans over and kisses Cas on his slightly flushed cheek. "You're an adorable nerd."
"If he hasn't told you, maybe you're just reading it wrong," Dean says stubbornly. Truth be told, he wouldn't bet on that. Not after seeing the way older Dean rushed to catch Cas, the way their hands had lingered over each other in just those small moments. The way Cas had looked at both Deans so intensely.
"Dean," Cas says again. He waits, hovering near Dean's bed in the dark. Dean has hunched in on himself, knees drawn up to his chest.
"Dean," Sam says again. It's quiet this time. "We've got to talk about it, man. We've got to."
They go back to the hotel where Sam very intentionally booked rooms that are not next to each other (“I thank god every night for the bunker’s thick walls, and I do not deserve to have to listen to Cas moan your name while we’re on vacation,” Sam said when he handed Dean the keycards). They’re supposed to be cleaning up, but Dean runs his fingers through Cas’ hair where the saltwater has dried and left it in disarrayed clumps, and that somehow leads to them fucking there on the hotel floor. Cas’ skin tastes like brine under Dean’s tongue and it makes that unfamiliar feeling swell up again in his stomach.
Four-year-old Dean is bouncing the blue ball off the wall across from him, in the space between the two beds. A deputy at the police station had handed Dean the ball while they were waiting, while dad was back in a room with the deputy. Dean could hear his father crying from down the hall. He'd held his brother tight in his arms and shushed him, the way he'd seen mom do a hundred times.
“Um,” Dean said, not entirely sure he was ever going to get out a full word again. Levi just smiled at him and took his hand. And Dean had liked that too.
This wasn't exactly true, and Cas was pretty sure they both knew it, but he didn't argue.
"No, Cas, that's not…" Dean lowered his face to Cas' shoulder and banged his head lightly against it. "Nevermind. Got it. I'm glad it's good for you too. Uh. Sure. Sure? You can do the body thing, if you wanna."
Dean survives by not thinking about this shit. He knows he drinks too much and puts himself in danger and sometimes hurts the people he loves, but he's kept himself alive by a fucking thread at times by not marinating in his own worst memories. Maybe they're always there, tension beneath the surface, levee waiting to break, but Dean
Mind the tags. I will leave it up to you again if you want to check the (spoilery) Content Warnings in the end notes, but, uh, we're going there.
All in all, it’s not easy work, but that’s part of what Dean likes about it.
Chapter Content Warnings: internalized homophobia/biphobia, briefly referenced past sex work, self-hatred
"You're not going to be able to 'conquer' the seventh door if its contents isn't of your own making. So for… for my feelings to have affected…"
“Just do it before those lungs burst an eardrum, Jesus.”
Dean can’t meet his therapist’s eyes as he talks about it.
Dean drops the wires and takes the fork out of his mouth, looking up at Sam with his eyes wide and slightly panicky. When Sam catches his eye, Dean tries to jerk his head in a subtle shake, to tell him
… It has its appeal.
But Dean woke up a month ago and realized he wasn't getting his dead best friend back this time, and that meant that if this time was really sticking, if this was really it, then those were really Cas' last Last Words. And that had to mean something. Dean had to let it mean something.
Younger Dean’s fists are clenched and he looks about two seconds from socking Crowley in the face.
He wonders if Cas and younger Dean are still up talking. He wonders if his younger self is already in love with Cas, if what took post-Hell Dean four years to even begin to admit to himself could have been something uncomplicated and natural.
“Hello,” Dean murmurs, kissing beneath Cas’ ear. He wraps his arms around Cas and just holds him again. Every moment like this puts distance between his last living memory of Cas, of the confusion and guilt and grief that had poured over his soul like sacrament. His living memories are never gone, including the pain of them, but Dean thinks he understands what Heaven is doing in letting him work through that.
"You forget how to answer your phone last night?" Sam asks mildly, heading to the table and folding himself into one of the chairs.
"What in our lives isn't?"
If he's being honest, he never really noticed the gender or sex of his vessels. He'd barely been aware of their reproductive organs or chromosomes or hormones. It hadn't made the least bit of difference. All that mattered was the bloodline and compatibility.
for Cas once, cliché as it was, and Cas had just nodded and said "Yes" when Dean asked him what he thought. So Dean put on
“You’ve been protecting your brother for a very long time,” Cas says, gently. His tenderness is almost, almost something Dean can accept.
"No." Cas steps up and places a hand on Sam's shoulder. It's not unwelcome, but these little touches of friendship and comfort are always a little awkward with Castiel. It seems normal and natural between Cas and Dean, Sam can see that, and he assumes that Cas is applying that logic of physical contact to Sam, because whatever it is that he has with Dean is his baseline for all human relationships. And Dean is too stupid about Cas to recognize that and teach him the things he needs to know about building other relationships.
Dean keeps his eyes locked on the floor, but he lets his arms drop. "He made him a Zeppelin tape?"
Sam shakes his head at both of them and his smile is a little more like Dean remembers.
"I mean, I should never have…" Dean gives one of his humorless laughs and rubs the back of his neck. "I should never have gone to Lisa in the first place, never dragged her and Ben into the crapshow of my life. But I did that, I did it, and I didn't have the right to undo it." Dean takes a deep breath, looks up at the ceiling forming above this new memory. His eyes are bright. "It wasn't my right to take their memories, to erase a year of their lives. It's not… that was a violation of just about every rule in the book. And I tell myself it was to protect them, but maybe I just didn't think I'd be strong enough to stay away if there was still any possibility of that life left."
“Great, Cas, thanks. Helpful.”
“Better be soon, best make it back before I’m dead of old age.”
"It's not that simple," Dean says. He wants to tell this kid that they didn't deserve to go to Hell, but Dean doesn't really know if he believes that.
"Great," Sam mutters. "So this is gonna go well."
Older Dean snorts, catching his eye in the rearview again. "He likes Celine Dion. Like, unironically."
“No.”
"A few hours, I think." Cas' rough voice is emotionless, but Sam knows.
blind. A couple of days with Cas, and Dean is already half-willing to jump his bones just from the way Cas looks at him, gay or not.
"No," Cas says, infuriating, irascible, impossible. "You deserved to be saved."
John lets go. It’s sudden and Dean stays on his back, sputtering, reaching up to rub his own throat. John gets up and backs away from Dean. Now-Dean can see what he couldn’t then, that John’s hands are shaking and his eyes are wide with horror. That it’s his own horror at what he’s done, what he’s capable of. It’s his self-hatred screaming in that room too.
There was a case in Arizona that Dean and Cas never made it to. They got the call at the New Mexico state line, Sam phoning in to let them know that another hunter had already taken care of the weird leads they'd been getting. What had turned out to be a pair of Black Dogs, apparently.
"The hell are you doing here?" Dean scrambles to his feet. He was pretty sure this was a nightmare. Positive, even. It couldn't be real.
Dean helps out with the animals and plants sometimes. He just tries to stay busy, because when he stands still for too long, he starts to really want a drink.
But maybe that's the point, after all. When have the Winchester boys, or anyone they really loved, ever gotten what they deserve? Maybe that's just the universe they live in. Maybe Jack is just keeping the balance by not giving them back what they've lost.
“Jesus.” Dean shakes his head. “What a stupid thing to ruin a planet for. Where’s Al Gore when you need him?”
this band, that he’d seen them play three times over the years. Not that Sammy had room to complain about his taste in music, but dad would have hated it. John couldn’t stand anything but classic rock and maybe a little soft rock for variety. He wouldn’t have gone for anything so perilously close to country music - anything with a twang in it was banned from the car when he was driving.
"You stupid motherfucker," Dean says to the sky, to the hole, to nothing. "Why'd you bring me all the way up from the pit just to make me dig myself out of my own grave, huh?"
Dean's not going to cry. That's his future and this Sam's distant past. It's a grief out of time. He's not going to cry, not when dad is still alive to him and long dead to Sam. "How'd it happen? Was it the thing that killed mom?"
Sam runs up the beach a little while later, his footprints in the wet sand swallowed quickly behind him, and shakes his stupid long hair out like a dog, spraying water all over Eileen. She laughs, and he begs her to come in the water.
"I would never give away your secrets," Cas said. His hand found Dean's spine and rubbed along his bare flesh there, stretched tight over the bony protrusions. "If you tell me his name, I
1. That's The Way - Led Zeppelin
“Yes,” Cas says. “An hour away. Which means he isn’t here to watch over. That must be a very difficult weight to put down, Dean.”
And fuck, Dean, this is… I'm so fucking worried about you, man, all the time now. First the shit you pulled when Cas was dead, back at the haunted house -"
He snoops.
Dean closes his eyes. The softness is worse than if Cas had punched him, in some ways.
Real men, real heroes, they buckled the fuck up and dealt with this shit on their own. They soothed their wounds with Metallica and Jack Daniels.
Cas frowned, searching the profile of Dean's face. "That sounds dangerous and unkind."
"You think I don't know when I'm safe to drive? You think I'd put my family in danger for something so stupid?" John's neck and face are red. "You think you know better than me? Huh? Well, do you? Answer me!"
“I would have done anything to keep Sammy safe,” Dean mutters to the carpet. It is, perhaps, his most fundamental truth.
Hank listens with no hint of disbelief or judgement on his face.
From the bed, Sammy starts crying.
Sam calls with a lead at a hospital in the middle of the fall semester. One of the kids from his internship ended up in the ER with alcohol poisoning, and when Sam went to visit he’d noticed what felt like an unusual number of patients in the hospital. He’d asked around a bit, and one of the nurses had let slip that they’d been seeing a lot of people for unexplained severe insomnia.
“I was just a kid,” Dean whispers. He’s trying it out, not totally sure he believes it yet. His head is pounding and his mouth still tastes sickly sweet from bile.
"Yeah."
“You wanna get locked up again, Sammy? I don’t think our decades in Hell are gonna go over real well.”
"'Course, one time I got caught smoking under the bleachers with some guys from shop class when we were all supposed to be in math or whatever, and the principal called my dad." Dean chuckled as he waved lazily to the guard working the entrance kiosk, signally the national park sticker on the Impala's windshield. "He did that thing, you know, where he made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes in one go. Man, I was so nauseated. Threw up a couple times that night."
"I love you," Dean says. It comes out quiet, ripped from a jagged place inside him. "I loved you. I love you. You dumb son of a bitch. If you can hear me… Cas, if you can hear me at all, you gotta know… I do. I do. Fuck you, I do."
“Vulnerable? Of course you were.”
"After that, it was in everything. Do you know what passage of the Bible I thought of more than any other in the time before I rebelled, before I fell?"
The memory dissolves, twists, reshapes itself into another motel. This one has off-white walls and tan baseboards.
"Dammit, Cas! You shouldn't have come. If I get you killed…"
It’s mid november and cold in the mountains. Dean is out on the gravel road that runs outside his property line, pacing back and forth where Cas can’t watch him. He tugs at the edges of his jacket, the olive green Carhartt that Cas bought him at the local farming store. It’s warm and utilitarian and nicer than anything Dean’s scavenged from a thrift store. It has so many
Dean looks at this grown up child and he doesn't have the words to explain what it makes him feel to see Jack sacrificing himself like this, how much it twists him up to remember how close he's come to killing Jack. They all know he may not survive this future.
“Oh yes. You boys feel that?” Molly waves a hand around in the air. “Quite cool in here, isn’t it? You don’t think a house as old as ours has central air conditioning, now do you?”
Dean knows an abrupt change in subject when he hears one, but he lets it go. "I dunno. Out? I want to see what the world looks like in 2020. You guys got flying cars or robot service workers or anything?"
his own. This physical body had become his - in the way that Anna’s body had been her own. He was still an angel, but granted this corporeal form, no longer a vessel, and yet still human on the inside. His body still ages like Jimmy, slowed a bit by his fractious grace, but otherwise marching on toward an unknown limit. Cas could take on his true form, and rather than leave an empty shell behind, his body disassembled and went with him. It isn’t something Cas fully understands.
"I suspect the intention was for those who are guilty to face their crimes, to prevent anyone unworthy from entering the sanctuary," Cas says mildly. "Tedious and a bit arcane, but not ineffective."
But maybe he was still too damaged back then to know what was in front of him. Maybe.
"Who's Sigmund?" Rhonda has returned to the table, arms loaded with plates that she sets down in front of them. Her eyes flicker to their hands on the table and if her eyes widen a bit, so does her smile.
"Oh my Lucifer, Dean. You're so maternal." Sam laughs and I just shrug and ignore his comment. Maybe I was maternal; I've never seen anything so damn cute in all my life. Except for Castiel of course but I wasn't thinking about that at the present time. "You need to get her a crib Dean, she can't sleep in your arms all night."
“Sam.”
I didn't know what to do with the information that I had been given. He was the King of the Angels? The overlord? He was the Crowley of the whole angel race and here was me, just a pitiful demon prince. I didn't deserve him, I didn't deserve someone so powerful and beautiful and he doesn't love me back, he was just saying that as part of his ruse to get information about the demons. I should have been angry at him for lying to me but who could blame him? Why would he tell me when I couldn't be trusted? I was a demon and he was an angel and nothing would change that. Me and him would have never have worked anyway and I had to accept that face. I wasn't angry at him but more at myself for letting my walls come tumbling down and letting him into my life and into my heart. I brought a hand up to my face and wiped it, bringing it back down to look at him and was shocked when I saw that they were wet. My whole face was wet and my eyes were leaking. I tasted the water that was pouring from my eyes and it was salty, bitter substance. I sniffed and wiped my eyes of the water that was leaking from them, coughing slightly and then swallowing to get rid of the lump that had formed in my throat.
