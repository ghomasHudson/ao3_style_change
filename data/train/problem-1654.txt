“Really?”
“Believe me, I’ve tried.” John sighed. “But yeah, I’ll talk to him.”
“Keep quiet.” He hissed, his gun trained on Sherlock. “I don’t want to hear a single sound.”
“Is something the matter?” John whipped around to find Sherlock standing at the top of the stairs, thankfully dressed in a pair of pajamas, and wrapped in a dressing gown.
They have had sex dozens of times before, but this time feels different, more intense, more intimate. John can feel that Sherlock is teetering on the precipice of his orgasm, and with one quick thrust, he pushes him over the edge. Head thrown back, back bowing off the bed, Sherlock shouts those three little words, “John! Oh god, John, I love you!” And it is at this precise moment that John’s climax takes him, his mind going blissfully blank.
“Ok, I see your point. Now you know I hate these types of conversations, but what about things between you and Sherlock?” Greg asks.
“Fifteen? Seriously?”
– I’m ready…  John, I’m ready now.” Sherlock gasped as John slowly pulled his fingers out. Already he felt hollow, empty; already he ached to be filled.
“Well that’s just patently untrue.” Sherlock snorted.
“She was glad you finally realized? How did

‘Just the place’ turned out to be a little Italian restaurant about midway between campus and John’s flat, and the owner, Angelo, absolutely adored Sherlock. Angelo practically made camp at their table for a full five minutes, recounting how Sherlock had caught the vandals who had been defacing the restaurant and driving away customers. After he finished singing every one of Sherlock’s praises, he then moved on to gushing over John, so pleased to be meeting ‘
Everything was a haze, his vision blurred as his eyes tried to adjust and focus, his head groggy as it throbbed in pain, his limbs felt weak, barely able to move. Finally, after several minutes of opening and closing his eyes, John’s vision cleared and, struggling to sit up on his elbows, he was able to take in his surroundings, and fear took hold. He was in a cold, square room, though cement tomb would be a more apt description. Probably no more than 10 feet by 10 feet, the room was empty, save for the old twin mattress on which he was currently laying. Completely windowless, the only source of light was a harsh incandescent light bulb, recessed in the cold grey ceiling. Opposite John, and the only apparent means of escape, was a heavy looking metal door, a flap at floor level, and another about chest high. John was being held captive.
“He? He who?”
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have said –”
"Yes. He has an almost pathological need to interfere with every aspect of my life, and is incapable of behaving like an even half-way normal human being. I have a theory that my parents found him in a crater somewhere, and decided to do an experiment to see if they could raise him to blend with mankind. They failed of course, but for some reason they still insist he’s part of the family and should be treated as such.”
Sherlock gaped at John, confused. “Really?” The disbelief evident in his voice. “After that, you still want to dance with me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
If John could keep one image with him for eternity, it would be the look of relief and smile spread across Sherlock’s face. Everything about that man was breathtaking. John grinned inwardly, knowing that it was ok to think things like that now.
“Well when you act like one…” John mumbled under his breath.
’ Sherlock thought. Then, mustering up every last ounce of confused courage he had, Sherlock reached a hand to John’s cheek, tilting his head just enough so he could press his lips to John’s. Sure he had kissed John before – quite a bit in fact – but this kiss, this kiss was a risk. This kiss wasn’t a kiss between two semi-strangers who were never going to see each other again. Sherlock kissed John knowing he would see him again; not hoping, not wanting, but knowing. And John was kissing him back. John was parting his lips, he was pressing forward, and he was kissing him back.
Why was she so interested in Sherlock’s playing all of the sudden? Wasn’t he meant to be here to unlock his own head, figuring out and heal his own problems, not for Ella to try and figure out Sherlock’s motivations?
“Very lucky” John laughed. “You look up a lot of guys you spend a weekend with, then?” John asked.
“Go for round two?” Sherlock replied, looking hopeful.
sex with my own husband?” Staring up into the deep blue eyes of the man to whom he’d given his heart, Sherlock couldn’t stop the grin that overtook his face as he pulled John back into a kiss. “Better than I ever imagined it to be,” he mumbled. “I loved it.”
“Very good,” Sherlock smiled, “and the drugs habit?”
Not used to getting such praise from anyone other than his parents, Sherlock felt himself blush. God, it felt amazing to have his work actually appreciated for once. He liked this John Watson fellow.
The ride from John’s flat to campus was short, and passed in near silence. All too soon it was four o’clock, and Sherlock found himself in one of the university’s meeting rooms. The room was set up like a mini court, in the front, facing the rest of the room, sat the University Disciplinary Committee, made up of seven professors and administrators. There was a small table – the “witness stand” – facing the committee. And finally there were chairs set up as a sort of gallery. Looking around, Sherlock saw that on one side sat Sebastian, Eddie, Brian, and their parents; while on the other sat Malcolm, Alec, Molly, and… his mother. Well, that wasn’t really much of a surprise; she had stopped by to “check in on him” at least once a week – oftentimes more – and called almost daily since she found out what happened.
“I’m not here babysitting you, I’m babysitting the murder weapon.” Lestrade said, sitting back down with his new pen.
He fought to stay awake, but the feeling of his mother’s hands running through his hair, and her calming reassurances, lulled Sherlock, allowing him to drift off to sleep.
For what felt like hours, John sat with Sherlock. Only when various medical personnel came to check his status, did John let go of his hand and step away from his side; and the moment the checks were done, John was right back holding his hand. Through it all, John spoke to Sherlock, hoping that something would trigger him to wake up, and through it all Sherlock remained unconscious. Intellectually John knew it took a while to regain consciousness after suffering a trauma like Sherlock’s; his vitals remained consistent, and though he didn’t wake, Sherlock’s pupils responded to changes in light. As a doctor, John knew there was no reason to be overly concerned yet medically, but as a man sitting next to the love of his life, listening to a machine breathe for him, listening to his heartbeat through the beeps of a monitor, John was terrified.
This stopped John in his tracks.
John settled into life at 221B almost instantly; not since the bungalow he lived when he was twelve, where he had his own little attic bedroom, had a place so quickly felt like home. As for living with Sherlock, just like when he was visiting him in hospital, they just clicked into place. By the end of the first week they had found a routine, and it was like John Watson had always lived in 221B Baker Street, and he’d always lived with Sherlock Holmes.
– differently.”
“Okay, but really, Sherlock,” he sighed, “how did you plan on us getting out of here? We’re kind of in an ‘employees only’ area.”
“Yes?” Crackled Sherlock’s voice through the speaker embedded in the wall.
man. From that moment on, my life was no longer ordinary, and my life would never be ordinary again. I got to know you and you became my friend, then you became my best friend, the best friend I could ever imagine… And I fell in love with you. I fell in love with your heart, your mind, your passion, and your world. Every day with you was, and is, exciting, a new adventure. Meeting, and falling in love with you was nothing short of a miracle, but what is even more of a miracle is that somehow,
“Now whose turn is it to ask stupid questions?” John chuckled. “Malcolm showed up to Speedy’s instead of you – nice guy, but a very poor substitute if you don’t mind me saying – and told me you were hurt. Obviously I had to come see you, find out what happened.”
“I’m starting to notice a pattern with you.” John smirked. “The first thing you do when I show up is yell at me. Need I remind you, you asked me to stop by?”
“Well pod-person or not,” John said once the giggles subsided, “if he’s your brother, then I don’t have to feel nervous giving you these. He said they’re gifts.” And out from his bag, he pulled Sherlock’s laptop and a brand-new smartphone.
“Oh it’s nothing, really.”
I want to thank each and every one of you who went on this ride with me. This fic was in the works for nearly a year, and sharing it with you all has made it all worth it. I loved nothing more than reading all your thoughtful comments, it's what keeps me writing all this silly stuff about silly crime fighters falling in love. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you!
It was late morning by the time Sherlock had showered, sufficiently tamed his hair, gotten dressed, been convinced to finish his entire plate of bacon and eggs, and John had managed to get him out of the inn and on the way. John grinned, they were right on schedule.
“That was…” Sherlock started, and then shook his head. “You know what? You’re right.” He nodded, shoving some of John’s discarded clothes into his chest. “It was just a one night stand that lasted way too long. You scratched an itch, and now it’s time for you to go. The roads should be clear by now. Have a safe trip home.” He finished with a sneer, before stalking into the bathroom, and slamming the door.
“He seems to be doing fine on his own.” Sherlock commented.
“Of course, my apologies. I’m Dr. John Watson, I’m the doctor who brought him in last night.” Technically true. “I can’t say I’m too familiar with this hospital, I’m usually over at Bart’s.” Or at least he used to be over at Bart’s while still in training, but she didn’t need to know that.
“I never said it had to be one time. I just don’t want a relationship.” Sherlock practically purrs, pressing his arousal against John’s.
During his examination, John had found two small puncture marks on Julia’s ankle that the not-Molly decided was a snake bite, and the probable entry point of the unknown toxin in Julia’s system.
It was during Sherlock’s second full day in hospital that Dr. Cook ordered he be taken for a PET and CT scan.
“We’re barely connected.” John felt a bit guilty, because that wasn’t quite true. “I just helped him out of that house… two days ago.”
They didn’t say much after that, instead they just held each other close, knowing that what they had together was special, that what they had together was precious. And just like that, entangled with one another, and with their excessive fondness for each other – their
“Mmmm” Sherlock hummed as John began running his fingers through his hair, massaging his scalp. “Not horrible, but tiring. I’d much rather have this, just this, you and me. This feels amazing.” He sighed
Once John was settled, Sherlock rechecked, and the parents debriefed again, the nurse left. Sherlock’s parents spoke in hushed tones with Mr. Watson, something about being able to breathe easier, and Sherlock laid facing John’s bed, itching to be closer but not daring to move. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from his sleeping best friend, finally taking John in in his entirety. They had cleaned him up, the blood, dirt, and grime of captivity was gone. He was topless too, a large bandage across his chest and over his left shoulder; smaller bandages covering his various other cuts and bruises. Even like this, pale, bruised, and in a hospital bed, hooked up to IVs and monitors, Sherlock thought he was beautiful. John was alive, he was safe, he was going to be okay, and he was beautiful.
– I want that too. I want that – I want you so badly.”
John was on his feet and was standing, gazing down at Sherlock before he even realized he’d moved. “Sherlock? Sherlock, love, can you open your eyes for me?” He asked hesitantly, gripping Sherlock’s hand tighter, afraid to hope.
“God no.” John laughed. “I figured you’d want to be the one to tell them if we were going to get married. No, I went to see them to get the pocket watch. Though I’m pretty sure they figured out what I was going to do with it, anyway.”
“I thought I was starting too, but like I said, he turned out to be a right prat.”
“And how do you know I’m not?” John asked.
“Yes.” Sherlock nodded. “While now I’m glad that my family forced me to go, and I know it was the right decision, I hated every second I was in there. The boredom, the pain of withdrawals, and there was no escape. When I got out, I told myself I was never setting foot in another rehabilitation center again.”
they've
“Well, from what I can see, the size of the wound and amount of blood doesn't seem consistent with blunt force trauma. If anything I’d say she passed out, hit her head on the printer corner, and that’s what caused the injury.” John says, straighten up to look at Sherlock.
“Yes, then.”
“The wear pattern on my floor begs to differ. Come here, and sit down.” John ordered, and with a glare, Sherlock flopped down next to him. “Good. Now listen, nothing’s going to go wrong tomorrow. Those little shits won’t dare try to change their story. They know if they backtrack, lie, or try anything, they’re opening themselves up to police prosecution.” Not to mention everything John would do to them.
“Alright, two conditions.” John chuckled. “Condition one: you have to respect my privacy. I promise I will never give you any reason to doubt me, so you won’t feel the need to go snooping.”
“But the season is over now.”
“You know, when I said I wanted to take you out to dinner and it’d be my treat, I had intended on actually paying for dinner.” John said, toeing off his shoes and collapsing on to the couch next to Sherlock.
“Morning.” Sherlock said, glancing up from an article on the proposed use bumblebees as pollinators for lunar grown food, just in time to catch the tail end of John’s stretch.
It hurt.
“I think I have just the thing for you.” John smirked, and flipped them over so he was straddling Sherlock’s narrow hips.
“Well that’s good news, right?”
“Because honestly, after Afghanistan and the combat hospital, working as a GP diagnosing head colds and ear infections, is going to be so boring.” John sighed. “For now, locum work is pretty much all I think I can handle. It lets me dip my toe back in the water, lets me get used to the boredom and build up a tolerance for it before I go for full-time.”
Sherlock felt himself smile. John loved him more than anything in the world, just the thought warmed him better than any blanket, fireplace, or space heater. John Watson, smart, funny, kind, handsome ex-army doctor, chose him out of everyone on earth to love. Of course, he already knew John loved him. They’d been together for over a year and a half, had swapped those three words within a month of that first night falling asleep together, and had been married for three weeks and counting; Sherlock knew John loved him. Still, that didn’t diminish the feeling he got when he heard John say it.
*******

“Yes. It’s directly over my own room in the flat downstairs. I can hear everything.” Mrs. Hudson hummed. “If I didn’t have ear plugs, I’d be awake half the night due to his pacing and thumping about. That boy just doesn’t know how to settle.”
With the plan devised, all that's left is to gather and compile the evidence.
Only when John started to move down Sherlock’s body, kissing his chest through his t-shirt, his hands sliding up under the hem, did Sherlock’s senses partially returned.
“So you just expect me to hand over the keys to my private car, all so you can have a little weekend getaway?” Mycroft didn’t even have the decency to get off his arse. He just sat behind his desk with the same patronizing look he had when they were children and he caught Sherlock trying to glue Mummy’s figurines back together. But Sherlock wasn’t a child anymore.
“And that was him? She hired her ex-brother-in-law to blow up some of her flats all for an insurance pay out?”
’ He could only think of John, his worry and fear consumed him. John had been rushed into surgery as soon as his ambulance arrived at the hospital, and they’d been given no update since.
“Down here, in my… my bedroom. The insulation upstairs is rather poor, and the bed isn’t very comfortable.” Sherlock explained, still not looking at John.
“I want you too. Oh my god, I want you too.”
once or twice, Sherlock allowed John to treat him to that overdue breakfast, and halfway through Lestrade texted. Three bodies, three distinct blood spatter patterns, injuries and body positions inconsistent with patterns, and no sign of bodies being moved. And just like that, they were a team. How he ever managed to solve cases without John by his side, Sherlock would never know. All he knew was that John made him better, and he was never going to look back.
Later, he’d have to thank her later.
By the time Mrs. Holmes got home that afternoon, a couple hours earlier than usual, Sherlock and Molly had already designed a poster, and drafted some ideas for ads.  And over the next few days, Sherlock, with some assistance, had all but papered London with missing persons posters, and taken out ad space in every newspaper and on every news site. When he was done, there wasn’t a soul in London who hadn’t seen John’s face in one way or another.
Clinging to the sheets, he knew he wasn’t going to last much longer, that familiar coiling sensation growing stronger and stronger in his abdomen. Sherlock could feel himself barreling towards the edge, moments from toppling over, when Jack suddenly released him with a wet pop, and climbed up onto the bed, covering Sherlock with his firm, compact body.
“Give me back what?” John asked, clearing his head with a little shake.
“What about them?”
“Yeah,” John beamed. “They’re pretty well known, and they have plants from all over the world here. I figured wandering around in the fresh air, and having a look might be a nice way to spend a couple hours.” He was definitely up to something.
Finishing his pathetic meal, John curled up on the old mattress, and began to wonder. He figured he had been missing for close to twenty-four hours, though John couldn’t be sure how long he was unconscious, was anyone looking for him? His thoughts immediately drifted to Sherlock. After everything they said, after everything they did last night, the confessions, the kisses, Sherlock would surely be worried, he’d be looking for him. Sherlock wouldn’t give up, Sherlock would find him. And so, with those thoughts, and the memory of Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him, of kissing those soft, perfect lips, John drifted off into a tenuous sleep.
John had just skidded around the last corner when his heart stuttered to a stop as he watched the bottom of Sherlock’s coat disappear over the edge of the retaining wall running along the riverbank. John stood frozen, unable to move, it was hardly more than a hundred meters. One hundred meters, that was all, if he had been faster, if his seatbelt hadn’t jammed – why the hell was he even still wearing his seatbelt – if he’d jumped that gate instead of gone around it. He should have been faster, he should have been right beside Sherlock, if he’d been there he could have…
So like I said, I have a new phone, and I think it would be a good idea to test whether or not the notifications work properly. Emails from AO3 notifying me that I have comments could do the trick. How about you send me some?!
“Just need some strong tea, and I’ll be alright.”
“Forever?” John chuckled, “You’d be willing to give up cases and corpses, all for an eternity here on the couch?”
“Yeah, whatever it is you have going on with Sherlock here.” Theo was just digging himself in deeper, and Sherlock would have been lying if he said he wasn’t enjoying every minute of it.
John returned a few minutes later with the heated wrap, which smelled strongly of oatmeal, and it felt… amazing. Perhaps it was the combination of the pain meds kicking in and the heat, but Sherlock’s muscles immediately felt more relaxed, and the soreness started to ebb away. Sherlock may have even let out a long sigh that to some sounded more like a moan. At that moment, Sherlock didn’t really care, he just let the heat sink in, and the relaxation spread throughout his body.
“It’s not that easy.” Sherlock mumbled, still unable to look at her. “He’d never want to see me again.”
“Oh hoho! So that’s the real reason you want me to come with you,” John laughed. “You’re just hoping I keep your brother away!”
, merely nodded instead of saying ‘obviously’ like he wanted to.
“Oh you’re quite scintillating.” Sherlock smiled to himself, John was quite scintillating,
“Then they’re stupid, because that was really cool.” He said, and this time, Sherlock smiled. “Now come on, we’re wasting time”
“The Alnwick Gardens,” Sherlock read. “You’ve brought me to a garden?”
to be a doctor.”
Well, he had almost nothing, there was one option. It was completely absurd, so feeble and laughably transparent a child could see through it. But if John didn’t quite hate him entirely, he may just appreciate the absurdity of it, appreciate Sherlock’s efforts. It was stupid, it was a risk, and it could be over in seconds, but it was worth it, John was worth it. Sherlock had to at least try.
“Nah, that was nothing. Now your relationship…” Sherlock’s smile faltered and he stopped himself, apparently worried he’d overstepped, unsure if John wanted him to continue.
This time it was John’s turn to sneer. “Really? In exchange for what?”
And just like that, John was left standing alone in the hallway, staring at Sherlock’s closed bedroom door.
doesn't
“I saw Michelle turn a look at me several times while you were speaking with her.” He said, once they had settled into a gentle sway to the music. “Anything I should know about?”
couldn't
Laughing, John handed over his water bottle and slumped down on the seat. “No, you don’t.”
“Oh my, we can’t leave something as important as that unsettled.” John said smoothly, running his hands up Sherlock’s chest. “Bed?”
It took him an embarrassingly long time – or an embarrassingly long time by his standards, in reality it was twenty seconds at the most – to realize they stood there, arms wrapped around each other, for far longer than a normal thank you or congratulatory hug should last between friends. Reluctantly he let his arms fall and Sherlock took a hesitant step back from John.
“Well, we wouldn’t have had this problem if we’d rented a place with two bedrooms like before.”
“Hey everyone!” She said cheerfully. “Greg had to take a call, so his unofficial emcee duties have temporarily fallen on me. The speeches are done, we’ve enjoyed some delicious food, now it’s time for John and Sherlock to have their first dance as man and husband!”
Fun Fact: Smarmy trust fund villain from an eighties movie is how I describe Donald Drumpf's sons.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. Sherlock laid all the ground work, and his mum was the one who actually figured it out.” Molly blushed.
“Technically yeah, but –” The rest of John’s sentence was abruptly cut off as Sherlock launched himself off the couch, jumping into John’s arms, his legs wrapped around John’s waist, and began kissing John.
“Come on, pop your leg up on the coffee table, and take this while I order us something for dinner.” John said, handing Sherlock a glass of water and a couple of his higher strength pain tablets – it was fine just the once, John was there to monitory him. The fact that Sherlock took them without any argument was a testament to just how much his leg must have hurt.
“Really?”
“Figuring out an exit strategy”
“Yes, right.” John cleared his throat and took a step backwards. Oh Mycroft was definitely a bastard. “Are you ready?”
“Wait, wait!” John couldn’t leave now, he was just getting interesting, and Sherlock hadn’t figured him out yet. “I’d… I’d really like it if you could teach me some ways of protecting myself.” Sherlock said softly.
“I love you, you brilliant, gorgeous, ridiculous man.” John hummed when the kiss finally broke.
Basically the boys have a big ol' think!
John had to bite his lip to keep from laughing. “Alright, I know you’ve probably never even seen ‘Seven’, let alone make a reference to it, but you have no idea how appropriate that was.”
“Male, late-twenties, early-thirties. Definite break to the left femur, probable breaks to the left tibia and or fibula, all of which I may have exacerbated. Possible crush injuries. No sign of spinal injuries. A contusion to his head. Definite smoke inhalation. He was conscious and talking up until only a few minutes ago.” John managed to rattle off through a coughing fit, to the paramedics who rushed up to them to take Sherlock from him. “He was trapped under a fallen ceiling beam, the fire was spreading, I had to get him out.”
“Yes, alright, you have a deal.” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes with a sigh. However, there was still that brilliant smile and faint blush that told John that the idea of a proper date was not the least bit unwelcomed. “Now go get changed, and if you’re not back here in three minutes, I’m coming up there and dragging you back down myself, regardless of whether you’re ready or not.” He commanded, pushing John towards the stairs.
“So what’s special about this case?” Sherlock called as they approached a man John guessed was DC Lestrade. His hair was going grey, but as they got closer, it was clear he was probably only in his late twenties.
! What was different about John? What made him… special?
is for you, to acknowledge that you’ve moved in.”
*******
“Yes, yes. Everything appears to be in order. Just have the recording of the confession delivered to me as soon as you’ve obtained it, and we can immediately contact the school and ‘the accused.’”
“Uuuhh, don’t remind me.” Sarah groaned, flopping down across from John. “Drew’s so great, and I really don’t want to screw this up.”
“But I’m fine, John. It was all ok.” Sherlock quietly tries reassures John.
Following Sherlock up the stairs and into the sitting room, John takes a moment to look around. “Well, I guess this is what I’d expect your flat to look like.”
“Sherrr.” John mumbled, his eyelids fighting to open.
“John, I needed to get a look at her shower soaps, and it wasn’t nearly as dramatic as you’re making it sound. I would have been fine, I am fine. You’re exaggerating.
John saw only one man leave the house before the explosion happened. The second man, the one with the coat was still in there.
“It’s Mycroft. The car’s here.”
“You’re not, and I did.”
“Which is?” John asked slowly, trying to gage the situation.
“There’s no girl. Really, there’s not!” John said when Paul raised his eyebrow. “I’m just… I’m just tutoring a guy in the class I TA for, and Thursday evenings work best for our schedules.” Not technically a lie – it was how it all started – but Christ it felt wrong saying it. Thursday nights – and weekends, and random weekday afternoons – with Sherlock were so much more than ‘just tutoring.’
"Who are you?”
“And yet you’ve been to visit him every day since he’s been in hospital, and I believe you have plans to return tomorrow. Tell me, might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
things!
Carrows wasn’t the biggest gym on campus, but it was the one John and the rest of the football team favored. And with a small room off the main workout area with wall-to-wall mats, Carrows was perfect for what he and Sherlock needed.
“Right, yeah. Sorry about that.” John mumbled, already feeling the embarrassed flush creeping up his face. He moved to take a step back, to put some distance between himself and Sherlock, only for Sherlock’s arms to remain firmly locked around his waist. The bordering on smug smile on Sherlock’s face grew even wider as his hold grew tighter, as if daring John to say something.
medicine,
“Did I… Did I do it wrong?” He never was a good gage of what was and wasn’t appropriate. Maybe a framed picture of his brain was too weird?
“No, no. It’s dumb really. Just some stupid prick I met over the weekend, and he’s sort of been stuck in my head all week.”
“Sherlock, you have to let go.” Lestrade said gently, prying Sherlock’s arms from around John. “The paramedics need to get to him.”
The next day, after a disapproving nurse forced Sherlock out of John’s bed and back into his own, DI Lestrade came to see them, and finally take their statements.
“Mmmm, thank you.” Sherlock shivered as John ran a hand up and down his back. “So does all this mean that you’re…”
“Exactly, and it sounded like he has little to no real experience with personal relationships, like all the emotions involved are new and unfamiliar.”
“Well I guess I’m ‘muttering under his breath’ John.” Now there was definitely no way John could keep from grinning, even if he wanted to. “And you must be DC Lestrade, the lone non-idiot employed by Scotland Yard.”
“Fantastic.” John breathed, then quickly cleared his throat as Sherlock turned to look at him, a small smile on his face.
“Please,” Sherlock said with a smirk, “if we decided to turn to a life of piracy, you’d never catch us.”
“You… you saw that?” John was being an idiot again.
~***~
with you now or in the future. Even if I felt even a sliver of any sort of attraction, and trust me, I don’t, I just told you that I have a partner – a boyfriend – with whom I am more than happy.”
“And I gave you an out when the invitation first came. You could have changed your mind at any point in the past six week, but you picked now to tell me?! I don’t get it, Sherlock.”
“Really? I don’t recall that every stopping me before?” Sherlock said trying to sound board, and pushed through the door with a swirl of his coat; leaving Lestrade and Molly to whatever it was they were doing, he really didn’t want to think too much about it.
“Always have to one up me, don’t you,” John huffed, pushing Sherlock back on to the bed.
“John, you should probably know,” Lestrade said from the doorway, a smirk spread across his face, “injury or not, Sherlock will always be this demanding.”
– I’m – I’m serious.” John groaned and pushed himself off of Sherlock as far as the small circle of Sherlock’s arms and legs would allow. “Sherlock, look at me. I can’t do this if this is a onetime thing, or if you want something casual. I can’t do casual. I can’t be casual, not with you. If we do this, it has to be one hundred percent. I’m in this one hundred percent. With you, it’s one hundred percent, I'm yours one hundred percent. I can’t give any less.”
Sherlock didn’t remember what happened next; one minute Lestrade had ripped him away while paramedics swarmed over a motionless John, and the next he was in hospital, a sea of unknown faces examining and questioning him.
“Punch me in the face.” John said, squaring his shoulders. He always thought demonstration was the best way to teach someone. ‘Learn by Doing’ as they say.
“Don’t be ridiculous. Sarcasm and wit don’t suit you.”
“If that’s how you apologize for being a sarcastic little arse, by all means, keep it up.” John sighed, his eyes still closed.
“They’re still a Holmes and a Hudson, them being pensioners doesn’t change anything. But that’s beside the point, you’re the one who framed the thing, you couldn’t have found it too offensive if you did that.” John said, smiling at the framed article as he pulled out his pajamas. Christ, the man took forever to get in bed!
“Are we meant to celebrate all of them?” Sherlock asked sounding worried. “Because we didn’t last year, and I – I don’t have anything, I didn’t –”
“Okay everyone, your tests are up here if you want to grab them on your way out.” John called. “ ‘A’ through ‘H’, here. ‘I’ through ‘Q’ here, and ‘R’ through ‘Z’ over here.”
“And you two were obviously very compatible in other ways as well.” Mrs. Hudson added with a wink
“Yeah, see you guys Sunday. We’ll definitely do something next week.” Mike called from the hall just before the door shut, and then they were alone.
~***~
They lay there holding each other, grinning and laughing together, for a few more minutes before Sherlock moved to sit up.
“Because you’ve barely driven.”
“Yes, doctor.” Sherlock chuckled, albeit carefully. “I fear you’re too good to me, John.”
– Sherlock.” John gasped as Sherlock tore his mouth away, breaking the searing kiss, and latched on to his neck. “What are we –
Like with the first lesson, Sherlock met John outside Carrows gym on Thursday at eight-thirty on the dot, though this time he wore his own workout clothes which fit him far better than those he borrowed from John. Not that he would ever admit it out loud, but John rather missed the sight of Sherlock wearing his old sweatshirt. Wrong size or not, it kind of suited him. And the shorts, well it was best he not to think about that.
They undressed each other carefully, lazily running their hands along each other’s bodies, kissing every new bit of exposed skin, before falling on to the couch in a naked tangle. Every time they’ve made love, it was new, and special; sometimes fast and rough, fueled by lust and desperation, and other times drawn out and careful, fueled by love and devotion. This time they made love slowly, worshiping each other, drawing out each other’s pleasure until it was overwhelming and they came to their shuddering climaxes simultaneously. Needless to say, the couch was effectively broken in by the time they were finished that evening and retreated to their bed.
“I won’t.”
“Ok, and how did you know about Greg and I playing football together?”
“Come on, just a little further! Just to the fountain over there, then we can take a break to rest!” John called over his shoulder. Sherlock still hadn’t regained his full speed, so despite being shorter, John was able to outrun him easily.
“Well, he…” John paused, “he didn’t know me before, he only knows who I am now. Not that there’s anything in my past that needs to be kept secret or anything,” he added quickly.
“Oh god no. Just….light switch….digging into my back. Bed, bed won’t hurt” John moans, thrusting up into Sherlock’s hand.
“No clue. You’re going to have to talk with Lestrade over there, he’d probably know.” The constable said, nodding towards a grey-haired man sitting at the end of the row of seats staring intently at his phone.
They talked a bit longer, John’s plans to become a doctor, some experiments Sherlock had running, until finally it was nearing dinner time, and they’d both had enough of the library. Despite how reluctant he felt to leave John’s company – he couldn’t remember a time he enjoyed himself so much and there wasn’t a crime or intricate puzzle involved – Sherlock declined John’s offer to ‘grab some dinner.’ He was just being polite after all, John had spent almost the entire day with Sherlock, and there was no way he could actually want to spend any more time with him. Sherlock hadn’t managed to alienate John yet, and he sure as hell wasn’t going to try his luck after such a successful afternoon. So once again, Sherlock and John parted, Sherlock towards his residence hall, and John to the bus stop.
“That’s really too kind of you. Thank you.” This may have only been the second time he’d ever met Mrs. Hudson, but John was starting to suspect she was the greatest landlady a bloke could ask for.
“Ha, no. I think the three hours here was enough team bonding time. Not to mention the last two years I’ve been on the team, and all this year. I’ve bonded enough with them.”
crown’s evidence, John was happy. John was truly, blissfully happy.
Next chapter we return to the normal chapter format.  January 6th approaches for our boys, shenanigans must ensue.
Sherlock – would begin.
With one last look in the mirror, John made sure his tie laid flat, secured the calla lily in his buttonhole, and then followed Lestrade out of the guest room.
Light spilled in through the open door, and Sherlock could hear low voices coming from beyond, someone else had to be in the flat.
Women weren’t his area?
“Yes, well when I was thirteen, I read a story about a boy, Carl Powers, who had been killed in a pool during a swimming competition. It was reported as an accident, that he has some sort of seizure, but I knew something was off.”
I wonder what both Mrs. H and Lestrade see between John and Sherlock, that John's missing. Your guess is as good as mine. But it's a bit weird, don't you think?
~***~
“Sherlock, you’re getting worked up when you really don’t need to.” John sighed, trying to keep his tone level, trying to infuse as much calm into the tense atmosphere. “You have a mind that far outstrips every other living person, but your leg is still that of a human being, and you broke almost every bone in it, it’s going to take time to heal just like everyone else’s. Hell, you’re even ahead of the norm. Trust me, I know it sucks, really I do, but just give it time.”
The day cracked on in much the same way as the day before. John asked about some of Sherlock’s old cases, then tried to get him interested in some old movie he found flipping through the channels.
“Deal” Sherlock smiled, taking John’s outstretched hand to seal their agreement. John’s hand was so warm, the calluses felt… nice against Sherlock’s palm, and if Sherlock let his grip linger for a few extra seconds, John didn’t seem to notice, or say anything.
“Do you promise not to laugh or tell anyone else?” John said, his face turning deadly serious.
“Ok,” Sherlock breathed after god knew how long, and began to slowly roll his hips. “Ok, you – you can move.”
He sat so close; Sherlock could feel the warmth radiating off him, he could feel it soaking through his clothes, and into his skin. He sat so close, almost touching, but not.
“Body.” Sherlock choked. “They found a body.” His cheeks were wet, he was crying. When did he start crying?
Unable to take the distance – as small as it was – anymore, Sherlock pulled John back to him, kissing him with such force that he saw stars. He poured everything into that kiss, every want, every feeling, everything he could not say in words.
because of physical attraction.” Sherlock’s head snapped back and he once again leveled John with the same intense stare he did right before dragging John back to Lestrade’s car. “The level of my physical attraction to you should be obvious by now. I meant that it’s more than that, more than just physical.”
Neither lasted long after that, Sherlock’s rocking became erratic as he dropped down on John harder and harder, John buried himself in deeper and deeper, clinging to Sherlock’s back with one hand, and pumping him with the other. And when they both came together, it was a revelation. Sherlock’s muscles contracting around John so tight that John swore he saw stars as he emptied himself for what felt like hours into Sherlock’s shuttering body.
“Isn’t it a bit late to be giving me the ‘you break his heart’ talk?”
“Oh, sorry about that.” John blushed. “You’re… uh… you’re a good dancer.”
Also, I know army doctors aren't sent out in the field, but for the sake of the story, they bend the rules for John since he's so good.
“Right, not a bastard. You’re a bit of an arse. Is that better?”
“Finally!” Sherlock sighed, and allowed John to lead him out of the hospital and into a waiting cab. Oh the things he was going to do to John in the back of that cab; he was just formulating a list when John slid in after him, and Sherlock promptly fell asleep, slumped against his protector.
“Oh yeah. Not only is he unbelievably handsome and clever and fantastic in bed and oh so sexy, but he’s also super into me. And protective too, he hates to see a single hair messed on my head.”
Sherlock slumped forward, his hands going to his head. “That’s the point, John. I didn’t want to stop either. I’ve been wanting this for months now, and just when I’m about to get it, I mess it all up!”
“You’re a former army officer, only a little over a year discharged, still at near military fitness levels, I may never be able to outrun you.” He would, Sherlock had six inches on John. Still, it would take time, and Sherlock wasn’t sure how much longer he could manage having to take semi-orders from a John at near military fitness levels, before he did something regrettable.
“You really don’t.” Sherlock took a few deep breaths, attempting to regain some semblance of control. There was no way around it, he had to come clean.  In for a penny… “I’m going to be very clear; I am not, nor was I ever, in a relationship with John Watson. He is not my boyfriend, he was never my boyfriend. I had only met him the night before, he was just a…” God he didn’t want to finish that sentence.
“Thank you very much. And would you please do me the favor of uncuffing my son?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmmm, I do like a challenge.” John smirked, raising an eyebrow. “But yeah, I’ve never actually been big on having my airways constricted.”
“John, I’m seconds away from having your trachea under my hands, do you really want to challenge me now?”
“They really didn't. Your watch did.” A small smile forming on Sherlock’s face. “It’s only about 5 years old, but the style is clearly more an older individual’s taste. So, it was a hand-me-down, most likely from a parent. You wear it, but it’s not well maintained. You want to honor the previous owner, but you’re a bit bitter about it. You loved the previous owner, but you think their death was avoidable. The fact that you look guilty about drinking a second beer, suggests a family history with alcohol you hope to escape.”
Saturday arrives, and it’s late morning when John arrives outside the museum. He’s fifteen minutes early, but the butterflies filing his gut and chest wouldn’t calm down, and sitting around the flat wasn’t helping. Not that hanging around museum is helping much either. After fifteen minutes of alternating between pacing back and forth in front of the museum entrance, and fiddling with his phone, John looks up to see Whitney walking towards him. To John’s utter amazement, Whitney’s dressed casually for once, clad in a simple pair of jeans, a thin short sleeved t-shirt, and sneakers.
‘Stage Three’ was set to begin the next day. No longer was Heather going to come to the flat, but Sherlock was going to go to the physical therapy center – as an outpatient of course – for his sessions three times a week. He was finally getting the chance to get out of the flat, and stretch his legs so to speak. He was finally strong enough to re-enter society to a certain extent. He still had to ‘take it easy’ and Lestrade had nixed the idea of him going to crime scenes, but he was no longer so tied to the flat, he was nearly free.
“Why do I get the feeling you’re not telling me the truth.” Sherlock said, narrowing his eyes at his mother for a few moments as if trying to suss out what she was hiding.
Please enjoy, and keep your fingers crossed that wireless works on my computer when I get home (I really don't want to buy a new one)
Allowing himself only a moment’s pause, John took a single deep, steadying breath, gave his head a quick shake to clear it, and slowly climbed the seventeen steps to their flat. It was the only way to know for sure.
“Is there a restaurant in central London whose owner you haven’t solved a case for?”
Sometimes being a TA came in very handy. As soon as Sherlock gave him the names, John was able to easily look up Sebastian Wilkes, Edward Van Coon, and Brian Lukis. He knew what they looked like and had their schedules within seconds. Strictly speaking he wasn’t allowed to go into the files of students not in his course, but a little abuse of power wasn’t going to hurt anyone. Actually, it might hurt those three, John thought as he pressed record on his phone, and strolled over to where Sebastian and his lackeys were standing.
“Alright.” John nodded.
“Wow, he must be something for you to be thinking about him all week.” Sarah smiled. “You much really like him.”
“Yeah, what can I say, I like smartasses.” John grinned.
With his late night meal of fish and chips in hand, John settled on the ground, back against the trunk of a tree, and looked out over a quiet pond. After he and Sherlock got their food, Sherlock had all but dragged him to a nearby park. According to Sherlock, while the food was excellent, the ‘dining area’ left much to be desired. John had to agree, and sitting alone in the park with Sherlock, the moonlight illuminating the water (and his dining companion), the light breeze rustling through the trees, sounded much more appealing than sitting on cracked plastic chairs in the fluorescently lit eatery.
“Then we’ll leave before he gets the chance. Sedate him again and just leave the doors open. We’ll be gone by the time he wakes up.” Sherlock pled, he was desperate, his eyes began to prickle.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice came from the doorway, all bite and annoyance gone. “John, I’m sorry… I… I didn’t realize what you might be feeling. I never meant –”
John’s next call was to Mrs. Hudson. Lestrade had let him know that he had already spoken to her, and was keeping her in the loop, but John felt she ought to get the news from him directly. She seemed relieved to hear from him, and even more so when he said he was staying and not leaving until Sherlock is released.
“I know,” John grinned, “and yet you still seem to love me.”
Locating John proved even easier. With the case out of the way, Sherlock was able to finally think clearly and focus. He had John’s name, the name of his next of kin, his place of work, and, after commandeering Lestrade’s computer for a quick search using the Yard’s network, he had John’s address. The only thing left was to get John to agree to see him. Sherlock just needed an excuse to get his foot in the door.
– don’t stop.”
“Yeah,” John nodded enthusiastically, completely oblivious to the sudden jolt of fear that shot through Sherlock. “And he also always had spit in the corners of his mouth. It was super gross!”
Not ten second later, his phone buzzes again.
“Just don’t tell John.” Sherlock whispered, apparently unaware of who he was talking to. “And no sex…” John nearly choked. “I bet John’s really good at sex. I want to have sex with him, I only want to have sex with him, only him. We sort of had sex. Don’t tell him I told you, I don’t know if he wants people to know. But he called me Bumble, like the bee. I like bees, but not as much as I like John. It goes bees, then puzzles, then John on top. I bet John's a top. He wants to take me on a date. But don’t tell John, I don’t think he wants people to know.”
John just ignored her. It didn’t matter, it didn’t matter that they fought; it didn’t matter if they broke up or were in limbo, those months away didn’t matter. None of it mattered. All John could think about was that Sherlock was hurt, and he wasn’t with him. He needed to get to Sherlock.
For the next two hours, Sherlock slowly walked from exhibit to exhibit, examining each plant, and telling John about their various properties, how they killed, and some of the more gruesome crimes in which they’d been involved. If there was a better gift John could have given him, Sherlock didn’t know what it would be. He even produced gloves and plastic baggies from his carrier bag so that Sherlock could take samples home with them. Though Sherlock did have to promise to properly label all the cuttings and keep them out of their kitchen, but that was easy enough to do. It was fantastic, absolutely fantastic.
Now I’m going to let you go, and you run along and tell the others exactly what we discussed. Have I made myself clear?”
John looked up to find Sarah standing the doorway.
John frowned. “Back in with you?”
*******
“A one night stand?” Mrs. Hudson said matter-of-factly. “I know.”
Was Sherlock hot? Sherlock was gorgeous, so unbelievably gorgeous. Those eyes that could never settle on one color, blue one second, then green the next, then grey the next; those eyes that lit up as he got lost in an explanation of an experiment or a case. His dark curls, so wild, yet seemed to inexplicably always fall perfectly in to place, even as he was bounding around a crime scene. And those lips, those pink, full lips with that perfect cupid’s bow that rattled off facts, deductions, observations, or criticisms at a mile a minute. How he ached to kiss those lips, to run his tongue across them, nip at them, part them to get even the smallest tastes as he worshiped Sherlock’s mouth. No, Sherlock wasn’t hot, he was perfect, and god how John wanted him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then we say we are on our way to see DC Lestrade. Either they say he’s not available or they bring us to him. If it’s the former we proceed to the exit. If it’s the latter, then when we can just tell Lestrade we were hoping he had some cold cases for us. Either way, we’re in the clear.”
No. No, Sherlock was not going to let Theo do this to him, not again. He was not the twenty-two year old, strung out kid whose only ‘friend’ had told him he’s just too crazy to be around, that nothing could ever fix him. Sherlock was an adult, he was clean, he had a life, and a career. Sherlock had people who mattered to him, people who cared about him, and he had John, he had… he had love. One glance at Theo was enough to tell Sherlock that Theo had none of that.
Sherlock looked away, and for a few moments John wasn’t sure if he was even going to say anything. “Sebastian Wilkes.” He finally said, letting out a breath.
Fortunately Mrs. Holmes hadn’t bothered to try any further to persuade Sherlock to let the Yard handle the CCTV footage. Unfortunately, she had meant it about wanting Sherlock to eat something, and dropped a cellophane wrapped tuna sandwich and a bottle of water next to him as they waited for Mr. Holmes to join them. While he did drink the water, Sherlock barely glanced at the sandwich. Honestly, tuna salad was a risk even without an already upset stomach.
They soon fell in to a companionable silence as they made their way to a main road. John didn’t feel the need to say anything, to talk, just walking along, Sherlock at his side was enough, it was comfortable. Being with Sherlock was comfortable.
“Don’t say anything.” Lestrade said, lifting a hand. “Just get out there, and get in place!”
, but Sherlock knew better. No, this woman was still being paid by his brother, and was probably another one of his spies. He’d have to make sure she was never left alone anywhere in the flat, he couldn’t give her any opportunity to plant more of Mycroft’s bugs.
“I’ll give you the night to say your goodbyes” Moriarty said, standing up. “I told you I’d break you, I told you I’d destroy you. I always keep my promises, Sherlock.” He called over his shoulder as he strolled out of the room, followed silently by Seb.
Both Sebastian and Brian grinned back at John, but Eddie was frowning at him.
“You know the saying that doctors make the worst patients? Yeah, that’s a lie.” Leah sighed. “It’s their families. The doctors don’t take care of themselves, but think they know better, so you have to look after them in addition to the patient.”
“Why should I?” Sherlock called back.
“I do have one question.” John said, Sherlock just raised an eyebrow. “Did Mycroft really bring his PA to our wedding?” Every time John had seen Sherlock’s older brother, the always unreadable Anthea was at his side, though thankfully her ever present phone was nowhere in sight.
“John,” he mumbled, half out of embarrassment, half out of sheer arousal. “I’m hardly beautiful.”
“How sweet. I can only assume you are referring to the detective inspector and pathologist.” Christ, this man really was watching Sherlock. “I hate to burst the beautiful illusion you’re building of Sherlock, but he only tolerates them so long as they can provide him with the things he wants, cases and corpses. I am the closest thing to a friend Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.”
John wanted Sherlock so badly it sometimes hurt. But he couldn’t
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock sighed and buried his face in John’s neck. “John, do you know how ridiculously romantic you sound?”
“Oh, sorry. I’ll stop.”
“Ok, alright.” Lestrade nodded. “And what about any other injuries. His head? And he was trapped in a burning building…”
“Two, before we do anything else, I want to go on a date with you. And I mean a real date, where we go out together in public and have fun.”
Moving to settle himself on top of John, Sherlock cocked an eyebrow. “Not permanently, I hope.” He smirked, and began running his lips up John’s neck, sucking gently where jaw and ear met. He could feel John start to squirm beneath him, whimpering as he allowed himself the smallest of tastes of John’s skin.
“Lestrade’s just checking to see what Donovan got from the fence and her sweep of the car, and if the other team has the brother, they’re fine. What were you going to say? If I had really fallen, you never would have what?”
Where else would he be?
“I never thought I’d help solve a murder, and then have to run from the police thirty second later. That was…” But whatever John was going to say is lost when Sherlock abruptly shoves his tongue down John’s throat, and begins pushing off John’s jacket, and clawing at his t-shirt. After a few shocked moments, John begins to respond, hands immediately tugging at Sherlock’s scarf, and attempting to divest Sherlock of his coat.
Sherlock sniffled, blinking away the wetness in his eyes. “I know… I do too.” He whispered.
“Yes, but they don’t have as many resources there as we do here, so I can really use my ability to its fullest potential.”
They had stopped dancing at this point, all Sherlock’s not insignificant focus redirected to kissing and exploring every inch of John’s mouth.  Jesus fuck, kissing never felt like this before, he was burning.
Next up, John's back in London, and meets some old and new faces!
“Yep! I got it cleaned and restored!”
John looked up from the page he’d been stuck on for ten minutes, to find Nurse Leah standing in the doorway. “What?” He frowned. “Oh, no, my sister brought me some things last night.” He said, nodding to his gym bag in the corner. “Clothes, book, toothbrush, just the essentials so I can feel at least slightly civilized.”
“Here, since you’ve been having trouble ordering.” The man said, handing John the scotch.
“It says to use the wrench, here,” Sherlock said handing John the wrench, his breath hitching slightly as their fingers brushed, “to turn the ‘flywheel turning hole.’ Good god, who names these things?” He mused.
“That’s not a bad name,” Sherlock said, giggling to himself all the same. “It’s just the Scottish version of James.”
I hope my attempt at smut wasn't too off putting.
Mrs. Hudson’s torn expression made John feel like a real arse.
“What is it?”
“Are you ok?” John asked again, running his nose along Sherlock’s cheek.
“They are, I meant even more so.”
“You know what I meant.”
John’s stomach dropped. “Wha… What? No, it’s not… I don’t have…” He started to stutter.
“Pretty much, yeah. I can still use my training and the skills I have left to help people. It may not be exactly what I want, but at least it’s something.”
"Ah, John. So pleased you could join me, please have a seat,” the man said, motioning to one of the two leather wingback chairs facing each other.
– I’ve wanted this for –
John’s grin broadened, and his cheeks pinkened. “Yes, well, that ordinary life went right out the window years ago when, late one evening, I was leaving the library and I met you… this surly, stubborn, utterly ridiculous boy; this
He did not ‘have this’. Sherlock refusing to let John trip him up, proved far easier said than done. They started off with the attack from behind – apparently it’s the one people who aren’t intent on actually killing you use. Don’t struggle, get pressure off the windpipe, and drop down fast. Explained simply, but in practice? Extremely difficult, though the difficulty had nothing to do with technique.
“Don’t ask stupid questions, John. What do you think?”
Christ, was there nothing this kid wouldn’t question?
“Yeah, but that’s kind of the point of Christmas; getting excited and indulging the people you care about. I think it sounds great.”
was; but another part couldn’t get enough of seeing how Sherlock’s mind worked. “Go on.” John said quietly, he had to know.
“You do.” John hummed. “So I guess… I guess I’ll see you Tuesday then; unless you come to the game tomorrow. It’s away this week.”
“We’ve transferred him to the ICU.”
“Absolutely. John, what was she saying about me?”
with an attractive partner, it all makes an already simple mind even duller.”
don’t have to worry about classes the next day.” John chuckled.
involved.”
With a quick goodbye to Mr. Holmes, Sherlock and his mother set out for Imogen’s office. Mrs. Holmes had called on the way, so DI Lestrade and Sergeant Evans were waiting for them when they arrived.
John sounded nervous; John looked nervous. Was he actually asking Sherlock his permission to take someone to the party? If he was, then the answer was no. No, no no. No, John was not allowed to take anyone anywhere. John was not allowed to leave Sherlock again.
Almost two years wasn’t nearly enough time, they needed decades together.
Sherlock didn’t even bother opening his eyes; he had just settled himself on the couch, legs stretched out, and his hands steepled under his chin. “It would appear so.”
*******
Without another word, John quickly pulls Sherlock towards a shabby looking row house, and through the door of the second flat on the left. Before the door is even fully closed, Sherlock has John forced up against the wall, mouth attacking John’s, as his hands start working at John’s belt. Never known for idle hands, John starts on the buttons of Sherlock’s unbelievably posh shirt
John knew he should take the couch, it was the right thing to do, but dammit he was sick of doing the right thing all the time. It was his bed, he had the right to sleep in his own bed. And after all, it wasn’t like he was going to be taking advantage of Sherlock, the bed was big enough for both of them. And so, after setting out Sherlock next dose of pain meds and a bottle of water, John slid in under the covers and fell asleep with Sherlock Holmes next to him for the first time.
“So,” John said, turning back to Sherlock after waving goodbye to Mrs. Holmes, “any idea where you’d like to go?”
Not even a month after being transferred, John is in the field, tending to casualties of a roadside bomb, when his shoulder explodes in a burst of white-hot searing pain. The shock sets in before he can even think about what to do for himself, and loses consciousness. The medic with him calls for back up, and does the best he can to stop the bleeding, but he’s no John Watson.
With a sigh, Sherlock opened his eyes, staring straight at the ceiling, and not looking at his unexpected house guest.
,” Sherlock moaned, pushing John back against the door frame, making his want very apparent, “you did that on purpose!”
“Fine, I’ll let you in. You’ve gotten so lazy, John.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
“You –
He didn’t know he was strong enough, to have John so close, to be so close to everything he’d ever wanted – or at the very least, ever wanted for the past six years – only to have to watch John fall in love with a woman all over again, and leave him like before. He should put a stop to everything, put some distance between himself and John, if only to keep his heart from shattering more than it already was. But Sherlock was weak, so painfully and pathetically weak. He drank up those little signs of affection and closeness like a dying man lost in a desert. He saved those moments, stored them in his mind palace; he would savor those memories for when John inevitably left him for good, and they were all he would have left of the only man he’d ever love.
Going slowly, John carefully made his way further into the house, keeping his eyes peeled and his ears open as he moved from room to room. He was just starting to give up, thinking that maybe the man escaped out a back door or window, when he heard a faint moan and what sounded like coughing coming from the kitchen.
“Yeah, alright. This about my son? Did you find him on the streets? Did he get arrested?”
Sherlock just rolled his eyes. “I’m hardly going to forget.” Honestly, him of all people.
For the first time in his nineteen years of life, Sherlock’s words completely left him. He was breathless and utterly speechless. Never had anyone ever wanted him one hundred percent, never had anyone cared enough to want even a fraction of that. But John did. As he stared up at John, into his deep blue eyes, eyes that were wide, full of trepidation, hope, and most of all, honesty, Sherlock knew he was telling the truth. John wanted him one hundred percent. Dear god, John actually wanted him one hundred percent.
“That’s football for you.” John shrugged. “Oh, but that actually reminded me. Since the season’s over and I don’t have games and an intense practice schedule to deal with, would you mind if we switch our gym night to Fridays? I figured that way we don’t have to worry about classes the next day.”
I'm really proud I've manage to post this today, it's been a crazy couple of days.
“What? No! No one’s getting kicked out. No.” John shook his head. God, was that really what Sherlock thought of him? Did he really think John would do that after everything that had happened over the past few days? “It’s about who did this to you.”
The rest of the evening passed easily enough. The prospect of two boxfuls of cases seemed to be enough to distract Sherlock from his convalescence, and John was just happy to eat leftovers and study for his orthopedics mid-term in the relative calm. The calm, however, was not to last very long because there was one more subject to be broached, and John was not looking forward to it.
Ten points to whoever can tell me from where I stole some of the wording for John and Sherlock’s wedding kiss!!
“Well, why don’t you walk me through it?” Molly suggested, sitting down on one of the few empty patches on the bed.
Sherlock had to read the alert twice, no, three times, before the words on the screen actually registered. In a heartbeat, he pushed back from his bench, and was out the door, barely remembering to grab his bag as he bolted from the classroom. Sherlock couldn’t breathe, he had to see, had to check, had make sure. It wasn’t John, it couldn’t be John, it couldn’t end like this.
“Theo, Theo Fuller.” Theo said, still smiling, and extended his hand towards John. He let it drop when John made no move to reciprocate. “Listen, I meant no offense.”
The last person was Mycroft, and John weighted whether or not to contact him, not knowing how he would be received. Mycroft was probably getting up to the minute reports, and probably knew everything that was going on as it happened; he didn’t
“Wait, really?”
“Sherlock?”
John seemed to pick up on Sherlock distracted state, shifting slightly to put a bit of space between them.
available Thursday nights?” Paul laughed, along with about half the team. “Every time we’re going out, you’re always ‘busy’ or have ‘already made plans’. Your weekends are starting to get pretty busy too. So come on, who is she? Is she hot?”
“They might risk it.” Sherlock whined.
“You… I want you in –
“No, it’s perfect.” Whitney says, barely above a whisper. “It’s what brought you back.” At that, John surges forward, capturing Whitney’s mouth once more. Soon Whitney lifts her arms above her head as John pushes her shirt off her.
“Well I wanted to know how the hearing went. John texted me, but I wanted specifics. That was as good a time as any.” Mike shrugged. They were already late, so a few more minutes wouldn’t have hurt anyone. Mike didn’t understand why Becca would even care.
“God yes!” John breathed, and suddenly John’s pants were gone, and Sherlock felt John’s calloused hand wrap around both them, pinning their leaking cocks together, and slowly stroking up and down.
Sherlock –
“Well how was I supposed to know Angelo was going to insist everything be on the house?” Of course, Sherlock knew Angelo was going to do exactly that. He hadn’t paid to eat there in over a year. “And you paid the tip, so I think that counts.”
(virtual tissues are available should you need them)
“Will do,” John nodded, not bothering to address what had been said before Sherlock’s interruption. “And thanks for the files and the…” he added waving towards the fridge, and the spleen it now contained.
Welp, we've made it, the last chapter! Enjoy!
“Oh you’re one to talk,
“Yeah, right, ok.” John closed his eyes to better picture the man, he really did only get a glimpse. “Well, he was maybe mid to late forties. He looked clean, he was dressed casually but it didn’t look like he was sleeping rough, or anything. Stocky, maybe two or three inches taller than me. Balding, reddish-brown, kinda brassy hair. Oh, and he had a goatee.”
“Hmmm, well that may be, but I’d still like to hear about it from you.”
“Yeah, I think I did… You… you
“Thank you… I love you, Sherlock Holmes. I think I fell in love with you the moment we met and you showed my just how remarkable you are. I fell in love with you that first day, and I have been falling in love with you every day since… That’s my vow; as long as I am alive, I will love you. Heart, body, mind and soul, I will love you. You are the love of my life, Sherlock Holmes, and I will spend every day for the rest of that life proving it to you.”
the Yard,” Sherlock huffed, offended. “I sometimes led them my assistance when they are out of their depth, which is always.”
After the ceremony, as people are running around exchanging congratulations and hugs, John catches a glimpse of black curls. For a spit second he allows himself to hope, to hope that Sherlock has come to tell him he loves him, that he was just upset, and has come to tell John he wants to make things work between them. John will tell him he is sorry too, for just springing it on him, he will then take Sherlock over to introduce him to his mum, and everything will be right in the world. But just as quickly he saw the curls, they are gone and the ache floods back in full force.
“My number, of course. I… uh… I guess I didn’t know if you really wanted it, or just figured asking was the proper thing to do.” Sherlock mumbled hesitantly, looking around.
“That’s because whoever took John made it look like he ran away! Are you people really so thick you can’t look past the obvious!? And I’m sitting right here, you don’t need to talk about me as if I’m not in the room!” Sherlock cried, punctuating the last statement with another rattle of his cuffs, earning a few looks from the other officers milling about.
– what are we doing? Should we –
Comments are always welcome!
Finally free of worries and fears, John and Sherlock can be open and honest with each other. And just maybe, they can have what they've always wanted.
– Oh my god, John I’m close! I’m going to, I’m going to…”
“And what kind of future doctor would be if I set your recovery back.” John grinned. Was he flirting? Sherlock was well aware of the fact that John had flirted with him the night before – was it really only twenty-four hours ago? – but surely after everything that happened, after everything he had said, John wouldn’t still be interested. No… no John wouldn’t be flirting with him anymore, that ship had sailed.
“Did you break something? Set something on fire?” John continued. “Are you worried I’ll be upset, because Love, whatever it is, it’s alright. I promise I won’t be mad. There’s nothing you could possibly do to warrant you being so worried.”
Well their first date when amazingly, I wonder how date number two will go?
hiccup with Sherlock happened, you took it as the first step towards disaster, and decided to pack it in.”
So yeah, drop me some of those precious comments, I'm rather poor, so they're the only think of value I have!
“So guess what idiot got halfway home before realizing he forgot his computer on his desk?”
The nightmares, of course she was going to bring up the nightmares. Of course he still had the nightmares, not every night, not anymore, but still all too often he found himself on surrounded by sand and the cries of the men he couldn’t save. Though… though there had been a change, hadn’t there? The nightmares came less often, and then there was…
“No, I do want to hear what you think; honestly. I’m certainly not getting anywhere.”
“Apologies.” Sherlock huffed. “I’m talking about the woman who appears in quite a few of your family photos.” He explained pointing to one picture of what John assumed was Mrs. Rachlin and her family, and there standing next to Mr. Rachlin, was a young woman in her early twenties.
“Well, when I get back –”
sex, but the fact that she thought it appropriate to talk about it, to let him know that she knew? It was absolutely mortifying. Sherlock had never been so embarrassed in his life; he could barely look at her.
“You know,” John said once the concert had ended, and people started to leave, “I can’t ever imagine a life anywhere but in London, but it is nice to get away sometimes and just relax in the relative calm and quiet.”
“Hey, are you the one who beat up that Holmes kid?” John asked feigning nonchalance. It wasn’t the smoothest opener, but not everyone could be as skilled in the art of deception as Sherlock.
“Don’t mention it.” Mrs. Hudson blushed. “We had to make sure you have somewhere decent to stay until Sherlock’s fully recovered.”
“Everything! He’s my… he’s Sherlock. Jacket, I need my jacket.” John rushed around, throwing his jacket on and grabbing his wallet off the table. “I can’t find my phone. Where the fuck is my phone!?” He was panicked, Sherlock was probably dying, and John was just standing around Harry’s flat, looking for his god damn phone.
Molly took the phone, reading quickly before looking up. “We can’t know if it’s him.” She said.
“Nay, it’s fine, you’re already settled here.” John said, setting the bowl on the side table and adjusted Sherlock’s pillows again. “Just don’t expect me to wait on you hand and foot after this.” He added pointedly.
you suggesting?”
“Ok, that’s it, Sherlock. What’s the matter?” John asked. Enough was enough
“How could you possibly know that?” John asked, finally breaking his silence. He believed him of course, but he heard everything Sherlock had heard, saw the same pictures as Sherlock, so what was it that made Sherlock so sure that this Emily was Mr. Rachlin’s daughter?
With their captor distracted, Sherlock met John’s eye, giving his hand a firm squeeze, and nodded his head. It was now or never. John charged Seb, managing to jam the fork into his neck, while Sherlock simultaneously darted forward, plunging the knife as deep into Seb’s thigh as possible.
“John, you stole me a skull.”
“John, don’t make fun of me, I’m being serious.”
“Freeing, interesting word choice. You no longer feel trapped, having to hide how your time over their changed you.”
“I’m not going to be able to negotiate myself out of it, am I?” Sherlock frowned.
The music and the other dancers soon faded into the background, and the world narrow to just John and Sherlock moving together as one. He couldn’t say who it was who actually initiated it, but suddenly John’s mouth was on Sherlock’s, his tongue sweeping that plush bottom lip before sucking it between his own, biting down just enough to illicit a deep, throaty moan from the man wrapped around him, the sound shooting straight through him. He released Sherlock’s bottom lip, only to lick along Sherlock’s defined Cupid’s bow before Sherlock took control and deepened the kiss, his tongue parting John’s lips to dip into his mouth.
“Yeah, she hugged me and started to cry, saying how much she was sure you were going to love the watch. Then your dad shook my hand and told me how lucky you were to have found me, and how happy he is that I’m in your life.”
John reached into Sherlock’s travel bag and pulled out something yellow and black.
In those weeks they managed to solve a string of jewelry store robberies – nobody seemed to notice that a different person with the same Pomeranian was in the store an hour before each robbery – they caught two stalkers, and exonerated a third who was just a tagger in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sherlock also managed to destroy two kettles, the toaster, and spill something that stained one of the kitchen chairs yellow.
“So… So this was all… You telling me that you weren’t going to be back until the day after tomorrow, that was just…” Sherlock trailed off, still trying to get a handle on what was happening. John was right there in front of him. And he was dressed… he was dressed like that.
“Sherlock Holmes.”
“You severely overestimate the intelligence of the average student, John. You see all the tests, you should know how easily confused they are.”
to meet? And none of those air quotes around helping. I think your victory today is proof enough that my being nosy and pushy did help.” God, even when he was trying to be smug John was endearing.
John just shook his head. “I’m starting to wish you hadn’t. How long are you going to hold that over me?”
“Quick John, distract the others! I’m going to get a hair sample, maybe some nails if I’m lucky. I want to do some tests.” Sherlock says, pulling out a Swiss Army knife, and small baggy.
“God yes. I mean, I do.”
God, what the hell had he been thinking? He didn’t do this kind of stuff anymore. Then again, for the last three years he hadn’t really had the need to, not since… but that all changed. Christ, he felt pathetic, he hadn’t come out to mope and be maudlin about what was lost. It was the start of a new year – for both the calendar and for himself – and he was going to forget the past. And while he knew he couldn’t delete it, he would certainly try to put it behind him. That was what tonight was about, finding a distraction so that he could finally start putting the past behind him, where it belonged.
“His cronies were there too, so they saw the whole thing which made it even better. But he did turn his face just in time, so unfortunately there won’t be any lasting damage.”
Oh. She thought John was…
“UGH, you two couldn’t be more transparent if you tried.” Sherlock groaned. He had had enough; he couldn’t listen to them any longer. “Molly, I’m taking the blood samples, and I’ll finish them at Baker Street. I can’t concentrate here; all the skirting around topics and talking without talking going on.” He added pointedly. And they have the nerve to say he had an emotional disconnect.
“As if you don’t already know. I’m sure you paid one intern or another to follow me and deliver a full minute by minute report.”
“Alright mate, listen, I’m going to give you some advice because I’ve been there. Sherlock is fun is short doses. You may think you’ve got something real going on now, but give him a month, and you’ll be pulling your hair out. You’ll be running for the hills. Trust me on that.”
“Nuh-uh-uh, it’s Dr. Watson-Holmes from now on… Mr. Watson-Holmes.”
“Me too.” Sherlock hummed, snuggling closer. Oh god, he was a perfect fit. “I’m glad you were my first too. You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted to… I’m glad I got to experience this with you.”
John allowed himself a few moments to savor the moment for a little longer, before slipping his phone out of his jacket pocket to check the quality of the recording. Finding it up to snuff, there was only one more thing to do.
I have a couple one-shots in the pipeline (one all but done), so I'll be seeing all you lovely people very soon. But until then...Thank you, thank you, thank you!!
“Mmmm. As lovely as comforts and confines sound, I really need a shower. And some breakfast, I seem to have burned quite a lot of calories in the last twelve hours.”
– just touch me. Let me – let me touch you. Please,” Sherlock whimpered, digging his fingers into the back of John’s neck as he reclaimed his mouth over and over again. “John, please – I want to feel you.”
John. Not yet, maybe not ever. The spare bed and bedroom held far fewer memories, and anyway, it was closer and far safer than trying to navigate the stairs.
“Nothing, nothing. Mr. Holmes is in room fifty-seven. It’s just at the end of the hall on the left. Oh, and Dr. Watson,” The nurse said, stopping John just as he was about to walk away, “just as a bit of warning, he’s been rather irritable since he woke up this morning, so I’m not sure how amiable he’ll be to visitors.”
“Course I do. Don’t want this to be the last I see of you.”
“So do you have any nicknames, like Will, or Billy, or do you just go by William?” John asked. There were still a few minutes left before play break and John had already finished showing Sherlock around the classroom and explaining the classroom rules, so they were back in their desks while the rest of the class sat around and waited for the bell. “Sometimes my sister calls me Johnny, but I hate it. I just like being called John.”
“I didn’t say we pretend it didn’t happen, I said delete it. Pretending is still knowing. Deleting is as if it never happened at all, it’s purging the knowledge.”
I should be working on a presentation for work, but I wanted to get this out today!
“John,” Sherlock flushed – once again from both arousal and embarrassment – John really shouldn’t be able to make him blush like this anymore, “we haven’t changed our names yet, we haven’t even started the application process.”
You'll notice the chapter count increased from 15 to 17. I did't write two more chapters, just while I was reading the whole thing over, I realized some chapters worked better split in two.
Little warning, there is some brief gendered verbal assault and aborted physical assault in this chapter. It's really not bad and over in a blink of an eye, but I'd hate to catch anyone off guard who might be sensitive to such issues
“Even if I wasn’t with Alec, and Amanda wasn’t my friend, I’d never want to go out with him. He actually said that it doesn’t matter that I’m mousy, because his ‘elephant isn’t afraid of mice.’ Was I meant to be charmed by that?”
“Right,” John continued once the clapping stopped, “with that all said, a town car and wedded bliss await, so Sherlock and I are going to head out. Thank you all again. Truly, thank you.”
“An elf?” Sherlock looked taken aback. “How am I an elf?”
“I mean, I don’t think he’ll hit on you or try to ask you out.”
“No!” Sherlock shook his head, coming back to himself and quickly turning in John’s arms. “No, it wasn’t said in the heat of the moment, I meant it. Do you… do you really love me too?”
“You have no idea.” John mumbled, kissing along Sherlock’s jaw and back to his lips. “No idea.”
“Ok, maybe I didn’t want you getting a big head or anything. I didn’t want you to think you could convince me to do things I initially didn’t want to do.”
“Is that your real name?”
medical expertise. Maybe I’ll go to the crime scene and not say a word. I’ll just sit back and watch you work”
“Of course not, no,” Sherlock shook his head. “I’m just shocked I didn’t noticed it before. But now that I think back, it’s glaringly obvious.”
The bread was hard and stale, the meat was rubbery, but John ate it anyway. His watch read seven forty, and based on how hungry he was, John guessed pm.
John raised his eyebrows. “Again? Aren’t you going to be sore?” He asked. Not that he was adverse to the idea; he just didn’t think Sherlock would be up for it so soon.
“And if we get stopped? You know we’re bound to get stopped.”
text the day before. After listening calmly and trying to reassure John that Sherlock had pulled through worse, Lestrade updated John on the investigation. They had the man who’d stabbed Sherlock, in custody, having apprehended him shortly after the incident. Apparently he had been ‘so shaken by what had happened’ – the bastard had the gall to try and play a victim – that he went into a pub not too far from the crime scene, and the owner called the police. He still had the knife covered in Sherlock’s blood, he still had Sherlock’s blood on him, he didn’t even try to deny it when questioned. If it weren’t for the fact that John needed to stay with Sherlock, he would have been down at the Yard then and there. He wanted ten minutes alone with the son of a bitch, he wanted to make him suffer.
“What?”
“Why is it that I’m always the one carrying you?” John asked breathlessly, still holding Sherlock tight. “You’re nearly a foot taller than me.”
“About fucking time we met Mr. Thursday Night!” Jason Zardari – captain and attacking midfielder – could be heard yelling over the sudden explosion of whoops and hollers from the table.
“You have so much faith in me, John. How?” Sherlock asked, baffled. He could live a thousand years, and still never understand John’s faith in him.
he thought.
“I’m glad to hear it. I must say, you look good, you have more color, and you’re looking more relaxed. Are you sleeping better?”
“Well, he’s pretty cute, so you could definitely do worse.” Heather said with a laughed. “Right… sorry, I should really get off this subject.”
“Oh, is there anything I can do for you? Do you want me to page the nurse to get you something?” John sounded genuinely concerned. Odd.
“Need a little help?” John chuckled; running his hands up Sherlock’s clothed thighs, his own pants tragically still in place.
“And put the kettle on, my tea’s gone cold, I need a fresh cup,” came Sherlock’s voice again.
The distance between them is too great for John, and he wraps his arms around Sherlock’s back pulling him down onto him. At the first touch of Sherlock’s hard cock against his own, John lets out a whine he will later never admit too, every inch of skin feels like it’s on fire. Needing the friction, John’s hands move down Sherlock’s back to grip his ass, and knead the soft flesh, pulling Sherlock tighter against himself. Letting out moans that go straight to John’s cock, Sherlock begins to thrust. The slide of Sherlock against him is like nothing he’s ever felt before, and John starts to push back against him, meeting his movements with equal intensity. “Oh Christ!” John whimpers, as Sherlock begins to suck on the side of his neck just below his jaw.
“That shouldn’t be an issue.” If all the furniture was pushed against the walls, his sitting room should be large enough. Maybe if he offered to reimburse her, he could persuade Mrs. Hudson to hire someone to do it before he returned.
“Oh in that case, please don’t go around kissing just anyone.”
“And that constitutes a romantic relationship?” Sherlock said flatly. “And here I was thinking I’d just made a friend. I can have friends you know.”
“Man you’re fussy when you’re bored.” John snickered. “I added extra hours because it’s almost Christmas, and revision week is next week, then it’s finals. People might show up and have questions.”
“I didn’t.” Sherlock grumbled, turning to face the back of the couch. “I thought she was your brother. I got it wrong, no need to rub it in.”
“I’m fine. No, really, I am. I’m just… I’m just thinking. Processing.”
“An interested party.”
“Sister!” Sherlock groaned. “Harry’s your sister! There’s always something I miss!”
“Not that big of a deal? You don’t see why I was worried? YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED! If I were even a few seconds slower, you could have been dead!” John says, visibly shaking.
“No one, you didn’t see who dropped it?” Sherlock asked, leaning across the table. “Think! Was anyone watching you, did anyone seem interested in you or the trash? Was there anything out of the ordinary?”
“Says the man who knows about the eating patterns of hobbits, and just said ‘Tolkinian’ and ‘Middle Earth’ in the last thirty seconds.”
“Oh dear God, another one!?” The checkered button down shirt, the chino trousers, it was like they all wore damn uniform. “How many of you people are they going to send to inspect me?”
*******
“Good. Now, I could use a shower. You don’t mind, do you?”
“Yeah!” John grinned. “But wait, won’t I get in the way? I don’t want to get in your way.”
“Sherlock’s lucky to have someone who cares about him like you do.” Dr. Drier smiled, patting John on the shoulder. Sherlock would have been a whole hell of a lot luckier of John had done a better job of actually caring for him. He wanted to kick himself, he should be the one with fractures ribs, covered in bruises.
“Yeah, well I probably wouldn’t have met you if I wasn’t a TA, so I think a little bit of tedium is worth it.”
“Glaringly obvious, huh?”
There had been a question weighing on Sherlock’s mind since nearly the beginning of their acquaintance. He had held back for fear of driving John away, but they had settled into their living arrangements, John seemed content, and if he hadn’t packed it in after what had just happened, maybe it was safe to ask. And John had sort of opened the door himself after all.
Hey Hey! Ho Ho!... I can't think of a rhyme to go here. Maybe you can think of something, why don't you pop it down in the comments along with your thoughts or any corrections! *wink*
“I’m just being honest. What’s the point of humility if you’re not going to tell the truth?”
“Well, as long as it makes you less ‘hurty’, that’s all I care about.”
couldn't
“It will.” Said Sherlock firmly, cupping John’s cheeks, his fingers moving back to comb through the tangle of John’s shaggy blond hair. John had to believe it would work, his confidence and faith in Sherlock was the only thing keeping Sherlock going. If this plan was going to work, if John was to be safe, they couldn’t go into it expecting failure.
“Is that all?” John asked cautiously.
“No, no. Nothing like that, no. Molly Hooper – you’ve met her – her uncle works pathology at Bart’s. Sometimes he lets me use the lab there, look at samples and other things.” Best not mention the dead bodies and body parts just yet.
“Exactly, so…”
“Ten’s – ten’s good. Ok.” Sherlock nodded, a hesitant smile on his face.
“The rest of the world?”
“What do you mean? Weren’t you listening? John left, he ran away.”
“And does everyone who looks at you approach you.” John said, gaining a bit of confidence, he obviously hadn’t creeped Sherlock out too much.
“Hey, you’re in Dr. Kiernan’s Principles of Metabolic Biochem class, right? You’re name’s Sherlock, isn’t it?” He knew he recognized him, he was the one constantly correcting the professor, and whose assignments could rival the work of a Nobel Laureate. He was not the kind of person John easily forgot.
“So does that mean you’ll…”
“There’s nothing to deny. There is no ‘we’, no ‘us’. You mean nothing to me.” Sherlock’s words cold and cruel as he pulls himself out of John’s grasp “Have fun serving Queen and Country, don’t get shot. Or do, I don’t give a fuck.” And with that, Sherlock storms out, but not before John sees tears start to form in his eyes.
“There’s no need to lie to me, Sherlock,” Theo chuckled, leaning back in his chair. “You honestly expect me to believe that you’ve managed to snag yourself a boyfriend, whilst sober, with nothing to even you out, with nothing to… mute you, make you tolerable?”
“Alright Sherlock, there’s no need to be rude.” His father warned him. “I don’t want to tell you how to do your job, Constable,” Sherlock snorted at this, but Mr. Holmes continued, “but perhaps it would be best for the note to be analyzed by trained handwriting expert, if only to be absolutely sure.”
Just a heads up, with my typical every other day posting schedule, I'm due to post Chapter 4 on Monday, but I'll be going out of the country that day and going to be gone until the end of the month. That said, I will be bringing my computer with me, and the place I'm staying has wifi. I'm going to try to keep posting regularly, but please forgive me if it gets wonky once or twice.
“If you’re sure…”
Sherlock on bed rest was a nightmare, an absolute, living, breathing, whining nightmare. By early Monday evening, John was seriously considering calling up Dr. Drier and getting another dose of whatever they drugged Sherlock with at the hospital. At least that way he’d be a bit more relaxed, and less argumentative. At the rate things were going, John was going to be completely grey by twenty-five.
“So John, how have you been since last week?” Ella asked, pen and paper in hand, starting off the session.
doesn't
“We are, and I am.” John said, and with his free hand cupped the back of Sherlock’s head, kissing him slowly and more soundly than before. “I am totally and completely, one hundred percent yours. I’d say I’m one hundred and fifty or two hundred percent, but I know how you feel about mathematical impossibilities.”
~***~
“Really? You’ll take my name, and I can take yours?”
“You’re a very strange man, John Watson.” Sherlock says, shaking his head almost in disbelief.
knew that, but
“Tomorrow at eleven? You mean when you go to your PT appointment?”
“Me too.” John panted. “Touch yourself… I want to see… I want to see you pulling yourself off with me buried deep inside you.”
“Back. Come back” Sherlock wined, desperately trying to follow John’s lips, to continue what John started and then cruelly cute short.
“Alright, yeah I can see why someone would be a bit tetchy about that,” John nodded, “but that’s no excuse for attacking you!”
“You should start feeling the effects in about twenty minutes or so.”
– please, John.” Sherlock whimpered, rolling his hips.
isn't
“Alright Sherlock, assuming you’re correct about this,” Lestrade piped up, “how do you know Emily is involved?”
“What are you doing here, Sherlock?” John asked once he’d finally found his voice again.
, whatever
“I didn’t hate spending the day with him.” Sherlock admitted, quietly. If he were being honest with himself – and if he couldn’t with himself, than who could he be – that Saturday was one of the best days he’d had in recent memory, and there wasn’t even a dead body or criminal involved.
John could feel him smiling. “Perfect.” He finished.
“It’s very clear that you two get along.” Mrs. Hudson smiled. “But that’s not what I meant. I meant that Sherlock’s always been alone, and he’ll deny it until his last breath, but he’s always been so lonely. He retreats into that mad brain of his like a protective cocoon, and having you here, having a… friend here, I think it will keep him from getting lost. I don’t want you to feel like I’m putting too much responsibility on your shoulders,” she added hastily, “but I can already tell that you’re good for him.”
“Why haven’t you?” Sherlock asked, that confused frown, that
Even if it was the smaller room, the upstairs bedroom more than worked for John. There was a full sized bed flanked by two bedside tables, a large wardrobe, an empty bookshelf, a decent sized desk, and a large window overlooking Baker Street.
Sherlock was honestly a hit with the group. John was just relieved the conversation had shifted away from all the teasing and innuendo. Mike ‘let slip’ that Sherlock sometimes worked with the police – often dragging John along with him – which led to John being called all manner of names for not telling the team about it, followed by Sherlock and him recounting some of their more interesting cases. That of course led to Sherlock describing his methods, which eventually turned into him deducing members of the team. By some miracle he managed to hold his tongue and didn’t broadcast anything too personal. Though at one point he did reveal that, not only was Jason thinking about proposing to his girlfriend – thankfully she was in the bathroom when that happened – but also that she would most likely say yes. He did however advise Jason to wait until Ashley began her apprenticeship as a solicitor before ‘popping the question.’
“It’s just a formality, school policy.” John said, trying to keep his voice calm and reassuring, as he watched Sherlock walk back and forth. “The school won’t dole out punishment without a hearing. It’s going to be just fine.”
“Is short for Harriet,” John finished, “my sister.”
“John?” He called again a little louder, winching at the pain in his chest, which he found was bound. Ah, he must have cracked ribs, or they’d at least been severely bruised.
"Nothing, it’s just,” John paused, “there is no way you’re one of those ‘stop being selfish, you have to pick a side, men or women’ people.”
The case wasn’t even a four, barely worth Sherlock’s time, but it worked, it got his mind off of John. Instead of returning to Baker Street as he usually did after a case, Sherlock followed Lestrade back to Scotland Yard; certainly he could find something for him to look into if Sherlock was there to bug him in person. He did not, and Sherlock was forced to return to Baker Street, and unwanted thoughts.
As Sherlock ate, John filled him in on everything he had missed from the hospital until he recently woke up. His deductions were correct; he had two cracked ribs, in addition to the extensive bruising, sprained wrist, and swollen knee and ankle. He had also apparently gifted the A&E doctor with a rather unfortunate nickname that John found rather amusing – though he tried to deny it. There was more John wasn’t saying, that much was obvious, but Sherlock wasn’t going to let it bother him, he’d figure it out in due time. At the moment, Sherlock was just going to enjoy sitting with John, listening to him talk.
“This is going to be the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done, isn’t it?”
The guests quickly stood by their seats, and the music started playing. Sherlock had composed and recorded the song himself specifically for them to walk down the aisle to. John thought it was the most beautiful song he’d ever heard, breathtakingly gorgeous, just like the man who wrote it.
The show John was a little too interested in was meant to be 'To the Ends of the Earth' which started Benedict Cumberbatch. And this is the part he REALLY liked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_fgKk1CM-0
Whitney’s hands start to move down John’s chest, working at the buttons of his shirt.
“What? Oh, no.” Actually, it did smart a bit, but clearly this DI was more than just lead investigator. John didn’t want to pile anything on him at the moment. “No, I’m fine, Detective. Really.”
“Well, you two live together don’t you?” Sherlock nodded. “Right, and then he always sits and waits for you. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed.”
trust issues?!” That was ridiculous. Sure John wasn’t the most open person, but that had nothing to do with what happened between him and Sherlock.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped to John’s face, his brow furrowed. “For what? You did nothing wrong.”
yes” breathed Sherlock. His eyes screwed shut, his mouth slack, Sherlock rolled his hips, a small cry escaping. John had never seen anything more beautiful, more captivating than Sherlock in the beginning stages of pleasure; pleasure that John was giving him.
“Anything I want?” John could have sworn he saw a flash of
~***~
“And what is that?”
“Ah, John. Excellent. Is Lestrade far behind you? I need some handcuffs.”
“How about last week when you told me those chemicals you were playing with were completely harmless, and now there’s a six-inch scorch mark on the kitchen ceiling?”
They are both still beaming when Angelo stops by again to see if they want any dessert. Both decline, and they leave, John stopping to thank Angelo for everything. Angelo just waves him off, “Anything for Sherlock and his
I'll probably delete this after a few days
“NO! John, wake up! Please wake up!... HELP! WE’RE DOWN HERE! ANYBODY! HELP! HELP US!” Sherlock’s voice was already cracking, his weakened state, and the dehydration taking their toll.
“Too right you aren’t!” the Voice snarled. “But Sherlock seems to think you are, so why does he keep you around? What do you
(Side note: Since learning Sherlock has a "normal" first name, I always wondered if Mycroft does too. So of course I thought it would be hilarious if he real first name was Michael, which makes Mrs. Holmes calling him 'Myc' even better.)
“Yes, John –
It may not have been a date, but that didn’t mean Sherlock couldn’t still put his best foot forward.
“… sure… hoped….”
, no trace was found whatsoever, and nothing in the skip produced anything. They weren’t even able to determine when the laptop was dumped.
Sherlock watched as John perused the menu, his brow slightly furrowed in concentration, one side of his lower lip caught between his teeth. Why a list of broth, meat, and vegetable options required so much deliberation, Sherlock wasn’t sure, but he never really did care much about what he ate, so what did he know? The restaurant was family-style anyway, whatever John chose, he would be eating too. Sherlock was more than content just watching and waiting on John to make his final selections.
In John’s opinion, the second self-defense lesson was going even better than the first. About halfway through, John decided to switch from practicing blocks, to teaching Sherlock some basic ways to escape grips. As with almost everything John observed of Sherlock – not that he made it a point of observing Sherlock in or out of class, Sherlock just called attention to himself – Sherlock picked up the escape techniques almost immediately. There was really only one he didn’t master after four or five tries.
“Yeah, and John didn’t put all that work and effort into it just so you could stand there and gape at him.” Lestrades voice cut in, and suddenly Sherlock remembered that they weren’t alone. They were in the middle of the busy Met headquarters, with countless police officers, Lestrade, and even worse, Donovan and Anderson looking on.
“Why is he still not awake? What’s wrong? Shouldn’t he be awake by now?” Asked Sherlock, who was on his feet and by John’s side in a matter of seconds; his eyes locked on John’s face.
“Oh really? Well, in that case, why don’t I buy you a drink and then maybe we can go somewhere a bit quieter? I think there are some tables near the back.”
He then proceeded to kiss along John’s right hip, nosing along the crease where thigh met groin, before switching sides to give the left hip the same treatment.
“Who cares how long we’ve known each other. When you know, you know.” John shrugged.
He was falling.
Not beta'd, not brit-picked. I edited as best I could, but I'm just one small woman trying to make her way in the world.
“It’s nothing tragic, don’t worry. Actually, it’s so clichéd I’m pretty sure it’s happened on multiple Soaps. Came home on leave a day early, you know, thought I’d surprise her; found her in bed with her ex.” John tried for nonchalance, and just missed. “She actually had the nerve to blame it on me.”
“True,” John murmured, and added two more eggs to the frying pan.
“Yeah, right on all counts.” John’s reply came out far more curt than he had intended, or perhaps not.
“Oh… Are you and… you and Tom ok?”
The cold cases actually managed to help to an extent. The lack of fresh evidence added a bit of a challenge, and while tucked away in an unused conference room, Sherlock focused solely on the files in front of him, driving thoughts of John Watson almost completely from his head. It wasn’t a perfect solution of course, as he would find himself thinking, ‘
His hair was an absolute disaster, stick up at all angles, his cheeks were flushed pink, and his eyes, dear god, his eyes. Sherlock wasn’t sure how, but John’s eyes actually seemed to get deeper and bluer the longer he stared at them. John – like this – was nothing short of breathtaking.
“How?” Sherlock asked. “I’m assuming you never suggested it be an open relationship.”
“Right, so look at it from his standpoint.” Sarah said softly. “You’ve never really had a relationship, but you meet someone and start to feel something for him. It’s new, it’s unfamiliar, but you’re giving it a shot, when suddenly you see this questionable looking text. Think about it John, he was confused enough as it was, and so he panicked, he sabotaged himself.”
Of course he was going to be fine, I wouldn't do anything like that so close to the end of a fic. I'm not a monster. There just needed to be a bit of terror to give John the kick in the ass he needed.
Sherlock gasped at the first brush of John’s lips down his chest, the first touch of John’s fingers between his legs; each time together was like the first time all over again. By now they knew each other’s bodies better than they knew their own, but still, that first slide of John’s skin against his, that first press of fingers, sent shivers through Sherlock. Sherlock knew exactly what it felt like to have John slowly open him up, one finger at a time. He knew what was like to have John kiss away the groans and cries as his body was stretched. He knew what it was like to wrap his legs around John’s waist, to hear John whisper “I love you. I love you, Sherlock. I love you” in his ear, to feel John slide into his body over and over again. He knew what it felt like to have John fill him, he knew the way John ignited every nerve, and unlocked unheard-of levels of sensation and pleasure. Sherlock knew what it was like to make love to John Watson, but just like the night of their first proper date, when afterwards John guided them to
“Hmmm?” John said, looking down at where Sherlock was pointing to a row of thin metal bands.
’, which would just cause John to flood his every thought, for twice, three, four times as long as he went John free.
“What else happened?” John asked, he could tell by Dr. Cook’s tone and language that there was something she wasn’t telling him. His nightmare wasn’t over yet.
“Then he’ll end it.” Sherlock breathed. “But I want every day with him that he’ll give me.” He added, looking directly into John’s eyes.
John confronts Sherlock, and Sherlock desperately tries to explain.
“Iwannahyphenate!”
It’s the last day of spring, and the evening is clear and warm, so once dinner is finished, they opt to walk back to Baker Street, instead of taking a cab. As they cross the street after leaving the restaurant, Whitney’s hand slips into John’s, and remains there for the rest of their walk. John can’t help but smile at the feel of Whitney’s slim, elegant hand in his, fitting almost perfectly, feeling almost as if it was made to be there.
“So, how long have you two been together?” Leah asked as she finished up her check on Sherlock. After the scare, his vitals appeared to have leveled out, and the beeping of his monitors returned to their regular, steady pattern.
“Ah, but do you want to shake him?” Lestrade asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What!?” Sherlock’s head snapped up to look over at John who was sitting on the couch. Wait, when had John sat down? When had either of them sat down? Wasn’t he been standing a moment ago? Yes, he had just been standing in the middle of the sitting room when John came in and gave him the first two minutes kiss; John had said something about leftovers, and then that thing about Mrs. Hudson and her sister, and then…
“Don’t get me wrong, John, I am more than eager to get back to our room and get you out of those clothes. I rather wanted you out of them before dinner, but you insisted we eat.”
Sherlock smiled back. “Then no, you’re not a suspect in anything.”
*******
“Either you’re telling the truth, or you’re becoming a better liar.”
“Hmmm,
“He woke up.” Leah smiled. “And he’ll probably be waking up again pretty soon. I’ll be in to check on him again in a little bit, then I’m afraid you’re stuck with Nurse Carlton for the night again.”
Sherlock had only made it to the second step before it all came tumbling down, quite literally. Trying to maneuver stairs on crutches with one’s hands full was obviously never going to work. The bottle he’d been holding slipped from his grasp, and in his attempt to catch it, Sherlock dropped one crutch, lost his balance, and crashed against the wall. He was able to half catch himself, but ended up on the ground all the same. That’s how John found him when he came bursting out of his room not three seconds later, on the ground at the bottom of the steps, surrounded by scattered biscuits, broken glass, and spilt beer.
“Whatever. You went from that, to suddenly spending evenings with Sherlock, getting… sweaty. And now you’re having cozy little afternoons in the school library. What might we be expecting next?”
With a wicked chuckle, Sherlock finally released John, and breaking their gaze, turned to a now awkward and slightly embarrassed looking Lestrade. “Should anything come up and you need us for something, Lestrade, don’t even think about calling or texting. We’ll stop by your office sometime tomorrow, you can tell us then.” He said, before reaching into Lestrade’s coat pocket and pulling out a set of keys. “And don’t bother stopping in when you come by to pick up the car.”
“It’s quite alright, Miss Riley.” Lestrade said in an attempt to calm Imogen down.
“It’s very different on the other side of things, Dr. Watson. When the patient is a loved one, we often forget what we know as doctors.”
“I know you’re insanely smart, and class is never boring with you challenging everything Kiernan says.” John laughed. “Plus I do all the grading; I’m the one reading what you write in the margins of your assignments and quizzes.”
The decision is made, now can John and Sherlock finally move on?
“I have a spotless driving record, and you know it!” Sherlock growled.
“How… how do you know about that?” he asked, his words coming out far too shaky for his liking. “Did Mycroft tell you?” How dare he. It was not his secret to tell, it was not his past to divulge. The next time he saw Mycroft, he was going to kill him. He was at least informing Mummy, that much was certain.
“Do you really mean that? You’d really like to be part of an investigation?”
“I’m glad I could help.” John chuckled. “I’d do it again in a heartbeat.”
” Sherlock whimpered when John’s teeth grazed the skin just below his ear. It felt so good; so good. “I need –
“Wonderful.” Sherlock groaned, keeping his tone flat.
“Yes. Yes I see them.”
“It’s going to work.” Sherlock said, collapsing next to John on the mattress; more to reassure himself than anything else.
“Do you want to do it face to face now? I mean,” John laughed self-consciously, “do you want to learn how to deal with an attack from the front now?” John’s voice sounded a bit huskier, a bit more on edge. Fantastic, Sherlock had managed to make him uncomfortable with his botched escape attempts. But was it really Sherlock’s fault that attack was so… intimate? Maybe he could have tried harder to escape quicker, but it felt… No, Sherlock was still learning, he couldn’t be expected to be perfect.
And dammit, if Sherlock’s stomach give a jolt and immediately tie itself into a knot. It wasn’t that he was happy to see Theo, quite the opposite. No, it was that he was immediately – and unwantedly – reminded of the unsure man he had been what felt like a lifetime ago, so desperate for Theo’s approval. He was reminded of everything he had done to gain that approval, what it had done to him, the path it had started him on, and even then, it wasn’t enough. He didn’t want to be that man anymore, and he wasn’t. He had his life together, had everything he ever wanted and more, but with his former acquaintance – Sherlock saw now that Theo never deserved the title of friend – looking at him, Sherlock felt small and used all over again.
“Night. Oh and Sherlock?” John said, stopping Sherlock before he could walk away. “You did great in there, we’re off to a fantastic start.”
“Well a missing persons report was filed, so we have to investigate.”
Dr. Cook led John through several hallways before coming to a stop in front of a room, the shades drawn and the door closed.
“Ugh,” Sherlock groaned burying his face in John’s neck. “Don’t say that too loud, Mycroft will hear you and take it as a personal challenge.” Meddlesome arse had his little bugs everywhere.
Now that he was getting to know who Sherlock really was, he hated the very idea that someone – anyone – would lay a finger on him. He wasn’t an idiot, John spotted the new scrapes and bruises, he knew Sherlock’s harassers were still at it. He would just have to redouble his efforts, he just had to make sure Sherlock knew enough that he could avoid anything and everything they tried to do. Actually, he wished Sherlock would just give him their names, so he could stop them once and for all.
“The problem,” John said, cupping Sherlock’s cheek, “is that there’s definitely something on your mind, and it’s not making me tea, or us making love. Come on Bumblebee, tell me what’s going on up there?” he asked, brushing the curls away from Sherlock’s temple.
Well, fifteen minutes wasn’t too long of a wait, and the café where Sherlock was currently sat was fairly quiet, plus there were the free refills. He could probably go through his inbox and solve a fair few easy cases before John got there – about eighty-three percent of the cases sent in he was able to solve at a glance – and that way, he could earn himself some of John’s praise. Funny how even after all their time together, John still seemed to be impressed by Sherlock’s deductions. And even more interesting, Sherlock had yet to grow used to John’s praise, the blush still spreading across his cheeks, and his stomach still fluttering with every ‘amazing.’
“It’s happened before, Bumblebee.” John shrugged.
“I don’t see why, we’ve carried on perfectly well without him.” Sally grumbled. “And you have to admit, Boss, these past few months have been so peaceful.”
They had the photos, Lestrade was onboard, they had a report from the hospital and Sherlock’s medical records. Both Molly and Malcolm had even given statements, and agreed, if needed, to testify as witnesses to Sebastian’s ongoing harassment of Sherlock. Everything was almost set, they were almost ready, which lead Sherlock to the one thing he’d been dreading, the one thing that made him want to abandon the whole idea: meeting with Mycroft.
Even though he knew Sherlock wasn’t looking, that didn’t stop John from rolling his eyes as he bit back a laugh.
Enjoy!
“I appreciate that very much. And did Sherlock explain to you what he was doing at the school?” Mr. Holmes asked, looking down to give Sherlock a small reassuring smile.
“Well, it was touch and go for a bit there, but we were able to get a handle on the bleeding, repair most of the damage, and managed to stabilize him.” Stable, Sherlock was stable. He survived. John felt as though his heart restarted.
“God I hope you’re right.” Sarah smiled. “So, do you have any plans for the weekend? Doing anything fun for the holiday?”
Sherlock, however, was quick to tell him not to put any stock into her words, since Mrs. Hudson loved to cook, and was always bringing up food.
“I’m absolutely perfect, never felt better. Though I do have a rather annoying pain in my arse. I think if you give me my test back, it’ll go away.”
“Right. Still, not something you want to be dealing with after the day you’ve had, I’ll bet,” chuckled Lestrade. “Listen, I’m sure I can arrange for one of my officers to give you a ride home. It’s really the least we can do after everything you’ve been through, everything you’ve done.”
Relief washed over him, Sherlock felt like he could finally breathe again. “When can I see him? I want to see him.”
Life goes on for John, if you can call it that.
“That’s cool. I like it. I wish I had a cool middle name like Sherlock. I hate mine.”
Pulling back from the kiss as far as he could given the limited space against the wall, John saw that all earlier bravado and fiery intensity was gone from Sherlock’s face, the Sherlock before him now stood with his eyes screwed shut, breathing heavily, and his cheeks streaked wet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I probably read it,” Sherlock shrugged, “I’m smart, I remember things.”
Sherlock gave into the grin tugging on the corner of his mouth, letting it spread across his face. “It was foolish of you to even try.”
“You’re welcome.” John smiled, he really did have a lovely smile. “Now get some sleep. I’ll see you in the morning.”
No sooner was Sherlock through the front door of his house, than he found himself enveloped in his mother’s arms. Once she had finished her lecture, peppered with concern and worry, Sherlock and his father got to explaining everything that happened, from Sherlock’s search, to the note and the police station.
“Before they get here, I want to tell you, I lo-” But before John could finish his sentence, the nurse hurried in and began checking John. Sherlock was thankful he wasn’t the one hooked up to a heart monitor, as he was pretty sure it would have spiked, or possibly flat-lined, at that moment.
“Yeah, with an older couple. They ended up adopting her, but yeah.” Mrs. Rachlin said quietly, still sounding stunned.
~***~
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel… uncomfortable with.” The man smirked. “Just tell me what he’s up to.”
It took a few moments for John to locate his clothes; he didn’t pay all that much attention to where they fell the night before.
“Constable with Scotland Yard, he sometimes calls whe –” But Sherlock stopped talking, his eyes wide as if he’d just said something he wasn’t supposed to.
He was almost out the door when a thought struck him, maybe… It was worth at least asking, what was the harm in asking?
“And don’t expect me to,” she smiled, “I’m doing this just the once to welcome you. Remember, I’m your landlady, not your housekeeper.”
“You are aware this is a form of extortion, aren’t you, John?”
“I meant it wasn’t
“You too, dear.”
“Miss. Sissons is so much better,” John continued, glancing up at where she was writing on the whiteboard. “My sister, Harry, had her two years ago. She said on the last day of every month, Miss. Sissons brings in cupcakes for the whole class to celebrate that month’s birthdays.”
Sherlock bit his lip as John slowly pushed into him. He was far bigger than three fingers, and Sherlock could feel himself stretch around John’s glans.
“So don’t be.” He did honestly love Mrs. Hudson, but Sherlock was really not in the mood. Well, not in the mood to be talking to his landlady.
“You,” Sherlock said, pulling them both up to standing, “are just going to have to join me to find out.”
“Oh he can try, but he won’t succeed.” John laughed. “If you’re listen Mycroft, your brother is all mine now whether you like it or not! Lock me in irons, because I’m never giving him up!”
It had been an hour since Sherlock had been taken back to see a doctor – the A&E was blessedly uncrowded so he was taken almost immediately after John helped him through the door – and John was left sat in the waiting room with nothing to do but dwell on Sherlock’s condition. It took his breath away, it physically pained him, when he opened Sherlock’s door to see him like that. It took everything within him not to cry. Sherlock was lying on his bed; he still wore the track bottoms and John’s borrowed sweatshirt from the night before, which were now covered in dirt and something that looked very much like dried blood. His face was a mass of bruises, his left eye almost swollen shut, and those lips that only twelve hours before John had been worshiping, were split and bloodied. Sherlock’s hands showed signs of defensive injuries, and the way he struggled to move and winced while breathing, John could only imagine what other damage was being hidden underneath clothing. John felt absolutely sick. He had to do something, he had to make everything right. Whether Sherlock wanted him to or not, John was going to make those three bastards pay for what they’d done, but that could wait. For now, John had to be there for Sherlock, he had to make sure he was going to be alright. Sherlock had to be alright. If anything happened to Sherlock, if he…
“Oh, Sherlock! You’re actually home!”
Christ, John needed to get a hold of himself, he really didn’t need Mike coming out to investigate. “Please listen to me Sherlock, they can’t be allowed to get away with this. I don’t even want to think about what could happen next time.”
Sherlock let out a private sigh of relief as he watched John dig through the cabinets, pulling out various pans and dishes. He hadn’t driven him away.
That fact was not all that surprising. As disinterested as Sherlock was in the personal relationships of his peers, it did not escape his notice that Eddie Van Coon fashioned himself the campus Casanova, and had been stringing along his Maths tutor, Amanda Richardson, for the better part of last semester.
“Any fun you may have thought I experienced during our acquaintance, was simply a result of me being under the influence. With the amount of illicit substances with which you plied me, I would have found a nail being driven through my foot, fun.” Sherlock snapped. Oh, it felt so good to get everything off his chest. For years, Theo’s final words to him followed him around, made him question himself and doubt himself. It took three stints in rehab, two relapses, and an overdose, to finally get clean. And it took one utterly
It took Sherlock a moment to realize he hadn’t answered, he was too busy stopping himself from tracing the faint creases that formed along John’s forehead.
And now I can say that the last chapter and epilogue is nothing but fluff, fluff, and more fluff!! Or maybe I'll make them come down, realize they don't like each other like that, and never want to see each other again.... Nah, it's fluff.
“Nothing would make me happier. And really, who else would you possibly go with?” Sherlock smirked, before gently pulling John’s face up to his, and kissing him… and again… and again.
Sherlock smirked. “I knew you would,” he tried to look smug, but it was obvious he was relieved.
“And sleep? Is just a few hours really so much to hope for?”
"No.” Harry grumbled. “Why you asking me, aren’t you, like, always with him?”
“Funny.” Molly said flatly, rolling her eyes. “Seriously Sherlock, what’s going on?”
“Fine,” he said, “I’ll forgive your
“Yes, John, we do. I need to apologize.”
“Of course it was.” Sherlock groaned, why couldn’t see just see it like he could. “But they have to show up at some point. They didn’t just appear and disappear on the spot. They were hiding it somehow, I’d have seen the container, so maybe under a jacket or in a bag. We look for anyone who passed through the blind spot.”
“What the hell were you thinking, running off on your own like that? He could have been armed for all we knew.”
Once again, comments, corrections, and critiques are always welcome!
“Ah, pop music.”
“He’s probably just gone for a coffee. We can just wait here, I’m sure he won’t mind.” Molly said, taking a seat on one of the threadbare chairs. Sherlock didn’t have time to wait, and instead left the office, and walked across the hall to the mortuary.
“Maybe I’m kind of strange too.” John grinned and shook his head, before sobering a little. “Seriously though, Sherlock, who did I meet?”
Yep, Sherlock was definitely an overexcited toddler.
“Can I… can I ask what it was?” John said quietly. “Don’t feel you have to tell me.”
John was gone, John was gone and Sherlock couldn’t go on, he had nothing left. Oh god. Oh god. Please, god. John.
owed him a favor. At least the string quartet plays wasn’t the
“And a gentleman too,” Mrs. Holmes smiled. “I’m so lucky Sherlock found you.”
"And do you know if there’s anyone else in the building?”
“Better, right.” Trust John to find the silver lining.
doesn't
“I will keep that in mind. May we begin the session now?”
John shook his head and chuckled to himself as the door buzzed and he pulled it open with his one semi-free hand. Over a year of ‘one hundred percent in’ with Sherlock and he was still utterly charmed by the ridiculous man, completely besotted with him.
“But he has a flat face!” Sherlock frowned, looking up to see the man himself standing by the curtain. “Dr. Flat-Face, look! This is my John! The John I was telling you about!”
With tea in hand – reheated and transferred from ceramic mugs to paper cups – and heading for the door, Sherlock slipped one hand into his jacket to run his finger along the small velvet box he had been carrying around in a hidden pocket for the past week.
And the moment was broken, lost.
He didn’t know how long they sat there on the mortuary floor, Molly hugging him as tears of relief ran down his face, a poor unfortunate John Doe lying above them, because the next thing he knew, Sherlock heard the door swing open.
“One, because your mother asked you nicely.” Oh wonderful, his daddy was there too. “Two, because we need to talk about this. And three, you know the rules of this house, locked doors mean no doors.”
“You can, but you absolutely will not.” Mrs. Holmes said, her voice stern. “I wouldn’t feel right leaving you alone at a time like this. I’ll cancel the entire week if need be,
“You’re due for another two pills at about one. I’ll leave them right here, so if the pain wakes you up, don’t hesitate to take them. And call me if you need anything or need to get up.”
“That’s good to know. But no, like I told the guys when they were taking the piss at roll call this morning, why would I pass up an opportunity to ride in a brand new F-Type, for three hours on a coach with those smelly bastards?”
“Tell me if I’m wrong. Tell me if I’m doing something wrong.” He breathed, cupping John’s face in his hands, and leaning down until their mouths were only inches apart.
Friday came and went, Saturday followed – far too slowly for Sherlock’s liking – and soon it was late Sunday morning when Sherlock strolled up to John Watson at the study carrels on the first floor of the library. It was five after ten to be exact – five minutes was long enough to show he wasn’t too eager.
I'm such a sucker for loving, supportive, comforting Holmes parents.
“What kind of influence?”
“Alright,” Sherlock continued once the clapping had subsided, “I think I’ve talked enough. Now, I believe I owe my new husband a dance.”
“So get –
“Would I lie to my own child?” Mrs. Holmes gasped, feigning shock.
– passed in near absolute silence. The closer they got to Baker Street, the tenser John felt, not knowing exactly what was going to happen, what he was going to say, what he was going to do, when they finally reached the flat. It didn’t help matters that when they arrived and Sherlock parked – miraculously there was a spot right in front of their door – he was out of the car and into the building before John had even opened his door.
“That was…” John swallowed once he’d regained his breath, and his senses had finally returned. His body felt loose, relaxed… he felt amazing.
“You smell fine. Better than fine.” Sherlock buried his nose in John’s neck. “You smell amazing. You taste amazing,” he added, nipping at the skin under John’s jaw.
“Well I figured you weren’t here to see Mr. Banarji.” John said when a thought suddenly struck him. “Wait, there wasn’t some crime was there? I’m not a suspect am I?”
World crumbling at his feet, Sherlock tries to get answers
“There were mentions of a ‘J’ in some of his diaries, but the family could never figure out who ‘J’ was.” Sherlock said quietly.
Subject: Re: Hypoxia Project
“Yeah, other than then. But what kind of friend would I be if I abandoned my post now? Besides, you’ve had no shortage of attention all night, and you’ve brushed them all off.”
“I told you I’m fine. I said only he tried to grab me.” Sherlock grinned. “But I did that thing you showed me. I spun out of the hold, and used the momentum against him. He didn’t know what happened, one minute he had me by the wrist, and the next he was being slammed face first into the wall.”
“Oh, I’m sorry. That’s… That’s too bad.” Lestrade said, as if he were trying to sound supportive.
“What, that you’re exceptionally brilliant?” John frowned. “You know you’re a genius.”
Setting his empty plate on the coffee table, John settled back on to the couch. “So do you have any extra pillows or blankets I could barrow?” John asked, turning to face Sherlock.
“Thank God you said something,” John breathed, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s, his eyes still closed, “I was dreading having to go upstairs and leave you down here. I was hoping you’d suggest something.”
John’s mouth twitched, it was almost imperceptible, but Sherlock saw it. “You said it’s on Baker Street?”
“Yeah, something like that would work.” John said, sitting up straight so he was properly facing Sherlock. “And you’d have keep up the façade even after the necklace was sold. Better yet, takeout several boxes.”
Even though he wasn’t set to be released until the afternoon – the physical therapist wanted to do one last check before handing him off – Sherlock was already dressed, and the few possessions he’d acquired during his week long stay, were stacked and ready to go when John arrived.
Despite what he tried to claim, it was clear as day that Sherlock wasn’t entirely fine. When he closed one of their cold cases, he always seemed to want to fidget and hobble around the flat for a bit, probably to let off the little burst of adrenaline he got from a solve. Sherlock should have been bouncing off the walls after solving a fresh murder – Julia Stoner’s stepfather was the head of a cosmetics company and was slowly poisoning her by way of tainted ‘test samples’, all in the hopes of getting her inheritance before she wed her fiancé.  Or he should have started testing the samples John saw him nick, but instead, he hadn’t moved from the spot on the couch where John left him, his head was thrown back against the back of the couch, his eyes were shut tight, his teeth clenched, and his hands hadn’t left his left thigh. Sherlock wasn’t fine, he was clearly in pain.
“Can’t say I do. Why?”
“It’s the cross I must bear.” giggles Sherlock, sliding down the wall to sit on the hall floor. Perhaps his drinks were getting to him as well.
“And in the meantime? What do we do while we’re taking it slow?”
John swallowed hard, as he felt his eyes start to prickle. Sherlock had always been amazing, and for anyone to think that John had a hand in making him even half the fantastic, fascinating, wonderful, man he was, was ridiculous. “Greg, I… I don’t…”
“And what do you suggest I eat?” Sherlock asked, shifting to sit up a bit more. “Given the state of my face, chewing may prove difficult.”
you, not
“Ok,” John felt a bit skeptical, but he had to trust Sherlock. “Ok, but can I make one request?”
*******
“You were coming to say sorry with a bottle of beer and a box of biscuits?”
For the rest of dinner the conversation, while odd, flows easily, and comfortably.  John even tells story of how he had been called to an opium den to tend to a couple of Canadian troops who had overdosed, without a single permanent side effect.
, or at least Sherlock thought – hoped – he did. Maybe… maybe it was all those things. Maybe that’s what made him interesting, because John was all those things.
“Oh you’re really a lifesaver!” Molly beamed. “I’ll just wait outside, take your time.”
At this point, John’s mouth had gone completely dry, unable to believe what he was hearing. “O – ok” he stumbled, swallowing hard. “I – I won’t tell him. But I bet – I bet he wants people to know.”
“Yes,” Sherlock nodded, “we need to go home. I suddenly find I am feeling very amorous, and very much need to get my fantastic boyfriend divested of his clothes, and in a horizontal position.”
“How much? I’m a medical doctor, how much blood did Sherlock lose?”
Finally after a few seconds, Sherlock shook his head and opened his mouth as if to respond, but before he could, John heard a door open from behind them.
“Oh no, Sherlock… Is it?” Came Molly’s voice from the doorway.
Wrapping himself up, hated cane in hand, John sets out from his empty one room flat, and into the chill of London in late January. It has been a few weeks since John returned to the city he once considered home, and other than his weekly trips to his therapist, John has spent his days thinking about how his life has changed, how everything he once loved and gave him drive, has been ripped from his fingers. But Doctor John Watson, Captain John Watson, is not one for wallowing in self pity, and though the emptiness is still there, John has decided not to let that stop him attempting to fill it.
Chuckling, John pulled Sherlock to his feet. “Before we get carried away, we really ought to clean up a bit.”
Why was John making this so difficult, could he see how wonderful this was?
*******
“Pity.” Sherlock shrugged. “We could have split the fee. Think it through next time.”
Wake-up call, that was one way to put it; fantastic blowjob was another. John awoke that morning harder than he thought possible, with Sherlock swallowing him down to the root, and circling one long finger around his entrance. His had trouble breathing for a good long while after, and could hardly move, but it was quite a way to wake up.
Not bothering to grab his pants – nobody else was in the flat – John padded into the bathroom and ran a clean flannel under the warm water. Giving himself a quick once over, John then crawled back onto the bed, and gently ran the cloth along Sherlock’s chest and abdomen. Sherlock didn’t say a word, just watched the entire time, his eyes soft, his body pliant, moaning just slightly as John worked him clean.
“Well then you should have come with me when I went to the shops.” John stifled a snicker, remembering the moment he spotted the trunks.
“John, you don’t have to say that. It’s fine, I understand.”
“Tit.” John laughed. “Now go on, don’t leave Molly waiting. Waste my time all you want, but I can’t have you messing up her academic future.”
“Yes I do!” Sherlock protested. “I’m brilliant, you know. You call me brilliant all the time, and I always know what I’m saying. Goodbye Dr. Flat-Face!”
“That’s… That’s not what other people usually say to me.”
Shit, Sherlock had asked him something.
However, all concerns over Sherlock’s behavior soon vanished as John hung back and watched him sweep the room and begin questioning Mrs. Rachlin. To watch Sherlock work was, for lack of a better word, brilliant. Not only did he manage to convince Mrs. Rachlin and her friend that it was perfectly reasonable for Scotland Yard to consult with a teenager, but also got her to recall everything, even the slightest, most seemingly insignificant details of the incident. Just as Lestrade had told them, she walked in on the burglary, startling the two intruders, and it was the shorter of the two – a woman – who knocked her out. She was knocked out standing in the doorway to the living room, but awoke on the couch along with a cold compress, and phone placed on the table next to her. After doing an inventory of the house, all the electronics, and the vast majority of Mrs. Rachlin’s jewelry – including a few very expensive pieces – remained untouched. In fact, the only things taken were a few of Mr. Rachlin’s family heirlooms, and they only really held sentimental value.

“I understand if he doesn’t want people to know, I don’t deserve John. John’s too good for me, too good to me.” Sherlock mumbled, his eyes closed.
“Overexert myself? I didn’t overexert myself.”
Things did not improve as the day wore on. When they returned to Baker Street, Sherlock went straight for the couch, laying down with his back to the room, ignoring John completely. The sandwich and cup of tea John set on the coffee table was sneered at, watching something on telly was quickly nixed with a glare when John reached for the remote, and John was not stupid enough to attempt conversation. This was what Mycroft had meant when he said Sherlock sometimes had ‘black moods’. Well, it wasn’t anything John couldn’t deal with, and it would have to pass eventually.
“I know it’s fine.”
“I did not. No, apparently she, quote, needed someone who was willing to be there for her, and I wasn’t willing to put her first. I wasn’t out at the pub with my mates; I was in a god damn war zone doing my job. Something she knew when we met, got together, and engaged, so I don’t know what she expected.” This was really not the conversation John envisioned he’d be having when he got up that morning. But then again, with Sherlock, nothing turned out how he expected.
Sherlock didn’t know how it could get any better, but then John began thrusting in earnest, hitting his prostate over and over, and everything Sherlock thought he knew about sex went out the window. With every thrust, Sherlock lifted his hips to meet John’s, and the tight heat coiling in his abdomen grew. The sounds of their moaning filled John’s room as they moved together, their bodies rocking together, kissing and panting into each other’s mouths for what could have been hours. Everything was a haze, the world was a haze; only the feel of John’s sweat slicked skin sliding against his, the feel of John sinking into him over and over, was in sharp focus. The rest of the world may have not even been there anymore, all that mattered was he and John, right there, together; unbelievably, inexplicably together.
“How do you do it?” John teased
John couldn’t look at Sarah. Loath as he was to admit it, she had him pegged. “God, why am I paying Ella when I can just talk to you?” He chuckled.
“Oh… right.” John glanced down at his hand to find his phone clutched tight in his fist. “Listen, I, uh, I don’t know when I’ll be back. I’ll… I’ll try to call or text or something, later. I have to go.” Christ, what was he still doing here, Sherlock needed him.
“But do you know what happened?” God, he just wanted answers. What was so difficult about telling him what happened?
“Oh, I believe we’re going to be revisiting this issue
“The box, John, it’s obviously for me.”
“People take self-defense classes all the time, Sherlock.” John sighed. “And hey, if it really bothers you, you don’t have to tell anyone what we’re doing. We can do it in the evenings, we can do it in private.”
“If memory serves,” Sherlock’s memory always served, “you said tomorrow is an away game.”
“God yes.” John breathed, and let go, finally giving in to everything that had been building between them since the moment he set eyes on Sherlock Holmes.
– I need to feel that again… I need it –
“John, I told you before, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself.”
For the nth time that weekend, John felt his eyes begin to prickle. “You know what, I don’t think I’ll forget a single second either.” And then, wrapping his arms around his fiancé’s neck, he sealed their predictions – their promises – with a kiss.
Perhaps it was the atmosphere, with the single candle on the table, and the dim light fixtures hanging from the ceiling, it was a far more intimate setting than some of the other places they’d gone. The seemingly knowing smiles Angelo was shooting them each time he stopped by to check in weren’t helping matters either. Also not helping was just how good Sherlock looked, a crisp blue shirt that perfectly complemented his eyes, under his ever present fine suit, his artfully tousled black curls that John knew for a fact took ages to get the ‘oh they just happened to fall like this’ look. Sherlock always looked good, but in the aforementioned candle light, he looked… well, he looked even better. He certainly looked better than John by comparison. Even with the bit of product on his hair, his best navy jumper, and the jeans that Harry once joked made her worry would turn Clara, John knew he’d never look close to being on par with Sherlock. Not that he had to look comparable to Sherlock, he didn’t have to look ‘worthy’, it wasn’t a date after all. Not a date, definitely not a date.
“So they just dropped it?”
It isn't until a month later, three months into their arrangement, that Sherlock and John first spend the night together without having sex.
The team had agreed to meet up at The Gurnard's Head – Alec knew the area and he knew ‘the perfect place for champions to get a pint’ – after everyone had had a chance to shower and change. John was already late, and having to all but drag Sherlock behind him wasn’t helping.
WOOO! Lips have touched lips. This is not a drill, people, it happened! Next time we see how our boys feel about the touching of lips, and we'll see what the morning brings.
John eyed the man holding the door open for him, he was dressed in a suit, but he was large and well built, clearly some form of private security. John recognized ex-military when he saw it. He could probably hold his own for a while, but there was no way he could beat the man if he tried to leg it, and who knew how many others might have been waiting in the wings. So, doing what could prove to be the dumbest thing he could do – and after the last few days, that was saying something – John slid into the empty back of the car. The door had barely closed before the car was speeding off to God knew where, John just hoped it wasn’t his death.
“That’s not soon enough.” Sherlock groaned. “Where’s that man who picked up guys at clubs for insane sex filled weekends? He’d already be upstairs naked by now, and we’d be doing terrible, terrible things to each other.”
As always, I love to hear what you think, so drop me some comments and corrections!

“That’s fine. I can give you some names of therapists who can come to your home if you prefer. Many patients actually prefer in-home treatment. There just needs to be a big enough space for them to set up their equipment.” Meredith seemed unfazed by Sherlock’s little outburst. John however, was giving him another look. Didn’t matter, he’d deal with that later.
“I know, and that’s why we’re here, to change that!”
“Mmmm,” John hummed, “if you can’t tell, then I’m obviously not doing it right.” He mumbled, continuing to pepper Sherlock’s face, neck, and mouth with kisses.
“I was asking if we have all the stuff we need for tomorrow, but never mind that now. You’re acting off, is something wrong?” John asked, his brow furrowing.
“You know what.” Was Sherlock blushing? “For what I did… for… for kissing you,” he mumbled, looking down at his plate, only the crust from his toast remaining.
~***~
John frowned. That made absolutely no sense at all. Sure, Sherlock wasn’t too sociable, or overly cheery, and maybe he was a bit odd, he had less than typical interests, he was blunt, impatient, slightly oblivious at times, and was a shade arrogant, but nothing about him was necessarily unlikeable. While he may not have been ordinary, he was interesting, and he had a macabre sense of humor that matched John’s. Sherlock was actually a decent friend once you looked passed the outer shell of blunt, oblivious, impatient arrogance. At least that’s the impression John got after two weeks of knowing the man.
Shit!
*******
The sky slowly darkened and the trees lining the streets lit-up with fairy lights as John and Sherlock walked along, stopping to look into shop windows if something caught their eye. They were just nearing the end of one street when the sound of strings caught their ears, and John had to practically run to keep up with Sherlock who was all but dragging him in the direction of the music. The source turned out to be a string quartet set up in the town square, where dozens of people sat on the ground or in folding chairs, enjoying the music on the cool mid-May evening.
“Oh, I finished making all the study guides for my own classes, so I thought I’d make one for you guys.” John explained. “Well, it’s more of a handout for you to make your own. Figured if I pass it out tomorrow, that’ll give you enough time. Have a look, what do you think?”
“We do?”
“Well I can’t have you getting sick now can I?” John smirked, walking over and trailing his hands up Sherlock’s arms. “You stuck in bed all sniffly and gross; it’d be a terrible waste.”
“It’s just my face. Nothing’s wrong, I’m just thinking.” Sherlock said, giving John a half-smile.
~***~
Hurty? What the hell was John talking about? Perhaps he had taken a blow to the head as well.
Compliments, people like compliments. “I’m sure you’ll get it. You’ve been asked to be a TA, so you must have good grades, and – uh – you have the right… temperament?... for that kind of thing.” Oh Christ, that was pathetic.
“Nonsense, tea cures all manner of ills. What kind of nurse would I be if I didn’t at least offer that? And I think I remember how you take it.”  Leah grinned and left the room.
Unable to stand seeing Sherlock look so nervous, so worried, John pulled him down to silence him with a kiss. The kiss was slow and gentle, reminding John of those they’d shared that second morning, and he poured every bit of relaxing energy he had to try to calm Sherlock.
“You see,” John said, lowering his voice, and leaning in conspiratorially, “in secondary school I was a real dickhead, just awful. I was such a dickhead, that a witch put a curse on me. Now I have to do a thousand random good deeds, or else my soul will be damned to hell.”
“On you moving in with my darling baby brother. It appears we got that happy announcement after all.”
But that night, the night of their second ‘first time we saw each other’ anniversary, they didn’t know any of this. All John Watson knew as he lay in bed that night was that he had found the love of his life, and his love for the man in his arms - his Bumblebee - grew deeper and stronger with every passing moment. And all Sherlock Holmes knew was that nothing on Earth could ever make him happier than he was with the man holding him, the man who loved him and showed him what love meant and what love could do. Against all odds, they had found each other, and they were safe and loved, and everything was perfect.
Perhaps this Jack – or whatever his real name was – was a bit cocksure after all, but for some reason it just made Sherlock want him more, instead of repulsing him like it had done with the others. Well, whatever the reason, Jack had the makings of an excellent distraction.
John smiled back; the skin around his eyes crinkling, making them shine. “Well I may not be the world’s only consulting detective, but I can form a conclusion or two.”
“I’ve noticed a far few things about you too, would you like me to pester you about them?” Sherlock said, taking a step forward, using every inch of height to his advantage as he stared daggers down at John. “How is your mother dealing without her little peacekeeper around? She must have felt spoiled having you around all summer. Well, I say all summer, but really just when you weren’t at work or kicking a football around like a child.”
“No need to tell me twice,” John chuckled, “But I’ll talk to you later on though, Harry. And Clara, I’m really glad you’re here too.” John added, smiling at Harry’s not-so-ex wife.
“Hey, you’re not the only one here in a good relationship, you know!” Molly said, once the laughter subsided.
“Yeah, the snow picked up last night.”
“He was probably off strangling small animals or something.” Sebastian continued, laughing at his own joke. “Anyway, that’s when we jumped him. He actually tried to fight back, actually managed to scratch Eddie. But he couldn’t fight long. It’s kind of difficult with a foot in your gut.” At this point, John was seething. But he kept his mouth shut and maintained his composure, had was just going to let this bastard dig himself and his friends deeper “We told him he might as well just leave school now, because no one wanted him around. Warned him too, told him that anytime we see him, we’d make sure he knew just how unwanted he is.”
“If it’ll make the case stronger,” Molly said leaning in further and dropping her voice to a near whisper, “I can always say I saw them beating you up this last time, and not just the shoving. I don’t think anyone would fault a woman for not physically jumping in to stop three grown men.”
“Oh God, what now, Molly? I’m totally and completely fine!”
“Absolutely. I can’t believe that’s what had you so worked up.” John chuckled, letting his arm fall to join the other at Sherlock’s waist.
“It’s the cross I bear.” Sherlock sighed.
“I always behave appropriately to the situation.”
“And everything you’ve been doing, you’ve been trying to making it special for me, for us, because this is significant.”
*******
“No, no. Mostly I’m just terribly bored laying here with nothing to distract me… Actually, do you have any important plans for the day?” Sherlock asked, getting an idea. “Anywhere you need to be?”
