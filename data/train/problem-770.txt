By then he was having sex with her. He didn’t remember exactly how that had begun. Maybe it was a pity fuck one night when he’d had too much to drink. He woke up in her bed hungover, waiting for the darkness to descend like a weight on his chest, and she was there, making him a cup of tea, urging him to have some toast, sweetly solicitous and not accepting any excuses.
I slapped my palm to my forehead. “Have mercy, Watson! No theatre reviews. I have no desire to see any of Messrs Gilbert and Sullivan’s entertainments. Proceed with the events of the evening. And no descriptions of finery— or blow by blow narratives of inane conversations.”
Sherlock isn’t willing to wait for that to happen. What’s necessary now is to convince John that it’s all right to leave, that he
Elsa didn’t look up from her phone. “Can you tell my mum to stop calling me Rosamund? She said I could be Rose, but I don’t like that name either.”
He experiments a bit, inserting one finger and reaching for the prostate. John moans. He doesn’t intend to fully penetrate John tonight, though, just to open his mind a bit to the possibility.
If he had never forgotten a line in all the roles he had played, it wasn’t only because he had a good memory. It was fear— pure, raw terror. That void was terrifying— that blank moment when there is no cue, no script, no line. When that happened, it was like falling into a chasm, being swallowed up in the roar of a waterfall. That was the emptiness that he feared, that he had fled from in a hundred scripts, that he had answered with words not his own.
“You say he is not a common criminal,” he replied. “It’s clear he sees this as some kind of personal vendetta.”
“Oh!” Matt says, eyes widening. “Lava lamp. I wonder where we can get one. Probably eBay.” He pulls out his phone and begins searching.
Afghanistan made him sure. Getting wounded made him sure. He was not going to live his life trying to please everyone. It sounded trite, but he needed to figure out who he was. Maybe it was too early to jump into a relationship so soon after Mary, but opportunities don’t obey a schedule.
“Oh, God.” John gave a startled laugh. “You watched them all? Why would you subject yourself to that?”
“I painted my room black once,” Sherlock says. “My mother had to hang wallpaper after I left home. She painted it three times, but it kept bleeding through. She reminds me of that every time I come home.”
There are noises. At first it sounds like it’s coming from outside. Voices, maybe, but too indistinct to make out words. And there are other sounds, familiar, but I can’t tell what they are.
“Though you have always cast yourself in the role of the prodigal, she does not favour me over you, Sherlock. Nor you over me.”
He opens the door of his flat and flicks on the light. It’s home, or what has been passing for home these last months. Almost a year, he thinks, since he was wounded, since everything changed.
In the end, he went to Molly’s reunion because he felt guilty about the fan, who hadn’t done anything wrong except become obsessed with a television series that had been off the air for over ten years, forgotten by normal people. Molly and the others would understand what it was like to run into diehard fans, and there was something comforting in that.
“That’s because you never give them a chance to like you. You really should think better of yourself, you know. You deserve a nice young man.”
Holmes smiles placidly. “I’ve already paid for your second beer. Whoever you’re meeting is not showing up tonight. They would have been here by now or sent you a text. From the way you’ve been checking your phone, I assume they haven’t done that. So, relax.”s He leans in, his voice low and impossibly seductive. “Just pretend I’m your date.“
I did not often consider Aunt Kitty’s feelings, as she had no concern for mine. My father had never spoken much of his sister, and I had never met her until I was brought to her house. I met my Uncle James at my father’s funeral. Since he had three children who were just few years older than me, it seemed a good idea that I come and live with him.
Other than Victor, who didn’t really count, he’d never been in a romantic relationship. He hadn’t ruled it out, but when he was younger and might have been inclined in that direction, Mycroft had warned him not to, if he wanted to have a career. Since he was dependent on Mycroft at that time, he didn’t challenge it. Even if he’d wanted to, there wasn’t anyone who tempted him.
“Richard Brook. There’s something off about him. I want to know who he is, what he’s been in, every part he’s auditioned for.”
Feeling a warm hand on his forehead, he nuzzles into it. He’s having a lovely dream, one where his head is in John’s lap and John is running his fingers through his hair.
Sherlock slides his hand over John’s buttocks, slipping his finger just inside his hole. He hears John gasp and feels him shudder a bit.
That night, when he opened the door and saw John standing there, he had grown used to loving him silently. He expected nothing in return.
to describe me. Was it the fact that I hadn’t showered since yesterday? And John was a goat as well. We would have to rethink our shower schedule, and our products as well.
“Hi.” Messy dark hair, light eyes, tall and lanky. A bit like Sherlock, but not. “How do you feel?” He’s holding an empty syringe.
Holmes had never actually been in a mattress store before. In fact, he wasn’t truly sure where mattresses came from, his own having simply existed on his bed frame for years. It came with the flat, he thought.
The weather was frosty, the kind of cold that is not slushy, but brittle. We went briskly, our breath crystallising in front of our faces as we walked. The afternoon was already growing into twilight. Watson kept quiet, sensible that I was thinking.
John’s reply was to kiss me again, this time more deeply. He put his arms around my shoulders and pulled me close.
To my eyes, the lady was plain: small, blonde, and of limited means (as I gleaned from her costume). Certainly not beautiful. But manipulative.
It wasn’t entirely unprecedented to find someone in my flat, waiting for me. Sometimes they bring weapons. I’ve warned Mrs Hudson that she shouldn’t just send clients up without patting them down, but people can be cunning.
Today she will try to get me to face what I’ve lost. I think that’s what counsellors do. There are five stages of grieving, and their job is to get you to stage five. Then you graduate and go forth, having reached Acceptance.
“I have solved it.” I smiled into my friend’s sightless eyes. The theatrical makeup hadn’t been necessary at all. He wouldn’t have seen even the smallest change in me, let alone the shedding of fifty years. “My longest case.”
Sherlock turned to Irene, who was tearing the foil off a bottle of champagne. Molly was handing out glasses.
“I’m good at what I do,” he replies smoothly. “We’re not here to solve a crime, however. Just research for a little historical project, funded by a group of alumni.”
A paradox, perhaps. I like to think that while you were hating me all those years, a part of you felt such passionate hatred only because you also loved me. If you’d been indifferent, you wouldn’t have even remembered me.”
My life goes on. Sometimes I lie awake and think about him. I imagine that we’re sharing the same dreams, the two of us together, a quiet evening at 221B. I hope he’s as comforted by these dreams as I am.
John licked his lips. He imagined that those long alabaster limbs wrapped around him. That mouth, doing clever things with his— “Erm. Maybe you could show me?”
She smiles. “There are enough things wrong with Rich Brook that even Molly could see it. Don’t worry about her. She is not the wilted violet you think she is. And Brook isn’t that kind of creep.”
“I don’t listen to rumours.” Once this was over, maybe he could become a hermit. Or maybe he’d only take alien parts, let himself be typecast, create some kind of false persona and pretend he was happy. He was feeling a bit mad, not having slept the night before. Bad idea, to stay up watching Alex Tribble, series one through four, back-to-back episodes of John Watson being his friend. He couldn’t help it. Insomnia led to poor decisions, but at least he hadn’t gone out and found some cocaine.
on live telly,” she pointed out. “This is still a kid’s show. The watershed is at nine, and we’ll be starting at half seven.”
Mycroft looks at me, a surprised almost-sneer on his lips. Perhaps he’s curious: what threat can John Watson make that will move him?
Greg talked him into a late lunch. Neither of them drank, Greg because he was superstitious about having a beer before a performance, and Sherlock because he recognised his addictive tendencies and didn’t like to tempt fate.
“And here is the practical application,” I said. “Now that we have compared these prints with the prints we took from all the servants, we know that Mary Pilcher, the housemaid, was involved.”
“Hi, Rosebug,” he finally says. “I’m home for the weekend. Maybe we could talk— over a cup of tea? I thought we might go out for Chinese later…” She used to love fried dumplings, he remembers.
And why is it that John knows so little about his flatmate— his lover? He’s told Sherlock about his own family, his sister, his military career, his cheating wife. Sherlock deduced most of that on his own. John has never gone into detail about his marriage, but Sherlock probably knows what happened. John is an open book to Sherlock. Everyone is. Does he think that John can do that same magic trick, figure out his childhood and his family and his failed love affairs from the way he ties his dressing gown or the mess he leaves in the kitchen?
He shook his head. “I disagree. Nothing good can come out of it. The danger is that we might be discovered, and shooting someone can in no way make that better.”
“I think we might kiss,” Holmes suggested. “Surely that would increase the value of the experiment.”
He spent an hour wandering through Harrod’s. Sherlock generally did not wear off-the-rack clothing, but John had bought him a scarf here one Christmas and Sherlock had loved it. Hoping inspiration would strike again, he walked through the menswear department, seeing mostly things that were out of range, too expensive for what he had in mind, or too common and cheap. Another scarf? He already had a half dozen that he regularly wore. Even Sherlock Holmes only needed so many scarves.
"What I mean is, I don't mind being of less importance to you than your work and the violin, and your experiments. Or the bees. I can live with that.”
He tried again. This time I could catch bits of his voice, but it was not like the voice of any living creature. It sounded as if it were being conveyed from a distance, across many miles. Or years, perhaps. The sound of it made me think of a ghostly voice traveling along a wire, like a telegraph.
I was intrigued by what I’d seen, that he was able to alter his appearance, and wondered how far this talent might extend. It might be useful, I thought, if he appeared to be a great, slavering hound or some other monster.
“Please, let me say this. I don’t know where we are, if this is a dream or if you are even real. I want you to be alive, Sherlock, but I don’t know if you are. So I’ll just say it. I love you. Always have, even before I realised it. You said you weren’t a hero, but you were
“Well, that’s not happening,” my brother replied. “Mummy hasn’t even finished making the guest list. Leave it to me. I’ll let you know when we have a date.”
John was about to open his mouth and deny it, but Sherlock merely said, "We have our own beds, Sally. John's a very restless sleeper."
“I’d like to go to university.” I thought of cutting bodies open and seeing how they worked, examining all the cunning joints and the warm organs before they began to cool. I would track Death down to the moment life departed from a body. Maybe I could find where the soul stayed in the body, and how it left.
“You’ll be in the guest suite of the dormitory,” Wilkes says, checking his watch again. “As for interviewing… I’m afraid you can’t do that tonight. We’ve had an incident that I must unfortunately deal with.”
It’s nine p.m. and he’s sitting in a pub, waiting for Murray to show. His old army mate has recently returned, and they’d agreed to get together. The evening may not be worthy of an entire blog post, but he’s looking forward to it. He’s got his pint and his corner table, and is starting to feel like his old self, the one that used to like pub nights.
“There’s a syringe over there somewhere, full of cocaine,” he pants. “Evidence. And he had a bag with, erm, duct tape. A knife, I think.”
Eventually, he is more willing to go out of the flat, but he always hesitates at the door, looking at me with a question.
“I’ll wait for you.” He kissed me, and I felt warmth returning to my body. “Come back to me. You’ll know when it’s time.”
“You’ll need to come dressed for the theme,” says Matt. “You’ve got two weeks to grow a moustache, find a costume. Christopher and I are going to be Sonny and Cher.” He rolls his eyes. “Obviously, he’s Cher. I argued, but he’s taller.”
every night at bedtime. She used to love insects, giggled every time he called her that. Now he hears her sigh.
He does look then, beginning to understand. The scars are old, but still obvious. Inside his elbows there are dark marks, at least a few years old, purplish-brown against the paleness of his skin. They will fade with time, but skin remembers. He will always know they are there.
And he will make up some lie that will distance him from this, the way he always lies about it. To be honest, most of those lies are just John talking to himself.
But John is his best friend, and he will always remember that, even if it’s eventually something that only used to be true. John following him into an alley, his gun tucked in his waistband. John sitting beside him, laughing at crap telly. John crying when he was lying on the pavement in a pool of someone else’s blood. John saying,
Mary has never been happy with financial limits. After they married, she wanted to decorate this, her dream house, and was displeased with the budget they were on. There were arguments, even before Rosie was born, about how they should spend money. John grew up poor and is happy to have a tidy little house with a lumpy old sofa he can park himself on, a telly that doesn’t need to be whacked on the top to work properly. Mary’s family was more affluent than his, but she always complained about not having better things. It was as if life had dealt her a cruel blow, giving her a husband who wouldn’t buy her nice things. She was horrified when John suggested looking at used furniture, aggrieved when he wouldn’t give her a bigger decorating allowance. Inviting people over always required new purchases, lest she be embarrassed by how poorly they lived.
Martha Hudson squeezed his arm rather tightly. “It’s charming, Molly. Shall we begin where we left off?”
like him.” Unlike Sherlock, who wards off people like a curse, John is the sort that people automatically like, without even considering whether they do. “I’m just not a social person.”
“Well, you’re not doing so well holding up your side of the conversation. I’ve remarked on vomiting, and mentioned the deplorable dwelling we are now attempting to ascend. You might say something about the carpet, since you were down there on the last landing. That’s having a conversation, Watson. Give and take. I talk, you talk. Though I suspect you were raised by wolves and have no concept of such things. Your manners are tragic. Do make an attempt, though. It’s only civil.”
“I’m sorry, Mother,” I said, bending to place a kiss on her cheek. “We were tracking a suspect and I managed to corner him in an alley. He took a swing at me, but Watson came to my rescue before he struck again. In short, no harm done.” I motioned for him to come forward. “May I present John Watson, my partner. My mother, Viola Sherringford Holmes.”
Watson looked directly at me. “Of course. As long as he is happy with my contributions to our partnership, I will continue to work with him. If he is dissatisfied, he may replace me, of course. He is not one to keep such sentiments to himself.”
Sitting up in bed, I consider my options. I’m sleeping upstairs, as I always have. The bedroom downstairs has been closed for three weeks. I know what I would see if I opened that door. Another reminder that you’re not coming back.
In those sea-dark eyes, Sherlock can see those injuries and deaths, the ones he couldn’t save and the ones who went home with visible wounds, permanent disabilities. The wound that John Watson bears is more than a hole in his shoulder that means he’ll never do surgery again. It’s more than the halting walk that people pity. It’s the nightmares that deprive him of sleep and the days when he has nothing to do, no one to talk to, no purpose for being here, alive.
Warning: This chapter more fully describes the abusive relationship between Magnussen and John Watson. Not graphic.
“I snorted. “Inspector, really. Do you expect a blackmailer to put the names of people on his calendar? Why, any of his servants might blackmail him if he were so careless.”
And yet his own heart seems to stop for a moment, contemplating what it would mean if Watson died and he lived. This is why people love, he thinks, because whatever we can lose becomes precious to us. To experience that moment of Death, he might finally be able to see the borders of that country. Only when he can see beyond will he let himself love.
And I’m no longer old. I’m just as I was when I first moved to London, full of energy and anticipation.
“Ohh…” Panic and pleasure mingled in my gut. A part of me desperately wanted to pull free, to flip him over and fuck him properly, show him who owned him. But this was new and strangely exciting. I imagined him in control, and was surprised at the jolt I felt in my groin. Over me, John was watching, moving up and down…
(as she refers to Sherlock’s serious lapse of judgement that nearly cost John his life), and he remembers the case, can name the suspect they were chasing. He remembers what he had for breakfast that day (eggs and toast, as always, with orange marmalade), and what he was wearing (navy jumper, plaid shirt, blue jeans). His memory fails him when he tries to remember getting hit on the head. It’s fascinating to see where his recall ends, shortly before the actual injury, while the events of the chase were presumably still in short-term memory, ready to be knocked out by a well-aimed pipe.
“The hair colour was natural blond— obviously a Westerner. He left word that he was going there. It’s a hundred miles from Tokyo, where he was staying while they filmed the ads he was contracted to do. He took a day trip, by train. Not part of a tour; by himself.”
Watson sits by the fire, sipping tea. He’s wearing Holmes’s dressing gown, getting toast crumbs all over it, licking honey from his fingers. “You seem different,” he says. “Did you figure it out?”
“Yeah, that’s when we meet. It’s a support group for men coming out. I guess I’m not betraying any confidences by saying that. We stopped for a pint afterwards, and talked a bit.”
When Brook made his entrance, the applause was less certain. The wardrobe manager had made an effort to find an Aran jumper similar to the one Jason constantly wore in the series, and the shade of his hair had been darkened a bit to look more natural.
"Holmes,” he said, smiling. “You didn’t tell her, and yet she learned the truth— and survived the shattering of her delusions.”
) is skilled in manipulation, brilliantly irritating (as he is brilliant at nearly everything else he attempts), and immune to all Watson’s little barbs. His plan all along had been to glue himself to Watson’s side, and now Watson has glued himself there. Whatever happens when they arrive, he will deserve it.
John isn’t nodding off yet, but his attention is not on the television. Sherlock makes a decision, slides his hand between John’s legs, leans over and kisses him.
“Don’t be crude, Sherlock,” Mrs Holmes said. “Your speech has become shockingly vulgar. Perhaps you should serve a higher class of clients.”
“Yeah, me too. Not sure I can claim all the credit, though. Somebody higher up than me must have felt some pressure from the British government.” He smiles. We both know who that is. “They called me in and I said what I’d been saying all along: he wasn’t a fraud. I’m glad it’s over.”
He played it with some reserve, receiving her awkward hug, humbly making his ask with the understanding that he had wounded her and regretted it.
Sherlock nodded. “I’d be surprised as well, but I have no problem playing Baz as gay. I suppose I’ve always played him that way, not as a cliche or stereotype, but as a private man who doesn’t think it’s anyone’s business.” He hated it when people expected a character to show every gay cliche. Why couldn’t a gay man just be himself?
“Yeah, it’s a bit disturbing,” Lestrade agreed. “But it’s happened before. River Phoenix, Brandon Lee, Natalie Wood. You don’t stop filming or end a successful programme because you’ve lost an actor if you can find a way to work around it.”
Downstairs, the real Holmes is making no attempt to let Watson sleep. He’s clanging things in the kitchen and at the same time, yelling at someone. He hopes it’s not Mrs Hudson; she has to be a saint for suffering whatever hell he must put her through on a daily basis.
“Haven’t seen any scripts yet,” said Lestrade. “We’ve got talented writers, though, and I’m sure they’ll come up with some great episodes.”
“Would you?” asked Sherlock. “If they wrote our characters in a relationship, would you have a problem playing that?”
“All right, I suppose that will do for now. Not a rude question, though the answer is self-evident. I will not call it a stupid question because it’s self evident that drink makes people stupid. I’ll forgive you because you’re obviously having trouble thinking sensibly right now. Yes, I’m bringing you home. It seemed kinder than leaving you there, folded up on the pavement next to a dead shrub. I’m not a complete sociopath, you know.”
He understands what his purpose must be. He will have the conversation he needs to have with Sherlock. It may be an angry conversation, but he will say what he needs to say. The outcome may not be what he wants, but he will be heard, and he will listen, too.
He had an obligation to say something, he decided, but there was nothing he could tell her. What he knew was in confidence; he could not betray Victor, who had gone above and beyond to find the information. Victor was always thorough, and if anything definite could be found, he would have told Sherlock, even if he was legally bound not to.
Lestrade took one look at him and sighed. “You’re not going to bollocks this up, Sherlock. Put all your best acting skills into it. Bloody hell, you can make people believe you’re an alien. Can’t you just make them believe you’re nice, even for ten minutes?”
He never planned on doctoring small children with runny noses, babies who won’t sleep through the night. And he’s never planned on having any of his own.
“Why would he be disappointed? You’re a lovely person, Sherlock. You have your moments, of course, but you’re really a very kind person. And you notice things about people. I know you wouldn’t have been rude to him, seeing he was depressed. ”
“The next time Miss Morstan sits in this chair, I want you to be thinking of my prick in your arse, not her pretty eyes.”
The roar that followed was deafening. Sherlock heard nothing; eyes closed, he was trying to memorise every detail of John’s lips, his tongue, the feel of his hands on Sherlock’s back.
I move the shade and peer through a grimy window to where the alley should be. There are buildings nearby, none of them higher than a storey or two. There are no streetlights, only the moon. It doesn’t feel like London.
There’s no point in denying it. Almost everyone who’s been to uni has lived in a small room with another person or at least a tiny flat with one loo. People with shit jobs share flats they can’t afford alone. It’s an experience most adults have had. “Sure. I’ve had roommates. I just prefer… to be alone.”
“I do.” She smiled. “No worries about the broadcast. Just don’t let yourself think he’s harmless. He may very well be, but I wouldn’t let my guard down.”
, he is a sound sleeper who always retires at 10:30 sharp. The staff joke about how hard he is to wake up.
was purely religious and had no place in scientific investigation. There was an unspoken rule that such things should remain unknown, just as the triune God Himself was a mystery. Science and religion were separate spheres; even Darwin’s discoveries did not discourage people from believing in the events of Genesis; it only meant that the scripture could be interpreted less literally in order to accept what science had proved. Most people who sat in the pew on a Sunday were not overly concerned about when or how creation took place, since it obviously had. These were debates for theologians.
You shake your head. “You can have a life, John. You’ll meet someone, get married, and be happy. That’s what I want for you.”
“As yours did mine,” he said quietly. “But I forgave you for that, even before I knew you were alive.”
She shrugged. “Brainy is the new sexy. Other than that, I don’t see much that we share. I can read you, even in your expensive suit and that coat you wear like armour. Inside, you’re just an alien, trying to figure out what humans want of you.”
He’s thought about it too many times, but he still feels a clutch of revulsion hearing Matt say it. He didn’t deserve it. So why does he feel pathetic? Why does he feel… dirty? When he followed the creep into the alley, he wasn’t planning anything other than talking. Is he really that naive? Sherlock certainly seems to think so.
He stays in her flat. The stasis lasts seventeen days, and when he wakes, she is there, watching him.
Tears sting her eyes, remembering. “He couldn’t stay there, don’t you see? Everything reminded him of you; he couldn’t find a way out of his grief. Someone at Barts, probably Mike, got him the job. You could see it on his face; he was struggling, in pain. People said that he’d started drinking on the job, that he was sent home a couple times for being intoxicated. Whenever I passed him in a corridor, he looked like he was in a trance, pushing a heavy object uphill, knowing that it was just going to run him over when he thought he’d reached the top. Then I heard he’d been fired.”
“I thought you were dead. It took me a long time, eighteen months, but I had decided I needed to move on with my life. I was trying to cobble together a future for myself because I didn’t think I could stand it any more. I’d moved out of Baker Street.
“You’re tired of me. I asked you once if you would tell me when you began to feel that way. And now that a new… protege has appeared, I deduce that you no longer require my services. In your usual way, you’re being evasive about it. Instead of honestly confessing your feelings, you intend to drive me away, make it appear to be my fault.” He looked away, biting his lip. “Very well. I quit.”
When John pulls back, he’s smiling at Sherlock. “And what has that big brain of yours observed now?”
The broadcast was scheduled for seven thirty p.m. The cast met at noon to go over some final instructions, and then Irene told them all to relax for a few hours.
The woman stepped off the curb and walked resolutely towards the door of 221B. We heard the bell clang once, decisively.
“I never thought he’d actually— I was shocked when it happened. I’ve known him for a few years and he wasn’t… like that. What I mean is, he thought too highly of himself to do that. Not that he didn’t have moments. When he went through his drug phase, I really thought he might. There was that time when he overdosed and almost didn’t make it. Afterwards, we talked; I told him things might look bleak, but it would get better. And he said,
“There’s no room here, Rosie,” John says. “We can see each other, go out and do things together, but I don’t see how—“
“I hadn’t planned on it,” he said. “Look, Rosamund, you can’t live here. It wouldn’t be a good environment for you.”
I had not asked for anything they had given me, nor did I want it. Fortunately, since arriving I had learned to hold my tongue. If I had to live here, amongst these people, it was better to keep myself as invisible as possible. Even so, I had no doubt that my cousins would find ways to make my life miserable. I said nothing.
Watson, lost in his own memories, was silent. Snow was falling outside, covering Baker Street, hushing the cabs and muffling the voices of passers-by. The gaslights had been lit and cast a yellowish glow over the cobblestones.
“Because I learned,” he says savagely. “In those other schools I had learned the futility of keeping my head down and avoiding notice. I learned that it’s better to be what I am, to use my superior mind. It’s better to attack first, instead of waiting to be assaulted, to break others before they break you. When I came to Priory I applied these lessons: I was rude, I insulted them, deduced their mental inferiority, their every failure. They hated it, but it also amused them. Like you, I became a kind of mascot. I was tolerated, made to do tricks for their entertainment, deducing the other boys. As you say, being tolerated is better than being a victim.” He sighs deeply. “I didn’t understand what that would do to me. And I didn’t see what it had done to you.”
“That’s over. I mean, we’re not on great terms, but yeah, I’m glad it’s over.” He pauses, draws a deep breath and slowly lets it out. “I need to talk to someone about my, um…. well. The thing is, I’m in a gay relationship and having some issues.”
“Of course.” Holmes looks at the empty spot where the urn was. “Moriarty wasn’t like us. He shot himself and died.”
The summer after I left Cambridge and moved to London, I went back to Greenwood Hall, where my aunt still lived. I felt nothing for her, nor for my cousins, remembering how they had tormented me. I had not seen Aunt Kitty since I was nine, and though she looked older, she had not changed much.
. Or that anyone might recognise him. Classic elements of a disguise— beard, glasses, hat pulled low. He even spoke in a voice below his natural range, saying as little as possible. Obviously hiding something.”
When I slipped into bed beside him, he barely stirred. Wrapping my arms around him, I felt myself undone by fear.
And now— did knowing John was alive change anything? Had it resolved the confused knot of feelings Sherlock had been carrying around for years?
It’s regret, he realises. This is unfamiliar territory for him, waking up in bed with someone he cares about. He
Before he can answer, Moriarty puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The force of the shot drops him to the roof. Blood begins to pool underneath his head.
“The money can not be obtained,” I replied. “You would do better to take two thousand than leave empty-handed.”
“Your friend Murray married for love, as did his bride. I admit, I was wrong that time. The odds are in my favour, however, that Miss Sutherland and her new suitor are not a love-match, but a practical arrangement to salvage her father’s business and get her away from her horrible step-father.”
He feels his eyes practically bugging out of his head and wishes there were someone else here to confirm that Sherlock Holmes is a complete lunatic.
“I made an inference. Molly is not very social, and most of the people she knows are doctors. And you must have trained at Barts with Stamford.”
What an idiot he has been! If he’d just asked John to be his flatmate, he might have kept him. He could have had John, loved him silently. After such a cruel rejection, John must hate him. He’s a stubborn man, and even if Molly pleads with him, he’ll never say a word against Sherlock.
The circle is now in place and Jay is going over the group norms. One person has the floor, and others can ask questions, make affirmations. The turn passes to anyone who feels like sharing, and nobody has to speak. Listening is fine. Jay asks who would like to share, but doesn’t push anyone. A man volunteers, describing his wife’s reaction to finding out that the man she married is gay.
Holmes pushes him down into a lumpy chair that sits opposite a larger chair in front of the hearth. “Tea, Mrs Hudson, if you please.”
“You’re talented.” She smiled tearfully. “We all could see that. Martha used to say it all the time.
Just as he’s thinking this, a sign. John has put his hand on the seat, next to Sherlock’s. His pinky finger loops over Sherlock’s, a small gesture, a test to see whether they can just declare a truce.
He knows who he used to be. The part of him that rises to a challenge is poised, ready to take a dare, try something new. It scares him a bit, like standing on the edge of a precipice, trying to decide if he can make it across in one leap. He’s not sure what’s on the other side.
“No. I was thinking about how much I loved you already, even though we’d just met, and realising that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.”
John doesn’t object, but he seems distant, distracted. Dinner was meant to be an olive branch, a gesture to show that Sherlock isn’t holding a grudge over the gym incident. And he is happy that he solved it. John said he was
Spontaneously, John pulled Sherlock into an embrace and kissed him. It wasn’t a tame kiss, one just for show. No, that wouldn’t raise the stakes enough. It was a full-on, passionate kiss with one hand winding through Sherlock’s hair and the other grabbing his arse.
“He was your teacher, you say. But being taught a skill is not the same as being skilled. Do you have practical experience?”
She sighs and rolls her eyes a bit. “Refuses. Another thing to be dramatic about. I was thinking that maybe you and I should see someone, together.”
John’s mother had overseen his early career, but hired a manager as soon as it looked like his popularity would carry on beyond kid roles. Sherlock never met the man, but John mentioned him sometimes. It was hard to tell what John was not saying, but he sensed that this manager and John’s mum were making some aggressive choices for him. If he had to guess, he would say that John was not happy with some of these choices.
“No, nothing. I’m not likely the one who will hear first, in any case. I just make sure you show up and do your job.”
Mike cast a nervous eye towards Irene, who was frowning at them. “Right. I just thought you should know. There will be interviews in the coming days, and I want you to be prepared for the questions. They’ll ask how you felt about John, if you loved him, how you felt when he died. You know how they are, so be ready.”
in London. As it turned out, his sister lived in Croydon, which is technically in London, but he wasn’t speaking to her, so it’s possible he wasn’t trying to be deceptive.
“It was almost the same for me. I knew I was gay, but until I met you, I didn’t anticipate falling in love with anyone. What do you want now, John?”
. I assume that’s the brother you’d like to disavow, but I’m partial to eating, so I accepted on your behalf. Oh, and there were nicotine patches in the bag as well, so I hope you’re not upset about the cigarettes.”
Once the King had departed, Watson turned to me “Your manners leave something to be desired, Holmes. If Queen Victoria herself were to come here, seeking your help, would you have stood for her?”
He starts to open a drawer, and then takes his hand off the knob. He’s not here to spy on Harry. She’s left him alone in her house because she trusts him, and he’s not going to sneak around, spying on her to find out what she’s hiding. That should be a conversation, and not one that begins with accusations.
“Such behaviour is learned in an environment where it’s allowed to exist,” Holmes replies. “Bullying is part of a masculine culture that rewards the most brutal.”
“I did see you,” Watson said quietly. “When I was dying. We were standing on the path at Reichenbach, and light was coming through the waterfall, making it look like prisms. You told me to stop being an idiot and go home. I told you that I would only go home if you were there to meet me. When I woke up in Zion’s rondavel—” He drew a shaky breath. “For a moment I thought that I had died, but you must still be alive, which was why you weren’t there.”
At the time he wondered why Holmes hadn’t been caught. The Priory School was very strict about cheating; Watson knew two boys who’d been disciplined, one who’d been expelled. Maybe Holmes was honestly just tutoring other boys, but Watson wasn’t about to go to his room and ask for help. He wasn’t about to face that mob again.
A few days later I opened the door of our flat to find another pre-teen girl on the landing, preparing to knock. She had a Watson-ish face, sandy blond hair.
“It isn’t your fault,” he says. “I don’t know why people want to blame everything on parents, when their first job is to make sure the child is physically safe and cared for, not to be there all the time, catering to their every whim. You are a good parent, and she is just being a normal fourteen year old.”
And suddenly he understands what could be bothering John. He has an ex-wife and a daughter he never talks about. Sherlock has never observed John on the phone with them, though perhaps he does that from work. He has never talked about visiting them. He’s been living at 221B for nearly two months now, and as far as Sherlock knows, hasn’t seen his family once.
I gave an incredulous snort. “Really, John.” I paused, then, taking in his expression. “You’re quite serious about this.”
And sometimes he drops by the flat. He never has much to say, never talks about Sherlock, but it’s fine. I make tea and offer the biscuits he likes, and we chat. I think he misses him too.
She get up from the chair, begins to gather up the dishes he’s left all over the room. “That’s for him to decide, whether he wants to see you. And you’ll never know if you don’t ask him.”
John feels restless. “Going for a walk,” he announces. “I can stop and get more milk. Anything else we need?”
“I do think. And why not? We know John isn’t particularly imaginative. Why not reach for a name he’s already familiar with? He was used to answering to it, which eliminates the problem of not recognising when people are addressing you.”
But he needs to say something. The more Sherlock thinks about it, the more certain he is that this has been a mistake. John isn’t ready for this, and it would be kinder (for both of them) to let John go than keep dragging them both through all of this.
Conclusion: If it was a faked suicide, John must have had a confidante, someone who took care of the details, made sure the plot was plausible. Clara Stoddard was a likely person to handle that.
It sometimes surprised Sherlock that Greg was still his friend. He’d often pushed people away, reasoning that it was better to be alone, not depending on favours from others. He wasn’t a natural extravert and found relationships tiring. In this business, though, contacts were everything. “Thank you.”
“Rosamund.” Ms Morstan was obviously used to her daughter’s defiance and was not having it. “We’ll discuss it at home.” She smiled at us. “I’m sorry to have imposed on you. It won’t happen again.”
Instead of rage, Moriarty’s reaction was to giggle. “Well, every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain. We’re just alike, Sherlock, except I’m not boring. Just wait. You’ll see. I owe you a fall, and I always pay my debts.”
He’ll meet this person, say he’ll think about it, and bow out later. That’s pretty much how he deals with everything now.
He asked John to top because he thought it would be more like the penetrative sex he was used to with women. He knows that for most straight men, their only experience of having a man’s finger up their anus is during a prostate exam. He didn’t want to make John uncomfortable, but he was. It wasn’t an erotic experience for him.
“I shall expect visits to my cell.” Grinning, he began to climb the trellis. I watched, admiring his athletic movements from below, this being the real reason I wanted him to climb. I imagined those strong legs wrapped around me, as they no doubt would be later.
Remembering Paul Harvey, a radio journalist who used to do a segment called "The Rest of the Story."
I've always wanted to write Sherlock and John in the seventies, but so far haven't. This chapter is a completely self-indulgent excuse to have a seventies-themed party. Guaranteed to blow your mind.
It’s pathetic that the single most interesting thing in his life is the bully who outed him to a bunch of sixteen year olds when he was the new kid at school.
I hope I did not disappoint. I loved writing it, but it was harder than I predicted. Usually I have a story almost completely written before I post, and this one was thoroughly outlined, but it changed as I put it down on paper. I hadn't foreseen so much angst.
. It still disappointed him to be remembered first as the alien boy, sleeping in a twin bed, talking in the dark with John—
In a normal universe, if they’d met in maths class or chess club or something, school would have been their last contact.
“She will not believe us, Watson. Hypothetical women may be concerned with truth, but real women do not like having their delusions shattered. It is dangerous to disabuse them.” I tapped the riding crop against my hand. “I would have enjoyed taking this to his hide, but perhaps I can find another use for it now. Watson, be so good as to drop your pants.”
“Then what I have to say tonight will not dismay you, I hope,” she replied. “You and Mycroft are my only heirs under the will drawn up when your father died. I am currently consulting with my solicitor to change that document.”
It’s a simple question with no good answer. Seeing her has affected me more than I thought it would. She was there, and his body was in her morgue. That can’t have been easy for her. She loved him too.
Drawing a deep breath, he spoke his line. “I can’t imagine what my life would have been if that were true.”
I smiled, surer of his feelings. “We’ll stay overnight in a hotel here, have dinner sent up to our room. Then we’ll take a train home in the morning.” I slung his bag over my shoulder, took his arm under mine.
I kiss you. It’s passion, but also hope. When I open my eyes, yours are still shut, as if you’re afraid it’s not real, as if you want to stay there, forever in that kiss.
For some ridiculous reason, the Department of Transport didn’t answer their phone until eight in the morning. When he finally reached a person, he made his request.
“It’s not your fault. And if I had died, it would have been my own stupid fault. I just think about it sometimes, how we almost didn’t happen. If you had died, or if I had.”
In an oddly familiar gesture, she folded her arms and tilted her head to the side. Then she licked her lips and sniffed defiantly. “He’s my dad.”
“Often attributed,” Holmes replies. “I believe Pearl S. Buck said something quite similar. My point is that we don’t settle for the way things have always been. We no longer accept the winners’ version of history. Instead, we value those who might seem to have little value because treating them well makes us better, as a whole.”
Mycroft was no doubt hoping he’d be discouraged by the amount of work and humility needed to succeed, and Sherlock had gone only to prove his tenacity, not with any serious thought that he’d get the part.
Watson smiled modestly. “I am merely a chronicler. My fame rests entirely on the talents of my master.”
“Only when necessary, to achieve some result in the present. There is no point in digging up John Watson’s grave.”
The more I thought about it, the more irritated I became. I had known Watson for an opportunist, and perhaps he had been successful where I had failed. I imagined him having that June wedding, setting up practice, living with his freckled wife, producing a brood of freckled children. He would have no time to pursue mysteries, no interest in me.
Still awake. I don’t look at the clock because that only reminds me of how many hours there are before I have to get up and go through the motions of living.
“No, no— it was so great— sooo great that they just decided to cut to the chase and give me a BAFTA. And an Oscar. Best piece of work I’ve ever done.” He looked around for a bottle of something.
He feels John let out a susurrus of warm breath against him. “Then… let’s plan on that. We still have years of chasing criminals, I think, but it will be something to look forward to… when we’re old and ready for a change. You and me, a cottage, the bees, and a bed.”
“You always say such horrible things.” She gave a shuddering sigh. “Every time. Always. Maybe for you it was a horrible experience being Alex Tribble, but it was the best thing I’ve ever done, and all you do is sneer at it and make everyone feel like losers because we haven’t made movies or had our own series. I loved being Holly Martin. She might have been a stock character, but I played her like a real person. She was
For a moment Sherlock wondered if Mycroft was bugging the flat again. But the bacon did smell good, and he decided that it was all right. He hadn’t forgiven his brother yet, but he’d allow it for now. They would soon have a discussion long overdue.
“Why wouldn’t I? Alex Tribble was never me, but I know how to play a role. I don’t need ghosts to convince an audience that the emotions I’m feigning are real.”
Now a dull panic settled in my gut, imagining him in a land where heathens were eager to kill Englishmen. Watson had run into danger plenty of times for me, and I knew he was neither a fool nor a coward. This did not set my mind at ease, though. A man who has nothing to lose makes reckless choices.
version of himself would have laughed, said that he was married to his work and didn’t have any interest in girlfriends, boyfriends, or just
They sat for a few minutes, silently sipping their tea. Sherlock finally set his cup on the table. If he thought about it, he would be angry. Very angry. He’d save that for later, though.
“We are invited to dinner,” Mycroft told me. “Mother says that you are to bring your protégé as well.” He nodded at Watson. “She reads your stories in the Strand and has requested to meet you.”
I want you in 221B, in the kitchen playing with body parts, in the sitting room complaining about the lack of cigarettes and interesting cases, by the window, playing your violin, in the bedroom, curled up under the blankets and looking oddly young and vulnerable.
“Your friend was really upset,” Matt says, his eyes wide. “I mean, he looked like he was going to rip the place apart.”
“You’re thirty-two years old, Sherlock, an age by which most people have had several experiences in the area of romance. You are a novice. Novices make mistakes, by which they learn and eventually succeed.”
She barks a short laugh. “Yeah, I do. They’re not in good shape, in case you’re thinking they’re worth something.”
? God, what will we even call him? Why is there no word in the English language for two men in love?”
“It isn’t hard,” Holmes replies. “Toasted cheese sandwich and soup at the cafe on Friday, pub on Saturday. You have an unvarying routine. Might want to change it up a bit, just in case someone actually decides to stalk you. Give them a bit of a challenge, you know.”
Our lessons were cancelled one day because Miss Garvey had to be out, and after my breakfast, eaten alone in the nursery, I wandered downstairs to find a book in the library. John was hovering somewhere, I assumed. I would find him later and we would go digging in the woods.
“But you were more like those boys than I was,” Watson points out. “No one made fun of your accent or your manners. No one asked if your father was a bin man or called your mother a whore.”
It might be fun, he thinks. While he doesn’t remember the decade, having been born at the tail end of it, his parents were young then and kept all their albums. Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, the Stones. David Bowie and Elton John. He wonders what happened to all of those old LPs. They probably wouldn’t be worth much today, he guesses. He and Harry used to play them constantly.
Watson stood frozen for a moment, then took the coat off the chair, holding it so the man could slip his arms into the sleeves.
While he listened to the water running and tried not to imagine John naked in his shower, Sherlock made tea. It was really too late for tea, but he couldn’t think of what else to do with himself.
was his first role In his parents’ home. With two dysfunctional parents and a defiant sister, he became by default the one who managed. Dealing with people comes naturally to him, along with a personal radar that warns him when things are about to get ugly. When he goes to crime scenes, he observes a cycle of insult and abuse that bounces between Sherlock and Lestrade’s people, acting and reacting. They clearly resent their consulting detective, not only because he can see the things they miss, but because he isn’t polite about it. Sherlock doesn’t merely lack people skills, he sees no point in them. At the same time, it bothers him. John notices him tensing up the moment they duck under the yellow tape, and can tell that it’s not just anticipation of what they will find. It’s a shield against the unnecessarily rude remarks the Yarders throw at him. They’re like kids in a schoolyard, taunting the outsider. While Lestrade appreciates what Sherlock brings to the scene, he doesn’t do much to rein in their hostile behaviour.
“Oh, my, yes!” said Bellamy. “I’ve read your stories in the Strand, my boy. A very exciting life you lead, for a doctor.”
“This is why you became a doctor. You must help this lady. I will go on ahead and meet you tonight at Rosenlaui.”
“Could be, yeah. He might have given up information about somebody big. In exchange, they let him out early, give him a brand new identity.”
“And my heart goes out to his sister, etc. Everyone knows I don’t have a heart, Mike. I’m not going to pretend—“
Mrs Hudson nearly fainted when she came through the door and saw me standing in the sitting room. Once I’d reassured her that I wasn’t a ghost, and had given her a brief explanation for my continued existence, she greeted me warmly. Since Watson moved in all those years ago, she had often remarked how he had improved my disposition. She has always put up with my
Minutes might have gone by, or hours. He and John simply stood, facing one another, their faces saying everything. John had read his letter. He knew, and he came anyway. He came for Molly, Mike, and Sally, for Greg and Mrs Hudson and Anderson. He came for Sherlock.
As I open the door, I sense that something is different. It’s cold, for one thing. Someone’s been in here. Maybe Mrs Hudson was checking while I was at work, opening the window to air it out, and just forgot to close it. If that were the case, though, the lights from the alley would be flooding into the room. Instead, it’s dark and frigid. I can smell onions, cabbage, and damp. Someone is here; I can hear them breathing.
Removing her gloves, she turned her attention on him. “Charming.” Taking his face in her hands, she said, “A face like this, one might be willing to die for. Or more likely, go to jail for.” She patted his cheek, turned and smiled at me. “This morning I married Godfrey Norton at the Church of St Monica. We intend to live in New York and do not plan to return.”
“Oh, that’s right. You’re a doctor. Well, there’s always jobs for doctors, I suppose.” He laughs awkwardly. “Not like literary agents.”
He’d revealed his secret, offered his regrets. Somehow he’d now have to make peace with John, alive and shut off from his past, as if he were someone Sherlock had never loved.
Instead, he slept in a bedroom upstairs from Holmes last night. Slept well, in fact. Now he’s on a train, going to investigate a case. Things are happening. It’s unexpected and maybe even a little exciting.
He shakes his head. “No more restaurants. That wasn’t me that he met. I don’t even know who I was last night, but it didn’t resemble me at all.”
he reminds himself. John knows he shouldn’t blame Mary, who has shouldered all the parenting for three years now, and before that as well, while he was in med school. Blame is just a tangent at this point. Not helpful.
For another hour, maybe two, I would remain in a no man’s land where both of these possibilities existed. He was mine, he was hers. He was gone, he remained.
“Mr Allen is my research assistant,” Bellamy explained. “We’re looking into the creation of flexible plastic film in photography. If you’d like, come by our lab and he’ll explain it to you.”
, he thinks. “People don’t do that anymore, Daddy. Maybe when you were my age people wore chains and spiked dog collars and painted their rooms black, but nihilism is boring. I was thinking of a mural.”
“I haven’t been here before,” Sherlock says, setting down the menu. “I’ve heard good things about it, though.”
“I’ll still be your biggest fan, though,” Brook went on. “I used to watch Alex Tribble all the time, and I said to myself,
“I wanted to get an idea how much we could ask, if we do sell. This is our house, but you’re not here now. You have a place to live, and I want a place that’s mine, John. I feel like I’m living in the past here.”
I didn’t care what we watched, or if we just sat in silence. I only wanted to be there, the two of us.
Silenced by Holmes’s words, his heart gives a sickly thud. He’s not sure why he thought Holmes wanted to be his friend, and he certainly hasn’t tried to make him one, but hearing his rejection makes Watson feel as if he’s lost a chance he was counting on.
He’s standing on the tarmac, saying goodbye to John. He has kept his vow, killed Magnussen so John and Mary can have the life they want, the life he wants them to have.
“A trial, eventually. Evidence will be gathered, witnesses brought forward and their statements taken. I think now that the spider has been plucked from the web, there will be plenty of people willing to talk. Whether or not your John wants to testify will be up to him.”
The next time he opens his eyes, things are much less agonisingly bright. There are no sirens screaming, no people shouting at him. His brain still feels slow, like someone adjusted his dial, turning him down to low. Not exactly a hung-over feeling (of which he has altogether too much experience). He smells antiseptic and coffee, hears rubber shoes squeaking on the floor, someone being paged.
The choices he’s made in life have been about keeping himself right, not giving in to sentiment, which always disappoints, or love, which hurts. Alone has protected him.
I did live, and I met you. That made me believe that I’d been given another chance. But I never said; I lived, and any more seemed too much to ask.
Maybe he should leave London, too. There’s nothing here for him. Just as when he returned from war, he feels himself at the bottom of something. He doesn’t have the energy to climb out again.
John’s skull grinned at me. I did not see his spirit, but I knew he was hovering somewhere close, probably laughing. Because I had not put it there, I knew he’d resumed his old habit of moving objects.
“I’m not complacent. But I’m not going to let my life be controlled by some crazy person. And I’m not moving in with you.”
He cocked his head. There is no food that Watson will not try, so I had no worry that he would not taste it. The honey was potent; it would only take a little bit.
We walk in Regents Park and to Tesco. We sit and have coffee at a little cafe he used to like. We have dinner one night at Angelo’s.
He’d hated it too, he thought. He longed for a place where he could set the rules, determine where things go. He’d shared a room at Priory with a quiet boy named Edward who was neat, but never let his clothes go to the laundry. He preferred to wait until he could bring it all home to wash, so wore every item over and over. He was also averse to showers, so both he and his clothes grew more pungent over time. Watson never figured it out. He kept his own things neat, tucked away.
“You too, John. Be safe, okay? I don’t mean you should stay away from gay clubs. Just… don’t do anything stupid, okay?”
“Yes, of course. Your task is to pick the lock and, once we are in his study, to open the safe. We will take the papers with us and destroy them later. Let’s get dressed now. We can save the masks until we are in his neighbourhood.”
, he thought. Looking around the room, he wondered if he’d made a mistake flubbing the audition. Donovan had played small parts in several movies and had a recurring role as a judge on a drama series, Anderson had just finished touring with a musical biography of Adam Smith, Father of Modern Economics, and Molly was Gastro-Girl in a series of ads for digestive aids starring the Irregulars— Diarrhoea Dude, Nausea Ned, Connie Stipation… embarrassing, really. He’d done so much better than any of them, except maybe Lestrade, who’d already earned a modest reputation in several period dramas before he was cast in
In the confusion I was able to exit through the front door. I met Watson at the street corner and took him by the arm, quickly walking us away from the house.
“That’s how we met,” Ariel said. “My mum sent me to a new school, and because we had the same name, we became friends and started talking. And she’s my sister.”
There is something in me that cannot be oppressed, no matter where I find myself, something that rises in the face of abuse. As miserable as I felt, as bleak as the future that stretched before me, I would endure. I would find my way in this school and survive. John would want me to do that. I would return to Greenwood and bury his bones.
“I’m just saying…” I pause, drink down half of the beer I’ve been ignoring. “I’m saying that between the time I saw him fall and by the time I got there, someone had turned him on his back. And the direction he was pointed, his head towards the hospital—.”
My father rarely smiled, as I remember. When he lost his second wife, my mother, I hardly saw him at all. He stayed in his study when he was home, or he went out with his gun to shoot vermin. One day he did not come home.
“Disinhibition, and… and… John, stop grinning like that! This is serious. You haven’t been yourself and it’s worried me.”
. I forget who recommended him. He’s tried out for several major parts, but never been successful. I figured that he changed his name to get a fresh start.”
She let out a genuine laugh. “Promise. We’ve got a few candidates, and I’ve got some ideas of my own.”
Watson closes his eyes again, sighs. “Just go away. Leave me alone. Thank you for the beer. I still hate you.”
He stands, whooshes back into his coat, loops his scarf around his neck, and gives Watson a little salute. “Enjoy your evening, Doctor.”
“The footprints,” he said. “I noticed them when they were wrestling me to the ground. The soil was softer on the other side of the fence, and I could clearly see your prints.”
He stares at the key for a while, trying to remember what he’s supposed to do with it. A keyhole, that’s right. He needs a keyhole.
Sleep eludes me, though, even at night, even with the meds. It’s as bad as it was those first weeks. The less I sleep, the harder it is to sleep. I’m overtired, over emotional. Everything that I’d managed to conceal under a facade of sanity begins leaking out. I close my eyes, and all I can see is Sherlock, on the sidewalk. I thought he was dead, but I was wrong. He’s opening his eyes and looking at me, pleading with me to help him.
Watson finds Holmes later. He’s cleaned and bandaged the boy’s neck and taken him to the Headmaster’s office to wait for his parents to arrive. He brings tea and a sandwich for Holmes, who hasn’t taken a break from questioning the boys, and insists that he take a few moments to bring Watson up to speed.
The movement of the train was lulling, and he was just beginning to relax a bit when a feeling came over him. He opened his eyes. Someone across the aisle was looking at him in a way that said he’d been spotted. It happened fairly often these days.
At this point, the Yarders arranged an engagement party for them. Mycroft and Lestrade planned the stag do.
When he joined the army, he was prepared to listen and take orders. Giving orders wasn’t so hard in that setting, either. He’d never seen himself as a leader, but found that he could put on a persona when he had to. Captain Watson wasn’t a talker, but he wasn’t shy, either.
“If you won’t let me see Watson, take me to the house. Let me examine the crime scene before your men trample every bit of evidence.”
I brought it to his mouth. He opened and accepted the morsel. For a few seconds he closed his eyes, perhaps trying to categorise the taste. Eyes still closed, he smiled. “Sultry,” he said. “Almost… sensual. Like perfume. Or incense.”
From his bearing I easily deduced that he was military. The dysfunctional family didn’t bother me in the least, my own family being far from a model of functionality. Who doesn’t have an alcoholic or debt-ridden relative? My own brother, though neither alcoholic nor in debt, is an interfering prick who puts surveillance in my flat while I’m out buying milk. (Now that I think about it,
“Yeah, I was. It was great. I felt like I’d been settling for tepid sex for years and finally realised what I wanted. I guess it was sort of fast, though. Maybe it was the adrenaline from the case. I don’t know.”
Holding his reaction in check, he kept his voice even. “We acted in the same idiotic show for several years. He became famous, and I went to Cambridge. He killed himself, and I became an addict.”
He has work today, and fixes breakfast for himself. He just makes toast because he’s not sure if Sherlock is going to get up and wonder why John didn’t make him some eggs, too. He munches his toast silently, sipping his tea.
Here is what’s not easy to live with, that Sherlock is sometimes so deep inside his own mind that he doesn’t think to notify other people when he’s putting himself in danger. John can’t help reacting to this: he’s a caregiver, a doctor who has seen most of the ways people can be seriously injured, even when they’re not chasing criminals. He’s seen people die in freak accidents. Too many, enough for a lifetime. And he’s a soldier. His job is to protect people. To protect Sherlock.
You look out the window again. “I have to keep you safe. A world without you in it is… unacceptable.”
Mrs Hudson was soon up with our breakfast on a tray, on which she had also perched a letter. As soon as I saw the typewritten address, I knew who it was from.
“You wouldn’t do it because you believe in justice more than you trust the law. You felt your actions in saving my life were justified, but would not be believed by the police. And you’re a romantic, so you invented a damsel to save. Not so very hard to deduce. It’s exactly the kind of story that would draw in readers.”
Sherlock frowns at the waiter. “I think my companion would prefer it cooked through, medium. I’ll have the same.” He opens the wine menu, and after a brief discussion says, “The Semillon, if it’s not too dry. Bring us some bread. And water, please.”
“Do not ask,” she said, pulling the comb painfully through a tangle. “You may hate it here, but there are far worse places for children— workhouses and orphanages. Now, hush. Your aunt is asking for you to be sent to the library at once. Look smart, and hold your tongue unless you are asked a question. Do not argue or carry on in your usual fashion.”
Sherlock nods, ignoring everything outside of our little bubble. “He had three snipers, one of whom would have shot you if I hadn’t jumped. And even now, I can’t be sure you’re safe until I’ve unraveled his web, taken out all threats.”
Before he can fall into irretrievable sappiness, the bell rings. His heart speeds up in anticipation, but It’s too soon for John to be back. Travel time added to the necessary conversation John will have with Mary and his daughter— he estimates ninety minutes.
Charles remains silent, but the knife has moved away from the other boy’s throat. He nods. Holmes holds out his hand and the boy passes the knife over.
Sherlock’s eyes widen and he takes a step towards John. He raises his hand towards the scar, asks permission with a look. John nods.
Something is out there in the water. A small boat, perhaps. No sail. The water can get choppy out there, even when it seems calm. He watches, wondering.
It’s something he’s had to get used to and generally ignores. But he always feels a little prick of annoyance and shame when it happens. He’s a judgmental person himself, but it’s mostly defensive when he calls Anderson an idiot or deduces how Sally spent last night. It’s childish, and he hates it, but ignoring it hasn’t been a solution either.
She leaned towards him and smiled almost as if she were trying to seduce him. “You,” she said, “and John Watson.”
“Well,” he said. From nostalgic fan to obsessive fanatic in thirty-seconds. Next, she’d be asking him—
“And let people assume that we’re business partners, no more? Or will you give a suggestive wink when you say it so they’ll know what you mean?”
I thought of some other adjectives, but did not give them voice. “And what is the occasion of this command performance?” I asked. “I have faithfully put in an appearance at every Christmas dinner and on her birthday. I hardly see a reason to spend more time in her presence.”
The kiss eventually happened, but not as I had imagined. We had just returned to Baker Street after a day of fairly boring casework, and John, hanging up his coat by the door, was giggling at something I’d said.
Her husband is dying of cancer; she talks about that long goodbye. She knows Death intimately; its victims have come through her morgue. It’s better to know you’re dying, she tells him, better for the people left behind to have that time to say goodbye.
Watson has never been able to separate his mind from his passions. During the times they have been together, it has been their mutual passion that kept them steady. But the last time, Watson had had enough of finding and losing. And Holmes still hadn’t solved the mystery.
Pulling back suddenly, Sherlock frowns at him. “You’re delirious. You don’t know what you’re doing.”
“Well, read it to me, then,” I said. “I deduce from your expression that she has figured out her step-father’s ruse.”
All humans sleep, but not like this. The times he’s been in stasis, it’s been like a blank space. When he wakes, there is a moment when he doesn’t feel the length of it. That’s part of the restoration process, learning whether it’s been a day or a thousand days.
Maybe Holmes has predicted this moment, Watson waiting for a friend who can’t be bothered to text, saying he’s changed his mind and would rather stay home watching repeats of
I swallowed the last of my port and set my glass down. “Read Mr Symond’s book. I think you’ll find all the enlightenment you need in his pages.” I walked towards the door without looking back. “Good night, Mr Hughes.”
She smiled. “I’m sure all the publicity from the reunion can’t hurt any of your careers. You’ll be done filming the series in a couple months. What’s next for you both? Any movies?”
“True. What I mean is, I never thought of it for other reasons as well. I never thought I’d meet someone like you. Or that a person like you even existed. And I made up my mind that whatever I didn’t know about you yet would be fine. Your nine daughters, and many as of yet uncounted daughters, fall into that category: things I wasn’t aware of then, but now know, which are all fine.”
Existence will continue, but the life he built for himself has been destroyed. All is lost. Soon he will be arrested, charged with the death of James Moriarty. He will be sentenced to life in prison, outlive the prison that confines him, and become a mystery to be solved. He will be studied, like a specimen.
The way Brook delivered his lines was as if every sentence was a joke that he wanted to make sure the audience got. He did all but dig his elbow into the sides of the people he was addressing.
“Why wait? I know that I am an acquired taste, Watson, and cannot expect her to be dazzled by me for long. I must move quickly. So, tonight it is.”
There was no knock at the door; it simply opened, revealing an ascetic-looking man, tall and pale, peering at us with great curiosity.
And it could not be a lack of money that made the school so miserable. I had seen Mr Grimshaw and his daughters at church on Sundays. They were plump and finely dressed, their souls apparently safe from the temptations of sufficient food and a warm bed. We suffered because poor children must be threatened, not coddled. It was ironic that the poor, whom Jesus always reminded us were to be cared for, were treated as if poverty were a judgement on their souls.
“Oh, Victor,” I said, throwing my arms around him. “You are a much better person than I am. Everyone should love you as much as I do.”
His leg aches all the way home, the strange encounter lying on him like a weight that makes every step a struggle. While retreating back to his horrible bedsit isn’t exactly a move forward, it’s better than reliving one of the most humiliating experiences of his life.
cliche), would live much longer than humans, which meant that Alex was just out of infancy, an innocent now finding his way in a complex society. Of course, he was much smarter than a human, and his race much more advanced in terms of technology. He would learn their language in one day, excel at all the subjects his school mates struggled with, and regularly spout information about astrophysics, at which everyone would goggle. His strangeness would attract the attention of bullies, which would provide a cliche conflict. When he pointed this out to the writers, they explained that young teens feel like aliens because of hormonal changes and sudden growth spurts, and would identify with Alex’s quest to understand his new world.
Lestrade shrugged. “I admit that I was underwhelmed. That bloke— Rich Brook— he’s got to go. I thank god I have a small part. Maybe people will forget who I am.”
“I’m only trying to spare you both. And I would not be so concerned if you were merely dating him. You have complicated matters, though, by inviting him to be your flatmate. It’s a bad idea. You have no clear path of retreat if it doesn’t work.”
He watches Sherlock paging through the book, a small smile curling his lips. He has odd obsessions, John has noted, and it’s endearing how he throws himself into certain subjects. He loves knowledge, loves books and music and reason and order. He loves unraveling things, solving puzzles. This is what fills him with life. This is what it looks like— Sherlock in love.
Sherlock pulls John towards him, his lips hovering over John’s. “There are other things we could do together.”
men in a series like ours. Having gay characters who are just people, with real interests and problems beyond their sex lives— that would be revolutionary.”
He shrugged. “Then I’m afraid I’ll have to kill you. You have become a thorn in my side, and I do not tolerate irritations. It’s not a crime to shoot a burglar, you know. I shall tell the police that I surprised you in my study, a masked man armed with a pistol. Fearing for my life, I fired, unfortunately killing you. Obviously I had no idea who you were. I was merely protecting myself from an armed criminal. You did bring a weapon, did you not? Put it on the floor, if you please. I shall not hesitate to shoot you if you so much as think of turning it on me.”
Lost in thought, I was startled when strong arms grabbed me from behind and a rough voice whispered in my ear.
He did mention it one evening when they were discussing what movie to watch. Sherlock was vetoing every suggestion he made, appalled at John's taste in cinema.
“Yes,” he says. “I didn’t mean to snipe. It’s just upsetting that the boy wouldn’t tell us anything.”
“Do stop babbling, Watson. We are both single gentlemen and have no need to clarify our position with one another. Continue. You are hypothetically writing a love letter to an entirely imaginary woman.”
Victor did not respond, so I continued my complaint. “Do you see how he singles out the weakest boys for punishment? You are not wicked; it was an accident that you dropped your slate. Why, I have seen Mr Anders drop his book before, and he drops his pencil nearly every day! Is it not unjust that he berates us for faults and refuses to acknowledge his own?”
“It isn’t the same. Those are things you can disprove. You can get good marks, learn to do things that require coordination. You can’t learn not to be gay.”
“You didn’t lock the door. I suppose you think you have nothing worth stealing, but you’re assuming that robbery is the only reason to use a deadbolt.”
He leans against the worktop, staring at them both. Sherlock pours him a cup of tea and puts it in his hands, giving him a meaningful look. It’s fond, and sorry, and
Victor was an unusually patient boy. He never fidgeted when Mr Anders was talking about Hell or making us do multiplication. I used to watch him during lessons, hoping to be inspired by his example. While I was desperately trying to keep my eyes open, he was looking at our teacher as if he were telling the most fascinating story.
Tonight would not be like that, though. There would be a live audience and a stage, but it didn’t feel the same. The fans would cheer, and he would join hands with his cast-mates and bow, but there would be an empty spot beside him. He wished for the umpteenth time that he hadn’t agreed to do this. Even knowing that John was alive, or maybe because of that, it felt deeply wrong.
The solution of this interesting mystery gave me no joy. In my darkest moments, I wished that Moran’s bullet had found me. I kept the wax double to remind me that I still had a duty to find Watson and bring him home. I could not rest until I knew what had become of him.
“Of course. I am no blackmailer, Mr Holmes. I did love him, and I was angry when I heard of his engagement. But I am not vengeful. I will not publish the photograph.” She turned to smile at Watson. “You lovely thing,” she said, taking his chin in her hand. “Do be careful of this man.” Then she kissed him on the cheek.
Just as Holmes has billed himself as a consulting detective, willing to solve mysteries, Moriarty advertises a different skill set: he creates mysteries, for a price. A consulting criminal.
“Yes. I changed the sheets yesterday and made it up. She won’t let me tidy the room, but I always put clean sheets on the bed. They were still tucked. She hadn’t pulled the bedding open.”
Once he was down on the street, he looked up at the window of John’s flat. A light was on and he could see a silhouette at the window, looking down.
The cop nods. “But we know why he failed this time.” He glances at Watson and grins. “How are you feeling, Doctor Watson?”
When Mum left, things became worse. Like dominoes toppling, any routine their life might have had collapsed. He hadn’t realised until then that life was so precarious, that the things he’d taken for granted were balanced just so, and it would only take a small thing to knock it all into a pile of rubble.
He was speechless for a moment, and I could see that my argument had convinced him of something. Unfortunately, it was not what I had hoped.
A servant girl named Adelaide had come down with diphtheria in 1823, Bessie said. From there it spread through the house, infecting almost everyone, children and adults alike. This interested me because my mother had died of diphtheria. I was four then, and remembered being kept away from her when she fell ill.
The trustees of the school had made inquiries after the deaths and found the school wanting, the building cold and the children malnourished. Mr Grimshaw remained, but now, inexplicably, there was money for better food, warmer blankets, and new teachers. The entire building was scrubbed and repainted from top to bottom, and even the teachers seemed less miserable. For us boys, it felt almost like heaven.
Now I recognise that it’s Baker Street. Our flat is just a few paces away. There will be a fire in the hearth, the kettle on the hob. John is smiling as I approach.
He was ready to let fear go. Ready to stop holding back, to take a chance on Sherlock Holmes, whoever he would be now. Ready to love John Watson, whatever that would mean.
It’s been over a year now, and I’m sleeping better. I bike to work most days, if the weather cooperates. At night I walk, sometimes for hours if sleep won’t come. If I’m tired enough, I can sleep. And I’m not drinking, not really. Putting myself to sleep with alcohol means I’ll be fuzzy the next day at work. I’ve had too many sick days. If it becomes a regular thing, I won’t be able to keep my job. I don’t want to go back to aimless days of sitting on the sofa, watching whatever’s on the telly.
Greg huffs an exasperated sigh. “Since he’s never been with a man before, he’s unsure of how to be with you. He’s
Trying to get up, his attacker falls flat. If he gets up again, Watson won’t be able to restrain him. He rolls on top of him, hitting him in the groin with his knees. One hand is almost free now. A final head-butt and his attacker stops moving.
the audience that she hasn’t gotten over him. She’s a single mother trying to raise twins alone. It creates sympathy for her character.”
Mycroft sends over provisions, the biscuits Sherlock likes and a special soup the chef at the Diogenes makes, and Mrs Hudson bakes something every day. There’s more food in the flat than two grown men can possibly eat, but we try our best. Sherlock’s appetite picks up as the days go by.
He laughed. “Don’t be afraid of it,” he said. “It takes practice. I think you are a boy who has the patience to learn things, if you really want to learn.”
“So, someone has been murdering people chosen at random, in random ways, and painting a random sign near their bodies. Why?”
“I have told you what I saw. You are an honest man, Lestrade. I have seen you bring justice for many victims. You believe in the law’s ability to find the criminal and bring a just sentence on him. But you would be the last one to condemn a man— or woman— without evidence.”
Restless, Holmes sits in the chair opposite, folds his hands to keep them still. He’s not sure what he’ll do when Watson leaves again. That must not happen.
“She hates us both equally, then. It does not matter what we achieve; until one of us produces an heir, we are both failures.”
“A month?” Molly’s mouth was open. She looked like she might either squee and jump up and down, or vomit on her shoes.
Having been called out, I slipped off the window seat and stepped from behind the curtains. “What do you want?”
“Seemed fitting. We were engaged before you went to Afghanistan, married when you got out of hospital. We had our sex holiday in Greece, if your nurse asks. You loved Delphi. Navel of the world. And the villa in Corfu, well, I think don’t think we’ll ever forget that night. Do you need more detail?” He smirks, but Watson can see that his cheeks are glowing.
When I returned to the flat, John was standing, staring at nothing, a dazed look on his face. It was as if he had just realised something.
He sometimes doesn’t give Molly the credit she deserves. She’s not an idiot. Her observational skills are above average when it comes to people, both living and dead. As soon as she sees Sherlock flounce into the morgue, she frowns in concern.
He’s working so hard on how to begin this, that he doesn’t notice John rising from his chair and standing in front of him, leaning over him.
What I didn’t expect was Emma. As soon as I saw her, I knew that it would have been better to have Aunt Kitty mete out judgment.
There’s a card on the floor, something that fell out of the mail when he was sorting through it. A business card. He picks it up and reads.
He is late. He didn’t want to splurge on a cab, but Mike insisted that he take the cash he pressed into his hand.
There never was a more difficult man to pick out a gift for than Sherlock Holmes, John reflected. Having made it through Christmas (special order silk shirts) and his birthday (dinner and concert tickets), his relief was short-lived when he remembered that Valentine’s Day was approaching.
In truth, John has thought about the awkwardness of this moment, stopping back at the cafe after the
“Do you have any idea how big an idiot you are?” The voice of Sherlock Holmes. John can feel his breath on his ear.
Sherlock leans over John and presses a chaste kiss to his lips. “Good night, love,” he says softly. “Sweet dreams.”
The scene ended with Alex leaving to search for Jason, and Mr Smith, along with Holly and Neil, going to free Mrs Hudson.
“That means a lot to me,” she said. “You’re a really good actor. It matters to me what you think but you never say anything nice, so I was worried. I was afraid you’d say no and then we couldn’t do the reunion. But you didn’t. So… I’m glad.”
He did get clean, though, not only because Mummy cried and Mycroft forced him into rehab, but because he had an idea of what he wanted to do with his life. Not piracy, not knight-errantry, but solving puzzles.
He’s never thought of himself this way, but maybe that’s been his problem. He remembers the heady rush of dating, meeting someone new and imagining a future together. Now he thinks he knows what the problem was; he expected too much from women who seemed to provide what he was seeking. He’d done that with Mary, thinking that his doubts were just a normal part of the process. The chemistry was never there, and he thought he could create it by thinking himself into the relationship. And then, before he’d figured it out, they were parents, already drowning in responsibilities. The army was an escape from all that.
It was a beautiful moment. Everyone thought he was acting, but it was real; he could pretend John was his friend as long as John was Jason. He had some offers while he was doing the show, and might have turned down the contract when it was time to renew it, but he stayed because John stayed.
“Of course he did,” Holmes drawls, sounding bored. “A sociopathic serial killer is not going to call himself
I haven’t been to Barts since that day, but he wants to see Molly, so we go. We stand on the spot where he fell, and I feel tears fill my eyes. His arms around me, he holds me, murmuring,
I’m looking into the dairy case when I hear a familiar voice. It’s Molly Hooper. Well, it’s been a long time. Since the funeral, I’ve seen all the expected people, even Mycroft. But I haven’t seen Molly, and I’m just now thinking how strange that is.
He drops the cigarette and steps on it, twisting his foot to put it out. A woman glares at him as she passes. Glancing at Watson, he picks up the butt and puts it in a trash receptacle, then steps towards the street and waves down a cab.
“Holmes!” I heard his voice, shouting rather loudly in my ear, and felt his hand on my face. “Are you all right?”
John gasped, unsure what his next move should be. He felt breathless, as if he’d just run up several flights of stairs, flushed as if he’d just come out of a sauna, and aroused beyond belief.
Holmes gives him a look he can’t interpret. He’s obviously weary after the long night, maybe uncomfortable after sitting in a chair at Watson’s side for hours, annoyed that Watson can’t remember anything, and something else. In his eyes he can see a barely suppressed excitement. “The last one was eviscerated.”
As they read the scene, Sherlock noted Irene drawing her pencil across lines of the script. He smiled.
“You don’t admit it, but you are. I can tell just by looking at you. It was your idea to kill gay men because you don’t like thinking you’re attracted to them. You look for men like you, who are unsure.”
“Yeah, I guess. There was a year or so when I dated women and actually thought about getting married, but then I realised I was deluding myself. That’s when I joined the army.”
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow. “Isn’t that what a blind date is? The entire concept of dating people is experimental. We have an hypothesis that we will be compatible in some way. We test this by spending time together. We observe the results and draw conclusions.” He shakes his head. “I’m sorry if that sounds rather clinical, but this is how my brain works.”
An angry huff, and he’s in the room, glaring daggers. Seeing Watson awake, his expression softens. “How do you feel?”
I won’t call Stamford. There’s one pill left in the bottle, and I will hold on to it. I might need to see Sherlock one more time, imagine him alive. What that means is something I can’t think about. I won’t think about it. I’ll keep the pill, but I won’t take it. If I did, he would really be gone, the dreams over. I can’t think about that.
In the dream, the driver hadn’t spoken at all. He simply waited, as if expecting Sherlock to ask something.
“Cut?” said Molly, finding her voice. “But we need all the backstory for new viewers. A lot of kids will be seeing this for the first time.”
I met many more ghosts at Cambridge, and because learning their stories took much of my time, I eventually made the decision to leave my studies and move to London. I already knew all there was to know about anatomy and physiology, and realised that the answers I sought would not be found in living bodies, or even the cadavers I dissected.
“Hawke has had several relationships with women,” Lestrade said. “I suppose that would make him bi if they write us in a relationship. I’d almost like to see them write it, just for the challenge of acting it.”
Maybe it’s better, a part of him suggests. If they’d carried on pretending, eventually Sherlock would have lost interest. He’d forget John. Better to leave now, with some of his dignity still intact.
Sometimes, he thinks, it would be an advantage to be able to lie fluently. Telling the truth only brings more questions he can’t answer. He doesn’t want to talk about this, but he’s not a natural liar.
I thought of declining, but the delight on Watson’s face was unmistakeable. “Of course. Shall we go to Simpsons in the Strand?”
He blushed. “What were you looking for, anyway? We might have got away sooner if you hadn’t looked at every one of those bloody packets.”
Maybe John is a knight errant, too. But he dates women, and though he demonstrates chivalry in a way Sherlock has never mastered, he will undoubtedly find someone to marry one day. That is his biological imperative.
“On the contrary, I think you’re a very guarded person. But you don’t like that about yourself. You see it as a flaw.”
“Well, I am.” She gestured at the candle, the wine, the entire ambience of the restaurant. “And look at us both. It doesn’t matter what John was. You felt something for him. How you still feel about him is colouring this little production.”
I’d never actually looked at my situation in this way. Once I saw my cousin’s taunting as jealousy, it was easier to bear.
Watson was at Barts, doing his rounds, and I was reading an article about the Bertillon System of physical identification. One physical marker, fingerprints, was superior, he claimed.; even identical twins do not share the same whorls on their finger pads. I was remembering a case I’d once had involving identical twins, where that system might have proved useful. In that case, one twin had killed the other and taken his identity, having learned his signature well enough to forge it. It was his twin’s wife that spotted the difference, a small scar on his lower abdomen. One day, the author claimed, police departments would keep records of the fingerprints of all criminals.
He felt wrong-footed, called-out when Holmes said it, but now he feels almost as if he’s allied himself with an enemy just to spite him.
He heard the steps and it was already too late. Something hit him in the head, and he went down, more from the shock than from the force of the blow.
Sherlock sighs and looks away. His eyes land on the empty cups, and in what might be a rare act of domesticity, he picks them up and carries them into the kitchen.
“Sure. We also have nosy mothers who tell us what to do. And Ariel said that you and John are the GOAT.”
The man is looking for a flatmate, obviously, and that is why he is here. This morning, when Sherlock said he must be a difficult person to find a flatmate for, Stamford smiled. And now here he is, potential flatmate in tow.
wood, something that wouldn’t look so heavy, but they couldn’t afford the ones she chose. He agreed to paint the old ones instead. She chose a colour he called beige; she called it
They might never have met again. He might have walked on after greeting Mike, never got into a discussion about flats. Sherlock might have been equally unhappy to see John. They might have walked away from each other and never come together. John might still be cautiously limping around, trying to figure out his life. Maybe he would have gone to the Rock Garden that night. Maybe he’d be dead now, in that alley where the number four was painted on the side of the building.
He waited in a room at the Diogenes Club. Mycroft no doubt had wars to start, assassinations to arrange, but Sherlock showing up here was so unusual that there was no doubt he’d make time to talk with him. Nor was there any doubt that by the time Mycroft crossed the threshold, he would already have guessed why Sherlock was here.
“The person I sleep with every night, with whom I have sex, just introduced me to his ex as if I were someone he shares the rent with, not a bed. How am I supposed to react? I don’t go around announcing my orientation, but I would not hesitate to tell anyone that you’re my lover.”
Mrs Hudson follows them up, chattering about the building’s history. The stairs take all of Watson’s energy and concentration, so he doesn’t pay much attention.
And then what? Would they begin a divorce war, each of them sharing horror stories with the Yard, tearfully storming out of crime scenes, serving papers on each other?
“As do I. Unfortunately, we don’t get a say in it. In agreeing to do this reunion, I’ve got a two year contract and a raise to live up to.”
John asks about cases. Sherlock tells him all the criminals have taken a holiday. It’s not true, but he needs to be in the flat with John, observing him, looking for abnormal behaviours, not running into alleys. On his spreadsheet he has marked the
He considered the man before him. John truly hadn’t grown an inch since Sherlock last saw him, but he’d filled out a bit. The face had lost its youthful roundness, the jaw squarer now. The eyes were the same, though, a dark blue that almost looked brown from a few steps away. Those eyes were looking at him with anger, confusion, and something else.
But the things he enjoys doing are not everyone’s cup of tea. He likes playing his violin, but that doesn’t allow for much conversation. He enjoys chemistry, doing experiments. That requires extreme concentration. Again, not much talking. A concert might be a possibility, if he chooses the right kind of music. Does John like classical music? He has no idea.
“A cup of…” The handsome barista frowned, his cupid’s bow mouth creating a charming moue. “Starts with T… let me see.” He looked up at the menu board.
“Not even if that were possible,” Sherlock said. “In any event, we will play our parts as they are written. If there are innuendos, you can credit the writers.”
I was sitting out of the way of the dancing, in a corner where it looked like I wouldn’t be bothered, watching Watson and the ladies. Obviously he is a good-looking man, one whom women cannot help but notice. Fortunately, I am not a jealous man. Once home, I would have some fun taking that perfect suit off of him and having his attention all to myself.
Sherlock leans in, inhaling as if he can simply breathe John into his lungs, pressing against him as if he can absorb him through his skin. “I have another idea.”
The beard, another artifice. And the cap, pulled down to his eyebrows. He thought people might recognise him and wanted to avoid that. And when Sherlock got in his cab, he had to be careful not to reveal himself.
“So,” John says when they break away to look at one another. He’s smiling, a genuine, happy smile, and Sherlock prays he will see that smile every day now, maybe even forever. “This?”
“Of course you are,” she says. “You say mean things because you’re defensive. Words slip out because subconsciously you want to drive people away. You never let anyone close enough to see the real you.”
How old is their child? They were at uni when they met, he said, so maybe she’s a teenager. Lestrade has a teenaged daughter and says it’s the worst.
“Mike,” he said. “I’m not going to have a breakdown. I’m not going to slip back into bad habits and need another rehab adventure. I’m going to do my part, hope that my costars appreciate my effort, and that my agent will get me some not-boring scripts to read. That’s all.”
We had arrived. I paid the driver and followed Watson inside. Once upstairs, he poured us each a tot of brandy and we settled into our chairs.
behaviours: the endearments, the hair-petting, and a few times when John has patted his shoulder in passing, and the time he smiled at him for no reason. He thanks Sherlock more than usual, it seems, but without any baseline data from before, it’s difficult to assess the
He shuddered. Fans might be obsessive, but there was a line. Sherlock was used to having his picture taken, and normally didn’t mind. Like the woman on the train, most fans were harmless.
“Yes, at a local surgery.” His answer is terse, clipped, and he hope it signals that he has no desire to talk.
Would he go? He hadn’t decided. As a rule he didn’t attend social functions unless absolutely necessary. But these were the kids he’d grown up with, people he had considered friends, inasmuch as he’d ever had friends. After his bad behaviour last time, he was pretty sure that no one wanted to see him again. But Molly had called him and, in a regrettable moment of weakness, he’d said he could probably be there.
“If you are correct, he is a bounder.” Watson frowned. “I shall throw him down the stairs if he becomes insulting.”
“As I said, you never answered my question. Now you have, of course. I could leave, but that sandwich looks good. Never tried the toasted cheese here. Do you recommend it?”
The following day, Watson had two lectures to attend. When he returned home in the early afternoon, I hustled him back down to the street and hailed us a cab.
There was a cabbie named Jason Bradford driving around London. This cabbie may or may not have been the one who picked him up that night. A picture of the man was needed, and an address. He would challenge his fantasy, track down the man, see that he was a bald, paunchy, middle-aged man who was not the John Watson he knew. And he would stop thinking about him.
The envelope had been opened, I noted. Of course, it was addressed to my brother, and he had naturally read it. With trembling hands, I reached for it.
Miss Ashton-Farbridge might be romantic, as women tend to be, but she had reasons to be practical as well. At her age, she would worry that if she passed up one offer, another would not be forthcoming. By now she had certainly realised that romance fades, but money in the bank can provide a bulwark against misfortune. Clearly, she could not refuse a man like me, intelligent, successful, and able to provide her with security.
who may one day get bored solving crimes and decide to murder someone for fun, John has already made up his mind. He has never seen an intellect like Sherlock’s in action, never felt so alive himself, and he completely understands why Scotland Yard treats him with disdain. Of course he seems like a freak to them; all they know is procedure; they don’t know what
He looks around at the crowd. A mixed group of people. One table looks like an office gathering, men and women in business attire. A few are regulars, he can tell.
“Having a reunion at all is a bad idea,” said Sherlock. “Remember, you heard it from me first. I refused, said no, and let myself be talked into it against my better judgment. But there’s no going back now. Molly says that they’re revising the script. Maybe it’ll be good.” He grinned.
Her laugh is easier now. “I haven’t thought about that in a long time. We used to dance like idiots. I used my hair brush as a mic, and you played air guitar. I guess that what happens to kids whose parents put them to sleep at night with Judas Priest.”
“You don’t pay me.” He laughed. “We’re partners, remember? You solve the mysteries, I cash the cheques and pay our expenses, and we live off the rest.”
I meet Greg at a pub one evening. We play darts and talk about football. He’s seeing his ex-wife, but thinks it’s a bad idea. I listen, sympathise, and say nothing about Sherlock.
“A week?” I considered whether I might not be bored with this agenda. Perhaps there would be a murder, if I chose the venue well, or at least a burglary. “Very well. I will do as you say. But you will not win. I have never see a marriage where one partner did not gain financially.”
“We have a motive,” he announced proudly. “Milverton was blackmailing him. Since the envelope was addressed to you, Mr Holmes, I assume you know what errand your boy was on.”
I could not help but notice, however, how he subtly encouraged these women. I could not catch every word of his conversation, but he had only sat out one dance, and there were at least a dozen women whom he had promised. The night stretched ahead of me, suddenly feeling very long. I contented myself with watching him, noting how effortlessly he moved, how his suit pants, more narrowly cut than his day pants, flattered his figure.
“Fortunately, he rethought his position,” Sherlock said. “The next time I saw him was on stage. No bat.”
Now, however, that’s not a good idea. In fact, it’s a very bad idea, and he’s not sure how to head this off before it becomes awkward. Maybe it already has.
Tilting his face up, John brought their lips together. Sherlock relaxed into the kiss, his mind going blank. He was aware of John’s body, his arms pulling him in, his legs pressing against Sherlock’s. And he became aware, too, that John was aroused.
“He was sitting right next to me. Tall, long legs. Dark hair… he looked at me… actually, he looked… sort of like you.”
He smiles and shrugs, sips his Slow Screw. “I just always notice the drummer. Wanted to play guitar, though.”
“You and I’ve done well. So has Sally. Molly’s had a few small roles as well. And advertising can provide a steady income. There are actors who make a living just doing that. Some of them are even famous.”
“It would be sensible to assume they are still following us,” I said as we watched the coast of England recede. “Did you see the morning papers? They set fire to our flat.”
. He hadn’t really expected Sherlock to agree that they’d go to Yorkshire; all he’d hoped for in that moment was to get under his skin a bit, maybe even make him lose his temper.
My youthful experiences were still vivid in my mind; I often saw ghosts as I walked the streets and byways of the university town. I did not mention these to anyone because I knew that the ridicule that followed would doom any study I eventually published. Odd I most certainly was; a madman I was not. I was a scientist; I waited, gathering evidence.
He smiled. “I do. You are not singular, Sherlock. Our father was like you, and yet he managed to sire two sons with our mother.”
Stasis is to be avoided, when possible. Holmes has been in that state many times, accidentally or on purpose, trying to see what might lie beyond. The vulnerability of the state is not dying, but discovery. A human body neither dead nor alive seems to defy science. Well, it does in fact defy it, and that is a conundrum Holmes has never solved.
He owns the Baker Street building and moves back in without changing much. The plumbing and electric have been modernised, but those are the only nods to the twenty-first century. He calls his new landlady Mrs Hudson, even though she insists she’s Mrs Turner.
I found him hovering over a spot on the edge of the woods, covered by grass. I had played here many times. Now I felt, rather than saw, what lay under the grass.
The footage begins with the alley empty, but soon the back door of the bar opens into the alley and they see Watson, stumbling under the arm of a taller man. They’re both just distant silhouettes in the darkness, one tall, one shorter.
As he fell asleep, I could already see the signs of age falling from his features. The deep wrinkles smoothed out and the hair became blonder, thicker.
“I’m not— I’ve spent years trying to solve this mystery. You’ve evidently figured it out. I just want to know, one scientist to another, how does it work? Is it something genetic? He and I were born around the same time, though in different places. So maybe a mutation of some sort. I imagine you’re as old as we are.”
“It’s misery either way,” he said. “And I know you’d prefer to sit here in your undergarments than come all the way to my rooms.”
“Oh, right. That’s what you do, don’t you? Mike said you’re a detective.” He looks up as the waiter hands the wine menu to Sherlock.
“What do they say?” John was looking at him now, his dark blue eyes even darker in the shade of the towering trees.
I said nothing, but raised my hands, thinking of Watson, wondering if he had made it to the fence. When he heard the shot, surely he would go over the fence and run for safety.
He gives a one-shouldered shrug. “Who’d want me as a flatmate?” It’s the same question he asked Stamford. Maybe she can dig up another old enemy for him to obsess about.
All of that is gone now, three years later. She’s had it done recently; it still smells a bit like wood shavings. The walls are painted now, a blue-grey colour that probably has a fancy name. Here are rustic grey wood cabinets with dark pewter hardware, a matching table and chairs, and some kind of decorative cupboard displaying stoneware dishes. He supposes this looks less tacky than what they had, but he’d been proud of his work. It was his gift to her. He’d felt guilty about going away and wanted her to have something nice. Seeing this feels like rejection.
“I am already able to read and write, and to do sums and minuses as well.” I was as familiar with the scripture as any eight year old, I suppose, but considered that book something like fiction. “I will read whatever books you give me, though I should like to read more of Mr Shakespeare’s stories. And any books of nature and science.”
When he pushes Sherlock up against the wall, grabs his shoulders, leans in and kisses him, there are no words. It’s not a good kiss, not what he intended at all. It’s messy and aggressive and deranged, like a sex-starved teenager on his first date. He’s been told he’s actually quite a good kisser, and might have used that to his advantage, but he’s already got his lips on Sherlock’s, his tongue thrusting into his mouth, and it’s too late for romantic. It’s possessive, angry, lustful, frustrated. It’s
He shook his head. “My mother wanted me to return home. She hoped I would be a teacher at the village school. I will do that because she wished it.”
“I’ve run away,” Ariel said. “I’m going to live with you now.” She turned to me. “Are you his boyfriend?”
when he peed on the floor or chewed up the mail. She always has funny stories to tell people, most of them about John as a baby. Since he’s six years younger than his sister, he assumes that things were different back in the days before he was old enough to remember anything.
Only he is, in fact, killing himself. That’s what the bottles are for. A sneaky way to kill himself without anyone noticing, just a bit every week, life ebbing out of him, leaving only a hollow rage.
Watson nodded. “Very well. If it takes you out of danger, I will go. What should our destination be?”
Setting the photo aside, he finds his old chemistry book. He’d taken the class because he expected to go to medical school, and had almost failed, he recalled. It was his second year at Priory; up till then he’d found his classes challenging, but not daunting. His marks weren’t stellar, but good enough. Biology was his best subject; Chemistry nearly killed him. None of his mates were taking the course, so he had to struggle along on his own. Seeing the book gives his stomach a lurch, remembering exam days. He passed, just barely. When he took organic chemistry at uni, he found someone to tutor him.
“No, thank you.” She looked around for a place to sit. Unfortunately, most of the available surfaces were covered with cast-off clothing, scripts, or plates of half-eaten takeaway.
Michael shrugs. His eyes flick over Watson, appreciative. “Not much. It’s nice to see new faces in here.”
When he hears John’s key in the lock, he realises there’s nothing for dinner. He’ll just say he forgot, since he’s not at all hungry. He opens John’s laptop and pretends to be absorbed in something.
A woman with bright blue hair reaches between us, grabs a tub of peach yoghurt, then lingers, considering the mixed berry flavour.
“For Miss What’s-Her-Name-hyphen-Don’t-Give-a-Fuck? Hardly. She was ordinary. You are extraordinary.”
“I have questions.” Honesty might be best, to a point. “I was shocked when it happened, but unable to process it then. Perhaps it’s taken me this long to begin to do that. I was given a script recently that brought it all back to me, and I realised that I need to… process my reaction.”
instead of whatever word they’d agreed was appropriate, but the audience just laughed. It felt good. They were having fun.
Watson sulked, clattered about in the kitchen, cleaning up the remains of my last experiment. Listening to his noisy discontent, I finally could stand it no more. “Come, Watson. Time for a ramble.”
As this thought crosses his mind, he winces. A bit early to be thinking about a second date. He still can’t believe he agreed to the first.
“No need. I’ve taken it from your trust fund. And don’t ask me again for access to that. As I am the only prudent one of us three, I am keeping control of it to provide for your old age, you and your doctor.”
“Something I should have said before. So many times, I wanted to. I kept telling myself that you weren’t like that, that you wouldn’t want me to say those things. And then you were dead.”
“We’ll have him in for a checkup soon,” the doctor is saying. “It can be quite frustrating for the patient’s partner, so do reach out if you’re noticing any behaviours like that.” She smiles sympathetically.
But I am not ashamed of my feelings for you. At first, I might not have called it love, but each year that we knew one another, acting as best friends, I understood more and more that what I felt was not merely friendship. You might think that love is a mystery to me, but its chemistry works on me the same as anyone. And loving you hasn’t destroyed me, as my brother warned. It has made me a better man. I have you to thank for that.
Since he was already feeling maudlin and nostalgic, he might as well pull out the DVD set and watch a few episodes tonight. It would hurt, to see them so young, unprepared for what fame would do to them all, but he would watch— even if it made him sob to see John’s face beaming at him, to hear him say in all innocence,
"Holmes,” he said at last. “Are we really to court these ladies? I confess, I have had some experience with women, but they were not, erm, ladies.”
Having nowhere to go, no one to see, he walks. Ordinarily he doesn’t sleep much, but now he feels exhausted. For the past week he’s been fretting about this thing with John, and stupid sentiment has gotten in the way of doing what he should have done sooner. He feels like an idiot for letting his heart run away with him.
When Victor rejected him, he wasn’t entirely shocked, but he had underestimated how painful it would be. He spent months obsessing over every detail, every conversation, every moment they spent together. That was the disadvantage of having an impeccable memory, he supposed. It took him nearly a year of drugs and failing marks to mostly delete Victor— and even then, he was sometimes surprised when a memory would suddenly surface, taking all the air from his lungs and reminding him what a fool he’d been.
