In the end, Steve spends half the evening writing and deleting messages, because nothing feels quite right. He doesn’t call; he doesn’t know what to say. What is there to say anyway?
Tony doesn’t resist when he’s pulled into another kiss, and he can feel the heat of Steve’s skin and it’s so
Tony nods, relief flooding through him. He is just starting to move back towards the door when Fury’s voice stops him again.
When Tony gets out of the coffee shop, Happy Hogan doesn’t wait for more than a second before he’s holding out his hand for the cappuccino
Steve rolls his eyes, but he’s smiling too as he untangles himself from Tony’s grip and stands, grabbing his jacket off a chair.
When Steve unlocks the door and leads Tony towards his room, he has a moment of doubt. His room is… a mess. The place is a mess, if he’s honest. Clint isn’t the tidiest roommate, and he never makes an effort to clean up properly.
He ignores his father for the remainder of the ride back, and he knows he’ll get hell for it later, but he also knows that by the time they’re all up the next day, Tony will have already left.
Tony leans back against the wall, tugging Steve into place next to him. “I don’t mind. You pick?” He glances at his laptop. “No offence sweetheart, but that computer looks a little dead.”
“Your boy is lying Howard, it’s boring in the office. But he’s learning that there’s more out there than just making shit in a lab.”
“Be careful.” She says, voice low. “I’m not risking a cover just so you can bitch at me. Fury wanted you in, that’s not my decision to make. It had to be realistic and he had to buy it, so stop whining and go.”
Tony rolls his eyes, throwing himself down onto one of the couches. Lunch with Obadiah is always draining, beyond draining, and the meeting with Fury doesn’t start for another twenty minutes. He has time to sleep, or at least try to.
“Three years ago. I went to one of my father’s parties while I was in college. It backfired a little. I drank too much. Ty was there, and he decided to see how far he could go with Howard Stark’s son. By the time my brain kicked in and I realised what was happening, we were in his room, and I couldn’t do anything to stop it.”
He pushes gently, backing Steve up against the counter, and the kiss deepens, Tony’s hands tangling in his hair.
“You can baby, you can. I don’t know what your injuries are, so you’ve got to be conscious when they get here. I love you, so just stay with me, okay?”
“I’m not-“ Steve takes a deep breath, flattening his hands on the counter. “I don’t think you’re a slut.”
They’re away from any crowds here, alone, and they’re so close. He wants to kiss him, because even though he’s scared, he knows that no one with a smile that honest will out him to the tabloids.
Nat shrugs. “He’s allegedly a genius, though I don’t know if that’s just rumours or not. I wouldn’t be surprised if his father had bribed him through college.”
“You look a little pale sweetheart. Seriously. If you’re going to hurl on my suit I’ll be a little pissed off.”
So the lake is where he goes to remember his mother now, and Steve is the only person who’s ever come with him.
He wishes he could have told his mother, wishes she could’ve known more about him, wishes he’d had the courage to tell her the truth about himself.
as the billionaires eyes light with laughter, the bright sound echoing through the kitchen. He loves how Tony laughs, it’s shameless, not dampened by worrying about what anyone might think. There’s no sense of self consciousness, it’s just pure
“You want to keep your boy safe?” Obie says, smiling slowly. It’s not a question, not really. He knows he’s won. “Then go back in there and get rid of Colonel Rhodes. Then do as you’re fucking told, and entertain your guest.”
“Nat,” he says quietly, aware of the fact that Tony is now slipping in and out of consciousness. “Thank you for coming and helping.”
It’s still dark outside, but there’s a shaft of light from a street lamp through the window. Steve looks beautiful like this, all soft edges smoothed by sleep and those goddamn
His head jolts up, forgetting the rule of avoiding Steve’s eyes for more than one reason. They’re so blue. How the hell are they so blue?
Once Clint goes back to his work, he spends five minutes looking at the phone; finger hovering over call button on the number that Tony has given him.
Tony closes his eyes, letting himself relax against Steve. And then two minutes later, he sits up; raising his eyebrows at the noise he had just heard.
Nothing Obie wants to talk to him about can be good, and he’s learned to trust the sinking feeling in his stomach over the years.
Had he? He just remembers his phone vibrating with a text, and then the dread dropping into his stomach
“Hey,” Steve says softly, brushing some hair out of his face. “It’s okay. We’re going to work this out, and I’m here.”
“Good boy,” he says with a smirk, reaching out and straightening Tony’s suit jacket. He flinches back, and Obie laughs a little, giving him a gentle but not gentle push towards the door. “Try not to look so down about it Tony, it’s not the end of the world.”
“It’s okay,” Tony says quickly, and that’s panic he can hear in his voice now. “Doesn’t matter. Can you tell me where you are?”
so fucking much, and yet the grip he has right on it all now is terrifyingly strong. Steve wonders again what the breaking point is, if there is one.
Of course he is, of course he’s trying to catch him out, of course he’s going through Pepper instead of just telling Tony himself.
Steve can see Tony searching her gaze, and then he leans back in his chair, narrowing his eyes, smile fading.
Ty. Who’s Ty? Someone from Tony’s past, evidently. And if Rhodey dislikes him, he’s guessing Tony does too, and there’s a good reason.
And then suddenly, Tony’s so angry he can’t breathe, and his voice is rising again and he wants to break something or throw something and there's just so much of this
“I’m in love with you.” Steve blurts out, cutting off whatever he had been about to say. “I’m in love with you. So if you’re about to apologise for kissing me, please don’t.”
Tony turns to look at him, and there’s so much sadness in Steve's eyes, such an endless, echoing grief. It’s the guilt that takes his breath away. He wonders if it’ll ever leave. Because Tony may have forgiven Steve, forgiven him a long time ago, but he doesn’t know if Steve will ever be able to forgive himself.
When Tony speaks again, his voice is softer, less defensive, and he reaches for Steve’s hand. Steve feels a tiny tremble run through Tony’s fingers as he takes his hand, but it vanishes almost instantly. He’s trying not to push, he is, but it scares him when Tony closes off like this.
“I love you too. So much. I just don’t want you to blame yourself for things that aren’t your fault.”
Purpose, it’s what Tony needs, what he has now. First the crash, then Obie, then the company. The rest will follow. He takes a deep breath.
Something dark flashes in his eyes, a blink and you miss it moment, before the arrogant smile is back.
Tony releases a shaky breath, and there’s not even a point in lying anymore because Ty has told him everything anyway. He keeps his voice flat, emotionless.
“I mean.” he says, trying to save at least some sort of dignity. Tony is so collected, so smooth, so good at everything he does, so perfect when it comes to persuasion, conversation, making Steve fall more in love every time he sees him. “I mean earlier, you said
Tony wonders if Peter is actually smarter than him. Probably. The thought of that makes Tony smile. The kid is a genius, he just doesn’t know it yet.
Gradually, he feels Tony relax against him, all the fight going out of him, until there’s nothing except for a peaceful quiet, and the two of them standing in the empty hallway.
He tries to slow his breathing as he turns around to face the guy behind him. He can only really see half his face, but there’s a smile there.
Eventually, the sun dips behind the water, and it’s only once they’re back in the car that Tony realises he feels lighter.
“I'm not saying anything on record without my lawyers.” Obadiah spits, slamming the folder onto the desk. “You can't officially charge me with anything.”
“I can look into Obadiah, see if there’s anything, and there will be, that he’s been hiding. If it was him, then he would've left a trace.”
Dark curly hair, expensive suit. The boy named Ty from the past- The one against the wall is Tony. He would know him anywhere. Steve’s first instinct is anger. Tony with someone else, clearly drunk-
His parents are dead. They’re dead, they’re not coming back, Stark Industries is his now. He slams a lid down on the storm. Wait. It can wait.
His thoughts are moving too fast, everything is racing. Stark Industries is his now, it’s his to do what he wants with. Obadiah will want the power. He always does. Howard- Howard he can think about later. Relief is the strongest right now. He doesn’t care. But Maria, mom,
It’s too bright, and now Steve has spent enough time around Tony to have a pretty good idea of when he’s bullshitting him. He still can’t tell his smiles apart sometimes, but then again, it’s something he suspects Tony’s been perfecting for half his life.
Tony doesn’t trust Obadiah, not really. his eyes are too cold, too calculating. But the man is also the only person even closely resembling a parental figure in his life now, and it's hard to turn his back on that. Plus, Obie hasn’t done anything wrong that Tony could prove even if he wanted to. It's just… a feeling.
“You're sure?” Fury says, and there’s a glitter of amusement in his eye, like he knows something Tony doesn’t. “Because your brain seems to be a little more complex than
“Can I-” Steve swallows, and Tony tips his head to the side, rearranging his expression into something unreadable. “Can we talk outside?”
“I-” Steve blinks, looking more confused than anything else. “What? Who the hell asks you about any of that shit?”
that way. “But no. They don’t know. No one does, apart from you and Rhodey.” Pepper probably does, she’s too smart not to, and Happy isn’t stupid either.
Tony turns around, and Steve watches a thousand emotions run across his face before he clearly decides to settle on neutral as he picks up the coffee.
“Night Tony,” Steve says, that same soft, sweet smile on his face, and Tony wonders if maybe Steve Rogers is not such a bad thing after all.
“Leave it,” Steve murmurs against his skin, kissing down his neck. Tony’s breath hitches, but he shakes his head, pulling away gently.
“Who did this to you?” Steve says again, meeting Tony’s gaze head on. He sees a thousand emotions go through his eyes in a split second, before they settle back down into something near emotionless.
Peter side eyes him, and Tony can’t work out his expression. “Thanks. So why are you early? And don’t deflect the question.”
He laughs, reaching up to pull Steve back in, kissing him, and then kissing him again. He really could do it forever, Tony thinks, closing his eyes. It’s finally quiet in his head, peaceful,
Tony just shrugs, pulling the police warrant from Rhodey out of his pocket and throwing it onto the desk. Obadiah pales slightly, and Steve bites back a grin, fighting to keep his expression neutral.
His ribs are still aching, and they’re not broken, but they hurt like a bitch, and they're definitely bruised.
His friend looks up from the pile of papers he seems to have merged his soul with. An essay, due in a few days, and there’s so many notes on the table it’s making Steve’s head hurt.
“This isn’t a suicide mission.” Fury says, steepling his fingers. “Here’s what it is. The Captain infiltrates the Hydra organisation base we’ve found. He's the best, the survival rate goes up. You go along as the brains of the mission. We need to be able to decrypt all the intel the Captain collects on the scene, because we need the information to be correct and straight from the source. If we don’t have to transfer it to be decrypted, survival rates go up. Fewer opportunities for someone to betray us. We don’t know what you’re going into, so I need the best we’ve got for this, which unfortunately means you as well Tony.”
His boyfriend’s laugh filters past him, and the smell of coffee follows soon after. That’s his question answered at least.
“Didn’t you say you had something to finish?” Tony’s laughing now, fond exasperation mixing with the exhaustion. “Remind me why I let you be my intern?”
He hasn’t changed a bit. The last time Tony saw him was three years ago, and he had sworn he would never go
Steve slips on his jacket, grabbing shoes. Nat is looking at him with raised eyebrows, mouthing questions that he’s ignoring.
kill my parents.” A beat, and Tony blinks hard, running his free hand through his hair. “He killed my mom Steve.” He says softly, and Steve’s chest aches. “He killed her.”
“When we get in there… it won’t be pretty. I can’t let him see a weakness, can’t give him the chance. If you come in, you might not like what you see.”
“Yeah.” He says quietly, staring out of the window. He doesn’t like the blinds closed anymore, hasn’t for a while. It’s a childish fear, he knows. But he doesn’t care. If she was here, his mother would kiss him on the forehead, would smile that bright smile that always made him happier, would tell him that it’s fine to not like the dark, even at the age of eighteen.
They stay like that for a while, Tony isn’t sure how long, but when he eventually pulls away, his eyes are dry.
It’s a threat, plain and simple, but Tony no longer cares. There is nothing that can make him go and smile at Ty, go and be nice to the boy who had ruined him so completely before he had even graduated.
Steve gives him a hesitant smile, handing him a cup of coffee. It's not rocket science that Tony likes to drink it, but the fact that Steve noticed and bought him some... some of the weight in his chest eases for a second.
Tony shakes his head, shoving his hands into the pockets of his hoodie and sitting down on the edge of Steve’s bed. Clint is out again, and Tony is grateful for the privacy.
Steve drops it, probably because he knows Tony doesn’t want to talk about anything else right now, and instead just holds tight. When he’s sure that he’s not about to break, Tony gently disentangles himself from the hug.
“Technically I’m not. I had to pull a couple of strings with the people in charge, and do a lot of whining to Pepper about how important it is to me that I’m here.”
He doesn’t speak, can't speak right now. He drinks the water slowly, stomach calming down, and tries not to think about the last time he had accepted a drink from someone else.
“Buonanotte mamma.” [4] He says, because he’s not sure what else to say. He just wants to sleep, he wants
Rhodey has gone so very tense, and Tony’s hand closes around his arm, forcing him to stay sitting. He doesn’t need Rhodey fighting his battles, he never has.
“Yeah, you said. But also, it’s not every day that your best friend gets into bed with a billionaire.”
He hangs up, turning back to Steve. “They’ll want a press conference soon. Pepper is on it, but can only hold off for so long. I’ve got to remind the shareholders who exactly is in charge, and that it’s not Obadiah Stane. But that can wait a day.”
“Tony.” Steve says softly, kissing him again. Hearing his name on his lips makes his whole body relax, as if he's been waiting to hear it his whole life. Maybe he has.  “I love you.”
He wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for breath, and barely manages to make it to the bathroom before he’s throwing up everything in his stomach.
He blinks back a sudden sting of tears, because Jesus, he doesn’t need to cry about it, but this song, and the fact that Tony is so close but so far-
“No.” Rhodey says steadily. “You can’t. The only reason you can still use all of your limbs is because we’re in public. Go and find someone else to harass.”
Steve laughs against his lips as they trip, tumbling onto the bed. He can feel Steve’s hands on his skin, and there’s nothing too loud or too quiet in his head.
“It’s okay.” Steve must have said the words five times over, but he doesn’t care. “You’re safe. Just stay awake, okay?”
Steve takes drives them down to the lake again, and it’s become an unspoken thing between them now. The gravestones hurt too much, make him too angry because there’s no peace with Howard there too.
Another smile, and Tony is beginning to wonder if Nick Fury actually has a soul. He’s not a betting man, but he would put money on him being a robot. Or maybe an alien.
“Tony.” Obie chides, and he feels a flash of anger at the mocking tone. He squashes it fast, absolutely refusing to let Obadiah have the satisfaction of seeing it on his face. “You know I can’t tell you any of this.”
Everything is aching with something he can’t identify. He doesn’t think he can move, let alone talk to his friend.
“He told me if I didn’t get Ty and his father to agree to that damn business deal, there would be consequences. I didn’t- I couldn’t let him, and you got hurt.”
But all he says it “Okay,” and then he takes Tony’s hand again, gripping tight as he leads him up to his apartment.
He knows what comes next, especially if Steve has spent more than two minutes on his stupid fucking Wikipedia page.
Their food comes a few minutes later, and he’s honestly never had pasta this good in his life. Ever.
Tony smiles, tracing a finger across Steve’s palm. All his awkwardness seems to have vanished  “You sure you can deal with dating me sweetheart?”
Ty is talking, he’s not sure what’s going on anymore. Everything is loud, blurry, spinning. It’s like he’s drunk too much except he hasn’t. He hasn’t drunk that much, he-
Tony shakes his head, closing his eyes for a split second and not giving him the answer that he already knows. “I-
He shouldn’t have done it, shouldn’t have looked, and now he feels worse because it’s always girls with him, always women.
When Steve’s voice comes back to him, it’s low, and there's an anger in it that he knows isn't directed at him.
“That’s what they said when- That’s what they said.” He starts to turn away, and Steve feels a flash of desperation, a need to make him
Steve has hurt him, he's hurt him so much. But they've hurt each other, and Tony is tired of the anger, the resentment. It's corrosive, but he's done with letting it consume him.
But here they are, and Tony can’t help but think that this is some twisted game that the universe is playing with him. Like
Steve chokes on an incredulous laugh, allowing himself to be pulled out of Tony’s apartment. He’d arrived to pick him up at 11:15 and it's now 11:35.
Steve shakes his head, tipping Tony’s face up to meet his gaze. And what Tony sees in his eyes takes his breath away. “I’ve been in love with you for weeks. Probably a little bit since the first time I saw you.”
Nervous, is the first emotion that comes to mind, and it’s a new one, because he’s usually too drunk to be nervous when it comes to asking people out. Not that he asks them out a lot. Usually, he just skips a few (or five) steps and takes them straight to bed.

Hammer smirks, leaning back on the grass. “Yeah Stark, why don't you go and sit down like the good little
Sometimes when he’s around Steve, he thinks he hears his mother's voice, tinged with sadness, but low and soothing as always.
He can see Nat standing behind him with a shit-eating grin on her face, looking far too awake seeing as he
Tony launches into a coughing fit, and Steve feels a humming sort of delight at the sight of him blushing.
Steve shakes his head, turning to face Sam as the door shuts behind tony. Tony as in Tony Stark, heir to his father's billion-dollar company.
Obadiah leaves, and breathing becomes a little bit easier. He can feel the panic tugging at his chest, and his nails bite into his palms. He can’t break though, not here, not now, because he can see two cameras without even turning around, and Tony knows that seeing him lose it would be like Christmas come early for Obie
There’s a pause. “Did he want something?” Tony asks carefully, trying to keep his tone neutral, standing up with a stretch and wincing as something in his shoulder clicks.
Tony slowly puts down the coffee, staring at the water again and trying to slow down the frantic pace his heart has just set in his chest.
So he doesn’t answer, glancing around the room. Just as he’s about to ask, his mother sweeps into the room and Howard gives her a smile, and all Tony can think is how light he face looks when he smiles, and that he can’t remember the last time his father smiled at him.
“Just to let you know that your parents are on their way to Malibu now, and that you’ll be attending a New Year’s party there in a few weeks time.”
There isn’t a point in lying now, and yet the instinct to hide and lock it all up is still there. Tony shoves it away.
Tony laughs, calling the waitress over to order drinks. It’s not amusing. Frankly, he doesn’t give a
“This is my lunch break.” He says with a frown. “They can’t have burnt down the campus in twenty minutes.”
Two minutes later, Nat slides into the driver's seat. She doesn’t say a word until they’re on the road again, and then she quietly asks for Tony’s address. Steve gives it to her.
He feels restless, and makes his way to the kitchen, taking out a coffee mug with a little more force than necessary.
Nat inclines her head with a grin, and Steve knows it was the right thing to do, bringing Tony here, however much he's getting ganged up against right now.
That's a prickle of shame he can feel. Shame and disgust at himself, because he knows Steve is a better person than he will ever be, and it only makes him want him more.
“Tony.” Steve says, and the anger is gone, evaporated like it was never there, but he can see the intensity in his gaze. He can’t look away. “What the hell is going on?”
“Yeah?” He lifts his head, meeting Tony’s gaze, and he gives Steve a look that is so similar to the one he had given him when they’d kissed. It’s happy, open, and so very honest. A part of him knows that not a lot of people will ever see that expression, so something warm lights in his chest at the sight of it.
Steve Rogers asks him if he wants company, and he looks so sincere that Tony feels his heart break a little more in his chest. Steve is so honest it hurts, and he makes him smile, and he makes him laugh, and he makes him feel
Rhodey arrives a little late, but he’s beyond grateful for his friend, beyond relieved that he’s here. Obadiah shoots him a look that makes his stomach turn as Rhodey shows up, but there’s nothing he can do, or say, in front of all these people. Rhodey ignores the look, gently taking Tony’s arm and guiding him to sit on one of the bar stools, away from everyone.
There’s a fair amount of screaming, mostly done by Justin and his friends, and Tony bites back a laugh as the feeling fades, sitting down again.
Steve gives him an answering smile that is so happy, so full of light, that for a second, Tony feels his heart in his throat.
He thinks back to the conversation. It had been a night like this, only a few weeks after they had met. Tony had drunk a little too much, making him relaxed, flirty, and curious. He’d asked Steve’s favourite music. Steve had said anything by Frank Sinatra, because he didn’t think Tony would be someone to judge music taste. He had been right. The genius had just smiled at him, eyes soft.
“I know,” Tony grins. “This is my ultimate playing card. The pasta here is some of the best in the world apart from in Italy.”
Steve breathes out slowly, closing his eyes for a second. “Okay. Do you… is it okay now? You don’t feel funny?”
Tony offers him a cookie with a grin, and Steve wonders when the billionaire had figured out all of Nat’s food hiding places. He smiles a little at the thought of Tony looking for the cookies, but shakes his head at the offer. Not hungry this early in the morning.
They reach his apartment, and Steve turns, bending slightly to kiss him. The billionaire relaxes into it, smiling against his lips. When Steve pulls away, the words are out of his mouth before he can take them back, and he doesn’t think he wants to anyway.
for the majority of my life.” Tony snaps, some of his steady composure faltering for a second. “And you did nothing.”
“Who the fuck invited you?” Rhodey all but snarls, and Tony is certain that Ty would have a broken nose if he wasn’t holding Rhodey back. Maybe he could let his friend fight that particular one, if they ever get the opportunity.
Interrupting Pepper Potts hasn’t historically been good for his health, but right now he doesn’t care.
“Good.” Tony smiles slightly, setting the coffee mug in his hand down on the table. His face softens into a smile. “Steve-” He realises Tony looks serious, looks nervous, and his heart jumps in his chest for a second. “Listen, this is going to sound… I don’t know. But I was just wondering if maybe you would-”
Tony’s expression doesn’t change in the slightest, his lid on everything so, so tight, and Steve feels a flicker of pride.
Sam raises his eyebrows, waving a couple of other staff members over, and Steve realises that it’s time for his break. He leads the way into the back room, and Nat grabs another glass of water.
Tony swallows, gripping a little tighter to his hand as he pulls away. “I don’t want to-” There’s a beat, and Tony releases a shuddering breath. “Can I-”
He hits call. The phone rings for eternity. When he picks up, Tony is laughing before Steve even hears him start to speak.
He glances at the bartender. He’s talking to someone else. Tony lowers his voice anyway. He’s not quite drunk enough to abandon caution, not tonight, not yet. And trust Steve to bring up the one thing that he really wants to avoid talking about right now.
It takes fifteen minutes for Ty to appear again, which is slower than expected but a lot faster than he would like. He slides into the vacant seat next to him, and he’s just a little too close for comfort.
Tony shrugs, tapping the bar gently, and the bartender refills his drink. He can see Steve watching the amber liquid hit the bottom of the glass, and then looking back to him.
Steve sees his grip tightening on the phone as the conversation continues, and he touches his shoulder gently. He doesn’t miss how Tony flinches slightly, and backs off instantly, giving him space as the conversation continues.
She shakes her head with a sigh, kissing him on the cheek before going to her room. Just before she goes in, she turns back to him, switching to English.
Tony shrugs, grin sharpening. “Like I said. Can’t rush perfection darling. Relax. It’s going to be fine.”
Tony’s eyes are what scare him the most. They’ve emptied out, and he doesn’t know why, he doesn’t know how to
“You came.” Is what reaches his ears a moment later, and Tony sounds like a child. The quiet murmur breaks his heart because of course he fucking came and he sounds so goddamn young right now and all he can think about is the absence of anything in Tony’s eyes when they had first seen him in the hall
Tony puts his feet on the table, boots making a dull thud as they connect. He sees the flash of annoyance in Fury’s eyes, and smiles a little, tight knot of anxiety in his stomach relaxing slightly. Fuck keeping on this guys good side.
urge to cry. He’s a mess, a fucking mess of too many emotions, which just proves the point that he shouldn’t be
Tony grins, shifting so that their eyes meet, and Steve can see something shimmering and dark in his gaze. He hesitates for a second, wavering, because he really
Tony cuts off as half of a sandwich hits Rhodey in the back of his head. They both turn around slowly, and Justin Hammer smiles.
“Fine.” Fury says after the pause, and there’s no warmth in his voice. “You will receive a copy of it later tonight. I’ll brief you both now, the rest of the information you can get from the files.”
It’s dark out, which he suspects is deliberate on Tony’s part. He doesn’t fully understand his worry about being seen together, but the least he can do is respect it for the moment, at least until he knows some more.
“Christ.” Tony groans, glaring at him. “One minute in the big leagues with some secret agents, and your hero worship for me just vanishes.”
There’s silence, and Tony realises he’s drumming out a beat on the tabletop. He stops. Starts again. Forces his hands to still. It’s a nervous habit that he picked up in college, and he still can’t seem to shake it.
Steve, the barista with the very blue eyes, now has the personal number. He’s not sure how he feels about it.
"Io sono mezzo italiano,” Tony glances at Steve, and smiles again. He never wants to stop seeing Tony smile. “But my friend isn’t, so maybe we can stick to English.”
“Sure,” Steve says softly, that smile still on his face, and Tony wants to cry. He needs to explain, needs to get him alone, away from Obie watching, and just explain. He can hear his heart in his ears; it’s beating fast.
Tony has never wanted something this much, ever. Steve’s hands are steady, and his voice is steady, and so soothing, so
“Yeah.” Tony twists his fingers together, expression sobering. “I’m- I won’t be able to make that date we had planned for tonight. My father-” Tony swallows hard,
“Did what you thought was right. I don’t agree with it, and I hate that you have to do it, and you better give me some sort of warning next time, but I don’t hate you. I promise.”
it is, and he listens to her talk at him in Italian for a minute before cutting her off. She’s talking about Christmas, about him coming to Malibu for the week and that is enough to make him swallow down bile.
Tony doesn’t speak, just burying his face against his shoulder and blinking hard. His arm twinges with pain, he ignores it.
“Do you have a name?” Steve’s voice comes out slightly harsher than he intended it to, but in his defence, he is definitely too hung-over to be dealing with someone with a smile this arrogant.
“Thank you.” The Captain says, and his voice has a note of… something in it. Tony hasn’t heard it before, can’t figure out what exactly it is.
Peter huffs, folding his arms and returning his attention to his project. “No. But I heard Fury telling the Captain you were out when he came looking for you.
Also, warnings for past mentions of dubious consent and assault. It's barely there but it's still sort of in it so just be careful xxx
He smiles, a real one, and hugs her as tight as he can, because he has Pepper, and he has Rhodey, and they have donuts and coffee. They’re alive, he's alive.
How he knows, or at least suspects, is beyond Tony. Maybe the bartender, maybe the waitress, maybe someone else.
If that means taking one fucking day off from classes, you’re going to take that day, even if I literally have to tie you to the bed myself.”
Tony is staring at him, and the dim lights of the kitchen are reflecting in his eyes, turning them to molten gold, bringing out the colours that Steve could spend hours looking at, spend hours painting.
Tony just snorts, unwilling to surrender his latte, and tolerating the nickname because Happy is one of the only people he actually likes. Also because he knows that Howard never tells him to stop drinking coffee because
The first hit is in the face. The second knocks the wind out of him. On the third, he hears something crack. By the forth, he stops counting, because the pain makes everything fuzzy, and he can’t think, can’t
His father tells him that, tells him whenever one of his many masks slips slightly. Most people spend their lives trying to see beyond the armour, if they ever realise it’s not the real him. Howard has spent his life making sure no one sees anything other than what he wants them to.
“I love you. I’ve been in love with you for the best part of two years, ever since you told me that you like jazz and smiled at me with those beautiful, beautiful, stupidly irresistibly blue eyes. So don’t insult me by not believing me.”
He should have stopped loving Tony Stark years ago, but it’s too late now. He couldn’t then, he can’t now. He isn’t sure he’ll ever be able to.
the amusement radiating off Rhodey. They’re next to the fountain now, and there’s something about the rushing sound of water that is oddly soothing. “You’re being annoying.”
He releases a breath, closing his eyes for a second. “I’m worried about Obie, about my father. They like to hit back when they’re threatened and-”
Steve blinks at him, the haze of sleep finally clearing all the way as he stands up, shrugging the sheets off him.
Tony smiles a little, and it’s more relaxed now as he feels some of the tension in his chest easing.
He watches as Tony takes the USB without another word, plugging it into his computer. The tiny blue light blinks on, and Steve leans over his shoulder, watching the screen. The first thing up are what looks like missile plans, scrolling across the computer screen almost too fast to see. He hears Tony inhale sharply next to him, and seconds later, realises why. Photos. Photos of these missiles with groups of men that Steve has only seen on the news as America’s most wanted.
So he turns up to all of the lunches, he smiles every time, talks about his teaching job at MIT. He definitely
As he speaks, there’s a knock on the door and Tony gets up to open it, phone in hand. Steve follows a couple of steps behind, listening to the conversation that is still going on.
He shifts slightly, blinking, and reaches up, touching his cheek. His fingers come away wet with tears, like he’d been crying in his sleep. But why-
His heartbeat isn’t too fast anymore, it’s steady. He pulls gently against Steve’s grip, and he lets him go, shifting backwards slightly.
His eyes open, and when Tony turns towards him, Steve sees a second of something terrified in his eyes before it vanishes. In the dim lighting of the room, Tony reminds him of some sort of fallen prince, messy curls, unreadable eyes and a shadow that seems to have etched itself into every pane of his face. For the first time in a while, he gets the urge to freeze time just so he can draw the scene before him.
“I don’t need you to do that.” Steve says quietly, anger deflating. “You know I don’t want you to do that.”
There’s something in Obadiah's voice that makes Steve go still. Tony’s sentence trails away, and Steve shifts closer to him, heart pounding.
Tony’s voice has shifted into something silky smooth, and Steve clears his throat, suddenly feeling hot all over.
“I’m sorry for hurting you.” He says quietly, because that’s the only thing he is sorry for, and right now, it feels like the only thing that really matters.
Steve feels his breath hitch, and tries to ignore the fact that Tony is holding his hand. Tony, who he’s been achingly, desperately in love with for the best part of two years. Tony, who’s only ever taken women to bed, who he doesn’t think has ever been interested in men. Tony, who’s his friend and nothing more. Tony, who has no clue how Steve feels about him.
He came in here because after the day, after the call, all he wanted to do was drink until he couldn’t remember what Obadiah’s shark smile looked like. They serve him in here; they always do, even when he doesn’t have his unconvincing fake ID with him. The lighting is dim, so he doesn’t expect to be recognised. He’s pulled it together since the call with Rhodey, but he feels almost vulnerable at the moment, even if he doesn’t look it.
to me about this shit, all of it, and be careful, and don’t put yourself into situations where you’re vulnerable like that!”
He feels the moment it clicks in Steve’s head, sees the emotions cross his face at the speed of light. Annoyance, confusion, shock, and a tiny bit of fear. Steve’s grip tightens, just a little.
In the end, Tony isn’t surprised that Rhodey ends up punching Steve in the face, but when it happens he grabs his friend’s arm, dragging him out of the room.
It’s Steve’s turn to blush now, and Tony feels a twinge of satisfaction as the Captain looks away. When he turns his attention back to Fury, the director is watching them with raised eyebrows, a humourless smile on his face.
He breathes out, slipping shaking hands into his pockets, locking the memories up again. Then Obadiah speaks again.
Tony’s eyes flicker open, and Steve swears he feels his heart stop. His eyes are glazed, unfocused, and as Ty shifts slightly, he can see the hands gripping Tony’s waist hard enough to bruise, the untucked shirt.
He nods, swallowing hard, and tries to relax, letting himself fall into the simple stepping rhythm as Tony leads him across the smooth tiles of the kitchen. He ignores how the way Tony had said
In the week that had followed the death of his parents, Tony had been next to a stranger, pulling away from everyone a little bit, even Steve.
He drags himself out of the spiral, slamming down a lid on the things that he aches to say, the things that he only ever tells Rhodey.
His friend sighs heavily, tapping the bar, and the bartender refills both of their drinks. Just as Tony is about to take a sip, a new voice sounds behind them.
Fury opens his mouth again, and then Natasha shoves opens the door, face set in stone. It brightens as soon as she sees Tony.
As he looks at her again, he takes in the details. She’s dressed in a tailored suit, coat over one arm and hair windswept. It’s so at odds with the leather jackets and combat boots Tony is used to that he has to take a second. He sees the flash of annoyance in her eyes as he hesitates and decides to start talking.
Steve kisses him, which has always proven effective. This time is no different. When he pulls away, it’s Tony’s eyes that are wide.
A second later he’s gone, and when Steve turns around, Nat is behind him, staring at him with an open mouth.
His mother had wanted him to come, and he had agreed because it was his mother, and Rhodey’s had just been diagnosed with stage three breast cancer (which she has now survived) and it was his
The drive to the cafe is made in silence, and Tony forces his hands to remain still, not looking at Obie. Every turn of the car makes his stomach lurch, and he closes his eyes. There’s something that he can only describe as white noise in his head, and he hates it.
A minute later their drinks arrive, and Obadiah clinks the glasses together. Tony takes a drink, and it burns a little.
by Frank Sinatra. He wonders if it’s a mistake that Tony is playing his favourite song. Probably. Maybe it’s nothing.
The robot beeps at him again, sounding almost concerned, and he blinks hard, dragging a hand across his eyes. He won’t cry, he
His voice is low, still husky with sleep, and Tony turns around to smile, reaching up to press a kiss to his lips.
It makes Tony feel small as he stands, wrapped in Steve’s arms. For the first time, nothing else matters except for this. Steve is warm, the rain is cold.
would be more accurate. He has less than two seconds to rearrange his entire face into the right amount of recognition before she's next to them.
“No.” Steve says softly, hugging him tighter. “Tony you don’t. I’m glad I'm here, I’m glad I’m allowed to love you and be a part of your life. I wouldn't change that for the world, Okay?”
quick note: the italics that are ALSO bracketed are quotes/lyrics/lines of poetry/things that i wrote. they're not thoughts, and are more like a commentary on the scene/whats going on. Think of it as a sort of anonymous narration if that makes sense lmao. Normal bracketed things are just the character's thoughts! Hope you enjoy xx
wants to murder Tiberius Stone. He reaches out, lacing their fingers together, and Tony shoots him a look that is a mix of thanks and relief. “Ty is powerful. So he might not want to let that go. Same with Obadiah.”
Tony rolls his eyes, resisting the urge to laugh. How the mighty have fallen. There are moments when he regrets being anonymous when it came to creating Stark Industries, but then he remembers all the reasons behind the decision.
So for this chapter I did quite a lot of research into some very scary drugs. The one that Ty gives Tony is called GHB, and most of the effects shown here are quite accurate but I’ve obviously tweaked it a bit to fit with the content I wanted etc. I’m not rEally sure why I’m sharing this but idk if there are any medical experts reading pls don’t come for me for 😂😂 aNyway, stay safe guys, and don’t go to parties without someone you trust
Tony’s smile turns catlike, and there’s something in his eyes that is a whole other type of darkness. Steve isn’t sure he’s breathing as the billionaire reaches out, trailing his fingers over his arm.
he’s going to go insane. The memories of the endlessness of space coupled with the memories of his mother’s eyes makes him want to break things. Or have a drink. Or do something reckless and stupid like call Ty Stone.
He’s in his room in his apartment and he has no idea how he got there and no idea what happened but he knows that Ty was there-
The last time he had woken up like this, Tony had slipped out of bed and tried to sneak out, tried everything he could to hide from the feelings he knew were building inside of him. This time…
He’s not making sense, he’s not even sure his thoughts are making sense anymore, because nothing makes sense and he’s so fucking
“Captain Rogers is the leading agent on this mission. We’re dealing with international terrorists. We know they’re dangerous. The less you know the better.”
“You’re late.” Snaps Nick Fury, and Tony feels a flicker of annoyance before he shoves it away, pulling out a chair.
His thoughts drift back to Steve, predictably. Tony usually makes a point of never going to the same coffee shop twice, because god knows New York has enough of them for a lifetime. It also decreases the chances of him being recognised, because dealing with the vultures that write for the tabloids isn’t his preferred way of spending his morning. Happy agrees, which is why the rule works. He’s been here for a month, and that’s the only time he’s gone somewhere twice.
The Captain’s palm comes down, slamming into the table in front of them. Tony jumps a little, Natasha doesn’t flinch.
“For sure. Leave them here, Peter can start on them while I’m at a briefing. Don’t worry, he’s good at what he does. I’ll have it done for tonight.”
A twitch of a smile, but it’s the first Steve has seen of one since Obadiah left, so it’s better than nothing.
“I invited him,” Tony says through gritted teeth, and out of the corner of his eye, he sees Rhodey’s hand tighten around the glass.
“I went to a board meeting in jeans and a sweatshirt, because I had one of the worst hangovers of my life.”
He makes a noise that just about passes for an answer, taking a drink of coffee and feeling the pounding in his head ease significantly.
Tony is just about managing to keep up, so he’s not surprised when his mind starts to drift a little. Five years ago seems like forever, and yet nothing at all.
The guy looks at him, dark eyes unfaltering. He smiles, and it's a practiced thing, all sharp edges and bedroom softness.
If he tells Fury it’s because he had a weird feeling that he could read the markings, he’ll probably get sent to the school counsellor.
And there’s nothing more to be said, but the silence is soothing. He feels himself relax, watching the sun make patterns of light across the lake.
He touches Steve on the arm, and his skin is warm, it’s so warm, and Tony wants to kiss him again more than he wants to do anything else.
He’s one minute late, but he’s not going to start something now, not while Howard is just looking for things to make a point out of.
He forces his eyes back to Steve’s face, and it looks like his brain is struggling to catch up with what Tony is saying, body still half asleep.
He clears his throat, trying for a smile. “Yeah. Sorry. Um, that would be amazing, but don’t you have things to-”
An hour later, there’s another goddamn knock at the door, and Steve doesn’t even let Tony move before he’s lunging out of his seat to open it.
“M’sorry,” Tony murmurs into his shirt as he pulls him upright, supporting him with both hands. It’s the first fucking time Tony has ever apologised to him, and it’s for something that is the furthest from his fault as anything can be
He sees so much in Steve’s eyes. Sadness, worry, fear, exhaustion, a tiny flash of savage pleasure at the idea. But then it fades, and it’s only Steve left. Honest, beautiful,
He shoves his hands into his pockets, following Obadiah out of the lobby door. They’ve booked a car and Tony gets in first, pushing until he’s right up against the window. The glass is cold, soothing.
Judgement is something he can deal with, he’s grown up knowing how to deal with it. Steve… Steve is something he isn’t sure about, and it’s making him nervous.
“I’ll sort the car.” Pepper says, already tapping away at her phone. “Give me twenty minutes. Your security detail will have to go up for a while.”
not to spend twenty minutes getting ready!” Steve says, exasperation warring with fondness. “I literally remember the conversation. So can we hurry. Up. Please
“You’re overthinking, and worrying. I’m not breaking up with you, I’m not angry with you.” Steve’s voice is soft, and his hands are soft, and Tony is so fucking
If Steve is surprised by the information, it doesn’t show on his face, and Tony wonders if he’s judging and hiding it well, or if it just doesn’t matter to him.
“I-” Steve swallows, and he sees the bob of his throat in his peripheral. “I hurt you. I betrayed you in the worst way.”
“It’s not often I get to meet anyone Tony works with.” Obadiah says with a laugh. “So it’s my pleasure.”
Tony laughs, having another drink of his coffee, and Steve tries to wipe the stupidly happy smile off his face. He rolls his eyes in defeat instead, shooting Nat a mock glare.
The person speaking is someone he knows. He definitely knows him, would know him anywhere. But his tone... it’s barely recognisable. It’s cold, hard. He’s only heard it one other time. Memories of a café flicker into his minds eye, an older man with a shark smile, and any lingering joy on the boy’s face vanishing.
Obadiah gives him another one of those smiles, and it’s a reminder that Tony is surrounded by sharks every day.
Steve closes his eyes, sliding the laptop off his lap, and bringing his hands up to run them through Tony’s mess of curls as he tugs him closer.
“I think,” He says quietly, and Steve is immediately looking at him, searching his eyes. “I think it… an accident. I don’t think it was an accident.”
His mother wants to stay in the hotel for dinner, but Howard, as always, gets the last say. A fancy restaurant in town. Someone comes to his room and tells him that they’re leaving in an hour, and that he’s expected downstairs in fifty minutes.
But what happens when the worst parts of the world come with dating Howard Stark’s son? Can he still be selfish?
Tony laughs, but there’s no humour in it. The teen is incredibly intelligent, he’s not surprised he’s managed to figure Tony out, despite only knowing him properly for a couple of weeks.
Neither of them have their shirts on, but it hadn’t gone any further than that. He’s not sure if he’s relieved or not.
“Pep. Book the hotel, okay? Send me the details later.” He hangs up, and thinks about when Pepper’s icy exterior had melted with him. They had met when he had first ended up in college three years ago, and he had employed her as soon as he had graduated. The ice hadn’t lasted long, and she quickly became one of the most important people in his life next to Rhodey.
The only people who have a key to his apartment other than him are Rhodey, because he trusts him, and Obie, because Howard had said so, and it hadn’t been a tone that promoted a lot of argument.
This one is... a lot for my heart. I basically spent half an hour going over it again and again because I can't decide if i hate it or love it ANYWAy I hope you guys like it :)
“Sure.” He says, pushing open the door. Staying with Rhodey is fine. Frankly, he’d rather be with Rhodey than anyone else. “Not an issue.”
They look at such a huge range of work, and Tony, someone who prides himself on not being easily surprised, is ridiculously impressed by the amount of talent.
It’s a test, it has to be. If Tony walks in there and knows Steve, acts like he likes him, any lingering doubt Obadiah has will be wiped away.
Steve raises his eyebrows, letting him go and grabbing two mugs, making some coffee. They have ten minutes until it opens.
Steve manages to get Tony into the apartment and then into his room. By this point, he’s barely conscious, eyes too dark, too unfocused. Steve is terrified, more scared than he’s been in a while because he’s heard too many horror stories of things like this and
you’re bullshitting me about the dating thing. If he’s not looking for anything serious, which I really doubt, from what I’ve heard, you get dinner with a billionaire and never see him again. Not a biggie.”
It’s Steve’s turn to laugh, but once the words sink in, the humour fades quickly. Fifteen, and board meetings and hangovers had already been a part of his life.
Tony couldn’t see how Stephanie’s brows climbed up her forehead until they were nearly obscured behind her fringe, but he sure heard the lingering silence that grew between them.
“Who do you think you are?” Tony snarled, bundling himself up in the bedsheets. “Do you know who my father is? He makes bombs for a living, and I’m his only son. You better take me back to my dorm, or he’ll make you regret you were ever born.”
Steve paused in the middle of stuffing his gloves into his coat pocket and turned to face his partner. Bucky stared at him, unblinking and unimpressed.
“How come I never knew,” Tony wondered out loud, then pressed more firmly against Steve’s chest to push him down onto his back. “Lie back, let me look at you.”
all day. We can do something other than the movie, if that’s what you want, but, I, I want to spend today with you.”
“I’ll throw Buck at her,” Sam promised, since Bucky’s attempts to flirt back with 004 always ate up time. “You think you can handle outfitting her solo?”
“Tony Stark trusted me to support you in his stead,” she told him, as if there was nothing unusual about standing sentry at his side in a barbershop.
“Alright, honeybear, easy does it,” Tony soothed with slow, gentle words, reaching for Rhodey’s mostly-empty glass. “How about we try some water, hm?”
Steve made it to court in time to get a seat in the front directly behind Bucky and Tony. Not that there was much competition for seats on their side. Hansen’s side of the courtroom, however, was teaming with family members and friends, people who’d come to support her and make the appropriate noises of support as needed.
“I’ve only ever eaten eggs twice in my life,” Tony whispered, sitting down with care so that he wouldn’t drop his plate or his eggs. “This—Stephanie, this is… thank you.”
Until they weren’t enough, of course. Once their ability to maintain the positive attention among his peers waned, his sugar babies became the scapegoats for his restored insecurities.
Then, it was over almost as quickly as it had started. Tony started to pull off, releasing Steve’s fingers through his teeth, one at a time, just as Steve felt the first, sweet tension of his orgasm mounting.
All the way out of his dorm Steve got looks, sarcastic whistles, and one adventurous spirit even shouted ‘call me!’ in his wake, but the minute he got out into the sunshine Steve could feel his whole day turning around. The birds were chirping, all around him students were busy getting wherever they needed to be, just like Steve. His first class with Stromwell didn’t start for fifteen more minutes, which meant Steve would be able to get to his lecture hall early and get a seat in the front row. From there, he would be able to turn around and see the whole first-year cohort’s faces and finally -
“No,” Steve mumbled, blindly reaching back where he could feel Tony kneeling behind him. “No, pl’s.”
“Wait, no—let’s not jump to conclusions!” Tony decided quickly before Steve finished his offer to play the failed boyfriend. He pulled out what had been Jane’s chair recently, indicating for Steve to get comfortable. “Please. Order anything you like, it’s on me. And hi, my name is Tony Stark.”
“Calm yourself, Captain Steven G. Rogers,” Tony said in a firmer tone of voice. “There is a villainous maniac on the loose, and whatever else this pacifist, meatloaf fearing society has done to offend you, we live, we love, and we try just as much as people in your time. So may we table the collapse of your psychoemotional disposition until the threat of this heinous criminal is neutralized?”
The touch of his skin was the first physical contact Tony had experienced since his parents had passed away. It was nauseating, revolting, and Tony squeezed his eyes shut to steady himself, to silence any cry and restrain himself from jerking his hand away in disgust.
Ever since their wedding, the day before the summer solstice had become one of the most difficult days to work. Focusing on anything approaching productivity was nearly impossible, mostly because all Tony was good for was counting down the minutes until the transformation of his fully grown, brave war veteran of a husband into a playful, competitive force of nature.
As a gold class officer, Bruce outranked Tony. There was no reason for him to follow through with Tony’s request or to do as Tony said. But they both knew that the treasure of having a family with a woman he cared deeply for was greater than any duty, and the fear of losing it all too much to bear. So Bruce nodded, and he promised to do as Tony asked.
Tony’s life flashed before his eyes - his childhood rolling colorful fruit chewies in sodium alginate with his mother, who taught him chemistry was for more than medicine, or his teenage years hiding books on combustion engines or Bruce Lee laser discs from his father, who couldn’t understand why his son was so determined to scare all chances of mentorship away. He lived and died in that sole heartbeat. Like the celestial refuse that occasionally streaked across the sky, the obscene mass of Captain Steve Rogers was hurtling down the ladder at an alarming speed.
Tony was mulling over the depressing paradox of how a relationship could feel so stable and yet so fleeting when Steve spoke.
Steve followed Tony’s lead on autopilot until the hallway opened into a tidy, but cramped bedroom. A four-poster bed was pushed up against the far wall almost as an afterthought, while the rest of the space was devoted to a deep workshop bench and its miscellaneous cabinets and shelving. Something Steve could barely identify as a saddle was the only project currently out, along with a handful of tools that were strewn around it on the bench, as if Tony had only gotten up from his work a few minutes ago.
“Not every country has ravioli, my love,” Tony playfully soothed, if only because the familiar argument between them always left Steve smiling again. “Wakanda has many wonderful and diverse cuisines from all over  Africa, I think we can forgive them this one disappointment.”
The bubbly, cheerful woman with her mop of white and grey curls studied the men for a brief time before smiling at Rob Brydon.
Thor downed the last of his stout and turned to order another. In the time it took to catch the bartender’s attention, he spotted a small group of young women at the other side of the bar.
They pulled into traffic smoothly, gliding between cars as easy as breathing. Even when Tony eventually leaned into Steve’s broad back, he refrained from any full-body clinging to Steve’s body.
“You’ve read passionate haikus about my testicles, detective. Call me Tony,” Tony observed with a wry grin. He shuffled a few of his piles - most letters were harmless, a few qualified as
“I have to think about my future, Steve. I care about you, and believe me, I never expected to be doing this. But one day you’ll look back on this and agree that breaking up was the right thing to do for both of us.”
“So good for me,” Steve praised him in a whisper, easing the fully loaded canister out of Tony and letting it fall to the mattress. He braced Tony’s legs with care, gently lying them out on his bed and rubbing his sore thighs out, even slipping two lubed fingers around and into his hole to be sure there was no bleeding or tearing to worry about.
Steve didn’t take his eyes off their surroundings, but he still huffed a nervous laugh at Tony’s words. “Never thought I’d hear you say those words.”
With a big yawn and barely aware of what he was saying, Tony stumbled to his feet and blindly made his way to his closet. The routine was old and familiar, and half asleep, Tony pulled on his sweats and shuffled to the door without tripping or staggering into furniture.
Steve didn’t give two shits about what the computer was doing. He lunged for Tony who only managed to turn off the monitor before Steve dragged him behind the relative cover of a bas relief on a large granite stand. Why weren’t they hiding in the stairwell? There was no way security guards would run ten floors just to secure the office, he and Steve could have gotten away then come back for the drive.
Their return to the car was more of a march than a stroll, and Tony gave Steve a few minutes of silence to recover before offering his hand to him across the console. It took Steve a moment to notice his hand, but when he did, he smiled, and he took Tony’s hand in his own and brought it to his lips. He pressed a soft, lingering kiss to the back of Tony’s hand. He didn’t seem ready to speak yet, but Tony felt the tension fading rapidly around them. In the end, that was all that mattered. They sat in companionable silence for the forty minutes it took to get back to Steve’s place.
“Bucky’s been scary-good at the sugar baby talk, you’d be proud,” she said after a pull from her drink. “I never thanked you for taking time off to help us.”
A direct call came in for Tony from Q, but when Tony connected the call, it was Bond on the other line.
“Tony. Tony Stark,” Tony told him, even though he knew he’d never hear the end of it from Bond now. Being requested by 007 was the last thing he needed, but it wasn’t like he could refuse. This was his job.
Tony crouched down beside the little girl with tears gathering in her eyes, and while any mere mortal might have laughed at just how seriously she took talks about genitalia and reproduction, Tony just reached out to rub her shoulder gently. “I’ll tell you all about it during lunch, okay?” he promised. “You’ll have lots to teach your mom today, I promise.”
Steve watched them both with a smile for a beat, relieved to see the tension ease in Tony’s posture, and his friend taken down a peg when he needed it most. He didn’t comment on the present, but he reached for Tony’s hip on the impulse of wanting to be closer to Tony in that moment.
. Six years, do you understand? Six years I’ve been dating, and nothing. No-one stood out. But two fake dates with you? The first time I
It took a moment for Tony to catch his breath and clear his head. Bond knew what he was doing, Tony could practically feel the cocky smirk in Bond’s voice. That smug bastard.
Having said what he needed to say, Steve gave Sharon a look; she hurried to open the door for him and followed him out at once.
Tony’s face broke into a wide grin, and he glanced Steve’s way with a warm affection. “Someday, yeah,” he admitted, still smiling. “Goats optional.”
Steve watched Tony turn to leave. He wasn’t entirely sure he heard right, or even understood why a white lie upset Tony the way it did, but he shook it from his thoughts and jogged after him.
“You say that like you didn’t just create a whole new world last week,” Steve teased even as he tried to take stock of what happened while Tony made his way back to the couch. “You’ve done all this work on the case
“I’m his mother,” she said matter of factly. “My first son’s getting married? He’s not doing that in some dirty old city like New York: he’s doing it here, with family. His friends are here; if he wants to ride Dummy down the aisle he can.”
If he hadn’t expected Steve’s confidence when he first asked to fuck him, Tony certainly hadn’t expected Steve’s eager playfulness now. He leisurely indulged in licking and sucking his way up and down the length of Tony’s cock until Tony nearly wept from it. When Tony’s fingers curled ever tighter in Steve’s hair, Steve finally wetted his lips properly and took him into his mouth. He swirled his tongue around the head as he softly sucked on it while stroking the base of Tony’s cock in a tight fist, until Tony’s groans turned to breathless, broken pleas of Steve’s name and his thighs squeezed around Steve’s head, quivering with need.
Steve groaned quietly, and on a childish impulse, kicked at the floor. “I know, and he’s worth the compromises, it’s just… I want to ask him to move in with me, mom,” he whispered, swallowing back the nerves and anxiety and
“Look, I don’t know you that well. I’m just… what you said, it sounded a little familiar, that's all. Nobody can tell you what to do, that’s your business. I get that. But my brother cares about you, Steve. He’s not the type to give up. He deserves someone who’s willing to help himself, too.”
“Depends on what’s more important to you: staying clean, or stopping Rumlow from roaming the city freely?”
“Tony, you can’t think that way,” Steve tried to remind him, but Tony wouldn’t have it. The blood had drained from his face, and he only seemed compelled to stand by the power of his surging guilt.
It was too much. It felt like being dumped all over again, only with more indignant anger and more frustrations. He wanted to scream at Tony; he wanted to cut his losses and walk away.
Steve’s smile faded then, and he ducked his head briefly as if to think it over. Except, he had already spent hours worrying over the same question.
“I’m so sorry, I was working and lost track of time,” Tony said with big, sad eyes, batting his eyelashes in a way that somehow made Steve even angrier. “Please, forgive me, Sparky?”
The hut with gluhwein had been their first stop, though Tony was the only one who went with wine - Steve immediately changed his mind to rum and hot chocolate, and both Bucky and Natasha chose something non-alcoholic while on duty. They made a point of visiting every artist hut and buying something small from each of them. Tony picked up a snow globe for Lila and a ceramic mug Natasha was eyeing. Steve, who had been curious but uncommitted to most of the trinkets sold at the huts, was the first to notice a shimmering ceramic Christmas tree ornament of them riding a toboggan. Their little cartoon-like selves looked so happy on this imaginary toboggan adventure that Steve picked it up and turned to show Tony immediately. They barely noticed Bucky paying the artist while they laughed over the adorable ornament. The artist bashfully told them that this was one of the few ornaments of the monarchs he had left - everything was selling like hotcakes, particularly an ornament depicting their wedding earlier that year.
“Mama always said it’s empowering that relationships can be based on love for us. You’re not stuck with someone because you’re dependent on your partner for money. She always said to love the person who loves you best, and who brings out the best in you,” Jenna said, mostly directing her words at Sarah. Or so Steve thought. He had just dared to breathe a sigh of relief when Jenna turned to him and said, “but she also says, it’s a hell of a lot easier to love people with money.”
Despite his attempt to keep his composure, Tony’s lips thinned in a sudden flash of anger. “For six months,
That was when Steve stood up. With his hands on his hips, he rose to his full height, flexing his arms and back in his leather jacket in a way that made him look even bigger than he was. At some solid inches over six feet and 250 pounds, intimidation often got him farther than he cared to admit.
Laura hushed them, but a small smile plastered itself on her face. “Who’s Nick Furry,” Wanda questioned picking up Nathaniel and Peter nodded his agreement to the question.
And then the girl was gone and the manager was bringing another tray out. She cleaned the mess up. “This could have been a lot worse, with the media” Rhodey noted shoving the pretzels towards Wanda.
Do you remember the day I jumped out of a plane without a parachute? Yeah I know I’ve done that a lot. You know how you all like to lecture me about it how dangerous it was. I’ve never cared about myself though. I use to be ninety pounds soaking wet and sick more often than I was healthy. It always felt like the universe was trying to kill me off and the people around me seemed to agree. I always thought my life was short and I didn’t mind risking that for anyone else. Then I got big and I still didn’t mind. It just seemed like I would be harder to kill. Then Bucky died and I wanted more than anything to go with him. I left Peggy for him. She’s dead now. You should have been at her funeral too. Don’t think she didn’t tell me stories about you. But anyway me jumping without a shoot that was me resting fate, testing this body that still feels too large for me. I still wanted to follow Bucky.
Steve abounded his seat on the couch and walked over to Sam. They hugged. Steve was a freakishly tackle person and Sam didn’t mind. “Good to see you” Steve answered a large smile blooming across his face.
Thor stood. “Thank you, my friend, I can not repay you for your generosity, and thank you, brother, for sharing with me today. I will depart until you ask for me,” Thor stated.
She reached forward and kissed his cheek. “Call soon hmm? And I want you to transfer your videos and pictures of Peter into the community folder.
She laughed again. “I know,” she agreed softly, “we’ve worked out a different system. Peter is going to start interning for Stark Industries officially.”
Sam chuckled. “Such is things. I’m going to go to my room to shower and get dressed. Do you need anything?”
He was almost at the bouncer when the drunks caught up to him and started to pull at his arm. “Uh no Captain,” Scott exclaimed and then hiccuped, “You don’t want to go in there.”
Loki shook his head no and Sam walked out. Loki sat in the middle of his bed for another couple of minutes. Then he got up and showered as well before he headed to the kitchen. Natasha was sitting over a pot of coffee. “Why do you not take care of that pretty hair of yours,” she demanded not looking up from the book sitting in front of her, “I can feel those knots from here. Go sit on the stool.”
Pepper laughed. The walked past a tv and Sokovia was burning. Not Literally just a building but Wanda looked horrified. So many things flashed through Tony’s mind at that second. “It looks like you have to go to work,” Pepper told him.
Loki reappeared, nodded at Gideon, kissed Sam’s Mom’s cheek, and slipped off with Steve. “Come in,” Sam invited, “do you want anything to eat?”
Pepper came over to discuss rap music, and groan whenever someone suggested she actually liked classical music outside of opera events.
She left after dinner. “I have a wine date with Pepper,” she announced, “I’ll see you boys in the morning.”
“Loki. I can feel no shame in you,” she argued, “I am honored to be the wife of someone as noble as you are.”
Pepper shrugged, “he’s spending the night, but he has school the next day. It depends when you get in.”
Sam was in the lounge the next morning listening to Clint and Tony talk about disturbing Tweets, going so far as to read them out loud. “Can we just hang the people who won’t stand for the flag?” Tony read, “that one is really bad.”
Three days later Loki sat in his garden alive now despite the winter. Now that his magic was released he used it to put himself at ease. In this case that meant making his garden grow in the winter much to Bucky’s frustration, because Magic was cheating. Thor joined him looking at what his brother had created. Natasha watched from a polite distance.
Loki felt his body file from the couch and against the wall. He landed on the ground and rolled to his feet. “Sorcerer,” he answered peeling back his lips in a snarl.
This Bucky was soft. Bucky before Hydra had not been. That Bucky had been rough, suave, angry, and a compleat gentleman, but not soft. This Bucky was and Steve found himself loving that.
He shrugged. “Got home yesterday morning and by five Laura was helping me pack when we saw the news.”
Sam laughed. “Rylie had my heart in his hands the moment he saw me and he knew it,” Sam told her and he talked until his voice was hoarse.
Scott had both an alarmed, confused, and amused look on his face as Tony dashed from the room. He returned with a teddy bear. He handed it over, “its soft and smells like lavender and if she is near it’ll keep track of her heart rate and breathing pattern, you could get your boss to wire the information to your suit or phone so you have the information.”
The boy flinched and looked down at his feet before tilting his head back proudly. “My name is Loki Odinson of Asgard and I am burdened with glorious purpose!”
“If Steve wanted a millionaire genius he would have dated Howard,” Bucky laughed, “and Howard did try his damnedest. Nah Steve must like you for your wit and big heart. Though I haven’t seen any wit yet.”
He slumped down next to Loki without any grace. Loki finds it both disgusting and endearing and that’s troubling. “Peter, ask him how he I settling in, but not in that way,” Wanda demanded.
Sam did not roll his eyes even though he wanted to. Not in front of his Mom. Sam saw a flash of green run past his door out of the corner of the screen. “What was that,” his mother demanded.
“Yeah,” Sam answered, “Loki’s not going to hurt him, and I think I’m going to move Loki into my place.”
He caught her even though she barreled into him full force. “I don’t like to be touched” he complained holding onto her tighter.
And then Natasha was sitting outside waited for the car when they arrived. Which was scary, but not to bad. Not really. Peter had a game plan now. Well not really a game plan. He was really just going to babble like he usually did. That had worked with everyone else, right? And she had volunteered. So yeah that was the plan. Peter and Ned had spent the last three days gathering as much information about the Black Widow as they could and it was scarily impressive.
Ah. Peter Parker. That was what Steve needed. A name and address was what he needed to give to Tony so he could do more research.
Wanda’s smile flattered for a second. “I believe the wording did not translate,” Vision pointed out.
Steve hadn’t told anyone that. Not the word. He told Tony he had been in love with Bucky and Peggy so he supposed that was as good as coming out, but no one else knew. Not even Sam or Natasha. He had found the word because Steve had found tumbler by accident. Not really an accident. Tony made a joke about it once and then Steve had googled and signed up because that was social media right?
Wanda looked down at the pamphlets she was given her eyes scanning it and she feels Tony shift and the air in the room turns stale and as she looks up Tony is already on his feet a fist in his hand. Tony looked up at the guy unimpressed his other hand held out in front of Wanda who the punch was aimed for.
Bucky stuck his tongue out. The interviewer chuckled. “The bar you opened is said to be very successful. Many people are surprised when they realize that Vengers is a gay bar. How did you make that decision?”
Tony stomped his foot. “Jesus! You’re like some traumatized baby kitten begging to get out of the rain. How am I supposed to try and hate you when you’re adorable?”
“You’ll know as soon as you see him,” Steve answered staring up at the roof, “and if it helps it’s not you he’s scared of. He’s scared of failure and of losing you, and the rest of us again. He wants us to succeed as much as we do.”
That’s how the Accords fiasco started and Tony remembered why he didn’t always get along with Steve. He was such a stubborn ass, but he wouldn’t let their son into get into a fight right? He just needed a few minutes to talk and make the Captain see reason.
Loki felt bitterness because even with Asgard’s distrust in magic they still respected and feared it enough to go through the proper training. “I know you have a sorcerer here no matter how unpleasant. He should have taken responsibility and trained any magic child on Midgard.”
“I think you should talk to them,” Peter stated, “and why are they all consider about me and know my secret identity and know that you’re my dad before it even happened.”
Tony glared. “I said my labs for a reason. Rhodey is a genius, but not that kind. If you can convince him to take you into his labs that’s fine.”
Wanda looked over at her. Right. They were supposed to go clothes shopping. “We’re meeting Peter’s Aunt May and Clint’s wife Laura for lunch and we’re going to be late. You’ve meet Laura right?”
Rhodey’s eyes flickered down to his legs and he gave a small smile. “It sucks, but my best friend is a millionaire and a genius with a guilt complex and likes to fix things. Your best friend is an overgrown golden retriever with an attitude problem.”
Tony grumbled but drifted off to sleep anyways. Ever since he had started therapy and gotten some medication for ADHD it had been a lot easier to get some decent sleep. Which was a blessing for everyone.
He reached up and kissed Steve softly. Steve let himself be kissed and the next thing he knew the other man pushed him back off the dance floor sweeping away. Steve turned to find Scott an Clint they were gaping at him, his wide eyes, unkempt hair, and fully kissed lips, and the smile that accompanied it.
Steve pulled Bucky’s hands onto his waist and leaned into his fiancée's chest. He cleared his throat. “Bruce, Thor, this is my fiancée Bucky Barnes.”
Loki obeyed watching the spy close the book before retrieving the hairbrush that was kept in the kitchen for some reason. She hummed softly as she brushed. “More people are coming here today,” she announced, “Clint and Rhodey’s daughter Wanda is going to come home with her boyfriend Vision.”
“I’ll have Friday run an analytical behavioral study to see if he’s trying to trick us,” Tony offered.
Tony almost asked where Steve was but they weren’t there yet. Tony put his hands into his pockets. “Sure,” he stated, “waiting is good.”
Loki inspected Sam. Who was kind. Who let him cry and grieve and didn’t ask too many questions. Who had a soft smile. “You dressed for the day?”
Clint and Rhodey beamed because Wanda was just amazing, ok. “And your quiet active with your college's Women’s Rights Club is that correct.”
Sam shrugged and Tony whipped his face. “No more magic people. I do science, not magic,” he kept muttering as he walked back inside.
Both boys rolled their eyes. Bucky grunted and they took off running. Tony frowned. “I thought this was a club? Like the let's drink and get frisky club."
Rhodey sighed and took a long drink. “I’m reading them so I can get them fired from their jobs,” Tony stated.
Bucky recovers in Wakanda with help from Shuri, and later Steve goes bar hopping with Scott and Clint. Sam is a good third wheel and gets an important call.
“I don’t want guilt,” Loki told him turning his lips up into a cruel snarl, “or pity. I made my choices in life and I do not regret them. I want what I’ve wanted for centuries. I want your love and nothing else.”
The three other people let out various noises of disbelief and horror. “You haven’t seen the videos! Sam, you asshole what have you been doing with him,” Rhodey demanded.
Natasha looked at the young spider and the badly wrapped box. She took it gingerly. “This is for me?”
“Why have you not started an apprenticeship,” Loki asked Wanda as her breath evened out and her eyes cleared.
With F.R.I.D.A.Y’s help, Peter made it to his Dad’s office. He started poking around getting distracted by the desk toys with moving parts, but he soon got bored and moved on. His eye was drawn to the photo frames on one wall. He peered closely at the first one.
Wanda and Loki dissolved into laughter as Peter went on and Vision chuckled. Loki didn’t answer the question, but the four of them settled into soft chatter. Loki watched Wanda start to sift off to sleep leaning against Vision who gave her a look of pure adoration as he combed his fingers through her hair. Peter slumped off as well Loki felt light and his stomach was settled and full. He rubbed his eyes to keep them open. “Oh, Pete,” Tony sighed looking down at his kid and ruffling his hair.
Loki hesitated but he was too enamored by the garden to not explore. Loki was naturally curious. It bit him in the ass more often than not. But he couldn’t curb it. No matter how hard he had tried. Loki explored the garden until the sun started to set. “Loki” Sam called “yell if you are alive.”
Loki jerked at the female-sounding voice that came through the room. “She’s installed through the house, and talks and see through cameras in the room.”
Loki flicked his fingers out for a second. “I never lived on Jotunheim” Loki admitted “Odin stole the power from the planet in order to slowly kill it, so what I saw was shambles of what it once was, but Jotunheim is too cold for it to allow many animals to survive and most are not very big. So instead the crops adapted to grow in the freezing cold and the Jotun learned how to fish and create fisheries in the cold. I believe your word is pescatarian. While other meats are not lethal they are not easy on Frost Giant digestion or break down in the way that food should. Besides that, it does not matter what I eat.”
He poured himself a shot and took it. “You got the good stuff for Nat right,” he asked as soon as he put the glass down.
And if you came to me right now I would try to fix all of our issues still, but I don’t know if I want that or even if you will ever want that again. I hope Pepper and Rhodey are ok. Sam checks the news twice a day about Rhodey’s condition, you were a dick for shooting him by the way.
The best part was the small girl in Cap’s lap with a prosthetic leg and a smile of adoration toward Bucky that mirrored Cap’s. “Pep,” Tony whined, “he’s using kids now!”
She had shown Bucky her version of Minecraft which was some even more futuristic roleplay virtual reality thing that Steve planned on not going near, but he watched from the screen as Bucky played.
Wanda still wasn’t sure about that. “One of us can go over first,” he told her softly coming to sit by her side, “you don’t have to go.”
“I’m a chaotic gay if anyone cares,” Bucky piped up bringing up his flesh hand with Steve’s to show off the golden rings they were wearing, “and last night I made dinner in our old apartment and purposed. Thanks for the help Ashly.”
Tony gulped. “Sam and Steve were afraid that her angry arrival would aggravate me. The only time I really did anything was when I thought Steve was in danger. A second assassin waving knives around yelling that seemed like a situation that wouldn’t end pleasantly, but it was actually the opposite. It was like I was processing the world correctly for the first time. The only thing I was capable of was to offer her my understanding.”
Loki shivered, but Sam went on. “Relationships can be really different though. When all parties are consenting it’s a good thing. No one is suppose to get hurt and if they do it’s not on purpose. They stop and work it out or leave the relationship. Steve and Bucky, Darcy and Jane, Rylie and I, those are safe relationships and a lot of other people have safe sane and consenting relationships. They want to be together. And for the community of people who fall for people of the same sex, a twink just means a smaller guy who’s more feminine, usually, but they aren’t in danger because of that. For a lot of people in the community, it’s kind of an affectionate term, some don’t really like it. The important thing is that no one hurts them just because they are small and they aren’t weak either.”
Peter handed over the phone. Bucky put Shuri’s number in it and then put his and Steve’s in as well. “Is she ok with that,” Peter asked.
Steve rolled his eyes. Bucky trailed his flesh fingers through Steve's hair searching his face for the emotions he knew Steve was hiding. “How are you feeling" he questioned when Steve refused to say anything first.
Mind control is not something you can build a tolerance against, but there is a clarity you can gain, a version of control. When the Chitauri sent me here to take over I created a plan that would take me away from the scepter. If I could get away from it for long enough I could kill myself, or trick someone into doing it. Nothing went to plan. Or maybe it went exactly to plan. I was freed when Natasha stole the scepter and used it to break the portal. The spells tied to the scepter disappeared when that happened and I was free. But it was too late to do anything. I am a liar and a trickster,” Loki shrugged and curled his knees into his chest, “and Thor,” Loki shook his head violently, “he would not let me die. I wanted to see Frigga, so I didn’t fight.”
I hope you all enjoy. I'm writing this, and I know it's pretty jumbled, but it's basically a world-building activity for me. I'll spruce this up later, but I wanted to get it on paper and out there, so here's the start. Sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes.
Fuck you. Seriously you can just fuck off. There is no way in hell you ever deserved Steve, not that I do either, but that’s another story, who did you think you were messing with. Steve if a fucking person. A person Stark, not like you would understand that. He’s so mad and pissed off at you, you have no idea. Don’t worry though I’m going to enlighten you. Buckle up, sweetheart. And what the hell is wrong with you bringing that kid into battle. I could have hurt him! Jesus, Stark. That was just an asshole move on all parts. Good job winning that custody battle, you dick. Here’s the letter that Steve should have sent you, but you know he’s such a good person he would rather make peace than take care of his own feelings.
Cho instructed Natasha to put Peter in another awaiting ice bath to keep his temperature from rising which it had been doing. Natasha cursed something strong. Which made Peter cry out so she forced herself to calm and stay next to him.
The pair left. Sam and Loki put the cactus on the window sill. “I’m heading out to,” Natasha announced walking in.
“I don’t care if you are dating,” she snapped, “I care if the family you built here is there for you. Family comes in a lot of different ways Sam and I don’t care one bit what you got as long as you’re happy.”
Sam heard the other car door shut. Wanda stoped walking. She stared at Loki for a moment as he stared hard at the ground. She made a soft cooing sound and walked straight over to him. “Hi, Lo,” she greeted and kissed his cheek, “thank you for coming to see me.”
After some time Sam took Loki back to his room. “F.R.I.D.A.Y tell Loki I am in the next room over when he wakes up tell him where I am, and alert me.”
Steve pulled out his phone and handed it over to Tony. “He’s been operating for about a year now and calls himself Spiderman.”
Natasha laughed and they stepped into the kitchen. Sam waved putting a piece of pie on a plate. “Hey,” he greeted.
Pepper pulled back and stroked his hair. “You can call me anything you are comfortable with,” she swore, “but it makes me very happy that you think of me as a mother like figure.”
The three men. Three giants smiled. Sam and Bucky both threw their arms around Cap’s shoulders. “You hear that Punk,” Bucky snorted, “I think he likes you.”
Behind the camera, Tony laughed and Peter stuck his hand up and pointed at the girl. “I can’t believe my own son is trying to disown me” Tony teased.
Sam hadn’t thought that Loki would notice that. “Tony has a son,” Sam answered, “and Clint has a daughter.”
I should be jealous that my boyfriend is pinning over another fucking man, but call me selfish that I like him happy. You’re a coward for not contacting him. Emotional damage be damned. I don’t know what in hell is holding you back, but figure it the fuck out.
“It’s ok. Steve still has the worst track record,” Natasha assured sliding the board back into place.
It really shouldn’t have surprised anyone when Loki got sick. They had come from thinking of him as a strange alien god to a really sad teenager. There was team therapy involve. So Loki was treated no different than Peter and Wanda in the teenage department. But he was still Loki. While he didn’t use magic often it wasn’t unusual to find him levitating an object he needed or if he was in a particularly good mood creating a small minuscule illusions of things like a backpack in the middle of the floor, or a plate of food, just to see if they would try to grab it or trip over it. Tony thought (correctly) that if Loki could do more deviant acts he probably would.
Thor left that afternoon with Valkyrie on his heels, who said a fond farewell to Natasha. Mj was there and she had a word with the women before she left. “Well Lo,” Tony said resting his chin on top of Loki’s head, “I got to say I’m glad that I don’t cause the most drama here anymore.”
Tony sighed leaning back. “It wasn’t all my fault, but he had a point. I was so caught up trying to fix what I thought was wrong I forgot about everyone else. That’s on me.”
Sam vaguely remembered that. “Yup,” he agreed anyway because he suddenly didn't care what he had to do to fix all of this.
Natasha chuckled and the pair left Loki to get used to his new room on his own. Natasha helped Sam make dinner and eventually corralled Loki back down to eat.
He released her slowly like he was afraid she would disappear otherwise. He whipped the tears away and then his own. “How was the flight,” he asked walking over and grabbing her bag and tossing it over his shoulder.
They kissed soft and slow. People clapped the interviewer teared up. When they separated Steve blushed and looked at the camera. “So I’m bisexual,” he announced his jaw locking.
Bucky lead the two of them out of the car. The news reporters stopped flashing their cameras. Occasionally Bucky would break a few cameras if they got to close to his face and no one was risking that today apparently. The former assassin was scary enough that the reporters had learned to show him respect. Men in military uniforms spanned the halls of the buildings. They glared at Sam, and Natasha, and Bucky.
He stretched out an arm and Sam took it kneeling beside the bed. Loki grasped it like a lifeline. “You are too kind to me.”
And Loki’s subconscious had chosen a form that could pass for Sam’s son. Loki strolled out of the room and started to play Kidz bop again. Sam called Steve and started to complain. Steve was unsympathetic.
“I have a spell cursed upon me that prevents me from harming anyone. The Magic has a mind of its own, and the mind of its maker. Thor does not trust magic and since he instructed the spell through Heimdall the spell must see my magic as a weapon and I can not direct it at another even their own magic. I would suggest taking a step back.”
Did Thor not know that Loki had had children? Probably not. Jesus. “I’m going to use Tony’s credit cards to start ordering books and other stuff,” Jane announced before pulling Darcy away, “you can start moving everything up here!”
At that moment I could only think about how to protect everyone. How to keep us from splitting up-the family we were creating. The perception that I had of what that was what you were wasn’t true. I knew you were holding things back, but I also figured you would open up in time.
“She’s out with Rhodey,” Natasha explained, “and while this whole ordeal has been funny you can’t tell me it’s healthy.”
Thunder crackled through the house. “Tony didn’t schedule a storm today did he, ” Sam asked because Tony could do weird shit with the weather in the neighborhood, but Natasha was down the hallway before the words could finish escaping his lips.
Better until she was on the plane by herself. Wanda hated being alone. More than anything. She had never been alone. The longest she had ever been away from Pietro was five minutes and even that had felt crushing. Now without him it suffocating and being alone made it so much worse. Not many people could stand to be near her, caught into much fear, but the Avengers could and for the most part she was welcomed with open arms. But the plane Tony sent was self-automated so she had no one and nothing.
At Steve’s silence, Bucky rolled to his side propping up his head to mirror Steve. “You have that stupid look on your face again,” Bucky noted.
Sam nodded and finished putting the plates away. Then he joined Loki in the living room. Loki was sitting in the floor his legs crossed watching a breakdance routine on repeat. Sam sat against the couch. Loki doesn’t look at him, either entranced by the dance or purposefully ignoring Sam.
Two months later Tony was sitting in his kitchen reading a news article, and he smiled. A new gay bar in France was wildly popular as a thematic club called Vengers. They were known for their insanely good look alike constant the fan favorite the Avengers.
He starts drinking again. A lot. Too much. He doesn't tell Pepper, doesn't tell anyone else. It doesn't matter.
They’ve been best friends for years now. But for all Tony brags that it takes a lot to scare him, Rhodey has never had a problem sneaking up on him.
He takes a step forward, placing his hands on Tony’s shoulders and holding his gaze, begging him to understand.
“Obadiah has an SI issued email, and a personal one. I'm going to get into both, see if I can access his bank details. Recent transactions can be a killer.”
When he gets back, Tony is still asleep. He sinks back into his position on the floor, and stays put.
Eventually, even the thought of Steve’s stupid, startlingly blue eyes can’t push it back, and the numb detachment sweeps in. He wishes he was scared of it, because then maybe he would fight it more.
Tony huffs out a laugh, letting his mind linger on one name before deciding against it. “Unfortunately no. But they’re intelligent kids. They’ll do well in life.”
Did he know? Yes, because it was pretty obvious from how he felt this morning, and Ty wasn’t subtle.
“I mean it.” He says again, soft and honest and real, because Tony doesn’t hear it enough, if the look on his face is any indication. Steve tugs him closer, leaning in to press a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “I love you.”
“Look,” Tony says carefully, because he’s not in a position to be pushing Steve for anything, not after today. “I didn’t want to-”
His second phone, the one with Steve’s number, the one with Rhodey’s number, is in his jacket pocket in his room. Obadiah’s tone doesn’t leave a lot of space for arguing.
As far as shitty field trips go, Tony thinks as they follow the tour guide through the Met, it could be worse.
“Nope, believe it or not, I’m way too behind on work to get a job. I only came here to make fun of you. I’ll be going, now that we’ve done that.”
“Screw the stitches.” Steve says, voice low, and he hears Tony’s breath hitch slightly, but he pulls away again anyway.
“Tony.” He says quietly, reaching out and taking his hand. He ignores the pain, it doesn’t matter right now. “It’s not worth it.”
“Yeah. I don’t want… you’re ridiculously hot. But I don’t want to rush, or do anything you’re not okay with.”
But no matter how much Tony pushes him away, he knows Steve won’t break, he won’t run, he won’t leave him alone.
He wonders if he ever would go back to work for Obadiah. He suspects not, even though the temptation is there, small as it is. But however you look at it, the facts remain the same. Someone had gone under the table and dealt to terrorists, had dealt
Tony tenses, a spike of fear going through him. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the Captain frown slightly, eyes flicking between Tony and the director in front of them. If Tony says no, he suspects Fury will tell the Captain anyway. If he says yes, he’s agreeing to the mission. But judging by the look on Fury’s face, no isn’t really a word the man is used to hearing.
For a second, Tony just stares at him, eyes a little wide. Steve realises he doesn’t know what he’s thinking, doesn’t know what he’s going to do. The thought scares him a little, but he doesn’t move, doesn’t let his hands drop.
“Bi,” he corrects gently, though he thinks he’s a bit past correcting people on his sexuality. The press know him as one thing, and hopefully it will
He swallows hard, closing his eyes for a second. It’s quiet here, there’s no roaring noise in his head, but no numbness either. He feels… peaceful, for the first time in a while.
Tony leans forward, pulling the file towards him and flipping it open. “You said you’re sending us into a base. How do we know it’ll actually be any use?”
“You should’ve just let him do it.” He whispers, and then he’s just crying, crying in a way he hasn’t in years. He can’t breathe, but the rain is a constant around them, washing away everything else. Washing away the fear, the pain, the tears, everything.
He’s twisting his fingers together, wondering how much to say, wondering just how much to talk about because Steve has just saved him from his nightmare-
“Don’t believe everything you hear on wikipedia.” Tony says with a laugh, poking Peter gently in the arm. “Besides, the Captain isn’t a-”
Tony feels older right now, despite the fact that he's pretty sure he’s younger than Steve by a couple of years. It’s a stupid question, one that he doesn’t even have the energy to answer sarcastically
He hears the car pull up before he hears anything else, and his heart leaps in his chest. He squashes the panic before it can take root, brushing an invisible piece of dust off his shirt. It’s fine. He’s fine.
He doesn’t remember falling, but he’s on the floor, pulling his knees up to his chest, trying desperately to catch his breath. Steve’s hoodie, Steve’s smile, Steve-
right now, because why is it suddenly the world's fucking greatest shock that Tony Stark can appreciate a piece of art.
Friday night, tomorrow morning, then he’s back in the afternoon. Steve’s words float back into his head.
Hope you liked this! If anyone wants to come and yell at me, my instagram and tumblr are @wordsxstars. Thank you for the support on this so far!
Steve looks like he’s about to be sick. “You didn’t report it.” Not a question. Tony just shakes his head, shoving the memories down, locking them away because
He watches as he swallows hard, clearly dragging himself out of his own thoughts. When Tony smiles at him, there’s an ache in Steve's chest, because it’s the practiced one, and it’s no longer fully real.
Steve raises his eyebrows, glancing between his boyfriend and the computer. (Boyfriend. He isn’t sure if that word will ever stop making him smile.)
“I- I was at the party. Rhodey left. I was drinking. Then someone- it felt weird. Dizzy...Ty took me out of the room."
His phone is in his room, in his coat pocket. It’s on silent because Steve had been here and Steve had been in his bed so he hadn’t been
“Don’t be dramatic. I put his number on it. It’s your choice whether to text him or not.” She frowns slightly. “Also don’t sell it to the paparazzi.”
Steve assures him that the place where the art is being shown will be nearly empty by the time they get there. Tony doesn’t worry about it, because he trusts him.
Steve watches as Tony takes a sip and closes his eyes, just taking in the sight of the billionaire. There’s something strangely intimate about watching Tony when he doesn’t know he’s being watched. There’s a softness on his face that no one else really sees, a softness that comes with being vulnerable, something that Steve knows is rare. As he watches, a stray curl falls into Tony’s face, and without hesitating, he reaches up and tucks it back again, hand hovering against his cheek.
After two days, he had felt on edge, jumpy in his own skin. All it had taken was Howard having one two many drinks and a bad day at work, and on the third day, Tony had locked himself in the bathroom for an hour, and thrown up everything in his stomach.
He pushes that out of his mind, because he hates them, and Tony is buying him dinner somewhere he could never
Tony spins around fast, feeling too much like a kid just caught eating in class. The Captain is standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame . His face is carefully neutral, but his blue eyes are practically
He shakes his head, exasperated, and looks at the phone in his hand. The smart thing, he knows, would be to get rid of that number, and stay the hell away from Tony Stark and his practiced, beautiful smiles.
Steve sits up fast, hands steady and solid on his face as he cups it. Tony can’t breathe, he still can’t fucking breathe or move as wave after wave after wave of grief crashes over him. It’s endless, it’s drowning him, it’s suffocating and there’s no end, it just keeps coming. He can’t see, can’t think, and can’t breathe. He wonders if this is what it feels like to finally break. What would happen if he just let it sweep him away?
“Of course,” says Obie with the smile that Tony hates. “But your father is the host, and he’s given me permission to get rid of anyone… making trouble.”
The other man’s smooth voice comes through the line, and Steve tenses because he hates it for a reason that he can’t put his finger on.
Tony folds his arms, and it looks like he’s trying to be cool, neutral, but there’s a tension in him, a pain he can’t hide.
Clint raises his eyebrows. “By any chance does it have anything to do with a guy? Or a billionaire? Or
“He-” Tony takes a deep breath, forcing himself not to admit just how much he wants to go back in and see if Steve is okay. “You can’t punch him. That won’t
The customer ahead of him finished and wandered off. On impulse, Bucky grabbed the magazine and shoved everything at the cashier. The poor young man probably said something polite or reasonable, but Bucky tuned him out and rushed through the motions of paying for his shit and booking it back to his car.
“Drink this,” she insisted, uncapping the bottle with her teeth and helping to angle the vial just so to pour as much of it into his wide mouth as possible.
Despite himself, Tony smiled a little at Steve’s question. “No,” Tony confirmed, smug in his spot of validation. “Their imagination is limited by how much they can destroy using science.”
Around them, officers and staff gasped in shock and revulsion. Jane had frozen at the first touch of Steve’s skin, and she stood imobile, staring at her sullied hand in horror.
Tony tipped his head to the side and gazed soulfully up at Steve, but Steve didn’t look back. He turned away, shook his head, and pretended his cheeks weren’t burning.
He packed up his laptop and notes then huddled into his leather jacket before joining Maria out of Hastings Hall. They walked in that stilted awkward silence of people who
“Happy Thanksgiving,” he mumbled between bites as Laura handed out spoons; they were all past the point of caring about plates. “Aren’t you glad you came?”
“Next initials,” he decided, and Carl obliged easily. Tony got the next one (Macaulay Culkin for MC), but Steve got the fourth point (Peter Stormare for PS). By the time Carl built up to the fifth set of initials, both Steve and Tony were so committed to beating the other that Steve’s publicist had to call it a tie.
“No,” Steve insisted, shaking his head adamantly. “No, I won’t, you’re wrong. How could it be the right thing if we’re not together?”
Doing his best not to move too quickly and jostle Steve awake, Tony swung his leg over and climbed off the bed, covering Steve with the comforter to keep him warm. He undressed quietly then slipped back under the covers to join Steve for an indulgent afternoon nap.
Back in the real world and safe from Tony’s inner turmoil, Steve—gentle, mild-mannered Steve who took Tony at his word—frowned in sympathy. “Then we need to figure out who they were. They’re not government agents, I’d bet the farm on that.”
“Is it just me or do some of these jokers look familiar?” Bucky whispered, and Tony caught Steve mutely nodding in reply.
Tony never left his side. He helped Steve address his people when Steve didn’t think he could breathe without crying, and he arranged the funeral when Steve couldn’t function. He was at Steve’s side through his coronation, and behind closed doors, where Steve had the privacy to fall apart, Tony stayed so Steve didn’t have to be alone. Steve didn’t had never learned to be alone, and the sudden silence was deafening. During his childhood their home on the farm had only been big enough for two rooms: one with beds, and one with a stove. Steve slept less than five feet from his parents until the war. Once he and his mother moved to a modest two-bedroom flat in Fiorera, Terrini’s capital, Steve spent the first month or so sleeping on the floor in his mother’s room. There was simply too much empty space for him to feel safe and his mattress was too soft.
Steve’s smile only grew wider and brighter. He kept eating the great, date-night food on his plate and watched Tony half-heartedly put things away and clean up around them.
“I thought I couldn’t hate them any more than I already do, you know?” Tony grumbled over a homemade lasagna Steve had thrown together after Tony stomped home from a particularly trying dinner in the Hamptons.
When Steve finally lifted his gaze and smirked back at Tony’s open admiration, Tony snapped his mouth shut and tried to stand at attention, or mimic the posture of anything but a schoolboy at the feet of his hero. Tony could feel himself growing lightheaded the more he stared at the breadth of the Captain’s shoulders, the strong line of his jaw, and the ferocity in his eyes.
Steve turned to look at him again, but this time Tony’s face was strategically hidden behind the script in his hands. Clearly, he wasn’t taking it as well as he wanted Steve to think.
There was a moment of silence where Steve could practically see Tony’s mind working over Steve’s words, but eventually he nodded and put his phone away. Steve gave him a grateful smile, then together, they started looking for Avis.
“Shit, it’s going to be one of those 80s classics or something, isn’t it?” Tony said half to himself, and half to Steve. “Is it…
Silent as the dead, 006 was standing in his studio. Tony gave a shout and nearly dropped his take-away. It took him a second to start shouting.
“I… I can’t tell anyone Bruce is my godfather, dad,” Steve muttered and dropped into a chair at his kitchen table. “They’ll either laugh me out of the Gazette or use me for connections. I might as well tell them Superman’s my dad.”
“What am I supposed to do? He’s engaged,” Steve reminded him as the man dried off his hands and started filing his nails into shape. “She’s got a family heirloom: she wears his grandmother’s six-carat diamond on her bony, unpolished finger.”
“And they accuse me of being romantic,” Tony muttered in feigned irritation, and he felt Steve’s silent laughter against his chest and in the strong arms holding him.
“Whatever you say or do, you are my best friend. But, I can’t—I couldn’t keep doing this. Lying. Pretending. If there’s anything you’ve taught me, it’s that. I’m realizing that I’m not straight. I’m not going to be quiet about it, publicly.”
“You feed me, you do the laundry,” Tony started listing while Steve peeled back the two sides of Tony’s shirt to expose his sleep-warm chest. With a quick flash of impish delight, Steve pressed an adoring kiss over Tony’s heart.
“Complicated?” Tony cried, shooting to his feet in outrage as he moved on from horrified to outright offended. Instinctively, Steve copied him so that they stood face to face, so Tony would not have the satisfaction of talking down to him. “Steven G. Rogers, that is no longer done! Rampant exchanges of bodily fluids was one of the major downfalls of society! After AIDS there was NRS, and then came UBT, a death sentence. Outlawing fluid transfer was one of the first and most important behavioral changes the benevolent Governor Alexander G. Pierce instilled in us, and it has allowed our society to thrive.”
Someone in the back raised their hand and identified the author as Brené Brown. Stromwell gave her usual nod of acknowledgement, but as she turned to get the day started, she faced Steve. Unlike her characteristic intensity that demanded the very best of him, Stromwell looked pleased to see him.
Tony Stark posts a photo of what looks like a ceiling with a mysterious message that sounds a lot like…… an ENGAGEMENT announcement???
Steve found himself unexpectedly pleased to have a comfortable rider behind him, and at the first red light, he couldn’t resist turning his head just enough to ask, “How you doing?”
“Mom, what’s Reverend Stanley’s car doing out back?” Tony asked, because between the two of them, he had technically lived a longer life. He hoped Steve would remember him fondly.
“We know,” Bucky told the pilot before Steve had to remind the young man that not too long ago, this craggly region was a bitter battleground where straggling bands of starving soldiers had gathered - making the climb in small, unnoticed groups - until they had the numbers to take the farmlands back from Stane. Steve’s father had always pressed on the importance of food and water: controlling the food supply was the first step in taking their country back.
“Thank you,” Channing still replied with genuine gratitude and a smile in his voice, and by some awful, poorly timed luck, Tony finally intervened.
As promised, Steve was waiting for him at the gate. Tony dropped his canvas shopping bag into the seat beside Steve and leisurely swaggered the three last steps that brought him to Steve’s feet.
Tony’s world stopped spinning the minute he laid eyes on him. Tall, broad-shouldered, and so damn hot Tony could feel himself salivating at the same time as his whole mouth ran dry.
“Clint—well, he didn’t say, actually, but he said you weren’t talking about me. And, I. I don’t …if you don’t care, then I don’t care, Stephanie,” he finally said, more carefully. “I trust you, and, I care about you; I care about you very much, in fact. If, you would still have me, that is.”
“You like that name, huh?” Steve asked rhetorically, snickering quietly to himself. Tony’s bright laughter filled the house with a contagious buoyancy that Steve could feel in his heart and in his soul. He couldn’t stop smiling, happy for no other reason than that Tony was happy.
Fear rose with such force in Tony’s chest that it nearly choked him. “Steve Rogers, don’t!” he cried, and Steve turned to him with a questioning look. “Perhaps it is not the flesh of children, but do you see any cattle here? We are literally standing above excrement, this is not a sanitary environment for meal preparation. Do not risk your health so needlessly.”
“Hey, how many times do you need to hear me say it before you believe me, Tony? What’s on your mind?”
Tony was on hold and humming along to the pleasant melodies on the phone later that morning when Bruce rushed into their office.
Fear shuttered across Steve’s expression, and it was so unlike anything Tony had seen in his eyes that he couldn’t begin to interpret what it meant. Steve even tried to look away from him, but Tony wouldn’t let him go, and he waited patiently for Steve to lift his gaze again to meet Tony’s eyes.
In those moments, his mother’s words would float back through his thoughts, dispelling any hope of abandoning his responsibilities. He was intended to take the business. His parents, she would always remind him, were always on his side. They wanted him to live a good life, a life uninhibited by the burdens they had faced themselves. Tony had so many more resources and luxuries than they had ever grown up with, and she often reminded him that it was all thanks to his father’s genius and endless effort. What mattered most was the company now, and all the families that relied on Stark Industries for their livelihood. Investors believed in the Stark genius, they trusted Howard Stark’s son as the only person to produce equally profitable marvels in the coming generation. Without Tony, investments would suffer, and the families depending on them would be without work, without an income.
“There’s a home game tonight,” she told him within seconds. “The Detroit Red Wings. I think that’s a good team, too.”
“Nicer clothes?” Steve couldn’t help but blurt out. He looked down at himself and picked at his perfectly good button-up in genuine confusion. When did slacks and a collared shirt become the wrong choice? “What’s wrong with my clothes?”
“We don’t have a leader, we work together,” Bucky told him, then a little more gently, he said, “Natasha is here, too, Steve. But if it’s her he’s after… he’s in for a world of pain.”
kind of experience, no,” Steve said under his breath once he recovered. “Communication. You’re right, Tony,” he said, turning to address Tony directly. “I feel uncomfortable when people stare at me for being different, for standing out. And when they do it because of something you do, then it is difficult for me to—to not be frustrated with you. But I don’t know how to say that in the moment, when I’m angry, in an effective way.”
“Probably cause you’re dressed like a dude who owns peacocks,” Sam pointed out, but Steve only gave him a flat look.
No air travel, no celebration of diversity, but apparently Taco Bell was a black tie affair. Nothing about the future made sense.
Steve kissed like he had a lifetime to spare and Tony was all that mattered. At first, it was only an innocent touch of his lips, soft and imploring against Tony’s. Without pulling back, Steve wetted his lips, tasting Tony’s bottom lip as he did; Tony moaned shamelessly and listed forward in eager pursuit, yielding at his first opportunity to Steve’s kiss.
Steve’s eyes must have bugged out at the question. He missed one assignment, did that really warrant public shaming? He swallowed down his discomfort and turned to Sharon with a small (mortified) smile.
Tony’s face lit up with delight, and he got to his feet at once. “If that will make you more comfortable, I will endeavour to do so for the time that we have sex. Allow me to get ready.”
“His name is Captain Steven Grant Rogers, retired from the US Army,” Tony whispered with reverent wonder, staring at his computer terminal with unblinking eyes as he absorbed every ounce of information from Captain America’s case file. Under the circumstances, he had been provided with exceptional clearance to read all the recorded information about Steven G. Rogers - everything that he’d never had access to before. He read the available facts about his life from the 30s and 40s in the 20th, and also later in the 10s and 20s of the 21st. Some information corroborated the legends Tony had studied, while others defied them entirely, but either way, Tony was spellbound by all he was learning about his greatest hero.
When they parted for breath, Steve was on the verge of laughter again. “Perhaps you are right,” he conceded, “but never forget, mein Schafes. It is only my appetite for you that is insatiable.”
Tony couldn’t contain his smile when Steve kissed the bridge of his nose, and he wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist to squeeze even closer. “Dawn and dusk,” he said, explaining in undertone. It was only for Steve to hear, after all. “There’s something hopeful about them. One thing ends and another thing begins. You can do anything, then soon it’s night or morning and you have a fresh start.”
“Shut up,” he told it as the vibrations turned to loud ringing, taunting him while he dug his phone out from all the other crap in his bag.
Tony scoffed and looked away from Steve long enough to give her an unimpressed look. “Cause he fucking owned you guys?”
The question caught Steve by surprise. He hadn’t seen Bucky in over two decades; who was to say Bucky even wanted to see him?
It took a moment for Steve to absorb Tony’s reply, but Tony saw the moment the tension bled out of Steve’s straining grip, and the gratifying look of pleasant surprise in his expression.
Steve perked up at the question, grinning wickedly at the thought. “Oh, I sure hope so, that would be so hot—”
“Natasha wears unicorn print underwear—oh, shit,” Steve mumbled in surprise, digging through a bag until he got to a little cardboard box that smelled incredible. He pressed it to his nose and inhaled deeply. “Shit, this is good. What is it?”
“Rough case,” the man said with a rueful smile. “You ever deal with someone who doesn’t want to be helped? My client’s building a better case against himself than the opposing counsel.”
“It would be my pleasure,” Tony replied sincerely, pulling her in for a hug. She gave him a quick peck on the lips, then kissed Steve and Rhodey on their cheeks before wishing them all a good night.
“My apologies,” the man promised, but Steve only looked at the man with more disgust. He was clearly in his forties, and his voice was somewhere in the Batman range, if Batman came with the super-smooth velvet option. He looked expensive, with his long, salon-straightened hair and fancy manicure. Whatever he had in his wallet, he wasn’t getting away with thinking he owned Steve, too.
“Tony? I mean, uh,” Steve stammered for a moment as he caught himself. “Stark, sorry. If your hand is still hurting—“
He left Tony with a quick peck on the cheek and made his way to the kitchen to see what he could scrounge out of the fridge. They’d gone through a pizza-baking phase recently that had quickly become a calzone-making phase, and Steve hung in the open fridge door trying to decide between a mushroom, feta, and olive, and a ham and extra cheese.
“Inform them that I will take the meeting,” Steve said before Pepper had to ask. “If other calls or meetings come up, either schedule them for next month or direct them to me. Until Dr. Betz arrives, bring me something for his fever. A lot of tea, and a bowl of room temperature water with some towels. And inform the staff that I don’t want any service without explicit invitation while he is recovering. You and Natasha are welcome as needed, but that door is closed to all others.”
Rumlow’s life had become an embarrassment of riches. All these treats gathered and assembled for him, without so much as a security guard to stand in his way. Somehow, a thieving patron was inconceivable. They’d even left a cannon from the US Civil War on display in the middle of the open room, complete with its accompanying gunpowder and cannonballs. Nothing stood between Rumlow and the AcMag except a sheet of reinforced glass.
“Maybe? I’d rather plan a memorable date than a memorable outfit,” Steve admitted absently as he shaded in the gentle arch of Tony’s exposed foot. “Pretty sure Tony’s happy as long as he can get me out of it without scissors.”
They were in the air on their way to Seoul when Steve received Tony’s reply. Tony had recorded a short video in the dim light of the full moon on a stroll through the palace grounds. Steve could see the stars in the clear sky all around his husband; their beauty couldn't compete with Tony for his attention, but it was a pleasant thought to imagine Tony enjoying the fresh air on such a pleasant night. As expected, Jim had gotten no further than praising Maribel for her dazzling creativity and captivating performance. Tony confided in Steve that Lila seemed unexpectedly blue in Steve’s absence at the art exhibit, and that she’d insisted on pasta for lunch. Steve burst out laughing when Tony admitted they both ordered Steve’s favorite meal, mushroom ricotta ravioli. As the palace lights came back into view, Tony wished him a good night, peaceful rest, and reminded Steve how much he was looking forward to hearing from him soon.
Tony only frowned and crossed his arms over his chest. “After that welcome, you think you deserve an introduction?”
Tony’s embarrassed laughter escaped in a soft squeak of amusement. “Anything you haven’t figured out yet, Steve?”
“Fine, whatever. Sorry, ma’am,” he said to Jane before turning back to Tony. “Where’s the bathroom?”
Whatever Tony had meant to say was forgotten as Steve picked up the couch he was sitting in without so much as grunting with exertion. Steve continued to effortlessly hold the couch in midair so that they were eye to eye.
write up his dating profile,” Natasha said to Tony as if Steve wasn’t qualified to take part in the discussion anymore. “Your notes are clear and I have the other profiles as guides. You take him shopping.”
“Shh, down, girl—enough,” he managed when he finally pushed her away. She rolled off, obedient but grudgingly so, and lay as close to his side as she could, begging for more pets and love with her whole body. Her butt shook with the force of her wagging tail and her toe-beans flexed into the bedding in her excitement, but she was determined to lay still on the bed like a good, patient dog.
Steve didn’t frown, or look confused. He only hummed quietly in understanding and smiled back at Tony, like he’d been given a new piece of the puzzle in front of him. “Thank you for telling me,” he whispered, then curiously asked, “Anything else you don’t like in the morning?”
An immediate crisis meeting was called in Tony’s apartment that afternoon. Bruce brought the booze, and Thor brought more booze.
Over at his desk, Bruce was too jittery to find any peace, with or without his enormous mug of Mellow Fellow green tea. He shuffled papers around, watered his desk plants, and skimmed work related messages with unseeing eyes before giving up and crossing the room from his feng shui appropriate half to the half Tony had littered with health risk violations and vulgar 21st century memorabilia.
Tony’s fingers twitched with the need to reach out for Steve’s hand and take his ring back. For the first time in his life, he felt that phantom weight on his left ring finger fellow socialites had often told him about, an undeniable reminder of a part of him that was missing. For them it was a well-paying MRS degree; for Tony, it was only Steve.
Tony tore off the ticket from the morality box and added it to the growing collection on his desk. “Steve Rogers, it would take me a long time to explain, and I promise to do so at the earliest opportunity. Until then, Captain, I am your steward, and I cannot help you assimilate unless you place your faith in me.”
Tony bent at the waist to bodily lean over Steve, murmuring words of praise and kissing him everywhere he could reach. “Fucking hell, you’re gorgeous,” Tony murmured as he kissed his collarbone, tasting Steve’s sweat and feeling the wild rise and fall of his chest as he struggled to catch his breath.
Steve stopped and immediately backed off. “I don’t know what that text says, Tony,” he said in deliberately gentle and calm voice, “but, if it’s Carter, she’s my assistant. She happened to be with me when we first met. She, she’s the one who calls you that,” he clarified in his own defense.
“Breathe,” Tony told Steve in a whisper. This time, Steve did as Tony said, breathing in slow and steady through his nose. With one hand on Steve’s hip, Tony shuffled just a little closer, lining them up carefully, and then there was no turning back.
Steve frowned and smoothed his hand over his polo shirt again, as if to comfort himself that it looked better than what Sharon was suggesting. “Don’t insult me: it was 400 hundred dollars.”
“Are there more puppies?” Steve wondered, and Tony immediately seconded the question. “If there are more puppies, yes, more questions.”
“No, no, hey don’t, don’t worry. I’ll go get the—look, I’m gonna go do it right now, just, just breathe, and—mom? Can you get him water?”
Like so many nights before, Steve nestled up close to his man, made space for himself between his arms, and turned so his back was pressed flush against Tony’s chest. He counted Tony’s slow, even breaths, pressed his relaxed hands to his lips in a good night kiss, and slowly drifted to peaceful sleep.
“No, because I like it and it’s a great cover for sneaking away from the party! Which reminds me, why did Bruce Wayne come up to you? Do you know him?”
He had almost pulled all the way out when Tony thrust his hips back and impaled himself on Steve’s hard, fat cock. Steve’s heart dropped, but Tony was so terribly eager and enthusiastic that Steve couldn’t stop him. On wide-spread knees and braced against the couch for leverage, Tony rolled his strong hips back with expert control, snapping his hips up every time he bottomed out to let Steve enjoy a front row view and the unmistakable sound of his ass cheeks clapping loudly together.
Historically, surprises that follow six weeks of missed dates and flimsy excuses weren’t the kind of surprises Tony liked.
“Yeah, he’s here,” Steve said when he finally caved and let his dad in. “We’ll call you back,” he told his mom over the phone. He watched his dad walk across the living room to the bathroom, and with a tired sigh, he accusatively added, “dad’s tracking ash all over my carpet.”
“No pockets,” he explained, shaking his arms to show how his whole costume was no more than a long piece of fabric, a belt, and a pin. Tony eyed him impishly, taking it upon himself to confirm Steve was telling the truth.
“Oh, damn. We haven’t been to Shield in years,” Steve said with a smile, and when Bucky offered him a hand to help him up, Steve took it without question.
Tony smirked at him and chewed on his bacon with a smug look. “Not the first time I’ve been called that, and it sure won’t be the last,” he said. “But I am a disaster who’s got a fence to finish up. Should be done by lunch?”
“I don’t… I really don’t know if I can do that, mom. I don’t know what I’d do without you,” he whispered unevenly, swallowing back against the lump in his throat.
The chief priest’s attendants did as they were told. Some held Ean by the ankles to extend his legs until his straining muscles of his thighs could stretch no farther. Others grasped his calves and his thighs as space allowed, immobilizing him until their pulling and stretching lifted Ean’s hips off the altar by their collective strength.
Steve huffed a soft laugh and squeezed Tony’s hand gently. “I liked it better when you called me Steve.”
“Shh! I’m in,” Tony quickly hissed at him, turning back to the computer now that he was past the encryptions. The thumb drive did quick work of gathering all of Wayne’s browsing history and his saved passwords while Tony scanned the likeliest corners of his hard drive for incriminating evidence.
As if in concert with Bucky’s explanation, the footage on the screen shifted to an abrupt montage of both professional and amateur video clips of the gates coming down around what was old Machtberg, and the new defensive walls rising from the ground around old Terrini. The Kingdom was sealed, and no soul would pass in or out of the country until it was deemed safe.
Bond took his time, alternating between eating out Belova until she was spewing curses in her native Georgian, and fucking her with slow, powerful rolls of his hips. The pattern intentionally kept Belova on the verge of orgasm for many minutes longer, and provided Bond precious time to calm himself each time.
Slowly, ever so carefully, Steve pressed the fattest bead against Tony’s hole. Tony whined, strained and breathless, as his body stretched to accommodate a girth of two and a half inches. When he dared to open his eyes, the first thing he saw was the spellbound expression on Steve’s face as he watched the toy sink deeper into Tony’s body with minimal resistance. He pulled the toy out slowly, clearly wanting Tony to feel the burning sting of discomfort of every glass bead more than once.
“What! The Rock bench pressed you?” Tony said with a snap of attention, clearly shocked and very intrigued. After a beat, he whispered, “How many reps?”
“Give him a chance to explain, Buck. You don’t have to love him,” Steve gently pointed out, “you just have to be nice.”
He grabbed an extra bottle of orange juice for Sam who was by all accounts allergic to drinking out of glasses, and with a basket full of Nutter Butters and Korean barbecue kettle chips, he made his way to the check out. The self check-outs were closed for maintenance and only one cashier was doomed to work at the asscrack of dawn, so Bucky hung back from the only other customer in line and looked over the typical impulse purchase options half-heartedly until it was his turn.
“Grab it,” he said after a few seconds of consideration. “It’d be a good signal that you know what you’re doing.”
“Yeah,” he agreed, in a whisper. “You’re right, that wasn’t my call to make. I am sorry,” he said, making himself look up at Steve for those words, even if for a second. “For… for messing up your life, or career, or—anything else, you know, that I can’t think of right now. I’m sorry.”
Tony frowned a little at the question, like he had never expected Steve to say those words. “The, the reason we broke up,” Tony said in quiet disbelief. Steve couldn’t blame him; he’d be shocked about forgetting the reason they broke up, too, if he’d ever heard a damn reason.
“And I’ll call in an order for breakfast burritos at Alacran,” Bruce agreed even as he pulled up the website for their number. “Dress him in anything but blue!” he reminded Tony before he was out the door.
Steve had been too busy scanning the salon for an available manicurist that he hadn’t noticed the black man standing behind the reception desk.
As the judge turned to ask whether those were acceptable terms, Natasha turned to confer with Mrs. Hansen. It didn’t take her long to make up her mind and reluctantly nod in agreement.
Steve had no idea what was going on or why Bucky was suddenly trying to be so cloak and dagger about the whole thing, but before he could ask, Tony took the phone back and told Steve his address.
Tony couldn’t identify those words or languages, and it didn’t seem like they understood him either. He’d known that the aliens harvested all around the Earth, and that the harvesters often specialized in different genders and cultures, but Tony hadn’t faced any evidence of it until this moment. Foolishly, he’d always assumed that if he had the chance, he’d be able to communicate and bond with other Terrans. It hadn’t occurred to him that they wouldn’t speak English.
“I still want you to come with me as my date to the New York premier,” Tony said over the phone, his voice lowered a little in case something more important was happening on Steve’s screen. “You don’t have to walk the carpet if it’s too much, but it would mean a lot to me if you were there.”
The morning after his mother’s midnight intervention was meant to be the end of their fledgling relationship. Steve had collected his rumpled, day-old uniform from every corner of Tony’s library, bedroom, and sauna, resisted what could have been their last kiss, and braved the walk of shame back to his designated guestroom. Neither of them had been happy about it, but Sarah’s words were too true. Steve could not turn his back on his people, and certainly not for something as fickle as love. For them, there was no room for love. Tony needed a queen to give him an heir, and for Steve, a queen was an important strategic opportunity. If he could find the right person, a partner who had a clear vision of the future their people deserved and the willingness to work and sacrifice for it, her support and their children would only solidify the leadership of their new democracy.
“Why did you get a Ford truck?” Steve asked in a careful tone—a tone that hopefully didn’t make his simmering anger too obvious. “I don’t want to drive a cheap truck.”
There was a moment of stunned silence, but Tony was quick to applaud and cheer for the winner, and the audience happily followed his lead.
“Love the enthusiasm,” Tony said sincerely once his heart stop racing, then turned to Bruce. “Bruce… can you do this for me? Help me out.”
“No can do, I’m on call until 007 is de-briefed by H tonight,” Tony said with a helpless little shrug. “Just in case shit hits the fan.”
“Hey, kids, you see the color of the giraffe’s tongue?” Tony asked, and the two kids who’d been momentarily distracted by ostriches quickly hurried back to gawk and giggle with the rest of his group. “Why do you think that is?”
“Longer than you were tall then,” Rhodey recalled, as matter-of-factly as he could after three whiskeys in his system. “But whatever, doesn’t matter: while Howard’s tying the rope around the biggest ranch hand they had, Tony grabs some rope and gets in the damn river. And I’m telling you, that animal was scared; thunder, lightning, water level was rising—”
Tony watched him with such easy contentment, as if Steve was everything on his mind in that shared heartbeat.
“You look like Cupid hit you with a semi-automatic,” Bucky drawled. “But I guess it can’t be that serious, right? Cause you haven’t introduced him to anybody yet. I know, because I get to meet him first. Official best friend duty, I vet the new boyfriend.”
“That was your role way before getting the call for Iron Man, wasn’t it?” Karl asked Tony, who was mostly occupied with getting in on the puppy love. “How long were you on that show?”
“With care and determination,” Steve guessed in a monotone, but Tony only laughed and smacked him playfully on the arm in return.
“We have a meeting with Hawley tonight. She wants to see you there early,” she told him. “Maria said you had second thoughts about Hansen.”
“Fine,” Tony finally decided, quietly at first, but more clearly as he gained momentum. “You want to get to know me, Steve? You want to learn how to communicate with me? Sure thing: let’s do it. We’ll go to Oklahoma, we’ll go to the ranch, and you can learn everything you’d ever want to know about me and who I am. Meet the family, meet the cows. Bumfuck Nowhere, Oklahoma.”
“If I’m not intruding,” Tony said, a small smile audible in his voice. “Yeah, I’d like that. Send me the address.”
All at once, Tony was bereft of Steve’s touch, his body gaping and incomplete with the aching loss. He felt himself skimming the surface of consciousness when he distantly recognized the blunt pressure taking the place of Steve’s fingers.
“Captain America has been coded and removed from his cell. They did not quantify status in his time, so while he believes he is an adult, I disagree. He will be in need of stewardship for the duration of his reinstatement,” Fury explained to them on the way. “His stewardship is assigned to you, Lieutenant Robert B. Banner.”
When Steve had told him about the demonstration as an educational presentation, Tony had drawn from his own experiences and anticipated an auditorium, or something akin to a lecture hall. But when they were taken to the event hall to meet the other masters and their human pets, it was set up like a feast in a banqueting hall. The orange lighting was gentle and warm, and all around the room tables were laden with food and drinks.
The answer was obvious, despite the festering voice of jealousy couldn’t help but point out how beautiful the landscape around them was. They turned off the highway mere minutes ago and already they had lost sight of civilization. Of all the reasons Benedita (or anyone else) might want to bring his handsome boyfriend out somewhere so secluded and unspeakably beautiful, how many would leave Tony happy?
“Steve? Hey, we’re worried about you, you haven’t been answering your phone for hours. Are you even listening to me?” she asked more irritably. “This is serious, Steve. Bucky’s out there with a baseball bat and a short temper looking for you. The Superbros are marching on Boston.”
is… it’s 2019, it should be unheard of. But what was that like for you when you heard the news? What was the reaction at home?”
Eventually, Tony had enough. Sitting in his hot tub and watching his phone was pointless. He climbed out of the jacuzzi, bundled against the winter chill in a thick bathrobe, and made his way to his suite. Water dripped in his wake, leaving a trail from his rooftop lounge, through the apartment, and into his closet. He had left Duckie sleeping in his bed in the morning when he left for his workshop. She had stayed with him for months on and off, but aside for the small collection of toiletries next to the second sink in his bathroom, there was no sign of her presence. He had not invited her to more, and she had not asked for a drawer or space to hang up her clothes. They both liked it that way.
Of course he had. Of course Ty hadn’t been able to just ruin him without digging the blade into Steve as well. Steve, who Obie had threatened. Steve, who Tony would go right back to Ty to protect without hesitation.
is maybe the wrong word. But it certainly malfunctions.  A lot. Water sprays everywhere, the majority of it hitting Hammer and his friends in the face.
Tony smirks, throwing it at him before sitting down on the bed. “It looks it. Pretty sure Rhodey has the same one.”
He smirks, taking a seat at one of his bar stools. His father and Obie view him as a playboy, he knows that much. So let them.
Steve looks away, pulling a face at Natasha. She smiles slightly. Then his brain processes the image.
And now Tony just feels distinctly uncomfortable, because maybe he hasn’t expressed it in class, but that's only because he doesn’t pay attention. Everything just bores him so much and-
“Yeah, Obie is my... uncle, I guess you could say. Not biologically, but he’s my father’s best friend, and he treats me like a nephew. He wasn’t happy about having to explain to a board of directors why fifteen year old me looked like I had crawled out of hell.”
A click, and the other person hangs up. When he puts his phone away, Obadiah's eyebrows are raised. Tony shakes his head with a wave of dismissal.
Rhodey would tell him to go to the hospital, but that would mean more questions, more lies, more effort. His ribs are still aching. They’re not broken, he knows what that feels like, because sometimes Howard hits harder than he just had. Once, his father joked that he's become less breakable over time.
He doesn’t think Tony is breathing next to him, and Steve is shaking a bit, trembling with anger and something a little like fear, but not for himself. Obadiah reaches out, touching one of the bruises on his face, pressing down on the skin. Hard. Steve inhales sharply, swallowing the urge to flinch away from his touch.
“Hi.” He keeps his voice steady, fingers tapping out a beat on his thigh. He hasn’t spoken to Steve for two days, has wanted to a million times, but hasn’t. Because Steve is undoubtedly angry, and Tony… he can give him the space. He
Steve stirs, rolling over and opening his eyes, and Tony mutters a curse in Italian, going still, caught halfway to the door.
Tony stands up suddenly, shoving back his chair. Too loud. He just… he needs to breathe, needing to get out. It’s too much. Obie, Howard, Ty, Steve. It’s mixing in his head, he doesn’t know who he’s angry with anymore.
wants to grab Tony’s hand and spend a couple of hours in his very comfortable bed. Besides… Clint doesn’t really
The waitress is nice. Obadiah tips her for the drinks with a look that lingers far too long, and Tony looks away, resisting the urge to tap out a rhythm on the table.
“But I didn’t.” Steve cuts across him, trying to keep his voice steady “I didn’t because you saved me.”
The bell chimes; signalling that someone has walked into the cafe, and Tony’s mouth snaps shut. It could be anyone, but the dread building, and the smell of expensive cologne says otherwise.
“I got bored of the tour, so I just wandered over here.” Tony says. And then for good measure, just because he really doesn’t want to tell his mom he’s had another detention, he makes a vaguely apologetic face. “Sorry.”
Coming for the first time after everything… it had been terrifying. He hadn't known if he’d wanted him back in his life, back in his heart. But then he’d realised that Steve Rogers had never really left his goddamn heart, and he hated him for it for so long.
Rhodey shrugs. “I usually would be against blackmail, seeing as it’s illegal and all of that. But if anyone deserves to have his life utterly ruined, it’s Obadiah Stane.”
He hadn’t thought he’d ever be one for physical contact, not after everything. But here they are, and Tony is more relaxed than he’s been in a long while.
He can’t explain it, how can he? How can he explain that Obie finding out isn’t only bad, but dangerous, for Tony
Steve shakes his head, meeting his eyes. “No. Nat doesn’t think so. I don’t think so. You had-” Steve looks like how Tony feels: sick, exhausted. “You still had all your clothes on.”
“That’s what it says here.” Rhodey agrees, taking a closer look at the english description of it. “It’s actually really cool-”
It had taken Tony an hour to warm up after the shocking cold of the rain had finally hit him. The shower had most definitely helped, especially when Steve had knocked on the door gently to see if he was okay, and Tony hadn’t even hesitated before taking his hand and tugging him into the bathroom.
And somehow, no matter how hard Tony tries to shove down that feeling, it keeps creeping it’s way back in.
Tony kicks Peter under the table, hard, and the teen shuts up, not before flashing another one of his shit eating grins.
Steve bites back the retort he so desperately wants to give, knowing that it won’t help in the slightest. He had been discharged from the hospital earlier in the morning, and Tony had been fussing over him since. It’s endearing, but also a pain in the ass.
Howard looks down at him, and there’s nothing but contempt in his gaze. He spits on the carpet, and Tony closes his eyes. He just wants
Steve just gives his friend a look that he thinks really gets across how unimpressed he is, despite the fact that he’s laughing. Nat (unsurprisingly) breaks first.
“How are you feeling?” Tony says, touching his face lightly. His touch is gentle, so much more gentle than Obadiah’s, and Steve feels an overwhelming urge to close his eyes and sleep for a year.
So he just shakes his head, pulling away with a smile that he knows Steve doesn’t believe. When he lets his hands drop, something in Tony aches for the warmth to return. It’s fine. He can get coffee on the way to work. It’s
Hands on his waist now, sliding under his shirt. Dizzy. His head hurts. Lips pressing against his, moving down to his neck, and it’s too bright, too much. He thinks he flinches away, he doesn’t know. The hands hold fast, pinning him in place.
“I figured out, over the last two years,” Tony whispers against his lips, because he feels brave now, and he feels light and happy. It's cold, but Steve is warm. “That it’s a hell of a lot easier to love you than to hate you.”
like a child. But really, isn’t that what he is, even though he’s technically an adult now? A child who lost his mother, a child who’s never getting her back.
here,” says Rhodey quietly, and even though Tony knows he would never say anything to Obadiah’s face, the look in his eyes says enough.
He knows Obie only waited until he’d started talking to his mother to be able to say that in front of Howard. As if conjured up by his thoughts, his father follows Obadiah through the door. He doesn’t smile, doesn’t do anything other than look him up and down. It’s judgemental, nothing else.
“I just thought it would be nice,” he finishes, flashing his trademark smile. “I like to take cute baristas out for dinner.” Let Steve infer what he will from that. If the look on his face is anything to go by, the words had their intended effect.
Ty shrugs, eyes glittering with humour. He has a bedroom smile. Tony hates it, hates that he used to like it before he knew the monster behind it.
“Why?” He asks later, because Pepper is his best friend aside from Rhodey, but she also thinks coffee is the equivalent of drinking weed killer.
“Figures.” Peter sighs, narrowing his eyes as he drops the wire. “Shouldn’t you be getting to that meeting?”
, whether you like it or not, however many times you hide behind different masks and names and identities. You retain the same level of IQ, even if you’re a little too good at pretending otherwise.”
He’s just picked up his phone to call Happy when he hears a key turn in the lock. For a second, hope jumps in his chest at the thought that it could be Steve, Steve could have come round and-
about the accords, couldn't care less about the agreement anymore. Steve had looked him in the face and lied.
God, Tony. And he had no idea, no idea about any of it because Tony is too good at hiding, too good at keeping secrets.
A part of him wonders if it would be better to just say fuck it, fuck Obadiah, fuck Howard and fuck the company. But then he remembers staying with his parents in the summer, and any lingering courage wilts and dies.
“Not what I meant.” He says with a half smile, bringing Steve’s hand up to his mouth pressing a kiss to his fingers. “I’m just not used to all of this.”
Rhodey laughs, rolling his eyes. “Of course you did. Your attention span is worse than mine man. Why did you come over here?”
Tony leans into his touch, and Steve feels him relax, the emptiness in his eyes fading into something more like the person he knows.
Tony opens his mouth to say something else, but then his phone rings. Steve doesn’t miss how the smile vanishes instantly, but it’s none of his business, so he doesn’t say anything. He hands him the coffee, and Tony winks once before turning away, already talking to whoever’s on the other side of the call.
“Nothing broken, just a lot of bruises, and a few stitches.” Tony says quietly, as if he can read Steve’s mind. Tony has always been able to do that, always been able to read him like an open book.
“I can and I will. You work outside the law, so I work outside the law. Difference is, I’m a lot better at getting what I want than you are, and you’ve managed to piss me off. Now Steve here is usually the one who counsels mercy, but thanks to you, he's not feeling particularly talkative today, and I'm not feeling very forgiving. That will be all."
Steve turns as someone steps out of the group. He’s tall, clean-shaven, with a dark patch over one eye. His smile is terrifying. Tony matches it with one of his own.
His voice is quiet, sleepy, and Tony gets the unfamiliar urge to get right back into bed with him and stay there all day.
Pepper nods, going over to a counter and pouring herself a glass of whiskey that probably cost more than what Steve earns in a year. “Yeah. It’s not pretty. But obviously, it’s better if you have all the facts before making a case against him.” Her voice trembles a little as she speaks, and Steve realises she’s not as unaffected as she’s pretending to be.
His voice has shifted into something else. Stark Industries Tony is like a different person, and it's someone he knows nothing about. Steve watches him and sees his face change in half a second as the other person on the phone speaks. There’s silence for a minute, and then Tony starts to talk, his voice tense.
(He’s really going to regret thinking that later, but Rhodey has always said he has a knack for jinxing things.)
