“Hm… your psychiatrist is wrong you know. Your hand is entirely still, and you are exceedingly loyal to someone you only just met. She’s wrong about your hand. You’re not broken from the war… you
“Yes, hello John. Mild brain trauma? Perfect. And you won’t even remember if I’m less than cordial to you. Absolutely ideal.” The man clasped his hands together. “And no sense of smell! Why, it’s Christmas! Mike, leave. Importance is about to be achieved.” He spun around from his lab table. “So John, Persephone or Ophreides?” What a stunning deep voice.
“Oh god, yes,” John exhaled excitedly. He missed the adrenaline rush of the battlefield. “Wait, hold on. I’m only wearing pants!”
Sherlock looked around and spotted him.
But damn it all, did that punk have to pull the alarm in the middle of the night? It was bad enough John’s sleep was ripe with nightmares, but to top it all off with a midnight exposé?
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
“I’d say ‘Please God, let me live.’” John said quietly. Sherlock stared at him.
When he got outside, he found a small crowd of residents in their pajamas staring at the building and gossiping to each other.
“When do you leave?” his mum had asked him. He’d always been closer to her, confiding in her first before making any decisions, and she had known well in advance of his future. His mum claimed to never have been Gifted, though personally John thought that was a lie. It was impossible to be so caring and tolerant without a Gift.
John grinned. “You’re a proper genius, aren’t you.” He took a step towards Sherlock, as Sherlock stood up. “Would you mind terribly, if I…”
“So… crime scene. What is it that you do? I get that you’re brilliant… so what, you help the police? I’d call you a detective, but you don’t seem to have a title and you seem rather solitary.” John paused. “But the police don’t consult amateurs. So what are you?”
Out of curiosity, he went back even further. He wanted to find the moment it began.
It was then that he realized there was not one part of John that he wasn’t attracted to. For the first time in his life, Sherlock was absolutely enraptured by another person. It should scare him, he should be afraid. It would be easy if he was afraid, disgusted by himself, even angry that he’d let it happen. If he felt any of those things, he could fight it. He could put distance between them until he found a way to undo those unfamiliar emotions. He could undo it all until he only saw John as his friend again. He could fix everything. But that was utterly impossible because he was happy. He had neither qualm nor doubt.
“So this is love.”
“Don’t play innocent, either.”
Sherlock’s eyes shot up to meet John, wide with shock. His cheeks had become scarlet. His throat closed on nothing in his panic, causing him to be begin to cough, choking on air. “What?!” He wheezed out the word between coughs.
“I have romantic feelings for you as well. I realized it the night you started humming again.”
Somehow, even their short walk ended up being filled with music. A small store was playing some shitty pop song that John was familiar with. Sherlock walked a bit slower so he could focus on John's humming. Although he pushed it back, it made him want to smile to hear John's humming once again. Much to Sherlock's delight, the humming turned to singing.
A bit of urgency filled Molly’s tone. “Is everything alright?”
Sherlock's smile forced its way onto his face and he watched John bop along to the song while they could still hear it. John noticed the smile, but he didn't say anything. He didn't want to ruin it. He was a bit prideful to know that he was the reason Sherlock was smiling. He hummed the rest of the song on their walk to Angelo's.
Sherlock noticed the tremble and swelled with pride. John was getting close. He watched how frantic and desperate his boyfriend had become and he knew it was all because of him. He bobbed his head and worked his tongue, licking across John’s skin as he sucked away.
Sherlock huffed. “Something more, you know this! If it was only friendly I wouldn’t’ve called. You’re intelligent, Molly, be more confident in your deductions.” His tone was borderline scolding.
“You realize that you are beautiful, right?” John’s tone changed to something that was actually quite charming, but Sherlock recognized that he had done it on purpose.
Sherlock squirmed and arched his back as he felt what John was doing. Though he was far too preoccupied to think, he could tell what John wanted to do. “Deeper John, I can take it.”
“Yea. Three months sober.” He commented. “I’m really proud of her.”
“He isn’t. Tad overweight.”
Sherlock didn’t care and hummed away as he suckled at John’s length, managing to get it even deeper inside of himself.
“This won’t be the only time I keep you in bed for most of the day. I’ll order takeaway.” He offered as he put the cuffs away and sat by John.
He groaned and shifted from where he laid. He pushed his hips back and felt his inner thighs occasionally shake. He bit his lip and shivered in the wake of a second finger, waiting to enter him. "Don't act like it doesn't turn you on. You want me to do it. You want to be helpless." His voice was even lower than normal and flooded with the pleasure he felt.
John nodded, ending the conversation there. He wasn't sure why, but he found himself smiling at this newfound knowledge. That confused him a bit. Why was he happy that Sherlock liked men?
“Then it’s settled. We’ll be together forever.”
John felt like he’d been hit with cold water. He was frozen and covered in goosebumps. But he was happy. He was so happy. “You love me?”
“How can you be so sure?” John was suddenly aware that his head was only to Sherlock’s chest.
“Not if you’re preoccupied with m-“
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Never would have pegged you as a masochist.”
John leaned in and watched the pink of Sherlock’s cheekbones get a bit darker as he closed in. Gorgeous. He placed a few soft kisses over the area and felt a shiver run through the body in his arms. He cracked a smile and held him tighter to keep him steady. He started below Sherlock’s ear and slowly kissed down. As he made his way back up, his lips parted, letting his tongue peak out to trace the flesh before he pulled away with a soft suck, moving to plant another kiss above the last. He trailed his kisses all across Sherlock’s neck, intending to become acquainted with every inch of skin.
Even after John stopped singing, Sherlock was silently begging for more. Just one more verse, one more chorus, encore. He needed more. He was wrapped around John's finger and he knew it. Once John's haunting voice stopped echoing off the walls, Sherlock felt like he could breathe again. He took a moment to open his eyes. He didn't want to, but he had to. He took a deep breath and leaned back in his seat. He let his brain slowly awakened and his mind started to reel.
“Well. You see, I’ve come to realize that .....” He trailed off. He had no idea how he was suppose to tell John how he felt. It was as if there was a rock in his chest, weighting him down and making it hard to breathe. He took a deep breath, trying to fill his lungs. “I’ve come to realize that in my line of work, being in a relationship would be the most foolish thing I could want. Few can keep up with me to begin with, even fewer would be interested in me, and almost no one would put their life on the line just for a relationship me. To find someone capable of all that would be nearly impossible.” He had absolutely no idea where he was going with this. He’d just begun talking and didn’t stop. He was rambling, he never rambled. He couldn’t believe he was so stupid. His brain wasn’t working and he had no idea how to improvise. “I don’t know what I’m talking about. What am I doing?” He realized that he hadn’t even answered the question that John asked, the question that he had intentionally prompted within the man.
“Well, I mean, he wasn’t a very nice person.” John smiled.
“You know, I’ve got a phone,” John frowned. This man was so dramatic. Bit like Sherlock, to be honest. “I mean, very clever and all that, but you could just phone me. On my phone.” There. That was mundane enough.
“A text please, will you write, ‘Lauriston Gardens, was there a fight? I think I must have blacked out last night.’ Reword it please, if you might.” Sherlock stared at the ceiling, his hands returned into a prayer position under his chin.
John took the shot.
“Oh-”
Walking along the main road, a phone rang beside him. Strange. He didn’t know payphones
the cab stopped and Sherlock got out. John was about to get out too, until Sherlock spun around and leaned down, resulting in their noses getting knocked together.
Of course he chose the wrong building.
“Yes.”
the arse that caused this whole thing?” Jesus, could he not catch a break? Did the attractive man (barely wearing any clothes-
“No.”
“That’s brilliant!” John gushed.
“Yeah sure, and while you’re at it could you tell me again how to take off a bandage?” John asked jokingly. Alex laughed and poked him in his side. “Oh, fuck off, Al.”
John nodded, and followed the sergeant out to the medical area. “Any special cases I should know about?” You never knew if you had to take into account that your patient could grow wings at a moment’s notice (which had actually happened to him one time, which is why he always asked that question now).
God, John really hated his flat. It wasn’t enough that it smelled like rotten plaster, no. There was this stupid little punk on the floor below him that wouldn’t stop pulling the damn fire alarm.
John looked at the door, thinking briefly of his bedsit and the fact he could be in absolute silence and darkness and horizontal. What a blessing that would be.
“Another case cracked,” Mycroft interrupted suddenly. John sobered, straightening his spine. “How very public spirited of you, brother. Though that’s never been your motivation, has it?” he looked pointedly at John.
“Yeah. It was a bit of a mess.” He leaned against the wall and looked at Sherlock. “So… do you have a partner?”
Sherlock?
“Rachel is the name she tried to write; look at her nails, it was a fight. She was in heavy rain two to three hours ago, more data in her suitcase, until then, I don’t know.”
Sherlock, luckily, didn’t even have to use his vocal chords to communicate. He caught his breath whilst thinking,
When he was younger, he’d always rescue injured animals (he’d been especially fond of saving turtles) and he seemed to have a knack for knowing what was wrong. It was never miraculous, but he put a lot of time and effort into helping animals and so it always seemed like he had a Gift. Of course, it must have been a low level Gift, but he was thankful all the same. He never showed off at school (it wasn’t like there was a lot to show off anyway) and was always kind of the wallflower as a couple of his classmates turned into bats or showed off their X-Ray vision. His sister, Harry, liked to show off too. She had been normal for most of her younger years, until suddenly she got their dad’s Gift of woodworking. She’d build something new every day to show off in class, producing miraculous pieces of art.
The stranger raised his eyes from his phone,
“Anyway, what do you want from me this time?”
Alex woke up slowly, smiling sheepishly at John. “Sorry for falling asleep on you there, mate. I’ve been working double with you lying in bed all day.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow on his otherwise passive face. “John. I know that our last encounter wasn’t… perhaps, a preferred one, but I must say the hostility is uncalled for.”
He heard the killer’s thoughts, and the welcoming flood of Sherlock overwhelming John momentarily.
“Ha, no, I mean I don’t have a brother. My sister’s name is Harry. Short for Harriet.”
Well it was certainly convenient that he had his gun in the waist band of his jeans. He opened the door, noting that his hand wasn’t trembling at all. Inside the car was, well, a rather attractive lady typing on her smart phone.
“Right… ah, yes. Okay. Um. Any idea where I could get a cab? It’s just, ah, my leg…” he trailed off.
“Persephone… but how did you…?” John turned to Mike. “Did you tell him?”
“John Watson?” the receptionist called from the front. He nodded to her and got up slowly, trying to keep his center of gravity from freaking out too much. He was dizzy enough as is, what with getting used to gravity again and the brain injury.
“Watson, you’re needed,” a gruff voice called him from his sleep. John woke up quickly, putting on his medic’s uniform with not a shred of embarrassment. “A couple miles from here a squad was gassed, not sure what it was, seems hallucinogenic… the chopper should be here in ten minutes.”
“How’s he now?”
Sherlock tried to hide his smile behind a frown. “How did you meet him?”
“Now, there’s two spaceships available, you two.” she said, leading them through the bay. “Both up to spec for the lab equipment. Will you be needing one bedroom or two?” She winked at John.
“Yeah, that’s Sherlock,” Mike held back his laughter.
Sherlock looked over to check that John was serious. “You think so?”
“I know you’re a Terran Corps medic and you’ve been invalided home from the war in the Persephone region. You suffer from some mild brain trauma, not enough to stop you from working, but enough for you to be consistently annoyed at your limitations. You’re accustomed to space travel, obviously, and you thrive there. You have higher than average bone density and you have a brother that you’re not close to. Possibly because of some event when you were younger, but you feel a sense of obligation to keep in touch with him, despite not taking him up on his offer of living with him. And I know your therapist thinks your depression a side effect of the brain trauma, which potentially it is, but more likely is due to circumstances and your lack of future. I won’t even get into the persistent hand tremor. That’s enough to be going on, don’t you think?”
“So what’s the deal with your speech pattern? Is it like a Gift or something? That’s what Mike was saying…” John trailed off.
“Oh, shut up, you berk.”
“Well, there’s fermenting Klon corpses in those bins right by you, which are rather putrid to the average nose. But what I’m more interested in is your medical knowledge of the Klon people, and, of course your experience in spaceships.” The man eyed him surreptitiously, and John straightened up and couldn’t help but puff his chest out a bit.
“Anything you want, anything on the menu, free,” the owner said with a clap on the back.
Silence pervaded the taxi cab again. John looked out of the window and casually placed his hand on the middle seat, as a peace offering. Sherlock’s hand soon joined his, accidentally-on-purpose touching.
Sherlock snorted. “Indeed.”
“Well. You’re my work partner for the duration of this experiment.” Sherlock met his gaze evenly.
Mike clenched his teeth and smiled. “Er, this is John Watson…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you solve crimes, too! You’re like a superhero!”
John pursed his lips. “A skull? Am... Did you just say I’m replacing a skull?”
Sherlock seemed caught off-guard, exactly as John had wanted. He was about to speak when John interrupted.
As the ship door closed off Mrs. Hudson from them, John sighed happily at the sight of the inside of a spaceship. “Yeah, this’ll do quite nicely once the other shipping containers and documents are cleaned out from here.”
“It’s me, mate. Mike Stamford! We went to school together, remember?”
John rolled his eyes. “You could say that, I suppose. I prefer calling it a hostage situation with the Klon where you offered to use me as fertilizer but I suppose you could call it an unpreferable encounter.”
John scoffed. “Oh, you bastard. You know, I’m pretty easy to reach. I’ve got a website and a contact chip and geo-tracking enabled, it’s really not hard to find me. That being said, why on earth did you want to reach me, Mycroft?”
“Beds ready?”
And their lips met, and it was like fireworks and pure joy and their mouths tasted like mint and their tongues battled for dominance. And John could swear that Sherlock smelled like the sweetest thing in the world and like sandalwood and spices. At least, that was what John would later write in his blog, despite him clearly not having a sense of smell, as previously acknowledged.
They sat in amicable silence in the taxi, John eyeing Sherlock every now and then, wondering if this was all a dream. It was quite a strange and unexpected dream if it was.
“Quite, and that’s what’s important, isn’t it dear?” she said almost to herself, walking away.
He took out his gun, praying he wouldn’t have to use it.
Sherlock and John looked at each other for a minute, then John cracked a grin. The two burst out giggling.
“Amazing,” John said, still in awe.
“Mm, yes, well, you needed to get a new flat anyway, right? In fact I have the perfect one in mind, it’s on 221B Baker Street, lovely old landlady who owes me a favour… are you interested?” God, the man wasn’t even looking at him. Those otherworldly blue eyes had travelled down to the damn phone again.
enemy.”
Sherlock blushed. “I wouldn’t really…”
John frowned in concentration to focus on Sherlock’s inner monologue. It got louder, the harder he tried. Finally, he could hear it clearly, and burst out laughing. “Are you reciting the different types of tobacco ash?”
“One-”
Mike shrugged. “Cryptic? Yeah… must be some sort of Gift gone wrong, I reckon. Gets bloody annoying quickly. Still, he wouldn’t be horrible as a flatmate.”
John looked at her, reading her name tag and giving her a charming smile. “I’m sorry Mary, I’ll have to raincheck the interview. But here’s my contact chip, in case the dean, or anybody I suppose, wants to get in touch.” He looked concerned. “Once again, I’m terribly sorry. This must be a bother for you, I could try and make it up to you later, at dinner, if you’d like.”
people, and I can’t…”
Anderson came up the stair as Sherlock whipped out his pocket magnifier. Of course he’d have one.
“Hello, Sherlock,” John smiled and turned around.
“And a bloody awful cabbie.” They giggled quietly together. “We shouldn’t be giggling like school girls at a crime scene,” John pointed out.
She gaped at him. “Why you--”
“Oh piss off. Who are you?”
Mary smirked at him. “Alright hot shot, maybe.”
“John Watson?”
“Oh?”
“Soon as you can stand, really.” Alex grinned. “The stitches should come out by next week, but really you’re fine. It was just the fact that you were knocked out for so long that gets me concerned.”
“Be careful, alright?” Lestrade called out as John left the flat. Lestrade followed him down the stairs for a moment. “I hope you know, John, that I have a Gift for sensing liars. Just don’t get hurt.”
So it was here he found himself, at the fourth medical center that day. The first two had been for himself, to check up on his brain injury, but the next two were to see if he could find some sort of job. His brain injury had caused a few minor symptoms, but certainly enough to stop the Earth Corps from letting him continue.
“Get in the car, Doctor Watson.”
John snorted. “Alright, you, come on, we’d better hurry.”
psychopath we know, the killer has the case. Need I say more?” Anderson looked pointedly at Sherlock.
“Oh. Yes, well,” Sherlock smiled softly, and turned back in his seat. “That’s not what most people say.”
“Piss off.”
Sherlock frowned and opened the door, climbing the stairs in a huff. John shook his head and laughed, hearing Sherlock’s inner frustration clearly.
Sherlock’s small smile dropped. “So I’ve been told.”
“Yes, and since you’ve met him you’ve moved in with him and now you’re solving crimes together. Might we be expecting a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
“I won’t tell you anything about Sherlock.” John turned away and left. His phone pinged.
“Interested in Sherlock? Why? I doubt you’re his friend. I don’t think he has many.”
John heard the thoughts of the person in the shack. Unfortunately, he wasn’t proficient in languages, and his Pashto was rudimentary at best. He couldn’t tell what the potential enemy was thinking.
John raised an eyebrow. “Um, so you don’t have a boyfriend, then, either? Which is fine, by the way.”
“I would make some sort of threat, but I’m sure your situation is clear to you.” A black car pulled up beside him.
Now, usually John wasn’t even home when the alarm was pulled; after getting off duty John had a penchant for meandering around London. He observed the life around him, watched as children laughed and parents muttered to each other and lover’s kissed. It was strange though, he felt almost dissociated from it all, like he wasn’t even human. Everything just seemed unimportant when there were people out there dying in a desert that he couldn’t save.
Sherlock truly smiled at John. “You have no idea.” They were leaning in to each other, quite closely now, having inched forwards gradually throughout the conversation. John blushed and looked down.
“Right,” Lestrade looked away.
John raised his eyebrows. “You’re just showing off now, aren’t you? Bit wrong, though. Yeah, Harry and I don’t get along, and Harry’s an alcoholic… but she’s my sister. Not my brother.”
John smiled and patted the old lady’s arm. “I’m afraid not, it’s okay though, at least we’re safe.”
“No, it’s just--”
No, he couldn’t do this anymore. He wouldn’t be signing on to another tour. This would be the last.
“So John, I suppose Mike’s told you all about my work, but you probably didn’t quite get it all. In fact, Mike barely knows anything, but everyone’s an idiot so that’s not news.” The man said, still inspecting whatever was in the metal box. He looked over to John with cold grey eyes, and blushed maybe, but it was hard to tell in the dim lighting.
“What’s the damage?” he asked calmly.
Ella said it was caused by memories from his injury from the vampire Gifted hybrid, but he knew the cause. The boy. The boy whom he’d led his team to kill. He’d thought that the boy had shot his leg but it had been Erikkson who had tackled him so he wouldn’t get hurt. He knew he wasn’t hurt now, of course, but apparently his leg didn’t know that.
“Oh, sorry, wasn’t looking where I was going,” he said apologetically, not even looking up. God damn it, he just wanted to get out of this herd. His limp was finally making itself noticed, to boot.
Oh. That was unsettling. Then again, Anthea had known his name too.
So there was actually a fire this time? Fuck.
They headed out of 221B, bright smiles on their faces. Sherlock hailed a cab with ridiculous ease (it usually took John a good five minutes before cab drivers would notice him… damn his slightly-below-average height). They spent a good portion of the cab ride in silence, Sherlock, thinking about the case, and John, attempting to ignore the cab driver and Sherlock’s thoughts. Once again, though, Sherlock’s thoughts seemed to fill the cab, almost muting the cab driver. John was surprised not to have noticed this sooner… in retrospect Sherlock had muted Mike’s thoughts as well.
Sherlock held out his hand and gestured towards the phone wordlessly.
And with that, he was off to sandy deserts.
“Yeah, but you’re a bloody idiot who was going to take the pill. Don’t lie to me, I heard what you were thinking,” John argued, crossing his arms. God, what did he get himself into? Why would Sherlock do that? It was for his own enjoyment… God, no wonder the man had been a junkie in the past.
“Rache,” Anderson said gutturally, over John’s shoulder. “Means ‘revenge’ in German. Her last word to ever write down. We’re thinking it’s a clue to who the murderer is.” He nodded sagely. The whole ‘smart’ look he was going for was definitely hampered by the bright blue plastic suit he had to wear to protect the crime scene.
It was windy today, which never boded well. Sand in the eye really lowered your accuracy, which was vital for survival. Nodding to Erikkson, John tore down the door of the shack, his gun raised pre-emptively. He blinked at a stray grain of sand and found himself lying on the ground.
“Mmm, this is gonna bug me if I don’t do it now,” John said.
Sherlock looked affronted, like John had made some serious faux-pas. “John don’t be an idiot, can’t you see, this situation works well for you and me.” Sherlock winced. “This allows me not to rhyme, as you can translate and we’ll save time.”
The man gestured to a chair in front of him. “Have a seat, John.”
“We can’t giggle here! It’ll make us look suspicious, giggling while our flats are burning down!” John hissed through peals of laughter.
“Mate, I don’t think I can do this anymore,” he confessed one day to Alex. It had come out of the blue; normally he kept things easy and cheery between himself and the other med workers. Having happy people around him made ignoring them easier. But honestly, this job was so disheartening. Sure, he saved a couple lives but then he went out and killed people. God save the bloody Queen.
bring your gun.”
Sherlock stood, towering over John. A faint smell of gunpowder, ashes and adventure encompassed them as they met in the middle, noses bumping into each other.
alone. It was crowded enough before at night, hearing soldiers wanking next door or screaming in their sleep. Now he
John had to strain his Gift to hear Lestrade; Sherlock’s inner monologue was deafening. He ignored it as best as he could.
“Sherlock, dear, the cabbie’s waiting….” Mrs. Hudson fretted.
John tried not to laugh at her internal commentary, and acted as normal as possible, given the situation. “Hello,” he smiled.
“The desert doctor was hurt before, and continued to be shot once more. The uninjured leg curiously remains sore, and in his head he’s still at war,” he rattled off his deductions, making uncomfortable eye contact with John.
He had left his resume with a couple nearby clinics… not nearly as exciting as his time in the medical area in Afghanistan, but what could he say, he was broke. And he didn’t want to end up living with Harry… it hurt him enough to talk to her on the phone. He knew Watsons tended towards addiction, and he doubted he could live with Harry’s alcoholism, what with his newfound telepathy.
"No, I have simply planned ahead.  Now, since it seems you are just going to lie there..." He moved around the room, but I could determine nothing from what I heard.  He came back to my side, and his hand brushed low across my stomach, below the navel.
It is amazing what one can do when a person you wish to impress is watching.  I strolled casually across the room, and even grasped his shoulder, but only to turn his back towards me.  Then I took the leather leash from its bag and snapped the clip end to his collar.
"Little man."  He seemed amused.  "Do you think you can play with drugs that open your mind, and expect that there will be no consequences?  Normally I cannot reach you, but now you have reached out to me.  This is my realm."
"Well, Watson, your ten minutes is paid and now you may do as you choose."
"No, that was not too hard."
Part 1 - Watson.
"Holmes?"
a) A gentlemen’s club
Holmes hissed audibly through his teeth, but made no other movement.  I would have liked to have seen his face, but he had expressly asked for the view of my back, so I remained as I was.  I did not hear him step forward, but suddenly his hands were on me.
Holmes waited, silent and mostly hidden in the shadows beyond the fireplace.  For once I was glad he had the gift of knowing when someone was not quite finished with what they had to say.  I collected myself and forced out the rest of the truth.
"Do you ever touch your nipples?"
Mycroft was also very big because of trouble with his diets and so his brother had to move out and share a croft with somebody else, so he was called Share-croft. Sharing a house meant his stuff got stolen a lot, so he invented locks no one else could open and changed his name to Sharelock. Later he was even poorer and had to give up one of the letters in his name, and changed it to Sherlock, and so the two brothers were known as Mycroft and Sherlock after their homes, thus Mycroft Homes and Sherlock Homes.
Sherlock and John looked at each other, and then back at the two women.  "No."
"I thought it would take more than a couple of strokes to dismay you!  Hold still for the last two, and I will give you what you want.  Now hold!"  The crop landed again, and I trembled at the effort of keeping my position.  Holmes was wrapped solely in his gown, fallen slightly askew with his exertions.  I knew that with the slightest movement my tongue or my lips could touch his bare skin.  Only the desire to obey held me still.
with you. There’s a difference.”
“John!” She sounded excited. “Oh, how have you been? You hardly ever text me, let alone call! I ought to kick your arse for that!”
He didn't realize it at first, but he found himself humming How Will I Know by Whitney Houston. He let a smile creep onto his face as he hummed the song, finding it fit his mood perfectly.
“Of course! Everything about you is very delightful and homey. I know this doesn’t make much sense, but, you look like home.” He didn’t know how to put his feelings into words, but he did the best that he could.
John groaned and took a moment to try to assess the situation. He tugged at his hands again and found they weren’t going anywhere from their place, crossed over his head. That sent an unfamiliar wave of arousal through him. He loved that he couldn’t do anything about what was happening. He also realized that he was already a little over halfway there.
Sherlock flushed at the unfamiliar complement. He wasn’t used to his appearance being praised. He squirmed at the kisses that vaguely tickled and felt John’s hands travel to his waist, pulling his trousers off and revealing the strain.
The statement emboldened Sherlock to do even more. He pulled away once more and replaced his mouth with his hand. “Have you ever heard of your perineum?”
“Of course I am.” The taller man said before pulling John back in for another kiss.
Moans and whimpers were forgotten as deep wails and long cries for pleasure exhausted Sherlock’s normally quiet voice. The sounds made John throb as he realized just how hard he really was.
“Irene Adler? Yea, hard to forget.” He could tell this was actually a series of questions that would then lead to a full conversation, so he took a seat across from Sherlock.
Only two things were occurring that could trigger such a response from John; their conversation about whether or not John was seeing someone, or John reading the newspaper. He aimed to examine both possibilities.
Sherlock looked up from where he had been sitting. He spent the last half hour trying to figure out if this was a date or not. When he looked up and saw John's outfit, there was no doubt in his mind that this must be a date.
Mike, the man who had introduced the pair. "Of course."
Sherlock's hands gripped the sheets and he wailed. His hips rolled back to grind onto John's fingers. His mind went blank and all he could do was cry and try to get more. The fingers were slow, but pressed down hard, giving a deep massage. He was nearly sobbing from how good it felt.
He recognized the footsteps that came upstairs and immediately stood up to greet John.
“Perfect. We can have dinner together.”
“Yea? Well you howl. Like a dog.” John’s own voice was weak from how loud he’d been. “I can’t believe you just made me a bottom.” He sat up after he was finally uncuffed from the bed.
“Marques de Caceres.”
Sherlock was a very logical and reasonable man. He was very aware that he wasn’t conventionally attractive, but he knew how to use charisma to charm people in cases where it would be beneficial. He also knew that John
“I’m wearing jeans and a t-shirt.”
"Sherlock." John warned as he slipped his finger out and then pressed two fingertips just inside of him, teasing his rim.
John looked up at him with eyes that were filled with some emotion. “I-I look li-” he cut himself off and a grin broke out onto his face. He felt an indescribable joy. “That’s the sweetest thing anyone’s ever said to me. Thank you, Sherlock.”
They then shared the excitement of Sherlock having potentially found love. They both thought he deserved it.
"He and I messed around a bit in uni. Don't tell him I told you that, he's a bit embarrassed by it."
“Right then, that was easy.” He leaned forward with a devilish smirk. “Gives me plenty to work with.” With a wink at the end, John made those gorgeous cheekbones of Sherlock’s burn red, and a grin spread across John's face. “Told you, I’m in charge.”
“Perhaps you don’t, but we do know someone who might.” She suggested.
John shrugged. “I do have some manners. Especially for my boyfriend.”
“No, John. You’re dressed up, not overdressed. You’re wearing an outfit that you know looks particularly attractive on you though it isn’t part of your normal wear. You intentionally chose this outfit, why?”
Sherlock and Mycroft discussed a few family matters before he left, and after Sherlock walked him to the door, he quietly said, “Really, be good to him. John loves you more than anyone else ever will.”
Sherlock audibly gasped. “Lestrade!” John’s second best friend and drinking buddy. If he was to confess his feelings for Sherlock to anyone, it would be Lestrade. “Molly, you’re an absolute genius!”
John shrugged. “I can’t tell.”
“Obviously, but I’ve never seen you blush before.”
Sherlock’s lips parted in shock and his face went an even darker red than before. “Y-You would do that?”
“You’re worth anything.” Sherlock said softly as he watched John lube his fingers and warm it up a bit in his hand.
Sherlock let out a shout and froze a moment, trembling as he was overwhelmed from the front and back of his waist. His entire lower-half was caught in the pleasure. He moved in a frenzy, trying to grind onto John’s fingers and buck into his hand. It took him a moment of awkward movements before he finally found a rhythm.
Sherlock had never been so terrified in his life, because now, he finally understood his own weakness. John was the only thing he couldn't live without. He realized that he loves John.
“In a relationship? With you? Obviously! Sherlock, you are the definition of tall, dark, and handsome. Have you heard your voice? It’s the most alluring thing I’ve ever heard! I’m in love with you and I have been for weeks! You’re a wonderful person, Sherlock, of course I want a relationship with you.”
Sherlock smirked at the way John's pitch went up when he spoke. "I stole them from Donovan." He shifted when he felt a fingertip press against his entrance, but that didn't deter his intentions. "Want me to use them on you?" He offered, hearing a soft gasp of shock behind him.
The man had never sung outright, but humming or softly mumbling a song to himself had become as familiar to Sherlock as breathing. He wanted, no, he needed to hear John sing once more. The flat felt too silent without it. He tried and tried again to fill it with the noise of his violin, deductions, the TV, conversation, he's tried everything but he's come to realize that nothing will ever replace the sound of John's voice echoing through the rooms.
“I can’t believe you made me spend half the day in bed.” He said as he looked at the time and realized they’d just missed lunch.
Finally. He got the words out.
John looked back down at his newspaper and he thought a moment, thinking that maybe now was a good time to try and make a move on Sherlock. "Would you fancy going to Angelo's tonight?"
He had the gall to let out a laugh, but quickly found that to be a mistake. His laughter made him tighten around those fingers that were still slowly massaging the inside of his rim. He groaned at the increased pressure and he could feel the pride radiating off of John. "Nevertheless, you of all people should know I'm impossible to shut up."
“Sherlock?” Lestrade was confused because there was no case, and Sherlock didn’t typically call just to chat, meaning something was probably wrong.
Sherlock still couldn’t meet John’s eye. “Don’t hurt me.”
“Molly, I know nothing of his feelings for me!”
Lestrade froze where he sat at his desk and blinked a few times. “Why would I even kn-“
“Tonight?” John asked. “Bit short-notice, yea?”
Sherlock was almost impressed by the way they seamlessly went from nervous strangers to brother and sister. It was obvious how close they once were, not just siblings, but friends. Whatever happened between them must not have been terribly personal because neither seemed uncomfortable or worried about offending the other in their taunts. He put on an amused smile as he watched them squabble.
All those years apart, all those months of quiet, and he finally had his humming John back.
Sherlock opened his mouth to say something, but he stopped himself before any words came out. Perhaps it was his revelation, perhaps it was the humming, but something made him particularly open. So he told the truth. "I don't think you notice but you always had a habit of humming to yourself, a few times you would sing softly. It was never annoying, eventually it just became part of living here. I didn't realize how important it had become to me until I spent all that time without it. I haven't heard you hum in three years. I suppose I'm just ..... happy to hear it again."
He could tell that Harry felt guilty too. “I think this’ll be good for us. We could ..... we.” He took a deep breath and tried once more to get his feelings out, “We could try again.”
“Yea. You do look stunning in it. But then again, you look gorgeous in everything you wear. Even your bed sheets.” He gave a sly smirk.
The shorter man let out a chuckle and he bit his lip, seeming to think about what he wanted to do. “I’m definitely waking you up with that thing in my mouth. But for now, turn over.” He instructed.
conventionally attractive. Attractive enough that his age was no problem, though he was only in his early forties. Deep blue eyes, one laugh line deeper than the other from the crooked way he sniffles, small lips dusted over with a color exactly like a pink rose, the way they slowly turned red as he spoke or when he licked his lips, his charming smile, nice but not overbearing jawline, soft features that suited him perfectly, in fact, everything seemed to fit perfectly on his face so that nothing was too big or too small. He was so adorable that neither his age nor his height deterred people from hitting on him.
“What are you doing here?” Sherlock asked, entirely unamused.
John blinked. It wasn’t the response he had been expecting. Sherlock was usually confident in his deductions, but now, he was shy and uncertain. He reached across the table and set his hand on top of Sherlock’s. “You might not be.” He encouraged.
He smiled and kept up conversation while his mind began to reel. Why did he think that? Of all things, why was jealousy a response?!
“Sherlock, what’s wrong?”
John wanted to say, “Because she knows far too many embarrassing stories about me and has no filter.” It would be a valid excuse, it could put the meeting off for a while, but it was a lie. So instead, he half-mumbled the most honest excuse he could come up with, “I don’t know. It’s never come up before. If you want to, I could call her up.”
John raised an eyebrow, “What makes you think I like your maroon button-up? I’ve never said anything about it before.” Sherlock wasn't wrong, obviously, but John still wanted to know how he figured it out.
Angelo came back with the bottle of wine and poured their glasses, leaving the bottle at the table. He took their food orders and then he left them alone a while.
“Well, I’ve heard quite a bit about you Sherl-“
“My maroon button-up that you like so much and my black suit jacket.”
“Because you aren’t blind, John. That silk maroon with my complexion and hair color can illicit lust from anyone who looks upon me.” He spoke as if it were axiomatic.
He was not only content, but he was excited by living the rest of his life like that. The idea felt warm and cozy to him. It felt right.
John’s lips parted in shock and he looked up at his boyfriend with pink cheeks. “You think my sweaters are delightful?” He typically wore them out of comfort, not because he thought they impressed anyone.
Sherlock let out a chuckle. "I suppose you're right."
John’s eyes immediately went to meet Sherlock’s. “What do you mean?” He felt himself get hopeful again, like an idiot.
“Finally! Confident in your deductions! And you’re entirely correct. I’m inclined to agree that I do love John. I love him very much. So. The facts have changed. John finds me physically attractive, and I have loving feelings for John.”
“Takeaway?” He suggested.
Sherlock’s cheeks nearly matched the wine. “John Hamish Watson, I swear if you don’t stop I’ll set the flat on fire.”
John’s eyes were a bit wide and held quite a few emotions: fear, regret, and vulnerability were mixed in. His parents were obviously a touchy subject. “How long have you two known?”
“Yea, I guess I am.”
There was a pause on the other line. “Oh. You like him? As in, a friendly way ..... or something more?”
He felt and saw the eyes slowly rake up his body, soaking in every detail. John hadn’t felt this naked in a long time. He was utterly exposed.
“That you have issues with your parents? A few years now.” Mycroft answered.
“Today. I have a serious question for you.”
John couldn’t help his pride swelling a bit at that. “Are you uncomfortable?”
He watched the expression change from intense, to a brief state of shock, relax into something loving, and then turn into something warm and happy. He’d never seen such expressions on Sherlock’s face and he thought it nothing short of beautiful.
Sherlock didn’t want to hurt John with his prying, but he was so curious. “It has something to do with your parents, I've figured that much. But, if you don’t want to talk about it, I won’t ask.”
When Sherlock turned to glare at him for stopping, he only grinned down at him. “Don’t worry, I was only wondering where you kept your lube?” He knew for a fact that Sherlock owned lube. He couldn’t expect dealers to have it when he went off all those years ago.
Does he want to grow old with Sherlock, does he want to spend the rest of his life with this man?
John should have expected Sherlock would already have made a deduction about it. But by the same token, he was pleasantly surprised that Sherlock was willing to drop it. “Thank you.”
They'd picked up the odd habit of staying up late together and talking. They talked about everything. About Harry, Sherlock's future bees, John's time in the military, their childhoods, their futures, cases, Mycroft, everything they could think of. Nothing was too far or too personal.
But still, it wasn’t as if he was only there for a second. He stood there, stunned, before leaving. He should have had time to register that he was physically attracted to Adler. But he wasn’t attracted to her. He wasn’t at all.
. And I’ve dated many different people who are all over the gender spectrum.”
Lestrade wanted to argue. He really did. He wanted to tell Sherlock that he didn’t know what he means, he wanted to change the subject, he wanted to deny it all, but he couldn’t. Sherlock was absolutely right and they both knew it. He’d promised John that everything they said while drunk, stayed between them. But quite honestly, if he stayed silent, then there was a good chance that nothing would ever happen between them. As their friend, Lestrade couldn’t allow that to happen.
Sherlock was incredibly interested to see that she was second on his speed dial.
“Watch yourself, unless you want me to find a way into your pants.” John warned, turning to unlock the door with a grin.
“No, you flirted with me and it worked. That doesn’t denote a hierarchy.”
“Do you not want to see her?”
John flushed and he pushed the tip of his finger inside, slowly moving it around the entrance that he had carefully licked open. He pressed and twisted his finger to tease the nerves that rested just inside of him. "Have you already forgotten our conversation after you met my sister. I'm the top, not you." He slipped his finger in a bit deeper and managed to get it in about halfway before he met resistance. He gently pumped his finger to start working it deeper, already pressing a second fingertip to his entrance.
Sherlock nearly chocked on his own inhale at the complement. He couldn’t believe John had just said that.
Sherlock nodded.
John should have had a greater reaction to seeing a nude woman.
Sherlock looked at the bedside drawers with an ashamed expression.
The taller man scoffed, "Don't be daft, John. You're a handsome man."
John wanted to pull away to make a comment about Sherlock’s “self-control”, but couldn’t make himself leave those soft lips. He was held captive. He traced the underside of Sherlock’s lower lip again before giving a gentle nip.
John’s mouth opened and closed before he could come up with an excuse. He should have known he wouldn't be able to get away with something like that. Not with Sherlock's careful mind. “I wanted to look nice. Why? Is there a problem with it?”
After asking himself the question, he found his answer had come without any hesitation whatsoever.
Sherlock cracked a smile and chuckled. “The song is more important than conversation?”
Sherlock noticed how John’s jaw tightened, he began to rub the pad of his thumb back and forth over his fingernails, and a nervous smile took over his features. John was anxious.
John kept his face pressed against Sherlock and found himself struggling with his own desires. His tongue was tightened to a point, making it smaller and easier to take. He wanted to shove the entire relaxed muscle into Sherlock. He wanted to make the man above him wail and tremble. He decided to test the waters by slowly relaxing his tongue, hardly giving Sherlock a stretch.
"Masculine. Short. Intelligent." He droned out with a shrug. He didn't want to say blonde because as John's hair would soon turn silver and he didn't want John to ever be under the impression that his hair color mattered to Sherlock.
One night, it all came to a head when John mentioned something that shook Sherlock to the very core.
John smiled and stifled a chuckle while Sherlock rolled his eyes.
went to Angelo's on special occasions or to celebrate something. Although John could occasionally be a bit spontaneous, this was out of character. John would never suggest Angelo's unless it was special. So what was special about today?
“Perhaps, but I’ll always have you to point your gun and end it for me. It’s really more of a distraction for you to grab it.”
Molly couldn’t help but to smile. He rarely did it, but when Sherlock complemented something, she knew it was genuine. Had he said this a few years ago, she may have giggled. But the ring on her finger and her fiancée sitting across from her lessened the effect it might have had. “When did you realize this?”
He let his eyes met John’s form, slowly raking over the other with the focus of a predator that was calculating an attack on it’s prey. He took in every detail and found that there was no inch of John that he found unattractive. Every part of the man before him was pleasing to the eye and that unnerved him. He’s never found someone to be so completely attractive before. To him, John had no real flaws, only little quirks that made him even more attractive. Like that stupid laughter line that was deeper than the other. That in particular he found to be overwhelmingly charming.
“I need to make a phone call.” He announced as he quickly stood and went into his room, noticeably faster than his normal walking pace. He cursed himself for it, knowing that John noticed.
“Of course I do! You’re quite pleasantly short, your sweaters are delightful, one of your laughter lines is deeper than the other and I think it’s absolutely charming, something about the shape of your nose is also quite endearing. Scientifically speaking, you have a very appealing face. Everything fits perfectly, I can’t seem to describe just how charming it is. But I have a personal soft spot for your laughter lines and your eyes. They’re so gentle and such a deep blue, exactly like the ocean.” He spoke as if he were stating facts, but that made it all the more meaningful to John because it showed how truthful Sherlock was being.
There was a twinkle of curiosity in John’s eyes, so he decided to take a shot with one last question. “Why are you so eager to be with me? I thought your body was just a vessel.”
That only sent him down another rabbit hole. All the ways he was attracted to John’s personality. His maturity, confidence, sarcasm, calmness, brains, strength, vulnerabilities, it was all so wonderful to him.
John nodded and his eyes briefly flickered to Sherlock’s lips as he spoke. “I’m completely single.”
The walk was quiet and comfortable. The both of them were mentally trying to figure out if they could consider this a date, but John was under the impression that Sherlock had no romantic feelings for him.
“Are you sure you aren’t
John quickly stood to greet her, wrapping her in a hug. “Harry! Goodness, you’ve grown your hair out!”
He told himself it was only dinner at Angelo's and that there wasn't some deeper meaning or intention. But by the same token, he wished it was more than a simple dinner.
cha-“
Sherlock nodded. “Good. Wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing anything else. I’m going into my head a while. Need to reorganize.” He seemed slightly distracted as he spoke, as if he was already leaving the world around him.
“So this is what makes life divine. I'm all aglow, hmm. And now I know.” Again, he added his runs and riffs that Sherlock was starting to find a bit charming.
“He’s said quite a few things.”
Sherlock blinked a few times and leaned back in his seat. For some reason, he found himself happy that John was interested in men, but he didn’t know why.
“I do. I really do. I’ve missed her. I’m just scared. I don’t want to make everything even worse than it already is. I just want things to get better.”
Harry let out a laugh, blissfully detached from their tension. “Alright alpha males, calm down.” She commented as Angelo came around to their their orders.
“Yes.”
“I’ve noticed you’ve started doing this everywhere we go.”
“You’re tapping your foot. You never tap your foot.”
Since their conversation on sex, Sherlock and John’s relationship actually remained quite tame. They’d done nothing besides some passionate kissing, but even that took about a month for Sherlock to fully warm up to.
Part of him wanted to sent a text asking why he wasn’t notified about their new relationship, but this was much bigger than some small life development, this was bigger than a simple text. With a smirk, he decided that this warranted a personal visit.
When they went up there, John sat in his usual chair and motioned to the sofa. “Have a seat, Sherlock. We ought to have a chat.”
His inner thighs shook at the oncoming pleasure. He could feel how close it was. He needed it. He swirled his hips as quickly as he could and tugged at his hands yet again. He loved the way Sherlock touched him. He let out a growl as he felt his end inching closer. He went into a frenzy as rubbed himself into Sherlock’s fingers and mouth.
But my body burned with desire for him, no matter what conditions he set.  And the requests he had made so far had been acceptable to me: no grovelling or treating him as some sort of superior, just the acceptance that his was the only authority.  I could have walked out at any time, but having chosen twice now to stay, the memory of the pleasure received set me quivering.
I rolled my weight from him, and lay on my side.  I pulled on his shoulder as I went, so that he rolled into a matching position, his back against my front.  I kissed the back of his neck lingeringly, as I had so wanted to do before, and wondered what was the right thing to do next.
And for most of an hour my admiration is what they received, as they took turns describing their case for me.  Slowly I became aware of something in Holmes's manner, in his division of attention between Lestrade and myself.  When Holmes spoke, Lestrade looked back and forth between us, but when Lestrade was speaking, Holmes's eyes never left his face.
"Yes, that's good.  Now stretch your arms up, pull it loose a little around the waist.  Shift your hips forward a bit."  His hands reached over the back of the settee to place a cushion behind my back, and to tweak the shirt further open as well.  "Now touch yourself."
'Up' in this context meant his assistance in pulling me back onto my knees, able to rest my weight back on my heels instead of being suspended between hips and shoulders.  Holmes looked down at my swollen purple shaft and thought for a moment.
When I came back to myself, I was lying flat on the settee, clean and covered with a blanket.  Holmes stood with his back to me, hands in pockets, gazing out of the window.  I had no idea what to say to him, and looking at his stance, I suspected he had no idea what to say to me.
"Well, actually I do...  But since your imagination and intellect so far outstrip my own, I would not want to constrain you to my pedestrian ideas."  I paused while he snorted around a mouthful of egg at my insincerity.   "The winner gets to name the forfeit, after the issue is decided."
"No."
"That's right, take him.  You have wanted him for a long time, have you not?"  The voice was lurid in my ears, its implications plain.  I hesitated, suddenly wondering if Watson would misunderstand my eagerness for his touch.  I have hidden my desire for him under a mantle of complete propriety, as any gentleman would in the same situation, be the object of his affections male or female.
Or, I tried to.  For now the change had spread further, and my entire body had altered to match my hands.  I seemed to have the form of a giant cephalopod of some sort, a rounded mass of body with nothing but tentacles for limbs.  I still held to Watson, ignoring his attempts to get away, hoping that he would be able to see that it was still me he was trying to help.
.  This was a BAD THING.
I hoped he would miss it.  I knew he would not.
I suspected even then that it was just as well.
"Well, a solider may risk his life for any of a thousand men he does not even know, so perhaps that tells us nothing," the voice mused.  "Maybe he should risk more?"
"Come now, Holmes, trust me!  Do you think I am going to make you wear your shoes on the wrong feet or something?  I'll be out most of today, but I will be home in good time."  I made sure not to linger.  I wanted to be safely out of range of his questions, and besides, I was not certain how long I could refrain from laughing.
He had built a false shelf onto the bottom of the dresser, visible only to someone lying flat on the floor, as I was.  The shelf contained only a single sheet of paper, which I recognised as my own foolscap stationery.  It was only after I drew it out that I remembered the lines I had so casually written.
In the morning it was clear that no such illumination had occurred.  I managed to talk him into a small amount of breakfast, and then he decided to return to the embassy.  On the way he opened up a little, sharing some of his frustration.
"A better performance than last time.  These things are important, and should be done properly.  Now stay put."  Holmes walked out of the room, closing the door behind him.
I hesitated for one more second, then pushed my underclothes down around my ankles, kicking them aside and standing up straight again.
Holmes considered his words for some time.   "It wasn't the same as I was expecting. It was, less intense?"  All my contentment evaporated, for it seemed that I had failed in the one thing that mattered most, showing Holmes that pleasure could be found without leaving him bleeding.
"We're going to have sex with you, since sex in a fantasy universe is always perfect.  No flatulence, no having your hair knelt on, no lack of ability, or imagination, no STDs.  And no making an offer to have the response be simply 'no', which I personally have had happen in real life."
Holmes must have been watching my expression, since his hands slid over my shoulders and he spoke softly into my ear.  "Yes, I rather thought you would notice that.   If you recall, we made a wager, and cost to you was ten minutes of your time."  He leaned forwards a little, pressing his entire body along the length of mine.  "That time starts now."
It was beautiful to watch.  He started to cough, strangled it back, and then began choking instead.  He did manage to cover his mouth with his napkin before the drink sprayed out noisily, while I thumped helpfully between his shoulderblades.  We were soon surrounded by no less than three waiters and the maitre d', all solicitously offering glasses of water, apologies, and other assistance, while seeking reassurance that the great detective was not going to expire on their premises.
I spent time over the answer to this weighty issue, since the steam from my bath had been sufficient to make the small room pleasantly warm.  I stretched and twisted a few times, gave my limbs a bit of a shake, and then there came a rap on the door.  Holmes, I assumed, since it was unlikely that Mrs. Hudson would disturb me here.  "Mrmmrm?"
I was half talking to him, and half thinking aloud.  "If I back up to the age most boys begin experimenting, I would find you at your boarding school... Holmes, are you telling me that your total participation in sex consists of someone bashing you once or twice and then forcing themselves on you without further formalities?"
It was futile.  His tentacles, as I must call them, had grown to several feet in length, tapering in thickness from delicate tips to as large around as the top of my thigh.  The rest of Holmes was also distorted.  His head remained, but revoltingly swollen and featureless, without the solid firmness of decent flesh.  His body I could not see at all, if it was still there.  He had become to my sight simply a bloated sac with reaching tentacles, but still somehow
Finally Holmes was moving freely and without restraint, driving into me as I braced myself with my arms and pressed back to meet him.  His breathing was harsh and noisy, and his skin sweaty.  His hands gripped my hips, fingers digging hard into my flesh, just as my newfound craving demanded.
I remember little of the decor of the bedroom.  I remember perfectly the sound of Holmes's voice in my ear, so loaded with promise that even now the memory of it can make me harden.  "How do you want it?"
"I have not had a worthwhile mount for some time," and he smiled very slightly, "but I have high hopes at the moment."  Then he turned away and led me into his bedroom.
"Quiet!" and he swiftly did the same to my other wrist, then both ankles.  I was forced to admit, he finished within the four minutes he had defined.
--------------
He thought over this for a while.  I took the opportunity to refill his cup.  I swear, his colour was better already.  If I could keep him sitting for another ten minutes, I would count it among my successes.
Thus, enter Sherlock Holmes.
It was the most ordinary situation that reopened the subject between us.  We had returned home later than usual, to find Mrs. Hudson gone to bed after providing us with a cold supper and a fire laid ready in the grate.
I was alarmed at being left like this, naked and exposed in the centre of the room.  Holmes had never left me before; I saw now that I had been unconsciously depending upon him to cover for me somehow if we were discovered.  I tried to compose myself, and in truth it must have been only a few minutes before he returned.
"Not much later, I hope." he replied, releasing me with some reluctance.  "Also, we just turned into Baker Street."  He swiftly did up my buttons for me, and we checked each other's appearance for seemliness as the cab halted outside our door.
"Mycroft?  Well, well.  At least his problems are usually interesting."
It must have been correct.  He pressed forward suddenly, gripping my shoulders in both hands, shoving me against the door with the length of his body.  His lips captured mine, his tongue demanding entry.  His sudden change of mood caught me completely off guard, and I yielded without a second thought.  Holmes' body was hard with muscle despite his slenderness, and his strength still surprised me after all this time.  He possessed my mouth, and I shivered at the burn that ran up my spine at his insistent assault.
"Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!"  I cried with some bitterness.  "I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.  Why am I here at all, if you are watching over my shoulder to check all my doings for yourself?"
"Oh, have it your way.  Fifteen minutes, but no more."  Holmes half sat, half fell into his chair and attacked the toast and eggs.  "So?  This wager of yours?"
"Have you been altering my writing at all?"
The first read only: "Yes, to both objects.  I have trustworthy reports. M."  The second was not much longer:  "Reported 21st May at 0916, just offshore Sheerness, heading north and west." and was from the Department of the Admiralty.
"Now you are thinking that I am going to take you, tonight, but I am merely looking, and anticipating.  Indeed, I will not even touch you."  Holmes paused for a moment.  "Not with my hands, that is."  And he placed the leather loop of the crop on that small plain square of skin known as the perineum.  With a delicate touch he began to massage the oil into my skin, dragging the loop back and forth over my sac, occasionally reaching as far as the very base of my member, but more often just falling short.
---------------
I could see why Holmes had been so serious about clarifying his tastes before proceeding, when he took a cravat from the clothes-stand and bound my wrists together with it.  Since he had specifically mentioned binding me, I was not taken completely by surprise, but I was not entirely comfortable either.  The discomfort was purely mental; the cravat was not overly tight, and did not chafe like a rope might.  I pulled slightly against the binding once or twice, and decided I could get used to it.
The lewd double meaning in "presenting itself" struck us at the same time, and we both had great difficulty in maintaining our gentlemanly demeanour.  Indeed, over supper I saw his lips twitching every time we made eye contact.  Otherwise we behaved as always, except that Holmes was rather more attentive to my comfort than his usual self-absorption permitted.
Holmes laughed.  "In that case, back as you were."
Doctor Watson rather liked being on the Isle of Thanet with Mycock Holmes, especially since cocks rise up 'to greet the dawn'.  Watson had to get Dawn out of the room every time she came in to tidy up, but after that he and Mycock could get on with pretending to be three people.
"Holmes, there was something else I wanted to mention."
I could see the hook was at least half set in him.  He loses so rarely, a wager is almost irresistible to him.  And for my part, I hardly cared if I won or lost, as long as I could prevent him from collapsing out in the street.
Watson began to move again, finally attaining his feet and reaching for me.  I understood his intention; he saw something in me that had convinced him I was in danger, and he was going to pull me from the cottage into the open air.  With a strange voice in my head I had to agree with him that the drug was actively affecting me, and I reached out to take his hands.
"Holmes, this is
“If I am going to be accused of sensationalism, I may as well have committed it.”  I remarked, as innocently as possible, then plucked the sheet from Holmes’s fingers and read it aloud.
"No, you are not wrong, and no apology is required.  I have hoped for a long time now that you might someday approach me."
"If you insist.  Call me when you start to get ready, and I will help you get dressed."
I did as he said, and looked up as I finished to find him waiting patiently for me.  When he saw I was done he asked, "How are you feeling?  If you have any comments or complaints, now is the time.  I pressed you perhaps farther than I should have, but you performed admirably."  I was ridiculously warmed by his praise; Holmes never gives it except in utmost seriousness.
"Watson.  Was the service at dinner that terrible?"
"Hmm?"  He was still appraising the cognac, holding the liquid in his mouth to gather the full effect of the taste as it warmed, then he closed his eyes to swallow.
Holmes relieved me of that decision, however, for when I broke from the kiss I realized his own hand was already busy with a definitely solid erection.  I held completely still, almost not even breathing, for fear of ruining things.  He was not at it for very long, and as he came he leant his head back towards me, and I rested my cheek on his.
"I can't if you do that!"  I managed to gasp out, holding back but only with a great effort.  I don't know if it was pity or cruelty when he stopped, but he rose gracefully from his knees to join me on the settee, sliding into the embrace of my left arm as if he had been made solely to fit there.  His right arm was around my neck as I turned to kiss him, no longer caring the slightest about all the doubts that had plagued me earlier.  Tongues and lips met and parted, and his mouth was as hot and his breathing as desperate as mine.
"Well..."  I began idly scratching my chest hair, where the formal shirt had been pressing it flat.  It was more of a daily habit than a deliberate decision, something I always found pleasurable and relaxing.  And from there I let my hands gradually drift downwards, scratching less and stroking more, where the skin was softer.
Sherlock Holmes called upon his brother in the Stranger's Room of the Diogenes Club.  The usual polite formalities were exchanged, and they sat in a discreetly isolated pair of chairs.
compliance I am trying to gain.  The Prime Minister is nothing to me.  Well?"
!  Now remove your tie, and your collar.  You can pass them to me if you like, I will put them out of the way."
Holmes pulled back, and looked at me with concern on his face.  "What is it?" he whispered, holding my chin so that I could not look away.
"You're in a bold mood," he whispered, breaking our kiss.  "It's just as well I like that in you.  Now the other hand."
"What more indeed?  How about a loyal friend, whom you see as a potential liability?  You think I am all weak kindness without discipline, and would have trotted out to see you, even after instructions to keep clear. Well, I have had enough of your lack of trust, your insults, and your carelessness of my feelings.  Even if you had never called me your friend I would have been entitled to some courtesy as your fellow lodger.  I am off for London, and by the time you return I will have vacated my room.  Would you like me to leave you a dog as a farewell gift?  You can train him to come and to go as you say without fearing disobedience, and he will be more use to you than I!"
private, if you follow my meaning.  Unless you would rather we return to the main house and be assigned a pair of bedrooms with a mile of hallway in between?"
"Yes, John, strangely so."
Even as I watched, his shoulders dropped a trifle, and he turned halfway around towards me, paused, and then resolutely met my eyes.  Only now did I realise he had been afraid.
"I am sorry, Holmes.  I had no right to do that.  Since we are not partners in that sense, your private preferences are no concern of mine."
"Holmes?  You wanted to ask me something?"  I prompted, when it seemed that he was not going to speak.
"No, no.  I am making no criticism.  Forgive me for speaking out of turn."
I would have laughed, but Holmes had appended some writing of his own below mine.
"There, see?  Not so bad, was it?"  He had the gall to pat my cheek, as if I was a child sitting still for a haircut.  "Now, I am hardly a cook, so dessert is rather simple.  You will be glad to hear that I excluded all choices with the word "flambé" in them."
"You are determined to have it all?  Well, then, I have gone to brothels and paid my money.  They have kissed and stroked and tried their tricks, and done nothing for me.  One gave me back my money; the other cursed me into the street.  Since then I have tried to avoid the entire issue."
"Quickly, then.  I need to send a telegram, and then see Mycroft."
I pulled his dressing gown open, and gazed hungrily at the lean body exposed to me.  His skin was very pale, with only a light scattering of body hair, and he had so little fat on him that the muscles were clearly defined.  I ran my hands down the length of his frame, shoulders to ankles, and back up to rest at his waist.
"Holmes, really.  These telegrams prove nothing, without knowledge of the questions you asked.  You will need to do better than this."
"Are you serious?"
It was not fake modesty.  He was the only person who knew where that collar was concealed, and he was going to keep it that way.  Listen as hard as I might, I could pick up no clue as to where in the room he moved to retrieve it.
He moved, then.  He was quick enough to get the bag from my hand before I realised he was after it.  He took one incredulous look inside, then groaned out loud and thrust it back.
"Watson.  If I could have your indulgence for a short moment."  Holmes indeed.  I sent up a fervent prayer that he was not about to tell me we had ten minutes to catch a train to some God-forsaken place.  Wrapping the towel around my waist, I opened the door for him.  I noted with some relief that he was not carrying either his gloves or a hat, although he was still in his day clothes, not yet having succumbed to dressing-gown and slippers.
"That time you found me in your room, and pinned me on the floor - that aroused you."  It was not a question, but he nodded anyway.  "And just now, when I was kneeling in front of you?"  And he nodded again.  "So you want an inferior."
I tried to pretend for a while that our encounter had made no difference.  After all, Holmes had only touched me briefly, if intimately, and I had given him only a single kiss.  But when I lay in bed on the following nights, my hands seemed lifeless without his whispered urgings, and even when I climaxed I missed the illicit thrill of knowing his intense stare was fixed on me.
"The door is closed, but not locked.  You may leave at any time you wish, and I will not follow you.  You may also say 'no' if I do something you dislike.  Otherwise I will assume you are consenting and I will do as I wish.  Do you understand?"
It took a moment for me to find my answer; a misstep at this early stage would shatter the illusion we were building.  I should not meet his ire with irritation as if I was his equal; my role here was placatory.  Contrition was wanted.  "I am sorry, Holmes.  I did not mean to embarrass you with my poor behaviour."
He groaned and turned to lean his forehead against the wall.  "Watson.  I hereby take back everything, everything!, I have ever said slighting your imagination and ingenuity.  I had thought you could not make things any worse, but you have."
------------------------------------
"A drink first!" cried Holmes, pouring brandy into three tumblers, and passing two of them over.  "A toast to the proper application of logic and truncheons."
"Yes.  And it may be not the law's opinion, or the majority of society's opinion, but I'm not talking to them.  I am talking to you."
Holmes continued, "I would not want anything to change in the rest of our lives - I need your strength, your intelligence, and your willingness to stand against me when you think me wrong."  I saw the seriousness of his expression.  "It is one reason I have hesitated in taking this further.  I do not want obedience to become a habit with you.  If the price of having you sexually is the loss of your character, then it is too high."
Sherlock shared his croft with a man who was not his brother, but hung around them always trying to work out wat was going on, and so was named 'Watson'.
When they got back to London, Mycroft Holmes, who had been going by Roft Holmes while Sherlock borrowed the first part of his name, was quite keen to indulge in being three people with Sherlock and Doctor Watson.  This led to a surfeit of orgasms in Mrs. Hudson's bakery and she threw them out, especially as they refused to be four people with her (thus the phrase 'she was not fourth coming').
It had been a very long time for him, but I was convinced by now that he did not, in truth, want to be treated too gently.  I decided to compromise with plenty of oil, but not use my fingers first as I would normally have done.  It should be possible, with care, to stretch him enough to sting without doing any true damage.
"Yes, oh
I took one hand and curled it around his sac, squeezing most gently to roll the testes in my palm.  Holmes made a deep sound of pleasure at my touch.  I thought more of what he had done to me, and opened my mouth to take the end of his member completely inside.  Even as the one giving gratification I groaned at the feel of it, warm and solid.  Holmes pressed into my touch, and I took him deeper, caressing him with my tongue.
I put his words into a corner of my mind to think on "later"; I was far enough along that analytic capacity was pushed aside in favour of simple instinct.  I moaned and rubbed my cheek against him, and he laughed softly.
"And you are getting soppy in your old age."  I grumbled, but turned my head to catch his eye and let him see my smile.
"Watson!  In God's name, no, it's not like that!  If I wanted an imbecile to dumbly follow orders, I am sure I could find one; this
I woke to find that the sun had shifted to fall full into my lap, and one part of me at least was enthusiastic about both the warmth and the dream.  I suppose many people would have found the dream shocking, but my army service had taken me outside the confines of polite society as most Englishmen know it.  Many senior officers viewed a discreet quick tumble between equals as a lesser evil than a scandal with someone's wife or daughter, or catching a disease from the local whores.  And of course much of Indian society has long been tolerant of relationships between men.
He also knew that he couldn’t hide in his room forever.
Sherlock nodded with a smile still on his face and ate.
“Impossible, I know the names of everyone you’ve dated.”
He wanted so badly to rock his hips but he didn’t want to choke Sherlock. Instead, he kept them pressed to the mattress and twisted them a bit, that was all he could do for now. He let out a whine and tried to move his hands again. “Fuck, I still can’t believe this.”
He sighed and thought a moment, almost seeming pained. His struggle to put his feelings to words wasn't a new thing, but it had never been so obvious before. “No, you don’t. You know that I don’t mean to be rude, but you don’t know what I meant. What I’m trying to say, is that this is all very out of character and spontaneous, but that isn't a bad thing.” Sherlock huffed, looking at the ground as he tried to find the right words to say before looking back up at John. "I." Was all he got out at first. "I'm sorry."
A soft chuckle left John’s mouth as he tugged off the last of Sherlock’s clothes.
"Oh I'm a sucker for you! You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly." John didn't mean to show off, but he was a fan of riffs and runs. He made sure to slide them in whenever he could. "I'm a sucker for you, yeah. Any road you take, you know that you'll find me. I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things no one knows about you, about you. And you're making the typical me break my typical rules. It's true, I'm a sucker for you!"
John wasn’t even phased by his sudden resurgence into reality. “Already ordered.”
Sherlock was in a state of shock. He didn’t know what to do or say for a moment. He felt himself quickly sobering up.
“Before ..... the fall ..... I was a very cold man. I didn’t listen to a lot of the things you said because I thought you’d eventually tire of me and leave. Afterwards I did listen more. But, my brain had a tendency to gloss over uninteresting things like pronouns or what term you used to describe your significant other. But I did listen. I remember Angel played the flute, Avery was from Greece, and you had an uncanny amount of sex with Morgan. Of course, you didn’t tell me that last bit, I deduced it.”
John almost felt silly getting dressed up.
“No. Do as you please.” Truthfully, he found it hard to think. He had been forced out of his head and he was living in the moment. It was quite a vulnerable state of being.
He furrowed his eyebrows and his eyes moved to stare at the floor as he focused more and more on his racing thoughts.
Sherlock attempted to smirk around the prick in his mouth, sliding down a bit deeper before pulling away with an impish grin. His hand tugged at John while he spoke, “I’m a man of my word.” His tone was wrecked from his orgasm and from sucking John.
John raised an eyebrow. "No one."
Sherlock and John went to the latest scene and they were on fire. Sherlock rattling off deductions while John assessed the damage.
“I always assumed he fancied you, but I didn’t think I was right so I never said anything.”
Sherlock chuckled around his length and John yelped at the vibrations, his hips involuntarily bucking. He raised an eyebrow and hummed intentionally. This time, John writhed and he got a bit louder. “Don’t fucking do that, it’s embarrassing.”
"Oh, then I would love to accompany you to Angelo's."
He shouldn’t be happy about that.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “You’re intentionally dressed in an attractive outfit that you hardly ever wear, you’re wearing your favorite cologne that you only ever wear when you want to impress someone, you’re ordering wine for the first time and pulling out knowledge on it, and you chose to eat at an emotionally significant restaurant that you only ever suggest we eat at during celebrations or special occasions.”
He nodded. “I don’t see why not. You’ve met all my family, so I might as well meet your sister. She’s in a program now, yes? For her alcoholism?”
“Our sexual tension was building and bound to crash either today or tomorrow. I wanted to be prepared.” He seemed a bit embarrassed, and he was. He was basically confessing that he hoped John would fuck him today or tomorrow.
He was married to his work, he loved his work, his work had never taken second place to anyone or anything. Except, it did.
When Sherlock came out of it, the first thing he noticed was that John was humming. His heart fluttered and he blinked a few times. John was humming again.
John bit his lip and basked in the sounds that came from his boyfriend. Each one was something pulled straight out of John’s midnight fantasies. He couldn’t believe he had Sherlock writhing around like this, moving his hips in such a lewd way, chasing his pleasure. He noticed how Sherlock’s balls were beginning to tighten and he grinned. Sherlock was close. He intended to overcome the man with pleasure.
with John?”
"Lines can get blurry when I want them to." John said with a smug smile.
“Lestrade, there’s no time to waste! I’m in love with John and I have to know how he feels about me!” He demanded.
John raised an eyebrow. “Sherlock, don’t be rude. That’s your brother and I’ve already made tea.” He said as he came out of the kitchen, setting the tea on the table. “Biscuits?” He offered.
John cracked a smile, “You’re right, I don’t. But I also don’t want to do something you aren’t ready for.”
"Neither I about you. I had been under the impression that you only like women."
“Even if I am married to my work, and even if a relationship would be difficult, it doesn’t matter, because I’ve fallen in love and that was the absolute worst decision I could have made!”
Sherlock wasn’t entirely sure what to make of that, but again, he left it alone for John.
“I am.” She mouthed back.
"Sherlock, in the past six years I've dated five different men."
He grinned and moved closer, wrapping his arms around the man he loves. “I love you, Sherlock.”
“I assumed you did, it’s obvious that you have issues with your own parents.”
Sherlock had made up his mind.
Sherlock has something similar, partial heterochromia, where parts of his iris were a slightly different shade than the rest of his bluish-green eyes.
He blinked a few times in surprise at his own thought.
He stood up, stretched once more, and went straight to his mirror. He knew there was no point, but he still felt the needless biological urge to fix his appearance before he presented himself to a potential mate. He straightened his clothes, fixed his hair, and felt like a complete idiot.
“Well, now you know. So leave.”
When John got up to make some more tea, Sherlock looked through the newspaper. He scanned the entirety of it and nothing happened today that John would deem worthy enough for celebration. Conclusion, their conversation about John having a potential paramour is what triggered the day becoming special.
John raised an eyebrow. “Alex, Morgan, and Avery were all men. Taylor was gender-fluid and Angel didn’t want to be labeled as anything. In fact, I haven’t dated a woman in three years.” His voice changed. It lost it’s amusement and a trace of doubt took over. “Didn’t you notice my use of they/them pronouns? Me and Taylor dated for six months, certainly you would have heard. Or perhaps, the fact that I openly used the terms boyfriend or significant other. It isn’t like I only spoke about my girlfriends.” His lips moved once more but no words came out. He was genuinely dumbfounded a moment before he finally found words, but they sounded quite sad. “I know I didn’t talk about my relationships often, but .....” He sounded hurt, “did you not ever listen?”
“John, I am no top, nor am I a bottom. I switch, and you’re going to have to learn to as well.” He pressed two fingers just above John’s entrance. He slowly massaged, rubbing around the area to find the right spot.
“Sherlock.” Mycroft quietly scolded. “That isn’t the only reason he likes our mum. She is a very sociable and friendly person. Something we obviously didn’t inherit.”
“For about a year now he’s been struggling with his feelings for you. Said he fancied you but that he needs to get over it because he thought you’d never feel that way about him. Three days ago, he told me he’s almost certain that he loves you. Keep in mind that was the night he was hammered on six shots of tequila.”
Sherlock blushed and cracked a small smile. “I love you too, John.”
He liked that John knew him so well, it made him smile, he was excited that John found him attractive, it made his pulse quicken, he also found John to be physically attractive, going as far to accidentally think the man to be adorable. This was the evidence that laid before him. It made him wonder if he was experiencing attraction towards John. A physical
“What about me?”
They stepped inside their flat and Sherlock found himself in John’s embrace as he finished his song.
Chasing killers into the night with his boyfriend. Neither of them could have asked for more.
When thinking back on the many fiends and murderers he's faced in his life, Sherlock Holmes has had very few intellectual equals. But when he truly thinks back on it, even fewer were genuinely able to surprise him.
John didn’t react because somehow, he didn’t find Alder to be physically attractive. At all.
If masculine, short, and intelligent was his type then it sounded like he had a shot. He wasn't sure how he was going to charm Sherlock, but he liked the challenge.
"So you really were hoping I would strike you, and then... Oh, Holmes."  I absolutely did not know what to say.
