Vernet took a hefty gulp from the wine, cackled and started babbling something about big coincidences again, refusing to give up his secret. But he forgot in whose company he sits now.
It was in the morning that I came to realise my mistake. I opened my eyes unexpectedly and Sherlock, although he put his bossy and self-confident countenance back on immediately, was not entirely able to mask the disappointment and bitterness mirrored on his face in that first minute. And it as was clear as day to me, what he thought at that moment.
“Yes, I see them.” Sherlock nodded, sounding a bit grim all of a sudden. “It’s Silvertown then. They chose a very fitting location for their hiding place, don’t you think?”
I almost rammed into Sherlock from behind. He stood right behind the threshold, rigid like the pillar of salt into which Lot's wife changed at the gates of Sodom. He held his deerstalker in one hand, revealing his pale face to me and I noticed his weirdly numb stare which was pointed at something placed at the far end of these premises.
Sherlock, stiff as a board, stays silent. His muscles are sinewy rather than bulky. They line the length of his limbs tight as steel cording. Swallowing, John wonders if Sherlock's long-held position has led to cramping. The captain steps back to provide Sherlock with more space. "At the very least, private, straighten up a bit. At ease." Nothing doing, the man might well be a lawn ornament. "Back straight. Head up, chest out. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart." The bloody git does nothing. "Now, soldier", John barks, kind of losing his shit.
“You want to examine De Vries’s enterprise? But Sherlock, it’s almost 9 pm!” He protested. “We will look into the matter tomorrow, OK? I’ll let you know when and we…”
After the busy whirlwind day, after the night full of the most pleasant exertion, he believed he would sleep like a log until noon. But that harsh raucous noise is making any slumber impossible now: the sound of Sherlock snoring loudly into his ear.
And just as unexpectedly, I felt how Sherlock's hand slid into mine. I don't know how he did it, but he suddenly stood by my side, straightened out into his full height and as taut as a violin string. His face turned into stone once more, but his fingers, intertwined with mine, trembled in nervous anticipation.
Incensed about the fact that these pleasant flirtations met such an end, I spun around at once and pierced the shouting madman with a death-glare. Not that it had any effect on him. The man – it was the same artsy type I noticed earlier – abandoned his valise on the nearby bench and surged at us like raging flood, still screeching cheerfully: “Guillaume!”
I looked there and got his point. The sleek boat of the kidnappers just burst out of ship-lock of the South Dock Marina which was the only way out of the Greenland Dock too. We managed to intercept them.
I glimpsed him at once and ill or no ill, I was on my feet in an instant, frantic with worry. My mouth opened in shock but I was unable to give out a shout in paranoid fear that it could reach him somehow and make him slip.
Apollo made of white marble, majestic and cold, stretching a bow and following an invisible target with his blind eyes.
“You said earlier you know the place quite well?” I inquired. “Then lead me. We must find some lodgings for the night, the sooner the better. Also, the more private and isolated it would be, the more suitable would I find it.”
Mycroft! As usual, he gave me a nasty shock when he appeared behind my back so suddenly. His eyes bore into me with undisguised irony and his lips were drawn into an unpleasant, contemptuous smirk. Damn him!
His silver eyes met mine and a shadow of a smile shivered on his lips when he said: “It was this fearless soldier who saved these treasures for your country. Give praise where it is due.”
“Well, Guillaume's grand-mère was a great admirer of Guillaume d'Orange called Fièrebras, Count of Toulouse, that famous Aquitanian knight who fought Saracens and ogres in the vicinity and was sainted for it. She had this grand tome full of Chansons de Geste in her library and La Chanson de Guillaume happened to be her most favourite one. She arranged her second grandson to be named after him.”
”14° of Celsius, north wind at 10 miles per hour, 91% of humidity, 60% chance of precipitation with showers likely in the evening,” replies Sherlock courtly.
The bell over the door rang sharply as Sherlock ran out into the night, the darkness outside swallowing him like the inky swamp water.
Sherlock's stubble is safely disposed off for some time by now, but John's hands are still continuing with their pleasant activity. They are stroking Sherlock's pale torso at the moment, inconspicuously descending lower and lower, until John is lightly chafing against a different kind of curls with his fingers.
The bell placed high on the wall rang angrily when the door was slammed shut into Sherlock's face. Two pairs of hostile, distrustful eyes pierced Sherlock from behind the glass. The slim female hand let down the blinds after that and cut the bistro from the rest of the world in an uncompromising manner.
Anderson’s face mirrored an acute embarrassment. He awkwardly shuffled his feet and confessed: “I called the boss twice during the last hour but he didn’t pick it up. Maybe he turned it to mute for some reason. I’m very sorry, Sherlock.”
However, strange loud din disturbed me unexpectedly. As in a dream, I observed the bearded figure with blood streaked face emerging from among some overturned shelves at the far end of the counter. Emitting the roar of absolute rage, the man ran to Sherlock swiftly and kicked my unconscious friend into the temple. I started. Screaming in return, I quickly lifted the piece of debris wallowing near me and threw it after the attacker. The metal shamble hit him into the back accurately and forced him to snap around.
He sat by the headboard, clutching at his waist as if he had severe abominable cramps. Every drop of blood disappeared from his face, leaving it as white as a bed-sheet and his eyes had a glassy expression in them. His lips moved as in a trance, repeating two words over and over.
Sherlock sighed softly when that happened and started to disrobe. He stripped down to the plain shirt and trousers and hung his coat, cap, jacket and vest on the rack. He remained standing near the wall after that, with his back turned to me.
“That would mean… the man who did it is still up there?” Lestrade’s dark eyes grew wide and alert. “Is that why you stopped the Eye? To trap him there? Sherlock, but what about the other passengers in the cubicle! They are stranded up there with a maniac now!”
“What I don’t get is the reason behind these kamikaze’s actions. What the heck did they expect to find in that hollow crutch? Do you have any idea about that, Sherlock?”
I shouldn’t jump into this in such a gung-ho manner. I should have spoken to him first. But speeches are one area I especially suck at. I am like Ajax, that unhappy warrior who committed suicide under the walls of Troy for the sole reason of not being eloquent enough. I am prepared to do any daring physical task you can bestow on me. Just don’t demand any heartfelt, elegant orations from me.
It was a man around fifty-five, sixty years old, but sleek and fit, looking very active. He possessed a darker skin typical for a Latin race together with milky white hair, which made for an interesting, striking contrast. Similar to Sherlock, he had a thin, oblong face with prominent cheekbones and the thin, nervous, elegant hands. He was clean-shaven and nicely groomed. Pearl-grey, hypnotic eyes glittered under his heavy, half-shut eyelids. His dark suit was cut in a simple style, but it was sewn from a quality material.
Seeing the basket, Sherlock breathed a sigh of relief. He bent down and took it into his hand. Rosalie just mutely looked at him, but she didn't make any effort to prevent him from touching it. The detective lifted up the cloth, checked the contents of the basket carefully and after that he showed me what was inside. The revolver, very dirty and bound with the cord from all sides, rested upon the pile of straw at the bottom of it.
John reciprocates and they are soon engaged in very hot activities there. Sherlock, devious and slippery as an eel, tries to gain an upper hand over John at first, but the soldier anticipates every single one of his strategies in this battle and skilfully manages to overpower him. He gently places Sherlock on his belly and secures both of his arms in a firm grip of his hands. He then mounts Sherlock from behind, eager with anticipation.
“Are you picking mussels?” Sherlock's sleepy voice rasped over him some five minutes later, when he walked back from the edge of the coast, his jeans wet to the knees. “They contain microplastics, you know?”
It was getting better and better. Fuming harshly, I dragged myself and the coffers over, flung them on the wagon-floor and boarded the wain. Then I sat next to the ladder lining the sidewall of the wagon, praying for this hell to be over soon.
“You never would, John.” Sherlock assured me heatedly. “The concrete wall standing behind you would shield you from it.”
“Besides,” a sly grin appeared on Vernet's face, “I have a big surprise for you. Wait until you see – you won't believe the coincidence! So shall we?”
The day verges on midday when those two finally decide to leave their nest of rumpled sheets and pillows all over the place. Thankfully, the bathroom is big enough for two so they can save time, showering together. It's a bit distracting to see Sherlock's fiery silver eyes raking through John's body possessively and John can't declare himself unaffected by the presence of wet and naked Greek demigod standing a mere step away from him, but they finally manage to wash themselves and enter their guest bedroom again to dress before leaving for dinner.
Their kissed roughly, two pairs of firm lips fighting for dominance and as they exchanged hot breaths, John's right hand usurped a place on Sherlock's waist, while the left one furtively travelled down. As his hand palmed the place between the detective's thighs gently, the low chuckle escaped from Sherlock's throat and the tall man put his own hand on his belly…
In that moment a deep, rumbling voice resounded near us: “But I could gladly serve you in that regard, Monsieur Lupin.”
Impromptu morning exercises refreshed Sherlock and he dresses into his designer suit in a flash, fit and keen, bristling with impatient energy. John, who can't keep the pace despite being a soldier, jealously knits his brows and wearily dons on shirt adorned with checkered pattern and his worn out leather jacket.
When we stopped by an unassuming building of Gare de Béziers and Inspecteur Ganimard sprang out of the carriage, guarding the valuable bag like a bulldog, he hurried to the nearest police station right away. Before his departure, he explained that he will try to apply some measures aimed at capturing Lupin there, as soon as possible.
Sherlock cursed loudly and grabbed me by the hand. He then stormed through the bridge like a galloping horse. Having no other choice but to run after him, I followed suit.
Sherlock pierced him with a stern, steely gaze from the side and replied curtly: “Do what is your duty, captain. You will find me at the house of Mr. Vernet if my presence is deemed necessary.”
“Madame Thibaut?” He addressed her deferentially. “You have told me earlier that you were a housekeeper in the house of the deceased. I couldn't help but notice that your employer was a Jesuit. Therefore, may I ask you…”
So the silent treatment on this God-forgotten place continued even here, so it seemed. John was a bit shocked, how resolutely Sherlock refused to share the bedroom and how he opted to stay downstairs on his own, in front of the glowing PC monitor instead. Yet the verdict was final, apparently. He was left on his own.
”Oh, excuse me,” he apologises and smoothly runs away down the stairs. John smiles appreciatively as he watches Sherlock's long thin fingers slipping the purse back into the woman's bag.
I flinched at the mention of Rosalie's name. The outrageous idea flashed through my mind – but I couldn't quite believe it.
When Vernet and Didier re-emerged from inside, carrying two big bags with them, I barely recognised them through the water that got stuck in my eyes. I retreated further into shadows and breathed heavily, trying to calm myself. Thankfully, I managed to somehow mask my disconcertedness in time to see Didier locking the door and handling the keys to the old guy who shuffled deeper into the court with them, leaving us to our own devices. I was therefore able to follow the others in quite a peaceful manner while we returned to the cab.
When Sherlock threw the door to the car open, I reached out for him on impulse and splayed my hand on his chest, exactly over the spot where the old surgical scar lingered, masked by Sherlock’s clothing.
“I saw you at the Eye, you were there. The crutch that almost fell at you from the cubicle – I want it. It is currently somewhere at this man’s office. I don’t care how you get it, just bring it here. And no word to the police or else…”
“Wha…? You..? You don't like that?” Recoiling back, John let him go in a flash, looking at him bug-eyed.
I intended to follow him to the platform, only in a bit more dignified and composed a manner. But in that moment a slender, yet a deceptively strong arm sneaked around my waist, holding me in place and a rough sensuous voice exhaled into my ear: “You are so alluring without that moustache of yours... it's very hard to look at you and abstain from touching you.”
Sherlock looked at us, his whole face shining brightly: “It struck me that the storage place full of plaster antique statues could be an ideal place for hiding such small stones. If these were cast-in into one of the sculptures, it would take an incredibly long time since any stranger would discover them.”
Vernet approached us with the rueful face. He put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder and started to apologise: “Guillaume, I'm so sorry….”
“Have you completely lost your mind?!” I barely restrained myself from grabbing him and shaking some sense into him. “What the heck were you doing up there? Did you want to follow this poor sod into suicide or what??”
I slipped my hand into his covertly and I held it tight. We couldn't kiss there, not in public, but everything we needed to tell each other was expressed in that little, inconspicuous gesture. And so we remained standing on the square side by side and we silently contemplated the picturesque plain of the Orb that stretched into the distance deep beneath us. The pale sunlight of the late October bore on us from high and caressed our shoulders like a lover.
The strangled sound escaped from Sherlock's throat and in the next second, the aggressive red flower of his cock bloomed with the burst of sticky white cum. It came out in a long, rich bursts and its translucent flow painted John's exposed belly like a hot salty varnish.
Sherlock, naked and sated after our lovemaking, laying his curly head on my shoulder. Pliant and trusting as a child, filling me with all kinds of sweet pleasure.
Sherlock, completely immersed into the role of the paranoid detective now, sat down heavily into Anderson’s chair, propped the thyrsus against his desk and pulled the prepared envelope out from his pocket. He handed it to Anderson with a breathless request: “I need to speak with Gaston right away! This abominable thing was delivered to me with the usual correspondence today!”
I shook off my own coat, sat down on the edge of the bed I reserved for myself and I raised my head defiantly, my jaw all stiff and set.
“Well, they came here to admire the beauty of British nature too, I suppose, so…” His voice, muffled with suppressed guffaw, resonated dully.
Sherlock mumbled something under his nose, rambling back and forth on the trottoir next to the bistro, his head bowed to his chest in thought, his hands clasped behind his back. No one dared to approach him, people kept their distance seeing how absent-minded and out of it he is.
The force of the strike wrenched Sherlock’s face to the side. Subsequently, the gorilla holding him twisted his hands behind his back tautly.
“Monsieur Holmes, you did a great service to the people of France today! Words can't convey the gratitude our country bestows at you feet just now! Your immense talent....”
The light-switch crackled somewhere to my right. And just like that, bright light flooded the entire area of the old hall.
Sherlock startled. He blanched as if every drop of blood was drained from his face. He stood straighter after that and his features hardened, the wild blue eyes flashing with a steely flame.
We descended our unceremonious transport and dusted our garments off, eyeing our destination warily.
Persistent, John quickly placed his hand back at its rightful place and protested: “No, no, don't be like that! Just listen to me! Please…”
Unexpectedly, the assembled mob hummed in excitement. I turned my head after the source of the noise….
His member stands at attention all of a sudden, glistening as if freshly oiled. His target, an enticing red orifice placed in marvellous symmetry between two luscious, milky-white buttocks, is still nicely stretched after workout that took place during the night. John doesn't hesitate. He nudges it with his tip, pressing half of his length into it at once.
”The owner of the restaurant is local, served as a postman in the vicinity before opening the business here after retirement. The cook is an Italian, through. Came into UK through Erasmus and ended up marrying a local girl, a daughter of the owner. Saw a lucky chance in joining the business of his English in-laws, since Brighton is full of tourists and a local fare pales in comparison with Italian cuisine. Was successful, put on 20 pounds in three years and had two children with his wife – probably that woman we see in the framed picture over the counter.” Sherlock rattles off a long string of his deductions nonchalantly.
“No, it’s not! Go!” Sherlock yanked me by the hand and continued running along the narrower side of the dock, through the South Sea Street, dragging me behind him. I could not comprehend what he wanted to achieve that way but I didn’t protest and tailed him closely.
Later in the evening, the detective and his doctor are sitting in the portable chairs on the beach strewn with mead-coloured gravel and watch the dark horizon far, far behind the sea. The air is scented with a vernal aroma of an approaching rain. In the twilight, Sherlock is raising his hand again and again, observing a simple, unadorned band of gold stuck on his ring finger with morbid fascination.
My tactic was successful. Before the kiss could reach his mouth, the man turned his head to me in surprise, eyeing me with bewilderment as if he only noticed me right now.
And there went my amorous efforts. Sherlock's head snapped up and he aimed a sharp, threatening gaze in the direction the noise just came from.
Sherlock stood by the parked police-van, disinterested in the proceedings and busily browsed the net, his eyes fixated on the screen of his smartphone.
“The murderer is still up there… in the room!” She whispered dramatically, her lips grey as if they were completely devoid of blood.
At this the man's face brightened and his blank stare transformed into an impish, cheerful expression. He stretched his hand out to me in his customary merry and carefree attitude and he added in English laden with heavy French accent: “Cousin seven times removed, so to say. Nice to meet you, sir.”
Standing on tiptoes, John kissed these soft black daubs and his cheeky fingers once again strayed behind the band of Sherlock's briefs.
Thankfully, Sherlock doesn't let him go. He turns around and takes John into his arms, holding him close. They lay still, nestling against each other and kissing in the pale light of dawn. It feels like eternity.
But this was not necessary, thank God. Because the man shrugged his shoulders with disinterest and continued reading Le Figaro, the slightest hint of contempt and malice apparent in the wavy line of his lips.
Philip shrugged his shoulders and sighed: “She acts like the old Sally we knew. Outwardly, you wouldn’t say anything is amiss. But her hand ….the hand is almost completely useless and it gets no better… you know?”
His knees gave way after that and he sunk limply onto the seat next to mine. This enabled me to observe that magnificent set of engraved gems, adorned with mythological scenes from late Antique, from my vantage point. Their delicate beauty was striking and I was not the least surprised that Ganimard's hand shook feverishly when he caressed them with a careful touch of a miser.
“Oh, finally!” exclaimed Vernet and hopped down from the wagon like an unruly goat-kid. “We will wait here for a while, while Pierre takes my luggage to my place. Follow me, gentlemen!”
Unexpectedly, the door was slammed shut with an excessive force. Keys rattled in the lock hastily, imprisoning us in a studio.
I was up on my feet in a second, pulling my own gun out of my pocket in an instant. Through the open window, I observed how the young rascal leapt through the rocky terrain and tufts of dry grass like a spring lamb, fleeing towards the grey buildings of the nearby homestead which was visible behind the shroud of olive-trees. I took a careful aim... but in that moment a Spanish freight train swished by, covering the entire area in front of me, even the very sky, with rattling brown metal.
“Uh, I’m with the force for twenty years now but I never ever witnessed such zoo before.” Greg resumed a seat in his private cubicle with a deep sigh. Afterwards, he lifted a steaming cuppa from the table and took a soothing sip with deep relish.
Incredible relief raked through my body when I felt his pulse beating strongly and when I ascertained that no bone of his was broken. The injury visible on his chest was only a flesh-wound caused by the shrapnel which pierced Sherlock’s skin in the moment of explosion. We were both incredibly lucky. I thanked all the saints in heaven for such a close shave and I threw Sherlock’s heavy frame over my shoulder, carrying him out to save us both from suffocation.
“Oui.” The girl replied, overpowered by my friend's forceful personality and stammered. “It's Marie… Marie Thibaut.”
Sherlock stared down on me, quite intrigued. His eyes narrowed into slits and his full red lips opened enticingly...
He sat at the edge of the opposite bed, looking utterly devastated and then he lay down unexpectedly, as if all of his strength was sucked out of him at once. He reclined among the duvets motionlessly, faintly trembling with nervous exertion.
“I probably must specify it for you, so listen: it’s between you and him. You will end him or you will never leave this place alive. But consider – wouldn’t that be an enormous waste of your talents? It would, it’s evident. So... aim for the head, all right? Hit him the hardest you can until I tell you to stop. The sooner we have this mess behind us, the better.”
As we left the station, we were greeted by the sight of the hansom cabs nicely lined-up next to the entrance to the building. Mumbling swearwords under my breath I headed off in their direction… then abruptly stopped in my tracks when a loud whistle rang behind my back.
“Irresponsible madness!” I echoed his sentiments, blazing in rage. “The man could be subdued and arrested already if the cubicle was allowed to come down! And the passengers safe! What were you thinking, Sherlock!”
“I was in a bad place then, Sherlock. Everything was still so raw. And… there was the issue of that beating at that time. I didn't trust myself around you yet and I didn't believe you would be interested after all that happened.” John whispered grimly. “But now, after Sherrinford… I mean, what's the point of this damned wavering?”
Greg stared at me as if I had lost my mind. Somewhere in a distance, the sirens of the fire-fighting trucks started blaring in earnest.
Our company reached Vernet's two-storey house placed at Les Allées Paul-Riquet, beautiful tree-lined promenade in the middle of the town.
He caressed my cheek, his touch delicate as the flutter of the butterfly-wings. His fiery lips pressed against my temple next, marking me with a kiss.
Visible shadow of distress flickered in his eyes. He pursed his lips thoughtfully. Yet faced with my fierce determination, he was unable to oppose me. At the end, he leaned against the car-seat and flung his head back, staring at the ceiling grimly. Then he nodded: “All right, we will go together. And now listen to me, John – it is very likely that as we go in, they would grab and subdue us. If that happens, let them. Don’t struggle and yield to them. Will you do that for me?”
He made a sweeping gesture with his hand, preaching to me: “The Thriae, the trio of bee goddesses, gave Apollo the ability to interpret information obtained from signs in nature. Those bees in the form of nymphs were the ones who taught him the art of divination. Possessing their gifts, Apollo was able to actually predict the future and…”
Another object, dark, large and heavy, landed three yards from us with an ominous thud. Unlike the crutch, it never moved after that. I stupidly stared at it, registering the dust covered shoes, unnaturally bent legs, torso crooked to the side, blood-streaked face and wide grey eyes which gazed glassily at me from among the mess.
“Dieu!” The Frenchman screamed in outrage. “Is there something you cannot deduce before it actually happens? There goes the surprise! And I believed you will be so astonished to meet your old mentor again! What a pity! How do you cope with this all the time, Doctor Watson?”
The door was positioned just a few steps from the heating stove where this cruel tragedy has occurred. It was left slightly ajar and the darkness visible in its gap only revealed to me that no lamp has been lit in the room situated behind it. This and the fact that I heard no sounds coming from its direction was the reason I originally dismissed it as unimportant.
The men surrounding us laughed uproariously. Our main torturer took stand by the counter to enjoy the show and his gorillas resumed the place at their seats in the open area to my left with similar intent.
Sherlock looked at me helplessly like a deer caught in a snare of the cunning poacher and he lifted his shoulders in a gesture of resignation. He then turned to the exit from the platform, being led along by Vernet who called nonchalantly over his shoulder: “My valise is there on the bench, Doctor Watson! Merci beaucoup!”
The letter was battered and badly creased but still nicely readable. It was written in the heavy masculine hand and it depicted the plan of Arnaud's suicide to the minute detail, leaving no doubt about the true course of events in our minds. It figures that Arnaud had still a modicum of conscience in him – he gave Rosalie the letter in case she would be caught with the revolver in her hands to protect her from the possible accusation of murder. Thankfully, he never mentioned the fact that Authié is a Cathar in it. In his dementia he only referred to Authié as “the hell spawn” and so the letter could be later used to acquit Authié of the crime.
I squeezed the cup in my fingers tightly and bowed my head. We drunk out tea in tense silence after that and the long minutes stretched into eternity until Sherlock liberated me from the unpleasant situation by peeking into the kitchen and announcing that he is finished.
No one else boarded the first class. The train was a bit delayed and so after a little while a sharp sound of conductor's whistle rang outside and with that we were on the move again.
But sooner than this situation gradated into such a dramatic end, Vernet flew inside and jumped among the gendarmes with flailing hands.
“Hello, Mister Holmes, hello, Doctor Wilson. You came to welcome me into my new home? How very nice of you! Don't you want to join me, by the way? There's a plenty of space inside.”
Gnashing my teeth, I plucked the smelly cancer-stick from his lips and stomped on it angrily. Sherlock, unpleasantly awakened from his movie-star impersonation by that act, sullenly frowned down on me.
Still, I trusted Sherlock to reject this nuisance right away in his cold and haughty manner. I keenly observed his eyes peering intently at the man from the shadow cast by the visor of the deerstalker. I saw them widen and darken – in outrage, I supposed – and as his lips opened, my stomach shivered in joyful anticipation of a harsh, cutting speech…
“I'm sorry.” I whispered ruefully. “I didn't mean to make such a scene. In a way I'm glad that you are so protective of your former lover. I wouldn't like it one bit if you abandoned him to his fate. It's just… I felt so insecure when I realised you were once intimate with him. Like I should lose you to him.”
“John!” Sherlock's strained voice carried a note of warning this time and the rhythmical movements of his hips slowly gave way to erratic spasms.
And in a state of near panic, he undid his zip and started to tear down his belt, trying to get out of his trousers as quickly as possible. He kept cursing the innocent bivalve with gusto, while John flung back his head and laughed uproariously.
I reached the pair in but the two swift long steps and placed my hand firmly on the shoulder of the Frenchman.
“Really?” Sherlock shook off his hand swiftly, his one word loud and harsh like the rumble of the clarion.
Sherlock stared at me with the annoyingly clear eyes, probably at a loss for words. Finally, he shrugged his shoulders: “Is it such a big deal for you that I was a Cathar, John? Why does that bother you so much? You know that as the members of the Established Church of England we would be considered heretics here anyway.”
The cabbie gave us a responding cry and prodded the horses into a swift ride, turning around and taking the corner into a busy nearby street leading to the old bridge across the river Orb.
“You intrigue me.” He announced after that and produced a cigarette out of his pocket, his playful long fingers twirling it around. “Well, don't you think the thief is very happy now that they consider him a subject worthy of the attention of the celebrated English detective? Just consider what pleasure it would be for him to best the rival of these qualities!”
The train moved slowly in between, a train crew trying to move the train from its position among fields and olive groves into the more savoury area of Gare de Béziers.
Sherlock just mumbled something inaudible, tucked his scarf more tightly around the lower part of his face and stepped further into the darkness.
But in the next second, he was composed and cold like ice once again. He halted in front of Sherlock and addressed him in the mellow, friendly tone that was so fake it forced me to shudder.
“Thirty-three hours,” Sherlock says. He stretches out his upper back, looking decidedly feline. John goes and opens the curtains.
to me because I might have a love interest? He's talking to me because it's about me, and now that's just
He realizes that must have sounded pathetic, or threatening, or both. "I mean you shouldn't leave Baker Street," he explains. "You've been away long enough as it is. I'll find someplace else to sleep."
“Mycroft,” John says, the warning in his tone flat and useless. He doesn’t want to hear these things. He wants Sherlock to be dead.
“That he was protecting you for a reason.” Mycroft moves to go, face set. “The same reason, I’d say, that you are shelved away here in quiet Baker Street, while he makes abstract art and gets fondled by Irene Adler in west London. Don’t make an idol out of my brother, Doctor Watson. He will never live up to it again.”
He treats people now, a couple hours a day in some clinic Mycroft has easily found for him. There would have been a time when he would rue Mycroft’s interference, when he would do anything and everything to shake off the brotherly yoke and do things on his own for his own good. But John feels tired, and he sees no point in argument; he figures that he cannot spend all his time with Sherlock since they do not live together, and figures that the less time is spend dawdling in his bedsit the better, and uses his hours at the clinic as a short respite in which he gathers his thoughts and tries to clear his body. It is mostly for naught, as he thinks about Sherlock most of the day anyway, and now he has two versions of Sherlock to contemplate. He finds himself thinking of the more recent more often.
“Don’t lie, it doesn’t suit you,” John says, one corner of his mouth quirking up in some agitation, but most of him seems to have sunk back into himself, as if he’s only a quarter present with Sherlock.
him. A preemptive attack seems prudent. Blithely pirouetting around the table, fuck, he's good, John prepares his strike and smacks Sherlock's thigh. Fish slice - one, Holmes - zero. Sherlock squeaks, shielding his arse from further insult. "Head to the barracks, Holmes," the Captain snaps, "get cracking!" The private wails as John ruthlessly goads him on using the spoon. For once in his life, Sherlock does as he's ordered.
fairly stimulating." Sherlock catches John low chuckle. "Alright," the captain smirks, "I'll confess. Your deductions get me hot. Like very hot. Hell, Holmes, half the time I'm with you on a case I'm fending off a stiffy."
Despite his posture radiating shame, Private Holmes also appears a wee bit pleased with himself. He's being incendiary towards his Captain on purpose. "Sir?"
"Fine, I'll concede, if only to figure out your motives." He strides over to the desk in three imperious steps, swiping a small, blunted pencil out from the litter smothering its surface. Sherlock spins, dressing gown swirling around his stork-like legs before settling. "Here, catch, why don't you." He hurls the stub like a javelin thrower during the final heat of an Olympics' qualifier.
” John says, and Sherlock wonders if he is stupid as well, as his name really doesn’t have to be said so many times in one conversation. “That’s – ”
“Yes. A little.” Sherlock seems to have lost most all his inhibitions. He’s almost in a different world, talking with John like this about such intimate things. “I want to invade, John. I want to latch on to things.”
John sighs, then bunches part of his fist into Sherlock’s crusted gown. The move is planned and awkward. “I don’t even know what we’re discussing anymore.”
John feels overwhelmed with Sherlock’s acuity. This is insight into human nature that he can’t imagine old Sherlock ever possessing, but apparently he did possess it, stowed into some remote corner of his brain where it would be stifled by intellectualisms. “That,” he begins.
John's eyes flickered to the man standing behind them. "It's over now." The words seemed to have been meant for both brothers, but Mycroft didn't look like he was listening.
“She thought that if you put yourself in harm’s way I’d ... I’d rescue you or something. But I didn’t – not ’til she told me to.” Me again, but not centrally. That's a definite
He nods. From a certain angle John's face looks very round to Sherlock, which he supposes he must have once found attractive, but the thought is quickly replaced by an indescribable certainty that old Sherlock did not think of John's face at all, he thought of John. Sherlock does his best to look past the chin and the mushed nose and forehead lines, and all he comes up against is a sparse, sustained coldness. Confused by this insight, he pushes against John's body.
"Have you sussed out my plan of attack, dear Private?", the captain purrs, five feet to Sherlock's right.
Sherlock waits. And, he waits. Good Christ, how he waits, chewing on his tongue. As luck would have it, sinking spirits abort his usual sense of boredom.
And, I'm not done posting for the night! Give me another hour and I'll post again. I get paranoid that I'll accidentally delete a chapter if I mess around with it too long.
"Why yes, Private, yes you did," John spits, sounding venomous. "You are undeniably taking the piss, soldier. Enough with the simpering. I don't like it. In point of fact, your pathetically scripted sweet-talk is making me very,
pleased. He watches Sherlock sits, knees pressed together, bony arms folded tightly across his chest. His lover is breathing far faster than circumstances warrant. To John, Sherlock resembles a very small boy deflating in front of the headmaster's desk - awaiting corporal punishment via paddle.
Sherlock's two remaining brain cells stand up, and step to. He's been granted permission to speak. "Yes, Sir! Right away, Sir! I...forgive me," he blurts, sounding small and vulnerable. "I was momentarily struck dumb by your...er...impressive display of authority. Captain Watson, Sir, I swear to you that I'm 100% intent on honouring the QD code."
"And Sir, if it was windy, if you blew air on me - Agghh!" John does just that, never one to back down from a challenge. Lips pursed, he blows a steady stream of warm air down Sherlock's flanks, along the length of his spine. "Huunghh...I'd grow chilled and develop goose bumps, Sir. Perhaps I'd shiver, a direct response to the temperature dichotomy."
annoyed." He shifts in silently, shoe soles muffled by the carpet. Sherlock tries not to squirm, John's trousers indifferently chafing his bum. "What's next, Private," Watson hisses straight into his lover's ear, "an offer to spit-polish my boots with your tongue?"
"Private?" Captain W. snaps, nails clawing at that sinfully plump, gorgeous arse. He sinks his fingers down into Sherlock's moist crack, applying a small amount of force, as per usual. The detective's arse crack is pressed so tight between his cheeks that it could probably hold a hardback Collin's Dictionary. This time the private anticipates pain. He holds his position, keen on pleasing the captain.
"Now, come closer - oh for God's sake, John. Please come here, and look at the state of my penis. Granted, it's softened due to the current lack of sexual stimulation, but take a look, and in your professional opinion, tell me what you see." John risks it. He slides closer. He takes a good look, as requested, as a physician well-versed in anatomy. The penis in question is dark pink, three-quarters erect, and perhaps, perhaps...seems a little
John's small hand strikes out, cupping around the detective's long neck. Sherlock can't breath. Hell, he can't even swallow, a massive swell of fear clogging his throat. "Listen, you over-tall toddler. I'm tired of your whingeing, and frankly ridiculous demands. For once in your bloody life,
"No! No. Nothing like that," the doctor hedges, the sentence ending in a squeak. Appalled, John struggles to re-establish authority. He growls in annoyance, though for what reason, Sherlock isn't clear. His flatmate clears his throat, and then clears it again. He hawks into his fist one final time, for good measure. "No. I just forgot something. There's a proper etiquette when people engage in, well, what we're engaging in." The doctor's hand loosens against his lips, muffling an exhalation that's not quite a cough.
of a much-maligned biro against newsprint. He presses hard into the paper, to no effect. The pen is nearly out of ink.
I had a few minutes to sit and write interrupted. The term "social distancing" doesn't mean squat when you're in healthcare. I am working fifty-nine hours this week and need a bit of fantasy to clear my mind. Saying that, this chapter probably won't be great. I'm throwing it out there without editing...mental vomit, if you will. Also, it is again very short. Posting is something to do to prevent from going completely wacko. It's the only way I can think of to spit in the eye of the pandemic. Fuck you, Covid-19, and the unfortunate mammal you rode in on.
John snorts, "I doubt that, I feel a right mess." He taps Sherlock's shins, who understands and lowers his legs. John plunges in, eating at Sherlock's mouth. The genius opens up, his lover's tongue dominating him, invading his mouth. They tangle tongues, rutting desperately cock-to-cock. "Fucking hell, luv, that's...
John has no fucking clue of what to do next. True, his madman hasn't safe-worded, but what of it? What does it signify? Surely, Sherlock's not afraid of John, petrified of being injured (more). Bugger, what if Sherlock actually
I see my knees slipping and unable to find purchase on the leather." It's true, the man keeps slipping, sodden leather producing trumping sounds as he moves.
Okay, let's all pretend that "slickery" is a word, just for today. And just for kicks, check this link out - but only if you're not British, but just want to be. Sorry, I don't know how to make something all fancy so that you can just click on it and go to the web page. You're going to have to copy and paste.
"Ah, you sweet brilliant maniac, you'll take what I give; no more, no less," John growls, struggling to keep pace with his lover's flailings. "Dear me." He's forced to bellow to cancel out Sherlock's squeals and booming laughter. "Precisely how many clots - men and woman alike - have been held spellbound, swooning after one look of your gorgeous cheekbones?" John gives up the chase to nip and pinch at Sherlock's bum. "Yet apparently you can be subdued by the power of one paltry poultry feather."
The detective pulls inward, scrubbing at his nose with his knuckles. Sentiment is far too fucking exhausting a concept, and besides, Sherlock's nails are cut to the quick. He tastes blood.
Captain Watson sniffs. "Still, I am not a sentimental man, or prone to romantic ideals; and as such, I'm delighted to carry out the injunction when necessary. Do you understand?"
Vague noises ring through the ether, the sounds of gurgling water and the shriek of an electric kettle on full-boil. Sherlock detects the clink of a - yes, clearly - bent metal teaspoon intersecting with a ceramic drinking vessel - circa 2000, clearly not from Stoke on Trent. Chipped, with two - no three, yes three partial cracks running the handle, one in need of imminent repair. Got it - RAMC mug.
Watson grunts an affirmative. Sherlock extends his appreciation to what's basically a mixed bag of false deities. The detective
Small sounds are large sounds when it's silent. A snick, nay, a click; a flip-top cap being popping open. It's domestic, intimate, one personal to the flat, and..
it, this potentiality - first as heat, transformed to kinetic, finally morphing into chemical ascendancy. Sherlock quivers, overwhelmed, drown in the will of his captain. John infiltrates his lover's cells through osmosis, suspended between Sherlock's atoms like a bomb. It's an overabundant wealth of potential, this conviction. John has power. John
"This is it? Let me help you out, you poor dear." John skips to his chest of drawers, an atrocity of design. John skips. He sodding skips. "Here you go, Private," he coos. "Now pay attention."
Faced with dead air, Sherlock scrambles to deduce the likeliest motive for John's silence. Yet, the situation's too weird, and John's intentions too nebulous to postulate. The genius tells himself that he's probably fucked. There's nothing for it but to continue. He much prefers the flat full of sound. "The effrontery on my part was unintentional, Captain, Sir. Captain," Christ, but he's dithering. "I've only been in the company one day, Sir, still wet behind the ears, Sir, inexperienced. In point of fact," his voice lightens, "being so green might lean in your favour."
"Hmmm?" This is not the direction John anticipated Sherlock to go. Frankly, he's having difficulty keeping up, what with that mesmerising voice and that
Sherlock always, and forever gets his way. It's child's play, really, for the manipulative bastard. Deduce, seduce, then reduce John's desires to trivial tripe.
Sherlock flails about in search for John's phone until he finds it, punching in the simple pass code. He blanches, shock belaying an ear-splitting yawn.
Sherlock's distraction over his flailing arse cheeks makes for easy entry. John moves in, creeping until he's poised and looming over his target.
This work has perhaps the longest foreplay scene in the whole BBC Sherlock fandom. Well, finally, here it is, folks...the beginning of the sex scene that should have come 20k ago.
Every molecule, every atom, each particle of air, is promptly expelled from Sherlock's lungs. He gasps, and sputters, and heaves. Sherlock squeaks out a protest, "Holy...
" Sherlock hears John swallow, the slight hush of air as something pushes through it, and the smack on his arse stings so sweetly that the high immediately following it is worthy of the gods.
Sherlock's skin shimmers, fine beads of moisture dotting his flesh. It's riveting. Droplets swell, and break, and trickle down the dip in his back. Sweet Christ, the man's damn near sparkling, lit within by liquid crystalline fairy lights. John's mouth waters imagining the sweet briny sweat on his tongue. Licking Sherlock. Tasting Sherlock. Simply eating him all up with a spoon.
Watson gloats for one sweet second, then sucks in air. At the top of his lungs, he barks, "Soldier!" Sherlock jolts, muscles contracting as if electrified. He comes very close to bashing his head into John's face. Luckily, the captain chose a flanking manouevre. His clever foresight spared two white incisors and Sherlock's skull.
funny, with my funny little brain and low IQ. How little you must care, soldier, for your captain." Sherlock's lips refold themselves from smirk to straight line at the words. "I am here to inform you," John seethes, "you vain, self-centred tit, you've compromised our company's morale."
Unable to stop himself, Sherlock twists. He needs to see the expression in John's eyes, completely forgetting about the damnable blindfold. Is John still playing the game? "As you were, soldier!" John bawls. "You were ordered to stay still, and you will do so!" A little freaked out by his lover's ferocity, Sherlock complies, wobbling slightly on tired knees. He  feels disorientated in more ways than one. The genius deems it best not to speculate. Insufficient data. A bit not good, that.
John almost believes him. He stands, eyeing the genius for long minutes, and shakes his head. "Right. Good to continue?"
The pain snaps the detective out of his delicious, lust-filled haze. He jerks back in blank shock with a grunt. This isn't how things normally go. Even more distressing than John's behavior is that John is not letting go. Point of fact, he's tightening his hold and is ferociously
"Sherlock, stop," John says, pulling away from those kiss-swollen lips with regret. "Stop it now. Keep your body still for me and open up your ears. I have something to say."
"Ah. Apologies, Captain," Sherlock chokes out, "that was an inappropriate choice of metaphor, to say the least. If you would please be so kind as to delete it, I'd be ever in your debt. What I'm trying to get at, Sir, albeit in a painfully delivered way, is that I've been handed a fortuitous opportunity." Blanching, Sherlock shouts, "Damn it! I did it for a second time, didn't I? Sir. Captain Watson. Sir"
"I expect an answer when I put forth an inquiry, soldier." The captain sneers. Sherlock's eyes widen in lusty agitation, watching John's nostrils flare rapidly. Repeatedly. He commencing to bawls out a string of orders without pause. This prevents the Private from offering that duly wonted reply. "On your feet!"
Checkmate: basically, an attack on a king that can't be defended. Declaring checkmate is the same as saying "I win".
"Never mind, Holmes," the captain snorts, "not important. No, what I really want from you is deduction. Deduce what I'm seeing right now, the spectacle of sex spread before me. It's a job worth the effort, Private, I promise."
In the slight pause between John's huffing breath, sharp slap, and his own rapturous wail, Sherlock smirks.
What is the meaning of this travesty?" Sherlock bellows, indignantly slamming the pocket door into its slot. He stands, chest heaving and pink-cheeked, in the doorway. John licks his thumb, looks down at his lap, and casually flips to the crossword. Sherlock's eyes narrow into ill-humored slits. "John? I asked you a question. I believe I deserve an explanation," he snorts. "At the very least, I expect an apology."
I know I know I know! This is way pathetically short. My mom is in the hospital and I have no idea when I will next have time to write. I wanted to post the smidgeon of what I had so that you wouldn't think I'd abandoned the story.
Through dint of will and tapping into three years of military discipline John pulls his gaze off Sherlock's erection.
"What do you want, Captain?" The private's gone nasal, a bit like Anderson. "Do have the courtesy to indulge my curiosity
Sherlock's head now cocks to the right, at a precise 35° angle. Stress-induced sweat has dampened his hair, soft curls twisting into dreadlocks. Limp chestnut fringe drapes alluringly over one eye. "Curious. Even if your formative years weren't a strong enough influence on etiquette, three years in the army have certainly defined your sense of social decorum. What," his eyes squint even tighter, "in God's name is going on?"
. He's flailing, hips bucking, looking frantic as a fish out of water. Eventually, and after a fair bit of grunting, Sherlock flips over and faces the fireplace. A deluge of cool air bathes his forehead, so refreshing. A line of light peeks up from under the blindfold. Crunching noises, serviette in the bin.
"Don't annoy me with stock protestations." John snarls, fighting the desperate urge to rub off. "Shite, you pillock, you've gone and interrupted my train of thought. Wait. Ah, yes," he dares move a bit nearer. "Deductions. Yes. Carry on."
"Nnngh...", Sherlock mumbles, needing to catch his breath lest he pass out. Well, that was cruel...he was ambushed! Each poke, every tickle a yawning crack in his composure. "Yes, Sir! Sorry, Sir!" he snivels like the sad sap he's become.
Limbs flying, Sherlock's thrashing side-to-side. He's a panicked turtle flipped upon his back, crazed in an overwhelming paroxysms. He's blind and deaf to John's eureka moment, which the captain realises simply won't do. John spies his chance and traps Sherlock, hands vice-like around his ankles. "I told you to be still, man. For shame." The captain clears his throat. "I
"Uhhh," Sherlock bumbles. "Sorry, Sir. I'm unsure of what precise information you're seeking." He shifts awkwardly, knees beginning to ache.
he says?" John fumbles around his coat pocket. "A joke. Yeah, well, I'm sure you had a bloody lark infiltrating the CCTV cameras. Here." He tosses Sherlock a handful of linked chain.
"Your ploy might possibly be considered tenable, if you'd not wasted company time squawking like a chicken. You, that bloody simpering, the flouncing around in your poncy, public school coat. You, sulking in the fla- barracks, wrapped in that froofy, peacock blue dressing gown."
Sherlock loves it, John's cock. He worships John's penis as if it were a separate entity - a holy relic John deigns to share, with unworthy mortals such as he. "Joh..." Sherlock sucks in a breath. "John. John, Christ in heaven you're so good."
He looks at his brother’s left temple, shot gray with coming age. He has spent so long in here watching Mycroft or Irene or Mycroft that these things look sharp and specific to him, luminescent in a deep, thick water that feels like his brain shrinking over itself.“Then I died,” he says.
“What?” Better to let him get it off his chest if he has so much to say. What exactly does he think she is? Maybe he'll just go on and say it openly. Say he thinks she's magnificent, or that she'll be good for me, or that we could be lovers, that I'm lying – no, he's not built up to that, I should be thinking more clearly – something of that sort nevertheless.
“It's okay.” That's very weak, I hadn't planned on saying that but it just sort of slipped out. I can do something better, something I feel to my bones should be good: I'll put my left hand on his arm, my right on his back – that one's slid quite naturally up to his neck, the other to his shoulder. I'm holding him and nothing's ever felt just this right or this devastating to me before. My robe's getting wet, it must be uncomfortable for him to put his face in the fabric, I'll lead his face up to my collar and hold him there. It's overwhelming, it's overwhelming. My chest's aching, John. It's aching like mad.
when.” His eyes are getting moist, I should look away in a moment. “That’s all it was, just texting.” Now's a good time to do so. I don't like seeing him like this, but I'd look forever if it would make a difference – I just know it won't. “But I wanted more.” If only he knew how natural I find all of this business, if only he felt it as acutely as I do. Is dream-Mary making him feel it? I'll look at his face again, try and see what's going on. “And d’you know something? I still do. I’m not the man you thought I was; I’m not that guy. I never could be. But that’s the point. That’s the whole point.” I'm overwhelmed with tenderness. John's going to cry, I know it, his expression is wonderful in every sense of the word – I've never really seen anything like it. “Who you thought I was ... is the man who I
“Loved?” Sherlock mutters, almost unconsciously, then points out quickly, “I didn’t tell you to shoot the cabbie.”
Irene arrives, serene and luminous. She scatters her things all over the flat, which John has figured out she does to comfort Sherlock, and settles next to him on the sofa to touch the sole of his foot. Sherlock is unresponsive.
It is not Irene’s place to answer. But she says yes, because Sherlock looks a little less lost than he usually does, and Sherlock smiles a real huge smile which is not vacuous, so Irene thinks it is enough to see him do this. His face is a joy to look at. She brings him food, which he eats decently and without too much complaint, and then Irene calls Mycroft and tells him what she has done.
“No clever come-back?” Yeah, I was a bit too wrapped up in my head to form a reply; I'm sorry, John, I'll just let you talk. “I cheated on you, Mary.” Are you talking to yourself now? Oh, I see what's going on, that's understandable. Must have been lonely in that big house. It's very good for him to open up about it this way, it'll be much better for dream-Mary to forgive him than for me to try the same; it's actually very brave of him to do it, too, to face his wife like this. “There was a woman on the bus, and I had a plastic daisy in my hair. I’d been playing with Rosie. And this girl just smiled at me.” It's disconcerting for him to be so open in front of me, but I don't mind at all, so the word was wrong actually and it's just unusual for him to do this. I hope I don't look like I'm paying rapt attention, it's his moment with another person after all. “That’s all it was; it was a smile.” Now I have to look at his face, I'm afraid of the tone he's taken. I don't feel good about this at all. “We texted constantly. You want to know when? Every time you left the room, that’s when. When you were feeding our daughter; when you were stopping her from crying –
Sherlock whimpers whilst John's fingers exit his body. He hears a gloopy squishing of lubricant. "Remove the blindfold?" Sherlock pleads, "I want to see your face." The smaller man obliges him, late afternoon gloom bright after the dark. His John is flush-faced, nearly wrecked, a gratifying fact. "Yes, thank you. You look...nice."
Sherlock's cock hardens further, vital fluids pooling in the apex of his groin. It remains a mystery, physiologically speaking, as to why his cheeks can still burn; cheekbones flushing with blood, incandescently pink. John's gaze judders, tripping downwards. His pupils dilate  incrementally into blue-black pools of want. Sherlock would sink and drown if he looked long enough. John's eyes continue dashing about, until they don't. They stutter, slamming to a halt at vision of his lover's impressively tented trousers. He licks his lips. Sherlock follows in kind.
Sherlock finger-combs through mats whilst scrunching and fluffing up his curls. He'd make a fool of himself stumbling about to find the loo.
Sherlock stands, transfixed. He goggles in stupefied wonder at this odd tableau unfolding before him. "John?" he murmurs, shaking his head like a dog after its bath - or a man recovering from concussion. Destroyed slides and ruined experiments are no longer of any concern to this conceited, string-bean of a man. Sherlock's jaw belatedly drops to the floor. He feels like a bird held frozen in the cold, lidless glare of an asp.
"Pick a word that's easy to remember, but not something that comes up in everyday conversation, say, 'microscope'." John grins. "That might get awkward, if you catch my meaning. It is a commonly used word in the flat."
His partner, whilst no athlete, is able-bodied and healthy. Sherlock hares through London with the ease of a cheetah hunting a gazelle. John tots up the numbers and is troubled.
Sherlock howls, stomping heavily to John's chair. The action become somewhat superfluous once his feet march across the thick oriental carpet. If the detective was a character from a children's programme, plumes of smoke would be pouring out both ears. "John. This affectation of yours is unfathomably rude. I never put up with such blatant impertinence, and I certainly won't tolerate it from you!" Sherlock aims, flipping a slightly bent biro in the direction of John's lap. It smacks against the newspaper with a pop.
"One," Captain Watson gives a hard yank to the willful squadie's locks. "You conduct grossly unsanitary and ill-considered experiments
"In the mood for Chinese tonight, or curry?" John muses, delighted at the direction this is going. He still hasn't turned to face his lover. "I'm feeling a bit peckish this evening." The little releases a gentle sigh, barely audible above Sherlock's agitated huffs.
"Look how brilliant you are," he murmured. "So bright, so painfully isolated. All alone in the sky." He knew from Eurus' mouth-tremor that this smaller prediction had been right, which was worth the exhausting monologue. "I can bring you home, Eurus." The words settled like lead in his throat and breastbone. "I'm just an idiot but I can bring you home."
How would I say this politely? I don't want to scare him off, he'll have to guess at my meaning. I don't want to give him a long-winded speech, he's already tense and very much in pain, but if I don't at least manage an introduction now I'll never get over it. “Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice. I have known many people in this world but made few friends, and I can safely say ...” That you are the best man, the most extraordinary man of all, that you've touched me in a way I never thought possible. That I know the exact nature of the change you've been talking of all this time, and have experienced it in all its forms under your two tight hands. Give me a moment to speak and I'll say all of these things to you, I swear I'll say them only to you, John – “I cheated on her.”
The shot rang out through the room with a devastating crack. For a moment Sherlock wondered if his finger had been too quick on the trigger, considered absently how long it should take him to die now. But that was wrong. There was no blood, no pain; the gun was just as taut, ready to fire, his hand crooked properly to shoot. The thoughts flitted through his head with record speed in the few seconds it took for John to fall.
John places his saucer carefully on the table, he places his cup carefully on the table, he stacks them up very neatly and looks back at his companion. Sherlock is not feeling well in the head. He has curled into a ball on the far end of the couch and does not speak when addressed; John is having a hard time feeding him.
Victor and the silence after, slouching through the house in the cold. Mycroft's hard orders had been slick over his spine and earline, their relations growing tenser and tenser as Sherlock became a man. He blinked, slowly, the sensations drifting apart like oil; at the center of it all there remained a hard kernel of flesh, the quick intent face of his younger sister.
The night slinks over them. At first John does not interfere with Sherlock’s brooding, he does unremarkable things and resents himself, but the time comes when he cannot ignore anything any longer because he simply can’t, his body won’t stop wanting to do things and he, himself, can’t stop wanting them to be good. He busies himself with comforting Sherlock, and once the menial tasks are finished he brushes a thumb or two over Sherlock’s warm forehead. Sherlock shies away from the touch, and John is irresistibly reminded once again of a newborn foal as he looks at him. Even his skin is softer, thinner from months kept inside.
"He's mine as well," Sherlock says. "If you're going to miss him, we can know him together. It's not fair for me not to really remember him."
"Come down," he says. Sherlock looks surprised, but he does so. "You can – put your head, on my lap, if you want. You know. Or – " His voice feels rough, sheathed in all the night in the car and the smooth shimmer of the city behind them. "Or put your back, like this, in my chest – "
“It was – Sherlock, were you being sentimental?” That sounds borderline rude, but John’s too surprised.
He most definitely thinks I'm clueless about love. John, you repressed sod, you're not High Wycombe, you're my bloody London and that's as poetic as I can get about a person. I am perfectly equipped to understand and I don't care about High Wycombe, because my understanding facilities are sufficiently evolved to comprehend a much better place. I'll hint at that, and I'll do it petulantly; I think I'm pouting anyway so it won't be hard. “I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.”
“Is it?” she asks mildly. Sherlock nods, a vague gesture, and rubs his foot against the cushions like an uncomfortable child. She speaks to him as if he were a child, sometimes, but still gives him wine, and once even bent down to pleasure the soft, heavy sag of his right earlobe. He reacted enthusiastically, she remembers, but even that had had a very odd, saccharine innocence about it. She hadn’t liked being with a man as slow as he had been, in the head, but very much enjoyed speaking to one, so they’ve kept up an unlikely attachment in which she comes and finds him in his decadent flat, and hammers him with words while he moves through various states of undress and drunkenness. They don’t touch, except when Irene curls her fingers through his hair, or when he’s fascinated enough with the pearly smoothness of the skin of her arm that he strokes it peculiarly for minutes on end.
to make it. Premise: Sherlock Holmes is incomplete without a romantic interest. Observation: Sherlock Holmes devastates his mind and body in the absence of John Watson, who has recently gotten married to Mary Morstan and is definitely Not Available. Observation Two: Sherlock Holmes devastates his mind and body in the absence of John Watson, who blames Sherlock Holmes for the death of his wife and is
“I don’t know. I think he did.” Irene seems to be thinking about something, but he can’t figure out what it is, so he asks “Where is he now?” as neutrally as possible.
Eurus was pale and walked with a stutter, her movements far from lithe. She stood to face Sherlock now, the two steps between them their only real distance. She had entered through some door on the left, careful, sliding like a hyena against the walls; Sherlock thought the effect had been breathtaking.
dangerous – trust you to fall for a sociopath ... ” John, can we move on from this? Your basic premise is wrong, I've not fallen for her, therefore there is nothing I am failing to appreciate, therefore I am not cold and ignorant, therefore I do understand why you are hurting, therefore I am honoring Mary's memory just as you are, and as an extra I am fully romantically Open. That's about the shape of it. And he must realize he's being hypocritical, he just described his ex-wife – I at least do not consider myself dangerous. I go looking for such people, yes, and I do deal with such situations, but does the word apply to me? I could never in a million years be dangerous to John. Well, I have been, but that's a Bad Thought so I'm Moving On. “But she's...you know...” He's still talking about her, so I think we should both be moving on by now.
The drive home is a good push push push through John’s lumbar curve. It is a flitting-between the golden pools of street-lanterns, the thrum of the car a very old memory that he only once enjoyed, carousing through the countryside at sixteen in myriad forbidden getaways. Even before he was a shut-in John did not drive, he paid unreal amounts for cabs and watched people’s nostrils flare and sink like jellyfish in the wan tube-light; this is Mrs. Hudson’s car and he is pleased that she has pushed him to take it out home. “Bring it back tomorrow,” she’s said, and John has heard all she has not said and taken it without complaint. He weaves in and out through patches of asphalt darkness where he is headed far away from home, which is far too close to be returned to, and only pulls in with a slick hiss when the night becomes flat with dust, the stars less like jewels as he slides the door behind him.
. And obsession is something Sherlock recognizes and can be comfortable with, so he nibbles back because obsession is good and easy, and they end up stroking whole bodies against each other.
They have dinners where John eats and Sherlock pretends to eat and they both pretend, sometimes, that there’s nothing to say to each other. There’s always something to say to each other. Sherlock says it more often than John ever will, because he’s cold and untouchable and John just has pits in his brain. But it’s Sherlock so he knows. Of course, of course he knows.
Sherlock seems bothered by the whole affair, but he doesn't argue when John packs. When John leaves he is sitting on the sofa watching the dented wall. The flat feels cleaner.
"Don't be dull, he's quite safe." Sherlock had taken hold of the white-clad man, angry that he was still there, but Eurus looked bored. "I admit it would've been a nice touch, but unnecessary; he's more useful alive. Besides, it didn't help the last time."
"Maybe," he answers truthfully. "To be honest it's very hard to tell. He was never the most demonstrative, but I think he would have enjoyed something like this, and wouldn't have had to trivialize it out of confusion."
John sucks in a breath. Sherlock stops. John tugs harder on his hair and Sherlock’s lips fall open, closing tightly around his skin, the webbing of John’s hand, as John yields his entire left palm to Sherlock’s attentions. He realizes he is not very present in the moment, whereas Sherlock’s eyes are sharper than he has seen them for a long time. His canines drag over John’s skin in long, jagged burns. John groans. Sherlock turns his head to meet his eyes, damnfully lucid, and the look exchanged is clear and beautifully gray, and in the end John leans into kiss him, very gently – he is pressing his mouth against his. Then he sits down next to him, gathers his long legs into his lap, and proceeds to talk to him about useless things.
He paints, sometimes, using long wide strokes of the brush over large, white canvas, the colors burning into the back of his mind. Sherlock frowns sometimes, cocks his head, tries to really understand why they look that way, but it always evades him. And he doesn’t like frowning. So he stops.
“At least it’s a mild toleration,” Sherlock encourages him. “It’s not bad, or anything. It’s different. I like it.”
, it's difficult to weasel out of a marriage when it's only just happening with the sole purpose of attaching yourself to the best man, even if the particular occasion sheds light (a light you must realize the best man sees) on a possible homosexual relationship between you and a military acquaintance, casting the necessary doubt on your sexuality for the best man to be even more glaringly Available. That's difficult. But my conclusion stays put: He wouldn't bother questioning whether I am available now because he has absolutely no self-interest in the matter – the man's wife is dead and I've practically killed her, I'll have hit some new lows on his Attraction List. Bad thought: Moving on. So is he interested then in my opinion of Irene Adler? That's weak, he knows what I think: I think she's bloody brilliant. I remember I pretended to think she was alive and safe in America while John thought I thought this only because he'd told me so and also that she was really dead, because Mycroft had told him to tell me this even though he knew I knew she wasn't dead because I'd saved her, so the whole thing was really fooling John into thinking that he was sparing my feelings by telling me a woman he thought I loved was not dead even though he thought she was dead, and all the while I knew exactly where and just how alive she was because I'd been part of the whole thing. I realize now that this is the first time since that day that John has had occasion to hear from her: Oh, dear, now he knows that she's alive and Mycroft had been lying, and will have deduced that he'd only have been lied to in that manner (being made to think he was doing me a favor) to really convince
The genius groans at the implication; and then he's panting, ragged and desperate. Private Holmes's will is cracking into pieces. The sudden influx of oxygen is overwhelming. It's too much. His mind goes muzzy. Sherlock's knees join in the fun and cry mutiny; first order of business being a battle with Earth's gravity. He's bobbling about, legs set to buckle. Sherlock colours in shame, aware of how ridiculous he looks. His body is splayed wide and jiggling like a two-penny whore's.
"Lay back then, Holmes. On your back, knees up and on your stomach," John commands. "No, scoot back," he says, "put your bum all the way on." Sherlock wriggles ineffectively, it being somewhat difficult to manoeuvre without his hands. Finally, he's positioned where John wants him; hands on head, arms angled about his ears to frame his face, ridiculously long feet hoisted up to face the sky, and...oh, oh, oh. Sherlock's arse full on display, taint peeking out from luscious flesh, lightly hairy thighs, full taut balls, and his
John skids backwards, nearly stumbling over himself to put space between himself and his dirty deed. Biting a person is a prurient act of perversion. John has treated many victims of abuse bearing the same vicious marks on their bodies.
Whist John's words are playful, the mad light in those blue eyes is still unnerving. "Well, John," Sherlock defiantly rallies, "I unequivocally agree. We
" A low rumble of laughter escapes Sherlock. "Yes, I believe I do." He pauses, closing his eyes in contemplation. A word that he hardly ever speaks, but should be easy enough to recall in a hurry. "Poodle."
The genius hears his blogger speaking, but the words are fuzzy and indistinct, unimportant. "Hmmm?" he murmurs, pushing determinedly into John's slightly soft abdomen, a small pad of fat circling his navel. Sherlock finds it incredibly endearing, and a most excellent surface to rub against; especially whilst salty-slick with his come. "God, John.You feel so good."
His balls lay flush against his groin. They ache, swollen with seminal fluid. John dares not take a look, sure they've gone blue.
I can't believe I started this a year ago. Life keeps getting in the way on my writing, and that just sucks. I have three separate works on the back burner (hob), one of them a series, and am dying to get back to working on them.
"My apologies, Private. My actions were unbecoming of an officer. Give...give me a moment," John swallows, "to gather my wits." The flat is filled with the sound of desperate gasps of the two men slowly losing their minds. Sherlock can't catch his breath to satisfy his body's requirements. He's suffocating, held low under the weight of John's need.
The little man's mouth squishes inward into nothing in a feeble attempt to erase itself. It feels unclean, but not from the heady, salted musk coating his tongue; so familiar to Sherlock's skin. No, because of his unthinking
