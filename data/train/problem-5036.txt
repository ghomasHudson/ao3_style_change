Then it’s gone.
“Ah, a business owner. Very respectable. Is it… what’s down there… the Meadowlark Café?”
Dean shrugs and pulls out a box of cigarettes and a lighter. “I don’t know, man, I’m just tired. You’re getting all Freudian on me again. You should’ve been a psych nurse instead of an ER nurse, I swear.”
He just nods, his eyes still closed. His face is pale and his forehead is glistening with sweat.
Cas turns around to see Dean smiling at him in a sort of awe. "I…I liked the idea," Cas says.
"Wondering when you're gonna leave me alone."
"Dean?"
Then there’s Miracle, a terrier mix with one ear that sticks up and one that flops, who he found at a fire scene. An abandoned building had caught fire after a severed power line sparked above it, and as they were laying their attack lines, a dog came bolting out of the wreckage. After Dean got her calmed down, he realized she was as abandoned as the house—collarless, fur matted and smoldering, malnourished. But he already had The Colonel, who he knew didn’t play well with others, and it’s hard enough taking care of one dog when he has to be gone for 48-hour stretches of time. So, he took her to the Humane Society and told them what a miracle it was that she survived, and the name stuck. Two weeks later, no one had adopted her, and Dean caved.
Cas leans away slightly. "What?" He can feel Dean's heartbeat under his palm.
"What." It's not even a question; it's flat-out disbelief.
She tracked the banshee into town, but lost it when it stopped killing for several days. It’s dormant for another week, during which Sam and Eileen meet a few times at the library to make sure they’re ready, and Sam embarrasses himself trying to sign to her.
“I warned you against attacking Lilith at the wrong time,” Castiel says, looking at Dean.
“Look,” Dean continues, “I’m not too much of an asshole to realize I was too hard on you earlier. So, you hesitated to get the albuterol. Whatever. It’s your second shift, ever. Honestly, kid, you’re doing great. You drive really well, even under stress. You’re good at taking blood pressures, which—believe me—most new recruits are not. You listen well, you care about patients, and you always want to be helpful. You’ll be really good at this job, so I’m sorry I chewed you out at the hospital.”
“It’s not.” Dean grabs Sam’s shirt with his uninjured hand. “If you want to do something for me, then leave with me. Get out of here together, find some other way. You and me.”
For just a moment, Dean stops in the doorway to the bar. Then he shakes his head and continues as if he'd never heard him.
"No, it did," the angel says, his arm falling back to his side. "Or nearly." He frowns and cocks his head slightly. "I've never been unconscious before, much less for an entire day. I had no idea what had happened until someone found that—" he nods to the necklace, "—in my leg. Impressive, I'll give you that. But no, it didn't kill me."
Crowley looks him in the eye and says, "Yes, that's what I've had to assume."
“It must have been… Jack described what happened to him, and it sounds like he wasn’t in there for half the time you were.”
As soon as he draws the blade back for a kill, Cas lifts his foot and kicks the demon square in the chest, sending him stumbling backward with a grunt. He pulls the sword out of his stomach and the knife out of his chest. By the time Dean comes back with the angel blade, Cas parries his attack and sinks Dean's knife into the demon's arm. It seems to alarm him more than hurt him and it affords Cas just enough time to grab his blade back. He slashes Dean across the cheek as a distraction and returns to heaven a second later.
“They do?”
“Yeah, thanks. Night, Dean.”
The werewolf bares its teeth, snarling, and stalks closer to Dean. Lit from behind by the lamp in the park, its oversized shadow stretches across the grass.
Cas shakes his head and pulls his hand away from Dean.
“Cas, I… I almost got him killed, I can’t… I’m sorry. I should’ve done a better job—”
Slowly setting down the book, Sam looks around. The lawns of the apartments are empty as far as he can see and there's nothing across the road. He tries to follow where Riot's gaze—hearing, more like—is fixated on, but he can't find anything.
“Yeah, well. I just say that when I’m trying not to lose my shit.”
Heat radiates from him—he must be spreading his wings—and his form warps and shatters in a way Dean never saw in his dreams. Then he’s gone.
“Weren’t those oxys?”
Eileen punches him in the arm, and Sam laughs.
"Glad to see you're awake," he says. "I'm Jeff; I'm your nurse. How do you feel?"
He ends up suturing the wound, and he does what he used to always do with Sam when his brother was young: tries to distract him from the lack of anesthetic with shitty jokes and whatever topics of conversation he can come up with on the spot. Cas is a lot tougher than an adolescent Sam, but Dean does it anyway, if nothing else because Cas just saved his life, and he owes him at least that.
Cas frowns and sits down in the car as Dean drops into the driver's seat. "But I think you know this world much better than I do."
“No.”
"He didn't tell you?"
Happiness. Awe. Love.
"Dean," he says, standing. Even though he'd known this was coming as soon as he saw the text, he's still surprised to see him. "Wh—why are you here? You sounded like—you made it sound like you'd never come back."
“You couldn’t have picked somewhere with rooms that opened to the parking lot?” Dean grumbles as they make their way down the hall.
“I don’t want to talk about it right now.” She sweeps her pistol off the floor and shoves it back into her thigh holster. “Let’s get the fuck out of here. I’ll drive with Sam, we’ll regroup at the Roadhouse and figure out what to do from there. Neither of you two need to be making any big decisions while you’re still pissed at each other.”
Sam shakes his head. "Not really. But…thanks for not killing me. I guess."
The penultimate chapter, AKA: you didn't think I was going to plant that Chekhov's gun without firing it, did you?
Dean nods. "I know that, too."
“You… what?”
"Cas," Dean answers before he starts to cough. At first he assumes it's something from the crash, but he hadn't been coughing up blood before.
"You're making fun of me now."
“What’s her name?”
Crowley looks up from his drink. "No, why do you ask?"
Jack is stunned. He knows from his textbooks that the chance of recovery after CPR is minimal, even if better than without it, but he never imagined it would be like this. He spent the last hour looking into this woman’s unfocused eyes, acting alternately as her heartbeat and her breath, and it was all for nothing.
Anger starts to rise up in him. "Dean, this is only over because you're saying it's over. You still have a choice here. What exactly are you expecting to do? Go back to killing endlessly, like a monster? That's not you—"
"Castiel?"
Though he tried to hide it—of course—Dean seemed forlorn when he and Sam first started hunting again. He seemed more tired, more jaded, more depressed than when Sam last saw him, just after the Devil’s Gate. He’s perking up now. He sings in the car and winks at people across pool tables and calls Sam “Sammy” incessantly. Dean is always made complete by the nearness of family, and unfortunately for him, Sam is all he has left.
Finally, Crowley's calm is very slightly ruffled. "I…It's a long story. But I know about you. I know where you live—obviously—I know about your dog Riot, I know about your girlfriend who recently left town, I know you were adopted as an infant and never knew your real parents."
Sam fidgets. He gets the sense he’s supposed to be doing this alone, but would it be so bad to have some help, at least until he can find Lilith? Surely Lilith is the demon he’s supposed to kill. Is he really putting Dean at any more risk by hunting with him? He’ll hunt Lilith either way.
Cas swallows. "I don't know."
Sam winces and rubs the back of his head. "How'd you get in here? You weren't here, like, a second ago."
Later, after the two had experienced each other and spent some time lying in the car and talking quietly about life or things that could make the other smile, Cas sits up and glances out the windshield.
Dean shakes his head. “No. But it doesn’t change how I feel about my job. I’m just pissed I’m going to have to take a leave while I heal. I’ll be bored out of my mind.”
Dean pulls the brakes hard and yanks his handlebars to the right. His motorcycle starts to tip and skid out from under him, then slams into something—metal screeches and crunches and he's thrown forward. He hits the ground mainly with his shoulder, but his momentum is enough that he rolls several times before coming to a stop on his side.
When he's done, he decides it was surprisingly pointless, but this time he can see the appeal. It's relaxing, if nothing else.
He remembers what it's like to be human.
"You're using yourself to heal me? How? I thought you…." A look of dread crosses his face. "What did you do?"
A couple of Facebook pages show up and Dean selects the first. Sam Winchester, age 33. Lives in Kermit, Texas. Born in Lawrence, Kansas. He was last active eight hours ago.
Dean just shakes his head, then stops cold.
Dean pours the poison Crowley gave him over his knife blade and stands up. The girl gives a short scream and turns to run, but she stops short right before slamming into Dean. She freezes in fear.
Who is he to think he can ever have a relationship with someone, especially an angel? He's a time bomb of anger and violence and desperation. He's never committed to anything.
"Did you get hit in the face?" Cas asks, confused.
"What's up?" Dean asks, turning back to him.
Cas smiles. “Probably not.” He steps out from behind the counter and points to one of the tables against the wall. “Come on.”
"And that's what I'll never understand," Dean says, and kisses him. He's never felt so mortal as he does in that moment. "I love you, Angel. I don't know if I have any right to say that, what with being a demon and all, but I swear I do."
"Okay. We've got all the obvious pieces: engine, coolant, radiator, battery, oil reservoir and dipstick….Um. This is brake fluid. These are the spark plugs. The carburetor is under there, kind of. This one? Is AC, right?"
He opens the front door of his apartment and immediately gets pounced by an Australian Shepherd.
Cas frowns and looks at the prices written on some of used cars' windshields. "Most of these are several thousand."
By the time he finally gets to planting the peas, his phone starts ringing from where he left it on the back porch. Cursing softly, he pulls off his gloves and reaches it as it’s about to go to voicemail. He doesn’t recognize the number, but he doesn’t have time to think, so he just answers it.
Cas frowns, flips the phone to silent, and lets it go to voicemail.
“Dean.”
“Why are you watching me? Are you one of them?”
“My bad,” Dean says, raising his hands. “You’ll have to forgive me, most of the coffee I drink comes from drive-thrus. I don’t go to coffee shops very often.”
Dean gives Jack a pat on the knee and stands. “Just keep doing what you’re doing. You’ll be just fine.”
It seems strange to think of Dean as his best friend. There had always been a hierarchy about their relationship; Crowley found something for Dean to do, Dean did it. It was simple. But it's undeniable as well that the two had some great times together.
"Whiskey?"
"Yeah, I see it."
"I'm not ready," Cas admits.
The knife pulls away and Cas falls to his knees. He hears movement from Dean, but his sense of hearing is slipping away.
Sam sits down in the car and shuts the door. Dean turns to the Roadhouse, listening to the growling engine fade. Then he slams his fist into the wall, the pain shooting up his arm, throbbing in his hand. Two of his knuckles start to bleed.
“No. I can’t speak freely here, Dean. The Host is watching. We’ll talk next time you fall asleep.”
"That's not—fine. I'll lay off them. But since I didn't fully smoke that one, would you kiss me now?"
Back at his motel, he fills the plastic sack from the ice bucket with ice and balances it on his shoulder. He flips through channels on the old tube TV, but there are only about five of them and nothing interesting is on. The armchair smells of cheap cigarettes, the kind of stench that clings in his nostrils and permeates his clothes.
"You gonna say somethin', Angel?" Dean asks, not turning back to Cas. He seems tense all of a sudden, like he had that night by the motorcycle.
"Woah, you alright, man?" a man passing by asks.
“Don’t call me sir.”
"Dean," Cas says, because he doesn't know what else he can say.
“Did you—did you actually call me at eleven forty-five just to… catch up?”
“She’s felt short of breath all morning,” the man says, “but it got bad really suddenly—she used her inhaler twice today and it didn’t touch it. I don’t know what’s happening.”
He never took enough of a break for his shoulder to heal, and his boots are falling apart. It’s been a few days since he showered, because his credit card keeps bouncing and he can’t get a motel room. He hasn’t spoken to another person in forty-eight hours, and before that it was simple “thanks” to a gas station cashier. And he has a demon tied up in his trunk.
Crowley slides his wine glass away from him and sits back on his stool. It takes him a while to answer. "Because it's what he wants," he says slowly. "He's never had all that much control over what goes on in his life. I don't want him to hate me, and after what that angel has shown him about life and—I hate to even say this, but—love, he'd never be the same coming back to me. Besides, I'm starting to wonder if maybe he's not the only thing I ever can care about."
"I'm sorry, Cas," he says again. He turns to him and a few stray tears streak down his face. "I don't—I don't know how…." He gaze slips from Cas and he looks to the floor.
But Cas is faster and uses his other hand instead. He can sense that the inner lining of the demon's stomach is torn up and other parts of his vital organs are damaged in ways Cas can't quite identify. He tries to heal them as best he can, but he can't fix all of it, like something's blocking his power.
“And he can’t stand that. I know.”
"Last night, spending half of the day earlier with Sam, this date….You're preparing for the end."
He debates calling Bobby, but it’s past midnight in Sioux Falls and he figures he might as well let the man sleep. This creature, whatever it actually is, doesn’t seem to be killing people, so there’s no real rush.
Jack swallows. “I don’t—I don’t know, I just thought—for a second I couldn’t remember where to get the albuterol from, and I thought if I didn’t know it could mean bad things for the patient, and then it would be my fault something happened to her, and—”
“You rolled in with a half-concocted plan and five hunters,” Cas retorts.
Cas smiles slightly, which he doesn't do terribly often and Dean always likes to see.
As he pulls back onto the road and the police lights turn off behind him, his mind is quickly drawn to the dream he’d been having. Strange, how lucid he had been at the end. That was no memory, or even a bastardization of one—it was as though someone had actually been inside his dream. The same someone he had almost seen a few days ago, but decided to shoot at before asking questions.
"How long?"
He drains the rest of his beer and doesn’t bother changing out of the fed threads before taking the piece of stationery and going to his car.
Sam looks down at the counter. It's not as though he needed a reminder. But now he realizes what Crowley's there for. He's come to Sam before to talk about his problems. If what Crowley says is true, he's known Dean longer than anyone, and it would hurt to lose him.
"I'm not a demon," Dean says quickly. "Not anymore. Look, we're just here to talk to you. I have a lot to say."
She shakes her head and turns away, hanging her head so her long, blond hair shields her face.
"What?"
“Yeah, and I said, ‘Go put the arm in the fucking ambulance with the patient, Fitz,’” the firefighter named Turner says, shaking his head. “Dude thought he was funny as shit for that.”
"We need to go," Dean says immediately, shoving the phone in his pocket and grabbing things around the room to throw in his bag. "We have to go, now."
They spend an hour outside that house, trying to get the woman’s pulse back. It returns twice, but never for more than half a minute before it’s gone again, and Jack is back kneeling on the concrete to pump on the woman’s chest.
"I thought I healed you," Cas says, his concern clear in his voice. "Even that."
"After what I've done, that's the only thing that's okay," Dean says, taking a step closer to Cas. "You have no idea the kind of regret I'm on the edge of right now, Angel."
"What?" Cas asks with a frown as he leans away from Dean.
“One. Two—”
"That's—that's good. You two deserve it." He pauses. "But you'll still…you'll come back here before—"
"Ah yes, Sam. I knew you couldn't resist giving me a ring, could you?" Crowley answers in a flirtatious tone.
The light causes him to squeeze his eyes shut reflexively. There’s a low, sonic
In minutes, he’s asleep.
Dean blinks a few times and scowls.
This makes Dean snort in amusement, though Cas didn't really feel like it had been a joke. "You've got a one-up on most, then."
"Do you still want my help?"
Crowley watches Sam carefully. He knows who he is. He knows things Sam has no clue about.
Cas turns around so his back faces Dean.
Dean flips his machete in his hand. “Preying on those people in the trailer park, because they’re easy targets? Because no one will look for them? Your words, pal, not mine. That’s pretty low, even for a thing like you.”
"Nothing," he answers. "I don't." He's putting up a well-practiced act; inside, he's scrambling for ideas of how to get Cas away without killing anyone.
"Amelia?" Dean frowns suspiciously. "I miss a chance to kill one person and suddenly I'm having second thoughts about what I've been doing my whole life?"
Sam shakes his head and starts to pace. He knows the end game is the same as he's known for a long time it was going to be. But this feels different. Somewhere in the reasoning part of his brain he knows Dean is right and he understands this decision. But then there's emotion, and that says no.
Dean made an overstated shrug and sat hard on the bed. "That's what caused all of this. Feelings, sure there were feelings. And this is what happens." He heaves slightly, but doesn't throw up. "It's not worth it," he slurs. "It's not worth it for someone who just holds me back all the time."
“Can you outrun them?”
But Sam knows what’s at stake if he goes back. He still sees it at night. He sees blood drip from a demon’s wrist into his infant self’s mouth, he sees Max Miller’s brain blow out the back of his head, he sees the crazed look in Ava Wilson’s eyes as she revealed her intent to kill her competitors, including him. He sees himself killing a hunter and tying up Jo and shooting his brother in the shoulder—everything he did while possessed by Meg—and somehow it feels like some part of him wanted to do those things, too.
“So, you lied to me, you lied to my face. So much for no secrets, huh?”
When he hangs up with Sam, he returns to Cas inside. Just moving from one place to another makes him feel slightly dizzy. He's calmer now after speaking to his brother, but the less angry he feels, the weaker he seems to become.
“This is so stupid.” Dean clears his throat and works, as he usually does so well, on bottling up his tears. “I’m fine, I swear.”
“We’re going to, but first you have to get out.”
Dean rolls his eyes and downs his scotch in one swallow before he stands up. "If you're not telling me something that's going to matter later, I'm gonna be pissed."
Dean snorts. He takes the cigarette away from lips and exhales smoke directly into Cas's face. "You can help me?"
Sam shrugs and tosses a washcloth onto the counter to clean spilled drops from previous customers. "This is one of the only bars in the area and I know most of the people who come in here. I'd never seen you until about a month ago and now you're here once a week."
“What the fuck happened, man?” Dean says, stepping inside and kneeling to take stock of his brother’s injuries. The way he’s holding his arm, he either broke it or dislocated his shoulder, and his lower left pantleg is bloodied, but he seems alright otherwise.
Dean's jaw tightens, but he's mostly expressionless.
"I kill someone about every week. Sure."
He shakes his head and can't seem to look Cas in the eyes. His fists clench, making blood leak out from between his fingers. "I was angry, I was dying, I—I don't know, Cas. I don't know."
Cas watches him as he packs up his first aid kit. “I suppose you would.” The way he says it, Dean feels like he’s putting more meaning into Dean’s words than he intended when he said them.
“Dean?”
Jack smiles. He sniffles and takes a deep breath.
Dean grabs Jack’s arm, pulling him out of his thoughts, and Jack removes the stethoscope from his ears.
“No, I haven’t been able to catch her. Why?”
Crowley frowns and narrows his eyes slightly. "You've never met him."
Two demons reach him and that cruel elegance which had become a part of him rears its head. He ducks an attack and slices open the demon's jugular, then kicks the other in the side of the knee, causing her leg to snap. Before he reaches her, she smokes out. As the others come for him, he dives over and snatches up Cas's angel blade, digging it into the stomach of the demon nearest him.
Then someone steps out onto the crosswalk in front of him as he's traveling about thirty miles an hour and he has less than a second to react.
“Oh, just that?”
"Yes," he answers quickly, tightly. "Talk to me. Pretend everything's normal."
"You know, that angel of yours has good senses," says a nasal voice from behind Cas.
"Dean. I can't," he says, looking from her outstretched hand to his arm, which he holds against his side.
“I fuckin’ hate him for ever saying that to me.” His hand tightens on the steering wheel, the smooth leather pressing reassuringly into his palm. “My whole life, you know, it’s been my number-one job to protect you from—the world, and the better I followed Dad’s orders, the better I could do that. To have his dying request be to protect the world from you? If I could take that back, if I could’ve never heard him say that… I wish to God he’d just left it at ‘I’m proud of you,’ and ‘don’t be scared.’ That’s what dads are supposed to say.”
“Hypertensive, a little tachy. Couldn’t get her oxygen above eighty-four, even on fifteen liters and after a neb.”
"Another tip," Dean adds with an extremely unamused expression. "Don't appear and disappear right behind people."
“I should go.”
"You must be here for something," Sam says, leaning against his kitchen counter, across from where Crowley sat, looking distastefully at the wine in front of him—the only alcohol Sam had to offer other than beer. "You're clearly not here for the alcohol, or you would've already left."
Dean's eyes snap open. "I got angry." He looks around the room indifferently, though his jaw is slightly tightened. "This is what emotions are to me, Cas."
He redresses himself and soon after finds himself sitting cross-legged on the floor up against the side of the bed. He's staring out the window and wondering.
Sam frowns and shakes his head, but goes to see what he has anyway. He can't quite bring himself to tell Crowley to get out.
Cas realizes he'd been staring at Dean's chest again and his eyes dart back up to Dean's face. "I—um—no. I've never seen them before."
"We knew this would happen," Dean says, snatching the knife from the floor and rising. "Once a demon, always a demon."
Dean pulls both arms away from Cas and turns away, and suddenly their intimacy is gone. "You keep saying things like that, as if I've actually done any good."
"Well," Alastair says with a smug smile, "I'm not dead yet. Beside, you were just in a mood. I was trying to kill your favorite pet, who, I've noticed, isn't here."
“On me,” Cas says. “You fixed my oven. And I was going to cover it anyway, because you bought my drinks.”
It’s just not in his nature to say no.
Dean knocks lightly on the window before opening the door. Jack sits up fast and wipes his cheeks.
“I want to take you somewhere.”
Dean was riding an endorphin high when they came down the stairs for dinner.
and he hated it. At least Castiel wasn’t wearing a tie.
“Dean,” Castiel said breathlessly, fingers cold and wet where they trailed up the inside of Dean’s thigh. The first touch at his hole made Dean stiffen, but he relaxed when all Castiel did was circle the furled skin. It felt weird, different, but not bad. Dean slipped a hand between their bodies, squeezing his dick when Castiel breached his opening with a finger tip.
“Okay?” Castiel asked after adding another finger, stretching Dean wider, when Dean gasped.
was the only word his brain supplied besides
The bug-eyed front end of the Porsche 911 stared at him in superiority. He glared right back. The young alpha that slid out of the driver's seat took Castiel’s suitcase and loaded it into the trunk, which Dean knew without looking was probably the size of a shoebox. His lip curled. When the kid tried to take his duffle, Dean snapped, “Hands off.”
“You want to be a mechanic.” The word sounded dirty when she said it.
“Hey, what’d I say about apologizing?” Dean tucked his chin so he could meet Castiel’s eyes, lifting a hand to rub at the furrow between his brows with his thumb. “Besides, I’ve had some of the best sex of my life the last couple days.”
“Why the hell’d you have to say that?”
“You people are un-fucking-believable,” Dean muttered
. “Fuck me.”
“Whether you apologize or not, we’re leaving. You’ve gone too far this time, mother.”
“Dean, are you okay?”
When they parked in front of the house and got out of the car, Castiel met him at the bumper and took Dean’s hand. “Come on.”
“Oh, I don’t have kids.” Dean tried not to sound as horrified as the idea made him feel. He was still in college and with Dean’s background he’d be a lousy dad. “It’s for my… boyfriend,” he said, testing out the word, for real, not as some front for Castiel’s family.
It took an interminably long time for the conveyor belt to spit Castiel’s luggage out (how many clothes did one guy need for a week?), then they were
while they got clean.
“To see the ocean.”
. He wanted to forget where he ended and Castiel began. It was too much and not enough. He couldn’t hold back a sound of complaint when Castiel’s fingers slipped from his hole.
“I have a duty to protect this family from people who might take advantage of us,” she took a deep breath to regain her composure, smoothing hair that didn’t need smoothing into place. “You’ve always been too trusting, Castiel. I won’t apologize for looking out for your well-being.”
“That seems dishonest.”
Castiel’s family either took him for granted or took advantage of him. He deserved better. Castiel fell silent, then said simply, “You know why.”. One of his hands hesitantly lifted to cup Dean’s cheek, moving slowly, giving Dean the opportunity to say no or pull away.
“Good morning.” He sounded somber and Dean felt his heart drop, expecting the worst, trying to shove the anxiety down anyway. He kept his mouth shut, knowing there was no stopping the inevitable. “Do you want to leave?”
“Yeah, right,” Dean gritted.
“No, I mean, I’m terrible at lying. I don’t think I can fabricate a relationship and be convincing. If my parents don’t see right through me, my brothers will. Especially Gabriel,” he added under his breath, just loud enough that Dean caught it.
That pompous jackass. Chuck didn’t know anything about Castiel if he thought his son would do
“Yeah, sure, whatever.” Anything to stop the
He tossed his duffle in the backseat. Over the open door he informed Castiel, “If I’m getting in this thing, it’s not gonna be in the bitch seat.”
The lump of rubber and plastic mocked him from the weeds and he took a vicious swing at it. Grass and leaves went flying, but the damn ball didn’t budge. He pushed the sleeves of his Henley up, eyes narrowed. He was going to make that thing his bitch.
Dean shook the memory away and took a deep breath before asking, “For what?”
Fuck,
Ah, hell. He almost laughed when the realization hit him. It didn’t make everything all better, knowing logically he couldn’t stop his dad from being a shit person didn’t take away years of hurt and resentment, but maybe it wasn’t all on Dean. He had been a kid who just lost his mom. All things considered, he was probably better off.
Huh, well that sucked for him. Dean had been telling lies his whole life it seemed. First little white ones to get out of trouble when he was a kid. Then big ones, like not telling Sam their dad had run out on them. In his defense, Bobby started that, probably to spare their feelings. Dean saw through it. He didn’t call the old man out on it because if it saved his brother from feeling the way
“Hi,” she said back, tucking a strand of red hair behind her ear. Her eyes flicked back and forth between him and Castiel as she spoke to the other alpha. “Um, you’re all set, Castiel. Let me just grab your keys.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, but he was smiling before he pressed a kiss to Dean’s lips. “Do you have any condoms?”
“I can see the ocean from here,” he chuckled. It was hard to miss when the houses were all pressed up against the beach.
“My form is fine.” He didn’t even know why he was arguing besides that it had just been a shitty day and he wanted it to be over with. He’d always been too stubborn for his own good. Bobby liked to tell Dean he didn’t have the sense God gave a rock. A weed went flying and he snarled.
“I might join you,” Castiel said and Dean snorted, suddenly in a slightly better mood.
It was the little blonde boy he was playing catch with in the front yard of a two story suburban home; ruffling that kid’s hair; giving him a piggyback ride inside when a woman appeared in the doorway beckoning them in. They fell from his fingers when they went numb.
“I won’t.”
decision. That was how Dean justified it, making himself feel less guilty about ogling his
“I don’t care about any of that,” Naomi said, sounding like she meant it. Balthazar had been right about that at least.It was one point in her favor, but then she added, “I’m sure there’s a nice alpha I can set you up with.”
Castiel huffed but let Dean walk inside without him. When he brought his purchase to the counter, the elderly omega behind it smiled at him, the action digging deeper grooves into her face, green eyes obscured behind thick glasses. The name tag pinned to her cardigan said Agnes. “Did your pups have a good time?”
“No. We’re leaving.” Castiel met her stare straight on and didn’t back down. Naomi looked to her husband for support.
“Okay.” Castiel said, but didn’t elaborate. Dean waved his hand in the air between them. “Where?”
“Please,” he begged anyway. “Please, Cas.”
“Everything. Coming here with me. Spending the day with me when you didn’t want to. Putting up with my family.”
“Are you alright? I’m so sorry. She had no right to do that--mmph.” Dean swallowed the rest of Castiel’s words, head swimming with how Castiel melted into it, meeting him with equal passion. When the other alpha pulled away too soon, Dean couldn’t contain a growl. Castiel held him back, hands pressed to Dean’s chest when he tried to close the space between them. “Dean, talk to me.”
Castiel handed his suitcase to the shuttle driver and said, “My mother offered to have a driver pick us up, but I thought having access to a vehicle would be wise.”
Castiel paused on his way to the passenger side, expression filled with disapproval. “I feel like I should be insulted by that.”
“Then let’s go.” Castiel slid out of bed and grabbed his suitcase out of the closet. “Should have seen this coming. She’s done it before.”
“What? How?”
He closed the distance between them instead. The press of Castiel’s lips was soft, sliding against his own. Dean was the one who deepened it, until Castiel was leaning on an elbow, with Dean on top of him, granules of sand digging into his palm, the buttons of Castiel’s shirt pressing into the skin of his chest.
Dean takes a moment to breathe, and then nods. As usual, his body has already started reacting to the anticipation of a scene with Cas, and somehow the sight of the uncapped needle – the sharp steel of it, about to pierce his skin in just a moment – only heightens his arousal.
"So you don't want a wife?" Cas asked. "A family of your own?"
“You came to bed with me,” he remembers. That’s significant; it has to be. Sam thinks so too, if the way he lifts his eyebrows in surprise is any indication. “Before you knew about my memory loss,“ Cas continues. “I didn’t know it then, but I was asking you to share my bed for the first time. And you wanted to.”
Once again, Cas finds that he needs to hear it. “Do you want that, Dean?” He steps forward, finally, and sits down on the edge of the bed, close to Dean. He reaches out, fingertips barely skimming over Dean’s side where the blanket doesn’t cover him, and Dean’s breath stutters.
Cas allowed him to do it, rolling on top of Dean. He hesitated a bit before lowering his body, and Dean realised why when he felt it. Cas hadn't been kidding about the boner, and it punched a breath out of Dean, feeling it through two layers of fabric, nestled on the inside of his hip.
The thrumming in his chest continues as he raises his hand to knock on the door, but he’s not nervous. This place feels right, more than anything else has in this plane of existence.
“Talked to Jimmy and Amelia yet?”
“Fancy meeting you here. What flag is that?” Dean nodded to the black, grey, white and purple flag Cas was almost dragging into the ground by now, and he quickly raised it again.
he meant a lot to Cas, hearing him say it out loud was always… confusing. Not because he wasn't sure of his own feelings for Cas; he was. Had been for many years now. No, it was confusing because he never knew quite what Cas meant when he said those things. Whether his feelings were the same as Dean's, or whether his affection was solely of the 'best friend' variety.
Dean didn't have to wonder about it long before Cas answered it, voice soft between them.
Dean’s breath caught in his chest. “We don’t have to – just because, um. I mean, we’re not standing underneath it.”
Dean’s bed has always been a place of comfort to him, but it doesn’t offer him much of that when Cas opens him up with his fingers, no soothing words as he touches Dean where no one has touched before, nor when Dean tells Cas to fuck him and it turns out he wasn't ready for Cas's girth like he'd thought he was.
"Okay," Charlie agreed.
Dean doesn't know if other Doms are as sappy as Cas – if what they have is a typical D/s relationship – but he finds that he doesn't really care. What they have is perfect for them, and he loves his sappy angel Dom, even if he isn't sure he deserves him.
When Dean finally pulls down Cas's pants and helps him step out of them, he ends up unexpectedly (although how he didn't expect it, he's not sure) close to an angel boner stretching Cas's boxer briefs out in front of him.
"Go Uncle Cas!" was shouted by one of the kids, and Dean turned his head to see Bobby standing there with Charlie, both of them cheering for Cas.
“Oh.” Cas wasn’t ashamed of his asexuality, per se, but he hadn’t really spoken to anyone about it either. Not to mention it was kind of unnerving to tell the boy he liked that he wasn’t interested in sex. “Um. It’s the asexual flag.”
Eileen could roast a mean leg of lamb, and it was a long time since Dean had eaten anything this good. The company, however, was even better. Dean couldn't think of anything quite like having a hearty meal with the people he loved the most. It was clear that both the kids and Sam and Eileen were happy to have him and Cas there, the conversation flowing freely and enthusiastically.
Dean’s cock has smeared a slick trail onto Cas’s belly, sliding against it every time Benny’s thrusts send him forward. “Oh shit. I’m gonna come,” he gasps, and the words immediately take Cas’s arousal up a notch, bringing him closer to his own orgasm. And if Benny’s grunt above them is any indication, it had the same effect on him.
"So, uh." Dean scratched his neck and then faced away from Cas to turn off the overhead light. It was a coincidence that the near-darkness happened to hide his blush as he walked to the bed while he continued speaking. "The kids went kinda crazy earlier today. With the, um. Trying to get us together thing."
Cas’s voice had taken on a tremulous quality when he spoke again. “I see.”
Dean knows he’s into men. He’s never admitted it to anyone but himself, and certainly not acted on it, and it’s only because of this that his body reacts whenever a cop pushes his face into a wall or bends him over the hood of the Impala to cuff him. Because those are the only times he’s close to a man like that.
And that’s what makes his decision for him. Whatever he’s looking to get out of Heaven, he’s not going to find it on the highway. He leaves Baby on the side of the road (she’s not really Baby anyway, only an illusion, a mirage) and begins walking into the forest that the road winds through. He’s not really sure what he’s doing or where he’s going, only that his heart (or his soul or whatever that thing beating in the chest is these days) thrums faster than it has since he got here, to the beat of a rhythm he can’t hear but that’s pulling him further and further into the forest.
“Hey. Kid.” Maybe not the greatest start, but Dean thinks he can be forgiven. He’s family, after all. “Jack or… God, or whatever I should call you these days. I don’t know if you’re around anymore, except in… I don’t know, everything. I don’t know if you’re – if you’re you anymore, but if you are, then I could really use some guidance. I don’t know how to do this Heaven stuff, and I just – I need to find Cas, all right? I need to see him again.”
Dean hummed, feeling his heart swell just a tiny bit more with emotion for this ancient being who thought humans deserved rainbows. "So… you created the thing that, um." Dean faltered, uncertain which word he should use, but… he was out now. He didn't have to pretend that he didn't know the term. "That LGBTQ people use as their—" Dean paused, realising maybe for the first time that he was allowed to consider himself part of that community.
“The photo you just took.”
love with me.”
"Here, let me." He can't remember when he last spoke to Cas in a voice this soft, but he thinks maybe he should have all along. His hand reaches up to Cas's neck, but his eyes are caught by Cas's gaze, searching, curious. Fingers reach warm skin, and he sways closer while he rubs against the black substance with his thumb.
"I must admit I didn't pay much attention to the second half of the movie," Cas said, and Dean had no idea how to interpret that, but he was fully aware of how his heart wanted to interpret it.
Dean’s rooted to the spot, flushing hot and cold. Mostly hot. “Right. Okay. You – you wanna watch me have sex with her.”
He surges forward and captures Dean’s lips.
"You're always good, Dean. You're the best person I know." Dean would have felt embarrassed, but instead it felt like his heart was about to overflow, and his body responded in return as he tried to pull Cas closer to himself.
"Trust me, I will," Dean replied, dipping Charlie as he bent to pick up his duffel, drawing laughter from the child once more before putting her down on her feet again and following her inside.
The door was unlocked from inside and unceremoniously flung open, and Dean suddenly found himself with the arms of an eager 6-year-old wrapped around his waist, Cas in much the same situation beside him. "Hey, kiddos!" Dean grinned and bent down to hug each of the twins in turn as Cas did the same, and then he dropped his duffel bag onto the porch and lifted the little brunette in his arms up in the air. She squealed with delight – a sound Dean knew he'd never tire of.
He’s aware of Cas’s heavy gaze on them when he kisses her, when they fall to bed together; when he frees her breasts and touches her with lips and fingers in all the places he knows drive women crazy. It's infinitely more arousing, knowing that they're being watched, and while he pays Alicia her due attention, he is also highly conscious of Cas watching him slide her panties to the side and worship her with his mouth; of Cas watching Dean's pleasure as she sucks his cock, and then later as she seats herself on top of him, riding him slowly.
"Yes. You're lucky I like you. I would never let the aurora take you away." Cas's smile was a soft, affectionate thing, only for Dean, and Dean's breath caught in his throat.
“Come in.” Cas sounded like shit, and although Dean knew this wasn’t anything life-threatening, his ever-present concern for Cas had him opening the door and stepping inside right away.
Matthew, it appears, has only recently moved into his apartment and doesn’t have any chairs yet.
Dean hadn't expected that it would be possible to lose track of time while lying outside in the snow, cold and damp, but when his teeth began to chatter after making out for what had clearly been way too long, he realised it was entirely possible. "Shit."
“You would look good with one,” Cas remarks, which catches Dean off-guard. He wasn’t expecting Cas to pick up on the fact that that’s something he wants, much less make a comment like that.
“Not you. The sex. Her and you, together,” Cas says, amused, and Dean wants to kick himself for Cas learning how to use people’s words against them from him.
Dean’s laugh came out more as a sob, or maybe it was the other way around. He wiped a stray tear from his cheek with the palm of his hand. “’Course I do, Cas. I just…” He searched for words that wouldn’t come, about how he loved Cas too much to be able to share him with someone else. How he couldn’t bear knowing that he wasn’t enough for Cas.
Cas looks down himself questioningly, but Dean doesn't indicate where it is. Instead, he steps out of the spray, closer to Cas.
room, if they weren’t at the bunker – by himself during his heats.
"Then you were wrong about one thing." He finally allows his forehead to rest against Cas's. "I'm sorry I made you think it wasn’t a possibility, but if you really do want me…" He resists the instinct to ask why the hell Cas would want to be with him. He's not going to question his worth anymore, or his capacity to love and be loved – not after everything Cas told him. Not when his heart is damn near brimming over with love for the angel-turned-human in front of him. "Cas, you've got me. I'm yours."
Cas was on his bed, naked, lying on his stomach, and desire swirled dangerously in Dean’s gut. He clenched his hands, digging his fingernails into his palm. He knew he’d give anything right then and there to just stride right over to the angel, cover his body with his own and plunge inside him, like he’d dreamt so many times of Cas doing to him. He probably hadn’t had a single heat in the past ten years where he hadn’t fantasized about that.
Dean shakes his head, standing up and backing away from the gruesome scene. "You don't get it. Right then, I was—I was ready to die. I would've just let them kill me, but no." His throat is tight and it's getting harder to speak. "Your life had to be on the line, Cas. And I couldn't…of course I couldn't let you die. It had to be you." He finishes with gritted teeth.
“Cas,” Dean says in surprise, sitting more upright against his pillows. “What are you doing here?”
“No trying out law school for you?”
Dean pulls himself out of the trance he'd fallen into as he described what had happened. "Yeah. From what I know, it's not something just anyone can do; you'd have to be either an extremely powerful demon—more powerful than Crowley—or a very powerful witch. Crowley may not have been enough of a demon to do it, but his mother was an excellent witch. He knew enough from her to pull it off."
Cas is on the roof when his phone rings again. He hasn't done much in the past week except sight-see—which is very hard to do in Texas, as there isn't much to see. He watches the sky and watches the humans, mostly. It's not a boring experience to him—he has infinite patience and, unlike many angels, he's fascinated by it. But it doesn't mean he's not lonely. He's never had a concept of loneliness until now.
"You can call me Cas."
He smiles. “No harm, no foul.” He glances up and down the street to ensure no one is nearby. “What are you hunting?”
"That's not what I mean."
"No, dear god, tell me everything," Dean says, looking relieved now that they're done talking about him. "What's boring to you will be amazing to me. Having missed the whole 'normal life' thing."
Dean gets a sudden wave of nausea and he can't help but double over.
Cas shakes his head and steps toward him anyway. Dean turns to attack him again, but this time Cas sees it coming. He catches each of Dean's hands in his own, then pins both of them together in his left hand. The demon is incredibly strong as he tries to escape the grasp, but Cas is stronger. He reaches up to Dean's forehead with his right hand and—fortunately—touches him before he can deliver a kick. Dean goes still as Cas tries to figure out what's wrong with him. He can't exactly pinpoint what's causing it—not like he usually can—but he can find the bleeding in Dean's stomach and lungs and heal it temporarily.
"What are you talking about?" Dean asks with a confused smirk, stepping toward Cas until he's only knee-deep in water.
"Hey," Dean says firmly, "don't give me that. You've done the best you can. Better. That's more than I could've asked for."
“No, I can do it.”
"Crowley," Dean says by way of greeting. He's the only demon in hell who can stroll up to the king on his throne without paying any respects. The only one who can do it and not get pinned to the wall as a dartboard, that is.
He exhales and stops trying to put his wings away, and Dean gets a better look at them. One of the mid-sized wings extending from his lower back has a ragged tear at the bottom of it, and the wound produces an ethereal white substance more like a mist than a liquid.
Crowley frowns. "Maybe, why?"
“Carol.”
"But you've been doing it your whole life," Cas points out. "Isn't it regular by now? Routine?"
Cas raises his eyebrows. "No, you couldn't."
He never had proof that his brother died.
The name escapes his lips before he realizes he’s about to say it.
Cas smiles. "Fine. I have…I have something to show you anyway."
Dean shrugs. "I did what you asked. I always do."
"Well about all ya do is get on my ass about stuff," Dean says, spreading his arms. "I'm just—" he's cut off by a sudden cough. He coughs up blood into the crook of his elbow, then winces. "I'm doing what I do, Cas," he finishes. "You can't make me into something I'm not."
Dean doesn’t know if the question is directed at him or someone else entirely. Still on his knees, he falls to his uninjured elbow, holding his broken arm to his chest.
"Woah, Riot. Hey, buddy. Hold on, bud." He hangs his keys up and squats to greet his dog. "Hi! Have you been good while I was gone?" He shakes his head, smiling, and scratches behind Riot's ears. "Of course you have. Good boy." He straightens and sighs. It might take a little while before Riot no longer reminds him of Amelia.
“Are you one of them? The Men of Letters?”
The brothers stare at him for a moment, then laugh. Cas frowns.
Crowley wrinkles his nose at the drink set in front of him. It's aged whiskey, yes, but it's hardly his favorite. He takes a sip and his expression grows even sourer.
Jack smiles.
Sam frowns as he twists a saline syringe onto Dean’s IV to flush it. “It might be a while for ‘normal,’ but yeah, eventually. I mean, there probably is some damage to your lungs that may not go away, but you’d have to ask the doctor about that, that’s above my pay grade.”
"Let's go," Dean responds, taking his angel's hand. He looks to Crowley, then meets Sam's eyes. He gives his brother a smile and Sam nods.
"I'm a king. I run hell. Why else do you think I can command a hellhound like this?"
"Give it another hour, you'll see."
“Yeah, well. No one does what Sammy did. Exception that proves the rule or whatever.”
"Please."
"Hi, is this Cas?" the young woman asks. Dean finally gets a chance to actually look at her and he realizes she's beautiful. Long, curly blonde hair, warm brown eyes, and a slender build. She has a narrow face, but soft features.
"Of course I'm going to blame myself. How was any of that not my fault?"
“An Enochian sigil, carved into your ribs. It’ll make it more difficult for angels to find you, including me. But I’ll still be able to visit your dreams, and we’ll have better privacy.”
Dean hasn’t driven this Impala in years. Almost a decade now—since the last time he spoke to his father. He swore he’d get rid of it, but he hasn’t found it in himself to do it. For all this shit this car represents, he has a lot of good memories in it, too. It’s the closest he ever had to a stable home before he turned eighteen and took off, packing up his and Sam’s belongings in a single bag and driving as far away from their father as he could get.
“It’s kinda true,” Jody says. “He’s not too bad once you figure him out. Now, Rufus? Rufus is always bad.”
Jo steps outside. It’s the only thing that keeps him from hitting the wall until something breaks, be it part of his body or his mind.
Yet here he is in the human world, realizing that despite his weeks with Dean, he has no idea how to live here.
He picked up this case thinking it was a rogue reaper, but these people aren’t dying out of turn the way they were in Nebraska. They’re dying violently, but always by human causes—murders, car crashes, workplace accidents. And yet, there are multiple reports of a humanoid figure appearing after the violent deaths, leaning over the dead bodies before disappearing into thin air. But no reaper would let itself be seen by the living, would it? And the claim some witnesses made that the cloaked figure was feeding on the bodies… it doesn’t fit.
With a twist to his gut like lightning, it occurs to him that somehow, in all this time, there's something he's never said to Dean. Something he's never felt until Dean, and he thinks he'll never feel after Dean.
“And their hearts were delicious,” it says in a distorted version of the man’s voice it had in human form. “Drenched in cholesterol and alcohol.”
“You were suspicious the moment you saw the book I was reading. When I left my table and you went up to see what it was. Then you kept watching me for the rest of the day. You didn’t leave until I did.”
Dean moves to catch Cas, but Alastair's shiny black shoe collides with his stomach, shoving him backward and into the chain-link fence behind him.
"We're not here to punish you, dimwit," Gabriel adds as he sees Cas's expression. "We made a case for you in heaven and they want you back."
The newcomer, a man in his early fifties with dark hair and a salt-and-pepper beard, tucks his hands into the pockets of his long black dress coat. He coughs as Dean's cigarette smoke drifts into his face, and he waves it away. "That's disgusting, do you have to?"
He shakes his head. “No reason. How many seals has she broken so far?”
The doctor comes in shortly afterward, as promised. She places the chest tube, which pierces his chest to release the trapped air so his lung can reinflate, and the effect is instant. It’s a sharp stab of pain, then the relief of being able to fully breathe again.
"Ma?" the woman asks, trying to peer in the window.
“You—” Dean gives a short sigh. “Try answering that again, and don’t give me something regurgitated from Bible camp.”
Dean's glare doesn't waver. He strikes another match and tosses it in front of Castiel, where it catches on the ring of holy oil he'd made earlier.
“Dean. I’m glad you’re here. Things are a little chaotic, but we almost have them worked out. How do you feel about a cappuccino?”
"Yes, you do. Put them on."
"You owe me nothing, Dean," Cas says, tipping Dean's chin up so he looks at him. "I chose this. With or without heaven, I could've done anything, but I wanted to do this."
Demons. He’s surrounded by demons.
Cas, the heartbroken look still on his face, pulls Dean into a hug. "It's not really you, Dean. That's not who you are."
"Because. You're a freakin' angel and I'm a demon with anger management issues and—we already decided neither of us can feel emotions, not real ones, so why the hell are we doing this?"
Cas says nothing, just shakes his head and closes his eyes.
Cas catches him by the back of the jacket and he feels the cold blade of a knife against his throat. "Don't try it."
Jack is taken aback and at an utter loss for words. Dean steps in front of him.
"What are you going to do with it?"
“I just keep thinking,” Jack says, “maybe if we had done something differently, if we had gotten there earlier or if I had done better chest compressions or if…” He sniffles and wipes his eyes again.
Sam gives him a doubtful frown.
Dean is still eyeing the tear in Cas’s wing as it continues to seep grace into the air.
Just as he's taken his shirt off and tossed it into a laundry hamper, he hears Riot bark.
Cas frowns. "You—you looked worse for wear back there. Are you sure you shouldn't—"
He wears a black Henley with the sleeves pushed up to his elbows and faded jeans that might be older than Cas’s son. He looks tired, but he smiles when he meets Cas’s eyes across the counter.
“No, you’re alright. I’ll walk you back to your car.”
"You're back in town, huh? It's been…what, two weeks?"
“It tastes like… molecules.”
He’s caught the angel off guard, which must be why Cas waits until he’s done talking to move. He doesn’t even see it happen, just feels the punch land on his left cheekbone, snapping his head to the side and knocking him back a few steps.
Cas frowns.
"True. But whoever did must have had nine grand to spare."
"I forget how humans work," Crowley says more to himself than anything. "You're supposed to go to a hospital, yes?"
Crowley gives him a nod.
“Yeah, he introduced himself as Bart.”
Dean looks around Crowley, confused. "Who? What?"
“Hey, Bobby.”
“I was here to see Jack,” he says, “but he’s getting x-rays right now, so I thought I would check in with you.”
"Maybe." Cas was going to say more, but now he finds his gaze locked with Dean's and the words die before he fully forms them. When he'd first seen the pure black of the demon's eyes, he'd found it unsettling, but now he realizes there's some unearthly beauty in them. He and Dean are only a couple inches apart now and Cas isn't sure who's closing the distance, him or Dean; he cautiously reaches up to the side of Dean's face and starts to close his eyes.
"More or less, yeah," Dean answers.
Jo narrows her eyes. She looks like she might ask more, but she stays quiet. She isn’t willing to show the blatant disrespect Dean was.
It's the Mark again.
Sam raises the bottle toward his lips, then changes his mind and sets it down on the table. His expression looks something like guilt. He seems like he’s about to speak, but he doesn’t. Dean debates telling him about Lilith, about how whatever kind of war they’re fighting will be a hundred times worse soon, but he doesn’t.
Dean shakes his head, momentarily speechless. He lowers his voice. “I haven’t prayed a day in my life and you know that.”
"Are you a hunter?" Dean asks quickly.
As usual, he'd succeeded.
"Well, you—I thought you would have decided you want to. He's alive, after all."
"How is it being back in hell?" Crowley asks.
"You know, Sammy, I'm glad I came and found you." Dean steps forward and gives him a hug. "Despite everything, I hope you know that." He gives a him pat on the back and steps away.
"Oh, Moose," his voice says from right behind him. Sam starts—he'd been pacing in the kitchen—and turns. "You've lived a good life, haven't you?"
Dean tries to smile, but his brow furrows as he looks down at his beer.
Cas smiles slightly at the demon's utter confusion and steps to the other side of the motorcycle, behind him. He points out the constellation again from over Dean's shoulder. "There are three stars, two brighter than the others, all close together right there."
"We—he escaped, sir."
He pulls out of the lot and onto the main road. It takes him a moment to get used to the gas and brake pedals, and using a steering wheel feels a bit weird, but there's nothing complicated about it. Riding a motorcycle certainly requires more expertise.
He swings a leg over his bike and kicks the stand back up, but he doesn't start it yet. He could summon Cas and construct a way to fake an angel's death or a way to lie to Crowley. He should summon Cas.
"Yes," Dean says, finally. "Yeah, I am. But honestly, what would this whole being human thing be if I weren't scared to die?"
Dean knows where it comes from. He still sees the disgusted or betrayed looks on his father’s face, still feels the bruises he’d leave in inconspicuous places. He still knows the weight of that shotgun in his hands, the smooth curve of the trigger against the pad of his finger.
“You need me to look something up for you?”
"Of course it means I'm evil," Crowley says as if he's just been insulted. "But even evil has standards. Besides, we had talked before and…I don't hate you. So I stopped Juliet. Simple as that."
He kneels by the door to scratch and hug them before going to the kitchen and pulling out a beer. He turns on the TV, but he can’t seem to pay attention to it. This is nothing new—he’s been feeling oddly distanced from his own life for weeks—but it seems to be getting worse. He only seems to feel alive at work, and even then, he can tell he’s not quite acting himself. He thinks Garth and Rufus can sense it, but neither of them has said anything.
It’s not often Cas decides against going into the Espresso Hive in the morning—he needs to get another batch of coffee roasting—but it’s pleasant and cool out and it’s almost too late in the year to plant peas and snapdragons.
"Oh, good," Sam says vaguely. "An angel. But why did you care? You were gonna kill me on a hunch, plus you're a demon. Doesn't that mean you're, like, evil?"
“Are you sure it’s not just that you can’t stand the thought of him putting himself in danger without you there to protect him?”
He’s still trying to come up with why Cas’s claim feels wrong to him when the curtain opens and Jack returns. Cas quickly stands from the bed
"I'm sorry," Cas says. He's starting to break into sobs. "I'm sorry."
"Then why did you pull over?"
“Essentially, yes.”
“To me, as a pilot, ‘Winchester’ meant ‘out of ammunition.’ Which is how I felt when I first met you. And often still how I feel when I’m around you. Dean Winchester.” He glances at Dean, then says, “I hope you have a short recovery. I’m sure we’ll see each other again soon.”
Dean can't hide his shock as he turns to see a familiar man in a trench coat approaching him. He lowers his cigarette. "Winchester? I—I haven't been called that in years. Not since…since I was a kid," he says slowly with a small frown. He's momentarily forgotten to be threatening.
"We're very in-sync."
Dean raises his eyebrows and sets his glass of whiskey aside. He’s been drinking since ten this morning, but he’s still not drunk enough to be ready for this conversation.
"Sure." Dean revs the engine and swings the motorcycle in a tight arc to face the way he must have come. Then he turns his head slightly back to look toward Cas. "Anything else to say, Angel?"
It's in Cas's nature to try to keep him awake, keep checking on him. Come on, Dean. Keep your eyes open. Stay with me. Stay with me…. Instead he has to watch him start to slip away.
"I don't know," Dean sighs, and it's probably the most honest three words Cas has heard out of him yet.
They take him for more imaging, which takes about fifteen minutes in total, then he’s returned to his room. He’s alone for a few minutes before the curtain opens again, and he expects it to be his brother or another nurse, but it isn’t.
“Well, that or it’ll kill him, who’s to say?” He sips his whiskey. “I suggest you get moving. The clock is ticking. Oh, except you might want this.” He stands and goes to an antique wooden desk in the corner, opening a drawer and pulling out a sheathed knife. “Silly me, I almost forgot.”
“I think we’re going to skip dessert. We’ll see you at dinner,” Castiel announced, standing abruptly as soon as the plates were cleared, pulling Dean with him.
“I’m gonna kill him.” Dean envisioned all the ways he could do it with the things at hand. A golf club, for instance.
had a car. He worried about Baby sitting in long term airport parking and not for the first time wished he could have driven here.
. And of course, who else would it be?” Castiel said with his signature brand of seriousness, like it was normal for a grown man to make a stuffed animal talk, and Dean snorted. There was still this weird tension between them that hadn’t been there before (not surprising given the fact they went from friends to friends with benefits almost over night), making the world feel like it had shifted on its axis, but they were joking like they always had and it eased a tightness in Dean’s chest.
Dean’s perfectly vanilla. He’s a man of simple tastes when it comes to his bedroom activities; he’s never felt the need to see the women he’s in bed with tied up, doesn’t need to spank them or order them around or pull their hair. Some of them expect him to; he knows his bad boy image sometimes attracts a certain type of women who want that kind of thing, but he makes up for it by applying himself to the art of pleasing a woman and being the very best lover he can be. He’ll ask them for instructions on how best to please them with his fingers or his mouth; he’ll let them sit on his face and grind against him, pushing his head heavily into the pillow for as long as they need to reach an orgasm (or more) as he applies his tongue diligently despite an aching jaw.
"It would be cool to see the aurora sometime while we're here," Dean said. He wasn't sure why he said it, exactly; he'd never told anyone that he'd wanted to see it since childhood, and he hadn't thought about it in forever. "Sam says they've seen it a couple of times."
how he wishes he did – but he doesn’t. There’s nothing he can say to make this right.
"Little help here?" Dean asked. "They can't – they – we, um."
Cas’s eyes widen for a moment, and then he’s bending down and Dean realises that he’s
“You don’t get to decide what’s best for me, Cas. I don’t need you to protect me. I just need you.”
“You’re lucky I do,” Cas murmured against his lips – and Dean couldn’t do anything but agree. He fumbled a hand into his pocket, feeling the small velvet box there like he had several times already during their Christmas vacation, never quite working up the nerve to do what he’d planned.
"So the needle doesn't puncture the skin on your other thigh," Cas explains, voice soft and intimate. Dean doesn't know if there's any important reason for it; it's not like his skin isn't being punctured anyway, but he appreciates being able to anticipate the pain.
"That's it," Dean grumbled, wiping his face and taking cover again as Bobby did the same. They went for it with renewed effort, sticking their heads up just long enough to get an accurate aim, and then ducking down again immediately.
"You. It’s always been you," Cas breathes, as unafraid to speak the truth now as he was in the moments before the Empty took him. Dean's glad, because it makes it easier to say what he's about to say next.
Cas pauses, his back turned to Dean. “What would you even say, Dean?” His voice is laced with weariness and the same vulnerability that was present in Dean’s own voice. He turns around, and Dean can’t even begin to try to identify the layers of emotions on his face. “What can be said at this point? ‘I need you’? ‘You’re family’?” Cas’s voice turns steadily colder, and Dean recognizes it for what it is:  Cas is protecting himself, protecting his emotions. “I think those arguments are beginning to grow old, don’t you? After all, there is only so much sincerity you can read into those words once you’ve been told you’re dead to someone.”
“Don’t be so dramatic, dear.” She bore down on them, clicking across the tile. “I would also advise you to be careful what you say. Your family will always be there for you, but how long do you think this relationship is going to last? It’s a youthful indiscretion that has been going on for, what? A matter of months?”
, he thought. “Is Dean leaving? So soon?”
“Really?” He sounded smug, the bastard.
Castiel stepped back and Dean wanted to snap at him to get the fuck back where he’d been, but he swallowed the words. Castiel’s eyebrows slowly crept up his forehead. “Are you asking if I’m a top or a bottom, Dean?”
Castiel indicated the way out of the terminal with a nod of his head. Dean had never been in an airport as big as Logan before. The one time he’d been on a plane was when Bobby’s friend Rufus decided he was going to get his pilot’s license and took Dean and his brother up on a prop plane out of the municipal airport. He remembered sitting frozen the entire time, hand fisted in the back of Sam’s shirt while the young beta whooped with glee beside him, the fear his brother would tumble out the door riding him hard.
He looked to see if Castiel was joking, but he should have known after this long that a lot of things flew over the alpha’s head. “I meant, like, bring your own date.”
If Dean had been hoping they could sneak out without anyone knowing it went up in smoke when the sound of heels hit the tile of the entryway before they even opened the front door.
“Yeah, whatever.”
“Hey,” he offered with a wink, and she giggled, a flush stealing over the slopes of her freckled cheeks.
“Nah.” Dean pushed to his feet, paced the length of the room before realizing he had nowhere to go and finally leaned against the edge of the desk, hands shoved in his pockets. His phone was still glaringly silent and his smile felt rigid. “I was just gonna stay here. Bobby’s out on a long haul and Sam is going on some camping trip with his girlfriend and her folks.”
“Shame you have such a small family.”
Once Dean had them back on the road, hetirned his hand up in silent invitation on the console, something settling inside when Castiel threaded their fingers together.
thinking about it, Cas.”
“The family trip to Martha’s Vineyard. Omega daughter of one of my mom’s friend’s from the country club.”  Castiel rolled his eyes so hard, Dean half expected them to pop out and roll across the floor. “The families hope we’ll hit it off, which is my mother’s way of saying the marriage contract is all but signed.”
Castiel blinked at the stuffed alpaca. “Is that…?”
He melted under Castiel’s lips when the alpha climbed back on the bed, barely hearing the crinkle of the condom wrapper or the pop of the lube bottle opening. Getting his hands on Castiel was more important. The muscles of Castiel’s back flexed under Dean’s fingers and Castiel pressed Dean deeper into the mattress when Dean gripped one firm cheek and squeezed.
“It’s an alpaca farm." Castiel leaned his arms over the top of the wooden fence once they were out of the car and Dean took a spot right next to him. "I used to have the chauffeur take me here when my parents were too busy to spend time with me.”
“Should you be hitting on her? We’re supposed to be pretending to be a couple, Dean.”
She looked like she wanted to say something, but she kept quiet as she followed them to the door. Castiel only let go of his hand to open the trunk of the car. Dean did something he had been wanting to do since he met her. Looking at her dead in the eye, he said, “Fuck you.”
Diane came back with Castiel’s key and her phone number written on a Post-it. “Call me,” she mouthed then led them outside, but Dean wasn’t feeling it anymore. He nodded, not wanting to be a dick, but he dropped the crumpled up paper in the trashcan when she turned to lead them outside.
“I haven’t met a mom yet that I can’t charm,” he said with a smirk.
He buried his face in Castiel’s shoulder and let everything else fade away.
“Yeah, you know. Fix cars, do some restoration work. I built my own car from an empty shell when I was a teenager.”
“That was rude, Dean,” he said, holding the stuffed animal in front of his face, voice rising a few octaves.
“I won’t last long,” Castiel grunted, starting to lose his rhythm. That was fine. Dean was standing on the edge of a precipice, all he needed to tip over was—
“I love Dean. And if you can’t accept that, then you can’t accept me.”
. You’ve never been and the sun set looks amazing from here.”
“I don’t want you regretting this later.”
They locked gazes, waging a silent battle that Dean didn’t understand but he would be damned if he backed down first even if he did kind of feel like shit for some unknown reason. He hadn’t done anything wrong, damnit. Ultimately, Castiel put an end to it himself, taking half a step back and looking off to the side. He wiped a hand across the stubble on his chin. “Sorry. It’s been a long day.”
“Helping you with your form.”
“I lied,” Castiel whispered. Standing so close, Dean had no problem hearing him and he stared at the back of Castiel’s head in surprise.
Spending time with Castiel’s family honestly sounded like entering one of the levels of hell, but might be better than wandering around campus like one of the other pathetic kids who didn’t have a home to go back to. Plus, it was a free vacation. Dean didn’t know where the hell Martha’s Vineyard was, but it sounded fancy. Dean had been taking the other alpha out to bars since they both got legal, teaching him how to slum it. This could be his only chance to get a glimpse at the kind of life Castiel grew up in.
“Mother, what is this?” Castiel asked, rounding on her. Dean reached for the folder, but stopped midway when Castiel’s hand gripped his wrist. “You don’t need to open that. My mother is just playing one of her games.” His eyes were narrowed in a fierce look Dean had never seen on the alpha’s face before.
“You’re my favorite brother,” the beta exclaimed.
The gentle rocking of Castiel’s hips might have frustrated Dean if Castiel hadn’t shifted his angle until every thrust was pressing against that spot that sent pleasure rocketing from the tips of his toes to the top of his head.
Castiel worked slow, one finger turning into two, whispering against Dean’s ear about how beautiful he was and how good he was being and how much he loved him. Then Castiel brushed something inside him and fireworks went off behind Dean’s closed eyelids.
“Let me,” Castiel asked, the beginnings of a growl rumbling in his chest. Dean would let Castiel do anything the alpha wanted if Castiwl kept touching him like that. His pants and boxers were slid off, Dean lifting his hips off the bed to help divest himself of the last of his clothes.
“Shut up,” he snapped, the tips of his ears going red, on the verge of squirming and Castiel hadn’t even touhed him yet, for fuck’s sake.
He turned his head, noticing how close their eyes were, feeling breathless like one of the omegas in the supermarket romances his mom read when he was a kid. He’d taken one of them once and kept it in his room, hiding under the covers to read it by flashlight when he should have been sleeping. His dad had been pissed when he found out how his oldest spent his alone time.
Dean’s fist curled. He’d never hit her, no matter how much of a raging bitch she was, but he wanted to, smelling the way Castiel’s scent soured.
Dean was shaking when they disembarked and the flight attendants, all smiles for everyone else, glared when he rushed by. He could hear Castiel thanking them and apologizing behind him, but ignored it in favor of walking farther from the gate and leaning against a column to catch his breath.
“It depends on the situation and what my partner and I decide on.” Castiel paused, and it gave Dean a moment to digest that before adding,  “Why?”
“You would do that?”
“You trying to get in my pants?” He meant it to sound sarcastic, but was afraid he missed by a mile.
Once they landed, Dean stumbled out on shaking legs, ignoring Sam’s exclamations about “Wasn’t that fun? It was so fun! Dean?
“And I thought he had a right to know.”
“Mother, just let it go,” Balthazar sighed.
“Yeah, his name’s Sam. He’s in high school. Smart as hell.” He was bragging because whatever. He was proud of the little jerk. Dean kept one ear on Castiel’s talking to his brothers about someone they saw at the country club that Gabriel had gone to school with.
“Dean—” Castiel tried to close the space between them, but a shout from the other side of the trees stopped him.
. He didn’t think Castiel had it in him, but he was learning all sorts of new things about his friend.
“Here,” Balthazar sighed. Dean didn’t know what was going on, but whatever the alpha passed over made Gabriel happy.
“Here,” he said and thrust it forward.
She hummed and took another sip. Dean felt uneasy at how objectively not shitty she was being, but shook it off when the maid came in to tell them dinner was ready. The sooner the night was over the better. They marched to the dining room in silence, Castiel a solid wall at his side.
“Her little angel baby finally grew a pair,” Gabriel sniggered. “About damn time.”
“Why were you running a background check at all?” Castiel growled low in his chest. “You had no right. This is my life.”
She rang him up and Dean only winced a little when he swiped his card, hiding the present behind his back before walking outside. Castiel spun around when the bell over the door chimed. “Dean, what were you—”
Shoulders slumped, he stared at Dean morosely, stubble shadowing his normally clean shaven cheeks. “They found me a date.”
Castiel smiled at her warmly and took her proffered hand. “Please, Diane, for the thousandth time, call me Castiel.”
“How do you know?”
“I'm not some blushing virgin. You don't have to be gentle with me,” he argued. He choked on anything else he might have said at the firm grip Castiel took of his dick. “Oh, fuck.”
Ah, crap. He hadn’t meant to blurt it out like that. He opened his mouth, ready to laugh it off, say “Psych, dude,” but when he looked at Castiel there was hope sparking in his eyes and Dean wasn’t that much of an asshole.
The car waiting for them soured his mood even more. “Oh, hell no.”
“Did you fail all your midterms or something?” he asked, kicking his legs over the side of the bed and sitting up. He let his hands dangle between his thighs, eyebrows shooting up when the only response he got was a groan. Castiel couldn’t actually have failed all of his midterms. Or at least if he did, he wouldn’t know yet. Grades weren’t due until after spring break and most profs didn’t get them in until the last minute. “What the hell, man?”
. He almost thought he could still taste the alpha on his tongue.
“No. I don’t—” The way Castiel said his name left him flustered. “I guess, I am,” he said to the ground.
“Get over here and show me how to hit this stupid ball.” If he wished for it to peg Gabriel in the head, no one would blame him. No one.
“My parents,” came the muffled reply.
Dean knew an interrogation when he was on the receiving end of one. He slowly cut a piece of steak and shrugged, answering while he chewed. “I get by.”
Ouch, that was rough. Being stuck with the same person for the rest of your life, one you hadn’t even picked yourself sounded like hell. The solution seemed simple to him, though. He shrugged and flopped back against his pillow, picking up where he left off. “Don’t go.”
“If I hadn’t brought you here,” he started and Dean cut him off.
Dean shook his hand free and opened the folder. Whatever was in there wouldn’t matter, he was sure. He shuffled through the papers, pausing when he saw the photos inside. It had been years since Dean had laid eyes on John Winchester and the alpha was older, greying at the temples and softer around the middle. That wasn’t what had a lump lodging in his throat.
“You should play through, Don. I think this is going to take a while,” Chuck was saying to some prick wearing beige shorts and plaid socks. “I’ll see you at the clubhouse after.” He lowered his voice, but it was still audible to Dean who was stalking off into the trees, when he added, “If we ever get there.”
Dean wanted to stay in the moment forever, the hard lines of Castiel’s body beneath him, feeling how tightly the other alpha held onto him like he was afraid this was a dream and Dean was going to disappear. But the need to breathe forced them to come up for air.
outside and Dean took what felt like his first deep breath since they left campus for the airport at the ass crack of dawn. Dean followed Castiel toward one of the waiting airport shuttles and when he noticed the Enterprise logo emblazoned across the side, Dean turned his head and raised a brow in question.
A firm grip of his shoulder had aggression draining out of him like water. “Don’t pout,” Castiel said and moved behind him.
“Because I— I need you, Cas.” It was as close as he could come to the words burning the back of his throat. He wasn’t ready to say them yet, but he could do this. Laying it on thick, and maybe playing a little mean, Dean nipped at the corner of Castiel’s mouth. “Don’t make me beg.”
Dean thought he understood them just fine. Castiel’s parents were control freaks, more worried about appearances than their own kid’s happiness. “So, bring someone else.”
“It came up in a routine background check—”
Attention caught by the bulge swelling behind Castiel’s fly, Dean didn’t let himself think twice about nuzzling it. His tongue left a wet patch on the dark fabric and he groaned at the richness or Castiel’s scent this close, drunk on it.
“So, Dean,” the sound of Naomi saying his name made Dean fumble his fork, “what do your parents do?”
He wanted Castiel’s parents to—not
If it made him shut up, Dean would almost say Balthazar was his favorite, too. Except Balthazar hadn’t smiled at him after he got dressed, saying how good he thought Dean looked in green because it brought out his eyes. Dean’s ears had gone hot. He’d murmured a “Shut up” before grabbing his jacket. Or given him the best blow job of his life after they woke up.
That hadn’t been what Dean expected. Maybe he should leave, it would be better for everyone. He opened his mouth, but no words came out and closed his lips, swallowing before he could force words out. “If that’s what you want.”
“Where’re we going?” Dean asked, feet moving anyway.
All Dean could think about was what Castiel would look like jerking off and how close he was to coming. “Cas,” he croaked, tugging at Castiel’s hair. “Stop.”
“More,” he demanded. He clutched at Castiel, found the other alpha’s dick, so hard that it had to be aching the same way Dean’s was. It was like the world centered on where Castiel was touching him. He had never felt this… this—
“Why would anyone do that?”
Castiel let his shirt fall to the ground and kicked his shoes to the side then knelt down to unlace Dean’s boots. He flowed back up Dean’s body like water, slipping the fingers of one hand into Dean’s hair, nipping at Dean’s lips, moving them up the bed until he could lay Dean out in the middle of it. Hands on Castiel’s hips, Dean stared up the other alpha straddling one of his thighs. The blue of his eyes was almost swallowed up by inky black pupils. “What?”
“No, Diane, we’re fine,” Castiel assured. She was all too happy to scurry off. Dean felt Castiel’s gaze boring into the side of his face while he worked his jaw, locked in a standoff with a hunk of metal.
“Not another word from either of you,” Naomi snarled, eyes flashing red when she rounded on Castiel. “If you walk out that door, don’t bother coming back.”
, he wasn’t an idiot, but…
Castiel’s lips thinned. “You haven’t met mine.”
“You’ve never seen the ocean?”
Okay, he might have asked if they were going to crash whenever they hit turbulence, but that couldn’t have been the first time that happened. It was better after Castiel bought him a few drinks and let him squeeze his hand so hard Dean knew it had to hurt, but he was glad to have both of his feet back on solid ground.
“Yeah, and?”
Dean cleared his throat and shoved his hands in his pockets. “Don’t make a big deal about it.”
Dean also just had what was probably a terrible idea. “I’ll do it.”
“We’re going back to school, Mother. After what you did—”
“I’m fine.” He adjusted his duffle over his shoulder. “How do we get out of here?”
“I’m just trying to help. Family is so important, don’t you think?”
“Well, if you’re sure,” Castiel said, sounding hesitant. “My family isn’t the easiest to deal with.”
Wait, what? “We’re flying?”
“Yes. Let’s go.” Castiel hugged him. Dean let himself return the gesture because damn if it didn’t feel good. “I didn’t even want to come here in the first place,” Castiel said, the words muffled against Dean’s shoulder, “I should have just said no. I’m sorry.”
“Dean.” Castiel’s voice was gravely and it went right to Dean’s dick. He dug his fingers into Castiel’s thighs when the other alpha said his name again. Dean wanted him to keep saying it, just like that, over and over. He grunted in displeasure when his head was pulled back by his hair, eyes opening to find Castiel staring down at him, looking too serious for a guy who was about to get his rocks off. “If I do anything you don’t like, you tell me. Immediately.”
“Castiel? I thought you were going to miss breakfast. Oh,” Naomi said when her eyes landed on Dean standing at her son’s side. She sounded genuinely surprised to see Dean was still there. The smile he flashed was mean and he tightened his grip on Castiel’s hand.
“Not whatever,” Castiel gritted, holding Dean in place when he tried to dive back into his dick, mouth first. “I’m serious, Dean. I don’t want to hurt you. Promise me.”
“Yeah.” Castiel glanced up at Dean’s silence. “Is something wrong?”
“I don’t know if I could lie to my family that way,” Castiel said. Wow, they really grew up different, didn't they? Dean used to lie to Bobby all the time so he could go make out with someone in the back seat of his car. Hadn’t given it a second thought.
Dean had a feeling he knew what the answer would be, but asked anyway. “We can’t skip dinner, can we?” Dean stood before Castiel had a chance to tell him no. “Little rebellion? No? Forget I said anything.”
and get to the
“Oh.” He was a little disappointed. Which was ridiculous. He didn’t want to have sex with Castiel. How would that even work? Like he knew how it
Nothing Castiel did to his body could ever hurt as much as the pain he felt inside, but he nodded for Castiel’s sake. “I promise, Cas.”
They were only standing in line for a few moments before a beta in a navy suit, hugging curves that put the Aston Martin to shame, rushed forward. Suddenly today wasn’t looking so bad. “Mr. Novak-Shurley, it’s so nice to see you again.”
“No.” He wrenched his eyes away from how good the alpha looked in tight khaki pants and a polo shirt. Another swing resulted in nothing but more damage to the foliage, but it gave him something to do with his hands besides grabbing Castiel.
Dean didn’t point out that they weren’t expecting
“You realize how sad that is, right?” Dean deadpanned, but his heart broke thinking of a young Castiel being so lonely that he came here by himself.
“I think I’m getting a headache,” she said and put a hand to her temple. “Really, Castiel, let’s sit down and discuss this.”
Okay, maybe he had been thinking about it. In the hypothetical sense. He was a red blooded alpha and he still smelled like Castiel and Castiel still smelled like
He pointed a finger at his friend and smirked. He was being a dick, but he couldn’t stop the words coming out of his mouth. “Probably a good bet.”
The beach was dim, lit only by the moon and the lights from the back porch. It was enough for Dean to see Naomi staring at them with a pinched expression. He didn’t know how much she had seen and hated her that much more for intruding, but he sat up, pulling Castiel with him and nodded toward the house. “Uh, we got company.”
“A garage?” If she’d had pearls, she would have been clutching them.
“Wait, wait,” Dean scrambled after him, snagging his jeans off the floor before rounding the bed and halting Castiel in the middle of packing with a hand on his arm. “Stop. You don’t owe me anything. This isn’t your fault.”
. Not like it was easy to get there. “Bobby was gone a lot and we didn’t have money for vacations.”
“Oh, Stan! You should come meet my youngest,” Chuck said loudly. “He’s graduating soon. I’m sure he could do some great things at your company.”
He wondered sometimes if this whole college thing was a good idea when he couldn’t even manage to talk to his brother for ten minutes once a week. It was just bullshit instinct stuff. He knew that. Sam and Bobby were both betas. It was hard to quiet down the alpha part of his brain that worried about leaving his pack. Bobby tried feeding him some bull about abandonment issues a few years back after Dean got freaked when Bobby was late coming home from a haul. He worried about his family not coming home. He wasn’t a little bitch, sitting at home, biting his nails. He just didn’t think it was too much to ask for a freaking text now and then.
She slammed the door and nothing had ever felt that good, except when he turned and Castiel said, “Let’s go home.”
It was playing dirty, but Dean was desperate. He could see the effect the words had on the other alpha. Castiel’s voice went even lower. “That isn’t the point. If you still feel the same later then we can revisit this. My mother shouldn’t—”
The shower was spacious, but neither Dean nor Castiel were small and they bumped elbows a few times before Castiel told Dean to stay still. It was easier than he thought it should be to let Castiel take the washcloth from his hand and run it across his skin. Even easier still to let him rub it across his junk, watching the water caress Castiel’s skin before he needed to do it himself.
“You okay?” The concern in the alpha’s eyes dug under his skin like nails. He wasn’t about to talk about his
“I should have worn something nicer,” Dean groused, quiet enough that only Castiel could hear. He did up the buttons of his Henley, then felt like an idiot and popped them back out.
Dean’s skin flushed. Gabriel loved to be inappropriate and piss people off. The comment hit too close to home given what he and Castiel had been talking about.
“You realize that’s sad, right?” Castiel said, throwing Dean’s earlier words back at him. Dean picked up Kiwi and threw it at his face. Castiel caught it and turned big eyes onto Dean, clutching it to his chest.
at the companies of any of these asshats. Castiel would be the one telling them how their company was destroying the planet. He’d made no less than four comments about how golf courses were so environmentally unfriendly. And that was just
sign tacked to the fence in front of the spaces. He could just see the fields beyond and the weird creatures roaming through them. “Where the hell are we?”
“We’ll be late for lunch and you know how your mother is,” Chuck admonished. The matriarch had air kissed her sons and husband in front of the club house before disappearing inside. He could only thank God for small favors that the Mrs. didn’t golf.
“It’s pretty easy. You just say ‘Hey, mom and dad, this is my boyfriend or girlfriend I conveniently forgot to tell you about. Love of my love and all that.’ Make kissy faces at each other for a week, then after a few months tell the folks you broke up, it’s very tragic. You’ll be heartbroken. Should buy you some time.” Point made, Dean started tossing the ball again. He was handing the other alpha an out. “If whoever you rope into this happens to be someone who would piss off your folks, that’s just a bonus.”
“You’re such a dork,” Dean said. He didn’t think about leaning over and kissing Castiel’s cheek, his lips were pressed against the alpha’s five o’clock shadow. It felt natural and that scared him. He had to turn away from Castiel’s wide eyes (asking questions Dean didn’t have answers to. Yet.) and parted lips (looking entirely too kissable, giving him thoughts he shouldn’t be having in public, let alone a petting zoo.) and noticed something in the window of the gift shop. “Be right back. Stay there.”
“Is there anything else you need?” Diane asked, nervousness an undercurrent to her words. Guess she would be glad to never hear from Dean again after all. The alpha that drove the car up had already retreated in the face of the aggression stinking up his scent like burnt rubber.
was—they were better off without John Winchester, but it didn’t stop the hurt that your dad didn’t think you were worth his time—it was worth it.
“You’re not on the rental agreement,” he tried to argue, but Dean ignored him.
He wasn’t ready for that, didn’t know if he ever would be, but he was curious. About how much closer taking that part of Castiel too would make them. If it would fill the gaping wound in the middle of his chest or if this would be enough.
He slapped at the sand on his jeans,letting his shirt hang from his fist when Castiel handed it to him with an apologetic smile. He would go, but he didn’t have to be happy about it.
The ball hit the wall with a particularly hard
“Mother, what have you done?” Castiel asked into the silence that descended on the room. Dean didn’t give her a chance to reply. He grabbed Castiel’s arm and dragged the other alpha behind him, not stopping until they were enclosed in the bedroom they were using.
“You don’t— Cas, come on.” His roommate continued to stare at him in incomprehension, head tilted to the side like a puppy. Dean sighed. He couldn’t find it in himself to be annoyed at that face. “Find someone, anyone, and ask them to pretend you’re dating for a week.”
“Because it’s true. I wanted to make sure you know before—”
The sounds of the awkward small talk faded to the background, all of Dean’s focus on the place where Castiel touched him. A waiter brought their food. Dean poked at a pile of mashed potatoes with a fork, mind a mess of confusion and recriminations.
Jesus Christ, Dean didn’t want to think about her. He snagged Castiel’s hand when the alpha went to leave. “I’ve been thinking about it. You know I have. I can’t
“Somewhere fun. It’s a surprise.” Castiel looked so damned excited that Dean couldn't be an ass about it. The possibility of anything in this town being fun was slim, but Dean threw his hands up and climbed in the passenger seat after Castiel took the keys back, watching the scenery whip by when they pulled onto the road.
The hand around his dick returned, stroking his length from root to tip. When a tongue joined the party, Dean saw stars. He was so lost in all the sensations that he almost didn’t notice when Castiel reached for something in the nightstand, settling back between Dean’s thighs with a bottle of lube. Dean’s eyebrows shot up. “You always have lube on hand?”
Triumph shot through him when Castiel’s lips crashed against his, fingers dipping beneath the waistband of his jeans. He got lost in the feeling, the taste of whiskey on Castiel’s tongue and didn’t realize the other alpha was herding him toward the bed until the backs of his knees bumped the mattress.
“Your family doesn’t have a car you can use?” Dean found that hard to believe. Even
Castiel froze and when she didn’t take back the words, he nodded, picking up his suitcase with the hand that wasn’t holding Dean’s. “Goodbye, mother.”
“This isn’t like you,” Naomi said, hard eyes on Dean.
Castiel rolled his eyes, but didn’t disagree. “I haven’t been here in years.”
“It’s supposed to be Kiwi. You said she was your favorite.” He sounded like an idiot saying it out loud, the feeling deepening the longer his arm hung in midair. “Forget it. It was a stupid idea.”
“Hey,” he croaked, voice rough from sleep and the sounds Castiel pulled from him the night before.
Hands moving to Dean’s thighs, Castiel sat up, brow furrowed in concern. “Are you alright?”
Dean woke to Castiel’s arms around him, feeling insulated from the bombshell the night before, and the bright blue of the alpha’s eyes was the first thing he saw.
There was one thing that he knew would work. Old habits die hard, but it would be different this time because it was
“Are you a catcher or a pitcher?” He really had to stop blurting shit out. It never worked out for him, especially not when Castiel was involved.
Dean blinked at Castiel’s erection laying against his thigh, but mentally shrugged it off. He’d been preoccupied. He pulled his eyes away and met Castiel’s gaze. Worry still pinched Castiel’s lips. He wasn’t as nervous as he thought he would be, but there was still a thread of anxiety pulled taught, and Castiel looking at him like that wasn’t helping. Bravado had always worked for Dean before, though, so he gave the other alpha a crooked smile, letting his legs fall open further. “Come and get it.”
“Nope,” Dean said, but his voice cracked. He cleared his throat and tried again. “No. That’s— totally cool.”
“Of course not,” Castiel answered seriously, face fixed in concentration as he used Dean’s hands to move the club and instructed him how to bend his knees.
don’t,” Gabriel countered.
Wrapped around Dean as he was, it was easy for Castiel to swivel both their hips to bring Dean’s arms back. He huffed, “I meant like in the sex way, Cas.”
Dean shifted his hips hoping to relieve some of the tightness in his jeans, but it didn’t help.
The steady
“Why the hell not?” he asked around a sound between a scoff and a laugh.
. He would have asked why they were even here if Castiel hated golf courses so much but he knew the answer.
“You don’t understand my family.” Castiel laid down on his own bed, arms at his sides, and stared at the ceiling. It was a sad sight.
“I’m fine.” He was getting sick of hearing Castiel ask him that.
He shouldn’t be surprised. His brother had his first girlfriend, an alpha named Eileen, the only details Dean was able to drag out of his brother the last time they talked. Dean knew what that whole first love thing was like. It gave you tunnel vision. What teenager wanted to do something lame like talk to their older brother when they could make out with someone cute?
Dean’s eyebrows shot up. “For what?”
Dean, who up til then had been ignored, leaned his elbow against the counter and let one corner of his mouth curl up when he caught Diane’s eyes. She did a double take, fumbling with Castiel’s license.
“I dunno. Money?” Wasn’t like the guy didn’t have any. He bought Dean dinner sometimes and they both pretended like Dean was actually going to be able to pay him back.
“I’ll be late for the nineteenth hole,” Gabriel whined.
“But Amelia—”
Pinks and oranges were just starting to paint the sky when they strolled back toward the car. “I think Kiwi was my favorite.” Castiel angled his phone toward Dean, showing him a selfie, Castiel’s hair blending in with the dark brown fur of the alpaca. “I’m making this my profile picture on facebook.”
“Hurry up,” Dean grunted. He plante a foot and bucked harder, trying to goad Castiel into moving things along.
His knees were a little weak and he rubbed his face. A tentative hand touched his shoulder and he would have known it was Castiel even if he hadn’t caught his scent, like forests and summer storms. Letting his hands drop, he glanced over his shoulder.
The mystery became even more… well, mysterious, when they came home and saw that Eileen's car was gone. They locked themselves into the house, and… everyone was gone.
sexuality.
Cas laid a hand on Dean's forearm, squeezing it gently. "No. You're everything to me."
bed,” Dean argues, but his tone is soft, warm. “But… yeah. I’d like that.” His expression shifts, and then he adds, “Wait, did you just angel-marry us?”
. If Dean was in Cas’s body right now, then it stood to reason that Cas was in Dean’s body, which was currently… “Son of a bitch,” he said, because if any situation really deserved the phrase, this was it.
There’s no darkness behind the windows, nor is there anything covering them up or shrouding them, yet Dean still can’t see through them.
Dean blinked his eyes open at the feeling of someone running their hand through his hair. He was too sleepy to realise where he for a second, but… that wasn't a pillow beneath his head; it wasn't soft enough. It was… a shoulder. Cas's shoulder. And that was Cas's hand in his hair. Dean closed his eyes and leaned into it like a cat, not yet awake enough to realise what he was doing until he heard Cas huff a quiet laugh. He opened his eyes again and reluctantly removed his head from Cas's shoulder, blushing and looking at the screen rather than at Cas. The movie had ended, and he had no idea how long ago.
“I’m sorry.” Cas knows it’s not exactly his fault, but it still hurts to know he’s causing Dean pain.
"Who's delusional?"
“Say it again,” Cas tells him.
Cas allowed her to pull him over to where Dean was standing. "So I see."
There’s an intake of breath that Cas feels more than he hears it. “Cas, I don’t know if we should…”
Sometimes he doesn’t even fuck them afterwards, but when he does, he’s more than happy for the woman to sit on top, in control so she can take her own pleasure from his body. He always holds back so he doesn’t come before she does. A couple of times, the woman he’s been with has been too caught up in her own orgasm to notice that he hasn’t come – probably used to men who always finish first – but he doesn’t mind, as long as he knows that he’s managed to bring her pleasure.
Dean felt kind of breathless. It didn't necessarily mean anything, not anything romantic anyway, but he was still unable to control the wild hope that had his heart thumping faster in his chest.
“Nah.” Benny grins. “I’ve had you before. Wanna see you ride that angel of yours.”
The next time, it’s Cas who gets propositioned. Clueless as always, he doesn’t realise that the blonde is trying to get his attention until Dean tells him and encourages him to go talk to her. She looks to be somewhere in her fifties, still smoking hot and clearly on the prowl, and Dean would have gotten cougar vibes from her if Cas had been about a gazillion times younger than he actually is.
When Cas’s suit jacket is gone, Dean begins loosening the knot of his tie. It may be weird that he likes to fix Cas’s clothing in whatever way is suitable for any given occasion, but Cas has never questioned it before, nor does he do so now – so when Cas’s tie is draped over the back of the recliner, Dean continues with his shirt buttons. “This isn’t just… you
"Shit, Cas. You close?" Dean tried to hold on. He wanted to share the moment with Cas, but it was hard not to let go.
They were rubbing against each other again, slower this time, but Dean wanted something else. He stilled their movements with a hand on Cas's hip and then let it travel between their bodies in search of its destination.
“Holy fuck,” Donna moans as Cas sinks into her from behind, giving Dean an excellent view of his dick sliding in and out of her, and while he kinda wants to laugh at her unintended pun, he also can’t help but agree.
Sam raised his hands in denial while he grinned. "I swear, I had nothing to do with it. The kids asked me if they could have five dollars to buy something for you and Cas."
The kids were waiting in front of the Christmas tree, a present each on their lap when Dean and Cas came out of their room, and Sam and Eileen were there too. Dean guessed that Eileen knew already; there was a glint in her eye as she greeted them that gave away her amusement, but mostly she just looked happy. Happy for them. Dean appreciated it, and he hoped it showed in his own expression.
Sam still looked awfully amused, though, and when Dean saw Eileen's eyes glimmer with amusement as well, and took in the kids' gleeful expressions, he held back a laugh that wanted to escape. Instead, he rolled his eyes, but he nonetheless picked Bobby up and lifted him, allowing him to hang the sprig of mistletoe there along with the decoration, and then he blew a raspberry on the boy's cheek, making him shriek and giggle. "There. That's your kiss."
"So," Dean said, careful not to move his hand off Cas's, but also trying not to be too obvious about leaving it there. "What do you want to watch, if not Dr. Sexy? You damn blasphemer," he huffed, trying to lighten up their conversation again.
It turned out he needn't have worried, because Cas grinned when he saw the gift, eyes crinkled and gums showing, and Dean was struck by how lucky he was that this amazing creature – this angel – wanted to be with
Cas, it seems, doesn’t find it weird that Dean is continuing the conversation from ten minutes earlier, nor has he forgotten what they were talking about.
Of course he wasn't that lucky. Being Sam and Eileen's kids and therefore smart as hell, they never let go of something until they figured it out. Charlie looked thoughtful for a moment, and then continued her line of reasoning: "But Leon has two uncles who live together, like you and Uncle Cas. And they're boyfriends."
"Will be fine," Cas reassured him, standing so close they were touching. "This doesn't take as much out of me as you might think. And I won't be needing my grace while we're here anyway. I can afford to show you this."
"Good morning, Dean." Eileen signed along with her spoken words. In the beginning, she hadn't signed when she spoke to Dean alone, but he'd asked her to so he could learn.
"'Cause you created green, right?"
Cas takes the pillow from him and places it next to his own before he takes Dean’s hand and pulls gently. “Hello, Dean,” he says with a smile, and that seems to be what it takes for Dean to relax and let Cas pull him as close as he’d like – which is to say, until they’re pressed against each other in an embrace.
Dean does think about it. He thinks about it while he waits for Cas, thinks about it when he sees Cas returning, thinks about it when Cas sits down next to him.
“The guy who was here with you earlier? He’s hot. He can watch.” No words make their way out of Dean’s mouth as he gapes at her, and she turns away with a smile and a wink over her shoulder. “Think about it, sweetheart.”
Maybe Cas was figuring things out on his own. Maybe he was using his fingers to get relief. Maybe Dean could just leave and–
"You kidding me?" Dean asked, glancing over at Cas, whose face was still pink. "I'll be lucky if I ever get into the mood again." He groaned and rolled over, pressing his face against the soft skin of Cas's throat, wanting to at least get one kind of intimacy even though the other kind was out the window right now.
The plagued look on Cas’s face morphed into something different—into a look of confusion, eyebrows drawn together.
think it was cool, and Cas felt mortified all of a sudden. “Is that not… do I not belong here?” He glanced around, once again only catching sight of colourful flags rather than his own monochrome-plus-purple one.
"What am I look— Oh." Dean went silent as a tendril of white, pale light started winding its way across the sky. It moved faster than Dean would have thought; he'd seen videos of it, but he'd always assumed they'd been sped up. Soon, the tendril became wider and brighter, and it changed its colour to green as it pulsed and swirled and grew, and several other broad strands appeared next to it, flickering and pulsating in sudden bursts.
Cas is confident Dean is wrong, but he doesn’t want to spend time arguing; if he’s right about this, there’s another, quicker way to convince Dean of his true feelings.
Dean has to fight Cas’s hold on his hair to lean forward, making more tears spring to his eyes, but then their lips meet and Dean feels like he’s flying. He almost doesn’t notice it when Cas releases him to get his pants open, but he certainly notices when Cas’s hand is inside his boxers, wrapped around him. Even as good as it feels, Dean breaks the kiss and pushes weakly at Cas. “No, I don’t need – Cas, I want to make you feel good.”
“What’s the difference? ’Cause I’ll tell you, Cas, the way I feel about you? I’m pretty sure that’s how old, married people feel about each other, long after the hormonal honeymoon phase is over. Y’know, all deep, abiding love and security and shit. And I gotta say, spending the rest of my life with you…” Dean’s lips twitch up. “Sounds pretty awesome to me. Hell, I don’t think I can even imagine living to a ripe old age without you.”
He pushed that thought aside. He didn't want to worry about anything right now; he just wanted to stand there with Cas and look at the beauty of the landscape outside. The snow. The trees. The dark blue, almost black, sky studded with bright stars.
From anyone else, Dean might have interpreted it as a suggestive question, but Cas meant it genuinely, and a fondness for him rose in Dean's chest. "I don't know. Go outside, maybe?" He stepped closer and put his hands on Cas's shoulders, just wanting to touch him now that he was finally allowed. "We could make snow angels," he suggested teasingly.
Finally, Dean shrugs, a defeated look in his eyes as they meet Cas’s. “What do you want me to say, Cas?”
“Every year?” Cas asked with wonder in his eyes and a smile on his lips. “Are you saying you see us celebrating New Year’s together when we’re old?”
"Children, behave," Eileen said, although she, too, looked amused. "Just because two men are attracted to other men, that doesn't mean they
"Merry Christmas, Dean," Cas said against his lips, and Dean hummed into the kiss.
Dean followed his gaze to find Charlie, Mary, Sam, Jody and Claire watching them with interest – and those were only the ones he could see at first glance. “Oh, god.” He hid his rapidly reddening face behind his free hand, but he couldn’t help but join Cas in laughing. “Yeah, we’re not doing this here.”
"That's true, it doesn't matter who you fall in love with. But… not all men can fall in love with other men. Most men only like women that way. And most women only like men." He knew what he was setting himself up for here. There just didn't seem to be any way around it.
“What the hell,” he mumbles before downing the rest of his drink and slamming the glass down on the table. “Let’s go.”
"That's… that's what you are, Cas. You're… I keep thinking of you as if you were human, but you're… I mean, we should be like frickin' ants to you."
It’s not an outright yes, and it wasn’t an outright proposal, but Cas has no doubt, as Dean kisses him once more and pulls him to his bedroom, that sometime in the future he’ll get to call Dean his husband. Again.
“One of the, uh. The waitresses asked if I wanted to come home with her after her shift. Hah.” If only Dean’s laugh would come out natural, he’d do a much better job of conveying that there was no Reaction to the waitress’s words. “And she, uh. She said you could come along and, uh. Hrm.” The last word sticks to Dean’s tongue, and he has to force it out. “Watch.” Dean begins to fiddle with the suddenly very interesting label of his beer bottle. The silence stretches out, and if Cas is waiting for Dean to meet his eyes, he’s going to have to wait a long time.
The nurse gives a short nod. “I’ll go and get a doctor. You’ll need to be examined now that you’re awake.”
There are five more needles, each one higher up on the inside of Dean's thigh and – unless it's just Dean's imagination due to the increasing closeness to his junk – each one offering a sharper pain, and with it, a feeling of sinking further into the depths of his mind, of detaching from his senses and floating away from Cas.
. Still, it’s not the worst thing, drinking and having fun with some of the people who mean the most to him.
“I’m ready,” he says, because Cas has paused his movements, waiting for Dean to get out of his head.
“Not to me, you don’t,” Sam snorted. “Maybe to the angel whose body you’re borrowing, though.”
and –"
His heart jumped when Cas leaned in to kiss him, answering his question without words. “Mm. Gotcha,” Dean mumbled between kisses that started off sweet and turned gradually more heated as Dean started leaking more slick and they became more aware of their scents mingling again.
"Of course we do, Dean. Since when have you and I never worried about each other when the other one might be in danger?"
Cas shakes his head. He wishes he could offer Dean something; some memory of their life before. “I heard you say each other’s names. I didn’t even remember my own until the nurse said it – Castiel Winchester.”
The toys were more appreciated than the clothes, of course, which was just how it should be, in Dean's opinion. Kids should be so used to always having enough clothes that fit and weren't old and worn out that they didn't
Cas still looked genuinely amused at the kids' curiosity, but he didn't seem to have an answer for the question right away, meeting Dean's eyes in silence, and then Eileen put an end to the kids' questioning before he could answer.
says? Dean is basically the only person who gets his sense of humour.
Cas doesn’t answer, and Dean knows what that means. Cas doesn’t want to make a promise he thinks he might not be able to keep.
Dean hesitantly accepted the phone, not sure what was going on. Hands shaking from the emotions of the last few minutes, he opened the gallery app… and was faced with the photo Cas had taken at Hells Canyon. In the foreground was Cas, yes… but Dean was also in the picture. And in Cas’s hand, that he held up close to Dean’s shoulder, was a note that said MARRY ME?
The fire  was already burning in the barnyard by the time they made it outside, and everyone was standing around it in the snow or sitting on the improvised log benches John had made – apart from Uncle Bobby, whose wheelchair was placed right next to one of the logs, where he and John were getting nostalgic and talking about old times.
It’s all Cas has ever wanted to hear from Dean, but the timing is – if Dean and Benny are— “And him?” Maybe it’s in bad taste, asking this while Benny is here, after having interrupted their intimate moment, but Cas needs to know. Benny doesn’t look bothered by it anyway.
Cas seemed contemplative, standing there, and he was still looking out the window even though knew by now that it wasn't Sam and Eileen he'd heard, so Dean waited to see if he'd say something else.
