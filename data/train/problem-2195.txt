Face suddenly determined, John yanked the crutches closer. He adjusted them whereby the rubber bottoms rested a bit behind his hips. Sherlock grunted, comprehending the plan. Grasping the tubing close to the handholds, he then set them at 45-degree angles with the tips on the floor. Expelling a truly primordial grunt, John fought to push up to his right foot. Twenty seconds of red-faced puffing later, John dropped back down hard on his arse. "Bloody hell!"
Just an FYI: the last chapter had some inconsistencies...that's what I get for posting before proof-reading. Anyway, I fixed them.
"Yeah, of course I do. I'd prefer that these horrible things never happened to you in the first place!" John felt his blood pressure skyrocket to where his ankle throbbed in tandem with his heart. Gripping his hair, John tried again. "Sorry...sorry...I shouldn't have raised my voice like that. I'm not angry, really."
a graduate chemist, you silly man, not to mention a detective who specializes in homicide. My expertise in the field of medicine in no way reflects on your own, and you know that."
Sherlock's agitated pitching was so violent that John was carried along. The little man resembled nothing so much as a child receiving a horsey ride...unwillingly. John had maneuvered one swift hand under each of Sherlock's armpits, anchoring their bodies together. As the doctor's grip tightened, the detective's body slowly gentled, muscles eased. John cautiously reigned Sherlock in, taking the lead in their dance. Nonsense words, soothing nothings, heedlessly flew from his lips.
Blessed be, John did. He tickled and teased, gently twisting the nubs until the genius keened to the skies. "It's like turning up the volume on an old black-and-white," the doctor smirked. "What happens when I do
John manoeuvred the kitchen using only one crutch, whilst the other hand braced on the counter. It was British instinct, really. Faced with a crisis? Run for the kitchen and turn on the kettle. He placed two mugs on the counter, both chipped; no use in using fine china at half three in the morning. Two bags of Twining’s Everyday tea, steeped for two minutes and twenty seconds. A dollop of milk in his, barely enough to alter the color. Cream and a wanton three heaping teaspoons of sugar in Sherlock’s.
There was no question, really. Much better to screw over the inconsequential flatmate than to tempt the addictive younger brother. As Sherlock's best friend, said flatmate sympathized. As a man in a shitload of agony, said flatmate cursed Mycroft to the ninth circle of Hell and beyond.
"No, thanks for asking," John muttered glumly. "You know I have rows with inanimate objects." He gestured to the loosened beige bandage. "The damn clasp fell off and slid under the tub." Dropping his head to his chest, the doctor groaned. "Between that, and the pain, and these sodding crutches...I fell into a bit of a snit."
asking. As if any of John's secrets lay beyond Sherlock's ken, what a ridiculously puerile idea. This is why, in the end (pun intended), that John had put to memory seventeen delicious positions in which one man could bugger another. There were five positions in particular that he fancied, four of which he'd like to give a go.
Sherlock's eyes shone with fierce concentration, the face of a man defusing a bomb. John secretly patted himself on the...back. For all of the detective's brilliance, he'd overlooked one most particular fact. John had relinquished control of the moment, of this very first sexual experience. He'd done it for Sherlock, not that this experience wasn't absolutely lovely. Whilst John had absolutely no experience pleasing a man (other than himself), he'd certainly run through the gamut of sex. He knew what to watch for, when to push or hold back. Sherlock, before this moment, had no clue. Best to leave things up a virgin to avoid any jitters. John was a considerate lover.
"It is the fate of sexual love to become extinguished when it is satisfied; for it to be able to last, it must from the first be mixed with purely tender components." - Sigmund Freud
I say such a thing? My dear John," he paused, impelled to snuffle a great wad of snot up his nose before dripping, "you do know I that I'd monitored your dating behavior since the day you'd moved in. You are prone to smooth-skinned women with blue eyes and large bottoms. Tell me if I am wrong."
"Sherlock...you were. You were an army of one. You didn't have anyone to help or guide your decisions. I don't," the little man hesitated in a futile effort to regain composure. "I believe that, if I were in your shoes...that I would have given up."
in a terrible position! She nearly lost her head watching John suffer knowing that she'd had a hand in it."
John knew that anal sphincters were composed of strong skeletal muscle, the primary purpose of such lay in keeping the anal canal closed. Sphincter muscles were permanently contracted (offering a secondary meaning for the term "tight-arse"). Even so, Sherlock's bum hole seemed downright
"Actually, I've finished up. Child's play, really. I shall head out as soon as feasibly possible. However," he eyed the additional mess on the floor. "I've been debating the propriety of leaving without first straightening up. Nevertheless, upon further considerations, I feel that my ejaculate adds a sense of sophistication to this previously pedestrian filth. I'll leave the floor it stands and not tarry."
The detective's eyes flicked over to John's without moving. The little man watched, breath abated, whilst Sherlock swallowed hard several times. He resumed his place on the bed, migrating so stiffly that his knees popped, breaking the silence. "John..." he said softly, "I..." he cleared his throat harshly. "The...injuries that occurred, as you are now aware, are grotesque." He swept one hand toward the en suite. "It is quite obvious that they upset you, and - "
"Mmmm, I was hoping you'd say that. There is a small issue of logistics, however," John  glanced at his ankle. "We might have to get a little creative, depending on what
Sherlock had solved it ten minutes, no surprise there. Mrs. Chattergee (no relation, thank you very much) laced her husband's bread with a liberal amount of ground glass. Not much of a head-scratcher, that. The couple owned a bakery. She'd told him that she was trying out a new recipe, one using a coarse grind of bulgar wheat. Also, her dismembering of his cheating, corpulent corpse, then stuffing the pieces into bread boxes Sherlock deemed amusing. Hardly worth his while, but amusing.
Upon procurement of a plastic spoon, he had continues his administration of the ice chips. At this point, John was drowsing in and out a semi-conscious state. No further statements regarding the flavor of his skin were forthcoming. Neither had any perverse, although somewhat thrilling, rhymes.
You know what really pisses me off? When I scroll through my work 500 times and don't see the typos until I have already posted. Arrrrgh!
Greg warily studied his friend whilst more surreptitiously assessing his own damage. Cautiously, oh so carefully, he lifted his fingers and gently ran them over cracked bone. Frankly, it didn't feel good, pun intended. Freshets of red blood trickled down to his wrists, splattering to the ground with a
he stabbed a finger at his flatmate, "should "deduce," ' John made nastily exaggerated air quotes, "my opinion of your intruding into my... my... to make me chunder up the pathetic - "
"What?" John snorted. He let fly a long, merry giggle, forever in tune with his lover. "Now. Hear. This." John bellowed in a sportscaster's tone. He both felt and heard Sherlock's guffaw. "You ARE BEAUTIFUL, Sherlock, and no bloody old scars can change that. You are sexy, and brilliant...hey, keep going, I'll die if you stop now!" John demanded with a slap to his arse, as the detective's hand abruptly stilled. Those words - John's words. He'd know in an instant if John was lying. Hell, he was bloody
"Oi!" Lestrade bellowed for the umpteenth time. "Where the blazes did you go? Sherlock, did you find something?" In desperation he cried, "Are you still even here, you clot, or did you bugger off like normal!?" Tilting his head, the DI strained his ears for a comeback. He heard zilch, unless he counted the sweet chirps of birds. "
John huffed, extremely familiar with his flatmates' pathological distaste of being dirty. Pivoting awkwardly on his hips, he reached to grab a rag from behind him. It had been languishing on the worn wooden table for over a week, and John had purposefully left it alone. He'd ruined more than one of Sherlock's experiments when straightening their shambles of a kitchen, and the doctor had it up to here with being sniped at.
of you should be holding anything back." Greg's attention flipped over to the doctor, who'd started shifting anxiously in his chair. "John, don't you agree?"
Sherlock prayed...no, as a consummate athiest he considered this poor form, and crossed his fingers in the hope that Lestrade wouldn't see past his bluster. He watched nervously as the DI tripped and swore whilst navigating through a maze of tall grass. Lestrade paused before reaching Sherlock, opting instead to re-group. Placing blocky brown hands on the back of a bench, Greg leaned over 'til he'd caught his breath.
The brownish pink hue of his nipples, tightening to form rock-hard nubs. His finely fuzzed, sharply chiseled chest. The clenched muscles of his stomach when he breathes.
"Slick," Sherlock grinned. "Well, John, you'd better put that poncy premium lubricant to good use. It cost nearly 12 pounds, let me remind you."
"What are we doing here, John?" the detective's deep voice rumbled. The doctor shrugged one shoulder, dejected. "John. The last few hours have been difficult as it is. Please don't shut me out, I'll go mad."
Scrubbing a long hand over his chest, the detective twisted his mouth into a perverse approximation of a smile... possibly a misguided attempt for some levity?
Without his noticing, John's hand slowed down to a crawl. His fist then stopped completely, but still clutched his cock; during which it had slumped to half-mast.
okay, one more. I'm pretty sure that this sucks. Hopefully it doesn't. I'm venting here, not looking for anything...ok, that's a lie. I am in desperate need for positive input. I have been distracted by the MARVELOUS work of CaitlynFairchild, SilentAuror, PoppyAlexander, Breath4Life, LockedinJohnlock, CassidyHartwick, pandoras_chaos, J-Baillier, darkestbird, threadoflife, pennydreadful, and many others. Check oiut my bookmarks if you are interested. It's a little daunting to write when surrounded by such brilliance.
if you don't want. But," John squinted at the ceiling, then wrinkled his nose in disgust. In normal circumstances Sherlock would find this expression endearing. At the moment, John's facial contortions were driving him absolutely mad.
There, there he is. John sees pale, dead sightless eyes framed by red ribbons of blood. Sherlock has no pulse, his arm limp and loose as a dead fish. Hands pull John away from the body, and the doctor is too debilitated to stop them.
"Oi," Lestrade objected. "We've been over this, Sherlock. I'm not angry, or pressing charges, or any some such ridiculous thing. I understand why what happened...
The DI performed a cursory check of the sitting room, Sherlock's quarters felt vacant as well. Lestrade tromped through the door of the kitchen and was met with a psychological slap in the face. There sat his quarry, still as statues in a long-ago deserted graveyard. Neither man acknowledged his presence. "Hey, mates," he said, not so much a greeting as a question. He knew that Sherlock would read the concern in his voice. Pushing further into the smallish space felt like muscling through blackstrap molassas.
John didn't know how much he should panic. Granted, the previous twenty-four hours had been like living in a madhouse, what with navigating an emotional minefield whilst his flatmate struggled to play nurse. Sherlock had cracked from far less. However, right now the man should be floating in a virtual sea of endorphins, fast asleep. Witnessing Sherlock's magnificent, breathtaking orgasm had almost brought John to tears.
wasn't into buggering men. The thought of kissing Lestrade made John squeamish, even if the DI was quite fit. Nor Sholto, or Murray, or Stamford, or any other other the men that he’d met.
"No, you have a very nice behind. My metaphor was in reference to how delicious they are!" the tall man tittered like a teenager.
This is the full quote. I warned you that I might take Freud's words out of context. (Mwah Ha Ha Haaaa)
Aaand...that's it. Whew. On to finish five shorter, half-written stories and the planning of another epic work. Thanks for staying, I love hearing that people enjoyed this!
Having no discernible effect, Greg sighed and shut up. He sat, pinching the bridge of his nose, and assumed Sherlock was gearing up for a sulk. Greg desperately hoped that Sherlock had at least one decent splinter stuck up his bum, a pain in his own arse for a change.
the detective mused with chagrin. The only refuge from the excruciating agony came through submergence in his own mind. Sherlock's mind palace served more than one purpose.
Eventually, the splashing ceased, the toilet flushed (more splashing of water immediately following), flannels thumped on the floor, and the en suite door clicked open. In self defence of his sanity, John had kept busy by brewing more tea. Weakening, he'd thrown a half-empty packet of McVitie's on the table. Crumbs tumbled out through a tear in the plastic, some of them spilling to the floor. A falling hazard, that. His crutches might lose purchase on oily bits of chocolate. John couldn't be arsed to care. Sherlock's new cup of tea briskly steamed. The doctor temperament followed suit.
"Lestrade..." Sherlock scrubbed his face with his hands. "Spit it out, will you? Just tell me. I've got a full plate as it is." Despite himself, Sherlock shot his eyes toward the en suite. "John is..." His eyes dropped to the floor with a heart-rending sigh. "I am
It was a slow process, this: the unveiling of a body cast into hell. John remained silent and intent whilst Sherlock unbuttoned his shirt. The doctor blanched when he realized how close his lips had come to touch Sherlock's... Christ, Sherlock's "vest". John's practiced eye spotted the junction where true skin met silicone; roughly, where the third costal cartilage began. Surely, he'd been lost in the moment, for Sherlock to let John kiss down his chest in the first place. Two more inches, and John's tongue would have touched artificial skin. Time hung in stasis between them; the room, a little bubble in time.
"John!" Sherlock bellowed loud as a bull elephant from the relative safety of the kitchen. "Get up! Lestrade requires your immediate medical assistance."
Eyes wide, Sherlock gingerly rested the back third of his rump on the mattress. John giggled,  suddenly chuffed to bits by his flatmate. This ridiculous, irritating, self-involved prat was improvising as he went along. This whole mess felt like living in a live-action rom-com; awkward and titillating in turn.
Sherlock abstained from self-scrutiny on general principle in the knowledge that he wouldn't care very much for what he saw. Ignoring the damage he left in his wake made life so much easier to bear. Now, though, things were different. Now that he cared. He loved John.
to do for the next three months? The doctor had no need to review the mound of discharge paperwork to ruminate on his fate. The wholesale ruination of his ankle would be obvious to even a layman.
Sherlock, whilst cognizant of sex's basic logistics, understood nothing of foreplay's minutiae. Nevertheless, John, honorable and stalwart companion, would never lead his best friend astray. John would know what he needed. John would know what to do.
Sherlock cleared his throat harshly, as if attempting to expel a splintered chicken bone. "Yes. Very good. Thank you."
Having said that, there may be typos and possibly some issues with consistency. I wrote half of this on my phone on the way to see relatives.
lover, kneaded Sherlock's arse. It was John's turn to take charge, and Sherlock gladly gave in to his overtly possessive, restless petting. The genius relented under John's rough, rapacious hands, communicating his surrender with a groan. It was crystal clear to Sherlock that the the doctor was taking the time to stake his own claim. His extremities howled "Mine!" whilst his mouth remained otherwise occupied.
The detective's mammoth hand had maintained it's grip, absently kneading John's bum. Without another word, the doctor threaded own his arm under Sherlock's and grabbed one round cheek in his hand. Much to his horror, Sherlock let fly an extremely cute, very high-pitched squeak. "My God, man, your arse cheeks are bigger than cantaloupes!"
John thought, reveling under each luxurious touch. Every stroke and caress crossed from silky to Spartan, was a distinction determined via deduction and guile. Uncanny strokes by diabolical digits -
fractal patterns whilst trimming their Norway spruce tree. Once a mathematician, always a mathematician, Papa later quipped (after an aside conversation with Mycroft, the man not knowing fractals from fractions).
I think I rushed this by submitting so quickly after writing. I polished it up enough that I felt that it needed re-posting.
Greg ignored Sherlock's puss face and sallied forth with his argument. He raised one weathered finger for each point. "So. Let's look at what we're dealing with. An authentically clever serial killer, a mounting list of victims, a seriously depressing lack of witnesses, not
Frankly, it didn't matter that in all certainty the bastards had long ago been turned into worm food. Dollars to doughnuts, Mycroft had executed very specific orders in this case, pun absolutely intended. No, what mattered was that his gorgeous, brilliant boyfriend
plan involved several logical steps. One: chastising John for failing to keep up. Two: basking in the warmth of John's typical wonder and praise. Three: picking up takeaway from the little Indian restaurant he'd smelled up the block, and scarfing down all of the curry before exiting the taxi. Four: he himself, wrapping up a highly satisfactory evening by completing an ongoing experiment. This involved measuring the rates of dissolution of human toes in 15 different acids. It was a fine plan, and he was sticking to it.
"Really, Sherlock? John laughed wryly. "So much for deductive geniuses. I'm sitting on your bed, in your
Oi! Get your minds out of the gutter, people, Sherlock buys John a new iPhone. Okay, now put your minds BACK into the gutter, because those two sex-starved lunatics are insatiable. The second toy is another wireless device. Not to be repetitive, but this one also has a sleek, black silicone finish. The difference here, though, is that it has nine different settings and ISN'T meant to held next to one's ear. The doctor demonstrates Position #3, thanks to FaceTime.
The detective lunged down, lips smashing into John's mouth. He snickered and arched his back, waggling his bum in the air. John rewarded Sherlock by groping his plush arsecheeks, causing both men to moan with desire. Snogging felt easy and familiar, not a retreat from lovemaking, but rather a segue. Their open-mouthed kisses grew increasingly sloppy. Sherlock's tongue lapped the delicate skin below John's ear. The smaller man's pelvis bucked up, his rock-hard penis slapping against Sherlock's balls. Sounds of pleasure bounced off the walls, filling up its corners. The genius relaxed, now that he controlled John's movements. "My love, I have an idea."
Aubergine complimented his colouring. Well, "weird purple", as John defined it - his silly man. ("God, Sherlock, purple is such a lovely contrast against your fucking lovely skin. It's bloody artwork, you bloody lovely git. Lovely. Come 'ere, and let me suck you off." Sherlock snorted.
John threw his head back on to the pillow, now laughing outright. Sherlock spun around, scouting the doorway for the arrival of curious nurses. It seemed that John, the dizzy git, believed that singing Sherlock's praises was an extremely excellent idea. "Sheerrrr...lock, Lockybock, enormous cock..." An outright, dirty guffaw sprang from John's lips at the detective's horrified expression.
"Serves you right, you big twat - taking my whisky like that," John said breathlessly. "If I was my father that crutch wouldn't be the only thing thrown to the floor tonight!" He rubbed the tears from his eyes. "Ahhh... Christ, I needed that. And speaking of pants, I'll piss mine as well if I don't get on in. Can you - ." John paused as Sherlock leaned close to hand him back his crutch. "Thanks, mate. So, let's say I join you by the fire in a few minutes, yeah?"
"We approach the id with analogies...a cauldron full of seething excitations...only striving to bring about the satisfaction of the the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle." Sigmund Freud

At only one other time in his life had John suffered such a sense of impotence; the day that he'd watched his best friend die.
Sherlock must have slid it under his sleeping form before he'd left the flat. The idea disturbed the doctor further. For whatever reason, Sherlock didn't want to talk face-to-face.
would feel in Sherlock's situation. But, who the hell knew what Sherlock was feeling? The man remained an enigma. He hid his true nature, whatever it might be, behind a veil made of sarcasm and wit. Sometimes, though, some
Sherlock smiled, and maneuvered behind him. Space was tight...the en suite was cramped as it was. "It's a good thing you're such a skinny git!" John grunted as Sherlock hoisted him to standing. The room swam for a few seconds, dark specks obscuring his vision. John felt himself swaying from a one-two punch of exhaustion and lack of fluids. Combine these two conditions with a sudden change in elevation, and a quick drop in blood pressure results. He should have anticipated this physical response, but was simply too out-of-sorts.
John nodded, and then remembered their pitch black conditions. "Why not. Sherlock. We're not ill. Exactly what does H3N2 represent in our circumstance?"
Five minutes later, Sherlock burst back into the recovery room armed with an enormous cup packed with ice. "Ice chips for now, John. The nurses are being ridiculous. They forbid you from partaking of any and all fluids until you've completely metabolized the anesthestic.
It was like this. The baby, naturally enough, was distracted. He'd shimmied up and half over the banister of their cottage's second-storey stairwell. Sherlock see-sawed aimlessly as he gazed, starry-eyed, at the beautiful beautiful fairy lights. He couldn't help it. Mummy had created such
"Fu-" the doctor keened. "Nnngh! Fucking dammit, love. You feel so...Christ, you're so tight!" He rotated and angled his hips, unerringly searching for the sweet spot. When John found Sherlock's prostate, the man launched up like a rocket, knees unbent. Before John could blink, his flatmate dropped down to redouble his efforts. It was if Sherlock's goal was to envelop all of John, rather than just his cock. "Touch yourself, babe," the doctor grunted, "I'm getting close!"
Sherlock nodded, too busy laughing to reply. He stacked up three logs and a fire lighter, setting the whole mess aflame with a match. The man's otherworldly eyes glimmered in the low flame, reflected its bright amber hue. His hair's curls changed from dead cells to sculpture, limned by gold flame and deep shadow. Sherlock's profile glimmered majestically whilst the logs caught, and by the time John next viewed him he identified less as detective and more as Greek god.
Lestrade swore into his mug upon seeing this, and risked a small sip of its contents. After John's comment he'd been wary; but yet, the drink seemed safe enough. In fact, it was a smooth and deliciously rounded bourbon. Greg downed the rest in one go, for a bit of the old liquid courage.
lips?" John snorted softly, blue-black eyes crinkling in wry amusement. The doctor paused, opening his mouth as if to speak. Changing his mind, he busied himself arranging himself atop Sherlock. "That's rich, coming from you. Yours are the ones people gag for. Michelangelo couldn't have sculpted any as sweet, and...Oh, jeezuz, speaking of sweet," John moaned, his glans grazing along Sherlock's wiry-haired balls.
- had done to his body had also destroyed parts of his soul. John's body language was all over the place, displaying fear (both for Sherlock
John moved in, straddling Sherlock's legs with his own. They sat, noses rubbing, sharing breath. "Sherlock," he beseeched. "Just show me. I promise it won't change how I feel; Christ, how could it? We were pawns, you and I. Now the game's over, and done." He ran hot hands up Sherlock's chest, catching the rapid pulse of Sherlock's heartbeat under his fingertips. Cupping Sherlock's taut cheeks, John used his thumbs to wipe tears. "It's all going to be fine, love. Trust me to tell you the truth."
John heard Sherlock inhale all the air in the room, leaving none left for himself. "What we did yesterday, the sex and all that, it was fantastic. Spectacular - more incredible than I ever could have imagined." Sherlock swallowed so strenuously John heard liquid propelling down his throat. "John, my body is ruined, just a mess. I'm wrecked, John, wrecked," he groaned, close to tears. "It's reasonable to infer that you no longer wish to be intimate."
"Well, then okay," the doctor nodded. "We're all agreed on the fact that you and I are facing a bit of a mess." John wincing, added, "I am not implying that
Sherlock smirked. John's bottom. Bugger, John's bottom. Despite the camera's distance from his blogger, he could see the rosy pink of John's anus.
"Mmmm. Actually, that's...good. Quite good, in fact." Sherlock flashed a return smile, but suddenly recalled what had fomented John's amusement.
Damn those two! This was his case, and therefore his self-appointed duty to keep the pair safe. He despised the idiotic risks John and Sherlock took. Lestrade worked under juristiction of the NSY. Those morons worked for the thrill. As long as the gits followed the law (mostly), Lestrade had no say for their actions. Nevertheless, when one or both suffered injury...oh, the guilt.
A man like me cannot live without a hobby-horse, a consuming passion...a tyrant." - Sigmund Freud, Letter to Wilhelm Fliess (1895)
"Barking mad for your body. Around the twist for your touch." The smaller man's normally light voice had gone deep. "And, Sherlock," he hesitated for a second, "Thank you for telling me the truth."
Greg warbled, not caring for the tremulous tone of his voice. He was now certifiably freaked out; and besides, in a bloody fuck ton of pain. The man's silvered eyes, unusual at best, juddered, tripping across the width of their sockets. Eventually, Sherlock's gaze slid upwards, meandering a foot over Lestrade’s spiked hair. Greg felt a sudden, pressing need to let go of his bladder. Sherlock wasn’t…
Before finishing up with the discharge paperwork, a soft-spoken nurse had split the left trouser leg up to the thigh. John watched, dismayed as her practiced hands ran stainless steel surgical scissors along the seam. The woman, prematurely greying hair bobbing over her eyes with the effort, flashed him a genuinely sympathetic smile.
John's smile morphed from sweet to indulgent, and finally ruthless. He was going to take this ethereal seraph apart.
Sherlock's hallucinatory specter budged in. The figure stood by the windows facing John, neatly outlined by the street lights. Impossible, and yet glaring before him.
Alas, no. John sensed Sherlock's opening salvo and put up a hand in defence. "Sherlock, no. I'd rather not get into deep conversation until my stomach has a chance to recover."
A veteran of the RAMC and one of the bravest men Greg had the honour to work with: Dr. John Bloody H. I'll-Kick-Your-Arse Watson. Avid blogger, fine physician, and Sherlock's tried-and-true, loyal best friend.
Sherlock, clever in all things, had managed to conceal this monster, despite his predilection for tight, tailored trousers. Good thing, really - all of this, just for John.
The doctor shook, face jammed between couch cushion and backrest. Before hunkering down, John had spent several arduous minutes conveying clipped instructions to his consulting arsehole on proper foot elevation. As such, three strategically placed pillows now sat sandwiched between his legs, from groin to toes. It didn't seem to be helping. John shook and his breathing was audible all the way from the kitchen.
"Shut up and make me come," John piped in rebuttal, and bent down to suck on his cock. It was marvelous, this - to love and be loved, especially by the love of your life.
Again, John shook his head. "I'm not going to ice it in here." He sighed and worked his way to the bed, settling down with obvious relief.
"But, this one time? She took a trip across Europe with her sewing circle, Jesus, the biggest bunch of old biddies you ever saw, swear to God, like a clutch of squawking chickens. And sodding hell, all the
"I see." The doctor halted three feet from the bed. His eyes darted to the bed, then at Sherlock, and finally down at his crutches. He was a man who looked ready to bolt. "So...now what."
Sherlock sniffed imperiously. "I'll have you know I have a very sensitive bum. I can't help it, it hurts." He softly patted his rump, face reddening.
"Sherlock. Come sit," Greg called, smacking the bench in encouragement. "I'm beat... worked through most of the night, as it were. There's no time to waste here, but," Lestrade grunted. "I need a ten minute breather." Not bothering to check if he was coming, the DI unconsciously patted his chest for a smoke, like nervous tic.
The case was settled, the boys intact - in all the ways that it mattered. The damage to their psyches, well. That would be addressed at a later time.
"As long as we're on the same page about how far we take this," John stroked his friend's lips with his thumb, "I challenge you to use that brilliant brain of yours and

me. OI!" The last he shouted two inches away from Sherlock's face. Or, John would have, if only he was six inches taller. Really, it was all just a question of semantics.
John launched over a black Norway rat the size of a corgi as it bolted out of an overturned bin. Dr. John Watson, proud former member of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers; three-year veteran of Afganistan, Kandahar, Helman and Bath (Bloody) Hospital screamed like a little girl and landed cock-eyed on a cracked bit of pavement.
Both Greg and Sherlock and blanched in the face of John's crude inquiry. "John," Lestrade said slowly as he moved inward to sit on the couch. "Come sit down, before you fall down. You did a crack job setting my nose; ta for that, by the way. But, you're seriously close to falling on your face. How much have you had to drink today?"
"Shut. Up!" Sherlock giggled. After all this, and he giggled? "Your bum is like two...ehm, mangoes!"
"Words have a magical power. They can bring either the greatest happiness or deepest despair...Words are capable of arousing the strongest emotions and prompting all of men's actions." - Sigmund Freud
I don't ever want to hear such rubbish coming out of your mouth again." His deep blue eyes darkened with heartache. John's lips twisted in a parody of a smile. He tried again. "And, weeping is a physiological - and a normal, may I add, response to great stress." Sherlock grimaced, ashamed of being thought weak. "Don't give me that, love! Aren't I right?" Sherlock glared down at his hand, pretending that John hadn't spoken.
Sherlock’s left hand calmly rose up and cupped his right fist, optimizing his arm's strength and stability. Head cocked and eyes flashing, the consultant morphed from a fish into a malnourished and malevolent bird of prey.
John rose up to slowly to consciousness, abruptly aware of three things. One, he was feverishly hot, and lathered in thick, salty sweat. Two, he lay caught - or
Eventually, the detective's body startled, then stretched. Permitting himself an internal sigh of relief, John smiled as Sherlock's large hands stirred to life. They clutched weakly in pained resignation, nails snagging on the woolly weave of his jumper. The detective looked up, managing a watery smile. His lips silently formed his soulmate's name, and John mirrored the action with a wry grin.
Now John did snort, but as the stalwart medical professional he was, he followed through. They started slowly, as slow only made sense. John manoeuvered his penis into position, rubbing the crest of his glans against Sherlock's furl. Wanting to ease his lover's trepidation, he breathlessly narrated each move. There was panting and groaning and the gyrating of bodies as John worked his way into Sherlock. The doctor's brain short-circuited the second his balls touched against his lover's rounded flesh. "I'm all the way in," he panted, eyelids drooping heavily. "Tss...good, really good. Are you alright?"
"Human beings are funny. They long to be with the person they love but refuse to admit openly. Some are afraid to show even the slightest sign of affection because of fear. Fear that their feelings may not be recognized, or even worse, returned." - Sigmund Freud
comes back and ridicules you for missing the chase. I can't bear his snarky attitude towards you. It's rude and unfounded."
At this, the genius slunk into the sitting room, clutching John's medical kit. "No, so in accordance, I'm fine. We're all fine, apparently, isn't that lovely. Now, here. Set Lestrade's nose before he ends up scaring little children in the streets."
Sherlock huffed, crossing his arms; classic markers of his pulling a strop. "I don't need to look at you to know that you're shutting me out." He faced the window, glaring at the insufferable silence down below. Apparently, London had joined John in shutting down as well. "What about your insistance on 'doing this together'? Or, is that 'together' as in me revealing all of
John's eyes glazed slightly, his focus intent on Sherlock's mouth. He licked his lips, making two slow sweeps with his tongue before it slipped back into his mouth. John hesitantly disengaged his hand from Sherlock's to rub over his eyes. "Can I have five minutes to take this all in?" John fumbled for something to say that wouldn't hurt Sherlock. Never hurt Sherlock. "I can't even, I have to - hang on. I'll be back."
"Believe me when I tell you, John, that what you're doing for me is not harmful." Sherlock met his flatmate's blue eyes with his own. The detective's eyes were so bloodshot John briefly wondered if his lover had gotten high whilst wandering the streets. No, no evidence of that, thank God. "I know what it is to be intentionally hurt. I experienced more... pain, agony, what have you, than I thought was physically possible to suffer and still live."
Employing keen blue-green eyes, Sherlock searched the convoluted landscape until he found what he most dreaded...two state-of-the-art CCTV cameras bolted to light poles, both within 200 ft. of his position. "Sodding hell," he muttered, smarting under his breath. "Dear brother
The flat sat oddly still after the cock up with the couch. John snorted, partially amused but for the most part shook up. Too much had happened in too short a time for him to process. And, now that his git of a flatmate was off running fool's errands (himself being said fool), the pain erupted in spades. He was back to square one until provisions arrived.
John required hydration.  Appreciative murmurings made sense. What flummoxed the genius was that along with the ice, John had enveloped his digits. Digits as in, Sherlock's forefinger and thumb in John's
John's amusement tickled Sherlock. John was showing no signs of anger or disgust. John was laughing at him, yet not in the mean way so familiar from his childhood. John was just laughing, which was good. John had come to his room - also, good.
Sherlock's body came to a screeching halt half-way between sitting and standing. "Sorry, John? I'm not sure I caught that." Color bled away from his cheeks, rosy lips tempering to white.
Sherlock had no inkling of when he'd last cried. Well...that wasn't entirely true, it was just that he'd rather have forgotten. Unsurprising, really...he'd been on top of a building, entangled in the web of a dead master criminal.
The genius merely shrugged. "It's neither here nor there, but simply the right thing to do. You had the right to name  your attacker."
John winced as he said this. He needed a stool for his wash-up so he could squat in the tub like an -
Sherlock giggled boyishly. "I quite agree. Despite my foul accommodations," he scanned the room and sneered, "I found long-distance shagging inordinately amenable." Coyly fluttering his eyelashes, the detective asked, "Was my choice of, er, shall we say, 'stand-in', acceptable?"
you? You told him all of it?" He gaped at his lover in an unhappy amalgamation of shock and alarm. "Sherlock? What happen' today? Are you okay, love?" John made to get up in an effort to reach out and touch Sherlock, to hold him tight in his arms.
"I..." Sherlock gnawed on his full bottom lip, eventually pulling off strips of skin between his teeth. "It's complicated. Obviously," he choked out, a pathetic approximation of a laugh, "that's an understatement. Moving on, however, I believe that you're still due that apology."
“We are threatened with suffering from three directions: from our body, which is doomed to decay..., from the external world which may rage against us with overwhelming and merciless force of destruction, and finally from our relations with other men... This last source is perhaps more painful to use than any other. (p77)”
BBC canon leaves much of Sherlock's experience during his three year hiatus up to the viewer's discretion. May it be agreed upon by all, however, that Sherlock had to kill an untold number of dangerous villains?
Greg gaped, wearily scrubbing his palms across his eyes. He wished that he could start the whole day over, starting by making a large detour around Baker St. "Bloody hell," he groaned. "I do believe you, actually, considering that you're being such a dick." Sherlock rolled his eyes with a huff. "Right." the DI said, "So much for that apology, yeah?" He gingerly resumed his place next to Sherlock. "So. What do we do now?"
Also, kind readers, I am incredibly sorry that this chapter took so stinking long to post. I've had a month-long brain fart. I NEED A BETA!!!! I have re-written this so many times it is ridiculous.
"I've been better. This hurts like a bitch," the little man groaned, straightening his left leg onto the pavement.
Speaking of which, as an American I had never heard the word "judder" before. I haven't googled it, but am using in context according to how it has been used in other people's work. I hope I understood it's meaning.
"Yeah?" John sneered, slightly affronted. "I know that I'm not of much use at the best of times, but I would think - ."
if you will. John." He twisted his long torso, avoiding John's face. "John, if you've changed your mind and want to delete this whole mess, I completely understand -and I will."
It was simple logic...which all things considered, could be judged rather unfortunate. Care for the needs of his transport, or chance Moriarty's underlings
"I credit your inclination in desiring to foster a cathartic  conversation between myself and my...John," the genius temporized, his words greatly at odds with his bearing. "However, he is not obfuscating the truth. There's nothing that John can say, because there's

“Sherlock?” Lestrade breathed, “What...shit. Just...shit. Are you okay?” In retrospect, it was an odd thing to ask. After all, he was the one who was hemorrhaging
Okay, what the hell. This was supposed to be smut, but my mind keeps kicking John's arse. It will get there, I swear.

"Shut up, John, and get back to work! How was I to know that the theatre director used to make furniture! It makes no sense, logically speaking; in fact completely contradictory, considering his skill set." The detective risked a surreptitious peek from over his shoulder. John looked angry...no, John was furious.
"Kerr um tha kunet," Sherlock growled, reaching around to squeeze at John's arse. Apparently, multilingual expressions of sentiment made the genius feel randy. John's hibernating cock gave a yawn, stretched, and opened one eye.
"So," Sherlock murmured, hands cupped protectively around his tea. They'd retreated back to bed after stuffing themselves to the gills. "At what point after I left did you commence hallucinating?"
"Show me," John said, deliberately modulating his tone, hoping to sound soothing and gentle. This, not surprisingly, took an enormous dint of will. John certainly didn't feel genial or at ease. A razor-sharp spike of vindictive fury rent his heart, hot rage coursing through his veins like a poison. John itched to annihilate those fucking bastards, those -
John lay writhing, slicked shiny with perspiration. Breath ragged and desperate, he'd clearly fallen victim to this naive sodding prat, the prat who'd promptly seized onto John's challenge. Now, Sherlock poised over John's heaving body with predatory glee on his face. The doctor lay utterly exposed, vulnerable to his lover's every whim. The notion was so incredibly
"I'm suggesting that you get your guilty arse out of the flat. You didn't cause this," John gestured to his leg, "and you know it. It was
The detective nodded slowly, pulling at his top lip with two fingers. "I believe I felt pleasantly surprised at the welcome home I received, as it was." He said the next into the well of his hand, unwilling to let go of his lip. "John, I attributed your acceptance as a factor of your stalwart nature, your military history, and what-ho." Sherlock groaned, "Let bygones be bygones, and all that. It appears that I've been a right fool."
"Nothing!" John blurted. His face registered shock. "You've done nothing more than be honest, which is the best that a friend and flatmate can hope for." Shock swiftly sublimated into misery. John snagged the half-empty whisky bottle and sloppily spilled another two fingers into his tumbler. "Oh, don't mind me; I'm just feeling maudlin." He threw back his head and slugged it down in one go. "Shay - same thing happened with my shoulder; it's history repeating itself."
...not even any bogey-nosed children to examine and mothers to soothe. Only a brace, and a pillow, and bad daytime telly. Fucking hell.
The doctor snorted, amused at the thought. Sherlock's coat as his cape. A vivid image of the detective, ripping open his purple-shirt-of-sex, flying off to fight crime in his Superlock suit....why not? He giggled merrily, tilting his head back to gaze at the sky. The doctor gave a full body shiver as a gust of cold air whipped through the alley. His teeth began to emphatically chatter.
**In case this is an Americanism (I really have no idea one way or the other), a "special feature" is a film that, well...is special, like one-time viewing, or an addendum to the main feature which is not generally shown.
Yet, a sense of foreboding distracted him, niggling and highly unpleasant. Something. Something dredged up from his memory. Something... something. Some
John gaped wide-eyed at the genius. He pushed up against the headboard, summarily crushing his pillow. "What?"
Flummoxed, Lestrade eyeballed Sherlock as he flounced into his bedroom, startling as he slammed closed his door. Never, never
Eventually, John yanked himself back upright, whereby his chin promptly flopped down to his chest. Too far gone to register any fresh pain, the doctor set his focus on simply staying upright. John seesawed, but held his position until movement caught his attention. Gasping in wonder, the doctor peered upwards and goggled at the myriad of whirling black dots filling the room. They were like soft, sooty snowflakes adrift in the air. John was tempted to reach out and touch one, but reconsidered.
On a hot, humid Wednesday, at half-three a.m., Sherlock finally opened his wallet. Payment involved smashing himself senseless against a formidably large concrete girder. He very purposefully
Treatment involved days, and/or weeks of surgical debridement. Necrotic tissues must be physically cut from the body to decrease the risk of sepsis. The process was brutal, revolting, and the aftermath - horrifically painful. In the most severe cases, the doctor cut out decimated skin, strips of muscle, and bone. Peeling off skin that looked more like leather, John never got over the sight. And if the skins grafts weren't healthy enough to take...
"Oh my God!" the little man crowed; oh, how he adored his mad flatmate. "Get a load of that bedhead! You look like one of those trained cockatoos from YouTube! Come on, lovely," John pleaded, dramatically clasping his hands. "Do Elvis!"
"Sherlock. Do shut up," John whispered, managing to channel Capt. Watson sotto voce. "Shut up," he continued, lips brushing across each cheek. "Shut up," hot moisture licked up Sherlock's rough, unshaven jaw.
"In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature.”
you are beautiful to me," John evinced, "Even when you act like a dick." The belated attempt for some levity fell flat, each word hanging loud in the silence. Swallowing hard, John proceeded to step two. His small but strong hands cautiously, carefully reached out. It felt imperative to comfort his lover.

talking to him. But, considering that the park lacked in other people, maybe...he was talking to the birds?
"Here, wear this," Sally grumbled, yanking off her sports coat and wrapping it around John's shoulders. "I suppose Sherlock wasn't around when you fell?"
They were a unit; a stable, unbreakable, covalent bond. The men breathed gently, noses grazing together whilst air molecules flowed between them via nose, mouth, and throat. Nitrogen, oxygen, argon pulled in to their lungs, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides and ozone out. Shared. A unit. As one.
good against my balls. It's so big. God, I want you in me." John lifted up his head, glaring heatedly into the camera's lens. "Fuck me, Sherlock. Come on, take me."
"Tosh," John flipped a hand. "What happened to me was a cake walk. Don't stop. Keep talking." He re-fluffed the pillow and adjusted his leg.
John had sucked his fingers. To be precise, his thumb and a forefinger, but the distinction was negligible. John then observed and reported that he "tasted good". Or rather, his
Nevertheless, John hadn't been promoted to captain by happenstance. The ruthless timber and volume of his voice breached the door of the palace like a 14th century battering ram. It splintered the wood planks into kindling.
"Shit. Well, of course. Why should I expect any different? Now you know. Can see. Deduce. Whatever. You know why I was snapping at thin air," John said stonily, gazing at his hands. "Brilliant. Just brilliant."
Hot semen simultaneously shot out of Sherlock's cock, painting John's abdomen white. His eyes went wild, mouth stretched wide in a silent scream of ecstasy.
In minute increments, John lured Sherlock out of his head. "Easy. Easy, love...that's it." Sherlock's shivering gentled, yet it's place rose a litany of whimpers, harsh breathing and moans. John wasn't sure if this was a step forward in his lover's recovery, or simply a different manifestation of upset. He didn't identify either behavior as a normal one for Sherlock, hell,
"Yes, Sherlock," the older man smirked, beyond chuffed, "yes we can. Uh...yeah. My leg. Alright, listen, love. You want to scoot that gorgeous bum over here...no, don't stop," John groaned as his love stilled. "Come 'ere, you git, keep scooting towards me, forward and up." John playfully slapped at Sherlock's upper thigh, giggling, "Up, up!" The gorgeous git gaped, unclear about John's ultimate game plan.
Rather, not as yet." Sherlock stared agog, observing Lestrade double back on his tracks. "Look. For Christ's sake, Lestrade! Take the

flatmate exponentially heightened discomfort. The detective's frantic thrashing had done little more than increase John's bruise count. "Oi! Sherlock!" He bellowed. "Slow down before you poke out an eye!"
The men's melee was unbelievably loud and extremely inappropriate for the setting. They would have garnered a whole host of attention, not to mention several squads of policemen, if only there had been an audience to pay heed. Greg grunted, red-faced and panting whilst he fought to keep Sherlock secure but unscathed. Sherlock flailed, floundering in the gravel, and held no reciprocal concerns about 'scathing' Lestrade. Needless to say, neither man had practiced healthy living habits during their formative years, and both were slightly past their prime. There was a fair bit of huffing and puffing, before Greg rallied. He hauled Sherlock up to his feet.
The men cast their eyes at the loo, then in turn came to land on each other. The shower was must definitely
want to do." The doctor ran a suggestive hand along the length of Sherlock's arm. "And...one more thing." John's hand slipped down over Sherlock's fingers. His hand cupped to hug the slight mound of the lanky man's thigh. Slyly shifting even lower, John fondled the sharp curve of his pelvis. John worked his thumb in light, teasing circles. Subtly, trying to further seduce Sherlock without scaring him silly, John made a practical suggestion. "First off, how's about you take off your clothes?"
In the low light, the detective's torso was flawless. Sherlock twisted deliberately to his left, than his right, allowing John to inspect him. It was impossible to tell where Sherlock ended and silicone began. Bemused, the little man squinted, scanning his lover's long body. Whomever Mycroft had contracted to create this illusion must have been a miracle worker. John merely shook his head, befuddled. His dark eyes flipped back up to Sherlock's in confusion.
"Feeling okay there, love?" The doctor inquired mildly. Cautiously, oh so cautiously, he touched a finger to Sherlock's back, tracing the razor-sharp bones of his spine. "If this is going to continue to work, we really need to communicate."
Sherlock huffed, feeling slightly offended. "Yes, John, and no, John. I am completely capable of dunking a teabag and frying an egg, thank you." He experienced two blissful seconds of indignant ire before deducing the reason for John's words. John was definitely deflecting. Playing along, Sherlock swung his dressing gown over his shoulders and flounced in the direction of the kitchen. "
"John? What are you doing?" Sherlock giggled, trying his best to hold back a guffaw. He heard his lover's irritated mumbling switch over into wholehearted profanities.
"Nous sommes tous deux émotionnellementépuisés au-                 delà de toute réparation, et pourla vie de moi, je ne sais pas quoi faire. Ich will dich nackt in diesem Bett halten undnie wieder rauskommen.     Indiferent ces  a întâmplat și cât de mult am fost răniți,vom fi mereu unul cu celălalt. Você  é meu e eu sou seu. Não importa o queaconteceu e o quanto fomos feridos, seremossempre um com o outro. Kan jy lei wat om te doen? Ek is 'n genie op sobaie maniere, maar met sentiment is ek niemeer as 'n kind."
And now, the illusion had shattered. The true "Great Reveal" reeked of dark humor, although, to be accurate, fingers in the carrot box already set the stage. Apparently, all John needed to do to set the ball rolling was to sustain a serious injury.
"Yes, a sudden shock can and will upset the average person's gastrointestinal tract and thereby trigger a bout of nausea, but no. Something else," Sherlock deduced. He peered down at John and crinkled his nose. "Did you - oh, yes. Oh, John, now I see."
"Create around one at least a small circle where matters are arranged as one wants them to be." - Anna Freud
"In the morning, you can wax poetic, I promise. I will listen to anything you say," John whimpered. "But right now, I want to hold you and... hurry up. Can you do that?"
"Enough, now," John murmured, daring to stroke Sherlock's cheek. "You know that I love you. I think you love me."

Also, in doing a bit of research, I've learned that The Beatles were in truth, four twenty-something man hoes who basically used their fame to get laid. Then for kicks, they worked the dirty details into their lyrics. (Can't you just hear Mycroft scoffing..."How juvenile") I had to sit down and think about how many times I've sung these songs to lull my children to sleep.
The doctor understood Sherlock's reasoning, as the objectionable odor of menthol cigarettes wafted into the flat. The man had been smoking... a lot. Water splashed for several minutes from the toilet, although if Sherlock believed that he could hide the smell from John he was kidding himself. The smell repulsed John on multiple levels, primarily because of the detrimental effects of tobacco. In this particular case, however, smoke sent John reeling. Sherlock only smoked when what he really wanted to do was get high. John was vigilant about giving his friend a surreptitious sniff every day. If Sherlock had noticed, he'd never made comment. The detective wasn't going to get away with it now.
John pulls into the drive and turns his car off, hurrying to the front door.  He thinks about knocking, but decides to just try the handle.  It turns easily, the door opening unimpeded.
“All right,” the older gentleman says, looking to John for some sort of verification.  John only shrugs, unsure of what else to do.
“And why are you here, Dr. Greenwhich?” he asked, relaxing back into the exam chair and placing his hands behind his head for extra comfort—the chair didn’t have much padding. “Only a technician can work the ultrasound machine. There isn’t really any need for you to take as much personal interest in me as you have been.”
Thankfully, John intervened before Sherlock killed the man. There had been a slight pause between the time that Dr. Greenwhich reached out to Sherlock’s belly, and the moment when Sherlock lost all sense of the propriety and decorum that John had practically beat into him over the years, and John used that split second to step in between the men, pushing aside Dr. Greenwhich’s hand with his own in a polite, inconspicuous kind of way, as he chuckled softly and agreed, “Er, yeah, been trying to plumpen him up a bit.” He rubbed his hand over Sherlock’s bulge like it was a tiny Buddha belly, to be sure that there was not a spot left open that the other doctor might try to touch again. “It’s been a chore, though, let me tell you. He’s never been much of an eater.”
Warnings for this chapter: Spanking, sexual humiliation and facials.  If that is not your thing, please feel free to skip this chapter and tune in next week for chapter 6.  Although, if it’s something you think you might be interested in giving a try and reading about, I’d say you should totally give this chapter a chance.  I tried to keep the essence of the relationship I’ve created for Sherlock and John at the heart of this chapter, so hopefully that caring, loving aspect is still evident, just with a darker edge to it.  For those of you who are new to the idea of sexual humiliation, or have never tried it out for yourselves, let me assure you: it is all completely consensual.  Huge thanks to SomeCoolName and That Kid With The Long Coat for beta’ing!
This is an old argument between them, one which Sherlock won’t let go and one that John won’t give in to.  John shakes his head, at a loss for words.  Sherlock inches closer to him, carefully, like he is approaching a skittish animal.  John lets him move nearer, though he eyes Sherlock warily.
Horribly, horribly short. More like a few paragraphs than a chapter. On the other hand, it's December 17th and I have yet to put one ornament on my very bald, very sad Christmas tree.
"According to the prevailing view, human sexual life consists essentially in an endeavor to bring one's own genitals in contact with those of someone..." -Sigmund Freud**
, I understa - hell, no, Fuck! I really don't. I don't actually know what you're going through... what you went through, uh... back in Serbia. I can only imagine," John swallowed audibly, "that it's been a complete nightmare for you to cope with."
Hmmm. I'm back to excessive use of hyphens. In addition, I hope none of the story was redundant. Multiple rewriting and all that. Please feel free to point out any mistakes.
Abashed and afraid, Sherlock shuddered - but slid closer. He wiggled cautiously, freezing when he met John's furnace-hot length. The scent of John's sweat was so soothing, Sherlock didn't even think twice. He brushed cat-like against his lover; anointing his face with the moisture. John's scent, the smell of salvation - balm for the roiling of his gut. It turned out that John's queasy stomach was contagious.
Sherlock's lips parted and locked into place. The doctor sensed his sudden unease. Panting hard, John drew back and regarded him. "Sherlock, is this too much? Did I take it too far?" His blue eyes scanned Sherlock for clues.
John. Revealing my secrets - that's what hurts." The detective dropped his arms, desperate to elaborate as John's face turned painfully stricken.
perfect. The position wasn't quite as decorative as John envisioned, but holy fuckness did it provide  compensation. His spine rolled back, arse balanced precariously atop the wooden edge, upper body weight braced on his palms. Sherlock hungrily pressed between John's legs, his hips bucking forwards at top breakneck speed. He thrust his cock deep, deep, deep, deeper into John's exquisitely tight, madly fluttering hot hole.
The man in question snorted, growing slightly annoyed. "I believe we are getting off topic. Pillows, John. We need more pillows," the detective grimaced. "My quote on quote 'unnaturally long legs' are close to collapse from exhaustion." Without warning, he withdrew, penis bobbing as he dashed from the room.
with this whingeing. So much crying - too much crying. He was a soldier, by God, and a Brit of the male persuasion. He'd not wept this much as a tot still in nappies, sucking on a dummy whilst kipping in his cot.
John felt Sherlock's rock-hard cock insistently nudging against his pelvis. He had to take a look. It bobbed and jerked, deep fuschia in color, playing peek-a-boo between the tails of his shirt. John thrust until his cock bumped up flush with against Sherlock's. They both groaned in ecstasy.
"So," Lestrade sighed, shifting the car into park. "Question. How much of all this history have you told John?"
"Correct," the genius smirked. "And as I, in turn, am rather sensitive on the matter of certain subjects. I might - get a bit overwhelmed," Sherlock rolled his eyes, "As I've so recently demonstrated. But, John." Leaning inwards until nose met with nose, Sherlock whispered, "It will never be your fault. It is what it is. All of this...he gestured to himself, "is what Moriarty left behind."
"Life as we find it is too hard for us; it entails too much pain, too many disappointments, impossible tasks. We cannot do without  palliative measures." - Sigmund Freud
"Jesus, Sherlock, I need you to touch me. I need to touch you, please don't tease anymore," John gasped, falling down on the bed. "I can't stand it, god you're so good, you're so lovely and gorgeous and
Sherlock carelessly flopped down on the bed, grimacing at his lover's pained wince. "Sorry, John, you know I'm good at this thing." His long face drooped into a scowl. Humming softly, he said, "It's like this. We've seemed fine, at the top of our game. I'm on fire, intellectually speaking. And you, John? Choosing to come back to be my sidekiii...
"Yes. He wasn't just having you on." John nodded nervously. "It certainly wasn't an easy tale to listen to. I - hold on, he
Now the walls sank inward, and John felt as if the whole room was melting. The doctor cursed his landlady for her ridiculously garish taste in wallpaper. The brown and green striping undulated wildly, akin to ocean waves raging during a tempest. John's disorientation mounted, and he struggled to maintain full awareness. The doctor in him perked up, quickly slapping that berk Wanker John in the face. He was precariously close to passing out, the second time in one day. Not good. Not good at all.
"The price we pay for the advance in civilization is a loss of happiness through the heightening of the sense of guilt." - Sigmund Freud
Once the perpetrator understood that he'd been sussed out, he'd shot himself point-blank in the mouth. All three boys had been wearing his blood and bits of brain tissue when they'd been rescued from his fruit cellar. Lestrade was profoundly grateful that he'd not been there as witness. He saw enough gore as it was; enough for a lifetime, far too much. Thank God that this hadn't been added to the list.
To John's eternal delight, Sherlock squirmed in an adorable combination of mortification and arousal. Crimson color flooded his cheeks, neck and chest. John fought the crushing desire to consume this miraculous creature, body and soul.
"John, stop shushing me, you're acting like Mycroft!" the detective snapped. The conversation lapsed into silence. Both men needed a respite. Eventually, Sherlock continued. "John. Everything I've ever worked for, every case, and experiment, and adventure. All of it," Sherlock gestured about. "The flat, my life, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade; hell, yes, even Mycroft and my parents... none of it matters to me if I lose you. I'll do whatever it is that you want. I will show you my scars."
The tenacious self discipline John honed as a soldier was the one and only thing that kept his outward appearance rational and steady. If Sherlock had been in any ordinary state of mind, he would have seen John's fingers crushed into shaking fists, despite his concealing them under the table. The detective wasn't in any state resembling convention, however, even for him. Sherlock practically spewed agitated unease, as if he might bolt out of the flat given the slightest provocation. The genius was high-strung at the best of times, but now, this? If John wasn't careful, he might propel Sherlock into the terror of a flashback - and then where would they be?
John rolled his eyes to the ceiling, really not wanting to lie. "No, you're right, Sherlock. But looks were only part of the equation for me then. Christ, Sarah's bum was flatter than a pancake. I was attracted to her mind as well as... well, as other things." He licked a long, sticky stripe up Sherlock's endless neck, ending the move by chewing on an earlobe. "Frankly, it had been a long time, and I was dying to get a leg over. I wasn't too particular about the specifics. And I won't even discuss with you the disaster known as Janette."
The DI clutched at his stomach as he walked, drowning painfully in hot, bitter acid. He deeply regretted chugging that third cup of swill in the break room. Caffeine...the only socially acceptable vice he had left.
The little man rolled his eyes with a grin. He set about rearranging the pillows whilst Sherlock watched, attentive. Satisfied with the results, John used his lover's pelvis for ballast whilst sinking down on the mattress. Although he now lay at an awkward angle, the benefits outweighed the discomfort.
Boy, was this fun. I meant for the chapter to get to the nitty gritty, but I got tired. A reminder to the fandom that I am not a young woman. Besides...I have to pee.
The detective snorted. "Merely doing my duty. Don't get used to it." She smiled down at him, expression belying her unfriendly words. "You're not as much of an arse as your flatmate. I am simply trying to keep you stable until the medics arrive
A muffled expletive echoed through the venting. John laughed harder, giggles erupting into snorts and guffaws.
Granted, as an army doctor, John had been witness to the detestable depths to which men sunk. Nevertheless, what those -
Sherlock snorted derisively. "As if you could. Your acting skills are appalling." He tried to keep his own burgeoning jealousy out of his voice.
"Well," John tipped his head thoughtfully, "this big boy certainly did the job. Having said that, it's no substitute for you
John cried out hoarsely as Sherlock upped the ante, pumping with a smooth, steady rhythm. In retaliation, the doctor splayed sweet, open-mouthed kisses over one nipple, closing down over it to suck. Thin clever lips, and moist, pliable tongue set up shop on the plain of his chest. Sherlock shivered as warm, slippery traces of saliva cooled, inspiring a blanket of goosebumps. It was...John was...exquisite. His touch felt inherently divine.
Sherlock nearly lost his mind, vision whiting out as his balls rose, taut and throbbing, preparing to explode. "John! John, touch yourself, I'm going to come!
was, there was more than one person involved. The tiny, coarse hairs at the base of his neck sprung up, and brushed at his collar.
shone on through. Despite his stalwart attempts to deny it, Sherlock radiated with a passion for life. He longed for the chase, for righting the wrongs, for...a short, steady man named John Watson.
The detective pulled out, all muscles melting. He slowly fell forward, finally docking on John's slippery torso. Neither spoke for a minute, concentrated on forcing oxygen back into their lungs.
pisses me off like you wouldn't believe." Sweat popped up on his wrinkled brow, eyes ensconced in a face consumed by misery.
"Christ, John, I am sorry," Sherlock gasped, ashamed. "I wasn't thinking. Please sit down." Sherlock gestured to the bed, which had been straightened up with what must be clean sheets. They were too white to be anything else. John flashed him an inscrutable look, which could have meant any one of a thousand things. Sherlock's bravado instantly withered and died.
Having previously, and far too tenderly, in Sherlock's snarky opinion, prepared said arse for penile penetration (Sherlock's cringingly clinical euphemisn, not John's), the doctor doused their vital body parts with surgical grade lubricant, and nudged his cock slightly into Sherlock's furl.
being challenge, yeah? But things are better now than what they were, and you have John, and he has you, and that fucker Moriarty is six feet under, and - " and suddenly Greg ran out of steam and slumped into the worn leather of the couch. "And Molly and I are now an item, and Mycroft's on a diet. So's all's well that ends well, Christ in heaven."
"Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Thinking out loud, yeah?" John hedged, and for once, his lover let an anomaly slip by without doggedly examining it further. The doctor shifted uneasily. Or, at least, he made the attempt. Annoyed, John realized that his lower half had gone altogether numb, unresponsive to the signals from his brain. "Look, love," he said, poking Sherlock's ribs. "I need to get up, or you need to get your enormous arse off. One or the other, of both, I'm not particular. The circulation to my lower extremities is blocked." He slapped Sherlock’s arse for added emphasis.
"Care for a nightcap?" Sherlock's voice wafted from the kitchen sounding muffled, as if he'd covered his lips with a hand. He strode long-legged and irritated back into the sitting room, a coffee cup of whisky flush against the rim of his mouth. He'd kindly brought the bottle clutched in his hand, one strong finger looped through the handle of a mug. "It's unfortunate that John neglected to do the washing up today. All of our tumblers are dirty."
"Fuck!" the little man barked from inside the depths of his jumper. "It's fine. It's all fine." Peering from under his sweat-dampened fringe, he said "Sherlock, you're just being you. I'm a bit cut up at the moment, 'ts alright." He straightened up. "Carry on, Greg. Let's get this bloody thing over with, shall we please?" John yanked his jumper from it's resting place over his nose.
"Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness." - Sigmund Freud
John tossed the phone away as if it was radioactive. He cursed, instantly regretting his panicked impulse. Damning his father to hell for giving him these bloody short limbs, John circumnavigated the bed until he spied the luminescent glow of the phone screen. Fortunately, it had landed by the foot of the bed frame within easy reach. He nabbed it and clicked on the screen.
Clearing his throat, John raised it up as an offering, but Sherlock remained lost in his frenzy of flapping. John was actually being jostled as he perched atop Sherlock's lap. There was nothing for it. Struggling, John attempted to grab his lover's wrist with his hand. The two men were instantly engaged in a wrestling match, and John wasn't scoring any points.
There was something worshipful about John's voice, making the name a one-word prayer. "God, I love you so much, I can barely stand it. I'm yours. I give myself to you."
Beforehand, the lovers had sworn not to touch on the subject of pillows, or lack thereof. For that matter, they'd agreed to avoid conversation at all. This was a time for fucking, not in depth scientific observation.
You fought a war, fought the good fight just like I did. The difference is, Sherlock, that I fought in a unit. I had mates. I had back-up. I had support. Hell, I had a whole
John sat still as a statue. The diminishing light had transformed his deep blue eyes into black holes, absorbing the face of his friend. "Sherlock?" he whispered, "what are you doing?"
"No, not now. I need to do some thinking." Sherlock's shoulders dropped and he looked like he'd just lost his dog. "Go now, and leave me alone."
The wan amber light from the overhead fixtures all but disappeared behind the bulk of a stretched-out, towering figure.
type of virgin." Cocking an eyebrow with (mostly) mock grandeur, the detective winked. "With my superior intellect and your vast experience... well. Shall I just say that our endeavour will be smashing?"
"John, I am sorry," Sherlock breathed at the edge of John's hearing, not really absorbing John's words. "Please forgive me my unkind behavior, my callousness. The way I came back was unfair. It was cruel."
"Stop right there," the genius grunted indignantly, disengaging in the most literal sense possible. "I am agonizingly aware of my previous asexual lifestyle, thank you. I don't need a recap."
Even whilst a child, not many things surprised Mycroft. Naturally, Sherlock had wept, suffering such a terrible fright. He was a baby, after all, already prone to wild and emotional outbursts. They'd crashed down all fifteen steps, after all; Mycroft felt a bit drippy himself. No, what surprised Mycroft was his brother's instantaneous and unexpected outrage.
It remained an unequivocal fact: John's mental facilities were chemically altered immediately upon regaining consciousness. It was the obvious conclusion, considering the frankly ridiculous dose of morphine coursing through John's system
The detective twisted, an instinctive measure to land on his back. As these things do happen, however, the detective's momentum
therapists (hateful, sanctimonious, overbearing idiots, the lot of them), Sherlock launched into what he hoped wasn't perceived as hateful, sanctimonious, and overbearing claptrap, whereby he finished up sounding like an idiot. Nevertheless, he didn't hold out much hope. At least he had better taste in apparel.
"YES! Yes, a metaphor. John, as always, you are my conductor of light. You are brilliant," Sherlock beamed.
And, I believe I'm rather enjoying it." He squeezed his arms around Sherlock's torso for emphasis. "I don't know what I think. I just know what I feel." Leaning back to make eye contact, John spoke quietly, with intention. "And I feel this is very okay. It seems right."
"Sherlock!" he bellowed, grumbly voice made even rougher with tension. "Where are you, you great, bloody git?" The flat reeked of unrest, not so much empty as swimming in disquiet. It did not unoccupied, his detective instincts informed him, just...odd. Can a space feel lonely when lived-in? This one did, and the sensation increased his anxiety tenfold.
Sherlock's large feet thundered down wooden stairs, interrupting John's reverie. He held two pair of track shorts and ragged (but stretchy) pajama bottoms. The doctor pointed at the pajamas. Sherlock tossed them over, and they both looked away.
"What?" John squawked. "I'm not ill - even if I was sick in the loo. I lost it  because I - wait, are
Unlike the speech center of his brain, John's body was brilliantly expressive; dare one say, deliciously loquacious, in fact. Sherlock let fly an uncivilized groan amidst the collision between his flesh and John's mouth. He lay prone and helpless, rapt by the entreaty of those inconceivably clever, thin lips brushing the rigid peaks of his nipples.
"John! John, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to...Lestrade... please forgive my boorish behavior; I was out of line. I..." the genius fumbled lamely. He desperately wanted to reach out to touch John, yet held stock-still. He'd witnessed John's flashbacks more times than he'd ever cared to, not that he'd ever cared to. Neither enjoyed the nightmares John endured; John embarrassed, and Sherlock stymied as how to address his flatmate's shame.
"No, ta," the doctor muttered. "Sherlock is the one whom you should be tending to, he's gone pale as a sheet. I'm sorry, Sherlock," John lamented. "I won't be long...and I'm coming straight back to you, love, I promise." John snatched up the ends of the crutches and gamely forged a path through the mess. "Greg, concentrate your energies on him."
John curled around himself, fighting the urge to whimper. He resembled nothing more than a pissed-off and prickly hedgehog, burrowing into its den. The doctor's face shone sweaty and strained, reflecting the light from the windows. Sherlock blanched, deducing John's level of pain. More than a bit not good.
John now listlessly debated the likelihood that this particular patch of jeopardous fungi was a component in another experiment. It was that, or the result of shoddy housework. Either way, it didn't matter, black mould posed a serious heath hazard.
Sherlock," he paused, at pains to regain control, "I'm so sorry. I feel like my brains are melting. I don't know what I am doing anymore."
"The virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that which the wicked man does in real life." - Sigmund Freud
However, putting thought into words proved quite challenging, as John's touch morphed from clinically methodical to
Having said that, John and Sherlock will be back to shagging like demented rabbits over all of London Proper within, oh I don't know, two or three more chapters.
He bounced about on his bum. "I'll have you know that I haven't had the privilege of smoking one bloody cigarette since I've returned - or rather, after John came back. And, Christ, that's not from lack of trying. John, he..." his voice trailed off in the silence. "He watches me like a hawk."
Yes, they lived together, worked together, and saved each other's lives, but the relationship stopped there, thankyouverymuch. The friendship was strictly platonic, despite what it very much looked like...and John was
"Sherlock, if the last half-hour was any indication of your abilities in bed...well, hello Casanova!" John smiled sweetly. He reached out and drew Sherlock near to look in his eyes. "Surely your deductive skills told you that you utterly destroyed me just now. Jesus, Sherlock, I was so close to coming from your fingers alone that I - ."
I know...pretty short. But, in all fairness, it is really part of the last chapter. Stay tuned for more angst! LOL
Sherlock sat up. He shuffled back two feet and rose back up to his knees. His posture was one of a supplicant; he appeared stunted despite his body's long length. Honestly, Sherlock's demeanor was so out of character that John found himself backpedaling. Vehemently sweeping his tongue from from one side like a window washer, he sputtered, "Luh...
"No, I... Please don't go," Sherlock spurted in alarm. He frantically pressed his hands over John's forcefully as a pair of Lestrade's stainless steel handcuffs. "Touching you, being
"Mmmm. Nope, not really," John opined. "So, Greg! Tell me what happened with your nose. Did you catch that rat bastard baby-raping butcher? Is that the twat who busted you up?"

John finally wearied of his own pompous posturing, and chose not to press any further. He was too tired to bandy words, mentally and physically, but above all, in his soul. At any rate, two more laps completed the job. John stopped, hunkered low on his crutches. "So."
The DI cleared his throat again, more harshly this time. He'd picked a hell of a time to quit smoking. Ignoring the dangers of traffic, he flicked his dark eyes back to Sherlock. The consultant sat gazing out the window in seemingly vacant disinterest. Annoyed, Greg shook his head and went on. "Anyway, the parks have lots of sheltered areas; trees and hedges, and the like. Plenty of secluded places to commit kidnapping without anybody physically witnessing it. And shit, they're children's parks, for Christ's sake - oodles of screaming kids, parents' heads-up-their-asses on the phone. Who'd notice one
John pumped his cock faster. It was fully erect now, red-tipped and stiff. His head dropped to his chest in relief, pleasure and excitement drawing his mind away from the throb of his ankle.
Gently, Greg took possession of the bottle and walked it back in to the kitchen. He didn't bother with trying to locate the cap. The DI returned, bearing a large glass of water and two chalky round tablets of paracetamol. He'd swallowed three of his own in the kitchen whilst sucking water straight from the spigot. "John," Lestrade said loudly, "it's time to wake up. Sherlock and I are back from the case." The doctor's nose twitched, answering Greg with an ear-splitting snore. "John. Mate. I need a bit of doctoring here." Nothing doing. John was
Apparently, I just can't get these guys to shut up. The conversation...you guessed it...ensues. Also, over-gratuitous use of ellipses and italics.
"Best to get it over, don't you think?" Sherlock soothed whilst continuing to squeeze at John's legs. "Re-establishing your legs' blood flow will smart, irregardless of the length of time it takes. Breathe slowly, and ride it out. The manipulation of your tissues will diminish the time of discomfort."
foibles whilst you hide behind your frumpy wool jumpers?" Furiously hurt, and feeling cheated, Sherlock whirled and strode back in the kitchen. "Is this your idea of a game?"
The sitting room grew very still, the wilting second hand of a very ugly desk clock being only intentional movement. Lestrade glared at the piss-poor timepiece.
"Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism." - Sigmund Freud
Lestrade had been correct about one thing, at least. Children's parks made an excellent venue for stealthy abduction. His companion was nowhere to be seen.
Also, AO3 won't let me underline in this text box, so just assume that I knew that I was supposed to underline the book titles. Also, the dates for each work are a bit dodgy, depending on the veracity of each website.
Nevertheless. Sexual activity distracted him from The Work. Bloody hormones. Bloody, idiotic, moronic, pointless, nonsensical, mindless
The pint-sized logician deduced two salient facts immediately after the incident - "immediately" as in whilst still smothered by his brother's sweaty grasp. These two salient facts were as follows: one, Mycroft's injury was completely Sherlock's own stupid fault; and two, he'd give almost anything to be the one who'd come home  mummy-wrapped in plaster - Sherlock drew a firm line at his microscope.
Availing one bulky crutch, John fished the bundle closer and shook it out. Would it be crossing some secret, unspoken line if he donned it?
" Sherlock groaned, "pleeaaase..." Fumbling over the side table, he snatched up the lube and slapped the chilly container hard against John's more sensitive nipple. John's squeak of protest urged him to whack it twice more. "I'm
"Nonsense, John," the bloody git panted, skidding to a halt. "She was married for twenty years to a drug lord. Just imagine the filth she's been exposed to.
Unfortunately, Sherlock's body - to be precise, the parts that weren't reveling in bliss, put out an urgent appeal for attention. The strain of bridging John's length burned, blood caustic from building lactic acid. The genius took one-one thousandth of a second to tell his bellyaching limbs to piss off. Protecting John's ankle was tantamount, superseding his personal discomfort. Sherlock shifted, hoping to ease his aching muscles. Mind over matter, and such. Or, so they say.
"Tomorrow morning at the earliest. He requires morphine, and unless I can push Mycroft into sending him home with a vial or two, possibly the day after that."
John sobbed into his hands. "You are my everything, Sherlock! I love you, I love you so much! Why would you choose to go alone?""
quantity of whisky, or bourbon, or scotch. I'm not really picky at this point. Also, if they have one," he cleared his throat miserably, "a small plastic stool."
Eyeing John cautiously, Sherlock stepped closer. He carefully crouched down in the tiny square foot of space between his lover and the sink, precariously balanced on the balls of his feet. John held out his hand in repentance, palm upwards and trembling fiercely. Sherlock placed his own gargantuan palm on top and proceeded to thread their fingers snugly together to form a single unit. The detective brushed his lips over John's knuckles, anointing each joint with a soap-bubble soft kiss. "John," Sherlock breathed in despair, "This sounds ridiculous, coming from me, that is, but you have to stop being so impulsive. You're going to end up breaking your neck at the rate you're going."
It was due time to up the ante a notch. Resuming the softer approach, his tongue traced a liquid trail back to John's lips. They kissed.
"John?" Sherlock exhaled, and then stopped. The detective chided himself for his lack of coherence, terrified of losing all control. He felt emotionally stunted, almost impotent. "I - please, excuse me for that shameful display of hysterics. Most unbecoming a British gentleman, I know," he gurgled, sinuses swollen and full. Sherlock made a soggy attempt at some levity. "But, when have I ever truly been a..."
, I had to speculate on how a man like John would handle life without a "Mary" to support him. I hope that in penning this story I provide a viewpoint both realistic and entertaining, and
At precisely half two in the morning, John was wheeled into the surgery's recovery room. Two metal pins and three bone fragments shy of a complete tibia later, well... perhaps Sherlock should find John's old cane. At least John could rest assured that his new limp wasn't psychosomatic.
They clumped up the stairs with taut military precision. As usual, the door to the flat was wide open. The muted sounds of crap telly drifted from the sitting room, possibly
The doctor stalled, hoping for clarification. Sherlock declined to speak, however, or even make eye contact. Breathing harshly, his fingers twisted together like dueling octopi; squeezing his hands free of blood.
The detective's beautiful mouth twisted in an sour moue. "No! My ears, they’ll bleed if you subject me to any more lurid tales about all those...
"I cannot face with comfort the idea of life without work; work and the free play of the imagination are for me the same thing, I take no pleasure in anything else.” - Sigmund Freud
Now this. This triggered a response.  John made a valiant effort to focus on Sherlock without meeting much success. He settled for gazing up at the ceiling, and instead marshalled his willpower to gain full consciousness. "Uuungh."
The doctor shifted his arse side-to-side until he found a comfortable position on the mattress. Neither man spoke whilst Sherlock shucked his rubberized vest. John fought the urge to look away. The sight was reminiscent of interminably long patrols in the sun, where curled, dried-up snake skins caught on the laces of your boots.
-us Greg, give a bloke a heart attack, why don' you?" he snarled, squinting up into the DI's black-and-blue face.
"And worth every last pence, love. It feels fabulous against my skin," John groaned, flushing, "all my skin, including the inside bits."
"No, wait," the detective protested, a moot point since he'd already prevented John's departure. "Listen. My testicles struck your abdomen with a slight modicum of too much forward momentum. My bollocks were compressed, but only a
The tea tasted of bitter tannins and..here John blanched, last week Friday's Rogan josh. Sherlock must have used one of the cups that had lain mouldering in the sink; the food side, if he was lucky. The stale coriander aftertaste  left John more than a little bit queasy. Nevertheless, he would have overlooked the poor state of his meal if Sherlock kept his thoughts to himself. After all, the doctor mused, he had enough going on chewing charcoal.
"I've never been. I never saw it first-hand. But my aunt did," John continued, timbre tender. Hypnotic. "She took a whole mess of pictures. I was leery at first, she tended to give hours' long slide shows. My father always forced us to watch...he was
Lips forming a speculative moue, Sherlock repeated his manipulations. Now, however, he had both hands roaming industriously across John's chest. John's nipples tightened rock-hard, whilst he squirmed and thrashed on his mound of pillows. "Jesus, Sherlock, that's...yeah," John whimpered, "yeah, that's good - Christ, that's good. I thought you said you were a virgin!"
With all due respect, I'm not an innocent," the lanky man groaned. "I'm capable of handling extreme stress."
John momentarily flashed back to that night, the very hour that Sherlock returned from the dead. He'd pulled a Lazarus, flaunted his brilliance, immediately re-opening the wound in John's heart. The detective's blithe "Great Reveal" froze John solid, soul stiffening into a state of glaciation. Crystalized ice replaced the blood in his veins. It wasn't one of the detective's more tactful deeds in his very long list of faux pas.
Whatever is there, hidden under your shirt, that doesn't matter to me." John sucked in air, suddenly panicked. "No, no, that came out wrong. That's not what I meant."
"No!" Greg startled. "No, nothing like that, Sherlock. I swear!" He rubbed his forehead in exhaustion. "Actually, I was hoping that you'd go in for both of us, and we'd drink it here, in the car. I'm not much up for anything other than a hefty dose of caffeine and some painkillers," this last said with an apologetic smile. "Honestly, if you're not up to going in, which I completely understand, mind, I'll just drive us back to the flat. I should...yeah. I should have John have a look-see at my," he gestured lamely, "my nose. I don't know much how this goes, with broken noses. I might need to have the damn thing re-set."
"Yeah. I need you to stop sitting shivah, or shall just I cover the mirrors?" John sniped in misery. "I'm not dead yet. Just...go do something. Go piss off Lestrade, or blow up the kitchen. Please," he groaned. "I've been here before. I can handle the pain. You, on the other hand, are becoming unbearable."
When they got to Baker Street, John let Sherlock go inside while he took care of paying for the taxi.  As the brunette man climbed the stairs tiredly, he became aware of a deep penetrating soreness that was slowly stealing over his entire body, probably from the uncontrollable trembles that had wracked his body and the tenseness that being terrified brought into his muscles.
He could think of nothing else, could not get enough of holding him, touching him, watching him.  It was like the thinnest needle being pressed into this vein and injecting the headiest drug—it was better than anything he had ever taken in the past, far more addictive and dangerous and overwhelming.
“But what if I wanted it to happen again?” Sherlock asks, eyes earnest.  “What if I wanted to see you like that again, to have you take me like that?”
Instead, he just wanted to drink enough to get that fuzzy, light-headed feeling that made things seem less stressful than they really were.
“Yeah, that one.  At the Yard we just call ‘em anti-Synaths.  Anyways, there was a rally at one of the medical plazas in downtown London, and a few of them were feeling froggy and they snatched up a pregnant bloke—just took him right as he was walking out the front door of the doctor’s office—and decided to try to make an example out of him.”
“But enough of that,” Dr. Greenwhich said, spinning in his chair once again so that he was facing Sherlock once more. “I don’t mean to put a damper on such a wonderful day for you two boys. Penny,” he called out to the ultrasound technician, “are we up and running?”
“God, baby,” John moans into Sherlock’s mouth as he rolls his hips into the body below him.  He can feel Sherlock’s hand between them, where he is pumping his own cock as John grinds himself into Sherlock’s leg.   “I have to touch you.  Please say I can touch you.  Let me, let me,” he mumbles, begs.  He doesn’t even really know what he is saying, he is so out of his mind with desire.  “I can make you feel so good, I promise.  Please, baby, please.”
Sherlock shakes his head, grinding down into John’s lap once more and panting at the feeling of John’s hardness against his arse cheeks.  “Just one.  But he’s a dirty old man.”
This is very true; John can’t deny that.  John sighs and wraps Sherlock up in a tender hug, letting the child hide his face in John’s chest.  “Tell me all about it, love.”
John watches as Sherlock’s mouth snaps shut and his eyes go wide, and John tries not to let a victorious smile creep onto his face.
Sherlock blushes at John’s gentle touch, still unused to such treatment from anyone, and lowers his head to try to hide it.  He doesn’t look at John as he gives a nod, agreeing to try the patches.  And since Sherlock isn’t looking at him anyway, John takes the opportunity to beam proudly at his boy, tangling their feet together underneath the table as he leans back in his chair and drinks his tea.
Sherlock seems to hesitate for only a moment before he answers, his words stinging and painful in their harsh honesty.  “I wanted to know who I could buy from here in London,” he tells John truthfully.  “I wanted to know who I could trust to sell to me, what was safe to use, what was worth spending money on.  I was curious.”  His words are simple, succinct.  “I couldn’t help myself.  I never can, you know that.  I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  It’s not your fault, though,” he is quick to reassure John, looking up at him.  “You’ve done such a good job taking care of me.  It’s not your fault that I just can’t be helped.  That I’m always going to end up back here, no matter what.  I’ve told you before: I’m broken and I’ll always be broken, no matter how much you try to put me back together.  Just like you, John.  We can’t fix each other completely.”
“Fucking hell, that’s amazing,” John pants as his head drops down to rest against Sherlock’s shoulder.  “You’re amazing.”  His hand slips in between them, gripping Sherlock’s cock, and they move in time with each other.  The roll of their hips is messy and stuttering, trying to find a way to match each other’s pace while still making the other feel good.
Sherlock turned to the small mirror that hung on one wall, looking at himself as objectively as he could in the wan light of the hospital room.  He looked more drained than usual, even when he was on a particularly arduous case.  The septicemia and peritonitis had taken a toll on him, and even the fatigue from the emotional labor and delivery of Callum was still present.  His movements were still a bit stiff and slow, especially when standing up or stretching, thanks to the stitches in his abdomen, but his now loose maternity shirts were a great relief, as they didn’t hug his frame the way his pre-pregnancy clothes usually did.  He was slightly thankful that Mrs. Hudson had had the foresight to bring one of the larger shirts for him, and not an older one.
to be punished, John! I broke every moral code I upheld. I have blood on my hands that will never wash off," he moaned, scrubbing his hands restlessly on his trousers. "I didn't even care, anymore. All I could think of was
Sex. A lot of sex. Did I mention sex? And I am SO sorry that I took so long to post. I went through a ridiculous number of re-writes. And I got a new job. Aaaannnd...I spent a week in bed with influenza A. In case anyone was wondering, yes, I did get the flu vaccine. Anyway. I hope you all enjoy.
John froze, a deer in the headlights. His mouth gaping open, he stuttered "Well, uh..." His face flushed a deep pink, the tip of his nose almost red. His legs wobbled weakly.
The detective waited with out-of-character humility for an answer whilst watching John's pointless attempt to get comfortable. The doctor beat the tired cushions with ruthless abandon, irritated now beyond reason. With his harsh thrashings, the split in John's jeans yawned wide open. A triangle of golden brown thigh peeked through. This patent exposing of thigh recalled the taunting of (gay) male strippers. Sherlock shook his head in self-disgust, appalled at associating those images with John. He had some serious deleting to do.
"I'm not going to get bored!" an impertinent bass rumbled loud across the flat. "You fascinate me, John. Every day. You are an enigma, John! A conundrum! In fact, you annoy the ever...you irritate me because I just can't figure you out!"
"He does!" Moriarty sang. "And when we're in bed, the passion floods through the sheets like blood through the body. And when he co..."
"No need to shout." Mrs. Hudson unlocked the door. The flat was dim, with the smell of mildew and the sound of leather on flesh.
"If I have to dance with one more of these interminable people I fear Lestrade will have a mass homicide to investigate. Shall we leave the festivities early?" John nodded enthusiastically, and Sherlock lead him through the croud to a discreet door John hadn't formerly noticed. There was a blur of dark hallway, and then the click of a latch. Sherlock had lead John into a rather large closet.
"John and me 'ere were having a grand ol' snog until Mr. Cheekbones here decided to throw me at a wall." Sherlock was seething. Lestrade looked at the man, and felt his stomach drop. No one had told him the rule, and who knows what hell Sherlock would release on the man. Lestrade shook his head, but Sherlock beat him to speaking.
"You are mine." The words are a growl, truthfully almost a snarl. Sherlock pulls out of John, and collapses next to him, pulling John to him. Sherlock is asleep in seconds.
"Are you just leaving me like this?" John smiled, and walked out the door, calling over his shoulder to the dark haired main bound to the bed.
"Cliches apply if they're true. I don't like seeing other people touch you. I want to be the only one that gets to. I want exclusivity," Sherlock grimaced, as if considering something terrible, "but only if you agree to it." John thought for a moment, and then stood.
Sherlock retrieved a ladder, and began dropping light bulbs off of it onto the floor. John came into the flat, and stared, as Sherlock dropped 5 more bulbs off the ladder.
The game, was on. Mummy greeted Sherlock and John at the door, she'd already had a glass of champagne, obvious from the scent of Dom Pérignon on her breath.
The rest of the meal was spent with Sherlock trying hard to eat his remaining meal at a more human pace, and John looking at everything in the small kitchen except the consulting detective, afraid he would scare him off like some sort of wild, rabid animal.
Sherlock’s answering smile is shy, with an accompanying blush.  They continue walking, and John can’t help but notice that Sherlock’s eyes constantly stray to their connected hands, as if he is reassuring himself that it is real.  He squeezes Sherlock’s fingers again to show him that it most certainly is real, and it is not going to stop anytime soon.  John had told him they could do this all day long, after all.
John thinks as he frowns slightly.  That can’t be right; Mary never shoves her knees up into his kidneys like this.  Only Sherlock does that.
“Hmm,” John says noncommittally as he chuckles and chases after Sherlock, scrambling across the blankets.  “Sucks for you, then.”
John cringed at the fact that a very private part of his life was apparently the workplace gossip. He didn’t rightly know how he was ever going to show his face at Scotland Yard again. Perhaps they could move away, far from colleagues and strangers who knew what went on in their bedrooms.
John didn’t even crack an eye.  He only shuffled a bit in the creaky wooden chair and made a noise of appreciation in his throat.  “Hmm, yes.  Very good,” he said sleepily.
John licks his lips but he won’t be made to back down.  Not by this man.  “Who says I trust him?” he counters, jaw clenching tight as he grinds his teeth together.
The man drifted off into silence and John waited patiently for him to continue, until he couldn’t wait anymore. “Well, what?”
But Jesus, he can’t stop thinking of bending Sherlock over his knee and smacking his plump little bottom until it’s red and raw and Sherlock is whimpering and straining against his lap, hard from John’s hand on his arse and begging to come.
Sherlock shifts uncomfortably in his lap, though, and John tries to focus on the moment.  Sherlock is obviously trying to talk about something he is embarrassed about, and John knows he should probably pay attention.  “Do you think I should take the tests again and get accepted somewhere else?”
“Perfect, baby.  You’re so perfect,” John praises him, kissing him softly on his open mouth at the same time that he slides his cock into Sherlock’s hole.  “You’re so good for me.  My good boy.  You deserve a reward for being so good for me.”  He pauses when he bottoms out inside of Sherlock, growing still.  “I’m going to fuck you now, hard,” John informs him plainly.
He was at the end of his cycle of pills, and for the past 2 days he could do nothing but lie in bed, in too much pain to even jump at the call from Lestrade about a case.
“Why is it always like this with us?” John asks after a moment, his forehead resting against Sherlock’s as he sits facing the boy.  Sherlock is practically in his lap, straddling him.  “How is it that you can drive me round the fucking twist, make my life hell, make me think that everything would just be so much easier without you…and then in the next breath I know that I could never live without you?  It’s not healthy, Sherlock,” John tells him in all seriousness, shaking his head, their brows rolling across one another’s.  “It’s not right.”
Sherlock moves suddenly towards John, and the look on his face is so furious, so livid, that for a moment John fears that he may be hit.  He brings his hands up, palms facing outward as a show of supplication, but Sherlock doesn’t slow.  In fact, he reaches a large pale hand of his own out and grabs John’s left wrist tightly.
“Ah!” Sherlock cries out, biting his lip, and instead of a sound of pleasure it is one of pain.  John pauses for a moment, confused, before he remembers Sherlock’s sore, reddened bum.
“No,” the boy answers quickly, succinctly.  He is still staring at John with that strange, unreadable look and his unblinking gaze is unsettling in both its intensity and colour.  And he can’t be sure but John thinks there is a shameless smile curling the corners of Sherlock’s lips, as if he is enjoying the way that John has begun to fidget.
“You’re such a silly arse,” John teases, kissing him back with small little pecks of lips against Sherlock’s cheeks and chin, moving across the bridge of his nose.
When Sherlock hears him come back into the bedroom, he straightens up and turns to John, his bright gaze raking down John’s frame and staying for a second longer than is decent.
For what, he couldn’t yet tell. As far as he was concerned, the screen looked like a bad telly that was turned to an off-air channel. It was snowy and murky-looking, and Sherlock couldn’t distinguish one thing on the screen from another.
“I’m going to make you soup, something light, and you’re going to eat it,” he tells the boy, turning back around and speaking without looking at Sherlock.  He’s so mad at him that he doesn’t think he could even get the words out if he had to say them to Sherlock’s face.  He begins puttering around the kitchen, getting out pots and pulling out soup cans.  “You’ll probably tell me that you won’t want it, but we’ll both know that’s a lie when the withdrawals start.  I can guarantee you haven’t eaten anything in days, though, so a light soup is all you’re getting, otherwise you’ll be sick.”  His voice is light and conversational, and it sounds robotic and disconnected even to his own ears.  He doesn’t know what he’s doing, he doesn’t know what he’s saying, why he keeps talking to fill the awful silence that has settled between them now that Mycroft is gone.
John rubs the head of his softening cock along Sherlock’s cheeks, over his closed eye.  He drags it down to Sherlock’s mouth and just slides it over the plump flesh of his bottom lip a few times, back and forth, before dipping it into the brunet’s mouth, squeezing the last drops of come out onto Sherlock’s tongue.
The doctor pressed the small wand part of the Doppler to Sherlock’s lower abdomen, digging into the soft flesh.  It looked uncomfortable as she moved the stick around to find the perfect spot, and he saw Sherlock grimace slightly.
“If you have a genius level IQ, what are you doing at a shitty secondary school like the one here?” he wonders instead, veering the conversation in a completely different direction.  He’s curious now, though.
“Oh, fuck,” John grits out between clenched teeth.  The heat and tightness of Sherlock’s body always surprises him, no matter how many times he’s fucked Sherlock now.
“You’re such a fucking tease, you know that?” John asks him, biting at Sherlock’s plump bottom lip and making him inhale sharply.  John’s hands move down immediately to the front of Sherlock’s trousers, making quick work of his belt, his movements sharp and jerky.  Beneath the material of Sherlock’s clothes John can feel that the teen is already hardening.  His own cock finishes filling out in interest.  “I know you did it on purpose.  You wanted me to know you were wearing them.”
Sherlock’s heart jumped into his throat and his mouth filled with bile at the thought of what these men could do to him, here in these back alleys where no one would see.  “Stay away from me,” he said, loudly and, despite the gun that he knew he could draw at any moment, his voice still shook slightly as trembles wracked his body from the cold wind blowing around him and the sudden terror at hearing the man’s words.
Sherlock takes him wonderfully, just like John has taught him after all this time.  The teen’s hands tighten on his thighs and John can feel Sherlock’s breath come out in a large strangled huff through his nose against the soft, curly hair at the base of his shaft.  He presses Sherlock’s face deeper into his groin and he knows that he can’t hold Sherlock on him for much longer, but he savours the sweet heat of it for just a second more.  Sherlock swallows around him, trying to cough, and John pulls him back in a rush, looking down at him as Sherlock gags and gasps for breath.
Sherlock feels so fragile above him that John thinks he might shatter the boy if he holds him too tightly, but the desperate fear churns in his stomach that Sherlock will fly away from him if John doesn’t hold him tight enough.  He doesn’t know what to do, how to proceed into this new, frightening territory, so he simply continues stroking Sherlock’s cock while his other hand runs incessantly along Sherlock’s side and back, his lips touching every bare piece of flesh that they can.
John was bordering on becoming hysterical.  Sherlock knew this, but he didn’t try to comfort the man.
“John,” Sherlock breathes out, their lips still touching.  John can feel Sherlock’s mouth twist into a smile against his own and John lets out a tiny sigh of relief that he hadn’t known he had been holding in.  “Yes,” Sherlock says, kissing him.  “Yes, of course I will.”
“Cheers,” Mike says with a laugh, reaching across the table to grab John’s pint and raising it as he takes a drink.
Sherlock moans contentedly at the feeling.  “Mmm, no.  Happy,” he responds, words slurred with sleepiness.
“You love it, don’t you?” John asks, voice husky with arousal and the last remnants of sleep.  “You want to suck my cock so badly.”
!” Sherlock shouts, his body bucking.  John grins and uses his other hand to hold onto Sherlock’s hip, keeping him from pulling away.
Mary scoffs at that, a derisive little laugh that hurts John and makes him cringe.  “So that you can run off with your teacher’s aide?” she asks mockingly, voice dripping with venom and malice.  “Not a fucking chance, John.  All these years that we’ve been having problems you’ve never wanted to leave me, you’ve never agreed to divorce me when I wanted it.  But now that you’re getting a piece of arse on the side you want to just throw our marriage away, when it’s convenient for you?  That’s real chivalrous, John.  How
Their meetings at the coffee shopshop quickly begin to grow longer, their conversations deeper and more personal—the exact thing that John had tried to avoid in the past.  Now, though, he finds that he wants to know everything about Sherlock, all of it, and he can’t believe that he had ever denied himself the chance to learn more about the boy.
“I…” he groaned in pain, clenching his teeth and lips around an almost animalistic sound.  “Ah!  Less than an hour.  I think.  Since a bit before Mrs. Holloway came in.”
“So, now that I’m legal,” Sherlock says one night as they grab their orders—a tea and a chocolate muffin for John and a double espresso for Sherlock—and head towards a table at the back of the shop, “let’s have dinner.”
“If it’s only the first time it’s happened, then I probably won’t be able to feel it,” he said to Sherlock, reluctantly removing his hand and sitting up in a more comfortable position.  “It will still be at least a week or two before the movements are big enough that other people can feel them.”
John grabs Sherlock by the shoulders and digs his fingers into Sherlock’s skin roughly, pushing him back and shoving him harshly against the wall.  “No,” he answers Sherlock’s question, bringing his mouth crashing down on the teen’s as he presses Sherlock harder against the wall.
“Isn’t it perfect, John?” he asks breathlessly, coming up close behind the man in the sitting room and wrapping his arms low around John’s waist, resting his chin on John’s shoulder.
“Well it certainly doesn’t mean you care about me any more, either,” Sherlock snaps back, letting his anger show through for the first time since they started having this conversation.
And suddenly there is the wet, warm splash of something hitting the skin of his cheek, the bridge of his nose, the closed cavern of his mouth.  He feels drops of it fall on his forehead and some dribbles down the side of his face, turned upward as it is, to catch in the creases of his ear.
“I love you,” he whispers against Sherlock’s lips, dry from panting.  “I love you so much, you have no idea.  I love you so much that I don’t even know what to do,” he confesses.
He nodded silently and stood, following her with one last look of trepidation behind him, at the growing crowd that seemed to be pushing itself closer to the windows.
“I think you have me mistaken for someone else,” Sherlock told him politely, making to turn away from the small group and continue on his way.  He had been confronted by so many strangers lately that he could tell with just one look which ones were going to offer comforting, encouraging words and which ones were going to curse at him and throw things.
Sherlock’s light green eyes narrow as he looks at the man sitting across the table from him.  “Incredible?  Why is it incredible?” he asks suspiciously.
.  Sherlock is constantly pushing John’s boundaries, always wanting more, always taking whatever he can get from the man.  It’s fucking ridiculous that John puts up with it.
After a moment of injured silence, Sherlock’s deep baritone voice cut through the stillness. “You sure are rowdy tonight. What’s crawled up your arse?”
Mike laughs again, enjoying John’s sex-induced misery too much for the man’s own good.  “So, you can still write up prescriptions, huh?” he asks shiftily, his smile growing decidedly evil at the edges.  “Why don’t you write up that Viagra for a few months’ supply and you can split it with me.   You know,” he says with an indifferent shrug, finishing off the last of his lager.  “For my troubles and all.”
His answer seems to surprise the elder Holmes, who might have never thought that his little brother was anyone who was worth saving, who was worth risking anything for.  He stares at John for a long moment, that blank look on his face which John knows means that he has shocked a Holmes into silence.
He trembles above the brunet and tries to pull away from him, away from that penetrating gaze, but Sherlock reaches out to stop him, to keep him close.  When John turns back to him, he sees that Sherlock’s eyes are wide, his mouth parted slightly in shock.  John thinks about what Sherlock must be seeing, with his sharp eyes and even sharper mind.  He thinks about how awful it must look to the younger male.
“When was the last time he touched you?” Sherlock asks above him, his voice dark and deep, sending shivers through John’s already trembling body.  Neither men are wearing any clothing, and the flat is slightly chilled, but John knows that isn’t the reason he is shaking.
The man wonders if Sherlock excels in all of his classes the way he excels in John’s.  Though the teen seems perpetually bored or devastatingly uninterested during lessons, there is no denying that Sherlock knows his course material.  It fascinates John endlessly.  Everything about Sherlock fascinates John even though the older man knows that it shouldn’t.  He tries to tell himself that he is simply looking out for Sherlock’s welfare; that he only has Sherlock’s best interests at heart.  And he believes himself rather easily.
“Greg, this is absurd!” the blonde man shouted out, throwing his hands up in exasperation and huffing at the incongruity of the situation, turning away from the detective as if he couldn’t even stand to look at him anymore.  “Sherlock didn’t do anything wrong,” he said, turning back around suddenly to face Lestrade with the ferocity of a man who knows he is in the right.  “And now you’re going to take away the only thing he has to defend himself with, since you idiots aren’t doing your jobs!”
Just then, Sherlock takes the opportunity to stir, blinking blearily awake.  It takes him all of one second to notice that John is not in bed next to him.  Even in the mirror John can see those quicksilver eyes sharpen and narrow as Sherlock wakens in an instant and searches him out, finding him across the room.
Sherlock kisses him back and smiles, and John hates that he has to open the door but it can’t be helped.  The world keeps going, and what he and Sherlock have is something that still has to be hidden because no one else would understand.  No one would understand it just like no one understands Sherlock.  So John pulls away and lets Sherlock step out into the real world once more, and John follows close behind him because John doesn’t know how to do anything else now.  He’ll follow Sherlock anywhere.
But John is quicker, and John is heavier, and John has had enough of Sherlock’s petulant little strop.
Living with Sherlock in London is wondrous and magical.  It’s everything John had hoped for, everything he thought it would be.
“One day I’m going to see how many times I can make you come in one night,” John promises him on a hushed murmur, bringing his idle hand up to card through Sherlock’s hair once again.  Sherlock leans into his touch like a cat.  “You’re so responsive that I bet I can get you off at least three times before your body runs dry.  God, I want to drain you completely, show you how it feels.  Will you let me?”
Yes, he recognized John’s voice now, strong and steady and comforting.  He vaguely felt someone grab his hand in a disconnected sort of way, as though the nerve endings and receptors of his body weren’t quite reaching completely to his brain properly.
, Sherlock thought to himself, taking a quick scan of the living room to find—right there: a rather large bag of biscuits sitting next to an almost-empty teacup.
“John!” he hears her call after him.  He ignores her, racing out of the house and into his car instead, not even bothering to remember his cane.
He reaches down to stroke Sherlock’s stiff prick a few times, gathering the precome which always flows so freely from Sherlock’s tip.  He knows they don’t have any lube, so he prepares to limit himself to only fingering the teen for a little while before moving on to other things.  However, when he drags his fingers across the small pucker of muscle and finds it wet with lube and already pliant and loose, he stops and stares down at the boy, pulling back slightly to look at him in confusion.
“Why?” John asked, exasperated.  He was beginning to get more than a little frustrated with dealing with Sherlock’s ever-changing double standards.  “You just said you wanted—”
He doesn’t wait any longer.  He shuts the duck off and drops it into the water, then wraps his hand around Sherlock’s engorged and straining cock.  Sherlock releases a tiny little huff of air but John is already there, bent over him in the tub, kissing his mouth and swallowing the sound down.
“You did a good job of staking your claim,” he said through his reflection in the living room mirror over the mantelpiece the next afternoon, the comment directed at Sherlock as the brunette man sat idly in John’s red chair, long legs folded ridiculously against his lumpy body as he tried to squeeze his considerable height into the plush cushions.  He was still in his pajamas from that morning when John had left to go to work.
Sherlock groaned at the reminder of it and shuffled uncomfortably on the cushions of the couch, but he didn’t pull away from John’s hand, or ask the doctor to move.  “It’s been dreadful,” he answered, squeezing his eyes shut at the thought of it.  “Every day I think I’ve vomited myself into death by dehydration, but it just keeps coming.  And the cramping has been getting worse, too.  How do women stand this?”
“I want you, Sherlock,” John tells him.  John will tell him as many times as Sherlock wants him to.  “I need you.  I won’t be able to live my life without you.  It’d be dull and empty if you’re not here with me.  I’ll keep you here with me, always,” he whispers into the crown of Sherlock’s dark head.  The previous day had been the first time he had admitted wanting Sherlock, but John knows that—now that he has said the words—they won’t simply lie dormant inside of him.  After all this time of fighting his feelings, he acknowledges that he has wanted Sherlock for so long; he has wanted to hold him just like this, and kiss him, and keep him.  John has wanted Sherlock in ways he has barely allowed himself to think about before now, ways that feel simultaneously wrong and so, so right.
“All right, now?” he asks, a small smile playing on his lips as he continues looking on at Sherlock hugging his bee happily.
Sherlock whimpers above him, dropping his head down onto John’s shoulder and biting delicately to keep in the soft, needy noises he is making as he tries to grind down on John’s fingers, tries to take the man in.
Sherlock turns his face further into John’s thigh, hiding what looks suspiciously like a blush, before he mumbles out a soft, “John?”
Sherlock chuckles and obliges quickly.  “So good for me, you open so well,” he praises John, and his voice is dripping with pride for his lover.
“I never agreed to such a thing,” Sherlock states matter-of-factly, as if that’s the only explanation he owes Greg.  “Beside it’s ultimately John’s decision, you know that.  I won’t deny him anything that he wants.  So if you’re going to blame someone, it should be him.”
When it all seemed to be crashing down on top of him, he would take a moment to breath, and lay his long fingers across his swollen belly, and smile softly.
Normally John wouldn’t allow such impudence from his little one, but he wants Sherlock’s cock in his mouth just as much as Sherlock does.  So when the slim hips thrust forward and the tip of Sherlock’s prick smears slickly against John’s lips, the man can’t help but open wide and suck him back down, taking him in to the hilt.
“Sherlock,” John warns, not liking where this is headed.  Things had been going so well.  “This isn’t negotiable.  You need to eat something.”
“Come make Daddy feel good now,” he says softly, pulling Sherlock gently back to sit up in his lap.  “Can you do that, baby?”
Mycroft had a rather unfortunate and annoying habit of showing up at their flat unannounced and uninvited those first few weeks, when their belongings were being unpacked and the two were still rather excited about the fact that John was finally free of the shackles of his suffocating marriage and were now living together.  Thankfully Mycroft had never come across anything brazenly scandalous or sexual, but the items he did come across could only point to one thing.  On one occasion, the elder Holmes had found an abandoned soft toy left out in the sitting room.  There had been a pack of crayons strewn about the floor in front of the fireplace on another visit, then a bottle of children’s Mr. Matey bubble bath set on the kitchen table waiting to be put away along with some other non-perishable groceries later on.  And once, while John and Sherlock were in the flat together, suffering through a dreadfully boring conversation with the man, Mycroft had been bold enough to dig through one of John’s half un-packed boxes in the sitting room and lift out a small carton of various sized, pirate-themed kiddie plasters.
“On another case,” John was continuing, “solving another puzzle, miles away from me even when you’re sitting in the same room as I am, listening to classical music so that the baby can hear it, playing your violin so that the baby can feel it, spending hours logging all of the information on your body and your measurements and your prognosis into those blasted little notebooks.”  John ticked off all of Sherlock’s faults on his hands, each finger coming up to count another one like a blow to Sherlock’s body, hurtful and harsh.
“Do you want to use your special word, Sherlock?” he asks quietly, his voice soothing and low, and although Sherlock is whimpering and sobbing John knows that he’s been heard.
He is extremely relieved when the kid miraculously obeys him and doesn’t text him for the rest of the day.
But he had to know.  He had to hear the words, from John’s lips.  Needed to hear John say that he was being stupid and immature and irrational.  For once in his life, he wanted to be those things.
know that.  If Sherlock realised just how much John would do for him, the brunet would have John eating out of the palm of his hand in no time.  Even more than he does now (which should be physically impossible, but John knows that if anyone can defy the laws of physics, it is Sherlock Holmes).
But the men surrounding him didn’t seem concerned at his lack of fear, if they noticed it at all.  Sherlock would have bet money that they didn’t—so absorbed in themselves they were.
He drinks it slowly, savouring it.  It reminds him of the tea his mother used to make, back when he was little.  He has always wondered why hers never failed to taste better, and why he can’t ever replicate it.  When she was still alive, she swore up and down that she didn’t use anything fancy, just PG Tips, but he is positive that it was different somehow.
“But what about before?” Sherlock asked, his tone not gentle. “When the anti-Synaths were gathering protest rallies at the Renaissance Medical Plaza, and the free clinics where men who didn’t want their identities traced were going to get the pills, and all the other doctor’s offices in London that were getting bombarded by those radicals? Where were you then?”
John smiles tenderly against Sherlock’s kiss.  “You’re welcome,” he mumbles as his lips slide over the other’s.  His hands slip down the length of Sherlock’s body, rubbing over the bony crests of his hips, John’s thumbs digging in.  “I love you, too, kitten,” he says, and Sherlock moans at the feeling of John’s hands pressing into him and leans back on the sofa, giving John more access to his body.
“We are done here,” Sherlock whispered vehemently, rising from his seat.  He couldn’t stand to be in this house, next to that man for one more second.  “I would like to return back to Baker Street.”
After a dreadful moment of silence that didn’t seem to bother Sherlock at all, Lestrade was the first to speak, his tone a bit confused and the look on his face slightly dazed.
“Come for Daddy,” John tells him, thrusting up into Sherlock with abandon.  “Come for me, baby, come on Daddy’s cock.  You can do it, it’s okay.”
She doesn’t have to say it because he knows it, deep down, where it wears at him and eats away at his pride, his self-esteem, his will.  She doesn’t have to say it, but even if she did, John wouldn’t argue with her because she is right, she is right about all of it, and he doesn’t have the strength to fight her anymore.
He felt sick, thinking about people taking that pill without any thought to the side-effects it might bring.  Organ failure, cancer, death, so many life threatening things that it could cause…
is about 36 hours’ worth of sleep and a hot meal with a strong cup of tea when you wake up,” John corrects him, finally fighting Sherlock to the edge of his bed.  He tries to slip out of John’s grasp, but the blond ends up wrapping his arms around the gangly, sharply-angled boy.  John lifts him up awkwardly for a split second before dropping him back down on the bed hard enough to make Sherlock bounce against the mattress.
The drunken man seemed to comprehend this, if only slightly, and he let up trying to lean back into John. Instead, he lifted his hand from John’s waist and cupped the blonde man’s cheek with it, his thumb stroking softly over John’s unshaven skin. “I like you, John. I may regret telling you this in the morning, but I don’t care. I just want you to be happy. With him or with me.”
The bell attached to the door rings loudly as he walks into the shop.  The barista doesn’t even come out of the back room, no doubt knowing that since Sherlock is already here, the only other patron tonight will be John.  As he walks to their little table in the back corner of the building, John sees that Sherlock has already ordered a tea for him and he knows that the shop-girl won’t be coming out to the counter for a while.  As usual, they are essentially alone.
John searches for the words to explain this to Mike, this madness that he still doesn’t fully comprehend himself.  He tries to describe it and comes up short because there are simply no words.  There is only emotion.  Love and fear and anger and joy and adrenaline.  The thrill of the unexpected, the alluring edge of danger.  It feels the same as it felt before he went on a raid, when his blood pounded through his veins and his heart beat furiously at the excitement of it all, and there was always the thought in the forefront of his mind that this feeling inside him was meant to create a bigger purpose, a better life.  It was meant to save people.
“—But the atomic weight of nitrogen can’t possibly account for the difference in results.  It just doesn’t make any sense.”
As Sherlock settles deeper onto John’s cock, he brings his hands between them to steady himself, and John notices with a grunt of surprise that he is still holding on to his bear, squishing it between them as they move against one another.  Tiny little pinpricks poke into John’s chest from where the wet, stained fur of the bear has dried to stiff points.  The thing will need a serious washing once they are through but John can’t really be arsed to care about that right now.  Not with Sherlock moving slowly, experimentally, up and down on his cock the way he is, squirming and wiggling his hips as he tries to feel all the different angles their position can provide.
“Read to me?” Sherlock asks him, shuffling into the sitting room of John’s house where the man is reading the paper and reclining in his favourite chair.  He settles on the floor by John’s feet, resting his dark, curly head on John’s knee.  They are both on holiday from school and have taken the opportunity to be alone in John’s home for the day, doing whatever they wish.  And, apparently, Sherlock wants to spend the day in his headspace, in the safe and fuzzy space flickering between being “little” and acting his true age, where he can skirt the lines of being John’s little boy and get doted shamelessly on. “Please?”
Greg visibly cringed at John’s words, shoulders slumping and face turning away from the blonde.  “Yeah,” he said, looking chagrined.  “Yeah, you’re probably right about that.”  He moved away from John on the couch, a small movement that was painfully uncomfortable in its awkwardness, and John hated it.
Speaking of daddy kink, this may be the last chapter of "The Burning LIfe", but you haven't seen the last of the spin offs.  The next one will be posted soon, and it has dovetailed with the timeline for "TBL".  The spin offs that come after that will be posted in chronological order.  If you are reading those, I hope you find the rest of the posts enjoyable!
John pulls his hands away from Sherlock’s face and grabs the torch so that he can talk again.  “It’s one in the morning, Sherlock.  Are you really going to sit there and feed me some bullshit story about school bullies doing this to you?  I thought you were meant to be a genius.  What makes you think I would believe that for a minute?”  He puts the torch back in his mouth and moves his focus onto Sherlock’s arms.  “This wasn’t a bully,” he mumbles around the penlight.  The words are slightly impeded but he knows Sherlock can understand him.  “Do you want to tell me what really happened?”
John’s heart constricts in his chest and he holds onto Sherlock tighter.  They lie in silence for a long while, neither of them speaking again, just content to hold one another and be near each other.  John can see the sunlight make its way across his bedroom floor, the bright shine of it going dull and dim as mid-afternoon turns to late afternoon and then turns to early evening.
“I shouldn’t have eaten that spicy chicken fillet,” he grumbled, turning over onto his side for the hundredth time that night.
Sherlock, though, is not so easily discouraged.  “But what if I get stuck walking home in another storm?  Or I get hurt and no one else is around to help me?” he pesters, and his face is determined.  “Come on, Mr. Watson, you wouldn’t want that on your conscience, would you?”
Greg drops John’s chin and turns to glare at the younger man, a dark, thunderous look coming over his face.
“You should be at a better university, Sherlock,” John hears, as soon as he enters the building of 221 Baker Street.  Mycroft’s voice drifts down the stairs from the open door of flat B, and John sighs.  His young lover’s meddling brother is really the last thing John wants to deal with right now, after a long day at work.  He had been looking forward to coming back to the flat—
Sherlock lets out a small, shaky breath and closes his eyes against the feel of John’s touch.  John discovers that if he can’t see the beautiful, ethereal colour of Sherlock’s irises then there is no point in having his eyes open either.  He closes them and leans forward slowly until his lips are softly touching Sherlock’s.
But John moved away from him, walking towards the door of the flat decisively.  “I need some air,” he said.  “Going for a walk.”
Sherlock, though, seems like he could care less about that second fact.  He has set the duck down in his bath water and is watching as it bobs along above the waves that he makes with his legs, giggling at the sight of it.
The doctor was over by the other man in the span of seconds, taking Sherlock in his arms and hugging him tightly, pressing their lips together in what was probably the messiest, most eager kiss the two had ever shared.
“Please, can I have another?” Sherlock asks, without counting the previous one.  John should do something about it; he should punish Sherlock, or at the very least point out Sherlock’s mistake, but he could care less at this point.  He gives Sherlock two more of the spankings at random intervals, both hard, just how he knows Sherlock likes them.  Sherlock asks for one of them but John doesn’t give him the chance to ask for the next, and he counts for one but not the other.  John doesn’t mind, and Sherlock doesn’t seem to notice anymore.  His cock is rock hard and swollen red, and the tip is wet with precome that drips in a sticky line every so often down to the bed.
“Is this,” Sherlock starts and then stops to clear his throat.  He tries again.  “Is this all right?” he asks, voice almost small enough to get lost in the sounds of the city around them.
Sherlock doesn’t answer, and when John dares a glance back at him he looks like he really couldn’t care less.
“You don’t have to care what they think for their words to hurt your feelings,” John states, and his tone is harsh and upset, angry that people can be so mean to Sherlock without a second thought.  “I’m sorry that they act the way that they do towards you.”
At this Sherlock turns around sharply to face John, an affronted look on his face, pushed past his limits by all of John’s probing questions.  “I’ll have you know that I’ve been doing it since I was twelve, when my father was no longer able to hold down a job.  I hardly ever forget anything anymore,” he says rather sharply.  John can’t stop the small wince that pulls at his face at the thought of offending the boy but Sherlock continues, as if he doesn’t notice John’s sudden discomfort.
John stares at the bedroom door, his anger rising and feeling like a tit.  “Goddamn it,” he growls out, stomping towards the bathroom and opening the door, practically lunging for the second door connected to the bedroom from there.
Sherlock lets out a small huff of air, giving in because he knows John will be relentless in his pursuit of this, and lets his eyes fall towards the cushions of the sofa, away from John.  “Yes,” he finally answers, voice quiet.
So John clings tightly to Sherlock, pressing a kiss to his forehead, and feels Sherlock hold him back just as desperately.
John was drained from just a few hours of being on a proper case with the consulting detective again. They hadn’t been at it for a while now, what with Sherlock having been so sick the past couple of months. He missed the feeling of solving the case, sure, but he was coming to realize that a pregnant, achy, hungry Sherlock was not an evil that should be released on the world.
“No,” Sherlock responded, his breath coming in deep pants as a wave of nausea crashed into him.  His hands, slippery with a fine sheet of sweat, gripped at the edges of the desk helplessly, trying to find something to steady himself with.  “I really need to get to a hospital.”  He swallowed noisily, a big gulp of air that did nothing to help his breathing.  “Quickly.”
“Well, that went spectacularly pear shaped,” John says tiredly as he sits on the closed lid of the toilet inside of flat 221b back at Baker Street.  He had insisted that they clean up before heading back home, but the only place that they could think of to go to was Mrs. Hudson’s building.  So John had taken his small first aid kit out of his car and they had asked the woman if they could use the empty flat for just a little while, to wash up and rest for a bit.  She had said of course they could and had even told them that there was a bed left up in one of the rooms if they needed to stay the night, handing them some extra sheets that John insisted they didn’t need but that he took anyways, just to get her to go away.
He stops in the middle of the pub, staring at the scene before him and taking stock of what is happening, trying to make sense of it.
During this chapter, when Sherlock first tells John that he thinks John has a daddy kink, John responds by thinking: “His relationship with Sherlock is already illegal and morally ambiguous thanks to his position as Sherlock’s teacher along with their age difference; he’ll be damned if he is going to be a sexual deviant, as well.”  I would just to take this opportunity to say that any kinks are not deviant as long as they are safe, sane, and consensual.  At this point in this story, John still feels guilty about his whole relationship with Sherlock and this is why he is connecting certain desires he has for Sherlock with being a “sexual deviant”.  John’s views do not reflect the author’s own, and if he says something that offends you in this fic, I humbly apologize on his behalf.  He is an idiot, as you will come to find out many times over, later in this fic.
Yes, he knew that John would be beside him.  He knew that John would hold him up, make things better, easier.  He clung to John’s promise like a drowning man would cling to a life preserve.  And he thought of all of the other promises that John had made him, that John had kept, especially over the course of his pregnancy.
They crash through the door to the bathroom and somehow both manage to climb into the shower together without slipping and causing a major injury to themselves or each other.  They don’t bathe—they can’t be bothered.  They simply turn the water on and rinse all of the sticky breakfast toppings and semen away and then dry each other off and fall back into bed, still twisted up in each other and laughing like loons.
could be such an all-consuming force in the world.  Sherlock has a spark of life to him that seems almost as if it is ready to burn out of control, consuming anyone who stands too close.  There is a frightening genius that teeters on the cusp of something great, if only the boy could have a little bit more time to grow into himself.  John thinks Sherlock is an absolute wonder and marvels at his intelligence, his humour, his view of the world every single time the brunet opens his mouth.
Maybe John was right after all.  Maybe he couldn’t take care of this child he was about to have.  If he couldn’t even pick out a carton of milk without knowing what it was he was about to buy, how on earth was he possibly going to do everything else?
“I know, darling.  That was intense.  I hadn’t meant to….”  John trails off as he tucks himself into his pants, realising he sounds awkward.  He leaves his trousers undone but settles them back around his hips.  “I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable.”
Below him, Sherlock’s body seems to have given out as well because he drops his hips to the mattress, pulling John out of him in a sudden rush of cold air hitting his wet cock.  John looks down the length of their bodies and notices that Sherlock is lying directly on top of the rather large wet spot created by his own orgasm.  He is sure that another wet spot will be growing soon, if Sherlock doesn’t get up to clean himself off before come leaks out of his arse.
“And then there was another time,” John forged on, voice steely, intent to prove to the arrogant prick that he was right, “a bit before I left for my first deployment.  I had a friend whose deadbeat boyfriend had knocked her up and then split.  She was overdue and miserable.  She was 42 weeks along and her doctor told her to try some home remedies to induce labor.  One of them was sex,” he shrugged his shoulders dismissively, trying not to be uncomfortable telling Sherlock so much about such personal matters but not succeeding.  There was something about the unblinking stare of Sherlock’s clinical gaze that made John fidget.  It was almost like talking to one’s mum about their sex life.  Awkward and wrong.
“You love this, don’t you?” John asks him, and he can’t help the note of wonder in his own voice as he clings desperately to his boy, his thrusts never wavering.  “You love being fucked like this, having me talk to you like this?  You love being the absolute focus of my attention.”  John knows that is why Sherlock loves this little game that they play, why he is always so desperate for it.  He needs it as much as John does.  “Does it make you feel good?  Does it make you feel special?” John asks him, fucking into him, his mouth smearing the words across Sherlock’s lips.  Sherlock whimpers at John’s words and John knows, he
Sherlock simply rolls his eyes at the man immaturely.  “That’s because I like to let you pretend that
Sherlock, however, doesn’t seem to mind in the slightest.  “You’re safe, John,” Sherlock whispers to him gently, petting him.  “You’re here, with me.  It was just a dream.  That’s all.  Just a dream.  You’re fine.”
“Have you seen my keys?” he asks Sherlock as the boy continues watching him silently while John searches through Sherlock’s things.  “I thought they were in the pocket of my trousers, but they must have fallen out.”
Sherlock smiles shyly back at him, face smeared with wetness and shining in the dull light of their sitting room.
“There is something that you should know about your schedule, though,” he says to John, looking away from his friend sheepishly.
When the door closes, John feels like he can breathe again.  He exhales softly, aware that Mary is still
John tries not to blush as Sherlock deduces his sexual habits, but he doesn’t think he succeeds.  He knew that something like this was coming.  Sherlock has no compunctions and no sense of social or personal boundaries, after all.  He thinks about arguing with Sherlock but knows it would be more than pointless, so he just shrugs.  “Well, yeah,” he admits.  “Of course I do.  You’re beautiful, you know.”
It takes all of John’s willpower to remember why they shouldn’t be doing this, and he tries to fight Sherlock once more, although he doesn’t even bother to pull away from the teen this time.  He knows it’s more than futile.  “You’re not feeling right,” John points out and hopes to God that Sherlock will see reason.  “Your emotions are all muddled up and you’re scared.  I don’t want to take advantage of you.”  He’s not even worried about Mary overhearing them anymore.  That thought has long since fled his mind.
, that’s what Sherlock wants.  He wants all of that, and more still.  He wants to be debased, degraded.  He aches for it.  But since he can’t tell John this, he tries to voice his pleasure in a deep moan as he sucks John all the way to the back of his throat.
“Mary has made her own decisions,” John states plainly, calmly.  He can’t believe he is able to stay so reasonable about this whole conversation, but he is happy for it nonetheless.  The last thing he needs right now is to have his convictions crumble around him.  “I’m not saying that she deserves me cheating on her because she cheated on me first—I’m not saying that at all.  But I’ve
Sherlock looks at him confusedly for a moment and hesitates before finally giving in and shuffling over to crawl into John’s lap, curling up ridiculously against the shorter man.  Sherlock has continued to grow over the course of their relationship, and shows no signs of stopping any time soon, but they make no mention of it.  They fit themselves around one another as best they can, adjusting as needed every few weeks to compensate for Sherlock’s sudden added height.
“Yes,” John says quietly, reaching a tentative hand out to caress Sherlock’s cheek.  The brunet leans into his touch like a cat.  “Yes, of course, love.  I’ll take you back to bed gladly.  Nothing would make me happier.  But only if you
.”  He’ll do anything Sherlock tells him to do; he knows this.  No shame, no remorse, no regrets.  If Sherlock wants him to kneel arse-up on the floor and wait for Greg to come home to find him dirtied and debauched by another man, he knows he will do it.  He gave up the will to say no to Sherlock a long time ago.
This was the first time he had seen the infant since his quick, bleary glimpse of it in the O.R, when the nurse had whisked him off to the other side of the room to get cleaned and be taken care of.  He vaguely remembered that there had been a problem, the tiny infant had not been breathing, but Sherlock sat there for a long moment and listened to the reassuring, soft sounds of his baby inhaling and exhaling in tiny puffs of air, making small sounds of contentment in its sleep and pursing its lips again and again, as if dreaming of suckling.
He shifts Sherlock off of him with a little groan and settles the brunet next to him on the bed.  They lie against one another for a moment, and John lets himself enjoy the feel of Sherlock snuggling into his side and wrapping one thin arm around John’s chest, the other trapped beneath his own body.  Sherlock’s fingers automatically drag their way over John’s sternum, across his shirt.  Even though he is clothed, the vest is still thin and white, and Sherlock’s fingers roam over John’s pectoral and up to his shoulder, finding the edge of the gnarled scar and tracing it softly.  He doesn’t ask to see it again, doesn’t make any mention of what he is doing at all, actually, and so John lets him continue.  It is nice, after all, having someone touch him in such an intimate place.  So nice, in fact, that he finds himself being lulled into a slight drowse.  When the threat of sleep becomes too great, John decides that he should get up and clean off before heading out.  He tries to sit up but Sherlock’s hand is a sudden pressure on his chest, pushing him back down.
John will leave soon, because he knows that Sherlock will most likely be out until at least the morning.  But he’ll come back tomorrow morning, telling Mary he is going over to Mike’s so that he can help John start organising his next lesson plan.  If Sherlock’s dad hasn’t returned home during the middle of the night, John will stay and fix Sherlock a nice, hearty fry up for breakfast with a hot cup of tea.  He’ll make sure that Sherlock gets cleaned up and fed before being sure Sherlock gets caught up on all of his schoolwork and is rested and well enough to go back to school come Monday.  He doesn’t want to risk Sherlock getting in trouble for truancy, and he thinks Sherlock is probably pushing the limit now.
“Jesus fuck,” he mutters, gripping the base of his cock harder to try to stave off his impending orgasm.  There is too much that Sherlock still needs to do before John wants to come.
it.”  And suddenly there is a hand on John’s crotch, and when Sherlock squeezes him John is mortified to feel that he is completely hard, and he hates himself for how good Sherlock’s hand on him feels.
“Mycroft is taking me to see universities this weekend,” Sherlock says suddenly, breaking the silence between them.  His voice is soft and quiet and unsure.  He sounds young.  Young and hurt.  “He’s picking me up Thursday and he has several days of visits planned.”  He gives John a wry smile that holds no warmth and no mirth.  The gesture twists his beautiful lips into something ugly and unfamiliar.  “Now it’s my turn to tell you to fuck off and not to text me.”
at him but there is no anger in the sound.  “You’re almost done, love.  Just a few more bites,” he tells Sherlock, spearing another piece on the fork and holding it out.  Sherlock turns his head farther away to the side.
“Yeah,” Sherlock whimpers as he moves into position, shifting his weight to his legs as he kneels over John’s thighs.  The position brings his hole just above the head of John’s cock, rubbing across it.
With nothing left to throw any more, Sherlock stood in the middle of his living room, looking about him.  The mess in the kitchen had flowed over into parts of the living room through the doorway and he knew that he would get a stern talking to about the damage done to the wall—again—and he suddenly felt very drained.
There is a long moment where Sherlock doesn’t answer him, doesn’t say anything at all.  John turns back to look at the teen, finding him lying on his back and staring up at the ceiling as well, a look of utter contentment on his face.  “Thank you, John,” he whispers to the ceiling softly.  “This is exactly what I needed.”
“Now, the gun,” he said to the brunette man, his voice gone hard and serious.  “Sherlock—hand it over.”
“I have to admit that it is rather…nice and…comforting when you do certain things for me and make sure that I am adequately seen to in manners that don’t pertain to sex all of the time.”
deny the teen the chance to do so.  He knows that he can’t be the one to make this decision, though, and neither can Mycroft.  This is something that Sherlock has to decide on his own, or else he’ll only end up resenting everyone for making the choice for him.  John knows the genius well enough to understand that.
Sherlock looks down at him, completely wrecked.  “Tell me,” Sherlock says, and he sounds as if he is begging.  “Tell me how lovely you think I am.  Tell me how I drive you crazy.  Tell me you love me.  Please, John, tell me.”
before he turns away from him.  He takes Sherlock’s hand in his own, his knuckles bloody and bruised.  He makes his way through the crowd, intent on taking Sherlock somewhere far away, where they can be alone together.

,” he breathes out, his sea-foam green eyes flickering down to the ground for a second.  A faint pinkness tinges his cheeks.
Whether Sherlock knows he’s doing it or not, he still is not happy that the older man is trying to confine his touches to John’s stomach, sides and lower back.  Sherlock growls against John’s mouth as they kiss and rolls them over so that John is suddenly lying on his back, Sherlock hovering above him.  Sherlock’s weight is so slight that John knows he would be able to flip them again in an instant if he wanted.  It wouldn’t even be difficult.  But John rather likes the feeling of Sherlock on top of him, likes the way Sherlock’s slightly long, curly hair falls forward into his eyes when he looks down at John.
But Sherlock won’t be brushed off so easily.  “No,” he says, shaking his head as it rolls on John’s scarred shoulder.  “I’m not thanking you for giving me a soft toy.  I’m thanking you for giving me a part of yourself; for sharing this with me.  I know how uncomfortable this must have been for you.”  Sherlock lifts his head and looks down at him.  John watches as those quicksilver eyes practically shift colours right in front of him, a blue-green-grey that seems nameless.  “This isn’t just a soft toy.  This is a representation of how much you trust and love me.  I know how hard it’s been for you to come to terms with what you want.  Thank you for sharing this with me.”  He leans forward to press a close-mouthed kiss to John’s lips, chaste and demure after what they have just done with each other.
“Yes,” Sherlock hissed, throwing his head back, and John closed his eyes against the sight above him, afraid that it would send him over the edge. He didn’t want to finish so soon. He wanted to stay like this forever, inside of Sherlock’s tight heat, fucking him endlessly.
Christ, what has John done?  He has given the child a taste of what it feels like to be wanted desperately, uncontrollably, and of course Sherlock would want it again.  Sherlock has never been wanted by anyone before John, ever, and the man can only imagine what it is like to feel that for the first time, after years of being unloved, unnoticed.  “No,” John tells him gently, extricating Sherlock’s fingers from his jumper softly, holding the teen’s hands in his own as he talks.  “You don’t understand, Sherlock.  That’s not how relationships are supposed to be.  I don’t want to have to worry about hurting you with something that I’ve said or that I’ve done, especially when we are making love,” he explains patiently, because he knows that Sherlock doesn’t understand; Sherlock doesn’t
Warnings: The beginning of this chapter starts off with some really heavy dirty talk and some pretty descriptive comeplay, just to give you fair warning.  I don’t know what I was thinking…The start of this chapter is particularly dirty, apparently I have no shame, sorry.  We'll blame it on John's filthy mouth (which we all know I have no control over).
“God, that’s…” he moaned deeply as Sherlock took in more of him, struggling to keep his mouth open wide enough around John’s cock.  John could feel the tip of his prick running along the back of Sherlock’s throat, and he finally had to pull himself out of the beautiful warmth before he came in the man’s mouth.
“What?” John asks, standing and looking down at the teen below him, a small frown pulling at the edges of his face.  It is such a strange request coming from Sherlock that he is sure he must have heard wrong.
“What is?”  John tries not to think about how much the man standing before him reminds him of Sherlock.
“You’ve been like this all day, waiting for me to come home?” John asks him, already knowing the answer but needing to be sure.
But maybe, deep down, in the darkest part of John’s heart, that was because he didn’t really want to.
John simply glares right back at her, not fooled by her hurt for even a moment.  “Yeah, well, I could say the exact same thing to you,” he says to her coldly before he grabs up his car keys and leaves his house, sick of the sight of her.  He drives around until he finds a pub and spends the next few hours drowning his anger and hurt in whisky, wondering how he let his marriage—his
He hopes he can distract Sherlock with the compliment but the teen is relentless.  “And you also like talking to me and telling me what you want me to do.”  He gives John a long, contemplative look before declaring, “You have control issues,” as if he is talking about something that is no more interesting than the weather.
“You’re wondering why we are here now, the pro-Synaths, I bet, yeah?” he asked, taking a small sip of tea and a part of John cringed as the man’s grimy fingers clutched the delicate handle of his mother’s antique tea cup. “Well, just like everyone else, we only found out about you for sure today.”
John bites his lips together to keep them from trembling, to keep any sounds from falling out of his mouth.  He never once wanted Sherlock to feel like that, and John hates himself for making him think that way.  John had never wanted things to turn out like this; he had never wanted any of this to happen.
Sherlock knew it was going to be a good day when he decided to get dressed in regular clothes (and not stay in his pajamas for as long as he could) before he was even called about a case.
“Would you like to tell me about it, Sherlock?” Mycroft asked, sounding infuriatingly calm and reasonable.
Hearing Sherlock call him that sends a shiver of arousal spiking through John so sharp that his cock jumps in his lap and he thinks he may be in danger of coming right then and there.  Christ, he had no idea how good a simple word could make him feel.  Why had he fought Sherlock for so long about this?
He doesn’t know how to function without Sherlock anymore, and he has never felt more broken in his life than he does at this moment.  And he knows that he doesn’t want to feel like this this ever again, so he will do whatever he needs to make this feeling go away.
That draws John up short.  He is angry with Sherlock, yes, but he hadn’t meant for his words to come out that way; he hadn’t wanted Sherlock to take them to mean that loving him is more of a burden than anything else.  “Sherlock, I…” he begins, but he doesn’t know what to say, his anger melting away suddenly and leaving behind a sickening kind of guilt.  “You know why I love you,” he answers instead, evading the question.
“Twat,” Sherlock says, squirming out of John’s grasp and wiggling across the bed to a safe distance, out of John’s grasp.  “Just give me a minute.  Unlike you, I’m not pumped full of vasodilators.  I’m actually doing this the natural way.”
Sherlock makes a choked sound in the back of his throat and presses back against John’s finger.  John stretches him only a little bit before he is slipping a second into Sherlock, causing the boy to whimper and bite his lip as he tries to look over his shoulder at what John is doing to him.  When he is loose enough, John slips a third finger into him, pushing in deep and searching out his prostate, finding it easily in the position he has Sherlock in.
“Fuck,” Sherlock curses on a gasp.  He is squirming distractingly, pulling away from the new, strange sensation.  John doesn’t want to stop just yet, though.  He wants to taste more of Sherlock.  So he grips Sherlock’s hips hard and pulls the boy back towards him in a harsh movement.  His fingers bite into the soft skin of Sherlock’s hips in warning as he takes one of the brunet’s balls in his mouth, tonguing the crinkled skin and loving the way he can feel it harden and draw up.
“Fuck,” he says as his orgasm burns through him.  He continues to wank himself, rubbing the head of his cock along Sherlock’s cheek, across his mouth, and down his chin as he comes.  Sherlock’s tongue flicks out to lick up some of the mess and John rubs the underside of his cock against it, pulsing out the last drops on the warm, flat expanse of his tongue.
John stared at the man, uncomprehendingly.  “Sherlock, that’s insane,” was all that he managed to get out, past the sudden dryness in his throat.
Sherlock begs so nicely, John can’t possibly resist giving in.  John knows he spoils Sherlock already, but when John is his Daddy he seems to never be able to tell him no.
, John thought to himself as he slipped into the car and closed the door behind him.  There was no fighting it.
!” John shouts out, at his wits end.  He is tired of Sherlock taking liberties in their relationship and he is tired of Sherlock always getting his way.  Sherlock needs to know that John will not cater to his every whim and now seems like as good a time as any to show him.  “If we make commitments to other people, we generally try to keep them because it’s the polite, socially acceptable thing to do,” John explains to him, frustrated with Sherlock’s little temper tantrum.  “I can’t just throw a wobbly like you’re doing and say that I’m not going.  I’m a
Sherlock cuts him off then, speaking harshly and too loudly.  “If he has a problem with it, then he can take it up with me.”  And John knows by the dark tone of Sherlock’s voice that the topic is closed from discussion.
And then, as he turned the corner and stepped onto the road that Baker Street dead ended into, he could see it.  221b was still a few blocks down Baker Street, but the warm orange glow that glimmered against the black night sky and made his heart stop in his chest covered everything in a bright, moving light, and Sherlock couldn’t tell from this distance exactly which building it was coming off of.  He knew there was only one thing that could make such a large luminosity against all of the other light pollution of the city.  He had seen it once before, just once, years ago when a bomb had been planted in the building across from 221b Baker Street.
John pulls his fingers out slightly, leaving the very tips in before pressing back inside again, shoving in deep.  “God, you’re loose.  So wet.  It’s perfect.  You’re such a good boy, so ready and open for me.”
When, finally, in the third week, his ovulation strip showed him a positive reading, he recorded the data with a grin on his face.  He was finally able to move on to the next step of the experiment—the part he knew he would enjoy greatly.
If John thought it was slightly creepy to have a Bond-esque black sedan silently pull up outside of his house late in the evening to whisk him away to a secret meeting with a mysterious man, it is nothing compared to the disturbing locations that Mycroft Holmes insists they meet at.
As he played, he felt himself softly pulling apart, in this broken, beautiful mess that he had made.  And in the dead and quiet of the spaces between the music notes, he knew that he was slowly fading, deep into the masterpiece that he had made.
Sherlock’s grumbling grows louder at that but he still doesn’t emerge from his cocoon of warmth.  It doesn’t bother John, though; he knows Sherlock is awake now.  He can’t ever go back to sleep once he has woken up.  So John crawls reluctantly out of the warm bed and begins gathering up their clothes, padding quietly into the bathroom to wash up and put back together the first aid kit that had been torn apart in the rush to find lube last night.  He walks back into the bedroom and is halfway dressed when he looks over to the bed and sees that Sherlock still hasn’t even sat up yet, although he
