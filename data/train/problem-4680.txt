... taken.”
A beat of silence.
A section of the comforter becomes dislodged from wherever it was tucked and falls away. Absolutely unconcerned, Castiel only hikes his arm higher up over Dean’s shoulder, Dean wrapping himself impossibly tighter around him in the mother of all bear hugs. Sam does a double take at Cas’ bare side and blinks away, strangely embarrassed.
Sam stirs the car back onto the road, resolving to keep an eye out for gas stations and convenience stores on their way. “I’m still… not allowed to ask what happened, right?”
Dean shakes his head. “Nuh uh. It’s your life, Cas. What do
“I get it. We'll get him. We're on our way.”
“Son of a bitch.” Dean moves his arm so he can peer at the damage to his coat better. He flicks at a limp strip of fabric hanging from where it’s been torn at the shoulder. “Fucking rebar.”
Sam swallows. It does sounds like Castiel. Which is confirmed when he glances up at Dean and finds his brother with his eyes closed and lips pressed in a queasy line.
“You were right,” Cas comments, pulling Dean’s attention back. “I quite enjoyed the cookie crumbs.” He pushes back his empty milkshake glass with a content smile.
Castiel’s skin is pale and his toes bright red. Right.
In response, Cas steps closer, only to stop when Dean waves him off. “You should…” Dean gestures jerkily between Sam and Castiel. “... say hi first.”
Castiel’s hand cups under Dean’s forearm, ever so gentle. “I need you to know you are worthy of love, Dean Winchester. And I need you to live.” He punctuates his request by taking a half step forward, his hand applying a little more pressure. Grounding.
Dean shrugs. “Our stuff’s at the motel. We finish the job, go home. I guess?”
The piling on and not dealing has Dean so wired that he kicks out and nearly startles out of his skin when his phone starts ringing again. This time, they look before picking up the call.
As Sam trudges back to the car, he sees Dean decided to stretch his legs, too, after all. He watches Dean zip himself back up before stepping over some bushes. When their eyes meet, Sam shakes his phone. “Everything good on the home front,” he informs.
want?” He uses their joined hands to nudge his knuckles to Castiel thigh, and Sam’s eyes flick down, narrowing in suspicion. “D’you wanna keep hunting the baddies? Carry on with the Team Free Will lifestyle?” He quirks a smirk at Cas. “You wanna be Steve, again?”
“... huh?”
A fresh tear rolls down Castiel’s cheek. It carves Dean open, because he already knows the answer. “Because it is.” Castiel’s voice breaks when he speaks. Every time Dean thinks he can’t be undone further, something proves him wrong.
Dean and Castiel sit, leaning towards each other, shoulders mushed together, as Dean swipes through pictures on his phone. Cas watches intently, looking charmed. “Who’s this?” Sam does a double take. Did Castiel, gravely-voiced ageless being, just
Dean, eyes hard on something across the room from him, calls out to the phone. “Then, you’ll know. What's the last thing I said to you?”
Sam chuckles. “I’m sure you will.”
Sam takes a picture of the two of them. Dean happily munching on the end of a Twizzler, glowing as he takes in Cas, real, human, and alive, right there with them. He texts it to Rowena with a shrug emoji and ‘we have no idea’.
When they’re finishing scrubbing most of the grime away and stashing the weapons, Dean pauses halfway through closing the trunk of the Chevy. “Did you ever… uh. Hear me?” he asks. Castiel gives him a patented head tilt of confusion. “I guess I… prayed?” Dean clarifies. “After you, uh… when you were gone.”
Rowena said.
is asking.
“Dean. Please. Will you accept that? Will you try? For me?”
A little later, Castiel sighs contentedly, bunching up the sandwich wrapper. Dean, who’s hand had been resting over his freshly socked foot for warmth, squeezes gently. “Better?”
And, then...
like Cas, Sam thinks.
It had been ages since Dean’s smile had reached his eyes. Now, it just won’t go away.
“Yeah.” Sam sits up, squaring his shoulders. He may be tired, but Dean looks like this day has ruined him, on top of the exhaustion he’s been carrying around to begin with. Castiel is sporting dark shadows under his eyes and still shivers periodically. “I’ll let you know if I start flagging.” Which he won’t. Flag, that is. That’s one thing he can do for them, right now.
Cas grins back.
“‘Course we’re here,” Dean says gruffly. He pauses in his movement to look back at Castiel and licks his lips. “Hey, uh… Maybe there're some things
Dean preens. “That’s Miracle. He’s the goodest of all the good boys.” Sam would say he ‘glows’ as he speaks of the dog, but he’d probably get a vicious boot in the shin for it. “Eileen’s watching him at the moment. She’s at the bunker. Her and Donna are working some tech-y intel for a case. Above my pay grade.”
“Us too. I'll let you know when we have anything. Promise.” Sam sits in that for a while, absorbing the information. What the hell did that mean? He couldn’t make much sense of it. Eventually, he couldn’t help himself. “.... Dean?”
be goodbye. Not again.
“We’re not at the bunker. We’re on a job.” Sam cuts in. Dean shoots him a sharp look, but Sam shrugs, it isn’t like he said where they actually are.
Aware he’s been missing the large majority of the subtext since they got here, Sam tells himself he should get used to it again. Smiling privately, he goes to fetch the duffle from the trunk.
Sam was starting to drift off when he hears Cas speak again. “You kept your promise.” It’s quiet, clearly meant for Dean.
comes through.
Dean makes a sound, and wraps himself around Castiel further when the other man finally lays a tentative hand on his back. “Hi, Cas.” Dean’s hand cups the back of Castiel’s neck. “Welcome home.”
Dean rarely blushes as such. More often than not, only his ears actually pink up. It is more that, suddenly, his freckles stand out a fraction more, his eyes are a little wider. “I didn’t know if you’d still… and if you, like… wanted, uh… me.” He gestures at himself, awkward. “What you… How much you… uh…”
Dean wrinkles his nose, poking a finger inside the sleeve. “Did you know how many layers are in a coat? Is that insulation? What am I, a house?”
“What do you want, Dean?”
Sam watches Dean stiffen. He hasn’t spoken much about what happened, but Sam can’t imagine watching one more loved one die. Especially when, like Dean had said, they sacrifice themselves to save your life.
“Cas, I just…” Sam watches Dean, who appears as lost and torn as he feels. “You died.”
He doesn’t have to say it. If this is really Cas… which, Sam is seriously starting to get his hopes up as well… if this
Cas blinks. “Oh.” Sam isn’t sure what Dean’s talking about, but Cas certainly looks like he does.
He moves back easily when Dean opens the car door and climbs in. By the time Sam has hopped back into the driver seat, Dean has scrambled over the front seat to snatch their bag of shopping and spread it to display various candy bars and snacks between them on the bench seat. Castiel finishes taking long pulls from a water bottle and looks down at the offerings. “Oh.” His hand falls on a pack of Twizzlers. “I love these.”
Castiel just grins.
Sam stares at Dean, who’s suddenly sharply focused on the conversation. “That’s what it said?”
For three hundred and thirty five days.
“Y-... Uh. Yeah.” Dean sniffs. Sam looks from him to Castiel, finds the blue-eyed man also watching Dean expectantly. “This is something you’ve brought up before and uh… I’ve been thinking. I think maybe this is a good time.”
Castiel’s smile is touched and tentative.
But it’s Castiel being back. Castiel loving him and being
The holy water does nothing beyond wet Cas’ skin. Sam blinks when Castiel extends his hand, looking expectant and resigned at the same time. He decides that’s another sign that this is likely his friend, standing there, because he knows Sam well. He reaches for his inside pocket and pulls the silver knife he always carries out of his coat. Castiel maneuvers so that the bedding doesn’t fall off him, and takes a bracing breath before running his thumb along the sharp edge of the blade. He hisses. Sam can’t help the joyful chuckle he lets out when Castiel hands back the knife, sucking his thumb into his mouth with a disgruntled expression. “Please, don’t hit me with iron,” he asks, quietly.
“Vamp-mimes.”
Dean ducks his head, grinning despite his ears going pink. “Ah. There she is. That’s more like it.”
Still, they both step out of the car to meet Castiel halfway. Dean walks alongside Sam, but hangs back the last few steps. Castiel, brows drawn a little, looks pointedly at the flask in Sam’s hand. “Test me, please.” His fingers spider nervously on the edge of the comforter. “I would like to make sure as well.”
meaning. It certainly seems momentous to Dean. It’s fascinating to watch his expression, in this moment.
Sam is touched to see Castiel’s eyes soften at the mention of the women. “I look forward to seeing everyone again.”
“I love you.” A parting gift. One last twist of the knife.
He throws his arm over Cas’ shoulders as they head out. Now that he
“Yeah!” Sam nods. “We also have snacks in the car. And-...”
“Hello, Rowena,” Sam answers. “You’re on with both of us.”
“Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Rowena.”
The drive is tense. Sam keeps the traffic radio on low for some background noise. The rain peters out about an hour out of Canton, but Dean gets impossibly more anxious the closer they get. He’s silent and fidgety. And so preoccupied that he doesn’t snap at Sam’s frequent worried glances his way.
The memories.
for it. But Castiel speaks again, before he can. He offers words Dean didn’t expect to hear again. Ever. From anyone.
Sam glances over to find Dean, eyes a little wet, staring at him. Like he’s touched that Sam would be here, today. Like he just remembered how much Sam loves them both. Like he’s sorry he’s been unable to recover from the loss. Sam will get to Dean’s instinct to blame himself for everything, including his own pain, later. For now, he reaches over and squeezes Dean’s arm. “He’s family,” he says, firmly. Because that’s what Cas is.
Having to walk around even though you’re not living, anymore.
That barely gets Dean to twitch a tiny bit of a smile. “Good.”
need to accept, too, alright?”
Dean blinks, thrown by the throwback to earlier, during the case. “... recreationally,” he volleys back, amused and unconcerned. “I’ll find a way. You always find a way for throwing stars, Sammy, c’mon.”
Dean throws an amused smile his way. Then, as if it hits him all over again that Castiel is
Sam keeps his eyes on Dean, who’s letting out a shaky breath through his lips, slowly, eyes still closed, and jaw working.
“Hello, Sam,” Cas’ voice answers.
Castiel leans into his space, pressing their shoulders together reassuringly. “If this information is relevant to you, Dean,” he speaks quietly, mindful of their surroundings. “I seem to experience sexual attraction the same way a large majority of the human population does. And it appears very much aligned with my romantic inclination.” Dean stares back, wide-eyed, processing. Castiel’s pointed eyebrow makes his implications really hard to miss. After a beat of dopamine fueled stupor, Dean’s brain comes back online. He ducks his head with a huff of laughter and a grin he can’t contain. “Okay,” he says. “Okay.” He swallows and squeezes Castiel’s hand, perhaps to ground himself. “Good.” He throws Cas a sideways smile. “Dammit. I shouldn’t be feeling like a fumbly teenager.”
Sam eyes the damage. “Yep. That one’s done.” The entire sleeve has come off at the top, half of it torn and the other ripped at the seam.
When he pulls back, Sam finds Dean hovering close behind his shoulder. “”Why did you…?”
Dean watches Sam weave through the tables. His posture’s a little stiff. He’s going to have to poke and prod, later. He knows that 2x4 did more damage to his ribs that he’s let on. Sam looks tired, Dean thinks. He’s always thought of his Sammy as a baby-faced, Sasquatch-sized manboy. But lately, when Sam doesn’t know he’s watching. When Dean looks in the mirror. Maybe for the first time, Dean thinks they look their age. He feels his age, too.
That, and the memories.
The first times Dean experienced devastating loss, as an adult, he thought he wasn’t going to be able to take it. He wasn’t going to survive the pain, the howling emptiness. But he
Interesting. Maybe he’ll ask Rowena later. “Back to Canton?”
“Hello.”
Sam cleared his throat. “... so, um… The point?”
“Yeah,” Dean exhales, rough and shaky.
she says.
“I heard you, you know?” Castiel smiles at him, even through the tears and the regret that is plain on his face. “I always hear you.” His eyes flick between Dean’s, suddenly frantic, desperate. “You said... You said you can't do this without Sam and I.” Dean watches his shaky exhalation, numb. “But you're going to have to. Dean. For me.”
“I... refuse to answer that.”
“Maybe this, first, though.” Castiel picks up a deli sandwich. Sam vows to himself to get some better tasting food in him, soon. But this will have to do for now. Maybe a burger joint along the road if they pass one. It’s not like Dean will fight him.
It’s not that he won’t say. It’s that he
Castiel says, quiet, but firm.
Cas blinks, turning his half smile to Dean’s equally quizzical eyes. “Whatever you wish.”
But, he did promise. And time never stops for Dean. And Billie breaks in.
“For the whole… retirement thing.”
And Dean
“... How... Uh... ?”
Sam sits up, concerned. “Y’alright?”
“I want it to be
It’s 10am, they’ve been at this for hours. And there’s nothing to do because they’ve gotten exactly no further than they were yesterday.
Something swoops pleasantly in Dean’s chest when Castiel smiles at him like that. “I look forward to keep making shit up as we go, with you.”
“I’m very glad to see you, too.”
Mannish Boy cuts off abruptly when Dean’s phone starts to ring. Blinking himself out of his rigid reading posture, Dean presses the phone to his ear and kicks out the leg he had folded under himself. “Garth, thanks for calling me back, did you f-...” something happens to startle Dean into staring at his phone. In the next second, he is scrambling to his feet, white as a sheet, dropping the device to the floor with a clatter, eyes fixed on it like it may try to attack.
Dean can’t lose him. If Cas is gone… He knows he’ll want to die. He already wants to, now. If that’s all that’s left, it’s what they do. Go out together. Snuff it out, one last time.
“Yeah, it was a fun night.”
“Soon as we get these pies done I want you to go get your boyfriend.” She spoke while mashing potatoes.
*                             *                             *                             *
Dean shivered feeling Cas’ warm breathe in his ear. His lips felt so close. Dean carefully turned his head and made the mistake of looking directly in Cas’ eyes.
“Yeah Dean I’m in the kitchen. Mark does not like peas.”
“They do partake in a lot of shady business dealings.”
“I’m eating dinner and watching tv with Dad.”
“Um well I do enjoy a good book, I also go for runs.”
Not long after he was on the precipice of orgasm, Dean suddenly stopped. Pleads were on the tip of his tongue before he was instructed not to come until he said so. Sanity seemed so far away and he was beyond words at this point. Every nerve ending in his body screaming at him to disobey the order that was given so aggressively. He was pulled back hard until his face planted right into the inviting softness of a pillow that he didn’t know was there.
*		*		*		*
And with that he got into the passenger side and shut the door. Sagging into the comfortable, warm leather of the classic car was the most secure he’d felt all day. As Dean put the car in gear and drove off, Castiel watched Balthazar’s frozen form get smaller and darker in the rearview mirror until he was swallowed by the dark of night.
Dean started to gather his things into his messenger bag, planning to grade everything after that super cold shower. How in the hell had Cas never been on a date before? Honestly there should be heaps of people going after him. The guy was gorgeous. He took the opportunity to dive in for another kiss. It was longer and deeper than the other. Castiel parted his lips as an invitation for Dean to search his mouth with his tongue. He got lost in the taste of the other man. Dean’s hands found their place on his hips and pushed him into the desk that sat behind him. Without breaking contact Cas sat on the desk and opened his legs for Dean to slip in between. This wouldn’t be Dean’s first go around in this position, but it was definitely the hottest. Cas’ legs squeezed tight on Dean’s thighs and his hands sat on his waist, thumbs rubbing little circles on his shirt.
He stroked the man through his finish. Dropping the toy and cradling his shivering body in his arms. When he finished with his aftershocks, Castiel maneuvered him to lay down. In the adjoining bathroom he wet a rag with warm water, cleaning his own hand and wiping Dean down.
“Oh angel it’s beautiful.” He gasped.
“Cas.” He chuckled. “In all honesty I don’t deserve shit. I meant it when I said I never wanted to pressure you into anything that you didn’t want. Hell if this is something you wanna take to your grave then by all means I’ve got no say in that.”
“I’m gonna be spoiled rotten.”
“I’ve been well Sam how are you?”
“You can’t just barge in here and start barking orders!”
“I’m furious with you Gabriel. You’ve once again invaded my privacy and used it against me. I will be doing you no more favors of this nature ever again.”
“I just wanted to make sure. As I said I’ve never topped before.”
Right now they were sitting in the bookstore enjoying a coffee with Charlie during their slow times. They were discussing the new Steven King book and somehow the conversation found its way to talking about Dean.
His thoughts were all over at this point. Maybe Dean could bake a pie naked in his kitchen? That would be very nice? Maybe he could hand feed the pie to Dean once it’s cool? Have the man sit in his lap wiggling around while he does it.
“With the phone you almost left at the restaurant?” he laughed.
“Thank you for that. I feel terrible. I barely remember anything.”
“Maybe you need another one of those.” He motioned his head towards the empty coffee cup sitting on Castiel’s desk.
Dean awoke to the sleepy cat his boyfriend was. His arms and legs were wrapped tightly around his body like he was afraid Dean would disappear in the middle of the night. His morning wood was pressed tightly against his hip. His own was trapped under Cas’ strong runner’s thigh. As he tried to move out of the embrace said leg send a pang of arousal through him due to the friction. Any movement he made only made Cas hold him tighter and wasn’t helping his boner go down any time soon. He was rendered helpless. And honestly there wasn’t any other place on the planet he’d rather be. He laughed to himself at how sappy he’d become.
“Aren’t we supposed to be researching?”
“Hey Castiel?”
Sam: Didn’t you just finish finals? All you have to do is grade.
He changed the angle of his fingers and hit his prostate on the first try. The pie was long forgotten at this point so Castiel took the plate from his hand and set it on the couch beside him. Dean was lost in the pleasure he was offering him and he reveled in the beauty of it. His head was thrown back and his chest was glistening with the efforts he put into riding Castiel’s fingers. Just watching the other man seeking his own release brought him quite close to his own, but he was determined to do what Dean wanted. He wanted to follow his rules.
Cas withdrew himself from Dean’s hold and left the room. Dean couldn’t even bring himself to reassure his worrisome boyfriend that he was ok. Nothing in him was pushing him to lie for the sake of lying. He laid his head back and stared at the ceiling. The dark corners of Dean’s mind were growing again and he felt truly powerless against them.
“Yeah in like a 'holy hell he’s drop dead sexy' kind of intense. She’s more on the ‘please put this girl to sleep’ kind of intense at first, but once you get use to her you’ll be really happy she’s in your life.”
He was further along than he thought he’d be and that was evident in his voice. He felt like an empty box just itching to be filled to the brim with Dean. He wanted to chase the beauty that was Dean, whether it was off a cliff to his demise or to the moon. It didn’t matter in that moment, all that made sense to him was this.
“Dean—we can’t avoid him coming. Whether he’s invited or not you know he’ll show up.” Sam added.
Cas: Can’t you just give me an A? Since we’re dating? Jk
You: Do you like coffee? I know a great place we can sit and talk
“I’ve been home all day and haven’t seen you once.” He chuckled grabbing the remote and putting the program he was watching on mute.
“Do you have anything in that massive kitchen? I can whip up some of my famous omlettes.” Dean flashed his award winning smile.
“Now as punishment you have to share all the details of the last week and a half.”
Kevin’s head was swirling with too much information. Castiel was dating a professor, and this professor apparently had enough skill and backup to be willing to take on Dick Roman. Though Kevin had a million questions swimming around in his brain he leapt into action. He could do what he was told, he was good at that, and this was him helping.
“What color are they?” Cas asked trying to picture Dean with his legs open and spread across the couch laying with his head on the arm rest, his usual position while watching tv.
“I want you to do a bit more for the front end as my reading schedule has gotten a little more hectic.”
“It’s alright. I enjoyed the walk and the temperature is fine.”
He didn’t know what to reply to that so he didn’t. Dean just called him sexy. What did he do with that? Of course he could return the sentiment, but he didn’t have the way with words like Dean did. He just said how he felt in the plainest way possible.
“I must know which it is before I can just hand over the text.”
“There’s still work to be done. I don’t just take the pictures. I have to edit them too.”
“Where are we going Dean?”
“I woke up when I felt you moving. Just didn’t say anything cause I thought you’d go back to sleep.”
8888888888
“I’m sorry.” He rushed “Did I interrupt your morning?”
“So what do you say?”
“Sam. What you doing up so late?”
“How do you like it? Dean’s teaching I mean.” His smile grew.
Its funny how once a plan is agreed upon ten million things get in the way. Dean had made them a lovely lunch of deli sandwiches and fruit bowls. They talked about Castiel’s upcoming trip to the coast of Madagascar. Dean was more concerned about how he’d be gone for a week, which was quite sweet. He’d told the man how a week was much shorter then his regular long-term jobs and Dean grumbled away about Castiel abandoning him.
They got in the sedan and began their ride over to Missouri’s shop. Sam didn’t say anything the whole way, so Castiel stayed silent as well. As they pulled up to the shop’s front Sam decides to say something.
Ken said nothing, he just bent over and pretended to be tinkering with the air unit. Castiel let the camera fall to Dean’s face, capturing the hooded eyes and lustful slow blinks at the plump ass bent in front of him.
That morning in the shower it had been his fuel to rid himself of his morning wood. He imagined Cas in front of him with his eyes trained on his leaking dick. He stroked hard and fast. His hand flying over his shaft at an alarming rate. He imagined those blue eyes staring at him, lust written all over his face. He threw his head back and braced himself with a free hand on the tiled wall in front of him. He could feel the heat bubbling in his gut, his orgasm was near. He then imagined being held by Cas and his lips gracing over his, he was now over the edge grunting and moaning through his orgasm.
They were completely ignoring the red head at the moment, Dean watched delighted as Cas made his way over to him. Only standing about a foot away. Normally he’d be upset and give his usual lecture about personal space, but right now he didn’t mind the closeness.
“Well I hope our traditions can blend together, if it’s ok that we celebrate even though you aren’t getting married.”
“I’ll make it up to you after work if you’re still free.” He winked.
He took a stool at the bar and settled on it, getting taken care of by a friendly blonde young woman that reminded him of Mary. Was everyone in this town friendly? It threw him off kilter to be on the receiving sound of so much politeness. Normally he never ventured into smaller towns like this. In a big city he was just another face in the crowd. People didn’t ask questions. Lawrence, however, surpassed any small town stereotypes he’d seen in movies and tv. Of course he hadn’t been here that long and issues could always arise, but so far he was enjoying himself. It would make it so much harder to leave.
He followed Dean’s instructions even though he wanted to chase his orgasm right off a cliff.
“Yeah I know but—“
“Did you like it?”
“Are you gonna at least edit it?”
“It hurt but it went well.”
Hey hey! Here's another addition to this. I've been struggling with a nasty cold so I'm trying my best to write as much as I can. As far from over as this story is I've also been writing another Destiel fic. When an idea hits I can't resist them. It'll bother me until I write it down. No warnings for this chapter. It's pretty fluffy, but the next chapter.......I'll apologize in advance for that. As always thank you so much for reading and commenting. It brings me joy!
“What’s his last name? His face looked so familiar.”
He thought to himself.
“Well that makes inviting him to dinner a little easier.” She replied, turning her eyes to him.
“It certainly is.” He gave Castiel a plain in sight once over before hopping off of the stool. “See ya round Cas.” He waved and sauntered off.
While Castiel enjoyed the library a great deal, he didn’t like that he had to return the books. He was a fast reader, but he liked to take his time while diving into a good story. This particular library had such a short and stringent return policy. Though he didn’t have many he’d made sure that the books he really fell for remained in his small collection. With a bookstore so close by he’d need a bookshelf. A bookshelf for his apartment. The chance at giving into to the hope and optimism that kept burrowing itself inside him, was as tempting as ever. He wanted to believe the spirit that visited him. Even though its appearance was quite startling he felt no malice from the being. The question at this point was should he put stock in what it said. If it was true, he wouldn’t mind settling in Lawrence.
“Well—Missouri made an observation, and I didn’t want to assume.”
“Dean I’m sorry to wake you but I need you to come get me.”
Dean moved behind the younger man as he worked, bumping his groin against the other’s ass.
“But I’m hungry.” He whined.
“Castiel knows you so that’s good enough for me. Any prof who’s brave enough to smoke on campus has to be an awesome person.”
“What the hell was all that about?”
They walked inside and were greeted by a host at the booth that sat in the middle of the entrance.
“You’ll regret this Charles.” He threw over his shoulder as he exited the door and slammed it behind him.
*             *             *             *             *
He let go a long sigh and rolled his eyes while getting off of the couch. He was just getting to the halfway point of his second bottle and didn’t want to be interrupted. He slowly walked to the door, swaying a little from getting up too fast. He opened it expecting Sam to come barreling in yelling and waving his arms around telling Dean that he was better than this, but when a pair of arms wrapped around his middle and a face burrowed into his neck he realized this person definitely wasn’t Sam. The figure stepped back and he was met with a pair of eternal blue eyes.
“That’s a little dramatic don’t you think?”
Castiel was in the middle of feeding little Mark his lunch when he heard a few choice words sound over the news station that was playing on Sam’s new TV. He watched the blonde woman in her bright green dress announce that the trial had concluded. After all these months of waiting Dick Roman and his father would be put behind bars. They didn’t give further details as to how long their sentence was or what prison they would be in, Castiel could learn that from his lawyer if he wanted to know that badly. The truth was that he sincerely didn’t. It was enough to know that the pair would no longer be able to cast their dark cloud over anyone for a very long time and that alone satisfied him. His attention was swayed when he felt a mushy carrot being thrown at his face. As soon as he turned to Mark the child burst out into a fit of giggles. What was so hilarious about throwing food at someone was a mystery to Castiel.
“Bitch.” Dean says under his breath and then finally leans back, yawning as he stretches.
Castiel can’t help but smile, or did he never stop in the first place? The warmth around his heart squeezes tight and he exhales, letting it spread all over his body.
When they sit down on the sand, Eileen in Sam’s embrace and Dean in Cas’, they watch the sunset together.
Castiel opens his mouth to snap back but Dean changes gears.
Castiel likes to think that Dean knows how to make people care about him.
Castiel straightens up while Dean picks on the wings in front of him, taking and dipping a piece in the sauce next to it.
It tickles a little, like a bug scattering across his skin, and Dean almost giggles.
“I’m a millions of years old celestial.” Castiel says to this, like that would be explanatory enough as to why Sam can’t possibly ground him. Other than him being a grown man, sort of. His vessel is.
“Don’t keep those,” she says, her smile almost predatory. Dean swallows.
Cas feels his heart thump in his vessel, it’s going faster than when they were chasing Procrustes not even two hours ago.
“Sam,” Castiel interrupts, “Have you got a wooden stake and lambs blood?”
It used to be hard, Cas knows.
“I’m Procrustes. Damastes. A smith from Attica,” she laughs at the irony as she gestures to the motel surrounding her “This is what I
„I do,“ Dean says and then realizes he’s not being completely honest there. Jack is staring at him, like he’s not sure that he understands, so Dean takes the long road. „I mean, I do.“ He confirms, „But sometimes, it’s nice to think you could do other stuff, right? Like, I don’t know. Be a DJ.“
“Sam?” Dean shouts into the phone and steps closer. “Sam!?”
Castiel looks about done with everyone, but Jack is staring at them in confusion.
They don’t see Sam behind the door, leaning onto the doorframe and shaking his head at them, with a fond smile on his face.
“My day,” he breathes out and Cas hears the wonder in it. It makes his heart ache. That Dean can’t believe this is his day, makes him sad beyond belief.
“Awesome,” he gets in response, Dean throwing him one of his bright smiles and Castiel feels like he’s made the right choice.
Dean’s hand is a bit stretched, so he can reach Castiel and Cas steps a little closer to the edge of the bed, letting Dean’s hand wrap around his own.
Dean looks up towards him and instantly regrets it - Castiel’s blue eyes are fixed on him with worry in them and Dean feels like shit, again. No way is it necessary for Cas to worry so much about him.
“You’re right, there seems to be no pattern…”
“That if I asked you to try and get back up that cliff together and stay with me through all of it, that you’d say no to that.” He’s long past the metaphors, he doesn’t even know if they’re making sense but Dean seems to understand.
“What are you- Dean, why the hell am I on a globe.”
Castiel laughs again, when Dean scowls, but the small smirk on his face is so evident.
“I don’t get it,” Dean whispers, as they climb the steps, “If she’s the one killing them all, how come she had an alibi?”
“Oh, for the love of-” Sam starts and waves a hand between them, “don’t start this again or I’ll ground you both.”
After a week, when Castiel and Dean are in the Dean-Cave and trying to decide what to watch for movie night and Castiel suggests Harry Potter, Dean groans, hitting his own forehead.
His mind tells him to pull away, because what’s happening can’t possibly be right, but he stays put. He’s nailed in place by Cas’ blue eyes boring into his and his finger on his jaw and his hand, now slightly touching his glass-free hand.
Castiel turns the menu to single meals, not combos. Since Dean already plans to order one, he can’t possibly consume another one.
“Would you have wanted to? Would you have liked it if we didn’t stop?” Castiel asks and even though he already made the tensions fall a bit, now they’re back on for Dean.
“Come on,” he says and moves Cas’ hand to his back, gripping the other one tight and starts to move his legs.
The grace flows into the vial, the substance calm once it’s confounded into the glass walls.
Castiel gives a small sigh and finally, he reaches out. If Dean wants to step away, he has the perfect right and opportunity. Right now, Castiel just wants to touch some part of him when he says what he fears the most.
His own is still in his trench coat.
Castiel watches as Dean leans back on the chair, hands going to his face, rubbing it. He looks exhausted and it’s not even 9 p.m.
But Castiel has contemplated this for as long as he can remember first starting to love Dean, he’s weighed everything carefully - would it be so bad not to talk about it, instead getting to keep Dean close? What does it matter if he can’t hold him the way he wants, or gets to tell him the things he can’t, if he can be close to him, keep him safe and alive.
Dean blinks at Cas, feeling his ears go read but then laughs, “I definitely didn’t teach you that.”
Dean spares Sam another glance and his giant of a brother is schooling his face into one of worry, not one of ‘
“Seems I have a thing for older men then.” the hunter winks.
He has them quite a lot, Castiel knows, even though he’s only witnessed a few. He does what he always does when this happens.
“What are you doing?” he comes up, looking at Dean behind the map room’s table, Castiel in front of him with a burning candle on the side.
“Can I see you?” Dean asks and he seems to struggle with words again, knowing he should elaborate, but Cas understands.
He and Sam usually go to sleep around midnight or early morning, after they’ve hit the lore.
Sam makes a face and Castiel grabs Dean unceremoniously.
Dean grabs his arm back, his face now slightly covered in a layer of anger. Dean’s always so angry.
Dean’s watching Castiel from the where he stands, the angel’s side-profile a little hunched in the uncomfortable chair, hair sticking everywhere and the little frown on his face. And out of nowhere, goes with, “I see them dying.”
“Yeah?” the hunter asks and sees Jack staring at him, almost vibrating with contained glee. Oh boy.
Once they are back in the living room, thankfully Jack’s idea of a mattress-race keeps him from thinking too much about Cas and whatever it is he’s planning on doing with him later tonight.
“I just want you to tell me, that if we take a step closer to the edge and if we do fall off, that you won’t be able to say the things I want to say. That you won’t be able to soften the blow.” Castiel goes on and even as he speaks, his throat feels painful and he needs to swallow. He doesn’t want to go on but he has to.
Dean’s caught off guard and he stares at Cas. He’s so lost and Castiel can’t help him find his way - not if Dean doesn’t want it.
They go in like they always do, Cas going first because evidently, he’s an angel and not much can hurt him.
It’s absolutely not adorable.
But Dean shows no signs of discomfort when his hand goes up, almost as if he wants to touch the flooding light, but then lowers it.
Even if Dean did fight against it at first, even he had to admit that it was only tactically logical and so now Castiel steps into the motel, a stake covered in dripping lambs blood in hand and peers around the corner.
There are tons of pictures, though, around the living room. Behind the couch Sam and Ayesha are sitting on, are pictures with who Cas guesses are friends and family, even a small Pomeranian dog.
It’s a small smile, reserved and maybe even shy, but Dean gives him the same one back, before he clink their bottles together. “To being impossible.”
He is not even slightly surprised that it was there. He can thank Jack for that, he supposes.
Cas remembers reading that famous poem about sand and images of innocence, corrupted by evil and demise. But to see something grand in the smallest of schemes was always Cas’ talent, or so he would like to think.
Sam stares at the burger, the one that had done nothing to no one but still ended up falling onto the sidewalk, just after it had rained, and was now sitting in the trash can. He seems to feel some guilt, at least.
„I can help you sort the vinyls!“ Jack says, super-duper excited and Dean wants to roll his eyes.
“I don’t know what you want from me,” Dean says then, quiet and it even sounds like a lie. Because they both know it is.
„That’s not so different from hunting, is it?“ he asks and Jack stares at him in confusion.
There’s that doubtful tone in Dean’s voice as he examines Castiel, eyebrows furrowing in disbelief and Cas’ hands go to his own hips.
“I’ll just dry it with my-”
Jack almost gets electrocuted when he goes towards the mess of electrical wires behind the big-ass TV with a damp rug, but Dean jumps and almost tackles him before he can make it.
He thought everything needed to be bought, but turns out there are places where you can rent something and then bring it back. Like a library for DVD’s.
„I could just use my grace to get rid of the excess dust and grime.“ Castiel offers, sitting with a straight back on one of the chairs behind the table. His face is sincere and maybe there’s even a small smidge of enthusiasm, that he could help out with something.
This isn’t the first time he can feel all the humanly aspects of being in a vessel, isn’t the first time they overwhelm him when Dean stands close enough to make out the tiny flickers of his eyelashes, long and curling, shielding the open-hearted look he is giving Castiel now.
Dean rolls his eyes and Castiel grits his teeth. He wants to close his eyes but he feels the familiar pain in his chest and he doesn’t think he can do it anymore.
“Hey, Cas.” Dean says, straight-faced. “Did it hurt?”
’ button, “They’re very, different. From what you usually listen and from each other too. Many genres and-”
“Dean, it’s just a burger.”
Sam is talking about the ride home and how he can’t wait to just go for a run and Dean announces his absolute disgust for that and Castiel smiles.
“I’m allowed to be. I’m human, remember?”
“I expect you to be loud, so we should probably wait until everyone else is asleep.” Castiel tells him, like it’s not a big deal.
He taps at Dean's chest wistfully, raising one eyebrow.
When Castiel’s fingers go to Dean’s forehead, a gesture the man knows oh-so-well, he flinches, but not of fear.
Dean rolls his eyes and plays innocent. “So what if I had?”
“That’s alright. We’ll just have to dig deeper. Is there anything we haven’t checked yet? Cross-references? Any entities that we haven’t considered?” Sam asks, playing chipper and Dean grinds his teeth.
The hunter glares at him and then grabs the thing, holding it up. “This is what you chose?” his voice is demanding and slightly disbelieving.
„I envy it.“ Dean corrects and Castiel blinks.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean lets out as the searing pain reaches his foot and he immediately grabs his toes and awkwardly hops on one foot, while Castiel makes a concerned noise and comes closer.
„Charlie would never.“ Dean refuses to believe.
This time, Dean lets out an audible ‘fuck’ and accidentally bucks his hips forward.
„Right again!“ Jack says in awe „That’s amazing!“
“I’m not leaving, until we talk. About all the things you don’t want to talk about. Because this isn’t just about you, it’s about me and I’m being selfish right now. I’m allowed to be selfish.”
So they haul one of the armchairs from the main room to the 'Dean-Cave' that night, Sam pointing at the posters of AC/DC and Zeppelin on the walls, commenting on how this looks more like a bachelor’s den with the beer and the TV.
Dean is beautiful, but not the kind of beautiful that hurts to look at.
“Regan Damas.” she says and flashes him a smile.
“Suit yourself. Take care now, agent.”
“I don’t- I don’t know.” Dean says and Castiel can hear it in his voice - that he knows, but doesn’t want to say it.
Dean ignores the weird swell in his chest and clears his throat.
Dean thinks about the food Castiel ordered and declared that it was for Dean. Not for Sam, but for Dean. His heart, the bastard, betrays him again and does a little flip at the memory.
If Dean didn't know any better, he'd think he was seeing things.
“I can see the bone, Dean.”
Cleaning and mattress-surfing is exhausting.
“I think it’s delicious,” Castiel ventures a guess, he wouldn’t really know, and gets a betrayed stare from Dean and a joyous huff from Sam.
“Dun-dun-dun-another one bites the dust…” he sings without realizing it.
He smiles and says, “Close your eyes, Dean.”
“Oh? Pray tell, agent,” she drawles out, moving closer and Dean can almost feel her breath on his face, “What horrible things have you heard then?”
“What, like whatever this is only kills drug addicts?”
“Down here,” Castiel grumbles and Dean kneels to help the angel out from under the jacket of a vampire.
He scrapes the floor with the chair accidentally, but other than Sam’s small mumble, the Winchesters are unbothered by the sound.
Castiel has come to understand that Dean appreciates the fact that he doesn’t have to live with the guilt of ordering ‘too much’ food for himself, making Sam mock him for eating too much and getting flabby.
The hunter gives a triumphant “
But when Dean’s eyes open, glinting with hope and a sense of calm, Castiel raises his fingers to his temple, the grace flowing and pulling at them both, destination clear in Cas’ mind.
“Not quite,” Castiel rolls over and grabs the other stake, getting up and stabbing her through the heart from the front.
“Dean, please.” Cas whines, and oh yeah, he really doesn’t want to do the dishes.
Cas smiles towards the sleepy Jack and then to Dean.
He smiles because he’s surrounded by family and Dean’s hand on top of his is warm and he can enjoy that.
Jack almost falls onto the floor as he bursts into fits of laughter and Dean stares at him, happy.
Dean Winchester is heavenly.
His voice is hoarse and swallowed by the downpour and wind immediately, but he blinks rapidly, not taking his gaze off the figure that's staying still.
Cas can't possibly hear it, but feeling it thump beneath his fingers, he knows.
Dean’s looking at him with a very guarded look and it makes Cas lean in more.
“Hmmm,” Cas hums, chewing and then says, “I like sharing.”
Dean’s hands flow up in surrender, but he's trying so hard not to laugh, it hurts. “I wasn’t going to!” he replies, laughter bubbling up and he poorly masks it with a cough.
Dean doesn’t respond, just stares at Cas, while they float in the sea. The former angel tilts his head in question, but before he can ask what’s wrong, Dean quietly says, “C’mere.”
Dean’s hand lingers on the Impala’s door, like he wants to say something. His mouth is even open, but then he nods awkwardly and gets in.
Over the blaring of “
It’s none of those multi-layered, subtextual words that Dean comments on, none of those. No, he leans back a bit, so he can look at the angel and his face is nothing short of amusement as he mouths along to:
He rose from his chair and decided to get himself another cup of coffee. He glanced out the kitchen window to see the sky painted in deep purples and blues as the sun was setting. October was ending soon and November was rolling it’s way in and the days were getting shorter. He sighed and listened to the sputters and spews his coffee maker made. He was so tired. The whirl of the day took a heavy toll on him. His eyelids drooping by the second. If he stood here any longer he’d fall asleep right where he stood.
“Lift up.”
“I think you two need to talk.”
“Sure why not? They don’t bite.” He brought his face towards Castiel’s neck. “I do though.”
“That’s cool. Did you like growing up there? Kansas is all I know, really.” He chuckled.
“Do you want to share?” he asked carefully and gently as Dean crawled back into bed.
“You will change your tone and speak to me with respect.” His voice boomed. “I didn’t raise you to talk to me like that.”
“I do like someone, but I’m pretty sure they only like girls.”
“Any one in particular?”
“Meat lovers with a side of garlic knots?”
“I couldn’t agree more.”
“Cas kiss me.” He struggled to get out.
He took a seat next to Charlie and his father took the seat directly across from him next to Sam. He had stopped his conversation with Gabe and turned to his father, the two of them whispering under their breaths. It went on for a while as Ellen laid the cooked dishes on the table, never increasing in volume, but he could hear them practically hissing at each other clearly arguing with one another.
“Never thought I’d see the day. Good luck.”
Dean and Sam were in the kitchen washing the dishes, so he was left in the living room with their parents. For the most part it was fine, Mary and John talked amongst themselves, he didn’t want to listen in and be rude.
“You haven’t answered my question Dean.”
“So you and Dean huh?” he asked loading his things onto the conveyer belt.
“No actually we’d do it here. Just you and me.”
“I said how do you feel? You look amazing, pretty hole all glistening just for me.”
“I went to go see Dad. And I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but he was actually sober.”
With a nod he went to the counter and order Dean’s beverage. His chest puffed up with pride at making a good decision on the pie. He tried his hardest not to laser focus on what Dean had said in response to his little ramble session. Now was not the time for that. He grabbed his order and returned to the table to find the man had finished his pie and looked quite proud about it.
“I’ll send you the file tonight.” He muttered to his brother as he fled.
*		*		*		*
All of that hit Dean like a freshly lit bomb. Cas was right. Dean wasn’t looking at any of this fairly. He was treating him like he was his past and that wasn’t healthy nor ok. He obviously wasn’t planning to leave, he was fighting to stay. This was all new for Dean, something he wanted didn’t slip through his fingers at the first sight of conflict. It was strange that although they were technically in a fight he was very happy with it. He put a hand to Castiel’s cheek and felt a smile tugging at his lips.
“We need it for a map that it contains.”
“Well you know he was teasing. He doesn’t mean anything by it.”
“Um—alright.”
“You sure? I’m in the car now.”
“Please tell me you’ll do the shoot Cas. It’ll be so hot.”
“Gabriel told me he called about the shoot.”
Well he’d rather not think about that.
“Please, just call me Chuck. No need to be formal with me.”
They’d just finished plating everything up and sitting across from one another at the table when he decided to start the conversation.
“Yeah that’d be best.”
“So you’re not here to support me. You’re here to support your pockets?” he began packing the clothes into the garment bags with annoyance. “Then you can just leave and I’ll wear something Balthazar suggests.”
The waiter returned with more water and Dean’s beer. They barely gave her a glance but still thanked her as she took their meal orders and fled the table.
“Hi how can I help you?”
There’s something to be said about Dean being in his apartment. The union blessing/housewarming went much better than he anticipated. He didn’t realize so many people wanted to celebrate him getting his own space. They were essentially celebrating the fact that he was going to stay in Lawrence. It felt ore like an initiation into their family than anything else. Castiel now had more food than he knew what to do with. That’s how he found himself here, watching Dean once again moving around his kitchen like there was nowhere else in the world he’d rather be. Packing some of the foods people brought into Tupperware that would be stored in the freezer for later and others that would be used as lunches for work and dinner. Since they started the furnishing of this place Castiel had enjoyed Dean being her more and more each time. He enjoyed it so much so that though the party was over, he didn’t want the other man to leave. He hadn’t even realized Dean was finished until he started talking.
“How’d you like it?” he asked as they were leaving.
“I guess I’m quite affectionate in my sleep. I’m not use to sleeping next to someone. I apologize.” He started to pull away but Dean reached down and grabbed Cas’ leg and pulled it along with Cas’ whole body until he was lying on top of him.
That giggle told Dean everything he needed to know. Was he turned on by Cas’ affection? Hell yeah, but he wasn’t gonna take advantage of a drunk person. Whether they were together or not. He helped Cas out of his pants and coaxed him into the bed then went to the kitchen. He filled up a glass of water from the tap and paused to calm down his aroused state of mind before returning to the room. When he opened the door he found Cas sprawled out on his bed knocked out. He sat the glass of water on the night stand on Cas’ side of the bed and found a packet of aspirin to place next to the glass should Cas wake up before him. He smiled at the trail of drool that was falling out of Cas’ mouth and making its way towards his pillow. Despite drool being disgusting somehow because it was Cas it was adorable.
“Wow that’s—wow I had no idea.”
“Well if you ever need some reasons to stay I could show you around.”
“That’s quite an understatement. I didn’t appreciate Balthazar encouraging such conversation.”
“The drawer left of the sink.” He managed to get out.
“Time…I feel like I finally have a grasp on that.”
“It really was no trouble Mr. Novak.”
Dean merely winked at Cas as he hollowed out his cheeks putting so much pressure on his shaft and he watched in awe as Cas’ orgasm came crashing through him. He screamed Dean’s name and some other obscenities as his body trembled. It was profound how Dean had reduced such a strong and straightforward individual into a shivering mess. His checks were flushed and his head tossed back half buried in the pillows. Dean pulled off and slid up Cas’ body to watch the beautiful state he was in.
“Good cause I don’t want to.” He scooped up the last of the dessert. “You ready to get on out of here?”
“John!” Mary slapped his arm and hissed. “She didn’t tell him yet!”
“See that’s where you’re wrong. I like both. Depends on the partner, but why is this funny?”
Once the door was closed Dean braced his hands on Castiel’s hips and pulled him flush to his body. He bent his head slightly and placed a chaste kiss to his ever chapped yet soft lips. He intended to keep it light and innocent, but when Cas twisted his head to the side and poked his tongue out, begging for entry he’d let him in. Who was he to deny Cas what he wanted? His hands trailed a little higher until his fingertips were just above the hem of his t shirt. He just needed to feel the other man’s skin right now. They couldn’t do much else with the Dad and brother in the house, but Dean would take what he could get for right now. He trailed his mouth across the shark jawline of Cas’ face to leave rough, open-mouthed kisses right along his collar bone. Moving his hips forward he could feel Cas’ growing erection. He loved how responsive Cas was at even the slightest touch, like Dean was the only one he would ever want. Truth was he was hoping that would be true for the both of them. He meant the words that left his mouth that night when he said he loved them. Saying them made it real, and where Dean would usually freak out after admitting his feelings, he actually felt relief. Relieved for the fact that he’d said it as well as glad that Cas hadn’t heard him. Dean was never one to fall in love, let alone say it first, and that was something he wanted to keep hold to. He had no idea where Cas’ heart was in that matter, and to say it to him and not receive it back would do more damage than he could handle right now. So as he licked his way up Cas’ throat the words throbbed in his head, and he would keep them there until Cas either said it first, or something caused them to explode out his mouth.
“Hey Cas. What you doin’ here?” he tried to keep his voice as normal and even as his intoxicated state would allow him.
“If you haven’t noticed I’m well aware of that. Would you happen to have Dean Winchester’s email address?”
“I had a feeling that you pulled some strings to get us in that shoot together.”
“Hmm.” Dean grunted and gotten back to work.
“Whatever you want sweet heart.”
“Either way,” he spoke as he packed up all of his things, “Would you mind dropping me off at Dean’s building. We had dinner plans for tonight.”
*		*		*		*
“I don’t like seeing people get hurt. Why were they beating on you?” Dean walked ahead a little fully intending on escorting the boy to the nurse’s office.
He was quite hesitant to answer….this was an unknown man asking him to hangout. To be honest it wasn’t much different than his first few interactions with Dean. That seemed to work in his favor, and on that thought he decided to ride the wave of luck he’d received and see where his efforts take him.
“Do you mind if we go back to your place?” Castiel visibly shrank in his seat.
Castiel was confused and deep in thought for the remainder of his shift. Had Dean taken him on a date, and he didn’t even know it? He’d never been on a date before. There wasn’t any room in his hectic existence for such frivolous activities. Hardly knowing how dating went outside of movies and shows he’d watched over the years, he decided to talk to Dean about it. Dates usually ended with kisses of sex, some sort of physical interaction that differentiated a date from two friends simply having dinner together. They did, however, talk about a lot of things that you would on a first date. They discussed family, funny things they’ve done over the years, weird things they’ve done in the past. Dean talked about his ex and how things went badly, Castiel has never had an ex so he couldn’t offer much on that topic. Yet these all could be things that you would discuss when getting to know a friend.
Dean stepped aside without a word. John went to speak when he noticed Castiel was in the room. They looked each other up and down. Cas could see the harsh lines of anger began to worm their way on John’s face. Cas didn’t back down. He kept his meanest gaze on the older man. When he looked at Dean’s face though his mask cracked just a little. He looked like a starved, terrified animal in a cage, waiting for Castiel to save him. His heart was wounded for Dean, but he’d be damned before he didn’t protect him.
Once dressed he texted his boyfriend letting him know he was coming over and anxiety was in full war mode within him. He pulled the Impala to the front of the house and elected to actually go to the door.
“Alright well this isn’t a jeans and t-shirt kind of place so dress how you would for school.”
The shoot itself wasn’t until the following week, so Gabriel told him he had time to decide. He’d actually said ‘discuss it with your boy’, but he’s already decided he wasn’t doing that. if all else fails he could say no and Bal could step in. if not…
Castiel was nervous, he’d wanted to tell Dean that he didn’t want to attend this event but he’d opted to tell him he’d think about it. He had until the weekend to decide so he wanted to think about before hand. The last thing wither of them needed was for him to be a jealous nightmare again and he was unsure what to expect from events like this. The man ensured him that this was a dinner and mingle type of situation, but his idea of mingling was awkward dinner with his relatives.
*                             *                             *                             *
He followed him to the door and swung it open for him. Just as he was about to walk out, he turned with a blaze in his eyes that was similar to the one from the night prior.
“First of all stop pacing before you put a hole in my carpet. And can you hand me a bottle? I think Mark is waking up.” He looked down and the tiny baby bundled up in his arms.
Now they were in the car, driving in silence, nothing but the sound of the wind ripping through the cracked windows. Castiel shivered a bit at the cold air, but he wouldn’t complain. The mood in the car was so dead it matched the November air, and he didn’t want to ruin the silence, for fear that it would either set Dean off or he would shut down entirely. He certainly would not question the things he had heard tonight. Those were very personal matters that Dean hadn’t told him about, he felt in due time they would have that conversation, but Dean wasn’t ready. For it to just burst out like that, he had no preparation, no mental readying before diving into something like that. Castiel had many questions, but he kept them quiet.
The brothers give him an insulted look, but Castiel rolls his eyes. “You know I’m right.”
They both know that Cas doesn’t need to eat.
The all-famous ‘Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind, or forgotten’ started out as a very serious thing, like their personal family motto, but turned quickly into blackmail material.
“Hey Dean-o I got a job for you.”
Sam spares them a small, curious glance over his shoulder before he starts herding the kids towards Baby.
They move back to the map room, to commence the cleaning.
Castiel smiles and it’s a very insidious smile. He steps up to Dean and the hunter’s hands immediately find his hips when Cas gets too close.
“I wish you could be here with us, kid.” Dean says, still looking up, and Cas continues to kiss Dean’s skin. It’s hot under his lips from all the sunbathing, a darker shade than before, already tanned.
“I thought being glad was a form of appreciation.”
Castiel gives a loud sigh and rolls his eyes, while Sam’s on the phone with Max.
Dean groans and then stares at the thing again. Cas waits. He looks over to Dean, his blue eyes wide and pleading and Dean sighs.
Castiel’s wings shutter momentarily, and he moves his grace, the white sparkling here and there and making Dean squint his eyes.
He angles himself towards Cas, leaning in and surprises him by kissing Cas, deep and long and very sweet.
Anxious about what Dean thinks of the whole thing.
“Hi! How can I help you?” she says straight away, settling behind the counter and looking up, expectant.
Yeah, Cas should totally back off.
It’s almost like watching sand or water slip through his fingers on a deserted beach, watching it go back to where it came from in the first place, be apart of nature once more.
was rolling ending credits when they were having their cuddling-fest on the bed.
Castiel’s head tilts to the side. “What game? Like twister? I can assure you, I don’t own any games.”
Let’s not talk about how the last time they were at a hunt, they shared a bed in a motel room and even though Castiel doesn’t need sleep, he still stayed by Dean’s side, their hands touching and just listening to Dean sleep.
“Yup. We’re just missing the hula girls now.” Dean jokes, but Cas coughs.
Cas stays still, eyeing him. “Dean?” he asks, hesitating if he should get up and follow.
He most certainly won’t eat it, but Dean most certainly will.
“But how can we know it's you?”
Castiel beams at him. “I’ve missed you too, Sam.”
Dean rubs his face. Sam hears his jaw crack.
Sam squeezes his shoulder, making him look up. “Guess you gotta keep within earshot, huh?”
Dean is pale and tired. Or,
Dean licks his lips, throat working. “Yeah.”
“Oh, yeah, I’m good.” Sam flops down, slumping a little in his seat with fatigue, content to finish his water. He does not seem to notice Dean and Cas’ hands are still linked on the bench between them. Dean doesn’t make a move to break the connection.
, but… I also want to be on the job, having your back, if you are, so… I kind of mean us, yeah. Sorry.”
“I don’t mean… get out of the life. But… Perhaps we could be the new Roadhouse? Or do more of the dispatch and reference check, like Bobby did? We sure have all the fake the phone lines we need at the bunker, uh… or like, oh joy, be the research center. What with the whole library and all.” He fidgets. “Y’know. Get out of the field.” He glances at Castiel, who’s listening serenely. “Cas is human. We’ve got him back. Maybe it’s a sign, you know?” Dean gives Sam a hopeful smile. “I'm thinking it might be time to get lives with a little less daily danger. I don't wanna have to try to live without either of you ever again,” he admits. “I think we have plenty of empirical evidence that I'm not very good at it.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
Dean blinks, rigid, statuesque in suspended grief and emotional turmoil. Then, he exhales through his nose. “Sammy. Get the keys.”
“That’s considerate of you,” Cas sanctions.
“Oh.” Dean startles, then pulls back to stare at Castiel, as if taking in the state of him for the first time. He tugs the comforter back in place, one hand coming to rub Castiel’s arm through it while he stares down at their feet. He gives Cas a crooked grin. “Let's get you warmed up and fed. You're shaking.”
Dean spirals, anyway. Cas is close enough that Dean is effectively looking down into his face, now. It’s disarming and heartbreaking, and it just
“Let’s go inside. I already got a table reserved for us.”
“Spontaneous and funny. That’s what I need in a girlfriend.”
“Fuck.” Dean moaned once the toy was fully inside him.
street. The food was amazing.”
He leaned forward and placed a passion filled kiss on Dean’s lips. They pulled apart and Dean gave him a sad smile before retreating for the door. He slipped out with a small goodbye and gloom all over his face. Castiel immediately grabbed up his phone and dialed Charlie. He craved the company of his friend in such an emotional time as this. She didn’t take long and showed up on his doorstep bright and happy within the hour.
“What do you want?” He growled.
Sam: you know im not doing that. How’s the party?
He scissored his fingers before leaning forward to push them even deeper inside the other man. His breathing got heavier and he began to rock back subtly on his digits.
“No honey, they give the illusion of being clothed. Imagine Dean strutting around in a pair of these, bending over to grab something, or cooking dinner. Hmm?”
“John this—“
He just hoped Cas would get back to him before the anticipation ate him alive.
The man sat on the bed, an array of toys around him. Castiel had no idea when those got there, but he was thrilled to see each and every one used. Dean was propped up on way too many pillows for a normal person’s bed, but the bleached white of them made his skin glow all the more. He looked right at the camera licking his lips. Castiel found himself licking his own as well.
“You said you would make my hard work worthwhile. If I recall correctly you said ‘make it up to me.”
*                             *                             *                             *
“I completely understand.” He broke eye contact.
“Well on a good note Dean and I had a nice dinner last night. He got us a reservation at that really fancy restaurant on 4
The giant man—Sam—stepped aside letting him step into the entry way. On the left wall behind the door was a large mirror and a coat rack, a bowl containing varied amounts of keys sat on a little end table. As he stepped further inside, feet gliding under him on the shining wood floors, he was assaulted with the heavy, happy scent of home cooking and family. It was a heavenly smell that wrapped its warm arms around him as he was greeted by Mary and an older man, he assumed was her husband. The smiles on these people’s faces were so open and honest that all the nervous energy that pent up inside him was now melting away. Of course, it was reinstated as he saw Dean walk through the front door.
As soon as he got in his room, he ripped his clothes from him and took a long hot shower. This Inn by far was the nicest place he’d ever stayed, including that little sublet rental he’d had back in Chicago. The water pressure was nice, every day he had fresh sheets, all the appliances in the room worked. It was wonderful. Midway through him rinsing out his hair he’d heard the kettle start to blow. Quickly toweling off he walked into the room bare, and still dripping to make his tea. Dressed in ratty old sweatpants that belonged to his brother, and a secondhand sweater he settled with his travel mug and his book on the bed.
“Well I think you should have it. In case you ever need to crash here or anything, just in case I’m not home. So what’d you and Sam have to talk about?” Dean sat in his seat at the island and began eating the dinner he prepared.
Thanks for the help Cas. You saved my ass. ;)
At that Dean laughed. It was a noise bathed in sarcasm and spite. Someone had shut the music off and it was the only noise to be heard in the room. Dean could see Ruby off in the corner of the kitchen bouncing little Mark in her arms, he was crying softly, startled by all the shouting.
“You pick.”
“As you should.”
He tried not to scowl; he really did. What troubled him was what she meant by heart throb. Was Dean discussing him at work? He’s never been the object of someone’s affection, not to his knowledge anyway. He wouldn’t know how to react to it if he did. Never staying somewhere long enough to form a connection with anyone was Castiel's norm. It wasn’t that he didn’t have physical needs or desires, he just didn’t want to take the chance of bedding the wrong person and end up in the clutches of those he ran from.  Dean walked into the room scowling at Jo before finally seeing Castiel and a smile was on his face instantly.
He was cut off by Cas finally making a move. His plush warm lips searched other Deans. Little breathes and sighs leaving him. Gosh this dude knew how to kiss. Dean had to make a conscious effort not to get rough with the guy. He didn’t want to scare him off with his aggressive nature. He let one hand wander to the back of Castiel’s neck while the other settled on his waist, pulling the slightly shorter man closer to him. His leg was positioned in between Castiel’s and he pushed his thigh into his growing erection. Cas let out a soft but lewd moan at Dean’s movement. Dean needed to stop now before there was no going back. He pulled from the kiss with their mouths millimeters apart from each other. Smoking at the school was one thing. You can smoke quietly. You can’t bend someone over your desk with their face planted in a pile of papers, while their hands are tied around their back, with legs wide open and their pretty little….
“I was just um—going for a walk. Figured I’d stop by and say hello.”
Managing to get away from a woman telling him about how her and her husband met only for the relationship to fall apart because she’d fell in love with his sister. The divorce wasn’t going well and their family was falling apart. She was glad they hadn’t had kids yet, wouldn’t want to put kids through the nasty mess that was her life.
“I was just going to go for a walk.”
Once they’d had their dancing fill they waded their way back to the bar to find Charlie talking intensely to someone. Upon closer inspection of the build and hair he assumed it to be Balthazar.
“That’s what I like best about you.” He paused. “It’s a gift and a curse of yours ain’t it?”
8888888888888
Balthazar, tie askew, stumbled towards him. His suit jacket was missing, probably forever. He wasn’t sloppily drunk, but his intoxication was clear to him.
“I’m not opposed to that.” He let his tongue drag along Cas’ earlobe and loved the way he shivered in his arms.
“Hey Dean.” She bounced happily over to him. “What can I do ya for?” she playfully punched his arm.
Cas leaned towards Dean in the small space of the car. Their faces meeting in the middle. Dean’s body had moved without his permission and now they were eye to eye. It felt like a tense eternity before Cas moved the rest of the way and placed a soft kiss on Dean’s lips. When they parted Dean sighed at the space now between them.
“Can’t sleep.”
“We can leave if you’d like.” He said carefully caressing his hand across Dean’s upper back.
“Love you Cassie.” And with that his door was closed and his brother was gone.
“Speak for yourself bitch.” Dean piped in.
“It’s not morally wrong no, but I don’t think either of us would be in a position to do such a thing.”
He saw a flash of genuine sadness in the man’s eyes but quickly ignored it. Castiel hated this man with everything in him.
The other downside to this whole thing was having to watch a bunch of his Gabe’s previous films to get a feel for their style of filming. He made it a point of avoiding anything Gabriel directed, and now he was drowning in it. Saying no to Gabriel was like taking a bottle from a hungry baby, it made him feel cruel and he didn’t want to look at the reaction he’d received. Gabe was the only brother of his (besides his twin) that he could stomach for long periods of time. Though he was a master trickster and often made every situation as unbearable as possible, he was still very much in Castiel’s corner. He was loyal to a fault and always ready to defend him. Saying no to this, when he genuinely needed help and support was just something Castiel couldn’t do.
Dean had almost let slip that Cas should keep some stuff here so that he wouldn’t have a lug a bag around every time he stayed over, but he clamped his mouth shut before her spoke. They'd only been dating for about a month now and to suggest something like that was too soon.
“Talk to your brother. He wants to shoot again soon. I want you behind the lens.”
“Take me to your room.” He commanded in a husky voice.
“Bright and early as usual.”
Before he gave it much thought he was pulling out his little burner phone and handing it to the gorgeous human in front of him. He watched as Dean happily put his number in, even sending himself a text before handing it back. They said their goodbyes with an accompanying hug. Castiel felt no shame watching Dean go through the glass doors. Dean had a phenomenal physique and he’d watch him for as long as he was allowed.
“Well this is our friend Balthazar from high school.”
“Wanna go get breakfast?”
“It was mainly for new couples, but either way it was an enjoyable time.”
He pulled off wiping his wet lips with his arm and continued stroking Castiel’s thigh watching him gasp in his orgasm rush. Cas waited until his breathing slowed and his mind returned to him before speaking.
Now he found himself walking up the side walk to the front door of his actual home. He still felt eyes on him, but refused to turn around and give whoever it was the satisfaction of being noticed. Walking through the door he heard some bustle in the kitchen and went to go investigate.
They sat side by side with bowls in their hands, filled to the brim of seafood stew. Castiel had found the recipe on some random website. He was halfway surprised that it turned out as good as he'd hoped it would. Dean dug in the second the bowl was handed to him and practically inhaled it before going to get another helping. Castiel was beside himself with Desire for the other man and his obscene noises while he ate. There was some movie on that he just randomly chose, but his attention was so far elsewhere that he couldn't even recall the name of it.
“Hey Dad.” He sighed.
“It’s only been a day.”
While his room wasn’t in particular bad shape, he didn’t want to inconvenience Dean by making him park his car and walk all the way over here. It was his own fault that he was late, and he felt bad enough about it without adding to it. He hung up the phone and did much more flailing than actually finding something to wear. He had no idea where they were going so, he didn’t know if he should be formal or not.
“If I take this gag off will you promise me you won’t scream?”
Dean thought his words over for a while not knowing what to say in response. Cas didn’t know much about Dean’s past at all, but he still wanted to support him. He hated chick flick moments like the plague, but he couldn’t help but feel touched.
“That was fun huh?”
“You should go to his office hours.” Charlie spoke between sips of her water.
“I’m not jealous. I mean he was a little handsy with me too.”
Feeling emboldened by the positive response, he gotten on top of the man grinding his middle down while putting their lips back together. Dean’s hands went right to his bare ass, grabbing chunks of flesh and releasing, effectively rocking Castiel on top of him. The feeling was like nothing he’d ever experienced with his own hand.
“Hmm well you like what you like. Too bad for him.”
“For not being here for you and Dad. I couldn’t make mom’s funeral and I couldn’t protect you from that Roman bastard. I regret that more than you know, but like I said I want to make up for it. I’m sorry Cassie.” He could see the sadness creeping up in his brother’s features. “I gotta be more of a family man, at least for you two.”
Mark babbled as best as he could with few actual words squeezed between it.
888888888
He pulled himself from the seat to gather his things. Thankfully his coat was fully dry and his duffel was as well. He checked the contents praying that no one robbed him. He didn’t have much, but of what he had was immensely valuable to him, including the couple hundred in cash he had to his name. With the little quality of life he had, holding down a solid job wasn’t something he could do. Every place he went it was odd jobs and temporary positions that he could have. Working a gas station, being a secretary when someone was on maternity leave, janitor in an elementary school. Those were all honest jobs and he didn’t view them as lesser then being some corporate honcho, but that was all he could afford to take on. As a child he was home schooled by his mother and his nanny, college was never in the cards for him, so he had no formal education in his adulthood. With the terrible job market of this day and age there wasn’t much to offer. What little money he came by he held near and dear to him.
“I’ll be back Cas.”
Dean cleared his throat trying to get his bearings under him. He didn’t mind being drunk and emotionally wrecked by himself. He didn’t want to expose Cas to that side of him. Not in the beginning of their relationship or ever.
All of that is probably why he’s holding onto Cas so hard. He’d making efforts that wouldn’t even have crossed his mind in the past. Maybe he’d growing up or its opposites truly attracting. it’s just so easy to drown himself in everything about Cas. Whether it’s the universe at work or not, he’s made the decision to fall and he’s sticking to it.
“No brother, that’s not a story I can tell you. Matter of fact, don’t even mention it to him. I’m just saying he’d really appreciate you being there.”
The sight before him was more debauched than he could ever imagine. Dean’s backside was on full display, his hole entirely exposed. It was reddened and spit slick from all of Castiel’s previous work. Dean was shaking as he stroked himself, thrusting into the circle he’d made with his hands. He was beautiful, and their moans rang through the air.
“Nothing.”
“The guy is making positive waves, getting a pretty big name. Surprised the hell out of me when my manager said he agreed to do this with me.”
“If you’re referring to the delicious business proposition I have reached a decision.”
Dean agreed, he could take the straightaway edge to Dean by himself. It would be harder to do the turns so they’d work on that after. He skated away until he was just before the turn and moved to face the other man. His death grip was back, but this time it was the wall. Dean watched as several emotions passed across his face until it was set at sheer determination. His hand loosened until just his fingertips grazed the material and when he got his balance he glided one foot in front of the other and moved forward. He was still quite slow, but his strides were strong. The confidence shown on his face and he grinned. Dean watched in awe, not so much at his skating ability, but at how much he wanted to be by Castiel’s side as he discovered all the things he was capable of. The too bright spotlights spun above their heads, a stark contrast to the darkness of the building. Blues, reds, and greens flashed over Castiel’s face, but nothing was brighter than his eyes in that moment.
Clicking on the second video it started with two attractive looking guys playing chess. How could this move to porn? He clicked the time stamp forward and found that they were playing for the removal of clothes. He clicked further even more and the blonde man ended up naked first. It was decided that he would be the bottom. Moving ahead further still the brunette man that had won the game tied the blonde’s hands to the head board and began opening him up with his tongue and fingers. He seemed to be enjoying it. Castiel was quite aware that these people were still actors and they get paid to look like they enjoy what’s being done to them, but nonetheless he appeared to genuinely enjoy what was happening. Without the use of his hands he was at the total mercy of the other guy. A certain amount of trust would be required to do something like this with a partner. Totally against his decision his mind flashed back to how he was held down during the incident with Dick and his friends. A nasty shiver ran through his body and a pit grew in his stomach. He didn’t want anything like that ever again. He wondered if Dean would want something like this. He wasn’t even sure if he could trust Dean to do this to him, or anyone for that matter.
“We’re gonna do this you know that right?”
*		*		*		*
That night was filled with food and laughter. It was a little awkward at first, but soon enough the trio fit together like old friends and Dean truly had a good time. His brother and his lover coming together to keep him together. It was warm and exciting and he was very satisfied with how the two got along. They could nerd out together, leaving Dean out of the conversation, but he didn’t feel uncomfortable or left out. He felt the complete opposite of those. He sat back in his suede chair and just enjoyed watching the two of them enjoy each other.
“Yes.”
He sighed and kept moving, no time to think outside the mission of saving Cas. The hallway went on for a while, but Dean could see another set of double doors in front of him. Dusty windows gave him to way to peer into the door before he opened the doors. He took a second to breathe before he opened them.
“Oh come on! You can’t be too mad at me. Not after that.”
“I didn’t say a word. Just watched you watched me. What’s going on in that pretty little head of yours?”
By the time he’d gotten back to the Inn he realized he’d had no idea where they even lived. Mary had forgotten to give him the address and he needed to know if he had enough time to get there. He rang up Missouri and she chuckled at her friend’s forgetfulness and gave him the address. Pulling up the location on his phone he was relieved that it was only a 15-minute walk.
“Castiel Novak I taught you better than that.”
“Horses? That’s a lot of work.” Dean paused to take a breath and a drink of water. “Damn Cas I haven’t laughed like that in years.”
“Even if I said I wanted to slather apple pie on me and watch you lick it off?”
Without any opposition he took Dean where he wanted to go. Once they were inside Dean took to rearranging things the way he wanted them to go. He sat his desk chair in front of the foot of the bed, and after asking him where his lube was he threw that onto the bed.
He kept his eyes straight as he tried to keep his emotions in check. Once his vision focused again after blinking back his tears he saw a lone table in the middle of the room with a phone sitting in the center. He walked over to the table and immediately recognized it as Cas’ phone. Picking it up he thumbed through to the messages and sure enough Chuck’s thread was first. The pictures and weird messages he’d received were from Cas’ phone with his number blocked.
Finally they got a ping on both their phones, Sam’s from Jess and Dean’s from Charlie. They had just arrived and were turning on their mics. From Charlie’s go pro they could see Rowena’s residence. Some fancy vampire mansion in the middle of the woods. The sun was just starting to set, but thank goodness for technology cause they could see just fine. Had this been 10 years ago the quality of the camera would be pointless.
“Real glad I set that up, seeing my baby brother get all high school crush over you.”
Shopping? Dean had barely realized it was December until it was brought up. He would have to buy for Bobby and Ellen, they would of course being throwing another family dinner he’d have to attend. He’d have to get Sam something, he already had an idea of what he would get him. He’d have to buy for Mark, he was only 1 ½ so he’d be the easiest to shop for. Then there’s Castiel, what on Earth would he get him?! Dean was silently panicking as he took a sip from his beer and nonchalantly nodding his head. Of course he had no idea what to get the other man, and yes Dean just needed more stress to add to the forever growing pile. He hadn’t even thought about what he wanted. Usually he’d have a shiny neat list written out on some notebook paper that he would give Sam to spread the ideas around. This year he was severely lacking in Holiday organization.
Spending time with Dean only got better with time. Castiel wasn’t surprised by this, since the first night he’d met the man he knew that the brazen, flirtatious exterior was but a shield for the caring, compassionate man underneath it. Sure the man was still relentlessly flirtatious, but since they’d agreed that they were in a relationship with one another it was all directed towards him. He liked that side of the man, it riled him up in ways that no one else had been able to. It was deeply ingrained in his sense of humor, and although some of the things he said teasingly to Castiel the man didn’t quite understand he could get the gist of it.
John slowly approached Dean and gave him a one armed hug. Dean half-heartedly returned the gesture and made sure to pull back as soon as he made contact. John’s face slumped a bit at the lack of emotion Dean was showing.
Cas: Not that I’m opposed. Just wondering if it’s alright to tell Dean.
Dean went back to his work. Slightly flushed in his cheeks from his remarks of Castiel’s name. It actually made him smile. To see that he wanted to be polite to the man. They finished up their work shortly after. Dean leaned back in his chair to stretch. His shirt rose just a little and Castiel saw a small strip of his bare skin. He wanted to touch so bad. Luckily the hulking desk was in the way of Castiel making the worst mistake he had in a long time.
The others at the table all said there piece and Ellen rose from the table to get the pies. Castiel wanted to offer his help, but the look of sheer disappointment and shame that flooded Dean’s features kept him from doing that. The nature of the situation also prevented him from wanting to comfort his lover. He wanted nothing more than to wrap Dean up in his arms and shield him from any harm. They had grown on one another in the most delightful way.

There were so many pieces on the board at this point they were far beyond checkers and chess at this point. Whoever these Hell’s Prince people thought they were they had nothing on the Hunter’s initiative. This was probably the largest operation their chapter had seen in the last 50 years. As they were on the smaller side, despite the strength and knowledge they had, they just didn’t have the man power for jobs like this. When big things arose they usually went to the Campbell’s, Mom’s family, since they had the people and the skill to back it up. Loki, well known in the magick community, picked them specifically though. Not only was he paying them a fat chunk of change, but if they did this right, and took down a big bad like the Princes, they’d be known as the best chapter in the country.  Tonight’s meeting was at Bobby’s house, drinks and food was plenty and the mingling was fun, but now it was time to get down to business. Their chapter’s current mission was: Protect the Chime child, or as Dean liked to call it ‘Shoot down anyone who tries to harm his boyfriend’.
“It’s great to see you,” Sam says, unable to find strong enough words to express how it feels to have a family member back after he thought they’d lost him.
Cas, who must know him well enough to anticipate this line of thinking… Cas, is begging him not to do that.
Castiel, looking just as baffled to be welcome as he was before, although much happier, stares back. “I'm just happy you're here.”
there’s a huff on the line.
Castiel appears in the entrance, shaking gore off his hand. He wipes his knife before sliding it back in its sheath. He hands the rag over to Sam when he and Dean catch up to him; together, they walk out of the old barn. “The masks were a bit much,” Castiel comments.
Then, maybe. Maybe, Dean can try.
Dean moves, and Sam looks down to find he’s holding out a flask. “Can you..?”
Dean sighs, scrubs a hand down his face and shifts. “Sammy, you good driving for a while?”
Dean grins.
Dean smiles, shoulders slumping with relief, and he slides his own fist forward to bump their knuckles together gently. Sam shifts his eyes to Castiel. “Cas? What do you think?”
Cas huffs, grinning down at his lap.
and for Dean to carry on living in it.
Sam laughs, incredulous, and glances back at Dean. “It’s him! It really is.”
Cas is asking.
Sam sits, back against the booth, with his eyebrows high on his forehead. He reflects on how Dean has been so happy since yesterday, and how broken he’s been for the past year, and thinks maybe he missed some clues. One thing is pretty easy to conclude, though. Must have been one hell of a last conversation, they shared. He looks at the tabletop, scratching his hairline, trying to keep his grin from breaking his face. He shakes his head and peeks up, makes a face and raps his knuckles on the table as he gets up. “I’m gonna go pay. Meet you at the car.”
couldn’t. There’s no need to explain. Sam is very much hoping this isn’t some kind of trick, and it’ll be incredibly painful if it turns out to be one; but he’s not an idiot, he’s well aware it would be much worse on Dean. He understands the last step urge to
Dean allows himself to get lost in the moment for a little longer, then he breaks the kiss reluctantly, nosing Cas’ cheek before he leans away. Blue eyes blink back at him, calm and happy. “It’s uh… you know. It’s just an idea. We can work out all the details. You get to chose everything you want. I just want…”
a familiar purr greets them.
“You remember everything up to when you got taken?” Dean interrupts, voice cold as he addresses Cas directly for the first time.
Sam, who jumped to his feet as well, stares at the name on the display. The call, which is still open, reads ‘

Sam snorts. “Why do I feel like I already know what the dog looks like, in this scenario?”
“Rowena… This is a weird time, we’re a bit…”
touch, he’s not sure he’ll manage to stop for very long, anytime soon. “We’re getting our own room tonight. I wanna spend some more time kissing you - possibly a lot more - without sexiling my brother,” he declares, voice low.
Sam runs a hand through his hair. “Woah, uh…”
Sam nods, turns on the ignition.
They lean against the car while Castiel climbs in the backseat to wriggle into several much-needed layers. Next to Sam, Dean rubs his face, staring into the landscape ahead. “What the fuck,” he mutters quietly. He peeks behind them, unable to help himself from checking that this isn’t a fever dream. To be honest, Sam feels the same urge. But maybe it’s enough to see Dean look away with a beaming, baffled smile.
“Yes,” he breathes out, barely a sound.
Sam glances at them through the rearview mirror before he can help himself. Castiel seems to be looking at the calendar app on Dean’s phone. Right, he said he didn’t know how long it had been since he… maybe didn’t die. Dean is looking down as well, at his own empty hands, brow tight. He licks his lips. “I tried,” he amends. He looks back at Cas, wry. Tired. “So far so good.”
The drum beat accelerates, then abruptly stops. Dean clenches his hand for a second, then consciously lays it flat on the table. “Um. So.”
Time feels suspended for a moment. Dean’s throat works as he awaits Cas’ answer, he strokes his thumb over Cas’, to try and convey that it’s Cas’ decision and only his, and that he shouldn’t feel pressured. It’s just an idea. A pipe dream, really. And then Dean’s breath gets lodged somewhere in his chest when Castiel smiles, starting with his eyes. “That sounds wonderful,” he replies softly, before he leans up and kisses Dean.
“I can ask you to let me go,” Jack said softly, eyes boring into Sam’s, “I can ask you to do what you think is right, and save everyone else, and save the world again, without worrying about me. About whether I’ll come into existence from what you do…or not.”
“Not that it will matter, much longer,” Jack conceded, voice subdued and bitter. It was such a drastic mood change that Sam floundered for a moment, blinking, before realigning himself to this new twist.
you, Sam. When I was born, and I had nobody, and my father was gone, and Dean hated me…”
“Jack, we love you.
Gabriel is still staring him down now, his expression closed and utterly unreadable. He looks Sam up and down for a moment, before a slight scowl crosses his face and before Sam can stop him or eve protest, he’s raised his arm and snapped his fingers loudly.
Sam Winchester never thought he would be grateful to hear Heat of the Moment blaring the moment he woke up.
he hated crying, if Sam asked he was definitely going to deny this - and his head to fall back with a thud that probably should have sent a jolt of pain through his skull, but he was too numb to notice it. Long enough for his eyes to drill a hole into the ground in front of him, staring at the spot where the former angel had stood just moments before, almost daring him to come back, to come back and give him some smug look for cheating death
He didn't know how much time passed as he sat against the wall, feeling numb and feeling as though he was burning simultaneously in a twisted emotional oxymoron. Long enough for his pained sobs to dry up -

Dean was his weakness. And Sam was Dean’s. The two of them did not know when to cut their losses and quit, didn’t know when to let go. They would tear up heaven and hell themselves for each other a hundred times over, consequences be damned. Their sense of loyalty to one another was dangerous – and all too often, deadly.
“See you around, Jack.”
“You might wanna take a seat, this…this could take a while.”
He still didn’t quite expect to pass out into his plate of toast mid-sentence, however.
“But that’s not the only reason,” He admitted, “Even if I hadn’t done that, I…wouldn’t be able to bring you back.”
He began pacing, listing them aloud absently.
big guy, wanna scream a little louder? I think some folks up in Alaska might not have heard ya.”
“I couldn’t save Dean, but you should know, I…I brought Cas back,” He admitted. He looked up at Sam, quickly justifying, guilt clear on his face.
change. He takes on a somewhat guarded expression as he takes a minute step back, staring up at Sam with a newfound wariness and suspicion. His eyes narrow slightly for a moment, tongue flitting across his lips nervously, before he schooled his face into an uncaring one once more and spoke again.
“And this time isn’t?”
Gabe hummed, looking Sam up and down absently, before clapping his hands together in a business-like manner.
So needless to say, yes, he elected not to mention it to Dean until he felt more sure about the situation. But he needed to seek out the truth somehow.
“I’m sure he did know that, but that isn’t the problem, Sam. The problem is whether you could…without me.”
it. He was composed of 40% sarcasm, 40% sass, 10% attitude and 10% miscellaneous other personality traits that would occasionally rear their heads when the situation called for it. Sincerity was simply not a word in his vocabulary, and neither were the words ‘emotional vulnerability’. Talking about his family was generally a no-no. Asking for his assistance for something he did not want to do was
“I love you, too,” He replied softly, voice muffled against Sam’s shoulder and yet still audibly quaking slightly, “And I know that Castiel won’t hold it against you. It isn’t your fault, Sam. It’s Chuck’s.”
“Right…If I changed anything, it would change the future that’s already happened, too,” He said, sighing, “You should just bring me back then, Jack.”
He also wasn’t alone in his dream; he could tell that much. He had shared dreams with angels and demons often enough in his life to be able to tell when someone was invading his mind. For a wild, fearful moment, he half expected to see Lucifer prowling around the corners of his mind, even though he knew fine well that
But as he finally stood, ready to leave this God forsaken room, and leave Cas' final place behind, he glanced at the spot he had once stood and swallowed deeply once more. He closed his eyes, exhaled slowly and schooled himself to look more neutral, less...well. Heartbroken.
And then, with a gasp, he jolted awake.
He gripped Jack, trying to make him understand.

“I can’t ever thank you enough for it, Sam,” He said earnestly, “But…I can ask you to do something for me.”
“Goodbye, Sam,” He uttered softly. A tear trickled down his cheek, just as Sam felt one escape his own eye.
Gabriel cursed loudly, scrambling back in the booth in surprise, hand over his heart.
scared of was losing those he loved; it had already happened so many times. Too many times. How many times had he watched his own brother fall, seen his parental figures perish, seen his best friend (he refused to linger on the way the word 'friend' now left a slightly bitter taste in his mouth) struck down? The honest answer was, he didn't know. He had lost track. But every single time was raw and fresh and awful. Every single time was like losing them for the first time all over again.
Jack sent him a small, tired smile, eyes sparkling with gratitude even as his hands found refuge stuffed safely in his pockets. He ducked his head once again, before continuing.
“We’re the unluckiest family in the world, I sometimes think,” He agreed. Jack tilted his head at him, small smile playing about his lips.
And Sam opens his mouth, braces himself, and launches into the longest explanation of his life.
He declares it boldly, and Gabriel’s brow raises marginally. If he has any suspicion whatsoever about what Sam is about to say, he doesn’t indicate it. He probably doesn’t, Sam muses to himself. At this point in the timeline, he isn’t even supposed to know that angels exist in the first place, never mind the fact that the Trickster himself was one.
Jack seemed to see his dilemma, and smiled weakly at him. Now, his difficulty summoning happiness made complete sense. He had known this whole time, he must have done, that there was a very high chance that he was about to be wiped from existence completely. His every action, his presence, all gone from the world.

“Well, you aren’t lying,” He says at last, “I can see it – your soul is older than it should be.”

“So, lunch?” He prompted. Gabriel broke into a grin, brushing his hands together theatrically.

He snickered to himself at the less than amused expression on Sam’s face, clapping the taller man on the back in a surprisingly friendly action.
Jack nodded shamefully.

to. The two of them were positively
“Without you? What’re you…”
He took Sam’s arm in an imploring grip, tugging his sleeve in a way that also tugged on Sam’s heartstrings with its familiarity and Sam felt as if he were drowning.
It was one of few things Sam knew with certainty. The sky was blue, what goes up must come down, Dean was his brother, Chuck Shirley must always, always be brought down for the sake of the world. Jack shot him a brief smile, completely void of any happiness.
But he certainly didn’t want to jump Sam’s bones the way he did Dean’s.
the smug sort of possessiveness when Cas had admitted that he and Dean had a more
“B-But that wasn’t me trying to be biased,” He hastened, “I just needed help, sorting out heaven, and I thought who better? Besides…” A tiny glint of mischief gleamed in his eyes now, an impish look that Sam knew in an instant he had learned from Cas himself blossoming, “I thought Dean would appreciate it, too.”
It took a moment of his quiet thought to realise that Gabriel was staring very intently at him, eyes narrowed just slightly. His gaze held an edge of…something. Something that made Sam feel slightly uneasy as he remembered that he was in fact in the presence of one of God’s four most powerful creations.
“It’s Chuck,” He finally said. Sam stared at him blankly, the words not fully registering at first, and even when they did, he still couldn’t fully comprehend them.
to come back and...and...
He exhaled slowly, running a hand warily through his hair in a way that practically mirrored Dean.
“Jack?” He prompted, and the kid flinched slightly, eyes flicking up before looking away. He looked frightened, beneath the surface, Sam realised.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gabriel shrugged once more and slid effortlessly to his feet, hands still nonchalantly crammed in his pockets.
Sam isn’t surprised at Gabriel’s immediate impatient desire to take action. It’s very on brand for the angel. Unfortunately, he didn’t exactly have an answer for him.
People that he right now had a chance to save.
He was a divine being, one who had saved Dean's ass more times than the man could count, one who Dean knew, despite their occasional ups and downs over the many, many years they'd known each other, he could always rely on. Just as much as Sam.
“That’s true,” He agreed easily, “I do. Or, I did. But Gabriel, you have to realise, I…I’m coming from like twelve years in the future, man. Believe it or not, I do eventually learn the lesson you’re trying to teach me. That someday, I have to accept the truth and face the world without Dean. And I was. I was facing it, and I was getting on with life, because…”
“In a lot of ways,” He conceded, “But…in a lot of ways, we weren’t. We were lucky to have each other, while we did. Lucky to love each other so much. I think our bond was pretty unique, I’m sure you agree.
But before he let himself ponder any of that properly, he did what he was really dying to do, and he flung himself at his older brother in a tight, frantic embrace. Dean cursed loudly and nearly fell backwards, one hand flying back to maintain balance while the other loosely hugged Sam back, confusion practically radiating off the older man as he awkwardly patted his back. But Sam didn’t care. He didn’t care that he was a thirty something (or, well, he supposed he was twenty-five again now) year old man clinging to his big brother like he was a toddler again, scared of the monsters under his bed. He just…
His cheeks flushed slightly, ducking his head in embarrassment as he mumbled, “But it was a lot harder than I thought it’d be.”
“Well…Yeah. I do. You gotta admit, you do have a track record there, Sam-a-lam.”
a no-no. But, negative traits aside, he had a surprisingly brave, helpful streak, a wicked sense of humour and easiness to talk to and was, all in all, one of the more pleasant angels that Sam had ever met – although frankly that wasn’t saying much, considering his competition.
of that yet. I…I wouldn’t even know where to start.”
Sam allowed himself to hold the kid that he had partially come to view as his own, squeezing him tightly and exhaling slowly, tension leaving him slowly like water leaking out of a dam. Hugs with Jack hadn’t been a particularly uncommon occurrence, and he was relieved to experience it again.
“I thought angels didn’t eat.”
“Little Castiel is just an angel, and not one who spends a whole lot of time down on Earth. Stands to reason he wouldn’t be as adjusted to eating as someone like me. Which, by the way,” He added as an afterthought, “Ix-nay on the abriel-gay when we’re in public. Walls have ears; and by that, I mean, angels do, and are notorious snoops. I’ve spent this long evading them, I’m not planning on going back heaven-bound anytime soon.”
“Yeah, actually, we do. There’s a lot more going on than you know right now, Gabe.”
“What do you mean?” Sam repeated, trying to fight back the instinctual irritation that this conversation was provoking. Getting angry at Jack would not solve anything. It seemed that he could hear the hint of anger in his voice nonetheless, as he shrank down slightly, looking for all the world like the young boy who had once lived in the bunker with them and not at all like the deity he now was.
“That’s breaking it down to the very, very basics, but…yeah, essentially.”
Jack’s smile was a little more real now, and he turned to face outwards. All of a sudden, Sam’s dream shifted, from the vague blankness of the previous background, to a much more familiar one. One that made his heart ache.
He paused, suddenly, as if remembering something.
Sam snorted. “Don’t I know it.”
Gabriel was openly staring at him again, the pity further present on his face. He didn’t really have any reason to believe Sam – although he was usually very, very good at spotting a lie so perhaps he could simply tell that Sam wasn’t telling one right now. Sam didn’t give him a chance to speak, clearing his throat. Sympathy wouldn’t do anything for him.
Sam laughed, humourless.
soft to ever be directed at Dean Winchester. Dean was a monster, a monster who killed other monsters. He was destructive, he was angry, he was broken. And he did not deserve to have the respect of someone like Cas, never mind the
He didn’t know what to say in this situation.
He was dreaming, he knew he was. He had been answering some of Gabriel’s more prying conversations about the apocalypse and about Chuck, when he had quite literally felt himself keel forward, head thudding and eyes slipping shut as he fell into a slumber.
“Because…Dean deserves to be happy. And he deserves to be at peace. And I know that Jack will have brought Cas back from the Empty, because there’s no way he would leave him there, so…He deserves a break, man. They both do. A chance to just relax up in Heaven with our family, for once.”
“I still want to keep him alive,” Sam admitted, “But only because this time I know I actually can. Last time was just fuelled by sheer desperation to not lose my brother.”
“I’m sorry, Sam,” He said, voice borderline miserable, eyes almost near tears, “I would have saved Dean, I really would, but I…I couldn’t start showing favouritism, bringing people back from the dead, even my…” He faltered at the end of the sentence, swallowing deeply, and did not finish it. But Sam didn’t need him to. He knew what word would complete it, even if Jack was too self-conscious to say it aloud.
the ex-angel had made him feel until he was gone and now he just felt
He’s just opened his mouth to below his name one more time to the unresponsive sky when the oh so familiar voice comes from behind him.
And for the second time, Sam was tugged into a hug by his surrogate son. He could feel a faint tremor in the embrace, and he honestly wasn’t sure whether he or Jack was the source of it. He curled the fingers of one hand into the material of Jack’s brown coat, the other hand coming up to cradle his head, carding through Jack’s soft brown locks. Whether this action was more a comfort to himself, or to Jack, he also didn’t know. But the young boy didn’t tell him to stop, tightening his grip marginally, face pressed into Sam’s shoulder like a little boy trying to hide from the harshness of the world.
“Well…I swore a non-interference policy, remember? Visiting you like this, it’s bad enough, but actually interacting with you in the real world…” He faltered out. Swallowed. Took a breath.
“You were the one who never gave up on me. Who helped me adjust, who protected me from Dean and from the world until Castiel came back. And even after that.”
It was, however, his son.
issue in particular wouldn’t rear its ugly head for many months yet. But no, it wasn’t the caged archangel that was lurking in his mind.
“We loved you too, Jack. Still do.”
He didn’t want to lose the feeling of his kid in his arms, not knowing whether it would be the last time that it ever happened. He tried to memorise the feeling while he still could, mind running at a million miles an hour, replaying each and every moment he had spent with Jack over the years. His laughter, his tears, his anger. His weight against Sam’s shoulder as he slumped against it whilst watching a movie. His chirpy, excited tone whenever he discovered a new fascination. His hand, tugging Sam off in whatever direction he needed him to go, and Sam would always oblige, humouring the boy. Humouring his kid.
At least until he had woken up here, anyway.
“They are,” He confirmed simply, although he did not elaborate on whether he meant they were only together physically, as in sharing the same space, or together in a romantic sense. Whichever it was, it eased a lot of Sam’s stress from the past few weeks. Dean would be fine, be happy, up in heaven with Castiel. They deserved that much, after a lifetime of being torn apart over and over again.
of him...
“First things first, I gotta wonder if I’m the only one who came back,” He pondered, frowning slightly, “I mean, whoever sent me back without even asking my permission…they must have had a reason, and they must have been pretty powerful.”
He didn’t have time to beat around the bush right now, though.
And so that was how he found himself on the sidewalk that morning, completely ignorant of the bewildered stares of strangers around him, yelling the Trickster’s name at the top of his lungs.
He could have said any of this to Cas, and maybe that would have been enough. He was not an emotional guy, really. He didn't wear his heart on his sleeve, instead beneath a deep layer of metaphorical armour. He didn't
Gabriel laughs, and his face still conveys absolutely no shock or uncertainty at the direction of this conversation. He’s always been one hell of a liar.
As if they had never been there in the first place.
The familiar nickname slips out without him fully registering it, before his mind can catch up with his mouth. The angel in front of him blinks in surprise at the familiarity of his tone, and Sam inwardly curses himself for his loose tongue. He was so accustomed to it in the future, it had started to come as naturally as referring to Castiel as Cas. He had forgotten himself for a moment, forgotten that they were currently a decade in the past and even the all-powerful archangel in front of him would have no idea of the future just yet.
His smile widened as he looked up at Sam, eyes nostalgic.
“It’s okay, Jack,” He soothed, keeping his voice as soft as possible. God or not, this was still his kid, after all, “I never blamed you. Not once. And I know Dean wouldn’t either.”
But, without warning, a darkness crossed Jack’s face, reminding Sam that, adorable tendencies aside, Jack was still one of the most powerful people in all of creation.
“Thanks, Sammy, but flattery won’t get ya anywhere, and it sure as heck won’t save your-“
Sam shook his head, firm.
He didn't know why this was the first thought that crossed his mind. It probably shouldn't have been, probably should have been something less insensitive. But, well, Dean Winchester and insensitivity sometimes went together like nature's peanut butter and jelly. It was how he often distracted himself from facing the true emotions he knew he should feel, and right now...
“See you around, Sam.”
Dean was slightly more difficult, and only a lifetime of reading his brother’s emotions allowed him to fully translate his big brother’s thought process. After all, almost three decades with John Winchester as their father had certainly left its mark. Their dad wasn’t actively hateful to those in same sex relationships, but he had certainly made the occasional off-hand remark that had likely stuck with Dean, the one who had always strove to be the pinnacle of manliness, seducing ladies left right and centre.
Please, no.
Gabriel drops himself down onto the bed next to Sam, shaking his head slowly, before he manages to sum the whole shitshow of a situation up in three simple words that Sam couldn’t agree more with.
- had meant to him, and the hunter had not said a thing in reply. Before he could even comprehend those last three words, the ones he had never thought he deserved to hear, and certainly didn't think he
“Nah, I’m just messing with ya, I’m sure I can find a different trashy diner,” He reassured, winking at Sam cheerfully and, before Sam could even comment on this plan, his hand was raised and his fingers snapped, teleporting them with no further preamble.
And this thought stole the very breath from Sam’s lungs briefly.
“You can’t? What do you mean you can’t? You’re
He had come to terms, somewhat, with his death. It was hardly the first time he had lost Dean, of course, but this was the first time he had forced himself to accept that it was permanent, that he wasn’t coming back. And he had tried to be okay with that, okay with the thought of Dean finally being at peace and reunited with his loved ones up in Heaven, but…it didn’t change the fact Sam was left behind on Earth, all alone. Didn’t change the fact that everyone Sam loved – Dean, Jack, probably Cas, Charlie, Bobby, everyone else – were all having a party upstairs while Sam was locked in the basement, so to speak. He knew that they would all want him to live on, to have the normal life that he had craved for so long, but by this point that was a little easier said than done. He hadn’t done the whole ‘normal’ thing since he was twenty-two, for the most part. But he had been trying, anyway. For them.
This…This wasn’t right. Dean was dead and gone and had been for several months now. He had been around fourty when he had died, and yet the man sat opposite Sam was clearly no older than twenty-nine, if Sam remembered right. And this motel room, and the music, and the accursed time loop…that had ended well over a decade ago. The Trickster – Gabriel – was long dead, as well. Factually dead, this time, no lies involved. Michael had made sure of that much.
It was stated as a fact, and Sam knew it was one. Dean had loved Jack, in the end, in his own way. Neither of them knew the first thing about being a parent – it wasn’t like they had very great references to go off of, after all. But Sam knew his brother, and he knew to ignore Dean’s seemingly gruff exterior toward Jack; he was Dean’s son as much as any of them.
“So…they’re together?” He asked, hopeful, and Jack responding smile was almost shyly.
it, through actions and through lighthearted teasing and nicknames. His heart clenched with a longing that he firmly shut down as he thought of what exactly he could have done to
“To put it bluntly…it won’t matter because that version of events, our version…it won’t exist anymore,” He said carefully, and Sam’s blood turned to ice.
love you. If I did this, If I…I couldn’t live with myself. Cas would never forgive me.”
“No, Jack wouldn’t. He’s family. There’s no reason, for one. And besides, he swore a non-interference policy when he became God, and I think sending me a decade into my own past is probably breaking that big time. This isn’t him.”
“Rise and shine, Sammy!” His very-much-alive (not to mention ten years younger) brother called brightly, foot propped up as he tied his laces, easy grin on his face in a way that was so familiar even now that it made Sam’s heart ache. His eyes were expectant as he stared at his younger brother, and still all Sam could think was,
He dusted his jacket off, ran a hand through his admittedly unruly hair, and looked at Gabriel expectantly.
“Surprised…? What’re you-“
It was Jack who ended the hug this time, drawing away and taking a few steps back. He blinked deeply, eyes suspiciously red, before he shot an attempt at a smile at Sam.
His eyes do seem somewhat overwhelmed now, and he jumps to his feet and begins pacing back and forward, deep in thought. It’s such a human thing to do that Sam almost laughs. He’d grown used to Cas gradually becoming more like a human as he spent time with them, but Gabriel…he had truly acclimatised with humanity. He could be mistaken for one of them so easily, in the way his brow furrowed slightly and the way he stubbed his toe off the desk and cursed absently, rubbing it, and even in the way he reached into his pocket and pulled out a lollipop, sticking it in his mouth thoughtfully. Sam didn’t dare interrupt this process, until Gabriel finally looked back at him.
He took a step closer to Sam. In the background, the four of them in the memory continued on in their scene of domestic bliss.
Jack. I can’t let this happen.”
A new warmth bloomed in Sam’s heart, and he felt a sudden weight lifted from his chest that he hadn’t even entirely realised was there.
Sam sits up straighter.
“It’s not flattery,” Sam interjects once more, “It’s fact. You…are an angel. An archangel, to be precise. The archangel Gabriel.”
But Sam trailed off, eyes widening as he realised all of a sudden.
He couldn’t. He loved the hell out of that kid. He would die for him, he would kill for him, a million times over, no hesitation.
“It’s…hard to explain,” The boy admitted, “But I’ll try.”
“So, you’ve stopped about ten different apocalypses in as many years. I’m dead now, your brother is also dead,
“No,” Sam said automatically, the beginnings of panic gnawing at him subconsciously, “No, this is wrong. You saved the whole damn world, Jack! You- you don’t deserve this! No!”
“Should have known things couldn’t be that easy,” He said dryly, folding his arms and resuming his distracted drumming against his forearm, “So what have you told your brother, anyhow?”
Sam felt a wave of shock wash over him as the blanketing blackness of his dream slowly shifted to reveal the form, jaw dropping despite himself.
He had really missed his brother.
“We don’t
“Well, maybe not
Here, he faltered slightly, swallowing briefly.
Apologies for the long delay! December-January was a super busy season for me, I was pretty much working full time hours while still trying to sit my exams and get through uni.
“I did say that,” He acknowledged, “And I meant it for everyone, including all of you. But…”
Sam blinked, taken aback, and Gabriel was quick to elaborate.
He shook his head to derail this line of thought – it wouldn’t do any good anyways, not right now.
It was a scene that Sam longed, more than anything, to get back. And he knew that he couldn’t.
“I guess,” He acknowledged, smile slightly awkward and yet, surprising himself, sincere. Maybe because, for the first time in so long, he felt the slightest spark of hope deep down in his gut once again. Hope for the world, hope for change, for his family to pull through this less scathed than they had originally.
Sam frowned.
“Yeah, they are. There’s angels, and there’s archangels, and you’re one of them. You, Michael, Raphael and…” His voice pauses for a second before finishing, slightly quieter, “…and Lucifer.”
his bed back at the bunker. His ears throbbed from the loud music assaulting them first thing in the morning, and as he turned to glare at the offending object that it originated from his eyes landed on the figure sat a few feet away from him and all he could think was, “Oh.”
“Okay, but…even if I did change things, did he really think I wouldn’t try and bring him down a second time? Because I would.”
He was a trouble magnet, who, if he could not
brothers are also all dead, and so is my father – You know, God himself - who has been replaced by my nephilm nephew; A nephew who was raised by my baby brother, who was a little in love with your brother,” He summarises, blinking slowly.
And always will.
Gabriel shook his head slowly again, and now Sam could clearly read the look he shot him. It was clouded with suspicion, and maybe the tiniest bit of pity that he was trying not to let show.
“And yet now you’re here, claiming you have no idea how this has come about, but armed with enough knowledge to stop literally all of this from even occurring in the first place?”
“No you’re not,” Sam interrupts, ignoring the instinctive bristling inside at the comment about Dean, “You’re an angel.”
“Meaning?” He enquires, voice marginally sharper, and Sam sighs, gesturing to the identical bed next to him.
“Hungry, are we, Sammy?”
the sexual tension between the two of them that had existed for…well, as long as Sam could remember, if he was honest.
“You are to me,” Sam blurted, “Jack, this…this is insane! I can’t do this. Jack, you…you’re…You’re our
“Dean? I haven’t told him anything,” He said. Gabriel looked at him somewhat dubiously.
And as the door creaked open as he slowly pushed it, he allowed himself just one more final moment before he would have to derail his thought process firmly and face his brother.
Still, he finally made himself release the younger man, looking down at him somewhat incredulously.
And faster than he can blink, Sam finds himself in an unfamiliar motel room, perched on the edge of a bed while Gabriel stands in front of him.
He swallowed at the thought, and Sam could tell despite his confident, selfless front that he was genuinely scared of this possibility. And yet he would still do it.
“New God, remember?” He reminded, “I’m able to do a lot of things.”
He did know. It might have been over a decade, but he did still remember the whole point behind Gabriel’s trapping him in a time loop for around a year. Pissed off as he may have been with the Trickster in the aftermath, he didn’t forget the lesson he had been trying to teach, even if he had elected to ignore it.
“…Well,” Gabriel finally says when Sam has fell silent for longer than a minute, “That is quite the bombshell to drop on a fella, Samsquach.”
little diner, think they have a special on pig’n’poke today, you’ll love it!”
“I might be born…and I might not. But you…you need to focus on other things. I’m not a priority, Sam. Not compared to everything you stand to gain.”
that he cared, he
Sam gently clapped Jack on the shoulder, jolting the young man into looking back up at him with wide eyes, peering through his eyelashes.
Now, his face
“Hello, Sam,” Castiel greeted.
Gabriel hums his acknowledgement.
But Sam wasn’t listening to him. Nor was he focused on the faintest hint of concern lurking in Gabriel’s voice.
“Nicknames already, eh Sammy? Aren’t we getting intimate,” He teases, and Sam rolls his eyes, well used to his taunts and flirts after so long knowing him.
Jack flinched again, looking at his feet.
It was a dangerous promise to make, and they both knew it. But Jack simply acquiesced with a quiet, subdued, “Okay.”
To his credit, Gabriel does not interrupt once in the whole hour Sam is speaking. In fact he thinks it’s the longest he has seen Gabriel be silent, aside from the aftermath of his rescue from Asmodeus. Even when he is explaining the angel’s first (fake) death, and later capture and torture, Gabriel hardly reacts, gaze hard and thoughtful and eyes growing more and more distant as the story went on.
Sam stared at Jack, dread churning in his stomach, silently urging him to continue speaking. Looking up at Sam with the barest hint of anxiety, he did so.
“I know what you are.”
Sam suddenly felt a slight lump in the back of his throat which he firmly attempted to swallow down.
He knows he will see it, but it is still somewhat jarring to whirl around on the spot and come face to face with Gabriel once again. He looks the same as he ever did, golden hair in short messy waves, greenish eyes gleaming with mischief and the barest hint of ‘I-know-more-than-you-ever-will’, eyebrow quirked lightly and small smirk playing about his lips. His arms were folded leisurely, fingers drumming on his forearm in a pattern that Sam recognised as the opening notes to Heat of the Moment. Sam still despised that song, make no mistake. In fact after the whole mystery spot chaos the first time around, he had thrown Dean’s copy of the tape out the window of the moving impala whilst on the freeway, taking great satisfaction in watching it get crushed beneath the wheels of a semi. And Gabriel, sly, vindictive bastard that he was at this point, probably knew fine well how Sam felt about the song. Only the knowledge of the future, and the fact that Gabriel would help them out, become their friend and ultimately go on to die for them, stopped him from decking the angel for that one.
Sam swallowed, hating how predictable he was to the accursed ex-God. But then, who could blame him? Wouldn’t anyone do the same, if given the chance? If you dropped someone back a decade into their past and told them “Okay, you can either relive all of your suffering completely a second time, even though the first time literally killed you a few times, OR, you can try and change things for the better for you and for your loved ones.” Would anyone be able to resist that urge, really?
He ran a hand through his hair, distressed. Gabriel stared at him for a moment, and then a moment longer. He kept staring for so long, in fact, that it made the back of Sam’s neck heat up slightly from the intensity of it, and the Winchester cleared his throat pointedly.
Oh no.
,” He agreed, “But, he…well, he was God, too, remember. He could foresee things…to an extent. So, I think…I think when it became clear we were going to beat him, he…created a back up option, so to speak.”
“Sorry, it’s…habit,” He justifies, waving a hand dismissively. Gabriel’s brows furrow and his head tilts slightly in confusion, and Sam is struck by the strongest feeling of déjà vu because right now he looks exactly as he did in that warehouse all those years ago, the first time he and Dean had uncovered his identity – equal parts keenly intrigued, puzzled and furiously rebellious.
Cas how exactly he felt. Anything, to tell the angel something he did not already know.
It wasn’t really phrased as a question, but it was one anyway, and Gabriel indulged him with an answer.
The years had mellowed Sam enough that he was willing to accept this fact, nodding grudgingly to indicate this.
Despite the somewhat tense atmosphere, Gabriel can’t seem to resist a slight grin.
He whirred round to look at Gabriel again.
The young man’s face lit up, bringing a warmth into Sam’s chest as his smile always did. Jack was good for things like that; his youthful innocence about the world had always been good at keeping Sam’s hope intact, and Sam hadn’t realised just how much he had missed the kid until right now.
Dean did not feel anything for him beyond appreciation as a friend.
“Okay,” The angel concedes irritably, “I think you and I gotta have a conversation, kiddo.”
“So…what now?”
“You think I done this on purpose,” He deduced, “To save my brother.”
Jack put a hand over his mouth, and grinned at him.
Sam stopped, looking at Gabriel in mild surprise.
The sound hit his ears first. The loud chatter of four people all trying to talk over one another, all laughing in the process. He heard his own voice briefly, before he seemed to give up even trying. He heard Jack, too, try and talk before he dissolved into laughter as he watched the final two voices of Dean and Castiel bicker passionately like the old married couple everyone knew they were.
A chance to be together, his mind added. But he didn’t say this out loud. Just like how Dean had never admitted how he felt for Cas out loud either. But then, he didn’t really need to. Sam knew his brother well enough to just be able to tell. And even if he didn’t, well…he didn’t actually really
“Sam!” He cried brightly, darting forward without hesitation and throwing his arms around the older man, “I found you!”
But here's the second chapter, longer as promised. I know! I love Jack! But I just can't see Sam allowing events to play out in the exact same way with Lucifer, creating Jack. That doesn't mean he doesn't have a CHANCE of survival; it just doesn't seem very high at the moment. Jack is still my sweet baby boy and I adore him! And we know who is responsible for Sam's being sent back now; dang it, Chuck.
“You were my family,” Jack spoke up, unexpectedly, voice holding the barest ghost of wistfulness, “All of you. You taught me the meaning of family, of having a home, of how to care for people and get care in return. I loved all of you, with everything I am.”
But it was impossible. They kept playing like a broken record, looping over and over. Every micro-expression on Cas' face in that moment was ingrained in his mind; resignation, a brief half-smile, tearful eyes, a broken sort of fondness and a look that was
“He set things up so that, in the weeks following his defeat, you would eventually be sent back in time, using enough power that I…I can’t reverse it. I think he was banking on two things – first, the fact that he wouldn’t be around to bring you back. And second, the fact that you wouldn’t be able to resist changing things if you had to live through them a second time.”
He could say that he had spent years trying to decide how to describe the exact shade of blue that Cas' eyes were, had fallen asleep at night visualising them. He could say that sometimes the intensity of Cas' gaze could send a full body shiver up Dean's spine, a spine that had stood solid and stoic in the presence of demons, hellhounds and the worst the world had to offer. He could say that on the rare occasions the two of them touched, whether in one of their few and far between hugs or in a casual brush of arms, he had often had to clench his jaw and force himself not to feel
watching him in the time loop, a fact that the archangel himself had confirmed later on, when they had become tentative allies and even more tentative friends. He also knows that he could probably be yelling the Trickster’s true angelic name to get his attention, but that could have the opposite effect. He knew that would have a decent chance of sending Gabriel running for the hills, and Sam really needed him to stick around right now.
Dean didn't know. And he wouldn't know. Cas was gone, and he would never give an answer to these questions. He would never be able to hear Dean's response to his final words.
and Dean should be furious, or devastated, and he should scream and shout and hit something or do
“Well, fuck me.”

“Yeah, but you said you weren’t interfering, and…anyway, I don’t even know why I’m here.”
…But there were so many others he loved, too.
of it, but pretty much, yeah.”
under positive attention and affection, and the three of them had (most of the time) been happy to provide this for him. And, rather quickly, he had become just as touchy with them, often grabbing their arms and tugging their sleeves in a very toddler-like manner to attract their attention or leaning against whoever was in the back of the impala with him and, eventually, hugging them happily after any successful hunts. Sam was hardly anti-hug; he embraced those close to him plenty. But Dean wasn’t always the most touchy feely of people, and nor was Cas at the best of times, so fairly quickly Sam could say with reasonable certainty that he had probably hugged Jack more than the other two combined.
“Right,” He said, voice practically dripping scepticism, and Sam couldn’t help the scowl that formed on his face.
“It…well…”
But Dean loved Castiel. There was no way to deny that. If he hadn’t been one hundred percent sold before, then Castiel’s confession before vanishing had certainly sold him. Dean was more shaken up than Sam had seen him in years, his face pale and gaunt and eyes holding a look that Sam would only later be able to label as heartbroken. His loss had broken his brother for a time, and privately Sam wondered if that was part of the reason he had been so ready to accept death when it had come knocking on his door.
His eyes flew open with a startled gasp, brain immediately registering the fact that the uncomfortable surface he was lying on was
“I don’t know,” He admitted reluctantly, “I don’t even know how I was sent here, never mind
He remembered the series of events where Balthazar had, using time travel, prevented the titanic from sinking, altering the entire course of the future in unprecedented ways. Their version of reality had ceased to exist, as had their memories of it, until everything had been returned to normality. And it was then that he realised, with a sinking feeling in his gut (not unlike the titanic), just what the consequences would be if he tried to change the events of the future. He could risk robbing Dean and Cas of this happily ever after, risk ruining the future completely, worse than it already was.
Jack…he was so important to everyone in the bunker. He was their sunshine on the rainy day that was their lives, their reason to smile, their reason to keep caring for other people. He gave them a sense of responsibility, and he made them all better people. Without him, Castiel would never grow to become a wonderful, loving father, becoming ever more human in these oh so natural nurturing emotions. Jack had brought them all closer, made them all a family in a way that they…well, they already had been. But Jack had just brought them seamlessly together. He just fit. He had taken all the preconceptions about him – that he would be evil, be Lucifer’s perfect spawn, and had broken, bent and shattered them into a million pieces by being the exact opposite. Imagining life without Jack…
“I wanted things to stay like that forever,” Jack continued, “I wanted to keep learning from you, and keep discovering what it means to be human. But…our family doesn’t get forever. We never have.”
His firm – albeit somewhat dramatic – words were somewhat undercut by the sudden rumbling of his stomach. Despite himself, Gabriel cracked a grin.
to say any of that. Cas would already have known it. The damn guy knew Dean better than anybody, sometimes even better than Sam, sometimes even better than Dean knew himself. He would know all of that, without Dean having to say a word. That's how their relationship (a deep, agonising ache resonated in his heart at the use of this word, and he firmly shut down the line of thought that whispered of what could have been) had always worked, in the end. So what could he say that Cas
“You’ll see,” He promised. His hand moved to Sam’s forehead, two fingers resting against it, as if going to wake him. He met Sam’s eyes one last time – maybe the final time.
“I should let you go. I think you’ve freaked Uncle Gabriel out enough,” He joked half heartedly. Sam nearly smiled, even as he fought back tears of his own.
And finally, he reaches the end. He wraps it all up in the messy bow that is his life now – Jack is God, Cas is gone, Dean is dead, and Sam is here, ten or so years in the past, surrounded by people who should rightfully be dead as well right now.
“Oh, and, when you wake up…well. I’ll let you be surprised.”
His nose wrinkles slightly.
“Sam…I…I’m sorry, but…I can’t,” He confessed, voice a shameful near whisper. Sam blinked once. And then again.
“No. I’ve had my time with Dean, maybe not as much as I’d like, but enough that I could accept it. But that was before I came here. Now I’m here, with so much still to happen, and I just…I would be an idiot to not try and fix all the mistakes I know we’ll make.”
