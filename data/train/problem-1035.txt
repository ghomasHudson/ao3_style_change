“You and your obsession with my unsolved cases!” Sherlock cried. He shook his head, agitation only increasing. He had to think, think,
“This must seem strange to you Doctor,” the Colonel said, embarrassed himself for having to be involved in the invasion of a stranger’s home. “I’m the magistrate for a county not far from here, and these are Monsieurs Watson, who you may have heard of recently in the papers.”
He normally enjoyed this part more with Watson in the dark, as it allowed him to demonstrate his talents to a praising audience. However, now that Sherlock had told him ahead of time what to expect, Watson shot him a knowing, mischievous look. Sherlock found he liked that quite a bit more.
Beaming at him over breakfast after a comment about slavery was something he was fairly sure was a bit not good - the sort of thing he would normally be chastised for. He felt strongly that Watson was less like other people than he let on.
They stood there, facing one another outside the door of her room. He couldn’t look away from Moriarty. He couldn’t tell if there was true hatred there, or if he was just a plaything to the man. Someone’s vulnerabilities to expose, and to press into, just to watch the bruise form.
Unlike the other bots, Anderson was flashing an amber alert, making it easier to find. Otherwise, the bot looked no worse for wear. Anderson had still been able to return to the dock, despite its dysfunction.
The staff’s attention was somewhat divided due to other guests departing the hotel at the same time, which Sebastian was of course being abominable about. An older couple specifically, who actually needed the aid of other personnel in loading their belongings, were waiting for the return of their stolen assistance. The couple however appeared largely unfazed by Wilkes borrowing their help. Perhaps they were actually relieved -- he realized that the wife was staying behind for a few extra days, and they were happy to have a few more moments with each other to speak parting words.
Consumption of adult beverages led to a rousing game of Cards Against Humanity, which led to a great deal of ribald mirth, which led to increased imbibing of said adult beverages, which led to more ribald mirth, which led to a bawdy game of Never Have I Ever, which led to revelations that might otherwise have remained undisclosed forever.
“Right. Well, you know you can rent boats at some of those campgrounds, right? This was one of those, so we did and we rowed out on the loch. It was a warm afternoon. Really still water. That last gasp of summer weather before it turns shitty, you know? So we stowed the oars and we just lay there, soaking up the sun, bobbing gently, drifting a little. Lazy and relaxed like neither of us had felt in months.”
Satisfied, John continued. “We decided to take a couple of nights’ holiday to the Highlands to go camping at one of the lochs. We were both done with Friday classes by 10:00, so...” He finished off his beer before going on because damned if he was going to tell this tale without getting at least little more pissed. Greg silently opened another and handed it to him in a sign of empathy. “Ta. There weren’t a lot of folks about since schools were back in session and like I said it was a Friday.”
Sherlock’s grey eyes went wicked, gaze never leaving John’s face. His expression all but spoke aloud, Two can play at this game. “That can be arranged.”
“I am.” Molly took a swallow of her wine and faced her boyfriend’s shocked expression. “It was just overnight and it’s not like I was experimenting on them like someone we all know.”
Far far away from London in a room in Sherrinford, there sounds a Chorus of “MISS ME” ... Hundreds of Moriarty says together in their machinery voice... And in front of them, a lady was standing in a white dress... Eurus Holmes turns around and smiles...
Sherlock said, "Ok the gun has silencer in it, so that makes its barrel really long, so to shoot from that long, the man has to pull his arm in a very high angle, and according to his sitting position, he has a bone problem, so it's not possible for him to do that to himself, so he didn't kill himself, so now who from the other 2 killed him, John any insight. " John says, "Look at the man's lips Sherlock, it's purple, like an effect of poison, but poison only make the lips purple, if the man was still alive, means he was poisoned before he was shot, " Sherlock said, "Excellent  John, that means his daughter-in-law killed him by poisoning him, cause his son had the license for the gun, and he had a plan to kill him using the gun, so he won't poison him, so first, his daughter-in-law poisoned him, and he was killed by that, then his son shot him, to confirm his death. That's it, and we solved it, now let them go, you promised."
John says, “Sherlock you have already destroyed my life, My wife died saving you, Moriarty came into my life because of you, every day I and the people I love are in danger Because of your presence in my life, Being with you was the worst mistake, and that has already destroyed my life, there is nothing left, so get it done, Shoot me”
---------------Sherlock goes up to Rosie’s crib, pick her up, and kisses on her forehead and Rosie sits on his lap playing with his white Santa beard, while John opens the presents, one by one… After sometimes playing with her, Sherlock puts her back in her crib, with the toys that he had brought for her… John holds his hand, and pulls him to their bedroom… he pulls out Santa Beard and Mustache from Sherlock’s face, and it was his Sherlock on a Red dress With Red Christmas hat on… he was looking so cute on these… John just gave him a long kiss and a tight hug, and holding his hands, he said Thank you my secrete Santa for making the Christmas so special for us.
Sherlock exclaims, "Hey, I am happy. You don’t have to try to make me happy, I am happy, remember, I said we are getting married, I proposed John and he said YES to me, we are going to be husbands from this day until my last day, we are getting married this evening, I have never been this happy in my entire life, thanks to the fact that I am dying everybody is listening to me. Everything is happening as I want, I feel like the king of the World.
Suddenly John snatches the gun from Sherlock's hand and points it at Moriarty and screams in the loudest if his voice,.. “what did you do to Rosey you Bustard..” and pulls the trigger... But nothing happens... Instead of that 2 red lasers points shows up on both of John and Sherlock’s forehead...
Baker street, Lestrade sent all the files about our 3 victims so far. I was going through the industrialist’s files. And I could see lots of forge documents, lots of convergences in the calculations. Clearly, I could tell that he has been taking a lot of money illegally from much poorer business people, and in his personal documents, I could see that many women had complained against for unconvincing behavior and molesting, and he was just not punished for of lack evidence. Sherlock was seeing the same in the file of the politician he has also taken lots of money in lots of illegal ways, and influenced many people to do a lot of illegal works and got away with all those because of his position, and the bank manager was also keeping the interests and a part of all the dealings, he was practically stealing from all the customers, from the common people.
p.s.  With Sherlock... I am also a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe... so I love post-credit scenes... so I also Kind-of tried to make a post-credit scene in the end... so enjoy till the end...
You have to..“ Sherlock says, “that means someone locked that woman inside the bathroom, and she was trying to get out by breaking the window of the bathroom. But because of her height, she was unable to reach the window, so she got up on the edge of the bathtub and was trying to break the glass of the window, but she slipped and her head hit the edge of the bathtub, and she became senseless, blood started coming out, and her hand somehow turned on the knob so the water started filling up, and there was no one to stop that and she was senseless, so she died, it was an accident...” Moriarty said, “you are Impressive indeed... But as I promised I'll let one of them go.. So, who do you choose.” Sherlock in his Ice cold voice said, “I choose Molly, Let her go.” And a door slides open and Rossy with her chair was pulled inside from that door into another room.
John came within 10 minutes, he also said, I have 2 news guys, the good news is Sherlock and I are getting married. And the bad news is Sherlock is dying, And I know this, maybe you guys also know and was instructed not to tell me… but please guys don’t try to convince me that it’s not happening, remember I am a doctor, and I live with Sherlock. Off course I noticed the symptoms and then run some tests secretly and I know it’s happening, I was about to tell Sherlock, about to tell you guys, but I saw it in Sherlock’s eyes, an unspoken sadness, a different kind of passion when he is with me. I figured he already knew and he doesn’t want me to know and he wants to spend his last days with me happily, he wants to make every day special and all we can do is make him the happiest… So I decided that I am gonna be strong, I am not gonna let him know that I know, I am gonna let everything happen exactly as he wants, so I think you understand how important every single second is. We are getting married this evening, you guys have to arrange everything and this has to be the most special and the most beautiful day. Now I am gonna go and work on my vows … bye-bye… best of luck guys, start working…"
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
So it's a new beginning, with new mysteries to solve, but some old problems are still lingering around them.
The other Sherlock with Moriarty was shocked and ashamed by seeing that their hostage was not there anymore... He said ... “I am sorry sir, I have failed you.” .. Moriarty answers.... “well you did... But Sherlock didn't... He didn't disappoint me... This was exactly what I expected from him..”
It’s a beautiful evening of Christmas. Christmas in London is anyway beautiful, but this time it was extra special for John & Sherlock. Mycroft used his network to close 221B Baker Street, Mrs. H. did the arrangement of foods and for the guests inside Speedy’s Cafe... Lestrade decorated the entire street with Christmas Lights and Christmas trees the snowfall made it extra beautiful, feels like the stars are falling from the sky for the most special Lovers to be together… John was ready in his room, and Sherlock was in his, Molly prepared Sherlock mentally for this moment by always being there for him, and taking care of every little detail… She also found out the children of Sherlock’s “Holmes’s network” and arranged a beautiful musical piece with them for this evening… Mrs. H. came and took Rosy in her crib, and hold Dr. Watson’s arm, and walk him down to the aisle and Molly took Sherlock’s hand and walk him down to the aisle. They both stood their together said each other's vows. Mycroft handed Sherlock the ring and he puts it on John’s finger and Lestrade handed John the ring and he puts it in Sherlock’s finger… they Kisses… they got married… The children of “Holmes’s network” were playing the beautiful musical piece that they prepared and the happy couple was dancing… tears were feeling in Molly, Lestrade, Mrs. H., and Mycroft’s eyes… But John and Sherlock were so happy, they couldn’t stop smiling, they couldn’t take their eyes off each other… they were the happiest persons alive….
John says, "YES... YES… Yes…  a million times YES… Of course, you will be my husband… it’s always a YES… "
He could feel something important was in that room, so he decided to go inside that room anyhow, he was ready to fight with the guards, but surprising him the guards didn't stop him. He figured out this is because the machine version of him was allowed to enter this room and the guards had mistaken the real Sherlock as the machine Sherlock and let him enter the room. Sherlock entered the room and he was Stunned by seeing John lying inside that room almost unconscious and bleeding from everywhere. He was trembling in pain, Sherlock ran towards John and held him in his arms.
5 months have passed... A lot of things happened in the last 5 months... Things got complicated... they got resolved... some Mystery got solved... others appeared in new forms...
Lestrade comes in with 3 photos, He said, “Well you are wrong this time it’s 3 different people, see it’s 3 different photos of 3 different people.” He put the 3 photos on a table one beside the other, the photos were labeled as, “House cook”, “Chef” and “Electrician”.
Sherlock was completely shocked... But he figured out that, if follows the other version of himself it might get him to John. The other version of him and Moriarty was still talking... The other Sherlock said..... “Sir, should we start the next phase?”.... Moriarty replied... “Our guest would give us the signal for that. .... Speaking of which we should check on his status..” They start coming towards the door... To hide himself Sherlock enters another room. Moriarty and the other Sherlock comes out of that room and goes to the room where Sherlock was kept before...
“Great. Now my girlfriend is conspiring with Sherlock Holmes. All right.” Greg swigged back a healthy swallow of beer. “I’m running low on ideas. Erm... I dunno. Never have I ever...had sex in an open boat.”
“It was while I was at med school in Edinburgh. A friend and I— I’m not naming names, so just stop right there.” John pointed at Sophie forcefully. Sophie mimed locking her lips and throwing away the key, then settled back in her listening position, smirking.
“My turn,” said Oscar. He thought for a moment, trying to come up with something that would catch at least one person out. “Never have I ever...stored human body parts in my home refrigerator.” He looked around at the others, taking an extra moment to focus on Sherlock. To his delight, Sherlock was forced to drink.
John faced down Sophie’s eager gaze. “You’re cut off. That’s all you get.” Then he rounded on his partner. “You...” He paused, and then grinned. He couldn’t help it. The story was out now and he couldn’t take it back, so he might as well ride the wave of friendly ridicule to its inevitable conclusion. In which case, he was taking a prisoner down with him. “I’ll fill you in later with comprehensive, graphic examples.”
“You still did it,” Sophie said. “And I can’t tell you how sad I am that I wasn’t there to witness it.”
Hesitantly, and with a pained and self-conscious expression on his face, John raised his bottle and drank. Naturally, all other eyes turned to Sherlock, whose own remained trained on his partner. He didn’t drink.
With their trembling foot-steps, they enter a room, the room's walls were decorated with blood-red spots, and there was a giant screen. They enter the room, started looking around.
Everett Ross woke up in the morning, naked next to naked Stephen strange… his mind was still in the beautiful dream that he saw last night… suddenly he comes up to his senses and asks, “Strange, what happened last night?? What exactly did we do??...”
Sherlock woke up in a place full of darkness. He couldn't see a single thing. For the first time in his life... Sherlock... the consulting detective... the man who could remarkably think... felt completely blank. He didn't know where he was.. for how many days he has been unconscious.. how much drugs were injected in his body.. how many weapons were used upon him... he didn't know where to go now, or what to do... he was absolutely blank.
That stopped John’s bad film in its tracks, though only served to make him look more confused. “Sorry, not like what?”
He had arrived, and was completely out of sync with the routines of Manderley, the place almost a living, breathing entity of its own. And him going against its natural order, carelessly stumbling into the wrong rooms at the wrong times. How could one house have so many rules? And why did there need to be so many people around the place?
It was Mary, always Mary. He would never be rid of her. If she had been alive, he could have contended with her. If John had loved some other woman in London, who he stole away to and slept with, he could have at least fought for him. The woman would have weaknesses, flaws he could expose - but Mary would always be rendered eternally perfect in memory. And she was not something he could fight and win.
“That should do it!” Sherlock said. As the magic in the air receded, his hair returned to its usual place, deeply parted with his fringe across his forehead. “Now, Mrs Hudson has an entire floor to herself, and I’ve even added a guest room!”
“You—I—” John stammered, feeling entirely out of his depth. John did not have the faintest idea of what had just happened. Sherlock began to flap their hands in front of John’s face in a signal that John assumed meant to hurry up.
“Sure, yeah, but I kept reading them. You even played detective with me. You don’t remember this at all, do you?” John asked, thumb rubbing across the crease forming in his brow. Christ. Maybe he really did need to see that psychiatrist.
Sherlock lets them into the house and shuts and relocks the door, as per John’s suggestions, quickly and quietly.
Sherlock brought the scouter to an abrupt halt, causing the front of John’s helmet to smack against the left side of the scouter. John glared, but Sherlock was already exiting the vehicle, and running one of their hands across a symbol that had been carved into the blue ground.
“Will you check what that is already?” the poacher shouted, and the in-ship bot finally rolled to the shuttle’s entrance before detaching from the ship’s ceiling track, and began to roll down the hatch’s ramp on its caterpillar tracks.
“Yeah, go ahead,” John said. It was vague enough to encourage the hotline worker to leave, while still pretending they were continuing their roleplay to the man on the video call.
John still lived with the anxiety of the suicide looming around the corner, weighing on him all that night and into the next day. He had a feeling that it was all about to happen, and soon. That morning he took a stiff, brisk walk through Russell Square to get outside. Leaning heavily on his cane with each step, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was a day late.
“Look, you’re not going to like this,” Greg replied after a delay, “but the powers that be want you to stay on longer this time. The cost of sending someone back and forth is starting to add up.”
He sighed, aggrieved. John had already been helping before the signals had gone off, of course. John wasn’t even
“We’ll have to walk from here,” John said, unlacing the boots. Fog passed by the castle, obscuring it from their view, but it was no matter as the living scarecrow was on its way over to them at a quick hop. John, the Witch, and the dog met it halfway, and the scarecrow led them back through the mist.
Sherlock could not have been more changed from the awkward young man John had seen something in months ago in a Monte Carlo hotel drawing room - he was now by far the flashier of the two of them. Overlooking John was foolish, of course, but of benefit to them for the present. John seemed to delight in it, thinking the attention was now rightfully focussed on Sherlock. John was of course wrong in this, but whatever helped keep them from attention, and John by his side. And so, they became Holmes and Watson, husbands in crime solving.
He couldn’t help but raise his brows at this - not only was this not something polite people mentioned, Magnussen had not once touched his tea.
“Sounds like I’d better see him then,” he said turning to Lestrade with a false smile. Lestrade appeared to be vaguely worried, but also as if he wasn’t entirely sure why he should be.
He doesn’t elaborate further. John assumes Sherlock falls asleep, but his breathing never quite evens out.
“You’re all about the details, but not the ones that matter. I think it’s a wonderful idea, and you could even make it a period ball officially. Have a theme. That way everyone is in keeping with the general style. No one wants to see a clown dancing with a lady in powder. Besides, they’re more like distant relations.”
“That won’t worsen, I can guarantee. In fact, I plan to no longer partake. It’s behind me and for good this time. I have the real thing now,” he said, with the impression that he was repeating himself.
Their eyes locked. He could not recall a time they had discussed the players in a case with as much gravity or personal investment. “Does she? Regret the marriage?”
It would be quite the thing if the Sherlock Holmes novel he couldn’t part with had saved him after all, perhaps shifting up in his pocket at just the right moment. John might just have to start believing in an author-god. In any event, John bet there was quite an impressive hole through it that he’d like to see.
“You said you wanted to make a mess of me,” Sherlock said simply, as the shirt was removed to reveal even more of that pale,
“Hmm, are any of them poisonous?” he asked rhetorically, letting the matter of this ‘Moriarty’ drop. He supposed he’d meet the man shortly.
“And not just poisoned once,” he continued, voice growing stronger, “but many times, enough that Mary would have known no antidote could help her. Without the body I have no way of knowing for sure, but I suspect thallium. Odourless, colourless, tasteless - could be administered to her over time without her noticing, and it can be detected in urine. If the build up had been enough, there could have been more than enough thallium in her pregnancy test sample to kill a rabbit.”
John kept trying to catch his eye from across the room. He turned to look resolutely in the other direction. John’s eyes had looked brown from far away, which was oddly disconcerting.
The urge to don his coat and follow after John came over him, but he stamped it back down. John’s trust was precious, and he would need to resist his instincts to keep it.
“It’s one page, the only thing in it,” Archie said, closing the cover to show John. “And the book’s been hand bound and everything.”
“I heard quite the story from Lestrade, and others who heard it from Kerrith. That it was Mrs Watson’s boat that was found,” Moriarty continued, speaking in a hushed tone.
“Would I?” John asked, his hand tracing a path along Sherlock’s side. “Sounds a bit like a lousy cover. I think I was just trying to sneak a peak.”
Sherlock’s gloved hands came up to touch John’s face. As Sherlock peered down at him, noses almost touching, John’s heart felt like it might beat out of his chest—until he realized Sherlock was just removing the glamour. The same tingling from earlier ran through him where Sherlock’s hands touched him, and then was gone again.
, putting Murray and everyone else in the room on edge. Murray agreed to dig into his old files, and left briefly for the other adjoining room. He returned after with a case, which he then flipped through in front them, agonizingly slowly, till he reached the date of Mary’s death.
There was a brief moment of silence on the other end of the line. “Mr Watson, would you like to approve the menu for today?”
The extra set of arms slunk back into Sherlock’s body shortly after John entered the room, but Sherlock otherwise did not stir.
“Look, gents,” cried the man currently clinging to Sherlock’s arms for dear life. “I swear I’ll give the Wiggy back his money, I swear it!”
“John,” he heard himself saying, each time they broke apart. “We can’t lose each other. We need to stay together. Just the two of us, against everyone and everything else in this damn world.”
Dr Davenshaw, who had largely been composed up until now, looks as though she is about to break down into tears, but holds herself together admirably.
He drew away from the window, pulling the curtains closed as he went, and slipped back into bed. He had no interest in getting up, getting dressed, and pretending to bustle about the house. He wanted darkness, and time to be a bit mopey.
“I’m sorry,” he blurted out, giving in within a few seconds. “Isn’t that what people say in these situations?”
When he arrived back at the flat several hours later in his more human form, his cheeks were still tinged pink.
smell? God, what did he look like right now? He swivels his eyes back to his own reflection in the glass while his hands fly to his hair, touching his curls, smoothing them down. Hair still largely in order, a few loose strands – though, why did it matter? He didn’t care what people on the tube thought of him. Or what people in general thought of him.
He had the intense desire to turn on his heel and escape this situation, but he was frozen in place. He wouldn’t run from Moriarty, and he wouldn’t show he was bothered. He watched Moriarty’s eyes, even though they were unsettling.
In silence, they both stepped out of the car. Watson wandered closer to the edge to look out over the ocean, and he followed. While he was not sure why they’d climbed so high or come to this specific spot, he was well aware that Watson was no longer smiling.
” Sherlock replied, not unlike the affirmations Sherlock had been crying out earlier. “John, really?”
In response he hummed noncommittally, and covered the turned up Queen of Spades with his own Jack of Hearts.
John yelled over the sound, grimacing with his hands firmly over his ears. “Sherlock, do you know what that’s about?”
Before he could come to a conclusion, a gloved hand grabbed at his elbow and turned him around abruptly.
That’s not it at all. A cheese is a gross mischaracterization, and as you brought it up, so is a potato. Why a potato, John? A potato and celery are of a different genus. They could never be lovers.
Returning to the library, John’s fingers had stopped their teasing against his back, and pulled away. He almost whined at the loss of contact, but John was pressing two fingers against his lips. He was told to suck, to get them nice and wet, and he did. John pulled them from his mouth shortly, and returned them to the small of his back. At last they dropped lower, and lower, until slid between his bare cheeks, slowly circling his hole.
The perfume bottles were, at the very least, out of date to his own sample collection. He went to inspect the brushes next to them, and caught sight of his own face in the glass. He looked pale and worn, and the curls of his fringe were lying flat. He hated when his hair lost its volume. He reached for a comb, before realizing what he was doing. Even though she was long gone, her presence was thick in the room, hovering over every possession. None of these things were his.
“What?” John asked, startled. “Toss all your experiments?” Some of them Sherlock had been working on since before John had even arrived, which he toiled at all day and part of the night, as far as John could tell.
“Is anything the matter, sir?” Moriarty asked, in that strange lilting voice. His Irish accent was always strongest like this, seeping through with his natural tone.
The air in John’s lungs left in one fast exhale. That certainly wasn’t a visual he would be forgetting any time soon.
He woke when he climaxed, gasping and soaked with sweat (and other emissions). He realized he’d been lying face down, and grinding himself against his bed. Oh God,
“This is a - a setup! And you’re all in on it!” David exclaimed. “Watson lets this man wander his property however he pleases, of course he wouldn’t rat him out!”
“Mary tried to kill me,” John stated, looking away for a moment, needing a moment to gather his thoughts. John’s hand, characteristic of him dealing with unpleasantness, clenched and unclenched several times.
He would prefer unknown men to be as far away from his dog as possible. Long boots, a sou’wester, dressed for the wet - a fisherman, likely. Gladstone paid him no heed, preferring to run around the strange man in circles while barking. The man didn’t seem to mind, and simply continued bending to scrape at the shingle. He would have to go down and extract Gladstone himself, it seemed.
“Tell Moriarty to call off the witch-hunt,” he said instead. “I broke the ornament in the morning-room.”
“Come to see the shipwreck, Mr Watson?” the coast guard asked, overly jovial given the circumstances.
But John didn’t see him. Or he must not have, as John drove past him with no recognition, and leaving behind only a cloud of dust. Was there anyone in the car’s passenger seat, where he had once sat? He couldn’t tell - it kept changing. Sometimes it was empty, and John was alone. Sometimes he thought he saw the translucent outline of a person - a woman.
John leaned up and kissed him once, incredibly chaste, considering their relative positions. And then, slowly, John realigned and pressed against his entrance. The pace of it would have driven any reasonable person to absolute distraction. Sherlock felt his body begin to give way, but not enough, and the discomfort of the act made itself known. John retreated, and then pushed back again. Sherlock, willing every muscle to relax, allowed himself to be breached. It was uncomfortable, at the start, but he had expected that. His senses were capable of intense focus, and when met with the reality of John being
There was eventually another period of silence, during which John was actually able to watch the film, before Sherlock spoke again.
“I told you everything. Yesterday. In the car. But when I came to see you last night, you wouldn’t even look at me.”
“I’m not interested in blackmail, as a matter of fact,” the Witch informed him. “I consider those ‘materials’ my protection, in the event that the royal family ever becomes more creative than simply banishing me to the wastes of Belgravia.”
“Pah!” In the face of Watson’s disgruntlement, he laughed, delighted. “In any case, I might suggest you not make vows to such a woman, if only for the sake of my continued existence.”
“John, I know this is tiring, but it will be so much worse in court,” Sherlock said, but he dropped the matter, realizing he was exhausting John unintentionally. He reached out across the small distance between them to touch John’s knee, and John smiled back faintly, covering his hand with his own.
Once John came to a full and complete stop, he was on his back with the wind blown right out of him. After a moment of gasping in his helmet, John tested the injury by moving his left shoulder, only to discover that it hurt,
John was rock hard in his trousers, and he didn’t even know for how long. It was making its presence known now however, pressing uncomfortably against his zip.
John always did have the most amusing expressions. Right now, he looked rather like a gaping fish left out of water.
“Why can’t it be both?” Sherlock asked, and then, rethinking his approach, leaned his face towards John while closing his eyes, knowing John would be unable to resist taking the hint. John’s hand skimmed upwards to cup the back of his neck, drawing Sherlock’s head further in for a gentle press of closed mouths. When they broke apart, Sherlock employed his next strategy. Looking at John through heavy-lidded eyes, he said, “I’ve thought of you taking me, while I’ve stretched myself. I thought of you taking me in the library, on the window seat, for everyone to hear - ”
“I know what you’re doing, and it won’t work,” he said, infusing his voice with confidence he barely felt.
The apologetic Captain and Colonel Barclay approached him, having for the most part held their tongues that morning. “I am sorry, to you and your husband,” the Captain said, repeating his sentiments from the day before with head bowed. “This is all a dreadful business.”
It was difficult for John to quickly browse websites on a laptop let alone a mobile screen, but he could gather that it was the personal blog of someone who was at the very least impersonating Sherlock Holmes, and doing an excellent job of it. Something a fan might have done—only, without the novels, there was no Sherlock Holmes to impersonate.
But when John stepped past the stoop, a door at the other side of the room swung open to reveal an older woman with a broom held aloft.
John couldn’t decide which was more cringe-worthy; his sister’s general existence, or the reply from his former semi-girlfriend on the post, which suggested that they grab a bite at the Orient Express sometime (topped off, of course, with a winking face and many kisses). Christ.
As music and dancing continued beyond their door, his tailcoat was shed, and his waistcoat opened by skilled hands. His own hands were useless, grasping at John’s epaulets and holding on for dear life.
John looked up from his game of checkers that he was currently losing against the in-ship Hudson bot. “What?”
“I’ve already told you. I could see you didn’t want me to go, or for yourself to go for that matter.” It was now his turn to shuffle his feet, and have trouble meeting John’s gaze. “Let’s have an end to this. I’m already sick to death of the subject.”
Moriarty looked over at Sherlock, innocence incarnate. “Sir, don’t you enjoy a bit of detective work? Perhaps you can help the Colonel, if given a chance to inspect the diary.”
“Mr Holmes, Dr Watson,” she says quickly, “I can’t tell you how happy I am that you didn’t write me off immediately.”
Sherlock, still leaning on John’s legs, propped themselves up on their elbow. “The best translation I can think of is  ‘mass transfer’.”
“I thought—oh, I can hardly bear to say it, the plan was so ill-thought out and speaks so poorly of me—but I thought I would see how you would react to its disappearance. But then, you never spoke of it to me. I couldn’t be sure if you had noticed, or when I should return it. I started checking the lockbox at different periods, to see if you had even looked in it, based on whether anything had been moved. I don’t know how you found me out, but I’m glad you did! It has weighed on my mind greatly. Take it back! I don’t even wish to know any more. The past is the past Michael, I swear I won’t think of it any longer.”
What, why not? John pushes himself up onto an elbow, his torso rising as the plaid throw slips down. He catches Sherlock’s glance at the scar on his shoulder. Does the celery remind you of the five a day you’re not getting?
With a healthy dose of fear, and thus a perfectly still hand, John reached out to grip Sherlock an inch above the knee. When Sherlock didn’t protest, John lowered himself to the ground. Their chairs were already practically pressed together so once he went to the floor, he was already at his final destination, kneeling between Sherlock’s thighs.
He can remember his voice with absolute clarity, how it would change volume and tone at random and sing out like a children’s rhyme. Most often with a taunting reminder to him of the late Mrs Watson.
Moriarty sighed before he shuffled down along the hallway. A strange dynamic. They didn’t sound much like friends. Moriarty’s sarcasm was too clear, much less hidden than it ever had been with him or John.
John laughed once in disbelief. “You’re saying that it was fake, for what, both of you? That she was already planning on using you cause she knew you were using her, somehow?”
This was a pleasant change of topic, thought he imagined Harry might be able to twist his answer any way she liked. “No,” he said. “We had no time, with John anxious to get home to settle his business. But I’ve ordered some new things from catalogues.”
John walked through the opened living room door of 221B for the first time with a pack of biscuits in each hand. When Sherlock’s eyes lighted on John’s haul, his expression seemed unable to settle on surprise or bemusement.
The events of the evening? As there were no thoughts in his head beyond the specific business Stamford had engaged him for, he was unsure what Watson referred to.
“That’s all right. It’s...er, close enough,” John said, before furrowing his brow. Why was he placating an alien?
He had once been mistaken for Sebastian’s friend, which had been an embarrassment for them both. Wilkes had since learned the art of communicating his companion wasn’t to be thought of at all. Which is why it was particularly surprising that Watson continued to stand, and for him to take it upon himself to signal the waiter instead.
His melting process was well underway; he was almost completely fluid in John’s arms. Except, he at once remembered –
Magnussen stepped closer to him. Sherlock could feel his breath against his cheek. It was fresh, but acrid all the same.
They shared a smile, which was soon rudely interrupted by their arrival at the Orient Express. A chinese restaurant, which, in John’s view, was nice enough to border the perilous edge of date venue territory.
He supposed the ‘whole story’ was the circumstances surrounding John’s wife’s death. He wondered how Harry would react if he said John had provided no details around the events of the preceding year. That John kept these things to himself, and that he had questioned John on the subject never. He knew nothing beyond that there had been a sailing accident in the bay, and he had learned that from a paper.
It’s more direct than they’re used to being. It’s funny. Sherlock can talk at length when he has the right audience, loves those, but he can get shy sometimes. No one would ever think him shy, except when it’s just the two of them. With John, he is.
“There is no public path that goes to that cove,” John confirmed. His grip on his cane was tight, considering he no longer needed it.
Sherlock had also fashioned themselves a scarf, tearing one long strip of material from a particularly old pair of coveralls, which they used to wrap around their neck at most times. John couldn’t decide if this was born out of necessity to prevent a cold neck, or if Sherlock was trying to add fashionable flair to the drab outfit with the material they had available to them.
Their tone was angry, but the part of their face that John could still see was blazing gold, glowing even in the fully lit room. John’s heart kicked to one side in his chest.
It didn’t go unnoticed by John that Sherlock completely evaded his question on their digestive system. John didn’t broach the subject again, assuming that he’d never get a straight answer, but it didn’t stop him from wondering about Sherlock’s anatomy, and the obvious questions it raised.
“No, I did,” John insisted, and, wanting to return to their light mood, “I was thinking about how much of an idiot you were, getting yourself killed for no reason.”
> I meant it in a nice way. As in, I mean, you’ve already demonstrated you know how to write in things outside your own preferences. Given, you know, the other guide.
“It’s the painting,” he said, his voice hushed, smaller than he’d ever heard himself, as Lestrade guided him back up the stairs. “It’s just the painting from the gallery.”
“Okay,” John said. He laughed under his breath in disbelief. “So you made me come back here, again and again—for what? Was it funny for you, watching me have to do the same thing over and over?”
Watson was as nervous by his gesture as Sherlock had been admitting his fondness for the act, and he put Watson out of his misery as soon as he was able, by placing his hand in Watson’s palm.
After many days of being harassed by the Queen’s guard, and their less than hospitable visit to the palace, John was feeling some resentment towards those wizards and their henchmen. “I wish they were a bit closer, actually. I’m resisting the urge to throw a brick through one of the windows.”
“Because of this,” Sherlock replied, removing the case from its hiding place in his jacket, and passing it to John. John, looking quizzical, opened the clasp and sucked in a quick breath at the sight of the syringe.
“My God, really! You’ve quite outdone me for surprises! Well congratulations, and who is the oh so fortunate person?”
John drifted back into consciousness to the sounds of a cart rattling down a hall, and the quiet clicks of a bolus of medication being delivered through a syringe pump. For a moment, he assumed he’d fallen asleep on the job at the army infirmary after a night shift. That was, till he realized he was prostrate in a hospital bed.
. John had seemed angered by Moriarty when they first arrived at the house, and had been angered again over Magnussen. And yet, John put up with Moriarty’s insubordination, never terminating his late wife’s servant. John had been under Moriarty’s thumb the entire time. No wonder John had run away from Manderley. No wonder John had never wanted to come back.
He couldn’t help but think ‘no, I suppose you wouldn’t’, and realized after the fact that by accident he’d spoken the words aloud.
The man’s left hand reappeared to draw the sheet down past his right shoulder. His other hand continued to touch his nipple, now pebbled from the attention.
No, John had not said anything about being in love. Just that they needed to be married. Short and definite, very original. Original proposals were much better surely. More genuine. John was of course fond of him after they’d spent so much time together, and it was all new, and exciting. John wanted a blank slate, a way to forget the past. John needed new memories, and he would give them to him.
Sherlock’s musings on the subject ended around the time John began to laugh without breath and without pause. The furrow that formed between Sherlock’s brows made John laugh even harder, even while he attempted to get himself back under control. There were cocks out, Sherlock’s arse lubed, and John couldn’t stop giggling into Sherlock’s left pillow.
John turned his head and, once his eyes had adjusted to the dim glowing light, saw the outline of a large oblong object. John instinctively moved closer to see it better, with Sherlock close behind to light the way. He was soon able to make out the general shape of it in the dark.
John was still his same, stalwart self. John wore his lack of surprise like he’d once worn confusion. Like he had been waiting for Sherlock to get on the same page as him, and was relieved Sherlock had finally caught up.
John was ready to tear Magnussen limb from limb, but Magnussen wasn’t interested in a physical fight. In fact, he began to laugh.
If the energy had been high before, the day of the ball the house was abuzz. He didn’t sleep a wink the night before, obsessing over the miniature model that he’d brought up to their room, and occasionally looking over John’s sleeping form. His costume had arrived the day prior, and he hadn’t left John alone in the room since, not trusting him to not take a peek. John laughed and held up his hands every time he pointed his finger at him when John even so much as moved near his wardrobe. He had forced John out of the room when he’d tried it on, and Lady Irene had not been lying - the place she’d suggested had been very good.
John’s brain was terrible at the moment, lust-addled, no filter. He kept returning to the idea of Sherlock always being distant from feelings and attraction, resisting all other advances his entire life—except for when they were from
“It was all about her losing her pet, that’s why you wanted to take the case,” John concludes with confidence.
How long, exactly, did it take to get over late wives? He certainly had no idea, but apparently the association was enough to ruin the good mood. If his brother were here, he’d be sighing in exasperation and asking if he was truly this incapable of pleasant conversation.
“Promise me something though. Promise me you’ll never wear a tailored suit – well, fine, wear suits, that’s not the important bit – promise me that you’ll never grow to care for nothing in the world?”
“Um,” Archie said, tugging at John’s sleeve, and providing John with a much needed distraction. “Can you help me with something?”
“Mr Watson,” Magnussen said, speaking slow and clear, “I’ve come to congratulate you on the result of the inquest.”
Sherlock had thought he might find his own release against John’s leg, with John in his mouth, and a part of him was disappointed he hadn’t. He wiped at the side of his lips. As suspected, he’d been rather sloppy.
“Yes. Or, like I said, I can’t account for anything at all any more. It’s more than just, the flowers, I feel, oh I don’t know how to explain it,” she breaks off in frustration.
To his surprise, John’s expression fell, his face crumpling, before John pulled him close into a tight embrace. Overwhelmingly relieved, he thought of nothing else but hugging John back, and burying his face into the space between John’s head and shoulder.
“Yes John, not only did our client neglect to mention that her husband’s death had been a murder, she also forgot to mention that his killer was still at large, and that his brother had disappeared shortly thereafter. This of course made him the prime suspect in the case.  It’s simple really - the brother killed Dr Davenshaw’s husband in presumably an unplanned fit of rage. The motive for this is likely tied to their parents leaving Charles everything and his brother nothing. The brother knew there was a room in the house that Dr Davenshaw and her daughter would be unaware of. Knowing he had incriminated himself quite thoroughly, he went into hiding in the house. He knew he could enter and exit the room from the living room closet, and I suppose it worked out rather well for him.”
“You said you expect developments,” Watson explained, one eyebrow lifted. “I was wondering if you might tell me what they are before they become apparent, or if you were going to maintain your usual suspense.”
The Sherlock and Janine of his imagination were still sitting in John’s chair, hands still roaming, Sherlock’s eyes dark, like in John’s dream, pupils blown wide.
): accountant, late for work again, the sixth – no, seventh – time in the last month. This time because one of his kids was sick, previous tardiness however had all been due to meeting with sex workers at cheap motels and falling asleep by accident (amateur) –
“I’m sure whatever you’re planning is more than suitable, today and all days in the future, good day Moriarty - ” he tried to say as quickly as possible.
The clouds in front of the mountains had drifted away to reveal an eyesore on the horizon, as a long, oblong warship slowly came into view. At their current distance, the only sign of the ship moving was the waving metal flaps along its side.
“Incredible,” John said, voice high, close to laughing. When he turned, Sherlock was looking back. Sherlock made no comment, beyond a small smile peeking out at the corner of his lips.
The fire reflected in Magnussen’s glasses, but he could still see the cold smugness of his eyes behind the lenses.
“You don’t even like milk!” John called after him, but Sherlock was already across the room, coat in hand.
John is relieved when Sherlock verbalizes this for him by asking, “You never thought to question the dianthuses before?“
The second day John woke to spiders overhead, there were clothes in his size laid out at the foot of the bed, including a warm black jacket with leather detail on the shoulders. When questioned, Sherlock claimed the cost of the clothes had been covered by John’s share of the payment they’d received the day before. The clothes at least seemed to bear signs of a previous owner, so John was assured Sherlock hadn’t broken the bank for him. John didn’t know when Sherlock would have had the time to buy him clothes, but didn’t press him further.
The Hotel Cote d'Azur in Monte Carlo was the perfect choice for Wilkes’ breed, which was how they found themselves seated in its gorgeously vast and vacuously decorated dining room. This was to be Wilkes’ location of choice for celebrity spying, first and foremost, and dining second. Sitting across the table in complete and utter boredom, he watched as Sebastian spooned multiple pieces of ravioli into his actively chewing gob. Wilkes had a fondness for talking while eating, which he was demonstrating at that particular moment.
Magnussen’s eyes trailed his body, as they had on their previous encounter. “You can interest me in a great many things, Mr Watson.”
“More time is fine. It’s all fine. Assuming you don’t mind me continuing to stay here, in your bed.” John cleared his throat. “I mean, upstairs. If that’s all right.”
The man at least had good taste, Sherlock supposed. He evaluated his chances; fighting three (and a half) hardened road thieves on his own was possible, but not a guaranteed win by any means. If he had nothing of value on his person, which he was well aware he did not, it might come to that regardless.
Though it did not go past John's notice that he was alone on a planet very far from Earth and the main base, the definition of the middle of nowhere, and strange things kept happening to the routing bots.
“Hmm yeah, no," John said, a crease forming in his brow. "I really don’t. You didn’t even know what Manderley was when we first met! And I’m the person to judge whether you’d belong there. Or is that meant as an indirect refusal? You can say so, you know, this isn’t – you can say so.”
John took a fortifying breath, before deciding if he was going to be doing this, he’d be doing it right.
John obliged him, uncapping the bottle and spreading oil onto his fingers. Sherlock widened his legs further in encouragement as John got up on his knees to move between them. He couldn’t show nervousness, or John would back off once again. John rubbed his bent knee with his unlubricated hand, and Sherlock blew a hasty breath through his nose. “Please, John,” he said, sliding his feet up the bed, attempting to put himself on display.
In the land of Ingary, it was said that fortune favoured the youngest sibling, though John had never found that to be the case. Outliving his sister and parents could be considered lucky by some perhaps, but returning home to Ingary without a single living relative didn’t feel like any great fortune.
John missed quite a lot of what the man had just signed in a whirlwind of gestures, but had gotten the gist.
He felt he knew exactly what she was implying, and wasn’t sure if he should be more offended for himself or John.
John cleared his throat. Sherlock glanced at him. John’s raised brows and lowered hairline seemed to suggest that perhaps it wasn’t the right time to be asking about the rabbit.
He needn’t have worried.  When he went to check in on the other man, Wilkes was confined to his room, tucked into bed and coughing weakly. Wilkes declared that he was very unwell, and that he would be staying there for the rest of the day, possibly the week. Sebastian must have felt particularly rebuked by the ‘one good personality in Monte’ for his illness routine to make a repeat performance so soon after the one in Sommières.
“Captain Watson is my saviour of the afternoon,” Sherlock explained to Stamford once on the ground. “But don’t trouble yourself, you may still take full credit for us having been made acquainted. We wouldn’t want anyone to think we hadn’t been properly introduced by a third party.”
Sherlock paused, and then added quickly, “And, re-programming the bot routes with the shuttle’s coordinates so that they all hit the ship. Good thinking. Brilliant, even.”
David now pointed the twisted note at Sherlock, breathing hard, and looking between the both of them as if they were demons come to haunt him. Under difference circumstances, Sherlock would have clarified his nationality, but it seemed a moot point - especially with David making himself look like a lunatic in the Colonel’s eyes.
“You don’t need to know what it was about,” David protested, looking at the Colonel as if surprised he didn’t have him for an ally. “Mary made an appointment in the note, plans for after that night. She asked me to drive to Manderley because she had to tell me something. Obviously I never found out what she was going to tell me, no one can speak to that, but for her to drive holes into her boat to - to - to kill herself! God! She would never!”
“Are you going to tell me why you needed to come home with me?” John asked when they reached the back door, lifting the dog into his arms. “Or why you said Sherlock ‘needed’ you?”
she would have, I just know - she shot me. When I saw the gun, I moved to get out of the cottage, but she still got me in the shoulder. And then I - stupidly - shot back. The only difference being, my shot didn’t miss.”
A woman’s brushes, combs, and all the best scents and powders money could buy were laid out on the dressing table. A satin dressing gown was hung over the back of a chair, with a pair of slippers beneath. The bed had been made.
“I’m perfectly fine,” he insisted, averting his gaze from that terrible face. He had come here for a reason, and it wasn’t to be the prey. “Earlier on the lawn, I saw you here standing in the window, and you saw me. What were you and Magnussen doing in this room?”
He could have ridden away, if not for the rope up ahead, suspended between the thick trunks of two trees. It was almost invisible, and had been intended for him to ride off into at a mad pace, only to be knocked from his horse when he hit the line. For a moment, he considered how low he might be if he were to bend over the back of his saddle. His horse’s head would still be in the way. Damn.
Moriarty. Of course. To his dying day, he would remember that man’s face as he stood in the entranceway of the West wing. Those dead eyes were gloating, delighted with his success. Moriarty saw him in the depths of his devastation, and simply smiled.
Instead, Sherlock’s blush deepened till it matched the colour of the pink lady’s suitcase, still lying out unzipped in front of the fireplace.
The answer was shy yet sardonic, in the same way the guide had been both technical and revealing. John sank deeper.
John feels like a dam finally breaking, kissing upwards into Sherlock’s mouth just like they had the other night in the house. He licks in between his lips, a kind of kissing he had previously rarely been brave enough to try with Sherlock, and Sherlock opens his mouth with moan.
John had to move a violin from the only other spare chair to sit down, but to his shock, his bad leg had yet to protest being stood on for so long.
“And so he was, and now he’s back,” Moriarty said, annoyance slipping into his slow drawl. “If he’s gone to the library, you can go through the hall without meeting him.”
“Do you ever wonder?” Moriarty whispered. “Sometimes I do. I wonder if she comes back to Manderley. I wonder if she comes back, and watches you and Mr Watson together.”
“And a half? Six years and four months, to be exact. I came here when Mr Watson’s first spouse was a bride,” Moriarty said, and his mouth, which had previously been in a hard unmoving line, was turned up harshly at the corners, and his dull, bored voice transformed with unexpected animation.
“The war goes on whether I fight in it the way the Queen wants me to or not,” Sherlock said, almost spitting as he spoke. “They’ll drop bombs from the southern coast to the northern border whether or not I—”
Mrs Stamford’s head turned towards the door, where he and Watson still stood. “Oh, I wish this did not need to be known by anyone else! And yet, this is all my own doing.”
He throws back the old curtains hanging on the wall. Dust spills out into the air, sending him into a coughing fit, but there’s nothing behind the curtains.
Of course he was now bombarded all at once. Lady Norton even moved her chair over to him, despite her knowing this had been his idea. “Now, Mr Watson, you get on your husband. You’re the real person he will listen to! Oh, a thought - he should give the ball in your honour as the bridegroom!”
“Would you care for a drink Mr Magnussen?” Sherlock offered. “Tea? Or something a bit harder?” He crossed the room to ring the bell for the servants, not waiting for his response.
That was the first time John got that response, and it wasn’t the last. No matter who John asked on the ward, no one had seen his book and—even stranger—no one had ever heard of Sherlock Holmes. At first John wondered if he was just being overseen by a particularly illiterate staff, but he soon learned the curious lack of familiarity with the Sherlock Holmes series went far beyond the confines of the ward.
Sherlock, still a bulldog, pawed at the first step, then ran in a circle, his short legs unable to reach the top of the step. “Are you kidding me?” John asked, then sighed, and abandoned his cane to pick Sherlock up in his arms.
John blinked, at first mistrusting his eyes, but the shadow continued to grow until a black bubble had formed. As the black form grew further, it became apparent that the bubble was in fact a bulbous nose in the center of an eyeless face. With increasing alarm, John watched as the entire dark outline of a person seeped out from the crack in the wall, complete with a straw boater hat atop its head.
“I-I don't know,” he backtracked, leaning back against the window. “I suppose I don't mean anything."
Watson reminded him of a portrait he’d once seen in a gallery. It was a depiction of a Captain in action, someone who was willing to fight and die for his fellow man. He remembered the feeling of the soldier’s eyes watching him, continuing to follow him as he’d walked away.
John was shocked, he couldn't say a word, he couldn't understand why Sherlock didn't save Rossy? Sure Molly is a friend, but Sherlock let Rossy be in danger? How could he do that? How could he do that to Rossy? How could he do that to him? Sherlock took a step forward and freed Molly, a door slides open, and Molly went away from there, another door behind John slides open, and Sherlock came back grabbed John's hand and took him to the next room.
Perhaps out of always favouring his left side, John made his selection, hurrying into the building, and down its long halls. John listened for any noise, any murmur of voices. He couldn’t exactly call out to anyone.
At last, the final chapter !! A huge thanks to Anna for last minute touching up the ending coaching, and to Soli who beta'd this very long chapter even though she has an 8 hour exam on Monday.
“Oh my God,” John said, jaw dropping open for a moment. “It wasn’t the films. You always knew. You always knew what kissing meant,
John moved through each of the reactions to his stiff neck that Sherlock had just imagined. The corner of Sherlock’s mouth tipped upward.
That night he dreamt he was in the art gallery, the same one where he had seen the painting of the soldier. He dreamt that as he observed the painting, the Captain from the portrait stepped out from the frame and walked towards him with purpose. He stopped and stood at parade rest in front of him. After saluting, the Captain reached out to touch his face.
“I assume you’ve also been summoned to serve the Queen?” John asked, attempting to distract her from realizing who the dog was. “I’m surprised you’ve shown up, given your past relationship with royalty.”
He was now tired, fed up, and sour, and wouldn’t have been able conceal it for another second longer even if he had wanted to.
“I have played both sides in this war,” the Witch said, a slight tremor in her voice. “That item is my only protection while I am away from my castle. If you destroy it, I stand no chance. Henchmen from either side will find me.”
The finishing touches were the entire upper floor, bedroom and bathroom and hallway and all, coming crashing through the ceiling, and Mrs Hudson’s room behind them falling at the same time, Mrs Hudson’s yells audible from within as it dropped to the new lower floor.
“You still haven’t decided what you’re going to be wearing?” she asked when she realized. “You know, all the best places in London are going to be filled up to the brim with everyone else’s soon.”
Sherlock was able to watch John’s eyes open, bleary and confused at first, before they fell on him with recognition. John’s disorientation transforming into warmth before him was well worth it.
This at least he was able to catch a brief glimpse of, and he would have been able to recognize that suit sleeve anywhere. The arm had belonged to Moriarty.
The hazy recollection of it left him with a tight feeling in his chest. He stood from the armchair and tried to smooth out his wrinkled suit. He hadn’t intended to sleep there, or at all, yet he couldn’t help but think he’d been influenced by Moriarty’s story from yesterday. John, in his grief, sleeping upright in an armchair for days, possibly weeks. The servants whispering of it, and the whole house affected by the depth of John’s heartache.
“What will the servants think?” Sherlock murmured, lips twitching at the corners, despite the ridiculousness of what he knew John was suggesting.
“So many rhododendrons,” he said, awed by a boring houseplant transformed into something quite extraordinary.
Sherlock sighed. “They’ll only call someone else. The magistrate, or the captain of the ship that got us into this.”
He nodded. John certainly could. He was willing to agree to anything, anything at all, if it meant John continuing in that vein.
“I can’t do this,” John said, and the crease in Sherlock’s brows, the immediate and evident devastation on Sherlock’s closed-off face, was incontrovertible proof that it had been the wrong thing to say.
John turned to face him again. “Feel free to have as little contact with him as you like. I know, I know I just asked this but – again, do you like the rooms, honestly? Because things can be changed, rearranged. I know you’re particular.”
Their lips meet before he can finish and the next thing John knows he is kissing Sherlock hard and sloppy, and it’s hotter and messier than he’s ever kissed anyone in his life.
Their relationship ended with an email that started with an emoji, concluded with a string of kisses, and linked to an extensive prostate stimulation guide in the middle. Though for a few minutes John did entertain the possibility that calling things off was a hasty decision, the email did not improve upon rereading.
Sherlock slowly turns beet red, all across his face and neck, which John finds both astonishing and adorable.
Perhaps because of this chance encounter, the next time a patient was keen to gossip about the wizard, John was defensive.
Mrs Hudson had retired for the evening. He thought to remark on it aloud, then wondered why he felt the need to state the obvious.
“So, where is your … Mr Wilkes?” Watson asked, unevenly. He was obviously still unsure of their relationship, seeing as Sebastian had never actually answered the question.
John was also painfully aware that Sherlock would soon become involved in the suicides, if he wasn’t already, and would end up being the final one if something wasn’t changed.
“You forget you have a home, and I do not,” he chided. He knew this was badly done, as he’d just established that Watson’s home was his obvious sore spot. But how could Watson possibly think they were of similar places in the world? The suggestion was ridiculous. He was no one, and Watson evidently was someone.
Stepping between the control room and the charging bay, John found each rectangular bot currently in-house at their designated charge stations, the soft green lights in the top right corner of their faces blinking in silence. The bots resembled roaming boxes when at work, using caterpillar tracks underneath them for traveling to save on energy, but which could retract for hovering when necessary. Admittedly they didn’t have faces at all, but John couldn’t help but see the system status lights as little eyes peering at him as he walked through the bay.
His eyes snapped open as the glass in the window pane shook, and he whipped his head to stare at Moriarty’s blank face. There was another blast, and then another. Rockets. It was the sound of rockets.
The alien’s antennae rotated in response, but they didn’t hesitate to climb into the passenger seat of the scouter, leaving space for John near the controls.
In any event, there was still no news to tell Greg. Besides the fact, of course, that John had befriended an alien who he was now allowing to live on the ship and was concealing from home base. But other than that, nothing much.
At that moment, he wished he were older, or simply different. He had yet to grow into himself, which made him annoyingly aware of when he was ill-equipped for dealing with social situations. Watson was eating early, clearly in an attempt to avoid other people (he would know). Watson also likely wanted nothing to do with him, but would now feel forced into his company by proximity.
John hadn’t dreamed since arriving at the castle, but that night he dreamt a bird landed on the bed and slept next to him, its feathers brushing his face every time he rolled onto his side.
John cleared his throat. “That’s a rather disparaging view of relationships,” he recovered, making a show of blowing on his dumpling to cool it.
“Harry’s right - perhaps I’ll show you sooner rather than later,” he said, with a little smirk he couldn’t resist.
John had arguably always been overly attached, but his interest in the last Sherlock Holmes case went in a different direction. The answer to the pill game was of no interest to him, though everyone in the forums was obsessed with arguing about the mind games. To John, it seemed like just dumb luck. He was more interested in, as always, his own role in the story. The different times and places Sherlock Holmes could have been convinced to not be so bloody stupid seemed endless. John liked to think of all the things he’d say to him, having endless pretend conversations with him, though the conversation was mostly John cursing interspersed with persuasion.
“Seeing as you’ve often complained that I write too slowly, I think we’d better wait,” John said. “And besides, what if I miss details in the account that you otherwise would just be able to ask me?”
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock confirmed. “The ‘bots’, as you call them. I thought their sounds were a form of communication.”
Shocked silence followed in the wake of his departure, before the crowd broke out into murmurs. Wilkes at first seemed nervous, but was soon laughing as if nothing had happened at all.
Silence descends, colder than that damn breeze. John has been meaning to get that window fixed. John has a feeling this is about more than whether he remembers the specific flowers.
“I don’t know what you mean, sir,” Moriarty responded. “But you’ll have to do something about that case. Best not let the master know of your bad habits.”
“You mean when I was shot?” John hadn’t thought about his own misfortunes for so long, it took him a moment to recall. “I almost begged for my life.”
“I don’t like to?” he repeated, a crinkle forming between his brows. “It’s - it’s you who doesn’t like to. You’re the one who doesn’t ever want to talk about it.”
The murder was sudden, unexpected, and in a word, anti-climactic. Sherlock Holmes bested by a petty criminal—a simple cabbie turned assassin for hire. Holmes had faced innumerable adversaries, but none that weren’t thwarted within the span of a novel. Sherlock’s only overarching foe in the end was his own loneliness and desperate desire to prove he was clever, which as it turned out, drove him to enter into an unnecessary suicidal game of choosing the right pill. Not a single person could claim to have foreseen it. No one ever expected Sherlock Holmes to meet his end over a simple challenge.
“When John wrote and told me,” Harry continued, now holding onto his arm tightly, “and he said he had discovered you in the south of France, and you were a decade younger, and very good-looking, I must admit it gave me a bit of a shock. For one, who knew he still had it in him! Of course, we all expected a social butterfly, very modern and plastered with paint, the sort of boy you meet in those sort of places.”
But then, Sherlock’s mouth felt like any other person’s. The lips were soft, and yielded to his own, and the mouth was wet and hot against his. Kissing Sherlock was like kissing any other person, and yet, John couldn’t recall ever having his heart race quite like this.
“Do I not seem shocked?” John responded, deadly quiet. Sherlock almost leapt from his chair to take over. It was a good job that he didn’t groan aloud.
The morning and afternoon passed quickly with last minute setup, and then Harry and Clara arrived early, driving up in the late afternoon already dressed to impress. Harry requested an aperitif the moment she exited the car, which didn’t bode well for her sobriety for the evening. Clara was dressed in a Regency era period costume, and Harry dressed as a Strong Man (or woman, he supposed). She passed her fake dumbbell to a servant to shake his hand.
John left him to finish bathing without his assistance, forgetting Sherlock’s comment about the boots entirely.
“There was a salmon that arrived yesterday,” Sherlock said from the desk, signing his name on the page. He did not look at the other man. “If the servants don’t want the cold food either, and who could blame them, feel free to toss it and give them the cutlets I saw on the sideboard.”
“Boys, boys,” Irene said, leaning on the wooden railing, still above both of them. “Sherlock, with the Queen’s guard and the Royal Wizard’s henchmen after you, frankly you need me. Admit it.”
It had been slurred, and took John a moment to process, but the man had without a doubt just yelled his name. It was the first word John had heard him speak, and it had clearly not been intentional, seemingly forced out by the strength of his orgasm.
John took Rossy from Sherlock’s arms in his arms, he was holding his daughter after a long time, tears of relief and joy come out from his eyes, a drop of his tears falls on Rossy’s cheek, Sherlock wiped that out from Rossy’s face, and decided to leave John and Rossy alone for sometimes, he was about to leave, John holds his hand and stops him, he said, “I am sorry Sherlock, for all that I said, I shouldn't have said those things, I am sorry.” Sherlock says, “It's ok, you didn't mean any of those did you?” John says, “No Sherlock, of course, I didn't mean any of those.” Sherlock gets up, and before leaving the cabin he says, “well I meant every word of it... Good night John...” He leaves... John whispers, “I know, I love you too. Forever and always.” Sherlock rushes back in the cabin, he says, “I am sorry, did you said something?” John says, “yeah you said, good night, and I said you too... That's all, you Idiot...” Sherlock says, “You Bustard...”  They both look at each other and smiles... Rosey starts giggling, Their world filled up with happiness again...
I looked over the body. Sherlock asked so what do you think, partner. I said, “He died around 9 pm last night according to the rigor-mortis setting in, and since it's a murder and not a heart attack. I think poison, maybe, because there are no signs of any other wounds.”
Sherlock said, “Did you see John, It was her, She was the cabby I knew she wouldn’t go without meeting with me.” His phone buzzes, that old tone, that was assigned only for her, he received a long text from her,
Sherlock says... “John!! Baker street... Now..” they came out .. Stopped a bike... While riding the bike Sherlock uses his mind palace where the Entire London... Each small path of it was printed... He calculates the smallest way with the lowest ETA  and rides the bike in top speed using every shortcut possible... And reaches 221 B Baker street in 39 minutes... They open the Door... Rush into the living room... They see Rosey in her crib and in her hand a bomb and a man was shading near the crib... Who looks exactly like John... The machine version of John...
Everett says, “But this is not the first time, this has happened to us before, several times. And we gotta be careful… we gotta stop this… Remember Strange, we don’t live here as Everrent Ross and Dr. Strange … We live here as Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch … this world doesn’t know our truth… this world doesn’t know that all of these don’t exist, this world doesn’t know that none the thing that happens here is real but only The magical friction created by the Sorcerer Supreme…  and we have to keep it this way…We have to take care of the fact that you have to play the role of Benedict, with his wife, his children, his family, and others...as Benedict Cumberbatch… and I have to do the same as Martin Freeman… with my family… They can't know that "Freebatch" is real... They can't know that "Rosstrange" is real... They can't know that we actually made "Johonolock"... ”
