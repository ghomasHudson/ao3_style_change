Sam remained silent, he dropped his gaze to his lap where his hands lay neatly folded over one another.
“Hello Becky, I am also ready. Can I please have a large, hot honey latte?” Castiel said, peeling his eyes away from Dean to address their perky waitress.
“Dean, yes, look at me,” Cas said sternly in his closest approximation of an Angel of The Lord voice. “You deserve so much more than what I was contributing. I should be expected to do basic adult things around the apartment. It was the absolute least I could do to put the damn laundry away.” - Cas gestures behind him - “You deserve help and I know that one big gesture from me is not enough. It’s not enough to make up for the neglect you’ve faced but I want to work on this. I want to be better for you and because of you.” Cas sank back into the couch, shrinking into himself.
“Of course I do, Dean” - Cas closed his eyes and tightened his grip in Dean’s hair - “I love you too. Thank you for moving here with me. It means the world to me.”
Cas closed the space between them and slid Dean’s jacket off of him. He turned and rested the coat on the back of the armchair. He took Dean’s hands into his own and pressed a light kiss to the backs of both hands.
A long day at the end of their senior year, Castiel is shipping up to Boston soon but is still unaware of Dean's plans. How does Dean's plans for after graduation affect our boys?
“Hi, I’m Dean,” Dean replied, taking Castiel’s hand in his, “I’m from Lawrence, so I didn’t go far.” He shook Castiel’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze before he pulled his hand back. He smiled softly, his eyes glistening with genuine pleasure at the conversation.
He stood in his kitchen, running on autopilot to brown the meat, dice tomatoes, and stir the noodles, the familiar motions of a meal made many times removed Cas from the situation. All that occupied his mind was the proper seasonings to add to the sauce, when to rinse the pasta, and how thick to slice the garlic bread. The warm aroma of a rich bolognese sauce permeated the room, filling Castiel’s nostrils with the comforting smells of past memories. As he reminisced on previous dates and meals, the tension fell from his shoulders and the weight of that morning was lifted. He stood in front of his stovetop, eyes closed, and replayed the first time he and Dean had cooked together. They both agreed on something simple and of course this ended in both of them covered in sauce and naked on the floor of the kitchen. This was the first meal they had ever made in this new apartment, in this new city, in their new lives together. Cas’s stomach finally settled from their argument and instead growled in anticipation of a fulfilling meal.
“Yeah, Deanie Beanie, of course, what’s up?” Charlie answered, turning around in his bed and crossing her legs underneath her.
“Totally understandable, have fun with Sammy, give him my best,” Castiel said, fiddling with the empty mug in front of him.
After another hour of cast fitting, receiving a laundry list of discharge instructions, and paying for his hospital visit, Dean and Castiel were leaving the Boston Medical Center and crossing through the employee parking garage to Castiel’s car.
“Ok” - Charlie reached up to place a hand on Dean’s shoulder - “We don’t have to talk about the fight but I do want to help you find yourself again in this relationship, you said you felt lost?”
“Yeah man! I’ve been meaning to ask you about that, how was finishing school?” Dean said, his eyes lighting up.
“What? You were testifying in an assault case? Can you ever talk about it?” Cas asked, his eyebrows raised high in disbelief of what Dean had said.
“Dean,” Sam said, the playful tone absent from his voice, “going back to your date tonight. You’ve said the same thing about not feeling it after every date you’ve gone on with this past year. What’s going on?”
“Well, I’m impressed,” Castiel chuckled and shook his head, “Kudos to your mom for educating you, I’m sure she’ll be very pleased to know that you remembered part of your lessons with her.”
He placed the ring back in its box and moved to return it to its hiding place but hesitated, instead he left it propped open on his nightstand. His eyes remained dry as he changed out of his scrubs into the t-shirt and sweatpants. He stood, wearing Dean’s clothes, quickly losing his composure. He reached over and closed the lid of the box. He closed his eyes and swallowed hard, forcing the roar of emotion that was threatening to escape back down.
“Heya, Cas'' Dean's voice broke through the cloud of thoughts raging through Castiel’s mind. He looked up at the voice and was stunned. Dean looked radiant against the sunlit backdrop of the windows behind him. The light reflected the gold coloring in his eyes and pulled attention to the freckles splashed across his cheeks. Cas thought about the old saying, that freckles were angel kisses, and he was unsurprised that Dean had garnered the attention of angels. Dean sat down across from Cas and the smell of wood and leather rolled off of him, filling the air around them.
“Babe, I'll get it,” Cas whispered against Dean’s lips. He pulled away, lifting his head to search through the bag. Dean slid his hand down from Cas’s shoulder down to his cock, teasing the sensitive head causing Cas to gasp and shiver. He had the small bottle in his hand until Dean lightly squeezed his balls and he dropped the bottle out of surprises and pleasure.
“Jesus, Cas, how’d you get over here so fast? We should put a bell on you,” Dean replied sharply, pushing past Cas into the living room.
“Ok, what are you going to say to him?” Castiel asked himself as he grabbed his shampoo from the edge of the tub, swaying with the beat of the music. Obviously he was still head over heels for the guy but there was no way that they were going to be getting back together, not after the way he walked out on Dean all those years ago.
“Dean,” Castiel started, losing his words along the way, his mouth suddenly going dry  as if he had stuffed it full of cotton.
“Thank you Dean, it was pretty exciting,” Castiel said, turning back towards Dean and folding his hands on the table, “but enough about you, you already saw me in my place of work, what have you been up to?”
“Uh, yes, yes, I’m still here,” Cas shook his head, gripping the phone tightly in his hand, “thank you for updating me on what’s going on, I appreciate it.”
“But it was not on you to save him. By the sound of it, Dean’s doing great. I know you blame yourself, but maybe he needed to figure out who he was on his own. And you definitely needed to figure out who you were on your own. “
“Thanks for asking, I think I’m doing alright for right now. It might be different in a couple of weeks when the verdict and sentencing come back but, for now? Just getting out of my dorm and creating some semblance of a life for myself is all that I need. So thanks for having me out for coffee. Let’s do it again sometime.” Dean said, a gentle grin spreading across his face, lighting up the room.
He didn’t have to search long until he found a familiar name in his contacts. His mind barely registered what he was doing as he selected Castiel’s number, typed out a friendly message, and sent it. It wasn’t until after the ~whoosh~ chimed from his phone that he read the text:
“So what, you’re going to ignore any thoughts that I have on this?” Cas asked, his eyes watery and red-rimmed, “do I not get to have an input whenever you go through something? When are you going to let me start helping you, Dean? I care about you and I care about your student, just because I personally didn’t go through the same things doesn't mean that I don’t have advice to give you.”
He and Dean had fought before, they had been together for nearly 7 years, of course there had been fights. And not all of them ended amicably, sometimes one of them stormed out, needing to cool down for a few hours before returning to the conversation.
“What is there to ask, Dean? I tried and you shut me down, I don't know what to tell you,” Cas said, not bothering to lift his head.
“Hey Dean, Castiel and I do work together. I’ve known who he is ever since Sam met me at the hospital one day and saw Castiel at the nurses’ station. Sam explained who he was to me and both he and I decided not to tell you that I worked with him. Now Dean, listen to me, “ Jess stated in an authoritative tone, she could see Dean’s eyes widen and his mouth open in protest, “Sam and I had good reason to do it. Dean, I didn’t know you and Castiel together, and I didn’t know you right after the breakup. But I’ve known you for almost two years now and I’ve seen how hard you have been working to get back on your feet.” - Jess sniffled and blinked hard to fight back tears that were forming in her eyes - “Dean, I found out who Castiel was early on in my relationship with Sam, I didn’t want you to associate me with him, to think that I was as close to him as I was to you, or that I talked about you to him because I don’t. Dean, I just wanted our relationship to work and be fun and easygoing and it   wouldn’t have been if you knew that I knew Castiel.” Jess looked away from the camera and wiped at her cheeks. She took several moments to breathe and calm down before returning to Dean.
The man shuffled into the small aisle and settled into the empty desk. Castiel leaned away from him, to give him the space needed to adjust the small writing surface attached to the seats in the hall.
“Uh, well, Dean, I think that I should be on my way. I’m sure you’re exhausted and I have some case reports that I need to get started on.” Castiel said in a tiny voice that betrayed the casual look he was attempting to display.
Dean sat in Castiel’s car in silence, the two of them cruising through the small streets of Boston with only the soft music coming out of the radio to interrupt the otherwise deafening quiet inside the car. His seat was pushed all the way back so he could stretch out his injured leg. He lounged in the passenger seat, one arm propped on the edge of the windowsill. After a few minutes of gazing absent-mindedly out of the window, Dean allowed his eyes to wander around the inside of the car.
“Dean,” -Cas rubbed the bridge of his nose between his eyes, his tone sharp - “I am more than happy to help you through things if I thought for a second that you would take my advice, but I cannot continue to sit here while you blatantly ignore what I have to say. I asked you everyday this week how work was going, I gave you the same advice every time you told me you were struggling with this and every time you shot me down. You wouldn’t even entertain what I had to say. I can tell that this is weighing on you and it kills me to see you hurt, but I don’t have it in me right now to deal with this,” Cas stated bluntly, his voice cracking near the end and his jaw held in a tight clench.
Dean turned on his heel and retreated to their bedroom. After drawing the curtains closed and crawling under blankets, the immensity of their situation weighed on Dean. There was no one that he treasured as much as Cas, no one whose opinion he valued and sought out as much as Cas’s. Where had he gone wrong? How could he possibly hope to undo this web he had gotten himself in?
“Dean, you know I hate it when you say hurtful things about yourself, you know I value everything you do around here,” Cas replied softly.
“Haha yeah you’re right I guess, I didn’t know that you were still drinking those,” Dean said, chuckling softly and finally picking his eyes up to meet Castiel’s gaze.
When he turned back to his brother, the questions left his mind. Castiel was wearing a worn, black sabbath t-shirt and grey sweatpants that were too large for him. His normally fluffy black tufts of hair laid flat against his scalp, his eyes were bloodshot from tears unshed, and his naturally warm complexion was drained and pale. The last time Gabe had seen his brother in such a state was shortly after he had moved out of the apartment he shared with Dean. In fact, he didn’t know that Castiel still had this shirt and pair of sweatpants.
Dean paused on the sidewalk, watching this event unfold trying to decide what his best course of action was. After only a few moments of deliberation, Dean resolved to confront the man. As Dean approached the man, Dean quickly realized that there was something off about him; his eyes wouldn’t quite focus on any one thing, he was switching from picking at his right forearm with his free hand and all of his actions seemed to be very erratic. He was acting like a junkie coming down and in need of another hit.
“Well, I wanted it to be a surprise, and, well”- Dean’s eyes dropped to his lap- “I was kinda worried that maybe you didn’t want me to come so I wasn’t going to tell you until I knew something was solid.”
“Yes, I drove him home and I ran into Jo while I was in his apartment. She did not seem super pleased to see me.” - Castiel stood with Tucker and walked him around the room, the boy babbled and wiggled in his arms  - “right as I was leaving, I asked Dean to consider getting coffee sometime, and I told him that I wanted to know how he was doing, you know, just as friends.”
“Castiel? Buddy? Are you still there?” Benny’s voice cut through the phone, breaking up Cas’s thoughts.
His throat clenched and his stomach dropped. The palms of his hands grew damp as he read and reread the text. He hadn’t even read over the message before he sent it. Had he  sounded desperate? Was it obvious that he missed Castiel with every fiber of his being? Dean threw his phone to the other side of his bed, screen down. He closed his eyes  and covered his face with his hands, praying that he was just overthinking this, that his utter need and desperation for Castiel to return to him was not as painfully blatant as he dreaded it was.
Luckily for Dean, the driver of the car was paying attention to the fight on the sidewalk and was already slowing his car down by the time Dean was in the street. When the car hit Dean, it wasn’t going very fast. Unfortunately, it was still going fast enough to crack the bone in Dean’s thigh, but at least he wasn’t run over. The driver jumped out of his car and ran over to Dean, already dialing 911. The driver finds a bloody Dean and a scared woman and child, the driver looks up to try to find the man that attacked Dean but found that he had already run off.
“Dean, I need to ask you something. We’ve been together for almost 4 years now and … well… we’re both clean because we’ve never slept with other people and I want - youtofuckmewithoutacondom” Cas squeaked out.
The man didn’t respond at first and did not seem to even notice that Dean was talking to him. Instead, he kept his eyes trained on the woman who was fumbling with her purse. Dean looked around to see if there was anyone else on the street that could back him up, but of course there wasn’t. It was 9:30 am on Thanksgiving, no one was just walking the streets when they could be with their family. The only help Dean might have hoped for were Meg and Jo inside the shop, where the hell were they?
“Ok, now that we have that one out of the way. Why do you love him? How is he contributing to this relationship? How does he meet your expectations and perceptions of a partner?” Charlie asked, leaning back and crossing her arms across her chest.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean said, his voice tilting up at the end, as if asking Cas 100 questions at once. “How are you doing?”
Before Dean could protest any further Castiel had produced a wheelchair seemingly out of nowhere and had whisked him out of the room and down the hall to get a cast.
“Castiel Novak,” Dean whispered, his voice dripping with adoration. He pulled one hand from Cas’s grip and cradled his face. Cas closed his eyes and leaned into Dean’s hand.
“That’s a story for another time” Dean replied. “I appreciate you taking the time to share notes with me, but I think I should be heading back to my dorm, I have to do laundry and cook dinner and all that bullshit. I’m serious about getting together and doing something again.”
Dean was still floating on air as he returned to his apartment that afternoon. The events of coffee and breakfast still playing back in his head. Dean wasn’t going to acknowledge that there had been something missing from his morning routine the past two years, something particularly Castiel-shaped. He knew that he shouldn’t feel as at ease as he was, but there was something familiar about sitting across the table from Castiel, the two of them sharing the morning over cups of coffee. Even if he didn’t want to admit that he had missed the back and forth that he and Castiel had, he could concede that he felt more whole, more like himself, now that his friend was back.
Cas paused mid step and turned to face Sam, the color had drained from Cas’s face and his eyes were glassy.
Heya Cas, I’ve been thinking about you and I wanted to say that I had a great time at coffee yesterday and I was wondering if you would want to get together again?
“Good! Glad I could help, now seriously get out of here and go propose!” Dean said, standing up and grabbing his crutches.
Dean’s smile faltered and he looked down at his lap briefly, as if to collect himself. Castiel could feel the grin fall from his face, the butterflies in his stomach instantly turned to lead. Had he overstepped? He thought. He had been known to get too comfortable too quickly with people, that he didn’t have the best record of making new friends, that his “people skills” were “rusty”. As if they had ever been anything but.
His thoughts turned on him, rather than saying these things about Cas, maybe Dean should have just kept his mouth shut and accepted his lot in life. It’s not like he should have expected anything better for himself. John Winchester was right in saying that his only purpose was to keep Sammy safe and happy.
“Wow, I am sorry for that, it’s been a long day. You said that you had something you wanted to tell me?” Cas said, looking up at Dean.
“Ok, look Dean, before you get mad at me and yell, just understand where I’m coming  from” Sam said, breaking Dean’s train of thought. “I watched my big brother, my best friend and protector, have to put himself back together over the past two years. I have watched you combat and overcome so many aspects of your past and I am so proud of you. But yet when  it comes to  dating, it doesn’t seem like you’re trying? Does that make  sense? I have watched you go from being a “shove it down and cover it with booze, I’m fine” kind of guy to someone who is willing to have conversations about what you are going through but you’re not going to talk to me about the people you’re dating?”
He reached out and rubbed small circles in his younger brother’s back. Gabe looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath. It had been a long time since his brother last looked the way he did now. Sitting on the bed holding his son, he seemed to be a shell of himself, the light that normally shone in his eyes was extinguished today. He knew that Castiel blamed himself for leaving, that he tortured himself for “abandoning Dean”, that he wished he had been strong enough to stay.
“That’s not fair, that’s not what I said and you know it,” Cas responded quickly as though he had anticipated Dean misinterpreting his words.
“What’s up babe?” -Dean angled himself towards Cas, rolling his shoulders back and down away from his ears.-
“Hey, man, let’s settle down here,” Dean says in a low, calm voice. “There’s no need for any of this today. It's a holiday and these people are just trying to go about their day.”
Every time Dean found a response, his body refused to cooperate, his mouth dry, his tongue heavy, his lips sealed. His eyes remained locked on Castiel’s, his chest rose and fell with every breath as he focused on keeping his breathing even and controlled. Dean studied Cas’s face for any insight into what was going through his head, any hint as to how he should handle this going forward.
He stomped out of the apartment, slamming the door behind him. He didn’t look back on his way out, but if he had, Dean would have seen Castiel crumple on the floor right outside their bedroom, and sob.
“What? Did you just say that you want to retire? You find out that Cain is actually me and immediately you’re ready to retire?”
“I grabbed the first blanket I could find, sorry if Spock is more your speed,” Charlie said with a soft chuckle and a tilt of her head.
Today had been the longest day of his life and there was nothing he wanted more than to be in the comfort of his own home right this minute. Ok, that might not have been true. What he actually wanted more than anything was to be wrapped up in Dean’s arms, the two of them curled up together on his couch eating takeout and watching one of Dean’s dumb history documentaries.
“I’m so happy for you, I’m glad that you have that resource now,” Castiel said, not responsible for the pride displayed across his face.
Man, it’s exactly the same… Just a stethoscope hanging from the rearview mirror instead of that ratty dreamcatcher and a couple more textbooks in the backseat but other than that? Exactly the same. Dean thought to himself before shifting his gaze over to Castiel.
“Who the fuck am I kidding, I am still head over heels for that man and I always will be,” Dean finally whispered, his admission cutting through the thick air. He let out a watery chuckle as a weight was lifted from his shoulders. A smile crept across his face until his teeth showed and his eyes lit up. Looking at himself in the mirror, he almost didn’t recognize himself. It had been years since he felt as good as he did right then. His body felt lighter, his heart ached less, and he wasn’t ashamed to be thinking about Cas.
“Hey, uh, thanks for bringing me home, you didn’t have to go through all that just for me,” Dean said, turning towards Castiel and resting his arm on the edge of the couch, “I know you have a life and better things to do than make house calls.”
“Oh wow, it's already been an hour and a half”- Castiel glanced down at his watch -”I’m not sure what your plans were for today and I don’t want to keep you from anything…”
“Yeah, Dean! They are exactly where you left them. If you need anything just yell.” Sam said quietly, not looking up at his brother.
As Dean strummed the final chords to the song, Cas sat speechless, anxiously awaiting whatever Dean had to say next.  He watched as Dean replaced his guitar on its stand and moved to sit beside him on the couch. Castiel felt as though he was watching these events outside of himself, as though he was the observer to someone whose life was falling apart, rather than living it himself. He watched as Dean took his hands into his own, not really feeling it. He finally peeled his eyes from his hands and looked up into Dean’s eyes.
As for the past two years? I was so wrapped up in what was going on with Dean that I never thought that you could be hurting too.” – Sam removed his hand from Cas’s shoulder-  “I’m not sure how much you know about Dean’s past couple of years but I’m not sure that it's my place to tell you any of it.”
“Here,” Dean said, directing Cas to the couch behind them, “sit here and drink this. I’ll be right back.”
“Dean. I am going to propose to Jess but, “ - Sam lifted a hand to his mouth and chewed on this thumb nail- “what if she says no?”
The man lunged at Dean with the knife, waving his arm in wild, erratic slashing motions. Dean had  been in his fair share of fights before, but always with men that he was able to track and predict, this man was unpredictable and dangerous. Dean is able to dodge and avoid his slashes well enough until he hears the woman’s crying again and tries to look for her. By the time he looks up at the man again, no more than a second later, the man is too close to evade. The man slashes once more and catches Dean across his abdomen and up his left side towards his elbow. Dean stumbles back out of the slash and out of the man’s reach into the street behind him. In all the commotion, Dean wasn’t paying attention to the road and didn’t see the car coming down the street until it made contact with his right leg.
“Dean, look at me” - Charlie took Dean’s chin in her hand and tilted his head so that his eyes met hers. - “if this is what you think is best for you tonight, then of course. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.”
“Please Sam, just let me get through this without interruptions.” Cas said, sitting up straight and wiping his palms dry on his scrub pants, one knee bouncing,  “this is going to be hard enough as it is.”
Dean entered the cafe area with Castiel following closely behind him. The two chose a small two-top and fell into a comfortable silence. Castiel watched Dean as he studied the menu, his eyes followed Dean’s lips as he quietly read the options aloud, something that Dean had done on all of their dates before. Dean bit his lip, deep in thought as though choosing his coffee was the most important decision he was going to be making this morning.
“Ok Dean, I’ll be back later tonight but if you need anything just let me know!” Sam said, getting in the last word as Dean closed the front door behind him.
“What else did you do? Babe, just coming home to this whole setting and having you admit that you know what upset me was enough for me.”
Cas looked up at Dean from the assignment lists of his classes, his hair tousled in all directions and glasses falling down his nose. He smiled up at Dean but his eyes betrayed his feelings, their usual brilliance slightly faded, dark bags already formed despite the still-early days of the school year. Nonetheless, Cas always had the energy to fake contentment for Dean. His bright smile faltered as he took in the look at Dean’s face.
The two finally pulled themselves together, holding their sides and wiping imaginary tears from their eyes.
If Sam had seen through this lie, he didn’t let on. He nodded silently and turned back towards the television. He looked over at Dean once more before turning the volume back up.
Castiel fumbled with his phone, searching for a playlist that would match his  energy  this morning. He settled upon “Today’s New Alternative Hits” on his Spotify and jumped into the shower. An upbeat new release from this up and coming band filled the bathroom, something about shampoo bottles, seemed fitting for a shower song.
“I told you already, I think that you should stay away from Dean. I can’t see him get hurt again, I won’t let him get hurt again,” Sam said, meeting Castiel’s eyes with equal intensity and anger.
The state that you were in after the breakup told me as much, let alone all the times that you called me in the middle of the night stressed and worried for Dean.” -Gabe leaned forward and placed a hand on Castiel’s shoulder- “Cas you had nightmares, you’d talk in your sleep, you’d beg me to let you go back so that you could take care of him, neither of you should have been the sole caretaker for the other and you tried, Cassie did you try.
“Dean?” Cas said, his voice uneven and unsure, “I’ve been wanting to talk to you about something. It's nothing bad don’t worry-” he added in a rush.
Jo shut her mouth, her eyes locked on Castiel as she dropped her bag in the living room. She turned on her heel and left the room to busy herself in the kitchen. Dean and Castiel sat in silence in the living room and listened to the clattering of flatware and slamming of cabinet doors in the kitchen.
Dean looked up towards the corner of the room, breathless, and wiped his face dry with the back of his hand.
“Yes, fine, whatever you need Castiel. Take the entire last hour of your shift, I’ll cover it. But I will be rescheduling you to another time of my choosing,” Anna said, “and you, Mr. Winchester,” -she turned to face Sam- “you ever pull this crap in my hospital again, and I’ll revoke your lounge access.”
I met you when you were with Cas, so my Dean foundation up here” - she pointed to her temple- “is you when Cas is in your life, you seem looser somehow, you carry yourself differently,” She responded, sitting back against the armrest.
Dean stood in his kitchen, gripping the juice bottle in his hands, anxiously awaiting Sam’s response. The air was thick, heat rose around Dean’s collar and his forehead glistened, beads of sweat threatening to spill over. His heart was racing, thumping hard in his chest as though desperately trying to escape.
“Well,” Cas said, folding his hands in front of him on the table, “as much as I love bees, I’m here as a pre-med student, I want to be a doctor when I grow up.” He looked down at his hands, not wanting to see Dean’s reaction to such a generic career goal.
Dean sat, watching Charlie, hoping that she would say something and give him an excuse to not continue. He sat there, silently pleading with her to not force him to say what was bubbling within him. As he felt the pressure behind his eyes build and the blood rush to his cheeks, Charlie sat, patiently waiting for Dean to finish what he was saying.
Jo returned with the hot chocolate as the ambulance arrived. Meg and Jo agreed that they would stay behind and keep the Lisa and Ben company until the police arrived. Dean was loaded up and he assured both the girls that he would call them with updates and that he would be fine.
“Where on Earth do you think I would be without you?” Dean asked. “I love you so deeply, and so completely. Thank you for saying this to me, I’m really glad that this is how tonight ended up going.”
“I’m not sure I want to talk about it,” -Dean placed a hand on Cas’s cheek and Cas leaned into the touch- “Honeybee, you just seem so stressed, I really don’t want to pile on, besides, I should be able to handle it, I just need to think it through.”
“What?” Cas replied, setting his pen down and turning to face Dean. “What did you say? I didn’t hear you.”
“Yes! I do rather enjoy honey, the bees are magnificent creatures and they are dying far too quickly.”
Sam leaned back and huffed in amusement. He may be in law school and at the top of his class, but he never felt as stupid as he did right then. How could he not have seen this?
“Gabe,” Castiel said, his voice wavering, cracking as he tried to maintain composure, “Thank you. For everything. I don’t know how I would have made it through the breakup without you, and I wouldn’t be surprised if you were so… so” -Castiel swallowed hard and shook his head- “fucking pissed with me right now for putting myself back in this situation, but I hope you understand that just simply existing and being involved in Dean’s life is so much better than living without him. Even if I have to settle for a friendship, I can’t live without him.”
Castiel sat back in his seat, eyes wide in surprise. He had always hoped that Dean would go back to school, that he would recognize his potential and push his limits. Not that he thought that Dean’s work as a history teacher wasn’t good enough or meaningful, but he knew that Dean didn’t feel challenged in his job, that he didn’t feel fulfilled in what he was doing. A Masters in Psychology was perfect for Dean. Castiel swallowed his surprise and flashed a bright smile at Dean, his pride glistening in his eyes.
As he listened to Dean describe him as a conqueror of illness and death, he too began to picture himself in this role. He felt more secure in himself just knowing that an outside source understood what he was saying, that this almost-total stranger could see his motives, that he could articulate the exact feelings Cas had about medicine.
The smile fell from his face, and a weight settled in his stomach. There was no reason that he shouldn’t have a good time, Lisa was perfectly pleasant and hot as hell. But something was wrong, something was off. Dean sat across from Lisa Braeden and thought to himself that this might have worked out, in a different life.
Sam’s smile faltered and he shifted uncomfortably. His eyes downcast, away from Dean, and his hands picking at the seam on his jeans. Dean could see his jaw clench as  though he was biting back words.
Maybe he would tell Dean, just confess and get it all out in the open. Maybe that way they could work through this together and find a way to keep Dean safe.
“Gabe? You look like you have something to say.” Castiel said over his shoulder, “You can say it, I know I looked rough when you first got here but this little guy” - he lifted Tucker  up over his head and gave him a little toss,  enough for the boy to leave his grasp but never leave his hands - “works wonders on heartache.”
“Look, this is not an attempt to ask you out. We used to be great friends and I have to say, I’ve missed you. I would like to attempt to be your friend again, Dean Winchester.”
Dean maintained a cautious smile on his face as he said goodbye to Castiel but then dropped his face in exhaustion as Castiel rounded the corner to say goodbye to Jo in the kitchen. Dean lifted his head when he heard a scuffle and a bang in the kitchen. He quickly gathered his crutches and limped out of the living room. As he entered the kitchen, he found Jo with the largest knife Dean had in his kitchen, and a look in her eyes that would smite Castiel where he stood if she possessed that kind of power spread across her delicate features. Castiel carefully and quietly took his leave.
“Beans? What beans?” Dean said, glancing around the room, firmly keeping his gaze on anything besides Charlie.
Dean shifted in his seat, desperately trying to find a way to get comfortable in his living room while Castiel walked around. His fingers found their way to the buttons on his flannel and he began to worry one between his fingers. Dean sat there on the couch with flashes of panic running through his head.
“Well, do you at least know what you’re looking for in a date?” Sam asked, genuine interest filling his words, “do you know why you’re not having a great time? I at least thought your date with Benny would go better than it did.”
Dean stepped out of Charlie’s building and into the cold. He fished his cell phone out of his pants pocket and sent Cas a message.
“Hello?” a man’s voice answered. Castiel was momentarily dazed, a man had answered Dean’s phone, but it wasn’t Dean. His entire world stopped spinning, who the hell was answering his boyfriend’s phone? Where had Dean gone?
“Um, yeah, actually,” Castiel said, his grin widened into a full smile. His stomach flipped at the mere idea that someone knew the origin of his name, and seemed to be interested in discussing it. He reveled in the fact that Dean wasn’t put off by the religious background that he obviously came from.
“Ok,” -Dean took a deep breath and turned so that he was sitting and facing Charlie- “obviously, you know that I broke my leg and Castiel was the doctor that stitched me up at the hospital. Well, I texted him a couple days ago about meeting up and getting coffee today.” Dean paused, trying to gauge Charlie’s reaction to what he was saying, but her face revealed no indication of her thoughts. He continued,
Sam shifted in his seat, dropping his eyes from Castiel’s gaze. He swallowed hard before responding.
Just an hour and a half longer, just a simple 90 minutes and Castiel was free for the night. Well, pending any emergency or disaster that might surface between now and then. Castiel stood from his small desk to take a quick lap around the hospital floor. He enjoyed the break from staring at a screen and his route allowed him to peek in and check on various patients that had been admitted to a room.
Dean held the eye contact, falling into the reassurance of Cas’s words and his physical touch. He took a deep breath to steady himself, and the rest of the story fell out of Dean in a torrent.
As Castiel washed delicate dishes, he questioned his own actions. What could he have done differently or better? What did he say that set Dean off the way he did? Was he wrong in suggesting that they find some way to acknowledge Mary in their relationship? His head swam with What-Ifs and hypotheticals.
“Hell yeah honeybee, of course I came here with you,” - Dean rolled his head up so that he could meet Cas’s eyes - “I’d follow you into the dark if you asked me.” Dean leaned forward and placed a light, tiny kiss on the end of Cas’s nose.
“Erm, well,” -Castiel fidgeted in his seat, thankful that Gabe had left the mustache behind. It was simple and silly enough that it took the air out of his anxiety, bringing it down to manageable levels- “I just got back from coffee with Dean.”
Castiel had been struggling with these thoughts and they often kept him up at night. He felt so guilty about walking out that night. Dean was in a bad place and Castiel just said that he couldn’t handle Dean and his emotional baggage anymore and just … left. Dean’s treatment of him today was the best that he probably could have hoped for and he shouldn’t have been so surprised to hear Dean call him “Castiel”. Cas was a special nickname that Dean had given him the day that they first met. No one else before him had called him that, and he hadn’t introduced himself as Cas to anyone he’s met since he and Dean broke up. Cas was something special, something that belonged to Dean.
Gabe didn’t respond, he kept his gaze locked on Castiel, who was refusing to make eye contact with him through this.
Dean took a deep breath, “Jo, he was getting off his shift and offered to drive me home. I told him that he didn’t have to, that I’d call an uber and I would be fine. He countered by telling me that he was worried, from a medical perspective” - he held a hand up to Jo to stop her from interrupting- “that my concussion was too severe to leave me alone for a couple of days and that I shouldn’t be trying to go upstairs on my own for a little bit.”
“Ok, “ Cas sighed, continuing to pick at his skin, “I’ll tell you what happened that night. You should have all the information about the man your brother was so you can appreciate the person he is today.”
“Dean! Can you stop fidgeting?!” Cas yelled playfully, able to spare a quick glance over at Dean in the passenger seat. “We’re almost there but damn these roads are narrow and the drivers are horrible! I need to pay attention before some assbutt cuts in front of me.”
Before Castiel had a chance to start a full argument with his fellow interns about substance addiction in Boston, he heard his name being called across the ER.
With shaky knees and uneven breathing, he opened the Notes app on his phone to draft a new message and avoid this risky scenario again.
“She’s watching House Hunters, she likes to criticize the couples for the kinds of houses they want. I’ll close the door and please, sit.” Charlie replied, pointing out her bed.
“Hey, honeybee, it's good to see you,” Dean said as he met Cas in the hall and kissed him softly on the cheek.
Castiel let the car door slam behind him. He slumped into the driver’s seat and slid forward until his forehead hit the steering wheel.
“Ha, well Cas I think our track record shows that we can’t read each other’s minds yet and things work out better when I’m clear about my intentions with you,” Dean pressed a gentle kiss to Cas’s forehead.
“Yeah, we will not be doing that but A for effort.” Dean spat out, getting up from the bed and patting Cas on the back as he passed him. Cas turned, mouth agape, as he watched Dean pad over to the dresser and pull out a clean t-shirt.
“NOVAK! This mid-20s male is yours! Sounds like he’s stable so stitch him up, assess his leg and possible concussion then you’re out of here,” Anna called out to Castiel.
“Yes, I knew it!” -Dean pumped his fist in a small gesture in front of him- “My mom was super into angels when I was a kid and I still have the book she gave me on them.”
“Are you sure you’re going to be ok? I mean I feel like I can’t let either of us leave today without knowing that I’m going to be able to make this up to you someday?”
“Can you not move so much? I’m going to need to place a couple of stitches here.” Castiel said, looking up at Dean’s face.
Dean spit the last few words out and looked away from Charlie, ashamed. His neck turned a bright pink color from the embarrassment of admitting how his partner treated him. The combination of anger at his position and of his admission of a problem turned his stomach, all he wanted was to curl into himself and hide.
Castiel got to the coffee shop first, just like he had planned. Dean had always given him a hard time for being late while they were dating and he was determined to be the first one here for this get together, he also knew that he needed the time to settle his nerves before Dean showed up. He also had the perfect cover, Trident Case was also a bookstore, so if Dean asked why he was already there, he could just tell him that he  was hoping to find a new book, which of course was true because Castiel was always looking for new books.
“You already know that I only ever get one thing at coffee shops,” Castiel responded, returning the tone.
“What in the hell is this?!” A sharp female voice interrupted them. The two men turned their heads towards the sound and watched Anna storm down the hall.
“Dean, I would move heaven and hell for you. We’re going to get through this.” Cas whispered as he crouched down to look Dean in the eyes.
“CAS!” Dean said, cutting Cas off and grasping Cas’s hands in his own. “It’s ok, I just had a small breakdown over wanting to be a history teacher so I think we’re a little more than strangers at this point. I don’t mind you asking.” A small smile formed on Dean’s face, putting Cas at ease.
“Dean? Do you want to tell your brother about your day today?” Jo turned towards Dean, putting him on the spot and causing the color in his face to deepen and reach his hairline.
“Come here.” Dean said through gritted teeth. He grabbed Cas by the lapel of his cheap suit and dragged him into the nearest bathroom.
Dean looked deep into Cas’s eyes, letting the words sink into him. A small flicker of anxiety and panic sparked in his chest, threatening to ignite into an inferno. He swallowed hard and squeezed Cas’s hand back, waiting to see if the man had more to this pitch.
Dean looked at Sam, dumbfounded, he moved silently to the chair in front of him and took a seat. Never taking his eyes off Sam.
The already expansive smile on Dean’s face grew larger, he bit his lower lip and took the paper from Cas.
Taking a deep breath, Dean pushed away from the desk for a minute. He closed his eyes and forced a smile on his face. He had read somewhere that forcing yourself to smile for 20 minutes a day raised your serotonin levels and helped to reduce stress. Desperate for a mental reset, Dean dragged his cast back into the kitchen to steal one of the kombuchas that Sam stocked in the fridge but of course he would deny ever drinking one.
“Sam? What are you doing here?” Castiel asked, his eyes finding Sam’s, “Jess doesn’t work today if you’re here to see her.”
“Ok Dean, perfect. Now, forget about calling that Uber, you were my last patient so as soon as we can get you a cast, I will be driving you home.” Castiel said, clapping his hands once and standing up.
“Do you not think you’re worth saving?” Cas stepped towards Dean and grabbed his face between his hands.
“Thank you, Dean,” Sam said softly, breaking the silence that surrounded them. “I needed that, reasonably I knew that Jess would say yes, but you know how it goes once you get some idea in your head.”
“Yeah, I know, I’m actually here to talk to you about something,” Sam replied shortly. He held eye contact for a few moments, letting the tension between the two of them build.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel responded, reaching out and clapping Dean on the shoulder once, “it’s my pleasure to be here. Wanna sit down?” He gestured to the cafe to his right.
“So it didn’t go well, guess you’re out of practice huh?” Sam said with a playful tone and comical wink.
Ok, well after hearing it again, maybe it wasn’t the best declaration of love that he could come up with but this was his first time. The first time he counted the days until he could see someone again, the first time he woke up and fell asleep thinking about someone. The first time that someone’s name rolled off his tongue as effortlessly as Dean’s did.
Three hours passed before Castiel felt human enough again to leave their bedroom. He peeled the blankets back like a cocooned, and slowly made his way to the kitchen. He stood there, his melancholy delaying his thoughts and decision making. Finally, the gears started turning again and he began moving all the dishes from the sink to the dishwasher.
Hello, Dean. I would love to get a cup of coffee with you. How’s tomorrow at 11? We could meet at Trident Cafe? Let me know :D
Dean stared back at Cas, his mouth agape. He opened and closed his mouth repeatedly, searching for words. His mouth went dry and he struggled to swallow.
His heart stopped and his eyes nearly fell out of his head with how quickly they bugged out. He choked on this saliva as he watched the blue sending bar load at the top of the screen. Acting on some instinct he didn’t know he had, he quickly slid the control screen on his phone down and turned on ‘airplane mode’. A prompt popped up on the screen asking him if he wanted to send the message as a text message rather than an iMessage was Dean’s saving grace. He quickly selected NO and was able to delete the text before it was sent.
The man was distracted enough by Dean that his grip on the boy loosened and he was able to slip away and run back to his mom. The man panicked a little as he realized that his only leverage was gone. His eyes darting from side to side trying to come up with his next move.
“Dean? Can you hear me?” Cas asked, his voice a whisper in a suddenly silent bedroom. Dean looked around and saw that he was sitting upright in bed and was not trapped in a burning car with his mother, or in any room with his father.
By this point, both Meg and Jo had run out of the shop and were attending to the woman and the boy. Meg quickly sent Jo back inside to whip up a special batch of hot chocolate while they all waited for an ambulance and the police to arrive.
Dean’s eyes flew open in a panic, his screaming abruptly ending as his mind failed to catch up. He was looking Cas in the eyes and could see complete and total terror in the other man’s expression. Cas held Dean in both hands, his left hand was wrapped around his right wrist and his right was gripping Dean’s left shoulder with enough force to leave a mark behind.
Dean nodded his head at Cas once and stood to leave the shop. Cas remained in his seat for another few minutes, piecing together the events of that afternoon.
“Ah Sam, “ -Castiel looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath, he looked back at Sam and leaned forward so his elbows rested on his knees, “I hear you. But I don’t-”
“I met Dean this morning at Trident and we got coffee and caught up. It was his idea, he texted me last night and I agreed so I went and I saw him and we talked and caught up.” Castiel said quickly, shrinking with each word until he was hiding behind his giant mug as best he could.
His breath hitched as he caught a glimpse of the onyx band. The ring sat in stark contrast to the red velvet covering the inside of the box. Castiel removed the ring and set the box to the side. He ran his fingers over the sparkling blue stripe that ran through the center of the band, he moved it so that the light reflected the flecks of silver within the sapphire. Along the inner surface of the ring at the engraving:
“How have you been, Dean?” Castiel asked, breaking the silence. He picked up his  mug, raising an eyebrow at Dean as he took a sip.
“Gabriel?” Castiel called from the living room, “Are you here already? I wasn’t expecting you for another 10 or 15 minutes.”
Dean and Cas stood, hand-in-hand, on the sidewalk outside their Boston brownstone for several minutes. The immensity of the moment they were in sat heavily in both of their minds.
“Gotcha, be right back,” Dean replied, snapping his fingers in a finger-gun motion and winking at Cas as he slid out of the booth.
“Huh, I was wondering if you were going to remember that part.” - Castiel looked up at  Gabe - “I drove him home, that’s how I knew that his apartment looked the same.”
Cas gasped at this confession and Dean pulled his hands back out of Cas’s grip. He fumbled for the warmth of Dean’s hands, he searched for the grounding weight that was this man’s hands in his own. He looked up at Dean and saw acceptance painted on his face.
Cas cupped his hand under Dean’s chin and tilted his face towards him until their eyes met. Cas pulled Dean down to his lips a tender, almost chaste kiss. Cas broke the kiss, but left his hand on Dean’s face. The two laid there for a second, their shallow breaths deepening as they took in the full view of their lover laying before them. Cas took a deep breath and opened his mouth to speak.
“Hells yeah I hit you! It’s about damn time you ask her! She’s put up with more than enough with this family to earn a permanent place here. Jess is already as much of a Winchester as she’s going to get, so make it official already, Sammy Damn”
“...on thanksgiving…” Dean said in a voice barely above a whisper, dropping his eyes away from Charlie.
Promptly 20 minutes later, Charlie let herself in with her set of keys and threw herself down on the couch, her red curls bouncing and falling to frame her face as she studied Dean.
“Hm, thank you for being a friend to him in this moment, I’m glad he has someone to go to when he needs them,” Cas’s throat tightened as he thanked this other man. Each word cut into him with a slash. Admitting that someone else was a better support system for Dean broke him.
“What exactly are you asking me, Cas?” Dean asked, his voice barely audible and dripping in apprehension.
“Ok good. Here is your honey latte,” Dean said, a small grin appearing on his face as  he set the mug down in front of Cas. “And I got a vanilla chai, my brother’s girlfriend introduced me to them and I will never admit to her that they are actually pretty tasty.” He raised his mug to take a sip, and when he pulled it away,  a small foam mustache was left  behind.
Dean, out of breath, looked over at Charlie with tears in his eyes and found that she didn’t look surprised in the slightest. He furrowed his brow and opened his mouth to ask-
“I’m sorry,” -Castiel reached out to lay a hand on Dean’s arm- “I didn’t mean to overstep-” He looked down at his hand resting on Dean, shock resonated through him. He couldn’t believe that he was touching him, why had he thought this was a good plan? He is in the middle of apologizing for overstepping and this is what he does?
The deep rumble of Cas’s voice soothed Dean’s nerves, he rolled his shoulders down from around his ears and unclenched his fists, wiggling his fingers loose. Without thinking about it, Dean stepped into the living room and looked around the room. Cas’s classes had started back earlier that week and he already looked weighed down. Books and notes spread across the floor as he organized himself for the semester.
“Hell yeah, dude! I get what you’re saying and I can totally picture it too, you’d be like this badass warrior with a silver blade, your white lab coat billowing around you as you take on our most fearsome monsters.” Dean said, his eyes lighting up as he talked with his hands, using them to create a scene in which Cas was a soldier in the fight against death.
“I’ve been good, honestly, a lot better recently, but not bad,” Dean said, finally pulling his eyes away from the mug.
Dean’s eyebrows raised until they were practically in his hair and he felt his jaw drop open slightly.
Cas felt bad that he had made Dean uncomfortable and that he was forcing his  care and attention on a man that obviously did not want to spend that much time with him. But a large part of him didn’t care, he had really missed Dean the past couple of years and there  was nothing more that he wanted to be doing than catching up with the one and only, Dean Winchester.
Hey, I was thinking about you and what you said. I’d be down to get coffee sometime soon if you were still interested. Let me know what you think, I’d also like to get back in touch and reconnect,  hope to see you soon :)
Dean stood in disbelief. Cas almost never gave up this easily when he acted like this, he usually lost out and Dean ended up sharing some emotion he would rather keep stuffed down. He watched Cas adjust the glasses on his face and highlight a definition in his notes.
“Thanks, man, you were always telling me that I should consider it. Now that I have, I see what all the fuss is about,” Dean said, a flash of something, almost apologetic, filled his eyes. Castiel got a glimpse before Dean dropped his gaze to the cup between his.
He continued scanning the car and his surroundings, his eyes finally landing on the figure in front of him.
“Dean, look, I know that you only live on the second floor, but I want you to let me help you up the stairs.” Castiel turned toward Dean and spoke softly. He knew that this was going to be a fight with Dean based on past experiences with his complete refusal of any kind of assistance.
Cas pulled out of Dean’s grasp and grabs Dean’s shoulders to turn him around. The two of them are facing each other now, Cas sets his cup of coffee down and gently places both hands on Dean’s face, he gazes deep into Dean’s eyes, taking in the green color and the flecks of gold staring back at him. The air between the two of them is electric as they stand in their new kitchen in silence. Cas pulls Dean down and closes the gap between them until their lips meet. Their kiss deepens and Cas’s hands find their way into Dean’s hair. Dean blindly finds the counter to set his coffee down on and wraps both arms tightly around Cas.
After another minute, Dean finally got the notification that he’d received a new voicemail. He typed in his phone passcode, his heart seizing as he put in their anniversary date to unlock the sleek device Castiel gave him for his birthday nearly a year ago. He selected the phone icon and pulled up the most recent voicemail. His finger lingered over Cas’s name, hesitating before playing the message. He placed the phone up to his ear and held his breath.
Suddenly, the scene went black and he could hear his father’s voice- ‘ITS YOUR FAULT DEAN’- a small whimper escaped Dean -’HAD YOU JUST DONE WHAT YOU WERE TOLD SHE’D BE ALIVE’- tears were steadily streaming down Dean’s face as he drowned in his sobs. ‘DAMMIT DEAN’- Dean screamed as blow after blow landed on his back and on his arms as he tried to protect himself. John continued screaming at his son but the words were lost.  Dean tried to fight back, kicking and throwing his arms as tears flowed and he struggled for breath- **
Now that they were stopped at a light, Cas was able to turn his head and take in a full image of Dean. He was wearing his black Led Zeppelin shirt (he had managed to steal it back from Cas this morning) and a pair of his best faded jeans. They were the best because they clung to his ass the best but Cas wasn’t going to let on to that fact, it was just for him. Dean was looking out the window at the historic brownstones that lined the streets, his right arm propped up on the windowsill, he was chewing on his fingernails. Sitting here in Cas’s car, about to start their lives together in Cas’s favorite city, the two of them on the cusp of their careers, Cas couldn’t help but think that Dean Winchester was the most beautiful human he had ever met.
“Did you not want to go on a date with me?” Dean asked in a small voice, so quiet that Cas wondered if he’d actually heard it.
“Dean!” Charlie yelled, her eyes wide and mouth agape, “you said ‘nothing serious’?? You got cut with a knife and hit by a car and you didn’t call me? When did this happen?”
Jo stopped in her tracks when she caught the sight of Castiel Novack sitting in an armchair just feet away from an injured Dean. Her oversized purse slipping off her shoulder, catching at her elbow. Her mouth dropped open in quiet disbelief as her gaze switched back and forth between Dean and Castiel. She scrunched her forehead and pinched her eyebrows together as Dean could see the wheels turning in her head, trying to piece together the scene that was there in front of her.
“Gabriel, I am in love with Dean Winchester and I always have been and I think that I always will be. It killed me these past two years to not know what was going on in his life, to be so removed from him. When he texted me last night to get coffee, I didn’t think he was asking me to get back together or anything like that, so please do not assume that I’m under some delusion that we’re going to get back together because we’re not. I know that.” -Castiel paused here to catch his breath, he spoke quickly, desperate to get the words out before the tears started. He could feel the pressure behind his eyes and the burning in the back of his throat from fighting them back-
“I’m setting up a stand for my phone, we’re going to get a picture of the two of us in front of our new home!” Dean answered over his shoulder, still messing with his phone to pull up the camera’s timer function.
“Cas, honeybee, look at me,” Dean whispered, placing both hands on Cas’s cheeks,  cupping his face, “I am asking you plainly, will you move in with me?”
As he stepped out of the shower, Dean remembered Castiel’s request for coffee. Well, this seems as good a time as any, Dean thought drying himself off. He grabbed the towel off the hook on the back of the door and quickly wrapped himself up to shield Sam’s sensitive eyes as he crutched back to his bedroom. Dean collapsed onto his bed, grabbing his phone.
Cas closed his mouth and studied Sam, taking in his body language, the creases in his face, the heavy emotion in his eyes. Sam truly had never heard the story of the breakup, had never been burdened with the details. Despite what Dean had told him about making an effort to be more open and honest about his emotions with the people in his life, the termination of their nearly seven-year relationship had been outside the bounds of what he could talk about.
“Well, I have to miss class on Tuesday, I know right, like already?” Dean said, nodding his head along with the cadence of his gentle midwestern accent, “I have some family business that I have to take care of and I could not get out of it on Tuesday. Is there any way that I could convince you to take notes for me?”
“I know,” Sam responded, raising his hands in silent surrender, “I tried asking Dean to explain it to me, but he won’t talk about it.” -he cleared his throat- “You have every right to tell me to shove it right now, but can I ask you to tell me what happened?”
“You mean, other than the broken leg and the slash to my side?” Dean asked, shifting in his seat and dropping his eyes down to the mug sitting in front of him. He gripped the mug in both hands and drummed his fingers on the side.
As Dean crunched through the thin layer of snow already coating the sidewalk, a singular tear escaped his eye, leaving a freezing trail of moisture down his cheek. He reached up and brushed the tear off and pulled his hat down lower on his head. The cold bit and the wind cut through his jacket like it was tissue. Dean left his apartment in a rush and only thought to grab his hat and scarf off the hook by the door, neglecting to retrieve his coat from the hall closet. He trudged through the accumulating snow until he arrived at the front doorstep to Charlie Bradbury’s brownstone.
“HELL YEAH LITTLE BRO! Did you expect anything else from me?” Gabe’s over-enthusiastic voice chirped on the other end of the line. “How the hell are you on this fine American holiday?”
Cas’s mind was reeling. There he stood in their master bathroom, staring at his husband of 5 years in the costume of Cain, his archnemesis. The same supervillain that had just kicked his ass up and down Market Street and the Financial District earlier that night. How could he not have known? How had Dean been able to keep this secret from him? How long had this been going on? Once Castiel stopped to think about it, he had been fighting Cain ever since he was strong enough to fight on his own, after Balthazar, his mentor and trainer, had retired. God that was nearly 10 years ago. Well, if Cas had been able to keep his double life a secret, he shouldn’t be surprised that Dean had been able to do the same thing.
“Dean Winchester, you are just confused because you haven’t seen him in a while, and now you’re seeing him again and everyone is asking you about him. You never got proper closure when you broke up,”- he forced himself to meet his eyes in the mirror-” you are confused.”
Garth’s comment about Castiel’s hair was left hanging in the silence between the three men. Garth wheeled Dean in his gurney until Castiel reached out and took the other handle. Dean hadn’t taken his eyes off Castiel since he was taken out of the back of the ambulance, it was almost as if he couldn't believe the sight he was seeing. After over two years, he was in contact with Castiel Novak once more.
The image in front of him blurred and fell out of focus, he could still smell the burning rubber and sweet fragrance of coolant from the other car. He could barely make out his mom’s face, her blonde curls. The rest of this memory was fading, slowly being replaced with something else.
20 minutes and 10 different message variations later, and Dean had settled on the perfect message to send. One that wasn’t too emotional or aloof.
“Dean, I am so sorry, “ Cas said, his voice cracked and gravelly. He peeled his eyes from their interlocked hands and looked back up at Dean, tears welled up in his eyes, threatening to spill over.
“You’re right,” Sam said, sitting up straighter, dropping his hands into his lap, “I don’t know the full story, I got some of it from Dean, but I don’t know what you went through. I was there to pick up the pieces after, but I didn’t see how they fell apart. Can you tell me what happened?”
He was feeling so much that he wanted to cry to express it. This was a man that, despite the hell he had been through, loved more deeply than another he had ever met. Everything he did was drenched in love for those close to him. This was a man that had secretly applied to jobs in Boston after Cas had been accepted to his dream medical school only to plan an elaborate evening to surprise Cas with his job offer at a local school. Dean wanted to move halfway across the country with him.
Well, it would have been perfect had Dean not ruined everything. First, the pie crust was too thin and tore in several places, forcing him to piece it back together and ruin the perfect lines of the pie. Then, he overcooked the chicken to the point that it was rubbery. Then to top it all off, he burned his hand pulling the pie out of the oven and dropped the dish on the floor, shattering the pie pan and splattering pie all over the kitchen.
“What?” - Dean snapped his head back towards Castiel, completely unaware that the man had been talking to him - “Sorry, what did you say?”
“DEAN WINCHESTER YOU NO-GOOD COMMUNICATING SON OF A-” - the front door slammed and the full-bodied voice of Joanna Beth filled the small apartment as she busted through the entry hall into the living room - ”BITCH!”
Cas didn’t have time to take a breath before Dean’s lips were  against his. Pressed against each other in the small bathroom, they shared the same breath. Dean hooked a leg around Cas’s waist and spread his legs to pull them closer together. Cas ran his hands down Dean’s chest playing with the buttons only done halfway up, slowly undoing them. The music outside was loud enough for them to hear in the bathroom. Their breaths fell in line with the beat, as the tempo increased, so did their movements. Cas rocked against Dean, creating friction between them. Dean responded with a moan and tightening his grip in Cas’s hair.
“Thank you for sharing that with me, Dean. If you ever feel like talking about it, just let me know.”
Cas’s keys fell to the ground with a small *clink* and he felt heat rise in his cheeks as he swallowed back tears. His mouth went dry and he clenched his jaw to keep from screaming.
“What the hell took you so long to get out here??” Dean asked, inhaling sharply as Meg pressed a rag against his abdomen to stop the bleeding.
“Yeah Dean, of course! You know I’m always down for cheap chinese food!” Garth said while giving Dean a hardy high-five. “And you!” he pointed at Castiel, “You take good care of my man, Dean here, bye Doc! Until next time!” Garth turned away and hopped back into the ambulance, leaving Dean in the care of Castiel and his nursing team.
Of course, Dean. I have a couple of free nights this week if that was what you had in mind? Or would you prefer to meet for coffee again?
Castiel blushed, he turned his head away from Dean as he felt the blood rush to his cheeks and neck. Dean’s praise nearly put him over the edge. He had always been Castiel’s biggest fan and support system during school, he pushed Castiel to study and to be the best that he could be. Dean was the one who stayed up all night with him going over flashcards and letting Castiel teach him about ATP production and creating MCAT practice questions. It was always expected that Dean would be there to celebrate him graduating med school, that Dean would also be recognized for all his work along the way. Castiel thought back to graduation day, to how he felt as he scanned the crowd, looking for Dean’s dazzling green eyes and smile.  It broke Castiel’s heart again remembering that Dean hadn’t been there.
As he moved around the apartment, he looked at all the photographs that were hanging on the walls, at the happy, blissful memories of his brother and dear friend as they started their lives together. He couldn’t stop the weight from settling in his stomach, or the pain he felt in his heart for these two men that were obviously head over heels for each other. He knew that their feelings would not change for each other, that while someday they may put themselves back together, they would never be whole until they found each other again.
Dean crawled on the mattress until he was over Cas, eye to eye, his hands on either side of Cas’s face with Cas’s fingers back in his hair. He bent down and gently kissed Cas, his best friend, his lover, his partner.
He grabbed his left elbow and bent his arm behind his head, pulling the elbow into a deep stretch. He took full, purposeful breaths and concentrated on the areas of his body that were holding too much tension. The previous 16 and a half hours had taken their toll on his joints and muscles. He originally was only supposed to be in this hospital for his usual 12 hours, but of course some intern came down with the flu and good-for-nothing Gordon Walker suggested his name for a replacement. Castiel shook his head, ‘it was December in a cold city, of course the flu is going around; why aren’t these doctors and nurses taking it more seriously and taking care of themselves?’ he thought to himself.
Dean slumped down onto his bed, hair still wet and a towel wrapped around his waist. He stared down at the phone screen in his hand. The cursor blinked mockingly from his Text chat. His mouth went dry and he struggled to swallow. He quickly wiped his sweating palms on the towel and clenched his jaw.
Dean looked away from his phone blushing, he was still clad only in his underwear and couldn’t  pull himself away from the text thread. Butterflies filled his stomach and he couldn’t remember the last time that he was so excited to see someone again. The ease of the conversation and the afterglow that he was in confirmed his earlier suspicions. He did have feelings for Castiel and needed to figure out what to do about them.
“Of course, Dean, and honestly? I had nothing else planned for today so I’m not missing anything to be here. Besides” -Castiel reached out and placed a hand over Dean’s - “I meant what I said about reconnecting and”-Castiel was interrupted by the sound of keys clinking in the hall and a lock being turned in the front door. He looked down at his hand resting on Dean’s and pulled it back to his chest as though he had burned it.
As he basked in the gentle morning sunlight, his thoughts began to clear, shaking the sleep and lust off. His eyes flew open in shock, the post-nut clarity filled his mind as he realized what exactly happened. Dean sat up in bed and looked down at his chest and stomach, covered in his own semen, he whispered to himself, “I just jerked off to Cas”.
“Don’t you dare talk to me in that tone of voice,” Castiel said, nearly in a whisper, not trusting himself to not break, “you don’t know the full story, you weren’t there.”
“That’s why you shouldn’t be the one to help him, Dean!” -Cas threw his arms out and leaned forward at the hips- “You’re too close to this!”
“What a fight today, huh? Also, that was an impressive last speech you gave, declaring your defeat and all.” Cas teased from the kitchen as he grabbed two beers from the fridge.
Thank you for all the comments and kudos!!! I hope that this one is enough to hold you over until next week!
They had been at the party for about 2 hours and Cas found his slumped on a couch with a beer, questioning how he found himself at this stupid frat house. Dean was nowhere to be seen, it seemed to Cas that he disappeared as soon as they arrived. Dean was probably caught up with his actual friends, Cas thought, and he was probably only invited as a partner to Dean’s costume.
Dean remembered being at a friend’s house and feeling sick. He had called his mom to come pick him up and take him home. He was upset because it was his first overnight sleepover and despite being nervous, he was excited to be there. He thought maybe his mom would bring Sammy to pick him up but now he was thankful Sammy wasn’t there.
Dean stood in the silence of his apartment wishing that he hadn’t just sent away his only company. He cursed under his breath at his inability to talk through what he was thinking and feeling. All Sam wanted was to be there for him, to be a shoulder for Dean to lean on and all Dean kept doing was pushing his brother away. And now that he had something that he needed to work through, there was no one around.
“Uh, yeah” -Dean took a deep breath- “my head just hurts and I can’t believe we’ve only done like, 6 freakin stairs,” Dean replied, matched Castiel’s tone and volume.
Castiel exhaled a shallow breath that he didn’t know he had been holding. Who would have thought that hearing that Dean wanted to be his friend would bring him such relief?
“Dean, at least to me, and when it comes to Castiel, you’re like an open book,” she reached across the couch to lay a hand on his arm, “you have more to say.”
“I understand that you chose your brother over me, truly I do. I just hope you know that you are severely out of bounds if you assume that this wasn’t hard on me too. You never called or wrote to check on me, you never contacted my brother, whom I know you were close to, you began dating one of my closest colleagues and neither of you mentioned it to me. Do not begin to understand what these past two years have been for me, Samuel Winchester.”
Cas stood before him in the living room and Dean was able to appreciate fully the effort that Cas had gone through. He hadn’t noticed before, but Cas was wearing dark blue slacks with a white button-down and a matching dark blue tie. The top button was undone and the knot of his tie was loose. Cas’s eyes were red-rimmed and his shirt sleeves were rolled up, revealing his forearms. Dean ran his eyes up and down over Cas, understanding that his night had been just as rough as his own.
“Dude, I’m serious, I’m asking you.” Dean said, reaching across the table and gently grabbing Cas’s wrist.
Their first kiss was clumsy with clashing teeth and sloppy tongues but Cas’s nerves were electric. He had dreamed about this moment, about how Dean would feel pressed up against him, about whether or not Dean wanted this too. They remained in this moment, the two men sharing the same air, finally caving into the feelings they held for each other. Finally admitting that they needed each other like a drowning man needs air.
Something as easy as outlining a paper should have taken Dean 30 minutes to an hour at the most, however, the events of that night had caught up to him and he couldn’t bring himself to focus on the words on the screen. Typos galore sat in front of him, painfully highlighted by the red squiggles.
“Yeah, that has to explain it, I haven’t gotten laid in a while, i just saw Cas, who was always fucking fantastic in bed, and my brain just put two and two together,” Dean said out loud, needing to hear the words to believe the lie, “Shit, ~Castiel~ not Cas”.
Castiel shook himself out of his stupor. He had kept this guy waiting while he ogled his good looks, way to go bud.
“Oh my god, I should not have asked.” Cas spat out quickly, cutting Dean off before he had the chance to respond. “I should not be prying into your business and we barely know each other and I don’t want to make you uncomfortable and please let me think of literally anything else that we can talk about oh my god I can’t believe that I did that, I don’t know what possessed me to ask-”
“I’m gonna get a shower and get ready for bed, ok? The trash bags still under the sink?” Dean said, clapping Sam on the shoulder as he eased himself up off the couch.
“Cas, this kid is in trouble. His name is Jack and he’s in deep with some shit at home and I don’t know what to do. I was talking to this kid, Jack, and he seemed real shifty, real nervous, and when I asked him just a couple of questions about his classwork, he wouldn’t look me in the eyes, Cas. He fidgeted a lot and wouldn’t take his eyes off the desktop in front of him. Cas, we sat there for I’m not even sure how long before the kid finally cracked. I just asked him if he would rather I send the classwork home with him for a week or two, so that he’d have more time to focus on it and work on it.”
“Heya Jo! Happy Thanksgiving” - Sam waved into the camera -” Uh, I guess I don’t even know where to guess?”
“Oh, ok. I’m not sure what I thought I heard but I guess it's cool that y’all met up. It’s been a while.” Sam replied, his tone even and unaffected. Dean breathed a sigh of relief, if Sam had caught his slipup, at least he didn’t draw attention to it.
“You heard me. Stay. Away. From. Dean.” Sam crossed his arms in front of his chest, content to end the conversation there.
Gabe crossed the room, unbuckling Tucker from the baby carrier as he took careful steps towards Castiel. His mind quickly recalled the memories of the first month or so after he collected his brother’s belongings from Dean’s apartment. Castiel had asked him to take his key and retrieve his clothes and textbooks, that he couldn’t go back and do it himself. Armed with a list of supplies and Dean’s schedule, Gabe dumped the contents of his brother’s drawers in the dresser into a laundry. He gathered Castiel’s clothing from the closet, and his books from the bookshelf in the living room and gently placed them in the duffel bag he brought along.
“I can even meet you for coffee or lunch or something else next week! Maybe Wednesday between our lectures and kinda give you a rundown of what you missed! Let me give you my number!”
There was silence on the other end. Castiel was about to open his mouth to ask if  Gabe was still there when he heard a door close on his brother’s end of the call.
Cas stared at Dean. No one had described him like this or had even taken the time to  dissect why he was interested in medicine in the first place. He was just written off as the greedy son of two doctors who was just following in the family business of saving people and curing disease.
“Have you been waiting long? I know I was a little late-” Dean said, removing his phone from his pocket to check the time.
“Uh, Hi,” Castiel said, stumbling over his words as he hurriedly wiped the palm of his hand on his jeans to dry off the sweat. “My name is Castiel Novak and I just moved here from Pontiac, Illinois.” He held his hand out for the man to shake.
He released the breath he had been holding and laughed in relief. Castiel was just as interested, he wasn’t just being nice when he told Dean that he wanted to get together sometime.
“Yeah man! I can be there in 20!” Charlie’s bubbly voice sounded through the phone after a palpable pause. Dean knew that she was on to him but if she didn’t ask, he wasn’t going to tell.
“Ok,” Gabriel said, breaking the silence. He raised his mug to take a drink and when he brought it back down, a whipped cream mustache was left behind. “Spill the tea, Castiel, why did you call me like you did?”
“Hm ok,” Cas released his breath, “you said that he got there and was still upset, what else did he say?”
“Dean? Sweetheart, look at me,” Mary tilted her son’s face up so their eyes met, “you are going to be ok, baby, I promise, angels are watching over you.”
Dean knew that he should ask Castiel to leave, that this day had stretched out for far too long and he needed rest, but there was something about his being here that was… comfortable and familiar. Despite the pain that Dean still felt whenever he thought about this other man, and the weight that was currently resting on his chest, Dean didn’t know if he wanted Castiel to leave. Dean’s discomfort must have been painted across his face, because after only a handful of seconds sitting in silence, Castiel awkwardly and sheepishly picked up his things.
“Erm, Hi guys I don’t mean to interrupt but my name is Becky and i’ll be your server this morning! Are we ready to order drinks or do you still need a couple of minutes?”
“You do not still love Castiel Novak,” -he closed his eyes and gulped hard, taking a deep breath, he opened his eyes and continued- “you met him at a pivotal point in your life and you haven’t let anyone else in like you did.”
Dean finally looked over at Charlie and knew in his gut that he had made the right decision in asking her to come over. To be honest, he did need to talk about what the hell was going on with Castiel and this pit that was growing in his stomach about it.
“Well I’m glad that I was able to help you locate him. He’s been here for a few hours now, since about 12:30 when he came in all hot about some fight y’all done had, went straight to my fridge and downed quite a few drinks pretty damn quickly too,” Benny said very matter of factly, as though this was not the first time this had happened, and it very easily wasn’t the first time.
“Dean-” Castiel’s voice came out in a sharp hiss- “this is why I wanted someone with you for a couple of days.” He stabilized Dean on his feet then dropped his hands back to his side. “It’s common for people with concussions to become very dizzy, especially when they exert themselves trying to go upstairs.”
His stomach flipped and his neck was hot. Grinning like a teenager he pictured meeting Cas for a quiet drink out, the lights dim in the bar and the music loud enough that they have to lean in close to hear each other. Maybe they’d get some bar snacks, like nachos or something to split, and their hands would meet, leading to more physical contact.
“Jess, Dean went to the ER today and this is the first I’m hearing of it.” - Sam whipped his head back from Jess and stared intensely at Dean through the camera- “Wait, Jo called me to tell me about who she found in your apartment, what does that have to do with you going to the hospital?”
“Heh, thanks anyway Charles, anything would do right now,” Dean replied, his voice cracking and rough.
Dean was overwhelmed. His brain tried to fit the pieces together. His stomach churned with the guilt of not giving Cas enough credit, of assuming that this angel would rather toss him out on the street than be asked to treat him as an equal. John’s words about the kind of man Dean was roared in his mind throughout most of his life and their only equal, their only true adversary, were the words that left Castiel’s mouth every time he talked about Dean. With every declaration of love and gratitude, the volume of the roar diminished.
“That’s it? You’re not going to keep asking me what’s wrong?” Dean asked, his hands held out to the side in an imploring stance.
The two men sat across from each other with only the sounds of Cas’s muffled sobs breaking the silence around them. After a minute or two, Cas had calmed enough to take deep, steady breaths. His body ceased its racking cries and his tears dried.
While he was proud of himself for opening up, for sharing that part of himself with someone who had been to hell and back with him, he couldn’t believe Charlie accused him of still being in love with Castiel. He didn’t say anything to her at the moment, he neither confirmed nor denied.
“... uh, oh Yeah, haha thanks man for the pep talk on the way here. And Hey, don’t forget to shoot me a text when you get off later.” Dean replied somewhat distractedly, quickly shifting his eyes from Castiel back to Garth.
Without greeting, Dean flung the fridge door open and in one swift motion, grabbed the nearest beer and popped the top in one hand, little drops of spray coating his hand. He gulped the beer down as Cas watched in stunned silence from the living room. Dean swallowed and set the empty can down on the counter next to him before breathing deep and looking back at Cas. The two held eye contact for several seconds before Cas finally broke the silence.
“Dean, of course I will, how could you even think you need to ask?” Cas responded, his eyes twinkling in wonder at the man sitting in front of him.
When Dean took his next step, he was only a little surprised to find that Castiel had taken most of his weight off his feet. Dean taking steps up these stairs was only a formality because Castiel was essentially carrying him. He was thankful that Castiel left his feet on the floor, while he recognized that he would not have made it up to his apartment without Castiel’s help, he still felt a little ashamed that he was still relying on this man to carry more than his fair share of weight. He was glad that he could at least pretend to do something for himself.
“One hour Mister! 11:30.” - she tapped her wrist and raised her eyebrows at him - “then you gotta get outta here and patch things up with Dr. Sexy In-Training!” She smirked and quietly left the room, closing the door behind her.
“That was it, that was the question that opened the door. So Jack tensed up at this suggestion ok, this kid finally looked up at me and, while looking me dead in the eyes, told me that his dad, Nick, is a drunk and abusive and that he hasn’t been able to sleep or concentrate on anything, that he’s having some real trouble at home,” -Dean paused to take a quick breath, the words tumbling out of his mouth, unable to stop now that he’s started- “Jack’s mom died in childbirth and it sounds like this kid’s dad, Nick, blames him for it and as the years passed, he fell more and more into a depression and hatred towards Jack. Nick’s pressuring him to contribute more around the house, to earn his keep. He’s telling his kid, his own son, that he’s useless, and won’t amount to anything without his help.
The cool, even tone of Cas’s voice hit Dean like a truck. The lack of emotion, the palpable silence that filled the room afterwards. Dean’s stomach dropped and he worked his fingers in and out of fists at his side. A wave of inadequacy washed over Dean, his partner was no longer interested in what was going on in his life. His boyfriend was now too busy for him and didn’t care to help him through his issues anymore. The heaviest blow was Cas’s stab at Benny. It became painfully obvious to Dean that Cas was jealous of Benny, that Cas trusted Dean so little that he considered Benny to be a threat.
“Nothing, Cas, everything’s peachy, can’t you tell?” Dean replied, his eyes rolling before moving to throw the empty can in the recycling bin.
Dean remained silent while he was wheeled into his room, listening to Castiel’s nurses as they briefed him on Dean’s condition.
“Dean?” Castiel choked out, finally finding his voice, “What are you doing here? I thought you had plans tonight?”
“Whoever said I needed you to help me?” Dean shot back, his words cutting through the air like a hot knife through butter. His words left Cas stunned long enough for Dean to push past him and out of the room.
“That would be the one.” Dean answered simply, his anxiety increasing as he watched Charlie pace. If her reaction was anything to base his family’s feelings about Castiel on, he might as well stuff his own feelings down.
Transfixed, Cas found a seat on the couch, his eyes never leaving Dean. He had seen him play shows at some of the local bars, but he had never been graced with a private show, never been serenaded. He took in the lyrics, the words dripping in Dean’s honey maple drawl. He let the words fill him with love and pride.
“Dude, awesome!” Dean interrupted, shooting two thumbs up at Cas before grabbing his book bag and standing from the table. “Ok the plan, meet me at my place around like 7 and we can head over together! I gotta run but I’ll see you tonight!”
When Gabe arrived at Castiel’s apartment, his knocks went unanswered. He used his own key and rushed into his brother’s bedroom. He breathed a sigh of relief to find that Castiel was alive and breathing, just stuck in his own mind and world, oblivious to his surroundings.
“We watch the old Dune movie from the 80’s, the new one is in the works and I want to be reminded of how the original one was so I can put all my expectations in order.” She said, practically vibrating with excitement.
The hour passed in what seemed like the blink of an eye. Dean hadn’t slept, not that he expected to. He asked Charlie for the time to gather his thoughts, to prepare himself for this conversation with Cas. His mind whirred like a broken machine, flashes of the potential outcomes for this conversation danced through his brain. Dean knew that he should give Cas the benefit of the doubt, that he would probably take this conversation and Dean’s concerns seriously and not storm out. Or he would decide that Dean wasn’t worth the trouble, that he wasn’t the push-over caretaker that he had signed up for. Despite his better judgment, this was the conclusion Dean had settled on.
“I dunno man, like” - Sam lifted his hands in a defeated motion, dropping them onto the couch cushions next to him- “When we met I was just some dumb college kid that broke his arm on a stupid dare, I know she just thought of me as some frat guy that would do anything to get a laugh out of his friends. She told me that after we started going out. There’s no way I’m the kind of person that she saw herself with. Why wouldn’t she say no?”
“So, honey, huh?” Dean asked, sitting up straighter in his seat. Cas noted the shift in Dean’s posture and wondered if his moan had anything to do with it. Shaking off this thought, he responded.
“Heya there Doc Novak!” Garth called out across the carport with a friendly wave, “See man, what did I tell ya? Didn’t I promise a fantastic doctor with hair that just won’t quit?!” Garth looked back towards Dean and said with a clap to his left shoulder.
This thought snapped him back into the moment and he felt his chest tighten as he realized that Cain’s costume changed from a dark grey to this deep blue color about 5 years back.
The figure in Dean’s mind released his cock with a soft ‘pop’. They knelt back to watch Dean unravel, taking in the sight of Dean unraveling before them, savoring the moment. Dean’s eyes traced over this figure, fully taking in the beauty of their appearance, their lean muscles pulled taut over broad shoulders and firm abdomen. Their rough, calloused hands grazed over the sensitive skin of Dean’s inner thighs and he arched into their touch.
“Ok,” -Cas closed his eyes and took a deep breath, before opening them again and continuing- “I’ve been thinking about this a lot and please hear me out before you cut me off. But I think you should consider visiting your mother’s grave for Mother’s day with me this year.-”
Dean took a deep breath, his eyebrows furrowed and his fists clenched at his sides. He turned and grabbed a water bottle out of a cooler sitting on the floor near them.
“NO,” Sam nearly yelled, smacking his hands on the bench next to him, “I don’t think that you hear me! I don't know what you want me to say, or what you need to hear from me to get it through your head. What could possibly explain what happened and why you think that it’s a good idea to get involved in my brother’s life again?” Sam stood and turned his back on Castiel.
“…oh, you're still there? I…uh .. just thought that would have moved out of there, well, a while ago”.
“I was there, where were you?” Castiel shot back, hoping to redirect this guilt away from him and onto Sam. He finally learned that the weight of the world no longer rested on his shoulders, that the emotions and actions of others were not his responsibility, that he wasn’t the only person to let Dean down. Sam should accept that.
Cas then grabbed the bottom of Dean’s shirt, lifting it off over his head and tossed it on the floor next to their bed. He ran his hands over Dean’s chest, taking in the landscape of muscles and scars, his fingers lightly lingering over Dean’s waist as he tilted his head up to continue kissing Dean.
Dean stepped forward out of Cas’s touch and turned around to face him. Cas was looking down at his feet and Dean softly placed his hand under Cas’s chin to turn his gaze back to him.
“Dean, is the air ma-” *whump*  “-ttress going to hold me?” Cas asked as Dean dropped him onto the air mattress  that did hold him.
Gabe looked at his brother, worried that he would regress to where he had been two years ago. When Castiel glanced back at him, he seemed sad and confronted with a devastating past, but not broken, not like before. Castiel turned his attention back to Tucker, bouncing him on his knee and cooing softly at the infant. As he watched Castiel play with his son, Gabe was no longer worried that his brother would fall into as deep a depression as before, that this was a hiccup for him. His original hypothesis that Dean and Castiel would put themselves back together with one very important piece of themselves missing was proven to be correct, at least for Castiel. And he had good reason to believe that the same was true for Dean.
“Ok, Cassie, hold on, me and Tucker will be there in a jiffy.” Gabe hung up the phone and grabbed his youngest child to go.
“Sam, of course I do,” Cas said, his voice firm and even, as though he was stating an obvious fact like the sky being blue, “I have been in love with your brother since the day we met 9 years ago.”
Cas’s fingers worked their way to the waistband of Dean’s pants. He fumbled with the buckle, desperate to remove this barrier between them, to get them out of these clothes. He pulled away from Dean’s mouth and moved to his neck. Cas kissed and sucked at the soft skin on Dean’s neck and around his collarbones, pulling moans from Dean. Every breathless moan and croak of his name from Dean’s mouth went straight to Cas’s dick.
“Dean was not well, he hadn’t been for a while, probably since we first met or even before then, but I didn’t truly appreciate the pain that he was in until the end. Or if I’m being honest, when we first moved up here. Dean feels every emotion much more acutely than anyone else I’ve ever met, he sees himself in the worst possible light, and he is his own worst enemy and critic. Well, I guess I should say that he was, I don’t really know him anymore.” Castiel said, stopping to give Sam a woeful glance.
Cas’s voice broke on the last word. He clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle the cry that threatened to erupt from his person. His knees buckled and he almost fell. Sam jumped up from his seat and guided Cas down to the bench off to his side.
Dean’s heart dropped as Cas wrapped him up, guilt flooded his mind. This man was too good for him, here was a shining star that had his own stress and difficulties to deal with and was still willing to take on whatever crap Dean has. Ashamed that he couldn’t handle his own problems, Dean buried his face in Cas’s shoulder and gripped the man tightly in his own arms.
Castiel arrived at the coffee shop an hour before his scheduled meeting with Dean. he told himself that he wanted to get there early so that he could work on other assignments before meeting Dean. But in reality, he was too nervous to be anywhere else. He was kept up the night before with various ‘what-ifs’ running through his head. ‘What if he tried to take the bus and it was delayed?’ ‘What if he decided to walk there 15 minutes before and he was sweaty and a mess by the time he got there?’ ‘What if Dean was early?’ ‘What if he got the time wrong and Dean thought he stood him up??’
“Do you think he knows you feel this way? Have you told him?” Charlie said, leaning forward and down to meet Dean’s eyes, “and I mean really told him, not just passive-aggressively grumbled around the apartment until he noticed.”
Dean and Castiel sat in silence for a few minutes. Dean sat with his hands gripped together in his lap, Castiel could tell that he wanted to cross his arms the way he likes to when he’s angry, but he couldn’t because of his stitches. After all this time, Dean was so similar to the man he knew, but there was so much about him that he didn’t know. Those two years spent apart meant more to Dean’s development than Castiel would’ve thought, he had lost that time with Dean, and he didn’t want anymore years to slip by without the company of Dean Winchester. He struggled only for a moment with what he would say next.
“No, Cas, I think you meant to tell me that I should butt the hell out of this and YOU know I can’t do that.”
Catching up with the day to day of young Dr. Novak. Another surprise reunion might shed some light on someone's past, present, and future?
“Wait, if Sam is out of town, why are you in town alone?” Castiel interrupted, momentarily forgetting that he was the professional in this situation, and that Dean didn’t owe him any explanations.
Dean didn’t need to be told twice, slowly pulling out of Cas until he was almost completely out of him, before slamming back in. Nearly hitting that spot on his first try. Cas’s vision whited out and he gripped Dean’s back and shoulders to ground himself. He knew that there would be fingertip shaped bruises and scratches down Dean’s back when all was said and done, but hey, more evidence of his claim on him right?
“Ah yeah, Jessica, his longtime girlfriend now, I imagine that he’ll be asking her to formally join the family sooner or later now. She fits in great, kinda tall, take no shit kinda attitude. Guess you have to be tough like that to be a nurse in Boston.”
“You gonna look at your menu or are you gonna keep eyeing me like that?” Dean asked without taking his eyes off his menu, a playful tone to his voice.
Castiel’s stomach dropped, creating a pit deep inside him. He wanted to ask who Pamela was but the words caught in his mouth. He knew that it had been too long since either of them said anything and they were falling into an uncomfortable silence, he needed to say something, needed to respond.
I am so sorry for the delay in updating, the end of the semester came at me hard but I'm hoping to get this chapter and another posted shortly :D
“I’m going to drop you,” Dean had stopped walking, they were in the bedroom now. Cas had been able to find a couple of pallets outside and brought them in to set the air mattress on top of so that they wouldn’t sleep on the floor.
“Dean? Baby, are you okay?” Mary responded, her voice flat. She stretched her arm back towards Dean and her fingers didn't quite make it to him.
“Uh-huh, sure it wasn’t” -Sam raised an eyebrow, not believing a word from his brother- “But seriously, how are you doing?”
“Hey Charles! Everything’s good,” Dean replied, hoping that his voice sounded steadier than  he felt. “I was wondering if you  wanted to come over and marathon old sci-fi movies  with me?”
“So, you have a large incision wound to your abdomen, a broken femur, and possibly a concussion? Want to tell me what happened to you?” Castiel asked pointedly, his back to Dean while he snapped on fresh gloves.
“Yeah princess I know, that’s why I’m concerned, I don’t want you rushing into anything and while I want you to get out there again, I’m not sure that a traumatized, single mom is the move for you right now.” Meg said, grabbing Dean’s hand to give it a soft squeeze.
On his next pump, Dean did find Cas’s prostate, each roll of his hips now pulling gasps and moans out of the other man. Cas wrapped his legs around Dean’s wasit, keeping him as close as possible.
Dean maintains eye contact with this guy and slowly raises his hands to show him that there was nothing in them. He sidesteps across the sidewalk until he’s between the man and the woman.
“Yeah, it's from an accident a couple weeks ago. Nothing super serious, I was helping this woman and kid out from this creepy guy on the street. The guy lunged at me with a blade, nicked me,” -Dean lifted up the bottom of his shirt to show Charlie the healing cut, ignoring her gasp- “And I jumped back away from the guy and” -Dean clapped his hands together- “this car hit me, broke my leg.”
“Excuse me? You don’t think that this is something worth talking about? That I should just ignore how miserable you still are?” Cas asked, nearly screaming at Dean. He threw his hands up at Dean in disbelief, “What about all the times I’ve heard you cry and ask for her, Dean? Do you expect me to just forget about your nightmares?
~Dean, I am absolutely crazy about you and I need to get this off my chest before I say yes to going to this party tonight. I don’t know how you feel but I figured it was early enough in our friendship that we could either work through this if you don’t feel the same way, or, well, if you were uncomfortable by my feelings, I don’t think I would be completely, irreversibly devastated by your loss if I were to lose you over this. Please let me know what you think~
Whenever Dean was the one to leave, Castiel found that coming home to a clean apartment took some of the stress and tension out of the situation. Leaving them to just focus on the actual topic at hand rather than getting deflecting to something else.
Gabe sat silently for a minute, watching Castiel and Tucker, trying to figure out what to say next. The words sat on the tip of his tongue but he refused to give them air.
As they turned onto Dean’s street, his stomach dropped and his heart clenched in the anticipation of having Castiel back inside his apartment. Castiel pulled the car to a stop and looked over at Dean, whose eyes were glued to the living room window of his second-story place.
It was November in Boston and Dean was able to spend his Thanksgiving in his favorite coffee shop without the usual hustle and bustle. His pea coat, hat, and scarf hung up on the coat rack by the door, Dean was enjoying his cayenne pepper cappuccino by the small electric fireplace in the center of the shop. He looked up from his laptop to see Meg and Jo on either side of the counter playing a game of paper football. The shop was slow but Dean was glad that Meg decided to open her shop at all that day. Usually she accompanied her boyfriend, Alfie, home for all holidays but the two were in the middle of a fight and they decided that they should take a break this holiday and cool off. Jo was still in town because she knew that Dean didn’t have any plans and wanted to make sure that someone was with him for Thanksgiving. Dean appreciated that his friends were still concerned about him, and he knew that they meant well, but he was quickly growing tired of the constant streams of babysitters that were in his life. Regardless, Dean was thankful that Jo didn’t travel back to Lawrence this year. While he was doing better, he agreed that he was nervous at the prospect of spending a major holiday by himself.
“Heya Dean, whatcha been up to this morning?” Sam called out as Dean crutched past him into the kitchen.
“Dean, I knew as soon as I heard the door slam behind you, that I had fucked up something awful.” - Cas gave Dean’s hands a gentle squeeze, as though he was trying to ground himself in this moment - “I knew I was wrong, and I wanted to call you back here and -and- and, just apologize then. But I know you, and I know that you just needed time to be mad at me. And while it hurt me to let you leave, and to let you feel these feelings, I, uh, also needed time to work on something.” Cas stumbled over his words before looking around the room, drawing Dean’s attention once again to their surroundings.
Unfortunately, Dean was busy with other plans tonight and could not be here to play guest to Castiel’s pity party. Cas hadn’t actually seen Dean in a couple of days, in between Dean’s shifts at the Roadhouse and Cas practically living in the library and studying for finals, there hadn’t been a lot of time for just the two of them. And tonight? Even though Castiel was finally free of his undergraduate course work, Dean had plans that he could not get out of.
Cas stood just out of Dean’s reach, his arms crossed in front of his chest, his mouth held in a tight line. Dean clenched his jaw and his radiant green eyes grew dark. The tension built in the room around them, the air between them grew thick, nearly suffocating with unvoiced words and emotion.
She pulled her hand back from Dean’s face and moved to wrap an arm around his shoulders. Dean leaned into her and allowed himself to be held, thankful for the warm contact.
“Alright students!” the instructor at the front of the room clapped his hands together, collecting the attention of his class. “Now that we’re all here, welcome to Biology 101! My name is Dr. Crowley but you can call me Crowley.” The short man paced in front of the class, his arms crossed in front of him.
Dean sniffled and rubbed away the tears that were forming in his eyes again. He looked up at the clock on Charlie’s nightstand.10:24 pm. Charlie let him in around 8 and he sat on her bed trying to work out whether two and a half hours had been enough time to work himself up to facing Cas again.
Castiel sat dumbfounded, the connection between his brain and his mouth fried as brain short circuited. Dean got a job in Boston? They could go together?
“Mom?” Dean asked weakly, his voice small against the screaming from outside the car. “Mommy?” he asked again, desperate for an answer, reaching for the woman stirring in the seat in front of him.
“For the longest time, I didn’t think I deserved someone who would take care of me,” Dean continued, “I believed that my lot in life was to parent Sam and that my happiness didn’t matter, and frankly? Some days I’m still not convinced that it does. But Cas made me want to believe that, he makes me happier than I ever envisioned myself being. I want to be better for him, I want to want to be valued.” - Dean gestured with his hands, placing them on his chest, breathless-  “For the first several years we were together, I pushed myself to see myself in a fraction of the light that Cas did. It was my main motivation to work through my shit and my past issues, but now? I don’t feel like a partner” - Dean dropped his hands into his lap, his eyes following them down- “ I feel like a parent again, like someone to mechanically cook, clean, and keep a roof over Cas’s head without his help.”
“I just wanted to go over your results before I discharged you today. Your X-ray did show that there is a small crack in your right femur, granted this is nothing severe and I’m going to get you fitted for a light cast so that the bone can set and do its job of healing you naturally. I’m also sending you home with crutches, I don’t want you putting weight on your right leg for one month until we can get you in for a follow up scan. Now, as for your concussion. I am a little more worried about that one. Do you have someone to stay with you for a couple of days?” Castiel sat down in the chair across from Dean and spoke quickly.
“-Babe, please, I asked you to hear me out.” -Cas dropped his hands, finding one of Dean’s and weaving their fingers together- “I want to meet your mother, I know I can’t physically talk to her but I want to know where she is, I want to talk to her and thank her for giving me this wonderful person. We’ve been together for 6 and a half years and we hardly ever talk about her, Dean” -Cas squeezed Dean’s hand lightly- “I barely know anything about her.”
Castiel hung his head, eyes boring a hole into the floor between his feet. He concentrated on slowing his heart, on taking deep breaths. Count to 3 on the inhale. Count to 5 on the exhale. Repeat.
“Ugh, fine.” Dan said, dramatically rolling his eyes at his best friend. He was willing to give in to Charlie it if meant ending what could only be an agonizing conversation about Castiel.
“Dean-” Castiel took a deep breath, “I want to apologize, I think we got off on the wrong foot today. There’s a lot unsaid between us and I don’t want us to part again on bad, or any sort of unpleasant terms. Please, let me just say that I want to be on good terms with you again. I want to know who you are, again.” Castiel could see Dean’s eyes widening.
“I have one important question for you,” She said in a stern tone that managed to pull Dean’s attention away from the Star Trek Timeline Poster on her wall and back on her. “Dean, do you love Castiel still?”
“You have been working so hard to keep a roof over both of our heads,” Cas said, his voice breaking with every word, “You cook” - Cas brought Dean’s right hand up and placed a gentle kiss to it - “and you clean” - Cas kissed the back of Dean’s left hand - “and you’ve never asked me to sacrifice a minute of my schooling for help.” - Cas held both of Dena’s hands tightly between his own, pulling them to his chest - “I don’t deserve you or the treatment that you’ve given me recently.” Cas met Dean’s gaze, tilting his head to the side.
Anna turned back to Castiel and flashed him a small smirk before moving swiftly and silently back towards the ER.
“Yeah! Wait, it's the angel of… Tuesday?” -Dean bit his bottom lip and Castiel could practically see the wheels turning in his mind- “Shoot! Thursday! The angel of Thursday, which is fitting since today is a Thursday.” Dean said, winking at Castiel.
Still holding the glass in one hand, Dean turned towards Cas, tears forming in his eyes. God, Winchester, hold it together for one minute, please. He pleaded with himself.
“Hey babe, help me a little here.” - Dean tilted his head down towards the bottom of Cas’s shirt. Cas pushed himself up so that he was sitting with Dean straddled over his lap. He grabbed the hem of his shirt and pushed it up over his head, barely breaking eye contact with Dean.
“I’ll take a dirty vanilla chai please, a large as well,” Dean said, handing Becky their menus and returning his attention to Castiel.
Possibilities and questions swirled around his mind, he needed to figure this out. Hopefully Cas would be free when he got home, but how would he bring this up?
She told me that she hoped that you would feel the same way about her someday, that she was never that close with her own folks and that she would love to be an “Official Winchester”. Her words, Sammy. An Official Winchester. A member of the family.”
“So, what do you want to be when you grow up, Dean?” Cas asked, he raised his mug up to his face with both hands, raising an eyebrow over the lip.
Dean’s voice cracked on the last word and he looked down at the ground as his resolve broke and tears began streaming down his face. Charlie’s smile disappeared as she realized that Dean was crying on her doorstep. She quickly pulled back from the window, grabbed a blanket off her bed, and raced down the stairs. The entire way down, she tried to piece together what could have happened. Did something bad happen to Cas? Or to Sam?
Charlie hadn’t known Dean for very long. She just transferred to Cathedral High School this past summer and met him during the in-service workshops held in August. The two quickly became close friends, Dean often joking that if not for Jo, Charlie would be the kid sister he didn’t have and hadn’t asked for. She knew the basic things about Dean Winchester like his greatest responsibilities were to his baby brother in college at Stanford and to his genius, medical student boyfriend. She knew about his love for 70s rock and roll and his prized muscle car left with his family back in Kansas.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel rumbled out with his signature gravelly voice once Dean and Garth had crossed the lot from the ambulance into the hospital breezeway.
“Ah, yes. Well, I'm done stitching you up but we still need to get a quick X-Ray of your leg and a scan of your head to check for a concussion. I can have my techs do that and I’ll meet up with you when you’re done so I can get you discharged.”
“Dean,” Cas’s voice cut through air, forcing Dean to face him. Dean turned and found Cas standing immediately behind him.
During the first couple of weeks after Castiel left Dean, it took everything Gabe and Kali had to get him to leave the guest room. Castiel would barely eat, would change into clean clothes only when he was forced out of the apartment for class then would change back into the black sabbath t-shirt and grey sweatpants he was wearing right now. Gabe remembered the one time that he managed to steal the clothes away long enough to wash them. When Castiel returned home that day and found them neatly folded on the bed. He fell to his knees and sobbed, he screamed at Gabe for the simple act of caring for him. Through his tears, Gabe was able to piece together that Castiel was worried the clothes wouldn’t smell like Dean anymore. Luckily, he only ran them under cold water to remove a stain and line dried them, so they retained a small amount of their original smell.
With his drink plans for tomorrow solidified, Castiel knew that he needed to get back to work. He reluctantly said goodbye to Dean and flipped the file on the top of the stack open. He took off at a brisk pace, head down, skimming the patient chart when he turned the corner-
“WHAT??!! Wai- wha- hang on-'' Charlie unfolded herself from the couch and jumped up. Pacing around the living room, she continued “Castiel was your doctor? The dark haired greek god that walked out 2 years ago, Castiel?”
“I think I want to retire,” Cas said abruptly, cutting Dean off as he leaned against the counter behind him. “None of this is worth losing the love of my life over.”
Dean laid on his bed, head thrown back, his own hand working himself to completion. With a moan and a gentle twist of his wrist, he felt his balls tighten, the sharp pull in his gut. He spilled all over his hand and stomach, some coming up to hit his upper chest. Dean breathed hard through his mouth and closed his eyes, the last image of his fantasy playing out in his head. The figure caressed his face, staring back at him with crystal clear blue eyes.
“All Dean has ever done has been to protect you, if he knew that I called you while you were at school and that you were worried about him, I would never have heard the end of it. It would have weakened any trust that he had placed in me.” -Castiel resumed pacing- “Besides, I felt so indebted to him for taking care of me, paying the bills, buying groceries, maintaining a home, that I felt like carrying his emotional weight was the least I could do for him.”
Dean was always attractive and beautiful, but his lust filled eyes and bruised lips were something different. Cas surveyed Dean’s body, fingers lightly brushing and scraping against his nipples. Dean pulled him back down on top of him and skin-to-skin contact brought a sharp gasp out of Cas. Their cocks trapped between their bodies and providing a source of much needed friction for the both of them. Cas bent his head down to kiss Dean, to slip his tongue between his lips and taste the man underneath him. Dean moaned into Cas, the sliding of their leaking cocks past each other was building an animalistic need in Dean to claim this man as his own. Blindly, Dean fumbled through the bag next to the bed for lube and a condom.
By the time Dean got his door open and both feet out of the car, Castiel was standing there in front of him, holding his crutches. He offered Dean a hand out of the car and Dean tentatively reached out his hand to accept this gesture. As Castiel returned to the driver’s side to lock up, Dean steadily made his way over to the front of his building and climbed up the four steps that led up to the front door. He reached in his pocket for his keys and was overcome with a wave of vertigo. The blood rushed to his head and his vision blurred for a second; and he felt himself tipping backward off the top step when suddenly, Castiel caught him.
“Well, as I’m sure you can guess, I have a secret life the same as you apparently, Cas, or should I call you “Angel Blade”?” Dean asked, wagging his eyebrows. “By day I train cops and by night, I commit crimes. I’m not sure what all you wanted me to say.”
It was 3:06 pm on a Thursday. Castiel sat sweltering in a poorly circulated auditorium as his professor powered on the projector for their first lecture. The door at the back of the auditorium slammed open, letting a pool of light spill across the dimmed room. The entirety of a 300-person lecture hall silenced their conversations and turned to face the source of the commotion. Castiel turned in his seat and saw, standing at the top of the stairs illuminated by the natural daylight of Kansas in the summer, a blonde-haired adonis. The man of near Greek God appearance kept his eyes glued to the floor in front of his feet as he ran down the steps, letting the door close noisily behind him. He only brought his head up to look for an open seat, and his eyes settled on the nearest spot next to Castiel.
“Well I can tell you who I saw since I saw them outside the hospital after my shift but I can’t tell you what I treated them for,” Castiel said, hoping that Gabe was just asking for the juicy hospital details.
“I can’t believe I didn’t know it was this bad, Cas,” Sam said, dropping his head into his hands. Cas stopped in his tracks and took in a sharp inhale, Sam had called him Cas again.
Cas closed the door behind them, closing out the stress and chaos from school so that he could focus fully on Dean. Cas sat Dean down on the edge of the bed and handed him the glass of water left on the nightstand.
Dean limped through his doorway, leaning against the closed door, his face tilted up towards the ceiling. He could hear the tv from the living room and he knew that Sam had heard him come in. Dean gathered his thoughts and crutched down the hallway.
As Cas navigated through the narrow streets of Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood, he thought about Dean Winchester. Cas snuck a glance at Dean out of the corner of his eye. The way the sunlight was pouring into the car caught Dean’s blonde hair and caused it to glisten. His green eyes shone brightly against his freckled cheeks. Cas took a deep breath and was overwhelmed by the immense love he felt for the man sitting next to him in his beat up red corolla.
“Can do, I’ll be right back with those,” Becky said as she left, not that Dean nor Castiel heard her.
“Hey-” Cas warned “Zeke has gotten us through a lot of hard times, he’s reliable” Cas said as he slapped the roof over the driver’s door.
The two began moving boxes into their new place. The first things unpacked were the coffee pot and an air mattress. Both had decided to sell their larger pieces of furniture before leaving Kansas as neither could see the point in renting a large moving trunk for their cheap furniture. Besides, they wanted to go shopping for new things to fill their apartment. This new chapter of their lives was not going to be started with the material objects of a previous chapter. They wanted everything to be a symbol of who they were at that moment in time. At least this was the reasoning that Cas gave Dean for why they should buy all new furniture once they got to Boston, but Dean knew that Cas was looking for any excuse to hit up Ikea.
“I was asking you if you wanted to go to my friend’s Halloween party tonight? Remember? We talked about it yesterday but I needed an answer today just so I can let them know how many people and how much alcohol to get and I know Halloween isn’t for another couple of days but we can’t really drink and whatnot on a Sunday night before class, well, I mean we could but we really shouldn’t.” Dean said, his words coming out quickly, as though they had been held back for too long. “I know I’m rambling. I was just hoping to get an answer from you real quick.”
“Look, man, there was a woman and her kid on the sidewalk. This guy came up to this and grabbed the kid. He was demanding money from the woman and was going to cut her kid if she didn’t pay up. I had to do something, I was the closest one there and I wasn’t going to let some hyped drug addict ruin that family’s holiday. So do what you need to do so I can get out of here.” Dean spat out with his arms crossed.
“Dude, if you didn’t want to go on a date with me, you could have just told me. You didn't have to lead me on or just humor me.” Dean said, breaking the silence and slowly pulling his gaze up from the floor until he met Cas’s eyes.
Dean started the water and let himself acknowledge the thought that had been gnawing at him all night. That no matter how good a date went, or how enjoyable an evening he had with someone, they would never replace Castiel. At least, not until he confronted the residual feelings and emotions that still lingered. Maybe, if he met with Castiel again and they were able to break into a friendship, maybe then Dean would be able to move on.
Cas decided, enough with the pity party, Dean left him to his own devices and he was going to spend the rest of the night drinking, he was at a party so why the hell not?
“Nah man, it's all good,” -Dean brought his head back up, the same full smile spread across his face- “So, if we’re supposed to be getting to know each other and studying together, I was hoping I could ask you a small favor?”
“And you know, he was right, Jo. I couldn’t even make it up the steps to the front door without getting so dizzy that I almost fell back down them. And there is no way I would have made it up those stairs” - he gestured over his shoulder towards the front door- “anytime today without his help. He essentially carried me up them and made sure that I got back in here safely.”
“Well honeybee, are you going to ask me what I’m doing here?” Dean said, breaking the silence between them. He broke eye contact with Cas to look over his shoulder at the zipper on his back.
The two sat in silence once again, Dean looked up at the ceiling to avoid Jo’s eyes and inhaled deeply to settle his breathing.  He knew that Jo would spread the news that Castiel had been here and the thought of defending this act of kindness to his family was overwhelming. Especially since he was not playing with a full deck of cards at the moment due to his concussion. When he dropped his eyes and looked back at Jo, she had a soft expression on her face, as though she was totally relaxed.
“Dude, what the hell? How can you say that to me? To not bother you with this? I thought the whole point of this” -Dean gestures between himself and Cas- “was to help each other through shit?”
“Dean Ross Winchester! Look at me.” Cas said in his “Angel of the Lord” voice, as Dean liked to call it. Dean stopped pacing and looked at Cas
He shook his head, quieting this train of thought. In a desperate attempt to redirect his thoughts, he grabbed his backpack and retrieved the folder with yesterday’s biology notes. He placed them on the table in front of him along with a small pad of post-it notes. He shuffled the notes around, double-checking that he had printed all of the pages, unable to silence that nagging feeling that there was something more than he was willing to admit.  He read the first page of notes, and reread them, and reread them, trying to pull his mind away from the pit sitting in his stomach, away from his true intentions of this coffee date.
“How did it get this bad? How did none of us see it? I can’t believe no one was there for Dean while he was going through this,” Sam asked. He picked his head up and looked at Cas, disbelief evident on his face.
“No, Dean, you’ve had ‘difficulties’ before and they haven’t affected you like this, there’s something more here.”
“OH-” -Cas pushed Dean’s hands off his shoulders- “But you’re allowed to just leave me in the company of strangers! You blew me off the moment we got here, what the hell Dean?!” Cas yelled back, drawing the attention of a small crowd of people standing near them.
“Dean,” Charlie said softly, “nothing’s wrong with you.” -she outlined his cheekbone with her thumb gently- “you already know why you can’t connect with someone new, even if you won’t admit it to yourself yet.”
Castiel stood on the welcome mat to his apartment, lost in thought. He had made it through the day, he was officially done with all of his undergraduate courses and graduation was right around the corner. Despite the horrible start to the day, he finished both exams and would be starting medical school in just a few short months. He had hoped to celebrate and decompress from the end of the semester with Dean. That they would have one last quiet night in, just the two of them before everything changed. Ever since he heard back from Boston University that he had been accepted, Dean had seemed distant.
“Oh you, uh, have a little something,” Cas said, pointing to his own lip. Dean touched his face to find the foam, and instead of using a napkin, used his lip to lick the foam off. Castiel sat there, a beat of momentary awe washed over him as the most attractive man he had ever been in the vicinity in, used his tongue to lick his lips mere inches away from him.
Cas let his hands wander down to Dean’s jeans, slipping his fingers under the waistband, slowly unbuttoning the button, then pulling down the zipper. He slid his hands past the elastic on Dean’s underwear until he was able to grip Dean’s ass in both hands. He pulled Dean’s hips closer to him until he could feel Dean’s erection against his own. Without taking his lips off of Dean’s, he pushed his jeans down to his knees and palmed Dean through his boxers.
All of the emotions that Cas felt in the car towards Dean are being released in this moment, Cas is all consumed with his love for Dean Winchester and cannot get enough. He breathes in Dean’s scent, a mixture of his body wash and leather. He runs his hands through Dean’s hair, a little longer than he usually wears it and Cas is able to grip it and twist his fingers in it. His tongue slips into Dean’s mouth and he can taste him. Pure Dean, and he’s all Cas’s. Unbelievably Castiel’s.
“Well,” -Gabe readjusted in his seat, he sat up straighter and folded his hands in his lap- “I can’t talk about what Dean went through, but you, Cas?” -Gabe noted the flicker in Castiel’s eyes as he recognized the nickname- “You could not have stayed in the situation that you were in.
