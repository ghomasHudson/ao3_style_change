There stood someone, mid-twenties, dark brown hair and large brown eyes. Looking up they seemed shocked at who they saw on the bed.
” He was frozen in his current position, unable to even lean in to give his brother a kiss or a hug. It took too much effort, too much energy. He couldn’t risk that.
“Edward!” Howard barked entering the kitchen in the store while Tony was topping up containers of olives. “You
When the men left and the door was locked again, Tony dared to move again. His face was throbbing. There was the all too familiar taste of blood on his tongue. With that came the memories and flashbacks that made everything even worse.
Clint stuck his hand in a bowl of melted ice under the counter and flicked his fingers at Nat. She laughed, wiping away the droplets.
Downstairs he did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen. It was familiar work and for once he enjoyed doing it. He was adjusting the table cloth when Sarah came back to the kitchen.
“I wanted to get him something that will last. It’s not a single use item, it’s not something he can’t use everyday. I want him to be able to look at his wrist and be reminded of me and that I love him. Especially since I’m not always there,” he said simply, trying to control the somewhat goofy smile the words ‘I love him’ threatened to put on his face. Natalia still caught it and smiled in return. “I’m getting it engraved, which is why I don’t have it now. I thought that might add an extra personal touch.”
“Every day she becomes more and more like you and Okoye,” he said, lifting the six-year-old up and spinning in his chair. She giggled and kicked her skinny little legs. He put her back down and she kissed his cheek, sliding back down to the floor and going over to her mom.
“On his way. Dmitri went to get him,” Tony said. Steve nodded slowly and pointed to the little button on his IV that would release more morphine. Sarah pushed it twice and Steve relaxed, leaning his head back and closing his eyes.
been born yesterday if you think I only have one.” He entered Falsworth’s space and the man swung at James again and again, but James dodged each one like he knew it was coming and then he grabbed him, holding him in a headlock. James stabbed him in his side with the second knife, making Falsworth drop the one he was holding and then James pulled the original blade from his shoulder and slit Falsworth’s throat. He didn’t have time or the desire to prolong his death.
After Clint moved in with him, he got to see it up close. It didn’t happen for at least a solid month after Clint moved in and then when it did, it hit hard and James couldn’t help but wonder if that was because Clint had spent all that time fighting it so James wouldn’t see it; wearing himself out until it finally overcame him when he had nothing left with which to fight it.
After that round of nightmares, Clint slept through the rest of the night but by the looks of him now, it was not a restful slumber. He had bags under his eyes and he was using both elbows to prop himself up over his plate of scrambled eggs and toast. He yawned periodically and didn’t even acknowledge Lucky’s begging. For once, it was James who slipped the pup a piece of bacon.
“When he asked me about my age, he was surprised. Does it ever bother you? I mean, that I’m so much younger than you? Is there ever a time when you regret not being with someone older and more experienced?” It was a question he had been thinking about a lot since that day with Clint. It had been weighing heavily on his heart despite all his efforts to convince himself that Steve probably didn’t care.
“He does, doesn’t he? Someone has quite the eye for fashion it seems,” Sarah teased, leaning in to kiss both of their cheeks before dashing off upstairs to help Benni finish getting ready for school.
“Family or—” Steve nodded. “Ah, well, no. My parents both passed a couple years ago. My extended family have never been close, so Rhodey adopted me,” he said, a smile on his face despite the topic because Rhodey was always a positive subject. “We met in high school. He saved me from so many swirlies it’s not even funny.”
The man was sweating now, such a contrast from the shivering, slightly blue-hued man they had seen when they’d walked in.
A knock at the door brought him out of his head and back to reality. He called for them to come in. It was Dugan, back from the jobs he’d been given to do after taking Tony home.
Tony bit the inside of his cheek and looked to Pepper. “I injured my wrist, sir. It made carrying the plate difficult.”
“Of course. If it were the other way around I don’t doubt you’d do the same, Steve.” Steve nodded and James watched the anger bubbling up in him, heard the audible sound of his knuckles cracking as he balled them into fists at the thought of what Howard might’ve done to Tony. James put a hand on his shoulder. “Whatever you do, don’t kill him.”
“Lost his daughter to polio a few years back, lost his wife more recently,” he explained and ah, that made sense. Steve thought he remembered a different face as the front of the deli. He noted how Dugan didn’t say what she died of and when he asked, the answer only made him more suspicious. “Quite the swigger according to his neighbors. Got another kid, young boy, in addition to Tony.” Steve nodded along as Dugan carried on. This is why he was Steve’s right hand man. He never left Steve with unanswered questions.
Tony couldn’t stop thinking about the unexpected kindness directed towards him by the Irish. Howard continued to bad-mouth them, cussing about them and the Russians too but Tony didn’t bother listening anymore.
There was a knock and then Sarah opened the door when Steve said she could come in. “Hey, pet, everything a’right?” she asked in that soft, soothing voice of hers. She came in further, shutting the door behind her and sitting on the bed, her hand dropping onto Steve’s foot and she gave it a reassuring squeeze.
He headed downstairs as quietly as possible, stopping in the kitchen first and grabbing the first baked good he saw. His mother had been baking up a storm lately just to get her mind off it all and probably in hopes that those two stubborn boys of hers would eat.
“Alright. I just wanted to hear you say it. It’s is a big commitment to spend weeks away with only one person.”
“I don’t see how it matters who you’re with, as long as everyone is happy,” he said more openly. “I’m just sorry they had to sneak around because of Benni and me.” He wanted Steve safe and sound as much as Sarah, that was for sure. “Since Steve never said anything I’m not going to ask him either. They shouldn’t be taking any risks though. So if they need time alone, just tell me and we’ll be out of their hair for as long as they need.”
“Mr Rogers said he’s gonna be here? I don’t know what to do about the order Dugan placed.” Pepper chuckled and gently pushed him towards the kitchen and told him to go for it. She didn’t react to Tony’s flinching and gently patted his cheek.
On their way up the stairs, Tony took a detour and peeked in the library, checking if anyone was even home.
Dmitri came in a moment later with Benni and turned to James. “James,” he said and Sarah was shocked to hear him call him by his first name but James didn’t react more than to turn to him, “phone call.
James informed the man in French. Normally, these things would have to be done in person. Go to the airport, speak to the people at the counter and so on and so forth. Naturally, James bypassed all of that with connections and he’d never been more grateful for them because had he had to have this conversation in person, he might’ve stabbed the young man he was talking to.
“No, sir, that’s not it.” Tony did his best to relax even though he felt tense and trapped. “‘Edward’ is what Howard calls me. My name is Tony.”
When he first spotted land on the other end of the horizon, Tony felt ready to get off the ship. One more night and one more day before they would be in Belfast.
Clint and Tony's captor makes contact. Steve and James use every connection at their disposal and are closing in quickly. But is it quickly enough?
Clint squinted, focusing on Tony’s mouth. Oh thank god. English. Or, at least he hoped it was English. Maybe he was just seeing words that weren’t actually being formed.
He was warming up to Natalia although he had absolutely no idea whether or not she even liked him. The more Steve got to know her and hear how James spoke about Clint, the more curious he was. Hopefully, he would get the chance to redeem himself after all of this and they could start fresh. He wondered if Tony would like Clint.
“Thanks for the heads up,” Tony said honestly and thought about it. He had seen Steve sad before and he would like to think that he was able to handle that. “I’ll handle it.” He was about to turn to Steve when he remembered a more important question. “Is it over?”
He hadn’t realized just how much worry and the need to get him out of his previous situation had been dominating his mind. Most of his thoughts towards Tony were ‘protect, rescue’ and now with that no longer as much of a necessity he was finding himself more conscious of his attraction and his emotions, but he did what he’d done the last time this had happened—he squashed it. The first time it worked so well it went away entirely. He could only hope.
Steve felt like the air had been punched out of him and he dropped his eyes to the papers on his desk. He hadn’t known Tony was already entertaining the thought of moving on. He knew it was a possibility but figured a distant one, at least after his arm was healed or after Howard was taken care of but then again he couldn’t really blame him. Steve was so closely tied into the suffering he’d been subjected to the last couple months, of course he would eventually want to be rid of him, of it all. Didn’t mean it didn’t still hurt him more than he wanted to admit.
“Of course I am,” Steve said, pulling Tony against his chest and pressing a kiss to his hair and then his forehead. “You’re my everything.” He trailed his finger lightly down Tony’s arm to his hand and then closed his hand around it, lifting it to his lips to kiss the inside of Tony’s palm. “Making you happy is my favorite task of the day.”
!” he whined, sounding much weaker than he intended to. “Save some for later,” he whispered, raising Steve’s hand to kiss his palm. “Whipped cream or vanilla sauce?”
There wasn’t anything Tony wouldn’t do to help Steve and yet it felt like he wasn’t doing enough. And maybe Steve really thought Tony wasn’t noticing how he never turned a single page in his book, or how he stared blankly at walls, or how frustrated he got when he had to use the bathroom, needed some cleaning or changing of bandages and his gown.
“Okay, sweetheart,” Clint said, happily taking the coffee Tony offered him. Once James was out of earshot, Clint asked, “You sure your hands are up to the task of cooking? I’m perfectly happy with cereal.”
“More dogs is not a consequence,” Clint agreed happily. Clint thanked him for the coffee and drank it quickly, feeling a little sleepy for no reason other than he was comfortable. “Nat’s great. She’s my best friend
“I’m fine, little one. Only a big brother is allowed to worry, don’t forget that, eh?” he said and ruffled Benni’s hair.
“I’d head home and grab a few things now if you’d like. Saves you the stress of traveling back and forth,” James told him. As much as Clint didn’t want to struggle with getting back into the car, he also didn’t want to be separated from James.
and Benni went home. James took a phone call and I’m still here,” he explained softly. “It’s early afternoon and you’re safe.” He fixed his hair again.
“Black hoodie and blue jeans. Male build, approximately 5’9” or 10, white,” Bucky rattled off and Steve was impressed because he hadn’t even seen the clothing but Bucky was ahead of him.
. Heartless and bloodthirsty? He thought back to seeing Howard at the hospital. Thin, wounded, tired. James and Steve had done that. Neither of them had explained why they did that to him. Even so Tony knew that it was because of what Howard had done to him.
but you have enough on your plate as it is. You don’t need my feelings on top of it all.” James bit his tongue, stopping himself from adding ‘or my guilt.’
Tony left a plate with food on the dinner table and did the dishes, currently waiting for water to heat up on the stove. His blood froze when he heard the downstairs door opening and the heavy footsteps on the stairs. It had been a good day. Maybe Howard would fall asleep in front of the TV as he usually did and everything would continue to be good.
been with Clint from the start. He’d been understanding with Clint even when it put himself in a negative light, like when Clint was afraid to stay the night at his house during the snowstorm. James hadn’t been happy about Clint’s presumptions about him, obviously, but he hadn’t been angry with Clint either.
“Doesn’t narrow it down as much as I would have liked but it’s a start,” James said, turning to Steve. “Thinking what I’m thinking?”
“I’d rather dance with you at my wedding.” She swirled the remnants of her coffee in her cup, watching the dark liquid as if it were more interesting than anything she’d ever seen before.
“‘M stubborn as an ass,” Steve told him. “That’s what ma says anyway.” He reached for Tony’s hand and James didn’t react beyond watching the interaction he’d never truly witnessed.
“If you’d like I can bring you fresh clothes and some proper food,” she said and Tony knew it was less about him and more about her seeing Steve. Tony looked back to Steve who looked uncomfortable. Given his reaction from earlier he decided against it for now.
“Where was he shot? How bad?” Tony couldn’t say who it was that asked questions at a time like this.
With what little thinking ability Steve hadn’t managed to kiss out of him yet, Tony reached over and yanked open a drawer to reveal everything Steve would need and Steve chuckled, the sound low and it made Tony squirm.
He went back to exploring the room because he simply had to know more about Steve but was too afraid to actually ask him. A row of pictures were on the shelves. Sarah hadn’t changed a bit, the smile lines only adding to her beauty. He could see Steve grow up, his face changing a lot over the years. In one picture with who he assumed was Steve’s father, he saw a look on Steve’s face that he knew all too well. A look of hate, disgust but also sadness. He really did know what Tony had been going through. Then there were pictures of Steve with James over the years.
Steve bit his tongue to stop himself from asking Tony to tell him what had just happened. It was obvious he didn’t want to talk about it. Steve would ask later, see if he wanted to get into it. For now he wanted Tony to feel good. To forget as much badness as he could help him to do so.
“You’re not. Your whore mother was pregnant when we got married. I was stupid enough to marry her while she was pregnant from some italiano bastard.” He laughed again and now it was Steve who tensed up visibly but he did nothing.
“You know what, Romanoff,” Steve said warningly and Clint high-fived her. They had a competition going to see which of them could get scolded by him first on a non-job related issue.
Clint and James finally make it to France. James finally gets to give Clint his gifts. France is exactly what they both needed.
Clint snorted softly, leaning his head against the wall. He was so hungry it was making him lightheaded and nauseous, and now the only person he had to talk to wasn’t very friendly. Wonderful.
“And what would your ma say?” Tony said with a grin, raising his eyebrows which Steve couldn’t see. “I could get her, y’know,” he added even more teasingly.
Meanwhile Clint was trying his hardest to pretend he hadn’t noticed the dirtiness happening over at the oven. Steve really loved his little Tony, Clint thought to himself with a smile, averting his gaze so he wouldn’t see anything else he wasn’t supposed to.
That was it. That had been their last interaction. It was of some comfort that his last words to Steve were about how he felt. His last interaction with Benni was allowing him to get a lollipop. And with Sarah it was remembering the canned peaches they forgot to get. Canned peaches had been the reason why he left the group and ultimately, they were the opening for those men to take him.
“Nat’s,” Rhodey answered, tapping Squad Lieutenant Barnes on the shoulder so they could go finish filling out the paperwork on this fire and get it to Captain Rogers and Chief Fury as soon as possible.
He let go of Tony’s hand and slowly laid down, keeping his hands under his pillow, facing away from Tony because what he felt right then was too much. His chest aching and every breath hurt but not from his physical wounds. “Okay,” he said quietly, keeping his voice low so it wouldn’t crack.
Thank you so much to everyone for reading, leaving kudos, leaving comments and just being so loyal and sticking with us for the past 17 weeks. This has been such a blast to write and post and your feedback has really kept Redhead_Robin and I going! 💙
Steve situated himself and sighed. “I got here at a quarter to, waited outside. No offense but you didn’t strike me as the early type.”
“They caught me,” he whispered, his lips barely moving. He wanted to shift, trying to sit up but found that his body hurt way too much to move. He felt defeated.
I could date and ever truly be safe. I’m a man who loves men living in a world that hates people like me, like us. If anything,
“Yeah,” Clint admitted quietly. James stood to go to the kitchen but Clint grabbed his wrist and pulled him back. James looked down at him, raising his eyebrows expectantly. “Thank you.”
“Looks delicious,” he said, in a ‘what do I care’ kind of tone. He got up, took his own plate and left.
“Since Sarah is taking care of Benni more than I do, we’re more brothers and we argue a lot more. It’s… something new.” Only Nella and Tony had ever fought often, though still they had each other’s backs. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Benni tried to steal Lucky.”
“I didn’t mean it, you know.” Again James’ hands paused their task when Clint spoke and then a moment later resumed as if nothing had happened. It was quiet in the kitchen for a few seconds before James finally spoke.
“What? What?” he asked, panicked after being pulled from such a deep sleep. He turned his head, his eyes zeroing in on the food at the door.
After a couple minutes, they both looked over to see Captain Rogers finally come jogging out of Fury’s office, in his civilian clothes now, and stand at the door, ready to go.
Tony took the folder and saw numbers. Didn’t take a genius to see that it was about money. The amounts of money he saw there were incredible. Of course he realized that Steve was wealthy, he didn’t know just
“Should I call the cops or is there about to be a funny story behind this?” Steve asked, leaning back against the wall, one arm crossed over his chest, the other hand holding the coffee he now sipped.
He couldn’t shake the bad feeling gnawing at him. It was like a weight tied around his neck. Something was wrong and that only became more apparent the longer James refused to tell. The fact that James had not called to rip Steve a new one meant he really did not want to talk about this.
He knew that this was Clint’s way of trying to get more information about their trip but James was determined to keep it quiet even if Clint was playing very dirty.
Steve and James were both borderline tipsy on the way home. Steve was slurring his words and his accent came out thicker, more Irish than American. James handled his liquor better usually but he’d been drinking on an empty stomach whereas Steve always had a few snacks throughout the day so he was also sporting an accent more befitting of his heritage.
When Tony regained consciousness, everything was dark but warm. So he ended up in hell? That seemed fitting given everything that had happened. He leaned back and closed his eyes to get some more rest. If he was dead, why did his body continue to ache? That hardly seemed fair but when had life ever been fair to him and why would it be any different now that he was dead. Tony wondered if there was any way he could find out about Benni and if he was okay.
Tony said, louder than necessary, “I missed Jones who went to pick up Benni.” With his head he motioned upstairs. “Unless you have something better to do?”
“It’s final then? You’re not coming to my wedding?” she asked without so much as a warning or heads up so he could have prepared for the sudden change of topic and mood.
Seeing as James and Sarah seemed to need a moment to convince themselves that Steve was really there and would be okay, Tony wanted to give them that. Now that he was out of surgery and in his bed, there was no way Tony would leave his side anytime soon.
James sat outside the room listening to Tony pace and move around. He didn’t bother looking up when Tony left and came back with coffee, he had nothing to say to him so why bother? He just kept reading his book on American Sign Language and worrying about Steve.
“I’ll be back with Steve and James as soon as I can,” he promised Clint, one hand on his shoulder. This didn’t feel right. Why couldn’t they both make a run for it? “I’ll take the keys and lock the door from outside.” Then at least they wouldn’t find the keys in Clint’s possession, which would probably spare him physical consequences.
So James was at his office now, trying to busy himself with any other last minute paperwork before their trip in a few days. Steve and Tony should have arrived in Ireland by now. He wondered how they were doing and hoped it was a positive answer.
“Thank you,” he said, his voice still thick with sleep and more gruff than usual. He headed for the stove top and grabbed a plate, loading it up with food and taking a seat beside Tony. He poured himself coffee from the pot on the table and nearly finished it before starting his food, saying his own small grace when Sarah looked like she might throw her eggs at him if he ate without.
Steve was angry and it was visible in his posture and the way he spoke, his words over-enunciated and his tone abrupt.
“What happened?” Clint heard a sharp voice demand and the sound of it bathed him in a warmth and feeling of security that he was sure was equal to how a swaddled baby felt.
They sat down and Sarah served the food, as she usually did. It was Steve’s turn to say grace before they ate, which had become a routine Tony enjoyed a lot. Everything was as it always had been on calm evenings.
Tony’s eyes lingered for a moment on the blood on James’ shirt, wondering if the other person was still alive. There was no judgement in his thoughts but simple and honest curiosity. Though the Russians had a reputation for being more prone to violence when something wasn’t going their way.
They chatted and joked until their food came, falling silent for a few minutes as they ate. It was delicious, all perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. Maria almost finished hers before Clint did his and James and Natalia just smiled and ate like civilized people.
“Tony!” The boy squealed and started crying almost immediately. Despite his pain and everything else, Tony moved to pull his brother into his arms and hug him tightly.
Never have I ever thought of you to be cruel.” He considered getting up to look at him, to look him in the eyes so he knew that Tony was serious. In the end he decided against it because Steve and he were in such a comfortable, intimate position.
“Depends. You two seem to be creating quite the friendship.” Steve made a noise of annoyance. “What? Still hoping for more?”
No one said anything and Tony knew that Steve and James were in the room with him but he didn’t care. Or rather, he didn’t mind. James who had found him and had stopped Howard from killing him and then gave him the best possible treatment. Steve who had taken him in, given him a new home and a job, a purpose. They knew what they had been doing, what needed to be done and they had his back.
Now that he was in a comfortable position in life and had the money to splurge on a special occasion like a wedding, why wouldn’t he? Who was going to stop him? His supportive fella, who was now coming downstairs with his empty dishes in hand? His equally supportive mother who wanted to do even more for this girl, who reminded her too much of herself?
“Thank you,” he said sincerely and held himself up for another second before dropping back onto the bed. He knew why he took a beating. How could he forget? “Where... where is Howard now? Does he know where I am?”
Clint made his way to Natalia, wrapping an arm around her waist and pressing a kiss to her hair. “Oh, this will be fun,” he said.
Just when he had managed to distract himself he saw the door opening and there were James and Sarah. They didn’t have to say anything for Tony to put his jacket on and follow them to James’ car. Tony sat next to Sarah and held her hand. It had been months since he had last seen James and now he was simply back? Had he been gone? Had he something to do with this? What happened? Tony forced himself to continue breathing calmly, helping Sarah to the hospital. A man who looked familiar to Tony walked towards them as soon as he saw them. What was his name again? He couldn’t remember.
“I’m glad James isn’t alone in that big house of his anymore. I always wondered if he got lonely,” Tony said and rested his chin on top of his knees. “Tell me about your bar.”
“Why is that?” Clint asked outright, more than a little tired of feeling like the town pariah in this house whenever Steve was around. “Is it because of how protective you are of James? Or is it because of Tony?”
“No,” James disagreed, smiling but it was sad. He dragged his thumb across the delicate skin underneath Clint’s eye and a single tear fell down. James quickly wiped it away and Clint’s gaze moved away from James’ face and to the wall. “I could be better. But that’s a discussion for another time. We have dinner now. Natalia and Maria will be here any minute now.”
He was lying on his stomach, legs in the air and ankles crossed, a large sketchbook laid out in front of him with crayons and pencils. He was drawing some people playing cards. Steve sat down on the floor beside him and tapped the page.
Two weeks later Tony was due for his last check-up at the hospital, the thick bandages on his left arm were finally gone and the doctor moved his arm this way and that, applying pressure and tapping on different places before he was finally cleared. The bruises had all faded, the stitched up wounds were red and throbbed, so for that Tony was given an ointment and that was it. Tony could hardly believe it but he left without new bandages or band aids, no new wounds, nothing. No pain.
selfish. He loves you, you love him. That’s not selfishness, it’s logic.” It reminded Clint of when James had asked if he’d marry him and Clint said no because it is illegal but he would stay with him forever. In his mind then and even now he knew James could do a million times better than him, maybe even with a woman he actually
Tony looked to Pepper then back to him and shook his head. “No, sir. She’s a fine bird, if that's what you're asking.”
. Saying that I hate that man is an understatement,” he said, his voice shaking from the anger. “He said that if I ever reported him, fought him, anything of that sort, he’d turn to Benni instead.” Tony had to say those words again. They were the reason why he had fought so hard to keep going. “Whatever you’re doing to him, know that he deserves worse.”
“Yes, ma’am,” James and Steve said at the same time. James disappeared to remove his jacket, tie and waistcoat, coming back in a light grey shirt that made his eyes even more intense. He moved to help Steve set the table.
Tony looked at Steve, up and down, examined his face and smiled as he nodded. Wherever did that man come from? “Yes,” he said and reached his hand out to Steve. “Shake on it?”
They headed inside and were greeted by staff and customers alike, people sending them overly polite smiles and tipping hats.
Tony was sure he was already asleep until he heard Steve chuckle quietly. “Nobody told you to have two slices of cake.”
“Edward! Get out of here!” Howard said sharply and made excuses for his son while Tony put down the cups and headed back to the kitchen. Before he left them, he turned around to look at the man who had caught his attention. From the distance Tony now noticed how pale he was. Not sickly but beautifully pale. Then he watched the man reach out for a sandwich and noticed how beautiful his hands were. Big, strong, veiny. When it seemed that the man was turning around to look at him, Tony quickly disappeared and hid against the wall next to the door frame leading to the front of the store. His heart was beating out of his chest and he just didn’t know why.
It took him a moment to realize that nothing was happening and that it was Steve there with him. “Did something happen?” Tony asked, his voice still raspy from sleeping. “You okay?”
.” As Clint had recently found out there was the country home and then a beautiful building that his family owned in Paris city center. He managed to get that tidbit of information out of James the other night using some
Steve frowned when Tony didn’t speak. “Oh no, do you hate it?” If he did, he wouldn’t be the first. Steve had dated people before who found the idea of eating a home-cooked meal boring and not something that could be considered a date. He’d be disappointed if that was the case but for Tony he’d do his best not to show it.
It wasn’t so much the stinging or the slight discomfort Tony was feeling, but the heat that surrounded him and was now pressing into him as well. For a brief moment he wondered if this was normal and healthy but that thought was quickly discarded. He forced his eyes open for just a second and what he was seeing was worth everything. He simply nodded and moved his hips slightly, gasping when he felt Steve even deeper.
Clint woke up with a hell of a headache, silence in one ear, and completely disorientated. He sat up. He must have been knocked out at some point but he didn’t remember it. He remembered being carried to the van, he remembered losing his bearings once they got into Queens, and then they had driven for another thirty minutes. He had no way of telling if they had driven in circles and were still in Long Island City or if they had actually gone deeper into Queens.
Tony waited for James to leave the room before he decided to play along and leaned in to bite the orange. How was he supposed to resist Steve when he hadn’t been able to kiss him for weeks?
A moment later, she heard footsteps and then the black-haired, green-eyed man came bounding down the steps, not eager to be accused of making Sarah Rogers wait. He smiled at her, extending his arm for her to take and she did, first kissing each of his cheeks and then he led her up the stairs to the office, asking her how she was.
Once dry and in fresh pajamas they curled up in their large bed, Tony in Steve’s arms pressing light kisses on his neck and collarbones. Steve’s strong arms around him felt possessive, like he would never let go ever again. Something about that scared Tony because it could only mean that Steve was in danger.
Stocked up for the next two weeks, they made the little five minute drive from the center to the cottage that lay on the outskirts of Ballycastle. It was in the middle of seemingly nowhere and about half a kilometer from the cliff edges that overlooked the ocean.
. Tony hated how bitter he sounded in his own head. “They better. Sarah misses you like crazy.” Though Sarah wasn’t, of course, the only one who missed Steve. “Benni does too…” he added, softer.
“What about my favorite person? Does he miss me?” Steve asked, grinning. “Cause I know I miss him and I can’t wait to see him.”
“Sorry,” he said again, “it was just… a lot all at once. I didn’t think you’d all want me around in the mood I was in. Even Dugan’s patience was wearing thin, I could tell.”
Steve frowned. “I don’t agree but I’m not passing up the opportunity to use the knife.” He took it, admiring it only for a moment before he drove it into Bakuto’s thigh and the man screamed out in pain. “Who’s the weak one now?”
“Her and James in the same room is not a room I would like to be in. Imagine they wanted to know something from me. I’d tell them everything.” He chuckled softly. “Benni needs time with new people. He’s shy and gets scared easily.” He wanted to say something but was cut off by a yawn. “Do you know what Steve and James are talking about?”
Steve grinned. “Well, I decided to not only do something I like but also to share a little more about me.” He filled himself a portion as well and tasted it, overjoyed with the turnout. “This is a traditional Irish stew. My mother taught me to make it. She taught me to make all of this but, like I said, I had a little help with some of it.”
“Steve... when you do things like that and… say that…” His voice trailed off, too embarrassed to say those words, to say how Steve affected him.
“No, we got the call in the middle of the night. I left him a note but I’ll get him soon probably.” He felt out of place yet again. Maybe he should ask Dmitri to get Benni.
“My best friend is Mee—uh, Dmitri’s cousin. I’ve known Dmitri for years and he thought James needed friends and so he introduced us.” He smiled, remembering that night and how closed off James had been and how very on brand Clint Barton he had been. “James did not like me at first.”
Unfortunately, it was also normal to see Steve upset or glaring daggers. Tony put the tray of sandwiches and coffee down on the table and sat down next to him.
James was going on day four of one meal a day and Dmitri and Natalia were both worried but he refused to take more time than he needed for “frivolous things,” as he called it. Right, yes. Eating. Frivolous.
Tony was about to say something about how Sarah didn’t make requests but he didn’t get to do that. Instead Steve showered him in love, held him and made Tony question how he worried in the first place.
As soon as Tony heard Steve’s voice he sat up. His eyelids were heavy and his eyes burning but he smiled when he saw Steve.
“So beautiful,” Steve praised. “And such a good boy for me,” he added more quietly, leaning to kiss Tony’s shoulder. “Everything alright?”
“We’ll be home soon. I’ve got a heat pack in my room,” Steve told him, worried both as his friend and captain. “You and Clint took a hard fall. Take next shift off. I’ll text him too. There’s always floaters willing to work.”
Clint snapped up, whirling around and dropping the clipboard in his hands. He swung out before he had even focused on who it was and Fitz barely managed to dodge the fist coming for him.
Sarah knocked on the door and put in an order with one of the younger guys stood outside who treated her with the same level of respect as Steve. When she turned back to Tony and processed what he said, she laughed, shaking her head. “You’ve got a broken arm, you had a concussion, multiple lacerations, broken ribs and a punctured lung, boyo.” She picked up the chart at the end of the bed and browsed through, making sure she hadn’t missed anything. “Ah right, let’s not forget about the twenty-eight stitches you’ve got.”
Clint squeezed Tony’s hand when he noticed the way his chest was moving, like he couldn’t get his breath. He could guess the reason, so he didn’t comment on it.
Soon they would be in France, away from everything bad, just the two of them. They would sleep in as late as they wanted and stay up even later. James would bake bread and Clint would make them drinks and they’d be lazy together. And they’d be together in a world of their own creating. No one around, no one to bother them or catch them. James couldn’t wait.
Steve kept his thoughts and his reactions to himself for the moment and carried on to his next topic. He took a bite of his sandwich, gently dabbing at his mouth with the napkin provided. He eyed Pepper, jerking his head in her direction. “You two going steady?”
“Why else would you want to know this?” Tony asked, drying the working spaces as he spoke. “No, I don’t. Why?”
It was three days later that Steve was caught off guard again. In the gym, he was heading for the door to his home when someone came out of one of the dark corners. He didn’t recognize the face, some youngster again, no older than twenty.
Steve looked at him long and hard and then sighed. “Fine.” He walked over to Howard and kicked him, watching in disgust as he toppled over sadly. He looked almost as bad as Tony had when they’d found him.
The fingers around James’ knife tightened, the sound of his grip against the leather handle an audible strain. Through gritted teeth, he spoke, “
It was strange how comfortable Tony was around Sarah despite not knowing her at all. That of course didn’t mean that he liked being touched or that he wouldn’t flinch when she did. It had become an instinct and he had no control over it.
” She translated it for James and then continued. “It is past time that everything Bakuto has sent out, comes back to him.”
James placed a top on his pot of broccoli and turned to Clint, an eyebrow raised as he read his expression and then nodded, his lips forming an understanding ‘oh.’ “Because you’re loud.”
“What, you getting tired? I can do this all day,” he said, raising his fists. Falsworth scoffed, the knife gripped tightly in his hand. He took a step and then lurched forward, catching himself. He turned and Steve saw the familiar handle of a blade sticking out of Falsworth’s shoulder.
I don’t regret.” He didn’t. “I just keep thinking... none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been born. Maybe my mother would have lived a good life then, Nella wouldn’t have died, Benni could grow up with his parents? A lot of people would have been spared a great deal of sadness and hurt if I had never been born.”
?” She looked over at him, concerned but she nodded and he headed for the study, closing the doors behind him.
The documents also contained details of partnerships he had with individuals he was less friendly with like Reed Richards, Matt Murdock (his lawyer), and Scott Lang (a man James knew could get anything he needed and wouldn’t ask any questions) and many others. James didn’t go into too much detail with each of them because Dmitri had met them all and knew what they all did for James but he didn’t always know
Downstairs, Dmitri was just arriving with Nat and Maria. He held the door open for them as they stepped inside and Clint’s eyes widened as they did. Natalia was in her favorite fur, the very one she had conned some rich fella into buying for her, and under that she had on the most beautiful emerald green gown. Beside her, Maria was looking equally as stunning in a dark blue one.
“Well, amazingly I can do both because I had a great time, Steve. Really. I know the way we met probably leads you to think I need more to enjoy myself but I told you—it’s about the company.”
“Are ya hungry?” Sarah asked, still petting Tony’s hair. Even though he didn’t answer she gently made him sit up. “Let’s get some food into you. And a nice cuppa coffee.”
The mention of his brother made Tony’s heart ache even more. James didn’t leave out anything, did he?
“Yes and no,” she said, a mischievous smile on her face. James and Steve waited patiently for her answer. “I think perhaps you should stay here awhile.”
But for now, he busied himself with the reports Dmitri had brought in detailing weapon sale and acquisition in the last month, which was one of the many businesses that previously belonged to Bakuto and now were Steve and James’.
Steve huffed angrily, looking away. “Fine. What’s your plan?” James relaxed, standing to take a folder out of his desk drawer and hand it to Steve. “What’s this?”
Steve rolled them so that Tony was laying on top of him and he ran his hands through his soft chocolate hair, tucking one particularly curly piece behind his ear.
“Oh, I like sweet. Even better would be something with coffee in it. Really strong coffee and some of Sarah’s grilled cheese sandwiches.” Tony hummed and rubbed his stomach, desperate for something to eat that had actual flavor.
“Aw,” Clint teased, “you kinda like me, huh?” He gave Tony’s hand a quick squeeze for both of their sakes. It was already strange not seeing Tony at all hours of the day but now he would be miles away and he wouldn’t even be able to see him a few times a day.
“I’m getting sick of waiting!” the man growled but Tony wasn’t sure those words were even meant for him. He didn’t even see the punch to his face coming, only felt the sudden force on his cheek. Before he could process what happened, another punch landed right in the middle of his face, soon followed by a third.
James inhaled deeply, trying to remember his promise to Clint not to lose his temper with Steve. Clint was irritated but no harm had been done. James thought it was sweet how much Clint cared about the preservation of James’ friendship with Steve.
Steve sucked in another sharp, angry breath and began tending to his wounds in the tenderest manner possible. When he was done, he handed him an ice pack to hold to his ribs. He had been completely silent when he’d gotten to his back, the otherwise soft skin covered in poorly healed welts.
,” James said in a quiet sort of awe after swallowing a mouthful. Steve was on his fifth mouthful, not even bothering to speak until his plate was clean and he was going for seconds. Steve stood and James held his plate out for him to refill it as well. “Such a well-behaved young man you’ve raised,” he told Sarah with a teasing look.
Though Sarah didn’t look at him like he was broken, Tony felt like he was. “Thank you,” he said softly feeling ashamed of his own reaction. He ate his soup slowly, the warmth of it and Sarah’s gentle presence making him even sleepier. She handed him the tablets with a glass of water and he took them. Before he knew it, he fell asleep on the couch, not even able to finish his soup.
“It surely rules Fisk out,” Steve said and Natalia turned to him despite still not really liking him. “He’s not just a big whiny bitch, he’s also a racist. Besides, apart from Madame Gao who, last I checked, actually
When Steve finally got home, he felt dissatisfied. By all means, it had been a good night—James had set him up with two different people, a man and a woman—but still, there was nothing memorable. Nothing noteworthy and he knew he’d likely never see either of them again and he was tired of it. He was tired of having to settle for the absolute least because what he truly was and wanted was illegal, punishable by death.
Tony watched him, not knowing what to make of the whole situation. Nothing seemed to make sense anymore. The warm hand on his knee made him feel something. Something he hadn’t felt in a long time. “Why does anyone need to do it? I’ve taken care of all and any wounds.” Even in his own ears he sounded weak. Howard was right. Tony was disgustingly weak.
“He must be. James really likes him. He wanted me to know exactly who I would be meeting, we didn’t just sit around discussing you, don’t worry,” he clarified when he saw Tony’s face. “I’d already met Steve and Sarah. That only left you and Benni.”
“Fire department, call out!” Rhodey yelled, Steve following him and checking the right side while Rhodey searched the left. It was dark inside, not only from the grime covered windows not allowing sunlight through but the smoke was thick.
“He does not have me wrapped around his anything,” Clint countered, groaning when he heard the double entendre. Natalia grinned and leaned further forward on the counter to take in his embarrassment.
Clint tried to hold back, tried to swallow down the sobs and pull it together but it only made them burst forth all the more violently. His fingers continued to grip James’ clothes tightly and he tried to bury his face even further against James’ neck.
“I have just the room for you, my friend,” he said with a grin, his grey eyes bright and mischievous. He led Steve to the back to what he called his own private section of the brothel. It was even cleaner and luxurious. He opened the second door and told Steve to wait.
And he was. When Steve woke up, his head was hurting and he felt like someone had put his back through a cheese grater. It hurt to breathe and it didn’t take long for him to figure out that his wrist was broken either. He sighed and took a moment. He was just grateful to be alive.
“Ask me again in about nineteen years,” he scoffed, leaning back and rubbing his face, sighing again. Whatever it was he would be facing, whatever he needed to do to overcome what had been done to him, he could do it. Because now he knew for sure that there was no way he’d ever end up in a situation like that ever again. “Countless times I’ve prayed for help. And ever so often I dared to hope that it was finally over, that he’s had enough, that he might have died, that
“Let him come home first,” Sarah said and put her cup down with a smile. “There’s plenty of food ready for you.” Tony moved to stand behind the couch to calm his fast beating heart and his treacherous body that was way too sensitive when it came to Steve.
Tony looked around the room, completely in awe. His eyes fell on a brochure sitting on the table. It described the stops they would take along the way and also gave information about what to do in case of emergency. Apparently they were on the top deck out of three. It hadn’t occurred to Tony that there were different classes on this ship.
“I think we’re going to call it a night, everyone,” Steve told them with a small smile. He met James’ eyes and James raised a questioning eyebrow but Steve simply shook his head. He didn’t know what the issue was but maybe he had spent too long away from Tony today. A part of him secretly revelled in that; the idea that Clint’s presence really wasn’t enough, Tony still wanted him.
Tony choked out a laugh which was the last straw. He let go of the tears he had been holding in and cried in the safety of Steve’s arms, in the privacy that they had. He didn’t care about his injuries or how he looked. All he had wanted during captivity was to be in Steve’s arms.
Tony tasted better than Steve could have imagined and the fact that he couldn’t keep still, bucking into Steve’s mouth and moaning his name, made the whole experience that much better. Steve just wanted his first time as memorable and enjoyable as possible. He knew Tony wouldn’t last long, not only because he was inexperienced but because Steve was just about an expert by now.
“If you lot think this looks deadly wait till you see the dessert Jimmy’s made,” she said, looking over at the man who stood at the counter. He turned and grinned at Tony, drying his hands and coming to sit, also dressed in casual clothes though he had shown up in a suit. Had to keep up appearances, right?
Something in him, despite having no younger siblings of his own, had come alive in Tony’s presence. If Tony wasn’t actually who he said he was, if it was all just a very well-played act, Clint would feel like an idiot for wasting his food. If not, he would feel like a monster for not at least trying to share.
“Tony,” he said and he was smiling on the other end of the line, grateful and relieved to hear him sounding as though he were in one piece. He was not actually in a shooting mood today. “There in ten,” he told him and hung up. None of them really did ‘goodbyes’.
Howard died with a surprised look on his face, about to raise his hands and probably wanting to say something, maybe even beg for his life. He never got to do that. Tony turned around and gave Steve back his gun and nodded. James opened the door and let Tony out, followed by Steve. He whistled and said something in Russian and two men nodded to confirm whatever order they had been given.
“Grand. I mean that. Really,” he said, kissing him. He backed him onto the bed, hovering over him, his right hand up Tony’s shirt grasping at his chest while he kissed him. He pulled away briefly to say, “Her only condition is that we either use a guest room down the hall or we keep the noise down.”
He came into his office and found Tony there, bringing in reports, Falsworth with him as he always was, pretending that he was running the books and Tony was just his lackey who carried the documents.
The silence after his hearing aid died brought with it new torments, things he had never really discussed with Tony. Memories of the war, of coming home.
James stood up straight. “I’m going out of my mind here, Steve, but more than ever I want to just ball up all of that, push it aside, and focus on getting him back. When he’s in my arms, in our bed, then I can let all of this come out.” He paused, collected himself and said, “No matter what happens I need you to promise me something.”
“Mine too. Abusive drunk,” Clint admitted, figuring Tony was implying the same. “I do like alcohol, though, but I’m with you. Brandy’s my go to, smooth and sweet.”
Jones was standing outside the huge doors and when he caught sight of Tony, his expression softened. He scanned him quickly and padded him down, searching for any kind of weapons. The boy flinched and Jones didn’t appreciate that reaction.
“Love,” Steve called and was it awkward that Tony and James both turned? Well, yes. Yes, it was. “No, that one,” Steve said and pointed an unsteady finger at Tony. He put a grape in his mouth, holding it between his teeth. “Want some fruit?” He said around the grape.
“Steve,” Tony sighed softly. “I don’t see how one thing has to do with the other. I’m quite comfortable and as long as you are, just enjoy your… how did you put it? Basic human... something.”
It smelled a bit musty and Steve left the front door wide open and began opening the windows as well. He carried their luggage upstairs and got changed while he let Tony explore.
He sipped his whiskey, still deep in thought when Tony sat down beside him. “Let’s talk about it more when we get to the cottage,” Steve said, pressing a kiss to Tony’s head. He just wanted a little peace without having to think about anything bad. Maybe it was selfish because he knew he could do a lot for others like them but sometimes Steve was a little selfish.
“You sure? Because maybe Tony could give you some tips for next time.” Steve threw a roll at James’ head and he caught it and bit it.
Tony tried a few times but missed, so Steve moved to help him, coming to stand behind him, lining up their bodies. Tony was pressed against his chest and Steve reached out and placed his hands over Tony’s.
At first he was eager to see Howard’s face on those targets but it seemed more distracting than helpful. Shooting things relieved a lot of built-up tension in Tony’s body.
“Thank fuck,” Tony said, standing on shaky legs and Sam stood with him. Carol came to join them. “Can we see Rhodes?”
He shuddered, trying to play it off as a cold chill and nothing more. He cracked his neck and then remembered Tony had asked another question. “Some like to use bartenders as their own personal therapists. Some don’t want advice though, just a listening ear, which I prefer because my advice is shit. And then some people just need someone to talk to about
Tony waited for another punch that never came. Instead, he was yanked up and pushed back down to sit up on the cot. There was a flash and then the two men spoke in a foreign language with each other. They sounded angry. If only Tony knew what was going on!
She reached up to move his hair away from his forehead and spoke even softer than before, if that was even possible. “When you see him next, ‘cause I reckon he’ll be a wee bit scarce the next few days, talk to him. I know he’d appreciate it.”
. Tony thought of him as being treasure. “I love it.” He stroked his fingers lightly up and down Tony’s back as he spoke, a little nervous. “
Bakuto seemed to wake up at Steve’s words, lifting his head with visible difficulty. They fed him the bare minimum to keep him alive, giving him the bare minimum to drink. James had directed his men to come by randomly every few hours to bang on the door and disrupt his sleep, even tossing a cup of water over him should the mood hit. They wanted him as miserable as was humanly possible and then some.
“Thank you. It’s just… we don’t have any other family. I know we’re not family. Not that I don’t appreciate—I’ll just stop talking.” She gave his shoulders a squeeze and pressed a kiss on top of his head.
The man watched them, his eyes bloodshot from the lack of sleep and his skin pale. A shiver ran up his spine as the wind blew, that broken window in the back serving a purpose for Steve and James as it gave their hostage a little more incentive to answer.
He wasn’t quite ready to go on, to talk about the day they were moved, the day when he thought maybe James would be on the other side of that door and wasn’t and he definitely wasn’t ready to talk about the days that followed—the starvation, the freezing, not knowing if he could really trust Tony at first, or the beatings. Not yet.
Steve’s eyebrows went up in shock. Just him. What did that mean exactly? Had Steve actually made someone question towards whom they felt love? That he found hard to believe but harder still that Tony only liked him. He still didn’t totally understand but he would accept it. Kind of.
Tony hummed and closed his eyes thinking of the painting. He hummed in the back of his throat, unable to form a word.
“It already did,” Clint responded quietly and when James blinked, he felt a tear streak down his face. He hated having failed him.
“Firstly, Clint and Tony are alive and will stay alive until Bakuto gets what he wants,” Steve said.
Steve helped him to the stairs and they slowly made their way up in a comfortable silence until Steve chuckled softly and said, “They
Tony didn’t pay attention to the others in the room, only reacting slightly when Benni hugged him. Steve had been awake and now he was sleeping.
“Looking good, kiddo,” Dugan told him with the world’s smallest smile. A smile that Tony might have missed had he not been looking at him.
“Hello, little one.” Tony smiled and hugged his brother. Slowly he finally let himself feel at home and safe. He’d still see Howard, still feel like he was killing him over and over again. The most important thing was that they got out of there and were given a completely different life—Tony more than Benni. Tony checked his watch. There was quite some time before dinner.
Sarah headed upstairs to find Benni who was doing some Irish language homework she had given him. She wanted his help with lunch, feeling they might need something hardy, warm, and full of love today.
He felt the wind created by the slam of the door behind him and he waited, slowly going back to his mattress. He turned to Tony, his face still stinging from that last slap.
The next morning, after a tense night and lots of questioning from Tony about it, he stood in the deli, cracking his knuckles. The door opened, the little bells on it jingling and Steve turned to look at the man who entered. He was grinning.
Tony sat down at the most beautiful table he had ever seen. Everything was rich and beautiful. Even the people in the house. Sarah had a timeless beauty about her and if he didn’t know that she had a grown son, he wouldn’t suspect her to be old enough to have him. James seemed cold at first but he wasn’t. Both Steve and he were strong, tall, well-built men but they were more different than he had realized. He couldn’t help but admire James’ face and his eyes. What color were they? They seemed grey, sometimes even whitish and yet with a hint of green and a lot of blue.
The words all came out in Italian. He spoke faster than he usually did and he almost let his temper get the better of him.
Steve nearly choked on the coffee he was drinking, turning to Tony, both eyebrows raised and he laughed. “So you can say that but I can’t compliment your looks?” He wiped his handkerchief across his mouth and then said, “‘Course I will. But slowly. There’s no rush, love.”
They made it safely, surprised. They’d been exposed and it was nearing evening. It would've been a perfect time for an ambush but they counted their blessings instead and headed home.
Clint took pity on the kid, turning his attention to him and inadvertently bumping his leg on the table. He closed his eyes, letting the pain settle and then went back to his mission.
“Because when I saw you for the first time I felt like someone saw me. You made me feel like I belonged.” He spoke slowly, thinking about every word that was leaving his mouth. “Seeing you became my week’s highlight. And you threatened Howard because of what he did to me, you saw without having to be told. You knew what was going on but you didn’t brush it off like everyone else.”
Steve nodded, still processing that everything was alright and no one was hurt as he grabbed Tony’s hand and pulled him up with one swift movement, holding him to his side. He pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Back to bed?”
Steve stepped back and made his way for the door, pausing with his hand on the handle when Tony called out to him.
Would Steve prefer that? Just escape from everything? Maybe another time but that wasn’t who he was. He didn’t back down from a fight. He and Sarah were stubborn that way, determined others might call it.
“You sure will be,” he said, closing his eyes briefly. “Oh look, there’s my room service.” Dmitri came in with a tray of food and a glass of apple juice and sat it down on Dugan’s lap. “Thanks,
“You don’t even know what I signed up for,” James retorted, laying back down on Clint’s bare chest. “So if you happen to come across this goofball of a man, who likes me for me and not my money, and who makes me laugh so hard that I almost choked once, please tell him I love him no matter what he looks like.”
Steve chuckled. “How about a driver’s license first? I can already see the headline: Italian man parks in the middle of Times Square, the Irish mob shows up, everyone confused.”
“Finally,” James laughed, putting more food than seemed strictly necessary or graceful on his fork but his manner of eating was otherwise painfully proper. As were Steve and Sarah’s.
Tony sat down and looked at the files but every now and then he looked at Steve, listened to his voice—sometimes stern, sometimes a perfect American accent, other times very thick Irish—and at one point he got up and walked around the desk as much as the line allowed him to. Tony paid special attention to how naturally Steve unbuttoned his jacket when he sat down, straighten the back of his jacket, how he buttoned it up easily with one hand when he got up. He was very good at it. So good you’d miss it if you didn‘t know he was doing it.
He looked up at him again. “Okay,” he said quietly, pulling the tray closer and sitting it beside his bed but not touching it. Maybe they weren’t going to poison him before but perhaps things had changed now. Maybe they were using Tony. A nice, innocent face.
Steve stood in the hallway, wondering which room Tony was in since the doors were closed. He knocked on Benni’s but the boy was already asleep so he closed it softly and when he turned, Tony was peeking his head out of Steve’s bedroom and Steve went in, shutting the door behind him.
That night Tony showed her how to make fresh spaghetti, then used what was left of the ham to make them carbonara, a dish none of the others had ever heard of before. It was a simple but delicious meal.
Tony watched his brother being so much braver than he could ever be. Lucky was a nice dog but he didn’t expect to spend a lot of time with him. Benni on the other hand was immediately happy to have a dog there.
“Oh, I do want to stay here but I’m greedy and I want it all for myself. Imagine all the bread I could have without you here. So scram,” he said, making shooing motions with his hands. “So my theory for testing it out… yeah, you’re not gonna like it. It involves me yelling in the middle of the night to see what happens. Surprise!” he said, doing jazz hands.
Steve tilted his head back, looking up at the ceiling. This was all a lot to process. He’d never been more grateful for Dugan in his life and once this was all over he was getting a fat raise and invites to their family dinners. Steve would also be paying for his wedding if he married the girl he was courting.
“Someone yelled,” he told Clint. “It didn’t sound close. That way.” He pointed to the right from where the yelling had come. “How do we get them inside for you to take the key?”
Just as he promised, Tony only went out with someone watching his back. It made him paranoid and anxious but if it meant that Steve had one less thing to worry about, he would do it. Dugan and Jones took turns picking up Benni either with Tony or Sarah or without them. The weeks seemed to go by a lot slower now. Steve was especially tense and that set the mood for everyone working for him.
Tony hummed in confirmation. That would give him enough time to meet up with Pepper again if he wanted to, but his priority had to be Benni. Plus, Pepper had family coming from all over and they were doing the planning before the wedding at the end of March. He knew he would miss his little brother while they were away and Pepper had more than enough to do. Steve hadn’t given away any details about where they were going and if there was going to be a phone or not. Even if there was, Tony couldn’t imagine how expensive a call overseas was going to be.
Tony nodded, pretending to be deeply interested when in reality he really just wanted to ask about one person in particular. “And your captain… what was his name again?”
Steve looked up from his phone where he was checking the news and weather forecast, not having heard Bucky come in.
One Thursday, after counting only about twenty-eight dollars in the box, he had fully resigned. There wasn’t much he could do anymore, was there? And so he went to the kitchen, filled a can with fresh coffee and made sandwiches, closing the store and going to the address he knew so well. Maybe it was the cold, maybe it was the hunger, maybe it was the exhaustion but the way seemed much longer than before.
“Steve said he wants to be my last.” Just the thought of the conversation made Tony’s stomach and heart flutter. “He said he’s going to get me a ring even if we can’t get married for real. For a second I wondered if that was the right thing to do but I am selfish and said yes. I don’t want anyone else.”
He licked his lips that were bright pink and swollen from the kisses and then blinked a few times to get his thoughts in order. “I have some work to do with OFI after my shift. I don’t know how long I’ll be. I didn’t want to promise you a time and then have to cancel.”
Steve moved his hand to curl his fingers around Tony’s hand. He opened his eyes fully to the bright room, to James standing with his arm around Sarah and her there with her tissue and bright red nose. He gave them a small smile. Then his eyes found Tony and for a moment he forgot about his pain.
“I’m not trying to compare you to James. I’m trying to tell you that the more I got to know you, saw you take care of Benni, get up every day despite what you were going through, come see me and barely even flinch at being brought before a mob boss… I
Tony continued combing through Steve’s soft hair, his fingertips occasionally touching his earlobes. Who was dead, he wondered. Who would be worth mentioning? And then he realized who he meant.
Steve sighed deeply. “I’m just happy to have the two of you and don’t get used to me being this soft with ya.”
“No, it’s not all the time. Just earlier it was a bit much. It was a long day, that’s all,” he mumbled, hating himself for having said anything to begin with.
“I love ‘em. Dmitri and I convinced James and now we have a puppy. His name is Lucky. He’s a sweetheart, I promise,” Clint said, pinching off a piece of the spam and popping it into his mouth.
“No, you won’t. But it’ll be better if you learn to knock and wait for an answer before coming into my room.”
Tony let out a surprised sound, not having expected that at all, which made it so much better. There was nothing more attractive to him than Steve doing whatever it was he wanted to do. Preferably to and with Tony. The kiss also left him speechless and he didn’t know what to say.
Tony turned to James even though he really didn’t want to. “School ends at 2.30 pm. You don’t have to go. I’m sure Steve would be glad to have you here. Benni gets home alone most of the time,” he said and saw from the corner of his eye how Sarah moved to Steve, gently holding his hand. He was okay. Pale as a ghost. But alive.
Steve’s eyebrows pulled together and he knew that his face had reacted faster than his brain could catch up. How could he ever feel bothered by Tony seeking him out to talk to him? If anything, he felt privileged. So he ran with it, hoping Tony wouldn’t read too much into his words.
The next thing Tony remembered was hearing the clock again, now louder than before. He found himself on the couch, curled up and hugging a cushion. It was quite comfortable and he dared to close his eyes, stretch a little but where there should have been more of the couch and more room for Tony, he hit someone while stretching. His immediate reaction was to jump up and get ready to run. Then he recognized Steve.
“You met Sarah?” he asked, surprised. “Ah, that’s nice. She’s the best. And Steve…” He took a deep breath, hoping that would help with the pain he felt. “We were ordering meat and vegetables the day they took me. I wanted to make a second dessert because Sarah said we would need a lot of food for all the guests.” He pursed his lips. Why was he even talking about that?
“You look grand! Where’d ya get that from?” She turned him and nodded in approval. “Wear this when you pick me up for a dance?”
James was still at the door, looking very smug. “Don’t worry. I’ve managed to work out an agreement with a handful of willing ones. Besides, if they go to the cops, they go to jail too.” The door shut and Steve turned around, the reality of the situation sinking in and he smirked.
Tony kept staring at the sleeping Steve who stirred in his sleep, wincing every now and then and going very still again. No matter how heavy his eyes got, Tony forced himself to keep them open and keep looking at him.
Steve watched Tony process his words and he nodded before realizing what it meant. Steve had already gone back to kissing him, his lips on Tony’s neck when Tony tried to sit up, horror clear on his face.
“Hmm,” Steve said. He knew he was lying. At least partially, but he also knew if he spoke more right now there was a chance everything would come rushing out at once.
It was fifteen minutes later that Natalia arrived, mad at Clint for making her dig for her key, found the dead man in the storeroom and called James, asking if it was his handy work.
“That’s lovely. Let’s eat together? Steve is running late for some business.” He took the envelope and offered his arm to Sarah.
“Yes,” he answered, knowing the doubt might come back from time to time but Clint was pretty damn persuasive.
Sarah sighed as she came into the kitchen, sensing that they were up to no good, and shook her head. She made James and Steve sit back down, and sent Tony to get Benni who was playing with Lucky in his room while she herself set the table. Benni had taken to Lucky and used every free minute to play with the dog.
“Alright…” he said with a small smile and got up to collect him things that were all over the floor. Remembering last night made him forget about his other worries for now. “I really should go to the little one,” he mumbled and could feel how hot his ears were.
He reached into his pocket and Dugan paled. “It’s a knife. Does not mean I am not happy to see you though,” he told him, his voice serious despite the words coming out.
Steve sat on the side of the bed contemplating if he was more hungry or tired. Eventually hunger won out and he stood, stretching, and picked up his shirt from where he’d left it folded last night, not even bothering to put it on.
“I think I could do that but one word about how small I look in a pair of your sweats and I’m out of here, Rogers.”
—” He tapped his chin in thought, mumbling in Italian “— the seasons! In Italian they say the seasons have something to do with who you’re going to be. Which is why Benni is shy and calm but warm and easy, because he was born in August. For me they say I am very hot-headed and feisty, sometimes too hot, sometimes too cold.” He shrugged, uncomfortable with talking about himself.
Maria and Natalia exchanged a look. Natalia raised her eyebrows and Maria shrugged one shoulder. Apparently, they were having a conversation. After a few more facial movements and subtle shrugs and head tilts, Natalia spoke.
you won’t have to be here much longer. I just don’t want to do anything to jeopardize your recovery,” James said softly, pressing a kiss to his hair and then another to his forehead. Clint hummed in appreciation for the forehead kiss and James gave him a few more, looking up when he heard someone knock on the door.
“Steve’s bed is so warm and soft, add him to the mix with his muscles and him sleeping without a shirt and you got yourself the best thing ever. He’s so tall and strong. If he wanted he could just hide me away from everything and everyone and I love that.” He blushed again and this time he could feel how warm his cheeks were.
James had spent the last few weeks asking around about purchasing a plane of his own. The first few people he had called had laughed and James had quickly silenced them by throwing out a few figures he found not only entirely possible to pay but also had called them ‘a bargain.’ He’d enjoyed listening to the sudden silence on the other end of the phone and then the subsequent stammering until they let him know that they weren’t actually able to sell him a commercial plane.
Steve warmed at the words, grinning and ducking his head. He was so happy he didn’t know what to do. When he finally looked up, he could barely contain his smile. “Well, I’m glad to hear it.”
Benni sat in the middle between Sarah and Tony and on Tony’s right was Steve. Usually Tony didn’t like to be cornered like that but with Steve on one side and Benni on the other it didn’t feel uncomfortable at all. Steve offered him some of his popcorn and Tony thanked him silently while taking some of it.
to me.” He knew it still happened to James too but that also wasn’t totally his business to share. “You’ve got a lot going on. A lot to manage. It’s not easy.”
“Let’s make it small. Dmitri, take Dugan and bring down the maps from the storeroom as well as a phone book. We have a lot of calls to make.”
The first man put the tray down beside Tony and the other came over to Clint, his tray in his hand, and sat it down, crossing his arms over his chest. He stood there in front of Clint, looking down at him. He kicked Clint’s outstretched foot, taunting him.
“Ya cracked your ribs,” Dugan told him and he finally looked over at Dugan and Tony, giving them a small smile but he winced and the smile faded completely as he remembered.
Tony and Clint were sitting in the corner of a room, hands clasped together, leaned against each other asleep, covered in blood and bruises, obvious tear streaks on their faces. In the second photo they were awake, hands raised to protect their faces and there was no third picture. There was no telling if they had been hurt more or not. No way to know if how they saw them in those pictures was the last bit of terror inflicted on them.
But he wasn’t sure. Maybe this was a one time thing for Steve. It would be embarrassing to text him if it was. But if it wasn’t and Steve didn’t text, how would he know?
Eating a meal in a diner of all places in the middle of the afternoon with his partner and a man he could comfortably think of as family was not something James had seen in his future before he met Clint. The idea of retirement appealed more and more as the days went on.
He turned to Tony, holding out the supplies left by Nurse Mary. “Take these. They’re better than anything you can buy at the pharmacy.” Steve turned without another word and walked off, taking another exit out of the gym.
“I don’t know,” Tony said and shrugged. It was a half-truth. He knew where he could find his father but it wasn’t like his father told him where he was going and when or why. All Tony knew was he took money from the register for whatever he was doing. “You’re probably not asking because you want to see him, sir?” he dared to give the man the slightest grin and looked right back down.
Steve followed, right on his heels, already strategizing as he walked and James agreed or disagreed with his proposals. Before they knew it, they had been planning the rescue for an hour, neither having changed or bathed yet.
Clint had lied to Steve. He hadn’t lost his grip, he’d flailed out of bed at a nightmare, tried to land on his feet, and then fell onto his bottom when that endeavor sent a fire up the left side of his body. He was dizzy with pain and recovering from the nightmare when Steve of all fucking people knocked on his door. The one person in the house he didn’t want to talk to at that moment.
“We’re taking a break,” he told him and Falsworth nodded and took back his hand, shaking it to make it stop throbbing.
Fifteen different clothing stores and a handful of other specific retailers later, Dmitri was opening James’ car door for them to make their way back home. James slid inside and Dmitri started it up, pulling out of their parking space and checking on James in the mirror.
“It’s really important and I know that only you can do it.” Benni’s eyes widened but he awaited his assignment as patiently as he could. “I need you to take care of your
“How’s Ireland?” He asked and thought back to the green painting in Steve’s room. “Once. When I was eight, I believe. Spent a whole summer in the village where my mom was born.” He smiled when he thought of that memory.
“You okay?” he asked after a moment, unable to stop himself from asking. Tony looked so young and evil spy or not, he had taken a beating.
Steve’s eyes widened and James leaned forward as well now, wanting to keep his voice as low as possible. He told Steve everything in the minutest detail, not leaving out a single thing about this situation.
Unfortunately, he was wrong. He heard them speaking and one called for Tony to come out. They probably thought he was a homeless person looking for shelter from the wind.
“They loved him but they were always talkin’ dirty of the ‘deviant’ people,” he said, doing air quotes with one free hand. “His sister knew before she passed. She didn’t care, loved her brother.” James’ sister, Anna, caught him and Steve one day and she had more questions than anything else. She really liked Steve and was just happy that it seemed he’d be around for a long time. She passed in a car accident along with his parents. James loved his parents but losing her had been harder on him.
“I did but then I wanted to hear your voice.” Oh, smooth, Rogers. “And also, I, uh… I’m stuck, actually,” he laughed. Even though he sounded nervous, his laugh was still such a nice sound. “I wanna take you somewhere you’ll enjoy but I realize I don’t actually
Tony was stunned silent. No one had ever cooked for him. No one but Rhodey but that wasn’t the same as this. The sheer amount of effort Steve had put into this was enough to make his hands sweaty and his knees weak.
He held his hands out for Steve to change the bandages and sanitize the wounds again because that was who his Steve was.
“That I do. Last time she was here, she talked my ear off about you,” Pinky said with a chuckle. “But that’s lovely. You always did have that big brother quality about ya.”
Tony shifted again, leaning closer to Steve. He knew that Steve had feelings for another or at least that he used to. Whatever the current situation was, didn’t matter. But Tony still needed to ask the question.
“Steve. If you’re watching this, I’m dead. Thanks for that, by the way. I love being dragged into shit post-retirement.”
“That’s not what I want now, by the way. I know we had our little heart-to-heart. Doing the team thing. But—” He straightened up and raised his index finger, frowning all the same. “—I keep going back to it. I keep wondering. I mean, don’t get me wrong: I am in love with my wife. Giving Morgan a good future is worth dying for, but I wonder now, staring down the barrel of my own mortality,” Stark leaned forward.
“I don’t want to die, Steve. I want to go back to my lake house and forget all of this. I can’t, though. You know I can’t. Everyone knows I can’t. That’s why you all showed up on my step in the first place. You knew I couldn’t walk away from this once you put it in my head that I could fix it.” Stark leaned back and rubbed at his chest as though it were aching.
.” Tony shrugged. “Suddenly it hit me: I wanted your approval. You had Dad’s approval, which meant that if you approved of me, indirectly, Dad would have approved of me because he approved of you.” Both of Tony’s hands rose to cover his face. “Some kind of Freudian Oedipal Hellscape from the nightmares of adult men everywhere, I know.” A deep groan followed. Tony slid down in the chair and dropped both of his arms.
“You know, Pepper and I almost didn’t get married because of you.” He laughed, but it was dry, bitter, a little melancholy. “After the snap, once Danvers brought me home, I kept running scenarios about how to undo it. I couldn’t come up with anything by myself. I said I was done, but I needed to really convince myself. I was stuck in my own head, playing it back. Pep wanted me to let it go, but I spent weeks obsessing. When I couldn’t figure out how to fix it, I got caught up on how I might have stopped it in the first place. I ran simulations. What if Bruce and Natasha had ended up together? What if Thor had been here sooner? What if Vision had lived? It kept coming up the same, so I kept going back further.”
On the screen, Tony paced the floor. He was in his personal quarters in the Avengers facility. He looked weary. Absently, he fiddled with the drawstring on his hoodie, and finally he threw himself into a bowl chair.
“I found a scenario where it never happened in the first place. A scenario where we were ready for Thanos. Where we stopped him.” Tony drew in a deep breath and then exhaled heavily, cheeks puffing.
“I left them a video, too.” He rose, left the frame, and returned holding an Iron Man helmet. He set it in his lap when he sat again, and drummed his fingers on its surface. “Not sure if it’s morbid or not. I mean, disembodied head? It was easier to talk to them while looking into Iron Man’s eyes. When I look at him, at… me…” Tony palmed the helmet and held it up, inspecting that golden face. “I believe I can do anything. It was easier to tell them it would be okay, even if I didn't come home.”
He wrung his hands, stared at the floor. Silence settled over him for a moment, brief though it was.
Tony listened, his smile growing with every sentence he heard. It was exactly what he wanted to hear, it wasn’t dark or terrible and it taught him more about Clint. “That’s really funny. It’s weird to think that you’re married and it’s not James.”
“Say no more. But he, uh…” Clint trailed off again and looked away, cursing himself for the way his body was reacting, his eyes shining with tears and breath hitching. James and Natalia both squeezed the hand they were holding, waiting patiently. “He can’t get to us, right?” he asked, his voice barely more than a whisper, one single tear falling down his cheek that James was quick to wipe away with a thumb.
Bakuto, the leader of Steve’s least favorite group, reported that business was good as usual. He dealt heavily in people-trafficking. Mostly from poor East Asian countries, promising them better lives in America where he actually brought them to be prostitutes and exotic dancers. Steve knew he’d been to a few risqué clubs in his life and he was a regular at James’ brothel but those were owned and stocked by James and his men. He knew they either offered to come or did it to pay the bills.
meat? That was something he couldn’t say no to. With every spoonful he hummed in delight and was first to finish his portion.
She knew what her son meant wasn’t that she would actually be bored but that what they had to say might just turn her stomach and give her nightmares herself. She shook her head gently to remove those thoughts and then said, “I think I might have a solution to the first issue.”
“Do you think they thought we’d given up or just wouldn’t make it in time?” Steve asked, his voice trembling on the last words.
Steve could barely even focus on anything happening around them, too much on his mind with what the night promised.
“Met him in February, he tried to stab me and I kissed him in June,” he said, casually as if everyone had their first kiss that way.
Tony leaned into Steve’s touch and shook his head. “I won’t leave you. I’m glad I could be there for you,” he answered honestly. “Though I should call
“All I know is that Beniamino is safe and quite happy. And Steve, he told me I could do whatever I wanted to do, which means that I never have to see Howard ever again.” He leaned against the counter and looked at the plates in front of him. “I was certain he would kill me. He wanted to and he tried to, too. I don’t know what it was but something made him stop and he couldn’t. Not only that but I was brought to a hospital, I was given medicine. You took my brother under your wing when you didn’t have to. I half expect to wake up from this dream any second now.”
“Steve!” He cupped Steve’s face between his hands, taking a moment. “You gave me all the money I could ever need for a fresh start. You’ve asked me so many times if I wanted to go somewhere else to start over. No matter how many times you ask me or how much money you give me, I will not leave you unless you ask me to.”
“You got ‘em all pretty well. What about me?” Benni scrunched up his nose and grabbed a white crayon and held it up to compare to Steve’s skin and he laughed. A real laugh, one that made his eyes go small and he tilted back his head.
“I really did. Ma, if we could, I’d marry him,” he said seriously. It was her turn to look surprised.
“Because of what? Your feelings?” He asked and reached out to place his hand on top of Steve’s. “I don’t think you’re disgusting.” He bit back another sigh. “You’re still Steve, aren’t you?”
Steve sighed again. He knew getting frustrated wasn’t going to help anyone. The sooner they were out of the city, the better. He, too, was in dire need of some rest and relaxation.
He sighed, letting his mind wander and he quickly found his attention divided. On one side there was his beautiful, deadly partner who loved him right there in front of him and on the other there was Tony and Steve’s house and living there temporarily. He knew, he felt it in himself, that that awful crushing weight on his chest got lighter around Tony. He wanted that feeling again and he hoped it was the same for Tony.
He stood and made his way downstairs, grabbing an apple as he passed, and going into the basement and through the passageway. Somedays he truly valued the protection afforded him by keeping his home a secret. Other days, he wished he could walk out as freely as his mother did.
The night with Tony helped in some ways and hurt in others. He felt like he had made some kind of progress with him. Like he was perhaps opening up a way to one day... It was dumb and wrong, he knew. And unfair. But he still felt that way.
. I didn’t. I swear. Even when he told me to follow Barton, it was only in hopes that he would lead me to you,” Loki told him. “I had nothing to do with him being taken. Or whoever he took from you.” He glanced at Steve. “Are you going to kill me?” Loki asked, tentatively.
Tony woke up panicked, only that his panic was silent, showing in his eyes. Hearing Steve’s voice helped.
“Holy—” he said, leaping up off the couch, more than certain Tony was awake and at the very most finally disgusted and at the very least shocked. He moved away from the couch, panicking and stammering. “I—sorry, I didn’t realize where I was—I thought—sorry. Feckin’ hell,” he said, slapping his hands over his face and breathing into them. Couldn’t he just have a moment of peace?
“You hungry?” James asked, knowing better than to dwell on Clint’s confessions right now. He knew he should wait a little bit, give Clint a breather and then double back if Clint wanted to discuss anything he had said in more detail.
“Fire department, call out!” Sam yelled and heard the tiniest whimper come from the corner of the room. He headed towards the sound and found a teenage girl. “Lieutenant, I got her!”
“Squad cleared the first level and basement, that smoke’s getting pretty dark. Everyone out now,” Steve commanded, counting as his firefighters on engine, truck, and the squad team came out of the house. Moments later, there was a small explosion and the roof collapsed in. “Alright 616, let’s put it out.”
“You’re an abomination,” he spat, and he hit him again but this time Steve hit him back, slamming their foreheads together and Falsworth staggered back.
“You are what?” Sarah asked, taking the seat on the other side of Clint and leaning in to press a kiss to his cheek.
Tony blushed for some irrational reason when Steve pulled the covers away. After last night there was really no reason anymore, was there? At first he didn’t understand what Steve was apologizing for.
Tony had thought a lot about this, had been impatiently waiting to get rid of the bandages. Yes, because he couldn’t use his left arm but also because of this. “I have been cleared to use it. There’s no pain. At least not in my arm.” Tony looked back at James. He wanted to ask him why he was there. Why he cared. Simply
He’d been sending Steve letters, love letters, some disgustingly graphic, some intimate details of Steve’s body. Things no one else could possibly know unless they’d seen him naked.
“I might, yes. Apparently, we get a curtain for privacy. Some kisses might be in order as well if we encounter turbulence,” James said innocently.
“It will be strange to fly again,” Clint said, his voice sounding further away and it snapped James out of his momentary bliss. He looked up to see that half-glazed look in Clint’s eyes that he got whenever he talked about the war. James really hoped seeing France in its beauty, seeing the wonderful parts of it, would actually help to ward off some of the more aggressive flashbacks. He knew it wasn’t a cure, more of a balm, but better than nothing.
Tony woke up to Steve’s voice, which made it impossible to doubt where he was. Usually he always had at least a few seconds of panic upon waking. What if getting out of there had just been a dream?
invest in some silence,” James said roughly and Bakuto shut up instantly. James still didn’t look at Steve nor anyone else, his eyes on the papers he had in front of him—reports from them all, the work Tony had been helping Jones organize that morning.
Once a year every year on the first Monday of the last week of March, all the mob heads met to discuss territory, product, and price. Normally it was the head and their next in charge, which meant Steve and Dugan. Steve, being head of the second largest mob in all of New York, sat nearest the head of the table normally. With James away and not seeming to be coming back even for this meeting, Steve looked to the empty seat at the head of the table where the most feared man in the North East normally sat.
“For Avengers business, yes,” Jarvis confirms.  “Do you feel this recording is a direct threat to the Avengers’ Initiative?”
James’s expression is dangerous. Predatory, even, but Bruce understands why Clint isn’t making a run for it. That would only make things worse. Thankfully once Clint’s down on his rear, James lowers the scissors a few inches.
“Then by all means, come entertain me.  If you get bored watching me work, you can tell me everything there is to know about art pads.”
Steve ducks his head, looking shy and embarrassed when Tony walks inside.  The room is a time capsule straight out of 2005.  An eighteen year old Steve’s 2005, much to Tony’s delight.  He turns slowly to take it all in.
“We’ve got insurance,” Tony forces himself to continue. “I’ll give you a head start to get out of the country once you’ve got it.”
“That wasn’t our last conversation or anything.  We had a couple of days between that night and when she...”  Steve trails off.  “But I wasn’t talking to her much, and she didn’t have a lot to say to me.  I’d said a couple things I think were still smarting.  I wish I’d have just kept my mouth shut, you know?  All I was hoping for was that she’d take a chance on being happy and somehow I got it all wrong.”
He steps away so he won’t be in the frame. He watches as Steve smiles like a little kid, and moves on to holding up other sticks and pucks and Tony can’t help but smile. He’s smiled more in the last 48 hours than he’d smiled in the two months previous. Steve poses with another piece of memorabilia and then puts it back in its place carefully.
“I stopped asking their names.  It didn’t matter.  And I’m not seeing a doctor.  Just go.  Leave me alone,” Tony pleads.
Steve pulls his shirt off, too, and groans with the effort of moving his arms.  He has never been so sore without a building collapsing on him first.
“Mr. Stark?” the security guard asks incredulously, with all the rebuke a native New Yorker can manage in just two words.  “As in Tony Stark?  You got an appointment?”
“He’s alive and stable,” Bruce says. “The worst of it is that we had to cut a lot of the wires between his nervous system and his arm. It won’t work when he wakes up.”
Steve glances in the rear view mirror and sees Clint shove at Natasha like they’re brother and sister and all of 6 years old.
Steve naively thinks they might get a couple thousand views by Christmas if they’re lucky. The video shatters every 24/48/72 hour record that’s ever been set on YouTube.
“Of course, if that’s what you want,” Bruce says. “Before I go grab him though, let’s make a plan. Even if you’ve agreed to letting him in, that doesn’t mean he gets to stay as long as he wants. He gets to stay as long as
“I’m sorry I wasn’t more attentive,” Steve says. “I’m sorry I gave you reason to worry. I would never consider going home with someone else. I don’t want to be with anyone but you.”
The soldier considers Bruce’s offer and then steps closer when Bruce reaches out half the spongy yellow bar to him. Bruce is reminded sadly of a stray dog he and Betty used to see on campus back in the day. The poor thing had been about as wary of human kindness and food handouts as the soldier is now. The comparison only amplifies when the man sniffs the food cautiously before taking a hesitant bite.
“It’s not a bad thing to be generous,” Steve clarifies.  “When I was trying to get into art school, I could barely afford the pencils.  If SI produced art pads, maybe I could put some of my money into buying them and sending them out to kids.  Or adults.  Anyone who needs one and can’t afford it.”
“SHIELD was HYDRA in sheep's clothing,” Bruce says, unhappily.  “And I think that explains a lot about some of the medical ethics I witnessed there first hand.”
“Actually, before we get to that, maybe we should start small,” Bruce suggests. “There’s a ham in the fridge.”
Steve’s back to speaking to Dum-E and U in a low, kind voice, and Tony digs his fingers into his palm.
“A lot of somethings happened at work,” Steve says. “Every single IT person at SHIELD came to find me at some point today to meaningfully and sincerely apologize for having teased me when I first woke up from the ice.”
Clint takes a second before he answers. “I trust that Tony will do what he says. If he tells Bruce it’s just between them and you, that’s how it will be. I guess I just wouldn’t be as sure he won’t see you as more a science experiment. Sorry, Bruce.”
Oh, and we find out Steve's big secret eventually, I swear.  Maybe even next chapter if Steve and Tony can behave themselves!
Tony doesn’t realize he’s on the floor until JARVIS speaks. He’s also not sure how much time has passed. Tony’s got his back to the wall and his head resting against his knees. “Sir, Captain Rogers is calling. He’s insisting I put him through.”
But this morning, Tony wants to find Bruce, because Bruce left some new design specs on Tony's desk and they are
“I still want to be an Avenger but I want to retire from SHIELD,” Steve continues.  “I’ve been thinking about it for a while now.  Just-- didn’t know what to do with myself, I guess.  And I still don’t know what I’m going to do with myself, but I figure now’s as right a time as any to try.”
Steve scoops up Natasha in his arms and prays he’s not making her injuries worse. He runs the six blocks to the nearest hospital at a sprint. Jarvis must have sent word ahead because there are already nurses and doctors waiting for Natasha’s arrival with a guerney. The nearest doctor explains that Clint’s there already and being prepped for surgery. Still alive. Expected to live.
She does a waggle with her finger and the audience roars with laughter.  Even the hosts can’t keep their composure.
“Drink all of this,” she says, handing Tony the water. “Take two of these,” she indicates the pain pills, “and sleep it off. I’ll leave Steve’s on his nightstand. He knows what to do.”
What Steve’s supposed to do with this much hurt and heartbreak, he’s not sure.  He can go to his room.  Close his door.  Stare at the ceiling. Take off running somewhere, or wander aimlessly around New York.  It doesn’t really seem to matter.
If Steve could have stopped time and bottled that moment he would have.  Eventually Jarvis interrupts to remind Tony that Pepper is expecting him upstairs.
The scanner is genius. The small scanning brick is sleek and white and could pass for a phone except there’s no screen. The longer baton lays on any surface and slits open to project a surprisingly clear holograph above it. The hologram can be swatted through to move pictures forward and backward. It also sends all the information to Bruce’s phone so he can look at the images later or send them to JARVIS for a second opinion.
“He saw me in Salzburg and he’s been following me ever since. Not to keep me in line, apparently. He was extremely clear that I could have smashed whole villages and he’d have been cheering me on from the sidelines.  I guess in his mind we were traveling together.”
Tony’s voice is a little shaky but the relief rolls off of him in waves. Steve pulls Tony near so he can give him a proper hug. When he lets go, they stay close, settling against each other comfortably.
Steve thinks it over.  Thinks about the lonely nights he’d spent in that flat in DC.  Remembers the night he found Fury in the dark.  Ears everywhere.  The gun shot.  The chase.  The Winter Soldier.
“He’s bad news, Bruce. I know what went down with him and Steve, and if there’s ever been anyone who appreciates seconds chances it’s me. But just-- don’t get your hopes up that he’s not gonna try and murder us both in our sleep. That’s gonna take time. Scruples don’t happen overnight.”
“Stooooop,” Tony groans, biting back a smile of his own. “You’re delusional. I created a new element, you know that right? I was in like every science journal ever. Twice. If you want to be proud of something be proud of that. All I’m doing now is not drinking. Any person with an ounce of self-control can do the same. It’s not impressive.”
It’s obvious these aren’t common words or concepts for him. Bruce thinks it’s a good sign he can express this shit at all.
