They sat at the sofa in front of the fireplace, cuddled together. Sherlock was curled on John’s lap, his long legs all over the place. John was massaging Sherlock’s skull gently with his fingers, curling them around his locks of soft raven hair. It was so soothing to hear the detective’s slow breathing. He smelled of a mixture of tobacco, ash, and a faint trace of sweat. It was something familiar to John. Something that not only hadn’t changed, but had intensified. His enhanced senses now allowed him to distinguish even more details, and he discovered he could detect scent trails now. Rosie would have a hard time in the future playing hide and seek.
Yet he remembered, even from his human days, his mother telling him she hoped someday he found someone that could make him happy.
With John’s voice whispering lowly in his ear and his muscles contracted in controlled pressure against Sherlock’s cock, the dormant beast inside him awoke and flipped both of them so John was underneath him resting on the pillows. He growled, deep and animalistic, mouth still firmly closed with teeth clenched, and buried his face in John’s armpit, sniffing the spot where his mate’s body odour was most intense. John moaned and made a surprised little sound when Sherlock took both his legs and settled them over his arms, making room so he could thrust more fervently.
A couple of years ago with the arrival of the new century, a brilliant young mind had overtaken the British government that his father had been serving. Corruption extended through the most influential parts of government, and the leader of the Neolithic Revolution raised itself with the power and the control. In just a few months, the politics of terror spread through London and, later, throughout Great Britain: the dystopians had been considered a pest. Now, being dystopian was punishable by law, and penalties ranged from going to prison to paying a fine, passing through the firing squad at dawn. In the slums of the city, Sherlock had heard that if you were interesting to the Leader, he compensated you by letting you live. And by serving him they would forgive you. But, you had to be interesting.
The training session had been good. It was stimulating and surprisingly fun. Sherlock had given him a few strength tests to see how far he could go and then he monitored his speed by making him run on a treadmill. In the end, they established that John was proportional in strength and speed  to how he had been as a human. His reflexes were agile but Sherlock, with his long legs, could outrun him without much effort.
Wings folded at his back, invisible to humans, he walked to a military graveyard in search of a good name he could fit himself into. Creating fake memories was easier if the name had a good enough background. The echoes of the souls that once lived were still whispered at the stones beneath his fingers.
“As you know, I’ve been checking John’s future for three years already, and until now everything seemed quite normal. All things considered. None of the triggers I left in place has been activated, except for one.”
Even after John rose again as a vampire, this would remain an emotional moment he could not avoid. Sherlock had thought he would do this another way, in a situation where John had accepted every step of the process and they were alone. Definitely not in a despicable alley, on a winter night, both of them covered in blood and trash.
could fly away. The good thing of the animals spirit was that they could be mistaken for the real ones if they were seen from afar, so a dystopian who had relatively common animal had more chances to go unnoticed that someone who, like his brother, exhibited a Chinese dragon.
“You were wondering about what I said before, about my pirate days,” Sherlock said, his voice suddenly very loud in the room.
Every second he spent not being busy, his mind went back to the memory of soft, feverish lips against his, to the tender skin under his fingers and the hungry sensation of a thirsty man tasting water for the first time after leaving the desert.
Within the group they had a bit of variety. A pair of Spanish soldiers, Christian and Silvia, who had arrived in the early months of the change and were trapped there, an Irish woman called Wanda with a fondness for explosives which was very disturbing, three frenchmen who had survived to the attack on their platoon, and a pair of retired soldiers from the US Marine Corps, which the dictatorship had caught them and closed the fronteers while they were on holidays in London.
“How can you have a day without a night? You’re the book that I have opened…” John slowly opened the door, hoping Sherlock wouldn’t hear him. “And now I’ve got to know much more…” Sherlock was washing his hair, his eyes closed, completely unaware that he had an audience.
Sherlock just chuckled to himself, drinking his tea. “I-I don’t…” John could hardly formulate words. First, he finds Sherlock is bloody royalty and now the Queen was asking him out for Sherlock? He could only imagine that he was dreaming.
“I’m tired.” John frowns and I make my exit, closing my bedroom door and laying down on the cold covers. I listen to John in the kitchen, preparing leftovers for his dinner and then turning on the telly as he eats. The static of the telly pulls me into a daze, eyes closing but not fully immersed in sleep. I’m on the brink, breathing deep and mind soothing into a blank when I hear my door open with a creak. I don’t move or give any indication of being aware. “Sherlock?” John whispers, making sure I’m asleep before closing my door again. He foolishly stands right outside it, believing me to be asleep while he makes his call. “Mycroft.” There is a pause before he continues. “It’s a danger night.” He may think it’s a clever code name but it’s blatantly obvious. John and Mycroft use this whenever they believe I am craving. Well deduced this time around but I won’t give him the satisfaction of knowing that. “Of course I’m not bloody sure. It’s Sherlock for Christ sake.” I’m well and truly out of options now. Mycroft will be watching 221and CCTV for any attempted escape I may have. The fat bastard. “Yeah, I’ll sleep on the couch incase.” He hangs up and goes up the stairs, changing his clothes and most likely grabbing bedding to use on the couch. He’s going to regret it in the morning.
When John woke up, he frowned to see the bed empty beside him but the door opened and there stood Sherlock with a plate of food and two cups of coffee.
“Don’t make promises you don’t intend to keep.” I gave up on going past him and made some distance between us.
He made his way to the door and slowly pushed it open. The sun had begun to set, casting a warm glow on the teenager that sat in front of the instrument. His brother was seven years older than him but he acted like it was thrice that. His brother was their parents favorite and they did little to hide that, he was perfect in every way that mattered to them. It was clear, early on that Sherlock would be in every way opposite of his elder brother and Sherlock resented him for it. But with all of his jealousy, he still craved his brothers attention, he still looked up to him.
John’s eyes opened tiredly, having accidentally fallen asleep. He smiled to himself as he looked upon Sherlock, protectively curled on the opposite side of the bundle between them. In this bed lay his family and the two people he loved most in all of this world.
“Sherlock, are you ready? We’re going to be late!” John stood by the door, holding on to Sherlock’s coat. He came out of the bedroom, his hair perfectly messy, though John knew he had spent quite a bit of time on it. He smiled as Sherlock walked up to him, giving him a kiss. “You look very handsome.”
“Right. I get it.” The man chuckled and walked off, heading for the door. Sherlock watched him leave.
The rest of the day he lay in bed and watch the rain fall against his window, no one came to get him for dinner. The boredom grew exponentially as his anger slowly subsided and he thought about wanting to fly away again. Thoughts leaked into dreams as he finally fell asleep.
. Greg drove them back in relative silence, both John and Sherlock in the back, still covered in blankets with the heat blasting in Greg’s car.
Sherlock glared at Yates, ready to fling any insults he could think of but the reminder of his fathers silent warning, eased his retort. “Because, this is stupid. I’m not crazy.” He grumbled and
“Mum! Please! He lost everyone…his family…they’re gone.” John’s eyes watered, the pain this dragon felt was close to home for him. His mother could see the tears starting to well and she sighed.
There was a heavy weight on John when he woke up the next morning. His eyes fluttered open to investigate, only to stare in shock as the source of the weight turned out to be the white dragon he had rescued the night before. It’s wings were tucked in close, the tail wrapped around one of John’s legs and the head buried into his neck. John’s heart raced for a moment before he calmed down and watched the white dragon sleep. The only sign that the dragon was still asleep was the small rise of its body as it took in deep breaths. John had no idea when the dragon had decided to leave the nest.
John walked as fast as he could until he got out of sight and then ran as best as he could with his haul. He ran up to the cottage and froze, the contents he held, falling to the ground with a thud. The door was open, claw marks down the door as if there were a struggle.
“Let me get him something to eat, I’ll catch up with you in a bit.” John pulled a huffing Sherlock away from the crowd.
Sherlock cleared his throat and stood up a bit straighter. “John, will you go with me, on date Saturday?” He felt like his heart would burst out of his chest.
Dinner was dreadful. Sherlock sat and stared at his plate, pushing around the peas. He hated peas. Besides, he wasn’t hungry and he wanted to go dissect the bird. His parents and brother were discussing something about black holes or whatever, who cares. He knew his parents would make him eat the peas so when they weren’t looking, he put some on his fork and let them quietly fall into his cupped hand on his lap. He pretended to chew and swallow the imaginary peas until they were all in his hand hidden by the table.
“What do you want me to say Sherlock? I don’t care if you like girls or boys or both. That doesn’t change who you are or our friendship.”
“Queen Mary Reservoir, Surrey. A body washed up on shore, no identification, no missing persons filed. But he’s wearing a suit…obviously someone important but his body is all, expanded. It’s disgusting-“
Sherlock had brought me into his world of crime and danger and I couldn’t look back. The war…though it brought me night terrors and caused the constructing of my chest at times, I did miss it. That’s a deranged thing to say, having seen so many men and boys dying before my eyes. People that I had come to see as brothers and dear friends…
“There is something you wish to ask me, just say it.” Sherlock put his book down and stared at him expectantly.
“I would do anything for you Sherlock. You know that don’t you?” I held him closer, impossibly close as if he would disappear if I let go.
They were ushered in and his father came over and hugged Sherlock quickly. Mycroft walked into the foyer and greeted them. John had been behind Sherlock, going rather unnoticed amongst the taller crowd.
His breath was laboured as he lay in the stream, pretending to push off the body of the beast and crawling back onto the shore. He wiped off the blood, dripping from his sword and placed it back in his belt loop. He flopped back on to a rock and let the warm sun soak into his cold skin, slowly drying his clothes. His mother would be upset that he dirtied his clothes again. He put aside the helmet and closed his eyes, being lulled by the warmth of the sun and the soft sound of the stream around him. Just as he was near sleep, John was startled awake by a terrible screech. He sat up, heart racing and picking up his helmet, pushed it on his head. He made his way down the rocks again, listening to the horrid noises just on the edge of the trees where the clearing ended. The brush shook and John moved towards it, sword clutched in his grasp. He stepped closer, a body’s length away when this invisible creature drew the most horrific noise of pain and John launched forward.
“I’m fine. I would of slept a bit more but I got a call, I need to go into the surgery early today. You wouldn’t mind dropping Rosie off, would you?”
“It’s alright Mrs. Holmes. We don’t mind. Do we Sherlock?” He glared at the taller man who still avoided his gaze.
“Have you killed an animal before?” Sherlocks fists tightened until his knuckles were white, fingernails digging into his hand. He never killed anything before but he was willing to try it on this doctor.
“Well…” Ever so slowly, Mike slowly stood and took a step back. “Look, Mike, I’d really appreciate if you didn’t tell anyone about this, it’s for his protection.”
When John was dressed he gathered his coat and took a look at Sherlock’s clothes. Granted, he always dressed to the nines but he looked far more…posh than usual. John had suspicions, especially as they left the flat and were greeted by a black car, only to find no Mycroft inside. They were off and Sherlock was lost in his phone as usual and John watched as they headed in a complete different direction than usual.
“Oh!” Sherlock’s mother exclaimed, “You must be Sherlock’s guest!” John smiled warmly and reached out his hand in greeting, “Yes, hello. I’m John, Sherlock’s-“
Yates kept his composure but his eyes betrayed him, he was afraid and Sherlock delighted in it. The doctor set his notebook aside and knelt before Sherlock, carefully placing his hands on the boys shaking shoulders and it felt like his skin was being seared through his clothes. Sherlock reached up to yank the doctors hands off, his own wrapping around Yates’ wrists. The second they made contact, the doctor froze, his eyes going wide. Sherlock could feel everything…all of the energy around him was overwhelming his senses. He closed his eyes, hands still on the doctors wrists and breathed in, time seeming to still. His body felt like it was on fire again but instead of pain, it felt good and he wanted more of it. His hands tightened on the doctors wrist, bruising and forceful until he felt something underneath. The source of the good feeling was
“Right…” John mumbled and went to pour two cups of tea. He sat in his chair, soon followed by Sherlock in his own. John picked up the mail and sifted through, frowning as he saw a familiar envelope and scrawl on top. “There’s another…”
“My head is tearing itself apart, I need a distraction! I-I can’t focus, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. John…John you don’t have to tell Mycroft, just…go back downstairs and let me…I just need one…”
everyone is looking at me. They’re aware of what I am about to do and they find it disgraceful. Ah, well. I never claimed to be an upstanding citizen.
“Sherlock!” John let out a weak cry, the water nearly past his chin. “Sherlock!” He coughed as water filled his mouth, having to strain and tilt his head up as much as possible.
The voices broke into the clearing and John quickly slid into the water to pretend that he was busy. Three boys around John’s age came into view, laughing and shoving each other around. They stopped when they saw John, “Hey! Watson!”
The moon poked through the tops of the trees as he trudged along, branches catching on his now bare skin and leaving scrapes and droplets of blood. He was tired, cold and hungry, wanting to give up and just wait to be found by someone. Just as he was about to find somewhere to sit and wait, he saw something shine through the trees before him. Curiosity drove the boy through the tangle of branches in front of him, his arms cut up even more from the branches and making him cringe at the pain.
When it was burning, John stood and looked down at Sherlock who had been watching him as if he were a fascinating new insect. “No, I haven’t.” Sherlock replied to john’s unspoken question.
That was the first of many cases that I had a similar reaction. It came to the point where I turned down any case that involved a large body of water.
,’ John? It is impossible for everything to simultaneously be okay. What would constitute ‘okay’ to you, John? Perhaps your okay, is not my okay. Regardless, what do you hope to learn from such a pedestrian question? If I lie, if I tell you the truth, what good would that do,
“Are you okay? Did they hurt you?” John’s voice was gentle and he looked at Sherlock with those beautiful blue eyes of his.
“I hope you two don’t mind sharing a room.” Sherlock’s mother put the finishing touches on the guest bed. “Your father picked an awful time to renovate the other bedrooms.”
“Sherlock.” Mycroft frowned, stepping forward and grasping his chin roughly. Sherlock groaned at the disturbance, “Did you make a list?”
The door opened and John turned around to see his Mum looking around at the mess, “John Hamish Watson! What in God’s name!”
“Not what it looks like? Save it. I’m not a goddamn child. Give it to me.” His hand is held out and I stare at it, desperate to keep what I found.
“Of course I’m bloody awake. You woke me up!” John grumbled and sat up a bit. “It’s five in the morning you bastard!” John looked over at Sherlock, ready to throttle him but the look on Sherlock’s face made him frown. “What? What is it?”
“Sorry…I should…sorry…” Sherlock mumbled and turned back towards the plane, his heart hammering in his chest, berating himself with each step. He came to an abrupt halt as a strong hand clasped his wrist.
Yates tried for over an hour to get Sherlock to talk but he never wavered in his glare or his silence, he was willing to wait this out even if it took days. The grandfather clock in the far corner of the room struck six and as the final chime rang out, Yates sighed and gathered his things, leaving the room without a word.
From a young age, Sherlock found that beauty was subjective. It was, “In the eye of the beholder,” as they say. It began as far back as he could remember that what he found fascinating and beautiful, others found grotesque and unnerving.
“John, even I have limits to-“ He paused as his phone rang and he took it out, answering in hushed whispers. John looked over at Sherlock who had his eyes closed and his hands steepled in front of him. Mycroft turned, “Well, it seems you are in luck. You are needed. Sherlock.” He hadn’t opened his eyes and Mycroft frowned, John jostling his shoulder.
“I wanted to tell you that I'm not going to the…beach with you.” He said the word like it was repulsive.
He sighed, “I find school to be dull and a waste of time which is why I take it upon myself to learn. Chemistry, Physics, Forensics, Probability. Things that are actually useful unlike making paper mache animals from the rainforest.”
The dragon tried to stand and collapsed back on to the ground. John took him back into his arms and collected his helmet. “At least stay until you’re better and then you can leave, okay? Whatever did this to you is still out there.” The dragon nearly huffed and conceded, curling up in John’s arms and closing his eyes again. John made his way back through the forest, the night already closing in. He knew his mother would not be happy with him.
Prompt: John gets mysterious love letters in the mail every day and he doesn't know they're from Sherlock.
John rose through the forest, coming into a clearing with a steady stream making many pathways through the green. He clambered up the small incline, jumping from rock to rock. “There’s no where to turn, Orthon! It’s just you and me!” He made it to the highest boulder and brought his sword in front of him, preparing to fight. He swung and cried, rolling on to the ground, jumping down the rocks as Orthon followed and tried to attack. John yelped as he slipped and fell into the water but quickly recovered and jabbed his sword up as Orthron tried to pounce on top of him.
“Hmm.” John sighed, distant sirens approaching them as John brushed back Sherlock’s hair. When the ambulance did arrive, Sherlock protested but John forced him inside. Mary was nowhere to be seen, the car already gone. John had a sinking feeling that she knew…but that wasn’t his concern right now. Sherlock was in critical condition and his life was all that mattered.
“I don’t think you’re stupid Sherlock but some things are best left to the adults.” Sherlock didn’t reply to that, hoping that his anger was plainly obvious. “Let’s switch gears. I want to talk about your schooling. Your parents informed me that you were expelled from your previous school last year. Can you tell me about that?” Sherlock knew that Yates wouldn’t leave him alone until he told the truth but Sherlock hated to repeat it when the doctor already knew about it.
Sherlock brought the bird up to his lonely room on the third floor, placing it on the floor in front of his bed. He grabbed paper, pencils, a multitool, magnifying glass and flashlight. He knelt down and spread out the papers, making sure they lined up before placing the bird on its back and spreading out the one wing that was still intact and the one that was mostly gone. He felt the bones crack as he positioned it to his liking. Taking a pencil, he traced around the body and moved it aside to draw it in more detail. He labeled the organs, the types of feathers, what might have killed it, or ate it after. He taped the two pieces of paper together and smiled at his work, taping it to the wall behind his desk.
“Put, sorry you suck at everything.” He laughed to himself, thinking that by the man’s sigh, he knew it was a joke.
“Another trivial holiday made up for the profit of corporations,” he waved it away, “of course I deleted it.”
“Yeah, I’ve had to stay and help my Mum…my father…anyway.” An awkward silence sat between them for a moment before Mike perked up again.
“Of course, love. You’ll pick her up after?” John nodded and ate his breakfast beforehand getting ready for work.
Sherlock raised his head only slightly, his eyes peeking from up under his curled up form. John’s eyes widened slightly and he glared, “Are you high?!” Sherlock hid his face again, that was all the answer John needed. “Where’s it then? Hmm? Find a new hiding spot have you?” John began to rip apart the room.
“Mmm. Good. That’s good.” Sherlock began to drift off to sleep. John watched him for a moment, unable to help the sorrow that ached in his chest. “Yeah, it is good, isn’t it?”
“This is wonderful, thank you.” He smiled and they continued walking on in silence for a few minutes.
“What if it does change our friendship…b-because I…Fuck it all-John, I love you!” He said it a little too loudly and cringed a bit at his exclamation. He expected John to scream or tell him to piss off or something. But John just stood there. “John…say something…please.”
The night was a restless experience for Sherlock. He could feel the seasons changing, the colder months soon looming over them. His instinct drove him to build a shelter and he dug himself a hole, selecting specific rocks that appealed to him and placing them inside. He dug himself a hole big enough that he could curl up and be able to have a small window to the cottage amongst the surrounding trees. John didn’t find his hideaway until a month after he had begun and stared at it in surprise.
“John. Stop staring and come here.” Sherlock rolled his eyes and took a seat. John hesitantly came over and bowed before the Queen.
“C-Cold…” His teeth chattered and his face was ghostly pale. Sherlock looked around, trying to figure a way to get John out before he went into hypothermic shock, when a light flashed down on them.
He continued forward, knees bruised and cut from crawling but the light was so appealing and warm…it almost seemed familiar. He came closer and closer, assuming it was an opening to the other side of wherever this tunnel led. He frowned as he grew closer, coming to find a ball of light, it looked like an isolated fire that seemed to float in midair. He was fascinated and terrified, never having seen anything like this in his life, there had to be some kind of scientific explanation. He sat on his legs and reached out slowly, oddly he didn’t feel any heat radiating off of the fire so he moved closer until his hand was a hairbreadth away from touching it and still, nothing. He took in a deep breath and held it as he reached out and put his hand through the flame.
“Sherlock,” John groaned, “You have all of the bloody blankets, I’m cold.” Sherlock grunted half asleep and John sighed, curling up on himself, too tired to get up and find more, he shivered in the cool night air. He was suddenly surrounded by warmth as Sherlock turned over, covering John in the heap of blankets and wrapping his long limbs around John who smiled tiredly and fell back asleep at his husbands side.
John looked up and put on a fake smile, “Hey.” He picked up the bucket he had brought to catch their dinner in, pretending to be too busy to talk. “Sorry, can’t talk. Mum’s waiting on me.” John hurried off where Sherlock had run to, hearing the boys snicker about how weird he was. Not that John cared, he just wanted Sherlock to be safe. He looked around frantically, whispering his name. “Sherlock? Where are you?” He heard a rustle of leaves in the tree behind him and he turned to look up, only to find his dragon hidden at the top. John’s jaw fell open as he looked upon the green scales that covered the dragon, reflecting the tree tops around him. Sherlock climbed down, landing with a thud behind John and sniffing him all over to ensure he was not harmed before nuzzling under his neck. John sighed and stroked him lovingly.
It was an abysmal day. Rain poured endlessly which made the surgery rather slow, not that John was complaining but he would of liked to spend the day with Sherlock. His phone buzzed and he looked down.
I wait in silence as John settles into the couch with the telly on. Once I hear his light snores I get up and look through where my old stashes were in my bedroom. Each one coming up empty. I carefully avoid the floor wood panels that creak and check the places I had in the loo, only to find those empty as well. I can’t check the living room or the kitchen as it’d wake John but there is a place I’m doubtful he’d have thought of. His own room. Taking my time up the stairs and listening to John’s steady snores, I make my way into his room. It’s still in military precision cleanliness which only makes my job easier. Under the wooden leg of his bed is a loose panel that can be lifted just so that is just enough space to fit in a small bag, enough for a hit but it’d be better than nothing. As quiet as I can I kneel down and slide under the bed, pulling the wood back carefully so it wouldn’t snap and therein lies the solitary bag. My heart begins to beat in anticipation and I grin before sliding the wood back into its place and moving out from under the bed. That’s when I freeze. John his standing there and he’s angry. More than angry. He looks betrayed and…sad? Odd. “John…I was just…”
(Despite the general feeling towards S4, I’m going to take one aspect from it that could be logical [if provided with a different background story anyway])
Throwing myself back on the couch, I kick off my shoes and pretend to be thinking. He won’t notice, this is something I’ve been found doing before. The footsteps grow closer, the door creaks open as a call of,“Sherlock?” Is pushed into the room.
“What?” John turned towards him, the anger evident on his face. “What did you say?” Sherlock didn’t reply, John went up to him. “Don’t ignore me Sherlock.” John lifted Sherlock’s head up. “Christ, Sherlock. How much did you take? Hm?”
“May I be excused?” He played the perfect picture of innocence but his father only spared one glance at him.
His mother was reading a book, her face engrossed and covered from his vantage point. “Mummy, look what I found!” He held up the dead bird with one hand that was wrapped around a remaining foot.
“Did you say, thank you?” She nodded again and Sherlock placed breakfast and tea before John. He looked at it, surprised anytime Sherlock did anything domestic but smiled. Sherlock leaned down and kissed John softly, “How are you feeling?” Sherlock sat back down in his chair but kept his focus on John.
. “Did I wake you,” he mumbled after some time, turning to look at Sherlock who sat there, concern etched in his features. Sherlock crawled over to John’s side and pulled him into his arms, placing kisses all over his face and neck until John had finally relaxed and felt sleep approaching once again, “Go back to sleep John, I will be here when you wake, I love you.”
“Sherlock we’re having a doctor take a look at you.” His eyes refocused as he zeroed in on his father, a scowl ready to come out. “I expect you to behave. He will be arriving at 5pm tomorrow.” His father raised a challenging eyebrow, waiting for Sherlock’s retort but it never came. He nodded sharply and pressed his lips so tight together that it hurt and ran to his room the second he was dismissed.
The man as I would soon come to find out as Mycroft Holmes, inspected my hand and I pulled away after a moment. “Fire her. She's got it the wrong way around. You're under stress right now, and your hand is perfectly steady. You're not haunted by the war, Dr Watson... You miss it.”
John flinched as there was a crash behind him and Sherlock snaked up John’s body and to his shoulders where he hid his face in John’s neck. He knew without turning that the lamp was broken and his Mum was furious.
“Mm.” Sherlock looked John up and down, a hunger in his eyes. “You should wear your uniform more often.”
I paused at the edge of the water, something about it made my heart race. Odd. I tried to make myself step closer but my body began to quiver. Horrified by the betrayal of my body, I took a step back, getting as close to the body as I dared. It made for a difficult inspection but not impossible.
“We’ve done this before, and we’ll do it again. Let me help you, Sherlock.” His fingers gently pry mine open and I can’t help but let him as he slowly takes the bag away and slips it into his pocket. His hand return to my own and our fingers are intertwined in a twist of digits. This is blindingly new and my brain can’t seem to process what’s happening but for the first time in nearly a week, I feel calm.
John grumbled as he pulled weeds in the garden behind their cottage. “This is your fault. You should be doing chores.” Sherlock pranced around the yard, thoroughly enjoying his time outside for the first time in a week. He rolled on to his back and rubbed into the dirt, letting out content little yips. “At least one of us is having fun.” John continued on with his task as Sherlock explored within eye sight. He felt bad having kept the dragon in for so long but now that he was healed, John figured he deserved the sunlight. He wondered if Sherlock thought about his family or the day he was attacked, if he even remembered what happened. Well, he would do everything in his power to protect him.
The dragon growled at him, wanting the food desperately, its stomach aching for food. He tried to refuse but his instincts got the better of him. He started down the curtain again, it ripped loudly as he sank to the floor, tearing a huge hole in the fabric. He sniffed at the air, taking careful strides over to the boy. John stood stalk still as the dragon moved in closer, a hairbreadth away from the plate. The dragon watched him carefully, moving in as close as he dared before sinking its teeth into the fish and darting away, back into the nest on John’s bed. John sighed and got up, placing the plate on the table before going to sit on his bed. He was stopped by a vicious snarl from the dragon. “It’s my bed!” He protested and tried to sit again, the dragon snapping at him with his teeth. “You don’t own it!” John huffed and moved to sit on the floor instead. The dragon sat in its nest, chewing at the fish, watching John and making sure he stayed away.
“Sherlock, please just try to behave. If this school doesn’t work out, then Mummy will have to homeschool you and I know how much you would hate that.”
They were at the furthest trap when a screech was heard from the distance. Sherlock froze instantly and looked towards the sky, his nostrils flaring and his haunches rising. “What is it?” John frowned, looking around warily. He pulled out his dagger from his belt and unconsciously moved closer to Sherlocks side. A few more terrible roars echoed around them and Sherlock enclosed John in a wing, sinking as far down into the ground as he could, scales blending into the greenery around them. He was eerily still and John waited with bated breath. The sounds grew closer, Sherlock tensed and a shadow grew across the sky as a dragon, larger than Sherlock beat across the tops of the trees. It was various reds and streaks of black, horns and jagged scales. Nothing like Sherlock. The white dragon watched it, calculating, as it continued on off into the distance.
“Please get the cake, love. Be there in an hour.” He kissed Sherlock’s temple and Sherlock waved him off.
At 7pm his door was knocked on by Mycroft, “Time for dinner, Sherlock.” He didn’t wait for a reply before heading down to the dining room. Sherlock sighed and got up, brushing any excess feathers off of him before grabbing the bird and placing it on his desk until his return.
“I must be mad,” John muttered to himself, shaking his head, “Sherlock. Listen to me. I told you I stopped dating women.”
“Has he…” She just smiled, which made John’s stomach flutter and then tea was served. Sherlock and Mycroft were relaxed-themselves. John on the other hand had a hard time keeping his hands still. The three of them fell into conversation as John just sat there, having a hard time processing everything. Mycroft excused himself at one point to answer a call so The Queen (No…Sherlock’s grandmother?) turned towards Sherlock and John.
“Come along then.” Mycroft headed into the doors had come out of and John stopped dead in his tracks. Her Majesty The Queen sat there, looking expectantly at the doors, smiling as she saw Sherlock. To John’s complete horror, Sherlock went over to her and hugged her, even kissing her cheek. John couldn’t move, he felt paralysed.
He finally pushed through and came upon a clearing in the woods. There was a small lake with the moon reflecting on its surface, wild flowers bloomed all around, seemingly untouched by the rain. It didn’t make any sense, the ground was dry, the air warm and pleasant, crickets eased the silence and he felt suddenly calm, unworried about his predicament. He made his way over to the lake, sitting on the perfect rock that served as a bench to look out into the water. He peeled off his wet shoes and socks, laying them on the rock and hoping they would dry as he waited for rescue. Sherlock rolled up his trousers and stepped into the water of the lake. It was shockingly warm and clear, it almost felt like a bath and he eagerly stripped down to his pants before wadding in all the way. It felt amazing after being pelted by the cold rain and mud and it was so beautiful, he could see the moon and stars reflected in the water.
“We all have scars, love. Some you can see, some you can’t. But I think you are the most beautiful person I have ever known so don’t worry about what they think. Since when do you care what other people thought?”
“Sherlock, you’re leaving! To God knows where and if you ever come back and-Christ, Sherlock!” He glanced back at Mary who was waiting by the car, too far off to hear them. “I’m married now!”
The dragon closed his eyes, John’s heart racing, “Oh…I’m sorry. I didn’t…I’m sorry.” He frowned and finished tying up the wounds. “Do you have anywhere to go?” The dragon didn’t move, John’s heart sank as he realised the dragon had just lost everything. “Well, you can come home with me!” The dragon opened its eyes and gave John a look as if he was insane. “I’ll take care of you!”
“Hush. We’re going to be late, put on your damn coat.” He laughed, turning for the stairs. Sherlock suddenly grabbed John from behind and pulled him close, kissing his neck.
“I’ve been awake for hours already as you slept the day away.” John rolled his eyes and ignored Sherlock’s comments. He made Sherlock a cup without asking, placing it on the desk beside him and settling into his chair.
Just a reminder, this is an AU and will not be accurate to real life. Though it is in 3rd person, it is currently from Sherlock's perspective.
“Look at them.” John sighed in annoyance but did as he was told. He began to go through them, one by one, his frown increasing as his heart started to race. Each photo captured a moment where Sherlock was looking at John, really looking at him. Something he could only describe as longing…His mind went blank for a moment as he tried to gather his thoughts, his mouth suddenly felt dry.
At the age of twelve, Sherlock had brought in a half decomposed bird to show his mother. He had studied the deterioration of flesh, the organs that were still intact and shriveled. He stroked what was left of the feathers, cataloguing everything he saw before him. The way each part of the body was intentional, how it all worked together to form such a creature was enthralling. He had, of course, watched birds often as he explored his parents garden. Wondering what it would be like to fly and see everything that was beautiful in the world.
Sherlock came over to him and wrapped him in his arms. “Of course I want you to come, John. We’ll tell them together.” He ran his fingers over the ring on John’s hand.
“Hush, boy. I will not sit here any longer and see you sacrifice companionship for crime. Doctor Watson, would you find tomorrow at 7pm, a suitable time to have dinner with my grandson?”
John burst through the door without thinking of what he was going to say. Sherlock looked startled, having hit the wrong note during John’s outburst.
The room was quiet as they both lay down. With barely a whisper John heard Sherlock say, “Do you still love me…?”
“John…whenever you ask me about my childhood, I tell you that I don’t remember much. I know you don’t believe it but that is the truth. In the past few years, I’ve come to the realisation that I have Aqua-phobia.”
Sherlock held his breath, his eyes widening at his sudden outburst. He hadn’t meant to say it, knowing their parting would at least be a fraction easier if he didn’t say it…He watched as John paused, turning back to face him. He had that soldiers look that he would get when he was uncomfortable, his back straightening and his arms stiff at his sides. Sherlock’s gaze darted to the ground and back to John as the silence seemed to speak volumes between them.
When John was twelve, Sherlock had been with them for two years and had grown well up to John’s shoulders. John had grown as well, making Sherlock’s growth rate alarming for such a small cottage. He looked forward every day to being let outside so he could stretch his wings and have enough space to roam. The bigger he grew, the more irritable he was, being so cramped for the majority of the day. John apologised constantly but it just wasn’t safe for Sherlock to be out by himself. Especially since he didn’t know how to fly yet. John tried encouraging him, simulating flying as he jumped down from boulders with his arms out but the dragon steadfastly refused. He would leap down beside John and wait to be guided again. “No, Sherlock. You’re supposed to flap your wings, like this.” He moved his arms rapidly up and down, the dragon turned and climbed up the boulder before disappearing to the other side. “Sherlock?” John climbed up only to see the dragon immersing himself in the stream on the other side, his jaws working loudly as he chewed on a fish he had caught. John laughed and sat, watching him happily eat his catch.
. I can barely suppress to roll my eyes and let out a sigh, rolling so my back is to him and my face is curled up to the backrest of the couch. I want to be alone. I want John to leave so I can leave. Now that it’s in my thoughts I can’t let it go. My hands go to my hair and I grip it, pulling until I feel pain. Ah, good. A distraction. I can hear John rustling as he puts his shoes by the door and hangs his jacket, wandering into the kitchen and putting the kettle on.
Prompt: fake/pretend relationship with one of them kissing the other unexpectedly and being totally casual about it while the other is freaking out internally.
“I’ll be right behind you.” I got up and pushed him out of my flat, grinning and wrapping my scarf around my neck. I had been itching for a case, finally something interesting!
Things were complicated with him and Sherlock. They had been together for a few years now and were a couple for all intents and purposes but they hadn’t discussed taking it further. Sherlock was essentially, Rosie’s other guardian.
“Don’t underestimate an addict, John.” He pulled out his phone and stepped outside, John knelt by Sherlock, grasping his hand tightly.
This had happened before, a few times. Doctors had come, examining and testing him because he wasn’t normal. It started when he was five and so did the diagnoses. He had heard it all at this point and having yet another come in to claim some false diagnosis set him on edge.
“Fine. You stay here and sulk. I’m going either way.” That surprised me. Usually he would begrudgingly stay and do what I wanted…I stood quickly to address him.
“Sherlock, take a few breaths for me.” That only served to make him angrier. His gaze flickered to the clock, only twenty minutes had passed. There was no way he was going to make it through this. He wished he was older, taller, stronger and could make the doctor shut up and leave him alone. He wished he could leave his parents house and never come back. He wished everyone would just
“He’s a white dragon, Mike. You know how rare they are. If hunters find out that he’s here…they’ll kill him. I won’t let that happen.” John protectively wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck.
God, I could really use a cigarette. I checked in my usual hiding places but came up empty each time. In my frustration I didn’t notice John was watching me until I had finished my search.
“My bother may be naïve when it comes to displays of affection but it is plainly obvious. Which is why I must ask you once again, John Watson. What are your intentions with my brother?”
John sat in silence, just staring at the photos. He had been living in denial for ages it seemed but there was always a part of him that wondered if Sherlock harboured the same feelings. Here in his hands, lay living proof. “John.”
“As I said, you wouldn’t understand.” Sherlock yanked the string, pulling up more in the process, knowing his mother would be livid but he couldn’t seem to care. The furniture was more important than he was. His brother went back to ignoring him and Sherlock just wanted to scream at him about how stupid and fat he was. Ever since he became a teenager, he had become insufferable and stopped playing with Sherlock. He claimed he had to “grow up” and be “responsible.” He cared so much about their fathers opinion and it set Sherlocks teeth on edge. He couldn’t wait for the summer holiday to be over and not have to see Mycroft’s stupid, fat face until Christmas. The clock struck five and Mycroft spoke once more. “Don’t you have to be somewhere?”
So, when I was immersed in Sherlock’s war within London, it felt very much the same. Within the first few days of our involvement, I had killed a man. A bloody awful man but a man still the same. I wold rationalise it as defence, Sherlock had been in danger. While I may not be able to always be there to stop him from risking his life, I silently vowed to try. I was back in the war, and I had never felt more at home.
They were silent for a few moments as John ate, Sherlock drinking his coffee. “I must apologise...I didn’t realise that this holiday meant so much to you.”
“John,” Sherlock nearly rolled his eyes, “you ask me the same questions every day. It doesn’t take a genius to know what you’re about to say.”
Sherlock focused on it, could see the outline of the doctor in his mind, similar to the blue flame. He imagined reaching out like he did with the fire, grasping hold of it and pulling. It wasn’t easy and in the back of his mind he registered screaming but as the energy from the doctor flowed through him, he felt like he never had before. The doctor in his mind, separated from the energy, floated lifeless into a black pool before he was consumed by it, the energy he had taken, blooming thought Sherlock’s limbs. He felt like he could breathe again, the anger gone and replaced by euphoria.
He had been tracking what he thought was the last hours of the boy. A chinese restaurant first, in which he assumed he had had dinner. Having a natural heavenly gift to speak fluently in any language of the earth was always convenient. They weren’t affected by mortal limitations, so their communication skills were absolutely perfect. They were, however, naturally limited in vocabulary. It took skill and knowledge to be able to extract some useful information from humans in regard to more heavenly matters. Mostly because, as they neither understood nor saw or contacted the supernatural, they had incorrect, they had inaccurate words for concepts very familiar and basic to angels.
“Where…Where did it come from?” John whispered, slowly coming to a stand. Sherlock stared at the point where it disappeared from view, wary of his own kind. He growled to himself before pushing John with his muzzle to continue back to the cottage. Sherlock was on high alert as they walked back. John could feel the tension beside him, anxiety pooling in his gut. If Sherlock was afraid, John could only imagine what was in store.
John sighed as he entered the kitchen. As usual, Sherlock’s experiments were everywhere he looked. “Can’t bother to put your bloody instruments away?” He heard Sherlock sigh from his chair.
“Hmm.” Sherlock barely seemed interested, finding it rather ‘dull’ as he had stated on numerous occasions.
John had left Sherlock at home as he went into town and gathered food from the market while his mother worked. He took care of everything around the house as she tried to make enough money to keep them afloat. It had been increasingly difficult after his father died, the war alone had made living a hardship for everyone in the village. But they made do. John carried a sack and a basket, lugging his haul back towards the cottage when he heard his name called, “John! John, wait up!” A dirty brown haired boy ran up to him with a grin plastered on his face.
John watched him for a moment before realisation dawned on him. The scars. He moved closer and kissed all over Sherlock’s face despite his protests.
“This is regarding some…sensitive information.” Mycroft sat across from John, looking at him with a frown. “If you recall, I once asked you, what your intentions were with my brother…Seeing as the two of you have shared the same flat for a few years now, I am afraid I must inquire again.” He was looking at John in that disapproving way but he knew that Mycroft did care for Sherlock, no matter his odd way of expressing it.
“We bloody well are!” John opened the door and climbed out, the urge to see Sherlock was increasing per second. “Look, I don’t have an answer for you. But if this other envelope you have is any indication…you don’t have to worry.” Before Mycroft could reply, John was sprinting back to 221B.
. My mind made up before my arrival, I would not want to wait a second more. But I pay. We part ways and the walk home feels thrice as long as before. I would feel their eyes on me. I know,
Sherlock rinsed off and turned off the water, gasping as he saw John standing there with a smirk on his face. “What are you doing!” He grabbed his towel and wrapped it around his waist.
“Mmm but you know nothing about sociopolitical issues now, do you?” He still hadn’t looked up. Sherlock frowned and picked at a loose string on the chairs upholstery.
“Good.” Sherlock couldn’t hide the genuine happiness he felt and he got up. “Come on then. I believe our matchmaker wishes to have lunch.”
John watched as Sherlock came over and inspected him, making sure he wasn’t hurt and suddenly he began to laugh to the point of tears. Sherlock watched him in horror, “Sorry!” He brushed the tears away, “I’m so sorry! It’s just…Jesus, Sherlock…” John tried to compose himself but he couldn’t stop the grin from forming on his lips. “I came back because…because I need to tell you something.”
“They also said that you found it…beautiful?” Yates frowned as he was met with silence yet again. “I will not be leaving until you communicate with me.” Sherlock clenched his jaw tighter, refusing to give in.
I had only know Sherlock for the span of 24 hours and had been thrust into yet another war. A war amongst the criminal class of London. I had told myself to lay low after my return from Afghanistan…clearly, I can’t take my own advice.
He moved slowly, trying to move the dragon without waking him but it stirred nonetheless, its eyes opening slowly and looking down at John. It moved so quickly John could barely process it. The dragon was just as startled being so close to John and tried to take off across the room. Forgetting its wounds, the dragon cried out as it fell to the ground, off of John’s bed. “Wait! Stop!” John scrambled out of bed, nearly falling in a twist of sheets as he tried to calm the dragon down. The creature cried out and scattered across the floor, knocking over a chair as it slithered between the legs and up on to a table. John’s pursuit drove the dragon on as it knocked off a mug which clattered to the ground and shattered, startling the dragon even more. “Stop moving! It’s okay!” John tried to catch the dragon, earning an attempt at biting his hand and a hiss as the dragon jumped up on to a curtain and climbed to the very top. He curled up around the pole, looking down at John with rows of sharp teeth bared. A low rumbled escaped the dragon, warning John to stay away.
“I know but I’m really behind…we’ll catch up later-“ There was a loud screech and John’s blood ran cold.
“I’m not an idiot, John. I know that food doesn’t ‘magically appear.’ ’’ Sherlock rolled his eyes and grabbed his violin. John sighed and left the flat, his annoyance only increasing as he saw a black car slowly creeping up beside him nearly a block away. He stopped and got in without hesitation.
“Is that John Watson?” A group of five men approached, all greeting John happily. One of them looked over at Sherlock and smirked, “And who is this?”
The dreams were often the same. Watching my friends blown to pieces, hearing the echoes of gunfire and bombs dropping near by. I remember the nights there. Stifling hot and the sounds of war not far behind. I slept when I could, always with a chorus of war and destruction. After months of this constant battle for sleep, I began to tune out the noise as sleep overcame me. It became a regular part of my life, expecting to die at any moment, knowing that not far from where I slept, people were dying…
John laughed and took his hand, guiding him to the water, Sherlock having completely forgotten about his earlier apprehensions.
It was completely dark, the moon lending nothing for his sight into the tree, it was just big enough for him to crawl into. He reached out a hand and put it into the hole, not feeling anything on the other side and though he hesitated, he decided to go in anyway. Taking a deep breath, Sherlock slowly crawled inside the tree. He looked back to see the lake shining behind him and the field of flowers beyond that, his shoes and clothing still laying on the rock where he left them. He turned back into the darkness and made his way further in, impossibly it seemed to go on forever, the light behind him turning smaller and smaller. He shivered as the cold seemed to increase and seep into his bones but just as he was about to turn back, a light shined faintly in front of him.
He squirmed, trying to avoid the inevitable movement, but Moran pulled from his leash and passed a leg under his feet, making him fall on his knees and banging against the hard ground. His wolf growled and jumped towards Moran in order to bite him, however Ethan’s electric rod fell on top of the animal. A spark of static was heard and his wolf shimmered, falling on the floor, moaning. He felt the discharge in his own body, traveling him entirely. He tried to launch himself towards Ethan again and again, but he couldn’t reach him.
“You, Morning Star, are a traitor. You should be a prisoner at the eighth circle. I don’t care how you managed to escape confinement. Luckily for you, I didn’t come for your sorry arse.”
It had been clear. Extremely so. Rosie had never done that before. Was she calling for him? For Sherlock? He wanted to cry. She had just managed to say her first meaningful word and neither he nor Sherlock were there to answer it.
He was in a room, dark stone walls covered in all kinds of weapons. Red dots of light decorated the cave, full of cushions and other elements. Almost closing his eyes, Sherlock growled low, making a face of discomfort. The Second Circle it was, then.
“I luv u,” John slurred, his hands losing the strong hold they had on his knee and the collar of his shirt. “S’lock, ‘m cold.”
Particularly strong with testosterone, dopamine, and oxytocin, it was driving Sherlock crazy. In the past, every time John went on dates he reeked, his blood delightfully singing to him, raising his hunger and his desire, but also his possessive instincts because this was not displayed for Sherlock, but instead for some boring woman. The day of John’s wedding, his smell was stronger than ever. Sherlock had to leave the reception early because it was making him lose control and it was not his place to do anything about it.
Saying that he didn’t scream at some point in the night would give too much credit. Jim had made sure that every single moment of the process would result in fucking hell. Preparation? For what? What he intended was to mark him, not to pleasure him. The phrase that was repeated the most times during the endless hours, was one that would haunt John in his deepest nightmares.
The dystopians, who wanted to maintain a slightly marginal life, paying their fines, had a special identity card and a mark on the ear as if they were cattle. A small electronic earring facilitated the control of your pace. If you wanted to get rid of it, you had to cut off part of the ear cartilage and risk being caught by the authorities.
A quick peek back to the opening of the alley allowed him to see a black car blocking the way including any view people could have had of them from the street. The door was open and Anthea was outside, waiting with her phone in her hands.
It was a great idea John was only wearing a ridiculously colourful apron the yarders had given them as a present last christmas, Sherlock though. It was great because that had given him the precious chance of having a handful of Hotson’s arse that lovely morning. And that was always something worth celebrating.
After waiting nearly five minutes, completely naked and tied with the leash to the ground, he finally arrived. He was unfastening his tie, and when he saw him standing there he stopped, watching him. John came to attention, staying still, as much as his nerves and his own body allowed him, and albeit that, he could feel the accelerated heartbeats, pumping adrenaline through his system, and his accelerated respiration. Eyes fixed on the face of Moriarty, as he watched him.
Sherlock moved to get up, John’s legs still hanging from his arms, and took the forgotten boxers in hand. John made a gesture as if to take them, but Sherlock raised his arm to hold them out of his reach. Defeated, John rested back against the pillows as Sherlock put his legs on his shoulders and bent forward till his face was level with John’s entrance. The tight ring of muscle was dilated and pink, slightly swollen from the abuse. It was shiny with lubricant and come and Sherlock felt something primal roll through his guts at the sight.
He followed the trail, unsure of what he would find, but ready to face it. His hands itched, as if getting ready to summon his shields. He hadn’t had a fight with a demon for a very long time. Things could get very interesting in a short time. The scar at his shoulder burned in remembrance, as if expressing it’s discomfort.
The look John gave him, something between confusion and hurt, almost made him frown. He felt as if he was missing something. Was he?
He remembered his stupid face when he saw the silhouette of the crow flying in circles over them, standing out in the ground when he found himself with Lestrade after the gathering, while they were talking. Because he looked up as if he had gone mad and Greg looked at him as if he had lost his mind.
Sherlock remained sleeping on the couch for a while longer, while digestion was being done. Mycroft sat down to work at the table, filling reports with the regulatory bottle of alcohol before him. The glass was empty, untouched. That was weird. His brother's daily routine was to arrive at home, have a drink and then to continue to work. Sherlock saw his chance when he woke up and saw that Mycroft had finished reports, neatly stacked in front of him. He had his hands covering his face, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, his shirt half open, and the bottle in front of him was empty even when a couple of hours ago exhibited itself new and full.
The succubus bowed again, receding into the darkness. With a feeling of unease, Sherlock flew back to the doors, still thinking about what he was missing. Oh, how he hated not knowing.
“An angel has been walking around the Creation. I want to know where, and how long he has been doing it.”
He was one of the causes why a battalion was trying to blow up the barricade of the underground tunnels at Embankment station. Because that was the distraction. His real goal had been to recover the District line at the blockage of Putney Bridge station. He had been the captain that who was in charge of the assault to point E. And it was to be expected that he would be captured. He was playing with his life everyday.
He raised their joined hands to softly kiss the back of John’s, cold and almost rigor mortis hard. He could still feel the callouses on the skin from his years in the army, handling weapons and medical equipment. He was always been comforted by feeling John’s hands. They were so reliable and as steady as the man behind them. Was odd for a vampire, a highly resourceful predator, to feel comforted and safe because of a human. But as strange as it seemed, Sherlock found no other explanation for the peace of mind that descended upon him when John was around, when he held Sherlock at night, arms wrapped around his middle and chin on his nape.
He spent the first night in deep thought, trying to focus on his mission rather than on the infuriating demon he had met. Morning Star was not going to keep him from fulfilling his duty. Not again.
Mycroft rebound the collar to the strap and closed his hands between the electronic shackles. John looked at him, surprised by the new replacement.
Furious and spiteful, Sherlock mastered a face of disgust. He had had eons to practise how to control his emotions and expressions. He was a master of lies and deception, after all. Wasn’t he?
They were lucky, nonetheless. Last prophet they had in the London coven got so out of control he was talking nothing but nonsense by the time his hair began to grey, and ended up being called Godfrey The Nutter. Mycroft had a better grip on his magic, even if he seemed to still be limited by the prophecies counter magic. Sherlock did not mind the riddles, as long as his older brother kept a comprehensive communication the rest of the time.
But John had opposed him. John had not joined him and so, they ended up apart, as far away from each other as two beings could be.  If he had joined him, things would have gone different. It was one thing to lose an Angel. But an Archangel? That could have shook things up there. Maybe even changed them for good.
The lesser demon took a step closer and the flames at the top of the man’s head crackled fiercely, flames growing in size. The demon stopped and made himself small, crouching until his face was nearly touching the ashen ground. It’s hissing voice came out muffled.
Mycroft was now the leading druid of all Great Britain covens, which was not an easy task. He had been raised inside the London coven, and his master, seeing how his mundane career was progressing, got him ready to get ahead of his fellow apprentices. Eventually, Mycroft’s magic was too good to ignore, and his position inside the British government was important enough to grant him the majority of the votes in the chief elections during the Samhain council.
“So, all of that... the demolition of the wall... it was all from your chemist?” He asked curiously. “I’ve been told that he’s a brilliant lad.”
The first nights after John and Rosie moved in, she had the worst nightmares. He learned to identify them because she was totally agitated and moving restlessly in the cot, making pouts and finally crying inconsolably. He had been desperate to calm her, worried she might feel unsafe in the place that was to be her home from now on. He decided to grab a t-shirt from the washing pile that smelled just like John and threw it over his shoulder before taking the crying baby and held her against his chest, face over the cloth. In a few moments, her heartbeat slowed, her breathing became more regular and finally, with the calm and tiredness bought by tears, she fell asleep again, calm and comfortable. Fearing she might get up or have another nightmare, Sherlock ended up holding her in her room, rocking her softly while she slept, safe and sound. And so he stood, afraid to move too fast, until she woke up hungry and rested, just before her father did. Eventually, Rosie ended up not needing John’s smell to calm down, and Sherlock liked to think the baby had begun to link his own scent with safety and home. It was a pleasant thought that made him feel soft and warm inside. And when everything else failed, playing a soft violin lullaby managed to calm both father and daughter just the same.
If a cock could be beautiful, John’s would be the top choice. Proudly raised and pointing toward his belly, it was thick and sturdy. Not especially long, but perfectly adequate. The curve it made was elegant, and Sherlock was sure it would hit all of his sweet spots to the point of making him cry.
“I was bored. Thought this would provide some distraction”, Sherlock said, as if he couldn’t care less about the situation. He shrugged. “Though I must say, this might be enough to capture my attention. This murder, I have not been informed of. Not that I normally pay attention to anything down there but...”
“Can you blame me? You did something unforgivable, Helel. My feelings about any of this are not relevant.”
“He was on a diplomatic trip, coming back from Paris. A rough newborn decided it was a good idea to start a fight with two werewolves just to get to Mycroft. We suspect he was out of control. Had no sire, no clan, and the werewolves somehow entered what he deemed as his territory,” Sherlock explained.
It had all been bright, blinding light at the very beginning. Just voices and a feeling of peace, belonging and right. He was just a thought, an idea. Strong and fierce, as all convictions are at its origins. His mission, was to serve and protect the Creation. He had been immensely happy, filled with joy and being true to his core. He delivered Justice, hard but with kindness, firm but compassionate. Always the vigilant protector of God’s favourite creature.
Another jerk from the leash pulled him towards Moran, making him fall on his back. He still had his hair wet from the freezing water, and the leather of the collar, it was without a doubt leather, began to irritate his skin, and it could maybe even cut it.
He always used names with ‘J’ whenever he could. He liked how they sounded on his tongue. Made him remember other times.It was not the first occasion he had chosen ‘John’ for himself.
Countless had thought of emigrating, fleeing the country, but news soon came that other regimes had taken control of most European nations and had embraced the new politics of hate. Those who escaped to France from the coast of Dover never reached their destination, and the few ships that escaped from the East Coast to Ireland (which remained outside the control of the anti-dystopian and had big fights with the government of the pro cleaning north), or to the Americas, mysteriously sank on the way. Also, there were strict controls at airports and at train services.
The dark sweetness of his voice caressed John’s ears and enticed him to move. Sherlock saw the exact moment when the human in John let go of the powerful, marvellous beast lying dormant underneath. It took only half a second to have him on his knees, a needy, feral expression on his face. Sherlock tossed the man away, ignoring the yelp from the other side of the room as the body hit the wall forcefully.
“It’s good you are fine by yourself, my child. But loneliness can be such a great burden,” she said before they parted. He remembered that day as clearly as if it had happened yesterday. He sometimes wished he didn’t. His mother had sounded so sad and resigned.
“I’m sure this must be some kind of test. What are the odds of you appearing every damn time I get a bit closer to what’s going on?” he growled, taking a seat at the counter. The man sitting next to him didn’t even flinch. He seemed very focused on  the bartender .
With his eyes fixed on the flames, he looked sleepy and tired. Younger. His muscles were soft and relaxed. John pulled him closer and dropped a kiss on the top of his head, burying his nose into the curls.
Mashed boiled potatoes and an egg were all that Sherlock got dinner that night. At first, he looked at the hot plate with desire, albeit with some reluctance. He was accustomed to not eating for long periods of time, but not his brother, who had to walk among the abundant feasts on the 'clean' side, knew it was forbidden to him to eat. In addition, his job required for him to be in an ideal condition, and the regular feeding that he did not have was basically what was needed to achieve that goal.
He briefly felt as his body fell until it stayed resting next to Irene, and then how her arms went around him, assuring him, free from the seat belt. He could hear her voice in the distance as he felt his world sink. Everything suddenly spinning around him.
Sherlock had so many things in mind. He wanted to know exactly how long John had been feeling this way. Why hadn’t he spoken sooner? Why now? And was this going to be serious? Because if he only had one night with John, he would treasure it forever. But he needed to know. Just to be ready.
He followed Sherlock down,  his opinions about Pirate Sherlock  pushed away by curiosity. The walls were humid, made of old, grey stone shining with water in some places. It smelled like a river. He heard... running water? Could it be?
He noticed for the first time in his appearance, since he entered the room for the first time. The suited man had dark circles under the eyes, and licked his lips at a regular basis. John knew those symptoms. They were the reactions of a drinker. His body under under the suit was little for a man his age, almost bordering on anorexia. The locator chip on his right ear told him that he was currently living in the ‘Lion Den’, and in not very good conditions. He presented mild symptoms of malnutritions, maybe even in the early stages.
“I haven’t been spying on you, if it’s what you are thinking. I have only observed. You walk like someone in the army would walk, but you are too young to have been able to enlist yourself before this started, so surely you belong to the rebels. By the way you behave, you have discipline and authority, so that suggests a certain range. Not so low to be Lieutenant, but not high enough to be Higher, so it’s clear that you are a Captain. From the Northumberland group, from what I have understood. In the ‘Lion Den’ there were some comments the other day that they were ambushed in the tube and one of them was taken. I also know that you are a doctor by the look of your hands. They are firm, secure and prepared for hard jobs. Besides, I think I’ve seen you in one of those mobile stations under the Millennium bridge sometime,”
Sherlock lifted his eyes from the microscope to find John standing in front of him. It took his breath away.
In the depths of his heart, he knew his soul mate was somewhere injured but alive. And it would not let it be killed being that way. He would not cause such pain to anyone, even an unknown stranger. And as matters stood, to survive and to find your soulmate was the only available happiness that the government could not control completely.
Wars as he had only seen at the Dark Times trapped him. So much suffering he was sure he could fix. It was not his duty or his mission. But it was his core and he couldn’t fight himself.
After that, he attacked the food like a hungry wolf. When he finished eating his stomach hurt so much from the amount of eaten food that he even wanted to vomit, but he didn't allow himself to do that. Food was not thrown away. He felt guilty for eating the two nuts. They were two nuts less for Wiggins.
His voice was velvet soft, his hands softly caressed the body in his arms. With his left, wrist still covered in drying blood that had dripped from the open wound, he swept back a lock of blonde hair from the fringe that had fallen over John’s eyes.
. Second, of course I know you can take care of her. Don’t be daft. But you can hardly attend to her if you are coming with me, don’t you think?”
And all that he could think when he felt Jim’s hands over his body, was that the rumors were true. They were damn certain.
“Look, this is not a very smart move. Police are already on their way. You don’t want to add another murder to your sentence,” he said, keeping his voice calm. He didn’t move, but raised his arms halfway, showing his empty hands. “Let him go. Drop the knife.”
But this, a fear demon was something serious. Too close to the big guys for John to be comfortable thinking about it. Someone had summoned it, that was for sure. If Jordan had not done it, maybe he had been a target set on the demon by the summoner.
“Da. Da!” She babbled, more calm now. Her heart had stabilised, beating sound and softly. She stayed silent for a bit, then tried again.
His hands were shaking uncontrollably, but he could not stop. As if standing in front of a  mirror, he could see himself losing control. He could see his energy draining slowly, focusing on his  engorged core, ready to strike. The beast inside was euphoric and willing to burn everything to ashes. The feeling of wrong still was expanding across himself, still suffocating. The words were falling from his lips, he couldn’t even filter them. They appeared to be as chaotic as his mind was now. He saw Sherlock look at him in concern. A look he had never seen before. As if he was genuinely scared. He gave a quick look around, as if he was searching for something before his eyes came back to his. He could see the faint glow reflecting at Sherlock’s milky skin and wondered where the light was coming from.
John was dying to get that thing out, knowing it was a mark. An alarm sign that screamed from where he came and what happened to him. He knew that the marks on his own skin would be visible after taking the collar out, but it was easier to conceal a couple of wounds, than a strip of leather surrounding his neck. Although he still had to get used to the sensation of being able to do things without it. In recent times, its absence had been related in his head as mortal danger, so he preferred to wear it a while longer. He was in no hurry of taking it off. He wondered the face that Jim would make when he would see his pet shoot him between the eyes. For a moment he wanted to keep the collar, only so that he could throw it at his face when he confronted him.
Sherlock had explained more details about his new life as a vampire. Sun would not damage him, nor were sacred ground or wood especially harmful. He could go weeks without blood but he would get slow and hungry. Anything able to destroy his brain permanently, keeping him unable to feed until his body rotted, was enough to kill him for good. They talked about many things, yet Sherlock’s past remained a mystery.
a bit relaxing. He knew in his heart a man like Mycroft Holmes was honest and true when he said things like that.
Satisfied with his new arrangement, Sherlock sighed, closed his eyes and drifted back into a relaxed sleep.
Without giving Sherlock a chance to reply, John turned, hands clenched into fists at his sides. Jaw tight, he muttered to himself as he left the alley. A curse at his lips, he tried to mingle with the crowd in an effort to remain calm, and resist the urge to turn around and get lost in those long, comfortable arms. He could not bare the sight of the one he had loved once looking so terribly tormented.
Why would I want to lift a bloody car?” Now Sherlock looked annoyed. He crossed his arms over his chest.
“John, I’m absolutely capable of taking care of your daughter. There’s no need to send her to Graham’s and alter her night habits when I’m available...”
He carefully examined the walls, daring to poke them several times, each time a bit harder than the other. He was almost worried he might damage it. To his surprise, the walls remained in perfect shape, not even a scratch on them. He frowned and took a look around.
He opened his eyes after a while and rose to stand in front of Jordan’s bed. Looking under it, far beyond a casual hand’s reach, was a wooden box with some sort of animation promo engraved at the top. He loosened the lid and opened it.
Being inside of John was a more intense experience than Sherlock had first thought it would be. He got lost in the possessive instinct that compelled him to mark, to take and claim. Careful not to harm John by applying too much enthusiasm to his thrusts, he tried to match them to the beating of John’s heart.
He was hidden on one of the closets the police (unsurprisingly) hadn’t inspected. When John noticed it and tried to open it carefully to get him out, the suspect hit him with the door and fled, jumping out the window.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, a mischievous grin dawning on his face. Slowly, all his brain functions were rebooting themselves.
He smiled tensely, silently judging the press of the knife on John’s back and the movement of the suspect.
“You don’t know how breakable you are... Were. Bones and flesh are so tender. I learned, over the years, where I could touch without causing lasting damage. How much strength to use when holding someone’s hand. The first time I hugged someone human after being turned  I almost broke her ribs. It took me some time to be able to establish a ratio between my strength as a vampire and a human’s. Mycroft and I spent years working on ways to pass as normal men, to act and behave as humans do. Until then, it was mostly a nightmare to touch anyone.”
He moved closer, trying to get his arms into the bathtub, to try and find her, or to find the plug and pull it off so at least some of the water got drained.
Sherlock had only seen his brother like that on rare occasions, so it still was fascinating to observe. He could not deny it was quite convenient now.
The door to apartment A opened with a bang and a splash of water, but no sound came from within. The lake smell was even stronger now. John hurried inside as the water level rose, frantically looking for both the origin of the water and the old landlady.
John did felt himself naked when the people that they were passing by looked at him, still being pulled by the leash. Some with compassion and understanding. Others dryly. There were many that were mocking. Ethan was among them. When he arrived at the infirmary, Molly Hooper attended him, carefully and delicately. They had made her come from St. Bart’s in order to attend him, and it seemed that it wasn’t the first time that someone was in the same state as him.
He sounded reflective, more like muttering to himself. “I took your pulse on more than one occasion. I saw you breathe. You are breathing now. How? How did you fake a pulse? Was it a mind trick?”
John’s voice was an echo inside Sherlock’s head. He felt as if a beehive had found its place inside his brain and everything he heard was muffled by his own thoughts.
“You are a marvel and I don’t deserve you,” John told him softly. His eyes were tender, and his left hand found Sherlock’s, squeezed it gently and intertwined their fingers.
Sherlock stood still, smelling nothing other than John and fresh blood, yet fearful that interruption might cause him disturbance. The silence was absolute.
The angel pressed his lips together, a hand passed across his hair before the fingers pressed against his nose bridge, eyes closed. The other hand came to rest at his hip, and Sherlock could almost hear the gears turning in John’s head.  His thoughts and memories trying to find logic in the new information. He looked frustrated.
John walked slowly to him, found Sherlock’s and and squeezed it gently. Sherlock took a tissue from the desk beside them, and carefully cleaned the blood from his face, mindful of not leaving a drop. When he finished, John caressed his face with his free hand. His thumb moving lovingly over his cheekbone, before guiding him against his, mouth seeking Sherlock’s.
He checked all the rooms, but the landlady was nowhere to be seen. John thought, with a sense of calmness, that perhaps she was away doing shopping, so the only issue there was the flooding.
The Blood of Our Kind will be a series composed by several, incoming short stories about our boys lives as vampires in Baker Street, solving crimes, being BAMF, raising a child, and all I can possibly think about. Plot for the next three one-shots coming after the end of this are being finished, and as soon as I hit the last "Post Without Review", I'll put myself to work.
long time. Hard as he was, the only thing he really wanted to do was turn John around, pin his back to the nearest wall, and mount him till he was sore. And as vampire’s anatomy goes, that would take a while.
Those seven years had tanned his skin, his mind, his body and his heart. He was harder, stronger and more experience than when he had been when he was captured. He began to reach his thirties. He had traces of a beard in his face, and his eyes, although young, they looked like those of  an old man, tired and wise, they were the eyes of someone who had seen too many things. Someone who had lived too much.
John was glowing more now, a faint red light, instead of the clear, white one he used to be made of. The cobblestones around him were beginning to dry, puddles nearby exuding vapour as they evaporated. He could feel the heat radiating from John in constant waves. The static in the air was concentrating, begging to be oppressive. His head was hurting.
was growing by the second. He could feel his wings completely puffed, his core vicious like a caged, hungry beast. Sherlock, on the other hand, looked calm and collected. Coal wings neatly folded at his back, the tips of the longest primaries gently brushing the polished floor.
If it also gave him the chance to have John riding him right there at the kitchen stool after things got heated, well. That was undoubtedly something to celebrate, too. Perhaps even worth the mess of a human sacrifice.
The beeping accelerated when that occurred and he turned his head, enough to see a nurse approaching his room. When she entered, he could see her card from the
Sherlock, who had been grinning back while patiently waiting his turn, laughed softly and began making all sorts of silly noises and sounds, asking Rosie about her day out and kissing her cheek with due ceremony (the exact way he knew would make her explode into contagious baby giggles).
“I don’t think he particularly enjoyed the experience” John spat, rising and walking out the street, trying to locate where the trail was leading. The sound of a pair of shoes walking behind him made him huff. He turned. “If you are responsible for this...”
Thank you, dear readers, for exploring this story, taking your time. Dropping comments or hitting the kudos button. You rock.
The Holmes manor was different that what he had expected. Locked in that small chamber, John had imagined a modern place, full of technology and gadgets of all kinds. What he found instead was a strange yet tasteful combo of very different elements. There was furniture that looked older than he was right next to IKEA pieces and what seemed to be expensive designer chairs and lamps. The mirrors were all classic baroque. Some of the glass had become opaque and almost useless, only vague shapes and colours reflected back.
Sherlock was sniffing the air, trying to find a clear path out of all the various and disgusting smells.
“Listen. The only thing coming between me and a well deserved rest is this case. I’m willing to extend a truce as long as you step aside and let me finish this. Just. Please. If you ever loved me. It’s all I’m asking.”
