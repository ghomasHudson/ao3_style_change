“Tempting. But there’ll be time for that later. And I think I might enjoy making you squirm with anticipation throughout the day.”
Cas tucks a forefinger under Dean's chin and lifts his face, the other hand rising to gently grip his bicep. "Dean. Look at me." He takes a moment to admire the way Dean's green irises sparkle beneath slowly parting lashes when he lifts his gaze—tentative, as if the sight of Castiel might burn away his eyes entirely.
The only thing left to take care of is to finish mounting the new security system that had just come in.
“So, you said you moved around a lot when you were younger, didn’t you?” Castiel asks, threading his hands through his nephew’s hair. “Sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I’d had the opportunity to see the world and if I’m limiting Jack’s experiences by keeping him here on a farm practically in the middle of nowhere.”
He reaches up and pushes tenderly against the raised spot on Dean’s forehead. Dean sucks in a quiet breath, his eyes closing and his eyebrows briefly pulling together, but it doesn’t seem to be too much of a bother. Drawing on that bit of boldness, he trails his hand lightly down the side of Dean’s face, before pulling his hands back to himself.
Soon, the three of them settle in enough to start the movie. Jack eventually gets so into the show, hyped up on sugar, that he fidgets until he can’t stay on the couch any longer and flops belly-first onto the rug where he bends his legs at the knees and gently kicks the carpet to expend his endless reserve of childhood energy. Dean uses the emptier couch to his advantage and drags Cas closer, resting against the cushions as he trails his fingers down the cotton sleeves wrapped around Cas’s biceps. Cas just smiles and snuggles in with a gratified hum when Dean tugs a blanket over them both.
Dean knows that Castiel has his own insecurities. The dragon is obsessed with being useful to Dean, proving himself and earning his keep around the house. Dean’s house has never been cleaner and he works so hard at the garage.
Placing the plant on the concrete, Castiel finally meets Dean’s eyes, “I would like your input.” Nodding for Castiel to continue, Dean tries his hardest to keep his face neutral but full of support. He is a guardian and Castiel says they have a sacred bond. He needs to put aside the growing sense of panic and the inner voice that is repeating
As he pulls the mug from the shelf, he feels an extra heft, the mug is a bit heavier than expected. Instead of pouring the scalding black coffee straight in, Dean peers into his mug.
Taking a sip of coffee, he leans against the counter with the dragon next to him and lets his eyelids droop closed enjoying the coffee and slipping into a morning fog of thoughts. He’s been alone for quite some time now, and having someone to speak to is nice even if it is a little dragon. He’s been divorced for a few years now, Lisa remarried and he’s no longer Ben’s father figure. Sam is married to Eileen and has kids of his own, plus Riot and Bones, Sam’s dogs. His parents are doing well, staying busy with the garage and Mom’s hobbies.
“Can’t relax now, gotta get to work,” Cas sassily replies, smacking an obnoxious kiss to the back of Dean’s neck.
Nodding, Dean unfolds himself from the tub and into a towel. Handing Cas’ towel to him, the two men dry off quickly. The gurgling of the tub is the only noise in the horrible bathroom. Brushing their teeth together, Cas playfully pinches his hip and smiles at him in the garish pink tiled mirror. It warms Dean’s heart, knowing that everything will be ok.
It is no secret that Pastor Dean is single, available, and not entirely straight. Dean counts his blessings that he was raised Lutheran and not Catholic and that he had found this little congregation that was so accepting and had welcomed him with open arms. He has never felt so accepted. He loves this little church and its people.
Cas gazes at him and nods, his face smooth mask and Dean knows he’s battling his own emotions. He can smell Cas’ frustration, anger, and even a little sadness. It taints the forest smell that Dean is so fond of.
“No, my love, no, I know you don’t,” Cas quickly amends kissing Dean lightly on his cheek and then rests their foreheads together. “I know you don’t. What can we do to fix this? Spend more time together, maybe? I’ve missed you so much. We can do weekly dates? We can go places, get out of this house? Maybe make more friends?”
“Hey sweetheart,” his Alpha greets him with a sweet bashful smile, and Dean can’t help but beam back, he’s so grateful for naked tub arguments.
Aftershocks wrack Dean as they slot together, the drying mess pressing between them. He clumsily wipes his hand on a blanket, and a soft chuckle leaks from his lips causing Castiel to smile bashfully in return. High on endorphins, he kisses Cas, quick pecks around his face, eliciting a beautiful smile from the dragon. His eyes and nose are crinkled, grinning ear to ear.
“I am glad you found some rest,” the Prince clears his throat and looks towards the fireplace, “This will be your room. I hope you will find it comfortable here, I know this home is not Lawrence Castle but it is my refuge from Court.”
“Are you about to invite me to come home with you, Padre? Because if you are, the answer is yes. If you aren’t, then no harm no foul, I had a great night in your company.”
Despite all of this, they happily share a pokey little studio apartment. It’s a Sunday and they’ve decided to spend the majority of the day home with plans to go out with Sam tonight and see the city fireworks. They’ve spent the majority of the morning spread out on the couch watching TV, Cas wrapped around him dozing in and out of consciousness and absentmindedly playing with Dean’s greasy hair.
“You’re stuck with me,” Dean retorts back and bites at Castiel’s mark making the Alpha’s hips undulate against his.
It’s Naomi who breaks first, turning to Dean with vehemence in her voice, “You are not soul bound to your dragon, therefore Castiel will be coming home for the court’s choosing. Castiel, you WILL do your duty.”
“We could always schedule fucking for Sundays if Wednesdays don’t work,” Cas comments and Dean can hear the grin in his voice.
Dean feels more than hears Castiel’s breath hitch as he turns in Dean’s embrace lifting his head and joining their lips. The kiss is chaste, sweet to begin with but soon heats as the two men delve deeply into each other’s mouths, their tongues tangling and the breathy sounds of kisses can be heard in the trailer.
Castiel backs up his words with kisses, cheeks, forehead, and lips. A promise in each touch of his lips. They kiss and paw at each other, inflame each other to another level until Dean’s panting and undulating his hips to meet Cas’ own.
It was quiet in the house now that Gram was gone, but there was no way he was trawling for a date on the meat market that was Tinder, or even worse Grindr. He swore he’d meet his partner the “normal way”. His Gram used to chortle at that as they shared a glass of wine in the evenings. “Castiel, there is no “normal” way to meet people anymore - you have to put yourself out there! Be bold!
“I wish they’d slow down,” Castiel murmurs after a kid bumps into him, jerking him out of Dean’s arms and down on the ice. His dragon glares thunderously at the culprit, he’s all furrowed brows and stormy expression but to Dean, he looks adorably rumpled as he is pouting. Dean can’t help but laugh, pulling Cas to his feet once more.
Folgers looks at him serenely, ever intelligent eyes showing that he understands what Dean is saying.
“Well, as an Omega who doesn’t know how to behave I thought I’d swing by and let you in on a little secret,” Dean pauses for effect inching closer to the ignorant swine, “Alphas with small dicks and big mouths like yourself would never be able to satisfy an independent and uppity Omega like me.”
Castiel seems amused with all the booths and the people milling about eating ice cream in the middle of winter. He convinces Dean to purchase hot chocolate and fairy floss, the two sharing the sweet fluffy candy and sipping the hot chocolate. They stay close, shoulders and the back of their hands brushing each other as they walk.
Cas drops his head, submitting easily to Dean as he opens the rest of the race suit and peels the warm leather from his friend’s shoulders and arms. It is quite a tug when the leather is damp, and Cas is nearly tugged off balance as the suit comes free around his wrists. Dean is impatient to get to the rest of Castiel’s warm brown skin. Once the leathers are down around his co-driver’s waist Dean wraps his arms around Castiel from behind nipping and sucking at his neck and bringing a bright bloom to the skin there.
Castiel continues to gently caress the back of Dean’s neck. His strokes become bolder as he runs his hand along Dean’s shoulders, before cupping the back of his head gently and drawing him closer. Dean allows the dragon to move him and closes his eyes finally allowing himself to just feel.
“Yeah. I’m not the town bicycle, but yeah… I’ve been around,” Dean replies, “I’m on birth control and I get tested regularly. Clean bill of health as of this week.”
“Son, I think you know you got a Dragon there who has chosen you as his guardian. That ain’t no passing whim, that’s a responsibility and an honor to folks like us. You get to know him, look after him and provide for him, son and you will never regret it. That’s all I’m gonna say right now until I talk to your Mom.”
Humming his approval, Dean takes one of Castiel’s hands and guides it towards his forgotten erection. Getting the message, Cas releases his thumb with an audible pop and focuses on fucking into Dean and his hand matching his stroke. He can feel a steady stream of precome easing the glide of Castiel’s hand. Dean’s mouth drops open, letting out low groans. He watches the beauty of Castiel’s hips slide and disappear into him.
As he turns out the last light the bar is illuminated only by the glow of streetlights through the front window. The light falls on a poster on the other side of the bar, Dean can’t remember where it came from, maybe it has always been there. It’s one of those fake vintage de-inspirational quote posters, and proclaims in a weird unbalanced  font “THE words are EMPTY promises.” And the hell if he knows what that even means. As he passes through the bar area to his private residence at the back it strikes him that sometimes he feels empty, sometimes he feels a longing, a hollowness where something should be if he could just work out what.
Dean grunts, diving down into the belly of the engine. He works his bottom lip between his teeth. Questions about dragons on the tip of his tongue.
“Today, I, Castiel of Lawrencia, state my intentions beneath the lights of my ancestors. I bare my soul to my rider, my guardian, my keeper, Dean Winchester,” Castiel bites his lip, holding on to Dean’s hand tight and staring into Dean’s eyes. He nods as if answering his own question and continues on, “A traditional handfasting along with the exchange of blood will create the bond. So uh, repeat after me and if pain comes, just hold on.” Castiel reaches up with his other hand to wipe snow away from Dean’s brow. A loving smile playing on his lips.
“Done,” Castiel states firmly carding pruney fingers through Dean’s hair. Dean sinks into his touch, hungry, desperate for more. His mate pets him, scent marks him, and fingers skim over Dean’s mating mark.
After a series of kitten licks to his old mating mark, Castiel sighs and bonelessly leans into his mate, “Was that really Jack and Ben?”
Grunting only a little at his Alpha’s heavy weight against his back, Dean can’t stop the laughter that shakes his frame.
“It’s only for a little while, you landed us next to the lodge?” Dean questions, pulling out the items needed for the bonding ceremony. Knife and rope are shoved into his pocket while Castiel pulls on his boots.
“I’m not opposed to you teaching him a lesson,” Castiel looks over at the other Alpha guilelessly, but eyes crinkling in delight.
“Boys, there’s no use me beating around the bush. I had a visitor today while you were back here eating your lunches. I didn’t care for his tone, and he was sniffing around tryna find out both your names and how long you’d been here, Cas.”
Even Sammy’s raging bitchfest about coming to Stanford for “Unattached Drifters Christmas” can't dampen Dean’s euphoria. And oh sweet son of a bitch… did Sammy climb the mountain of his soapbox and harp on Dean. For a good forty-five minutes about how Dean’s personal Christmas was downright skeevy, and also why Dean felt so compelled to visit Stanford to pick up college girls and guys when he could just go to a bar back home. (Little did Sammy know, Dean couldn’t actually visit a bar within a hundred-mile radius of home because everyone knew he was John’s Omega boy and all the bartenders would kick him out.)
Letting out a large sigh that fills his chest and then hollows him out, Castiel nuzzles against Dean’s neck, his voice causing vibrations against Dean’s neck, “Some dragons, like myself, are hermaphroditic. We are rare and pawns to the needs of our dragon court. In the past, if a dominant female in power died, a smaller younger non-threatening male would take her place as interim ruler until the new Queen was chosen.”
“Relax, Alpha,” Dean instructs. Biting his lip, Castiel nods and drops his legs open even wider than before.
Tied together, Cas gathers Dean up and holds onto him tightly. Dean basking in the scent of his happy Alpha.
“My mom, she made me that,” Dean explains, rubbing his mouth forlornly, “I didn’t know what it meant. I bet she did though.”
“I guess we dragons did the same as young,” Castiel smiles, holding on Dean’s jacket, “When I was learning to fly, Gabriel would delight in swooping and diving on me.”
“Yes,” Castiel’s exasperation is apparent but he stumbles on, “We… We were intimate once, and then suddenly we were not. You said you’d wait till I was ready for more, but I am confused, Dean. I don’t know what that means. I guess I’m “ready,” was I supposed to explicitly say this to you?” Castiel throws up his arms, full of exasperation and ire, “And I
Even though he disapproves of the meal itself, Cas makes one of Dean’s favorite things; a Winchester Surprise. The smell of pork, beef, cheese, pickles, and biscuit fill the kitchen and makes his mouth water. The kids are gathered around the table, Krissy’s face is still puffy from earlier that day and the kids are definitely more subdued than normal. When one of them gets in trouble, the rest usually fall into line and Dean is beyond grateful because he couldn’t take anymore strife today. It wasn’t pleasant to see Cas chew Krissy out, had even pulled out his own Alpha voice and basically taught Krissy a very meaningful lesson. She had cried, said the weed wasn’t hers (Dean doubted this) but had apologized profusely. All was forgiven, but not forgotten, and Krissy was still very grounded.
They may not have the freedom to be who they truly wish to be, but they can have this. And most of the time, this is enough.
He doesn’t have to tell Folgers twice, the dragon falls asleep quickly. Dean can feel the rise and fall of his chest and the exhalation of warm air against his neck. It's comforting and Dean watches Dr. Sexy, MD with a soft smile on his face the entire time.
Dean gives a self deprecating laugh and slaps his thigh with the cloth he’s been using to wipe down the tables.
“Dean has met Naomi, my superior of the court. She tried to get me to return, to abandon my keeper, to leave my place at his side, but I never will,” Cas turns to Dean in that moment “Dean, Keeper, please believe me, I don’t want to go.”
“Not that I don’t appreciate a greasy meal, but what's the occasion? Cas doesn’t cook and certainly doesn’t approve of this,” Kaia asks, the scoop of Surprise on her plate a steaming mountain of cheese.
“Be still, my Omega, I will take care of you. It’s my job, and my pleasure” Castiel says as he guides the head of his cock to Dean’s slick and ready hole. He teases Dean, running the head across his Mate’s loose and wet hole, before steadily pushing the head through and into Dean’s channel.
With another flick of Castiel’s wrist, Dean is standing and meeting eyes the color of the clearest blue diamonds. Even the bloody mix of mud and grime on the man’s face could not dim the almost ethereal glow of those eyes. They remind Dean of the blue diamond his mother commissioned years ago to be placed in his circlet on his eighteenth birthday. He stares into the man’s breathtaking eyes, soft and solemn despite the gore surrounding them.
Just like last time, Castiel’s kisses are passionate, all-consuming and again make Dean forget himself. Once again Dean’s hesitancy, his fears of being too old for Castiel evaporate when the dragon eagerly moans and trembles above him.
“You are so beautiful,” Cas breathes, his breath tickling and inflaming his cock, “Even here, so beautiful.”
“A little, not enough to complain about though,” replies Dean. Castiel presses a kiss to his neck, hand splayed across Dean’s chest. A soft light glows from his palm, Dean’s aches melt away.
“You have a fifteen-minute drive and a five-minute walk across campus, Alpha. That just means you need to come quick,” Dean teases, pushing Castiel up against their counter.
Bobby has listened with full attention to Dean’s tale, never letting his face reveal a thing except for a knowing look in his eyes.
Stripping in their bathroom, Dean hesitates before starting the water. Staring down at the smattering of hair over his pectorals and the trail to his bush of pubes, he should shave… right?
“What?” Dean guffaws, totally blown away by Cas’ ridiculousness. His mate goes into their dated Pepto pink bathroom and turns on the tap. “I’m not climbing into that tub, there isn’t enough room!” Dean snaps pointing angrily at the tub.
They fly up in the clouds, high where the air is cool and quiet. Castiel skims the highest of lowest clouds, keeping in mind Dean’s tolerance for cold temperatures.They had started at midnight, Castiel had insisted, he was way too anxious to sleep anyways. Dean had created a bed in the modified saddle that is currently strapped securely between Castiel’s enormous wings. Although Dean is snuggled and buckled between their bags and equipment, he hasn’t slept much, preferring to watch out at the dark sky over the powerful beats of his dragon’s wings.
Dean nods, swallowing audibly. The Prince is also still battle filthy. Two attendants stand stoically nearby, one with bathing needs and the other with fresh clothing. Dean watches while the Prince removes his own armor and clothing. When nude, the Prince wraps a large hand around Dean’s bicep and bids him silently to stand. He leads him into the clear and slow moving waters of the river. Nervous, Dean’s eyes flit from the attendants to the profile of the Prince. The attendants place their items on a large rock nearby, scoop up the dirty clothes, bow and walk away.
“Come here,” Castiel softly commands, cradling Dean’s face in his own hands and plants devastating kisses against Dean’s lips, then neck. Castiel’s open mouthed kisses explore, pulling on Dean’s skin and leaving a cooling trail of pink marks against his freckled skin. He nips at Dean’s nipples, pulling a wanton moan from him. Dean can feel Castiel smiling against his stomach before the other man moves further south.
Smiling so large that his nose and eyes crinkle up adorably, Castiel holds on to Dean’s tightly. They stare into each other’s eyes, the forest around them so quiet it’s almost loud. Dean can practically hear his blood rush through his veins. He imagines he can feel their blood intermingling in their palms, Castiel’s blood electrifying and sparking a change within him. Their breath creates little mist clouds in the air between them.
He likes to savor his Omega, to undo him slowly like the gift he is. He likes fucking Dean’s hole with his tongue, swallowing him down, making his mate tremble and scream.
“Dean, beloved, we don’t have to do this,” he starts and Dean interrupts him with a quick, “Yes we do, Cas.”
There’s something in his mug - but Dean’s half-asleep mind cannot believe what his eyes are telling him. There’s a small dragon, curled up fast asleep in the bottom of his favourite mug. Shiny scales line the small body of the dragon, so dark blue they appear black. Blindly setting the coffee pot back down onto the hot plate, he doesn’t take his eyes off of the small reptilian creature. Rubbing his eyes with his other hand, Dean convinces himself that some sleep crusties are somehow creating this visage of a dragon.
They chuckle, exchanging small smiles. Dean begins to clear up their table, piling up the dishes and moving their drinks to the side before he reaches across and grabs his mate by the shirt to pull him into a kiss across the chequered tablecloth. Cas meets him halfway and they silently pledge their love in the sweet kiss that follows. Dean’s hand ventures up from Castiel’s shirt to the back of his neck to his fingers in his hair. Holding him tight to Dean and directing their kiss. Castiel sighs happily and follows his lead, as always.
“That’s wonderful, my little love…” Cas relinquishes his anger and pulls his children into tight hugs, “I’m glad you enjoyed yourselves, but next time you must tell Nanny or myself where you are going. You both were gone for a long time.”
“The fuck she is!” Dean growls, pushing Cas off him as they both tumble out of the bathroom. The moment is clearly over, Dean is left with slick cooling in his briefs as his arousal disappears like a puff of smoke. Cas slumps, he buttons his pants back up and wills his erection to go away.
Lower and lower Castiel goes, until his great wings are skimming the tips of trees. When they land, it’s a soft thud into fresh snow. Dean pats at scales he can reach, untangles himself from the luggage and ropes, and jumps off the saddle to pull everything into the snow.
Dean’s low voice is laced with humour as he replies. “Thank you Ma’am, I’m flattered, but I’m gay. I do appreciate your offer though,” he laughs and presses her hand.
The pool dances with reflections on the surface, and heaves with the crowd who are swimming, diving and generally having a great time in the sun. Dean loses sight of Cas for a moment, but is reassured when he sees him wave as he starts toward the deeper end in a perfect breast stroke.
The blue fire ignites between their palms, Dean wincing but holding tight, green eyes never leaving Castiel’s blue. The rope burns away and Castiel quickly pulls Dean to his body and heals Dean’s cut and burns before he can pass out from the pain.
Dean sinks down on his Alpha, riding him fast and hard. Castiel’s face and chest are completely flushed red, his mouth open in a little ‘o’ of adoration and exaltation. His eyes are glassy and the blue is eclipsed by the black. He’s almost ethereally carnal in the moment. Dean jacks himself frantically and comes on his Alpha messily. He sinks down on Cas’ knot purposefully making him shout hoarsely.  It’s quick and dirty, Cas shakes hard with the aftershocks and Dean can feel him coming violently, coating his channel and filling him so delightfully.
As the cold of winter fades into the warming breezes of spring, Dean finds himself growing more comfortable in Castiel’s company. Cuddling in front of the fire in the evening has given way to sitting on the porch, drinking a beer, and sharing the quiet time of evening together after a busy work day. Dean loves his time with his dragon, even doing the most mundane chores are madeover in new light with Castiel. Laundry is folded with laughter, the bed is made with teasing smiles, and dinner is cooked in between dancing in the kitchen. Dean and Cas settle into a comfortable routine of happy domesticity, although Dean still marvels at the fact that this gorgeous creature thinks that he is worth being with.
“I sent a man to locate your brother and mother some time ago, he was successful and I expect their arrival any day. Our lives will change and I… I wanted to kiss you since I will no longer be able to,” Castiel whispers against Dean’s crown.
“Yes, sweetheart,” Castiel replies, panicking only slightly. As soon as this dreadful meeting is over he’s going to have to call Sam. Hopefully, he’s not busy, but Castiel will cash in some favors with the other Alpha.
“May he have peace in the halls.” Castiel whispers, unheard by his brothers. Dean relaxes into the vines, the will to fight leaching from his limbs They are defeated and magic will continue to terrorize this land.
His mate pushes down his sweats, gathers his own sweet slick in one of his hands, and coats their two erections. Castiel breathes deeply, he loves the smell of his mate’s slick. Earthy and sweet, it makes his mouth water and his cock twitch. Dean chuckles, gathering more that has escaped from his ready hole, and touches Castiel’s bottom lip teasingly before dropping his hand and teasing Castiel’s tip with his fingertips.
“Jack! Claire!” A deep voice calls out across the atrium and the Prince makes long angry strides towards the motley crew.
“Hold your horses,” Dean scolds, smoothing his hand over his chest and the dragon, “Alright, we’re ready.”
“You’re so wet,” he murmurs, nose against Dean’s balls nuzzling. Kitten licks up against Dean’s hole. The long sweeps of the flat of his tongue, humming and moaning at Dean’s taste.
Dean lays a comforting hand in the middle of his dragon’s back. Everything in him is screaming to grab his dragon and fight off this threat, but he holds steadfast behind Castiel.
Castiel is so grateful for his true mate, wanting him to feel appreciated and loved. His mate had hung in there, even when they lived in the shoebox apartment with the extremely thin walls while he attended university.
“’M’close,” Dean stutters out, eyes rolling to the back of his head. Castiel growls in response, his knot swelling and catching Dean’s rim. Cas reaches around, his large hand swallowing Dean’s cock matching his thrusts.
Dean chatters as he works, not expecting a reply. He tells Folgers about his job, the guys he works with, the house and all the work he’s done on it, Sammy… all the minutiae that make up Dean Winchester’s boring run-of-the-mill life.
“All yours, Folgers a whole dollar and ten in change! If you want I could bring it for you?” and the dragon nods again, more confidently.
“Make sure you take your coffee,” Dean jokes, tucking Castiel’s flagging erection back into his pants. Dean is careful not to touch his knot, knowing Castiel could come again very easily. Castiel’s knot tingles at just the thought, wanting to paint his Omega’s skin again and mark him. But, unless Castiel ignores his Alpha instincts he’ll never be able to get to work on time.
Cas waited as Dean fumbled the key in the lock, and finally, the door swung open. Before he had left for the bar, Dean had left a lamp on, and upon returning, the room looked warm and inviting from the front door. As he turned to invite his companion in, Dean lost his breath as Castiel reached out and took his face gently between his two very warm hands. With a raised eyebrow, he waited for consent before he leaned in and kissed Dean thoroughly. Castiel has kissed like he had made it his mission to demolish his lover with his lips alone.
“Hi,” Dean says standing up suddenly and grabbing the folded sweatshirt, “This is yours.” He holds it out.
Cas spends the whole drive wondering what on earth his Gram is up to, and teetering between worry and annoyance. He had planned to go to the library this weekend and collect some books he had on hold, and then to the specialist garden centre to pick up some heirloom tomato, pepper and cucumber seedlings. But, that would have to wait. His Gram was too important.
“No!” Castiel practically shouts and then quiets himself, “Yes, possibly in time but not now...not forced by the Court.”
Lonely is putting it mildly, Dean is beyond sad but he’s too scared to call it depression. It sinks into his bones and gnaws at him day after day. He wakes up and wants to stay in bed, sleep so he doesn’t have to deal with the day, but they need the money and so he goes to work. Dean has to take care of Cas, he has to make sure they have a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. He has to clean, do the laundry, and cook dinner. This is not how he imagined his life with his mate. It’s disappointing and even when he tries his best to be a good husband, good mate, he feels like he’s drowning.
“I really am sorry about that,” Cas says, and for one horrifying moment, Dean thinks he’s said all of that out loud. But then he remembers the knot forming on his forehead and realizes what the apology is for.
A spike of trepidation jolts straight from his head to his gut as he fumbles for the lightswitch, flipping it a few times to no effect. Breath held, he activates the flashlight feature on his phone and sweeps it across the room, illuminating a scene that sends a cold wave of devastation crashing over him, rooting him to the spot. What had been a fully renovated storefront when he left this morning is now a graveyard of splintered tables and overturned chairs, lightbulb shards strewn across the floor, busted display cases, and graffiti expletives spray painted over smashed subway tile.
“Don’t get excited,” Dean quotes back, pulling the hand to his lips and feathering kisses onto each individual knuckle. As if he weren’t doing the very things he knows cause excitement.
A diagonal shuffle on alternating feet brings them close together again and Dean lifts a palm, high-fiving Cas on his way past.
He finds the items he’s looking for, but makes a split decision to double back after putting them in his car. Poking his head past the stall flap, he finds Castiel leaning one elbow on the counter, writing out a list of some sort.
He fills a thermos for Jack (who has a tendency to make a mess when he gets excited) and two mugs with steamed milk. “It’s still hot. Don’t drink it yet. Just hold it,” Dean warns after stirring in the cocoa packet and attaching the top securely to Jack’s drink.
“Damn,” he mutters, squinting a bit as he tries to keep sight of the road. “Where did this come from?”
Dean’s not sure what his problem is. Sam has never given him a reason to think he would be anything other than accepting of Dean’s relationship with another man. Hell, he probably figured out a long time ago that Dean is about as straight as a thin rubber ruler.
“I’m sure your brother is as proud of you for following your dreams as you are of him,” Castiel says as he reaches his bicycle. He unlocks the chain and pulls it from the metal stand.
“Hmmm.” Jack’s face morphs into an expression of utmost concentration as he tries to think of an answer. He even taps his chin with one little finger. “A dinosaur with rainbow sneakers,” he says confidently as if it makes all the sense in the world. He wiggles a bit and goes back to eating.
“Lay it on me,” Dean prompted, eager but just as shocked to be speaking to a talking table that was also God (and also, kind of, his kid).
Even though they’ve said goodbye, they both stare at one another, as if waiting for the other to move first. Castiel feels a sudden urge to lean in, to close the distance between himself and this man he barely knows. Spooked by the unexpected thought, he clears his throat and applies reluctant pressure to the pedals, hoping for the chill of the wind to distract him as he speeds away.
to protect a winged baby. Us. As in, a hunter with a grudge against God on a good day and a grounded angel? In case you haven’t noticed, Cas, we’re not exactly
Dean shivered at the intensity of Castiel’s regard, but he was nothing if not an expert on ignoring large elephants in small rooms. “And you were actually asleep for a moment there, weren’t you? I thought the spell would’ve worn off by now. Jack said it would be temporary. Shouldn’t your mojo be back?”
An arm encircles Dean’s waist and pulls him closer but with their bodies aligned, Cas pushes Dean against the sink, gasping into his mouth. Dean moans around the kiss, brow furrowed and tongue darting fervently between Cas’s soft lips. Cinnamon and sugar mingle as they continue to explore each other in this way, licking and suckling, until Cas feels Dean growing hard between them.
“Dean, are you okay in there?” He felt stupid even asking. Of course Dean wasn’t okay. He hadn’t been okay in a long time, but especially not since November. Sam pounded on the door with more force. “Dean, talk to me, or I’m coming in.”
Gabe gives Sam a once-over. “What the hell, Cassie? You’ve been holding out on me. Why didn’t you tell me he had such a tall drink of water for a brother?”
through his office doorway the next morning with his phone held high above his head, practically shouting,
Following right behind them, Dean reaches out to help Cas open the door to the guest room and pull back the covers to lay Jack on the mattress. This room is even colder than the living room, so Dean opens a drawer and retrieves an extra blanket. He watches Cas kiss Jack’s temple, then tucks the quilt around the boy and brushes a lock of blonde hair away from his eyes. “Night, Jack.”
“Okaaayy! Who’s ready for pizza, cake, and presents?” Castiel interrupts. As predicted, Jack distracts the conversing adults by wriggling to be set down from where Gabriel is holding him on his shoulders.
The fact that the table had exploded was one thing. But the truly bewildering part was that it was now
Turning off the oven’s Keep Warm mode, Dean pulls the fresh pie from within. He grabs a serving knife from a nearby drawer and proceeds to slice into the outer layer of pastry. Filling oozes around the metal spade as he lifts one slice and then another onto dessert plates. After a brief pour of steaming milk over the cocoa and a spoon tossed into each cup, he opens a freezer set behind the counter. Scoops of vanilla bean ice cream are dropped onto the pie slices.
They stumble into the dim room, untouched by the break-in and kept Spartan clean. Though there is nothing to trip on, they still collapse onto the bed in an ungraceful, tangled heap of limbs and half-shed clothing. Cas climbs over Dean’s lap and helps him out of his shirt, the button-up and Cas’s sweater having already been discarded somewhere in the hall.
? Oh my god. Are you okay?” Castiel can’t believe he just smacked a heavy object into the very person he was on his way to go see. To ask on a date.
“Missed you, too, jerk.” Sam pats Dean’s back affectionately and then holds him at arm’s length. “I’m really happy for you, Dean.”
“I’m teaching Miracle what not to do.” He glanced down at the dog curled comfortingly at his side. Miracle’s tail patted the blanket and his ears perked at the mention of his name. Quieter, Dean whispered into his phone, “I gotta go, Cas. I’ll talk to you later.”
He waited a few seconds, but when he got no response, he pushed his way into the bedroom. Unsurprisingly, Dean lay conked out on the couch, hugging his booze like a child with a stuffed animal. Sam sighed. He hated seeing him like this.
“So, before we get to the apiary,” Cas starts as they pass a carefully manicured herb and vegetable garden where Dean imagines Cas probably talks to his plants while he waters them, “There are some rules to be aware of. Jack, what’s rule number one?”
Chaz opens his mouth but promptly closes it and shakes his head, loose curls bouncing against his face.
The clerk grabs a bottle marked SAMPLE and unscrews the top. He dips two thin wooden spoons into the honey and holds one out. As Dean takes it, he watches, mesmerized, as the clerk slides the second spoon between his own lips and over his tongue. “Quality control,” the man says with a wink and tosses the garbage into a nearby can.
By the time Dean could form a coherent thought that didn’t include blue eyes and a trenchcoat, Sam had long stopped calling. The phone lay motionless and silent beside Dean’s body which had curled in on itself and was shaking with each painful inhalation. Maybe Sam assumed Dean had disappeared along with all the others.
Jack paused and, as Sam fumbled his way through translating as best he could to Eileen, Dean started to wonder if the holy wifi had dropped somehow. He raised his eyebrows. “Should? Forgive the skepticism, pal, but why do I get the feeling this’ll be harder than it sounds?”
Dean gapes up at him, hands splayed out on either side, just sitting there in the hallway with cheeks flushed red as a lobster with a sunburn. Castiel’s own face is a furnace. He scrubs a palm over the heated skin quickly and offers the other. Dean takes it and Cas pulls him up. He’s not expecting Dean to push off the floor with the full strength of both of those beautiful bow legs, so he puts a little too much force in his pull, and suddenly he’s yanking Dean
Dean blew a drunken raspberry of a sigh past his lips. “Well, we hit a roadblock. Looks like we might— might be S.O.L. on getting you back this time. Like, for real. I hope you’re at least— at least at rest.” He clenched the neck of the bottle so hard he wondered if it might shatter. That would be poetic, wouldn’t it? To have all the little pieces fall around him like all the little shards jumbled up inside.
“Funny enough, the real MVP was a kid who went full-on Macaulay Culkin. He set up this elaborate trap and, through sheer dumb luck, managed to put enough iron on the floor for the sucker to be slowed down until we could get there and cap ‘im.”
Gawking momentarily at Cas’s retreating back, Dean lifts the coffee to his face and drinks it black, praying for it to kick him in the ass soon so he can comprehend what just happened.
“I suppose you’re right.” Castiel acknowledges, but changes the subject. “So, how’d you like the honey?”
Dean decided to take a different approach. Instead of the touchy feely crap, he would just...lay out the facts. Give a little status update. He could handle that much. Right?
Drill in one hand and camera in the other, Dean braces himself against the ladder currently angled against the wall and tilts the camera up into the porch eaves so that it faces the front entryway. The tool whirrs as it settles the first screw into the board behind it.
Dean usually let Miracle into his room at night to snuggle on the bed, but his door was closed. Earlier, he’d said he just wanted to get some sleep for his birthday and Sam had reluctantly agreed. Dean hadn’t taken Rowena’s news well, though he’d tried to hide it. Sam could see the way his brother’s jaw had ground his molars together and how his eyes had glistened as he heard the witch queen’s regretful reply. Sam knew better than anyone what that meant.
, Dean? I know you’re particularly fond of the intro.” Cas sits on the far side of the couch and sets his cocoa on the side table, lip twitching with restrained amusement as Dean shoots him a glare above Jack’s head. Way to crucify a guy for having feelings he’d never fess up to.
the humor sparkling in his eyes, and he loves the way Dean bites his lip and blushes as he rolls his eyes.
He kisses the side of Dean’s head and says, “Come on, I believe it’s time for me to ‘date the fuck out of you.’”
As Dean moves to pull away, Chaz dives forward, wrapping his tiny arms around Dean’s torso and staring up with shining eyes and a bright smile. “Woah, hey. I guess that means you dig the jammies?” Dean tousles the kid’s hair with one hand and places the other between the upper wings, returning the hug.
Castiel shook his head. “Sam said as much when he explained what you two had done, but... the spell took more than a mere slice of your soul. It split it in two. The half it claimed from you wasn’t just borrowed. It merged with what was left of my grace and became something entirely new. Something the Empty didn’t like the taste of. I think— I think I’m human now. Or, at least as close to human as a celestial being like me can get.”
And he definitely doesn’t notice the way Cas’s jeans hug his hips as he leans over the seat to grab something from inside the truck’s cabin.
Dean gathers the salad bowl and two of the cups while Cas picks up the rest. He soon shoos his visitor upstairs as he switches on the rapid kettle to heat some milk. He moves mugs pre-filled with hot chocolate mix onto a tray as the diminishing sound of Cas’s footsteps creak old floorboards overhead.
“Hey! I forgot to take my allergy pill that day, remember? And Nougat was all up in my face.” So what if he’d basically used the cat as a Kleenex during Ellie’s death scene? Cas just snorts, taking the defensiveness as confirmation, and Dean gives meaning to the term ‘throw pillow’ by tossing one at his boyfriend’s head.
“Are you okay?” she signed one-handed, surveying the room for danger and assessing the damage. Evidently, the boom had been felt all the way across the bunker. “What happened?”
“Please be careful, Dean,” Cas says in that impossibly husky voice he has before morning coffee that melts Dean’s insides.
Cas laughs from the stomach, his joy bubbling out of him so fully, he couldn’t hold it in if he tried. Against his neck, he feels Dean smile and then, right against the corner of his jaw, a soft, gentle kiss.
“Billie was mistaken. Human souls are inherently incompatible with the Empty. The only reason I was able to remain hidden is because my grace shrouded my humanity.”
The pain in his voice, such a bleak contrast to the carefree and playful Dean from just a few hours ago, breaks Castiel’s heart. “You couldn’t have known this would happen.”
Laid bare in more than just the physical sense, Dean blushes furiously from chest to scalp. He bites his lip, entranced, watching Cas step out of his pants. Unsurprisingly, the sight of Cas thick and glistening before him only amplifies his arousal.
All previous traces of moping disappear. With a devilish twinkle in his eye, Dean runs his hands along Cas’s spine—relishing the resultant shiver—and squeezes the flesh right above his waistline. “Are you just saying that so I’ll shut up and take you upstairs?”
“Do that again,” Dean gasps, and he doesn’t wait to slide one hand up the side of Cas’s neck, thumbing along the stubble at the corner of his jaw and coming to rest at the base of his ear. The other hand grabs Cas’s shoulder and tugs.
The Sam voice drew closer, incredulous. “And that requires talking?” He obviously didn’t buy Dean’s bullshit.
With his back turned, Castiel hears the pet door open and an attention-seeking meow follows shortly thereafter. “You’ll get your food in a minute,” he says without looking down at the tawny-on-white creature currently wrapping itself between his ankles.
Those same hands rub tender circles, spilling cool water over the split flesh, cleansing away dried blood, patting the skin dry, applying protective ointment.
“No, no. I’m sorry, Cas. Here,” Dean says, still beet red but reaching out. Cas gingerly accepts the outstretched hand. As there are still no other guests in line, Dean takes the opportunity to meet and looks up at his yeti of a little brother.
“Back home in Kansas, studying to be a lawyer. I’m happy for him, but he’s been one of the only reliable people in my life. It was hard to leave that behind, ya know?” The alcohol starts to make Dean’s head swim pleasantly.
Castiel jolted as if he’d only just dozed off. “Dean,” he said softly, leaning forward to rest his forearms on his knees. “How are you feeling?” The hard lines under his eyes appeared even more sunken than before, somehow. (Hadn’t he been asleep for the past six months?) In the dim light of the bedside lamp, Dean could make out a bloodshot canvas behind those beautiful irises, the skin around Castiel’s eyes puffy and red.
, um, silly head tilt you did when you were trying to understand some little quirk of humanity. The way you hugged and almost never let go first. Your freaky little staring contests in the dark. How you hardly ever wore anything other than Jimmy’s last outfit, like it was just another part of the body. I guess it mighta felt that way to you, huh?” Dean wondered what it would be like to rocket through the cosmos on a beam of light, or however it was that angels traveled from one plane of existence to another in their true forms.
Only love could drive Dean to lift the comforter, letting in the frigid air of the bedroom. Only love could convince Dean to allow bony knees to knock the breath out of him as Jack clambers across his torso and nestles in the center of the bed, narrowly avoiding elbowing him in the crotch. Dean has never been happier to have a king-sized mattress.
Healthy coping mechanisms be damned, he needs a drink. The guilt of having left the door unlocked bears down onto Dean’s shoulders and his father’s voice echoes in his mind, dredging up the memory of a time when Sam had run away on Dean’s watch.
He looks like he has more to say, so Castiel keeps quiet, dragging soothing fingers down Dean’s arm. He’ll stop if Dean wants him to, of course, but if anything, Dean is trembling less now that he’s being held, so Castiel continues willing some measure of comfort through his fingertips.
“Thunderstorms are a product of warm, wet air rising into the atmosphere and—” Castiel is interrupted by a crack of lightning so close, deafening thunder rattles the car almost immediately. He glares past Dean and out the driver’s side window as if offended by the force of nature surrounding them.
Cas turns around and fixes Dean with the same assessing gaze he’d given him during their introduction. “You cleaned up nicely,” he says simply.
At a certain point in Dean’s life, he might have thought the whole “hot for teacher” thing would be, well,
When Dean wakes again, he is alone in the big bed, sprawled out flat like a cartoon character hit with an ACME anvil. The other side of the mattress is cold and empty. Frowning at the time on his phone, he realizes that Cas probably had to drive Jack to school and resigns himself to a lonely morning of tidying the house, tackling some chores, and (first and foremost) coffee.
“Shit, Cas, you’re so fucking hot. Feels s’good,” Dean moans, relishing the sensations, chin angling upward with a backward toss of his head.
“Oh, I wouldn’t want to intrude.” Despite what Sam might say, Dean knows his manners—but he can’t keep a hopeful tone from creeping into his voice.
A nervous chuckle escapes Dean at the stare boring into him. He can smell Cas’s earthy scent, rain-fresh flowers drying in the springtime sunrise.
Willingly drowning in the depths of Cas’s ocean blues, Dean doesn’t realize he’s crying again until Cas reaches up and runs a thumb over the defiant droplet. Without thinking, Dean lifts the hand not held and uses it to press his cheek further into Cas’s palm, eyes closing. When he looks again, Cas has closed the gap between them, a rosiness to his cheeks that can’t be explained away by cold or booze this time.
“Is there anything I can help with before I go? Trash to take out?” Cas stops to rest both palms on the countertop and surveys the mostly clean cooking space.
Turning toward the stairs, a subdued Dean leads Cas to the second-floor bathroom as Cas types out a quick text message to let Gabriel know he’s going to be a while and not to wait up, but that everything is under control.
Bully kid spins so fast he almost twists his ankle as he scrambles in the opposite direction. He doesn’t stop to pick up the snapback hat that flies off his head, landing with the front facing Castiel.
Whether minutes or hours later, Dean is awoken by a small hand patting his face and the sound of sniffling. He and Cas had fallen asleep face-to-face in a jumble of limbs and body-heated fabric, but at some point, they had shifted so that Dean was on his stomach, head turned toward the door.
“Thank you, Dean.” Stepping in from the chilly autumn weather, Cas runs a hand through his helplessly windswept hair. He surveys the shop for a moment, taking in the half-finished subway tile backsplash, modern industrial display cases, dangling edison bulbs, bare concrete flooring, and four sets of tables with two chairs each lining the wall across from the sales counter. Another week or two and this place should be ready to open. “I wish I had seen the state this place was in before you took hammer and chisel to it, but it looks like it’s coming along nicely. I’m impressed.”
The floor drops out from under Dean. His stomach goes with it. Oh god, he really needs some water. And some grease.
Returning the hug, Dean rests his ear and cheek against Cas’s hair and closes his eyes. He’s so caught up in the tenderness, he doesn’t even hear the sound of someone approaching, their footsteps lost to the quiet hum of the other patrons.
Dean starts to order the special when Cas unexpectedly appears beside him as if summoned. Dean lets out a startled yelp. “Damn, Cas. You’re like a cat. Scared the bejeezus outta me.”
Dean cocks his head to look down at the man holding the ladder steady as if his own life depends on it. “I’m fine, Cas. You can go inside and start up the espresso machine if watching me work is making you nervous.” He turns back and sinks another screw.
As Cas lifts his gaze, Dean’s heartbeat pounds in his ears. The angel’s eyes flash gold before returning to their familiar Mediterranean blue. “It is a blessing,” Cas says simply, shifting his arms to reveal a sleeping child—one Dean would guess to be about 2 years old if not for the three pairs of fluffy sparrow-brown wings swaddling the half-pint’s body and the whole born-from-lightning situation.
From the kitchen, Dean hears the sounds of some sort of food being prepared and his mouth waters in anticipation of breakfast. But as he rounds the corner, he’s both surprised and enamored by what he sees.
A few blinks later, Dean’s circuits reconnect and he finds Cas picking repeatedly at the same mutilated section of pie, the tips of his ears just a shade redder than the rest of him. Dean decides not to say anything and forces himself to relax against the couch as if nothing had happened.
Helpless, Dean throws his hands up. Cas seems to have all the answers. “Feeling a bit like the odd man out here, Cas. I obviously don’t know jack squat about angel babies. Not sure why I’m even needed in this equation.”
“Man, you have a great laugh,” Dean says softly, and Castiel abruptly stops laughing. And Gabe starts.
The boy dances from one foot to the other impatiently until he’s able to take the container into his grabby hands.
Dean cleared his throat. After hearing Castiel’s voice again, he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to find his own. But he wasn’t crying this time, so that was a start.
Smiling bright, Cas gives a gentle squeeze of the flesh through Dean’s pockets. “Oh, it’s real,” he affirms, tugging Dean in for a kiss that makes his heart slam against his ribs.
“Sure. Thanks,” Castiel replies, absentminded. He looks up from his phone a moment later when the sound of the refrigerator door shutting returns him to the present. “Dean says not to worry about picking up Jack’s cake, by the way. He wants to make one.”
Looking up at Dean, Jack halts in his tracks. “Don’t touch!” he warns, poking a finger at his space cadet in training.
he’d realized Cas was the one who was always bringing bagels and coffee into the faculty lounge. That sustenance was the only thing that got Dean going some mornings.
Cas shifts his attention between the two Winchesters, unsure how to interpret their banter as they stare each other down for a few seconds, until Dean eventually cracks into laughter and Sam follows. Dean does drop Cas’s hand at that point and pulls Sam into a firm hug. “I missed you, man.”
Three drinks later, Dean is having the time of his life. Charlie cackles from the other side of the table.
Cas leans over surreptitiously. “There aren’t any prizes,” he whispers and Dean snickers to suppress a shiver at the hot puff of breath on his ear.
—before looking back to Cas. “I had a horribly irresponsible amount of alcohol that night, and my brother Sam and I somehow got into some stupid argument about whether or not hummingbirds have feet. And I mean, honestly, kid’s a fuckin’
“Well, it was quite the sight to see,” Dean teases. “And I know you were embarrassed, but you did great. You shouldn’t doubt yourself so much.” The streetlight reflects the sincerity in those green eyes as he reaches out a playful fist and gently knocks it against Castiel’s shoulder.
“My apologies. Let me make it up to you,” Cas says and turns to the bartender. “Hey, Simon. Can I get two, please?”
Other thoughts tried to seep through, but there wasn’t room for anything else, his mind suffocating on those eight letters. Everything was fuzzy, as if he were the one enveloped in shadow, absorbed by darkness.
“It’s nice to meet you.” Dean gestures back toward his car. “I brought you a few things for your birthday. Do you think you could be my big helper and carry something inside for me?”
The phone slipped through Dean’s hand and landed facedown on the mattress. A choked sob escaped him, but subsequent sniffles were stifled behind hands pressed firmly over his face. “Damnit, Cas!” he cried into his palms.
voice—is deep and sort of rough, and a shiver runs down Castiel’s spine before he can really register what’s happening. “This the— the bird inspector?”
“No, thanks. I prefer the view from down here.” Dean doesn’t need to see him to know Cas is smirking. “I just want to make sure you don’t bust your assets.”
“Okay, got a water here for you and— Who’re you talking to, Dean Bean?” a slightly muffled female voice cuts in. It’s familiar, but Cas can’t quite place it.
Dean realizes he’d seen Cas rubbing his hands together in the periphery when he brought up the tray. “Sorry it’s so cold. Houses as old as this one tend to be a little drafty. Here,” he says, tugging a blanket out of a fabric basket beside the couch and drops it over a grateful Cas. He stops short of wrapping it around the other man and grabs one for himself, sitting on the opposite side of the small sofa. “So, you decide what you’d like to watch?”
The last conscious impression was a pair of strong hands catching him and keeping his head from smacking into the floor.
Cas attempts a scowl, but it’s clear that there’s no power behind it. “Of course not. I’m saying that because it’s true...” Turning mischievous, he bites his lower lip and tugs Dean in by the hips. When the move elicits a groan of pleasure, it’s Cas’s turn to smirk. “...
“I’m so sorry.” Dean leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes. “You deserved better,” he whispered, weak and tired and ashamed.
He took a deep draft from the liquor and leaned his head back against the arm rest, long bow legs kicked over the opposite end. It wasn’t the most comfortable, but he wasn’t in a state to care. It was his birthday and he’d just gotten the news that Rowena—the most powerful witch who’d ever lived and the queen of hell—wasn’t going to be able to help them get Castiel back. Or, more accurately, that she adamantly didn’t think it possible. As she’d pointed out, the Empty held sway over divine beings by right of seniority. There had been a loophole every other time someone had escaped the Empty, and now the Shadow was clued in to their shenanigans. It had closed those loops, something Jack must have known from the start. He should’ve just said so, but at least now Dean could start to forgive the disappearing act.
When the wine and the meal have been distributed, Dean takes a seat. Swirling the water in his cup around a few times, he doesn’t actually lift his own fork until Cas has tried the chicken risotto and given a hum of approval. Satisfied, Dean digs in as Cas sips from his wine glass.
“Aww, his birthday’s soon? How old is he turning?” Dean spins around and leans against the counter behind him, crossing his legs at the ankles and leaning back on his elbows.
A pleased rumble escapes Cas’s throat as he unfastens the folds of denim and peels them away from Dean’s body along with his boxers. With the whole picture revealed, Cas sighs in appreciation.
Dean swallows, chest heating against his best efforts. He wants to tell him that he believes Cas has been doing the impossible long before they met. That he’s the one who makes Dean question his poor self-value every day, makes him feel like he’s more than just his brother’s keeper. That if Cas wants to raise this kid together, the two of them pretending to be fathers instead of just friends, Dean will follow his lead even if it kills him.
Standing at the wall where Castiel had been taken, Dean finished painting an intricate symbol and turned away. With a pang of nervousness coiled in his gut, he moved to watch as Sam added their hard-earned ingredients to a bowl and ground them together with a pestle. They had one shot at this and there were no guarantees that the spell would work. Everything had to be perfect.
“We can play around later. I just don’t want either of you getting stung. The bees can get agitated by sudden movements.” Castiel points to a spot a short distance away from the closest hive. “Hang out right there for a minute.”
Dean takes a clean cloth and uses it to shine up the firearm, removing any remaining debris with a practiced hand.
“What did you do?!” Castiel demanded in that low rumble of his, tensing within Dean’s grasp. Insecurity wormed its way into the warmth of their reunion.
God, it’s been months since Castiel went onto his college’s faculty directory to save Dean Winchester’s number on a whim. When he’d first seen the man at the new faculty and staff mixer the president hosted every year, he’d been struck dumb by green eyes and a flirtatious smirk and
win. But Castiel was gone and Dean had no idea what to do next, despite his determination to rescue the angel.
“Yes.” Cas nods. “But Anna was alive when she severed her ties to the Host. Her essence was reborn in a human body and her grace absorbed within the earth. The angel whose grace now lives in this fledgling made a painful sacrifice so that the forces of Heaven would not diminish. And we have been chosen as guardians.”
“In that case, what would you say to coming by and taste testing it for me? I’ll even make dinner and we can watch a movie you haven’t seen yet. Just name the day.” He groans internally, bracing for rejection or at least an excuse because he’s said too much, too quickly. He must’ve sounded pathetic.
, too. Someday he’ll be brave enough to say those things aloud because Cas deserves to hear them, damn it. But all the pretty words get caught in his throat and what comes out is a whisper.
That catches Gabriel’s attention. He sits up straight and tries to lean over Castiel to catch a glimpse of his phone. Castiel leans away from him and Gabe literally faceplants on the sofa cushion in between them. If Cas wasn’t having an aneurysm, he’d probably be giggling. But as it is, his brain is melting.
Maybe the smartest guy Dean had ever been that close in contact with. Seriously. Sam went on a week-long fanboy exhibition when he found out Dean was going to be at KU with “the most renowned ornithologist of North America and leading researcher in migratory flight patterns of the albatross.”
One club they pass has a queue of people waiting to get in. The thumping bass booming from inside forms enough of a beat that a few pre-gamed partiers are raging right there on the sidewalk. A young woman in a short, tight dress dances suggestive circles around her date. Castiel and Dean sidestep the partiers and continue down the road.
Castiel watches Dean step out looking just as fine as his ride wearing an open olive toned button-up—sleeves rolled to the elbows—over a plain black shirt, dark jeans, and what Castiel can only describe as “combat-casual” boots. He swallows thickly and stands, despite the mild protest he gets from Jack at being removed from the swing. He takes the boy by the hand, leading him to meet their guest under the shade of the old maple.
Regardless of the annoyingly pedantic way his little brother showed affection, he knew Sam was dead-on—about everything—but Dean couldn’t let the kid get a big head to go with the rest of his gargantuan body.
“Your soul shines so brightly that it warms everyone around you and yet you are blind to its light.”
“You once told me you were a ‘wavelength of celestial intent.’ I wish I could’ve seen your true form. At least, without going all Johnny Blaze. I bet you burn brighter than all the stars combined, Cas.” Dean smiled to himself at the idea. “You did for me.”
They walk into the room, Cas carrying a plate of fresh and gooey chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk, and Jack carrying the other two glasses. Another stanza of the song goes by while Cas sets the goodies on the coffee table, but in the next moment, he’s marching over to take Dean by the hand, lifting him from his seat and into a slow-dancing pose.
With another nod, hair falling almost in his eyes, Jack runs off—Dean makes a mental note to bust Cas’s chops about getting the kid to a barbershop soon. He gets up and watches as Jack practically tackles Cas in a bear cub hug, then tugs on his sleeve. “What was that all about?” Cas asks, laughing. He bends down so Jack can put both of his little hands around his ear to relay the message from Dean.
The next day, Dean changes out of his dusty work clothes in favor of a clean shirt and pants before heading back over to the market. He had seen some quaint glass bottles and metal pipe shelves that the Impala previously had no room for with the pressure washing equipment in the trunk, waiting to be returned.
The final photo is of Jack fast asleep cuddled up to Cas, both of them now utilizing the blanket. Gabriel can be seen in the background blowing a kiss from the recliner where he’s finally woken up from his nap. The message that follows the pictures is a simple “
He remembered what it had felt like then, watching Castiel’s body burn and believing that it was truly the last time he would ever see him. All while the son of his murderer was standing right beside them.
They leave the amphitheater behind and head into the heart of the city. The main hub of downtown bustles on a Saturday night with locals, mostly college-aged, flitting between the bars and the movie theater and the restaurants.
On a stepstool, Jack uses a wooden spoon as long as his arm to mix lumps of dough. The flour dusting his once navy blue shirt resembles an impressionist painting of smoke over deep water.
Dean jumps out of his seat, eager. “You’re not all hat and no cattle are ya, Cas? C’mon! This was your idea, remember?”
Thanking the cashier, Dean turns and notices a shop across the way with a large sign proclaiming it to be The Stand of Milk and Honey. He smirks in appreciation of the pun. Wood-carved bumble bee figurines dangle from the sign at random lengths and intervals. Inside, metal shelves lining both sides of the booth are filled with dozens of jars of honey in a variety of flavors as well as homemade beeswax soap, candles, and lip balms. In one corner, a refrigerated display cabinet holds jars of fresh milk.
“So,” Dean says as he plops the holiest of munchkins on the unholiest of bedspreads and settles a wooly blanket around him, “What do we call you, huh?”
The head gardener, Joshua, is a kind dark-skinned man and Dean can’t quite place how these two fair-skinned children are related to him but accepts it readily.
Castiel’s Gram looks up at him with a sparkle in her eyes, “So, dear. I just push this and firefighters will appear?”
Alastair scrambles away, leaving Dean prone on the mud of the riverbank. He lets out several shaky breaths of relief. He will not be raped today. His body trembles and he sits back on his heels. Tilting his head up to look at his savior, he meets the solemn visage of Prince Castiel. The light through the leaves makes shadows dance across his face.
Dean places Folger’s plate next to his at the table. Scooping up the mug and the dragon, he places them down close to him. Folgers crawls out of the mug and digs into his feast, sitting easily on the table. Dean watches his new friend devour his breakfast with zeal. The little guy must have been hungry for quite some time.
Dean rolls his eyes, pressing up against his wiry mate, boxing him in against the shower wall. “You’re an ass.”
“Dean, my keeper - it is our destiny to fly together but I need to understand your concerns, your fear. I need to hear them now before I transform, and maybe we can address them.”
Dean and Cas look at each other, Dean is red faced and shaking with anger at the gendered slurs aimed at both himself and his mate. Dean can feel the whole diner look at him, he hears parts of slurs but mostly he hears “Omega” over and over and it makes him livid.
Dean wipes his hands on an oily rag and leans his butt against the front quarter panel. He feels apprehension about talking to Bobby… but Bobby is Bobby. He’s not going to laugh at Dean or make him feel stupid.
Every night, illuminated only by an old teddy bear nightlight, Mary Winchester would curl in bed with her sons, Sam and Dean, and tell them the most fantastical tales. Stories of elves, gnomes, fae, dwarves, wizards, and sometimes even dragons. With a hushed voice, she would send her boys off to sleep dreaming of magic and monsters. Dean loved all of his mother’s stories, but he really loved the tales about dragons.
Dean smiles at his mate, his sappy sweet Alpha. Cas is sitting on the floor next to the tub, the pads of his fingers tracing an invisible line from one freckle to the another absentmindedly. With his head perched in one his hands on the side of the tub, Dean lets his mate muddle through his thoughts. Dean looks unabashedly at his handsome Alpha, Castiel’s wild hair is peppered with gray and his stunning blue eyes are lined. He’s aged so handsomely and it’s hard to believe that this strong patriarch Alpha is the same nerdy Castiel that stumbled over his words and could not put a sentence together when they first met. All gangly, body not quite done growing with long limbs and his heart worn on his sleeve.
Castiel is then even further flummoxed when she turns to her guest and he hears her ask him on a date.
“I love you, my Omega,” Cas breathes as they come up for air. “I love you, I always need you and I will never again neglect you.”
Dean had trailed his fingers down the wings in the inky black of night, they had felt like the finest kid leather. Smooth yet strong as they arched under his touch. The tail seemed to be an extension of the man’s spine, strong, flexible and muscular with a pointed tip, it seemed to chase the warmth of Dean’s hand as he caressed it gently and let it run through his hands.
Castiel wraps himself around his keeper, trying to project reassurance and calm. He feels Dean relax within his grasp and pulls back to look him in the eye.
“I’ll take care of Claire’s bedtime,” Castiel states, plating Dean food and his hands petting his partner’s shoulders, “How are you feeling?”
“We are going to be late for your mother’s,” Cas finally mentions, fingers wiggling now they are warm. Dean grunts, passing along the cream sweater and winter things to him. Cas dutifully pulls them on, looking adorable and snuggly. The Pom-pom on his head and multicolored scarf around his neck only adding to his youthfulness. He bundles Cas in the car, earning a goofy smile from his dragon, one of Dean’s throw blankets is a permanent fixture in his Baby against the cool leather.
“No,” Dean answers and swallows thickly. No, he hasn’t thought about his father at all. He’s just been thinking about his Alpha and what he wants in life. His Dad… his Dad tries to be a good man but he’s broken. He’s barely held it together for Dean and Sam, the death of their mother wrecked the aging Alpha. Dean’s always taken care of his father. He stayed home, he cooks and cleans as any Omega should… he raised Sammy. Now… now smelling his Alpha, he wants more to his life. He wants a mate that he thought he’d never get.
Rolling his lips between his teeth, Dean clears his throat and tries to wrap his mind around the situation. He decides to use a phrase that Sam is fond of using with Jack, “Do you want me to just listen or would like me to listen to you and offer advice?”
He also knows that if you’re on your way into town or out - Blue Bar and Grill is the place to stop for news, for a meal or just to put off going home.
“Let's go,” Castiel whispers, leading Dean naked through the quiet halls into his bedroom. The air is cold, the two men move silently and avoid the servants that are putting the large manor to sleep.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Castiel hisses out, teeth mashed together at the offending figure in the middle of their field.
The pair are busy packing up tools for the day. Well, Cas is done, and he is ‘helping’ his keeper finish up.
Grumbling, Castiel agrees. He’s quiet on the car ride home. The engine of Baby loud between them. Dean doesn’t bother putting on music, reading Castiel’s mood as too pensive to enjoy the amazing talent of Robert Plant. The horde in his pocket jingling with every turn of his hand.
With one last swipe of his tongue, Castiel sort of does as his Omega requested. Fingers playing, he runs his fingers through the slick escaping to smear down Dean’s balls and over his cock. He jacks Dean, reaching around him, with his own slick. He doesn’t penetrate Dean, reserving that right for his cock and knot.
Dean softly hums, pressing a kiss above Cas’ heart. A well of emotion rises in the back of his throat, fondness, and affection overwhelm him. He creates a little space, just so he can breathe and think. Unperturbed, Castiel takes the chance for his hands to roam down Dean’s body.
Dick first, Dean carves his way through the crowd - swimmers being knocked left, right and centre by the magnificent man meat that precedes Dean through the water. His engorged flesh flute pokes Cas in the eye, before Dean can control it. The giant purple glans nudging fondly at Cas’ face, seeking entry.
Castiel shakes his head sadly and leaves the room, the door closing with a thunk that sounds very final to Dean’s ears.
Disrobing eagerly, Dean shucks his clothes to the corner and blankets Jo’s body. He can feel the slick pooling, but he ignores it, maybe later they’ll be able to satisfy that deep ache inside of him but for right now he needs to take care of his new mate. Pulling down her pants and then her sweatshirt. Dean goes to capture her lips again and then stops… that mate smell is completely gone. Like a bucket of cold water has been splashed in his face, Dean feels a little nauseous from the whiplash. A whine starts up in his throat and so he scoots back and sits back on his haunches, he scents her… she’s still an Alpha but she smells like sharp metal and old books.
“Cas, please love, Alpha, I want your cock, your knot, please.” Dean pants and tries to turn to look. His Alpha gives one final sweet lick, hands traveling down the expanse of Dean’s back. Cas kisses where can reach and nuzzles into Dean’s neck, little kitten licks at the mating gland.
As the last dregs of his coffee are emptied onto his tongue, music starts to play from the wireless speaker on the side table. Cas must have connected to it with his phone. What Dean assumes are flutes and xylophones play a plucky holiday melody to which Cas’s voice comes warbling up the stairs in accompaniment.
Cas does the squinty thing. “Dean, are you sure this is safe to consume? I wasn’t aware sustenance could feel emotion.”
A light flicks on inside and music starts blasting so loud the lyrics can almost be understood clearly from the sidewalk. Dean appears, his back to the window, with a broomstick in his hand. He sways his hips side to side and bobs his head to the song while he sweeps, oblivious to being observed.
“Yes. I told you he’s opening that new bakery soon, remember?” Castiel digs around for a plate and some utensils which he clinks down beside the dessert. “Here’s your babysitting payment.”
“I’m just as uncertain about this situation as you. Perhaps, even more so. In all my eons, I’ve never been asked to do something like this. I’ve led soldiers and watched brothers die, some at my own blade. I’ve been tortured. I’ve been killed and brought back. And yet, this—” His expression pained, Cas gestures between Dean and the window where Chaz (probably) dreams beyond the drawn blinds. His eyes slide up to Dean’s and the moonlight shines off of them like a calm lake at midnight, but the set of them betrays an inner uneasiness. “—scares me more than anything.”
Dean has to squint as he powers on his phone and then he almost pukes again. The brightness of the screen in the darkened room is bad enough for his nausea, but it’s the sinking feeling he gets in his gut when he sees his call log that really does him in.
Cas slides back onto the bed, planting each muscled thigh, toned from so many trips cycling to and from the farmer’s market, on either side of Dean’s legs. Propped up on his elbows, Dean meets Cas and his slicked mouth halfway in another kiss, slower and more passionate, reaching down as their bodies slot together to take both of them into his uninjured hand.
“Alright, Red. But if I see any of my students there, I’m bailing,” he warns, passing the device back to its owner.
A couple of squad cars pull in then, and the officers meet Dean on the front porch where he gives them all of the meager details he has. After they conduct their own sweep of the place, they tell him to document the damages and contact his insurance company with photographs and leave him with a copy of the police report.
Black ambrosia fills Dean’s favorite mug—a birthday present from Cas last year, covered in Zepp song quotes. Dean winks at Jack who sneaks a handful of chocolate into his mouth while Cas is distracted.
Time and again, everything Dean thought he knew had been upended and cast into doubt. But one thing remained certain: he would defeat Chuck and bring back Castiel and all the rest, or he would die trying.
Something unintelligible grumbles from Cas’s mouth as he rolls over, draping an arm around his two bed companions. Dean reaches over and completes the circuit, creating a cuddle bubble for Jack to feel safe, and the three of them quickly drift back into a peaceful slumber.
“Did you just fall out of the bed?” He asks, momentary bemusement drowning out his alarm. Charlie opens her mouth to respond and everything comes rushing back in. “Wait, shut up, that’s not the issue—“
“I wonder how it would’ve been. Us, I mean. If we had been together all this time. After twelve years of dancing around each other like idiots, you’d think six months wouldn’t be such a big deal but
“Dean, I think maybe you should go now,” Castiel says, reaching for his phone. The man has obviously had quite a bit to drink, and even though Dean is the one who called
When Castiel looks up, he freezes for half a second and Dean almost swears there’s a flush on the other man’s cheeks. He clears his throat as Dean walks fully into the stall and up to the counter.
“I know that look. What’s on your mind, honeypie?” Cas asks, drawing Dean into his arms after a quick peck on the lips. He’d taken to calling him that after their honey apple pie had won first place in the county fair.
Castiel observes the scene with a contented smile. “Oh, yes. The ladies love the daisies.” At Dean’s raised eyebrow, Castiel explains, “All worker bees, the ones who gather the pollen, are female. And, they prefer blue or purple flowers, so that’s why I’ve planted those asters there.”
Cas is out of tune and hamming it up in front of Jack, but Dean grins like a lunatic while being pranced around the table by his dance partner. He watches the joy radiating from this man in his arms and knows he’ll never find another love like this as long as he lives. And that he’s never letting go.
He’s been pacing for five minutes and has already received more than seven odd looks from students and coworkers. Yes. He’s counting.
Castiel sets the pie in the middle of the table and smacks Gabriel’s feet away. “The table is where we eat, not where we feet,” he says like he’s talking to the toddler in the house instead of his older brother. “And what do you mean early? It’s nearly eleven.”
And directly in front of Cas and Dean, the announcer from earlier sits with one ankle balanced on the opposite knee, watching as people continue filing into the rows of seats. He spots Cas and grins, waving with the microphone. Cas gives him a small wave in return.
“Oh, yeah?” His hands too full to wave, Dean gives the ‘sup bro’ nod in Gabriel’s direction. Gabriel waggles his eyebrows in response and Dean almost chokes on his burger. “He seems...friendly.”
“Thanks. Actually, I do have a question. What’s your best-selling honey?” he asks, alternately raising and lowering two different jars in his hands as if weighing his options.
Castiel glances at the shelves, considering. “My best seller, part of another best seller? I like the sound of that.”
He was all over the place with the recap at this point, and was far out of ‘just the facts’ territory. But it didn’t matter. It wasn’t like Cas was actually going to hear this message. Even if they could find a way to get him back, Dean planned to cancel the cellular plan and disable the line so that his messages could stay locked away where they belonged. Sam had suggested Dean try journaling, but this was as close as he was gonna get.
Sounds of a scuffle cause Dean to place a protective arm in front of Castiel’s handlebars, stopping him. A repetitive skidding noise, like boots kicking the ground, is muffled by someone talking in a low murmur. There is a pause followed by a thump and a grunt of pain. Then another. And another.
“Alright, yeah. Why does he look mostly human? I thought angels had to have a vessel, and it ain’t like a toddler can consent.”
“What? You?” Dean blurts, incredulous. He can’t fathom what someone as mellow as Cas could have done to deserve such treatment.
Dean rocks on his heels and alternates patting the sides of his legs in anticipation as he waits for Cas to take a bite. Cas grins at the eager expression on Dean’s face, a teasing look sneaking its way into the corner of his eyes.
Cas grabs the back of his neck and pulls him in for another kiss. When he pulls back, he leans his forehead against Dean’s and whispers, “¿Por que no los dos?”
They’d spent the first part of the movie reluctant to speak, but the moment Harrison Ford appeared on screen, Dean had been too excited to keep from quoting
A couple moments later, he hears a thump from the bedroom and then a very long, low groan. Then Charlie is crawling into the living room with Dean’s comforter bundled around her. She collapses on the carpet and glares up at him from the opening in her cocoon.
All at once, Cas leans in and Dean moves his hand from his cheek to wrap around the back of Cas’s neck, mouths colliding like the tide meeting the shore, a force of nature simultaneously chaotic and assured.
Dean settled into his bed a little further, wincing at some bruises that had blossomed around his ribs.
or something by his thoughts. But he still wants to curl into a ball on his bed, hide under his comforter, and just never move again. But he
“Cheers to that,” Dean says with a gentle smile, figuring Cas might appreciate a change of topic. He tips his glass toward Cas, then tilts it back and into his mouth. The blackberry and honey flavors mingle palatably, sort of like a boozy pie drink. “Huh. M’not normally a wine drinker—and I’ll be damned if you catch me admitting it to anyone else—but this is nice.”
Cas’s hand covers Dean’s so fast, it must have been a gut reaction, but he’s gripping his fingers like Dean’s a spooked animal ready to bolt. “
“Shoo, Nougat,” Castiel admonishes the cat as he nudges him down from where he’d tried to perch on the table. “Alright, one fancy sunshine pancake for the light in my life,” he says as he puts the plate and a fork in front of Jack who is now bouncing in his seat, both legs kicking in excitement.
Castiel rubs a palm over his cheek. “I don’t know. Do you think I’m overreacting? Maybe I should try calling him.” He lifts the phone he’s been holding with a death grip in the hopes that Dean would respond and explain himself. The last message he sent almost an hour ago (“
“And how about in an apple pie?” Dean raises his brows, eyes bright. He already has an opinion, but wants to hear it confirmed anyway. Besides, the solemn reservation behind the gritty timbre of the other man’s voice sparks Dean’s curiosity.
They’ve barely touched, both so cautious with one other as their years of carefully crafted restraint shatters. Dean doesn’t even realize he’s closed his eyes until his mental processor catches up and he notices his mouth is no longer pressed to Cas. He blinks, finding Cas just a few inches away, hesitant hopefulness marking his brows.
“Well, space racism was a real problem during the Empire. You’d think the rebels would have been more inclusive, but we can only hope the galaxy far, far away has made progress from where they were a long time ago.”
“Hello, Dean.” Something about the way he says his name makes the back of Dean’s ears tingle. “Nice to meet you. I’m Castiel.” He grips Dean’s palm tight and gives a warm shake.
Finally, the puttering sound of Cas’s truck reaches Dean before he can make out the dim headlights diffused by snowfall. Cas runs from the driver’s side to the passenger door and hurries to extract the kindergartner from his seat, ushering him toward the shopfront. Dean smiles brightly at them as they fight their way inside, angling in to kiss Cas on his cold pink nose and shutting the door behind them. Poor Jack is so bundled up in his puffy white coat that he resembles a tiny marshmallow, and moves about as well as one.
On Jack’s plate, he puts one large pancake in the center and breaks a smaller one in half to use as ears on either side of the first. Sliced strawberries form a sun shape around the outside. Two banana slices become eyes and Castiel adds two chocolate chips for pupils. With syrup, he draws a smile.
“He wants you to know he’s thankful for you watching out for him,” Cas says from the far side of the bed. He’s smiling again, and Dean is suddenly overwhelmed at how right this moment feels.
Cas looks up, sky blues downright stormy as he takes note of Dean’s concern. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to bring down the mood.”
It’s been two years since the opening of Dean’s bakery. He has a regular client base, a few local awards hanging on his wall, and a level of contentment he never thought he’d see in his life. He’s immensely grateful for all of the opportunities that have been afforded to him.
Castiel looked conflicted but remained speechless, eyes roaming anywhere but on Dean. In the background, Sam shifted the weight on his feet but held a respectful silence.
In the past, Dean had been with guys who thought they were hot stuff before and assumed Cas was maybe playing up the size of his equipment or maybe he was alluding to a shady past. Dean hadn’t been worried though. He had long come to terms with his relationship with God and his own personal needs.
Dean considered this for a minute and then leaned in to place his palm against Castiel’s rough cheek. He had gazed at those crystalline blue eyes and had felt the arousal sparking between them, Dean made up his mind in that moment.
“If they are going to fall into bed like a horrible romance novel… can I hang out in your dorm?” Gabriel asks Sam, fingers strumming over the microwave.
Dean lays his towel on a spare seat and Cas follows suit. The boys flick off their flip flops and leave sunglasses and phones carefully out of sight.
“Yeah, yeah. You’re welcome. Now you aren’t all angry for your meeting. I’m going to hop in after you leave,” Dean says and kisses him, “Hopefully the kids stay sleeping.”
Dean doesn’t know how this particular fight escalated, but it has, and Cas using his Alpha voice to state,
Letting out a laugh, Dean puts the Impala in drive and they make their way to the shop. “No lady dragons start your fire?”
Pausing, Castiel runs a hand down Dean’s arm that is touching him intimately, “I’ve never gone farther than this with a man, I wouldn’t want to hurt you.”
“I’m going to make dinner,” he whispers to Dean and kisses him again. In the darkness, he can see Dean nod and sniff wetly again.
Jack accepts him easily, holding Dean’s dirty hand while they walk down to the river, chatting about different things. Horses, bugs, his cat that he wants to bring into the house but Nanny won’t let him, and his boring history lessons. Claire just sits there stoically, glaring at Dean with angry eyes. Familiar diamond blue eyes.
Sluggishly, Dean’s brain slowly makes his way out of the fog of pleasure and comes to life realizing there is a person tucked up against him. Dean swears he went to bed with Folgers and only Folgers. Dean is frozen with fear as the man stirs awake, his nose nuzzling Dean’s throat and his lips placing an open- mouthed kiss to Dean’s clavicle. The man’s eyes are still closed and he lets out a soft sigh of pleasure after he tastes Dean’s skin.
“Yes, yes, knot me, please,” Dean cries, feeling blissful from his orgasm. His Alpha bottoms out, thighs shaking and moaning so deeply and loudly Dean can only smile at Cas’ pure bliss.
“Let’s make that sandwich, huh?” Dean states. Folgers crawls up his arm to rest on his shoulder, his hot breath tickling Dean’s neck. It’s comforting and he pets the dragon, his fingers dragging against the warm scales as he puts together their lunch.
Feeling a little self-conscious, Dean follows Cas into the shower. His mate shampoos his hair while humming to Dean’s music on his phone. At a very compelling part of the song, Cas even does a silly little dance for Dean, swaying his hips to make his floppy penis dance purposefully and Dean laughs at the absurdity of his mate’s antics.
Dean’s hand is gliding over his dick, teasing his knot, and pressing more slick into his skin. Dean’s quick hand focuses on the underside of their cock heads, hand tight and just right. It’s not long until Castiel is coming, the aftershocks making him shiver against his mate. Dean uses his t-shirt to catch Castiel’s release but continues to kiss Cas while stroking his own erection until he comes too. Head tilted back, lips parted, Castiel watches his mate come undone. So beautiful, his mate, the mother of his children...
“They are known to hop down and steal food, so let’s pass on the picnic,” Dean laughs, “But we can get lunch afterwards?”
“I’ll teach you,” Dean says, fixing Castiel’s scarf to be tighter around his neck. What he can see of Castiel’s face is bright pink from the cold. He pulls down Castiel’s beanie to cover his ears.
Unwilling to part from him, Dean is quick to grab Cas’ hand, leading them to the bedroom and onto the bed. Castiel wraps himself around Dean, letting out a big sigh of relief that causes Dean to smile. Pressed skin to skin, on their bed, Dean feels finally content. Since they’ve been in Florida, Dean’s has always gone to bed first, alone, and it’s been forever since they’ve gone to bed together.
“This,” Dean holds out the garment under Sam’s nose and his brother’s face wrinkles in disgust, “This is my Alpha. Not Jo. Him.”
As Dean runs his hand further and further down the Alpha’s back to the swell of his ass, he palms the flesh there, enjoying the smooth roundedness under his palm. As they enjoy each other’s bodies and take comfort in the physical closeness, Dean notices that Castiel’s scent is changing from warm and comfortable smell of forests to a headier scent more reminiscent of a rich rainforest. It’s the scent of aroused Alpha, and Dean cannot get enough. After the famine, it’s a feast as he clutches his mate and tentatively moves to join their lips in a kiss that is both apology and a promise of things to come.
Horrified, Dean watches the two dragons fight. It’s a tangle of limbs, wings, and snapping jaws. Castiel roars and bites everywhere he can reach. Bartholomew is a bigger dragon, but Castiel is quick… his jaw and claws like lightning striking against the other man. Setting up his gun, Dean waits patiently for an opening.
“Seriously!! I don’t know how this works. What’s going to be more comfortable for you, it’s hell of a long trip,” Dean exclaims, throwing up his hands and gesturing to all of Castiel.
Dean practically falls off the ladder, spooked out of his skin by the commanding tone of the woman’s voice. Castiel steadies him as he shimmies down the ladder and they both turn to meet the icy blue eyes of a woman in a blue power suit complete with shoulder pads and a nipped in waist.
“I wanted to see you,” Dean mumbles into the meat of his own arm, “I never get to see you without the kids. I miss you.”
Dean and Castiel venture out to the field behind his house after breakfast to begin getting used to flying together. Thankfully, Dean’s ranch house is nestled on the edge of a good sized woods, farming fields, and his own large green lawn situated to the south between the house and the trees. It’s secluded, private, and he had picked this house so he can clang around on his car restorations at home. Dean thanks all the powers that be that there is a private place for his first flight with Cas. At least the first flight where he wasn’t hypothermic and semi conscious.
“Come Omega,” he growls once his knot catches his tight rim. With a harsh gasp, Dean comes untouched over Castiel’s stomach. His Alpha howls in satisfaction and slams his knot, tying them together and coming deep inside his now pliant Omega. He lets out a shout himself, reveling in the feeling of Dean’s muscles clenching so tightly around him.
Dean continues his nightly routine flicking lights off as he goes. Something in the very corner of his eye catches his attention and draws his gaze to one of the pieces of artwork on the wall above the kitchen hatch. It’s an interesting piece. A collage of found items arranged in such a way that it is a perfect representation of enormous night dark wings. As Dean studies the picture the wings seem to ripple and shimmer, and Dean frowns, a wrinkle appearing between his brows.
“I’ve missed this, Dean, I almost believe we should start scheduling sex,” Cas comments against Dean’s lips.
The dragon stays in the coffee cup through the morning, alternately napping and watching Dean go about his Saturday chores. Folgers watches with bright-eyed interest as Dean takes his clothes to the laundry room and sorts them into the machine. Dean tilts his head back and laughs at the startled jump the dragon gives when the washing machine begins the first spin cycle. Dean’s glad he didn’t leave the dragon in what is fast becoming his coffee cup on the top of the machine.
“I’ll start then,” Castiel clears his throat, “It is believed by dragons that a true bonding under the Northern Lights will be blessed with endless love and passion that will carry on even into the afterlife. Upon entering Valhalla, a dragon and its rider become a torch of light in the sky. These Northern Lights are our ancestors and like the ones who have walked before us, we enter this bond knowing that we will serve as a guardian to all.”
They sit in silence, enjoying the sky darkening and waiting for it to light up the wavering blue green. The light dances across the sky, entrancing and so beautiful. Dean watches the waves dance and flicker, mesmerized. Ethereal, magical, light fills them both up.
“Let’s shower, Cas… I can still feel that damn cheap champagne all over my skin. Come wash it off with me. I’ll even wash your hair for you.”
Castiel never broke eye contact as he reached down to tug his tee-shirt over his head revealing a firmly muscled chest and strong shoulders. From behind him, in the shadows, Dean could see two airy shapes hovering.
Dean looks back at Castiel incredulously until both let out peals of laughter, both uncaring that kids can hear their laughter.
Letting out a wavering breath, Dean removes his own clothing with haste, his hands trembling over buttons and ties. Dean’s eyes and hands follow, taking in the details of the Prince, his golden skin, the sparse hairs that spread across his chest, and trail down to his hard erection. His tip exposed and weeping, balls nestled tight against his body. Dean swallows audibly, mouth-watering and thinking of taking Castiel into his mouth.
“That’s very good, very smart. There are lots of students enrolled on campus,” Castiel states, running his hands down Dean’s arms, “You are so strong.” He looks amazed, his fingers feeling Dean’s muscles flex. His fingertips running over the fine hairs and freckles.
And today, Sammy will most likely die. Dean’s heart clutches painfully in his chest, and he breaks out in a cold sweat. He fears death, who doesn’t? But he fears his brother’s death most of all.
Dean needs to be pinched because he can hardly believe it. The Alpha underneath him, little Jo Harvelle of all people, smells like a dream come freakin’ true. Smelling like the soft earth of a forest floor and fresh-cut cedar and it’s filling his senses and making his mouth salivate. Kissing her has his inner Omega chanting ‘
“The more you move, the longer we have to wait for pie,” Castiel half-heartedly scolds, holding his mate’s hips still. He’s not complaining, it feels really fucking good to come multiple times.
Dean feels the slow descent of Castiel’s body, getting closer to the treetops in the Aurora circle. The light in the sky shifts colors as the sun makes its slow journey to the horizon and dips below. It’s romantic, the sky takes a pink hue and Dean hopes the whole experience will turn into a romantic getaway, he’s booked a cabin at one of the local lodges in Yellowknife for their exclusive use once the bonding ceremony is complete.
That’s what he wants this morning. A huge pot of coffee and for the department head to go fuck herself. He’d never say it out loud, but in the secret recesses of Castiel’s mind, he believes he can be honest with himself about his deep unbridled hatred for the woman. Cas would never even dare tell his mate how much he hates the woman. Dean would go into over-protective Omega mode and ask him to quit and find a different job. His mate is wonderful like that, but they really need the money.
“Flip,” Castiel commands and Dean obeys. His mate covers him with his own strong body. Boxing him in as he captures Dean’s hands and anchors them above Dean’s head. Kissing him deeply, Cas lets go and massages Dean’s arms and then neck, trailing his hands down his abdomen. Dean can’t stop his hips from undulating up to meet Cas’ growing arousal. Rocking together, clothes be damned, they are both fully hard and Dean is ready for his lover. The door is locked and it’s not like the kids can hear anything over Ben’s drumming.
Dean hears the Angel calling, and desperately looks around for a pool noodle, or some kind of flotation device.
With a little grin and a coy look, the man kisses Dean’s shoulder, “You have nothing to be embarrassed about Dean, you are beyond beautiful in your pleasure.”
“Turn over, my love. Let me take care of you for a change,” Cas whispers against Dean’s lips. With that, Dean is almost comical as he scrambles to change position. Lying on his front, he grabs one of their pillows to cant his hips up as Castiel settles warm and close between his legs. Big hands move down his back, massaging muscles and running over skin.
A loud and boorish voice intrudes on their moment, as an Alpha that stinks of metal and drains pushes roughly past their table.
“Now Dean,” she would whisper, “If you are ever to come across a dragon you must tickle underneath his chin.” She would always tickle him, eliciting raucous giggles from Dean. “But most importantly, treat him with kindness and respect. In turn, he will also treat you with respect and kindness.”
Eventually, the two of them are watching some sort of princess show before bed when Dean finally emerges from upstairs, dressed in one of Castiel’s baggy Stanford sweatshirts.
After sweeping out the entryway, Dean whistles as he grabs the furniture polish and a soft cloth from a tall cupboard in the corner. He is almost dancing as he runs the cloth, damp with beeswax smelling polish across the well-worn wood of the ornately carved pews. He piles hymn books neatly at the end of each row as he passes through each from aisle to nave.
Castiel shimmies out and launches himself at the pile of thick winter clothing Dean has laid out for him, making Dean laugh as a burst of blue light fills the tent. Castiel, the man, glowers at him while he’s pulling on the thick winter gear.
Blinking once more, he realizes that no, the dragon is still there and he’s very much real. He very slowly places the mug into the morning sun on the counter and the dragon rolls onto it’s back to reveal its lighter underbelly and chin. Hesitantly, he remembers the advice his mother would tease before bed. With his pointer finger, shakily he rubs underneath the dragon’s chin. A quick brush and he jerks his hand back. The dragon slowly cracks his eyes open, looking pleased as can be and wiggles in the cup, Dean recognizes it as the universal sign of wanting more chin scratches. With a little more confidence, Dean crooks his finger and scratches the dragon one more time.
“Much.” Dean scents his neck and even nibbles at his old mating gland, “Can we warm it back up in the oven? I think we have vanilla ice cream?”
The night starts with drinks on the back porch, Cas fills both of their tumblers generously with their favorite whiskey. His mate is snuggled up to him on the porch swing they built, enjoying the cool spring air. Cas is pressed fully against Dean, unconsciously petting Dean’s hair and neck. He smells like happy Alpha and it makes Dean dizzy with the simple pleasure of being close to Cas. The whiskey and Cas’ deep voice talking about his recent publication further relaxes Dean. Dean’s a sucker for that rumbly deep voice, he knows he has a dopey soft look on his face just listening to his mate talk about flight patterns of bees.
They had ended up sharing a pitcher of IPA and laughing. The conversation had been easy, with Castiel matching Dean’s flirtations with ribald suggestions, and veiled hints that he was more than he seemed to be.
Dean hums, waiting patiently for Castiel to continue. Dean leans against the Impala, arms crossed, and watches as Castiel lets out a big sigh, “It’s mating season.”
“You boys will do just fine,” She clears her throat and in a much more matter of fact tone exclaims, “Dinner’s getting cold - let’s eat!”
“My pleasure, Cas" Dean grits out between clenched teeth, the friction of his Angel’s hands and arms grasping and massaging his mammoth manhood is pleasurable beyond belief. It is all he can do to remain upright and flexed, when all he wants to do is drill his prodigious pleasure pump into the warm and welcoming wetness of his Angels’ body.
Dean’s next task is throwing out the drooping flower arrangements from the previous week – he hums as he pulls each stem carefully from the great vases and places them in a basket. Even dead flowers are treated with respect here – Dean will make sure that they are taken to the compost heap in his vegetable garden where they can continue to be useful to the earth and its bounty.
Juggling his work bag and the groceries, Castiel fights to open the door to his home and regrets the decision instantly.
Locked together, Castiel guides them to their sides. Curled around his mate, Castiel nuzzles the old mating bite, licking and nipping at it. Skin cooling, Dean shimmies a throw blanket over the both of them, humming with pleasure. Snuggled into his mate, his focus on their mixed scents and the rise and fall of Cas’ chest against his.
Castiel snagged his jacket from the back of a chair and slung it over one shoulder. He gestures with the other hand as he says,  “I’ll follow you.”
“How about no,” Dean laughs, but they turn into soft moans when Cas’ fingertips delve into his waiting hole. With hooded eyes, he watches Cas stretch and play with his slick. Running his fingers through the slick, up to his balls and around his member and then back down gathering more slick as he goes. Its maddening, but Cas likes to play and savour and he never rushes sex. Ever since they were mated in their early twenties, Cas revels in breaking Dean apart and putting him back together.
Letting out pleased noises, the dragon flicks its tail back and forth while Dean runs his finger along the smooth planes of the scales. He’s hot to the touch and not slimy like many people think imaginary dragons are. Dean can’t believe his mother was right! She had always said that dragons and other mythical creatures were not just figments of a vivid imagination, that there were too many stories, from too many places in the world that consistently referred to dragons and other faerie creatures. Mary swore that she had once seen a dragon flying in the distance on the heels of a great thunderstorm. Dean now fully believes her stories.
“Thank fuck we are in the shower,” Dean pants, feeling a little lethargic in his orgasmic glow. He relaxes against Castiel, closing his eyes and letting the water beat against his skin.
“Y-yes,” Castiel brokenly moans and adds breathily, “Everything we do always feels good to me, my sweet Omega.”
“Well, I was hoping to join you in the shower… but you got out too quick,” Dean replies leaning into Castiel’s hand.
Gathering up a washcloth and soap, Castiel works a slow methodical lather into Dean’s skin. He makes sure he uses the right pressure not to tickle Dean and when he washes Dean’s sex, he’s clinical. His mate lets out a little needy moan when the back of his hand brushes his cock.
,” Cas exhales, full of wonder, as he pets Dean’s arms and kisses everything within reach. Dean kisses and nuzzles, his messy hand slipping between them and stroking his own cock. Castiel watches enraptured with the flex and roll of Dean’s body, fingers nimble against over his flesh and playing with Dean’s nipples. He touches the valley of Dean’s ass while Dean pumps into his own fist coated with Castiel’s emission. It feels so good to be touched there.
“Cas, I believe, you. You’re making Bobby here uncomfortable,” Dean laughs awkwardly, smoothing back Castiel’s hair and placing a kiss in the middle of his forehead.
Michael, skin like dark chocolate and eyes that practically melt into Dean holds his hand out for the sweatshirt. He’s the first Alpha to request it and Dean’s reluctant to let it go, but this Alpha… he screams dominance and his nonverbal request brokers no dispute. Dean’s just a little intimated. Michael sniffs the sweatshirt lightly and looks at Dean like he wants to devour the Omega. The Alpha red practically shining through. He holds it out for Lucifer who exaggerates his scenting and waggles his eyebrows at Sam.
Dean also likes them tall, dark, and handsome – but he tries to keep his liaisons separate from his work here at the Church.
Dean’s pleas are broken, his legs drop open even more. His body hungering for more. Castiel watches through his eyelashes, his face intent and focused on only Dean’s pleasure. Sucking, swirling, and flicking that delicious tongue over his cock. Sucking him down with an amazing amount of pressure, his cheeks hollowing to beautiful crescents. The room already is heavy with the scent of sex. Castiel’s high cheeks are tinged with pink and the little Dean can see, his chest ruddy and a little blotchy.
There is only another guard with the Prince, they travel alone and Dean thinks in that moment that he could get away from them and go back to Sam.
Truly, there is no stopping Castiel, his hips falter for a second upon seeing their children but then he’s curling around Dean coming with his knot locking into Dean’s channel triggering his own orgasm which splashes white against the immaculate black finish of the Impala.
Dean turns to hand Castiel a shirt, bumping into the naked man. Blushing, Dean can’t stop his eyes from wandering. He takes in the broad shoulders, the tapering of Castiel’s waist, and then down past those sharp hip bones. Dean’s eyes follow the dark happy trail that leads to one of the biggest cocks he’s ever had the pleasure of viewing in person. His dragon is hung, uncut, with trim dark hair. Dean looks away quickly, feeling the stirring of arousal in his own groin. He squashes it before it gets out of hand. Clearing his throat he looks up at Castiel, who is looking at him steadily with one eyebrow cocked in an authoritative manner.
“Cas-” Dean starts and Castiel shushes him, kissing his head again. Nuzzling his temple and hair, Castiel’s fingers run down his neck and over his shoulder. His hand rests over Dean’s heart.
Dean nods agreeing and decides to let out some of the burdens and worry and share them with his mate, “I need you to help around the house more, you need to do your own laundry, and I need a break from cooking. Every now and then we need to get Chinese or pizza or something to give me a break.”
Snarling, Dean jerks his face out of Castiel’s grasp. Castiel lets out a soft “hmmm” and they are moving again. Dean stumbling along behind his own horse.
“Can’t keep calling you dragon if you are going to chow down on my bacon with me,” Dean comments, clicking the tongs to flip the greasy bacon, “Calling you Coffee Dragon is kinda stupid. But I like the idea... I mean you are camped out in my favorite mug. I only put the best coffee in that mug. Best part of waking up.”
“Of course, I’ll stay, Dean,” Castiel answers, pulling him into a hug. Arm tight around Dean’s neck, he murmurs, “I love you, too.”
” he murmurs mindlessly, his undulating up into Dean’s waiting mouth. Dean wets his fingers again, he’s dripping and it’s easier to use his own lubricant instead of grappling with the lube bottle. He circles his fingers around his mate’s hole once again, feeling the muscle tighten.
Wadding up his boxers, then his socks, he hurls them across the room. They zip by Cas’ body and his mate watches them fall beside him. He’s now hungover, nude, and furious. Grinding his teeth, “Happy? I’m naked now.”
Dean’s purple headed yoghurt flinger begins to come to life under the ministrations of his clever fingers. He wishes it was Cas caressing the kielbasa, instead of his own lonely hand jacking the beanstalk, but thoughts of the angel had his love muscle lurching to life, and soon enough he had to free his one eyed trouser snake from the constricting confines of his speedos, and allow it to float freely in the sparkling waters.
“Good thing for you, I’d hate for you to lose your dick,” Dean teases, pulling on Castiel’s hips playfully.
“Maybe this will help explain,” Bobby says, flipping a large thin book open and sliding it towards Dean/ the smell of old foxed paper fills Dean’s senses over the stew and bread coming from the kitchen. Aging ink dating all the way back to the fifteenth century, fading in curling English and another language Dean doesn’t recognize. Campbell, Winchester, and Singer names line the pages. The families intertwine along with the obscure language.
Castiel feels so much love and pride for his keeper in that moment, unable to contain his emotions he grabs Dean’s face and kisses him quickly. Letting Dean go, Castiel steps back and shifts into the magnificent dragon the size of a large plane. His large body takes up the space of Dean’s entire backyard and the surrounding field. Dean finds himself being nudged by a large triangular dragon head, as blue eyes the size of basketballs capture him in their depths.The dragon holds out his front paws, and Dean steps forward. They have not yet discussed how this will go. Will he be riding Castiel like a horse? “Riding,” Dean sniggers to himself, “First time for everything!”
When Cas offers to draw Dean a bath in their huge cast iron tub, Dean knows he’s going to get laid tonight. He follows Cas up the stairs, ignoring the kids watching a movie in the living room. Cas undresses Dean slowly, kissing the exposed skin as he goes. When the tub is filled, Cas gently guides Dean in.
. Eye-balling it, because he doesn’t have the mental energy to use the fucking scoop, he shakes the grounds into the basket for a full pot. Dropping his head back, he lets out a loud groan and drags his hands down his face, he sends out silent pleas for this day to be a good day. Stumbling over to the window above the sink he stares out without seeing, scratching his belly absently as he waits for the damned appliance to stop percolating.
After he pours his mate a small glass of his favorite whiskey, he guides the tired Omega up to the bathroom and draws a bath for him. Unclothing Dean slowly is one of his favorite things he often doesn’t get to do, usually they rip each other’s clothes off with brute strength and impatience, but right now his Omega is submissive and Castiel craves to make him feel cherished. He kisses the exposed skin slowly, tasting Dean with flicks of his tongue.
“My species exist on a different plane of existence the majority of our lives, it causes us to age differently than humans. I estimate that I’m about twenty-six in your human years,” Castiel murmurs, licking his bottom lip and playing with Dean’s ring on his finger. Spinning and twisting the ring, Castiel is hesitant to meet Dean’s eyes, “I want to stay here. Please let me stay here. I… I need somewhere to lay low where my clan cannot find me.”
Looking down at himself, he then realizes that he’s standing only in his boxers. “Yeah, uh, yeah. Me too,” he stammers out feeling ridiculous.
Castiel cuts his Omega off with a swift hand across his mouth.  Tapered fingers in a soft caress against his jaw. Slow drag of promise, of love, sweet in essence.
The young dragon pushes his hands under the edge of Dean’s tee shirt and lifts it slowly revealing Dean’s stomach, chest and shoulders. He pushes the older man back until the backs of his legs hit the bed, and he sits abruptly, releasing the breath he hadn’t realised he was holding.
Just as Dean is reaching for Cas’ legs under the water, the pool turns turbulent with the wake of a teenage dude cannonballing his buddies.
“No, love,” Castiel catches himself and kisses Dean. Soft kisses, tasting of toothpaste, and sleep. Dean’s beard scratches at his face but it feels good. Pulling him into a hug, his mate practically falls into his arms and scents his neck. “We’ll do something special tonight.”
“I don’t know, some freshman party. I nicked from some other freshmen’s dorm in Roble last night,” Jo replies, shrugging, “Why?”
“I’m alright Ben, I swear. I’m just waiting on your Dad. Go back to rehearsing,” Dean states with a soft smile.
“You didn’t charge them last night,” Cas reminds him, “You stayed up too late watching that movie with Ben and Alex.”
Bobby watches as Dean and his new friend laugh as they reach the Impala, both jumping in their respective sides as they hurry to leave work and head home. Bobby can hear the radio blaring as the Impala leaves the lot and heads in the direction of Dean’s home. He shakes his head, and with a knowing smile mutters to himself, “Damn fool has no idea.”
Cas shushes him, blanketing his body over Dean’s. With his arm around Dean’s chest, Cas hauls Dean to his knees so he’s sitting back on his mate, tilting and twisting his head back so Cas can kiss him. In one smooth thrust, Cas enters and swallows Dean’s hoarse shout from his lips.
Castiel passes the very long rope over their hands after each statement. Dean's palm burns, he sees the fire growing between Castiel’s fingertips, but he holds fast and his gaze doesn’t stray from Castiel’s eyes. Breathing deep he repeats after the love of his life, “
.” Castiel whimpers, his eyes huge as Dean attempts to slowly belly crawl away from the sharp retort of the ice breaking beneath him.
Michael’s sword is unsheathed, the sharp tip underneath his father’s chin. Blood trails down his neck as the point breaks the skin, undeterred John looks towards Dean and then Sam a soft smile on his face and then the smile fades, almost as if it was never there. Looking up to Michael with vehemence and snarling, “Do it.”
Dean lets his boots thump to the floor as he heaves himself out of the chair. It’s an effort tonight. He’s tired. Not for the first time he wishes he had someone to share the load, someone to talk to at the end of the day, someone to… His thoughts trail off as he sets about tidying the bar and going through the routines of closing.
“Well, are you sure he or she,” Sam pauses here for dramatic effect on the pronouns, “lives in Roble?”
“I think you can,” Cas huffs out and those long tapered fingers delve into Dean’s heat. He works Dean slowly until Dean is fucking himself back onto those fingers, hips never finding a pattern but just searching for release. When Cas pulls his fingers away, Dean keens in protest.
Cas continues to search Dean’s eyes earnestly, as one hand tentatively cards through the short hairs at the base of his neck. Dean shivers and cannot help leaning into the steady and reassuring touch. He closes his eyes and just enjoys the closeness and warmth. He’s been alone so long. Maybe he can have this after all.
Dean submits, and stands quietly as the young dragon drinks him in with his eyes. Cas brings his hands up and begins to unbutton Dean’s shirt, pushing it back over his shoulders.
“And we are bound, and I’m not going anywhere! Trust me, Dean. We are mates. You are mine and I am yours,” Castiel says, his voice deep with emotions and fear in his eyes. “I will not be forced to mate with someone not of my own choosing - and I choose you, Dean. I choose you.”
Cas’ head snaps back to Dean and he frowns, his eyes flicking to Dean’s lips, breaking the demon’s concentration.
He sings the jingle, using the greasy tongs as a mic. The dragon flicks his tail and wiggles his ears. The mirth in those intelligent eyes is infectious as he watches Dean’s every move.
“Yes, Dean,” the man replies simply, his eyes so intense and blue that Dean knows that without a doubt that his dragon and this man are one and the same. It all clicks in Dean’s mind... Folger’s intelligence, the fact that Dean felt like he was having a real conversation, and the fact that Folgers got into his house in the first place!
Blinking, Cas’ mouth drops open in shock, but he clicks it shut and nods his head eagerly. Dean smiles and whispers, “thank fuck” which makes Cas laugh.
“How dare you!” the man, Dean knows as Bart now, “You are a broken shell of a dragon! You should be honored that I chose you, that I pitied you enough to be my breeding stock! Instead, you're out here on earth whoring yourself to this ape!”
“It’ll be ok Cas. You are doing great,” Dean mollifies, smoothing out Castiel’s jacket and scarf. He pulls his dragon close, “They’ll stop being trolls and slow down soon. They just smell fresh meat, trying to unsettle you and get a reaction”
“Not yet, Cas,” Dean growls out, angling for his own release, he wants to paint the Prince’s chest with his own release. Castiel wraps his hand around Dean’s member, pushing Dean over the edge. His orgasm locks his entire body up, painting the Prince as he wanted but giving Castiel the opportunity to flip Dean over, pistoning into Dean chasing his own climax. Fisting the furs above his head, Dean holds on, enraptured by the masculine beauty of the Prince of Andover. When Castiel comes with a shout, Dean’s muscles tremble underneath him but he wraps himself around Castiel to lay bonelessly together.
“But it’s beautiful in it’s own way, just look at the flower. Can’t it stay? It may help your plants in some way. Perhaps it will attract pollinators?”
“Yes,” Cas states, peeling off his socks and dropping them on the floor, “Wanna tell me what’s going on?”
Then he stops, stares Cas in the eye, willing him to be calm, and loosens his bathing suit with one hand, whilst he slips the other inside.
Dean doesn’t know how Sammy and his Mom will feel about rolling up with a man technically sixteen years his junior. He thinks they’ll be alright. Dean’s probably overthinking the entire situation anyway. His nerves stem from the fact that Sam’s adopted son Jack is closer in age to Castiel, at twenty years old, than he himself is. He’s probably making the whole situation weirder than it is in his head. Blowing things out of proportion. Right? As uncertainty fills him, he takes a little comfort that he’s not actually a cradle snatcher since technically they aren’t officially
Over the years, Mother’s Day has usually been one of those holidays that is forgotten in the hustle and bustle that is the Novak-Winchester household. Typically the day is spent quietly, Dean has never felt like celebrating since it reminded him of his own mother’s death when he was just a child. When the kids were small, Cas would usually cook his favorite meal and he’d get homemade cards from the kids, but now that the babies were teenagers the day is a day like any other.
“I got the ice off of Baby,” Cas sighs, his fingers splayed along Dean’s torso pressing into him. His nose nuzzling and his lips dragging against Dean’s neck.
Wrapping his legs along the dragon’s hips, pulling him impossibly deeper and more importantly closer, Dean kisses Castiel. Messy and desperate. They both start slow, Castiel getting used to the new sensations, Dean softly sighing his praises. As the dragon and keeper move together, finding a rhythm that pleases them both.
“Turn around, please,” Cas requests, voice low and soft, his hands gripping and biting into Dean’s hips. Dean does what he asks, facing the side of the shower wall. The cool tile is sharp against his forearms as he widens the stances of his leg.
“Hi, Daddy,” she says, eating cheese crackers straight from the damn box. She’s still in her pajamas from the night before, her golden blonde hair in a messy bun on top of her head.
Castiel had not replied but instead, he had raised himself to his full height and proceeded to undo his trousers. He let them drop, revealing bright orange boxer briefs which had left nothing to the imagination.
Dinner is pleasant, which is surprising to all adult parties involved. Jack and Claire sit on one side of the long table, Dean at the other, and Castiel at the head. Jack and Claire both talk animatedly to their father, affection between them evident. Dean stays quiet, not wanting to break the undivided attention the children are garnering from the royal.
“Yeah, so what?” Gabe grouches and Cassie is about to scold him when the words die on his tongue, his head whips over to look at Dean. The Alpha’s eyes flashing red and then smiling, looking dazed as much as Dean feels.
The rest of the day passes with Dean in deep thought. He thinks about Castiel, what it means to look after another person… and how lonely he’s been recently, caught in the same old rut for the past few years. How Castiel had alluded that he’s running away from home. He finishes and washes up, calling goodbye to Bobby as he collects Castiel from the office. Through the large reception window, he sees Cas before the dragon sees him. Cas is perched on the office chair, idly spinning in circles first one way then another. It’s pretty adorable if Dean dares to admit it to himself. His hoard is close by on the edge of the desk, but even from this angle it seems to have gained some items. He can see a couple of shiny chrome washers and a paperclip on top of the coins.
Eyes round like saucers, Cas nods and Dean gets up off of him. Taking off his clothes for the second time in the night, Dean smiles shucking off his boxers and wiggling out his socks. His Alpha watches him, audibly swallowing. His hair sticking straight off his head from Dean’s wandering fingers.
“No, Castiel. I don’t think she is confused. At all. Not one little bit. Now will you come down here and sort this out with her please.”
“Mark our souls? What is she talking about Cas? I thought we were already bondmates. You don’t have to go do you? You’re not leaving?”
“Oh yeah, ok,” clearing his throat and becoming authoritative, “Begone! SHOO! Oh, naughty one! Leave and go have a coffee or something…” Dean trails off half-heartedly as Cas disappears in a dramatic puff of red smoke.
Cas is having trouble managing the situation in his pants, and stops to discreetly adjust himself, but Dean is having none of it, and pulls Cas by the hand impatiently dragging him along. Laughing, tripping over each other’s limbs, pawing at each other’s backs, and Castiel even gets a handful of his butt as they press against the Impala. Kisses are messy and full of teeth and snorts.
Dean steps off the small stage, and mingles with his audience shaking hands and making small talk. He loves coming here. The ladies always spoil him and Mavis Novak makes a mean apple tea cake which is nearly as good (but not quite) as pie.
“Alright,” Sam lets out a small sigh and a weak smile. His little brother knocks on C315 and a shorter man with golden toffee eyes and brown hair opens the door. Dean thinks he’s a Beta, but the smell of his Alpha is strong coming from the shared room.
