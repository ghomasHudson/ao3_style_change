things, without meaning to of course, and he'd rather not have those things interfere with, add another variable so to speak, to his already marred experiment. He flipped through various items hanging in his closet to find something, anything, that would come close to matching everything John was
"I do. But he's only alright with this now. After, he won't want anything to do with me." Seriously? How the fuck could he think that?
"You more than talked it out," Sherlock interrupted. "You had many, many physical interludes throughout that particular conversation."
Harry liked to get things out of people, and she'd tried it on Sherlock, who wasn't having any of it. "Harry, leave him alone. He doesn't like the prying."
Sherlock turned around. John was first struck by how close the detective was to him. Mere centimeters of space hung between them. Second thing: Sherlock was wearing jeans. And a soft-looking t-shirt. Tight. Jeans. John had to take a few breaths. When had Sherlock lifted weights? Or done any sort of upper body exercise? This was news. Third thing: there were streaks of white powder on Sherlock's cheek. And the stuff in the pan looked like pudding.
"Hey, Sherlock? I found you some pajamas." He tossed them to the detective. "They aren't mine, so I don't know how they ended up here, but they seem to be your size-ish." Sherlock stared at the articles for a minute, shocked. "What's wrong?"
John looked over, surprised, and not really happy to see her. "What are you doing here? I thought you were getting a new flat. Did I even tell you where I lived?"
John could feel himself overheating. This man took Sherlock from him for a crime he didn't commit, just to insult him to his best friend (boyfriend? maybe? John couldn't remember that particular conversation). "What are you looking at?"
" She stood up. "Well? Are we going to get a cab or what?" Sherlock thought about it for less than a second before following her out of the flat, quietly closing the door behind them.
John's eyes met his from so far away, and Sherlock was almost glad of it. John wouldn't be able to see how many salty streaks painted his cheeks. "Oh God," he whispered into the phone.
"Of course," Sherlock tried to scoff, but it came out as more of a stutter. John leaned in and kissed him hard, shutting down any other things he could have said. He knew John was a good kisser, but this was bordering on amazing. His hands came up to pull John on top of him, then to run over the doctor's exposed back. John had his fingers tugging through Sherlock's hair and his mouth explored the detective's.
"A very dangerous substance," Sherlock replied, holding up the bottle. "One little prick--not too difficult in an outfit like that, at full speed on a horse--and you're almost certain to have a problem.
"But if you don't go, who am I gonna go with?" Sherlock was stopped on the pavement, and John had to turn around to face him.
“And then on the last day we’ll have an outing to celebrate Sherlock’s birthday early,” his mother added.
"Sorry. I'm really very sorry I have to bother you with this, but I'd rather not wait all night at A&E." Feeling conciliatory, Lestrade turned off the desk lamp. "I'm pretty sure that I need my nose set. It's broken, and bloody damn grotesque at the mo'." Seeing John's weight shift, he said, "Stop. I'll bring whatever supplies you need to you here. That is," he grunted, "if you're up for it. It was rude of me to assume..."
"Enough with that nonsense." John snapped, amending his snarl with a kiss. "You and I both know you're not a sociopath, high functioning or otherwise. As far as - " John breathed, unable to speak without a waver in his voice.
John's expression sobered posthaste. "Enough, Sherlock! I'm not mad at you, honestly. Let's just not do this, ok?"
*John startles Sherlock with this truth, that he is quite worthy of love; why was there ever a doubt? (Go damn you, Mycroft and your bollocks about "sentiment". Fucking ignorant git!) P.S. That was John's humble opinion, not Sigmund's. Sigmund would place Sherlock's doubts square on Mummy's clever shoulders. Freud was a wanker on the subject of women.
Sally, wise enough to keep her darker opinions to herself, merely humphed and leaned over to rub at his arms. "You've turned blue. The paramedics should be here any second."
And let me finish. This isn't a 'Let's make John feel less like an imbecile now that we've shagged' moment. This is a 'I'm going to shut the fuck up and let John finish a sentence' moment. Alright, you bloody git?" John's own face reddened.
"Sherlock," John murmured, "I would like to continue what we started before. Our conversation, I mean. Influenza, and all that." The skin of his face creased, and folded, and crinkled from the mind-numbing force of anxiety. "I mean, we don't have to do it right
"Stop it, Sherlock," John pressed, "don't... leave. You told me you love me and I'm not letting you go." He jammed the heels of his small hands into his light-deprived eyes. The pressure triggered a cloud of psychedelic whorls spinning across the surface of his eyelids. Disoriented, John pulled away, blinking hard to erase the pesky phosphenes.
Not good. No, both of them, not so good. Keeping John's hand captive, Sherlock shifted his balance to plop down hard on his bum. The men rested shoulder to shoulder up against the tub. The twisted shame in John's countenance eased up a little, although Sherlock understood that this was undoubtedly due to fatigue rather than catharsis. John was a caregiver by nature, a desire running deep in his bones.
"Hee...hee hee heee...oh, God, I haven't laughed this hard since that first night - when I fixed your limp." Abruptly, Sherlock cast away whimsy for woe. "Oh, hell, John, I am sorry, I'm being an idiot."
Now, Sherlock's chest rumbled, the noise edging into a wild groan. Greg gaped in stupefied horror as his friend thrust hands into his hair and started yanking
John was pushing unconsciousness, so left the pair two their own devices. They could figure this out, stabilize his leg and his vitals, whatever. The doctor's plan of action involved soaking up the warmth of a hideously orange shock blanket, then bathing in the glow of a lovely narcotic. It was a fine plan, and he was sticking to it.
Sherlock conscientiously constructed his next sentence. "Jawww..." he cleared his throat. "John, listen. You need to listen, and take my words in. Listen... and then
" 'Kay. Good. That's good, Sherlock, very good." Greg grunted, and then shook himself like a wet dog. "Wait. What I mean is, it's very brave of you to have told him about it." He slapped both hands hard on the steering wheel. "This... Jesus fuck, Sherlock, this information isn't something that we would gossip about like it's cricket!" Lestrade was so very, very tired; so mentally drained that it actually hurt to think. "I'm your
Pale eyes darted away. "No, John. This is exactly what I want," Sherlock blurted, abashed. "However, I - John. John, I am not exactly experienced in these activities...uhm, kissing, all that, and - the uhm...the sex. I don't know how to do this correctly, and it makes me feel rather uncomfortable. I don't like not knowing how to - I don't want to make a fool of myself."
Sherlock," John heard himself squeaking, not the most promising start. Clearing his throat, John struggled to voice his convictions in an manner that would dispel any and all of of Sherlock's doubts. "Please. Please love, trust that I'm telling you the truth. Each of these marks represents your strength, your power, your
..yes, he'd always known his name. Sherlock's blatant disregard in "remembering" it had everything to do with shame, and fundamentally nothing to do with how he regarded the man himself.
Sherlock shifted his weight, elbows braced on his knees. He peered down at the cooling last dregs of his tea, searching for the right thing to say. Too bad he wasn't a soothsayer. "It was barely six weeks into the mission when I experienced my first break with reality." Tipping the mug, he swallowed the bitter remains for courage. Once John's specter appeared, Sherlock explained, it trailed him incessantly. Two steps behind, at all times. Sometimes, he saw it's form darken, surfing in the wake of his own shadow. Now wasn't
Abruptly, the doctor's muscles flagged. He lolled backwards uncontrollably, body spent after such intense use. John's back smacked hard against the tank, ceasing his body's momentum. Unfortunately, John's head kept on rolling. Silver-blond hair whipped the back of his neck, and he groaned as he looked at the ceiling.
"Use the sheets. They're going to be wet when we finish up, anyway. If we're lucky, that is," the doctor tittered somewhat hysterically.
"Piss off, you bloody berk. My legs feel much better...thanks, I think. You can stop with the ruthless manhandling." John flashed him a rueful grin; the cute, crooked one that always forced Sherlock's heart into bouts of frantic arrhythmia. "Now help me up. I need to walk around a bit to finish waking them up."
"Legs back, or up? Or both?" Sherlock groaned, shaking salty sweat from his eyes. "Be more specific. On my end, it's bloody fantastic."
"Ha! What would Sherlock be, if not rude? Possibly, he and I are both ridiculous," the doctor protested. "Sherlock for being a egotistical wanker, and I for putting up with his outrageous behavior. Nevertheless, it sounds as if he's solved another crime tonight. Perhaps, he can have his moment in the sun. And
John was not here, so he would have to make do. When needs must... Lestrade reached out and cuffed the back of Sherlock’s head. The sharp crack of his hand against that incredibly thick skull pierced the park’s eerie quiet like a gunshot. Caught completely off balance, because…really? Et tu, Lestrade? Sherlock's self-control imploded and he snapped. He'd survived for two horrid years running on brainpower, and more importantly, sheer primal instinct. Presented with possible betrayal by a trusted compatriot, Sherlock's lizard brain took charge and he bolted.
"Sherlock," Greg spoke gently, "Now. How's about we both take a deep breath and work this through." He struggled to sound soothing, oblivious to the fierce hammering of his heart. "So," the DI swallowed, nervously parsing his words, "can you please tell me, what's all this," he gestured vaguely in the air, "uhm...your
Also, we're all going to pretend that I know how remote-control vibrators work, and that Sherlock can control John's from several miles away. 'Kay?
"Nearly there, love...can you feel me pulsing?" John gasped. He jerked his head, clearing the burning sweat from his eyes. "Are you as well? Sherlock? Fuck! Are you close?"
screaming kid being yanked by their arm to a car? Fucker sure knew what he was about, and that's no mistake."
Humming, John nuzzled at Sherlock's perfect, long neck. "Hey," he said between nibbles, "So kiss me for real, you arse, you absolute nob. Do you know how long I've been wanting this?" John's hot tongue traced up the path of Sherlock's carotid artery, stopping to lave on his jaw.
John bit his own lip, albeit without breaking the flesh. His eyes flitted over Sherlock, evaluating his status, and how his own words would be taken. "Sherlock," he groaned, almost spent, "can we just go kip on your bed?" They were difficult, the things that he needed to say. John needed to say them, all the same. They might as least be physically comfortable, he mused. And he was so very, very exhausted.
They cuddled. Sherlock actually cuddled, and snuggled, and nuzzled John Watson. This outpouring of love was hypnotic. Sherlock's soft touch eased John's sated body until he slipped into a state of euphoria. Curled within strong arms, John lay in repose; so still he hardly seemed to be breathing. Bewitched by Sherlock's show of emotion, John just let everything go.
John picked up his phone and then tossed it to the coffee table in disgust. No new texts, no new calls. Apparently, the sympathy portion of his dilemma had run its course. Now, he faced the mind-numbing notion of being superfluous. He decided to numb himself a little more with the purloined spirits. It really was very good stuff.
getting in the way. John glued his hands onto Sherlock's face, actually squishing his cheeks with the pressure his fingers exerted. Sherlock's eyes were void of all emotion, but John's own body shook with the ferocity of his lover's trembling.
"Yeah, no worries, mate. Just go," John panted with his newly free diaphragm. "Please. Just go," he flapped a hand at the kitchen, "blow something up. Or burn down the flat. It will make you feel better, I swear."
...hello, Sherlock, and a very pleasant morning to you, too. It's a bit early, don't you think, to say things that might give me a heart attack?"  John scrubbed a hand over his face.
"Piss off. I need the loo. Screw your sodding thesaurus," the little man groused. "Now. Get up off your lazy, albeit gorgeous arse and help me...else I rupture and muck up your bedding." John leaned over to smack the round hump of Sherlock's bum. "Speaking of asinine..."
The beige spandex wrapping caught his eye, wound tight around his split jeans. How in God's name did he think that he would manage this without Sherlock's help? Not today, at least. His less-than-delicious body odor competed with the enticement of the gown's.
Hand flying, John wanked as if his life depended on it, or at least the foreseeable future. He reveled in the slight cessation of pain, panting harder as his balls closed in on his cock. This was it - this was going to work, he just knew it. The fantasy female John envisioned (whom he was presently fucking balls-deep) incorporated some unusual new features. Traditionally a "tiny built blonde/sky blue eyes" kind of bloke, this willowy temptress had translucent cyan eyes and burnished copper-brown hair. Her mental visage shot sparks of pleasure straight to his hot, throbbing cock. John's free hand tensed unconsciously, illusory locks held taut in his grasp as he squeezed.
this, you inconsiderate twat!) ran completely at odds with what his sorry carcass was physically capable of doing. Flashbacks sucked the ever-loving life from John's soul, never mind his being bombarded by a arsenal of unpleasant emotions. Having run the gauntlet from ecstatic to tragic in the space of twelve measly hours, he was tapped. For fuck's sake, he was male...and British! British
Large and small, muscled and lean, the figures on the bed became lost in each other's warmth. Sherlock roped his long arms around John and yanked him tight to his chest. John clung to his friend even harder; arms flush to his back, hands fisted into his shirt. Heartbeats regulated and beat the same rhythm. Every thought and emotion convalesced.
"Pillows, John. We need more pillows," the overstretched and underfed genius gasped. "You've been cursed with ridiculously inadequate appendages."
"I do, my love," John said firmly, tapping a bit of his inner captain. If he gave Sherlock any leeway, he knew that this painful tableau would drag on until it grew unbearable, and he'd eventually be forced to give in.
"Fuck you. I never said I was a war hero, and you know it," John blurted, annoyed. "That's your little moniker, not mine."
"Er, I didn't, I wasn't aware of your level of arousal, but you definitely seemed to approve of what I was doing."
He saw himself drop the flannel, where it piled on the floor. He reached down to snag it. He fell flat on his arse. The crutches, perversely shooting in opposite directions, landed far beyond the reach of his fingers.
"Nonsense, John. Mild arrhythmias aren't generally deemed harmful, just a bit startling. Likewise, an unheralded adrenaline rush gets your heart pumping." Sherlock's icy blue eyes sparkled as his lover flushed maroon. Befuddling John added luster and verve to his life. "You must get up. You have important things to do."
The detective cringed as the doctor turned his head and shot him the fish eye. "John? What is it? Do you need something?" Sherlock half-pushed off the arms of his chair, ready to spring into action.
Sherlock's teacup grew heavy in his hands. It tipped sideways, and he bent to set it down before tea spilled. Unconsciously, solicitously, Sherlock calculated a number of horrid possibilities. He bent farther, nudging carefully until the cup rested under the bed. There was absolutely no need here to tempt fate. Only one injury allowed at 221B at a time, thank you very much.
Lestrade had concluded his meager run-down by the time they pulled in to Whitfield Park. The Manchester file was paltry, leaving the NSY starting from scratch. Greg only hoped that Sherlock's talent at reading crime scenes might offer enough of a lead to locate and rescue all three. Raising his arms, the DI scrubbed weathered hands over his bleary eyes. Sherlock looked...
Unlike his consulting detective, Lestrade learned from his mistakes. The ability to explore the reasoning behind his errors was what had honed his skills as a detective. Lestrade had an excellent reputation as a DI, despite what certain geniuses might say.
The detective could admit that, in no uncertain terms, he did indeed had blood on his hands - quite a bit.
John liked sex for its variety, from receiving a fully-clothed hand job to rigorously pounding his partner into the floorboards. It was all good, unless it wasn't, but then even bad sex was better than a cold bed.
Within a week, he depended on its presence. The specter offered both medical and tactical advice, each time his information sound. If Sherlock felt poorly, it whispered words of friendly encouragement. If low, it dealt snarky one-liners, or joked about thumbs in the fridge. When Sherlock wondered why he couldn't just
Sherlock's eyes glowed with radioactive malice. Nevertheless, he flapped a large hand in the air in a show of acquiescence. John gazed fixedly at Sherlock, electrified by the strange light emanating from his lover's strange eyes. Amazing, really, the shift from frozen to furious in an instant.
Love, such a perilous and slippery sentiment. It's a precept woven into sonnets and carved into trees.
Sherlock fought to delete the last twenty-four hours before the sliding glass doors of Bart's Hospital closed in his wake. His crystalline blue eyes sparkled, welling up with moisture. Shiny wet lines streaked his cheeks.
John shushed him and squeezed his hand, already drifting off. “Sherlock, would you just shut up for once?”
He was a few minutes late to the match, but Sherlock easily found Molly seated by herself, shivering in a black dress that was much too short to be wearing in January, and much too formal to be wearing to a rugby match.
“Of course not. Mason’s such a brilliant young navigator, he was able to maneuver the carriage on its descent.”
"I don't suppose it really was my fault." The smile faded momentarily. "But still. I am sorry." Sherlock stared sincerely into John's eyes, a silent vow in his own.
Sherlock glanced smugly over his shoulder as they walked away. Anderson stared after them in frustration and shock.
John followed Sherlock up the stairs. After that, he was a bit more careful to ask Sherlock when his family were coming home.
"He's easily amused," Sherlock scoffed, sore that he wasn't the center of John's attention. When he did spot Sherlock looking over, however, he smiled and waved.
"Welcome back, Mycroft," Sherlock said jovially. "John's my boyfriend, now. Do pick your jaw up off the floor, it hasn't been cleaned this week." He swept by, leaving John and Mycroft staring at each other, red-faced.
Just as Sherlock wondered whether he was supposed to follow him, John reappeared with a cassette tape in hand. When he started up the stereo, Sherlock recognized the tape he'd made years ago for the anniversary of their first date--the real one, not the one they'd had as kids--and stared at him, puzzled.
John managed to take a breath before Sherlock’s hands were on him, divesting him of the outer, explosive clothing. “Alright?” he said, breathless, and when John didn’t answer, more urgently: “Are you alright?”
After a few long hours in the Hospital Wing, John was free to go, sporting fresh new skin on his right arm and breathing better than he ever remembered breathing.
Being much more experienced in the art of getting by his elders than the twelve-year-old he’d stopped, the two were able to get to the Restricted Section of the library without raising suspicion or being told off.
He hadn’t caught a single glimpse of Moriarty since that night, and whenever he spoke of him to Sherlock, the boy clammed up and told him to drop the subject. He wished Sherlock would talk to him about the case—he hated being in the dark almost as much as Sherlock did, although Sherlock would have scoffed at the thought. Still, he limited his mentions of Moriarty to once every few days, because even though it was alright when it was unintentional, he couldn’t stand Sherlock
"You don't even want your gift?" Sherlock asked him. He gave him a sultry look, pulled him in by the hips.
brats, perhaps you’d be able to see why I love him. Excuse me,” he finished abruptly, standing and storming from the room, fists and jaw clenched.
So, when it came to the lift, they were as prepared as two amateur dancers who had been drinking heavily for hours could possibly be. John ran at Sherlock, who held out his arms to hoist him over his head. The result was a pile of limbs that groaned from the floor in front of the raised platform.
He managed to stop himself from screaming out loud, but grunted as he struggled to turn and lean against the wall, watching Sherlock pin his assailant to the floor.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw John discreetly looking him up and down before pressing the button to call the lift. "I don't suppose I could ever stand a chance against you, though."
Both their heads whipped around at McGonagall’s sudden entrance. John nearly shoved Sherlock to the floor, but he caught himself on the waistband of John’s fresh pyjama bottoms. John glared at him. He shrugged.
John rolled his eyes. “You know, they’re actually quite lovely.” When Sherlock didn’t say anything, John added, “They really care about you.”
“Sure.” As soon as he’d said it, John realized he shouldn’t. He shouldn’t want to spend his Saturday night with this insane boy who kept trying to cram bits of information about his worst subject into his head rather hatefully.
Before John could react, Sherlock had flipped them both over, so that he was lying on his stomach, his chest between John's legs, his elbows on either side of his pelvis. His hands were bound into a prayerful pose right at the waistband of John's boxers. They stared at each other for a moment before bursting into laughter.
In a few minutes the two of them were presentable, though Sherlock’s continued attempts to drag John back to bed using only his lips and his hands teasingly light on his hips hadn’t helped matters. Even as John opened the door to head downstairs, Sherlock pulled him into a heated kiss that only served to frustrate him when John reciprocated enthusiastically, then abruptly turned and bolted down the stairs.
Mrs. Holmes raised her eyebrows even higher once Sherlock had said it twice. “And he asked you, did he?”
"I...I know that," Sherlock muttered, but still clutched at John's fingers tightly all the way to the hospital.
“Sherlock, that’s incredible,” John found himself saying, and then he laughed at himself, because that was such a stupid thing to say, but it was true. John couldn’t have kept a lid on his hormones if he’d tried.
"It's a form of conditioning that Muggles have researched extensively. After each step we'd mastered, Mummy would give us a sweet. I suppose perhaps that's where Mycroft gets his affinity for devouring them, as he was always such a great learner."
“Happy as ever to be graced with your presence, Sherlock,” Sherlock’s mother added as she entered the room from what could only be the kitchen. If he weren’t fighting the urge to spontaneously combust, John would have laughed as he realized he’d found the source of Sherlock’s sarcastic tendencies.
When the new first years entered, John simply watched the mop of curls next to Stamford fall to the table with a thump that he could almost hear from across the room. He kept watching as student after student was called to put on the Hat. At one point, the boy next to Sherlock accidentally elbowed him, and it was when John saw him jerk his head upward and rub his eyes that he realized that the boy had actually fallen asleep.
“Right. Your hands may look beautiful all scarred and stained, but I don’t think I can pull it off quite as well.” John smiled. “And I need sleep. It’s late, let’s go.”
Sherlock didn't need to be told twice. Soon his feet were nestled in a pile of clothing, and John's arms were wrapped around his middle. "Do you really think this will help?"
He didn’t speak. If anything, he was most worried that a word from him would take them all up, and if there was one thing he knew at the moment, it was that Sherlock Holmes needed to get out of here alive.
Sherlock's mother had come up with the plan for them to come in from opposite sides of the congregation. He took her arm and let her lead him as the music swelled.
“I dunno, at least half of them,” Wilson replied, and their renewed laughter was contagious enough to force Sherlock to join them.
"Sherlock," John started, practically laughing. "If you think I didn't willingly enter that house knowing there was danger, then I don't think you've been around for the hundreds of other times I've followed you into a potentially dangerous situation."
He heard a loud yelp from Sherlock’s room and he sighed. “Sherlock!” He put down his glass and walked around the corner to see Sherlock stumbling around, trying to walk on only his injured foot, his other leg contorted so that he could examine the other, which was also now injured.
"Yes, thank you, Mike," John replied, also breathing heavily. Sherlock was much too busy burying his face against John's neck, feeling his healthy, strong pulse, to even nod.
The highlight of John's actual party was when Ronald Winston fell out of the bouncy castle and cried. Sherlock never had liked him much, and when he muttered about the idiot showing off, John wasn't the only one who laughed.
John found himself reaching down to tug Sherlock’s shirt out of his trousers and let his thumbs rest against the bare skin beneath it as he laid his hands on Sherlock’s hips and continued to work his lips against Sherlock’s in earnest. Sherlock finally did the same, though he didn’t stop with hands on hips. Instead, he began to loosen John’s tie and unbutton his shirt. The layers of the top half of John’s school uniform were soon discarded to a pile a few feet away. John made sure Sherlock’s were quick to join them.
When Sherlock and John awoke, it was to a brand new video posted to John's blog--of them struggling through a karaoke duet and making complete fools of themselves while Greg laughed heartily in the background.
, and if Sherlock's attentiveness was anything to go by, his top two films were likely to become a top three.
As the hours passed, Sherlock read and danced and played pretend with the girls while John watched, participating at times, but mostly just content to see Sherlock interacting with them. Eventually, Lucy began to yawn, then Amelia, and Sherlock and John each had an armful of sleepy toddler to carry upstairs. When they were dressed in their nighties and Amelia was snuggled in with her stuffed giraffe toy, John flipped on the nightlight and the monitor before heading back downstairs. Sherlock followed him, and they ended up in the armchair, Sherlock perched on John's lap in a comfortable ball.
Sherlock produced his wand and what appeared to be a tiny bit of padding from within his robe. "Engorgio," he muttered, and the thing he held quickly grew into a mattress and even a blanket. John raised his eyebrows at the advanced magic and quickly scrambled for it, but Sherlock stayed where he was. “Aren’t you getting sore?” John asked, scooting to the edge of the mattress.
Sometimes, when their mum and dad went to visit their great uncle in the country, Harry and John stayed next door with the Holmeses. Harry would sleep on the sofa, while John slept on the floor next to Sherlock's bed, usually resulting in late nights that ended with Mrs. Holmes entering and telling the boys off for staying up past their bedtime.
John shook his head, smiling. "Of course you would overthink something like that." He kissed Sherlock, then drew away just enough to rest their foreheads together. "You're wrong about everyone loving me."
Sherlock paused again, then looked fully at John for the first time since the bomb had been revealed. “You all right?” he asked softly. If John didn’t know better, he would’ve said there was something like concern littering his tone.
As soon as the door closed, John turned back to Sherlock. "I'd always thought Moran was off doing Moriarty's dirty work."
Mycroft’s prim perch on the stiff armchair was met with Sherlock’s graceful flop onto the sofa. “Once you’ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable”—Sherlock took a deep breath—“must be true.”
"Then we match," John replied with a smile, and all of the tension left Sherlock's shoulders. Victor was right. John was glad they matched. He shouldn't have been so nervous; John had asked him to accompany him to the party, after all. Clearly he thought of Sherlock as his date, right? It was just all happening too quickly for Sherlock to process.
“This weather is dreadful. We spent ages flying around in circles trying to find the place. Honestly, Violet, couldn’t you invest in a beacon of some sort?”
not been blackmailing my boyfriend into boring himself to death." Sherlock pitifully dropped his entire form onto the sofa.
"That you and I are romantically involved. Or, at the very least, that you would like for us to be."
“Of course I’m worried. The man forgets to eat, it’s easy to see him forgetting about his foot and getting himself into a situation where he has to run for his life.”
“He was only a few weeks old in that one,” his mother said, and turned to another that seemed to have been taken on the same day. In this one, a tiny Mycroft sat beside his brother, poking at his cheek curiously as Sherlock regarded him, no longer grinning.
John turned bright red. He bit his tongue; he wasn’t so sure Sherlock wanted the Captain of his team to know he was…whatever their relationship was…with a member of the Gryffindor team, especially the one who’d hospitalized him last year. “I saved his life.” He had to refrain from adding, “you bloody stupid git.”
It didn't matter how observant Sherlock was. It didn't matter how advanced he was for his age, or how early he had caught on to the whole toilet thing. He was still hopelessly cursed with the tendency to wet the bed. Though John had teased him about it, he was always good-natured, just trying to make Sherlock laugh and feel less ashamed. And so, when presented with the occasion to sleep over at John's after his birthday party, he hesitated only because there would be others there. Granted, it was only a few others. But they didn't need to know about Sherlock's...problem.
"It's obvious. Those lances are designed to look deadly, but couldn't really hurt you if you were accidentally stabbed. The actors are highly trained to hit in non-life threatening areas of their opponents' bodies--shoulders, arms, and the like. Our knight was slain when the lance pressed against the breastplate of his armour, he fell off his horse, and he was trampled to death."
Andrew turned his entire body in his chair and squinted at Sherlock before suddenly bursting into raucous laughter that shook his entire frame. “Of course! Sherlock! How could I be so stupid? Forgive me,” he said, leaning in and steadying himself on the back of Sherlock’s chair. “I hadn’t—I hadn’t realized you were so tall. Why, just yesterday you were a wee little thing, all scrawny and—well, I guess you’re still scrawny, eh?” He glanced at Sherlock’s plate. “Don’t eat much, do you?”
He was down to his pants by the time he felt Sherlock behind him, kissing the back of his neck, snaking his arms around John’s waist, and already completely naked.
Opening gifts with the Holmes family proved to be quite a comical affair. Both Mycroft and Mummy Holmes were adamant about taking turns, and so a certain pattern played itself out with each round of gifts. Sherlock liked to tear open his presents violently, but only when Mycroft was poised and ready to open one of his, forcing him to wait until Sherlock had finished.
Turning the page, there was another picture of Mycroft, a bit older, reluctantly smiling toothlessly. It was incredible how little he’d changed, John thought.
“Will it harm him?” Mycroft asked, as he kneeled by Sherlock’s limp form, brushing the sweaty curls from his forehead.
This chapter deals with some pretty disturbing themes, namely experiments on Subs with RDD. I toned down the description a bit during this part of the chapter, but be warned that it is quite dark. However, there is no blood or gore for those of you who are squeamish.
“It’s an emergency. I need your help,” Sherlock told him, making his voice sound panicked. He knew Greg would never be able to live with himself if he let a friend deal with an emergency alone. So, playing to the other hunter’s weakness, Sherlock played to his strengths, and lied.
“Indeed. You were a very brave girl yesterday.” Mycroft brushed a piece of hair behind the girl’s ear and placed the chocolate in her hands. “I know you were worried about John, but I promise he’s going to be alright. I’m taking care of him.”
“I’ll keep them off your back as long as I can, then,” Greg said, looking at Sherlock with pity in his eyes. “I swear I didn’t think something like this was going to happen. He had him restrained with those chains you gave him and I would never imagine he would let John loose. I’m…I’m so sorry, Mycroft.”
John followed all the way downstairs, nerves on edge at going deeper into a facility that treated Subs like lab rats. After a few security checkpoints, which Sherlock breezed right through, they ended up standing in a white hallway with a giant glass window on one side. When John looked through the glass, his whole body flooded with emotions he’d never felt so strongly before in his life. Sorrow first, as he saw at least a dozen Subs strapped face down on tables. Some had restraints, while others only laid there, defeated, while Doms and machines inspected their nape. Then, anger with blind rage banging at the door filled him when he saw a small boy close to Molly’s age kneeling at one of the Doctor’s feet. The small boy was naked, save for a small pair of pants and collar, and shivering, but no one seemed to care unless he got in their way while they were walking, which resulted in a nudge to the ribs until he moved out of the way.
“Wanna…wanna…” He tried, but in the end, he let the stream carry him to where ever Sherlock wanted him to go, which apparently, was a bed.
Warmth flooded his body, making his heart begin to beat lightly in his chest. John gripped the man harder, his instincts telling him to ensure his prey’s immobility.
“Hmmm, interesting,” the man said, his eyes twinkled a bit as John continued to shout curse words and warning at him.
“Sh-Sherlock,” John cried again, tightening up around the cock that was stretching him open. He could feel the boy tensing even more, forcing Sherlock to hurt him. That was what the teenager always did though, thought too much and ended up only hurting him and the one he loved.
John seemed to shrink into the sofa further as Sherlock approached the small boy with a laptop sitting on his lap. ‘Me,’ John had said when he was asked what was wrong,
“Okay, thanks,” was all the young man could think to say, though to be honest he really wasn’t processing what was going on completely.
He saw a few drops of blood drip down the boy’s leg from the small tears his cock had caused, christening their shower and proving the boy had been taken.
“Great, I’ll be right back with some painkillers for your arm, too.” Sherlock slowly scooted out from under the boy, making sure to shove a pillow under his head to replace his body. John was shocked and a little upset at how much colder the pillow was, now that he didn’t have Sherlock under him. John felt coldness creep into every pour in his body, making him shiver. “Shhh, I’ll be right back,” Sherlock brushed his hand over the teenager’s forehead, which was now bright red with blush when he realized he’d let out a pathetic whine after he was left alone on the bed.
“Don’t fall asleep yet, love,” Sherlock’s voice interrupted, his tone light. “I want to show you before I clean you up.”
The slight irritation was growing into a burning pain, and John knew he couldn’t stand it much longer.
His hands were already shaking, leaving plenty of cracks in his tired mind for Sherlock to slip into and grab the reins to steer his boy back on track.
John sprung out of his chair, grabbing the plate in his hand, just in case he needed to use it as a weapon. “Don’t come any closer,” he threatened but his voice sounded slurred for some reason and the man he was warning seemed to double.
“Stop?” Sherlock asked playfully, tugging on John’s flaccid penis and knowing full well in less than a minute John’s body would be forced to respond to its lover’s touch. “Are you sure, John?”
“John! Wait!” he shouted, climbing out of the car with the agility he thought he’d lost twenty years ago. John paused for only a moment but the tension in the boy’s neck ensured that he was prepared to jump no matter what. As the blonde hair disappeared below the safety bar and his trainers came off the ground, Mycroft leapt, stretching his arm out as far as it would go and caught the waist of John’s trousers. He yanked back, probably giving the boy whiplash,
“Why on earth would we sell you, John? You are far too interesting, especially after that little display with my idiot brother. No, don’t you worry about him, he’s just mad that I’m winning,” Sherlock said, his voice practically gleeful.
“Saved me?!” John asked without thinking, earning a deadly glare from Mycroft and a tightening hand on his lower neck.
“Nobody? But you said in your note that Mycroft had a mistress. Now who is it?!” she snapped. The recovery room they had taken him to was rather small, and now it was filling up with an aura that scared John beyond belief. He had no idea what this woman was capable of.
Alright, that's the end of our holiday fun. We'll go back to every other weekend now, starting the 17th of January. How appropriate that Sherlock's birthday falls on the day before my spring classes start! The beginning of my semester would certainly be better with a comment or two (she said sheepishly).
“I can’t believe it. You’re actually a whole family of freaks. I can’t wait to tell everyone the sort you come from.” He was out of the house quicker than Sherlock could react.
“They see it as your problem, not theirs. Don’t worry, I’ll speak with them.” He started up the stairs. “I’ve a few words for the director anyway, if you don’t mind.”
He ran into the kitchen and took the telephone from his father, confused. “John? Where are you calling from?”
"Still, thanks for getting this on. I've thought for years we should have a Halloween ball rather than just a feast, but I never thought it would actually happen."
"Oh." There was a wall of snow packed into the shape of the door. The wind could no longer be heard.
"Christ," John murmured. He could feel the sensation building, and when Sherlock's hips started moving frantically, he knew he would be gone soon.
“I always do.” Sherlock said putting his gear down on the table and hanging his coat up. It was late and he was tired, the last thing Sherlock wanted to do was listen to his arch nemesis spew more dull facts about vampires. He did his job and he did it well, end of discussion. Sherlock flopped down in his chair, his long limbs hanging over the edges.
John's teenage mind doesn't think things through all the way. Irene is quite mysterious. Technology is cool.
John halted him with a heavy hand on his shoulder. “No, you’re not fine, Sherlock. It’s going to hurt a bit but it’s for the best.” John reached for the hand again, but it was pulled away and dug deeply into the man’s armpit.
Pulling out his phone, only to notice it was John’s lunch period already, Sherlock dried his hands on a flannel and began typing rapidly.
John cocked his head, but prepared himself for whatever was about to come through the door. He wasn’t quite prepared for a little toaster looking device rolling in on wheels that were taken off an RC Car. It must have had a camera on top, because it stopped for a moment, buzzed, then headed straight for John.
“Gee, thanks,” John rolled his eyes, but was sent into a coughing fit when Sherlock elbowed him roughly in the ribs. Greg gave a one sided smile, then lowered his head to text something into his phone.
John scooted in as far as he could, letting Sherlock do half the pushing until he was in the center. Maneuvering with his arms behind him was a lot harder than John first thought and was thankful Sherlock and Mycroft didn’t let him flounder too much before they situated him in between.
The hunter didn’t hesitate. He grabbed a bag of blood out of the box and tossed it to John. “Here you go,” John practically cooed to him, which oddly enough made him feel better. Sherlock’s hands shot out like a cobra and grabbed the bag. Within seconds, he had his teeth latched onto the plastic and was draining the contents.
The man sat down next to him, touching their thighs and shoulders together. “Well there are hundreds if not thousands of beers around the world for you to try. That’s what’s cool about trying new things and having as many experiences as you can, yeah? Well, I don’t…that’s what I think at least.”
“You’re being such a brave boy for me, John,” Sherlock cooed above him. To John’s dismay and sadly relief, the words soothed the pain in his shoulder like a fast acting balm. It still hurt though and the horror of the unknown was still too much for the young man, so he began to lash out…or, at least tried to lash out. Before John could even get his hands under him to push up, a large hand began petting through his hair gently, playfully even.
Then, he fell with a loud thump, his teeth smashing together and splitting the bar in half. One end dropped to the floor while the other seemed to turn to horrible mush inside his mouth. John spit it out, gasping and gagging on the floor, unaware of the Dom staring at him from behind the large wooden desk. “I did not give you permission to spit out the soap, nor did I say you could break position, John.” Mycroft never left his desk,
When John began to try and squirm away, that was when Sherlock had to step in before  he hurt himself. Pressing his large chest against him, Sherlock shoved him up against the wall, feeling how the boy was pinned easily while he opened him up. “S-stop, it hurts, Sherlock, please,” John cried again, but it didn’t matter, they were too far in this and there was no possible way he could pull away from that oasis he’d found.
Jim was the young man’s weakness; it was what brought him to this brink and it was what would push him over the edge. The late psychopath was a cruel sadistic man, and Sherlock understood that, but when his boy was threatened in any way it meant it was time for action.
Sherlock began moving slowly forwards and back along John’s angry cock. “Even when you think it’s your responsibility,” he sped up, practically bruising the boy’s hip bones, “it’s not, it’s mine now, John, it’s mine. You. Are. Mine.” John felt himself coiling tighter, his bullocks rising up as he watched Sherlock’s head moving closer and back, closer and back in tandem with the pleasure in his groin. “Come in me, John, it’s not yours anymore, it’s mine,” Sherlock growled and shoved himself all the way down, engulfing John’s cock completely, bringing a shout from the boy. Then, John came harder than he’d ever done before, feeling himself spasm against the tight walls as his seed flowed in the back down onto his thighs. It was as if all his worries had shot deep into Sherlock and were now coming back out, cleansed and sated as they should be.
Perhaps it was his heightened state of distress that triggered the sudden response after ten years or this guy was some kind of Dom with superpowers but the only thing that was for certain, was that John needed to get the fuck out before he took one step closer to his doom.
“Good point?” John rolled his eyes. “What do you have there?” the vampire asked, sitting up more on the bed. This human was different than the others, smarter, dangerous, and John didn’t like it one bit.
“You listen to me, brother mine,” Mycroft took a step closer to Sherlock, threatening him with a finger. Before the older man could finish though, he glanced over at John, who was still kneeling on the floor, cradling his hand to his stomach. John started to feel really stupid, sitting on the floor like a dog, waiting for his masters to come fetch him. He glared at Mycroft but before he could even think about standing up, the collar around his neck activated and John turned into a shaking heap on the floor. The pain was good, the pain cleared his mind, helped him focus so he wouldn’t be tricked into telling on his friends. “Bandage the wounds you caused and then bring him down for dinner, Sherlock. Don’t leave him alone this time.” With that, Mycroft exited the room, leaving John alone with the most manipulative Dom he’d ever met.
Sherlock crawled onto the bed, pulling the covers back, exposing his prize with a gleam in his eye. When he noticed John had a slight smile on his face, his cock hardened almost painfully fast. John wanted his lover even in his sleep, and Sherlock would never deny his boy what he craved. So, he straddled the thin hips, leaned back and began stoking himself over John.
Slowly, the thin but tall body above him lowered down so John could feel the other man’s heart through his chest now. He was amazed at how being squashed between Sherlock and the couch didn’t feel uncomfortable, especially when the hips above him slightly twitch, providing amazing friction for his aching cock. “Feels good doesn’t it?” Sherlock grinned, pulling his head back to look at John, who nodded shyly. No matter how fantastic it felt, there was no getting around the awkward feeling in his head that he was actually rubbing up against man for the first time in his life. “You can trust me, John, I won’t hurt you Ever.”
It was cloudy, but John didn’t mind, nor did he mind that his feet were still bare, because he got to feel the soft expertly cut grass below him. He hadn’t realized how much he missed being outside until this moment when all the memories of nights spent looking at the stars and sitting by a fire Mike made came rushing back. The feeling was strange to say the least, John thought, as he was walked to the car. It was so peaceful to be free and make his own choices, where he wanted to sleep, what he wanted to do, but at the same time it was nice to have a warm bed under him and to not have to worry about where he was going to get his next meal. “Watch your head,” Sherlock told him as a hand was placed on the top of his head.
John went out to grab takeaway not long after that strange conversation. He took a cab to Angelo's, fidgeting in his seat. The cabbie, in fact, asked him to stop, because he was being distracting to the driver.
Sherlock smirked, leaning down to press a kiss to John's jaw. "Probably satisfactory, considering she was away for nighttime, and an unusual amount of time the day before. But who knows?"
"Of course he can. He must have a plan, sowing doubts into people's heads the last twenty-four hours, wrapping lies in truth to make it more palatable, and, and..." Sherlock broke off.
John jerked awake when he heard Sherlock scream. "Darling, wake up." Sherlock didn't respond, and kept screaming, but the screaming made words.
Sherlock wouldn't look John in the eyes. Last time he'd tried the whole birthday party phenomenon, well, he, by anyone's account, failed completely and totally. Not that this John would know that, but still. "I did, well, tried to do a birthday celebration for him, and then realized I'd gotten the wrong date and didn't know how to bake anything edible. That was the day I decided to learn how to do this sort of thing, but by the time I could..."
"Hello, My." God, that nickname burned, even with the egregious amount of alcohol in Mycroft's system.
, John thought to himself. Sherlock really thought he was in the wrong here. He thought he'd come on strong and John had given in to his seduction. But giving in was easy, easier than anything John had ever done. There was no misunderstanding or awkward pauses, or fumbling for purchase. John had never gotten that in any relationship he'd ever had, and there had been
The man standing in front of John didn't look at all familiar. John wracked his brain for a reason he could know him. His hair was dark and haphazardly curly, his form was thin, his cheekbones were pronounced, and his eyes were clear blue-grey. He was beautiful, and it was so strange that the army doctor nearly had to step back. "Hello," John's fuzzy voice said. "Can I help you?"
"I could tell," John answered, a smirk dusting his features. He stood up. "Now, I need to get dressed. If you want your violin, you should grab it now. The music will be gone if you don't." Sherlock tried to disguise how fast he left the flat to find it.
"You were right. He thinks it's Mycroft." The moment Mycroft picked that up on the bug, he immediately zoomed in and found John walking farther into an abandoned building. He, in fact, was in his office, enjoying a cup of Anthea-brewed tea.
Molly gently smacked her upside the head. "Harriet wants to see you. If she wanted to divorce you, why would she come back here, the last place she knew you worked, every single day, looking for you? She would have given up and just called you if she wanted something stupid."
Harry made a beckoning gesture, turning to sit on her bed. Sherlock, wearing only a sheet, sat on the chair across from her bed. "Alright, what the hell happened last night? Please explain in
"Look him up. Rich Brook is an actor, and actor he hired to be Moriarty!" She pointed at Sherlock as if condemning him.
"Alright, now here's when it gets strange. Mid-November, he sounds far more hopeful and mentions someone named Sherlock Holmes. But he doesn't remember you. That's so unnatural, because Johnny remembers everyone he meets, and you are pretty hard to forget."
"...You shouldn't forgive me, but at least try to understand that I'm sorry and I love you, and I'll take anything you can give me."
Sherlock shook his head. "No. Besides, I'd ask him to marry me before we ever thought about adopting."
John did something entirely unexpected right then. He walked up to Sherlock and handed him one. "Sherlock and I are going to play a drinking game. And since Sherlock is bored, it will be beneficial for everyone."
Molly grabbed her hand and yanked her back. "Don't. You love each other, and you both really can't function well without each other."
He rarely regretted putting his priorities in that order, since staying the most intelligent and taking care of Sherlock were very close competitors, but sometimes, he was completely and utterly wrong. Not that he would ever admit that.
The detective wiggled around a little in John's arms. "Mm. I don't want it to be morning. Mornings are boring. Nights are not."
He wasn't sure how he could answer that so John wouldn't know anything but also be truthful. "Shut up."
Well, that was a new concept. "Who stole my big bro's memories? He was obviously miserable without you, dead or alive, so we need to get them back."
The ride took a long time, and yet not enough time, and the two were dropped off in front of a red restaurant awning. "This is one of my favorite places to eat," Sherlock said, "when I actually feel like eating, which is rare."
Sherlock huffed. "I was only gone one of those years. Recently. Mycroft gave me a job. Involved destroying a very dangerous criminal organization. But during the year
"It's only logical," Sherlock breathed, his voice hitching. "I asked you to do this as an experiment, and I was never supposed to love you. I'm sorry my feelings got in the way of the original purpose, they were never meant to."
Clara wasted no time asking Harry out and remembering how to sleep. She did both things before her conscious thoughts could catch up.
Eventually, though sheer stubbornness, John hooked his small hand around Sherlock's bony elbow. He reeled in his long arm like a swordfish. Sliding his hand down the length of Sherlock's forearm, John cinched his wrist in a death grip. Containing his lover's flailing felt tenuous, but years of training had left John's arms strong. He just had to wait Sherlock out. The man had biceps thin as string beans
"Bastard!" John twisted, catching the last sliver of white skin ere it vanished. He pricked his ears in horror, tracking Sherlock's path by his crashing up the stairs two-by-two. "Mrs. Hudson! Think of Mrs. Hudson!" He smashed his face into sweated soaked linens, his face brightening from pink to fierce, blazing crimson. "Ergh, you're going to give her a stroke!"
"Influenza, Sherlock? Can we go back to that?" John whispered. Between the pitch black space of the bedroom and a potent narcotic (two pills, screw the prescription) running in his veins, John felt weightless and floaty. Having this terrible conversation in the dark was definitely one of his better ideas.
"Please...yes. Oh God, yes. You can have me, I'll give you everything. Anything you want, just don't stop!" The little man's head flopped forward heavily, landing on Sherlock's taut chest. The genius accommodated to support John's weight, face stretched in a cheshire grin. Sherlock felt satisfyingly vindicated. "The Virgin", a coldhearted oddity, had sent John swooning.
The Sherlock Greg knew opted to spar with his intellect. Physical violence was such a predictable and pedestrian affair, a waste of his valuable time.
"If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore." - Sigmund Freud
"John. Before you...before we first met," he amended, "people were nothing to me but an irritating distraction from The Work. Emotions, sentiment, what have you, held no interest. There's no logic to love, I believed, and therefore, love had no use. I didn't go looking for something I didn't want or need. That would be a waste of my time."
"Report? Shit, yeah, that's right! Neither one of you fuckers has bothered to tell me what happened," John snorted with derision, soundly smacking his thighs. "So what happened? Who beat up who? And...wait. Greg. Why aren't you
Greg waved him off with a snort, albeit, a muted one. "Nothing doing. Apologies aren't my first priority right now. And at any rate, in my department at least, broken noses are par for the course. No. No, what I'm really interested in hear - "
He had tried, he really had, to forget. But, some memories are etched in one's soul. Sherlock never forgot. Sherlock never forget many things from the last hellish three years. And, he'd eventually have to take off his shirt.
"Right. Sorry, I'm not trying to be condescending, or in any way indicate that you are a substandard physi-"
Sherlock had skipped dinner the previous night, standing vigil in the hospital waiting room. At any rate, his hands had been clean of any sweet or savory substance. Therefore, John was commenting on the taste of his
His bladder was calling. Just peachy. Manhandling his leg to the floor, John clutched his crutches. "One the count of three. One...two...
"...with the coming of weapons, superior brains began to oust brute force, but the object of the conflict remained the same: one party was to be constrained, by the injury done him or impairment of his strength, to retract a claim or a refusal. This end is most effectively gained when the opponent is definitely put out of action — in other words, is killed. This procedure has two advantages: the enemy cannot renew hostilities, and, secondly, his fate deters others from following his example....Paradoxical as its sounds, we must admit that warfare well might serve to pave the way to that unbroken peace we so desire..." - Sigmund Freud, from a written correspondence with Albert Einstein regarding the concepts of humanity, violence, and establishment of peace. (www.brainpickings.org)
This is the second half of the following chapter that wasn't ready for submission when AO3 thought that it was.
John scrubbed his face dry with a forearm, dismissing the foul taste on his tongue. He needed to get himself sorted
"You aren't going to hell, John! For Christ's sa - . For Jesus...Mother of...oh bollocks. Just get in here and snog me, already!"
Just in time, heavy footsteps clomped up the stairs; heavy, exhausted feet weighed down by the woes of the world. DI Lestrade, to the rescue. Eight years of acquaintance had stripped most social niceties between the detectives. John afforded a bit more courtesy, but not much. They'd been through the nine circles of hell together, and bloody Christ, coming back had been almost as difficult. Needless to say, Greg stormed into the flat with nary a knock or a word. He had a case for his friend and associate. A case that would keep them up nights.
It was during their brief détente that Greg heard an oddly monotone hum. Turning, he tracked the odd sound back to Sherlock. The buzzing sounds, were in fact, Sherlock's voice. The detective's taut lips twitched as he spit out an inaudible stream of invective. Sherlock's words, if words they were, were muttered too softly to hear. Lestrade bit his bottom lip and cautiously inched a bit closer.
Unfortunately, the detective's amended position also concealed his expression, eclipsed as he was by the light. John understand that Sherlock had changed positions on purpose.
Crimson drew up from the base of John's neck up to the tips of each ear. "That's very...generous of you. But, hardly necessary. Go bother Lestrade for some cold cases, if you must. Or bug Molly. I'm sure she's saved some lovely eyeballs or a lung just for you. Maybe a bladder,
going to be quite uncomfortable for the foreseeable future. Well, at least when sitting down on his backside. "That's because you are a bloody pain in the arse. You mad wanker, what am I ever going to do with you?"
The language itself sounded familiar, similar to Russian, so maybe Polish? No, not quite it. But, ah...Greg had it now. Sherlock was speaking in Croatian, or possibly Bosnian; definitely a Slavic tongue. He should know, after all. The family upstairs generally kept to English, saving Croatian for their ear-piercing rows. Yet, despite Greg begrudging exposure, this was best an educated guess. It went without saying, although he'd surely said it at one time or another...foreign languages weren’t his division.
Let's begin with my feisty little hedgehog, John Watson. He is a military man, a defender of innocents. He's a healer, social interpreter, and stout-hearted best friend. John's lip is so stiff I'm shocked that he doesn't drool when he drinks. The man is pathologically polite, as well - even with Sherlock. As far as standing in queues is concerned, John was enlisted in the military. Enough said.
"Of course. Yes, John. I want to remove my trousers - and pants, naturally. Just not my, em, shirt."
Yes, it was true, they'd opened a joint bank account to pay for their living expenses. He and Sherlock took turns picking up take-out and milk. The flat they inhabited contained a single en suite, one table, and a set of mismatched but comfortable arm chairs. The day they'd met was just the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Simple as jam on toast. The one issue of contention - besides smelly, dripping body parts, was the "borrowing" of John's personal laptop.
A pretty, pink flush now stained the whole of his cheek. John waited, afraid to say anything that might hinder Sherlock's recovery. The little man sat, and waited, and watched. Sherlock lifted his head. He proceeded to uncurl his arms, straighten his spine, and stick out his chin like a soldier.
Yet, it was John's reaction that had shaken the detective's fragile mental health. Mycroft had worried
In direct opposition to his words, Sherlock tucked his head into the meat of his shoulder; hiding his face like a child. The detective's thin arms folded around his torso, posed much like an upside-down pretzel. His massive hands clung each opposite shoulder in a definitive, warding-off gesture.
of his friend's heart against his back. Sherlock was panicking, and John didn't know why. "I'm okay," he said mildly, patting Sherlock's arm with his hand. "Just give me a mo'."
close to his special places, so sensitive that John thought he might explode despite his cock not yet even been touched.
Lestrade told his brain to shut it. He desperately needed to think. True, the Sherlock Holmes that he had known eschewed fisticuffs except for self-defence, but
The DI snarled into the mouthpiece. "You'd better have something good to tell me, Dimmock. I'm in the middle of something important." Sherlock shot Lestrade a confused, side-long glance.
Never mind. By this point in the proceedings, John had foregone all sense of propriety. As such, he flaunted his arse, spine splendidly arched in a precise 48.7 degree angle.
Sherlock wiggled, feeling the gentle press of John's glans nudging him open. It was far too gentle for his liking. Not enough base animal need, which he knew full well that John possessed.
Sherlock's face paled. He felt embarrassed, and petrified, and unbearably ashamed of his actions. Snapshot images flashed before his eyes: Lestrade gawping as he rambled on in Serbian, and then, Holy Jesus Christ, landing a blow. Sherlock wanted nothing more at this point, than to crumble up and die, turning to dust.
"Right. Back to playing Mr. Mysterious, and still so early in the day," the DI sniped. "It had crossed my mind that something's off between you two. You both seemed, I don't know...a tad stressed when I came by." Sherlock's compulsion to fidget was catching, and Lestrade bit through the tip of his thumb nail. He studied the abused digit glumly, spitting splintered nail from his mouth. "Frankly, he looked right pissed off."
Before anything, however, John needed to put aside his own issues. A busted-up ankle was small potatoes, a trifle. His behavior engendered deep shame. He had to set his focus on the things he had the ability to do. He absorbed Sherlock's words and allowed them to marinate.
"Well. I couldn't hide this forever, now could I? To have one thing, I had to share the other. And you still are avoiding the topic of your three years without my...scintillating presence," Sherlock nudged.
"Ha! Not quite. That's a story for another time. But now," John cooed, "Would you like me to take over and show you what I know?"
"Yeah...that. I'd hoped that my long days of limping were over." He scanned Sherlock's face without turning his head. John's colorless lashes concealed the deep blue of his eyes. "I'm sorry to say that I'm not going to be much use to you for the next several months, at the least."
"Quite. Now shut up. Not only are you cynical, but you keep budging in. Let me finish," the detective scowled. "This is as awkward enough as it is!"
Just a note about the the foul-mouthed American. I try to use British slang accurately, although I am not sure if I do or not. Anyway, it was fun just to let my Americanisms fly without having to think about it too hard.
"John! John, wake up! It's okay!" Sherlock snapped, shaking himself free of his reverie. John gave no response other than to increase the intensity of his thrashing. Sherlock groaned, slapping a hand to his forehead. He knew from hard won experience (and several deep purple bruises) that waking John via touch was not on.
"Jesus," John groaned. "That was far more difficult that it should have been. Sherlock, can you look at me, please?" Sherlock blinked wildly and bit his bottom lip hard. Two seconds later, a small bead of red blood trickled down from under his clenched teeth. "Oh, love! Bloody... Jesus, Sherlock!" Giving up all hope of having a rational and reassuring conversation, John wrapped his arms around Sherlock and held tight.
"And by 'destroyed', I mean just that," Greg scratched his stubble. "He lost his job at the surgery because he stopped going in. Uh, as well, John developed a bit of a drinking habit. Okay, it was more than a
Sherlock lunged forward and gripped both of John's forearms. His hands clutched John so tightly they caused more than a little discomfort. The pain didn't even register. John just let Sherlock squeeze and squeeze, cutting off the circulation to his hands. His fingers throbbed with the mounting pressure of trapped blood; yet, all John could think about was how lucky he was that this marvelous man still living - in their flat, in his life, on the planet.
Greg struggled to downplay the injury, nervous of triggering a third...episode, but this was Sherlock observing him. Fat chance of that happening, yeah?
...sex. Well-paid valets and voyeurs. High-priced harlots, sent stumbling out through the manor's back gate. Orgies raged in crumbling factories, poppers standing in for hors d'oeuvres. And at the very bottom of the barrel oozed bad BDSM etiquette, like so much sludge, if one liked - which John didn't. Hold the ball gag and chains, please, John's plate's full-up with xHamster.
The doctor nodded, seemingly amused. "I've gotten complaints from each single girlfriend about how my sweat made their bedding go rank."
"John, that's my point. That's precisely why I'm putting this on you. We already know what I want; I believe that I made myself clear," Sherlock stated, eyebrows lost under his fringe. "So the question is, what do you want, John? That's what I want to know."
"Sherlock..." John groaned. "I wish you had told me. I could only speculate on what happened during your time away, but then, I didn't really ask about it when you came back, did I?" He pinched the bridge of his nose with his fingers, whispering "I'm so fucking sorry I didn't see it, your suffering. It must have been right there in front of me. I thought you were being a prat."
yes," Sherlock panted. "I'm ready for you, love. I'm so ready!" He withdrew his fingers, eyes honed in on his partner. The detective spared a quick glance towards his slick, sticky hand, and he grimaced.

"Jaawwwn..." Sherlock's peevish complaint came out muffled, his head burrowed beneath 1800 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets. "Stop bouncing about on the...honestly, John! You're going to fall, which will only serve to annoy me." The detective paused to smother a yawn. "I've absolutely no intention of hauling you back to A&E. First of all, I'd have to get dressed. Secondly, stop trying to leave me. In fact, come back here at once. I am nowhere
"John," Sherlock murmured eventually, lightly touching John's hair, "tell me what you are thinking."
John's feelings had muddied the waters. The doctor no longer knew who he was. Sherlock, (at least he was the last time John had picked splinters out of his arse), was a man; not a woman, a
Consider this. When John kills the cabbie, one of the first questions out of Sherlock's mouth is "Are you alright? After all, you have just killed a man." He asks Irene Adler a similar question after pistol-whipping an CIA operative. And she's a dominatrix! WTF, Sherlock?
Sherlock fingered the planes of John's eager face, limned rosy gold in the light. Without stopping his ministrations, the little man twisted to press his gilded cheek into Sherlock's cupped palm. John's action resembled that of a feisty ginger cat in need of a scratch. The strands of sliver threaded through John's ashy blonde hair glimmered which each turn of his head. John Watson, the man cast in silver and gold.
Reeling in each other's warmth, John whispered sweet nothings and combed strong, sturdy fingers through Sherlock's curls. The doctor's muscles and shoulder joint burned; supporting both their weight took some effort. Nevertheless, John viewed his discomfort immaterial; therefore, not worthy of consideration. His old injury twinged in fretful resentment, in spite of the ex-soldier's dismissal. All sorts of misery were about to be revealed, so why not revisit a bullet to the shoulder? John stiffened, fighting the ache, before advising his old injury to kindly bugger off. The little man's soothing movements continued unabated, for what seemed like a very long time.
ill?" He reached up, slapping a palm against Sherlock's forehead, scrutinizing two absolutely bloodshot, red-rimmed gorgeous silvered eyes.
Sherlock moaned whilst exposing more neck. "Oh, John. Now, you can shut up. Just keep...oh god, doing what you are doing. Oh, my god..."  A hot, red flush crept up from his chest and tinged at the tips of his ears.
He loved how quickly Sherlock always responded to his texts, like he dropped everything just so he could talk to John.
It took him no time at all to stumble into the corner, his thighs still felt like jelly but he supported himself by propping his head against the wall. He didn’t like it, it was too exposing and made John feel vulnerable to have his back turned to the entire room, especially now that a new addition was about to be made. The thought was horrible but John prayed that it would only be Sherlock coming to get him and perform whatever experiments he wanted.
“Okay,” John said meekly. John didn’t know if he completely trusted Mycroft and Greg, but what they said did have some merit. If other Doms reacted like Sherlock, then they would be in a whole world of hurt.
“Oh, don’t be daft, John,” Sherlock waved him off, then, a mischievous look came to his silver eyes. “Come back over here and I’ll tell you,” he winked, making John grin and roll his eyes. He didn’t have time for thinking about what happened last night. What Sherlock did was idiotic, but his intentions behind it…well, they were good, right?
I was in a really good mood these past couple of weeks, so here is a bit more fluff you everyone :) The next chapter will get down to business and start off a new plot twist, so enjoy this while it lasts. LoL.
“Hey, it was just an accident. You were scared, that’s all, and it’s already happened so now all we can do is take care of the aftermath, yeah?”
“Ha, are you kidding me? I’m great but well tired now, thanks for that.” The boy said laughing again as Sherlock watched him get up to change his clothes. The detective was quiet while he watched the oblivious boy strip out of his soiled clothes, searching for a fresh pair long enough for the man to get a good view of the tight cheeks that would be his soon enough.
“That is none of your business, John. And I will ask you to not bring this up to Anthea again. She is very busy and does not have time for your teenage meddling.”
“Good morning,” Mycroft said, looking up from his bagel. His arm was out of its sling, but he still held it to his body, protecting it. He looked over John and Sherlock carefully, until finally, he approved and nodded his head. “It will need to be a quick breakfast. Lestrade will be here in five minutes.”
“I’ll do my best,” John said, because he would do his best to behave in front of all the pretentious Doms. Could he do it? Well, that was another matter entirely.
“I know he is,” Mycroft laughed, looking up at Greg, who shrugged at the truth. “But it’s okay to be worried about someone you care for, right?”
“John!” he shouted and ran over to the blonde teenager, gripping him in a tight hug. “I’m so glad you’re okay. I was so worried.” He pulled back to look at the slightly taller boy, his face turning from happy to sad in an instant. “I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry, John.”
“John, calm your breathing down,” Sherlock said, walking back over to sit down next to him. He put his palm on the Sub’s shoulder, and immediately, John felt warmth spread throughout his back, causing him to slow his breathing.
After two more days, John and Sherlock were both discharged. John was excited to go home until he realized their home had been blown up by the Resistance. “Where are we going to go?” he asked, as Mycroft signed release papers.
“We’re not faulty!” John challenged and pulled up his pants. The boy wiped his eyes dry so he could glare up at Sherlock.
“That is unacceptable John!” Sherlock actually shouted, kicking the foot of the tub, causing water to splash onto the floor. Possessive drive took over his fingers as they typed back to his boy.
The boy shook his head quickly, still shaking from Irene’s earlier words. “Now take him home,” John said, sounding years older than he actually was.
His youth, inexperience, and the fact an older boy was thinking about him while jerking off made John shoot off like a rocket. “Holy fuck!” He groaned looking down at the light white come all over his shirt, “damn it.”
“Someone was excited this morning,” Sherlock said, rolling over to lie on his back and fixing John with a sly grin. “You humped my back for two minutes and thirty four seconds.”
He nodded his head, but still strained slightly to get to the offered leg. The dark hairs on the human’s leg were standing on end, waiting for the predator to strike.
“That’s bullshit and you know it.” Of course Mycroft knew. He had planned the whole damn thing. Greg knew what happened, but how was a different question all together. Did he see John and him at the mart? Was John’s phone tapped? Was his? Greg’s head began pounding again with the different scenarios running rampant through it. He squinted his eyes together until Mycroft finally took pity on him.
“Shut up!” John shouted, trying to pull away from the man and make him apologize for talking about his Sherlock that way. He didn’t know, couldn’t know, who Sherlock really was, not like him at least. Greg only tightened his grip and sighed.
Grabbing the man’s neck, John held him up, his eyes rolling back and truing to black coals and his teeth extending. “Now who’s brilliant,” John growled, using his other hand to pin Sherlock’s. He didn’t, however, see the needle out of the corner of his eye.
“Who shot Moriarty, Sherlock? I need to know,” he pulled out his phone, ready to tell Lestrade the next step if John truly was the shooter.
Mycroft turned, looking him right in the eye and shoved a threatening finger in his chest. “You listen to me Sherlock Holmes, I know you blocked his calls to his mother, which I understand, but you will not,” he jabbed his finger in harder to make his point clear, “I repeat, you will NOT, block his calls if he needs to contact me. So help me Sherlock, if you harm that boy or forbid him from contacting me for anything! I will castrate you and put an end to this drug you so desperately need a hit from. Do you understand me, brother mine?”
“You really want to stay a contracted Liberator for the rest of your life? Honestly Sherlock, what would Mummy say?”
“You son of a bitch,” John growled, holding the back of his neck. When he pulled his hand back around it was completely covered in blood. Whether from seeing the blood or losing the it, John didn’t know, but soon he started to feel light headed.
Sherlock had a wide smile on his face, but there was also fear in his silver eyes as he looked up at John. “You smell…you smell so good,” John breathed, sniffing and nuzzling the human’s neck. John used his other hand to turn and hold Sherlock’s head to the side, completely restraining his prey.
Using his superior strength, John lifted the man over his shoulder and went out to hail a cab. When one finally arrived, John put the passed out stranger in the car with a pat to the head. “Take him here,” John showed the cabbie the address, “and make sure he gets in okay,” he said, handing over double the amount it would have cost for a ride.
As they headed downstairs, John started to panic. The last time anybody tried to remove his collar, John had almost bled out. Of course, it was a mad man who ripped it out of his spine, but still. “Do…Do I really have to do this?” John asked.
John smiled slightly, remembering how he’d woken up back in the Pipes with his pants on his head and his undershirt pulled over his legs like trousers. “Good, okay, so I want you to throw them in the yard only, not inside the house. Aim for trees or bushes that will go up in smoke quickly, yeah?” The two nodded at him solemnly, “then shout ‘fire’ as loud as you can, only once or twice though, and then run as fast as you can back here. The fire department and probably IBAD are going to show up within ten minutes so we all need to be out of there fast.”
“You’re alright, Sherlock. You’re alright,” Mycroft assured him, though he knew his brother was anything by alright. “Do you remember what happened to you?”
“Son,” Mycroft spoke, moving his arm to slowly push John behind him, “lower the gun.” It was amazing how much bliss was rolling off Mycroft. John was almost to the point of lying down and basking in it, when Jim continued to yell.
John opened his eyes to see a white shirt in front of his face. It took him a few extra moments for the realization to flow like molasses through his brain. “Mycroft?” he asked, and was proud he was even able to articulate that in the state he was in.
“What visitor?” Mycroft grabbed his shoulder when they were half way up the stairs. “Did Jim come visit you, Sherlock?”
“No, you listen to me Mr. Holden, my brother’s incarceration nor my relationship to him has any correlation to my ability to do my job. Now if you will excuse me, I have some work to do keeping Britain safe. Good day, sir,” Mycroft slammed the phone down, pinching the bridge of his nose tightly as if he could stop the blood flow to his brain and end the torment. It was the thirteenth phone call he’d received after Sherlock’s ten year sentence had become public knowledge. Most, if not all, were appalled at the tarnished reputation of the ‘Holmes’ name.
John wakes up in the Holmes' estate and learns why Mycroft and Sherlock haven't turned him over to the auction houses.
John laughed at the question purposed by the hunter. Why? Sherlock had no idea. All the young vampire knew was the blood was starting to fade away, making his cock slowly deflate. “Sherlock, you’ve been very, very good. I’m so proud of you,” John said, a slanted smile coming across his face. “I believe it is time for your reward.”
He tried to care, he really did, but God did he feel good right now. Then, a knock interrupted his high. “Grrr,” he actually growled. Slowly standing up, he didn’t even bother to put his trousers back on, but he did however, tuck himself back in his pants.
It felt nice, the water washing away the grim on his skin but his body still felt gross and tired. John watched as the red water flowed down into the drain and he could feel Sherlock behind him, thrusting into him as he saw his own blood float into the drain.
Now, he needed to touch, “may I wash you?” he asked and was met with a small nod. Moving as slowly as his lust would let him, Sherlock poured some bath soap into his palm and began rubbing into the smooth tan skin. He placed his hand on the back of his John’s neck, ensure the boy wouldn’t try to pull away in this moment of first real contact. He moved the soap all over the young body, meandering down until he rested just at John’s pelvic bone. Dipping his hand a few inches lower, Sherlock began tickling and playing with the small hairs, teasing the boy in his grasp, until John dropped his head on the man’s chest in surrender.
“Good!” Greg said, smiling and leaning back in his chair. “They want to interview you in front of the old estate. It’s still has walls missing and scorch marks, so it make a nice back drop for their cameras. Damn vultures.”
“I just…I need a break,” both men sighed, one in defeat while the other was content at a solid but unsatisfying victory.
“John, stop it! Calm down son,” the same voice shouted at him, gasping loudly when John kicked him in the shin because he wouldn’t let him through. There was something around him now, a vice, a rope, arms, it was arms that looped around him and pulled him back from 221B.
“I’m fine, Jim,” John said, sitting up a bit and wincing from the pain in his side and foot. “I’m just glad you’re okay, mate.”
On a whim, Sherlock picked up the naked boy, carrying him over to their bed. “Hey, I can walk you know,” the teen scoffed but they both knew he didn’t mean it.
They went through a door to enter a room that John only saw in his nightmares. It was similar to a dog kennel; in fact, it was exactly like a dog kennel with bigger cages. There were rows and rows of metal cages with naked Subs, young and old. Whines and cries filled the air, as did a stench of sweat and fear as the Subs waited for their time to come.
“Yours?” John asked, surprise and distain in his voice. Honestly, Sherlock had no idea why he said John was ‘his,’ it just sounded right. After all, he did catch him, he did chain him to his bed, he did perform ground breaking experiments with him, and he even tried to feed him. John technically was his now, whether the vampire liked it or not.
It was hard though, especially when he was flipped over onto his stomach while people worked on the back of his neck. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” a woman’s voice came from behind him, “what were these barbs attached to?”
