Sherlock goes silent, sorting through his thoughts.
And of course, this all exists thanks to Chalsedony (tumblr user Addictedstilltheaddict) whose prompt got this entire thing started. I hope you've been entertained by the ride, my darling!
The robber shakes his head and gives Sherlock a contemptuous sneer, raises the gun to point it squarely between Sherlock’s eyes. His eyes are hard, but his hand quivers just a fraction. “That may be true,” he says. “But I don’t give a fuck about shooting
is welcome to tag along?”
“No?” John echoes, inflection rising in query.
"The choice of an abandoned cargo ship was deliberate," Sherlock says. "I took the chance that her condition would make the smells and the motion of the ship close to unbearable, and I was correct. It disabled her enough to give you plenty of time to act."
“You actually are, though,” John murmurs. Damn it, he’s on the brink of falling asleep again. “Juice would be lovely. Thank you.”
“Take good care of her, all right?” John says, his voice rough and thick.
“Think we’ll ever come back?”
As if on cue, a startling screech of siren goes off somewhere behind them, making John jump in his seat. He and Sherlock turn in unison to see a cavalcade of flashing lights commence, along with a variety of carnival noises as a winning jackpot pours forth an avalanche of jangling metal, the coins cascading onto the carpet at the feet of a tiny, whey-skinned, late-middle-aged woman who frankly looks rather more terrified than happy at this turn of events.
“Yes, mother,” Sherlock grumbles, but he complies, stowing the weapon back in his jacket.
He opens an empty text message window and pauses, thinking of all the things he wanted say to John over the past year and couldn’t. Now that John’s here and he can tell him anything he wants, any time, somehow everything he can think of in this moment sounds clumsy and overwrought and hideously embarrassing.
“Patricia,” he says, calm and direct. “You have to breathe for me, okay? Deep breath in through your nose, out your mouth.”
Then the stupid, horrible, romance-hating cabbie honks his horn impatiently, breaking the spell. John lets him go, pulls back and smiles at him. Sherlock’s heart is pounding. He’s breathless. He’s grinning like an idiot and it’s ridiculous and he’s desperately in love and it’s the best moment of his entire life.
“Forget it,” Sherlock finally says, taking the shirt and tossing it in the general direction of the flannel. “It will wash out. Come here.” He collapses back onto the comforter, pulling John down with him, wrapping a long arm around his shoulders. John sighs, nestling his smaller frame against Sherlock’s torso.
Sherlock doesn’t answer.
“Cuddle?”
John finally makes a decision early on a Monday evening, after dinner goes ignored and a strained, tense silence finally grows unbearable.
Sherlock is at a bit of a loss. “Well,” he mutters. “Yes. Thank you for your input, I suppose.”
“Well,” he says, a touch hesitant, “to be honest I don’t have anything in at home, so if you’re sure--”
“I’ve no doubt you could,” Sherlock replies, “but we’ve pushed the limits of the DIY approach, don’t you think?”
Sherlock offers him a steadying hand. John glares daggers at him.
“I love you,” Sherlock breathes into his mouth between gasps of pleasure. “God, John, yes. I love you I love you I love you. I’ve always loved you.”
Sherlock reaches into his jacket pocket with his unoccupied left hand, pulls out a dark grey USB drive.
The woman --
A red flashing danger sign begins going off in John’s frustrated and tired brain.
“What do you want?” John breathes into his ear. “Anything. You can have anything. Just tell me.”
“Come here.” John pulls him up hard by his hair, hauling him into his lap. Sherlock struggles awkwardly to comply, knees aching, half-asleep lower legs a shower of pins and needles. John brusquely arranges the long length of his body across his knees, legs resting on the bed on John’s left side, his elbows and forearms to the right, arse over his lap.
“Oh you absolute fucker,” John mumbles into Sherlock’s ribcage. “You put the Valium in my tea, didn’t you?”
After several minutes of wet, desperate kissing John breaks away for air, breathing hard, his pupils dilated and huge in the low light. “I want to do something, pet,” he whispers, stroking Sherlock’s hair. “It’s something I’ve thought about for a long time.” He hesitates for several moments, searching for the right words.
he’s skilled at hiding the fact. It is Sherlock Holmes, however, so balance of probability states he’s not concealing a damn thing from the most observant man on the planet. At the moment, though, Sherlock is still pale and glassy eyed, exhaustion clearly sapping him of his prodigious abilities, and for that John is momentarily grateful.
“Oh but you
John vaguely recalls meeting him before.
Sherlock gives him a look of unvarnished scepticism.
Sherlock pulls something out of his coat pocket, holds it out towards John. “It’s me with my brother. I remember it. We had a picnic, on a flat rock by the river. It was hot. Mycroft had a tennis ball. He threw it in the water and Redbeard chased it.” Sherlock gazes at him, his eyes beseeching, asking John for something he can’t give. “John. I
Sitting in the back of a cab, Sherlock decides the whole thing makes him feel very uncomfortable and he’d rather not think about it any longer. Instead, he retreats to his mind palace, deleting piles of useless information (political structures of feudal Japan, the spread of Black Death along trans-Asian trade routes) in order to make more room to catalogue every single moment he’s spent with John since his return.
At some point in these ruminations, Sherlock has begun to stir under the intense, laser-like scrutiny. He opens one eye, clear and deep as the Aegean Sea--again, just fucking
John looks at Sherlock, really looks at him, and knows he has never seen anything so beautiful in his entire life.
“Sherlock, what the
John picks up his head slightly, gives him a quizzical look through his sniffles.
“Just...just. Give us a minute?” John ask, his voice coming out in far too much like a humiliating squeak.
But the line has already gone dead.
“Right to bed with you, I think,” Sherlock murmurs. John nods in sleepy acquiescence. Sherlock opens his mouth as if to say something else but then hesitates, looks away for a moment, then glances back, an uncertain expression on his face. “The bed upstairs is made up, if you’d rather, but I’d…” He swallows, glances at the floor. “If it’s all right with you, I’d prefer if you stayed down here. So I could, you know, be here if you needed anything. But if that’s not okay, of course you can--"
“I’ll get you some clothes,” John says, carefully neutral, and turns away to fetch Sherlock’s bag. He digs through the layers of clothing and toiletries, locating clean pants, toothbrush and toothpaste. He takes them into the ensuite; Sherlock is mercifully ensconced behind the shower curtain, lines of his body obscured by the ivory and beige patterned fabric.
Somehow I have managed to finish this chapter, however please let me know if you spot any mistakes or errors in syntax.
“Don’t laugh at this,” John began, trying to gain some sense of clarity so he could find the words, “but I think I’ll remember this day for the rest of my life.”
“Aren’t you getting married in, like, two weeks?” she replied, folding her arms and frowning at him. “I thought you and Mary would be well loved up.”
Also:
John paused, feeling dumbstruck at the exquisite creature in front of him. “Have I told you how happy you make me?” John whispered.
“I’m actually going for a
Sherlock whined, deep in his throat as John twisted his hand around underneath his cock and through to his ass, where his finger settled itself over his hole, gently stroking him. He seemed to be lost in ecstasy, high off John’s scent and amour. His lips crashed into John’s, seeking out his mouth and pushing his tongue inside, moaning as he did so. John could have listened to the depraved sounds Sherlock was making for the rest of eternity.
“What are you doing?” John asked quizzically as Sherlock began untying his shoelaces, pulling off his shoe and placing it on the floor behind him.
"Yes, I do love him." John finally answered. "But I haven't seen or heard from Sherlock. It's over, Harry, and holding onto that isn't going to do me any good. I love Mary - she's good for me."
The wind was bitter and cold, a sign that autumn was nearly in full force, and Sherlock’s nose was shaded with a rosy pink. John had a sudden urge to kiss it, but knew he wouldn’t dare for fear of someone he knew spotting him do it in such an open space that wasn’t very far from his home.
“Oh, no … Mary, no.” John protested, half-heartedly pulling away from her.
“What’s new?” John answered. He pulled his phone out and grimaced at the notification of a missed call from Mary – right now all the needed was a stiff drink, even if it was only 9am.
"I'm not making the same mistake as them," John answered, sure in his words. "I love Mary."
John woke, suddenly aware of the fact that he was in an unfamiliar bed. He blinked into the darkness, his eyes slowly becoming accustomed, remembering he was, in fact, in Sherlock’s bed. Reaching out beside him, he felt the cool spot where Sherlock should be lying, but wasn’t.
. And, he hated to admit, he was bloody bored of it. Sighing, John switched off the light in the bathroom and made his way down the hall to his bedroom.
the coffee table like a normal person, he smoothly stepped on top of and over it and came to stop in front of John, snatching the canvas and turning it around so John couldn’t look anymore. “Yes. It is you,” he retorted, “it’s not finished. And some might consider it
when she sees you."
“Yeah … thanks.” John didn’t hide his distaste for her.
The music began to swell gradually, a simple piano playing out into the room, before a soft voice trilled out of the speakers.
“I-I’m sorry,” John backtracked immediately. Sherlock’s reaction said it all. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that. It was too much too soon. I just-“
“No, but it is what it is.” Sherlock echoed John’s words that he had spoken only minutes earlier, trying desperately to quell the quiet sobs that were escaping from John’s throat.
They eventually stopped on the fifth floor and Harriet led the way to a room, where John found her usual chaos that she seemed to carry with her everywhere. Her laptop was lying open on the floor in front of the bed with a mess of paper surrounding it, and on the small counter top was a few days worth of empty takeaway boxes and empty cans of beer.
“Sussex,” John sighed. It was now or never. “I … I have to go there on Sunday. Help out.”
The robber strides over to the head teller, who lay prone on the marble floor next to Sherlock.
“It’s hot,” Sherlock counters. "And may I remind you, haven’t left these four rooms in weeks. I’ll sleep naked wherever I damn well please.”
He briefly considers burning it down, but he doesn’t want to inconvenience the neighbors quite that much. Instead he decides to make tea, rising to get a mug out of the cupboard.
Sherlock is silent for a moment, and John knows his thoughts are running in a similar vein.
“He’s providing us with valuable information,” John says, which is factually true.
John has just one final set of affairs to see to before this entire nightmare can be declared fully over, put behind them, placed firmly in the past forever and for good.
John’s notification tone chirps.
“Shut up, berk,” John grumbles without heat, waving off the hand Sherlock offers. “This is your fault, remember."
(It’s true. Shortly after quitting the surgery, a six-figure sum had appeared in his bank account, along with a missive hand-delivered by one of Mycoft’s minions, indicating that the funds were a reward from the Americans for the capture and return of the woman John knew as Mary Morstan. John didn’t particularly believe it, but he didn’t refuse the money either. It would have been pointless to try, anyway, as Mycroft Holmes refuses to comprehend the concept of 'no' as an answer.)
“Sherlock.” John picks up his head a little. “Between what Maria told us and learning about Johnson...you already know all about the people that have her, don’t you?”
They’re in bed after a long day of not much at all. John puttered around the flat, spending the morning engaging in some much needed tidying of the kitchen cabinets and counters before putting a new washer on the dripping tap, then in the afternoon finally unboxing the few mementos he had brought with him from the townhouse and finding a home for each item.
“First things first,” John said, reaching to the countertop and retrieving the glass of ice water. “Drink some of this,” he said firmly as he held the glass to Sherlock’s lips. “You’re very dehydrated.” Sherlock opened his mouth obediently and drank.
grunt, with a rising inflection.
Sherlock nods. “All right,” he murmurs, and he’s beginning to sound more than just a little drunk, and very drowsy on top of that.
John could accept the ill-treatment. He absolutely didn’t like it; they had, for the most part, moved on to a point where unintentional rudeness was tolerated (Sherlock was, after all, Sherlock), but outright nastiness was no longer part of landscape. But John felt keenly how badly Sherlock was hurting, so he accepted it, let it wash over him.
The baby stirs, fussing a little.
“I like… I think I would like to know how it feels when you hit me. I mean, in that context.” he turns his head further, speaking against the warm skin of John’s ribcage. “I like the things that hurt. I like that a lot. I...  in those moments, pain simplifies everything. It’s difficult to explain, but it’s a very freeing thing for me. And I want more of that.”
“You can try a bit more, I think,” he breathes. “Just a little.”
, Sherlock. You said saw him yourself, you touched his body. I didn’t see him, but I believe you absolutely. If you say he’s dead, then he’s dead.”
“What about his partner, Bonner?” John asks as they wait. Sherlock presses the button again. “Is he involved?”
“I did?” John asks. It’s the first time, really, that Sherlock has alluded directly to feeling physical attraction to him.
It’s somehow not a costume, or a sham. Sherlock wears these clothes like he was born to them, his entire posture and body language shifting subtly yet completely to inhabit this persona. His American accent never wavers, his deep voice taking on a soft, drawling hint of Southern cadence that never veers into parody or caricature.
He takes one final drag off his cigarette, stubs it out on the metal grate, drops it into his empty mug.
“Yes, Sherlock?”
happened to him last night.
the business.”
Sherlock takes another swallow from the small bottle in his hand.
Words are sometimes hard to come by, but Sherlock can give him the comfort of his body, of physical closeness that comes much easier than talking, sometimes, for both of them. “I would like it if you came back to bed. I miss you.”
“Our true names and information will be kept out of the transaction,” Sherlock intones severely.
“Someone’s helping us, then,” John says as he sits on his neatly-made bed (they may be living out of wretched one-star motels, but he’s not about to become a fucking
“I … I’ve just been a bit stressed lately,” he offered. “I’m fine.”
“Yeah, you could say that,” John answered, taking another swig of his drink.
“I’ve heard
“Mm?”
When Sherlock saw John walking over, it was as if he suddenly realised where he was, and he quickly turned and fled the church. John quickened his pace, rushing to reach Sherlock before he left entirely, and when he reached him in the parking lot, he grabbed the material of his coat with one shaking hand, forcing him to turn and face him.
” she moved one arm down to John’s belly, which had, to his dismay, grown slightly (too many takeaways mixed with a lack of cycling to work due to weather). “
Mrs. Hudson turned to John, her face falling at the prospect of her company deserting her.
“Sherlock … is this me?” John turned to Sherlock who was still sitting on the couch, sullen, his body still tied up in a knot of elbows and knees to show his annoyance.
When John arrived home, he was not in a good mood. He felt bad for treating Sherlock so terribly, worried that Marlene was going to go around telling people about the mysterious man who seemed to affect John Watson so much, and the fact that Mary was still acting cold with him did nothing to help the situation. He knew he was the last person who should be upset in this situation, but that didn’t stop him from feeling just plain
John suddenly felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. He stopped midway down the street and pulled it out, seeing an unknown number flashing up on the screen.
John breathed out, nodding determinedly, and then decided to really focus on the woman’s voice. She was singing about … drugs? …
Sherlock wrenched himself from John’s grip and quickly wiped a tear from his face, his expression returning to that of neutral indifference – a façade to keep his emotions inside himself and away from John.
Sitting up, he noticed his clothing was now folded neatly on Sherlock’s dresser, but his jacket was lying in a heap on the floor as if it had fallen from the shelf. He got out of bed and hung it back up and moved into the hall just as Sherlock was emerging, wrapped in a towel. His hair was wet, falling in tight ringlets and when his eyes fell on John, a tight smile graced his lips.
,” John reproached, “that was rude.”
After the performance came to an end, the crowd erupted into loud applause and John applauded with them, shocked at the fact that he had truly appreciated the performance. Growing up, he had never watched ballet before, finding it particularly boring, and choosing instead to follow other sports and focus on academia; this was an entirely new experience and he had thoroughly enjoyed it.
he tasted like tea and peppermint and
“Oh, get over it. You look gorgeous either way, you big softy.” John quipped, grabbing Sherlock’s hand and pulling him into him. He kissed him with vigour and Sherlock smiled into his mouth, his hands in John’s hair. When they pulled apart, Sherlock was grinning freely, a giggle escaping his chest.
“I’m sure you’ll do just fine,” Sherlock crooned, his hands softly fitting into John’s skin. “Just relax.”
John moved his mouth away from Sherlock and pulled the covers back so he could look up at him. He was dazed and half asleep, his hair askew, a languid smile crossing his face.
John glanced at the door, hearing Sherlock still in the shower, and flicked back a response.
"Well what is it then? You were going to say something, so spit it out," John said.
John turned and found Harriet still standing in the kitchen, staring John down with her intense anger, her eyes burning into John’s.
“Well, first of all: have you told Mary yet?”
John rubbed his eyes, feeling exhausted, but thankful to know that at least Sherlock didn’t completely hate him.
Marlene tapped lightly on his office door before opening it and poking her head inside. She was holding a prescription form in her hand and had a smile on her face which faltered when she saw John’s serious expression.
Each week, I will be adding new songs, some of which (like this week) aren't technically featured, but are a part of the story on their own merit. Feel free to follow!
. John knew, what with his wine addled brain, that he had to leave.
Sherlock’s face didn’t change from deep thought, his eyes roving across John’s body and face, dissecting him bit by bit.
“No … I mean, thank you for this,” John gestured to the room, motioning to the fact that Sherlock had allowed him to be here with him.
“I’ve left the dishes for you to dry,” she snarled. “You can sleep on the couch tonight.”
He could hear Mary coming up behind him.
John blinked at Mary, feeling as though his mind were buzzing through a million responses before he settled on telling her half of the truth.
“Tell me about it,” John sighed. “Why are you here anyway?”
“What’re you doing now?” Mary sat up, watching him from the bed.
, John thought fondly.
Sherlock gave John a small smile and he automatically reached out one hand to grab onto John’s, their fingers linking together, fitting into the imprints they had left behind. For a moment, John wanted to lean forward and kiss his full lips, but instead he pulled his hand out of Sherlock’s and stood hurriedly.
“Oh for god’s sake, John. What’d you go ahead and do that for?!” Another swat on his head.
“You okay?” John walked up to him, frowning.
Also:
“God, yes.” John responded, already making his way back to Sherlock.
Eventually the stage was filled with dancers and as they started moving together, their motions elegant and fluid, snowflakes began to flutter from the ceiling on top of their heads. John suddenly sucked in a breath as he realised
“Slowly,” John breathed, looking down at Sherlock for the first time. His heart sung at the sight: Sherlock on his knees, looking up at John through his dark eyelashes, his eyes nearly black with need, lips parted.
He squinted against the bright light, finding Sherlock standing in the kitchen, his hand reaching into a cupboard, back turned.
. Feel every fibre of the song filling your body and really
they were.
John spied Harriet exit the chapel to come and find him, only to stop in her tracks when she saw the tense confrontation. There were a few people around eyeing the pair curiously.
“I think it was beautiful,” John smiled. “I don’t know how you expect me to do that, but I would certainly enjoy watching you do that a few more times.”
John placed his hand on the kitchen counter to steady himself. “Hm? Nothing,” he answered.
There was silence on the other end and John was sure he could hear Sherlock smiling.
“It’s not like I did it on purpose!” John felt his eyes welling up and he discretely wiped them away with the palm of his hand. “Plus, it’s not like it’ll do any good – he found out about Mary. It’s over now. I’ve got no one.”
me?” John suddenly felt defensive at her cutting insinuation – she hadn’t missed a single detail in the few minutes he had been standing at the counter. First his receptionist and now this girl … was he really that obvious or were they just incredibly perceptive?
“Come here,” she spoke softly. “I can help.”
Thank you all if you have made it this far - you have no idea what your support has meant to me and how much it has helped me get through the days where I didn't want to write anything at all.
Including one of my favourite songs at the moment: Memo by Years and Years. I chose this song mainly because I love it, but I also felt the lyrics were perfect as well.
“I’m sorry.” He offered as he pulled out into the street and began their drive home. “It’s just been a long day, is all.”
He placed the pages on the floor and as John reached out to twist them around to face him so he could read them, Sherlock did the same, causing their hands to crash into each other. John drew his hand back quickly, feeling slightly embarrassed, however Sherlock just looked up at John with his green eyes sparkling. His lips parted in preparation to say something but instead he merely let out a small “sorry”.
him from across the room? Not that John was complaining, however: he loved the way Sherlock looked at him as if he were desperate to have him then and there, but that didn’t take away the fact that John felt very exposed in his current situation.
“Do you need me to call anyone, love?” her heavily lined face peered into John’s and through his tears he saw her pity.
John hesitantly closed his eyes.
“Good evening, everyone. Merry Christmas and welcome to Sussex Dance Academy’s annual Winter Wonderland show,” a woman’s voice erupted from the speakers. “We’re so pleased to have everyone here tonight and we hope you enjoy what we have in store.
“John, I never blamed you for feeling the way you do. I would never hold that against you; however I accept your apology. So . . . thank you.” Sherlock spoke carefully, watching John’s face closely as the doctor blinked back tears, not looking away from Sherlock’s eyes.
“John,” Sherlock pulled in a rasping breath. “It’s no use.”
“Please don’t marry her,” his voice was faltering, crackling from the strain of the words. “Please … please don’t do this, John.”
The studio was obviously going to be upstairs, with the only indication of a studio existing being the metal door which had “Holmes Dance Studio” spray painted across the front in black ink; it was squeezed between a liquor store and an Italian restaurant. John walked up to the door and his hand hovered over the handle, before he took a deep breath and walked inside.
“So I guess both of us are a bit fucked up at the moment,” John said with a wry smile.
“Um, actually better than I initially thought. I’ll probably be home tonight instead of tomorrow, so there’s a plus.” He realised he missed her. “Sorry I didn’t call, love.”
“Yes, that may be but—“
“Of course,” John responded.
John quirked his eyebrow, smiling again. He found it so easy to smile when he was around Sherlock; even when he was being an arrogant prick, he still found him handsome and charming and so completely
John felt shame well up in his chest as he thought about how fragile Sherlock’s trust must be since John’s betrayal. It would take months, or even years to fix that, but he knew he wanted try as hard as he could to do it.
It had been half an hour of a barefooted John attempting to put what he had learned so far together with the music, but instead of it fitting together attractively like pieces of a puzzle, it more felt like he was trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. Sherlock’s once perfect curls were now becoming more distressed every time they had to stop and start the music and he was now beginning to gesture with wild, flamboyant hands.
I know how to make a bed!” Sherlock snapped, but still he continued flailing with the material, tucking it in on one side, but having it pop back up as he moved to tuck in the other.
“You need to loosen up, John.” Sherlock stated calmly, as if viciously shaking a man you’ve only known for a few minutes was the most normal thing in the world. “You’re never going to be able to achieve it on your own, so I am going to help you.”
The waiter arrived at their table, carrying two takeaway cappuccinos. He glanced at the pair holding hands and smiled sympathetically, before setting their drinks down on the table and moving away to continue waiting tables.
The tall man jumped, spinning to face John, shocked by his sudden entrance. His were eyes wild, rimmed with red, and when they settled on John, they turned dark. As much as he was trying to, John just couldn’t read him at this point. His sleepiness mixed with the tirade of emotions playing out on Sherlock’s face this early in the morning was making this more difficult than it needed to be.
, John. You need to go and get warm.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened at this. “I … John, this is all very sudden. I think you should go and we can talk another time. It’s late.”
Except when he finally escaped, the air wouldn’t come. He kept gasping like a fish, his hands coming to rest on his knees as he stood outside. He couldn’t stop the tsunami of thoughts currently assaulting his brain. He couldn’t stop Sherlock from leaving. He couldn’t stop his heart from breaking. He couldn’t stop this.
Many thanks to
John climbs off Sherlock’s lap, lacking a bit in grace as the blood returns to his lower legs, pins and needles stabbing him in his calves as he unfolds himself to full height, holds out a hand to Sherlock.
“You’re sure we’re not on a case?” John finally says when he can’t abide the quiet, although that’s not anything even resembling the question he really wants to ask.
John tugs on the chain one last time, then reaches for the left clamp, releasing it and flicking it away without warning; for a long second the pain disappears at the release of pressure, but then the blood and sensation rush back into the tortured nerves in a burst of searing agony that makes Sherlock shake and howl. John steadies him with a hand splayed across his back, dips his head to soothe the burning flesh with gentle swipes of his soft wet tongue, never losing rhythm as he fucks him steadily through the pain.
John moves back up Sherlock’s body, gently kisses his puffy, bitten mouth as he takes his cock in hand, stroking him, savoring the silky smooth heat of his flesh.
"0345. The street number, backward. Just as it appears when you look up at the numbers on the back door.” Sherlock huffs a chuckle, amusement mixed with irritation, as he hands John a small torch. “They're basically asking to be burglarised."
, John thinks a bit hysterically,
He comes for what seems like forever, making desperate keening noises as wave after wave of paralyzing bliss wash over his body. As the tide finally recedes John suckles him gently through the shivering aftershocks, and when Sherlock is completely spent he releases his cock and slides his fingers gently out of him, with just a hint of the stinging rawness sure to follow. He comes back up to kiss Sherlock gently but so deeply, mouths open and wet, tongues meeting and tangling, Sherlock tasting the metallic tang of his own body on his lips. John kisses his cheek, his forehead, then sits up to release Sherlock’s wrists from the leather cuffs and unbuckle the collar.
“You’re right,” he says, and his voice is steadier, more certain. “No more lies.”
“John,” Sherlock says, and his voice is calm, too calm, deathly calm in the way only a man fighting off panic with every fibre of his being can sound. “John.”
John supposes there’s really not much else to say.
“No,” John says. He feels blank and unfocused enough as it is.
“You do,” Sherlock cries out brokenly. “You know you do.”
Sherlock stirs, and sighs, just a small, quiet, sad sound.
John makes his way to the ensuite, finds that standing and walking are not yet without discomfort, but still miles easier than they were yesterday. He uses the facilities, washes and brushes teeth without significant issue.
“But how about you?” he asks. “Are you…” he searches for the right words, fails, parrots John’s words instead. “Have you come back too?”
John groans low in his throat and snaps his hips, thrusting hard into Sherlock, making him cry out.
John knows the man is fishing, seeing if there’s some money behind this line of questioning, but he’s in no mood to play tonight. “How many?” he asks, flatter and colder than the snake.
“No,” Sherlock admits. “I’ve never wanted to, before. You’re the first. The first one I ever wanted to.” He cracks one eye open, looks at John. “But you have.”
“Your pride is not worth causing internal injury. Or falling and cracking your skull like an egg. If you absolutely must wear them, just leave them unbuttoned. Your jumper will cover--”
“What makes you think that?”
And he smells so good, better than cheap deodorant and shaving cream could smell on anyone else in the world. Sherlock feels the tightness in his chest loosen a little, and it’s an effort to not grin like a moron.
Now, though. The case is over, wrapped up successfully, no loose ends to tug at his attention, and thanks to all that tiresome eating and sleeping he’s not even distracted by exhaustion. There’s nothing in between him and his thoughts, and on top of all that John is beside him radiating a dangerous sort of frequency Sherlock recognizes it all too well.
John laughs. “It seemed to do it for you, I have to say.” He tilts his head, suddenly feeling a flash of doubt. “It did, didn’t it? Or did I, um, misjudge?”
After dinner, Sherlock had intended to begin making notes on the experiments he has planned for the thyroid, but somehow finds himself instead in his armchair with a lap full of John Watson, hands under his shirt and roving across the warm skin of his back as their kisses again grow messy and feverish. John moans softly into his mouth and each small noise is an electrical shock wired straight to Sherlock’s aching cock.
Sherlock huffs and smooths the bandage back over his chest. He would rather like for it to get infected, for the letters of John’s name to scar deep and purple and livid, puffy with healing tissue, but if he says so John will just lecture him on the dangers of MRSA or some such so he keeps the thought to himself.
Sherlock looks up, eyes red-rimmed and damp. John gives him his best wry, reassuring smile.
“--I bitch about everything and my shoulder hurts when it rains and I buy my shoes from Asda--”
“It’ll be back on in a minute,” John murmurs against his lips and Sherlock nods, sliding his fingers around the back of John’s neck and bringing their mouths back together.
Philadelphia reminds John of London in many ways.
“Does it hurt, pet?” John murmurs, voice soft but unyielding.
, and it does unbelievable things to the state of John's brain and body.
“Poor little girl,” he murmurs..
The heat of desire builds, becomes a physical pressure as John’s cock fills with hot blood, thickens and fills. He grows achingly hard, the soft cotton of his boxer briefs becoming a rough, arousing friction. His thinking grows clouded, hazy, obscured by the insistent need to give in to his most base instincts, to flex and thrust his hips, to push and rut against something, anything, the clamour of lust growing louder and louder--
Sherlock sits up, takes ahold of the hem. “Okay, then on count of three, Just sit up a tiny bit -- one, two, three.”
Over an hour later, he emerges, perfectly put together, scrubbed and shaved, hair carefully styled, dressed in a dark grey suit and crisp white shirt. His face is perfectly bland and calm, his eyes remote to the point of robotic blankness.
“Come in,” calls a voice behind the door.
“No, no, I’m okay.” He’s telling the truth. His mouth is dry and his side still aches and throbs, but it’s not nearly as painful as it was just 24 hours ago, an encouraging sign that his questionable life choices haven’t sent him on a turn for the worse. “I just moved a little too quickly.”
“You are bloody lucky that I love you like I do,” he grumbles.
Sherlock shakes his head. “In the morning.” He sleeps better with it on, sleeps better when John tells him to.
“Please,” Sherlock moans brokenly. “Please, give me more. I need it, I do. I need more.”
“That’s it, pet.” John’s voice is gentler now but no less demanding, iron wrapped in velvet as the fingers of his hand slide into the curls at the back of Sherlock’s neck, anchoring him, holding him tight. “Feel your body, your knees on the hard floor, the air on your skin. This is who you really are. Just accept it. Accept it and let it go.”
“I can understand that,” replies Lestrade with a smile. “Let me give you a card anyway.”
All thoughts of sleep long gone, John composes a reply and hits send before he can talk himself out of it.
“Get close to her how?” He asks instead, keeping his tone carefully neutral.
“How the fuck do you…” Martinez exhales, hard, his voice tight and pissed off. “Someone ratted me out to you. Had to have.”
He’s jolted out of his somewhat melancholy thoughts by a rustling noise from the bedroom. A few moments later, he hears the thump of two solid little feet hitting the floor.
“Yes,” Sherlock murmurs. So John does.
Sherlock tries to glare at John, though his pounding pulse and raging hard-on make it a bit difficult to convey much seriousness. “I hate you,” he grumbles sulkily.
Sherlock finds a discarded item of clothing--John’s shirt, it will wash--and swipes at the stickiness on his stomach. Somewhat less slimy, he pulls John close. John relaxes against him, draping an arm around his waist.
“Where’s the subject?” John asks.
her. If I could walk away I would be all right. But I can’t because I still love a lying murderer. And she’s having my baby, there’s also that. God, what a fucking mess.”
Seb seats himself in front of a streaked, pitted mirror and carefully paints his face, a deathly chalk white under his tangled birds’ nest of brunette hair, a stripe of charcoal across his flat dark eyes.
“I promise you I don’t intend to go on a full frontal offensive, or anything like that. For starters, much as I may wish to, we both know I’m in no physical condition for that kind of confrontation. I just--” John looks into Sherlock’s eyes, spreads his hands in entreaty. “I just want to go to their house and sit in the car on the street. I want to see them. I
“Sherlock. Stay here, Sherlock. Stay with me.”
True sleepiness is beginning to pull John under; he closes his eyes, letting familiar natterings regarding shortcrust pastry cover him like a warm English blanket. He’s not really sleeping, not yet; worries about his daughter and their future are still trying to steal into his thoughts, but a soft cotton wool batting is wrapping around his mind, keeping all the unpleasantness at bay, he feels comfortable and drowsy and safe and --
“You heard what Lee said. He’s angry at the damage I’ve done. He takes it personally. Whoever this person is, he didn’t come to be James Moriarty by letting bygones be bygones. No, he’s going to come after us. Not me, but us. What we have is the most important thing in the world to me, and that makes it my greatest liability.”
“Yes!” John hisses, fists clenched so tightly his nails are digging deep, tiny red crescents etching into his palms. “Jesus Christ, yes! He’s your own brother, your own little brother, and you just
Something, perhaps, very close to grace.
“You’ve walked out twice on me tonight. And here I thought I was being charming.” John tries to smile; it feels false, hollow, like it hangs all wrong on his face. He gives it up.
“I admire their orderliness. Their planning. Their work ethic.” Sherlock is uncharacteristically hesitant; these thoughts are important, and he needs to make sure he’s understood. “John, I never thought about growing old. I never… on that day we met at Bart’s all those years ago, I didn’t want to die, exactly… but I didn’t know how to keep living, either. You saved me from that. You made me want to live. And I thought, well, that’s enough. It’s more than I ever hoped for, really, and I thought we’d keep on that way we are until the day I wasn’t fast enough, or clever enough, or… I never saw myself growing old. The decline, the decay. It was incompatible with how I saw myself. Fundamentally so.”
Sherlocks swims up through the haze of his mindless need, finds a single word.
“All right.” John takes another deep, calming breath. “I’m on my way to Scotland Yard right now. Get yourself there, quickly. Ask for DI Lestrade.”
“Just like that,” John murmurs. “So good for me, my sweet pet. You’ll give me anything I want, won’t you?”
He turns on his side, facing John.
American television is even worse than telly at home, John soon realises, growing annoyed after a few minutes, clicking the set off with a sigh. He finishes his dinner without even tasting it and pushes the paper plate aside, sliding down on the bed to stare blankly at the ceiling.
With both of them unwilling to leave the same bit of enclosed space, they end up tiptoeing around each other. Well, John tiptoes. Sherlock stomps around and pretends like John doesn’t even exist ninety seven percent of the time.
“You think you’ve stopped us?” Winters asked, the sneer evident in his thin, reedy voice. “It’s going to take a lot more than a couple of old guys--”
“You’re finally here,” Sherlock sighs impatiently, cloaking his fizzing nerves in a veneer of his old arrogance. He turns and mounts the steps, John following close behind.
John replays the events of the afternoon back in his mind, finds himself coming back to a singular question. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Sherlock tilt his head just slightly, anticipating his query.
John sighs. “I don’t…” He drops to his knees in front of Sherlock, in the vee of his open legs, and runs his fingertips up and down Sherlock’s thighs. “In all seriousness, Sherlock, those were bad times, and I don’t want to risk ever going back to how it was before. If I’m being totally honest, I’m...I’m more than a little afraid. I don’t want to jump right back in to having sex. Everything feels so fragile right now, and I…” he shakes his head a little, looks at the floor. “I’m rubbish at putting this into words.”
Sherlock waves a hand. “You know. Cleaning, airing out. Some reorganizing. Some furniture and supplies moved from the house in Bromley.”
John rubs his eyes and sighs. “You know what I mean, Sherlock. And I’m not just talking about falling into bed. We weren’t ready for things to get complicated on any level. Neither of us were ready, for
ending up a flea-market chav?”
John gives an aggrieved sigh.“While this is absolutely delightful, I don’t think I’m really necessary at the moment, so if you’d be so kind as to point me to the loo?”
After several minutes Sherlock opens one eye; the pale silver iris regards him calmly. “You’re thinking. Loudly. I thought we were sleeping.”
“Staying with Harry,” he observes.
“No, it surprised me, is all,” Sherlock says. “I’ve never been the recipient of an endearment before. But I… yes. I think I like it. I certainly don’t mind it, if you wish.”
He goes home and makes tea and slices an apple. The tea he drinks, the apple slices turn brown on the plate.
At the mention of ‘the body,’ Patricia’s breathing hitches, but she keeps herself together.
John pinches the back of his thigh, not hard but in warning. “Stop that now, you greedy thing,” he says, his tone low and serious. “I’m being a bit lenient tonight, but if you need a firmer hand I won’t hesitate.”
“I’ll see you soon, okay?” John stands on tiptoes to kiss him, just a whisper of lips against his cheek, and then he’s gone, down the steps and out the door.
“Maybe not after this conversation,” John growls, low and dangerous.
For the belt is very serious business, indeed.
“God,” he moans. “God. John. You’re still so tight. Are you sure?”
“What is it, love?” John asks.
“Look at the way you’re dying to fuck me right now,” John murmurs. “You’re such a slut for it, aren’t you?”
For the most part, though, Sherlock stays home, keeps quiet, keeps to himself.  He doesn’t play the violin, or jump on the furniture, or microwave eyeballs, or insist on Nepalese takeaway from a Brixton hole-in-the-wall at 11 pm on a Tuesday night.
He performs the necessary (Oh God, how incredibly necessary) ablutions, then showers thoroughly and carefully and brushes his teeth. He comes back into the room to find Sherlock seated at the desk, already on his laptop, fingers flying over the keyboard.
Sherlock looks at him for a long moment with focused intent, assessing, calculating. The confusion in his pale eyes clears, shifting into a calm, resigned acceptance.
“I can’t listen to this,” John stormed over to where his coat was sitting on the countertop. “I wouldn’t expect you of all people to understand. I don’t know why I even bothered coming here.”
“You can’t keep running away from this, you know,” she said. “You’re gonna have to tell her at some stage.”
him, do you?”
fault!”
She turned away from him, moving to their bedroom, leaving John standing in the living room, his pants still undone. He quickly bucked up his trousers and followed Mary, stumbling as he did so. Of course he wanted to sleep with her. Of course he wanted to feel the comfort of her wrapped around him, but truthfully, his heart wasn’t in it. And no amount of alcohol could change that. Entering the bedroom, Mary was sitting on the bed waiting for him, a mischievous glint in her eye.
Sherlock let out a surprised yell, pushing John off him aggressively so he went stumbling backwards. John swore as he regained his balance, before turning to find an older woman, standing in the entryway with a pair of gloves in one hand and a cloth in the other. Her face was one of pure shock and … delight?
“Sherlock!” John raised his voice; his eye contact was steadfast against where Sherlock was peering out. “I just want to talk!
John briskly walked into the men’s room and took his phone out of his pocket. Two texts from Mary.
no one has to see ..."
Mary’s was shocked and she put her hand to her mouth, understanding the implications of what that meant. “Where?”
“Sherlock, please open the door.” John called out, moving up to the front door and resting his forehead on the wood, knocking with one hand. The alcohol had made him brazen. “Sherlock … I know you’re in there.”
“John, I want you to ignore everything in the room and just
“You can do that whenever you want, you know.” John responded, before pausing for a beat and continuing: “You can have
“Must you be so
Snow was beginning to flurry through the streets of the unfamiliar township in Sussex as John sat in the cab, watching houses pass by; it was Christmas Eve and John spied Christmas trees lighting up the windows of many houses. The cab was warm and John dreaded having to get out into the cold when they arrived at his destination.
“No. M’fine,” he protested.
He heard the crowd erupting into enthusiastic applause, but he didn’t stop to clap with them. He couldn’t – he needed to get out to some fresh air so he could still his beating heart. He needed to close his eyes and attempt to scrub away the imprint of Sherlock’s haunted expression as he danced. If this performance was for him, he didn’t know what he was supposed to do with it.
Please remember to comment your thoughts! I always love hearing what you all think and it's good to know if I'm falling short anywhere.
John argued with himself, angrily lying awake in the dark, eyes staring out into the black.
The motion of removing John’s shoes and socks so he was left with bare feet felt incredibly intimate and the feeling was increased when Sherlock’s soft hands touched his bare skin, almost massaging the sole of his foot, before he placed his foot back and moved onto John’s right. Doing the same motion, Sherlock’s firm pressure felt incredibly pleasant on his weary feet. Once he had removed his last sock, storing it away, Sherlock left John’s foot sitting in his lap, resting his hand on his bare skin for a moment, before he moved it back to its original position. Silently, John moved his legs into a cross-legged position and leaned forward, starting the same motions on Sherlock’s feet.
“What do you think?” Sherlock said sarcastically, quirking his eyebrows at John as he returned his attention to John’s feet, starting on his other shoe.
“You make me happy too,” Sherlock answered, his hand stroking up and down John’s back with light fingertips.
“You okay, mate?” the cabbie looked at John in the rear view mirror.
As Sherlock clicked play, a woman’s sultry voice played out over the speakers, filling the room with her sweet voice. Sherlock returned to his spot leaning on the piano, looking over at John with one eyebrow raised. He looked rather cocky, John thought, wishing he could kiss the expression off his face. Somehow, with Sherlock being an arrogant prat throughout the entire lesson, John was finding himself more attracted to him than ever. Sherlock was being a bit of a brat and all John wanted to do was fuck the shit out of him to shut him up. It was frustrating to say the least, especially when those thoughts were then immediately stamped out by the thought of his wife-to-be waiting for him at home. But John was getting used to the inward arguments he would have with himself. He was also getting used to ignoring those arguments to savour just being in the moment with Sherlock.
John stood, clenching and unclenching his fists. He was working himself up, starting to get furious at Harriet for being so damn unflappable about this. John turned and started pacing across the floor before turning and angrily launching a kick at the base of the bed. Couldn’t she see that he loved Mary too? Couldn’t she see what it would mean if he were to tell her about Sherlock?
“Oi, what the bloody hell are you playing at, mate?” John wrenched himself free from Sherlock and stepped back, feeling slightly dizzy, but ready to defend himself if need be.
Sherlock seemed to blush slightly, colour rising in his cheeks. “You’ll do just fine. I’ve written down every separate movement so you have it on paper – that way if you’re ever stuck you can refer back to this.”
? John thought, feeling confused.
“I just don’t want to give myself to you only to have you leave again,” he said, leaning in closer to John now, his eyes softening. Their hands were slowly interlacing, fitting into each other comfortably.
“Give me a moment to lock up. If you want to head down and hail a cab for us?” Sherlock began rifling through his pockets for his keys.
“So … you’d be moving there if you got it?” Now John definitely was acting like a needy school girl. He was suddenly insanely resentful that Sherlock would find it so easy to just up and leave. And he was despairing at the thought that he would do that without him. “But what about your studio here? What about the life you’ve built here?”
“Yeah … well, no actually.” John never knew he could be such an excellent liar and if he weren’t feeling so guilty, he would almost be impressed with his performance.
“Sherlock, I …” John’s voice was quiet, the words feeling thick on his tongue.
John wasn’t prepared for this. He wouldn’t even know what to tell Mary or how to even begin to tell her.
Sherlock chuckled low in his throat, before settling himself comfortably on the chair closest to John, angled so he was facing him.
She was standing outside with a cardigan pulled over her shoulders, hunched over in the cold. Her shoulder length golden hair was tucked behind her ears messily as she waved at the car and ducked over to open the door for John. She looked worried and as soon as he stepped out of the vehicle, she pulled him into a tight hug.
“Yeah … okay,” John answered and he ended the call.
“Thank you,” John took one of the cups of tea and sipped – it was perfectly brewed, slightly milky but strong and hearty.
“So was that your boyfriend?” John broached hesitantly.
“It’s normal for couples to go through stuff together, okay? Maybe when you’re in a serious relationship for once in your life you’ll understand,” John said. His voice was a lot harsher than he had intended it to be.
John picked a quiet, relatively secluded table in the back corner of the café, allowing Sherlock to go ahead to the counter and order two coffees for them to takeaway. He watched him stand in line at the counter, his hand coming up to his hair and mussing it so his wind swept look was replaced with tidy, small ringlets. When he returned, he sat down opposite John, his inscrutable gaze falling on him.
Sherlock’s fingers hovered over John’s lips, which were slightly pouted. He had wondered so many nights about how John’s lips would feel against his, how John would taste inside his mouth. And so gently, gently Sherlock traced one soft finger over the cupids bow on John’s lips. Sherlock sighed as he felt the soft plushness of John and he couldn’t help but run his finger along his lips and down to his jawline. He traced oh, so soft fingertips along John’s jaw, which was slightly shaded with his afternoon stubble.
Attempting to shake off the feeling, John stripped out of his underwear and stepped into the hot shower, allowing it to run over his face and down his body. But instead of sobering him up, the feeling of the heat on his body and the water running over his shaft made him more aroused.
After one too many drinks, John decided to take a detour in the cold night air down Baker Street in an attempt to see him one last time before he said truly said goodbye.
“Trust me, I need it.”
“So does Sherlock know?”
he couldn’t simply
I’ve got to see,” she quipped, giggling. “
“Listen,” John squeezed Sherlock’s hand. “I would go with you …
“What are you doing here?” John asked once they were in the privacy of his office, not wanting to sound panicked, but instead coming off as curt and rude.
John blinked at Sherlock, hesitating, before smiling and responding. “God, I love you too, Sherlock.”
Let me know what you guys think. <3
“Oh love, you’re so fucking perfect,” John breathed, pushing himself in and out. “Fuck, you’re amazing.”
“Mate, you getting out or are we leaving? The meter’s still running, you know.”
I had fun writing this, however, so I hope you guys enjoy it too.
Sherlock did the same, sipping his in silence, eyes dark as they moved from John to Mrs. Hudson.
, John wanted to finish, but it would have been too much for him to allow himself that liberty. Sherlock was hurting and he needed to allow him to hurt before he messed with his head any more than he already had. “A-and . . . I’m sorry for hurting you. Christ, I’m so sorry for hurting you.”
Sherlock’s lips pulled into a small smile and he uncomfortably shifted in his seat, his eyes meeting John’s and then falling to the garden in front of them.
“So are you,” Sherlock answered simply.
It was only when she began to sway from side to side with him in her arms, forcing him to move with her, and softly trilling their song in his ear that he eventually had to give in and force out a laugh.
Sitting down to dinner, John pushed his potatoes around on his plate, not feeling very hungry at all. He kept thinking about the fact that he had been so utterly rude to Sherlock and the possibility that he may have just dashed his chance with him.
close. He began moving faster, taking the lead, using his hands to push Sherlock’s legs back so he could move deeper.
“We need to fill these out and you can post them once they’re done, okay?” Mary said as they pulled into their driveway and parked up.
“I’ll be sure to have your …
“You’re so beautiful,” he breathed, placing kisses all over Sherlock’s neck and face. “Oh, god, you’re perfect. How are you mine?
Sherlock took John by the hand for a second time that day, leading him through a slightly cluttered kitchen, down the hall and into Sherlock’s bedroom. It was immaculate and minimalistic. On the wall above the bed was a large painting, depicting a dancer, naked and emotive in his motion. He was leaning back, his muscular torso twisted in aching pain, an arrow sticking out from his heart. John wondered whether Sherlock had painted this one as well.
Sherlock came through the door, locked it behind him, coming up beside John.
“—were amazing,” the man said. “Thank you for letting me watch that.”
Letting go of the counter he threw a challenging glance at Mary, before attempting to walk in a relatively sober fashion. Instead of walking in a straight line, however, he stumbled over his own feet and felt like he was going to fall forwards onto his face. Mary moved up to him, placing her arms on either side of him to steady him.
Sherlock stopped in front of John and moved in close, his hand coming out to hold onto John’s, and suddenly it was as though the world had stopped spinning so the two could exist in this moment together. The air was suddenly very still and all John could hear was Sherlock’s voice and feel the weight of his hand in his.
John made a conscious effort to soften the frown on his face as he focused on the tender music echoing through the studio, allowing it to seep into his muscles and skin. He made an effort not to try and think about where Sherlock might be in the room, only allowing his voice to guide him. He purposely attempted to
“Mm, good morning,” he heard Sherlock groan sleepily as his slender hands moved under the blanket and into John’s hair.
“Of course he won’t!” Mrs. Hudson laughed. “People don’t exist just to fit into your mould of how life should be, John. It’s not as black and white as you’re trying to make it out to be. Especially not in Sherlock’s case.”
“John,” Sherlock sounded serious. “I have to ask you something.”
John quickly responded:
It was the first time they had held hands.
“Mm,” she hummed, sitting up on her elbow to look at him through the dark. “Must have fallen asleep.”
“It’s just tea, John.” Sherlock answered with a frown.
John was captivated, lifting his hand to his mouth as tears formed in his eyes; Sherlock looked like he was also close to tears, his face lined with passion and pain as he curled his body into buttery soft lines and silk. His tender movements were unlike anything John had seen from anyone before, much less from Sherlock, and as he leapt malleably through the air, John felt himself edging forward in his seat even more, unable to tear his eyes away from him.
John opened his mouth to respond, but was cut off by Sherlock turning and grabbing his bags, flying out the door.
. It was like a sick film that kept replaying over in his head: Sherlock’s face crumpled into pained grief, lost to John because of what he did. The way he kept his impassive amour up as he extended his hand, holding out the invitation to John. Such a small, insignificant piece of cardboard that held so much weight. So much power.
“Sherlock …” John said, his name tasting sweet on his tongue.
Sherlock’s feet were soft (of course) and perfect. John had never thought of feet falling under the category of “perfect” before, but somehow, Sherlock’s did just that. He had never been a fan of feet before, but Sherlock’s skin felt so soft that he had to resist the urge to kiss along the arch of them – he wondered whether doing that would elicit soft moans from Sherlock’s mouth.
saying which one do you prefer?” Mary snapped, pointing to the two options on the table (both looked the same). “If you find this that boring, you can just go wait in the car.”
drunk.
“So are you going to answer that?” Harriet was sitting up, looking over at John’s phone which was lying face up on the countertop, vibrating.
“You look shocked. Were you not aware of your impending marriage to …” Sherlock glanced indifferently down at the words on the card as if her name had slipped from his mind. “… Mary?”
As the music began to taper off, taking John’s breath with it, Sherlock’s movements began to slow, his limbs becoming softer as he twisted to a stop in the middle of the floor. There was nothing loud about this end: it was quiet and final in its movement, yet the action resonated through John’s chest as if Sherlock were screaming at him.
I hope you like this one!
“I don’t know what you’re so angry about, John, considering you’re the one who was acting like an arsehole yesterday with Joanne,” Mary angrily scraped her plate into the bin, her eyes boring into John’s face like fire.
John wanted to wean himself off him but Sherlock Holmes was like an itch he had to scratch. He sat at work in a stupor, taking advantage of the slow day to allow his mind to wander, replaying all the significant moments shared between Sherlock and himself: Sherlock saying he loved John. Sherlock and John dancing together for the first time. His confrontation with Sherlock at the train station. Each moment felt like a heavy weight on his chest.
“Yeah, that’s right, John. Just leave me to clean up as always!” Mary called after him. “You’re a bloody lazy bastard!”
(See the end of the chapter for
?” Sherlock reproached once John was standing in front of him.
She glanced back at John, raising an eyebrow at him and, as if she were reading his mind, she blurted out: “Jesus, you’re getting old. You look like shit, mate.”
Sherlock slowly moved his mouth down over John’s cock, taking him in his entirety, before moving back up to the head, resuming his ministrations of delicate licking and suckling. Moving down to his base again, allowing his entire mouth to suck him in, John swore loudly, his hand still entwined in Sherlock’s tanned curls.
But when Sherlock’s indifference remained, John broke down, heaving sobs shaking his body. He moved forward and grasped onto the front of Sherlock’s coat, his forehead coming to rest on Sherlock’s chest. “I’m
Sherlock plucks the oversized card out from the plastic holder nestled amongst the green leaves. He scans it over briefly, then perches on the edge of John’s bed and hands him the cream-coloured envelope.
“Spot on, then. I didn’t expect to be right about everything.”
“You’re
And they didn’t crumble.
And he knows exactly who that someone is.
Sherlock rolls onto his back, looks at the ceiling. “It’s just,” he begins, and John thinks his deep voice sounds rough, strained, almost as if he were about to cry.
“You’re so observant,” Sherlock murmurs to the baby approvingly; it’s his normal voice with just the barest touch of singsong infant cadence added. “Just stunningly intelligent, and no surprise there. We’re going to get along just brilliantly, aren’t we? Oh yes we are.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “A juice box?” he asks, his tone gently mocking. “Are we in primary school, John?”
“Believe or not, Doctor Watson, that’s your purview, but there’s not a single piece of evidence to the contrary. Now, if there’s nothing else, I am a very busy man.”
John huffs out a shaky laugh, still gripping the sleeve of Sherlock’s coat. “You’re right. I overstepped there. That’s your area.”
“I wanted it to be yours,” Mary says. “I would rather it was yours. But you were so insistent on being careful.” She glares at him as well as she can muster through the pain. “Just one more way you kept yourself from me, I suppose.”
“Yes. Please. And next time, do bother to knock,” snaps Sherlock.
“No, thank you.”
A second later, he realises his fingers are still gently pressed against Sherlock’s jaw.
Sherlock turns his head so he can speak clearly.
“But if I can’t. Be absolutely honest, with me and with yourself. Would you still stay here, with me?”
Greg’s expression is a bit frustrated and annoyed but also more than a little fond, and it makes Sherlock feel horribly defensive and exposed. It’s all far more than he can deal with, so he assembles his face back into a cool, impassive mask.
“I didn’t say that,” Sherlock says, hurriedly hauling himself upright, snatching the printouts from Lestrade’s outstretched hand. “I’ll have it solved for you in two hours.”
“Yes,” he gasps. “Like this. Please, yes, let me--”
‘He was curled up on his side like he was cold, or he was sleeping, but his eyes were open. No blood, he didn’t look like he was in a fight or nothing. He weren’t wearing his own clothes. he was wearing those trousers  nurses and doctors wear--”
“Can you keep your legs spread for me while I play with you?” John asks. “Have I trained you well enough?”
“Goodwill and Walmart,” Sherlock explains tersely, pouring himself a cup of the brackish brew, tipping it to his mouth and gulping it down without seeming to notice the dubious taste.
It’s a testament to John’s stubborn, perhaps pigheaded optimism that he’s still sleeping in Sherlock’s bed. Sherlock himself isn’t, instead staying up all night, driving himself to exhaustion before collapsing into unconsciousness, whereupon John finds him in passed out and snoring on the sofa at odd, random hours of both day and night.
John nods. “The muscle contractions can make dead bodies have odd expressions. It doesn’t mean he was frightened or in pain. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything. Alright?”
“John.” Sherlock’s voice is steady, but John can hear the edge of suppressed fear lurking just underneath his smooth baritone.
John runs warm, compared to Sherlock; his compact form radiates heat as he sleeps, and Sherlock gravitates to it like a plant seeking sunlight. Mindful of the bandage, he carefully envelops John with his long arms and legs. He places a large hand over John’s chest, feels the steady beat of the heart underneath his palm.
“Somewhat,” Sherlock admits softly.
, it tastes like pennies and stomach flu. He grimaces as he swallows.
Sherlock’s eyes flick up towards John, then over to the nurse. Apparently, however, the entire staff has surmised the obvious, and Glenn, despite being semi-annoying, earns many points in John’s book by showing no discomfort or even surprise at the use of the word
“No. However, what we do know is that she was met at the station.” He zooms in on an image of Mary embracing a slightly shorter woman wearing a long navy coat. Her face is turned away from the camera, her head and neck covered by a flowing scarf.
“I was so very, tragically mistaken about so very many things, but my greatest error was this: there is no such thing as
but then it occurs to him maybe actually he did, so he settles for a nonverbal grunt of consent as he carefully snuggles closer against Sherlock. The man may be a bit of a sneaky bastard but he is undeniably in the right on all counts tonight, and he’s warm and he smells so good, smells like forever and always and
John doesn’t answer in words, but instead places his palms flat on Sherlock’s thighs and pushes himself to his feet, a bit ungainly, the creak and pop of his middle-aged knees unfolding is loud in the stillness of the room. As he rises to his feet, a relevant thought pushes its way to the front of his lust-addled brain.
“I don’t know,” John gurgles through a mouthful of blood. It’s the truth.
But no words come. His mind is blank, emptied by shock, and there’s no one left to hear him say them anyway. He kisses her forehead, her skin cool and papery under his lips, and pulls the bedclothes up to cover her.
“Um,” Sherlock murmurs, “John. A bit of guidance might be useful.”
“Back in a tick, all right?” John kisses him once more before getting to his feet and heading for the loo, their recent activities obvious in his rather tentative gait, his stride even more bowlegged than usual as he disappears into the darkened hallway. Sherlock hears the toilet flush and the water run, then John exits the bathroom through the bedroom side and fumbles around briefly in the dark. Not for clothes--no drawers open and shut, no distinctive click of the latch on the wardrobe door. Instead, John is pulling his old duffel out from under the bed, unzipping the top. Sherlock crinkles his nose in concentration as he listens to John zip the old green canvas back up before shoving it back under the bed.
John knows the inevitable is upon him; at long last, he is unable to stop the tsunami building up inside him, unable to keep the maelstrom of feelings contained for even a single moment longer. Every huge feeling, every melodramatic thought John’s ever had feels poised to tumble out of his mouth in a whirlwind of emotion, the true nature of his heart revealed at last in a torrent of unstoppable feeling.
John uses Sherlock’s arm to lever himself to and carefully hops on, feeling the uniquely supreme self-consciousness only hospital wheelchairs can provide. Sherlock shoulders both of their bags, and opens the door so the nurse can maneuver John out of the room.
Sherlock is sitting on the fire escape, knees pulled to his chest, smoking a cigarette. He’s bare to the waist, navy striped pyjama bottoms riding low on his hips. A mug of tea is next to him, likely long gone cold.
“Yoo-hoo,” Molly calls. “Home again, home again, jiggity jig.”
“I do,” John says. “It was to hold on to me. Whether it was sentiment or calculation or jealousy over you, she did it to hold on to me.”
Turns out the delivery guy is in fact merely a delivery guy; Sherlock pays him in cash, takes the food, locks and bolts the door after him. He brings the bags to the bed, hands them to John, then turns and takes the Glock out of his jeans and places it on top of the bureau.
Unless Maria disguised herself as a teenager and gave birth in a Taco Bell restroom, his query comes up empty. Sherlock gives him a sidelong look, his eyes asking an unspoken question. John shakes his head, leans his head back on the headrest.
“Good,” he growls, sharp and dark as jagged rocks as he releases Sherlock’s head, pushes it carelessly back down. “That’s exactly what I want.”
Sherlock just sighs. There’s not much else to say.
“Do you have any ideas?”
, dude, but he doesn’t know who you are. He’s offering ten grand to whoever can find you first.”
“Of course I am,” Sherlock responds, just a touch too quickly. He looks about fifteen right now, leaning against the doorframe in John’s nicked jumper and a pair of tatty charity shop jeans. His short dark hair is growing quickly; it’s now long enough for a bit of the natural curl to make an appearance, a few rebellious cowlicks standing on end at his crown. He’s all gangly limbs and mussed hair and uncertainty, not quite able to meet John’s eyes, and John is suddenly reminded of the fact that Sherlock has never done this before, not any of this.
“Patricia, where are you right now?”
Sherlock slips quietly into the darkened front room, flicks on the overhead light in the kitchenette area. John hears the rustle of paper bags placed on the dinette table.
“Absolutely not,” he snarls in a near-hiss, volume low but tone murderous. “Detective Figueroa can, and will, wait until John wakes up. There’s no need to disturb an injured man’s sleep just to ask a few pointless questions.”
John finds himself more at home there than he has felt anywhere else on his strange journey through the United States.
But of course, Sherlock is correct. It’s not the police.
“I need,” Sherlock says, and hesitates.
“Never fear, John. I have no intention of letting him walk free from all of this. Pete and Alice Dobrev were taken into custody this morning at a small caravan park in upstate New York. She’s already indicated her willingness to testify against Johnson.”
It's the next morning -- Day Twelve in hospital, if John's math is accurate and it may very well not be -- when something unexpectedly catches John's attention.
Sherlock flails sleepily at him. “I know,” John murmurs, “but I want to make sure you’re not bleeding.”
“You crashed into your own bins.”
After John suffers the humiliation of having the volume of his urine output noted, he vows to remember this kind of helpless vulnerability when he is again on the other side of the equation.
He sits crosslegged on the floor and reads the yellowing newsprint, looks at the photos of he and Sherlock in those ridiculous hats, and for some reason tonight instead of remembering the anger and turmoil and tears, he remembers all the good times, all the amazing nights of adrenaline and danger and laughter and friendship.
sure we're still on Evelyn's good side?” John asks, joking but also not really.
Sherlock bites back his rising and useless irritation. He should have solved this
“I do,” John sighs, his voice strained and ragged with want. “God help me, you know I do.”
“Sherlock--” John murmurs warningly as Sherlock slips his large warm hand under the table and begins to purposefully stroke graceful fingers along John’s thigh. “What the hell is it with you and posh restaurants, anyway?”
It is a fact as immutable as stone; as long as Mycroft Holmes lived to draw breath, he would come for his little brother.
John pulls him down for a rough, wet kiss, their mouths smearing messily against each other as he pulls his fingers out of Sherlock’s arse, adds a thirds and slides back into him, swallowing down Sherlock’s choked noises of pain-pleasure.
(He thinks briefly about tiny black seed of doubt in his own mind. Pushes it reflexively away.)
Desperate for the return of John’s skin against his, Sherlock’s eyes gratefully drink in every familiar dip and curve of his lover’s body, his wide shoulders, the silver crater of his scar, the slight softness cushioning his belly, his powerful thighs dusted with sparse blonde hair. Sherlock unconsciously moistens dry lips with his tongue as John eases the waistband of his navy blue y-fronts over the bulge of his erection. When John’s stiff, dusky pink cock springs free from his pants Sherlock feels a wave of fresh desire wash over him, but it’s softer now, sweeter, something gentled by love and devotion.
Sherlock straddles John’s hips with his knees, cradles John’s head with both huge hands as they kiss. He’s making tiny, desperate little moaning noises, totally unaware, breathy gasps that set John’s nerves aflame with a burning desire for more, more kissing, more contact, just...God. Just plain
“It’s your move,” Mycroft says instead.
Evening stretches into night, turns the corner to morning.
To his pleased surprise, casual daily affection seems to stoke a fire in Sherlock, a hunger for touch and connection he had shut down so ruthlessly that John suspects he didn’t even know he had been starving for it all these years.
“Sherlock, let’s just forget it for today,” sighs John.
The shower is hot and stinging, and John is grateful for the higher quality of soap a decent hotel provides as he scrubs himself nearly pink under the spray, then uses a liberal dollop of the Paul Mitchell shampoo Sherlock insisted on buying at some point in their travels even though his hair is currently military short.
Sherlock doesn’t look at him, but tilts his head just slightly in his direction.
The kid rises, crosses the room to where John stands. The other men immediately resume ignoring him steadfastly.
“I think  we have a lot in common, Molly,” he says presently.
Square, blunt fingers with clean, short nails. The hands of a doctor, firm and competent. The hands of a soldier, a killer who took a life without a tremor in order to save him.
But this--this clumsy, unintentional poking of a painful wound, some abscessed pocket of poisonous emotion--this is far worse than any loud rowing could ever be.
“It feels… ” John trails off, lost momentarily in thought. “I don’t know. It feels dangerous to me. Like crossing a line.”
John feels his belly flood with the hot, churning defensiveness and guilt of someone caught dead to rights.
“Aw hell,” Jack sighs. “This is the worst sodding day.” He bends down, pokes Sherlock hard in the shoulder.
“Think so.”
“That’s right.,” he says with approval, releasing his hold on his nipple, rubbing the flesh with gentle fingers to soothe the burn. “Because I own you, you’re mine, and I love the way you look when I hurt you.” He kisses Sherlock’s already-sweaty temple, just above the fabric of the blindfold. “Gorgeous pain slut,” he murmurs, and there’s a soft scrape of fabric against the rug as John turns on his knee, a metallic jingle as he retrieve an item from the night table.
“Not so sure it was my
“Not married anymore,” he says with a shrug, and swipes a hand across his lips.
“Come to bed soon, okay?” John says instead, and he doesn’t mean for it to come out low and rough and a little needy but it does, and Sherlock’s eyes flick up to him for just a moment, pupils wide and dark in the lamplight.
“The egg hatched,” Sherlock echoes, his voice soft.
John knows everything Sherlock is saying is true, and that knowledge makes him feel uncomfortable and defensive in a way he can’t quite define. “Yes, okay,” he grumbles. “Ta for the reality check.”
“I know, sweetheart,” John says. “Oxytocin and whatnot. Just breathe.”
, snatched up bodily in the midst of their normal weekday morning routine.
Mary closes her eyes against John's cold, unforgiving gaze. “No,” she says with a pained sigh. "I don’t believe so.” She takes a deep breath, releases it, and opens her eyes to meet his. “How did you know?”
“Please tell me I can take this shit off.”
silences.
She has Mary’s full, round mouth, pursed in an O as she sleeps. It hurts John’s heart, a physical pain.
John slips his forearms under Sherlock’s legs, bending him almost double as he crushes their mouths together, swallowing his sounds of desperate pleasure as his entire being narrows down to the unbearable heat and slide and pleasure of their connected bodies.
He’s a vision of unlikely beauty unsuited to the near-squalor of John’s grimy little flat.
Sherlock pulls out his magnifying glass and bends over the body, peers at where John points, at the small round mark on the inside of Travis’s elbow.
, how free and lovely it is to indulge a bodily appetite for sex in as simple and straightforward manner as one would a plate of chips, or a hot bath, or a nap -- all the things he routinely partakes of now, without shame or apology, all the simple pleasures he denied himself for so many years before John Watson showed up and turned his entire sense of self inside out.
, John.”
“You like that?” Sherlock asks, and his voice is genuinely curious, but John doesn’t miss the darker, predatory current underneath.
A moment passes. They stare at each other mutely, the sound of their breathing shockingly loud in the grey silence of the flat.
And just like that, Sherlock seems to take up twice as much space in the room as he did five minutes ago. He picks up his scarf from the table, loops it gracefully around his long neck, and John can’t help but let his eyes linger just a beat longer than he ought. Sherlock catches him looking, and for a moment John can see the soft fondness in his eyes. Then it’s gone, and Sherlock is back to his familiar persona, the demanding, imperious, brilliant, crime-solving detective firmly in charge.
John cracks the passenger window, taps the cigarette ash.
And in truth, now that he’s on the other side of it Sherlock is forced to admit that despite his misgivings the party, overall, turned out just fine. In fact, it was lovely. Lily, who despite being a brilliantly intelligent baby is still only a baby, understood very little of the goings-on but delighted in the event nonetheless, grabbing at balloons, tearing apart wrapping paper, and shoving fistfuls of cake into her mouth with gusto while the adults laughed and clapped and took photos and drank a remarkable amount of chilled prosecco.
“Uh, yeah I’ll be out in a second,” John answered, quickly wrapping the towel around his waist.
Sherlock shivered underneath him, his head thrown back as he came, leaking ejaculate all over his stomach. John watched in awe as Sherlock’s muscles contracted, tightening under his skin and around John’s cock and soon John was spilling himself inside of Sherlock, his mind going entirely blank all except for blind pleasure and
Moving over to the coffee table, he settled down the two cups of tea and the biscuit and stood beside John, watching him silently. He then gracefully sat down in front of the couch so he was able to sit beside John without disturbing him. He angled his body so he was side on, able to see John to make sure he was still sleeping soundly, prepared to wake him if he saw any signs of nightmares, as he had done countless times in the past. Only this time he was closer than ever, able to drink in the sight of this beautiful man.
And over the years, as their relationship grew older, normality set in. They said I love you less. They had sex even less than that. Then Mary took it upon herself to propose to John in (what he later deduced was) an attempt to freshen their relationship and their love for each other. But after a year of wedding planning and tasting cake and floral arrangements and parents arguing and fittings, John was just
