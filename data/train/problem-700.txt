Being rewarded by John’s embrace and the slide of his burning palms on Sherlock’s bare skin was both heady and terrifying. This wasn’t the beginning of sex, or at least it didn’t seem to be. But the sheer intimacy of it made Sherlock’s stomach clench painfully; he experienced a strange, compelling sick lurch at the thought. He wondered if John could feel the scars under his fingertips, spread across the small of his back.
The water was cooling rapidly in the chilly high-ceilinged bathroom. John toyed with the idea of turning the stiff brass bath tap with his toes, refilling it with more hot water and just wallowing for another hour or longer. It was a magnificent tub, he reflected, slowly allowing himself to sink entirely below the surface to rinse his hair. One could easily fit more than one person in its depths, with room to spare.
Violet leaned into John and murmured in his ear: “This is fucking
John knew when he was being dismissed; it seemed that asking Violet about her background before joining the Holmes family had been a bad idea. He accepted the tray she hastily assembled and headed back upstairs, hoping he hadn’t upset her.
“I don’t… I don’t think I want you to fuck me.” Sherlock said quietly, fixing John with a heated glance. The richly scented sandalwood soap had turned the water a little cloudy, but John didn’t miss how Sherlock’s hand was slipping slowly down his torso. He could feel Sherlock’s long toes flexing on his inner thigh. “I’m not completely against the idea, not any more. I know you’d be… I know you’d be more careful than...” he trailed off and John watched, spellbound as he sinuously arched his back against the edge of the bath.
“Steady on, John.” Sherlock murmured disapprovingly. “There’s plenty of time for more unnatural acts later tonight.”
“Bracing, isn’t it?” Sherlock remarked, tightening his scarf around his neck; seeming utterly unmoved by the bitter cold. He glanced around the quiet train station, taking in the arched glass and wrought iron roof and sleepy passengers making their way out into the snowy streets.
“I’m quite sure that Violet already knows.” said Sherlock. “If anyone could spot a human reinvention, she could.”
. John is clearly being kept out of the way. Probably for the best, unless he could join forces with Vi. Unlikely though, given the timeframe.]
(Violet's fervent voice in the conservatory that night: "Oh, Christ John. I’m so glad he’s got you. Just so bloody glad of it. I’d always worried, you see. It was always in the back of my mind that he was facing the world alone.")
Phyllis had her back to him and jumped sharply when he called a greeting to her when he was less than twenty feet away.
Violet worried the end of her long messy plait between two restless fingers, and nodded after a moment. “Very well. Want some tea?”
John looked sharply around his shoulder, closing the door behind himself with one hand. There was a large rectangular box on the stairs, neatly wrapped in brown paper and tied with string. It looked innocuous enough, but living with Sherlock for this long had taught John to be wary of unexpected deliveries. His memory dredged up the unwelcome recollection of an envelope, filled with breadcrumbs and he sucked in his breath sharply.
“Mrs. Duncan seems to be good friends with Miss Argyle.” John interjected, feeling the need to steer the conversation away from the uncomfortable waters of theology.
As it turned out, it was a very informative book indeed. Although Sherlock didn’t seem inclined to revise his earlier decision of not trying anal sex again, he seemed content with the idea of trying out several new ideas from the pages of The Book.
The rasp-click of a cigarette lighter, followed by a deep inhalation of breath. Beautiful waft of smoke, billowing through the confined space. An ostentatious cough, from Bruno.
He could feel every indentation of the ridged knife handle digging into his fingers and across his palm. The terrible darkness that he always did his best to keep locked away in the furthest corners of his mind was roaring at him to push just a tiny bit harder; to slide the blade just a fraction in either direction.
She ignored Mycroft’s look of mild outrage from the rear window of the land-rover and whispered in his ear: “I know. I know. Come back, please. Come soon.”
“There’s something. Something going on. Down there.” John gasped quietly, straightening up a little.
“Good?” Sherlock asked casually.
worth it.”
“Yes indeed.” Hector replied, with a small smile. “There’s nothing like your own bed. And the food in that hospital was frankly atrocious, although I’m sure they tried their best.”
“I never could see the point of old-fashioned hankies myself, really.” John said, trying to get onto a safe area of conversation before he managed to upset her again. "But Sherlock always seems to have a limitless supply of clean freshly ironed ones. He bullies our landlady into washing and starching them, the big git.”
“There’s nothing wrong with my ribs at all!” Sherlock said crossly, following on his heels. “Give it back!”
bloody unfair!” Rab wailed.
“Because, you see…” Patrick paused delicately. “Well, I should hate to cause any ill-feeling or misunderstandings. But since you and Mr. Holmes appear to have quite a
John remembered his panic in the woods after hearing Mary’s words, and felt sick.
! Mrs Duncan said so! At…at the hospital!”
(Patrick. Oh, god. I almost left him to chase after them. He’d be dead if I had. But I might have gotten to Sherlock by now. And Patrick might be dying anyway… it might not have made a difference. God help me, perhaps I should have let him bleed out on the floor; if it would have helped me get to Sherlock… if it would stop anything happening to him)
“Well she’s hardly going to understand the challenges of curly hair, is she? I’m fairly sure she’s had that iron chignon since
of stuff going on in your head that I can’t fathom.”
The reasoning behind this became clear when Sherlock dropped heavily into the fireside armchair in the drawing room and leaned towards Murdy, who was curled up on the hearthrug warming her hands around a steaming mug of tea. “Mrs. Duncan. Not an alcoholic, correct?”
Sherlock looked faintly outraged at this, but John nodded as reassuringly as he could manage. “We will. Absolutely.”
John stared. He had seen many strange things in his time. He had seen matchboxes full of mysterious golden light, and inexplicable elephants. He had seen hallucinatory hounds, and fluorescent bunnies.
“Oh, come along Violet! Surely you can’t begrudge me a little fun!” he laughed again, oddly shrill. “-not after you’ve been spreading those dimpled thighs for Singh and Watson-“
(Well at least you’ve perked up enough to make a fool out of me in front of witnesses yet again. You utter git!)
when he died. Never had the heart to finish it, after then.”
A moment later he nearly shouted aloud when he experienced a sudden warm, wet pressure against the sole of his bare foot. It was a strange, slightly sticky sensation; the skin cooling swiftly before the pressure returned, running the length of his exposed arch. His stomach rolled dangerously as he heard a slurred but instantly recognisable voice come from the other side of the wreck.
“I suppose the Reverend will live near the church, then?” John queried, beginning to make his way across the green and disturbing a flock of harshly cawing crows.
John smiled, and knelt on the hearth to add more wood to the fire which was burning a little low. He looked around the shadowy room, which was darkening in the wake of the rapidly sinking sun. The rows and rows of pinned butterflies on the greyish walls caught the light, iridescent wings gleaming in shades of electric blue and viridian. It was a beautiful, odd house and he was reluctant to leave it. He was particularly sorry to leave the huge sagging four poster; when they returned to Baker Street there was the issue of separate bedrooms to address. What seemed easy and natural now, far away from home, might suddenly seem awkward or uncomfortable back in their everyday London life.
“You sure you’re alright with me sleeping down here?” John asked, hesitating before beginning to undress.
“I’m perfectly fine, Detective Inspector. Why on earth shouldn’t I be?!” Anthea retorted. She shook off his hand and swiftly wiped at the corner of one eye with her sleeve.
“Christ.” Violet muttered. She sank forward until her face was pressed into her damp tweed-covered knees. She hissed quietly and with utmost venom: “I’d kill them. I’d kill them all if they weren’t already dead.”
“Aha!” Sherlock said brightly. “I think I know
“I, um. I approached several people. Some in France, Armenia, Turkey, the US… I told them that I’d be able to get them close enough to him. To be able to take him.”
“Nothing doing.” John said firmly, in case Sherlock was harbouring any thoughts of reclaiming the gloves, which were after all, rather nice and very warmly lined. “Jeeeesus!”
“I didn’t want it to have to come to that. I told you before that I wasn’t an innocent, that I had always been acquainted with the mechanics of sex. When I was younger, I… I tried it a few times. I wanted to see what it was like, why people behave in that way. I’d never understood it, though. At best, it was indifferent; but I didn’t like people breathing on me, or the feeling of hands on my skin. Not like that. At worst… well, I was never badly harmed. But based on those previous, admittedly limited experiences, I thought that it could be bearable. That it would be a means to an end; that I would put up with him pawing me for half an hour in return for incredibly valuable information. Time was running out; the attack was less than a week away when I arranged to meet him at his house in Yerevan.
Murdy shook her head and wrapped her long arms around her knees. “No, university. He does counselling for the students there. Teaches a module on classics and theology once a year too. That’s why he has books I’m interested in – tactics and such. He’s offered to get me into the university library during the holidays next year. I mean, Miss Vernet’s library here is great but it doesn’t have any journals or much that’s been published within the last hundred years.”
“Is there… anything else you need assistance with?”
“It will be convenient for you to have a monopoly on off-license sales now, won’t it?”
it; but there would be an unfortunately high likelihood of my death as a result of ingesting the drug.” he rattled this off in a blasé tone, but his face had hardened slightly as he gazed down at John.
quack, John Watson. But I’m not about to let you take the rap for me. It could bugger up your career and I’m not having that. No, don’t bloody argue with me. I’m traumatised. You can’t argue with traumatised women, they don’t like it.”
Lestrade only shook his head, rolling his eyes exasperatedly. “Well, sorry,
blankets?”
“Look, Sherlock,” John said, soft and suddenly tired, “I’m sure you have a
“And here I thought the friendship bracelets were an exaggeration,” he muttered, eyes flicking between them. “Tell me, where’d you get the matching tattoos?”
“No, no, no, don’t be like that. Practically everyone is,” Sherlock muttered, shaking his head with a quick glance up.
“I haven’t a clue what you’re referring to,” she replied, her attention drawn to something over his shoulder before he could respond. “Customers,” she muttered, and John turned around, finding a group of what appeared to be professors coming toward him.
“I’m just saying it’s weird, is all,” Anderson replied, and there was a small squeak, like the one the chair in the corner of Lestrade’s office made whenever he sat in it. “I mean,
Sherlock’s gaze raked the crowd, finding the glinting silver dispenser first, and then the back of the man hawking it, blond hair rippling in the wind over a black jacket.
Sherlock ducked his head before he did something incredibly embarrassing, like grin. “We can look,” he offered, shrugging as if it were nothing of import.
club, tried to tell
John nodded, looking back to the woman. “Cheers,” he said, touching lightly to her elbow in thanks as he moved away, and Mary smiled, bobbing a nod before heading back to her post.
Sherlock stared at the message an untold amount of time, and then heaved in a gasp, his lack of breathing catching up to him with a stitch of pain. Slowly, hands shaking, he pulled out his mobile, sending a quick text to Molly.
“I’ll get her home,” Mike interjected, smiling across at the brunette in question. “I’ll just take Greg’s car. Drop her off and then probably stay at his,” he added, bobbing his head toward Greg, who was blinking blearily at the condensation rolling down his latest unfinished pint. “You gonna go home after?”
Lestrade was still peppering Irene with questions John couldn’t be bothered to listen to, sure Irene wasn’t giving straight answers anyway, and he sighed out at the room, clapping his hands together and looking for something to occupy them with. His laptop was on the other end of the coffee table, the blinking light on the side indicating Sherlock had once again left it to sleep rather than turning it off, and John reached for it, flipping it open and greeted with the login screen.
John sighed, a quick huff of exasperation, and Sherlock felt a strange stab to hear the sound directed at someone else. “No,
Anderson mumbled something unintelligible, but Sherlock couldn’t fathom it was anything but acquiesce, and then clicking footfalls were marching toward him and there was nowhere to hide.
“I imagine it’s rather difficult for some people to tell someone they’re awful.”
At this, Lestrade’s eyes did widen. “And how do you know that?”
Sherlock immediately beamed, and then ducked his head, looking slightly more composed when he met John’s eyes again. “I love you too,” he said, and John needed to record that and set it as his ringtone, his alarm chime, replace every song on his iPod, program their bloody microwave to- “Idiot,” Sherlock added in a mutter, pointedly pulling the phone away from his ear and hanging up before dropping it back onto the chair and retreating from the window to start his practice, and John gaped at the vacant space a moment before bursting into laughter, shaking his head fondly as he slipped his mobile back in his pocket.
“Sherlock, you’re not listening,” he said sternly, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, tugging his hand free from John’s grip. John shifted a small distance back in response, breaking the contact between them as he steadily met Sherlock’s eyes. “I don’t want you to think- I don’t wanna take anything,” he said, shaking his head, and Sherlock frowned, trying to puzzle the situation out in his heavy blue gaze.
“His will be even worse!” Sherlock pleaded, waving an arm at him.
John beat out two freshmen for one of the open showerheads. He focused on averting his eyes from anyone’s privates. He had made that mistake freshman year and he sure as hell wasn’t going to do that again. He lined up his products in a neat little row and hummed the chorus of a song as he rinsed the River Great Ouse from his hair.
Her hair is dark and she’s taller than John by half of an inch. She laughs at John’s jokes. They get dinner every Tuesday. It’s calm and generic and domestic. He tells himself that this is enough. It is more than enough.
¨I’m looking for a flatmate and you’re looking for a flat.” Holmes explained.
September was when the season began. Morning; the atmosphere was heavy, laden down with the innocent hopes of underclassmen. The boathouse swarmed with boys of all ages, vying to get a spot in the Light Blue boat.  A sense of duty was in the air which coincidentally resembled the smell of dead fish.
Mycroft calls. John doesn’t want to know how he got ahold of their address. What he does want to know is how Sherlock is doing. He bites his tongue before he can say another word. Mycroft congratulates them and graces their flat with his approval. John rolls his eyes. Mycroft raises an eyebrow but says nothing. Mary goes to make tea.
He sits in front of an empty page. It’s the first time in ages. Was it always this hard?
“It was highly unlikely.” Holmes rolled his eyes.
“PG Tips is for plebes.” Holmes made his way over to John, easily swinging the cupboard door open and handing the package to John.
“Right. Do you want me to come with?” John stood up from his chair.
When John has to run down two flights of stairs to access a fire extinguisher at two o’clock in the morning, he struggles to be optimistic. His landlord started a screaming fight with him and John may have used some words that he would definitely not use around his mother.
John took a shaky breath and turned to look at him, “Sherlock. This could go one of three ways. One, you allow me to come with you. Easy, simple, the smart thing to do. Two, you put up a fight and end up leaving the flat without me. I wait a couple minutes and trail you for two blocks until you yell at me for being obvious and for bringing my gun. And three, I call Mycroft.”
I decided to take a cue from earlygreytea68 and do a little write-up on crew before I get into the story. You could probably skim through most of this and manage to make sense of a good handful of the lingo they use. Reminder that the characters in this fic will be using terminology exclusive to boating and rowing and sometimes it gets a little heavy.
“It’s a Thursday, John. No one parties on a
(See the end of the chapter for
Bill Murray and Hugh Kavanagh had been handling the sign up table for what seemed like hours. Seasoned Cambridge University rowers, they had been playing this game for years. They also happened to be bored, sleepy, and tired of having to tell the freshmen that they could care less about how many boat races they’d watched before or how many boat race alumni they could name. So of course, they called in backup.
Lestrade smiled good-naturedly. John always made a point to be extremely laid back around his coach. It made for an alarming shock out on the river. The shift from cute and easygoing to domineering and loud was easy for John. It was a good tactic when going into a competition and it always worked.
“Y- you utter arsehole.” John sputtered as Sherlock coughed uncontrollably on the sidewalk. Sherlock raised an eyebrow and opened his mouth to speak, only to be silenced with another coughing fit. “You planned this. So my symphony would keep playing? Major event. With someone who, sadly, is a big part of my life. And you knew, didn’t you? That my symphonies tend to end and begin with acts of stupidity.”
“I can safely say I did not hear anything to do with condoms.” Holmes answered.
“Yes, yes alright that feels better.” Sherlock pursed his lips.
“Said he’d be late. Something about empowering the little people in the world?”
“You know- I think he deliberately cut me off coming round that bend.” John said.
“You needn’t worry, John.” Moriarty assured him, placing an unfamiliar hand on his shoulder, “We’ll do Cambridge proud.”
He ends up calling at least seven different friends that morning, asking if they had a spot on the couch for him. He was on the bus, workout clothes in one bag and textbooks in a backpack slung across his shoulders. John was on his fourth call, trying his hardest to whisper the basic rules of decency to the very indecent Hugh Kavanagh.
“Yes.” Holmes said slowly, “I deduced that ten minutes ago.”
“Likewise.” Holmes said, a slight grimace on his face.
The middle four (six, five, four, and three) are known as the engine room. This is where the boat is widest, so the strongest and the biggest of rowers are put here. Six seat is the tallest. They drive the boat and this where the boat derives its power from. Three seat is usually the rower with the worst technique, it is widely regarded as a safe place where they can’t totally fuck up. Big love to all the three seats out there (I was one too, before I started coxing).
John let out a long sigh and walked over. He put a hand on the small of Holmes’ back and guided him through the drive slowly, “I just saved you from having back problems before you turned thirty.” Holmes snorted. “What? Come on, tell me that doesn’t feel better.”
“So it’s true?” Kav asked, “She’s really replacing McMahon?”
“So, President Watson.” Holmes began, “I was thinking Chinese.”
There is a new grave. He doesn’t lay down flowers and his first visit becomes his last.
“I don’t want to know how you knew that.” John shook his head. He had seen Holmes do this before, at press conferences and interviews. You could say it was his trademark, one of his many calls to fame. Other than that fine arse of his.
Whoa, seven years later and I'm back. Kidding. But seriously, thanks for the feedback and I'll try to be better. Unbeta'ed.
It’s unsettling. John doesn’t like it at all, he wants Sherlock to frown and to make fun of John’s vows and to deduce every single guest within an inch of their life. Sherlock does not do any of these things.
Holmes seemed too preoccupied for small talk. As usual, he had brought on a textbook and was reading through it quickly. John looked out of the window, casually breathing in Holmes’ scent, which by the way was a delightful bouquet of black tea and mint and aftershave. He’d have to find out what aftershave Holmes used. John stopped his train of thought before it could go any further.
John’s arthritis get worse. His bones could play a symphony and his heartbeat is irregular. John's shoulder can tell if it's going to rain.
Then Sherlock Holmes came along. He changed everything.
“You’re insufferable.” Holmes said, “Come along, John.”
“Yes, I believe we are.” Holmes smirked.
“I own three ergometers and and like to keep them in the living room. The couple that lives next door seem to have just discovered sex and can’t keep quiet. My landlady fancies herself to be my surrogate mother. Also, there’s this pap named Anderson who hides in the bushes out front.” Holmes rattled off, “He says he works for British Rowing but if you ask me I think he was fired recently and is experimenting with drugs. Maybe heroin. Possibly cocaine.”
“You’re in the mood for Italian.” Holmes stated, a self satisfied expression on his face. The bus came to an abrupt stop that caused all the boys to surge forward in their seats.
Was he bluffing?
Mycroft says it’s not like him to hold a grudge. John doubts that Mycroft knows what John is really like. Mycroft leaves without his tea.
Bill and Kav walked in and took the last two seats on portside. John went over to them to explain the workout written on the whiteboard.
“Who died and made you Caesar?”
A few hours later, John Watson found himself stripping on the side of the road and jumping into the Thames to save the bloody idiot he called a flatmate.
A very young Sherlock Holmes promised himself that he would never go through that sort of pain. John Watson openly challenged that promise. Sherlock was utterly fucked from the very beginning, because this John Watson wasn’t even the bonding type. Or so he liked to say.
recording- John's listening to a recording during the move, which is basically a recording (duh) of his calls during practice.
He sits in his chair and kisses Mrs. Hudson on the cheek. It’s been years. It almost feels like home.
“I knew you would write as a melody, just like Father and I.” Mycroft said as a-matter-of-factly during one of the rare holidays he spent at the estate. Sherlock pretended not to hear him and turned his attention to moving his sprouts around on his plate. Their mother and father did not look up from their places from opposite sides of the table. Sherlock wished that they would speak up. He also wished for Mycroft to fall into a pit of acid but he decided not to voice this either.
A bystander might say that these boys would hit the showers, get dressed, and leave as quietly as they came.
The workout John explained was done on intervals. When he says "..at a 30", he means stroke rate or number of strokes per minute. Pressure refers to how hard the rowers are moving the oar through the water.
Bonding. It was a very serious word. In ancient times. it was considered fate when your harmony matched with some poor soul’s melody. It was largely by accident, if anyone was going to be honest. No one was really someone’s destined, some people were born well suited to several songs and some people weren’t. Most bonds were platonic anyway. People no longer romanticized bonding, unless they wrote screenplays for some BBC period show.
“Thank you, Mr. President.” John said under his breath.
Kav nodded in agreement, “You know how she likes to wear
“Great.” John said, swallowing hard, “Just- great.”
“You should be rowing.” John replied curtly. He turned his eye on Holmes, assessing his drive until he was sure that the rower was shooting his tail from the catch, “Arse under. Tuck it in.” Sherlock was having none of it, refusing to sacrifice the stroke rate for a technique check.
“I don’t know what that means.”
“It’s a perfect day to catch a cold. Don’t you agree, John?” Sherlock said on a brisk November morning. John had worn his warmest sweater, a ghastly beige number that did nothing for his figure. John Watson looked up from his newspaper, “I guess.... Why would you want to catch a cold though?”
“What about my place?”
“No.” John squeaked out, “No, not at all.”
The next time John sees Sherlock, he deduces Mary’s pregnancy. John is too busy staring at the track marks on his arms. Sherlock catches him staring and hurriedly pulls down his sleeve. It’s too late, John already knows. He doesn’t know if his opinion on the subject will make a difference but decides that he's disappointed anyway. He wonders if Sherlock can tell.
Many of the newcomers who didn’t recognize him began to protest as he walked into the boathouse without so much as a glance at the line. He waved them off, knowing they’d be sorry for it later. John took note of new faces, returning rowers, and christ on a stick, is that Sherlock Holmes? He stared at him for a little more than a socially acceptable amount of time. John forced himself to look away and went to greet the boys. He waved Bill off of his seat and pushed the camera on him.
The grave marker is the only thing she’ll ever know of her mother. She won’t know Mary’s smile or her unrelenting patience or the way she hummed songs whenever she hoovered. He wishes he could change that.
“He’s at the preschool again.”
John talks in the wrong tense for a long time. It’s the one indulgence he’ll allow himself.
“Thanks.” he nodded, “I think.”
“I don’t understand.”
He fumbled with his keys for a little while and got into his flat with a long suffering sigh on his lips. He set down his bag and made his way towards the kitchen. John was a man on a mission. Right now, his prime directive was to find some food for his grumbling stomach.
“Don’t let me disturb your shower. I expect you’ll be needing a breather after that practice.” Holmes said.
The current was decent, nothing that they couldn’t handle, and the wind was more soothing than unforgiving. John had been hard on them during water practice, yelling through the pieces and incessantly calling out strokecoach times. Once they docked in, the rest came naturally. Up and out, over heads, split to shoulders. They had put the boats away quickly and didn’t say a word during Lestrade’s after-practice recap. Adler announced that she would be holding the dehydration test the next week. No one complained.
“Mike.” John whispered, “I thought you said they were American.”
John gathered his things and went off to follow Holmes, trying his very best not to trail him like a lost puppy. He had a feeling that the enthusiastic whip sounds the boys were playing behind him meant he wasn’t doing very well. John decided to pick apart their conversations for the day, justifying that the whispered “Bless you” during John’s sneezing fit in the boat meant that Holmes was madly in love with him.
“Fantastic.” John breathed.
“You’re thinking.” Holmes cut into John’s internal monologue, “It’s putting me off. Go away.”
“We’re still bonded, Sherlock. Having to hear your song at your funeral hurt and...God. I-” John’s breath caught. “The bond should have dissolved, platonic bonds are weaker than most. But it didn’t but I forced myself to believe that it was just me. When you came back, I thought it was because you weren’t actually dead. Because that would be the logical thing right? The smart thing? Oh christ. But still- Sherlock?”
“You know, my music started when I fell from trying to climb a stone in a playground. Harry laughed about it for ages. I know that she was scared. Hell, she was more scared than I was and I was the one who actually got hurt.” John said, “I was stupid. Young, yes. But also stupid.”
It’s not as if John didn’t know that his landlord wasn’t the most law abiding of citizens. When he thinks about it now, John doesn’t know why he was surprised. Yes, the flat was a good size and the rent was reasonable and the other tenants were nice enough. Save for one Mrs. Delancey who always liked to talk about how much John looked like her husband. Which he really doesn’t, he’s seen pictures.
“I hear you’re in the market for a flat.” Holmes said.
This day was shaping up to be the worst day he’d had in months. John didn’t even want to think about afternoon practice. He went over his options in his mind, directing his eyes to an advertisement. Anything not to make eye contact with any poor soul who had heard him talking to Kav.
But not today.
Mary wants them to write their own vows. John agrees because a relationship means compromise or something like that. He realizes that he’s been compromising for a long time. He figures that compromising means love, in a strange sort of way. Sherlock never wanted him to because John deserved better and also these women are idiots and come to the crime scene, it’s urgent and I need you.
And if he sometimes sees a tall shadow against the trees, he doesn’t say a word.
There’s a lot to be said about the Cambridge boys.
“‘M fine.” John sighed, “Pass me a towel, Kav.”
in which the racing season starts, Sherlock Holmes wears spandex, and John starts a small fire.
“That’s not what Rome is about, Caesar.”
Mary asks who he was.
“My ulterior motive in this situation is not, in fact, to shag Holmes but to get a bloody roof over my head!” John yelled at him, “Don’t walk away from me! I’ll murder you! I swear to god- Bill!”
“Kav’s a dickhead.” John breathed, cursing the day he met Hugh Kavanagh, “God, I’m going to kill him.” His sweatpants slid on easily and John tightened the waistband.
John’s first symphony was titled “Pain” which made sense because his adolescence was rife with it. Or at least thats what the conductors used to say. After Harry came out as a lesbian, their father became uncontrollable and John’s mother seriously considered severing their bond. For their wellbeing, they left the village and had their music transferred to Royal Music Hall in London.
You got to the end of my sad attempt at explaining rowing and for that I congratulate you. To be honest, this fic has been in the works since 2012 and in the light of recent events, I decided to get on with it. It's not finished, though I do have some residual chapters from 2012 waiting to be revised. I have a general overview of how I want this to go and I’m loosely basing it off of a movie called True Blue.
The season had gotten off to an alarmingly good start. The boats were primed and ready. New recruits were pouring in. Lestrade had an undeniable skip in his step. Adler had replaced that idiot McMahon. Bill and Kav didn’t set the boathouse on fire.
“I should’ve listened to my wife! She always said taking on university students would be a liability that I wouldn’t want to deal with!” he made ungodly gestures towards everything in his flat as he said this, “And I can’t deal with this! Look at the floor! Look at the walls!”
“Both sides are to switch between rowing at a thirty at 90% and a rest period at an eighteen, half press. The thirty is in sync, stroke is man up front and that’s Matt Callaghan. The rest period is technique work. After fifteen, you’ll want to be heading to the weight room. Adler wants your measurements.”
John swore when his phone pinged. Idiots. You’d think that two of the best rowers this side of the continent would be able to handle a bunch of university students. He rolled his eyes and left Donovan to finish with the boat rigging and told her he’d check the lateral pitch later.
“Johnny! Will you please keep it down?” a voice from upstairs called.
“No.” Sherlock took off his suit jacket, “You were brave.”
He screams at learner drivers blocking the road, he screams at the too small tvs at the local pub, he even goes so far as to scream at chip and pin machines for not accepting his credit card. That’s why he was a coxswain. That’s also why he’s banned from every Tesco in a five mile radius from his flat.
“They’re our ticket, John.” Mike assured him and then  went on to detail every bit of their rowing history, from Jim’s first time in the coxswain’s seat to Seb’s personal 2k record. They would laugh at weird intervals and John came to the conclusion that the inside jokes were definitely not lacking in their friendship.
“Shut up.” John held a finger to Holmes’ lips, “Just- shut up.”
“You know, you’re in the running for CUBC’s cutest couple. Save for Hunt and his mirror.” Callaghan remarked from the locker across from them. Hunt cursed at Callaghan and threw a pair of pants at him.
“What is that supposed to mean?”
John endured the bus ride by expertly putting his workout bag on his lap. Holmes was coerced into sitting next to him by Bill, who had shot John an obvious wink. Holmes raised an eyebrow but didn’t attempt to engage John in any conversation for the rest of the ride.
There’s a lot of press leading up to the boat race. There’s usually some sort of company that sponsors it. The Challenge happens at the Autumn Reception, where the presidents of the boat club that lost the past year will challenge the other club to a race.
Everyone around him got the general vibe that he was a massive prick. They weren’t
“The floor didn’t look that good anyway, tell your wife she can’t decorate for shit.” John spat out. He left his landlord to assess the damage, “I’m going to get my laundry and you can start putting advertisements out. God knows you’ll need to.”
He was done for.
“Jesus- Holmes don’t sneak up on me like that.” John said as he closed his locker. He turned and was met with a shirtless Sherlock Holmes. He was dripping wet and equipped with only a towel to cover his lower half. John licked his lips.
“I told you-”
Weeds begin growing around Sherlock’s grave. The flowers begin to wilt.
“Told you I’d be back.” Mike smiled, his glasses pushing up on the bridge of his nose as he spoke.
And every single sentence ends with Sherlock.
“Are you-”
Holmes was fully dressed by the time John got his act together. Gray joggers complimented the black hoodie he had put on over his long sleeve. Holmes took out a pair of slides from his locker and John laughed.
The boys finished their workout soon after. Lestrade gave out instructions for the next half of opening day. They were to head off to the weight room to have their official physicals done. Run of the mill stuff, height weight, BMI. Adler wanted to save dehydration tests for later, which elicited a sigh of relief from all the rowers.
Then Lestrade started yelling at him for forgetting to check the stern pitch of the Vespoli.
“You work fast, Three Continents.” Bill laughed, “Known him for a day and you’re already shagging?”
“You’re making me nervous.” Sherlock rolled his eyes, typical John. He went to the closet to fetch his coat. John’s eyes followed him, brow furrowing as the minutes progressed.
“Your rooms will be right around this hallway.” Mike said, “I called in a few favors, so they should be habitable.” Moriarty smiled and picked up his bags as he entered the room. Moran gave John a curt nod but said nothing. John shrugged, can’t win them all.
“With who? Your hand?” Callaghan rolled his eyes.
Sherlock has a knack for making everyone around him go mad. His return is no different. There is shouting and throwing and misuse of illegal firearms. John has missed this but decides not to say so.
“You’ll be off to tank with me.” John replied, “I’ve got to get these things off to Lestrade.”
You’ll see the coxswains refer to their “line” and their “point”. The line is an imaginary course that coxswains project onto the river. It governs where they turn and where they steer straight. The point is simpler, it’s where the boat is projected to go. Most coxswains use landmarks to fix their point. Say, if a boat is pointed towards shore and the coxswain doesn’t fix it, the boat will beach, or end up on land.
She gets the newest treatment quicker than expected and her name seems to jump to the top of waiting lists. John is sure that a certain minor government official has something to do with it.
“What about it?”
“I guess. Is direct- bad?” John shrugged. After a lot of practice and possibly some mistakes, John had learned that it was easier to get to the point. There was always that someone at a party who translated a friendly smile as an invitation to get in his pants.
He was, after all, the only one.
“What else have we got live for?” Holmes drawled, coaxing a breathy laugh out of John. He waved his goodbye, expecting Holmes to reciprocate only to realize that Holmes was looking at his phone once again.
“Just start. I swear to god, you two are going to give me an ulcer before I’m out of uni.”
“You’ll find that’s it’s easier and more efficient if you sit on the upper half of the seat. So tuck it in, Holmes.” That got his attention. Holmes attempted a fix but the thirty prevented him from making any major changes. He huffed, frustrated.
“Well? Go on! Let’s see if you last three minutes there! Better them than me!” his landlord banged his fist on the wall and came away with reddened knuckles. His first instinct was to shake his hand out but stopped to salvage his pride.
He also excelled at breaking into John’s flat.
“Don’t beat yourself up. Your flat sounds like bloody Buckingham Palace compared to mine. Except for the sex crazed couple next door and your maternal landlady.”
“I didn’t take you for a nosy git.” John snapped, “Jesus. Sorry. I did- I’m having a bad day.”
“Anything for my coxswain.” Holmes smirked.
John has never been a creature of habit but now he goes out to Sherlock’s grave more often than ever. The flowers are always fresh and the water always clean. The inscription reads clearly. John’s speeches are eloquent and reminiscent of who they once were. Together; against the rest of the world.
“T-straps have a distinctive strap that runs vertically up the middle of the foot, said strap connects to another part of the shoe closer to the ankle. They can be found on both heels and sandals. It’s also not uncommon for several t-straps to be on one shoe.” Hunt answered.
John had been waiting on the stoop of Holmes’ Montague Street flat for what seemed like hours. Holmes later informed him that it was only thirty minutes. He had groaned when he saw the moving van parked outside his building but shut up when he realized that Holmes wasn’t going to call the movers off
Mary wants to know if Sherlock is coming to the wedding. John says no. He delivers an invitation to Baker Street anyway. Mary sets aside a place on the seating chart.
He had always wondered what it would be like to have his music play out in a music hall. He would only be able to visit his symphony in privacy, but to look upon the music of others! How exhilarating it would be to walk amongst hundreds of people without interacting with them at all. The very idea made him giddy with excitement.  The scores were the lifeline of the population. No one could imagine living without them, without the steady downbeat guiding them through life, without the uplift of a crescendo.
“Yes, right now.” Mike pushed him towards the door.
“Oh for god’s sake, just drink your tea Caesar.”
“Definitely not.” Holmes shook his head. What the hell was that supposed to mean? John resisted the urge to bang his head against the locker.
“Use protection!”
“But you don’t want Chinese.” Holmes cocked his head to the side, examining John closely, “Do you?”
Like much of the gentry, his music was under close surveillance, held in a state of the art vault in the heart of their estate. They retained the same concertmaster that had looked after Holmes family symphonies for so long that Sherlock could not remember a time when he wasn’t cataloguing scores in the library or entertaining him with anecdotes about his family history. Reginald knew his job, and he knew it well. The Holmes’ never once thought about replacing him and Reginald never thought of retiring. It was the way it would always be in the Holmes’ family. And it would probably never change.
Focused and determined, they could move boats through the water and come out with low splits and high rates. When given the right push, they could clear puddles at forty strokes per minute. They could pull sub two without breaking a sweat. All of them felt they deserved a spot in the Blue Boat, even if they knew well enough that half of them would be gone by November.
Rigger bolts attach onto the boat via gunwale and are tightened and loosened with wrenches. A loose one could mean the loss of a rigger altogether.
Stage Two, the doctor says. John takes a shaky breath and Mary reaches for his hand.
John shook his head. Idiots. He went over his homework for the night. Why did he ever think signing up for this many classes was a good idea? He tallied up the work that he could afford to put on the backburner. It left him with about three hours’ worth. Which left him with a new question, how much caffeine could he consume on the drive back to Goldie?
There is no more screaming at the grave. Only silence.
Holmes. He had sauntered into the boathouse, a bored look on his face, not paying attention to queue of boys before him. Holmes was dressed fashionably, toting around a brand name athletic bag and expensive racewear. He surveyed his surroundings and sighed deeply. Holmes proceeded to the back of the line and ignored any conversation directed at him.
“When have I ever not been sure?”
than accepting that I like you?”
John smiled, a little sadly, and Sherlock’s insides somehow even further withered. “Well, it’s only a practice,” the blond shrugged. “We can probably handle that without our mascot,” he added with a smirk, and Sherlock, as was expected, glared. “How long you gonna be?” he asked, and, taking that as permission, Sherlock stood, shrugging as he passed toward his wardrobe.
“I’m 23!” Sherlock spluttered, glaring as John laughed, and then pulled his coffee toward him by the handle. “It’s a bit disconcerting,” he muttered, tipping the cup slightly toward him, “drinking something that’s
Gently, slowly, John stretched out his arms, practically holding his breath as his left hand slid beneath Sherlock’s to lift it, afraid that even a blink out of place would startle the man back to his room for another day they couldn’t get back. He started to unwrap the cloth, his right hand trembling with the forced slowness, and then froze as Sherlock twitched, the subtle spasm halting John’s heart. He took a few breaths, waiting for Sherlock to draw his hand away, but the retreat never came, and, after a moment, John continued his work, unwinding the remainder of the bandage without incident.
“Thank god,” he breathed, holding John too tightly for him to even attempt to reciprocate the embrace, but Lestrade released him a moment later, moving his hands back to John’s shoulders as he held him out for examination. “When Mycroft told me, I- Well, I could hardly believe it! I mean, the evidence was so- And the DNA-” He shook his head in bewilderment, his palms slipping from John’s shoulders as he stepped back, still scanning over his form like he couldn’t trust its corporeality. “I-I can’t tell you how much I- And Sherlock,” he continued, voice breathy with relief as he turned to the detective, causing Sherlock’s jaw to stiffen and John’s stomach to roll with trepidation. “I can’t even imagine how- I mean, you’re probably- You must have been
“What, hand-holding?” Sherlock scoffed, and John glared at him.
They both jumped, turning toward the door, and John couldn’t speak for Sherlock, but his own heart was absolutely thundering.
“She was left-handed,” he answered, sifting through the photos. He lifted one out of the pile, twisting it around and sliding it across the mess. “Toothbrush on the left side of the sink, toiletries on the left side of the shelves, fingerprints in makeup residue from a left hand on the mirror-”
“Then he will disappointed. Now, why don’t you go make sure everyone has enough towels or something. And do not speak that man’s name in this house again, do you understand me?”
There was no room for a question in it, and it was correct anyway, so John remained silent and waited.
The foggy figure appeared to smile, the world darkening as he bent down, kissing Sherlock gently on the mouth, and then he slipped off the bed, mumbling something about being right back.
“You saw Victor? Where?” Lestrade blurted, his eyes flicking urgently between John and Sherlock.
“Well,” Sherlock muttered, shifting his head side-to-side on his neck, and then laughing along when John picked up again.
Harry then hesitated, mouth opening and closing a few times as her face grew taut with thought. “John?” she finally said, looking up at him through the tops of her eyes. “I know it won’t make any difference, I know you’ll do it anyway, but I just wanna say…” She lifted her face, eyes sad and focused. “Don’t go back,” she pleaded, shaking her head softly. “You’re better here, I can tell,” she continued, and he dropped his eyes from her desperate ones. “Don’t let her pull you back in.”
“Anyone?” Sherlock echoed, and John shook his head. “Why not?”
John nodded, typing in the order before taking the bill Sherlock passed across, ringing it in and counting out the correct change. “That’ll be right up,” he said as he dropped the coins into the man’s hand, Sherlock smiling politely in acknowledgement, and then turned to the espresso machine, surprised to see the dancer lingering beside the counter out of the corner of his eye. “So,” John started, because he could do this, he could totally do this, small talk with faintly flirtatious overtones practically his expertise, “chemistry, huh?” He blinked down at the nozzle of the espresso machine, internally congratulating himself on the
Sherlock quirked a puzzled brow. “Shouldn’t someone?” he replied, holding John’s gaze as he blinked at him, mouth flapping soundlessly as he struggled for a response, and then seemed to take pity, smiling softly as he shifted at the sauce on his plate with a fork. “I call in tips to Scotland Yard,” he explained, shrugging a shoulder as if that were a perfectly normal pastime. “Or I used to, anyway. Now, they tend to call me. Well, one detective does, anyway, D.I. Wilmot.”
“I skimmed it.”
“Even so,” he started, shaking his head, “I’m really not-”
“He didn’t say,” Mary replied, shrugging down at the screen as she replied.
Lestrade gave him a withering look, and Sherlock drew himself up straighter.
John shook his head down at him, smiling, and then moved back to his drawers, grabbing pajamas before crossing to the bathroom and getting ready for bed. His blue pajama trousers were worn down to fraying at the hem, and the old grey shirt had holes in the cuffs of the sleeves, but they were comfortable, and he happily hooked his thumbs through the worn openings, creeping back into the dormitory.
in which the boys move into Montague Street, Holmes showers (naked), and John forgets how to breathe.
She makes plans to go off to some far off country. She wants to be free. She sends postcards and packages. She so desperately  wants to change the world. John can’t help his overwhelming pride. Maybe he isn’t such a failure after all.
John swallowed and nodded. Holmes had been relatively friendly during practice, joking with his partner and laughing at the terrible jokes John cracked. He had smiled at John when he caught him looking at him while he loosened his oarlock. John had blushed and looked away.
Weigh-ins are routine and done regularly in most crews. The Light Blues are predominantly heavyweight. Coxswains who cox males are expected to be 120 pounds at a minimum.
And it was quite a shame too, since Harry was kind of counting on mandatory hospital ice cream. She got grounded, in the end. And that was John’s consolation.
“But then I wondered- I thought, maybe it’s not platonic.” his voice trailed off and John laughed. Embarrassed? Nervous? Onset of hypothermia? “Maybe-- maybe Sherlock Holmes is in love with me.”
“Girl in your intro chem class. Generic name, probably Elizabeth or Abigail. Only said yes to this date because she’s hoping you take her somewhere expensive. Parents cut her off. Stress eats her roommate’s food instead of buying her own. Roommate’s out of town. She’s interested in her Psych professor. Been trying to have intercourse with him for months. If she wears slingbacks tonight, she already has and is going to drop you. If she wears t-straps, she’s decided to settle for you instead.” Holmes stopped, looking expectantly at Bill. Some of the freshmen still hadn’t gotten over Holmes’ deductions, the poor souls
“What the
“With all due respect, Your Highness,” Sherlock snipped, wide blue eyes blinking toward him, “if that were true, I wouldn’t be here.”
“If this guy’s as important as you say he is, why would he need you?” Lestrade muttered, clearly an attempt to rile more information out of Ethan by wounding his ego, and it would most likely work. “You’re just a Uni dropout. Why not get someone more qualified to take out his competition, someone smart enough not to get caught?”
“You know what I mean,” Sherlock murmured, fiddling at his fingers again.
“One!” John shouted, lifting his mask up to grin as Sean swore. He glanced at Sherlock, a question in the lilt of his brow, and Sherlock shook his head, twirling his hand to indicate they could carry on without him.
Eventually—what was probably seconds, but felt like roughly an hour—they broke apart, both panting, John surprisingly strung out considering it wasn’t
“Never sicker.”
“Not here,” he hissed, bobbing his head down the corridor to the left, and John followed with a nod, his dark brown oxfords tapping softly over the marble.
“But how can you
“You don’t know how long you’ve been together!?” Mary hissed, looking up at him with incredulous disapproval, and John shook his head, rubbing at the injured bicep.
“You shouldn’t have left,” he said, answering Sherlock’s questioning glance with a nod, confirming they could talk freely. “It’s much easier to protect you in a controlled environment.”
John came back from the dead more attractive, Sherlock was sure of it, although most of that could likely be attributed to the whole assassinating a trained assassin to save his life thing.
Anderson stood at the top of the stairs, a large cardboard box held in his hands as he looked anxiously between them. “Sorry,” he muttered, shuffling closer along the corridor, and, as he passed beneath an overhead light, Sherlock could see the shadows stretching down from his bloodshot eyes, a day’s worth of growth darkening his jaw. “I-I brought-” he started, twitching the box in his grip, and Lestrade stepped aside, waving him in.
“Nothing but to bask in your sunny disposition, sire,” Sherlock replied, and John ignored him, the best strategy to take with petulant children, or so he remembered from his younger sister. “I wanted to go over your schedule for the day,” he continued, stepping just inside the bathroom and opening the binder, tongue flicking out to dampen the tip of his middle finger as he flipped through the thin pages.
Sherlock blinked, confusion and building terror prompting him to speech. “What?” he murmured, eyes widening when John’s narrowed, but then the blue was drawn down to the wound he’d nearly forgotten about on his lip, which stung anew now, his fingers instinctively lifting to the spot.
John looked out the window, watching the country roll by, his phone clutched in his hand. He wanted to text Sherlock, wanted to see how he was doing, wanted to tell him about the conversation he’d overheard between the two teammates sitting behind him—“She said
how he needed John Watson.
“-is Sherlock going to be upset about this all night?” John asked, turning the ball over where it sat in his lap, and, slowly, the words ‘
John’s voice rang out in the silence, and Sherlock stared hard at the ceiling, trying not to think about what he knew was going through the minds of the trio just down the hall.
John’s throat closed up.
He startled, choking on smoke as he spun around, coughing and blinking wildly as he found John’s curious face through the grey haze.
Sherlock started, blinking his bleary eyes up as he lifted his forehead from his knees.
“No one deserves this more than you,” Mike finished, and then swallowed, dipping his head briefly to his lap, and John figured it was about time he said
“Raid was a bust,” Lestrade muttered, shaking his head bitterly as he checked the magazine of his gun, stroking down the line of bullets. “Obvious we just missed ‘em, which means-”
John snorted. “Just sort of playing,” he echoed bitterly, sinking down onto the worn leather sofa. “Right. Of course.” He held his indignant expression for a moment, and then slowly smiled, and Sherlock ducked his face, shifting his weight.
Belatedly, his heart began to stutter, as if only now catching up to the awkwardness of the previous moments, and he hovered outside the dorm for a few seconds, slowing his breaths. When he thought he no longer looked like he was about to pass out, he leaned in to the door, listening for movement, and then gently rapped against the wood.
“Hmm?” Sherlock hummed, frowning down at his phone.
“Utilities,” Sherlock added, and John tipped a nod. “Groceries.”
“Yes, I’m sure you raced right down,” Sherlock snapped, full of false cheer, and John took the sibling spitting contest as an opportunity to stand himself up, brushing his black-and-white-striped jumper smooth and trying to wrangle the back of his hair. “Just
It was coffee, the expensive stuff Sherlock bought and never let him use, but it was in John’s mug—a ridiculous novelty thing he’d picked up in London at some point that looked like a plain Pac-Man screen until the heat made the dots and ghosts and such appear—and on John’s desk, so, logically…
me!” he more mouthed than said, and Sherlock sneered, tongue protruding from behind his teeth in a way that made John want to modernize some primary school playground insults, but a muttering voice behind them prompted him to freeze.
smile again, the one that told Sherlock he had, on yet another exceptionally rare occasion, said exactly the right thing. John didn’t say anything, however—which was probably for the best as Sherlock’s throat had now closed up—and merely nodded, releasing Sherlock from the hold of his eyes as he looked back to the television.
to work for me, and any one of them would have the good sense NOT TO DISOBEY MY ORDERS!”
Sherlock opened his mouth, and then closed it, dropping his eyes to where his fingers twisted in his lap, but he had to say it, had to be brave enough for John. “Because she has you,” he said, looking up, “and you make people want to be better.”
with you lately? You’ve been all over the place!”
“At least I’m gonna say that I tried.”
“Charmed,” Irene purred with her most innocent grin, and Lyle quirked a brow, slowly stowing his gun back in the holster on his hip.
knew that. “Nothing,” he muttered, lifting a hand as he shook his head. “We’ll figure it out tomorrow. Anyway, night.”
“A platonic female acquaintance?” she echoed, voice tart, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, slumping over his half-eaten meal.
“You think I don’t know that? I’m not quite senile yet,
“Whatever it is, I don’t want it.”
He didn’t move, couldn’t do anything but force himself to keep breathing, the air agony as it dragged in and out of his lungs, and it was a long moment before he noticed things had gone quiet, warily tipping his head toward the door.
John’s shoulder twitched toward him, the beginning of a turn, but then stopped, doubt etched in the rigid lines of his back.
The swan that approached him now, however, was not Harold—was, at best, Harold Jr. or Harold III—and probably didn't have any divine wisdom to offer about anything, but Sherlock quirked a brow at it regardless, meeting the beady black stare.
“Oh, hi!” a voice said from behind him, and he turned to find John emerging from the storage room, box of dark roast beans cradled in his arms. “You’re a little late, aren’t you? Usually you’re in around 2 if you come in during the day.”
“Sherlock, say something,” he pleaded, voice choked, and Sherlock could picture all too clearly the fear in his eyes, magnified by the layer of glittering moisture that was surely covering the blue surface.
“Yeah. I think he’s asleep now though.”
His phone number? People were asking for John’s
“Oh, please, just because your father is now involved with a man doesn’t mean everyone around you-”
John barely managed not to gape. “You- You cleared a shelf for me?”
, I can’t keep you at arm’s length, I don’t
John’s mobile number stared back at him, ten numbers neatly sketched in thin blue ink, and, just like that, it was clear.
“What the- Sherlock! Sherlock, what are you doing!?” He clamored up after him, reaching the landing just seconds after his bedroom door thwacked open against the wall.
Mary chuckled, stepping to Harry’s side and turning out to the group at large. “Guys, this is Harry, my friend from the cafe”—Harry lifted a hand as Mary waved toward her—“and her girlfriend, Clara.”
had best be getting her beauty sleep.” She rose from the sofa, dropping a squeeze to his shoulder just as John entered the room, looking curiously between them. “Goodnight, dears,” she bade, patting John on the arm as she passed, and he frowned after her, turning a raised brow to Sherlock when she disappeared down the stairs.
Moran flinched, just the slightest twitch of his eyes and dip of his head, but the man noticed, of course, and chuckled softly.
“I still have to check you over,” he said, attempting to guide John up into the ambulance, but John jerked his arm away and walked up the collapsible steps himself, glowering at Sherlock. “You may not feel the extent of your injuries due to shock.”
“What?” Sherlock questioned, confusion sparking through the shame in his eyes, but John wasn’t in the mood to be the one answering questions, and rolled his eyes, moving to turn around again.
Irene nodded.
“You got
and he was just…John.
Sherlock carefully refrained from wrinkling his brow as he tried to recall any art he had seen while interloping through John’s rooms that morning, but a glance at John’s pinched smile told him there was no such painting to remember—at least, not in plain view.
At first, there was no reaction, Sherlock holding the sidelong gaze as he blinked, and then his forehead furrowed, grey eyes brightening to flint as they scanned John’s face. “Really?” he muttered, and John huffed a laugh, shaking his head in disbelief at the man’s uncertainty.
tomorrow, you know that!”
Watching John’s lips shift around his breaths, the light from the street dancing in his tousled hair, Sherlock felt something sweep through him, like a star forming in his chest, drawing in every doubt and fear to form one blazing truth that radiated out to the tip of every hair standing on end.
“I’ll be back within the hour,” Sherlock broke in, giving the woman a pointed look of censure, and, though she looked as if she were going to ignore it, John beat her to it, huffing out a frustrated snarl as he stepped past her.
Sherlock bit his lip, looking up at him out of the tops of his eyes as he waited.
John nodded enthusiastically, tugging his laptop toward him. He yawned, covering it with the back of his right hand while his left swiped across the track pad.
“I never liked him. None of us did.”
“How would that-“
“Oh really?” John slurred, folding his arms. “And what, pray tell, do you have?”
“Yes you fucking can!”
John held his gaze, eyes narrow and jaw shifting, and then huffed, rattling his head in defeat and twisting open the door. “Stay behind me,” he commanded, a reasonable compromise, and Sherlock nodded, following a few steps behind as they made their way downstairs, picking around the creaky spots.
! And I’m expected to believe you’ve had some
“No,” John snapped, folding his arms across his chest, unable to believe he was having this conversation in a room full of adults, “he’s just helping out. He’s the consulting coach.”
“Hello?” he said as he swung the door inward, half expecting to see the fuse burning out on a bundle of dynamite as he poked his head into the room. There wasn’t any dynamite, but he wasn’t sure if what he did see was much better.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder to see Greg laughing, not helping him in the least, and then he shrugged with a farewell wave of his hand.
“I don’t know, you might!” Sherlock countered, and John sighed, shaking his head down at a swirl of whipped cream as he drizzled caramel over the surface.
“Out.”
“I’ll see ya around,” she said, smiling brightly as John nodded, and then withdrew, stepping back to Clara’s side.
“Because that wouldn’t be classy enough,” John prodded, grinning now.
“You don’t have toothpaste?”
“You know what you need?”
Galerre was a small country, the kind of place one only really heard of if they were attempting to sweep the geography section of pub quiz. It was comprised mainly of mountains covered in snow and valleys covered in sheep, but the castle and capital city were nestled in the former, the landscape streaking by beyond the glass an endless sea of towering pines and brush strokes of glittering white sweeping up the rocky slopes. The road was winding and climbing, pressure building behind his ears as a gentle snow began to fall, but it dissipated as they started down the other side, and Sherlock’s internal clock informed him time was nearly up as a restless energy started to fill his extremities, his fingers strumming against his knee.
“Do they regularly talk back?”
believe someone would actually be interested in me?”
“Well, that’s decidedly untrue,” Sherlock said briskly, bending down to peer at an office set on the desk. “I laugh at you all the time, Anderson.”
John laughed, his one time meeting Mycroft no doubt enough to be entertained by the visual. “Well, I wouldn’t want to deprive you of
“She’s definitely cheating,” he stated in way of an answer, and the woman sat down beside him, a soft smile he pointedly didn’t look at on her face. “Her wedding ring’s nearly gone green with tarnish. No happily married woman would let her jewelry fall into that level of disrepair.”
Sherlock smiled, ducking his chin as he rocked back on his heels, feeling Molly’s eyes boring into the side of his face as it was his turn to avoid her gaze.
“But I don’t
“Oh, yeah?” Lestrade scoffed. “How many times she been in ‘em?”
Jordan passed it to Eli Caine eventually, but the poor boy was almost immediately tackled, and, with the ball hopelessly lodged in the resulting ruck, they were now lining up for a scrum. Taylor was in the middle of the front row, shouting threats John chose not to hear as he crouched down behind him, Mike at his side.
“Really?” Sherlock mocked, tipping his head as he lifted his brows. “
work.”
He looked to Bonny, leaning in close to the cage. “You don’t think he meant- No,” he decided, shaking his head. “No, of course not. That’s ridiculous.” He bowed his head to the clipboard, pen poised, teeth pinching his lip. “Right?” he asked, lifting his face again.
“It was the only logical conclusion, so I brought a picture of him ‘round to every mobile phone dealer within five miles of his home and office.”
Sherlock stared at him a moment longer, and then lifted the card up with a flourish, turning his face away as he shoved the script-swirled interior beneath John’s chin. He curled his whole body away once John had taken the card from him, bending his knees up to rest the soles of his feet against John’s back, folding his hands into his armpits in a stroppy version of the fetal position.
John pushed down forcibly on his shoulders, sending him bouncing back to the mattress as he pinned him there.
John smiled down into the blankets while Mrs. Hudson tutted.
“We won’t tease him,” he swore, and then switched his drink to his left hand, lifting three fingers of his right aside his face. “Scouts’ honor,” he added, dipping his head, and Mary, after one last scan between them, turned on her heels and stalked out of the room.
This chapter became such a behemoth, I gave it its own title in my head: "Of Foils and Violins."
“That’s not even the worst part!” Mary exclaimed, Irene drawing in a breath and taking a long sip of wine, as if to prepare herself for the thrilling conclusion. “Harry goes over to tell him he can’t rearrange the furniture—”
She lifted a fragile smile, her eyes far away. “Don’t suppose there’ll be any appearances to keep up with mine,” she mused, a swallow clicking down her throat. “Do you know if they were...notified?” She flicked a glance up at him, furtive and vulnerable, and John was reminded just how young she really was, how unfair life had been to them all.
On Sunday, leaving 221B early to head back to Langley, John had declared it finally time to begin the ‘Doctor Who Initiative’, as he had grandly pronounced it, a precarious tower of pizza boxes, Haribo, and soda cans balanced on his palm as he had nothing less than kicked open the door of the laboratory. Sherlock had raised an eyebrow—the first of many over the course of the day—but had obliged, helping John to make makeshift curtains—“You have to put tape across the center too or it’ll just keep falling!” “Maybe your sheets are just too heavy!” “Don’t be petty, John. Just because your sheets are of a negative thread count-” “I’ll tape your mouth shut, Sherlock, I swear I will!”—and even swallowing down some of the Haribo, although that much he did when he thought John wasn’t looking.
“Sherlock-”
“Jesus,” John hissed beside him, pulling Sherlock out of the scene for a moment to look at his friend. His blue eyes were closed, his face pained as he dropped it down and to the side.
“No, but I doubt it,” John replied. “He was carrying something, a folder. Looked like a case file. He came out of the file room back there.” He tried to point back up the way they had run, but his arm crumpled as he clutched his bicep back to him with a pained twist of his mouth.
“Actually, a tinge of yellow should be present.” Holmes piped up.
time period - I should have addressed in the beginning but I've set this in 2017. Mostly because that's when the new Ely  Boathouse is projected to be finished.
All rowing equipment is expensive, all of it. This is why membership to any private rowing club is not great for your wallet. I row with a school so I only pay 1500 dollars a year, roughly 500 dollars per season. This is not counting the fees for trips to other regattas and nationals. Great, right?
“They’re trying something new. Adelaide got kicked out of the old one.”
“Then what do I want?” John held his breath as Holmes scrutinized him.
.” Kav said.
“That’s one, Cambridge. Big push through here. Good. Coming up on three. Here we go, focus ten for power through the drive. Length, catch here 2 seat, again 2 seat. Yeah, that’s it. Back down in 2, ready 1 and 2.” John listened intently to his recording through his earbuds. He needed to focus more on rhythm, this was abysmal. Better luck next time.
boathouses - There's Goldie, which sits on the River Cam, and Ely, which is on the River Great Ouse. As I said before, I'm going off of the blueprints for Project Ely which is set to be finished two years from now.
“If you’re looking to win the Boat Race.” John shrugged.
“He means are you this much of an arse all the time?” Kav explained.
Sure, there was some couple, the landlady, and an ex-journalist lurking about. But Sherlock Holmes would be lurking about too. And John sure as hell wasn’t going to complain about that.
“Holmes.”
Sherlock fades into the background.
I think that's it for this one. Kudos/comments are a gift from god.
John tells his therapist. She’s happy for him, for the both of them.
“Aren’t you supposed to be asking me questions?”
There had been a rumour going around town that John would take after his Great Aunt Elizabeth, who had written late. She went off-key several years later.
“That is not what happened!” John cried, “And it happened two minutes ago! How the hell did you-?”
“Have a nice day?” Holmes said, a confused look on his face.
“You obviously recognize me.”
“Doesn’t matter. Keep rowing.”
He will do anything not to remember. He takes pains not to pass by Bart’s and will always take the longer way around. He moves out of Baker Street at record breaking speed because it doesn’t feel right to live there anymore. Not without Sherlock.
“Pass me the soap, Callaghan!” Kav yelled, “I know you’ve got it!”
The characters will be rowing the Boat Race. It is an annual boat race between the Oxford University Boat Club and the Cambridge University Boat Club. It is rowed between two eights on the Thames River in London. Oxford rows on the Thames but Cambridge rows at the Ely Boathouse, on the River Great Ouse. All in all, there are four boats selected to row the race. The reserve crews, Isis and Goldie, and the final or Blue crews.
John is the President of the Boat Club and not many coxswains have done that in Boat Race history. But I really love John and thought it fit. The President is elected by the boat club and has a say in the workouts that the rowers do.
“Jim.” the stranger drawled, “Jim Moriarty.”
“Good morning- oh.”
“And where am I meant to go?” Holmes asked.
“I trusted you!”
Sherlock scoffed, “For science, of course.”
The line moved quickly as soon as John reorganized the signup process and yelled at Kavanagh for texting seven different coeds underneath the table. Holmes soon came to the forefront. John smiled tightly at him. He didn’t smile back. John shrugged it off and straightened the clipboard, ordered Bill to take the damn photo, in this century please, thank you, bless you.
“Chin up there, Tom.” Lestrade projected to the boy sitting in starboard eight. Tom jutted his chin out, “No, no. Not like that.” Lestrade walked over. John gave the room a cursory glance, scanning for errors and taking note of technical mistakes.
Alright, last bit. The stroke. The rowing stroke starts at the catch, when the oar is placed into the water. The rower will then push with their legs, allow the boat to pick up momentum before swinging with back and then will take the arms in. This is called the drive and the resulting position is the finish. The finish is when the rower is closest to the bow and vice versa for the catch.
“Well, if you’re sure.” Bill turned back to his bag and took out a condom, winking at him as he put it into John’s back pocket. John bristled.
“You trusted Julian Fellowes!”
“Fuck.” Bill said, “What’s a t-strap?”
John laughed, “Why are you telling me this?”
“But- weren’t you at Eton for a year?” Holmes raised an eyebrow. John coughed,  “I read it- somewhere.”
There is overgrowth around the grave. The granite no longer shines.
They have a good life together. She takes mostly after Mary but she has John's blue eyes and the same sad smile. And John thinks that it is enough.
Time passes and his daughter grows. Everything becomes blurred. John’s hopes of reconciliation dwindle with every passing day.
John Watson likes to scream.
“Don’t get too ahead of yourself.” John griped. Which was really super funny because Holmes could probably murder his closest friends and still convince John to live with him. God, he could ask John to marry him and he’d say yes on the spot. Maybe. Probably not. Actually, definitely. Yes.
“Oh! Right. Chinese is fine.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“Ta, Holmes.”
They had met at Goldie to take the half hour ride to Ely. The bus ride was uneventful, scattered whispers asked for help with calculus or a drink of water or for Bill and Kav to please turn the music down, christ, is that One Direction? My seven year old sister listens to that. Turn it off. Now.
He meets up with Mike Stamford. Mike jokes about how old they both are. John laughs along and makes a few jokes of his own. John is distant and Mike notices. They both know why he’s really there.
Crew teams do a hell of a lot of land workouts. Endurance and speed is crucial in a race and crews cannot just rely on water practices. There’ll be lots of references to tanks and ergometers. Tanks are indoor facilities that mimic conditions that rowers would experience when out on the water. It’s basically a bunch of sliding seats and riggers attached to large pools of water. Ergometers are known as ergs in the US and ergos in the UK. Ergometers are indoor rowing machines that simulate the action of rowing on water.
The walk to the lecture wasn’t long. But the professor seemed dead set on going over the allotted time. How long could someone talk about muscle density? Really fucking long, John found. He tried his best to listen to the professor drone on and on about the makeup of the brachioradialis and wrote as much as he could hear (which was not a lot).
Say, a small fire.
He was getting weird looks from the people around him. One particular character looked as if he’d be very interested in having a girl on his couch. “Right. Yeah, you sound like you’re having a lot of fun. No, I don’t want to know what she’s got down her throat. I’m hanging up now. Bye, I said good bye Kav.”
The first four rowers from the coxswain seat are called the stern four. The bow four are the four rowers closest to the bow. Middle four are the ones in the middle and outside four are the stern pair and the bow pair.
But John was proud and Harriet’s friends were persuasive.
He had worked too hard and for too long for some idiot to take it from him.
Mycroft got him the much needed help after lots of yelling and lots of bribing. Sober Sherlock was generally lauded as the worst Sherlock for a while. Then he decided to stop being sorry for himself and thank god for that because by then, half of London had been mixed up in one or two of his temper tantrums.
“What’s her name?” Callaghan leaned forward.
I might be biased in this because I am one but coxswains really are the foremost person in the boat. A boat would literally get nowhere without a coxswain. Many overlook the coxswain but it happens anyway. We do not just sit in the stern and yell “Stroke. Stroke.”
practice times - I go by the actual CUBC practice schedule. The boys have Mondays off, Tuesdays and Fridays, and weekends. They have practice twice every weekday, in the morning and in the afternoon. Mornings are spent at Goldie for core and erg sessions. In the evening, the boys are driven to Ely on the River Great Ouse for water practices. On weekends, they arrive at Goldie and then drive to Ely.
“Erg room, I know.” he nodded. John raised an eyebrow. “I managed to get my hands on some blueprints. Boathouse layout is very important to an effective team. Though I gather that you-” Holmes trailed off as he saw John yawn, “...could care less.”
“We’re matching.” John said, pointing to his own.
“I’ll see you at practice, yeah?” John asked, lingering in the aisle.
“Right.” John paused, “Do you make a habit out of being this rude?” Holmes made a face.
John masks whatever pity he has because Sherlock wouldn’t want to see it. Sherlock bites back deductions about Mary’s character because John wouldn’t approve.
After three days of living together, John and Holmes settled into a familiar routine. Wake up, crew, school, more crew, take out, and if they had time, crew. It wasn’t anything they weren’t used to but having someone else to complain with made it ten times more enjoyable. Apparently, misery did love company.
“This is my stop.” John said, lifting up his workout bag.
“I worked at Clarks for a year and a half. Women’s section, obviously.”
“Flatmate.” Holmes corrected over his shoulder.
John huffed. He was seriously reconsidering his life choices. Now the whole team was convinced that he assaulted Holmes. John Watson, creepy president who’ll try to get you off in a communal shower.
Boys were running around, chasing one another, yelling creative obscenities. Others flushed the toilets constantly, in hopes of blasting the boys showering with arctic cold water. Still others wrote and drew on the whiteboard that displayed the workouts and Bill was complimented profusely on his talent for drawing male genitalia.
Seating in the boat is crucial. In eights, there are (surprise) eight seats. These seats slide, allowing for maximum mobility. Four rowers row on starboard side and the other four row on port. Many athletes try their best to learn both sides, to ensure flexibility and likelihood of being put into the top boats. Bisweptuality is becoming more common in crews and it’s easy to see why.
Lestrade reminded them that any funny business with the freshmen was not to be permitted. After weigh ins, there was to be an outdoor cooldown and then a final meeting with the coaching staff. Again, he reminded them not to bother with any mischief regarding the freshmen. Absolutely no repeats of last year. Lestrade glared at Kav and Bill when he said this.
Mycroft always mentioned how problematic his reliance on John Watson was. The best way to get him to shut up is to mention his diet or the current international crisis or both.
“I’m going to get off. The bus. God, I’m not going to
Mike tells him about Sherlock. Apparently, he’s done well for himself but continues to be a recluse. Lots of high profile cases, nothing anywhere near what he and John did. He’s currently living between Baker Street and a cottage in Sussex. He keeps bees. Mike starts to talk about his constant experimentation with drugs but catches himself and stops out of respect for John.
“I will not have a PG Tips fanatic under my roof. I insist you convert immediately.”
Their father died when Sherlock was nearing university age. Heart attack or something equally insignificant. Mr. Holmes was a shadow, someone who stood behind Sherlock in pictures and loomed over him at the dinner table. He had been knighted, but Sherlock could never remember what for.
“I didn’t take you for a commuter.”
“Yes.” Holmes affirmed, his muscles straining in the tight long sleeve. John’s brain function lagged as he noticed a very real, very visible pair of nipples peak through the fabric.
This didn’t stop Sherlock from going through his medical history, which boiled down to a directory of London’s best conductors. John Watson’s fifth symphony had been in rest since Sherlock had taken the fall. John had been looking for a reason why ever since. Sherlock knew why. He had always known.
“Lestrade likes us to take note of first impressions. So we can separate the dickheads from the decent and morally educated.” John conceded.
“Whatever. Drink water, have a good night everybody, stay safe.” John said.
“That’s quite direct, don’t you think?” Holmes said, looking up from his phone screen, finger caught mid-scroll on some sort of word document.
Sherlock Holmes came from a long line of melodics. His father was a melodic and so was his father before him and so on and so forth. Boring. Mycroft had written as a melodic early on and Sherlock was expected to do the same. And even though he knew it was not likely, he secretly hoped he would write as a harmony.
John writes. He writes about unconditional love. A fleeting memory, a loving touch. He writes about the stars and the solar system. He writes about his heart and sentiment and chemical defects and god, all of this. He writes, for hours.
“Burn in hell!”
John woke up to the sound of Holmes erging away on his Concept 2. He wasn’t kidding when he said that he owned three of them. Holmes was always using them, day in, day out. John was sure that he kept an hourly schedule. All three ergs were kept spotless and extra batteries lined the bookcase.
“Stop listening to your blasted recording and help me with this box.” Holmes said, or maybe yelled. All John could see was Holmes’ rapid mouth movements. John took out one of his ear buds and made a motion for him to repeat, “Take this.” he pushed a large cardboard box into John’s arms.
Sherlock offers him tea. John declines. They sit across from one another. The rest of the conversation is continued silently.
But there were more serious matters to attend to.
“Right. Let me get this straight, I can’t sleep on your couch because a girl has already taken residence?” John spoke into his phone, “No, Kav. I’m just wondering how you pull off a one-nighter on a Monday? And also why you woke up halfway through the night to go and sleep on your bed. Alone.”
“Sorry- what?” John asked.
“What you really, really want.” Bill and Kav chimed in. John broke eye contact to glare at them.
In many instances, coxswains are stand ins for the coach. If anything goes wrong out on the water, it will be blamed on the coxswain. If the actual shell breaks or is damaged, it is widely regarded as the coxswain’s fault. What rowers do not know is that they are liable for any damage done to their personal rigger and oar.
People change, they say. No, they don’t. Not Sherlock. Not for John.
“Actually.” John began, “I’ve got a more permanent standing regarding his flat.”
“So what’s the deal with you grabbing Holmes’ dick and then tripping on his shampoo?” Bill asked, his head trying to fight its way through the opening at the top of his shirt. If it had happened at any other time, John would be laughing his head off.
In the army, the pill came with their daily rations. Spending so much time with people in life threatening situations was a perfect place to form a bond. With their added age, there was a greater chance of compatibility and to dissolve such bonds would be painful.
“At least there aren’t more people on the coaching staff than on the ergos.” Lestrade shrugged.
“Fine. Come along.” Better not to tempt fate.
“What?”
Needless to say, his brain was much more concerned about his new living situation. He started making plans to move out, maximizing time spent with Holmes doing so while coordinating with their practice times. John wanted to get out of his building as soon as possible and he reasoned that his quality of life had tripled ever since Holmes asked him to be his flatmate.
“Get out! I’ve got a date tonight!” Bill ushered the boys out.
An amused noise. “Sherlock.” he said, offering his hand, “Sherlock Holmes. But you already knew that, didn’t you?” John laughed as they shook hands. He made note of Holmes’ grip and the calluses that marred his palms. “You must be John Watson.”
Racing shells have outward riggers that extend beyond the gunwales. The riggers are attached to the oarlocks which hold the oars in place. A boat can either be rigged for sweeping (one oar for each rower) or for sculling (two oars for each rower).
“Oh!” Holmes hesitated, “Yes.”
But then again, a bystander would be wrong.
Coxswains are also held responsible for the coxbox, an electronic device that monitors stroke rate, elapsed time, and number of strokes. When attached to a headset, it works as an amplifier. Most boats have wiring and speakers throughout that allow the coxswain’s voice to be well, amplified. If it’s broken, a good coxswain will improvise and start yelling into the boat.
“When you told me that it was highly unlikely that the producers would kill off such a number of characters in two seasons and that I should go ahead and finish Downton Abbey.” John huffed.
Then Sherlock Holmes walked onto the bus. His gaze darted around the bus and didn’t settle until his eyes landed on John. He made his way to where John was seated and took residence in the seat next to him. Everything was just fine until he started talking.
Second seat is like the stroke seat, but in the bow. They set swing pace after bow seat. Bow seat is the last seat. Both second and bow are smaller than the others, as they are located in a thinner part of the boat, they must have a good sense of balance.
Much love to Carrie and Gaby who offered up advice and help as I wrote this. You guys are the best.
“I know it’s fine.”
Whenever he’s been sitting too long in the hospital room, John’s thoughts drift to Sherlock. His wife is dying in front of him and all he can do is think of Sherlock bloody Holmes. He switches to thinking about how much of a failure he is.
“May I have everyone’s attention, please?” John projected, “Please arrive here at 6:30 am for core, as always. Weights session tomorrow will end fifteen minutes short for dehydration tests. Adler will yell at you if your piss doesn’t make the cut. Your piss better make the cut. Are we clear?”
“What do you want?” John said.
The recovery comes after, the rower will do what they did during the drive, but backwards. Drive consists of legs, back, arms and the recovery goes arms, back, legs. In between all of this, lots of mistakes can happen. In the interest of the reader, I will not go into every single one and will instead do my best to describe technique corrections when mentioned.
John could feel Holmes’ gaze bore through him.
“Neither, actually.” Holmes said, “I had a tutor. Had to focus on crew.”
“Thank you.” Sherlock said as John let his gaze wander around the room.
“It has a nice ring to it.” Holmes laughed.
In the same instance he grabbed Sherlock’s waist, his fifth symphony began to play again, after three years of being in rest. It signified lots of things and some conductors could write pages upon pages of analysis about the meaning of that note or why this note was coupled. None of this meant anything to Sherlock. All that mattered was that John’s song continued.
He was taking far too long to just wash the man’s hair, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop running his fingers through the sodden curls. He was surprised when Sherlock broke the silence, beginning to talk in a low, measured tone.
“Although…” Violet brightened up a little, and leant closer to John. She spoke in a stage whisper as Sherlock took a seat opposite him. “-did he ever tell you about the time he tried to create a Philosopher’s-“
“That’s Miss Argyle’s place.” she said gruffly, nodding towards a small neat cottage next to the school.
This is a very short chapter compared to the others; but I think it works better this way. More updates in the next few days!
“Who said anything about breakfast?”
“You know, as we have no guarantee that we’ll be sleeping here tonight…” Sherlock began thoughtfully, then paused to clear his throat. “And we have approximately forty minutes before Violet wants to see us…”
Her skinny finger traced a dotted line that weaved through farmland and valleys, into the mass of darkly ringed mountains that stood between Hilderbogie and Invergordon, beyond Inverness and the Moray Firth. “I mean, it’s what I’d do. There’s only so many roads they could take. They’ll
She held it out to John, who took it from her carefully. He felt rather honoured; he hadn’t actually seen any of Violet’s work before now.
“No, no – just wondering if she was here,” John said hastily, attempting to stem the flow of excess information. “Just, er- if she does show up could you let her know that her husband is looking for her? Must run. Thanks so much!”
“Would you rather sleep somewhere else?” John asked, straightening up and dusting off his hands. “There’s got to be more places to sleep round here.”
Benjy seemed to glower at John, appearing to blame him for upsetting his owner. The claws dug just a little deeper. “You seem very reluctant to suspect Freddie Garcia, Violet.”
“So, you see the kind of influence those Antonelli girls have been under. That Woman has been a friend of their family for years and I know for a fact that she has continued her interference in their lives. She gives them unsuitable reading material and seems to think it
“And what did you have in mind for this?” John asked him, after quickly retrieving the bottle from the bedside cabinet. He grabbed a cushion from the sofa and dropped it to the floor, sinking back down between Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock paused his shameless masturbation, and took hold of John’s empty hand. He guided John’s middle and index fingers to his mouth, and John moaned quietly as they disappeared between Sherlock’s wet, full lips. Sherlock released them all too quickly, after working his tongue around their lengths in a way that left John gasping quietly.
John stared at her, deep unease giving way to dread as he watched the way she was clinging to the branch. It was wide and sturdy enough, but he didn’t think that it would take his weight as well as hers. He didn’t think that she would be able to return to the riverbank unaided, though.
(Undressing him. I’m going to slip his clothes off his fucking beautiful body and touch him. Oh,
She leapt down from the windowsill with a crash, and grabbed hold of his hand. “Come
“Twenty-three. Poor wee thing.” she said darkly. “She had no parents, nobody to warn her about falling in with that lot. I tried, the Lord knows, but she wouldn’t listen to me.”
He held her anguished gaze for a long moment, leaning so close that his forehead almost touched hers. It was shockingly intimate, their breath mingling. He fancied that he could hear her heart racing, her pulse thrumming against the gleaming steel of the wickedly sharp blade.
“Oh. I, er. I see…” John said quietly, fighting an impulse to back away slowly without making sudden movements. “Um. Right.”
Sherlock glared. “Get. In.”
She sat silently for a several seconds, avoiding Sherlock’s penetrating glance.
John remembered Sherlock’s face when he’d curiously levered the lid off the matte black box. Of course he’d divined what was inside even before he’d accepted it from John’s hands. John had tried to be off-hand, casual (
“Looks like she’s about to have a serious chat with her dad…” John added, watching Murdy and Mr. Antonelli heading towards a table in the corner. “He doesn’t look too appalled, though.”
John gathered some clothes and tiptoed into the bathroom, not wanting to risk waking Sherlock. Although there was a distinct possibility that they were sharing a roof with a murderer, John was glad that they had made the journey to Scotland. It was almost worth it just to watch Sherlock devour all the food put in front of him, and to sleep an entire night through. John didn’t tend to fuss over Sherlock’s disdain for sleep or force him to eat; but certainly now and again he nudged him towards his bedroom or handed him a couple of biscuits if he was looking too wan. As he made his way down to the kitchen however, John wondered idly if it might be a good idea to ship the man up to Edinburgh now and again, so that Violet could feed him up and push him into a cavernous bed.
(Yeah, right.) John chuckled quietly to himself, catching sight of Violet waving at him from the kitchen door. When he entered the warm room, scented with the aromas of roasting chicken, onions and rosemary, Violet was wiping her hands dry with a tea towel and humming to herself. She gave John a smacking kiss on the cheek and handed him a large fruit scone, warm from the oven and dripping with raspberry jam.
“You want to know what it was like?” he asks tentatively.
He paused suddenly, and grimaced. John looked at him curiously, and after a second or two he became aware of the cause for the hiatus. He could hear approaching footsteps coming towards the door of the library, which stood ajar.
Sherlock kissed him gently, and John could feel the faint smile in the curve of his lips as the clever fingers worked their way around to his belt buckle. “You can be such a sentimental idiot, my dear John.” he murmured, his voice rumbling low as he rubbed his cheek against John’s ear.
Patrick smiled at Sherlock warmly. “Mr. Holmes, we aren’t in London. This city is full of dark closes, unlit lanes and tunnels. There are very few security cameras compared to the capital. I think that losing someone is much easier in this part of the world. Particularly, perhaps, if they don’t wish to be found.”
John barked out a laugh which came out as an odd sound somewhere between a cough and a sob. “You won’t
It was dusty under the bed, and extremely dark. John sneezed convulsively, and rapped the top of his head smartly against the wooden underside of the bed. Swearing furiously, eyes watering, he stretched out further to feel around the perimeter of the carved legs. Luck was on his side, however, and after a few seconds his questing fingers encountered an oblong shape duct-taped to the inside of the side board. He scrabbled at the tape for a moment or two, before successfully tearing it away from the dark mahogany. He gingerly started edging his way out from under the bed, listening carefully for any indication that George knew what he was up to.
with the scenario.”
“I’ll show you
“Mrs. Duncan’s the type who looks for the good in anyone. She thinks of most of the town as her friend,” Murdy called back over her shoulder. “Even a twisted old bag like Miss Argyle.”
John decided not to ask and contented himself with moving back to Sherlock’s side. He slipped an arm around Sherlock’s waist and squeezed his side.
“Mr. Antonelli is an utter treasure; but he left the naming to his late wife who was a woman who had evidently read far too many Georgette Heyer novels. She died around ten years ago. Of natural causes,” Violet added, deftly flipping one of the drop scones at least two feet in the air and adding another ladle of batter to the griddle. “Toni is the oldest; she’s twenty two and is studying accountancy in Glasgow. Pruny and Rab are the youngest; they’re twelve, and they’re little terrors,” Violet smiled approvingly. “Pheemy is next after Petty, and she’s a bit of a drip but essentially harmless. Plays the piano at parties and sings with her eyes closed, regardless of whether anyone wants her to, which they generally don’t. I’m fairly sure that Griz is an amateur poacher, and Murdy always appears to be plotting world domination at any given moment. I’m good pals with their dad, not least because I did him a favour and told each one of his daughters the facts of life when the time came.”
John didn’t like the idea of Mrs. Duncan wandering the banks of the river at dusk at all, not with slushy snow and mud covering the narrow path that ran alongside the water. What on earth could have convinced her to make the trip?
John raised his eyebrows. “What, you haven’t figured it out already? You haven’t fished around in my head or looked at the turn-ups of my jeans and come up with the reason?”
“Karl was involved in a lot of things, things I wasn’t aware of til much later on. One morning he showed up at breakfast, with a bad cut on his cheek and blood all over his coat. His hands were shaking and he went straight for the brandy on the sideboard. It was several hours later that I realised that the blood on his coat could not possibly have come from the wound on his face. It belonged to somebody else. It was a lot of blood. Philip and Hedda barely reacted to it at all.
“Well, yes. I mean, don’t get me wrong, she seems like a marvellous woman. But not quite...” John grimaced. “She’s not very... um...tweedy.”
“The sun seems to be going down already.” John noted, after another several more miles of pensive silence.
” Violet asked incredulously. “I mean, I’ve got a bloody good imagination, and that’s beyond mine.”
Much love to you both (and a big wet kiss especially for John)
“I’ll take as long as I bloody well need.” John replied, without rancour. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and held him tightly, all too aware of how fast Sherlock’s heart was beating. “We’ve got all the time in the world, anyhow.”
“Then let go of my arm, please.” John said, with more than a hint of steel. George seemed slightly surprised to find that his bony hand was still clutching John’s upper arm. He detached them slowly, with a great show of wiggling his spindly fingers.
“Are you aware of anyone who would want to cause you harm?” John asked gently.
.” John muttered darkly. “And who spent years trying to get Sherlock to believe the same.”
John didn’t respond, merely folding his arms and looking at her expectantly. He felt vaguely grateful that he had plenty of experience in not reacting when her comments hit their target. And honestly, he wasn’t entirely sure which statement was true. He didn’t want to hurt her. He never wanted to see her again, he wanted her gone with every fibre of his being. He just needed to know whatever information she had, and then he wanted her gone. He didn’t particularly care how.
“Getting married to Mary, it was a train set in motion before you got back. What the hell was I supposed to do? I didn’t even know I was in love with you then! And it was a disaster, it was already a disaster waiting to happen. Even without me thinking we were going to have a family. I knew when I married her we’d probably end up divorced in a few years but that’s just normal odds for people these days. And all the while you’d been egging me on, folding bloody napkins and helping with the bridesmaids bloody dresses and I believed that you wanted me to have that life, Sherlock! You taught me how to dance, so that I could do it with someone else!
famous. And I only married one of her offspring; that’s hardly any at all!”
Rosie sighed and shrugged theatrically at Sherlock. “He sees, yet he does not-“
“That Patrick Singh, fellow. What do you make of him?” Menzies asked, after a pause.
“I can’t really think about it right now, Sherlock. I don’t know. It probably doesn’t matter, does it?”
They lapsed into silence.  Sherlock gloomily studied his thumbnail. He felt the weight of John’s gaze on the side of his face and the heavy clouds of the afternoon sky seemed to visibly darken.
“Sherlock, do that again and you’re in
After a second he felt Sherlock’s hands prising his fingers away from his face. For a sudden mad moment, he was tempted to resist or to made a bid for freedom down the corridor. Sighing, he dropped his hands, and looked up at Sherlock who was regarding him with a mixture of fondness and incredulity.
Sherlock shrugged under the weight of her head on his shoulder. “No, not really. I mean, if I absolutely had to, I would do it with you. But I can’t imagine it. I’ve never really understood why people want to do it. I mean, I can tell that you’re very attractive.” he added, slightly apologetically.
Sherlock glanced around, his interest piqued. “Primitive mourning rituals?”
John stared at her pale, worried face and remembered how Patrick had hauled her out of the freezing river, only a day before. How Patrick had taken off his scarf and wrapped it round her neck as she stood quaking in the cold. He remembered the dark, relentless stream of blood that flowed from the deep wound in Patrick’s side.
“Why did you have to come into my house, Murdina?” the Reverend sighed heavily. “I mean really,
Pruny chimed in. “That one with all the bluebirds and bunnies on it! IT bloody reeked of her perfume. She grinned nastily and turned to Sherlock. “It had
John finally got around to asking Sherlock if he’d try using the massage oil, and ended up falling asleep when Sherlock got a bit too interested in the freckle patterns on his shoulders. He woke up twelve hours later, feeling better rested than he had done in months and surrounded by sheets of paper covered with anatomical sketches, diagrams and equations calculating the distance between each mark on his skin and a detailed timeline showing the ages John had been when he had developed each mole. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen, but when John tracked him down at a crime scene in Hackney and sheepishly apologised, he was greeted with blank incomprehension.
Patrick tilted his head a fraction, coming to lean against the tall door frame as he regarded Mycroft thoughtfully. His indigo blue scarf dangled from his hand and as he spoke he ran it gently between his fingers.
John glanced towards the fireplace, where Sherlock and Violet were still huddled beneath the massive painting. (Ah. Interesting.)
“He’s a policeman; of course he’s heard of Sherlock Holmes!” Petty countered. “Oh, and of you too, Doctor Watson,” she added hastily.
“It wasn’t as if anyone was looking for her or waiting up for her. Violet was still annoyed about the painting of Hilary that Sandra had defaced, she wasn’t going to go looking for her. Phyllis might have, but she was in the conservatory with Katy at the time. Patrick was with Violet in the library, then headed out for a

Hi there, just to let you know I am taking part in the Fandom Trumps Hate auction and I'm offering Sherlock, Harry Potter and Check Please! fics to support some amazing charities. Bidding runs from the 12-19 Jan 2017. If you're not interested, I'd still really appreciate it if you could spread the word on Tumblr - details on my blog :)
Mycroft seemed rooted to the spot, and he simply stared after Patrick for several seconds. After a while, he sighed quietly and bent to pick up the scarf that Patrick had carelessly dropped on the tiles. He made no attempt to follow Singh, or to return the item to him; instead he gently looped the length of fabric around his hand and slipped it into the pocket of his jacket.
And it struck him later, that this
“Here.” Sherlock said brusquely, pushing an innocuous brown paper parcel into his hands. John stared down at it as the detective turned to his sock index, selecting several pairs of ostensibly (but absolutely, definitely
“What? That’s what you were doing in the study earlier? I thought you were working on the case!”
“Thursday evening!” Violet interrupted, frowning. “But-“
Patrick slipped into the last empty chair slowly, pulling the heavy seat towards the table with silent ease. John watched curiously as his strong graceful fingers slid into the indigo folds of his silk scarf and pulled gently; the fabric tightened momentarily around his long neck before gliding free, causing the thick dark waves of his hair to slip over his shoulder. It gleamed in the light from the heavy silver candelabra.
Mycroft make a slight moue of distaste at this, but chose to ignore her. “Patrick said that you had some mutual acquaintances in India. That you had spent a considerable amount of time there, some years ago.”
“My grandmother objected to the neckline of that dress, probably thought it was a bit common to show your cleavage in the church. You altered it to keep her quiet, then readjusted it this morning when it was too late for her to intervene.” As he rattled this out, Violet idly wondered if this was merely an excuse for a teenage boy to stare unabashedly at her assets; then decided that it probably wasn’t. “You didn’t really care that much about the dress; but you do like scoring points against your mother in law.”
Mr Antonelli hadn’t exactly struck John as a criminal mastermind, but he tried to look encouraging. Sherlock on the other hand looked honestly intrigued at what she was saying, and seemed to be hanging on her every word. She preened a little.
“A thermal camera.” John said, a faint flicker of hope in his chest. “What range does it have?”
“Oh, I shouldn’t let it worry you, Auntie Vi. As far as I can tell, there are no immediate plans to set the dogs on you.”
“Locatelli. You enormous fucking
“Oh, er. Thank you.” Reverend Duncan said hoarsely. “You’re very kind.”
Sherlock shook his head slowly. “No, John. Nobody in this house killed Freddie Garcia. Come on, think it through.”
“What the hell is that?” Violet asked curiously, as Anthea pulled out a bulky device that appeared to be somewhere between a small telescope and a digital camera.
“I don’t
The fire slowly began to devour the logs, a slow wave of heat creeping into the room and permeating his chilled, soaking clothes. The shaking began to ease a little now, and he started to regain sensation in his feet, registering the ache of raw wet skin against unfamiliar boots. He gingerly unpicked the knots in the laces, easing them off his cut and grazed flesh. His feet were dead white, although the blood was rushing to flush the blistered toes and heels as they warmed. His right ankle was by far the worst injury he was sporting; the deep cut still sluggishly oozing blood from when he had wrenched it free of the wreckage.
“We... we only found one gin bottle.” Menzies said weakly, after a few moments.
John just nodded, and inhaled deeply. He squeezed Sherlock’s hand between both of his own, and looked up into his pale face. The expression in his tired eyes was resolute and unexpectedly tender.
“And by romantic, you mean sexual.” Sherlock said flatly, before draining the last of his coffee.
(Oh, god. That arse. This shouldn’t be so exciting, should it? Oh, god, I’m going to sink my finger into him. What sort of noise will he make when I touch him there?)
“So it was a member of the WI who did it?” John asked, realisation dawning.
one,” he warned Violet, who whacked him on the backside with her discarded newspaper as he passed her end of the sofa.
cook like Violet!” Sherlock muttered darkly. “It never made any sense; but that horrible baggage was always
“Oh, you think so?” Sherlock glared out of the window, his fingers worrying fitfully on the edge of his blanket. “Because I don’t. Go and talk to her, John. It’ll all seem
Murdy heaved a long suffering sigh, tipping her head back and closing her eyes with an expression of weary, disgruntled resignation. John stifled a grin, and watched her slouch past her sister into the shop.
Basil Montague sat next to Hilary Jessop, and John could tell from the angle of his upper arm that he was holding her hand under the table. He was a slight, pleasant looking man with short tufty dark blonde hair. He was perhaps two inches shorter than Hilary, and something about his posture and expression suggested to John that Basil didn’t quite believe his luck at finding a girlfriend like her. “Quite. I’m sure that the local chaps are doing their best, but they really don’t seem to be getting very far. I would have thought that they'd have found him by now-“
“Oh.” John breathed out, with sudden realisation. “Oh, I see-“
“That’s bad luck.” John said politely. “Tell her I’d be happy to have a chat if she’s not feeling well.”
A mournful looking girl of around seventeen wandered out, her eyes swollen and brimming with tears. She was dressed in a rather sad, floppy floral dress under a long trailing cardigan and she sniffed convulsively as she came into the corridor. Rab and Pruny rolled their eyes theatrically. She was accompanied by another girl, strong jawed and short-haired and dressed in very sensible walking gear and boots. She raised an eyebrow at the sight of John and Sherlock, but nodded at them civilly enough.
“Oh please, Mycroft. Go ahead and be indelicate.” John said coldly. “After all, you’ve already been insulting and supercilious.”
. The bloody ghost at the feast.”
Pushing through some overgrown ferns, he was startled to come face to face with a cross looking woman holding a very large metal syringe.
There was more than one gasp at this, and John belatedly realised that while everyone had known that Garcia was dead; it was definitely
(Fuck.
Sherlock hummed, non-committal. “Make sure you vet any lodgers carefully. The Camden Strangler was perfectly friendly to his landlady; right up until he-“
“You do bring me to such lovely places, Sherlock,” he muttered after they had put a reasonable amount of distance between themselves and the silent men.
But it was all academic, really. John might be willing to admit (most likely after a couple of drinks) that he wouldn’t be averse to sharing a bed with Sherlock in more ways than one. But John didn’t have the slightest idea of whether Sherlock would like to do anything more than sleep next to him. It was obvious that he liked John’s company, liked sharing his space. It had moved John, the way that Sherlock had hesitantly admitted to liking touching him as he slept.
Petty slumped against the counter moodily and crossed her arms. She suddenly looked very much like Murdy. “Yes, alright, apart from that git. Hang on, speak of the devil-!”
, Mycroft.” Sherlock cried. “Go and find one of those disgusting mars bar things John mentioned, they sound right up your street. I will damn well deal with you later!”
“Arse. So was that how it ended?” Violet asked, wincing.
“But I’m
“Oh god, why do you people always believe that talking about things helps? Talk, talk, talk! Tell me, John, did talking to your therapist fix you when you came back from the horrors you went through in Afghanistan?” Sherlock stared at him challengingly. “Sometimes the world just goes to hell and there’s nothing to be done about it. Nothing can change it.”
“Oh god. We’re cuddling.” John half-laughed, shutting his eyes and revelling in the shared warmth. The feel of Sherlock’s body stretched out bonelessly against his own. “Actual bloody cuddling.”
John shook his head. “I didn’t see any sign of him.”
“Happy Christmas, ridiculous darling man.” John murmured into the back of the sleeping detectives’ neck, and slept.
Once they were out of sight of the kitchen, Sherlock allowed himself to move a little more slowly; leaning on John a fraction more heavily than he would usually have done.
At this point, the kitchen door opened and Mr. Brodie appeared in a rush of cold air. His face was ruddy from the chill, his shoulders and fading blonde hair flecked with snowflakes. After allowing Scunner, his small terrier, to trot over the threshold he closed the door hastily. He smiled at them all as he toed off his heavy boots. “Morning, everyone! How are we all this fine morning?”
John’s fingers found themselves wrapped around the back of Sherlock’s neck, holding him steady. “Patrick- he needed surgery. They airlifted him to Aberdeen just as we were leaving to come find you.”
“No, I am bloody well not! I’m frozen and they’re fucking big and I seriously doubt they go by Queensberry rules, Sherlock!”
Sherlock smiled at her faintly. “Good. What else?”
(Oh, god. It’s not like I don’t want to; but this is potentially a really incredibly Not Good idea…)
Sherlock inhaled deeply, screwing his eyes shut. His heart was painful, dark and heavy and he hated it. He was almost sure he hated it. It was all just… so much.
“That’s the ordinary snowballs.” Pruny supplied helpfully, and frowned slightly as she appeared to recite something from memory. “It

was a surprisingly interesting publication, if of little practical value for a locum GP in London. He mused that it might be quite a nice change to find a patient with Japanese lung fluke; it would at least be more intriguing than the usual asthma, flu and rashes he was currently dealing with.
“Yes, I do.” Sherlock said calmly, folding his hands on John’s chest and resting his chin on them. “I need you to know that I still want this. I know that earlier, things didn’t go as smoothly as they could have done. That was not your fault, and I don’t want you to feel like you have to keep away from me. I
The bedroom began to feel a little chilly, naked as they were. John shivered slightly, determinedly ignoring the ache in his arse and the way a tear had persistently trailed down the line of Sherlock’s knife-edge cheekbone. He wasn’t going to call attention to it.
The sheer envy had hit John like a blow. He had been so relieved when they found the man, almost giddy when he and Sherlock had rounded up the three teenagers responsible for his capture. Nobody had died, which was always nice. But he could feel the elation draining away rapidly, only to be replaced by aching jealousy. Mr. Travers had everything John had lost, wrapped in his arms just a few feet away.
John sighed, and got to his feet. Getting forcibly ejected from interviews with suspects was nothings new; but this was pretty fast even by their standards. Sherlock continued to stare steadily at Mr. Jameson, who raised a faintly trembling hand and pointed towards the door.
Patrick was watching them with a faint expression of concern. “Myc, we can change the reservations; why don’t we take them? I don’t mind.”
“Good. That’s-good. But. Um, please, could you get off me now? I’m planning to breathe while I sleep, alright?” he pleaded. With a poor grace, Sherlock shuffled off him but kept his arm wrapped around John’s waist. John inhaled deeply, trying to order his thoughts. He slipped his own arm around Sherlock loosely, who made a pleased sort of sound before sliding his hand up under the hem of John’s t-shirt.
“What? How?” John asked, perplexed. He picked up his notes again. “I mainly heard a lot of evasion and pseudo-poetic wank!”
“I knew that he desired me. He had made it quite clear, from quite early on in our acquaintance. I informed him that I was entirely heterosexual, but it didn’t make much difference. He watched me constantly, made tiresome remarks about my appearance and was generally rather a nuisance. He managed to restrain himself to the occasional ‘accidental’ fondle, which I laughed off. I couldn’t afford to insult him, not when there was so much at stake. When he realised just how much I wanted the information about his contacts in Belfast, he changed tactics. He must have decided that I wasn’t going to endanger his arrangement with them, and that he could use the situation to his advantage.
“Well you haven’t told me that in at least three days.” Sherlock said, with a sniff.
“She’s well shut of him.” John said firmly. “He tried to take a kitchen knife to Murdy earlier.”
[Hmm… Sierra Leone, judging by the faint traces of dust on the cuffs of his trousers. Unusually rumpled, despite the long journey. No jacket or tie, a couple of his waistcoat buttons undone and his cuffs unfastened, no links. Hair almost, but not quite as meticulously slicked back as usual. Faint reddening along his jawline OH GOD! NO!]
They looked at each other meaningfully. Sherlock raised an eyebrow as he stared down at John. “Honestly, John! Need I remind you that over the space of the last five years, you’ve been kidnapped several times, drugged, shoved in a bonfire, held at gunpoint, framed for vandalism and on one notable occasion nearly impaled by a ridiculous Chinese crossbow.”
John was aching by the end of that sentence. He couldn’t stop the involuntary buck of his hips as he stroked himself, gripping Sherlock’s thigh and cursing quietly; the water slapped the side of the bath loudly. He was torn between watching the action of Sherlock’s wrist under the water and the hazy feverish look in his eyes.
“I must say, I do think that it was unfair.” Hilary said, looking down at the hem of her dress, which she was still worrying between her fingers. When she looked up again, her large round eyes were brimming with tears. “Really so unfair... that it was me who had to push her down. If only Phyllis or poor Violet could have been the one to do it. But no, it was me. I was always the one who helped her into the pose. She wouldn’t do it otherwise. Get into the correct position.” She sniffed and blinked rapidly. Sherlock was not forthcoming with a handkerchief, however.
Anthea’s eyes flickered to Sherlock’s face and then back to John.
“Mm. Not just yet. We’ll stay for dinner, and I have no doubt that my wretched brother will impose himself on us before long. I’ll try and negotiate with him about the information he holds about Violet. I’ll promise to do ten dull government cases or something like that.”
Anthea glanced down at her phone reflexively, her mouth hardening a fraction. “It’s taking longer than I would like. The weather conditions are making it difficult to get accurate satellite imagery. Roadblocks are being assembled as we speak, on all the major roads towards Invergordon. Some of my colleagues will be arriving at the airfield there within ten minutes.” she gave him a flicker of a smile that he supposed was meant to reassure him. “Doctor Watson, there is no way that the younger Mr. Holmes will be taken out of the country.”
for assault? I hit him in the right sort of place that won’t leave lasting damage, but I doubt that’ll matter.”
John stared up at him, trying to fathom what on earth was going through Mycroft’s mind. He gave up almost immediately but the momentary distraction helped to drag him back to the here and now. “Where’s the map? We’ve got to keep moving.”
“Not quite sure as yet. I have a feeling that there's something she’s not telling us about Freddie Garcia, though. Miss Jessop is an interesting customer. Not wealthy, but fiercely ambitious. She worked in retail for at least two years before meeting Basil. She must have thought all her Christmases had come at once, getting her hooks into an eligible chap like that. You can tell she’s trying her very hardest to be a fine lady, to be future Lady Montague material. Nobody actually crosses their legs like that, not any more. She’ll have got that off the telly. She’s working class Glaswegian, but I’m assuming she met Basil in St. Andrews, where he was studying previously. ”
“Christ. I am going to pretend that I didn’t hear that.”
John had never held hands with a man before, not counting that memorable night when he and Sherlock had fled from arrest, handcuffed together. It was different, having his hand engulfed in Sherlock’s large one, his long elegant fingers wrapped around John’s own. It felt strong, the fingertips a little rough from the strings of his violin. And it felt odd, because it felt like he was being taken care of; that he was being led. John Watson wasn’t used to having people take care of him, not really. He was always the one to take care of others. It felt sort of... Well. Nice. (He’d never admit it.)
know. Eulalie was the name of our au pair. My parents needed help at home when Mummy was away on lecture tours, and Father was on business trips. I didn’t go to boarding school until I was twelve, and they seemed to think I needed some kind of supervision. Absurd, really. But we had various au pairs over the years, but Eulalie was the last. I was ten, and Mycroft was seventeen. Most of the previous ones we had were French, but she was Scots, from the Borders. I suppose she was reasonably attractive, quite large with curly blonde hair and dark eyes. She was twenty when she came to work for us.
“Come… come here-“ he demands, the words coming out more weakly than he’d planned. Sherlock lets his cock slip from his reddened, wet lips after one last swipe of his tongue over the head. The sight of that sharp, soft mouth slipping over his aching flesh nearly makes John come on the spot; picturing his seed dripping from Sherlock’s lips.
“No. Not a word, as far as I can make out.” Violet sighed. “Hilary was the one who said that he’d told her he had been planning on heading for London after he left. The cheeky git apparently suggested that she come and visit him there, even after the incident in the studio.”
“Utterly disgusting, in fact.” Violet remarked conversationally, getting to her feet. “Come on, help me clear the plates and I’ll see if there’s any ice cream in the freezer.”
“Mmph. She does have a face like a smacked arse there, alright.” Violet agreed, peering at Felicia. “Admittedly, we had just pickpocketed her as well. That was just after Sherlock had decided to try dressing a bit less like a tramp. Scrubbed up well, didn’t he?”
“Thanks.” Murdy muttered, wriggling her bare toes on the stone floor.
. But,” he said, his eyes widening as if struck by a sudden thought. “But I’d certainly never try and poison him over it.”
His first instinct was to argue, to tell Sherlock that he was overreacting. To say that he didn’t care if it hurt a bit, if it meant that he got to have Sherlock inside him. But then, he wasn’t going to see it that way, was he? John might have some romantic notion about the act of penetration, that it had some special significance of trust and love in a relationship. But it wasn’t as if Sherlock had ever known it that way. He hadn’t ever understood sex in that context. No wonder he was shying away from it, if all he associated with it was discomfort and possession.
“Um…” John widened his eyes meaningfully at Violet, who grinned a little shiftily back at him. “Look, it was entirely innocent but I suppose it might not have looked that way to someone watching from outside…”
“You feeling better, mate?” Greg asked, pushing a freshly poured mug of tea towards him. John seized it and downed half the contents in one gulp, sighing in satisfaction. “How’s Sherlock doing?”
Sherlock, who might be perplexed at why John had chosen to come
“Oh!” Violet gasped suddenly, sitting up straight in her chair and slapping her hand to her forehead. Her cigarette went flying, and narrowly missed the carelessly strewn hem of her dress.
“How’s your neck?” John asked, reaching out to pull Sherlock’s shirt collar aside. There were still one or two livid marks on the pale skin, but Sherlock batted him away.
Although John was tired and chilled from the long evening outside, he suspected that if he went to bed he was just letting himself in for a long night of staring at the ceiling. At first he headed towards the kitchen, with a vague idea of making tea; but at the threshold he stopped, hearing music coming from the end of the corridor.
“said Phyllis rapturously. “I honestly don’t know how you do it. You should open a cookery school as well as a painting school.”
“You must be aware, however, that I am not planning on continuing this habit of sleeping every night indefinitely.” Sherlock said firmly, waving an admonishing finger at John, as if he had been demanding otherwise.
Patrick’s hand had closed around a heavy silver candlestick on a nearby low table. He darted forwards, swinging it high above his head. His face was almost unrecognisable, furious, eyes narrowed as he threw himself towards the man carrying Sherlock.
Sherlock frowned, seeming a little confused. “That’s it. I wanted to see you.”
Sherlock’s face was deep in shadows, between the upturned wings of his coat collar. There was something a little joyful in his manner, in the slight bound of his gait as he walked shoulder to shoulder with John.
Mackie studied Sherlock’s hands keenly. “Very true, Mr. Holmes. I don’t think that you were a trawlerman for very long, though. Not enough scars on those paws, I reckon.”
into anything, John.”
“As you know… I ordinarily would cheerfully tell him to go to hell and do what I like.” Sherlock said eventually, evidently wanting to make this point crystal clear. “But this… it’s just too much of a risk. He would do it, you know. He would give them a map and hold their coats if it meant that Violet would be out of my life again.” He began worrying at a nearby trailing vine with his long pale fingers. “It’s no use, you see. He always hated her. Always believed that she was a
Ambling through a set of stately double doors on the ground floor, he found himself in the conservatory. It was a beautiful place, particularly after the gloom of the rest of the house. White-painted wrought iron arches held up a vaulted glass roof and a narrow walkway some twenty feet above him. The conservatory was long and narrow, filled with tall fruit trees and exotic looking shrubs. The floor was vented iron, and here and there steam drifted idly from an elderly heating system beneath his feet. The air was hot, damp and still. There was a heavy, hushed feel to the place as John wandered through the lush greenery, taking in the complex metalwork and occasional dainty wrought iron pieces of furniture. Around halfway down the room he found a small ornamental pond. It contained a few huge koi carp, which circled languidly in the smooth water.
He’d never found out what happened to them. He’d made himself file them away, along with the case. First of all though, he’d ensured that there was ample evidence to send down not just Jacob Trenet but several of his cohorts for smuggling heroin and human trafficking offences. The son of the woman in the café spent six months in prison on a minor charge, and on his release emigrated to Australia to work on a sheep farm.
“Um.” Violet cleared her throat noisily, and delved in her pocket for her cigarette case. “Well. Gosh.”
Armenia. Here was a relation of Jacob Trenet, in the company of a practically pubescent Armenian mobster and an older, obviously more experienced henchman.
sure that you understand.”
[I know for a fact that you smoked as a teenager, John.]
And with that he had tugged impatiently at John’s sleeve and swept from the scene, not letting go of the fabric until they were both beyond the yellow tape. Lestrade had begun to protest, but it was clear that his heart wasn’t in it. Sally gave Sherlock her customary death-stare, but managed to restrain herself from commenting. Since Sherlock had resumed casework with NSY, Sally had refrained from calling him names, even when he pensively licked evidence in front of her or carelessly harangued witnesses. John couldn’t make up his mind whether this was because she had finally been warned sternly enough about it, or whether she felt some kind of residual guilt over the circumstances of his fall from grace. Either way, it made their professional life much more pleasant. John had snapped at her more than once previously for calling Sherlock a freak, but it somehow felt different to defend him now that they were…
She cleared her throat and smiled charmingly at him when he looked up, startled. “Inspector, we’ve all had a trying day. Since there is evidently no murderer on the loose, I’m assuming that we don’t need to stick around. Feel free to stay for dessert, and don’t forget to take Mr. Marmaduke with you when you leave.”
Sherlock snorted. “Hardly. Do you really think that the Aberdeen constabulary will make proper use of it? They clearly haven’t made any headway with the case so far; it’s the holidays and it appears that they are in no hurry to bring the matter to a close.”
“Oh, wee Pruny and Rab aren’t that bad…” Violet grinned, stretching out on the sofa comfortably. “Alright, somewhat devious and occasionally downright felonious. But rather good fun, nonetheless…”
Violet sighed a little and crawled ungracefully down to his end of the boat. She plopped down next to him on his pile of blankets and cushions, leaning against his shoulder. She plucked the joint from between his unresisting fingers and ground it out in the ashtray.
doesn’t know what to do.) “I promise you, I’d be able to tell. Nobody mentioned a word to us in the village about a missing child, and we spoke to several people on our way here. There has been a mistake.”
“Obviously.” Sherlock muttered. “It’s the only truly clear line of vision from that spot. I doubt it has ever occurred to the Antonelli’s that someone with binoculars or a telescope could get a good look through the upstairs bedroom windows from that particular point across the square. It’s too far away for the naked eye to worry about. The slope of the ground means that the surrounding houses don’t overlook the upstairs windows. And besides, the majority of the buildings nearby are single storey. No one else can see inside. No one, except Mr. Jameson.”
“…good?”
“Oh?”
Violet swung open one of the heavy double doors, and shivered in the ensuing blast of icy air and fluttering snowflakes. She gave a shout of surprised laughter, and stood to one side to permit whomever it was. “Blimey, it’s you! Get inside, you poor thing!”
“My darling.” he breathed in Sherlock’s ear, smoothing the tangled hair from his face. “Stunning, incredible man.”
“Mr. Mackie-?” came a familiar, sonorous voice from the churchyard and a second or two later the Reverend Duncan appeared around the door looking agitated.
“I’m assuming you are Captain Watson. I’d appreciate it if you could leave us to our work, sir.”
Sherlock sighed and nodded, reaching for John’s hand and holding it tightly. “If I were to be melodramatic about it, I suppose I’d call it some kind of exorcism. But I am obviously not melodramatic, and exorcisms are a ludicrous concept.” he added, firmly.
“Margaret Gothford. I’m the housekeeper here.”
“Jesus!” John flung the door open and dropped to his knees next to Patrick; hands flying out to the dark patch that was spreading sickeningly along the side of his thin grey sweater. Patrick’s face was contorted with pain, fading to an ashy pallor. John cautiously pulled at the hem of his sweater and then at his shirt, inhaling sharply at the small deep wound beneath his ribs. He clamped one palm down over the welling blood at once, his other hand reaching out blindly to search for something to staunch the flow. “Patrick, mate. Can you talk to me?”
“Oh, adequate.” Anthea replied, with the faintest glimmer of a smile. “Do lead on.”
“I can imagine not.” Sherlock murmured, as they arrived at the studio. It was a long, low structure of sandstone with wide shuttered windows. There was evidence of much trampling on the lawn and around the perimeter of the studio, which Sherlock huffed at disapprovingly. “I suppose all this mess was created afterwards?”
A text message beeped through on his phone, buzzing against his desk, and he moved toward it, casting a troubled glance down at Sherlock as he passed, grey eyes carefully averted from his. Swiping across the screen, he opened the message, smiling faintly in spite of the lingering wriggling in his stomach.
John’s interview had started 43 minutes ago, plenty of time for Sherlock to go to the Yard, pick up the cold cases Lestrade had mentioned, and stop to grab a couple takeaway cups from John’s favorite hot chocolate spot—not that he would admit to being a connoisseur of such a thing—before returning to wait at Bart’s. Of course, that wasn’t what he
“Can we not use the term ‘fancy’?” he murmured with a wince.
Sherlock choked over a laugh, his throat so unaccustomed to making the sound, and had to cough into his hand a moment before crossing his arms and turning back out to the lake, his expression stoic once again. “Still,” he muttered, watching the swans making their way toward an island further out in the lake, and Mycroft sighed, moving to stand at his shoulder.
“-in the very serious matter of Sherlock’s repressed emotions.”
Sherlock shrugged, fiddling with the knot of his royal blue tie, a recent reversion back to proper uniform that they were both pretending hadn’t started after John had mentioned the color making his eyes look bluer. “Try and finish the Pickett case,” he replied, the first file they’d plucked from the box Lestrade had sent over yesterday. “Have to do a bit more research on the solubility of arsenic at various temperatures.”
!” Mrs. Watson countered fiercely.
Lestrade was, of course,
“Then…why do you look like you’re about to be sick?”
“Oh,” he said, eyes flicking down to the paper still caught in his hand. Mystery solved.
Sherlock’s eyes opened, and he sat up, legs kicking in the air as they dislocated themselves from the sofa, coming to rest on the floor as the detective bounced to his feet.
“You could still go,” he encouraged. “I’ll be fine tucking myself in,” he added, hoping the jest would lend credence to his spurring.
to leave, but- Well, if it- If you- If you want me to go, I-”
“Hamish!?”
John was panting slightly as he drew level with the cab, the surprised curiosity not yet drained from Sherlock’s face. He stopped, waiting for Sherlock to get in, but the boy just continued staring down at him, his head tilting as his eyebrows furrowed. “Alright, then,” John mumbled, slipping inside first and bouncing across the seat.
John left him to it, looking back down at the page in his hand, reading over the sentence he knew would soon and forever be attributed to memory. “I got an interview,” he whispered, still unable to entirely believe it, because this was
“My what?” John asked, casting a sidelong frown at the man as they turned onto the main street.
“Who are you leaning toward?”
Sherlock curled away from the words like a blow, his fingers tightening around the width of the door. Without a word, he slowly pushed it closed, the click of the latch the only sound a moment before he heard John’s hitched breath, and then moved away, stepping silently over the hardwood floors toward his bed.
? I thought you said you talked to him!”
John leaned forward, casting Sherlock an apologetic glance as he reached past to hand the bartender his card, a waft of cedar and orange drifting up from his neck. “Just keep it open,” he said, the bartender tapping the card once against the bar with a nod before turning to Sherlock.
“Get off the damn phone!”
“What do you think you’re going to find, Sherlock?” he asked softly, and Sherlock turned away, his shoulder a barrier between them as he focused steadily down at the black logo of St. Bartholomew’s. “You already know who did it. You already know why. What good could possibly come from knowing the particulars?”
“Thank you, Mr. Hooper,” he replied with an unseen nod, his voice more stable, but also more brittle. “I-I appreciate you taking my call.”
“No,” Sherlock replied, swapping out the current slide, his eyes never lifting from the lens.
“Oh, give it a rest, Seb; there’s no way she fancies you.”
“Who keeps flammable liquids in teacups!?”
“What are you
The paper was the same—thin, bargain brand, the blue faded halfway down.
Sherlock sniffed, turning to walk across the room, bending back around the edge of his desk to snatch the book up. There was a dent in the paperback cover he was sure Mr. Tyson wouldn’t appreciate, but it had been his own copy, so there wasn’t much the man could do about it. Feeling a little spitefully delighted by that fact, he tossed the book onto his bed, moving back to the wardrobe as he began shuffling out of his coat. He stretched his arm out, shaking off a bit of snow as he wriggled out of the sleeve, and then bumped something on his dresser, a rogue elbow bending back too far. He turned, watching as his skull toppled down off the surface toward his bed, but he was too late to catch it, the bone landing on the duvet with a soft thump, and then, suddenly, Sherlock froze.
“What are you-”
Blinking his eyes away with a rough swallow, he closed the door behind him with a sharp click, determined, at the very least, that, if anyone were going to kill Sherlock Holmes, it would be him.
Reading through the edit, he nodded at the screen and hit send, content his response conveyed very little of the giant mutant butterflies playing a drum solo on his ribs.
for the A-levels, I haven’t
John chuckled, following after her as the woman continued her way down the corridor. “Nope, just endangered,” he replied, and Irene laughed, holding open a door for him before leading up the stairs.
“Sherlock.”
“A dog,” he said, and John stilled, head straining back on his neck to raise a skeptical eyebrow down at him.
“What!?” John spat right back, and they were frozen there for a moment, staring at one another in an offended tableau before laughter broke the scene.
Waffle scraped down Sherlock’s throat as he swallowed. “Female-centered?”
“Yeah,” Sherlock assured, John making an affirmative sort of grunt before his steps retreated, and Sherlock flipped his head upside-down, scrubbing the towel through his hair.
“I’m tempted to say you should try it,” he remarked, looking up to the final few moments of the movie that had somehow snuck up on them, “if only to add company to my misery.”
Sherlock dropped his chin, nails grating against the bark as his hand clenched.
Greg laughed, leaning forward to look around Sherlock at a stop sign before turning onto a road that climbed up into the trees covering the base of the mountain in front of them. “I’ll take it. Something tells me you’re not one to give praise lightly.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock hummed, lifting his face from his file to blink across at the man, who glowered at him.
“Molly?”
as they rolled too quickly over the gutter, John holding on for dear life as the car turned out onto the street, moving swiftly away from the school. A few moments later, he started to creep up to sitting, the car no longer seeming to be speeding and no one yelling at him anymore, but a loud sound behind them caused him to bolt upright, spinning around to look frantically out the rear window.
“Wonderful.”
“At the queen’s request. So you can be across from the prince.” He waved a hand to the seat beside him, and Sherlock nodded, in something of a daze as he lowered himself into place, staring down at the light bouncing through the crystal glasses to scatter splotches of rainbows across the delicate creme tablecloth.
He was equally silent when, a few seconds later, he felt a faint pressure on his shoulder, and held his breath, the movie blurring in front of him as Sherlock slowly rested his head against the grey wool of his jumper, setting a New Year’s Eve fireworks display loose in his torso. A voice warbled up to his ear, unintelligible through the haze, and he quickly swallowed, clearing his mind as he tilted his head down toward Sherlock’s. “Hmm?” he hummed, and Sherlock shook against him with a soft chuckle.
Perfect wasn’t the right word. Perfect was for when you finally got a picture to hang straight or achieved the right balance of salt in a soup, not for this, not for Sherlock’s small gasp that hissed past John’s lips in a break of contact; for the way he hesitantly, almost painful with care, began to respond under John’s mouth, clearly every kind of new at this; for the way his fingers shook against John’s sternum when he clutched back at the grey jumper; for the soft almost-whimper that vibrated between their chapped lips when John twisted his mouth just slightly, closing entirely over Sherlock’s lips as his fingers clenched tighter into satin curls.
“Okay, grab a green one,” he muttered, because there was no way he was getting one of those horrid orange things, and he couldn’t very well let John down when he looked so delighted at the prospect of larceny.
“Okay, but why?” John pressed, lowering his voice as the rustling of backpacks and pages began to die down.
“It’s his first year at Queen Mary too,” Irene added, gesturing to Molly, who tilted her head, clearly intrigued.
“Whipping a member of the royal family?” Sherlock mocked, but Irene didn’t reply, lifting a brow and regarding him coolly until he grew unnerved, flashing John a speculative glance.
Sherlock turned over his shoulder, finding a woman in her mid-thirties holding a tray of fizzing flutes, tired green eyes atop her customer service smile. He downed the little left in his glass, placing it on the far side of the tray with the other empties before plucking a fresh one by the stem, bobbing it toward her. “Thank you,” he said, taking a short sip as she nodded. “Now, if you could just follow me around for the rest of the evening...” He trailed off as the woman chuckled, smiling around the rim of his champagne.
“Semantics,” Molly concluded, flicking a regal hand in the air, and John rolled his eyes, glancing back at Sherlock to find the man only just recovering from his shock, blinking rapidly down at the floor as a swallow bobbed down his long neck. “Now, what would you like to drink?” she asked, looking back to Irene. “John can bring it over to us while we catch up.”
“I- Well, I thought- I heard you talking,” he stammered, glancing up through a veil of pale lashes.
“Nothing,” John responded, slow and soothing, like talking down a startled pet. “We’re about twenty minutes out. Coach Powles was just about to make an announcement.” He nodded toward the front of the coach, and Sherlock turned, still moving much slower than his mind commanded.
“You don’t have to,” John assured, shaking his head, but Sherlock waved a hand, lifting his arm out toward the street to hail a cab he somehow knew had just rounded the corner behind him.
“Known what?”
“Well aren’t you just a special little snowflake.”
“You want to be me?” Sherlock snarled as John entered the room, wrestling a jacket off the back of John’s chair and furiously tugging it up his arms. “Fine! Then I’ll just be you.” He tugged at the front of John’s rugby jacket, settling it on his shoulders. “Oh, look at that kitten, isn’t it cute?” Sherlock began, voice gratingly high as he folded his hands under his chin. “I just love kittens and puppies and children and skipping through fields of flowers in ignorant bliss!” He stopped, shifting back to perhaps the fiercest glare John had ever seen on him.
When John was in secondary school, he’d had a teacher, Mrs. Powles, who could take one look at you and instantly dismiss whatever brilliant story you’d spent the whole day concocting for why your homework wasn’t done, you’d come bursting in late two minutes after the bell, or you wanted to go to the nurse’s office.
John chuckled, looking back to the detective, who did, at least, seem not
Sherlock muttered something unintelligible, but it sounded accepting, so John stood up, ducking back out into the corridor.
Chancing a glance out of the corner of his eye, he watched John grate open the drawer, paper shuffling as his hand delved inside, and then there was a shift of wood, and he froze, Sherlock flinching his gaze away again. He heard the faint sound of glass thunking against the side, and then a rustle of paper again, followed by the shift of John’s jeans as his legs moved back into Sherlock’s downturned vision.
“No,” the man replied, smiling outright now as he shook his head. “Sherlock Holmes, by the way,” he added, unwinding one hand to wave it at his chest.
, of all impossible things, and it was a long moment before Sherlock could do anything but gape at the side of his face, watching the thoughtful wrinkles crease around his eyes as John skimmed over his haphazard notes.
Mike turned to the window, the curl of his lips visible to Sherlock alone. “Very good, sir,” he echoed, and John rolled his eyes with a fond shake of his head.
of theatre kids yelled at you-”
“No,” John answered, looking back toward the foot of the steps as he shook his head, hoping the woman wouldn’t notice the sheen over his eyes. “Lyle. I’m confined to quarters.”
John leaned back, eyes scanning over him. “I didn’t give you a poem,” he said warily. “I gave you that book. On Tuesday.”
“Close,” he replied, lifting his eyes from the experiment. “Vegan café.”
John’s mouth dropped, already anxious stomach rippling with renewed panic. “I- None,” he croaked, and a corner of Sherlock’s mouth twitched in a smirk.
He probably could have gone on like that, alternating between Drumsticks and Smarties until they went to bed regretting all of it, but his mobile chirped at half-seven, signaling a shift in the festivities.
“Who,” he clarified, bobbing his phone in gesture, and Irene’s brow furrowed only a moment before she nodded in understanding.
John turned, smiling up at the man with more malice than mirth. “Keep it up and you won’t have to imagine,” he clipped, and Greg laughed, throwing his head back to the clouds as he released John from his grip.
“My parents,” Sherlock replied, voice muffled as the heat of his breath was reflected back by the paper shield.
“Morning,” he murmured, and Sherlock sighed, a hand lazily lifting to card through John’s hair.
A patient sigh whispered through the room. “Let me rephrase,” John muttered, taking a couple steps back to stand at Sherlock’s side. “I am going to bring you back something regardless, so you might as well tell me what you’d prefer.”
Sherlock smiled, shaking his head over the mouth of his coffee mug as he hovered it below his chin. “Because tomorrow isn’t our anniversary.”
“Oh, please, Sherlock, nothing so sinister as
!” Sherlock urged, waving a hand out at the spectacle. “All the flowers and proposals! And what is going on with that piano, honestly? Unless someone’s going to put on a mask and drop a chandelier, that has no business being here.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Any time, I suppose. I finished my experiment last night, and the fingers should keep in the freezer for next time.”
“There’s nothing interesting there, of course; you saw the photos,” Sherlock said, stowing his phone back in his pocket and looking up, “but you don’t have to come in if you’re…uncomfortable.” He grimaced slightly as he said it, as if the prospect that someone might not want to tour a murder site was appallingly beneath him.
John’s blond head poked over the wall, looking bewildered. Bewilderment quickly shifted to curiosity, however, and then, upon a brief glance across the table at Molly, a whole myriad of emotions tumbled across his face. Confusion, anger, frustration, and, most surprisingly, hurt.
, and, if I don’t figure it out in time-”
Sherlock huffed a faint chuckle, shaking his head softly as he looked down at his friend, and then closed his own eyes, leaning back against the headrest. They still had over an hour before they reached Sheffield; he could afford to get a bit of sleep.
“Oh, of course, of course,” she chirped, flitting her hands through the air as she backed toward her flat. “You boys go on up and get settled. I’ll bring a tray up in a bit. Don’t go getting used to it, though,” she warned, pointed index finger furthering the point. “I’m really not your housekeeper.” She smiled over her shoulder as she pushed through her door, and the silence was suddenly awkward in her wake.
“Great!” she chirped, unfolding her legs. “Well, I should go. I’m supposed to help Molly with her chemistry.”
“I think I would know if I was-”
“Kiss
Sherlock smiled, though unsure he could see it, so he added a nod before replying. “Goodnight, Your Highness,” he murmured, passing through the door and pulling his mobile out again to guide him back to his room.
around it,” Irene snipped, and John smiled, chuckling faintly as he leaned his hip against the counter. “But yeah. Surprisingly, Valentine’s Day isn’t all that big for cocktails.”
He had been unable to sleep more than an hour at a time last night, the clock beside his bed clicking loudly toward dawn, and still he found himself unable to focus, his mind constantly drifting back to his conversation with John the previous afternoon. If you could even call that a conversation, that is.
He could explain the impatient minutes spent staring at his phone, desperate for Sherlock’s response mere seconds after his own. The man was always getting into trouble, after all. He could understand the way his mind always supplemented whatever conversation he was having with things Sherlock had said, or sometimes just things John suspected he would say. They did spend a lot of time together, being roommates. He could justify his anger toward Sherlock over the café-incident-he-was-trying-to-block-out, because he was right about it being cruel to Molly.
, and we'll sort that out!
Sherlock shook his head, his hands pressed together beneath his face as he stared intently over the documents.
“Oh,” John replied, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Well, I don’t know, really. Lots of things, I suppose.”
“Well, so long as you’re offering...” he mused, but John was already through the door, leaving Sherlock holding it for no one as he brushed past and started quickly up the stairs.
Sherlock slammed into the dorm, startling John where he sat his desk, the blond spinning around in his chair.
Sherlock scoffed, shaking his head and drawing in another sip. “Easy for you to say,” he grumbled. “You don’t have Emily wanting to ‘grab lunch’ every time she’s in town.”
The queen smiled, passing him and looking across the table at the rest of them. “Gregory,” she greeted with a nod, rounding the head of the table and her chair to pause in front of Sherlock. “Mr. Holmes,” she greeted, inclining her head to his short bow. “Thank you so much for your agreeing to help us through this…particular frustration.”
Mixed messages, his arse. Holmes was sending encrypted code in ten different languages. In the mornings, he’d have John’s coat and shoes ready. There was that one time he dropped off tea at John’s desk in the library. Apparently he was “dropping by to say hello”, what kind of sane person does that?
“Yeah?” John smiled, “Mind passing me an apple while you’re at it?”
Rowers cannot see where they are going since they face backwards. The only person in the boat who is facing forwards is the cox. We’re meant to steer the boat correctly and not hit buoys or row over logs. And keep in mind that there also happens to be a six-foot stroke blocking our view.
If a rowing coach asks you what the most important seat in the boat is, don’t answer. It’s a trick question. You might say stroke, because they lead the boat or six seat, because they’re the tallest. No. That is a rookie mistake. But if you decide to answer because you’re a rebel, the coxswain will always be the most important person in the boat. No matter what, it is always, and forever will be, the coxswain.
“What do you want Bill?” John rummaged around his exercise bag for an outfit that wouldn’t get him laughed out of the club. Sweats, check. Long sleeve, check. Pants, pants, where were his pants. The red ones sat at the bottom of his bag. He sighed deeply and tugged them on.
“Moriarty makes me want to jump out of the boat.” John growled.
“I’m fine!” John snapped, “I’m going to change.” John gathered up his things and stalked over to his workout bag. A string of obscenities played over and over in his mind. Sherlock fucking Holmes. With his gorgeous hair, and perfect skin, and back muscles. What a prick.
“McMahon was a good for nothing slacker who sat around waiting for his paychecks.” Bill remarked, “And Adler is hot as fuck.”
“No, that’s alright. I’ll be back in an hour. If not, something interesting happened.” Sherlock’s eyes lit up with the last sentence.
“Doubtful.” Holmes interjected.
John thought about his situation long and hard. Worst case scenario, his landlord called the cops and John got a criminal record. John doubted it would get to that. Best case scenario, his incessant guilt tripping would work for once in his life. It was time to figure out who was the most desperate bastard on the team, someone who couldn’t keep paying monthly rents. But who?
“I’m a PG Tips man myself, but I’ll manage.” John eyed the cupboard. He wasn’t going to get to that tea easily. Picking up a nearby stool, he scooted it closer to the cupboard. God, the tea would have to move to a lower cupboard.
I will be putting terminology and other explanations at the end of every chapter to help everyone along. This is mainly because of the fact that this was supposed to be short and sweet but spiralled into three long pages and lots of tears.
“John, you must know how very excited I am to be working with you. Club President, however did you manage it?” Moriarty said. John smiled tightly, resisting the temptation to repeat Moriarty’s question in an equally mocking tone.
“So you did hear about the condoms.” John deadpanned.
Her name is Mary. She makes him forget.
“You know I row both sides but prefer port. You know I placed second at World’s, but refused to believe the rumors about my loose rigger bolt. Which were true, to some extent. You can recall my height, how much I weigh, and my shoe size, probably off the top of your head. I’m surprised you didn’t scour the internet for low quality videos of me rowing at my old secondary school. Yes, they do exist. I’m quite impressed at the your research and I’m not sure if the socially acceptable reaction is to be repulsed or to be pleased.”
“Right.” John nodded, “Good.” He exhaled, had he been holding his breath the whole time?
He feels empty. Sometimes he thinks about what it would be like to go back, to Sherlock Holmes and to Baker Street. He'll hear a cry from the nursery and change his mind.
“Sorry.” John said, “Stayed up late trying to figure out why my organic chemistry homework wouldn’t balance. Speaking of, I must look a right mess.” He looked down at his clothes.
“Right. Sorry! Ok. I’ll do that.” John hurried off, silently cursing the boys who began to snicker behind him.
Sometimes bonds become hard to sustain. In earlier times, out of tune bonds were common, especially during adolescence. It was so simple to fall in sync with someone you spent quite a lot of time with. Modern scientists began toying with the idea of questioning the bonds and humanity’s susceptibility to fall into them, and soon a cure-all began to be administered to children. It was a horribly bitter pill, hard to swallow with an ashy aftertaste that never went away.
The smart thing to do was to go to a conductor, an expert on bonding and its relationship with someone’s fate. But people hardly ever do the smart thing.
“I’m not finished, Hugh.” Callaghan answered.
“No!” John said indignantly, throwing the sock that he had been putting on at Bill, who dodged it expertly.
He couldn’t believe it. John had managed to get himself kicked out of his flat. He’d done worse, John thought. He dated Mary Morstan, for god’s sake. No, this was a walk in the park compared to that. One week and three days anniversaries were worse than this. Mary Morstan puking in his closet was worse than this. It’s not as if he wasn’t considering moving out and he knew that at least half of the other tenants would be ecstatic.
When she is all grown up, she decides to visit her mother's grave, alone. It does not affect her like she had hoped it would.
“Look. I don’t know much about you but-” John began.
He took the room in. It was furnished quite nicely, with rowing memorabilia littering the walls. Oars lined the top half of the walls, creating a mismatched border along the ceiling. Pictures of past crews smiled at them from the fireplace mantle.
. Christ.” John stopped himself,
The bus back to campus was always charged with testosterone and that day wasn’t any different. Bill and Kav had taken it upon themselves to blast the Hits of the 90’s radio, as if they didn’t get enough of that from Lestrade’s idea of a workout playlist.
“Nevermind. So, tell me, Eton or Harrow?” John set out two cups.
His mother was able to find a steady job working as a secretary for a local GP. Harry found both acceptance and a calling, she worked as a volunteer for LLGS. John got himself an internship at Bart’s and left to fight for queen and country. And in the end, everything turned out alright.
Concept 2 - the premier erg brand
“You’ve really got it in for this guy.” Bill mused, “Is his couch the one you’ll be sleeping on tonight?” Bill was always up for some innuendo. He was a tamer version of Kav, willing to keep mum about your sexual endeavors while simultaneously being a first class dick about it.
“We’re not together, right Holmes?” John said.
“Your mother.” Mike said.
Mike Stamford is a starboard. He’s tall and relentlessly slim, which he swears is going to change once his father’s genes kick in. Mike had rowed in the Blue boat last year and vowed to come back stronger and better than before. John had been on the receiving end of endless prattling about America and the rowers there and the program directors. John knew Mike was good and he was quite talented at moving the boat.
The Boat Race course is a four mile course, starting at Putney to Mortlake. The start and the finish are marked by the Boat Race Stones. The clubs’ presidents toss the 1879 sovereign to decide which station to take. Their decision is largely based on the weather that day. There are two stations, Middlesex and Surrey. Middlesex holds the advantage of the first and last bends while Surrey holds the longer middle bend. Both coxswains will compete for the fastest current, which lies in the deepest part of the river.
“Shut up.” John rolled his eyes, “Dickhead.”
As a coxswain, he had a tendency to layer up whenever he put in early mornings at Goldie. Navy sweatpants, a long sleeve older than his mum, a red bobble hat, and fucking adidas slides was a surefire way to bring all the boys to the yard. Christ, John what were you thinking? he scolded himself silently.
“So.” John cleared his throat, “You taking the bus?”
“I rather think it’s easier to make sense of.” Holmes said.
“John Watson!”.
John stuck a hand out into the bus aisle. Holmes took it with no hesitation. Then they sat in silence. The bus was not as cramped as it usually was and that dodgy bloke who wanted in on Kav’s couch had gotten off at the latest stop. It was comfortable, familiar even.
They name the baby after one of Mary’s relatives. John feels fulfilled for the first time in years.
John gulped. Anything meant a lot of things. Oh god, that face. Maybe if he just- better not. He stood up abruptly, letting Holmes’ legs fall to the floor. As expected, Holmes was not flustered or even vaguely put off. John looked at Holmes, who still looked like he just stepped off the front page of GQ. Not that he read GQ. Or had a subscription.
