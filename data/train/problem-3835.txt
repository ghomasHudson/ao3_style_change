There was Dean, leaning upright against the passenger’s door, eyes closed and lips slightly parted. Castiel would’ve thought he was knocked out if not for the lack of colour, the fact he had a large puncture wound in his abdomen, but that wasn’t what got Castiel.
Dean gives him a slightly pained smile and squeezes Sam's arm a bit tighter with the most of his last energy. "You can do this, Sam. You're strong, you're a hell of a lot stronger than I've ever been. That's why I know you can do this. Okay?" Dean's face turns serious, but his eyes remain gentle "You can do this." He repeats.
”What about fucking me? Because I’m fairly certain I’m the top in this relationship,” a voice chimes from the door and Dean whips his head around so fast, it takes his eyes a moment to catch up.
Despite the negative thoughts and the bothersome idea of that happening, Dean kisses back gently, his bottom lip still quivering from his tears. Castiel hushes him gently and kisses him a bit more deeply, as if reassuring Dean that he's there. That he's
”Dean,” He hears a whisper through the rest of the mostly silent room.
Castiel looks over at him. "Perhaps we can become friends while treatments are going on." He suggests, almost shy about it.
“Now- you said garage—“
He wanted to scream.
"I should go, signing off." Castiel murmurs at the camera before the video ends again and Dean finds himself a little happier with a little extra energy to get out of bed.
As if summoning him, he gets a text message from him. Dean wasn’t sure if his memory was horrible or not because he couldn’t remember giving him his number.
Dean didn't know if it was pity of being in such a happy space with memories that can't really be the same or if she was actually doing her job, but either way he didn't mind. "Uh-yeah, maybe a change will be good for me... Give me a few minutes to get my things together?" He asks.
Dean smiles softly. “I close my eyes and think of what could happen the next day. Like maybe tomorrow I’ll wake up and have Doctor Sexy on my tv screen. And a big ass slice of apple pie-“ he says and makes a fake moan sound that makes Castiel chuckle from his bed.
”I know, Billie,” he replies, solemn.
Dean took a shaky breath as he looked up at Sam, gripping his forearm and looking into his little brother's tearful eyes. His own eyes were filled with tears as he gives a watery smile. "I'm okay, Sammy," he assures through a soft wheeze, feeling his brother's grip on his shoulder and side tighten to keep him upright. "I'm okay, this is a good ending for me."
They sit down, with pancakes filled with chocolate chips and covered in icing sugar. Well in Dean’s case anyway. Castiel’s pancakes had bananas and strawberries piled on top instead to balance out the food portions instead.
Dean nods, Cas’ surprises hadn’t let him down just yet. “Let’s do that-“ he replies, aollowing Castiel to lead him to a patch of sand and pulling a towel out of nowhere.
One that made everything go into hyper focus, slow motion, a spiral of confusion and despair, drop into him. “Billie,” Castiel says slowly, glancing around as he pulls his phone away from his ear.
"Yes, Cas," Dean says honestly, going to be very good for his top.
”I just want you to know that... Well, heaven is supposed to be everything yo ever wanted and ever needed. And heaven wasn’t gonna be heaven, well- without you. Because my heaven IS you,” he says, taking a soft breath “I just... I love you,” he says and watches as a serene smile rests along Cas’ lips, making him want to kiss them again and he does, because now he can.
His phone rings again and he was going to lose his mind if it was the hospital again.
Dean: Can’t be that good then.
When they get there, Castiel gives Dean a tour and it isn’t huge, but it’s cozy and it’s just Cas. Dean finds himself very keen on nuzzling with the bisexual coloured Pie plush that Cas bought him as they lay against each other on the couch. “Why do you find Doctor Sexy, sexy?” Castiel asks after they’ve started an episode.
Castiel is careful to prep Dean with his fingers, but smiles softly when Dean moans his name with need, but not just a sex need, a need like he wouldn't live without Castiel. Something that made Castiel want to never let him go out into the unforgiving world ever again. But Dean Winchester was too stubborn and independent to allow the angel to do that. So this worked, being with him, with nothing between them, seeing as Castiel had gotten rid of his layers and watched with pleasure as Dean's eyes darkened to a murky everest green.
”Shut up, jerk.”
”I get it. I’m sorry that I talked about it... I just wanted to make sure, you weren’t alone.” Sam coughs hard, the kind after you’ve cried hard enough that you lose your voice.
“Castiel, are you there?” The voice calls through and Castiel blinks hard, feeling his tears.
"Dean Winchester," A nurse says, holding a file as she stands at the beginning of a plain hallway, looking expectantly up at the waiting room, where Dean Winchester was in fact, sitting.
Dean starts to rumbling engine of Baby and presses down on the gas as he starts to drive. ‘Stairway To Heaven’ starts playing through the speakers and Dean smiles as he drives along the roads.
There was a new video. From yesterday.
Dean blinked, looking up at the sky. It was blue and it was bright and edged with mountains and trees green like they were painted with acrylic. He gasps softly, the air crisp but filling him with warmth. He turns his head to glance around the rest of his surroundings. "Heaven." He says lightly to himself as he spots a house with a white picket fence gating it in.
“I have a question, Cas,” he murmurs gently, leaning into every touch Cas would give him, and Castiel was giving him everything.
it, it stung, but it felt amazing.
The anxiety slips away fast as Castiel grabs Dean’s thigh, just above the knee, thumb stroking the denim. “I love you so fucking much too.” He says, voice serious, though his eyes soft when Dean’s gaze flickers over to him.
Dean smiles into the kiss with a happy sound, moving closer before feeling a tug at his oxygen tube. “Careful,” he says softly to Cas, moving to readjust it.
Dean blushes brightly, but says nothing because what he wanted to say was 'Don't leave', but he knew Castiel would be happier out of the hospital and in the actual world. Away from him.
"It was just a joke, dude. A reference almost."
Dean took a sip of his coffee as he held Cas’ hand across the counter in their kitchen. “I hope Sam is doing alright,” he says into his coffee cup.
Time to meet the boy's nurses and Gabriel.
”You’re already like, so much sexier than him.” Dean muses.
to keep his eyes focused on the damn road.
"Cas, shut up. I'm okay and this wasn't your fault... it just happens." He murmurs out, squeezing his hand gently but there was a firmness behind it.
After a few moments, Dean nods as he watches the very patient male above him slowly starting to move his hips enough to create enough of a sensation to pull out a soft moan from both of them.
Dean watches as a very soft smile grows on Castiel’s lips. “I just think you’re gorgeous.” He murmurs to Dean; Dean feels a flush go through his cheeks.
By the time they had finished playing 21 questions, they had asked more than 21 questions, but now knew a solid amount of information about each other.
”So if I wore cowboy boots, would I be sexier than him?” Castiel questions, making Dean giggle and peck his lips.
Dean checks to make sure. Nope, just him and Sam. “Her name is Eileen,” he says softly. “She’s deaf, but I’ve been learning ASL to talk to her and she’s really good at reading lips. And really funny, I think you’d like her!” Sam says excitedly, rambling.
He was blinking rapidly now, eyes watering from how hard he was staring, he probably forgot to blink; maybe his emotions were getting to him as well. He swallows thickly, squeezing his eyes tight now. "Gotta get a drink," He mutters to himself, pushing off the counter and walking out of the bathroom to head towards the kitchen. He wasn't worried about Sam giving him a lecture about how alcohol is a stupid choice at 11 in the morning; it's five'o'clock somewhere.
Sam chuckles, but it ends as a pained sound. “Me too.” He whispers, before huffing through the phone, like he was trying to manage himself.
That wherever he was.
The doctor ended up showing up after
“I love you too, Cas,” Dean whispers gently and watched as Castiel’s own eyes water just a bit and a wide smile takes its place upon his face.
”Have you been enjoying your home movie productions?” Castiel asks and motions towards the camera on the bedside.
I hope you enjoyed the mess that was this book.
Castiel smiles and kisses Dean's lips again before placing him on the couch and running a hand through his hair, taking in the soft sound that escapes the oldest Winchester's lips, before he relaxes into the couch and passes out.
Dean sinks into his bedding, exhausted. He hadn’t been eating much and his sleep was practically non-existent. He took it as nerves from everything that had happened with Castiel over such a short period of time. He didn’t want to mention why he was so quiet, it hurt. He didn’t know why it hurt. But the past few days have just been bad breathing days; he didn’t want to worry Castiel and the doctors were checking on him regularly as they could.
Castiel hands the towel to Dean first, who does his best to dry his feet off quickly and hand it back to Castiel, who does the same. Helping Dean up, Castiel brings them back towards the vehicle. “So the doctors and I agreed, that maybe some time away from your bare walls would be good for you.” He says casually, but it makes Dean stop in his tracks.
Sam tried to make Dean’s childhood the best he could. He taught him to catch and enjoy nature. He taught him the outlines of marvel and DC. The importance of school and learning. But he taught him the most about how there are many things that can put a person on a path, whether it’s good or bad, but it’s that individuals choice to let their fate be decided for them or if they’ll write their own story.
Dean thinks bitterly to himself, but was slightly sated by the fact Castiel had lightly pressed his mouth to Dean's.
He listens to the ringing for barely 3 seconds, before the person on the other line is answering.
Dean nods again. “Just, please, make...” he takes in a breath. “Make sure Castiel gets the note, okay? Please.” He breathes out, feeling very heavy despite no longer having an able body.
Dean glances up from where he’s resting his head against Cas’ chest. “I guess because he helps people and he has cowboy boots, also he doesn’t take shit.” He replies and Castiel nuzzles him gently as he speaks.
"I would tell you what I have, but I assume you heard over the phone and there's not much more to say about it." He says softly.
Dean notes the way his voice seems just as low and gravelly as now and the way he squints like he's staring directly into the sun instead of the lens. He was wearing a grey AC/DC shirt sunglasses rested on top of his head. He was gorgeous. Like a sun god or an angel more like it.
And everything is okay.
I feel the camcorder is going to be important to the story... We all know which fic I got that from (;
." Castiel practically giggles, something that makes Dean squeeze his eyes shut and imagine.
Dean blushes and looks up at him with wide eyes as he holds the video camera close to him. "Cas, thank you so much- and hey, don't forget about me out there." He says softly.
Dean smiles and it seemed like a good place to stop conversation before he got ahead of himself and tried to pry the answer out of Castiel. He was a bit exhausted anyway, some rest seemed like a good idea.
"Breathing has been an issue for over a year, been sore on and off for around the same time, and I just recently noticed how much skinny I look." He says, trying to use his memory.
He was so proud of his angel, he was amazed by how wholesome the male was. How his eyes seemed to glow with excitement whenever he finally understood or learned a new skill. Dean thought Castiel was perfect, everything about him.
(See the end of the chapter for
”Hey, Dean?” Cas’ soft loving voice drifts through his inner monologue to himself and Dean allows his eyes to drift up to meet the piercing blue ones.
"Cas, I think it's 'bout time we talked."
He takes a moment to look at how little belongings Dean has. Sure, he has weapons, a few lore books, but nothing is really 'Dean'. A few photos on the nightstand of Team Free Will makes Castiel smile, the empty and spilt bottles of liquor do not. He doesn't bring them up right now, that would be the opposite of what Castiel wants to do to help Dean. Instead, he looks at Dean, smiling. "Lay on your back on your bed, Dean." He demands softly, the green eyed male listens quickly.
”I’m sorry I didn’t come visit earlier, I thought I’d let you have time with your brother. Probably too early to meet him. Though you’ve met Gabriel and it’s always too early to meet him-“ Castiel was on a soft ramble that Dean couldn’t help but hold onto, just nodding along.
And the worst words of all.
"That's enough, Gabriel." Castiel huffs and Dean gives a soft sound of amusement towards their brotherly affections, reminded him of Sam and himself.
Dean mentally agreed. “You know what I do sometimes that helps me sleep?” He asks softly, taking in the role of the helper like what he often did with his little brother.
Dean was smiling as he ran his hands along the steering wheel of Baby. He glanced at Castiel in the passengers seat.
Dean sighs, it was one of the better days. His breathing was still crap, but he wasn’t as sore today. Perhaps it was the new medication he was put on. The nurses specifically told him it wasn’t going to heal him, but it would make the pain more tolerable. And it had. So Dean was grateful.
”Stop whining, bitch. I missed you, but seriously, what are you doing here?” He asks, frowning.
WARNING: Smut! Illness symptoms and effects. Some mention of anxiety.
Castiel says, keeping a cautious tone, but still loving and concerned.
The hospital.
Dean shrugs gently with a small smile. “Still kicking,” he says.
Castiel reads over the scribbled and messy handwriting of his boyfriend. He started to sniffle throughout the middle of reading it, but made no other sounds. Eventually, he finished reading it, folded it up and turned to Billie. “Tell me he’s in heaven,” he begs.
Dean hadn't noticed till he saw his reflection in the little screen that he was grinning like he won the lottery or some crap. But all he saw was... damn- maybe he did win the lottery. The smile fades for a moment. He won the lottery and lost the lotto ticket. Or bought a pie and realized it expired the day before. Before he can self-degrade anymore Fawn comes in.
It took me such an embarrassing amount of time for me to remember the word case in this chapter, judge me in your head, but comment your love for the book 😉   OH BY THE WAY. The last chapter is next chapter (:
But he couldn’t.
Dean just moans and whines in response, biting into the pillow fabric as he feels
”Definitely.”
Dean pouts and then giggles a bit at Castiel who kept pecking his frowning mouth. “Okay okay,” he gives in, playfully  exasperated.
Dean handed out the cards between him and Cas and then put the rest of the deck between them, still in his head a bit. He was pulled out of it by Castiel putting a gentle hand on his knee. Dean's gaze flickered up to meet his eyes. "Yeah, Cas?"
Dean gets the visitor he’s longed to see in person.
The whole room hurt Dean's eyes, the room was bright purple, practically neon and filled with stuffed animals that stared at Dean with their beady plastic eyes. He steps closer to the crib to lean over it and there's no baby.
Castiel tugs the fabric down his legs. "I know you don't love your bowlegs, but I think that they make your walk so cute, you look like a cowboy when you walk." Castiel watched as Dean's eyes brightened at the comparison and his length took interest in the words as well.
From there it gets a little faster, enough for them to both be glad there were no neighbours around; and enough for Dean's breath to hitch but not come back just as fast after they both finished. Dean was gasping quietly, trying not to worry Castiel, but it was too late. Castiel noticed and immediately made sure his oxygen was coming through the tube and rubbed his chest lightly, guilt flowing through his gaze as he watched Dean fight a struggle he couldn't help him against.
Castiel listens, as best as he could. He could feel Sam’s pain and loss as much as his own. They both lost someone important to them.
Glancing over to his phone quickly, he wanted to feel himself relax when the words
Dean and Castiel glance over at her with amused but appreciative smiles. “You’re probably right,” Dean sighs.
Castiel's plump, pink, pillowed lips covered Dean's with gentle force and his hands move gently to cup Dean's face between them. Dean leans to kiss back trying to remember the feeling. Cas' lips were warm and he tasted like the honey tea he always had for breakfast.
I’ve decided there’s either going to be ten or eleven chapters. I’m not sure if they’ll come out in the next week or in the next month. I just kind of type. (:
Dean giggles softly and turns to fully face him again, glancing at his lips shyly. Castiel smiles, noticing his gaze and gently pressing his lips to Dean’s again.
”I know I’m right, I’m his wife,” Eileen says with a smug smile that has Dean chuckling.
Castiel sighs softly and rubs Dean’s back gently. “I didn’t want to tell you right away, I wanted to enjoy some time with you and then when we kissed I mean, I got distracted-“ he says softly and smiles.
Castiel nods again and gives a smile. Almost seeming embarrassed. "I don't that reference, but I am not good with understanding  many pop culture things." He says honestly and Dean can respect that.
Castiel giggles from the other side of the line.
Dean's harsh gaze stared straight into the reflective surface, glaring at the sight of himself. His hands clenched the corner of the sink so harshly he could feel the indents forming, but he refused to pull away. His eyes move over himself in the mirror, his nose scrunching in distaste at the sight of his freckled skin. He hated them; he hated himself. To him, the freckles were nothing more than annoying mistakes that littered his skin and made him flawed. He was already flawed, the freckles just made him feel even more flawed. He always noticed how slightly off centered his nose was, how many lines he had around his eyes, how tired he was, how reckless he could be, but he could live with those things because he always had. The freckles just started to show up over time and that's what he couldn't stand.
Gone was the ghostly and sick male who laid across from him all those months ago, now replaced with someone who had grown out of the hospital gown and was now living their life. A life away from the hospital.
"Cas?" Castiel questions, tilting his head. "Is that a nickname?" He asks curiously.
"Sam! No! I didn't get arrested-" Dean hears his roommate snort in amusement.
"I will be definitely showing you these so called 'ropes'." Castiel chimes from his bed and goes on to tell Dean every detail about how they had to share a bathroom and how they can leave the room by telling nurses and using wheelchairs, how checks go and food.
Warnings for this chapter:
Dean and Castiel spend the evening and the next morning together (:
Dean nods slowly with a grin and takes a bite of the burger and moans at the flavour. "Perfect," He murmurs, mouthful.
Charlie came running through adults and into the sitting room. Claire, the Tran kid and others he didn’t recognise followed. There was a loud bang. “Charlie?!” Dean shouted.
“Going to need more than a damn shrug Bobby. I live with the guy. What we talking here, rape, murder, rape and murder?”
“It wanted it to be you too,” Cas admitted, voice cracking under the weight of what they were doing to each other. His hand went to grip Dean’s thigh tight. “I’ve wanted you for so long Dean, you have no idea how long I’ve wanted this, wanted you.”
Cas made himself scarce the following morning, after spending the remainder of the night locked in his room. He couldn’t bear to look at Dean, not after what happened. The guilt burrowed its way inside of him, till he decided to drown it in copious amounts of alcohol. His brother Gabriel threw the wildest house parties around. Friday night was no exception.
“You’re an asshole Cas,” he crushed his lips against Cas because he can’t help himself when he’s turned on and Cas is staring at him like a hot meal, “Such a fucking asshole.”
“Easy for you to say,” he choked back a moan, “You’re out.”
Castiel swipes his thumb to where the smudge ends, behind Dean’s ear where his hairline begins, it means Dean has to crane his neck to the side for Castiel to get to it, which he does with ease, giving Castiel his whole neck to touch. He refrains, barely. Castiel does this action twice, maybe three times. Something about Dean exposing his neck for Castiel is enticing.
Oh. It
Cas nodded understanding what Dean was saying. Receiving a blow job from another guy was not something a straight guy would immediately jump to though words like that in Cas’ sultry tone made it difficult for Dean not to picture Cas with his mouth around his dick. He’d be eager, Dean knows how Cas responded to him before, the enthusiasm and the sheer drive to illicit sounds from him. Dean could build up to fast if he let himself.
“Cas, you awake?” he asked.
He took a few deep breaths, slapped his face, he could do this. He had to do this. Dean walked into his cell, clocking Cas lying on his bed, book in his hands relaxing. He peered over his book at Dean, watching Dean attentively with those cold blues as Dean maneuvered himself onto Cas’ bed, into Cas’ lap, legs on either side of his waist.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea Dean.” he replies. Dean’s face drops, like he’s been kicked.
“C’mon Cas, I got you.” Dean tells him knowing he’s close.
Dean smiles at that, almost chuckling a little. Castiel wants to hear what Dean sounds like when he laughs and means it. He brings his eyes up to meet Castiel’s. The anger is gone from him.
“I just want you to be safe ok?” he smiled hopefully showing her that he wasn’t mad, and she didn’t need to be worried about it. It seemed to do the trick. Her smile perked up again. She nodded. “Alright, go knock yourself out on the slide.”
“Oh yeah? What did you get up to?”
As much as he craved this and more, his brain was beginning to play tricks on him again.
you are.”
Gordon swiped at him, razor melted into the side of a toothbrush crossed Dean’s face, as if in slow motion Dean grabbed his wrist and smacked the weapon from his hand. Easy. It skidded along the ground, landing at the foot of another inmate. A hand that had a skull with exposed canines inked into it picked up the shiv. Cas had a front row seat in the circle that had grown around them. The Russian put the shiv into his pocket, removing it from the fight. Dean met his cold blues, eyes darting from Dean to behind him to where Gordon was.
They share a special moment with the world.
Once he had the door closed, his phone being held between his cheek and shoulder he unbuttoned his jeans to get a hold of his cock. A groan erupted out of him. He could hear Cas’ heavy breathing, slight sharp inhales and pained huffs every step he took to his room.
Cas always got his run in after school. He had to, the only way to burn off the energy of sitting in classrooms hour after hour listening to teachers drone on about SATs and college applications. It felt like it simmered just under the surface, bubbling away till the bell rang for 4pm and he could finally expel it. He used to run on the track at school till the coach spotted him and tried to coax him onto the track team. Not a chance. Cas didn’t need to be a part of anything, being a part of an academic institution was enough for him.
” Charlie tugged on his hand, bouncing up and down with excitement.
He spread his legs on instinct, brought his arm around the back of the sofa to make space for Cas to get closer to him. Dean checked his watch quickly to see how much they could indulge in this moment before reality came back to them. It wasn’t enough time for a fuck.
He’d be lying if he said it didn’t feel nice, once the initial shock wore off.
The guards dragged Dean from the Empty and towards the exit door he thought he’d never see again. He was out.
He turned back to the Russian’s table. Cas had his eyes on Dean, then moved them to his brother as if trying to tell Dean something then Dean clocked how the guards simultaneously turned their attention away from the center of the yard, one even making a point to do a 180 and walk back the way he came.
“I’m close Dean.” He said mixed with another sinful moan because Dean found that sweet spot and Cas started to see stars behind his eyes.
Cas comes with his mouth biting into the pillow because turns out that’s the best he’s ever had.
He stepped into Dean’s space and slipped his hands under Dean’s shirt, peeling it back off his shoulders and Dean took the message reaching back to take over stripping himself. Cas went to the other side of his bed to get his lube and tear off a condom from the strip.
“And how the hell would they be able to cook up something like Angel Grace in Purgatory?” Sam questioned the legitimacy of that rumour. It was a bit of a stretch to think something like could be happening in here in broad day light.
“Honey we’re home.” He mumbled half-heartedly.
“You said a bad word.” Claire, his daughter pointed out. Dean put his hand up to his mouth. He did, he always used bad words. As much as he tried to censor himself, it was too easy for him to drop in a swear word in his language.
yes,” he heaved, pushing himself back onto Cas’ finger. “More, fuck I need more Cas.”
“Get him!” Charlie pointed at her Dad.
Castiel’s sleepy. He can feel it coating him now after the story trying to pull him down onto the bed to where Dean is. He wants to re-arrange them so he can press their bodies together to heat himself up against the furnace that is his neighbor, fit Dean under his chin and feel Dean’s lips on his neck as he breathes. He wants to draw patterns on Dean’s back as they sink into their sleep together. He wants that and so much more. He has to be patient though.
She pursed her lips at the name. “I see you haven’t responded to the email concerning the annual Autumnal Fete bake sale.”
All he can do is hold on, hips swaying with Dean’s every movement. He knows Dean is trying to see what he likes, trying it all out and it’s all fantastic. His head is rolling around on Dean’s chest, hands in fists as Dean does his worst on him. He feels his orgasm building like a low rolling thunder.
“Can you move?” he asks. Cas tries. He can buts its difficult, more of a wriggle than actually being able to get himself out of Dean’s restrain. “Good.”
“So, how’s the Russian?” Sam asked.
Gah, this got really intense.
He learned that night what the eyes on either side of Cas’ hips meant. He also learned how awesome Cas was at giving head. Dean made a passing comment about how Cas totally earned those eyes which had the Russian laughing and Dean liked the way he sounded.
“Wasn’t it you who told me to be brave?” he sassed back, hoping it was ease up the deadly grip Cas had on his hand. He needed that wrist, liked having all his bones unbroken.
There’s a familiar record store boarded up. It’s not been replaced by anything. He gets a sudden sinking feeling. His footsteps slow down to a complete stop.
“One filled bucket for the pretty boy.” Balthazar’s voice came before his body did. Dean let his top drop from his grip in time. He stepped through the door carrying the bucket, steam from the hot water rising above. Dean took it off of his hands, ignoring the comment about being a pretty boy.
AND that was how they thought it was a good idea to which brings us back to the current situation.
“Talk to me
“Not just a pretty face.” Dean hums behind Cas then gets to work on his cock with more ease than previously. He can work with this angle. He knows this.
The urge to punch him was there, he resisted.
He was quick and when he got back Dean was at his desk, pulling up that video they never managed to get around to finishing on his laptop. The packet of smokes rested on the table beside him along with his zippo, silver with a W engraved into it. Cas ran his finger over it.
He made his way up Dean’s body in that fashion till he left the final kiss on Dean’s sweated forehead.
Cas told him about why he was missing count. That he was getting deliveries into the kitchen containing contraband that was going to be split between Purgatory and Hell when it was ready. Whatever “when it’s ready” meant Dean wasn’t privy to. It wouldn’t be feasible to do it with other inmates lurking around and especially during their work detail when they actually had to cook food for the place. They paid off guards to help them, those who wouldn’t take payment were threatened or blackmailed into complying to them. Zachariah was included in that mix, made sense why was pretending Cas was there for count when he blatantly wasn’t.
He hears Dean exhale, feels him back up enough to create space between them. Cas looks up and sees Dean’s face register what he’s saying. His eyes soften but its jaw is set, like he’s angry about something, just not at Cas. It doesn’t settle the bitterness in him.
Cas replied, along with another sex filled breathy exhale. Holy crap, Cas was jacking off to him. No hiding that, no covering that up with anything other than what it was. He scrambled off the sofa to head to his bedroom to fully enjoy this.
Dean nodded, pulling at his bottom lip. His orgasm building fast and then it hit him hard. He threw his head back, grunting out as Cas milked him, cum spilling out between them. It was euphoric, all the time not touching himself only making his orgasm that much harder. White spots blurred his vision. Cas’ name on his tongue over and over and over like a prayer being answered.
“If it isn’t the Winchesters, back from the nurse’s office,” Masters said voice in a constant state of sultry. He reached out to touch Sam’s sling. “Need help getting undressed stud?”
Turns out he doesn’t have to, Cas’ bare foot steps leave the apartment, he thinks he’s gone, that’s it.
“They’re getting impatient.” Dean said, showing Cas his phone screen. The rolling comments popping up one after the other after the other. Somehow, they had the most intense following,
With his eyes on the road he could only steal a quick glance in Cas’ direction. His friend stared at his hand, smiling quietly to himself at the gesture. It plucked at his heart, knowing that Cas wished more than anything they could do more than this in the daylight. Dean wasn’t ready for that. He knew Cas respected it but that didn’t mean he had to like it and as the days rolled on, he could sense Cas longing for more. Most of the time he chose to ignore it. Denial had been Dean’s good friend most of his life, long before Cas showed up.
Cas goes, always.
He paused, lifting himself up on his elbow to look down at Cas. His face dimly lit in orange. The Russian wasn’t looking at Dean, eyes stuck to the metal springs above his head, off in a memory, being pulled away from Dean.
“It’s the Russkies,” one of them replied. “They’re killing each other in the kitchen!”
Cas had poured himself one too, he was leaning against the kitchen counter. Cas’ eyes cast to Dean’s mouth and Dean retreated his tongue from his lip. He blinked away as if he didn’t seem too fussed he had been caught staring.  “I highly doubt my coffee is that good.”
“Ugh fuck,” he cursed chasing Cas’ hand. His own taking grips of the bedsheets beside him.
“Oh my God, you’re so sweet, thank you! We’re just by the pool table.” She beams a smile at him. She’s cute, any other occasion he’d be inclined to make a pass on her. He doesn’t feel it tonight, hasn’t felt it in a few weeks if he’s being honest. Cas and his blue eyes ruining Dean’s insatiable appetite to flirt with anything that has a nice ass and a pretty smile. It’s like no one else even gets on his blood pumping anymore.
”Castiel lick ass Novak-“ Dean whispers in response and he can feel Castiel’s laugh rumble through him.
"We'll be exploring that later," He chuckles and presses his lips to Dean's forehead before getting up, grabbing his bag and leaving the room.
Dean tells Sam about the news and distracts himself by talking to his roommate. A Castiel Novak.
Dean's face burns brightly because he was currently about to be spanked by a pizza man version of his best friend right after having mind-blowing sex. Dean was nuzzling against a pillow that had fallen on the floor and Castiel chuckled from above him. "I need a verbal answer to make sure this is okay, Dean," He says and Dean nods quickly.
“I can love you without breaking the code,” Cas put his hand to Dean’s face registering what the concern had been. His thumb swiped under Dean’s eye. “And I do love you Dean. You love me too, don’t you?”
Then Dean speaks.
“I wanna ruin you.” Dean replied. He pressed his mouth to Cas’ thigh, a light kiss. His first.
“Nah she’s cool - you don’t mind if Cas joins us right Jess?”
Cas met his earnest green eyes, turning his mouth up in a quiet devious smile. He liked the images his brain concocted. Dean alone in his room, bringing himself right to the cusp of cumming and stopping himself over and over till he couldn’t take it anymore. Beautiful.
Castiel lifts his mug, clinks it against Dean’s.
Dean lifted the card off the deck. It was a ten.
“I was giving a lecture.”
“Yes, I understand,” his voice lost its grit. He took his book back and lay back down. Dean took that as their conversation was over. He hopped back onto the top bunk, trying to get his breath back. He survived that, not too bad.
“Heaven’s Little Angels? Like the orphanage?” Dean asks. That’s right, Dean doesn’t know, not really. The story he told Dean omits the actual truth of their childhood.
He closed the windows, fighting away the feelings. He had an exam to prepare for.
“Hey Cas.” Dean’s smile is warm and quiet, like he’s a bit nervous too. It helps Castiel.
Dean and Cas go on dates and they talk about it on the phone after.
It didn’t need much pretending. Dean could get used to this about as quick as he got used to the innocent kisses. He watched as Gordon’s face started to register what was happening, taking a step back to get the full view of it. The Russian plastered behind Dean, claiming him like any Daddy would to their prag when threatened by someone who wasn’t part of their gang. A display straight out of a documentary on Animal Planet.
Cas opened up his fridge like he lived there. “I can put something together.”
Not sated enough from his drunken hookups Cas found himself spending too much time on the website their videos were on. His hunger had him searching for other amateur videos, ones with dark haired tops and light brown-haired bottoms. Cas would bring himself close enough to the edge with them, then quickly open up the video of Dean cumming to finish himself off. The sex filled desperate moans of his friend, his new favourite sound. If only he could hear it again.
His phone buzzed in his pocket, startling Cas because their thighs were touching. They had been too engrossed in the defeat of the alien army. “Sorry," he fished his phone out. He unlocked his phone. “It’s just Benny.” He opened up the conversation window. Cas had leaned over to look at the messages. They weren’t anything saucy.
She batted his hand away, reaching up to poke into something fragile on the back of his neck. He winced, stepping away from her. “What the hell Harvelle?”
“Do ya hear me Russian scum?” the guy shoved Cas. Dean felt the whole corridor inhale as they watched on.
Dean obeyed, hands reaching back to get a hold of himself. He waited for Cas, waited with bated breath till a cold touch pressed against his rim, pressed inside making him hide his muffled moans into the pillow. A reflex he had grown accustomed to, having to keep quiet, he didn’t have to though and when Cas pushed in the second finger Dean didn’t hold back, letting the moan vibrate out of him, letting Cas know how good it felt.
Bobby was more than surprised that Dean was taking his lunch break today.
“I didn’t
Charlie had strategically managed to get herself extra time in the playground in the park after pre-school. Dean tried to keep it down to half an hour. She bargained an extra fifteen minutes for helping Dean sort out the recycling. She knew her Dad well. The chill was getting worse. It wasn’t like Dean was jumping around the jungle gym manic like his daughter. He had his butt parked on the cold bench trying to breathe heat into his hands. He'd bring a hat next time. The winter was fast approaching. No doubt it would snow this year.
”Whatever you say, love,” he teases and kisses Dean’s lips.
Dean gives a grin as he steps back. “Of course I did, bitch.” He says as Castiel steps forward and envelops Dean’s hand in his own, a smile towards Sam showing.
Aha, I’m writing my little note up here. I hope y’all enjoy/enjoyed the story. I knew the ending since before I started this book and I hope it doesn’t hurt your expectations too much. Anyway, warnings are listed at the bottom this time, but they will spoil it. So if you want to be surprised, don’t check. But I’ll mark where the warning part begins & ends. ALSO there will be no epilogue because I want you guys to try and think up your best idea of the epilogue in the comments. Thank you for reading.
Dean had his phone to his ear, biting his lip as he listened to the ringing tone over the speaker. "Pick up, pick up,
"I'm not gonna lie to you, I think this may be something more serious than what you think it is. I'm going to send you to the hospital for a chest x-ray." He says, starting to write a referral and an email.
”Yes, Dean?”
and count how many times I hit your ass, understand?" Cas says with a top voice that had Dean in full bottom mode.
There's some mention of Castiel's religion and he is Christian so I just wanted to let you know ahead.
They held him after his first heartbreak and let go of him when he decided that he wanted to travel after graduation.
The door opens and in comes a giant moose, giving a slightly apologetic smile. “Hey, Dean,” he says as he walks over.
If Dean didn't already have a currently hitched breath, it would've been taken away by the gorgeous facial features the male had and the soft gaze upon his eyes. "Sorry to bother you, dude, do you mind if I..." He holds up his phone, words functioning less with the guy's unwavering stare on him.
Dean felt Cas’ arms still around his waist, though one arm was unwinding to gently held the side of his jaw and Dean instinctively turned his head into the touch, feeling Cas’ thumb pull gently at his bottom lip. His mouth tugs gently into a smile as he opens his eyes and meets Castiel’s magnificent blue ones.
The heart monitor was skipping a bit, it sounded too fast. It sounded so loud. But he didn’t click the help button. He could barely move.
"Yeah, right with me. Since when do doctors ever show up on time." He grumbles to himself, looking around the room to study the posters boredly while he awaited the doctor to show up.
"I wonder what would happen if maybe we had a conversation about us." Castiel says softly against Dean's lips.
“You haven’t even seen your man cave, or your garage, or the bedroom.” A gravel voice from behind him says.
”Well, I hope you’re having a great day and maybe the next video will be me skinny dipping so the ocean can suck it.” Castiel snorts in the video and Dean cracks a wide smile that hurts.
”I’d like that.” Dean says softly, breathless, in the good way this time.
The drive was calm, Castiel speaking of his plans outside the hospital walls. He had gotten used to his job in the bookstore and it was attached to a coffee shop. He saw Gabriel pretty regularly and got to take on jogging again.
It wasn’t Castiel’s place to decline or tell Dean that he wasn’t allowed. Dean was of course allowed to do whatever he wanted. It didn’t stop Castiel from thinking of every worse case scenario on the planet. Nodding slowly, he watches a wide smile break along Dean’s lips and knew he made the right choice.
Billie was quiet for a few moments. “Castiel, I... Ive grown fond of you and your ‘Team Free Will’. I’m sure I can glance away or distract if you ever want to see him. But it was his time, he did the right thing.” She says and Castiel stares at the folded piece of paper in his hand.
Dean chuckles, blushing. “I just- wanted to be careful- I don’t know how much of Dad has gotten to you-“ He’s once again cut off.
And for the moment? Dean believed it.
"Go lay on the bed, I'm going to go into the small room on the other side of the glass and when I speak to you through the microphone, please do as I instruct so we can have accurate x-rays." Dr. Jackie says with a sweet smile as Dean takes his shoes off and goes to lie on the almost plastic feeling cot.
And he did. He just didn’t want to think about it after he had left the room. Said he’d see Dean tomorrow, kissed him goodbye and didn’t notice the pain. Ignored the weight on him as he left. The feeling of darkness. He had left anyway.
Dean could practically feel Castiel's smile through the phone and it made his heart clench with love. "
Dean's face burns red at the tone of his voice and his down south area has taken interest in what was happening at this moment, and Dean realized something as well. This was
Dean realized quickly it was the mixtape that he had made Castiel all those years ago. He gave him a wide smile. “Pop it in, baby, we got a long ride ahead of us.” He chimes and Castiel complies, putting the Zeppelin cassette into the player.
”He never got to me, Dean. You know why? Because he wasn’t the one who was there for me. He wasn’t the one teaching me what I needed to live.” He says, squeezing Dean’s arm gently.
They eat Silently, the only sounds coming from the machines around them.
The ocean. The water that Dean had spent a good amount of time around was pooled around his ankles as he stood with Castiel, just breathing.
Rough to read, but short.
WARNING: Mention of a God/belief.
”My phone rang again... not long after and I thought it was some dumb telemarketer. No-“ he sniffles hard. “The hospital.”
Dean narrows his gaze suspiciously. “You’re supposed to be at school! You know- university or whatever?” He asks. “What are you doing here, Sammy?”
”Just making sure,” Dean says for what was probably the thousandth time since he’s been in heaven.
“morning, sunshine! Today is scrambled eggs and toast.” She says happily.
"I want you to see yourself, I want to see how well you react to what's going to be happening. How amazing you look when you're so vulnerable and perfect for me. A perfect and good boy." Castiel says, watching as Dean shudders at what he says.
Billie looks at Castiel for a moment before giving a short nod. “I learned that if I put you people in hell, it doesn’t end well. But he’s with his brother, his parents, Bobby, all if them, in heaven.” She replies.
“Is that the show You were talking about? Doctor Sexy?” He asks with a curious head tilt.
"Just lay with me, I want to sleep now." Dean adds on after a moment, watching Castiel slowly nod and lay beside him, arm over his waist carefully, to keep him close.
It doesn't take long for a doctor with a caramel complexion, a white coat, and a name tag that says 'Dr. Jackie' to come and get him. He was concerned for himself only based off the fact that the speed of him getting in was too fast for him to not have any huge problems. "Make sure you have no jewelry on and please remove any unnecessary layers. Make sure your shirt is completely cotton or very thin. Shoes off." She says gently and takes his leather jacket, his over coat, and his flannel from him as he strips those layers off.
Castiel let a small smile, a curious smile playing his lips. "What about us?" He asks as he moves his hand to hold Dean's.
Dean gives Gabriel a smile as he gets back into his bed. "Hello," he murmurs politely and watches as Gabriel gives a very friendly and bright smile.
Castiel gasps and makes his hand to his chest. “Oh my gosh, the honour. I’ve never felt so completed!” He says and Dean giggles.
Dean stares at the chocolate pudding until suddenly he's staring into the darkness of his eyelids and he sinks away into a well-needed sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean takes it all in, the bright blue of the ocean seemed so dull in comparison to shine in Cas' eyes. 'so cheesy' Dean rolls his eyes at himself. He glances at Castie; again. "You didn't have to do this for me-" he's cut off by Castiel's lips being pressed against him.
Castiel, nods, seeming to think over his words. "You seem to not like showing that you are in pain."
It’s silent between them for a moment.
Foggy memories appear at the front of his brain as he rubs his eyes. Cas was gone and the sound of only one heart monitor showed that. Looking at his lap to calm himself down, he sees the camcorder placed along the blankets. Glancing around, Dean decided that he could watch another video because no one was there to entertain him or stop him.
Sam walked into the family garage. Glancing at the sheet covered car body and pulling it off. “This here, is your uncle’s car, her name is Baby.” He glances to make sure his son was paying attention, he was.
”How about I show you what I can do to that ass with my tongue, won’t even know what hit you.” He whispers softly in Dean’s ear, kissing along his jaw.
But Castiel beat him to the punch. “Dean? Are you awake?” He asks, Dean nods before realizing Castiel probably couldn’t see him.
It shouldn’t sound as surreal as it does. But breathing didn’t come as easy as it once did. Right now though, it felt like Dean didn’t need air to live. He glanced at Castiel who has a smile so wide and eyes squeezed shut as the sea mist hits him. He was beautiful.
He answers it.
Castiel gave him a smile, this ride meant a lot more to Dean than he was letting on. He gentle takes Dean’s hand and then holds up something in his other.
”Hello, Sam,” He greets and Sam smiles back, surprised, but not disappointed. “Hey, Cas,” he says and smiles at the two holding hands.
There is his best friend, standing in black work pants, and a dark blue work shirt with a pizza company Dean is unfamiliar with, embroidered into the shirt. Castiel is wearing a visor over his tussled black hair, one with the same company on it, and holding a pizza box in front of him. The whole thing was starting to feel like deju vu or something to Dean, there was something familiar about what is going on.
"Just... thinking." Dean murmurs softly, chewing his bottom lip as he watched Castiel tilt his head.
Sam feels tears roll down his cheeks, but not because he’s in pain. But because he’s happy and fulfilled.
Castiel: I’m sending you pie, don’t worry I made it so it probably isn’t poisoned ;)
This whole thing seems a bit sketchy to him, so he goes upstairs to check on the child. Taking note of the photos lining the wall. The couple in the photos were very young, photos from the wedding, and then towards the top there were a few baby photos. Great, he was watching a baby. He pushes open a door that has the name 'Winnie' stickered on the front of it.
Soft reminder: I thrive off comments.
Sam smiles, soft breaths leaving his mouth as he stares up at him. Eyes tired, but strong.
Sam, himself, Jack, and Castiel sat on the table in the bunker, with bottles of beer, a whiskey, or a juice box in each of their hands. He smiles, eyes filling with tears before he realized how much those people were his family. He places it down and glances at the other frames. Pictures of him and Sam, Baby, and Castiel filled most of the others. However, none Dean hadn’t seen before. He took a step back, admiring. “Damn, the perfect apple pie home.” He says out loud to himself.
Castiel stares out the windshield. The weather contrasting the deep hurt that had happened in the time he’s been in the car. He takes a breath. “Sam, I’m so-“ he cuts himself off, those words never helped anybody during a time like this.
Sam looks up at her, making sure she has a good view of his lips as it’s a bit difficult to sign with a baby, his baby, in his arms. “I just know that if he was here, he’d be telling me that he feels bad that you had to push a baby moose out and that he’s... that he’s proud of me.” He says, holding the baby a bit tighter and feeling Eileen’s hand on his.
Castiel takes a moment before he responds. “I’d really enjoy that, Dean, but do you think it’s a good idea with your condition-“
Dean watches more clips on the camcorder and gets guest, though it isn’t who he’s expecting.
Dean had been messing around in the Bunker's storage, peeking through dusty boxes filled with files, pictures, objects. Everything was labelled perfectly, everything except this strange bronze sphere in glass casing. It immediately spiked Dean's interest and Sam wasn't here to reprimand him, and Cas was who knows where, so he opened the glass box and as soon as his fingertips brushed the ball, it felt like he was being transported. His vision went black and his body dropped to the floor, the ball and the casing beside him, but not damaged. The ball rolled a few inches away and the box fell on it's side where a piece of clear masking tape was visible at the right angle and in very faded sharpie, were the words
“See you soon, angel.” Dean says and waits for Cas’ side of the line to go dead before he drops his phone and presses his fist into his mouth as he wracks up a sob, exhausted,
By the time that Castiel had actually pulled his tongue out and his mouth away, Dean was a shaking and needy mess. Castiel runs his hand up Dean's back to grab a light hold of his hair as his other hand shifts around and then Dean hears a buckle. "I'm going to fuck you now, Dean, would you like that? I'm going to screw you so hard that you'll forget how to function, then, I'm going to make your ass as red as I can so you can't sit properly for weeks." He murmurs in Dean's ear and Dean practically cries tears of need.
the bunker and something was
Dean blinked quickly into realization that someone was there when a hand went on his shoulder and he tensed, spinning around to meet the gaze. "Cas?" He breathes out, confused and still trying to fully reach his normal functioning self again.
...I thrive off comments, let me know your thoughts and feelings.
Third Person.
“Cas, in the most polite way possible. Fuck my condition. I’m asking just for this, okay? Let me take you on a drive.” He says, seeming almost desperate.
”Oh, am I?”
Dean sighs, content with Castiel content. At least for the moment. He already missed actual Castiel.
”You did?? Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” Dean asks and he feels Castiel tighten his arms around him.
"Okay, Jerk."
Before he got a word in, Fawn starts to speak. “Okay, get up, get your shoes on. I already got you hooked up to the transferable oxygen machine.” She says quickly, Dean barely has time to process the words.
"You're so amazing, Dean, I couldn't imagine being with someone better than you." He whispers softly against his ear.
”That you love me because I love you, Cas, a lot. More than you will ever know. I love you with my whole damn being. I wouldn’t have made it this far without you. Not through the end of the world, multiple times, not through my brother’s death, not through anything. I’m just so thankful that you’re here with me. That you’re mine.” Dean swallows thickly, looking down at his hand that was currently in his lap.
After a few minutes of the annoying beeps, two nurses came in. One was lovely lady named Allie and the other was a kind girl named Fawn. They were both amazing people and very soft and caring as Allie checked Castiel and Fawn checked Dean. “What have you two trouble makers been up to?” Allie Asia and Dean glances over to Castiel as Castiel looks at Dean.
Castiel was already picking at his food as he glanced at Dean. “It’s as good as microwaveable steak gets. Though, it comes close to State & Main.” He says as he takes another bite.
He scrunches his nose sleepily, not wanting to acknowledge the voice.
Sam was more excited than he let on as he squeezes Dean into a close hug. “You’re bossy.” He grumbles into his shoulder, Teasing.
”And... I have decided to not have the tv on. I know when you come, doctor sexy will be playing but I’d rather have you. You’re way cuter than him and you always ramble and I wanna listen tomorrow. I wanna do that for you. I love you, hopefully I remember to delete this before you see this-“ he says before sneezing.
After Castiel finished explaining everything, Dean smiled and tilted his head. "Wanna play 21 questions?"
Dean glanced at the water below him. Sometimes he wished he was a seashell. Where he was allowed to sink to the depths and not have to worry about anything because it didn’t matter. Or he could be found and placed on a mantle like he was prized and desired. He wanted to be something.
All was well with Dean Winchester and all is well with Dean Winchester.
Dean catches Castiel's stare in the mirror and Castiel gives a sly smile towards him and wraps an arm around Dean's waist and pulls him into his lap. Dean is
”yeah, I can’t sleep,” he says softly, trying to be honest.
Dean's eyes reluctantly open to look at Castiel, lips parted in shock, something the angel takes soft advantage of, gently kissing him again, he still hears the 'you love me?' that Dean breathes out. Well, he feels it more than hears it, but he understands nonetheless. He pulls away and gives Dean a shy gaze of his own, a slight nod, then tilts his head, waiting for the hunter's answer. When Dean's flushes and he ducks his head into a yes, Castiel pulls him gently to one of the bedrooms. Dean's room more specifically.
Dean looked around, squinting as he leaned against the impala with relaxed posture, he imagines Castiel in front of him, kissing his lips gently with his hands pressed against Dean's jaw. Dean smiles a bit more, his tongue between his teeth for a moment as he focuses on the road to his side and the forest trees in front of him, leaves rustling gently around him. "Hey, baby, just wanted to call you." Dean replies, voice steady, a soft and gentle undertone.
”Let me show you my hot spot then, that’s my house. Come on, I’ll drive. I already grabbed some medicines for the night from the hospital because I know that sometimes the pain is worse during the evening. And I didn’t steal them, Fawn helped me make sure everything was in order.” Castiel rambles as he helps Dean get into the passenger seat and then gets into his own seat.
Dean seemingly gasps for his breath as his eyes flicker open and then squint at the brightness of the screen in front of him. Had he fallen asleep in front of the television? Dean looked around, this was
"Let's get a move on, little bro! Don't question the suit, I don't need your sickly contagious germs all over me!" He says as he walks closer to Cas.
That hope was crushed when the doctor nods. "I actually think that driving wouldn't be a smart idea for you right now, but you seem like the stubborn type so please- head straight there." Dr. Tacer says and hands Dean the note in the scribbled jumble of words that was only read among people in the medical field.
Dean nods. "But you're getting better now?" He replies, nuzzling against him again, feeling Castiel nod against him.
?" Castiel says, his voice getting a bit distant as he put his phone on speaker.
"I never got to say it earlier..." Dean murmurs to Cas and Castiel tilts his head to look into Dean's sleepy gaze.
Castiel shows Dean how much he truly loves him, in less than wholesome ways.
"Alright, Mr. Winchester- please be as still as you can, light breaths if you can. Keep your back straight." She says through the loud speaker and Dean listens to her every word.
Castiel moves to stand by the head of the bed, where he can look down at Dean's face, his tears were drying, but Castiel could still see the pain and sorrow in them. Right now, it was his mission to make Dean feel loved and valued. To make him feel
Dean was lost, he didn't understand what she meant. "So... do I just get some sort of inhaler and some drugs and then I'm good to go?-" He starts, but she shakes her head, making him stop speaking.
Castiel says and begins.
“I missed you,” Dean murmurs softly, closing his eyes and inhaling softly through his nose, taking everything about Castiel in.
Dean pauses for a moment. “Cas, did you just make a semi joke?” He gasps, ignoring the dull pain that rested in his chest after that motion.
Dean walks in through the regular hospital entrance, going to the front desk. "Hello, ma'am, I was referred here by a Dr. Tacer? I have a note." He says and hands the page to the woman behind the desk.
News flash: It wasn’t a dream. Dean wakes up sore and with Fawn turning his oxygen machine up because his body wasn’t producing enough. She fixes his bed and puts the tray over his lap.
"Okay, now..." The blind is pulled off and Dean squints as light hits him.
Dean snorts "Who are you? Dr. Phil?" He grins slightly and watches as Castiel tilts his head in a questionable manner.
"You ordered pizza?" Castiel's voice breaks through Dean's questionable thoughts and Dean shudders at the low graveled growl in his tone, he bites his lip and holds the door open for Castiel, who steps in and gives Dean a once over with his gaze; it's something that makes Dean feel self-conscious and flustered.
“Before?” Cas asked. He ran his fingers under Dean’s top at the back, pressed his thumbs into the muscles there just at the base of his neck. Dean tried to hold in a pathetic whine that was making its way up his throat. He had a murderer's hands on his body, and he didn’t want it to stop anytime soon.
