"I'm not upset," Sherlock said quickly. "I'm just..." He trailed off. "I'm just glad," he said at last. "Should I get some wine?"
"What?" Sherlock still seemed to be avoiding eye contact.
"Nonsense,” Sherlock said. “They might think we've just got married for tax reasons."
"You know what."
Sherlock glares at her before she can even pretend to offer them drinks.
and not when Sherlock knows that John can
John found, to his surprise, that he wanted to hear him make a sound. He wanted to hear his voice.
Sherlock stares at her in horror for a few minutes before he ducks over a fence and into the enclosed pet cemetery, where he has some urgent business to take care of. And possibly a Victorian era dog to exhume, once darkness has fallen, but that’s neither here nor there.
But this wasn’t like that.
This is all fucked up, just like the rest of his life.
But finding a solution to that problem isn't easy.
And it wasn’t a conscious decision, John thought, when he started cooking a really nice meal for the two of them. He wasn’t laying the ground for some serious conversation, a proper heart-to-heart. But he had to admit when finished his vegetable curry and found himself making some fancy rice with more ingredients than one to go with it that it was turning out like that. He even had some dough rising in the sink, all prepared to become naans.
However, living with Sherlock Holmes also meant that John had access to someone who could help him connect the dots when he was out of his depth.
Sherlock takes a breath as if about to list a long list of people.
But this is the great thing about having gone back to Baker Street, rather than finding a new flat. There is nothing to decide. John's things obviously go into the room that's known as "John's room." Nothing to think about.
"Noted," he says stiffly and reaches for his laptop.
Sherlock huffs. “No, John. I don’t think I’ll need therapy to deal with
And why
But this.
“Wait, so law enforcement is in on this immunity deal with Santa?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “The plot thickens.”
Sherlock’s lips were warm, his tongue soft and his taste… Christ, John prided himself on having a way with words but his brain was going offline.
Well, obviously, he could lie to him. He's done that, before. He's bluffed, he's deflected and he's outright lied to his face. But if this is supposed to be their new beginning, he can't do that now.
John felt dizzy.
“John, I probably should've said... I should've said sometime today that I'm sorry.” Sherlock broke eye-contact at the words. Words he normally used so sparingly but offered now.
“Gingerbread?” he wondered out loud. “Something I can’t pronounce with cranberries and white chocolate and pistachios? Or your garden variety chocolate chip cookies? What do you fancy?”
This is the first time since they’ve seen each other since they said goodbye at the tarmac. By then, Sherlock had mentally said goodbye to all of this. London. 221B. John. Resolved that he’d never see them again.
He snuggles into the pillow, inhaling deeply. It smells of nothing much, but he imagines that he can detect a trace of Sherlock's shampoo.
"Lestrade?"
So John tried again to broach the subject he’d been dwelling on all night. Because he needed to wrap his head around it somehow.
But not like this.
It had been an odd year, this. Filled with drama and horrors and unpleasantness. One of those years where you find yourself thinking again and again “surely things cannot get any worse than this?” and then they do.
"Don't be stupid, she's very reliable and most unlikely to kill us herself."
“Ah, my conductor of light.” Sherlock didn’t lift his face from John’s neck, but John could hear the smile in his voice.
Now that they both know that this isn't a temporary arrangement, it feels even more intimate. It's lovely. Domestic and... Comforting.
"I know." Sherlock still didn’t seem to find the conversation more interesting than the bees. It was starting to get on John’s nerves.
"Mandatory counselling?"
The pack was almost over, he’d switch back to his regular old PG tips soon enough and the thought was bittersweet. Normality and routine was nice, but this had actually been the best Christmas John could remember. He’d miss it, in the greyness of January.
“Sherlock, we agreed. I’m making an effort. Is it really too much to ask that you sit down for four fucking minutes and eat a bloody cookie? Seriously?”
“I think,” sighed Sherlock with a small huff of a laugh, “that this might have been a new record in processing a sexual identity crisis. Excellent work.”
Santa surely didn’t approve of that.
Sherlock caught on quickly.
"How often can I say this, Mary? I don't need any help. I've lived with him longer than you have. Everything will be fine. John will be fine. The only thing stopping us from being fine is your continued presence in London. Go. Away."
“Is this okay?” John asked.
It was, however, his unbiased opinion that Sherlock’s cock was magnificent. Perfect. Absolutely mouth-watering.
“Not to worry, it’ll stay between just the two of us. We…” Sherlock takes another sip of water. “We can pretend it never happened.”
Sherlock will be there for him.
John stopped. He was standing right next to Sherlock, not saying a word, not touching. He took a deep breath.
"I want everything," Sherlock whispers against his mouth and his hands are everywhere, stroking John's sides, ghosting the top of his arse, gently twisting his nipples.
Daunting as hell as well – but John Watson didn’t think of himself as someone who backed down from a challenge, so he opened his mouth and tasted Sherlock. He licked carefully, getting a feel for him, getting to know his taste and texture. The sounds from Sherlock didn’t disappoint. He positively whimpered and his knees seemed to wobble slightly.
He spends the first few hours of the morning doing not much of anything.
John uses his right hand to reach for a slightly rumpled looking napkin which he slides under Sherlock’s coat to wipe his hand. He then tucks Sherlock away and carefully zips him up. Then he drags the coat over himself and gives Sherlock a wink.
He leaves his laptop on the sofa table in a wordless invitation to crack the password and use it for whatever it is that Sherlock does with laptops during the middle of the night.
"What do you mean?" asked John.
Seriously, though, is it fair that
The thing that Sherlock considers "not his area."
"No, when writing up the marital laws."
"What am I supposed to tell girls, Sherlock?"
“Do you understand what I’m about to do?”
“Anyway,” John continued undeterred, “whatever it is, it’s a bit clever. It’s about how Santa always tells you to be good all year, right? But then there’s this whole week at the end of the year which is after Christmas but before the new year. And maybe…well, the wording sort of suggests that this week doesn’t count, doesn’t it? You can do whatever you like without any consequences.”
But still, this felt like he was touching Sherlock for the first time. His fingertips tingled where they touched the warm skin.  A soft whimper escaped Sherlock when John allowed his fingers to trace his jawline all the way back to the thin, sensitive skin of his neck and then glide into Sherlock’s curls.
"So they wouldn't send you back? To Serbia?"
Sherlock was hunched over his microscope when John entered the flat, apparently deep in research, but his dressing gown was gently fluttering around his calves. One might suspect that he’d rushed to this position only moments before.
"So, do you think the Minister really did it or are those photographs fakes?"
The reply comes instantly.
Sometimes he suspects that being numb is really the default state of John Watson. Brief interludes of life, laughter and excitement are the exceptions.
“I…” Sherlock whispered. “I outright refuse.”
No. The worst of all is the comfort his stupid mind appears to take in Mary's -
His hands are in John's hair, they're on his neck, they're exploring his face.
Boring.
"There is no legal way for us to get divorced, John."
What on earth is her agenda here? Even now, when the battle has (just about) been lost and won, Sherlock still can't quite wrap his head around Mary Morstan. He knows the facts. He knows some of her background, her contract with Moriarty, her plan in marrying John. But he doesn't quite know what makes her tick. Not fully.
It's like the way he felt after Sherlock. The fall.
Christ, they’d be in marriage counselling for communication problems before the month was out. John ran a hand through his hair and valiantly struggled on.
But he doesn't wait to do that. He's eager to suck his bottom lip into his mouth, lick it and taste it and worship it in any way he knows how. And Sherlock - Sherlock who doesn't think of this sort of thing as "his area" seems blissfully eager to do the same, dipping his tongue between John's lips with passion and eagerness John had never imagined the great Sherlock Holmes might actually turn on him.
“Are you with me?”
“What?” Sherlock sounds honestly startled.
But several of his girlfriends HAVE told him that he's a great and considerate companion for Sherlock, so maybe he shouldn't change anything? (He’d always considered this comment nothing more than an irritated jibe from soon-to-be-ex girlfriends, and it’s worrying to be suddenly taking it at face value)
Neither of them returned the greeting.
“I see.”
But when he was there, sitting next to Sherlock's bed, John didn't know what to do.
He seems pleased. Happy, even, as he leans forward and kisses Sherlock one last time before he disappears into the lavatory to clean up.
“Oh, I’m not hungry,” said Sherlock, perfectly nonchalant, his eyes fixed on some distant point in the ceiling, as he sauntered towards the sofa.
“But what if it isn’t Santa Claus you’re worried about?”
"I've done that," Mary says, echoing his thoughts. "I was with him, before. I can tell you what he needs."
And that's before he's even tasted Sherlock properly.
He does no such thing.
But saw the signs in John Watson. The guilty eyes, the nervous fondling of his phone, his over compensating with his family and then the avoidance of eye-contact when the reminders of his betrayal pop up in his mind again.
He hasn't done anything else, mind you. He hasn't contacted his landlord, he hasn't looked at flats online - but he has almost completely packed.
"As if you can tell me anything about John Watson."
"Off," he mutters and pulls at the shirt, and Sherlock complies easily, seemingly not wanting to do anything that might delay matters.
John was sat in his chair, thinking about this, feeling inadequate for not being able to do something millions of people all around the world were probably doing right this minute. Granted – most of them were probably making horrible tea – but still. They were still making it. And not feeling inferior and miserable for not being able to do it properly.
Sherlock makes the best sound when John's hands find their way up to his nipples.
“Good to know that this won’t, ngh, stop you from mocking me.”
“Well, about the…the divorce.”
She doesn't.
Friends with benefits was never on the agenda.
John wasn’t sure what Sherlock was after. Telling him he’d be getting a lump of coal in his stocking seemed redundant. Sherlock was the main coal distributor of the house, after all.
A whimper.
"Oh, don't get your knickers in a twist. I’m not going to lecture you about technique. I’m sure Google has all the information you might need."
"A post-nup, then,” John clarified. “Isn't your brother supposed to be clever about these things? I’m sure he could rig something up. You're much better off than I am. What if we fall out before the whole mess can be cleaned up and I decide to use the divorce proceedings to fleece you to the bone?"
He wasn’t really that surprised to find a black car waiting for him outside the clinic at the end of the day.
John felt himself sag with relief. He'd worried that this was something truly bad. Something awful. Sure, he had been under the impression that they had only been married for about a week, but this was no big deal. Might mean a few extra pages on their tax returns, but hardly anything more sinister.
After dinner they move back to the sofa with their glasses. Usually, at this point, either one of them would reach for the remote controller, but neither does.
Utter nonsense, the lot of it.
“I… I don’t think you’re the only one who wouldn’t have had patience for long directions,” Sherlock panted above him.
So John turns on his side, and very slowly raises his hand to Sherlock's cheek.
John wasn’t all that hungover the next day. He hadn’t been all that drunk. But he was still consumed with a vague but unmistakable feeling of guilt, the sort he usually only experienced after an epic bender, when he didn’t quite remember what he’d done, but guessed he had some pretty serious apologising to do.
Work is shit, his family (such as it is) is shit, his home, filled with relics of his failed marriage and his dead baby, is shit - everything is shit. Everything except coming home in the evening and finding Sherlock there, silent, dependable and slowly (did he imagine it was happening subtly?) turning John's (Mary's) kitchen into a make-shift lab. And then going to bed with him.
“Well,” said John. “No. But neither did you.”
John sighs.
“No, it’s just us,” John started to say at the same time Sherlock continued: “Because I can leave, I’ll just…”
"It matters," said John, perversely glad that Sherlock finally seemed to be taking an interest, "because we all have an image. We are all our own creations, and don't tell me that you, of all people, aren't aware of it, Mr. One-liner. Don't tell me that you are ignorant about how we portray ourselves. I live with you, remember. I know all about your hair products, how much time you take getting dressed, how much you spend on your look. I've seen you put on masks for all sorts of occasions, Sherlock. You know that these things matter. The message you choose to send out about yourself. It matters."
He grits his teeth.
“A Secret Santa. Where everyone brings a gift and then we draw lots when everyone’s here. It’s fun.”
“Yeah, well, I’m not baking Hobnobs. So, do you have an opinion?”
“Yes, I’ll make sure to mention this aspect of the matter in my next email to the foreign minister, but as of now there is no news. I will let you know when there is.”
And yet Sherlock seems overjoyed.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"I'll call a cab." And Sherlock sweeps through the house, gathering up a surprising amount of things that have somehow migrated over to John's home in the last few weeks. And then he calls the cab.
"He was
He had to make this right.
Sherlock huffs.
This is the longest conversation they've had since Sherlock came back. Maybe it's the darkness, maybe John's unusually mellow because of the meltdown - he isn't sure.
John Watson. Even on his worst days he can provide simple, practical insights that Sherlock never would’ve reached without him.
that get each other off in airplanes. He always knew that if they ever crossed this line it would be so that they could move from “friends” to “more.”
Sometimes he misses his old self. Things were simpler, before the Fall and everything that came after. There were so much fewer factors to consider.
He wasn't even sure what he meant by that. Sherlock didn't even deign it with a reply.
b) How would one go about figuring out if said Sherlock Holmes is interested in said level, and if he isn't, if he'd take offence when John put on the moves?
Would they be looking for a flat as... Friends? Colleagues? Something different? And what, if (as once before) a landlord would ask them if they "needed" a second bedroom. What would they say? What would Sherlock say?
(Sherlock seems to have taken his advice to heart and has given completely up on being considerate. Has, in fact, also given up on being civil, so John orders something Indian without consulting his new flat-mate.)
“Consequences from… Santa Claus?”
He can even hear her silent disapproval of the cigarette he's smoking.
Sherlock makes tea while John carries his things upstairs. Within minutes they are both settled in their old chairs.
"I don't suggest a thing!"
happen. At some point.”
So now he's hiding from John.
And then the call was cut off.
“Yes?”
His nose is almost in Sherlock's neck, his arm almost fitted around him, his hips pressed...
“You’re quite safe.”
That seemed enough for Sherlock, who allowed his eyes to flutter shut and seemed asleep in seconds. John rubbed his temples on his way out to the kitchen, and wondered if he should be calling Mycroft. John
John tightened his grip. “So which is it, Sherlock?”
“John?”
"That we're married, apparently."
Thankfully, this detachment spares him the roar of pain and anger. He doesn't blame himself. Not really. Not enough to break through the apathy.
It's shock and joy and shyness all wrapped into one, making it impossible for John to do anything other than shifting until he can wrap his lips around it, flicking his tongue over it while Sherlock makes shallow gasping sounds again and again.
Obviously - in retrospect. Lots of things became obvious, when the last agents in Moriarty’s network used their final efforts to produce mass-panic with that little broadcasting stunt.
"Oh, Sherlock, stop. You know this sort of thing doesn't work on me. I know you're curious. I know this is something you're willing to listen to. You've always been willing to stop to consider John."
It’s easier, that way.
He spends the whole evening moving from cafés to bars and back again.
She smiles sadly at him. But there is also something unpleasant in her face, condescending.
He couldn't just take Sherlock's hand.
Of course he told them that Sherlock was his husband. In this instance it was both a useful and relevant fact, and no need to feel shy around it. It was practical – and John Watson prided himself on being a practical-minded man.
He caught on and he joined John. And for several long minutes, they stood there, Sherlock still facing the wall, breathing together. Catching their breath. Calming down.
Sherlock didn’t say anything and John couldn’t read anything off his face.
But when John’s face moves closer, Sherlock tilts his own upwards. Their eyes finally meet again and Sherlock tries to make sense of what he sees there – but Sherlock has never been good at this sort of thing. He still isn’t sure what John’s motives are. Revenge? Possibly. Frustrated arousal? Probably. An urge to allow something to happen that has been in the pipelines for years but could never come out – not until now? Maybe. Sherlock doesn’t know.
"People get
This annoyance, however, was starting to go far beyond his very generous limits.
Typical. Just when John thought his wedding couldn't have been more fake, it turns out that the maid of honour was the sister of the generation's most twisted criminal mastermind.
He dropped the slipper on to the sofa table. The sound was loud in the silent flat.
And John could see it coming a mile away. The words gave him fair warning, the fingers that slowly inched under his button-up, the lips that carefully moved closer, all giving John all the time in the world to move away.
That is a fact that is a bit confusing and a bit disturbing and more than a bit arousing.
The hand on John’s arse certainly wasn’t motivating him to get up and move anywhere, but he still struggled to his feet, tugging Sherlock with him.
“John,” Sherlock grabbed John’s wrist like a vice. “John, you must believe me. It really wasn’t a scheme. I didn’t know! I know you think I always know everything…”
This gets his attention.
"Does he know that you're about to disappear?"
It doesn’t seem fair.
His hesitation makes it clear that the word "fired" lingered on his tongue.
Thanks, Ella.
Sherlock looked up at him, his face unreadable.
"What? Worried it might be bad for the baby?" He allows himself a little eye-roll.
"It doesn't bother you?"
He's gone to the grave, a couple of times.
When he gets home again that day, having removed three generously sized warts, and been puked on once (by an eighty year old woman – the nurses do their best in sparing him the children. “Considering.”) he is thoroughly unsurprised to find Sherlock on his sofa again.
Sherlock snorted.
But is there something else at work?
"Obviously," Sherlock agrees. (From
Also the slight swagger, usually displayed by men who have recently been assured of their sexual magnetism.
They'll be fine. They'll be just like they were before. John will move back in, they'll solve cases and John will blog about it. And soon Mary will be nothing but an unpleasant memory.
John blinked.
"The horrible place actually pays our bills."
Of course John wanted to know. He needed to know how this stood. He needed to get his friendship with Sherlock back on track. He felt like this travesty of a marriage was keeping him from focusing on the future, like he was stuck. And pretending it wasn’t there wasn’t proving as easy as it should be.
Like when standing next to Sherlock on a crowded tube. Or just sitting next to him on the sofa. Or when he's in the shower, idly considering having a wank and an image of Sherlock pops into his head. Making the idea of a wank no longer idle.
John has started to feel the urge, occasionally, to touch Sherlock. To place a hand on his back to guide him somewhere, or to sit close to him on the sofa, or (for crying out loud) to glide his fingers through his hair.
And then his mind goes blank as the orgasm tears through him.
I'm not a native English speaker and I did not have a beta for this piece, so I'm fairly sure there are several mistakes in the text. I'd be very grateful if you'd point them out to me.
John knows he still has miles to go.
John is glad Sherlock's smiling. He's glad they're having fun, that they're enjoying this together.
But he does want Sherlock's cock.
John is smiling and making sushing noises, encouraging slower movements and more languid kisses. But Sherlock doesn’t care – he’s almost certain he can talk them out of an indecency arrest, although it would obviously be an unfortunate complication. But if this is the only time he can have this, then he damn well will. Because it’s been
They're pushing forty and the sofa is a bit shit. Okay for watching telly, but not much good if you want any real kind of sleep. So John briefly considers blowing his fuse and ranting about personal space and so on and so forth, but in the end he decides... not to.
Right.
They break apart, carefully, and Sherlock knows that everything he feels for John Watson is written on his face. He is completely vulnerable at this moment – there’ll be no preserving his dignity after this. They won’t go back to pretending. John now holds all the cards.
“The inevitable destruction of Christmas?”
Sherlock feels like he’s been running for days, for weeks, ever since his release from custody. But right now, in John and Mary’s boring little flat, everything has ground to an agonising halt.
Could that be the reason Sherlock feared that John might think this mess had happened on purpose? Did he think that John would suspect him of trapping him in a marriage (
Maybe
Looking around the living room in 221B, nothing seemed to have changed. John was in his chair, Sherlock in his. There was fire in the grate and a whiskey in his glass. And yet…
“I said it's not an experiment. Not a proper one. Are you even sure you got a proper classical education as a physician, John? You should, even after all these years, retain even a hazy notion of what qualifies as an experiment.”
The problem was contained to mornings, at first. With his nostrils filled with Sherlock's smell, his skin touching Sherlock's sheets and often some part of him touching Sherlock himself.
And John had done these things before – or things similar to them. But he’d never really noticed it before. Not like this. And he felt sure that Sherlock was noticing it as well. He could see a faint blush on his cheeks when John helped him tape his cast before showering. He could feel him hold his breath as John supported him.
“… A what?”
If it was something really urgent, Sherlock wouldn’t have drunk himself into a stupor; he would’ve called John, would’ve put on an elaborate disguise and thrown himself into solving the problem.
He looks her properly in the eyes for the first time and slowly blows a cloud of smoke in her face.
"That's just about it, yes. Naturally, Mycroft had to fluff it up a bit for his superiors."
“Anything,” John gasped, “please, everything.”
John raised his eyebrows, waiting for more, but it didn’t come. Clearly Sherlock was going for baby-steps in this. Right. He stalked off into the kitchen.
Not after spending the last ten nights together.
And while he’s thinking this, on another, deeper channel of his mind, Mary’s words are running on repeat.
"Well, whatever - if
In fact, he had rarely felt more alone than he had in the two days since he'd learned that he'd been assigned a companion until death (or the barbarian lawmakers - whichever came first) did them apart.
Sherlock sighed and covered his eyes, as if the burden of technologically inept, social-media blind John Watson was just too much for one man to bear.
That didn't mean he wanted to rush it, though. He felt hyper aware of his senses. The feel of the slipper in his hand, the slight of the nape of Sherlock's bent head, the all-encompassing smell of cookies in the air.
That part doesn't FEEL like shit. It feels like the only thing that keeps him going through the day. But - shockingly - upon this closer examination it is turning out to be shit just like the rest of it.
He pulled back from the kiss, and Sherlock responded by drifting down to his neck, kissing, licking and biting until John’s knees threatened to give out - and John wasn't even the one recovering from devastating injuries.
Only this wasn’t anything like that. That had been so much worse. That had been broken trust and PTSD and Mary and all sorts of mess. Now – now everything was
John snorted. He could think of a few behaviours Sherlock would surely avoid if John’s annoyance was such a thorn in his side.
"Not as such, but yes. He has people to answer to, procedures to follow. Sometimes. And he needed to make Janine seem a bit more dangerous than she really is."
“Anyone what? Anyone I’ve slept with? Anyone I’ve wanted to sleep with? Anyone I’ve…loved?” Sherlock, however, didn’t seem to share John’s qualms.
But conversations like the one about A.G.R.A. are a must. They can’t be avoided. The one about drinking on the way to Morocco – well, it can be avoided for a bit longer. Maybe John will sleep on the way. Maybe he’ll stop after three. Maybe they’ll have time for a kip in Morocco, before Mary arrives. Three drinks is okay for now, if that’s all there’ll become of it.
It doesn't help. Sherlock stiffens, and John becomes very aware of the fact that he's practically standing in Sherlock's arms.
“I think you’ve had… that sort of relations on a much more feeble basis than a case.”
“Besides,” Sherlock said under his breath, “what's to say you'll still be here next year?”
“I think,” Sherlock finally said, slowly and deliberately, “I’ll pass.”
Sherlock doesn't know what she means by this. Is she trying to make him feel guilty about the Fall and all that came after? And if she is - why?
And - John Watson is not gay, a small part of him points out from the back of John's head. Not gay at all. Does not want to "come out" to Harry, goddamn it, does not want Mycroft as a brother-in-law, does not want to deal with Mrs. Hudson's squeals of joy, does not want to be known as Dr. John Gay Watson to all his friends.
John was never one to deny himself something delicious. He took careful aim with the slipper and hit Sherlock right where his thighs met his arse, no doubt making his blood flow to all the right places.
Sherlock tries not to deduce things about John’s love life – it’s better if he doesn’t – but even Anderson must have realised that John has sensitive nipples. Sherlock's explorations of John's sides and back must, eventually, lead him there.
"Good God, are you still here? Don’t you have somewhere to be, some people to kill?"
Sherlock’s eyes fix on John’s and he can feel his insides turn to liquid.
Tries not to wonder if it’s all over now - John’s happily ever after.
Brilliant.
"Afternoon," John said.
"So she might have? Evicted you?"
When John returns Sherlock is ready to play best friends again. Like this never happened.
Something was wrong. And he had a feeling that a sober Sherlock would be even less informative than the drunk one.
What could he possibly say?
Well, no. Obviously it wasn't.
Granted, Sherlock hadn’t been the most accepting of John’s girlfriends through the years.
"But...?"
Her smile is understanding and pitying in equal measure.
"What do I need to do to make you leave? Aside from pushing you." He allows his gaze to trail down the roof and to the busy street below. "And trust me, I'm considering it."
John is a doctor. He knows they are normal. He knows he should be
"Come on, John, we're leaving."
“Why would you want to get married to me if you knew we wouldn’t be able to divorce?”
"Well, you'll get us sorted, right?"
He's not sure why he isn't able to.
"See, Sherlock? This is why I need to tell you these things. Because you can’t tell the difference from being in a relationship or turning yourself into a housewife. Because you… You’re not good at this, are you?” She smiles at him, almost ruefully. “You can’t just barge in and try to be friends with benefits. He needs more than that. He needs a relationship."
He knew that maybe if he used a timer this might work, but Sherlock never used a timer; people
“Well, stop it. This is a nice party, the walk home will be lovely in the dark with the lights and tonight is a
His baby is dead. A daughter. Killed mere hours after Moriarty appeared on the nation's television screens. By her mother's hand.
This fits. They fit.
Sherlock had the nerve to seem amused.
But maybe John doesn’t kiss anyone else like this.
John.
John's heart aches at the sight, and that is bad.
It was painful, but it wasn't the most painful thing that had ever happened to him.  He looked at it as it burned away.  Sherlock squeezed the water out of his coat as well as he could, and then laid the coat out flat on the roof.  Los Angeles was very warm for December, and Sherlock pondered what he would do next.  He turned to check the height of the sun, and there was the man in the suit, the overly-symmetrical man, standing just a few feet away.
Sherlock tried to avoid looking over his shoulder for now, and made a circuit of the cemetery.
The water woman was still there.  It didn't look as though she had attempted to stab him, either.  Definitely one up on other places he'd slept.  Sherlock fished through his pockets to see if his phone had come back, and so it had.  It was working and didn't appear water damaged.  He noticed that Lestrade's ID also looked different now.  This ID was now good until the first of January, 2019.  Lestrade was much greyer in the picture, and was smiling less.  And there was now a red and blue guilloche pattern printed all across the identification, picture included.
"John! Call off your dog!" said the man as he wobbled and stomped around the kitchen, trying to shake off the dog.
The woman was glowing a bright gray with every word she spoke.  Apparently the gray aura was caused by thinking something was true rather than by it being true.  He himself glowed blue for most of the conversations he had these days, with all the lies he told.
He would beg, then.  "You just keep that somewhere, and in exchange for you holding it, when a reasonable amount is gathered up, I'll take it to a currency exchange and trade it in for American money and then give you half."
Sherlock woke one morning to find a passport and airplane tickets, in the name of Robert Johnson, in the pocket of his greatcoat.  Easy enough to remember, he supposed.
"Would you hold this money for me?  I can't keep it in my pockets overnight.  I'll split it with you 50/50."  This was appalling.  How did he even talk to people when he wasn't high?
Sherlock didn't even reply.
She, infuriatingly doesn’t reply, but rather gives him one of her more patronising (is it bordering on pitying?) smiles.
"I mean - I need to move."
“Most people would be improved by being more like me,” Sherlock agreed with a tilt of his head.
He doesn't.
“No, perhaps not. Thera are, however, plenty of things that are within bounds for married people that we don’t usually do. Such as this.”
“Sherlock? Yesterday? You said...”
Not that John was all that concerned about getting to him at first. He was more interested in getting to find Sherlock in the A&E. And he didn’t even hesitate when telling the nurse that he was there to see Sherlock Holmes, his husband. The words came quite easily and unbidden. He brandished his ID at her, saw her look Sherlock up in the General Register to confirm their relationship, and then he was whisked off to see his partner.
Sherlock can’t help but wonder if this is the sort of kiss that John has long since perfected for first dates. Intended to reassure and excite in equal measure. The thought upsets him more than he would’ve guessed.
"Well, no, I imagine you two trying to get married in Saudi Arabia would have brought a host of problems, other than the one we're currently facing." Mycroft said.
Everything will work out fine.
As John sat there, alone, and listened to Sherlock’s door close, he felt like he had missed something important. And he had no idea what.
John blindly fumbled behind him, to reach Sherlock’s neck or his face – but hesitated as his hand was still covered with come. Sherlock’s left hand was quick, though, in grabbing John’s wrist and lifting his hand up towards Sherlock’s face. And while Sherlock gave John the best hand job he had ever imagined – his lips found John’s hand and licked it clean, finger by finger.
At least not if Rosie’s regular daytime nanny will be promised as well, making it possible for her to go to work.
"I can," John bites out.
“I’m sorry, your highness, but I kind of need to be close to you if I’m supposed to be at your beck and call.”
Sherlock licked his lips.
"Quite," said Mycroft with one of those half-smiles that suggested that there was more to the joke than anyone other than him understood. John hated that smile.
She ignores this. "He needs to feel appreciated. And important."
"I rather think," Sherlock muttered, "that you're overestimating your place in society if you're worried about your Times obituary, John.”
Stupid Mycroft.
"I've told you. I'll take care of him."
At least the risk of discovery – Sherlock has a feeling that there are all sorts of other risks here that might be much greater. But he is now far past the point of no return. The bridge is standing behind them now, the flames reaching for the night sky. The only way now is forward – wherever that may lead.
Sherlock said nothing.
Clearly he wouldn't bring her home to 221B, lead her through the flat, past Sherlock and up to his bedroom. That would be
He can hear her before she says anything.
"Yes, well. Things are different now." This time John has Sherlock. He has something to live for.
Maybe he should have a drink.
“True. His assistant usually buys them.”
should be the one tip-toeing around
And that - just that - has answered all the questions John might have had. Because now they're finally on the same page, and Sherlock does want what John wants and he can't help but smile like an idiot before he launches himself across the bed, flinging his arm across Sherlock's chest, burying his face in the crook of his neck, allowing his lips to caress the warm skin there.
“Sherlock, she was almost your ex-fiancée. Ex-lover, at the very least.”
He was rewarded with a whimper. This time there was no doubt about it, sherlock arched his back into the blows, offering up the underside of his bottom.
Sherlock has been dozing when he’s jerked awake by John’s hand on his thigh.
His skin is white and smooth, reminding John of the years he spent as a drug addict, but underneath are the muscles Sherlock has built up practising various self-defence methods, chasing criminals around London.
The one thing John does know is that he doesn't want to lose Sherlock. All choices must be made with that in mind.
Sherlock didn't say anything. He didn't meet John's eye.
It wasn’t.
He gives an incredulous huff.
"What...Why are you upset about this?"
"Well, the matter came up a while ago. There's this Russian couple that's been trying to get divorced for two or three years."
"Mycroft?" Sherlock said. "You promised you'd tell him. Because this is your fault."
Carefully and almost reverently - breathing fast like he did in that stupid wardrobe - he finally (finally!) leans down and kisses John.
"Mycroft, get on with it," Sherlock said through thin lips, his eyes still fixed on something John couldn't guess what was outside the window.
He feels like this should be an even more of a shock than it is.
He picked up his phone and went for the Sudoku app and decided to wait it out. Sherlock should wake up soon and then they'd go back to Baker Street.
That night, he doesn't say anything as they go to bed, like usual.
"Sure." John liked it when Mycroft’s projects took them abroad. Suicide missions to Eastern Europe aside.
Sherlock’s breath was slow and unlaboured. He wasn't unconscious - not properly. Just asleep. And drugged. He had broken a few ribs, his left arm and had a huge gash in his thigh, but his head was remarkably unscathed. (John couldn't help seeing him fly off the roof of St. Barts every time he closed his eyes, but he hadn't done years of therapy for nothing and was able to dismiss the phantom. Until he next closed his eyes, that was).
"Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you that the idea for that particular trap was entirely Sherlock's," said Mycroft while inspecting his nails.
“Sherlock?” he rasped. “I’m going to… I should probably tell you that this is kind of the point of no return, right about now. This will change things. I’m …”
It's intolerable enough that she's had her hands all over John Watson. It's utterly insufferable to be constantly reminded of her exploration of areas that remain a mystery to himself, but her insertion of herself in those private thoughts is perhaps the worst of all.
Something changed in Sherlock’s face, when John said that.
Mary’s vow was null and void from the moment it left her lips, a false name on her tongue.
It takes John several minutes to stop shaking, Sherlock holding him all the while.
John moved his lips right up to Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock complied at once. He was wearing his dressing gown and, John guessed, not much else.
“Yeah, but I’d like your help.” John purposefully didn’t use the word family, but it was there, just at the tip of his tongue and he imagined that Sherlock could sense it lurking there.
He unearths a bottle of wine and gets going on the noodles.
God, this supposed emotional growth is tedious.
"Well, I was thinking short term, but either is fine."
"Really. So you did... Things with her. Knowing she was your arch enemies sister?"
He probably just did his thing in the shower, not thinking about anything in particular. His body was, after all, just transport.
“Good, you’re here,” John said. “Tea’s ready.”
His overwhelming sense of relief when John slides back into his seat and does away with the armrest between them is slightly embarrassing.
"Which is
He's working through his issues. He talks to Ella about his marriage. And what it does to a person with trust issues to find out that their spouse is little more than their imaginary friend. And he's working on his feelings about his daughter (although he politely declined Ella's offer of finding him a support group).
Maybe Mary would even agree. Actions must have consequences. She abandoned John, she drugged Sherlock – she went behind her words. Maybe she’d even agree that she has no claim on this moment.
"I get it," she says after a while, “that you're not ready to talk about this to other people. But, Sherlock? You
Mostly, he's been picturing everything like it was. There's comfort in that. Almost like they can rewind, and go back to the way things were before the Fall. Take-out on the sofa, joint grocery shopping, arguments about mundane things. Crap TV.
"Do - do you mean long term or short term," Sherlock manages to gasp out, a smile playing on his lips.
“I knew you weren't,” said Sherlock quietly.
John thankfully hasn’t noticed Sherlock’s distress. He’s busy winking at the stewardess, who is certainly aware what they’re doing, but willing to overlook it for a smile like that from John Watson. She winks back at him and places a finger on her lips to indicate that if they’re going ahead with this they’d better be quiet.
"Cheers," John raises his glass and Sherlock returns the gesture.
Sherlock didn’t move.
John wonders, then. He wonders about his friend, as he hasn't allowed himself to wonder about anything for months. He wonders what Sherlock is thinking when he comes into John's bed every night. He wonders what he does in the day. He wonders about Moriarty and the work and 221B.
It had taken Sherlock some time to realise that John was simply useless at this relatively simple task. After several lectures about how he shouldn’t be able to mess up tea-making, followed by John still messing it up, John had been forbidden to make the tea.
His mind raced unbidden to that half-forgotten kiss in the ice-cave.
"You don't have to wake up for another three hours," mutters Sherlock from beside him.
But John couldn't... He couldn't just pretend it hadn't happened.
And he is grateful to Mary for finally making her destination of Morocco known. Because leaving 221B finally broke the spell.
(John objected to that wording, as it suggested that he had at any point been either of those things. Ella said that this was standard phrasing in cases of people who'd thrown more than one cup of hot liquid within the span of one hour.)
Sherlock's fingers move, then. Just a tiny bit, but they were hovering around John's waist and now they move and John can't help his sharp intake of breath. And the fucking hip-to-thigh-situation has become utterly intolerable. John' closes his eyes and dips his head, accidentally (or is it?) almost resting his forehead on Sherlock's shoulder. Exposing his throat to Sherlock's breath. And John doesn't think he's imagining that it's become quicker still, where it ghosts over his skin.
Sherlock slammed a glass into the water-filled sink with unnecessary force, making suds fly everywhere.
Well. Obviously they would say that they bloody well did. Goes without saying. Clearly. John isn't willing to give up on his love life for a platonic love affair with his flatmate. He might be old and broken and defeated - but he still isn't willing to permanently give up on looking for love.
And the words might've sounded friendly, something between warm and casual, if that hand hadn't been sitting there, at the top of his thigh. Waiting.
John closed his eyes when he slipped his hand under Sherlock’s open shirt. All that warm skin made him feel dizzy. He could feel himself involuntarily jerk when Sherlock’s big hand mimicked the motion, and an electric current ran through him. His breath was laboured and he was almost painfully aroused. He wanted to try everything, but his body was telling him that “everything” had better be achieved quickly, because time was running out.
“Oh, honestly. I can see you brooding from here.”
And then the Belstaff hits him.
"Oh, don't get all kinky on me, Mary," he says with an exaggerated sigh.
“Yup. A nice one. With mince pies and violin playing and a Secret Santa thingy.”
who…”
He was, he felt, getting rather good at tolerating Sherlock. Even Mycroft. After all these years he'd stopped blowing his fuse at the smallest annoyance.
“So, did you really? With Janine?”
Sherlock didn’t move for a bit. Then he stood, turning his face away, and said, “Yes. Why would you?” in a flat voice – and then he left.
"She doesn't count and you know it, idiot."
On John's desk there's a mug full of tepid tea.
Only… The dots didn’t make any sense. Why would Sherlock worry that John would suspect him of purposefully trapping John in a marriage they couldn’t get out of?
“Yes, well, as we know marriage doesn’t have to mean very much, does it,” John asked with a tight smile.
The bastard was lucky that Lestrade had him locked up before John got to him.
Sherlock looked up and squinted, like he was only now noticing John’s presence.
John is calling him. The phone is set to silent, but Sherlock watches the screen flash in the darkness of 221B. He does not pick up.
"You didn't tell them when it happened. Why should we now?"
"I don't think being a mess is something that improves by repetition," she says with a tilt of her head. "Rather the reverse."
… and yet he didn’t move away.
But Sherlock doesn't answer, but rather moves quickly, flipping John onto his back, looming over him with wonder in his eyes.
“We’re having a party?”
Sherlock has made a fool of himself. As was expected since this conversation began.
John can't be arsed to ask. People never tell him anything, so why bother asking?
“It’s just, that you didn’t deny it. Last night.” John is blushing furiously in the darkness. Why the hell did he start this conversation and why the hell isn’t he stopping it?
"I can't stay here," says John.
John felt dizzy with… He wasn’t even sure what he was feeling. Arousal, certainly (and he’d need to unpack that later). A surge of power was there as well. To be in full control of the most extraordinary person he’d ever met was as humbling as it was exciting.
"His sister? Really?"
"What have I told you about metaphors, Mary? Please leave them to the professionals."
"Well, that I've been married to a man. They'll
"The point is, Mary," he sighs, "that you need to go."
Which is most things, if he's honest.
And so it went. Step for step. Direction, compliment, another direction. Keeping eye contact for almost the entire time. And John didn’t do anything different from what he normally would do, he thought, but still, somehow, he ended up with a pot of tea that tasted like Sherlock had made it.
He leaves the break room to go find Olive but is intercepted by Sarah.
Not John Watson, it turned out. The dough didn’t rise and then the Youtube videos about how to actually make the naan proved beyond him, but they had some frozen ones that turned out okay when he put them in the toaster.
He just stood there, waiting for it to happen. His lips might have parted. His head might even have tilted upwards a smidge.
After what felt like a long while his heartbeat had steadied. He cleared his throat.
Sherlock grins, draws his legs under himself and ducks his head. "Oh, John, you wouldn't believe how clever."
And John could feel it, could feel how his entire world was at this moment ready to tilt.
He wonders how long she’s been lurking at the station just to make this supposedly grand entrance. He finds it a bit pathetic – and that cheers him up quite a bit.
Honestly – everyone agreed that his first marriage had been a royal fuck-up. Was it too much to ask that his second one would unfold in the manner it was supposed to?
. You are
That will do, for now.
Before Sherlock dashes off with his meeting with Mary, he tries to offer John some words of comfort.
Hopefully, he decides, this is simply a side effect of him not having had sex for months. That can seriously mess with your head (and John would know - he was in the army).
And he hated that he was thinking about it, he was thinking about watching naked men because of his conflicted emotions towards the man he lived with, and simultaneous thoughts about Sherlock and nakedness didn’t lead to anything good.
Sherlock is in his chair, across from John, his hair looking artfully tousled (his deduction about "Jim from IT" flits across John's mind. People who put product in their hair must be gay, indeed), browsing on his computer. Suddenly he looks up.
"I didn't mean in medicine."
“Sherlock, I'm sure the answer seems perfectly obvious to you - but indulge me.
“Sherlock, I am going to set some aims for this Christmas, okay? There are some basic things I'd like to achieve, and I'd prefer it if you helped me achieve them.”
“You are married,” he grits out between his teeth.
It had been there, that awful night. When John had cried in Sherlock’s arms and Sherlock hadn’t said a word. Only held him so tight that John knew that he’d stay for as long as John needed him to and then never mention it again.
So John tries not to think about it too much. It's rather disturbing and he tries to avoid things that are disturbing these days.
Sherlock, however, showed little surprise at the question. "Hmm?"
And it's good. It’s really good, and for the first time for weeks, John Watson is looking forward to waking up to a new day, more than he is about crawling into bed at night.
It's much too tempting to touch everywhere - John doesn't want to stop, he can't even focus properly on the way Sherlock is fluttering kisses everywhere, biting an earlobe, removing John’s shirt, feeling everything, cataloguing John with nimble fingers.
"I'll take that into consideration," Sherlock said and went to work on the filthy frying pan.
Once her movements have made him sure Morocco is the intended destination, he books the flights, helps John pack up Rosie and they’re off.
This must be written on his face, because all of a sudden they are both giggling like they used to. Years ago – when things were uncomplicated. And now – now
But he takes a deep breath and mounts the stairs. No use freezing his arse off out here.
“Yes?”
He was out like a light long before anything stirred behind Sherlock’s door.
But it did.
"I'm not gay."
"Mhm?"
"Sherlock?"
John isn't sure if Mary ever sat a nursing course, but she did have some skill in the area. Enough to make sure that Moriarty would never get near her child.
Damn, damn, damn and triple damn.
"Working with Janine?"
“Right,” said John.
"Shh! Someone’s coming. In here!"
But then he stops thinking about anything as chairs scrape floors and the possibility of any of those goons having a coat in the tiny little wardrobe in the corner of the room becomes frightfully real.
Sherlock doesn’t even know what Mary’s doing, after she's gone. Where is she going, which loose end is she planning to cut? Does she have some secret resources in Belarus that she needs to recover before the showdown? Does she have a mentor in America that she needs to consult? Has she sent Ajay a message asking him to meet her in Norway for a final confrontation?
“Anything I want?” Sherlock's voice was low and he didn't meet John's eye.
“Yes, we rather established that, didn’t we?”
John had probably never rolled his eyes as hard as he did the day Sherlock told him, that due to “unforeseen circumstances,” they needed to get married. Within a glacier. With a stuffed polar-bear in attendance, the ceremony officiated by a mumbling, bearded man in a primitive-looking robes.
He could feel Sherlock’s hitching breath where his back was pressed against John’s chest.
"Really? Obvious? So you knew all along?"
Obviously she's expecting to shock him, by suggesting… That. She's hoping for him to jerk his head up in surprise, to gasp to deny the feelings she's assigning him.
“You can choose your reward now, if you'd like.”
"You think I can pull it off?” Sherlock preened. “I've never been quite sure."
Besides.
feels completely uncomplicated.
John ached to touch him.
John has, to his surprise, started feeling it’s quite normal to wake up in bed with Sherlock Holmes.
And somehow that felt more intimate than even the most salacious sponge bath.
John hummed and nodded.
"I don't believe you," says John. “You're very clever, but not that clever. You just used her as a tool to get to Magnusson. You would've been much more interested in her if you'd realised she was Moriarty's sister."
How dares she? Sadness? How can she act like a devoted wife heroically admitting that her husband loves another, when she herself has never uttered a true word within their marriage? It’s absurd.
Damn.
But he's gone through it. The emotional growth, that is. It's been painful and constricting and Mycroft's obvious distain and amusement about the whole thing has been utterly insufferable, but the thing wasn't to be avoided.
"Do you think that's likely," asks Sherlock and John has to agree that no, it doesn’t seem likely. Although it will probably take a while to get the flow of baked goods up to previous levels, if he's been financially starving an elderly widow, maternal relationship or not.
He made fun of the chocolate chip cookies - and then proceeded to eat them all during the middle of the night.
Sherlock isn't so sure about that. John will be furious that he fell for Mary. He'll be furious that he's feeling hurt, in spite of everything.
Well. Divorce is the wrong word. He isn't sure if there is a word for what happens to a marriage where one of the participants turns out never to have existed.
John grabbed one of the kitchen chairs and slammed it on the floor with a loud bang when he repositioned it. Sherlock twitched at the sound.
He'd certainly been ready to react when met with outright defiance.
John stared at Sherlock's hand where it rested on the white sheet.
"What does it matter, John?" John jerked in his chair as Sherlock threw down his precious notebook. "What people
“Right. Okay. Um. That’s…good.”
“Well.” John was regretting this phone call already. He’d actually started regretting as soon as he’d punched in Mycroft’s number, but now he just needed to muddle through. “Well, you deal with…census data and such. Surely we all just want….we want official data to reflect reality.”
"Are you really... Do you really want to hear this?" Sherlock seems unsure.
And John rose to his feet and dragged his giggling husband to bed and figured that this would probably all work out absolutely fine.
John was not good at making tea. If he stood in the kitchen and watched the pot his patience would usually give out too soon and the tea tasted like hot water with a hint of tea. If he allowed himself to wander out to the living room to kill the time before pouring the tea into cups – well, then he usually got distracted and ended up with over-steeped tea, strong enough that you needed shovel it into your mouth with a spoon.
“No, I don’t,” said John cheerfully. “The best you can hope for is a bath bomb, really, and honestly, even if you do luck out and get one, odds are that Molly’s the one who bought it and it’s a glittery one.”
The pane he had grabbed twisted in his hand, and the other nearby shards of glass closed in and drew in the other panes, and wrapped around him.  They seemed to be connected to each other in some unseen manner, and to work in concert.  The panes turned themselves individually so their thin sides were pressed against Sherlock, and he got all cut up, as did his clothes.
He checked in, and as he made his way to his room, he looked into a rubbish bin in the hallway and picked a beer can out of it.  He took it back to his room to tear it up and make a shiv.  He wished he hadn't had to leave his knife behind in LA.
Less than an hour later there was a knock at the front door. It was Mycroft, his assistant Anthea, and two men carrying several cases of equipment.
"I have to kill you."
Sherlock had only a moment to feel triumphant before he felt the mark burning off his skin.  That definitely was more painful than any of the other marks had been.  Some of them he hadn't felt at all.  He thought he had heard some saying somewhere about the Prince of Darkness being a gentleman, but this seemed like the sorest loser of sore losers.  Sherlock twisted around as his skin burned.
"Eid al-Fitr."
He stabbed Mackler in the eye with his own gold blood drop.  It looked really strange in his lie-detecting vision.  Instead of a burst of fire, it went from blue swirls in the air, to entirely dark, like a film of an explosion run backwards.  It was the greatest outlier other than that repentant poisoner.  Sherlock gathered himself up off the floor, tested his foot to see if he could walk on it, and headed towards the stairs, and on his way back to the airport.
The woman reached for a bottle on a high shelf, one that did not appear to be commercially prepared, and had rather an orangish tint to it.  The bottle was dusty and was unlikely to have been prepared with him in mind, as he had only been in Los Angeles two days.  She poured him out rather a lot of the drink, and as he lifted it to his face, he considered what might be in it.  There was definitely alcohol wafting off it.  It seemed that the orange tint was from something hot, a chili pepper of some sort.  He took a large swig anyway, and smiled pleasantly before the heat kicked in.  He tried his best not to make an unpleasant face.  At least it wasn't a ghost pepper or a scotch bonnet.  He wished he had had a few cigarettes before this, though.
Father Philip led Sherlock down a hallway and past a rather homey-looking room with several chairs and a sofa in it.  There was an elderly Irishman in black trousers reading a newspaper on the sofa.
The man in the suit vanished in a puff of smoke and a flash of flame.
The last one was the one with the skin from the neck attached.  Clearly male with the beard hairs.  This was reasonably interesting, though.  This had to be a man who played American football.  He had once compared an assortment of sportsmen and bodybuilders by the trapezius, platysma, and sternocleidomastoid muscles.  It was almost impossible that it should be the neck of a man who went to a gym just for his appearance, or that it should be a man who had a physical job such as construction.
Father Philip turned to Sherlock and said, with a slightly more genuine look to his face, "Would you like to come talk in my office?"
He took her up on the offer.  Out back in the alley, he set his pocket items on top of an electrical box of some sort.  She made him hold up the coat so she could spray it, and the alley floor was disgusting, so he had to be sure not to let the coat sag too low.  There was a lot of side spray that got him, too.  After it had been rinsed and wrung out several times, he tasted it.  It didn't taste salty anymore, so he supposed that was as good as it would get.  The lady rolled up the hose.  "I'll get you a plastic bag to put your things in."
He hadn't felt any of the marks burn off him, so he checked.  They were all still there.  The right leg, and the ones on his chest.
Moriarty was still alive, had seen him fall, seen him die, seen him lose.  That was intolerable.
She said in a sort of strangled manner, "Sherlock?"
"So, what do you do?"  Pete asked.
Sherlock's thoughts whirled.  He must have him 'on the ropes'.  The man in the suit must have thought Sherlock had good odds of detaining the rest of the demons, or he thought that having Sherlock would be worth leaving the rest roaming around free.  Well, Sherlock, for one, was not letting Moriarty come back to the same Earth John still walked, or letting John walk around unshriven for longer than necessary.  He might've agreed unknowingly to such a deal before he died, but now in his 'sure and certain' hope of an afterlife, it needed to be taken into his calculations.
"Well, there is an old tugboat at the number four pier.  I always hate going by it.  I don't know why.  There could be something there, maybe."
"Hello, Mycroft?"
It was a Saturday afternoon.  The streets were certainly crowded, but the office buildings were deserted.  It was the work of a moment to get around the single security guard on the ground floor of Mackler Securities.
Sherlock waited until the tank circled behind a passenger-car-sized concrete block in the parking lot, and lit the Molotov cocktail on fire.  He ran quickly to the tank and threw the little bottle at what appeared to be the air intake, but the bottle burst with a flash, leaving only a black singe mark on the tank's side.  He retreated behind the concrete block and waited, but it appeared to have had no effect at all.  Looking down, he saw that the rolled-up bills had melted into a cold black lump.  He really must complain to Mycroft about the burn time of the currency.
Sherlock had thought he might look over his usual online demon study materials today, but his phone was dripping wet, and wouldn't turn on even briefly.  He sorted through his mind palace, reviewing for anything he might have missed that would lead him to another demon.  He must've sat up all night, as he noticed the sun was shining directly into his eyes as it rose.
"Robert Johnson."
Anyway, in the end it accomplished what he wanted, and the corpse was taken away to the medical examiner's to begin a process that would end in the unclaimed remains being dumped into a mass grave with other indigent persons.  It was what she would have wanted.
Sherlock--the man who
Sherlock moved along as the light changed.  The convenience store was just outside the shadow of a freeway, and under the freeway was a lot full of wrecked cars, with some tents and tarps in amongst them.
John Watson sat in his armchair at 221B Baker Street, his newspaper in his lap. The headlines didn't hold the same interest for him they used to have, and these days he hardly ever found himself thinking, "I wonder if Sherlock's seen this article?" Still, not a day went by he didn't miss the man.
Sherlock turned away from Mycroft and looked at John. He lifted the bow and set off on a much nicer piece. Mycroft flicked his eyes over to John. John looked back at Mycroft. "I don't know this piece, but it sounds like something he'd play."
Mackler retreated back into a windowless room.  It was a conference room that had apparently been droneproofed to keep corporate spies away.  Sherlock concentrated again on his more metaphysical truth-detecting abilities, besides his expert-level listening skills and senses of proprioception and touch.  There was a clear blue glow in the room, but the blue didn't reflect off of the walls like a normal light would.  Sherlock felt his way around the edge of the conference room with one hand, as he walked around the large central table.
"Oh, really?  I'm with the RCMP.  What is it you're interfering in?  Divorce case?"
For a moment they circled each other, then the demon tried to tackle Sherlock again.  Sherlock got out of the way this time, and the demon hit the sidewalk.  The demon dug his fingers into the icy sidewalk, and pulled up a large, pointy shard of ice.  Sherlock came at the demon from the side, and got ahold of his wrists before he could turn the weapon on Sherlock.  Sherlock shook the demon's arm as hard as he could, but he couldn't get him to let go of the piece of ice.
"Even I, knowing what I know, can see that's untrue."
"Well, my parents liked traditional names."  They walked out of the bakery together and down the sidewalk.
The blonde woman marched along beside him as he looked at her, and thought about what he should do.  She gestured down a side street, and hopped a fence into the fenced-in yard of a single story house.  He somewhat cautiously followed her, but she didn't attack him as he leapt the fence, or do anything else aggressive.
John nodded. He wasn't quite sure why Mycroft was looking at him, but he would've sworn Mycroft looked convinced now, convinced and somewhat upset.
Sherlock carefully observed the assistants and Anthea as they laid down the equipment on the tables in the living room, his eyes flicking from place to place, but when Mycroft sauntered in, Sherlock focused on him.  If these two men weren't brothers, there was certainly a similarity about the mouth as they met each other's eyes.
That would probably be a bad thing to get in one's eyes, especially seeing how it had ended for all the other demons Sherlock had run into.  He squeezed his eyes shut, and did his best to peel the glass pieces loose from his skin.
It was mildly concerning that the demon seemed to be following Sherlock's train of thought right after he thought it.  This tank demon wasn't psychic, was he?  Did telepathy exist?  This would definitely make killing him off a more difficult proposition.  And he did get out of the way of that key squash ball awfully quickly.
The man who usually wore a suit followed along with him, step by step.  Sherlock passed through the plane of the gates, and a moment later, the other man also came through.
Sherlock vaguely heard the priest offering him a bus pass as he stood up and walked back out of the rectory.  He crossed back into the church to cut through it to the street.  Where had those cracks in the linoleum tile come from?  They looked like very heavy footprints.  The footprints of someone who walked like him.  Exactly like him.  He crouched down for a better look.  There was a loud crunching sound under his feet.  He stood up again and saw that the tiles had split under his feet.  Perhaps he should get outside sooner rather than later.
A creature came out of the darkness and took Sherlock's hand. The creature had a human shape, but was entirely covered in gray, ratty feathers, which appeared to grow out of its body. Its hand was dry and porous feeling, like clay soil, and the creature had a very firm grip. Sherlock thought he might've actually preferred Moriarty's hand. Reddish clay clotted the feathers of the creature's face. Sherlock couldn't see the creature's eyes. Perhaps that was for the best. Sherlock looked back over his shoulder as the creature dragged him into the darkness. Moriarty had his mouth back, and his grin back, and the other man in a suit was whispering into his ear.
After a few more words here and there, the man in white and gold ceremonial garb posed for a picture with a couple of adults and a baby.  He told the couple he would meet them at their house, and then he walked briskly over to Sherlock and asked, "Can I help you?"
"I'd be delighted!  What time is good for you?"
The little terrier next to John's chair stood up facing the door and started to growl. "Bobby! Stop that!" There was no one on the stairs; John would've heard them. Bobby was getting even more worked up. He started running back and forth in front of John's chair and alternating his growls with barking. "Bobby! Bobby, stop that!" John pointed at the ground as he reprimanded the dog. Bobby ran behind John's chair and started whimpering loudly. John leaned over the back of the chair, and saw that the dog was piddling on the floor. "Bobby, what's wrong with you?" He stood up to get a towel and the spray. A person stood between John and the closed door of the apartment. It was a tall man in a long, dark coat. "Excuse me-" John started to say. The man was thin and pale with dark hair, and light eyes. He looked just like Sherlock-just how Sherlock had looked in life.
"Mary was close to Moriarty for years. But in the end, obviously, she had reason to suspect he wouldn’t be very pleased with her. That he might wish to take out revenge.”
“I’m sure it wasn’t.”
"And... And Mary? Do you know anything about…?"
"To be fair the siblings of arch enemies are often exemplary human beings," Sherlock says with a twinkle in his eye. It takes John a second to realise that he's referring to Mycroft.
my fault. I know you have a high opinion of what is and isn't under my control, Sherlock, but the finer details of law-making of other nations, broadly speaking, isn't."
No, John snaps at one of the nurses. It's something innocent - he's not even sure what sets him off. If it's her alluding to the sad demise of his wife (she's one of the ones who sided with Mary during the long weeks when they weren't on speaking terms. She doesn't believe John ever deserved her or deserves to be upset at her supposed death) or if it's her clumsiness, her poorly dyed hair or her frankly annoying shirt.
“It’s for sex, Sherlock,” John ground out. “Not to find the love of my life. If they are cheating on their husbands that’s their problem – not mine.”
for tax reasons, Sherlock. They don't get married because of them."
“I could always remote control you,” Sherlock said with a small grin. He looked devastatingly beautiful in the light from the street, hair in disarray, a hint of blush on his cheeks.
"Probably?"
“Right,” said John. “Just couldn’t think why you’d be here, except to tell me that someone had. Died, that is. Shower, then.” He points to the towel that had landed on the sofa, next to Sherlock.
But still - it's good.
This got away from me and I was unable to reach the smut in just two chapters. I remain hopeful for the third one ;)
“So, do you think, you might need – I don’t know – maybe some… Help? To work that out?” Why, oh, why doesn’t he stop talking?
He moves a bit and puts his hand on Sherlock's arm, to steady him. (John might be royally pissed at Sherlock, but not enough to want him to go through a silent panic attack. Especially one that might actually get them both killed).
“Right,” John said. “The five things. Number one: Ugly Christmas Sweaters.”
The next morning John had a nice lie-in and then put on a brand new pair of holiday socks, shrugged on his dressing gown and made his way downstairs.
Sherlock doesn’t see. Not at all. But he has no idea what else to say.
"Be careful."
Thank you for reading! I haven't written any fanfic for a while but I had enormous fun combining all of my favourite tropes in this little fic :)
Sherlock didn’t move.
"... The small omission in the law regards the divorce of foreign nationals."
Sherlock is clearly dying to talk to John.
… And so much he wanted to try, now that he had realised that he could.
"And I KNOW you're interested in ritualistic executions. Who isn't? I thought you'd be pleased."
"I mean," said John between gritted teeth, "that nowhere in the civilised world is it impossible to get a divorce."
Sherlock was nowhere to be found when John made his way downstairs. Which was a bit worrying, as Sherlock could hardly be in a fit state for flouncing about London after the previous day.
- both giving and receiving, but never, ever during the first time with a new partner.
But there are nine minutes until the lights will come back on and by then they need to be clean and tucked away. And besides – John seems to be roughly 90 seconds from coming, which gives Sherlock a limited window of time within to experiment.
Mostly because he should neither be noticing John’s underwear nor his mouth.
"Don't act like you aren't interested, Sherlock. I know you like to suggest asexuality, but..."
He wasn’t there, and his gun wasn’t there, when some great big brute flung Sherlock, as though he was nothing more than a rag-doll, through a window and down two stories into a skip.
The suggestion (offer?) lingers in the silence between them.
In the afternoon he has an appointment with Ella, where he successfully deflects her questions about Sherlock by talking about dead offspring and imprisoned wives. Afterwards he emails Sarah to tell her that Ella has written him a note declaring him to be neither a threat to himself nor anyone else.
But if he felt disgusted then he might want to... Well, he might not want to go to sleep with John. Tonight. If he noticed (and how could he not) the state John was in, he might now be worried about his virtue when sharing a bed.
There is sadness in her eyes.
Ella was supposed to be a member of the educated classes.
Sherlock didn’t answer. Probably, if he had, the answer would’ve concerned bees somehow.
"Well, then you'd have bigger problems, wouldn't you?"
Sherlock licks his lips.
That’s not to say that John didn’t feel uneasy. He had a hard time concentrating on the television. His eyes kept sliding off his book. The Sudoku he only did when Sherlock wasn’t around to mock him seemed completely beyond him.
After Mary – after John moved back to 221B – he started drinking Sherlock’s tea again. Now, when Sherlock was injured, he felt irritable and frustrated whenever the urge for a cuppa came over him. Sure, Mrs. Hudson was more than willing to fuss over them, but it wasn’t the same. She brought up the tea when
"Oh, I agree," said Mycroft. "Quite barbaric. But my contacts at their foreign ministry assure me that they'll correct the matter at the earliest opportunity. It turns out that they've been aware of the problem for quite some time. It's all rather embarrassing for them."
An idea that could ruin them – and ruin him.
stepped in front of a bus, then."
There were two young men just passing Sherlock,  and one flinched and looked back over his shoulder towards where the man in the suit had disappeared.  After a moment he turned back to his companion, who was dressed identically to himself, in a white short sleeved button-up shirt, black necktie, and black backpack.  They continued on their way.
He searched his memory for anything of note that had happened in Los Angeles.  There was the girl who had drowned in the water tank on top of the Cecil Hotel, a hotel which had also served as a base of operations for serial killers Richard Ramirez and Johann Unterweger.  Sherlock looked up the address and route on his phone and began to walk.
Sherlock stepped hard down onto a road, and kept running.  He wiped his hands across his face again to check that all the glass was off, and then opened his eyes.  He looked back the way he had come, and he could see a human-sized shape running behind him, with some parts dark, some parts allowing the light through, and some parts reflecting the light.
The gold puddled out across the floor.  Sherlock leapt up onto the nearest desk.  The gold drool kept moving outward from Mackler's mouth.  There could not possibly have been that much material inside of a person, but it kept coming and coming.  The floor groaned under Mackler.  The gold drool was melting the carpet as it came, and giving off horrendous fumes.  The fire alarm started, and a couple of seconds later, rusty water started pouring out of the sprinklers on the ceiling.  As soon as the water hit the gold, a cloud of steam filled the room.  Sherlock ducked down and lay flat on the top of the desk, to try to stay underneath it, but the steam was scalding his skin. He felt the desk shift under him.
As he reached the furthest extent of his patrol, he heard an odd shuffling sound.  Not like a human or animal walking, and not like a mouse or rat running.  Sherlock stood amongst the tombstones trying to identify the noise.  It was definitely North of him, and sounded like it was getting closer, but he couldn't immediately identify it and had to sort through his mind palace and consider the topic.
The concrete was coming up faster and faster. It only took a few seconds. There was a horrendous impact. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't move. Everything was dark. As the pain began to register, he thought he heard John calling for him.
(See the end of the chapter for
His coat, that comforting weight, however, was torn to shreds.
They struggled, and Sherlock pushed the demon around so he was walking backwards towards Sherlock's coat.  The demon stepped backwards onto the coat, and wobbled, and Sherlock shoved him as hard as he could.  The demon stumbled backwards and fell onto his back, but he was up again in a moment.  But now Sherlock had a non-skid footing underneath himself, and he knew where to avoid stepping on the coat so as not to turn his ankle on the squash ball in the pocket.
The priest's face fell a little, but he tried to control it.  "Well, are you seeing or hearing demons?  Sometimes it can seem like you're hearing or seeing very strange things, but it's really just a chemical imbalance."
Sherlock looked down again and saw that the blue glow had dissipated.  He took a breath.  "Any other places you've heard about that might have demons?"
Sherlock could see quite a few layers of cotton clothing sticking out of the woman's collar, along with a hemp necklace.  Clearly the ecologist type of vegan.  He halfway paid attention as she went on.
"That works."
The glass man was crawling himself along the marble floor of the building by pushing each separate glass section against itself, not exactly a rolling motion, more like a sidewinder snake.  Some of the glass panes would lift up as others pushed, and he would move along in pieces, very low to the ground.  The movement made a scraping and sometimes a squeaking sound, and Sherlock wondered how all the edges of the glass hadn't worn smooth as beach glass from all the grinding along in that way.
The mass-murderer sort often thought that, and this demon seemed to be more of that ilk.  That sort of man refused to admit that he was personally offputting, but blamed everyone else.  Sherlock danced around the tank, yelling more things as they occurred to him.  It was easy enough to recall things people had said to Sherlock himself.  The blue light engulfing the tank sputtered and cycled, with some relation to what Sherlock shouted.  Then he really thought of a 'zinger'.  "No one will ever love you again!"
"You don't meet many Georges these days."
He was unimpressed by most.  They provided no quieting of the mind.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  One of his associates who had taken LSD had then proceeded to lock himself in the bathroom at the bar where the man's wife worked, a bathroom mirrored floor to ceiling on all four walls, and then go through a calisthenics routine, shouting that he himself would make an army entirely out of himself and take over the world for her.
Sherlock didn't have a knife because he had followed the posted rules on Greyhound, but it turned out no one checked at all.  He thought they had changed the rules after the beheading in Manitoba.  Sherlock pulled his money out of the money clip and started scrubbing the edge of the clip against the concrete pavement.  It was nowhere near as good as having a knife.
Sherlock considered that.  Presumably the demon hadn't done itself in, although there were certainly human murderers who would have done that sort of thing.  The pile seemed still now.  The shed wasn't exactly well-lit to start with, and the sun was getting lower.
Sherlock pulled his gaze away from John, who was standing on the far side of the street. Sherlock hoped this plan of his worked. He was almost certain to survive. It was the only way out of Moriarty's trap, for him and John and all of them.  He looked down at the ground, and tried to move his foot off the ledge.  Some absurd mammalian instinct prevented him from stepping off.  He could do this.  He would do this.  Sherlock gathered himself and leapt off the edge of the roof.
The woman put her hands over her face for a moment; she looked rather panicked.  He thought he looked like a typical human.  No one else had made mention of any devil horns or anything.  Yes, dozens of people today had passed him by with little note, at least after he had put his shirt back on.  Something else must be going on here.  The woman's breathing slowed somewhat, but she still didn't take her eyes off him.  "Don't worry about that.  Please, have some rum."  She gestured grandly towards the cash register area.
"I wouldn't go looking for a demon."
After about an hour and a half, the bus pulled up to its terminal, and Sherlock got out, wending his way amongst the pedestrians, who were much slower-walking than those in London.  The occasional crowd formed on a sidewalk in Los Angeles, but only right in front of the big tourist destinations.  New York had an actual City-sized crowd.  Sherlock had thought that it was just the bus terminal that smelled of urine, but on further consideration, the smell extended throughout the city.
Sherlock stood again.  There was nothing else he wanted more in any world than to see John saved.  He rammed the window as hard as he could.  The desk slid under him, and the window flexed, and a good third of the window broke off, and fell with him as he rolled out of the building into the air.  There wasn't much time to react, but he twisted so his arms and legs were under him as he fell, and then he crushed in the roof of a car, with the piece of glass embedding in the bonnet next to him.
"What's a zip code?"
The assistant with glasses took a tourniquet and some vials and a needle out of his case and moved toward Sherlock.  Sherlock tensed up and something about his posture shifted.  "You get back."
"You're a poisoner," he said.
"Is that like the zip code?"
As the ghost tank dissolved in a blaze of glory and Sherlock fell through to the ground, the last demon mark over Sherlock's heart smoked and burned.  It felt like the entire skin of his body was burning away, not just the skin of his chest.  Sherlock knelt on the ground, curled up.  That was the last one.  This mark's burning away hurt so much more than the rest of them had.  Surely he was burning all away, now that it was over, now that all the demons were retrieved.  He was so tired of fighting.  If he had any claim whatsoever on heaven, Sherlock would turn it all in, just to see John one last time, just to know John was safe.
It looked like it would be ridiculously expensive to get from the airport by taxi, and most other ways of getting around would require a credit card, so Sherlock took public transportation.  It was June, and despite how much further north New York City was than Los Angeles, it was much hotter in New York City.
He came around the corner of an open-walled shed and found the noise had stopped.  Instead of a herd of pigs, they were all in pieces, strewn across the pen, with the demon standing in the middle of the pen, covered in blood.  His fingers looked much sharper and longer than they should.  The demon looked right at him, said "Catch me now," and then spun in a circle.  As he spun, pieces of himself flew off at all angles into the pile of pig parts, and burrowed down into the pile.
The man stood with his feet apart, ready to react, and Sherlock said to him, "So, why would you want to cut off the left side of the face?"
Sherlock walked along the beach.  The trees came down very close to the shore, and it wasn't a sand beach, but gray gravel and rocks.  There were huge, twisted, bleached-out trees that had been washed up at the top of the beach during some previous storm.
"You're awfully wet, maybe I could drive you to a shelter?  I know for a fact they have empty beds at St Emydius."
The man stood up, pushing his chair back, and focusing on Sherlock with the gaze of someone who could see right through you, into your heart.  Yep, this looked like the man whose picture was in the lobby.  Sherlock kept strolling across the office floor.  "So how did you become a 'demon'?  Slave trade?  Car theft?  Crossing against the light?"
The man in the suit spoke again.  "You'll have everything that you had on your person when you died, and just to be a sport, I'll let you have your phone, too. You can receive any information you want, but you can't email, text, call, or otherwise interact with anyone you knew when you were alive, or you'll come right back here and your time on Earth will be over. And now, this young lady will show you the way back to Earth. I have one request before you go.  Just before you jumped off the roof at St Bart's, you promised to shake hands with Mr Moriarty.  I heard you.  Go on."
Soon the bus pulled up to a deserted rest area. There was nothing visible there except a set of truck scales and an unoccupied office building, and a restroom structure with a picnic table.  Sherlock hopped up and exited the bus.  "Sir.  Sir!" the driver said, "This isn't Barstow."
"Sherlock, if he knew how... How you feel. It would change everything for him. It would turn his world upside down. It would... It would give him hope and joy and excitement and all the things he'll need. If he's supposed to get through this."
“John, I'm... I'm terribly sorry to have to inform you, but Father Christmas...” Sherlock faked wiping a tear from his cheek. “He... He didn't make it. I'm sorry. The… It was the laws of physics that got him in the end. It was… It was ugly, I’m told.”
John feels completely at Sherlock's mercy with one hand in him and the other one wrapped around him.
“No, we didn’t,” Sherlock admitted and John didn’t quite know why he breathed a sigh of relief.
But he won't really try to stop her either.
Six minutes later John has been forcibly put back on medical leave. And escorted out.
He’s dreamed of this.
"So she was..."
"Yes."
For a moment they were silent together. Not like when they were reading or watching TV or doing housework - not silently co-existing, but silently watching each other.
“Hmm, let me think. Over the last few years the best Christmas I’ve had was the one where I got dumped on Christmas Eve and where our Christmas party was then interrupted by a trip to the morgue. Not a fun, work trip, but a trip where you knew the dead person personally.” John frowned. “Well, we thought you did, at any rate. And
Neither pre- nor post-nup was ever brought up again.
He wonders if she'll miss it.
"Well, it turns out," sighed Mycroft, "that the lawmakers of your hosts made a small clerical error."
“Indeed.” Sherlock eyed the cage standing on a plastic sheet in the corner. The pet otter that Mycroft had sent them for the holiday splashed happily in his abundant pool.
She scuttles off and he immediately regrets it. She might’ve been a way out of this.
But still.
“No. I don’t.”
The possibilities are endless, and the fact that Sherlock doesn’t actuallyknow Mary all that well is all encompassing. If he knew her as an agent (“polite term”) he’d have a better idea of her motives, her strategies. But he doesn’t know her. Not really, and that stings a bit.
kind of absurd that he didn’t even know what sort of porn his best friend, his flat-mate and his husband preferred. He didn’t mean in specifics, just in general, really.
“Can I…” he asked, as his fingers trailed towards Sherlock’s belt.
"Are you going to go?" Sherlock's face is impassive in the glow from his phone's screen.
And there was Sherlock, facing the wall, head bowed. Waiting.
"Shouldn't we? What if... I don’t know.” John gestured wildly with his toast. “What if I get hit by a bus tomorrow and the Times publish an obituary where it says that I'm survived by my husband, Sherlock Holmes? That would be a bit of a shock for Harry. And Mrs. Hudson would never forgive you for not telling her." He trailed off, because the thought of Sherlock alone in 221B, mourning for this hypothetically dead John, while avoiding Mrs. Hudson, brought back memories he rather avoided revisiting.
He did manage to register that this didn’t feel odd, though, and
"Goodbye, Mary," he says. Slightly stressing her assumed name, but not asking her for any other. It's the facet of Mary Morstan he's telling goodbye. He never knew any other one.
And that's intolerable.
“Well, in that case – wouldn’t it be simplest to put a trace on it?”
But he's holding on to John's fingers. Knowing... Knowing everything. About John and how he reacted in the wardrobe and how he reacts every morning and he’s still not letting go.
But it did.
Sherlock really has an excellent way of making John feel like a first class fool. If he’s going to urge Sherlock to seek therapy he probably should be focusing on his global murderous spree, rather than ex-girlfriends.
And he doesn’t feel out of his depth. This feels just right, Sherlock's body feels familiar and exciting at once and John's fingers and lips move over it confidently.
"Mhm?" Sherlock is buried in a local newsletter from Anglesey (in order to know a stupid amount of things, he needs to read a stupid amount of stupidly obscure things) and doesn't look up.
If John didn’t already know what serious trouble he was in, the relief that floods him at those words would certainly tell him.
"Did he have a close circle? Granted, I didn't know him very well, but he didn't seem like a trusting type. I'm basing this on our quality time spent with several pounds of semtex between us."
"No, you don't. You just said so. We need to move." Sherlock doesn't look up from his laptop, and really, when did he bring that? Has he moved in, without John noticing? What is his plan in this bizarre arrangement?
And he could list all the thoughts that came up in his head. About how this could ruin them, could ruin their friendship, how John had never done anything with a man before and might mess this up and how Sherlock was probably horrible relationship material and….
"Well, as Sherlock rightly points out, these are barbarians masquerading as a civilised nation,” Mycroft said with a curl of his lip. “I'm afraid I couldn't promise anything,” he added, somehow managing to convey a shrug without moving a muscle apart from his eyebrows.
"Don't be silly, Sherlock. You know I can."
“Yeah,” John whispered. “I’m sure.”
"Ah, but wasn't that the point?" She waggles her eyebrows, as if they're not discussing her incarnation for life.
He lights another cigarette and smokes it, resolutely not thinking about what she said about John.
,” John corrected. “Don’t forget the presents. Mycroft isn’t big on presents.”
John is standing up from his seat and Sherlock squeezes his eyes shut, retreating into his mind palace – maybe to figure out how the hell this went so wrong, maybe just to hide somewhere with Redbeard.
"Go away, Mary. I’m working."
John was unsure where to look – at Sherlock’s face or at the white strands that were coating his hand, it was equally mesmerising. Sherlock's knees gave out and he slid down the wall to the floor, next to John. The more part of John's mind that was prone to fussing suggested that this had probably been a bit much for someone in Sherlock's current medical state - but his very pleased primal brain pointed out that it was very unlikely that any lasting damage had been done and surely this had been worth a little discomfort. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock and leaned in for a long, lazy kiss.
