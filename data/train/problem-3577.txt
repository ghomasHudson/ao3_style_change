When he wakes up at three a.m. Dean isn’t in his bed. “Dean?” Finding his cell he calls him, no answer. Huh, he must have found a girl after all…
“No. I need some pants as well, and perhaps some pajamas.” He begins to sort through the sweaters again, and picks up a red one, this time it’s very big. Too big for him.
“God. You're so stupid sometimes. Bisexual is liking BOTH. Never mind stay in denial. Fine. Then go tell him you don't love him, because he loves you Dean. The guy looks at you like you created the universe and he knows the guy who did! It’s not fair to keep stringing him along like this man. I know it’ll hurt him but it’s for the best. And if you don’t love him then why did you mope around when he didn’t make it out of purgatory? Or cry after you kicked him out? Yes, I know about that, don’t even try to lie. Most of all why would you have stayed on that warehouse floor crying over his lifeless body confessing your love to him? You love him, just fucking admit it already. If not then let the guy move on with his life.”
"This is the song she would sing to us." Dean frowned at the thought, he missed his mother terribly. "Mary Winchester was a wonderful woman and mother, I'm sorry you two lost her so young." Sam clapped him on the shoulder "It's okay, I barely knew her, but Dean used to tell me stories about her before bed. She sounded like a great mom." Dean was smiling ear to ear, "You remember that?" Nodding he shrugged "Yeah, of course Dean. You did it until I was 10." They drove the rest of the way discussing mothers and how it was odd that Cas had never had a mother, but the closest thing to one he had was Anna and she was no mother. Finally arriving in Colby they pulled up to the latest vics house, grateful that Sam had suggest they ride in the fed suits.
“Okay. Hey? What was that thing anyways?” “Dunno, never could get a name for it, whatever it was, it’s long gone, I think it took Cas’s grace and when it did it exploded or something. There was a huge flash a couple miles back, I seen it through the window by the door.” Nodding Dean carefully lays down the fallen angel carefully. “Huh. Well anything that can bang up an angel that good isn’t something I want to mess with anyways, so good riddance.”
Seriously? Did he really think this was about a movie? He begins packing his stuff. “Go away Dean. I don’t want to talk to you. I’m just a burden to you and Sam. You won’t have to worry about me anymore.”
“Oh yeah, he kept in touch, I’m sure he would have been around more, but like I said my Mom wasn’t a fan so… But we would spend Father’s Day together and one time he was working on something in my town and I saw him and demanded he let me help. And ever since then I’ve been stuck in this ‘family’ business.”
from you. I meant what I said about loving you, but now,” A sharp pain was radiating through his chest and he didn’t know if he could say the next part. “Now. I need to love myself so that nobody else has to. And
Her blonde wavy hair flows down to her back, half of it is up in a type of braid, her jeans are tight and don’t leave a lot to the imagination. But her combat boots and the small blade he see’s peeking out of her boot says otherwise. Most people wouldn’t catch it, but Sam Winchester was not most people.
Still pouting he shrugged “I don’t know you took it away before I could see, but do you really think that I would be on porn sites now that were together?”
Despair and guilt racked his body and made him go rigid all over again. Was the answer that simple? Did he not look at the solution that was starting him dead in the face because he was dumb or because he was avoiding the conversation of what he was.
He leaned and closed the space between them, making their faces inches apart. It wasn’t unfamiliar. He had been this close to Dean before but never in this context. They both breathed heavily and Dean moved his hand to his neck slowly.
Dean pulled him close and put his arm around him. After shifting to drive he sighed happily and said “Let’s go home.”
“This. The feeling of being in your arms, close to you, so close to me that I can hear your heart beating. And so I can do this, anytime I want to” he says right before going to kiss Dean once more on the lips. At the last second he stops and unpauses the movie instead.
After Sam left the room, Cas chuckled and pulled on Dean’s hair, “You’re not having second thoughts are you?” He was scared that it would go back to being awkward and he hated conflict, all he wanted was Dean. In every way possible, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. “Hell no” was all Dean said before sitting up and pulling on his angels blue tie again to press their lips together. God this feels right, why hadn’t they been doing this all along? He felt a hot tongue press against his lips asking for entrance, “Mmf, wait. Cas I’ve never been with a man before, and I don’t want to hurt you.” The angel rolled his eyes, “I’m an angel, you can’t physically hurt me, and I have a clue of what to do so just stow your crap as you say.” He laughed, the angel had definitely picked up some of the Winchester’s sayings and habits. His train of thought went to Jell-O as he felt the angels chapped lips on his own. Cas tasted like honey and soap all in one and he loved it, as their tongues roamed each other’s mouths exploring. He pulled on Cas’s tie again and pulled the angel on top of him. He could feel himself getting hard and his jeans were starting to get uncomfortable. Moving his hands towards his belt he began to undo his buckle but before he could move any further he felt a pair of hands on his own. The hands swiped away his own and in an instant he was in his boxers as the angel hovered above him looking down with lust blown eyes. Dean moved his hands to untuck his shirt out of the dress pants the angel was always wearing, he removed his shirt, careful to leave the tie on Cas’s neck. Gracefully he began to move his hands down the angels beautiful body, God how had he never noticed how sexy this man was. And fit, he would have to ask later if the angel had been working out with Sam behind his back. He moaned when he felt Cas press his hand on deans aching dick, any longer and he’d cum right then and there. Before he could tell him to move his hand he felt his boxers being pulled off and oh god. He could feel the angel’s mouth pressing hot kisses up and down his thighs and sucking mark after mark on his flesh. “Ow.” Cas had bit his thigh and was stroking his dick with his hand. Precum was already leaking out of his dick. Suddenly there was a hot mouth on the tip of his dick licking his precum up like candy. “Fuck, Cas” he could feel a tongue lick up the underside of his dick down to his balls. “Don’t tease me-e. Shit.”  As soon as he spoke he heard a wet pop and his whole length was in the angel’s mouth. How in the hell is he not choking? Dean wasn’t exactly huge but he was eight inches and that was a lot to swallow. Damn his angel’s hair was soft as he ran his hands through the raven hair and pulled as the other man bobbed his head. His favorite hunter tasted amazing and Cas loved watching him coming undone as he swallowed the huge dick inch by inch again. Scraping his teeth lightly against the top of his favorite dick he lightly grazed the skin making the hunter below him shiver and shake. “I’m –I’m gonna cumm.” Not just yet he wasn’t, the angel had other plans for the hunter. He removed his mouth from the huge cock and smiled, as he undid his pants to reveal his own hard and throbbing dick. He moved the bowlegs aside and sat up to look in his favorite olive green eyes that were blown with lust. Dean was writhing and panting beneath him, he begun to suck on his fingers seductively. “We need lube” the hunter muffled above him almost cumming on the spot. In an instant Cas had found the proper lubricant and was coating his fingers with it. He placed one of the bow legs on his shoulder and began to lick around the rim before inserting a lube coated finger. Moving it back and forth, he moved back up to face Dean as he prepared that glorious ass of his to be pounded. Biting on his freckled thigh and sucking on the spot where he nipped the skin he added another finger and scissored them making his hunter lose his mind beneath him. Finally he found the man’s sweet spot and he loved having complete control over his favorite human like this. He gave a few pumps to his own throbbing cock before lining up to fuck this sweet ass, before he entered the tip he looked to Dean for conformation. “Cas if you don’t move I swear I-I” before Dean could say another word he was being pounded by the huge dick. He placed his other leg on his angels shoulder, he felt a mouth on his neck licking up his jaw line. Jesus Christ he knew what he was doing, mmff he pulled on the ink black hair to pull Cas’s face up to his. It was his turn to leave some marks, he kissed right below the jaw line and licked at the other man’s facial hair he had always found sexy. Kissing his way down the stubbly jaw he found was he was looking for and nibbled on the angel’s ear as he came all over them both. “Fuck me Cas that was amazing.” The angel pulled out and came on the chiseled stomach of the hunter beneath him. “I just did Dean.” “I- never mind it was a compliment but if you want to go another round feel free to saddle up, but this time you’re the cowboy and I’m the horse. I want to bend you over and choke you with your tie.” Cas simply laughed and got up, instantly Dean missed his warmth on top of him. “I’m going to hold you to that Dean.” He smiled because he knew his favorite angel would. He smiled at his angel, God his angel, he was completely and utterly happy. Cas pulled up Dean’s boxers and pulled on his own before crawling in bed next to his hunter. They fit together perfectly, this was where he belonged and neither of them wanted to leave, so they didn’t. All day long they stayed there watching TV and cuddling underneath a blanket. Sam only came in once to ask if they wanted some pizza, and he even brought it to them remembering what it was like to be completely blissed out like the couple was. He missed Jess so much and the last time he came close to anything like that was Amelia and she still didn’t compare. Sam left the room before the couple could see the sadness wash over his face.
Dean only chuckled, “No, it just means you’ve ate a lot of good food, it’s probably just indigestion. It’ll pass. Now then we’re going to watch a movie that
Sam was sitting at the large desk with his laptop on and a GPS map flashing on the screen. A red dot was moving on the screen. His face was creased with worry and exhaustion.
“I can give you a hand if you like, all it takes to kill one is the blood of a dead man, it works just like an axe to the head.”
“For one, only crazy people sleep on their back. Two, you don’t need that many pillows, I only grabbed em to be sure.”
After they beat Chuck with Jack’s help, he dove into how to win Cas back. The research they had done before to save Jack had disappeared and he was starting to lose hope.
“Dean. Hey. We need to go, that thing’s gonna come back-and” “Sammy he’s gone. I can’t leave him what if he comes back and I’m-we’re not here? Let that thing come back. Without Cas I-I” he begins to stutter over his words, and Sam leaves it alone. His brother has known how he feels about the angel for a while but now his theories confirmed, and he can’t leave him here to die alongside the angel. So, doing what he does best he stands by his brother’s side, protecting him at all costs. “Take your time Dean. I’m going to guard the door.” The only response he can salvage is a slight nod of the head.
Cas was still snoring heavily beside him, unaware of the chaos that almost occurred. It was funny that he was such a heavy sleeper when Dean was such a light one.
“Figured you might change your mind. If not, Dean here can drink it.” He nods and she is on her way to the kitchen.
“Right, well that’s about to change.” Turning on the radio he shoves a cassette tape into it and guitar strumming comes through the speakers.
Sitting with his arms folded Dean rolled his eyes at his angel, “It’s not nice to be nosey. And it was
Of course they tried their best to include him but it was futile to try. He watched cooking shows to pass the time, and had even tried out a few recipes. But no matter what he did, something was missing from his life. He knew and so did Sam. Night after night he would wake up in a cold sweat after screaming out for Castiel.
Waiting patiently on the bed, he raises his arms waiting expectantly for Dean to pick him up. “What did I say about not getting used to this?” “If I could find some strength to muster a sarcastic reply I would, but I can barely move Dean. Please?” Looking into the blue eyes of his best friend he can’t help but agree. Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s neck, and he lifts the angel’s legs up to carry him. “All aboard. Where to sir?” “The kitchen preferably.” “Right.” When they make it to the kitchen Sam is waiting expectantly sitting at the bar, with a smirk on his face. “What’s so funny?” “Oh, nothing. What’s for dinner? Also, can I get a copy of the schedule for the Dean Train? If you’re offering up rides, we could make a lot of money. A lot of people would pay to ride that train. Crowley especially.” If awards were given for the best bitch face of all time, Dean would win first place with Cas close in second. “Sam, while you may be too immature to understand, Dean is a good friend, and he is simply helping me move about, if you would like to offer up your services to help him, then so be it. Until then,
Dean slowed the car and gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was looking out into the distance and opening and closing his mouth a few times before finally saying, “I’m sorry. There was no other way… Maybe we can do some research to get it back, but Cas. I wanted to talk about what you said before..” He looked at him now, green eyes meeting his.
“You’re saying you don’t find me physically attractive… It’s okay. I understand.” It seemed reasonable that Dean would not be attracted to him in this vessel. And while he had grown attached to his body and form, he would do whatever he had to, to be with Dean. But it still hurt regardless.
Notes: I’m going to stop it there! Not because I like the cliff hanger but because I’m not the greatest at smut and it takes some ‘research’ to write it just right. Ha. Puns. Anyways, when it does happen I’m not going to be picky about ‘tops’ or ‘bottoms’. Personally, I think none of it matters as long as they get the “Dom” and the “Sub” right. For this work of fiction’s purpose, Dean is a ‘sub’ and Cas is a ‘dom’ but who cares right? Hope you liked this edition of Destiel Trash- From your local dumpster! (me)  *I know my notes are WAY too long. I don’t care. >=3 ;3
“So what? He didn’t know anything about sex, and he still doesn’t. Just go talk to him and tell him you don’t think it’s gross.
A tall blonde woman walks through in jeans and a red plaid flannel. “Oh. Uh sorry, I didn’t know anybody else would be using the Singer Library. I’ll go.”
“Good morning Dean.” He said walking into the kitchen. The smell of bacon drifted through the small room.
“Anything you want. A promise is a promise.” Cas smiled sweetly at his hunter before kissing him for hundredth time that day. Dean tasted just like all the hunter’s favorite foods combined into one flavor that was essentially all Dean.
Dean stirs beside him, “You okay?” “Yeah, sorry if I woke you up, I can move a lot better now, so I’m going to go to my room.” “You sure? I would’ve carried you there, but you looked so comfortable sleeping after the credits rolled that I didn’t want to disturb you. I only stayed because my rooms down the hall and I didn’t know if you’d need anything.” Rubbing his face, he nods and swings his legs over to the edge of the couch.
“My time with April was not the best part of being human at all Dean. I actually didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would, I was constantly questioning if I was doing the right thing. It was too awkward.”
Looking around he confirms that he is indeed in a bedroom, but is it Crowley’s? Upon further inspection he sees a mass portrait of the ex-cross roads demon hanging by the bed. “I still don’t understand why”
“Cas you awake?” He nodded into Dean’s back “yeah barely.” It was 6 in the morning and neither of them wanted to be up that early if they didn’t need to be. Dean however had woken up with something poking in his back and decided it was time to tell Cas about morning wood. “You have a boner, it woke me up.” Cas was so embarrassed he had no idea, “My apologies.” “Don’t worry about it, I’m going to show you what fixes morning wood” he said as he took off their clothes. He smiled maybe Dean would give him another ‘blowjob’ as he called it earlier. “You going to teach me?” Dean rolled over so he was straddling the angel, “I’m going to do more than that.” He could feel Dean’s hard dick pressing up against his own and he groaned at the friction it was causing. Pressing his lips against the angels he started to grind on him, and wiggling his hips he smiled an evil smile. “You shouldn’t tease me Cas, for future reference. I know what you we’re doing, and it wasn’t nice. Sammy was in the room next to us!” Cas began to laugh “I just wanted to speed things up, I’m sorry I won’t do it-t again. Please just move, touch me, do something.” Shrugging his shoulders Dean began to suck on the angel’s neck as he grinded on him harder than before. ”De-an” he yelled out. “Shh baby, don’t want people to hear now do we?” Fuck he didn’t care if the whole world heard him scream out Dean’s name, this felt better than anything he’d ever experienced. Feeling his skin on the freckled skin of the hunter was more than enough to send him over the edge. Scratching down his back as he was given mark after mark on his neck he raised his hips and began to roll them up to meet Dean’s. Hands left his dark hair and trailed towards his stomach before rubbing him through his boxers. “Fuck Dean.” Dean stopped sucking on his neck and moaned “Damn babe you keep talking like that and I’ll do whatever you want me to.” “Fuck me. Fuck me Dean. Please.” Defiantly he bit down on the scruffy jaw of his angel and smiled, “Careful what you wish for.” Removing the angels boxers he began to stroke his dick, before taking out his own and pushing the two together. He rubbed both of them simultaneously and it was driving Cas crazy to feel Dean’s dick on his. Never had he known that he was so big. The penis had to be at least 9 inches, and decided he wanted to taste it. Rolling Dean over him, he sat in his lap and licked his way down to the throbbing dick. When he looked up Dean had gone silent and was shocked with lust blown eyes, “Cas where the hell did that come fro-“ he didn’t finish his sentence because Cas put as much of the dick in his mouth that he could fit. What he couldn’t fit he stroked with his hand while bobbing his head and scraping his teeth at the sensitive skin. The hunter began to pant above him and his stomach was moving fastly up and down. Relaxing his throat he took more of him in and swallowed while moving his tongue as much as he could without gagging. Hands were working in his hair and made their way to his dick and began to stroke his dick, he was close to cumming and so was Dean based on the panting and moaning he was doing beneath him. Taking his mouth off slowly he licked the tip that was beading out precum, “You still want to take things slow?” Dean couldn’t compose a reply, just a muffled plea and so he began to lick his entire length before sucking on one of the hunters balls. “C-ca-cas!” “Cum for me Dean.” The hunter’s grip on his hair got tighter and he moved his mouth back up so he could take the load he was about to be given. Semen had a very weird taste, but he didn’t mind it. His own dick was fixing to explode from all the action Dean’s hand was giving it but he wanted more. Moving to straddle the hunter again he bucked his hips against the now limp dick before gaining a good rhythm. Dean grabbed his hips and pushed him forward until his dick was in his mouth. His hips fell back to the rhythm and he fucked his boyfriends face as he clung to his hair. Soon he had cum all in his mouth and some had even spilled down his face so he backed out of Dean’s mouth and fell beside him. “Where the fuck did that come from? How did you know how to give a good blow job?” “I just learned from watching you Dean. You’re a very good teacher.” “Hmm. Well that’s not the only thing I’m going to teach you.” He could only imagine what he had in store for them but he didn’t want to find out right now. Curling up next to his hunter again he licked the remaining cum on his neck and face before kissing him. “Is that how you get rid of morning wood Dean?” “One of the ways, yes.” Sighing happily he fell asleep quickly next to his hunter.
“Trust me, I know all about higher powers. My brother is actually dating one, Castiel. Well he’s in love with an angel. Ex-angel.” He laughs nervously and rubs the back of his neck.
Sam and Dean were asleep and Cas was singing? “Cassie why are you singing?” “Dean enjoys it when I sing, and it helps him to not have nightmares. I would use my powers but they’ll be gone soon and I want to help him anyway I can.” “That’s sweet. So a musical is what dropped I love you bombshell huh? Interesting.” “Yes, but I was planning on telling him soon anyways. I just didn’t know how, Dean can be unpredictable at times, so I wasn’t 100 % sure that he would return those feelings. When he did, I was never happier. I’m just glad that you found the same thing.” “Sammy is the best thing I never had. I’m just glad he wasn’t upset about my new vessel and my spying on him. I just couldn’t leave it be, I had to know how he turned out. After that I just kind of fell for him, but you know how that could be.” He was still singing but stopped a moment to reply, “Yes, I do indeed. So how are you going to have the baby in five months? It usually takes nine to deliver a human baby.” “Well I don’t know if you forget what angelic powers up to charge can do but I know fully well, and it will only take that long to pop out the perfect baby. Now do you want a girl or a boy or both?” “Um what? Both? You can make two? I’ll have to discuss this with Dean first. I don’t want to make any rash decisions.” Good thinking, he would have to learn how to do that with Sammy. “Okay well I’m going to get gigantor into bed here so he doesn’t have a crick in his neck. Goodnight.” “Goodnight brother.” He picked up Sam and took him to their room, but on the way there he woke up. “What are you doing? Are you carrying me?” “I didn’t want you to get a crick in your neck.” “Oh, thanks babe. It’s just a little odd being carried by you in your new vessel.” Laughing he put Sam down, “I know it’s odd but I still have angelic strength you sexist.” Knowing that Gabe was joking he chuckled and settled in before pulling him down in his arms, with Harry and Lucky at their feet. Soon he was back to sleep and Gabe couldn’t help but wonder about what Cassie had said. Did Sam ever have nightmares? He didn’t know, but he would find out. Touching his fingers to Sam’s forehead he peeked into his dream, Sam was sitting at a table with Gabe beside him, Cassie and Dean were holding a small child that looked exactly like them. When Gabe got up he was round with pregnancy, they were talking about the new baby. Guess Dean and Cassie did want more than one, but Sam was talking as if it was their baby this time. Sam wanted kids? He never knew, and now he was sort of terrified. Being brought back to the dream when he heard Lucky bark he laughed. How did the dogs make it into the dream, he would never know. They were all a happy family now, and suddenly in the dream it was Thanksgiving and Dean was wearing a ridiculous pink frilly apron. Guess that was their house, because he was bringing out a turkey with Cas behind him with a pecan pie. “Sammy do you want to carve the turkey? I have to help with the baby.” “Sure Dean. Thanks.” Cas put the pie down and picked up the toddler, before beginning to sing to it. Dean smiled in delight and sat down with his family. So this is what Sam dreamed about? Apple Pie life settling down with him? Looked like a pretty nice life, he decided he wanted it to become reality.
Wrapping his arms around his angel he sighs in bliss, “I don’t know if it’s all real or if this is just some cruel joke that Crowley is playing, and I don’t really care. I’m going to bask in this while I can, and if it gets ruined then so be it, until then I’m going to relax with my boyfriend.”
“He’s fine, although he just said he wasn’t feeling well but I think that’s more because of me than him actually being ill.”
“No, it’s not what you’re thinking. I just- I took your grace. It was the only way to get you out of there... “
They laughed for a small moment and in an instant Dean closed the space between their lips and kissed him.
Dean always got complemented on his good looks, but when it came from guys he got flustered and upset. He waited for the drama to begin, trying to look closer as to what was going on he gets up and moves closer but out of Dean’s eyesight. “You uh from around here?” Dean smiles and shakes his head “Nah, just passing through. Can I get another round?” “Sure thing, this one’s on the house.” Taken aback Dean tilts his head “Who do I thank for the free drink?” “My names David, but a handsome guy like you can call me Dave.”
“Oh all over, Tennessee, Texas, Kansas. My mom liked to move a lot. Kind of blended me into one giant hick if you ask me, I hate my accent. I’ve tried to change it but the darn thing won’t go away.”
“It’s okay, and don’t be sorry honey. I know what most people think and it wasn’t anything tragic like that, I just lived in a small town at the time, with nothing better to do. I’m one of the lucky ones who caught it early on, I started drinking when I was only twelve. Luckily my mom caught on and had me in rehab when I was 15. That’s when she called Bobby, blamed the whole thing on him actually. Poor guy, he didn’t even know I existed.”
And in the very back of his mind, he hoped that they would come to rescue him. That Dean would come for him.
“Thanks but it’s just Sam, and I’m really just a regular run of the mill hunter. My brother though, he uh he’s pretty good.”
After that he leaves well enough alone and pays for the clothes without further question. When they leave the store Cas hugs him tightly, bags in hand. “Thank you Dean. I’ll find some way to pay you back for all of this.”
After fifteen minutes of Dean holding the angel on the side of the road, Cas finally pulls away to look at his hunter. "Have I ever told you how gorgeous you are?" Cas laughs, he was not the gorgeous one. Dean was.
The words still stung, but not as much as the hurt look on the angel’s face did. If Sam’s life wasn’t in the balance he never would have kicked him out, he didn’t want Cas to leave,
He nods with tears in his eyes “I know, I’m so proud of you boys. You’ve literally been to hell and back, my boy. The righteous man, and now look at you! Shacked up with an angel of the lord. I guess the rumors were true. Aren’t you going to introduce me?”
was gross, because he loved Dean and Dean was a guy. A very handsome one at that. The first time he was human he saw him at the Gas-N-Sip for the first time.
He didn’t realize he was weeping until he felt the tears fall onto his neck, great. Now Dean would really hate him, he hated it when people cried. This only made him cry more, and he rolled over to sob into his pillow. The pillow that smelled like Dean, he must have taken the hunter’s pillow by mistake.
“If you want, we can just wait. I’m not an expert on human relations but doesn’t talking about it ruin the moment?”
” Once again he’s kissing Dean’s perfect cupid lips but pulls away after a moment to rewind the movie.
“Cas wait, are you okay? I didn’t mean to upset you, it’s not your fault, and you couldn’t have known it was a gay cowboy movie anyways. We’ll watch it. Sit down and have a beer with me huh?”
“It gets annoying doesn’t it? And you’re not short yourself, but it’s fine. I’ve met crazed fans and you are not one of them.”
Silently he waited in the brightly lit hallway for a flutter of wings, but nothing happened. He had royally screwed things up this time for sure.
“Hey. I’ll have you know that my true form is about the size of the Chrysler building which is very ‘Big and Tall’ as you say.”
almost falling over he catches himself with the back of the couch. “Dammit Cas. Just let me help okay?”
“Sam don’t its unimportant. I just left heaven, and they told me that they destroyed any remaining leviathans but they want me to come back and be their leader in return.” “I still don’t understand how we failed to nuke them all in the first place.” “It’s simple, we just misread the lore that if the leader is killed that they will all follow suit, that’s true if they’re loyal to the leader, if not they remain. It’s all there, we were just in a big hurry to get rid of Dick.” “Not now Sam. Haven’t they learned their lesson with that ‘commander’ shit?” “Apparently not. Hannah was in charge, but she is the one spearheading the campaign to bring me back.” “Yeah the same assholes that wanted you to kill me? Nice move Cas. Go ahead. Not anything I’m not used to. Might as well call them Crowley or Ruby for all I care. Damn.”
. After reading the words cowboys he stops and presses play. Surely Dean would love a movie about cowboys and romance, and nowhere did he see anything about guns or violence. Actually it was the perfect combination of the two movies.
“He will be when he gets home, he killed the mood and all chances of us not going slow. Now were back to square one.” Cas pouted, teasing was not fun when you were on the receiving end, except Dean
No, he fell head first in love upon touching the righteous man’s soul, and since then his life had equally been wonderful and awful at the same time. Being the Winchester’s guardian angel had its perks, a certain freckled hunter being the main one. The downside of it all was he ignored his heavenly command for the first time in his existence,
*Knock Knock* Sam and Dean stood shoulder to shoulder with Cas behind them, "Hello, Agent Segar and these are my partners Rudd and Slade." Cas flashed his new badge proudly, correctly the way Dean had taught him and they were granted access into the widows home. "Mrs. Charles thank you for allowing us to ask you some brief questions about your husbands death." She looked displeased, "It's Miss Wilcox, now. And don't mention it. I get to stare at you three beefcakes!" Something was off about this lady, Cas could sense it. After a few more questions they left and booked a motel room. "How did I miss this? All of the vics are related to Miss Wilcox some how. The first one was her boss, the other one was her high school boyfriend and the last one was her third husband. The first one died over 20 years ago, but the second one is still alive. His address is close, come on." Dean was leery "Come on man, she said she was a teacher. No way is she an alpha wolf. I'm calling bs." Cas wasn't betting on Dean being right, even though he hoped he was. Miss Wilcox looked very evil the minute he saw her, even without his powers he could still sense peoples souls. Her's was very very dark, turned so by hate and bitterness. All the men in her life had betrayed her, including her father who died before revealing who he and she truly were. "Dean I agree with Sam, this woman can not be trusted, we have to check out this address. His life could be in danger." When they finally arrived they heard a blood curdling scream pierce the air. It was a woman's scream. "See? I told you it wasn't her!" the hunter yelled as he ran with his gun in one hand and Cas's hand in the other. "Do not leave my side. Please." The angel wanted to tell him not to worry but he let it go and held his hand tightly and clung to his side. Sammy was given instructions to look for the woman while they looked for the alpha. A scream pierced the air again and upon closer inspection he could hear it was not a woman's scream at all, but a mans. He was very fearful, and it had raised his voice octaves. "Dean, it's not a woman, that's a man. I can hear it." Nodding they moved corner to corner looking for the alpha. Finally they found her hunched over her second husbands body sobbing, "You stupid fucker. I never wanted this. This is all your fault!" Confused but with mission in sight Dean moved forward and let go of his angels hand to aim his gun and motioned for Cas to do the same. Doing as instructed he moved to stand beside his hunter, the man on the floor was also a werewolf and had a silver bullets pressed into his head and one shot into his heart. Not waiting to hear an answer Dean raised his gun. "Dean wait, what if it wasn't her?" Miss Wilcox raised up and bared her teeth, "You should listen to him pretty boy, I don't take kindly to men anymore and you three have begun to get on my nerves. You're interrupting my feasting.But I don't mind a nice tasty treat of hunters now and again" she said laughing before moving towards them. Sam appeared from behind and shot at her to distract her whilst Dean shot and missed while Cas tried not to do the same. Shockingly he hit the target, and Miss Wilcox fell to the floor. Dean turned around slowly, "Cas did you do that?" Nodding he looked down, he hoped Dean wouldn't be mad that he stole his shot. "Damn babe! Way to hit the target!" Confused he looked up "You're not mad?" "Um no? Why on earth would I be mad? I faltered when she came towards you because I was so angry that I missed and you-you saved me- you saved us! See you're a natural hunter baby!!" He blushed he still wasn't used to that term of endearment, to him it meant an infant but he enjoyed it none the less. Sam gave him an approving nod "Good job man, proud of you." Dean was practically draping himself over his angel, "I don't know what I would have done if-" he was never too good at 'chick flick' moments but Cas understood and pulled him tightly against him "I know, it's okay. We're all safe." Dean pulled back "You're right. We should celebrate!"
“You remember? I thought you were dead. How did you hear me?” Cas shrugs, “I was only slightly unconscious, and coming to and from. I’m sorry I lied. Please don’t be mad, I just didn’t understand fully. Now I do. I love you too.”
and saw it hunched over Castiel’s limp body. “You’re right, it’s my bad. I should’ve paid more attention.” “It’s
“Well Dave, thanks for the drinks.” Dave winks at Dean and slips him his number, it’s discreet and most people wouldn’t have caught it but Sam Winchester
“Well he said it was a parting gift, that you two were good friends? And that you would understand?” John is clearly just as confused as Dean and Cas are.
“Well you will this year. I’ll bake a cake and everything, what flavor do you like?” It was a stupid question, he knew, but he asked anyways.
Dean held his head in his hands trying to process what had happened. Billy was gone and so was the former pain in his chest...but now that pain was replaced by a new and different kind of pain. Heartache.
Somehow Dean missed that snarky demon. They had a past sure, but it was more of an anti-friendship, but after he became a demon something changed. They had bonded, and hell Crowley was close to being human at one point. Sam wouldn’t agree he knew that, and neither would Cas but he had to at least talk to him. “You rang squirrel? Which of the Winchester’s has died this time?” “Very funny.” “Where’s Moose and wings?” “Out, but that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. Protection. See I’m retiring but Sam is still in the business and I need you to make me a promise, not a deal, a promise. From one friend to another, for old times’ sake huh?” “Depends. What is it you require?” “I need you to call back some of your demons, not all of them but minimize it. Start making deals with the next Hitler’s or something, but no more humans man okay? We didn’t close the gates of hell because it would have killed Sam, but we could have continued in making you human. You know that right?” “Of course I bloody know that. I also know that you didn’t trap me which is either very foolish or very trusting. I’m going to go with trusting, for now, but if you want protection I only require one thing. Rowena. That stupid bitch had Cas almost kill me. Lucky for you, you little love bird, I knew the reverse spell.” “Wait how do you know about me and Cas?” “Who doesn’t know about the fallen angel and the wayward hunter he rebelled for? I mean come on! You two are all anybody upstairs and downstairs talked about!” Huh he never knew that. “It’s already done. A new hunter named Sally Simon took her out just last week on a ruguru hunt. She was in the way is what I’m told, burned to ashes.” “I’ll have to look into that for myself but job well done then. And Sally Simon? Really Dean, haven’t we gotten past lying to each other? I know Sally is Gabriel, he’s been boasting about his smoking new bod and beau since he reappeared.” “Dammit Gabe. I told him to keep a low profile.” Suddenly Crowley was gone but reappeared after a brief moment with grin. “You’re right the wicked bitch I mean witch. No actually I take it back, I know what I meant. She was a total bitch and awful mother. Anyways you got it bestie. Cheers to you. Good luck and I’ll tell my black eyed darlings to lay off, I promise. But I want to meet the little bugger when you have her.” “As if. You’ll meet her one of these days, but not for a long time. Maybe one day we can have you over for a bbq and a swim.” “Perhaps. Tell Moose I said Hello.” “Will do.” Knowing he would have to tell Cas he sighed, and walked towards his room. “Babe?” “In here honey.” When he found him he was packing some of their stuff in boxes. “We need to talk.” The angel grew pale and looked up “What is it Dean?” “It’s about Crowley. I know you two haven’t gotten along well in the past but he’s changed.” “Dean he’s a demon.” “I know but for a short while so was I and you still loved me. Besides, he’s not that bad. When Sam and I were doing the trials we we’re changing him into a human remember?” When the angel nodded he continued, “Well some part of him still is, I mean I killed more when I had the mark of cain alone then when I was a demon. He also said that he was going to pull back on his deals. He can be useful babe, and if I’m going to retire I want there to be some security.” “I don’t know, I still don’t trust him.” “Hey I didn’t trust your brother fully and now he’s family.” “I don’t want to argue about this, if you want to be friends with a demon who am I to stop you, but I don’t want him around Eliza, hell I don’t want him to even know about me and you.” “Too late, he keeps tabs on everything. He even knew about Sam and Gabe. He thinks we’re besties, and we used to be somewhat.” “He knows about everything?” “Yeah he said Gabe has been bragging about it. Not that I blame him, my brothers a hit.” Cas still looked upset, “He’s going to ruin everything.” “No, he won’t. I won’t let anybody ruin this.” He took the box from the angel’s hands and pulled him up, “I would never let anybody or anything hurt us. That’s why I need Crowley. I know I’m a hell of a hunter, but I can only do so much. I need us to be safe. I need Eliza to be safe. “She will be. In case you forgot Gabriel is full power. He wasn’t affected by the fall because he’s been on earth for so long. He’s always going to be around to protect us.” “No he won’t. I need him to protect my brother, and if he’s split in between doing both one of us will get hurt.” “I still don’t like it.” Leaning in to kiss his angel’s doubts away he was surprised when Cas moved his face away. “No. I have to finish packing.” “Don’t be like that babe. I don’t want you to be mad at me.” “I’m not. We need to pack, and I’m doing that. Go watch Game of Thrones or something if you’re not going to help.” Sighing he left the room upset that him and his angel were fighting. Sam was already on the couch watching the third season of the show with Gabe sitting in his lap. It was like they lived in that spot, stupid teenagers. “How was your meeting with Crowley?” Gabe said as he grinned wickedly. “Actually I need to talk to you about that. Why have you been bragging about dating my brother and Cas and I’s kid?” “What? A girl can’t dish about how well her life is going to a couple of demons and vamps now and again?” Removing Gabe from his lap Sam looked upset, “What the hell? You’re talking to demons?” “Yeah? So? They’re good people, not all demons are bad. You of all people should know that with you two’s history.” To his surprise Sam shrugged his shoulders and sighed. “You’re right. I’m sorry I over reacted. Who am I to judge who you’re friends with. Just be more careful who you tell things to okay?” “I will, I’m sorry too. I should be more careful. It’s just I’m so happy that we’re together I couldn’t help but brag about it.” Pulling Gabe back into his lap he kissed him. “I love you.” “I love you too.” “Come on. Get a room. Sam Crowley said to tell Moose he said hello.” “And that’s another thing, why are you meeting with the king of douches?” “Because I need protection for me and my family. With my retiring and all I need to be sure that’ll everyone will be safe.” “Hello famous mighty powerful archangel. Gabriel. Nice to meet you Dean-o.” “Can it. I need you to protect Sam and you can’t protect him and my family 24/7. You just focus on Sam. Okay?” “Dean, I don’t anybody to protect me. I’m a big boy okay?” “No Sam, he’s right. Last week on that ghost case you were almost choked. If it weren’t for me you would have died.” “We burned the wrong bones. Story of my life. Fine, but don’t treat me like a 5 year old. Okay?” “Aw does lil Sammy want a cookie?” “Ugh stop Gabe.” Now they were play fighting on the couch, jealous that Cas and him didn’t make up that quickly he walked away. “Damn angels” he mumbled under his breath heading into the kitchen to eat his feelings. Looking for some pie he grunted when he couldn’t find any, he must have eaten it all. Finding some hamburger meat in the freezer he decided to cook himself a burger instead. When he was done he sat at the table thinking about his angel. He hated fighting with him, it reminded him all too well of the many times they had actually fought. It made sense why he was mad at him, he had gone behind his back and made a deal with the devil. Well not literally but to the angel it was all the same. “Dean.” Looking up from his burger he sighed. Right now he didn’t want to talk to anybody but Cas. “What Sammy.” Grabbing a burger from the plate the younger Winchester clicked his tongue. “You shouldn’t be in here eating your feelings. Go talk to him.” He put his hand up and pointed at his full mouth. Sam rolled his eyes, “Listen I know that you’re new at this whole commitment thing and I get it. It’s new, but when you’re involved with someone long term like you and Cas are you have to discuss all the decisions you make together. No more flying solo” Ugh he hated when his little brother was right. “Can it with the romantic comedy stuff. This is real life.” “Exactly Dean, you’re not going to magically make up just because. You have to apologize and fix what you did wrong. And not in the next year, now. The sooner, the better.” He got up and left his brother in the kitchen, “Don’t say I told you so.” Walking to his room he was surprised when Cas wasn’t packing but was instead sleeping on their bed. Crawling up next to him gently as to not wake him up he stroked the angels bed hair. “I’m sorry babe. I’ll never go behind your back again, from now on we’ll make all of our decisions together. I swear. I hate fighting with you sweetie. I just hope you still want to have a future together.” When his angel shifted on the bed flinching he sighed. What could he be dreaming about? It was obvious that he was having some sort of nightmare but unlike the angel he couldn’t see into the dream. Instead he decided he would try to sing to his angel, “Someday when I’m awfully low, when the world is cold, I will feel a glow just thinking of you. And the way you look tonight.” Smiling he stroked his angel’s hair again, “You’re so beautiful babe, I love you so much and I would do anything to keep you and our little girl safe.” “Why did you stop singing Dean?” “Hey you’re awake. I’m sorry, I don’t want to fight.” “I know, I heard everything. I was only barely asleep. You never told me you could sing though.” “I can’t and if I did then you would never sing to me anymore and that would suck because I like to hear you sing.” “Well sometimes it’s nice to be sang to also honey.” “You called me honey. Does that mean we’re okay?” “Never better, now that I know that you can sing, you’re never going to talk again. Sing everything.” “No no nooooo” They laughed at his sing songy reply, “Okay but every now and again you should. It’s really lovely.” “Not as lovely as you.” He hummed in agreement and laid his head against his chest. “Sing to me Dean.” “Okay.” “L is for the way you look at me, O is for the only one I see, V is very very extra ordinary,” “Since when do you listen to love songs anyways?” “Since purgatory after I found you.” “Oh. Continue.” “Wise men say only fools rush in, but I can’t help falling in love with you.” They stayed there all afternoon singing to each other and laying in each other’s arms.
“Hmm. Nope. I’m intrigued by this ‘gay’ cowboy movie. I bet you’ll like it, it does have cowboys after all.”
“No Dean, I don’t I was just joking, but you should know that I don’t care if you want to get on those sites.”
Pulling back to see the angel’s face he holds it slightly “Yeah-yeah I’m here man, are you okay?” “Is this not invading your personal space? I feel this would usually make you uncomfortable, what happened?” Shit, the poor guy must have a concussion and holding onto him this tightly probably isn’t helping, but he doesn’t want to let go,
With that they’re driving to the town over and pulling into the parking lot thirty five minutes later.
Sliding his tongue into Dean’s mouth, the angel smiles against the hunters mouth and moves to where his ass is on Dean’s crotch. Grinding up and down he starts to move in rhythm with his hunter, soon his pants are uncomfortable. He pulls away again but this time, out of confusion, “Dean. I’m uncomfortable, these pants are starting to hurt my genitals.”
“Dean?” A low voice call’s out beneath him and he realizes he’s still holding the angel in his arms. “Hey. Just bringing you inside, you okay?” “Fine, I’m just confused as to why you’re still carrying me.” Sam stifles a laugh “Uh uh I was just talking to Sammy-but he uh said that your little knock outs are just symptoms of the transition of becoming a human. I was just going to take you to your room.” “I don’t mind Dean, I just I know that these things usually make you uncomfortable.” “Yeah but you’re sick, sick people get a pass, especially when they’re my best friend. So can it. Go back to sleep if you want, I’m going to put you in your room, call out if you need anything.” Cas tries to go back to sleep after Dean sets him down on the bed and tucks him in, but he can’t go back to sleep no matter how hard he tries. Sighing he tries to get up and musters up enough strength to sit the front half of his body up. His headache has lessened, the ibuprofen Dean gave him helped tremendously. Swallowing hard he realizes he must be dehydrated, his mouth is dry and his stomach is indicating signs of hunger.“Sam? Dean?” Only calling out once both of the Winchesters appear ready for crisis. “You okay?” “Dean-I’m fine. I just can’t move a lot and I find that I require nutrition and water. My mouth is very dry.” “That’s to be expected I guess, come on. Sammy and I will help you.” Sam however has different plans “This one’s all you Dean.”
~NOTE: Hope you enjoyed the chapter, this is my first Supernatural/Destiel fanfic so let me know how it is, and any changes I should make to it. Enjoy the feels!
Dean thought he was gross. Disgusting even. He didn’t understand why? Never in his life had he been concerned about the opposite or the same sex in a romantic or physical way.
She had moved into the bunker not very long after they had saved the world from ultimate doom. Again. Sam started running every morning with her and she wore his robe from time to time. It all seemed very domestic.
“Hun I know that’s not true. It’s my dazzling personality you like not just my new smoking body.” “Exactly.” Now they were looking at each other with heart eyes and leaning in to kiss. “Alright I’m done, have fun kids. Use protection.” Both of them pulled away to roll their eyes at him, now he had to find his boyfriend. “Cas? Baby? Look I’m sorry. You know it doesn’t matter to me if you’re a man, I love your vessel. It’s who I fell in love with and I wouldn’t want it any other way. Okay?” “Dean, I’m not upset I just got an idea is all. If I could move myself to a woman’s vessel then we could have children correct?” He hadn’t given that much thought. “Uh sure yeah I don’t see why not, but I wouldn’t want to look at another vessel for that long. I like you as you are.” “Oh, I just thought it was a solution.” “It is and it’s a good one, but your grace is still fading and what would happen if you moved into another vessel and you became human? More than that what about the woman you would be possessing?” “You’re right, I never think about things that way. You’re so smart love.” “Do you really want kids right now? I mean I would love nothing more than to settle down with you in the suburbs but with my line of work I don’t see how that is possible.” “Can’t you retire? You’ve done more than your civic duty Dean, you deserve to have the apple pie life too.” Never had he thought of it that way. “I guess but um there are still monsters out there, and that will never change.” “I know but there are other hunters as well, and if something happens to pop up in our neighborhood then you go and kick its ass. Now you just won’t go out looking for it. Well maybe on holidays if you still need to every now and then but I want to come on every case, deal?” “Are we planning a future together?” “I believe we are. But what will we do for money?” “I can always get a job as a mechanic and you can do whatever you want to do or I can steal credit cards. Whatever you want.” “Someone will have to stay at home with the children, and you’re so much better with kids than I am. How about we take turns huh? I do it one week and you the next?” “Sounds like a game plan to me.” “Good.” He leaned in to kiss him and stroke his hair, “I can’t wait to start a life with you. I can hear you singing lullaby’s to the babies now.” “Hmm, but Dean I don’t know any.” “Me either, Mom always sung Hey Jude to me and Sammy. It did the trick well enough.” “She was a very good mother, and you will be an excellent father.” “Thanks babe, but not as good as you. Tomorrow we can go looking for houses if you want.” “What’s wrong with the bunker?” He raised his eyebrows, really? “Don’t worry I’m only kidding. I’d never dream of raising our children here although it would be the safest place for them.” “They’ll be safe as long as there with us.” There was a knock on the door that interrupted their moment and he groaned. “What?!” “Hey um not to listen in or anything but I couldn’t help but over hear your little predicament. And you two having children is possible. Mix you guy’s sperm together and then implant a female, or ya know your big bro in a female vessel. Just something to think over.” “What? Does Sam know that you’re offering this?” “Yes, he’s the one who recommended it when I told him that you two we’re planning a family.” “Sorry Gabe but this whole thing is just weird don’t you think so Cas?” “No Dean actually it’s a very good idea indeed.” “Great, I’m glad you think so baby bro because it’s already done! Your swimmers are planted in me right now. Coming up in two to five months a baby!! Baby Winchesteriel.” “What the hell Gabe? We were talking about in the future! Not now!!! Cas get your brother sister out of here before I punch him.” “Dean don’t he’s not lying he’s carrying our child. I know it’s sudden but we can’t go back now.” “What do you mean we can’t go back? Where did he get the egg for it?” “No need for an egg when you’re a badass archangel. Bye now!” “Cas this isn’t over go get your brother so we can talk about this some more.” “Dean we did want kids right? Why wait?” “Because I-I’m not ready yet.” “It won’t be here for another couple of months. We have some time to adjust.” “The bunker isn’t ready to have a baby in it. We’d have to baby proof, buy a baby bed, clothes, the whole works!” “I know, I know it’s a big step but we’ve waited this long and it feels like we wasted a lot of time. I don’t want to waste any more time. I want this now, but I understand if you’re not ready just yet.” “No, of course I’ll be ready. We’re doing this together, so I’ll be ready for anything.” Another knock on the door interrupted them a second time, but this time it was Sam. “I hear congratulations are in order!” “Yes, they are. You’re going to be a dad congratulations!” “Just because Gabriel is carrying you guy’s baby doesn’t mean I’m the father. We haven’t even said I love you yet, man but I am so excited to be an uncle!” “Yeah good ol Uncle Sammy which reminds me I’m retiring due to settling down with my angel, but something pops up around here we’ll tackle it, anything else you’ll be flying solo. I would ask you to retire as well but I doubt that will happen.” “Actually Dean, Gabe and I are working a case right now. I didn’t want to interrupt your honeymoon phase but there was a ruguru attack a couple of towns over. Don’t worry about it we already handled it.” This wasn’t not anything new, but at least he had an archangel in his back pocket. “Good job Sammy. Just be careful.” “Always am.” When he left and they were alone again he smiled before grabbing his angel’s face, “We’re going to be a family.” Their kiss was slow and tender. “Come on, let’s go watch some Game of Thrones.” “Okay.” Interlocking hands they headed into the living room where Sam and Gabe were as well. “Hey make room.” Gabe moved to sit in Sam’s lap and he had to hold back with a sly remark instead he sat down and pulled Cas on his lap as well. “Start it over, Cas and Gabe haven’t seen the first episode.” Sam went to the pilot episode on the DVR and the marathon began.
“Dammit, if you don’t stop I’m going to make you crawl out of hell. Now there is something I didn’t mention before, when I singed it to ashes it also burned away your grace, so you are now officially human.
“But how” with a snap of the demon’s fingers he is back in the bunker with Dean. Except it’s as though nothing had happened. Dean is sitting on the floor in the lit living room beside him confused as to what had happened.
" Dean had thought about it multiple times, but he couldn't risk loosing his angel. "I'd have to teach you how to shoot if it's a werewolf then you can't just gank him with an angel blade. You need pure silver to the heart." The angel shrugged "So?
Waking up from another nightmare, he rubbed his face. Even though it had been over a year since he lost her, he still dreamed that none of it was real, and that any day now they’d be married with kids. The nightmare part was his
He taught him that not everything was set in stone, and that he could make his own way in the world, Free Will, he called it. Free Will and Dean Winchester had been the death of him. Many times. But he was always brought back, why, he didn’t know. But he was ever grateful, and each and every time he was brought back he wanted to tell the hunter just how he felt. Somehow he knew that he would never feel the same way. Dean Winchester was a fan of the female body it was true, and Cas’s vessel was unluckily male. So when Sam called him, and he read the younger Winchester’s thoughts he rushed there. Perhaps this is what would bring them together. He didn’t like to pry into Dean’s thoughts as often as he did Sam’s because he was too afraid. Afraid at what the older hunter might think of him, afraid of rejection, ultimately afraid that everything he’d rebelled for had been for loss. Castiel didn’t deserve the righteous man. Hell, he’d never been with anybody before, but he knew right away that he wanted to be with Dean Winchester in every way possible.
Allie left regardless of Noah’s words and is weeping in the car. Pulling over she stops to read the letters.
Notes: Okay. So I lied about it finally happening so sue me. Jk. Please don't, but if I didn't leave you wondering then I wouldn't be a writer would I? Love you cuties!(0w0) ENJOY.
like he wanted to. Raking his eyes down the angel’s body he takes in how beautiful his angel was. Dark hair complemented his naturally tan skin and cobalt blue eyes. Those eyes he so often looked into were sad and tired. “Cas-wait. I do love you. I meant what I said at the warehouse. I do need you, but not because you were an angel but because you make me a better person, you make me believe in myself like you do. I love you- I should have said it sooner but I was a coward and I uh I just.” Feeling a loss for words he thinks of what to say. His eyes are full of awe once again and the blue is quickly taken by the black of his iris. Dean knows that look, he’s seen it in countless number of women,
“He went to Sioux Falls, Bobby had a lot of old books in the archive up there. Sammy thinks that it may help with whatever it is that thing did to you.”
“Hmph well what if I tease you? Hmm?” He pulls away from Cas and scoots over to the other side of the couch. Cas sits unwavering at the same spot and turns to watch the movie. Twenty minutes in Dean is pouting, and scoots back over to sit next to his angel.
“Oh right, sorry I was just so intrigued to finally get to meet the famous Sam Winchester, you’ve been to hell and back. I can’t even imagine. My name’s Jennifer by the way.”
They left the room with their hands intertwined and he blushed when he realized that this was going to be a revealing factor. Sam would know the instant he saw him, and as smart as Kevin was he would surely figure it out. Walking into the kitchen they passed the library where Sam and Kevin were sitting and Sam laughed at them. "Told you. I win, fork over the 50." "Dammit, how was I supposed to know they would get it on so early in the relationship?" "Dude did you guys place bets on when me and Cas would hook up? That is so wrong." "Yeah but you did so it makes it profitable." Cas blushed, "We're taking things slow." "Ha! No way am I giving you fifty bucks. They didn't do shit, they're just together now." "Man they were in there for hours. Hours. What on earth could they be doing for that long if not fucking?" "Listen you sickos, we were sleeping. Neither of us got that much sleep last night. Come on Cas, I'll fix you a burger." Following behind him they went into the kitchen and he started to pull things from the fridge, "You're so pretty Dean." Pretty? Usually he'd be offended at the term but when he turned he saw Cas staring at him with adoration in his eyes. "Your eyes, hair, freckles, everything, Just so beautiful." He stopped what he was doing and moved closer to his angel. "I'm far from beautiful especially standing next to you. You have to be the sexiest angel in heaven." 'I'm not an angel anymore Dean." Smiling at his angel he caressed his face, "You'll always be my angel." Cas closed the space between their lips and kissed him sweetly before backing them up to the counter. Things began to get heated quickly but he had to remind himself that they were taking things slow. "Cas babe, I can't keep my hands off of you when you take control that." "So don't." "No I want us to last so I'm not going to rush into anything. Let me fix you a burger and I promise we'll continue a PG-13 version of this later okay?" "Fine" was all he said before removing himself from Dean. "Don't pout babe." "You keep calling me babe." He hadn't realized he was doing it until the angel pointed it out. "Does it bother you?" "No I was just wondering what I could call you." "You can call me whatever you want." "Alright my dear." Dear. It was kind of weird but he liked it. "Honey?" "Yes?" "I'm going to call you honey." Continuing his fixing food he turned around and flipped the burgers. "It smells good whatever your cooking." Kevin said as he walked into the kitchen. He sat next to Cas and nudged him with his shoulder. "I approve of this new relationship with you guys and all but just don't become one of those couples who do everything together including using the bathroom. And thanks for saving me 50 bucks." "We didn't save you jack, Neither of you won. Technically. but that's none of you guys business." "Got it. So what are you cooking there Betty Crocker?" "Burgers Han Solo. Do you want one?" "Make that four." Sam said walking into the kitchen and patting his brothers shoulder before pulling out the case of beers from the fridge. He then distributed them amongst the four men. "So when's the wedding?" "Sammy, I know you're waiting on an I told you so but that ain't gonna happen." "Honey, don't be mean, Sam played a part in us confessing our feelings for each other. Thank you Sam. Your advice was sound and very useful." Sam smirked and wiggled his eyebrows and his brother. "Yeah
Ugh. “Dude, no that is a chick flick.” “Dean, I read nothing of chickens in the summary. It is entailed to be one of ‘America’s Number One Movie’. Also I like the music.” Soft music was filling the room and birds were flying above the water. “Fine. But if you start crying, you’ll have to crawl to your room.” A victorious smile lands on the angel’s face, and eats his burger as it opens up to a senior citizen center.
Dean blinked and loosened his grip before looking back at the road.. Again it looked as though he was struggling to speak. “That’s not what I meant. Just give me a moment. I’m no good at these chick flick moments, okay?”
All the encounters he had of a romantic or sexual nature had been by following what the other person did. But Dean seemed to be unsure as well.
Then in the middle of the ditch, he is pressing his lips against the angels. Their soft, just like he expected, his hand caresses his angel's face before pulling away to stare at him again.
Flipping through the old text, Sam sighs out loud. It was time to call it, Cas being human couldn’t be undone, unless he stole another angel’s grace, which he doubted would ever happen again.
Most people come back from hell broken, their soul shattered, but John’s soul seemed to be restored as if new. Crowley wasn’t lying, this was a gift indeed. He was once again pure, and the man he should have been when raising his sons.
Eileen walked out in purple flannel pajamas and one of his old t-shirts. Very lightly she touched him on the arm, looking at him with worry in her eyes.
“Stay? You keeping saying Stay with me, Stay with me. Why? So I can watch you fall in love with a woman? Have children? I can’t do that. I have to go. Because all I want is you. All of you. Your stupid jokes, and western movies, and unhealthy food. Your weird human traditions. I want to wake up in your bed, to eat your cooking, to see you every minute of every single day until I die. But that’s not what this is about it’s about you. What do you want Dean?”
Giggling nurses walk past them and are whispering not too quietly about the hot guys. “You think they’re together?”
was different, John was different. It all seemed to be too good to be true, but he ignored that gut feeling and bathed in the happiness.
Putting the laptop down, he sits on Dean’s lap and wraps his arms around him. “I’m so sorry Dean, I love it, and it was still a surprise. When is it?”
Cas said he was at a Gas N Sip there but chances are there were probably at least ten in the town. If he had called from a cell he could track it but he couldn’t do that with a payphone, or could he? He did some digging and found out that it was on the other side. Now speeding way past the speed limit he didn’t care about cops, he had to make sure the now human angel was safe. A beige car was on the left of the Gas N Sip next to the payphone, and he decided it looked very Casish. Parking right next to it, he looked around for the trench coat and heap of dark hair that accompanied bright blue eyes. Dude. Get a grip, he pulled himself together before getting out of the car. “Cas!” Snoring was coming from the inside of the car, he peeked inside and saw the ex-angel bundled up with his trench as a pillow. Not having the heart to wake him he opened the Impala’s back door before turning to the other again. Quietly he opened the door and moving the angel as little as possible he picked him up and put him in the backseat of the impala. Going to the back he grabbed the blanket and pillow they kept back there for such a case. He laid the blanket over the other man and closed the door before going back to the driver’s seat with the pillow, having a destination in mind he drove off. Finally he found a place they could park for the night safely so he tucked the pillow under his head and curled up to catch some hours before the long drive tomorrow.
When he did fall asleep it was only for an hour or so. Awakened by Cas moving his knee right into his back in a sudden movement caused him to jerk awake and panic and grab the gun under the mattress.
There was steam rising from their cups and Cas looked very happy with whatever was in his. His eyes were still drooping with fatigue but he was chatting away with Sam listlessly.
.” They dance and embrace each other for a while before it all comes crashing down just like it always does. By the end of it, Allie doesn’t remember anymore and Noah has a heart attack. Jesus, this movie went downhill fast. Dude bounces back quickly, for Christ’s sake he just had a heart attack and is
“What happened? Why do I feel human?” He knew what he really wanted to ask but he kept that in the back of his mind for now.
(Although he had never acted on it, he’d wanted to countless times.) Quickly deciding that he had nothing to lose he grabs the angel’s scruffy face. Pressing his lips to the angels he relishes in the feeling of it all. Cas is clearly surprised but doesn’t protest to it, and quickly links his arms around Dean’s neck. The kiss turns from slow and tender to heated in less than a moment.
After getting ready for bed he got comfortable on his side. Cas just stood there looking around the room.
Confused as to if he should laugh or prepare for attack he sits still. She slaps him on the shoulder. “Damn. You must have had a lot of shit happen to you, relax Winchester. It was a joke.”
“Cas, buddy that’s too big. That’s more for somebody like Sammy. Look at the label it says Big and Tall. You need average and tall.”
They kissed softly for a few moments, taking some time to explore the new experience. When Dean pulled away, he had no doubt or worry in his mind. They had plenty of time now.
“Right. Dumbass teenagers with no house training. Here, wear these” he says handing him a pair of jeans. “I don’t know if they’ll fit, but if they don’t I’ll give you a belt to wear.”
He tried not to notice how hard Dean was holding his hand as he pulled him along. Normally he would have let go by now.. This was unusual ground for them and he wasn’t sure how to proceed. Did he need to squeeze it? Was his hand sweaty? Why did he feel faint?
“Well I know you’re not looking at the mechanic are you?” He laughs, Dean wasn’t gay, because he’d been a ladies man since birth.
It’s the last thing he says as he bends over his angel’s broken body, and holds him for hours until he passes out on the warehouse floor clutching him like an old teddy bear. “Dean?” Sam must be ready to go, so he peels himself off of his angel’s body. He waits on the usual “It’s not your fault, he’ll come back” spill that Sam had undoubtedly has for him but it doesn’t come. Hearing his name again he looks around, “
“You are not a burden. I never want to hear you say that ever again. Where is all of this coming from?”
. You arrogant, stubborn hunter. All you do is sacrifice yourself selfishly expecting the people who love you to go along with it. And now that everything is fine, you screw it all up because you can’t handle the fact that I LOVE YOU. Me. Castiel. A
“I need help, he passed out and he’s unconscious.” The nurse looked sympathetic as she nodded and gave him a wheelchair for his brother, “I’ll check his vitals. Can you tell me what happened?” Shit. He hadn’t thought about a cover up story, “I’m his brother, I uh I found him like that, he’s been sick with the flu for over a week.” Nodding she smiled, “Okay honey, it looks like he’ll be okay but you’re going to need to wait here alright?” He shook his head, “No I need to be with him. Please.” There was no way he was going to wait in a waiting room while his brother was possibly dying in the next room. Seeing he was serious she whispered, “Okay, but if you hear footsteps hide in the bathroom okay?” “Thank you.” One small thing didn’t lighten his dark mood one bit, and he decided to try the angel life line again. Cas, man I don’t know what happened up there, it doesn’t matter. We’ll work it out okay, but I need you here with me man. Sammy’s in real bad shape and I don’t know if he’s going to be okay or not. Not that I need you to heal him or anything I just I need you, for some support. And Cas? Please, please don’t be dead. I can’t lose you too. I’d die without you and Sammy. He was desperate to hear the flutter of Cas’s wings but instead all he heard was his brother’s heart rate monitor. Footsteps approached and he got up to hide in the bathroom but it was the nurse from before. “Can I get you a water or something? You may be in shock.”
