"Sorry," Steve said, lifting away the sterile wipe he'd been using to clean the head wound.
The Mayor's smile returned at his enthusiasm. "I know, and I've been told you might be ready for your first assignment soon."
"I'll take that as a yes, then." Tony seems amused, not angry, and from what Steve can tell, it's not in a sneering, sarcastic way.
Obie, ordering the hit—the shock of hearing those words is so deep that Tony's gasp breaks through the paralysis.
"I have nothing until noon. I'd be happy to help, if I can. Please, come on up."
He didn’t just care about Steve. He’d been a mess of conflicting emotions about Steve since the day they’d first met on the Helicarrier. He couldn’t stand Steve, but he couldn’t stand being without Steve, either. As angry as he’d been at Steve after Siberia, he’d still missed Steve in spite of himself.
Maybe they'd faked it. Wouldn't be impossible to do. Fraud happened even on the highest tiers of research. Then again, this must've been scrutinized to the max, for the scientists to get it published in one of the most prestigious journals out there.
Tony was still smiling, and it was every bit as charming as it had been last time. Again, it looked and sounded a whole lot like he was trying to flirt with Steve. In fact, Steve would've been hard pressed to figure out how he could've been more flirty. In spite of his resolution to play this carefully, it put Steve's foot firmly in his mouth when he tried to reply.
It really grates on Tony's nerve to hear Obie refer to Steve as an "it," let alone a "product" or a "freebie." It's dehumanizing. And yet, it's not wrong. Steve isn't a human. Tony knows that. You can't dehumanize what's not human.
"Maybe," Tony mumbled.
Tony straightened up in his chair, casting a surprised look at Steve. "Really? I'm talking about slow travel here."
It's true that Tony has no idea what he's going to do with this android, but he's sure as hell not going to tell Steve to go back just so that they can shut him down.
Steve knew how securely guarded the Tower was. Ultron controlled everything, from the street-floor entrances to the top-floor penthouse. Every single elevator and stairwell was under constant surveillance, and no doubt there would be drones patrolling the skies around the tower as well, now that Stane had been granted those extra privileges to use them at will. Getting Tony out of there wouldn't be any easier than it would've been to try and kidnap Stane in broad daylight, which they'd already dismissed.
"We should, but Steve," Natasha said, both her voice and her expression somber, "we can't rush this. Crabb Castle isn't just the largest town in the North, it's where they train their guerillas. They'll outnumber us a dozen to one. We'll have to plan this rescue very carefully, or we'll end up imprisoned together with Tony."
There was no answer, just the soft wash of the waves against the pier and the distant cry of a seagull.
His words are cut short by Steve's fist connecting with his face. Obie disappears from Tony's field of vision and hits the floor with a heavy thud. Steve follows, going out of sight as well.
"No, no, definitely not. They were all men. At least two, maybe three, and they were arguing. I couldn't make out the words," the lady said apologetically.
He thought of Steve. Of falling asleep in Steve's arms, warm and safe and as happy as he had ever been.
He'd barely had time to mope for a minute before the house AI announced that the food delivery was at the door. The drone he met there looked extremely expensive, badly out of place in the plain, shabby hallway. He accepted the boxes with a "thank you", only belatedly realizing that he was talking to a non-humanoid machine that wouldn't register politeness.
As far as he could tell, there was nothing in particular that would've kept this hollow cool amidst the blaze, and yet, it didn't seem as badly burned as most of the rest. Tony must've gotten incredibly lucky.
Iron Man shifted his hands, letting them slide over to Steve's front, running them down his chest and up again, his thumbs brushing against Steve's nipples.
It wasn't Tony who opened the door, but an older man with bushy white hair, sideburns and mustache. He was dressed casually, the motor oil stain on one sleeve hinting at working on mechanical things. "Good morning, Captain," he greeted Steve, seemingly unsurprised to have a costumed visitor. "Tony mentioned you might be stopping by."
"For the record, I don't hate you," Tony says, not directly responding to Steve's apology. As he goes on, it's in that uncharacteristically hesitant, contemplative tone, which must be more than just a result of how tired he is. "You know, some of the last lucid thoughts I remember—not counting that very unexpected speech of yours—were about you. When I was lost in the rain, I was wondering where you were, and kept thinking that I should try to find you. That's why I called out."
Once detached, the component quickly shifts from orange to blue. It's not damaged. This really must be his lucky day.
He wasn't going to break. He couldn't. He closed his eyes and forced his breathing to slow, trying to make the best of even this short respite. This wasn't real. He could take this.
"Okay? What's that?" Steve asked, turning to face Tony properly. He'd been trying to figure out a way to bring up the conspiracy himself, and he couldn't help but wonder if Tony knew already and wanted to talk about it, too.
Tony had been so sure it was all bullshit, though.
Tony was the first to arrive, at eight o'clock sharp. He came on foot, alone. Still wearing his coveralls and cap, walking with his hands in his pockets, he looked like someone who might be working at the docks. He stopped around a dozen feet from where Steve was hiding, looking around. There was enough light left that Steve could make out the grim look on his face, the thin line of his lips and the frown on his brow.
As the evening draws inevitably closer, he stops at a stream to drink and to soak his burning feet. It feels amazing, partly because the water is so cold that his toes soon turn entirely numb. He considers sinking his head in the stream as well, since that might offer him some relief from the gnawing headache, but that would be asking for hypothermia.
At length, Seren spoke up again, softly, hesitantly. "I'm scared, too. I don't want to lose you. Maybe it's selfish. I was alone for such a long time, and if you—if you're no longer here, then I'll be alone again."
The place Tony was staying at was called Sleepy Eyes Inn, and the most flattering thing Steve could say about it was that it had better facilities than the first hotel he'd visited tonight, in the sense that it had a bar. It certainly wasn't much cleaner; the floor of said bar, which doubled as the reception, was sticky under his shoes. Overall, the place felt only slightly less shady than the Groggy Cod, with lighter-colored decor, brighter lights and softer music.
That was an honor that many of Bucky's friends would envy; usually the Mayor dined with her assistants or the highest-ranking officers in the resistance. On some other day, Bucky might've felt flattered, but today, when he wasn't sure about anything, he was just glad that he could have the time to discuss his conundrum with her.
The surroundings of the town were mostly shrouded in darkness, and they made sure to avoid any areas reached by light from within the walls. As they got closer, they split up, with the trio heading for the gates keeping a direct course, Natasha veering to the left and Steve to the right, now moving at a jog.
Steve had known Barnes had killed Tony's parents, and he'd never said a word, but then, why would he?
Still cuddling Steve, Tony brought his hands to Steve's waistband, his fingers slipping under costume and shorts to Steve's buttocks. Their warmth sent a renewed shiver of want through Steve.
Sometimes, it amused him in a bittersweet way how much he and Pepper were like the proverbial old married couple, even though they'd never ended up together.
"Are you okay, Steve?" Bucky asked him discreetly, leaning closer to his seat. "You really do seem sulky today."
He'd made his peace and he was ready to let go, but that's not true anymore.
"Sir. You have a visitor," JARVIS says, firmly, like he's been telling that to Tony several times already.
As disappointing as that was, it had also been one of his greatest successes so far. Steve now knew exactly where Tony was, and the place was less than ten minutes away. Unless Tony would take the phone call as his cue to run away and hide somewhere else, there was a very good chance Steve could catch him.
"No. We should've done this years ago. It's time we got it over with," Tony decided.
"Come on, come get it," he mutters at the lake. "Premium worm. Only today, just for you."
"No. Never," Stark said, his shoulders squared, without a hint of hesitation.
"You gave me hope. That's something I hadn't felt in ages," Seren said, as if she could guess what Tony was thinking. "If only I could give you some of it back now that you need it."
"What kind of safety features does this car have?" he asked the AI conversationally.
"I'll tell you all about it if you first answer one question for me," Tony says, buttoning up his shirt, not replying any of Kamski's questions yet.
The workshop didn't have so much a kitchen as an assembly of vintage household appliances and a sink in one corner, with a high table and four bar stools close by. What passed for coffee down here was far removed from its namesake on the higher floors, mainly similar in that both contained caffeine and were warm, brown liquids. To Tony's great amusement, Steve very nearly ended up spitting out the first bitter mouthful. In addition to that, breakfast consisted of tasteless gruel, which according to Jarvis included all the necessary nutrients. That probably made it better than what most people around these parts could get their hands on.
The thought crossed Steve's mind that he might've set himself up for a mission that was doomed to fail. Counting the years, Stane had been playing the part of Tony Stark in the public eye longer than Tony himself. He wasn't going to slip accidentally. But Steve had known this wouldn't be easy, and he was going to try as hard as he could to get what he needed.
"It's about Stark," Bucky told her. "Can you spare a few minutes? It's important."
"I said I'd made some progress, but it's not much," Tony said dismissively.
He raised his head to glance at Tony, and saw that he wasn't sleeping either. He seemed just as lost in contemplation as Steve had been, staring into the distance, past the wall of bones illuminated by the beam of his headlamp.
He'd been thinking about this even before he'd been captured, occasionally, but it had seemed like it would complicate things too much. He'd been too worried that the Dinotopians might shun him entirely if he told them that he was Iron Man, let alone involved himself in the conflict with the North. With everything that had happened, things had fallen into a new perspective.
Obie clearly doesn't even try to cover his discontent. "Not what I was expecting."
His mind had been transferred into a new frame.
He knew he was doing the right thing here, both for himself and for Steve.
In his exhausted, barely coherent mind, he thought she must've lost it completely. They were on the 194th floor. Steve might not have felt unnerved about jumping out of a cab at around the 50th, but this was a whole lot higher, and as far as he could tell, they had no anti-gravity gear.
"What secrecy?" he asked.
"You say that as if it's a bad thing." Tony picked up his glass and sipped at his drink. "It's hardly new for me, anyway. You know me, Steve, don't you? I like to be ahead of the curve."
He's used to napping in all kinds of extreme circumstances. This shouldn't be any different. Besides, there's an additional advantage to the crevice he's hiding in compared to most other places: it's in the shadow. He already knows from last night that the sun doesn't entirely set here, suggesting that they must be above the Arctic Circle. Beyond his niche, it's still not entirely dark, bright sunlight lingering just above the horizon.
They didn't talk about the Accords or the related crisis again during the rest of Tony's stay in the medical bay. Steve knew they would need to revisit the topic at some point, but he wasn't in a particular hurry to do it. They mostly didn't mention the other things they'd talked about, either, even though Steve spent most of his time in Tony's company. The medical staff encouraged him to do that; apparently, since Tony wasn't so sick that it'd block the soulmate link, Steve's presence was a stabilizing factor that helped him recover faster.
As he ran, Steve considered his priorities, trying to formulate a plan. His primary goal was to locate any surviving members of his team, but they could be anywhere in the world. It wouldn't be an easy task, and it would take time. To get that, he would have to find a way to keep Ultron and Tony off his tail first. There was one obvious solution to that problem: if he could swap frames, he'd get rid of any potential tracking hardware, and have a disguise. The thought of having someone else wear this particular frame, with his face on it, was vaguely disturbing, but it was a sacrifice he was willing to make in exchange for his freedom. He'd just need to find someone with the right tools, and willing to deal with the tracking. That wouldn't be easy with no contacts.
"See, when you came back, at first, I thought maybe I'd made a mistake, ordering that hit on you." Obie pulls out a pocket knife and opens it as he speaks.
"I'm genuinely pleased to hear that," Natasha replied. Steve wasn't sure if there was some warmth beneath the sarcasm. "I'm trying to escape the authorities and the press here so I can head for the clinic. I'll keep you posted."
Tony wasn't wearing a suit when he reappeared, but a silk bathrobe, and his smile looked even more dangerous than before. "I think we've established you have an incredibly high tolerance for pain, but no matter. There are other methods we can try," he said, lowering his voice towards the end.
If he was right about this, maybe he could talk to Tony and convince him this was something worth looking into.
They take Steve to a SHIELD hospital, because the medical facilities in the Tower aren't enough for someone who needs round the clock care. Steve's temperature settles at a few degrees below normal, and he's breathing on his own, but he doesn't react at all to any attempts at rousing him, his brainwaves showing no improvement. It feels unreal to Sam: as much as he knows Captain America is human, he's always seemed almost invulnerable, shrugging off injuries that would leave others bedridden. It's difficult to wrap his mind around the fact that being stuck in the cold has left Steve so sick. The idea that he might not wake up again in weeks or months—let alone years, or never—is unimaginable.
In the morning, he woke up from a deeply inappropriate dream in which Tony had returned to the bar later. He'd led Steve to the corridor at the back, where one of the doors had opened into his bedroom. It'd been just as luxurious as Jan's suite at the Waldorf Astoria, with velvet curtains and silk sheets that'd felt very smooth against Steve's skin when he'd settled down on the bed. Tony had unzipped his coveralls, revealing he wore nothing at all under them, and had eagerly started to undress Steve—
"There's one more thing." Tony blinked his eyes open to glance at Steve. "The Accords, Siberia, all that."
"Let her go," Tony growled at the big man, who'd remained in the background by the cars, and was clearly in charge. This must be the Kingpin, then, Steve remembered from earlier.
"Uh." Steve would be hopelessly out of date when it came to which parts of town were hotspots for particular criminal elements. For now, anywhere not too close to the police, SHIELD headquarters or Stark Tower would do. "Let's go north. Say, 168th Street."
More from sound than sight, Steve realized that Tony's free hand had gone to his own cock, stroking himself lazily while using his mouth to drive Steve crazy. That was enough to dispel Steve's lingering concerns that Tony might be too nervous to be having fun.
"You don't have to. I'm not here to take you away," Steve said, careful not to raise his voice in response. He stepped off his bike and spread his arms placatingly. "I just want to talk."
Tony bit his lip, berating himself. He didn't want to push away the last person he'd ever talk to. "I'm sorry, Seren. That wasn't nice of me," he said placatingly. "It's just—honestly, I'm scared. I don't want to give up, but there's nothing I can do."
He couldn't decide what to say, so he said nothing.
They didn't hear from Tony or Rhodey again during the ten-minute drive back. Both Clint and Natasha did contact them, each of them sounding shocked. Clint promised he'd meet them at the workshop as soon as he could get there, while Natasha, regretful, said she'd still have to go to the clinic to catch up with Stane in his new clone. If she didn't, her cover would be blown, and it was more important than ever for her to maintain it now.
They'd been through this several times before they'd left Cornucopia, Natasha telling them all they needed to know about the North and its people. It was a relief to have someone around who not only knew the situation well, but was willing to discuss it in depth, now that the first shock of her revelation had settled.
"The bathroom of a high-end VR salon, after a business meeting with Justin Hammer," Tony spat out the name like something sour.  "Remember that name. He's right on top of that suspects list, and as it happens, I'm having lunch with him in around three hours."
Steve can already feel the chill radiating from the ground he's sitting on. He should get back to the hut, and back to civilization—and he needs to take Tony back as well, and let everyone know of his fate.
This is a military android. Its internal build, the bullet-proof lining of its chassis and the heavy-duty servos make that even more obvious than the fatigues it's wearing. Really, it's another type of weapon. A machine made to kill. It's like a broken tank. Fixing one wouldn't do humanity a favor. His captors might grab it and reprogram it to serve their cause.
It's too much; it's too kind. If Steve knew the truth, if he knew the secret Tony's keeping from him, he wouldn't be talking like that.
Steve caught one of Tony's nervously gesturing hands between his, running a soothing thumb over the back of it. "You're definitely allowed, and I'm not about to complain as long as you didn't pick it because you think it's what I want. How does it feel?"
This time, he wasn't entirely sure if the way his breath caught at his throat was just emotions, or something physically wrong with his lungs.
Steve's fingers tightened around Tony's, pulling him out of his thoughts. "Tony," he said, mild rebuke in his voice.
"I'm coming over," Steve said, his mind instantly made up.
The windows of the airship that he built, because that was what he did.
Steve wasn't sure if Tony wasn't at ease with this renewed closeness, or if he was giving Steve space because he didn't know what Steve wanted. Steve hoped this wasn't too much, too soon; it was hard to imagine how Tony would feel about this, when in Steve's subjective timeline it had been less than a week since they'd last shared a bed.
"There are so many options here." Tony drew the knife away from Steve's face and set it down lower, at the dip between his collarbones. "Lots of ground to cover. Luckily, we also have lots of time." He sliced downwards, cutting a sharp line of pain down along his sternum. Steve bit his teeth together, struggling not to cry out.
"No, that won't be enough," Steve insists. "He's very sick—he's unconscious and he won't wake up. He needs proper medical care. Please, if there's any chance you could contact the emergency services—"
Steve shrugs. "In a way, I'm not, since I'm the last of my model, but there are plenty of others that could do all the same tasks just as efficiently."
Happy was still staring at his screen, occasionally poking at it with a finger, probably switching to a different feed, and Pepper still had an absent, distracted look.
"If you've got nothing against it," he tells the nurse, with a yawn for good measure, "I think I'm going to take another nap now."
Steve is seeing all of this; he's seen the reactor properly, now, and he will recognize the tech. Maybe he will guess the rest of the story too, and understand Tony's duplicity. Then, he won't be sad when Tony's gone. Not that an android should be capable of sadness, in the first place—but based on everything he's seen, Tony's starting to suspect that Steve might be.
Tony backs away from Obie. "I'll talk to him, but don't expect too much," he says, mostly because he knows that'll put an end to this particular conversation, and because it's what he intends to do, anyway. At some point. When he's ready.
"No, it was nothing like that!" Steve tried again, thinking fast, reaching out for some lie that would make things better. "I didn't send him. He came to me, after he'd met you. He knew you were in some kind of trouble, and he'd heard I was looking into this case."
Tony picked up Steve's tie from the desk and stepped closer to him to wrap it around his neck, holding both ends of it. He used it to pull Steve into a kiss that was downright desperate, like a drowning man trying to find one more breath of air. Tony's mouth felt even warmer than before, so hot that Steve thought it might leave his lips cracked and swollen, but he didn't care. He wrapped both arms around Tony and kissed him back, one last time.
The air belonged to skybaxes, which were the largest flying animals Steve had seen, resembling neither birds nor bats with their leathery wings, long beaks and bony crests. Only trained pilots were able to ride them, or rather, to fly with them. The way Sam described it, a
When Tony got the all-clear to leave the medical bay, Steve accompanied him on the walk across the building. It was the longest stretch Tony had covered after the incident. He insisted it was fine and that he didn't need Steve to hover so close, but by the time they were at the door to Tony's bedroom, he was ashen-faced and out of breath, the weariness radiating through their bond so profound that it made Steve want to lie down. He took comfort in the fact that he could actually feel it. That meant it couldn't be too bad.
"An artifact," Fedora said. "The one you recovered on your recent expedition."
"In here," Steve called out.
He places a cautious hand on the android's shoulder and gives it a nudge. "Hey, you awake?" he tries.
Steve pulls up a chair and sits down next to Tony's bed. "I think that's the hard part done, then. Agreeing that we want to fix things."
"Um, no, but she did say she'd be taking some time off. She has a lot to deal with," Dr. Harris said, lowering his voice meaningfully. Steve's first intuition was that he was referring to the fire, but right away, he realized the timeline didn't fit. That had only been yesterday. If Dr. Harris hadn't talked to her since four days ago, he must mean something else.
He sat through meetings and poked at projects, but his mind was constantly on what was to come.
Bucky caught hold of Stark's shoulder, giving it a light shake. "Stark. Wake up." Although there was no one around to hear him except Stark and the dinosaur, he found himself lowering his voice conspiratorially.
He could stay and attempt to catch more fish. That might be smart. He doesn't know when he'll next come across a body of water large enough for fishing. Then again, if he makes it to that hut today, the food situation might solve itself. He's counting on that.
At the front of the group, a shape emerged from the foliage: the head of a monster straight out of a nightmare, or even worse, from some drug-induced hallucination. It was like no lizard Bucky had seen, its snout thicker, with mean-looking ridges above its gleaming eyes, and jaws that opened to reveal rows and rows of huge, sharp teeth.
Whatever was going on with Tony, whether he was acting himself or not, Steve couldn't deny that he was very, very attractive.
"Ultron. You say you can't bring him out. Could you insert another person into the program?" Steve asked. Natasha looked up from her screen, quirking an eyebrow at him.
He's so very tired, and there may be tears in his eyes. He buries his face in the pillows to hide them.
Tony's eyes narrowed. "I find that hard to believe."
What Steve wanted to do next was to rush back to the Groggy Cod, in costume, and interrogate people until he finally got some information about last night, but he knew that'd probably be pointless right now. It wasn't even lunchtime yet, and the bar wouldn't be open. At best, if he was lucky, he might catch some of the staff.
"I'm glad you've found work for the SR100 that fits its talents so perfectly," Kamski notes, not directly referring to Captain America, but obviously implying he's figured out what's going on. "Even though it was a bit of an oddball and gave us a lot of trouble, it was one of my favorite designs, and I was sad to have to keep it stored away indefinitely."
"Just be careful, is all I'm asking," Rhodey said mildly.
JARVIS figures it out the minute Tony gets home. "Welcome back, sir," the AI greets him, and then, "I'm picking up an energy source with a signature resembling that of a CyberLife android."
"Seriously though, I must've shorted you out somehow, that wasn't normal," Tony prodded Steve's chest with his forefinger. "An orgasm isn't supposed to make you, I don't know, dissociate, or whatever that was. It was beyond subspace. It was like your mind went away entirely."
"I don't see how he could've," Steve replied. As much as he wanted to believe otherwise, it seemed very unlikely.
"I was still prone to tiring more easily than completely healthy people, and chest pains and palpitations bothered me occasionally, but I tried not to let that slow me down. Besides, I was definitely more fit than I'd ever been. We went on that first expedition in the Andes, and I handled the high altitudes without any major problems. I thought I'd left the worst of the heart issues behind me, until a trip to the Sahara desert a few years later nearly became my last."
He kept telling himself he'd done his best in what had been an utterly fucked-up situation, but he didn't really believe it. He should've done better. If he'd gotten through to Steve so that Steve would've accepted that olive branch, he could've prevented most of this.
As Bucky ushered Stark into his cell and unshackled his wrists, Stark turned around and grabbed Bucky by the sleeves.
Steve didn't see any reason not to explain the whole situation to her. "I don't know if he told you, but there was another fire last night, and Tony was caught in it. Which made me wonder if there might be a connection between the two."
The receptionist watched him cross the room with a thoroughly disinterested look, but Steve still imagined there was some disdain in it. He couldn't have seen Steve when he'd stopped by at Tony's door with breakfast, but he'd probably seen Steve follow Tony upstairs yesterday. Steve wondered if some of the other occupants might've also heard them last night. They hadn't been particularly loud, but not exactly noiseless, either, and he didn't expect the building to have the best soundproofing.
"You fix things?" Steve offered.
Steve had no idea what to expect from the VR scenario he was entering. When Stane had tortured him, it had been in a replica of his bedroom, but there was no reason he'd pick a similar setting for Tony. Stane had also been the only one present in that bedroom scenario, and there was no reason for that to be the case, now. There could be an army of programmed torturers, or bloodthirsty monsters, or no one at all, just an endless desert landscape or a vast sea where you'd have to swim until your strength failed and drown, again and again. Any horror that human or machine imagination could create.
Tony sat down on the armchair, his hands on his lap, his shoulders hunched. "Since I'm apparently doing my best to bring down the mood, there's one more confession I've got to make."
"How bad is the media fallout?" he asks, unable to keep the weariness out of his voice.
"Steve," Tony murmured.
"All right. I'm not going to rule anything out at this point, but let's stick to a single-assassin hypothesis for now," Steve agreed. "So, what about your assistants? Either of them at the VR salon with you?"
"And you're Iron Man," Steve returned. "A war hero, just like me."
There was no question that Mona believed every word of what she was saying, and her brother wasn't the only resistance fighter who'd died. The group Bucky had traveled with had come close to a deadly fight with a dinosaur on the way back after capturing Stark—and yet, they'd avoided it because Stark had been able to convince the beast to leave them alone.
He still put his sunglasses on to block some of his expression, just out of habit.
The wait during the procedure felt longest of all, but at least Steve had company. It wasn't just Pepper, Rhodey and Happy, but Natasha as well. She'd pointed out, half jokingly, that she was technically still working for Tony. Her contract was with Stark Interplanetary, not with Tony Stark personally, and the identity theft revelation hadn't affected that. Details like this would undoubtedly keep cropping up in the coming months while they sorted out the mess Stane had left behind. They'd face them as they came. Once Tony was okay.
"It wasn't like you think," Steve began.
They'd rushed through the preparations in a single day. Tony had been apprehensive about waiting even that long before taking action, since it would mean Stane had more time to strengthen his safety precautions, not to mention the ever-present risk that he'd catch them. Still, even Tony had admitted that the delay was inevitable. There was no way they could've done anything sooner; simply contacting the resistance covertly had taken time. Besides, Steve had needed the day off to rest. Luckily, Jarvis's scan had confirmed that he hadn't suffered any permanent neural damage. He was currently feeling a lot better after another night of solid sleep, courtesy of a combination of sleep medication and Tony's company.
Nothing would surprise Tony anymore, not after everything they’d gone through in the past months, from megalomaniac alien conquerors to magic and alternate universes. They’d been through a lot, and they’d worked side by side to survive it. Tony and Steve had shaken hands and smiled in front of cameras and told the world that the band was back together. They’d gotten very good at pretending everything was at status quo again, with ‘pretending’ being the operative word.
Tony spent a lot of time crossing such challenging terrain, himself. He had no intention of letting the Northerners take him wherever they were planning on going, and he could use their lack of experience to his advantage.
"It had better be," Tony said. He'd already sent her samples to his top geneticists. There were certain advantages to having a strong presence in the biotech field. "Honestly, she's put up with so much crap from me, she should be nominated for sainthood. It's a proper miracle she hasn't walked away ages ago."
When he returned a minute later, his expression had turned grave. Tailing him was a petite, dark-haired lady in a skybax rider's uniform who looked equally serious.
He had no way to control his descent, nor to actively avoid the traffic. He was going to have to trust the proximity sensors in the passing cars. They'd been pretty good back in his day, so he assumed they were almost infallible now. He couldn't bring himself to worry too much about that, either. After everything he'd been through, surely he wasn't going to be taken out by a car.
She handed over some of the heavier items in her rucksack, kissed Pepper goodbye, waved at the others, and set off towards the town at a jog.
"Anyway, solving that mystery might be a good thing. If this killer were to succeed at wiping Tony, we'd lose our chance at having a major ally against Hydra," Natasha said.
"I'm proud to continue my family's tradition of fighting the oppression," the Mayor declared, holding her chin up proudly—again, Bucky could almost see an echo of Steve in her demeanor. "Which is more than you can say for yourself. But now's your chance to change that."
A small crowd of onlookers had gathered to witness the incident. Steve decided to approach them first, instead of disturbing the firemen who were clearly hard at work. Some of the people seemed like they'd just been passing by, dressed in regular street clothes, while others must've hurried out of the building in various states of dress, or rather, undress.
If this had been anyone other than Tony Stark, a war hero whose accomplishments equaled Steve's own, Steve would've been extremely sceptical. It seemed awfully convenient that Tony was here, miraculously unharmed, and claimed he didn't remember a thing. If he'd been someone Steve had never heard of, he would've found him a likely suspect. Then again, if Tony had been the arsonist, wouldn't he have escaped the scene rather than ending up trapped as he'd been? It did sound more likely that he'd been a victim, in which case, the amnesia might well be real, not some attempt to hide things from Steve.
Steve thought of the last time they'd spoken, of that dinner they'd not shared when Tony had walked out. If Tony remembered that, he didn't show it. Of course, even if it had been yesterday for Steve, for Tony, it would've been almost a century ago. He'd probably had dozens of relationships and even more one-night stands since then—but then again, he'd still wanted to have Steve here and now, for whatever reason.
He can't keep going for much longer. If he knew he was getting somewhere soon, he could keep pushing, but looking at this view, he must still have hours left to go. He simply doesn't have that in him.
Pepper's reply was in the same vein, and more confident. "No, I definitely think there was an external influence at play. I've known him for decades. He's not suicidal. Not these days, anyway," she said, the last sentence spoken more softly, like a sad afterthought, looking away from Steve.
"Nah," Tony lies. "I'm used to it by now."
He reached out a hand to shake hers, because it seemed like she'd appreciate that. She did, indeed, taking hold of Steve's gloved fingers with both hands and beaming at him as if she'd been blessed by the Pope himself.
Not wanting to waste a second, Steve climbed over the parapet and jumped down. It was a high leap, but the grass was soft, and he landed with a graceful roll, again feeling that exhilaration of being out and putting his talents to good use. He got to his feet and crossed the distance to the gates at a run. The night remained quiet, without a single sign that anyone had raised an alarm about their stealthy attack.
Steve huffed, and decided he couldn't let Tony go on any longer, because he was obviously pulling Steve's leg. "That's a captivating story, but that's not at all how Rhodey described the Andean expedition."
Bucky's eyes widened a little. "Oh, you found him? That's great!"
Steve tried to do as Pepper suggested and hold on to hope, as difficult as it was. That night, he went back to the inn, as Tony had asked, wearing his civilian clothes. The receptionist-bartender was someone different that night, a young lady who seemed to share some of the previous one's looks and all of his bored disposition. Steve figured she might be his daughter. He asked her if she'd seen anyone matching Tony's description, but she hadn't.
Rhodey felt betrayed too because they didn't listen.
Tony wished, one more time, while he watched Rhodey cook something muttering about how Tony didn't take care of his health, that he had been his soulmate, because Rhodey listened, even when Tony didn't deserve, he would listen.
He always had on his face the look of someone who knew everything Steve was thinking. He felt guilty because Bucky was already going through enough difficulties and still had to deal with his problems.
And prayed.
That explained to him about the new world he lived in.
He had escaped death with pieces of metal in his chest and a few years later someone came and stuck another piece of metal there, as if to reinforce the point of view.
Of course, it always came with some other mental issues, like anxiety and PTSD, and yeah, it was awful and all, but Tony never felt as helpless as he was now.
Tony didn't know exactly what to feel while hugging Peter, his tears hurt him and Tony knew that the idea that the kid would be suffering for him would torment his nightmares until the end of his days, but he couldn't be totally in that situation when his mind also focused on the feeling of betrayal for not having his wishes respected even when he was dying.
Tony did cry that night.
Tony was destined for dead men.
The mark that was the same as Steve Rogers and James Barnes, two dead war heroes, the mark that Howard hated as much as he hated Tony, the mark that his mother hated too because she thought it was creep and that it symbolized something wrong with Tony’s soul, it meant that he was trying to be in between someone else's relationship, the purest, perfect and full of love relationship, the most historical one that was displayed in every damn historical book, and they ware dead.
The genius arrived where he was today for two reasons, the first is that yeah, he was a natural genius, the second is because of incentive, his desired to prove Howard wrong, to prove that he was more than Captain America, that he could be something wonderful too... It was what moved Tony forward for a long time.
She just smiles at him fondly.
Sam never looked at Rhodey's hologram, his gaze focused on the center of the table.
When Pepper found out she was heartbroken but insisted that Tony kept talking with the psychiatrist, she wanted Tony to at last die in a better mental state, she didn’t say it with her words, but it was easy to read in her eyes. Tony didn’t have much of a choice anyway, he was dying, so let him try to ease the tension on Pepper’s shoulders a little.
And Rogers and Barnes fought hard, the intention was clear, each punch, each kick. If it hadn’t been clear before, the shield on his chest was all the message he needed. Rogers fought to kill.
“If you have any questions or need anything, ask Friday. Rhodey is there, too, if you need them. ”
And Tony believed her, with all he had in his little toddler heart.
Tony had thought a lot about it back in the days from MIT. Rhodey didn’t have a soulmate, Tony’s ware dead, they would manage, somehow, but Tony never created the courage to ask, and neither did Rhodey.
In his head, at that moment, the only thing he could think was to go back, but he knew was too late, so he prayed.
Her eyes after that day were always red as if she had cried a lot, but she always smiled when she saw Tony, a smile sweet reserved only for him as if he were some kind of precious thing that she wanted to keep with her.
Tony never thought he would have depression.
During the week, everything felt like a blur and he was constantly feeling dizzy and light-headed. His soul-mark burned, and its colors, blue, gold, and silver,  ware fading into a gray tonality, sometimes it would bleed too.
Second: this chapter doesn't have much angst, but in the next ones we will have a little suffering, so prepare yourselves.
“Just to make him suffer more? Not Pep ”
So he planned to let Bucky in Wakanda's care and then find a way to kill a supersoldier.
When they arrived at the compound after a few hours of flight, Vision and Pepper were waiting for them in the landing area, greeting them politely and indifferently, the message was clear, passed through with only a hard look.
Tony just wasn’t in the mood to have more mistakes in his mind, all the blood that he has in his hands is enough, he didn’t need the freedom of the avengers in his mind.
Tony knew he didn’t stand a chance from the start, but from the moment Rogers turned Steve and he started responding to Tony’s jokes sarcastically instead of getting angry Tony realized he was really fucked up.
At night, when Pepper wasn't there and Rhodey was sleeping in the couch while Tony worked on the workshop, Tony would ask himself what would kill him first, his soul mark or his heart, that was very damaged because one of his not so dead soulmates chose to put a shield on it.
So why did Steve feel like something was breaking inside him?
Shortly after, Tony, in one of his check-ups, discover something: bond rejection.
So Steve stayed, still not sure why yet, maybe to help Bucky, maybe because he knew that it would just infuriate Tony more, giving up like that after everything this fight cost.
So Tony stayed away, physically when the news came and emotionally when he was forced to stay close to him.
Steve did not understand why. He got what he wanted, didn't he? It was hard that they had to deal with political problems, the Accords, but Steve didn't care, not that, he had gotten Bucky back.
At night, alone in his room in the compound, Steve was going to ask himself if he had a chance… If he should give this feeling a chance, even if they were not destined souls, the feeling was real and Steve knew that Bucky would approve of Tony much easier than Steve himself.
Every fuckying day he would look in the face of his friends and prepare himself for the other shoe to drop.
Tony knew since he was a child that he was not born for love.
“I don't know what you're talking about” Tony commented without taking his eyes off the nanochips he worked on, however, smiling sideways he added “Mrs. Potts. ”
A valid way to explain why he wanted to kill himself so much, suicide tendencies, they would say.
Jarvis stopped him.
Tony was even more fucked up after Ultron, because everyone hated him and didn’t want to listen, so he didn’t even try to stop the inevitable when Wanda agreed to enter the Avengers.
His lungs were also not in the best condition, and under Pepper and Rhodey’s disapproving gaze, Tony adapted his armor so that the air circulation wouldn’t be a big problem.
The two times he'd been in VR recently had been designed to inspire terror. This one, as a hospital program, was the exact opposite, meant to be a relaxing, soothing environment for the patient and their loved ones. Steve supposed the scenario was tailored to the patient's wishes, because what he saw when he opened his eyes inside the simulation didn't look like a standard choice. He would've expected some natural landscape, the kind of thing most people found soothing but only ever saw in VR. Sunlight, flowing water, trees and grass. Instead, he found himself in orbit.
"You were there with me that night. You saw how much I enjoyed it," Steve reminded him. "There was nothing false about that. I doubt there's an actor on the whole planet who could be that convincing."
Tony let out a deep sigh, and turned to lie on his back. "No. I
Tony drew a rattling breath and coughed weakly. His eyes opened, but there was no recognition in them, only distress.
Tony shifted away from Steve, clasping his hands together behind his back. "It's not like they'd drive me away with torches and pitchforks, if that's what you're imagining," he clarified. "It's just this quiet resentment, those glances that say they wouldn't be too sad if I tripped and fell head-first into one of the chasms. I disturbed the peace of their gateway to the underworld, beneath that very city, and laid my hands on the ancient technology. Even though there's no church to condemn me in this land, they still see it as a kind of sacrilege."
Steve tried to figure out the timeline in his head. The drones had invaded the workshop while Stane's mind was still somewhere in the middle of the transfer and re-frame process. He'd probably be waking up in the new clone any moment now, but after that, he'd need time to settle in and catch up on the time he'd missed; the backup would be from last night, so he wouldn't know anything about what had happened today. That actually made the situation more hopeful.
"Yeah, of course. See you on the next mission," Tony said, sounding distracted, and hung up abruptly.
“You wouldn’t want tiny-Tony to be all alone, would you?” Tony said accusingly. Without waiting for Steve’s answer, he hopped onto the bed to pick up something that had been hidden from sight behind it: another cage.
He'd taken the elevator to the entrance floor and stepped out of it, just out of habit, before it came to him that he didn't actually know what he was going to do next. He felt like he should take action, somehow, but it was a pre-mission night and he only had thirteen hours before they'd head out. Eleven before he needed to be back at HQ to get ready. There wasn't a whole lot he could do right now. His team members were out spending their night off in whichever way they saw fit, and even if they hadn't been out of reach, he wasn't about to break his promise about not discussing the details of what he'd heard with anyone.
With the reminder of the world outside, the memory of Steve's conversation with Peggy came rushing back, and suddenly he felt foolish for having spent so much time just having fun. The lingering afterglow was entirely gone.
Stark answered it.
"You can't do this! Ultron! Stop them! Do something!" Stane commanded.
Tony sighed and raised his free hand to rub at his face. "Yeah, I know. Even if we take that offer, life won't be easy. They're still holding all the cards."
The dinosaur took off again at full pelt, and Bucky held on to Stark and their unlikely steed for dear life.
"It's okay, never mind," Tony said, trying to move away, pulling his arm back to himself, his body tensing up next to Steve's.
Finally, he died, suffocating from the bleeding caused by shattered ribs, and again, death wore Tony's face, his expressive eyes full of disappointment.
Luckily, there was a good solution to the issue, and her name was Pepper Potts. Pepper already had a positive attitude towards soulmates, she was the mother of this whole idea anyway, and really, Tony thought her gig as his PA didn't let her use her full potential. She could be the fresh and stunningly beautiful face for the new, benevolent Stark Industries. It was a perfect match.
He'd avoided doing this for four years.
It reminded him of the time when he'd first read that damn paper back in 2008, because just like he had then, he felt like on some subconscious level, he'd been waiting for this day to come. It made him seriously want to grab a bottle right now, but that wasn't in the cards, what with them having to babysit the living embodiment of an ancient Norse god.
The place looked like a scene from the war, Steve thought. Almost like someone had dropped a napalm bomb on the building. He could only guess at what it might've been like when it'd been still standing, earlier on the very same day: a small warehouse, mostly built of wood, with a corrugated iron roof. Now, there wasn't as much as a single section of wall left upright. It was a mess of rubble, pieces of burned timber and bent, blackened metal. Here and there, the rubble glistened with moisture, thanks to the FDNY's efforts to control the fire, but he could also see smoke rising from several spots. The firemen had said there would probably be areas left that were smouldering, and warned Steve to be careful, but they hadn't stopped him. Captain America tended to be given a lot of leeway when it came to such things.
"Were they American? This could be important," Steve pressed on.
"You came looking for me," Tony repeats, an unreadable look on his face.
It hadn't even crossed Tony's mind that the man wearing the costume might be a flawed one that held just as many secrets as Tony did.
"Sure."
"That's not what I meant," Steve returned, more seriously. He took off Tony's cap, flicking it to the desk, and ran his hand over to Tony's forehead. "Are you all right? It's like you've got a fever."
Steve didn't sit down, but took up pacing, his eyes skimming over the decor. The gold-trimmed velvet curtains, ornate furniture and carpets were probably worth several months' salary. It might've impressed him more if he'd been feeling less grouchy. It wasn't just that Tony was somehow constantly one step ahead of him. He was also angry at himself for getting so worked up about the whole thing, and that translated into an irrational annoyance towards Tony, as much as he was also intrigued by the man. All in all, he was failing spectacularly at staying objective and detached.
There was a blinding flash of light and an ear-splitting boom, and in the fraction of a second before the pressure wave knocked him out, he had just enough time for the regretful thought that if Steve made it, he would probably blame himself for Bucky's death.
"I'm going to remove this gag, and you're going to answer one question for me: how do we get that door open? If you value your life, you're going to answer it, and not try to call for help," Steve snarled at the guard. He was bluffing, of course; he'd never actually murder someone, no matter how furious he felt. He hoped he was convincing, anyway. "Nod if you understand."
Steve stops where Tony can just see him.
"I'm pretty sure it's just superficial," Rhodey said.
The officials had seemed relieved to hear that Cap already had a plan for how Tony could compensate for the harm he'd done, and that he was willing to oversee the process. If they'd known of Steve's personal involvement with Tony, their opinion would certainly have been different, but as it was, they now had an arrangement that satisfied all parties. To Tony, it felt like it was more than he deserved.
Pepper was frowning at him. "If you're matched, he'll feel it, too," she said. "You should test it so you'd know for sure. Maybe this is something else. There are theories about partial matches and synchronization that's not DNA-based and other things like that."
Iron Man did, tracing the length of Steve's cock in the same cautious way he'd been touching everything else, then smearing the pre-come at the tip all over his shaft, and wrapping his fingers around it to give it a tentative stroke. It was nothing at all like the rough way Steve would touch himself when jacking off, and yet, it felt a thousand times more exciting.
"You don't owe me anything, really. Thank you." Steve closes his sentence with another kiss, a quick peck on Tony's cheek, and then stands up. "I'd love to continue what we started—there are so many things I want to try, all these ideas I've got, and I intend to get back to it soon. First, though, I think we need to take a time-out and deal with Stane."
Steve and Tony were kissing, and it looked as if they’d forgotten that they weren’t alone: unrestrained and extremely enthusiastic. They were all over each other, bodies pressed together and hands roaming over clothes. The earlier heated argument had given way to comments like “you drive me crazy.”
For a moment, there was just tense silence that stretched on, Steve lying down, Tony sitting next to him, looking away, his expression distant. This wasn't how Steve had meant this to go, even if it had cleared the air between them.
As soon as the
He really doesn't deserve any of this. Not after what he did to the other SR100. The reactor is a heavy weight in his chest that hurts beyond physical pain, a brand burning with blue fire that marks him as a murderer.
"I meant, my genome's not in the database," Tony clarified.
"Looks like we have our first destination, then," Jarvis concluded.
"It's done," she announced.
Tony thought there was something he should remember, something important, just on the tip of his tongue. Something about the dream.
With his arm flung over his face, he could see a vast expanse of space, stars blocked by the alien army in front of him, monstrous machine-beasts and spacecraft too large to comprehend, an assault force that could take over Earth in a matter of hours. He shuddered and pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes instead. The vision shifted, the colorful blotches behind his closed eyelids coalescing into a radiantly smiling face, handsome, blonde and blue-eyed—and almost as intimidating as those aliens.
"Agent James Barnes. My closest friend," Steve clarified.
"What do you mean?" Steve asked, rubbing at his eyes because he definitely hadn’t been micro-napping.
With the morning drawing closer, there's slightly more light by now. Steve gets up. One last sprint and he'll be out of here.
"Ouch, I think that's enough mangled idioms for one conversation. I'm heading to the quinjet. Going to try to get some work done," Tony said, the floor creaking as he took a step towards the door.
He'd barely told anyone here about it: he'd mentioned that he'd lost a friend in the crash, but he hadn't mentioned Steve's name. He wasn't sure why he was telling Stark. This had to be a coincidence, and he shouldn't let it ruffle him.
"No, really, I'm fine. I'm sure I'll feel better in the morning." Steve started walking towards the elevator again.
Tony grabbed it and and passed it to Seren. "Go," he told her. "Hurry." She'd know what to do. The other dinosaur prisoners depended on her.
Steve had told Tony that he didn't want to talk about this topic, let alone listen to jokes related to it, but that kind of thing never seemed to make any difference when Tony was concerned. Tactful was one word Steve would never use to describe him. He realized he was grinding his teeth, no doubt turning the expression on the tough face he wore even more harsh. Tony liked poking fun at him, and it was easy when he was already worked up about other things. He forced himself to loosen his jaw.
In spite of what Tony had just said, it felt very familiar, the shape of Tony's mouth and the softness of his lips against Steve's exactly as he remembered them. The way he responded was different though, the touch of the hand he placed on Steve's back featherlight, his lips parting only slightly. Steve didn't push it. Tony was in a new frame that he'd only had for a few hours. He didn't want to overwhelm him.
Steve had misread it, after all.
Matched or not, he still cared for Tony, just as much as he had before.
On the 100th floor, Steve stepped out into a large, brightly lit landing with doors to a dozen other elevators. Some of them were public, others led to private levels only accessible by passing bio-ID scanners. The public one that ran the lowest should, according to the signs, take him to the 50th floor, so he chose that.
"You don't need to thank me. I know you would've done the same. You already did, in a way. If you and the others hadn't gotten me out, I'd still be a bunch of inert data in a high-security storage vault." Steve switched to run his hand over Tony's arm, hugging him closer.
Steve took Tony's fingers deeper, working them the same as he would have with Tony's cock, and with his other hand, finally captured one of Tony's nipples, pinching it lightly.
Bruce sighed and covered his face with his hands. He neither wanted to nor needed to see this, but he couldn’t leave, either, because the protocol required an observer in case of an emergency.
Slowly and cautiously, Steve peeled off Tony’s shirt, asking him to raise his arms so he could work it over them. As was to be expected, Tony winced at the movement, verbal complaints giving way to harsh breaths hissed between his teeth. Once Steve was done and got a good look at Tony’s bare torso, he grimaced as well. The pattern of reds extending over Tony’s ribs on the left covered an area larger than Steve’s hand. The effect looked disturbingly like tendrils reaching towards the arc reactor.
Steve sat down next to Tony, folding his arms on his lap, his eyes on the fire. His words, when he spoke up, were muted. "I'm sorry."
"It was real, all of it, Tony, I promise," Steve tried.
"Thank you," Steve repeats. He was prepared to take the phone and go look for a signal himself, but he is truly grateful that the Finn will do that instead, so he can return to Tony right away.
Tony tightened his hold around Steve, pulling him even closer. Then, he took a deep breath and started again. "So, there was this one time, five years ago…"
"He's alive," she said, blinking and focusing on him. "But probably not for long. Happy, can I borrow your screen? You should all see this."
"Another coat and a hundred coins in cash," Steve said. In reality, that one single coat was probably worth more than all the clothing in the stall put together, but he wasn't going to get greedy. He just needed something fast.
Steve remembered that time they'd been staying at the Bartons', and Tony had refused to share a bed with him. He'd regretted it, back then. Now that the roles were reversed, Steve definitely wasn't about to decline.
"Tony?" Steve asked, dismayed.
“Yeah, you don’t need to tell me that,” Tony said. He rested a hand below the bruising and took a deeper breath, which instantly turned into a gasp. “You’ll want to poke at it, won’t you?”
He couldn't kiss Tony better, but there might just be something else he could do.
"Not that it makes a difference to me. If I had a soulmate, they'd be dead by now, right?" Steve had to check.
Tony sighed and flipped his hand around to lace his fingers with Steve's. "Okay. That does help a little."
All his past anger at Steve feels entirely meaningless and petty. Steve was trying to help him, wasn't he, in his own condescending way? Tony should've taken it for what it was, and put aside his grudge for at least a few days. It's obvious that the situation would look very different if they hadn't gone their separate ways.
"Eh, that's okay, your meeting seemed important. I hope that emergency wasn't anything too serious?" Steve asked.
He started fucking Tony slowly with his fingers, going on until Tony let out a whine that didn't sound entirely happy.
Steve makes a face. "Unapproved prototype. Probably too dangerous and risky to be allowed out there. That's like me, then."
"You had me worried for a second there," Pepper said breathlessly.
Steve looked her up from the crowd. She was maybe five years old, and smartly dressed, with her hair in carefully arranged curls. He guessed she must've been outside when the fire started.
"That's not a gripping story, either, no great adventure. I drove myself too hard, expected my body to handle things that were too much, so that the exertion and heat and dehydration got to me. I ended up too exhausted to stay on my feet, and we had to abandon the expedition. I thought it'd pass when I got back home and had some rest, like these fits tended to. It didn't. It just got worse.
"I swear I'm not," Steve said truthfully. "And I also don't feel sleepy at all anymore. Maybe you could tell me another story?"
"Anyway, he was still alive when the drones took him, right?" Steve checked. That was what Rhodey had implied earlier. If he didn't know whether Tony was alive, at least there was a chance that he wasn't dead.
"One minute."
He could rest. Everything would be all right.
He'd seen how it looked when people were injected with the original Extremis nanovirus, the screams of pain and the glowing skin. Just as he'd been promised, there was none of that, only a faint tingling and warmth at the IV site. He imagined he could feel the Exvec solution flowing along the vein in his arm, into his heart, then spreading all through his body, into every capillary, every cell, burning away those parts of his genome that said 'Steve'.
"Long and productive day with the police, Cap?" Ultron's contemptuous voice greeted him as he entered the limo.
With the combination of Tony's skill and the sensations that were skirting the edge of almost too much, Steve didn't last very long at all. He grabbed handfuls of Tony's coveralls as he started to come, the back of his head thunking against the wall, his back arched away from it. He expected Tony to stop, but he didn't. He kept going, licking and sucking even more intensely, as if he wanted every last drop of Steve's come, swallowing it down.
It was clear that Tony, just like Ultron, thought there was more to Steve's day than what he was telling, and no wonder. He knew his tracking data for the day would look suspicious, with glitches and discontinuities here and there. There wasn't anything he could do to fix that, so he'd just have to hope Tony wouldn't push the matter. Later, if he managed to gain Tony's trust, and learned to trust Tony himself, maybe he could reveal the truth about what had happened. Unfortunately, the one brief conversation he'd had today already made him think he might've been overly positive about that.
"Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but if my heart stops, I can't will it into starting again, no matter how much I want to," Tony said. It was melodramatic and unfairly irritable, but he had no patience left for platitudes.
Steve couldn't even begin to guess where he was, and it was unnerving, but he wasn't going to give that away. "How long?" he asked instead.
"Hey, it's okay," Sam calls out to him, trying to sound as soothing as he can. "We're not too late, Tony. He seems stable."
He was too late, and too slow.
"Right, right, you have a history of almost a hundred transfers," Randall noted, his smile still in place. "Well, this will be old hat to you, then. Just follow my directions, please."
Tony moved his fingers ever so slightly to curl them around Steve's hand. He could feel the tap of Steve's pulse under his forefinger, and he realized it was perfectly in time with the background beep of the heart monitor. He absently wondered why Steve would be hooked up to one if Tony was sick. Was Steve sick, too?
"I think that's enough, Steve," Natasha's voice suddenly spoke up in Steve's ear, startling him. "Just hold on a few more minutes and we'll be there."
On some days, he was accompanied by local engineers and scientists. Those were his least favorite days, because he had to be careful about what he was doing, just in case they were smart enough to suspect duplicity. When they asked him what he was building, he told them a half-truth.
Steve seemed to be consciously letting go of the anger and anxiety; Tony could feel it in the slow deep breaths Steve was taking, that Tony was subconsciously mirroring, although Tony's had a slight unhealthy rattle that Steve's didn't.
"I certainly can't imagine it being much more intense," Steve said.
"He insisted on the VR visit?" Steve asked.
If Steve ever sees a glimpse of the thirium reactor when Tony's not quick enough to cover it, he never comments on it. And since Steve doesn't ask, Tony can't make himself explain it to Steve.
He wasn't as practiced as Tony was, and he hadn't done this in some time. Even if Tony was smaller than he was—pretty much everyone Steve had ever met had been—he couldn't take Tony's cock fully in his mouth. He took as much as he could. One of his hands was enough to cover the rest, leaving the other free to run circles over Tony's hipbone and tease his balls as he started working on Tony's cock.
Staying out in the open would only make it easier for the drones to spot him. He needed to keep moving. He hadn't known this part of town well in the past, and now it was even less familiar. Picking a direction at random, he started jogging east along 168th Street, then taking several turns to side streets. He earned an occasional glance from the few passers-by that he came across, but most of them were minding their own business.
"You're selling yourself short, but you're also not wrong. I'm starting to get a little desperate," Tony admitted, pouring himself another two fingers of whiskey. "Thing is, I've lost two clones in as many months. That leaves me with another two in store, in addition to this one," he pointed at himself with one thumb. "They're growing new ones as we speak, of course, but it takes time. This is cutting it closer than I'd like, it's a stupid waste of resources, and I don't particularly enjoy being assassinated."
"This is weird, but it wasn't weird to have your highly educated personal assistant do it?" Steve asks him.
"Huh, look at that," he commented, glancing at Tony's face with raised eyebrows and a grin.
Tony had been wrong.
Steve's lips quirked into something that wasn't quite a smile, and the nostalgic feelings Tony got from him seemed to catch a different timbre. "Things used to be so much simpler before the ice. I never believed in soulmates back then. Never wanted one. I did think I'd like to have a family, though," Steve said wistfully. "Now? I don't know."
"We have to get him out," Happy said, giving voice to everyone's thoughts.
"I wasn't conspiring against them," Steve said. He couldn't believe Tony had bought that. "There was a conspiracy inside SHIELD, but I wasn't a part of it. Surely you know me better than to believe that I'd work against them!"
"That first time we met, I wasn't even looking for you. It was pure chance that we crossed paths," Steve said, slowly, considering each phrase. "The second time, at the inn, that was on purpose. I found out where you were, and decided to come to you without the costume, since you didn't want to talk to Cap. But I really wasn't expecting the rest of it."
"Thank you, Chloe," Kamski says, and waves her away.
Embarrassingly, he felt relieved once he got into the corridor, away from Stark's demanding, desperate gaze. Still, his mind was a tumult of uncertainty.
"Probably, yeah," Tony admits.
"I'm just glad to see you're better," Steve says, keeping it sincere and straightforward. "I thought you were dead, when I found you."
Jarvis and Jan had been wrong; it wasn't about the Mayan culture. It made a lot more sense that the word on the note Steve had found was a name, maybe even a signature. He couldn't help wondering if Tony's two friends had purposefully not told him about her. He could easily imagine Jarvis doing that. Jan, not so much, but Jan had genuinely seemed to not know very much about the expedition.
He needs to understand what just happened, how Steve could just ignore all of Obie's commands like that, but he feels himself slipping. Each feeble beat of his heart feels like it could be the last. The room is growing dark around him.
"It's a lot more complicated than that, but you don't need the gory details." Fury waved a hand in the air. "Does the name Hydra mean anything to you?"
He believed in justice, and in everyone being treated fairly and equally. In a world where Hydra held most of the strings, there was no guarantee one would get those going through the official channels, so they would have to be proactive, even if it required breaking the law. Whether or not he'd been ready to murder Stane just based on what he'd suffered himself—which had broken several laws and been downright villainous in every way—he certainly was after hearing what Stane had done to Tony.
It turned out that was another thing Steve could add to the long list of surprises Tony had in store that night.
To prove his words, Steve closed the gap between them and pressed his lips against Tony's.
Hearing Tony say his name was simultaneously exciting and distracting. He'd told Tony his name. His real name. Tony hadn't given his. If Tony found out he was also Captain America—
"You're not going to sell that as some kind of an altruistic show of goodwill when you did it because it happened to suit your needs," Steve pointed out. "So, let's get on with it. What do you know about these assassins so far? How did they kill those two clones?"
Maya wouldn't have it. "I don't want to show my face around—I'm sure you understand. It's this, or I go to ground, and you get no answers."
"Okay, I'm not doing anything yet, just taking position," Pepper warned him, and something cold and hard pressed against his neck, at the base of his skull. Every instinct in Steve's overstressed mind told him to fight it, to lash out at her, to run, but he dug his nails into his forearms and kept his head down.
"Talk about closing the circle," Steve said, keeping his trained outward appearance of calm, although his stomach was full of butterflies.
"I'm afraid she's currently busy, Mr. Stark," a feminine voice that wasn't Miss Potts replied over the intercom. "Anything I can help you with?"
Steve huffed at him, making sure to pout when Tony glanced up. "Okay, I was wrong. Clearly you're confused and don't know your way around my frame," Steve complained.
"I have no idea who you're talking about," Ultron said.
"I don't need help. I just need sleep. I'm fine," Tony protests. He tries to move away, but Steve's grip is too firm.
All thoughts of his goal pushed to the background, Steve hurried to Tony's side. From the corner of his eye, he saw one of the drones that had followed them to the room make a move in his direction, only to be held back by Stane.
Steve walked over, trying to shake off his shock. Tony had only ever met him as Captain America, and would have no idea who he was. This could be a great opportunity to learn more about what was going on, but he'd have to tread carefully.
"It may be a cliché, but that doesn't mean it's wrong," Steve said. "I don't know if you realized it back then, but I didn't hook up with you because of your fame, fortune, and pretty face. It was because you were great company. When you weren't annoying the heck out of me."
Steve wasn't quite sure what Tony had been so worried about, and he didn't find out. Sure, Tony's come was very warm, too. It burned a little at the back of Steve's throat, like a good strong chili. That was actually nice. Definitely strange, but in an enjoyable way.
"There are treatments that slow down aging considerably. Not common, but easily available, if you have the money. See, Obie didn't want me dead or senile. I was extremely useful to him. Best engineer SI had. You saw his drones? My handiwork, as are a lot of the cars, and the planes, and the shuttles. Did some work for SHIELD, too. And you must've met Ultron? He wouldn't exist without me, either. So, yeah. Obie wanted me in working order. I think a couple of times he must've brought in a specialist to delete some of the more traumatic memories. I'm not sure because I don't remember." Tony shrugged, as if that wasn't bad enough to merit more than a brief mention.
Steve managed to catch hold of Natalie to ask her a few questions, and her story was in line with everything Tony had said, and what Steve had seen. Regarding the shooting incident, her answer was also cautiously supportive of Tony's opinion. "I don't know him that well, but I've seen nothing to suggest he'd want to do such a thing," she said. "You should ask Pepper, though, she knows him a lot better."
Pepper rummaged through the duffel bag and came up with a pair of rubber boots and an oilskin coat, which she handed to Steve. "We can't take the direct route because because the streets are being watched, so we've still got around half a kilometer to cover," she explained. "Do you think you can walk?"
This couldn't be happening. Steve couldn't have come all this way and finally found Tony, only to be too late by a matter of minutes.
Well, shit. That might actually be a loophole. Tony doesn't remember the exact instructions he gave, but he wasn't expecting an android. He can only think of one reason for such a visitor. Kamski must've sent it. Maybe he already has an answer for Tony. He could've just called, like ordinary people, but he probably finds that too mundane.
"Uh, no, it's just," Steve stammered. "I think I should get out of this thing first." He nodded down at himself in a vague gesture.
"Not really, no." Steve wondered if he should, for further insight into the case. "One or two issues, way back before the war. Why?"
Steve could guess what Tony meant. He'd been afraid of Steve's rejection, and probably of losing the friendship that they both cherished. But especially now, after Tony had sacrificed everything to make sure that Ultron stayed contained, he wouldn't accept hearing such words from Tony.
He realized this gave him an opportunity for some snooping that he'd been considering earlier. After the amazing night, it felt even worse to do things behind Tony's back, but then again, Tony was also keeping things from him. They'd even talked about this and accepted it.
Fury nodded. "Yes, I've always assumed you were."
Tony wrapped both arms around Steve, pulling him closer, clinging to him like his life depended on it. Steve didn't want to land on top of him, so he kept one elbow on the bed to balance himself, and placed the other hand behind Tony's neck, running his thumb over the coarse bristles of Tony's beard.
He breezed through the additional safeguards set up to protect data from VIPs. These were particularly high-profile individuals whose data wouldn't be offered for research use even in anonymized form, and wouldn't be shared across companies and countries to get higher population coverage, like regular entries were. If Steve was in the database, that was where he'd be.
"It's fine, I'm used to this by now," Steve said. "So, is there any way to delete those backups without physically traveling to Luna?"
"Not sulking," Steve said, and stood up by the table, taking a commanding stance. "There was something I wanted to tell you all before we head out. It's about this mission. I have reason to suspect that it might not be what it seems. Unfortunately, I don't have anything more concrete than that to give you, but I'd like to ask all of you to take extra care out there today."
Steve.
"Hey, Stark," he shouted. "Did I say you could stop?"
Tony raised his eyes towards Steve again, apologetic this time. "I'm sorry about that. I wasn't sure you'd believe me, or what your intentions were. Besides, if you'd tried to detain me, I might've hurt you."
"I've read plenty of papers about synchronization, and it's not the same for every pair," Tony explained. "This has to qualify for the more intense end of the spectrum."
"Jarvis," the not-butler said, without elaborating on what it was that he actually did, and shook Steve's hand firmly.
"Steve Rogers," Tony repeats. He knows of one person with that name who, now that he thinks of it, did bear a resemblance to the android in front of him. "As in Captain America, the World War II hero?"
Steve kept his eyes closed, pretending to sleep, while listening intently. Tony would probably not expect Steve to be able to hear the other half of the conversation. In reality, it was easily loud enough for him to hear every word.
Steve was pretty sure he knew what the answer would be. "Have you done that soulmate gene test?"
Tony made it sound like that had been a major motivation behind all his adventures, but that wasn't something that'd been in his magazine. Steve had never heard that there'd been anything wrong with him. And whatever it had been, it was obviously in the past now; after the Fountain, he seemed to heal faster than anyone Steve had met.
"I don't care about that," Steve assured him. "I used to change frames like shirts. It's the person inside that counts."
He blows out a breath and turns his attention to what's in front of him. In his hurry to storm away, Steve left behind the rucksack that he was digging through earlier. Tony realizes it must be a parachute container; the fabric that's currently tangled around his legs would be the chute itself. Since it wouldn't have enveloped Tony on its own, Steve must've wrapped it around him. That thought brings back his earlier anger.
"I know you think what happened to you is more of a curse than a blessing," Steve said softly, "but it's not all bad. I'm so glad you're all right."
Steve quickly undid Tony's fly, and asked him to raise his hips off his seat so he could get rid of the final items of clothing. He tugged down Tony's jeans and his briefs in one go, dropping them on the floor, and paid no heed to the fact that Tony's cock was entirely soft. Either that'd change, or not. The last thing he wanted was for Tony to feel like he needed to perform for Steve's sake.
Even though this amounted to little more than rumors, it made so much sense, Steve didn't doubt its truthfulness. It explained why those two thugs had been at Maya's apartment. Finally, Steve could at least come up with some kind of an overarching theory: perhaps the mobsters who'd funded the expedition were angry at Maya and Tony because it had failed, and were trying to retaliate. It didn't quite sit right, though. Steve couldn't see why a criminal organization would want to support an archaeological expedition in the first place, and more importantly, if that was the whole explanation, what was going on with the fires? As a means of punishment, recruiting some mysterious burning man to hunt down the offenders seemed inefficient and pointlessly showy.
Pepper shook her head. "No, I'm on secure mode. Untraceable. We're fine."
Of course, Tony would've taken precautions. The question was, would he have done this before or after the last fire? None of Tony's friends had mentioned talking to him after he'd first gone into hiding, after the fire at Maya's apartment, but clearly, Jarvis must've been in touch with him at some point.
That took Steve by surprise, again. "Oh, maybe that's it. You look remarkably like him," he said quickly, trying to cover it. "I'm Steve." He held out his hand.
"Fine. Let's get it over with, then," Tony said.
"You needed the rest. As did Captain Rogers," Jarvis said. Steve couldn't help noticing the AI was showing the same kind of initiative that Ultron had, just for a more benevolent reason.
Unsurprisingly, Tony hasn't woken up while Steve was away. In fact, if he's improved at all, Steve can't tell. Tony's breathing and heartbeat are still almost imperceptible and extremely slow, and his skin feels just as chilly as before.
"They'd been corrupted beyond recovery. It was top of the news for a while back then. No one ever found out who did it, and there are still conspiracy theories around. Some people think Tony was behind it," Miss Potts said.
"I know, I know," Tony just said, hanging his head.
Howard had told Steve some scholars thought there were many more soulmate pairs out in the world than the lucky few who had found one another. There might even be someone for everyone, but if these people were randomly distributed across the world, most of them would never meet.
Tony sits back, biting down a curse.
"What for? No connection here." Tapio spreads his arms to motion at the cloudy sky.
"I know," Tony says. "And Iron Man's coming with you."
"He's not going to die," Steve said. "Not if there's anything I can do about that."
One turn brought him to a wide but very empty stretch of street with the unmistakable figure of a drone only around fifty meters away from him. He froze in his tracks. After the first second of panic, he realized that although the design wasn't too far off, this was much taller than Ultron's drones, and matte black in color except for the gray SHIELD logo on its back. Hoping that this drone was on a regular patrol or after some street-level criminals instead of looking for him, Steve backed away as slowly and noiselessly as he could and picked another direction. As soon as he estimated he was out of audiovisual range, he took off at a run again. Every corner he rounded after that had him expecting the worst, but there were no more drones, neither SHIELD's nor Ultron's.
He had all this gene technology at his use, with some of the world's best minds on his payroll—Stark Industries' biotech division had grown way past being a glorified high-tech dating service. They were involved in plenty of medical genetics research. Diagnostics and therapeutics. They were good enough at it that they'd probably be able to rid Pepper of Extremis.
Steve sat back, crossing his arms. "Why would he put his backups on the Moon?" That was the last place he would've picked; he was used to thinking of Luna as a mining outpost with more drones than humans.
This really, really wasn’t how Bruce had expected this argument to end.
"No, he doesn't seem to be," Natasha agreed, shifting to lean against Fury's desk in front of Steve. "He did bring you out of storage prematurely, though. That's something. He didn't need to do that, and it can't have been easy to convince Hydra to let you go."
It's pure chance that it's Sam's turn so that he's around when it happens. He's just entered the room carrying a sandwich and a cup of coffee when he realizes there's a new kind of tension in the air.
He'd been taken in his sleep. Even though he knew he should be safe here, the idea of how helpless he'd be when he fell asleep was deeply unnerving. He thought of what must've happened earlier in Stark Tower: maybe he'd been sedated to make sure he wouldn't wake up, and then Ultron's drones had moved him from his bedroom to the VR suite. Maybe Stane had been there himself to plug Steve in, that cruel smirk on his lips.
“You’ll probably feel more comfortable sitting up,” Steve offered. He placed one hand on Tony’s shoulder, ready to guide him to rest against the nearest wall.
"So, you see, there are reasons why I never tell anyone this particular story," Tony concluded, his hand brushing Steve's arm lightly under the blanket.
Steve opened his eyes, clambered out of bed, hurried into the shower, and spent quite a while there, trying to flush the memory down the drain. This was completely unprofessional. He shouldn't be thinking about Tony like this.
There was another pause, probably because Tony waited to be sure Steve was done. When he started messaging again, it wasn't at all what Steve would've expected.
********************
"What happened to Jarvis?" Steve asked, returning to the earlier topic while he went back to seeing to the wound. "Did he make it through Ultron's counter-attack?"
Taking a look skywards still revealed no sign of police vehicles, or of Ultron's drones coming after him. It was surprising. There was no way Tony wouldn't be tracking his frame, and that meant the drones would inevitably find him at some point. He was going to fight them when they did. He wasn't sure if the SI-built guns he had would let him fire at them, but he'd come up with something.
living on the Plains—that's a type of primitive horse—but so far I haven't heard of anyone training them for riding."
"Free him," Tony repeated, waving a hand towards Pearly-eye.
The conversation stayed with Bucky after he left the dungeon and Stark behind. He still managed to catch a few rays of the setting sun himself when he climbed up the stairs. Deep in thought, he made his way across the courtyard to the canteen, to join the other young resistance members who lived in the compound for the evening meal.
Tony gave Steve the most genuine smile he'd seen yet, and patted him on the back. "Well, that was a first day's work well done. You saved me. Thanks, Steve."
She was the kind of person he could see himself spending the rest of his life with. He'd never want to have a casual thing with her, like this friends-with-benefits situation he had with Tony. He couldn't deny that he was a romantic, deep down, and the fact that Tony didn't really feel anything for him left him craving more. Of course, it wasn't as if Steve was madly in love with Tony, either. Maybe he would've liked to call it a proper relationship, but he couldn't imagine it ever becoming a serious one. Tony was attractive and probably smarter than either Steve or Peggy, but he was also shallow and irresponsible. The ideals that Steve strove towards weren't something Tony cared about.
"Oh," Tony said, visibly disappointed. "Guess I'll head back to the shop, then. Catch you later, if you still want the company."
"Yes, I am! How did you know?" Steve exclaimed, his tone high out of pure excitement.
Hulk roared, a bone-shaking rumble loud enough to wake the dead. It didn't wake Tony.
Steve skimmed through the list, and sure enough, the name he was looking for was on it. "Mr. Stark was at your party," he noted aloud.
Steve sighed in frustration. He already knew what that cognitive conflict was. He hadn't realized it could turn into a practical problem like this. Based on all his previous experience with VR, a mismatch between the subject's mind and the outside reality wasn't usually an insurmountable issue. Unfortunately, Tony's current frame was everything but normal; it was so old, had been through so much, and it was his original birth body to start with, without the flexibility of artificially created frames' nervous systems.
"Someone's past is a thing we don't tend to talk about," Pepper reminded him, placing a hand on Natasha's shoulder.
"That's very kind of you, Miss. I realize this is a lot to ask, but is there, by any chance, a phone here that I could borrow for a moment? Would save me the trouble of driving around and visiting all those places," Steve tried, his smile firmly in place.
"Is he, now," James returned, clearly not convinced. He took hold of Tony's arms and twisted them behind his back to shackle his wrists as usual. "Come on, then. Let's get you to your cell for a nap."
He let go of the wheel to press the heels of his hands into his eyes, willing that awful vision to go away.
"You've got it!" Tony started moving, his face a mix of intense focus and glee, his eyes half open, one hand stroking his own cock. He definitely wasn't holding back; once he got into a rhythm, he was riding Steve's body so hard that Steve would've hesitated to go so rough if he'd been the more active partner. It was more than enough to tip over from nice to amazing, to make his mind forget he was in a frame that wasn't his own. All there was were two bodies enjoying each other, and everything else was just insignificant background noise.
As a precaution—mainly because of Tony's distrust towards Fury and his people—they hadn't shared the location of the secondary hideout with the resistance. Clint wouldn't know where they'd gone when they hadn't been able to stick around at the workshop.
"I hope yours aren't too trigger-happy," Hammer returned. "Come, the table's set."
"Of course I do!" Tony exclaimed, spreading his arms. "Why the hell would I kill myself? I'd know it'd be a futile exercise. No, I'm sure I didn't want to do it. More than that, I'm pretty sure I even know how they made me do it. It was some kind of implanted suggestion, slipped in through a VR link. See, I usually avoid any kind of VR hookups outside of home. Call me paranoid, but you never know what's in there. So, of course, the one time I break that rule—I think I've learned my lesson. Never mind how expensive the setting or how much they praise their safety measures."
His breath caught at his throat, and all the strength seemed to leach out of his new legs. Randall stepped in, offering Steve an arm for support, and it was all he could do to let himself be led back to the bed. He realized he was trembling.
"And did you meet him more than once?" Jarvis went on.
Luckily, going by the android's lack of response, it's either shut down entirely, or very badly damaged. That makes things a lot easier for him.
There was nothing at the hut to suggest Tony having stopped by. It doesn't look as if he's been here. Steve considers the possibility that he might've gone somewhere else instead, but this hut is the only building Steve has seen in any direction from any viewpoint. Tapio confirms that: "No house, no hut, only mountains and lakes and reindeer until the town."
The last time—the first time—Tony had had to put an IV on himself had been back with the whole palladium poisoning crisis. It wasn't exactly a well-practiced skill, and it took him quite some time to get it right. It might've also been that he wasn't in a particular hurry to get it done. He did get the saline lock taped to his arm eventually, without too much bloodshed.
Bucky was annoyed at Stark. What had he been thinking, trying to make a run for it like that? He must've known he couldn't get very far here, alone, tied up and unarmed, against Bucky and the other five Resistance guerillas. He hadn't wanted to harm Stark. They needed to get him back in one piece; he'd be no use to anyone if he was badly injured, let alone dead, and as long as they were traveling on foot, they needed him fit enough to walk and not slow them down too much. Luckily, Bucky's skills as a sharpshooter had not disappointed him, and all they had to deal with was a graze on Stark's shoulder.
A female voice broke through the haze of pain in Steve's brain. "I'm so sorry, Steve, I know you must be feeling awful, but we have to move. Come on."
Steve hummed in appreciation; the fingertips were definitely among the most sensitive parts of the frame, making this feel much more exciting than attempts at nipple play.
If Tony thought that everything that'd happened over the past few days had been a virtual scenario, then he might assume Stane had learned a few things about their last night together. Maybe Tony had even mentioned it to Stane earlier, over his decades in captivity. But Tony didn't know everything that had been going through Steve's head back then, because he hadn't shared all of it with anyone.
He'd already spent too much time doing nothing.
One of the receptionists joined him to show him the way to Tony's suite, although he would've known how to get there on his own. Not because he'd woken up there earlier—he'd left the clinic through the private exit, back then—but because he had memorized the blueprints for their failed attempt to take down Stane. For a brief moment, he wondered what would've happened if they'd succeeded, but quickly pushed aside that train of thought. They'd play with the hand they'd been dealt. No point in speculating.
Steve turns to face him, his expression stern. "Saving you from getting kidnapped. You're welcome."
Tony didn't let him finish. "You think I'm just going to flee and let him destroy everything I've built here? I'd rather go down fighting."
"What now?" Rumlow called out irritably.
"There's no need for that. It's no more dangerous than any of the traveling we've done so far," Tony assured him. "You just focus on enjoying the rest of your trip, and I'll see you again when you get back home."
"I can't begin to imagine how you feel after everything that you've been through, and I sympathize, I really do," Obie says, and gives Tony's shoulder a squeeze. "It's just that the stock market doesn't."
To start with, he drove over to the police precinct where Bucky was currently stationed, and stopped on the way to pick up sandwiches for lunch. It was around midday, after all, and he could use a bite.
Tony was gazing at Steve with the big brown eyes that were the most striking feature of his youthful face. The height of Steve's frame meant that Tony had to look up to face him, and he did it coyly through his lashes. "Well, I can't promise that I can help you stay grounded, but if you need any assistance in familiarizing yourself with this particular borrowed body, I'm your guy." He ran his forefinger down Steve's front, tracing the edges of the defined muscles that were clearly visible through his skin-tight shirt, and then up again, bringing his hand to rest at the back of Steve's neck.
"Good morning to you, too," Steve replied, maybe a touch gruff, and stepped in, the door closing behind him.
The drone that had been restraining Steve stepped back, releasing its hold. Steve slid out of the chair right away, but didn't move beyond that, waiting to see how the situation developed.
Making use of the enhanced strength of his frame, Steve caught hold of Tony by the armpits and hauled him up. Tony let out a little squeal of surprise, but didn't resist. Steve lay down on his back and brought Tony to sprawl over him in a wonderful tangle of filthy, naked skin.
He was all alone in a world that he didn't recognize anymore.
The man grimaced and spat to one side. "No clue. The further from here, the better."
"Sure." Happy pointed his watch towards the nearest clear stretch of wall, projecting a generic background image of a starry sky on to it. Pepper got up to join him there, and Steve and Rhodey followed.
"I'm flattered at your trust," Steve said, with open sarcasm. "I guess I haven't got much say in this?"
If Ultron and Tony wouldn't let him go where he wanted to, he was going to have to get creative and make his own way.
"Any influence at all would be more than anyone else has," Natasha said.
Tony stopped, sitting back and looking up. "Too much?"
Steve stared after her for as long as he could see her, and then at the silhouette of Crabb Castle. It felt foolish to just walk past it, when Tony might be there right now, but the plan was the plan. He kept walking.
“Uhh, guys,” Bruce’s uninvited, timid voice cut into the conversation.
He knows there's a building somewhere out here, although he doesn't know which way it lies anymore. Nothing he can do about that. He just has to keep going and hope for the best.
Tony set his glass on the sofa table. "Wow. Pepper really left everything to me. Okay." He put his palms together, pressing his fingers over his mouth.
"Confused, and weirdly turned on," Tony blurts out, rubbing at his chest. "I've got so many questions, starting with 'what the hell was that?'"
Steve wondered if Tony had only run the test now, or if he'd known about this for much longer, and only told Steve because something had changed.
Steve doesn't want to turn his back on Tony again, even briefly, afraid that he will take a turn for the worse while Steve isn't there, but he has no choice. He has to find a way to get in touch with the outside world.
********************
"Is that what you want?" Steve asked.
Steve shook his head. "I don't know if he'd go for that. He's not particularly sympathetic towards others' suffering."
Now that he thought of it, it occurred to Steve that unlike every other time he'd been this close to Tony, there was no echo of emotions that weren't his own. The only hint of what might be going through Tony's head was the tired, resigned look on his face.
"It was complicated," he told Sam.
"You should leave that for later and try to rest. Tomorrow's going to be another long day," Steve said, even though he knew it was pointless.
The air smelled clinical, just like it always did in the frame transfer unit.
"Great idea," Steve agreed. He got to his feet, considered his stained fingers for a moment, and decided that he could clean his slacks easily enough later. He kept his eyes on Tony as he kicked off his shoes, slowly worked open his fly and freed his so far neglected hard-on. His clothing wasn't particularly tight, but it still felt great to be free of it.
"No. That's not possible," Steve blurted out. Tony had been twenty-five when Steve had ended up on ice. That, plus eighty-five—no. Tony looked old, but he certainly didn't look like he was over a hundred. That couldn't be right.
"That depends entirely on the company you keep." Tony winked at Steve, his smile growing warmer.
"What's that? Want me to stop?" Steve checked, pausing for a moment, resting his hand where it was.
"No. That's not why I'd do it. It's because the way I see this, out of the two of you, you were far more likely to make a difference in the world if you survived. That's the rational reason, anyway. I've got be honest, that's not all there is to it. There's also how I feel. I can't bear to think that you'd have died there." Steve's fingers squeeze Tony's.
"Oh, sure. That won't change anything, but if you'd like to hold his virtual hand as his body dies, I can do that," Ultron replied.
To his surprise, although they showered together, it was mostly just that: washing, without Tony taking the initiative towards anything more steamy like he usually did. He must've been even more taken aback by Steve's frame hiccup than Steve had realized.
