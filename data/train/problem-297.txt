Right now, Sherlock would give anything to let John knows he was human. Had always been, even if he had always been scared to show it.
He craved to touch John. To tell him he loved him.
"I don't care." John shrugged to himself, "I don't care that you didn't find me sooner. Because I would've died in there." He took a moment, thinking quietly. "Maybe I would've preferred that you hadn't found me. It was nice. He had knives and guns all around. Would've taken me absolutely nothing to run a blade in my heart or pull the trigger at my temple.”
”John."
And catch up on all the comments. Sorry, guys, Camille and I love your comments I've just been too busy and she doesn't have an acc. Hugs to all of you, thank you for reading our crazy, crazy story.
John’s mind filled with Sherlock’s familiar voice. The same voice that had coaxed him through nightmares before. He exhaled slowly, unconsciously as he calmed. Instead, his dreams filled with Sherlock. Baking. John smiled, seeing the small strip of flour that he’d managed to get on his ridiculously high cheekbones. He watched himself move closer and use his thumb to wipe it away before playfully smacking the man. “I though chemists were supposed to have steady hands and all.” He watched himself check on the pastry while Sherlock whisked another batch. He sighed, content as he turned in his sleep, facing Sherlock unknowingly as he did so, the smallest, serenest of smiles gracing his face.
Rose for lovely Camille and her talent to put up with my inconsistent responses and missed deadlines.
There’s a difference between care and cared. JW
bit was a lie- and Sherlock probably did, too. But it really was the ultimate goal. Stop loving the man who bedded someone behind your back. The saddest part of the entire matter was that John had a small velvet box hiding in the drawer where he kept his old army uniform- somewhere that Sherlock would never look. The doctor turned and walked away once more, deciding that he'd simply throw the ring away, just like Sherlock had done to John.

couple would only hurt the two further. John looked at the kitchen table and at the ring that rested on top of it, sadness filtering through him once more and his eyes dimming. He cleared his throat, clasping his hands together before separating them and clenching and unclenching them singularly. "Sorry, that was... a bit not good."
“Why?”
There, on the sink counter, was a clear plastic bottle full of a dubious-looking liquid.  It was labeled, clearly with Sherlock’s writing in permanent marker:  JOHN.
“I didn’t say
“That is
“What?  You’re saying all of this” - he waved his arm over the body - “was...how recent?  Wouldn’t he have showered or something since then? Lemon?”  He was vaguely aware that he was spluttering.  Watching your flatmate nearly lick a corpse will do that to a man.
“No, no!  Think!  There are
She let Sherlock pour her tea as she studied John.  “That was good work on the barman,” she said, crossing her legs and sitting a bit sideways in her chair.  “I’m beginning to think you’re useful to have around.”
Sherlock hadn’t moved.
“I’m informed Sherlock did a bit of amateur police work,” he continued.  Mrs. Hudson had picked up some pastries at Mrs. Gant’s bakery in town, and Mycroft was eyeing the bag.
“Yeah.”
thought John.
“Did she...” he began.
.”  He copies my voice on the last word.  (He’s getting quite good at affecting my voice, actually.  It’s rather comical).  He pets at me a bit more, his fingers in my pubic hair, which has become rather crusty.  “Shower?”  He asks.  “Come on.  I’ll do your back.  Then, a nice hot meal.  And later?”  He elbows me a bit.  “I’ll do
“No. Just one.”
Sherlock smiled and brought his hands up, one roaming over John’s thigh as the other took hold of the fur-lined object.  The sensation of fur against the sensitive skin of his penis was almost ticklish, but not quite; instead, he could best describe it as soft, soft and warm, but not in the way a hand or mouth was.  Keeping his eyes closed, he focused on the different sensations produced by various pressures and speeds; moving the muff up and down on his cock felt a bit different from actually thrusting up into it.  It wasn’t tight by any means, and he wouldn’t be able to actually achieve orgasm from the act, but it was intensely arousing.  He was vaguely aware that John was touching his legs, running his palms over the hair on his calves up to the fleshy part of his thighs and then inward to fondle his testicles.  The inside of the muff was beginning to get slightly damp and he was ready to abandon it for something
He gave Sherlock’s nipple one final tease before sliding his hand down, tracing his ribs, and stopping at his trousers.  Sherlock’s breathing quickened.
“The tuba.  Her name is Brünnhilde.  Don’t tell Mycroft.”
, John,” he’d say, “when it’s the facts that matter?”
Sherlock smiled softly at him.  “It’s the 31st, John.  Time to sell this place.”
“Well, yes.”
“What could possibly be
Finally he arrived at the black plastic tarpaulin covering the east wing hallway.  Fuck it, he thought, and, as quietly as he could, peeled the tape away until he could slip past.  He palmed his torch and stuck close to the wall, trying to calm his heartbeat.
“If this is your way of telling me you won’t run off headfirst into danger, it’s not really working.”
“Mmmmm.  10.”
“You’ve made a fortress,” said John as he climbed under the duvet and Sherlock turned off the table lamp.
“No!  Just...don’t.  That would be...” John trailed off, surprised at his own reaction.  “All wrong,” he settled for at last.  “It would make you less recognisable, though.”
“Of course I do,” John replied, hoping that he was revealing nothing of his romantic interest in Sherlock.  That sure as hell was
“My father had a full head of hair at the end of his life.  Same with my mother’s father.  Turned silver, of course, but remained an unruly mop long into their eighties.”
“Casual questions or serious questions?”
“Not shaving.  Well, wait.  Maybe his chest was shaved.  The armpits weren’t.  Neither were his legs.  Or his pubic area.  A professional job, surely.”
Sherlock shrugged.  “I find printed text more stimulating than visual media.  The brain is the biggest sex organ,” he added.
Sherlock stared at the book, eyebrows drawn together, before crossing to John and taking it in his big hands.
“Yes.  In
And then, Sherlock groaned, the sound sonorous and sinful, and dug his fingers deeper into John’s hips.  That, too, was different.  No woman had a voice that deep or hands that strong -- or that large.  He’d always found Sherlock’s hands beautiful. Seeing those hands earlier wrap around both of their cocks, pressing them together to fuck within the circle of his fingers - well, that was extraordinary.  Feeling those hands on his body now, holding him in place, was somehow comforting.  He felt owned, protected: two feelings he rarely experienced.  John had never felt owned by Sherlock, regardless of how much he followed the detective’s lead, and John himself did most of the protection -- it was Sherlock who ran headlong into danger.  Now, however, with Sherlock’s hands on his hips and Sherlock’s mouth on his dick, John felt adored, loved, safe, treasured, possessed.
“Don’t know.  I’m not an archeologist, and the church that housed all of the records burned down in 1748.  It’s been empty for a very, very long time.  Come on.”  Sherlock elegantly skipped from one stone to the other, making his way over to one of the towers.  John could see a spiral stone staircase within.
He did his normal bedtime routine, including stretching the resistance band, put on his pyjamas, lit the gas fire, and sat down to read his book.  Within moments he was asleep.
There was something pathetic about seeing a man’s life bundled up into containers. John found himself close to tears, suddenly and painfully reminded of the soldiers he’d served with in Afghanistan and the pathetic parcels of books, clothes and personal belongings they’d left behind.
John summoned his Watson resolve and walked past the large pool and back to the dark recesses of the warm, steamy area which currently housed a very naked Sherlock Holmes.
“I wondered if you can tell me if your sisters went to see him.”
“What are you doing?” John mumbled, not bothering to move.
“How long have you been there?”
“Don’t you need me to…”
Maybe it was foolish to think that they’d ever be together romantically, he thought that night as he lay in bed, staring at the ceiling.   What they had was good.  They loved each other.  They were fast friends.  It was enough.  Wasn’t it?
“I do
John couldn’t help it.  He began to laugh.
psychosomatic) he noticed his whole body had relaxed but not in a sleepy way.  He felt revived.  A bit blissed out, but revived nonetheless.
“Coming?” asked Sherlock.
Then he went to sleep and slept soundly.
Sherlock smirked.  “No.  Now come and kiss me goodbye.”
John’s feet must have made his decision for him, for he quickly slipped through the door and closed it behind him, hoping he hadn’t been seen, before clambering over the fallen stones after Sherlock, who had disappeared into what remained of the building.
“Good.  Wait, what?  What exactly do you plan on doing?”
John ducked into the shop and patted the head of an old wooden horse that had somehow lost its merry-go-round companions.  Mr. Chapman called her “Bessie”, and she stood guard next to a small display of Mr. Campbell’s local honey.
“Which makes me fifty-eight.”
“Dr. Watson?  You’re home in the UK. I’m Dr Janice Fellows, one of the trauma doctors at QEH.  May I call you John?”
John scratched his chin.  He didn’t know whether to be disturbed or impressed.
Sherlock reached for John’s hand, pulled him closer.  “That was the first time we’d done that,” he said.  “Came together.”
Thanks to every one of you for reading.  Now, here comes the bad news: I'm caught up in the writing process, and I will be going on vacation next week, so it will likely be a few weeks before I can write and post chapters 19-22.  In the meantime, enjoy the fact that the boys will be smooching in the garden until I return.
John slept late and woke up starving.  He was on his second bowl of cornflakes when Mycroft sauntered in.  He’d rolled his shirtsleeves up to accommodate for the hot weather, but was otherwise dressed in finely tailored trousers and waistcoat.  John wondered if the man even owned a pair of shorts.
“I’ve ridden before,” groused John as he fastened his helmet.  In what must have been the most awkward moment he’d had in awhile, John tucked his collapsible walking stick in his backpack and clambered onto the back of the bike.  He was painfully aware of Sherlock’s proximity.  It was the first time he’d been this close to another human in months.  He felt around for a place to put his hands other than Sherlock’s waist, which just seemed too intimate.  John tried to put some more room between their bodies and realised there was nowhere else to go.
“You said something.  Just then.”
John began to walk to the back patio, where he could take a look at the fountain and swimming pool, when he heard Lestrade call back.
“I’m not your personal nicotine dispenser,” grumbled John.  “Go and buy your own.  Carry them yourself.”
“I am
“Please spare John any incriminating stories,” Sherlock said.  He actually looked mildly embarrassed.
“So pointless,” he was saying.  “And ugly.  These are not going back on this bed.  Neither is this,” he said, tugging at the enormous damask duvet.  Too hot.  Too bloody...fluffy.  But these sheets” - he ran his hands over them after wresting the giant duvet to the ground - “these sheets will do quite nicely.  For tonight, at least.”
“Have you touched your prostate?  Made yourself leak?”
She made a little humming noise before turning toward the small car park.  Thank God she didn’t offer to carry it.  He’d nearly died of embarrassment when an elderly woman on the train attempted to give up her seat for him.  “This way.”
“Did he offer you money to spy on  me?”  Sherlock’s eyes were wide and furious.
The first thing he registered was the smell -- the odour of a living human body that had been cooped up for too long without fresh air and a good shower.  The second thing he knew was that he was being tackled to the ground by that body.  In the dark, he grappled with someone quite a bit taller but not as strong as he was -- it wasn’t long before he had his assailant on the ground, with his knee in his lower back and his arm twisted behind him.  He was pleasantly surprised that his body remembered what do to, damaged limbs and all.
Sherlock took John’s hand, wove their fingers together, and held it.  John let him.  They both sat there, staring at the offending ladder, both unable to express the depth, complexity, or intensity of feeling.
John’s awakened by the sweet, deep rumble of his laughter.
John complied.  “Do you want me to…?”  He looked for the lube but didn’t see it.
John sighed.  What did he really want?  A wife, a house in the suburbs?  A child?  A dog?  Did he want to date again, go to the cinema and dinner?  That all seemed so mundane now, so beige. So
John Watson, in normal circumstances, would not be surprised by what lurked unseen under trousers and shirts.  He’d seen it all, and, as doctors have learned to do, kept a straight face at all the interesting – and horrifying – things people kept hidden under their clothes.  He’d seen skin of all sorts – the old, the young, the sun-damaged, the stretched, the dimpled, the scarred, the tattooed, the infected.  He’d smelt death and putrefaction.  He’d lanced boils, held distended intestines, been puked, pissed, and shit on, stitched ragged flaps of skin together, even treated a truly horrifying case of genital herpes all with a straight face and doctorly precision.
“The violin!  What happened?”  John is certain he’d prefer to be woken up in the middle of the night by the melodic strains of a violin. Anything would be better than the rumbling bass of the tuba.

Sherlock had caused all this. It was his fault. But if the detective left, if he didn’t take up the bad-guy in the game by pretending he’d kill in the if so situation, the doctor would see no point in staying alive. And if there was one thing Sherlock could never be able to take, it was John's death.
..." John took in a shuddering breath, not having enough time to debate his next words "--Love you." His already-closed eyes stopped moving from behind the eyelids as the doctor felt the life run out of him.
Sorryyy for the late upddattesss. Camille is awesomeeee. We should all pray for frannnceee.

"Max. You knew. You didn't tell me." John angrily walked up to the man, gripping his collar and pinning him to the wall, "Why didn't you tell me, Mycroft? Just another bothersome thing for you to avoid because we're all silly little goldfish? You bastard!”

John felt his eyes roll back as he began falling down, the whole room silent all of a sudden- six words ringing through his head as he did so.

Glancing to the bathtub, he only saw John's legs laced with his own, their laugh. The scent of soap and shampoo. But he didn't see Max. He felt him, like a shadow ready to come back if he focused on him. Still, the first memory he had was with John.

He never truly did. The doctor found himself walking towards 221B. Not for Sherlock- no. For Mrs Hudson. Right now, he needed a place to stay away from the prying eyes of anyone around him and he was sure that the landlady would invite him into her guest bedroom for the night. He unlocked the door- hating the memories that the simple action brought back. John averted his eyes, assuming that Sherlock had gone off with his boyfriend and left his flatmate alone. Good. John wasn't Sherlock's boyfriend. Not anymore. He had been once- but never again.

When he saw Max, the heart of the detective stopped beating. It meant- It meant John...
John Watson had just had a row with the chip and pin machine. And then he’d been nearly run over by the idiot London traffic. And then it had started raining. In short- John Watson was having a terrible day. He had gotten off work early, at least, planning to surprise Sherlock with the biscuits he’d brought him- knowing that it was the only thing that the detective would eat without being forced to have food shoved down his mouth.
John woke to a warm body beside him and a head resting on top of his. Of course, he panicked immediately but forced himself to calm. Sherlock. The man was breathtaking when he wasn't actively trying to kill John. And perhaps- he was breathtaking even then. John's shoulder ached as he moved the tiniest bit, earning a rough growl out of the doctor before forcing it stifled.
He knocked on the door to 221A, clearing his eyes of tears the best he could and walked in when he was invited for dinner. Mrs Hudson had made flatbread pizza but John was in much less of a state to eat and more of one to simply cease existing. He excused himself to the bedroom, claiming that Sherlock had done an experiment in the doctor's room (though the two of them had started sharing the same room a year or so after Mary had died)- who in turn had been left without a place for the night. His landlady smiled and left him alone, going back to the kitchen to resume her own supper.

Anyone want to set me an update schedule? I could do it once a week, you could choose the day. Apparently, I just need to be held accountable.
Sherlock was trembling from desire. Finally, finally, Max had managed to reach him. To frustrate his body enough for his mind to be blurry in arousal. For the time being, he didn't think about John. He thought about his lover's hands, slowly teasing his transport, touching and kissing and always avoiding the places he needed the most. Sherlock's thighs were shaking, but he didn't beg, his jaw locked as his eyelids fluttered rapidly, unable to hold still. His hands clenched the sheets under him, and he muted his moans by biting down his lip. Max laughed jokingly, and Sherlock felt something breaking inside him. His body tensed up without anymore contact, curling up around nothing, and a ruined, disappointing orgasm was ripped through him. "Aaah-Ah." He breathed out heavily.

It didn't matter. John stayed kneeling, gritting his teeth as harshly as he could, knowing full well that he had the perfect amount of time before he went into hemorrhagic shock. The room spun as John used his right hand to pull up the left, earning himself a pained shout. There was no one else to do it. Hell, if Sherlock actually had retained the information in his mind- the detective not really caring of anyone other than himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
Max waited until his boss left the room. Then, a shaky breath escaped his lips. He left John alone, hurrying as quickly as he could toward the cell holding Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
John felt his head spin, eyes defocusing before he blinked harshly, bringing himself back using pain as determination. The wound had cut through Johns shoulder neatly and the amount of bleeding was usual for such wounds. But still, it was familiar. Horribly familiar. John looked at it closer, his back also bleeding down and into and onto his jeans. The bullet had gone through his scar exactly, not even a millimetre off. Through johns unending hate, the man duly acknowledged how good of a shot Moriarty was.
"Oh! Sherlock Holmes! How many times have I told you not to scare me like that?!" The wolf only bared its teeth at her, still growling. John, on the other hand, was still freezing, still shivering, still on the floor, still very much in shock. His body didn't bother doing anything, frozen as his mind attempted to comprehend this new... knowledge? Discovery? Whatever this was, it was racing, trying to categorize the information. Mrs Hudson petted the top of the creature's large head a few times before setting the tray on the table and making her way out with a, "Don't get into any trouble, you two!" Long after she left, the room still swamped in darkness, illuminated by only the moon and a few sparse clouds reflecting the light, John was still on the floor, staring at the wolf with wide eyes. Sherlock. Sherlock. It approached him, careful and gentle, shoving at his shoulders until the doctor complied, sitting up. But apparently, even that wasn't enough. Sher-- Sherlock tugged on his shirt, half dragging him and half forcing the doctor to crawl to the detective's bedroom. It jumped onto the mussed bed, letting out a short huff before it moved, giving John space, too. The doctor warily climbed into bed beside his... flatmate and... could honestly not help relaxing into the warmth of the bed, the duvet thick around him. He closed his eyes briefly, taking in deep breaths and relaxing as he succumbed to the softness of the mattress and the bubble of heat he created due to the blanket.

John hadn't answered, and Sherlock's mind got wild. It was out of control, imagining everything that could have happened to John, and especially the worst. It was a rainy day, in London, and John was desperate. Sherlock got up from his sofa, paced into the living-room. Walking without knowing wouldn't bring John back, but it would make him less feel as if he was useless. He needed to act. Needed to do something. Sherlock grabbed his coat and left the flat, without even warning his landlady. Once outside, he shivered. It was getting cold, and night was falling on the city. Sherlock felt his heart aching in an odd way. The scent of the rain was mixed up with this feeling the night would never end.
Where my lovely friend Camille has gotten Mycroft to get on all of our nerves. And Sherlock, too. They're both cocks. And she's a fantastic writer.

CAMILLE MADE A TRAILER FOR THE FIC ITS AMAZING AND HEARTBREAKING AND I CANT EVEN:
Despite Max's best attempts, he didn't manage to get the curled haired man up and back at home, so, instead, he sat down next to him silently. People stared. Some of them recognized the once famous detective, but they didn't dare to say anything under the cold glare of the only man that would ever stay by him.
John made his cup of tea, subconsciously making enough for two. His scowled at himself for being so open by Sherlock. Truth be told, it wasn't really the detective that John had to be a prick to. Obviously, the fact that Sherlock was Sherlock was a part of it- but in general, John forced himself to be cold and distant to those around him. He had reverted back to how he had been when Sherlock had died. Sad. Lonely. Dead. Only difference this time was that
Sherlock didn't do this so that John would love him. He knew it was impossible, he no longer deserved the doctor. Did he ever deserve him? He nodded twice before starting to walk, the action neither a confirmation nor a dismissal. There was an actual hospital not so far from the fake one, and Sherlock believed John could make it. He was bleeding much, but not quickly enough for him to go into shock before doctors could fix him. "I'm sorry I didn't manage to find you sooner.”
i should've probably done trigger warnings but i also consider trigger warnings to be spoilers. and aren't tags enough of a warning? you know what you're getting yourself into when you come into our angst-ridden world. 🍯 here's some honey for you, you poor things.
The thing came closer. John quit his frantic movements, knowing it was hopeless as his survival instinct kicked in, telling him to shut the hell up. The doctor bit down on his tongue and looked away, watching his breath as it turned white and disappeared in front of him. The air was cold and so was John, but that problem was so soon forgotten that it felt as if it hadn't been a problem in the first place. For fuck's sakes, there was a ginormous wolf staring him down, cold was nothing compared to the fear in John's heart. Call it a fear, call it a phobia, but wolves were more than a simple nightmare to the doctor.
So, yes. I care. SH
And then, finally, he glanced to Max, barely conscious, and John who... Guilt was heavy.
John reeled back, pulling himself away violently from the detective as if he'd been burnt. He had been. He had been burnt, branded, and scarred.
The detective reached up, running his fingers through the fur carefully, before taking the dog tags in his hands, rereading them and making sure that his conclusion was true. That this was John Watson. Sherlock forced himself to relax, closing his eyes briefly as he tried to slow his breathing. Cautiously, he reached up, scratching the underside of John’s chin lightly, listening and categorizing the purr he emitted carefully into his mind palace. The wolf relaxed further on top of Sherlock, almost all of his weight holding the detective down. As time passed, the two flatmates stayed that way, drawing warmth from each other, one having too many questions while another didn’t have the proper mouth to answer.

And suddenly, John couldn't breathe at all anymore.

He couldn't grab them, couldn't realize what was going on, but the atmosphere was sweet and soft, comfortable as comfortable when John stroked his curls for hours.
Sherlock himself looked as if he hadn't slept in months- but that couldn't have been possible. He had been with Max. Max would've taken care of Sherlock. John balanced Sherlock off of him, propping him up straight before standing. He bent again, slipping a hand under his sleeping detective's neck and sliding the other under his waist. He ignored the way his body protested, carrying a weight while being so weak. It didn't matter. John concentrated on Sherlock, quietly moving him to his bedroom as he laid him down and pull the duvet over him. He closed the door and walked out, settling a kettle on the stove and forcing himself not to think too much.
“So we’re looking for a tall, flat-footed man.”
“I suppose those are all legitimate concerns one would want to know about a potential lover.”
It was after one such row relatively early in their friendship where John flat out asked Sherlock if he ever had any biological imperative to have sex whatsoever.
“You really do have quite the memory, don’t you?” asked James.  “Yeah, that’s the shoulder.  If I just apply pressure here, it gets the energy flowing.  Here,” he moved his thumbs slightly to the left, “is the trapezius, and here, the deltoid...”
“Sounds like a good party trick.”
I breathe him in.  I
“Yes.”
“I don’t know,” said Sherlock pensively, popping a cherry tomato into his mouth.  “I imagine I’ll just have to wait and see.”
“Any exercise?”
John cosied up behind him, pulling the duvet over them both.  “That was lovely,” he said, kissing Sherlock between his shoulder blades.
Being familiar with male nudity meant that
“Yes!  It started that way.  But then you got involved.”
“Of course you do.”
“And if he does?”
Sherlock laugh-sobs and wipes at his eyes, sitting up.  He takes a few ragged breaths and sobs some more.  Tears are now coursing down his cheeks; his nose is running, and he sounds like he’s dying.  His body seems caught, no longer differentiating between joy and agony.
John snorted.  “Oh yeah, and what’s that?  Flowers?”
_______________________________________
John couldn’t help but marvel at the sheer size of the place.  He couldn’t believe that someone actually still privately owned it for single family use, that it hadn’t been turned into a stately home or something.  He hefted his bag again and slowly followed Mr. Holmes’ assistant up stone steps led up to a formal doorway; shapely pruned potted evergreens stood sentinel at either side of the massive oak door with glass insets.
Sherlock turned the still-damp boot over to show John the sole, which he had apparently cleaned.  “Registered design number.  Bit hard to read, but still decipherable.”
“You also got him to shower.  And eat.”
John smiled and closed the door behind him.
“Can’t you just go in there, whisper something in her ear, and coerce her with your charm?”
“Ow!”
The sheets were covered in lube, he was a wet mess, he hadn’t even touched his prostate, and the toys hadn’t even come within their intended vicinity.  Yet John lay panting and smiling up at the ceiling.  He could handle this whole penetration business.  It was rather lovely indeed.
“Running, Sherlock.  It’s a race of sorts.”
“You would.  I’ve seen you leave chemistry experiments that should not be left.  Small fires in the kitchen.  You know.  ‘Unimportant’ things.”
Sally inhaled and for a brief moment looked as if she were going to stand up and leave.  Instead she focused herself.  She swallowed hard, then began.
“Yes, of course.  Quite regularly, if I remember.  I used to be quite close with Lydia, who ran the library.  She told me all about it, how handsome Mr. Holmes would have the little ones eating out of his palm.  There’s not much to do here, you know. The children were bored, and their parents were more than happy to sit down with a magazine for a bit of peace while he read to them.  Mr. Holmes opened up the world for them.  He loved it, he did.  Loved young people.”
“She’s staying at Rainna’s,” John tells Sherlock after waiting to see if his daughter will apologise.  She doesn’t.
Standing, Sherlock stretched and popped his back.  “It’s not a rotten idea.  It needs to be done.  I want to know.  I don’t generally sleep when I’m on a case.  Wastes time, slows down my mind.  But time, I suppose, isn’t exactly a factor here.”
His romanticism sometimes earned him some good-natured jibes from his fellow soldiers, and even now, when he rarely met up with his old army mates, John was regaled with half-true stories of his sexual prowess.  (Watson, you short arse bastard, how the hell do you do it?  It’s the doctor thing, isn’t it.  It’s got to be).  And he’d smirk, raise his bottle, and drink to the bodies he’d healed with his hands and pleased with his tongue.
“No, Sherlock, it’s not.  It’s yours.  And your brother’s.  And Mrs. Hudson’s, Molly’s.  Lestrade’s.  Your parents’.  I don’t want it.  It’s meant to be shared, I think.”
“You’re just saying that.”  She looked down and rubbed dirt off one knee.
John could nearly hear Sherlock’s eyes rolling.  “That’s plainly clear.  My point is
“Or you can thank me, since I bought them.  Bloody expensive, too,” said John.

John frowned for a moment, then began steeping a cuppa for each of them.  “How do you take it?”
“Vigilantism is incredibly intriguing,” mused Sherlock.  “I find it curious, what people find offensive, the lengths some people will go to right perceived wrongs.”
“Exactly.  Distinguished.  It’s usually daisies.  Something that grows in abundance, something kids won’t get scolded for picking.  We used to make chains, Harry and I.  When we were at our grandparents’.  They grew wild, everywhere.”
He moves his gaze from their clasped hands to her face.  Remembers all the times John had called him “mad” and “insane.”  Maybe it was a family trait after all.  He must be losing it.  She clearly has.
With a sigh, he turned on the small telly and stopped thinking for the night.
He froze.  “Sherlock, down,” he whispered.  “There’s someone here.”  Heart pounding with a mixture of unadulterated lust and cautious fear, John sank back down into the water as quietly as he could, the two of them creeping to the edge of the darkest corner.  Earlier, John couldn’t see Sherlock in the pool from the front, and unless whoever had come in got close, he or she wouldn’t either.  John said a prayer that whoever it was didn’t venture into the pool area or go near the VIP rooms where one bespoke suit complete with socks and shoes still rested on a lounge chair  - its presence would pique anyone’s curiosity.
“I despise that word.”
“No,” said Sally, standing and shouldering her bag.  “And I hope she never has to see him again.”
Just then, Sherlock’s phone vibrated from where he’d left it by the microscope.  He retrieved it, swiped the screen and looked at the text.
He tipped it over and shook a bunch of rocks from it.  “It’s full of stones.”  John examined the boot, turning it over in his hands.  “The hook’s stuck in it,” he lamented.
Navya’s fingers were already dialling by the time John made it out of the exit, through the hall, into the spa, and down the VIP corridor, leaving a trail of confused patrons in his wake.
“Mmm-hmm.  Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m meeting someone!  Enjoy your dinner, Dr. Watson!”  She left, looking head-over-heels in love with life.
when John shuddered and breathed out hard.
“Did she tell you anything about what happened after my father called the authorities?”
John nodded. Sometimes Sherlock was remarkably daft.  “Hair or otherwise.  And if you analyse my toothbrush, there will be consequences.”
.  Colleague, doctor, occasionally friend, but partner?  Never.  Even if they were a couple (‘You
hard.  Stretch your lips more.  Use your tongue!”) so he fires off one of his own (“I’ve never had something so big between my legs before”) and Sherlock actually laughs, to John’s delight.
“All right,” said John when he realised Sherlock wasn’t going to elaborate.  “I’m going to make a bite to eat.”  Then, “Would you like to join me?”
“That’s terrible, John.”
John hurried to help him with a cardboard box full of old textbooks, which he set on the front counter.  Mr. Chapman climbed onto his stool and began to lift out the volumes with his large, gnarled hands.  “All of these are outdated,” he said.  “I love to go back and read them, especially the old history books.  It makes me feel old,” he wheeze-laughed.  “Makes me wonder what they’ll think up when I’m gone.”
Changed and clean, Sherlock unlocks the case and lifts the gleaming instrument.  He holds it to his chest and feels a profound sense of relief.  He’s home.
He checked to make sure Lestrade or Molly wasn’t around before spending a good half hour studying the back wall of the enclosed garden.  The entire thing was covered in ivy, and by the time he was finished wrestling with it he wanted to set it all on fire.  It was just too thick and had anchored itself into the crumbling brick.  He was sure the door wasn’t there.  Frustrated but undeterred, he walked, cane in hand, around the side.  Looking up, he scanned the windows.  There was the middle one, the room where Sherlock was.  And the last one, the one that had been Mycroft and Sherlock’s parents’.  Then, it hit him.  The Holmes’ room overlooked the locked garden.  All he’d have to do is go back and look down.  Surely he could see the door that way.
.  His own shampoo is blue, and who knows what colour Sherlock’s is... but what was on that tile was without a doubt semen.  Sherlock’s, to be exact.
was Lillian’s realm.  John could picture her working in here, her fit arms and agile hands working the knots out of everyone’s lives.
Sometimes I am a fool.  Luckily, I have friends, yes, friends, to remind me of that fact.  Every relationship needs a support system, I’ve been told, and I am not so idiotic in the realm of interpersonal relations that I cannot recognise mine: the Detective Inspector, the landlady, the pathologist, and, grudgingly admitted, my brother.  He’s a meddler and a nuisance but he has saved John several times over and for that I have to admit gratitude.  When they give me helpful advice (yell at me), I need to take heed.  Remember, Sherlock.  Do not take John for granted.  Ever.
It was at that moment that their main courses arrived.  The waiter sensed the tension at the table, deposited their plates, and quickly made himself scarce.  John picked up his knife and pointed it at Sherlock.  “If you want to apologise, then
“Are you Dr. John Hamish Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers?”
“It can only hold so much!” Sherlock said loudly, pointing at his head.  “Something has to get deleted!  Until there’s interstellar murder or galactic poisonings, it’s useless information!”
Lillian nodded and smiled at John and Sherlock and left.  The woman sat down, crossed her legs, uncrossed them, crossed them again, and then took a handkerchief from her handbag and actually went about wringing it.
“And this is the hydrotherapy bath..”  She led them past a circular pool where two older women and a man well into his seventies were chatting and laughing as the strong jets worked their shoulders and backs.  John wondered whether or not it was safe for people that old to be in such hot water.  Lillian beat him to it.  “Ten minutes for those over sixty,” she said quietly.  “And no longer than half an hour for everyone else.”  John nodded.  That sounded about right.
“Good idea,” said John, turning to his side and letting Sherlock spoon up behind him.  He liked Sherlock’s solid presence, his warmth, the way they fit together.  John was nearly asleep again when he felt Sherlock growing hard.
Carefully, I raised the oyster to my lips and did my best to slurp it down in one go, like the woman in the black dress.  It made it halfway down my oesophagus before it came back up again.  Mortified, I held it in my mouth.  I would not spit it out; I would not gag or vomit.  I breathed through my nose, holding the little lump of flesh on my tongue.  And something happened.  Something marvelous.  It was all there, the sea, silt, and salt.
heard it.
!  That
“So you’re looking for...a tall, flat-footed man with a dead flower.”  John raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock made some sort of grunting noise and curled in more upon himself.
John relaxed a bit, let Sherlock’s fingers ghost through the hair below his navel.
John smiled to himself, gripped Sherlock again by the hips.  “Is it as good as the fantasy?”
“It’s old,” he said instead.
“Obviously, John.  He’s in the mortuary,” said Sherlock, already roving over the body with the magnifier.
him.  James had changed whatever he had been doing to some kind of rhythmic hand-over-hand thing, and John’s mental train of thought went right where it wasn’t supposed to.
“Never.”  Sherlock smiled.  “Just a bit of pins and needles.”
John looked up at what was, at one point, a fortress of some sort.  Its basic structure still stood, three stories of thick, rough-cut stone, but it had been overrun with ivy; slime dripped from where water pooled and trickled down.  Moss clung to cracks and crevices.  Sunlight filtered down from the break in the forest canopy, casting flickering shadows everywhere. It was almost otherworldly.
“I can’t,” Sherlock announces when Mycroft attempts to persuade his younger brother to take a case of ‘national importance.’  John really cannot fathom what their childhood was like.  It’s amusing to watch them bicker before Mycroft turns to him.
“Hi there, Mr. Owens,” said John in the friendliest voice he could muster as Owens slowed to see if he could be of assistance.  “I’m afraid I’ve got a flat tyre, and my phone’s gone dead.  Do you happen to have a puncture repair kit? Or could I use your phone?”
“You’d better start by getting personal with the masseuses,” advised Sam cheekily.  “You know.  Test them out, get first-hand knowledge of, um, their hands.  I hear James gives a really good toe job,” she mock-whispered.
“Eating, Sherlock,” grumbled John as they toured the Thackray Medical Museum.  “Some of us have to have lunch.”  He and Sherlock had bid goodbye to Mike when Sherlock insisted they stop at the museum.  Apparently Sherlock had visited as a child and remembered it fondly.  John had wanted to go anyway, but he hadn’t counted on the sheer size of it or how critical (and loud) his companion would turn out to be.  The library and resource centre had proved interesting, and Sherlock found several old volumes that interested him, which he showed to John with the enthusiasm of a small child. The two of them poked around for the better part of an hour before visiting the museum’s recreation of a Victorian street replete with all sorts of medical maladies.
John drank in the flush on Sherlock’s cheeks, his kiss-swollen lips.  “You’re shaking.”
He whispers encouragements, groans when I hit his prostate.  He makes the most beautiful sounds, moans and sighs.  He says my name, he says monosyllabic words like “yes” and “love” and “fuck” and all of them are beautiful.  I come in a matter of minutes, gasping against his back.
intimacy, terrifying as it was, trust issues be damned.  He wanted to hold the person he loved, to say sweet nothings to them, to lie, sweaty and sated, within the circle of someone’s arms, hear their heartbeat.  He couldn’t even imagine Sherlock being able to do those things.  It’d be just like him to have an epiphany during a nice cuddle and leap up and out the door, chasing whatever it was that had crossed his mind, leaving his partner befuddled and alone.
“You’ll have to water them rather a lot at first if we don’t get daily rain,” said Molly, taking off her gardening gloves and wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her arm.  “But they should do well here.  And they self-seed, so they’ll come back again and again...even when we’re gone.”
“Oh!  Do you think I make him
close to someone else -- terrified John to his core.  Ella had said he had ‘trust issues’.  He did.  Big ones.  And trusting Sherlock with his heart?  That was a monumental gamble.
.  It might not go over well.)
John could barely see his lover in the dark room, but he manoeuvered himself so they were face-to-face.  “I’m happy,” he whispered.  “You said you love me.”
Step in front of step, the doctor made his way back into the London foot-traffic. There was no point in looking behind him and at the detective. Sherlock's boyfriend was probably rushing to him from their flat. When Sherlock had come from the dead, the doctor had deduced himself that his then-flatmate had wounds on him. Sherlock had winced slightly in every movement he made. Of course, John's mind had also been filled with sadness and hurt- though it was nothing compared to what he was feeling. The then-anger had been so overwhelming that it had cleared his thoughts completely. John Watson was a scary man when he wasn't thinking. He had beat Sherlock, involuntarily ignoring the wounds. (Of course, John had apologized and they'd worked over it, but it still haunted John's mind.)
“What?  Waltzing?”
“...Peaceful.  And this house is…”
John held up the strip.  “There’s barely any hair on it,  you idiot.  It couldn’t have hurt that badly.”
when John became impatient, liked being manhandled and put into position; he’d honestly whimpered once when John had demanded that he get on his hands and knees.  But their lovemaking was not at all routine.  While their individual preferences became known over time, they didn’t seem to fall into specific roles or patterns.  John wondered if they would, over the course of time, but for now, sex was still novel, still raw and full of discovery.
“So she
“Don’t you, I don’t know, have a girlfriend or something?”
“Watch,” said Sherlock again as the head of John’s cock nudged his hole, and so John did; he watched as the thickness of his prick stretched the muscle, as the shaft disappeared into Sherlock’s body.  Sherlock’s breath left him in a great huff, and John heard him groan softly.
“Bit vain, are we?”
Sherlock took them, their hands brushing.
Sherlock rolled his arms a few times, stretching out his shoulders.  John was a good distance away, but he could still see the blue light gleaming off the water than ran down Sherlock’s back.  Sherlock ran his hands over his hair a few times, unsticking it from where it was plastered to his scalp (it was much longer when wet, John noticed) and then walked forward to the “leisure lagoon” where he stepped in, sank down, and disappeared.
Sherlock huffed.  “I cannot figure out how that was supposed to be
“Why didn’t
“You’re not so bad yourself, little brother,” she replied.
“Something I...I’ve been wanting to share with you.”
John had many memorable blowjobs in his life - some in some insane crazy locations by a few of his more adventurous girlfriends - but nothing compared to this.  And it had everything,
He went to sit on the stone bench and cool off for a while.
_____________________________________
John approached carefully, unsure of how Sherlock would react.  It was bound to be an emotional experience, whether the man wanted to admit it or not.  “Um, did I do it wrong?  I pruned them, and fertilized them in early April.  They had aphids, so Molly brought ladybirds and we used a special soap.  Nasty thorns on these...did you engineer those, too?”
Sherlock smirked as they stood up.  “There’s a good man,” he said, sliding past John and into the already crowded aisle.  “Catch up with you soon.”
“I’ll insist you get a pay rise,” he said sincerely as he pocketed it.  “Now, if
The next thing he knew, he was back on the ground, face-down, arms over his head.  No sooner than his body betrayed him than he began to cry, angry tears flowing unstoppably and making his nose run, dirt and bits of leaves sticking to his face as he lay there hating himself.  Toby lay down next to him, as if to say, “Hey there, human friend.  It’s all right.  Happens to the best of us.”
“Yes.”
“You know,” says John as he rights Sherlock from a dip, “it could have been worse.”
“Oh God.  You have a suit fetish.”
There’s something about a man who has been recently sexually satisfied.
The thought bloomed in John’s chest, making him smile and his eyes prick with tears.
John had to remember to close his mouth.  This poor sod was naked in the true sense of the word – all his body hair had been completely stripped, and from the looks of his face, which had been left alone, he was once a fairly hairy fellow.  “Please don’t tell me he died from hair removal.”
He retrieved the tool and handed it over to Sherlock, who shovelled with ease before the metal struck an obstruction.  He got back down on his hands and knees, put his torch in his mouth, and pushed the rest of the dirt away with his hands.  He worked out a stone, and then another, and another.
John meets Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft, Lestrade, and Molly.
Sherlock looked at John and shared a meaningful look before continuing.
“I’m afraid he has been a rather awful barman.”
“Do I want to know how that went?”
In an instant, the look of sentimental concern vanished from Sherlock’s face and was replaced by something born of desire.  “Me riding you on that chair.”
John tried not to jog into the house.  What was he going to do, anyway?  Throw open Sherlock’s door, grab him in a hug, and say, “It’s lovely to see you, mate!”  But anticipation thrummed under his skin and propelled him to the back door, where he met Mrs. Hudson, who was sweeping the patio.
John puffed up a bit.  “I’m not ‘concerned’.  I’m not a homophobe, Sherlock.”
“Coming?” asked Sherlock.
“Yeah.  You could say that.”
“Expenditures!”
“Excellent!  Now, to find us a flat.  Somewhere in Zone 1, no more than 200 metres from the tube; Barbican might work, or Spitalfields.  At a pinch, somewhere near the Silicon Roundabout.  But definitely not south of the river.  A man must maintain certain standards when seeking appropriate accommodation. I’d also prefer…”
“Oh, you
.  Worth remembering.”
“The shape is perfect for a brass instrument,” Sherlock confirms.  “You, for example, would struggle to get anything but a squeak out of it.”
“Not standard issue?” Sherlock dares to query.  It isn’t like John to reveal such personal information.  Was he trying to make him feel better?  It’s a mystery.  Luckily, Sherlock likes mysteries.
John couldn’t disagree.  Yet if Sherlock’s brain were his biggest sex organ, there was no way for John to compare.  He wasn’t stupid, not even close, but next to Sherlock…it wasn’t a fair comparison.  Sherlock’s brain was his most powerful sex organ, and John wondered how he’d stimulate it.  Dirty talk?  Erotic letters?  Explicitly describing his erections in purely medical terms?  He felt doubt and apprehension crawl through him, poisoning his earlier happiness.
“Yeah,” said John, toying with one of the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt.
John smiled to himself.  He imagined himself in Sherlock’s room, in his bed, Sherlock between his legs.  “I’d love to suck you,” said Fantasy Sherlock.  “May I?”  John sighed and adjusted his grip on his cock, his left hand twisting around the head of his prick.  “Lovely,” said Fantasy Sherlock.  “And now, let me lick your hole.  Yes, that’s it.  Relax.  Hmmm.”
John figured they had plenty of time for adrenaline-fueled, up-against-the-wall sex, break-the-kitchen-table sex, or drench-the-floor bathtub sex.
The plane gets closer.  He can see the red and green lights now, although it is still far, far above their heads.  John takes his time.
“Huh.  I always knew you were an uptight arsehole,” laughed Lestrade.  “But I’m not sure I want to know you’ve
“You shouldn’t.  I am a skilled liar.”
“Yes, but not all doctors can be army doctors, now, can they?  It takes a certain skill set, a specific type of person.”
John blinked and remembered to breathe.  “I shave every morning.”
Sherlock gave a closed-lip smile in affirmation.  “We’re going to Willow Cross,” he offered, pocketing his phone and settling back in his seat.
Completely enclosed within thick brick walls, John felt a thrill of excitement, as if he had discovered something special, something distinctively unique.  He glanced up at the second story window, at the room that was once Lilly and Archibald Holmes’.  Was he trespassing?  It didn’t feel like it.  For some reason, he felt an immediate and intense ownership of the place, as if a sense of goodness, of all that was right, was saying,
John tried to read his expression --Was it interest?  Fondness?  Flirtation?-- but couldn’t quite place it.  “Yeah,” he replied, not knowing what to say.  He realised his hands were hanging limply at his sides.  “You weren’t so bad yourself.”  He knew he was staring at Sherlock’s lips, so close to his.  Was this it?  The moment?
Sherlock had asked one time after John teased him about his grooming routine).  Finally, Sherlock emerged with a towel wrapped around his waist, looking pink-cheeked and fully awake.  He whipped the towel on the bed, pulled black pants from where he’d stashed them in the chest of drawers (he always unpacked and put everything in its place, whereas John’s things never left the duffel), and shimmied into them.  John tried not to watch lest his body, which
of the stones, mind you.  We’ll have to find something to put them in.  A plastic container from the kitchen would be fine.  I’m going to need a razor blade, and…”
“You really thought I wouldn’t enjoy myself?” asked Sherlock, nuzzling a bit at John’s neck.   “That I would find you unattractive?”
“Could have got lucky.”
John looked to where Sherlock was frowning away at whatever it is he got all over his hands.  “How much did you lose?” he asked the manager.
John rented a tiny bedsit in Croydon that hadn’t been updated since the early seventies.  It was spartan and cramped, and the alley behind it was usually noisy until 3am most nights.  Sometimes the fire escape rattled, sending him into a panic.  On days that he actually got out of bed, he roamed around town, walking aimlessly, trying to get his leg to cooperate.  His hair grew long, the bags under his eyes became more pronounced, and he didn’t regain the weight he’d lost while in hospital.   He didn’t phone any of his pre-military friends, and didn’t attempt to make new ones.
“Of course not,” replied Sherlock, holding open the door to the hall that would lead to the pathology departmentt.  “Ruins the surprise.”
“Mycroft Holmes,” said Sherlock politely.
“How long were you married?” John asked, sensing the man wanted to talk a bit.
“Well, it’s good you don’t know it, John.  Is ‘John’ OK?”
“Well, why don't you?” suggested Ella.
“He’s amazing,” John said, yawning.
And he had.
Sherlock dressed with precision as John began to explain what he found in Lillian’s “Fountain of Youth” room.  He shook the box of needles as Sherlock buttoned his cuffs.  “She’s got loads of these,” he said.  “What on earth is she doing practising acupuncture?”
Sherlock stopped wrestling with his rosebush and sucked at his finger.  His eyes widened when he saw Mycroft, who sauntered into the garden, looking this way and that.
“Hmm?”
That had been three nights ago and they had said very little to each other since.
“He’s learned all about the daffodils,” said Mrs. Hudson, smiling proudly.  “Next is lilacs.  I do love the lilacs.  Such a beautiful colour, but oh, the smell.  Just heavenly.  And we’ve got three different varieties.  Soon after, the roses begin.”
“For Sherlock Holmes,” he said as John signed for the package.  “He’s back for a while, then?”
“No one is making you take it off, John,” Sherlock says quietly.
“No.  Look, John.  Most murderers have motives, unless they’re completely deranged.  Greed, jealousy, and revenge are the most common.  Fame, sometimes.  Whatever happened in that garden wasn’t premeditated.  Something must have happened, something heat-of-the-moment.”
John unnecessarily held his breath as he moved toward the VIP rooms, and soon he found himself at the very end of the corridor, face-to-face with the door marked “The Fountain of Youth” written in fancy calligraphy.  He took a deep breath, said a little prayer that it wasn’t locked, and turned the knob.
“Besides.  I’ll bet you couldn’t reach your back, could you?  Hm?”  John reached down, found the muff, and turned it right-side-out again.  His hand fit in it just fine, so he dragged it lightly over the exposed skin of Sherlock’s shoulder.  “It’s all fine.  Come on.  I’ll get your back.”
John blinked.  “Wow.  That’s fantastic.”
“Your gardens are lovely,” John tried again.
“So you...” John began to say to Lestrade, when he was interrupted by a quick exchange of bizarre conversation:
John threw the flower at him.  It hit him on the nose.  “Oh, stop that.  It’s just.  I don’t find this sort of thing easy.  Talking.  About the way I feel about people.  That’s all.”
____________________________________
“Nope.  Not doing that again.”  Feeling angry and used, John heaved in a breath and went to sit on the bench.  “Fuck that.”
Startled, he quickly wipes away the evidence.
Moriarty raises his hand, the first two fingers poised to touch Sherlock’s mouth.  “These are lovely lips,” he says.  Sherlock steadies his breathing and holds his ground.  Intimidation tactics have never worked on him.  “You know John thinks so, too.”
“John!  Are you coming?  We’re here.”
“Not particularly,” John replies.  “Do you?”
“And everyone at the clinic will know
Sherlock smiled, saluted, and winked.
“Thank you,” he says.  “I’m afraid I’m rather out of practice.”
“You little shit!  When did you get that?”
“Sure.”
“I can see why you might think that.  Let’s try a bit of both, then.  I’ll do some reflexology, and then show you just a few simple relaxation techniques.”  He looked mildly uncomfortable.  “I’m, uh, not used to an audience.  Usually I just do my thing.  Feet are feet - the rest of the person just kind of disappears, unless the client has specific concerns.  Are you familiar with a reflexology chart?” he asked Sherlock, who had crept from his corner and moved around to get a better view.
“Still good?”
Owens said nothing.
Neither man sat.  They stood there for a moment, the men sizing each other up.  Mycroft clearly wasn’t military, but something about him spoke of power and authority.  “You bought me clothes,” said John at last.
Also, written in two days and only slightly beta'd and Britpicked, as Ms. Bettyswallocks is on vacation and this was my last day to write before I gear up for work.  So any errors are my own.
He rapped lightly on Sherlock’s door, noticing that the tapestry that had once covered it had been removed.  He heard Sherlock mumble something from inside that didn’t sound like a dismissal, so he let himself in.
Lestrade nodded.  “Been hoping to get back into it myself.  Not that I don’t like this place, but it’s not my life’s work, you know.  Everything’s been squared away, and I have a few connections in the Met.  Thinking of relocating to London myself, actually.”
“You’re going to miss it, aren’t you?” John asked, staring at the ceiling.
“Feeling randy?” he murmured sleepily, wiggling his hips.
it before.
The garden is utterly still.  They stand side-by-side.  In his peripheral vision, John can see Sherlock’s breath puff out beside him.  Eventually, he takes his hand from his pocket and finds Sherlock’s.  They clasp fingers.  “I think I’m ready to be a husband again.  A better one.”
At university, when he carefully undressed his lovers, mapping soft skin with his fingertips, kissing dips and curves, exploring wet and secret places, he easily shrugged aside the student of science and let his heart (and cock) take over; clinical assessment tucked away for a while.  He learned the female body quickly and completely, and while he wasn’t exactly promiscuous, he had the pleasure of discovering he enjoyed many types of women’s bodies.  (His sister once told him once when he was home for a holiday that he didn’t care what type of car he drove, as long as he was driving.  It was a poor analogy, but John supposed it was true).
In which proceedings are interrupted, assistance is required, and difficult questions are asked.
“Burns?  Petree?”  He kept asking, the names flowing from his parched tongue although he already knew the answer.
“Of course I do,” Sherlock scoffed.  “Just not very frequently.  Tedious.  But sometimes necessary.  So, then you told me about the needles, and I said we were going to ruin that hideously appointed bed and you had a small mental breakdown in the doorway.”
He looked at John for approval, who shrugged his shoulders.  It didn’t matter to him.  He actually didn’t know how they were getting home, and found he didn’t really care.
“I’ve packed my trunks.”
He was about to make a discreet attempt to smell it when a group of young women walked in, talking loudly and excitedly.  A hen night, he guessed.  Best not to be seen loitering with massage oil; back on the shelf it went.  He caught the eye of one of the girls - a pretty brunette with flushed cheeks who gave him a dazzling smile.  Maybe...nah.
“It was only texts.”
Only Sherlock would find an enormous penis embarrassing.  “It’s OK,” assured John.
John runs in the door ten minutes later.  “Sherlock!  My God, was he here?  Jesus Christ, are you OK?”
“OK.  Goodnight, Sherlock.”
“You did not.”
his area.  Finally, something in which John did have expertise.  It wasn’t invading Afghanistan, but it would do.
“Three times.”
I’m dripping now.  I can feel it, an overwhelming need to consume, to ingest.  It’s probably not at all normal, downright kinky even, but John has never complained about my idiosyncrasies in bed so I kick off the duvet, haul him over, crawl over his back.  “Going to taste you,” I whisper to him, just so I can see the gooseflesh rise on his skin.  It does, and I kiss it as I crawl down him.
“Let’s find the bastard who killed your dad.”
Sherlock cleared his throat.  “No, actually.  Have you given any consideration as to where you will live once the house sells?”
John’s eyebrows came together in confusion before it crystalised: Molly was in love then, with a man who would never give her the time of day.  Tragic, really, he thought.  She was sweet.  “I don’t think he’s really, um, interested in relationships,” John began.
“Well let’s see where it is now, shall we?  See how good I can make you feel?”
last night, and I know it wasn’t you, so I bloody well need a pistol.”
“He always said how clever you were,” Owens said, teeth clenched together.  “Find it, then, if you’re so convinced I have it.”
something to him, inadvertently, perhaps, that would damage Sherlock Holmes more than he was positive she’d done to Mrs. Jenkins.
Now that he was with Sherlock, sometimes he enjoyed closing his eyes or turning off all the lights, giving his other senses a chance to indulge in the feel of skin on skin, the scent of sex-musk, the sounds of exertion.  Sometimes he had to shut his eyes against emotion; sometimes he had to force back tears that threatened to spill out and run down the sides of his face and into his ears.  He was, after all, madly, deeply, and wholly in love with Sherlock Holmes.
“There you go.  Please tell me you have a kettle in here.”
In which Sherlock's face and John's wallet is abused.

“No.  But it’s rather pleasant and I’m perfectly content to lie here and let you continue.”
“It’s a surprise.”  Sherlock has rented a Prius.  John’s suspicion that his daughter has something to do with this is growing.
“Ernie’s youngest, too.  Adam.  He’s easy enough to find at the post office.  Jackie’s dad, too, I think, used to meet up with Archie once and a while.”
“If we both get in there,” John had said, “we’ll stay in so long our skin will fall off.”
John and Sherlock became something more than friends but less than lovers.  Sometimes John wondered whether several years of his life had been deleted - the ones in which he and Sherlock had enjoyed crazy, passionate, endorphin-fueled sex - and what remained was the familiar comfort, bickering, and companionship of those long married.
The night before they moved out they were both out of sorts; Sherlock was moody and John was feeling sentimental, so they decided to break open a bottle of wine and drink a toast to Holmes Hall, to the past and to the future.  After the first bottle they went skinny-dipping in the pool which led to in-pool kissing and groping; they chased each other, naked and dripping, back to John’s room, where they enjoyed a playful romp that culminated in Sherlock riding John backward on the old red chair.***
“I told you I could grow a beard.  It grows very slowly.  And it’s rather ginger,” he added shyly, dropping his hand from John’s face.  “I find it horribly ironic that, after all this time, we first kiss when I haven’t recently shaved.”
“Okay, so that’s negotiable.  Just nothing I can’t get out of, okay?  It would be just like you to handcuff me to something and then go flying off on a case and forget me.”
And, occasionally, Sherlock would forget that he was British, throw all his reserve right out the window and not-so-gently manhandle his lover into his favourite position.
“You could probably have just taken a hot bath and those would have fallen right off.”
When it was over, he realised that he’d masturbated nearly twice a day since his dick had decided to work again.
There was a murmur among the crowd and shortly someone came up with one.  “Barbara, you’re in shock.  I’m going to inject you with epinephrine.  Can you understand me?”  He pulled the safety release from the device.
room!  Ugh.  I need a case.  Get me a case, John.”
Again, infinite thanks to BettySwallocks.  She's spent more time helping me on this than she probably should.
“May I ask what you’re thinking about?”
There were a few items of interest, particularly a mouse that someone had placed in an ancient tin of sweets, but that, too, was not a cure for boredom.  The leather jacket was more stimulating.  It was vintage, late 1960s, with a red satin lining.  Someone had taken fairly good care of it; the leather was still supple.  Sherlock slipped off his dressing gown and tried it on; it fit perfectly.  He peered at himself in the mirror, holding his hair back with his hands.  He turned this way and that, decided the the jacket was worth keeping as a disguise, shrugged it off, and bent down to pick up the owl, which immediately lost its other wing.  He examined it thoroughly, deducing.  (Tawny Owl,
“Who was the postman in 1989?”
John was struck with the desire to grab Sherlock’s hand, to reassure him, tell him it was all right. It was something he kept hearing: Mr. Holmes loved children.  Yet he had two of his own, who, as adults, showed many signs of delayed emotional development. Perhaps he’d found babies difficult to deal with, taking an interest only when little Mycroft and Sherlock were ready to explore the world with him.
“It’s
John stepped into doctor mode and removed the rest of the strips with precision, smiling at the curses that fell from Sherlock’s lips.  “There you go,” he announced after the last one, “all done.”  Sherlock collapsed on the edge of the tub as John picked up the remains of Sherlock’s sheet and tossed them into the trash.  “You’re going to look a bit strange while it grows back.  Not that anyone will notice.”
Sherlock shoves down his unease.  Moriarty can taunt him as much as he likes, but there’s something that flares hot and angry inside of him when John is the subject of attention.  Moriarty may be the most formidable opponent Sherlock has ever faced, but the instant he laid his hands on John, kidnapping him and strapping him up with explosives…he lost some of his intrigue.  Moriarty is wrong: John is not a pet.  He is a conductor of light, a friend.
“Wow.  That’s fantastic!”
Phillip Leybourne's dialogue and character came directly from the brain of my beta and Britpicker friend, BettySwallocks, who saved that section from certain doom.  If you can hear his character, thank her, because she wrote it.
“When did you start using?”
“Find anything?”
He was vaguely aware of the pounding of his heart and the proximity of  Sherlock’s body to his, and if they slid any closer together, certain bits and pieces would be touching.  For the most part, though, John’s entire universe shrank down to the feeling of Sherlock’s full lips, of his own hands guiding Sherlock’s face, fingers sliding over wet hair, eyebrows, the nape of his neck.  He couldn’t keep his eyes open, so he let them slide shut.
“...but you never
On 3 February Harry turned up.  “Congratulations, Johnny,” she said as she came in and looked around, her eyebrows drawn together and mouth pulled into a frown.  “You’ve officially managed to scare the shit out of me.  Pack your things. You’re coming home with me.”
_____________________________________
“Mummy indicated that there were some issues with father’s cousins.  Abuse allegations.  Mycroft looked into it.  Turned out to be nothing.”
John’s stomach growls loudly.  Sherlock stares at the stick, must equate it with sustenance, and offers it to John.  John shrugs.  Accepts it.  They sit on the sofa.
Side-by-side they moved together, Sherlock’s hand over John’s, tugging at John’s cock as Sherlock ground himself against John’s arse.
He sighs, showers, and changes into jeans.  Dinner is crossing his mind --he thinks he has rice and chicken breasts in-- when there’s a brief knock at the door.  Sherlock lets himself in as he’s done for the past sixteen years.
John didn’t even have to think about it.  “Yeah, Sherlock.  That’d be great.”
“He was intentionally infected with the bacteria that causes benign inoculation lymphoreticulosis, commonly known as cat scratch fever.”
John is halfway up the steps when the scales start again.
Sherlock gently worked the lubricant around his entrance before applying more to his fingers and pushing it carefully inside.
“Sherlock, open your eyes.”
Barbara’s eyes had gone wide.  She couldn’t speak.  Without waiting for an answer, John jammed the pen into her thigh.
Sherlock must have been struggling with the same feelings, for he couldn’t seem to fall asleep either.  He kept moving this way and that.  He’d roll over, rub his feet together, roll the other way, flop on his back, spoon John only to kick the covers off again.  After nearly an hour of it, John finally sat up and turned on the small bedside lamp.
“Hmm?”
“I don’t.  And she’s not spoiled.”
“I’ve never been here this late into the autumn,” Sherlock mused.  “We always left in August.  I’d open this window at night and the herbs in particular became fragrant as they cooled in the evening air.  Lavender, too; there’s some directly below the window.  Mummy sometimes dried it.  You could smell our garden from her room--the roses, in particular.  Sometimes, when I was very little, I’d go into their room at night.  When it was windy -- the wind howled, you’ve heard it -- I’d lie between them in the bed.  That’s not the garden, though, what you smell.  It’s heather.”

The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones,
But bodies can be traitorous.  Even Sherlock Holmes had to know that.
“Well, yes.  Now.”
He stopped at an old birdbath, the basin of which held rainwater and old leaves.  He picked a few of the leaves out, and then, possessed by a sudden urge to make things
They sat there together, not saying anything.  It was comfortable, though, not strained or awkward.
Eventually he moved to go in.  Sherlock stood, gazing up.  “It’s beautiful,” he said quietly.
“I imagine it will sell quickly, and if all goes as planned, we’ll all be moving out by the end of August.  You don’t need to worry about delivering any more mysterious packages,” John added, trying to lighten the mood.
“Yeah.  Since you’ve had such luck with it.”  He instantly regretted it, although he didn’t take it back.  “Harry, it’s just that…”
“It seems it was Robert’s idea,” said John, buttering a croissant.  “With the needles.  She was going to introduce acupuncture as a spa package and thought that perhaps the drug could help patients.  I don’t think she really understood how dangerous it actually was.”
John made himself a sandwich (Sherlock wasn’t hungry) and sat down opposite him.
Another flock of geese flew overhead, their V formation breaking up.  “Geese don’t choose a leader,” John said at last.  “One bird takes the lead, and then when it tires, another one takes its place.  There’s no communication.  The lead bird doesn’t send a text to the rest of the flock saying, ‘Take over, mate, I’m knackered.’  The birds just
John was fairly sure his heart had either just ripped in two or swelled to bursting.  Something knotted inside his chest, clenched in his guts, roiled through his blood, sent heat to his groin.
John plays with his teacup. He’s drunk none of it, and it’s stone cold.  It
, we’d have a lot of explaining to do.”
“Three,” said John loudly, standing over Sherlock’s prone form.  He was lying on Mycroft’s leather sofa, feet propped up on the arm.
Poppy seed?  Sherlock’s mind races.  Poppy seed.  Poppy seed.  Is it a code?  Is that what John says when he can no longer control his carnal urges?  It is a type of kissing Sherlock is unfamiliar with?  His brain reels.  Poppy seed, edible, from the poppy flower, papaveraceae, distinctive red flowers, WWI, Flanders, remembrance, sleep, papaver somniferum, banned in Singapore, opium, sweet, sweet morphine, no wait, not that, definitely not that...
," he replied, waggling his eyebrows a bit.  “Whatever feels right.  You and your labels.”  He found John’s hand and kissed the tips of his fingers.  “It’s been a very long time.  Right now, I think you should touch me.  Use that oil on your fingers.”  The slightly devious look was back, the one that made John catch his breath.  “Open me,” he murmured.  “Get me ready for you.”
“Daydreaming, John?”  asked Mrs. Hudson, gently taking the muff back and rewrapping it.
“Rather striking, if I do say so.  It’s a double bloom, deep plum that fades into a dark raspberry.  Very fragrant, like honey.”
“I know,” she replied.
“Yeah.  Just.”  John pointed.  “That’s Cygnus.  You don’t see it often because of light pollution.”
John frowned.  She didn’t look well.  At all.
John reached for the other strip on Sherlock’s chest.  He tried very hard not to look at the color and texture of his skin, at the constellations of freckles and moles here and there, at a flat nipple right in front of him or the trail of hair that started just under his navel and disappeared into those black pants...
Lestrade sniffed and wiped his brow.  “Now there’s the problem.  I don’t know, honestly.  It’s never bloomed for me, so I can’t figure it out.  I was going to tear up the bloody thing, but Mycroft seems to want it for some blasted reason, so I’m keeping at it.  Maybe it’s the soil pH.  Lack of potassium or something.  Fussy bugger.”  He swatted at the thing with his glove, as if bullying it a bit would give it the impetus to bloom.  “But the old roses are nearly ready.  Come have a look.”
John replaced his mouth with his slippery hands, tenderly, very gently massaging Sherlock’s sac and its delicate contents before letting his fingers wander lower, over his perineum, where they gently stroked and pressed.  Shedding the last of his trepidation, John kept the one hand busy while the other found and guided Sherlock’s shaft to his lips.

“Most certainly.”
“You don’t have to stay here,” said John, getting up.  It was getting late.  “You’re not a prisoner.  He can’t do that.”
“Well, if anyone can manage this place properly, it’s you, love,” said Joyce.  “You’ve got a good head on your shoulders.  About time that silly bugger Leybourne took notice.”
Then, still in his coat, he crossed the room and sat on the coffee table, folded his hands under his chin, and looked somberly at his lover (who at least had the decency to look embarrassed beneath his fading arousal).
“Perhaps he was a considerate lover.”
But the texture.  The texture was
“Is it OK?” Sherlock murmured behind him, running his hands over John’s back, down his chest to tweak his nipples, before sliding over his belly and back to his hips.
And so they did, connected in the most intimate of ways, still within the walled garden of their bed.  John caught the briefest hint of heather as the wind blew, a faint perfume mingling with their own scents.
Sherlock would complain obnoxiously about being dragged from the flat (you
“I’m afraid that’s all the time I have,” she said, checking her phone and leading them back through the private corridor and to the reception area.  “You can check with Melissa to see what’s available yet this weekend.  We’ll do our best to accommodate you.  We do have a couples’ massage package, if you’re interested.  I know we’re fully booked for full-body massage for the rest of the evening, but I’m sure we have openings for other services if you want to try something out now.”
John let out a laugh.  “New shampoo, I guess.  Okay, so you have to hear what Sherlock did now...”  He spun the story the same way he would have on his blog.  John was a good storyteller, although Sherlock was always criticising his penchant for flowery prose or over-exaggeration.  “Why waste the time with the
“I’m not following.”
“I can’t,” John laughs.  “God, I should record that and put it on the website.”
“So Mycroft blames you.”
The investigation continues...
“Obviously,” drawled Sherlock.
“This is a bad idea, John,” Sherlock chastised as they waited for her at a metal table set up in one of the gardens.  “I don’t need anyone’s help.”
Sherlock was back on the sofa, still in his pyjamas, where he spent most of the day, until John was so bored he decided it was worth the risk to attempt to move him.
On Monday morning, John wasn’t needed at the surgery until 11am. He awoke feeling more vigourous (and horny) than he had in a long time, so he got up early, enjoyed a nice shower (and a leisurely wank) and rode his bike into the village to grab a pastry and coffee from Marjorie Gant’s bakery.  He sat enjoying the sun at a small metal table outside, when Mr. Chapman, who owned the antiques shop, hobbled up, unlocked the door, and began his morning ritual of sweeping his front step.
John sighed, finished what was left in his glass, and pocketed his phone without replying.
“By that time,” Sherlock continued, “I was already training myself to use logic to solve problems.  Emotion and sentiment were...complicated.  It was easier to disconnect.”
“Agreed.”
“There’s more wood outside,” says Sherlock.  He looks beautiful.
“I believe I should ask your blessing,” says Sherlock, sitting primly on the sofa next to John.  He’s doing a decent job of hiding his nervousness, but John knows better: Sherlock loves Rosie, he wants her to approve.
“I just can’t seem to take it all in,” lamented Mr. Leybourne, whose hand seemed a bit shaky around his teacup.  “She was such a lovely girl.  And all the while, she and Robert...arrested for manslaughter...”  His nose turned red, and for an instant John was sure he was going to cry again.  Sherlock did
Mrs. Hudson looked at him pointedly.  “Can you see him eating from anything else?”
“Dinner.”
“God, I hate the fookin’ honeymoon suite,” said Sam.  “We might as well bin these.”
John arranged himself and his breakfast at what must be Sherlock’s desk and began to eat.  He kept his eyes on his food but could feel Sherlock’s gaze settle upon him.  Good.  John was done with his eggs and on his second sausage when Sherlock finally spoke again.
They look at each other, and Sherlock hears music.
John chuckled at the thought of Sherlock fully bearded. “No you can’t.”
“I mean, in the laws of the land I’m not.  But I am.  Rosie was right.”
“So why do you think he’s hairless?” John asked after Sherlock’s pout dissolved.
Quick and dirty, or soft and tender?  In his aroused and slightly drunken state, either sounded fantastic.  What about a bit of both?
“No.  I
Owens remained silent.  John wondered if Owens kept a loaded weapon on the premises.  He had several chickens to protect from the local foxes.
No ghost prompts him this time.  “Stay,” he says, “we’re talking.”
“Fine.  Is there a particular flower that one must use to play this inane game?”
“Of course I was.  Am.”
“I know,” sighed John.  “And honestly, I’m completely knackered.”
John ate a tuna salad sandwich and drank Perrier as Mycroft (very tidily) nibbled a ginger biscuit.  Mycroft had also ordered tea -- Earl Grey with lemon-- and John could clearly see Mycroft’s distaste for the generic teabag.  John wondered what Mycroft would be like addled with caffeine -- was he ever like Sherlock, all unrestrained energy?  Did he ever get completely pissed, have a night out with his mates?  He wondered what Sherlock would be like drunk.  Dangerous, probably. Uninhibited, hopefully...
“Wait,” said Sherlock, handing over another few papers.  “Here’s a life insurance application.  And a personnel file from his employment as a traffic warden in Leeds, 1974-1986.  Check through these.”
John took the train home to Burnett Thwaite and cycled back to Holmes Hall to see a familiar red Royal Mail delivery van parked outside.  Sherlock was signing for something.  John waved and nodded at Owens and rode around back to put his bike in Lestrade’s garage.
Our first sexual encounters were fumbling and awkward and so full of emotion I nearly wept on several occasions.  Did on one, actually.  It was embarrassing and raw and horribly confusing.
Sherlock was indeed up and occupied, complicated chemistry apparatus bubbling away on the kitchen table.  He hadn’t washed or dressed, opting instead for his dressing gown over his pyjamas, hair sticking out from under safety goggles as he wielded a pipette.  John smiled fondly at him and set the box down, which interrupted the detective’s thoughts momentarily.
He’d gone to meet someone at the Jazz Cafe, a single mum he’d initially met while treating her daughter for tonsillitis. It didn’t take Sherlock’s powers of observation to see she clearly wasn’t over her ex.  She drank too quickly, as if trying to shrug off the past, and then she did shrug her shoulder out of her blouse as she danced.  Suddenly John felt entirely too old.  He made sure she got home safely and didn’t even feel the slightest urge to come in ‘for coffee’.  In fact, her perfume lingered on his shirt and smelled all
Inhale.
“You want me to take a fancy bath and get a massage.”
“Will be,” said John.  He felt the familiar flood of endorphins, the “doctor’s high” of saving a life.  And damn did it feel good.  “She’s a lucky lady.”
“It’s fine,” said John.
His heart beating faster, John kept the ruse going.  He drew his eyebrows together and frowned. “I’m afraid that won’t do it.  I need to either patch the inner tube or replace it completely.  May I use your phone?”
“Now this is Talfrynn Mandering Holmes, who married Imogen Vernon-Bassingthrope.  Killed on the Titanic.”
Sherlock’s cool, aloof demeanour had slipped somewhat.  John felt somewhat proud to share these private moments with a person who, as Mrs. Hudson said, didn’t have friends.  As far as John knew, he might be Sherlock’s only friend.  Friendship didn’t come intuitively to him, it seemed, or if it had, he’d ‘deleted’ it or something in favour of logical reasoning.  Either way, John felt he’d found a kindred spirit in the man.  He didn’t give much stock to notions of fate or destiny, but he couldn’t help feeling like he’d found something he’d been missing, something he had waited a long time for.  He’d grown to care very deeply for Sherlock, and while Sherlock still didn’t quite function within the normal parameters of any other man John had ever known, John thought...or felt, rather...that Sherlock felt the same.  Maybe it was some stupid romantic notion.  Maybe it was a figment of his imagination or a manifestation of his own lonely heart.  But when Sherlock finally declared Professor Plum (a morally dubious scientist devoted to doing nefarious things with the Higgs-Boson particle) the murderer and declared himself a superior intellectual being, the way he looked at John for confirmation of the fact, the way his eyes seemed to say “validate me”, confirmed to John that he had somehow insinuated himself into Sherlock’s sphere, that he now had a place, albeit small, among the myriad facets of Sherlock’s mind palace.
“Mmm.  Agreed.  Although it’s not recommended to use oil-based lubricants with condoms or silicone-based sex aids...oh.  Oh, that’s...nice.”
John’s breath left him as his anus stretched around the blunt head of Sherlock’s cock, yet there was enough lubricant and he was relaxed enough for Sherlock to slide in easily.  John felt the flared tip of the corona pass through and then the rest of his length follow.  Behind him, Sherlock ran his hands soothingly up and down John’s torso.
Sherlock snorted and splashed John again.  “I’ve a longer reach than you do.  You took two strokes to my one.  I should have won easily.”
“It’s called
As it turned out, he needn't have been concerned; Owens simply opened the back door (apparently he didn’t worry about intruders and regularly left it unlocked).
The blue velvet bag that holds the mouthpiece, however, is empty.  He tears the flat apart but comes up empty handed.  His lip hurts too badly to play, anyway.
“What’ve you got there, boy?” he asked, using his cane to pull himself up.  He left his birds on the bench as he went over to the other side of the fountain, where a few rose bushes formed a semicircle around a sculpture of a faun with panpipes.  Toby was pawing at one of the flagstones that surrounded the sculpture that apparently had cracked and loosened.  Crouching down, John cleared away some dirt and stray dead leaves.  His fingers felt the edge of the stone, and he pulled it up easily.
“Yeah.  That.
The fact that John Watson affects the transport is a tremendous understatement.
Sherlock stared oddly at him all through the meal, but, thankfully, said nothing.
“I’ll see you tomorrow.  See ya ‘round, Jackie,” he called to the barman, who raised a glass he was washing in a goodbye salute.
John pulled a cobble from the boot out of his pocket as Sherlock stood back up and did his best to ruin his trousers by rubbing the dirty stone he’d pulled from the ground on them.  The one Sherlock had pulled from the ground was still dirty, but even then they could tell the stones were a match: smooth, grey decorative cobbles with white striations.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “Digestion is boring.  Food slows down my mind.”
“That’s nothing new.  Come on, get up.”
“Ew, God, gross.”
“Shit.”
And John, sometimes to a fault, was fiercely protective of his friends -- and lovers.
Sherlock doesn’t answer.  Instead, he gets up from the table and goes to his chair, places the bulky instrument on his lap, and replaces the mouthpiece.   “I really am very good.  I have perfected triple-tonguing.”
“Yes, Sherlock.  We’re friends.  Good friends.  I, um, think.  Hope.”  He cleared his throat, having found the clarification slightly awkward.  “Now don’t feel obligated to reciprocate, please.  I just...thought you’d like it, that’s all.”
“I don’t know yet.  Mycroft and I have been discussing whether or not we should press charges.  What do you think?”
More than anything, though, he also just really wanted to shoot something again.
“You don’t know the planets?  Basic knowledge of the solar system?”
“You’ve lived with the wanker for three months now.  I know he can stink.  Jesus, when I found him a few years ago at that crack house he hadn’t showered for…”  His sentence was abruptly cut off by a certain someone kicking the back of his seat.  “Oi.  Stop that.”
a man,” John whispered back.  “And
“If he really wants something to blow,” she continues, “he should just get himself a boyfriend and spare the rest of us.”
“Robert Leybourne had to have known the risks,” said Sherlock, having paused his deliberate crunching.  “I’ll be interested to know exactly what else he’s been working on.”
at Sherlock as hard as he could.  “That would be absolutely lovely,” he said.
He held his brother’s eyes for what John thought was a small eternity, before the younger Holmes sighed and made a face.  Mycroft must have interpreted the expression favourably, for he smiled and nodded as if to say “you’re welcome” before sauntering his way off the veranda, umbrella tapping on the flagstones, presumably to find Leybourne.
“Well.  Um.  Goodnight, then,” said John, wondering what to do with himself.  He stood for a moment, caught between staying and leaving, before crossing over to Sherlock and kissing him gently on the top of the head.  Sherlock made a noise, a surprised yet satisfied sound, before opening his eyes and tilting his face up and offering his lips for a brief kiss.
“I have already given my word.”
“Give me ten minutes.”
“Oops.  Sorry.  I didn’t mean to sound spiteful.  Lillian really is very kind.  And she has done so much for this place.  It’s just that she’s kind of a celebrity around here.  Everyone seems to do whatever favours she asks, and Mr. Leybourne basically handed the spa over to her.  If Lillian wants something, she gets it.”
“Pig entrails.”
“Listen,” said John, “I’m going to get up and turn on the light.  If you try anything, I
“Not your area, right.”
!”  he nearly shouted, clearly put out that John wasn’t getting the message.  John waited and gave Sherlock a look that clearly said
“It sounds delightful,” said Sherlock, smiling kindly.  “Who else can you recommend?”
“What happened with your son?  Henry?” John asked as he held the door for her.
“You’re a nutter, you know that?  And your brother can’t possibly be that bad,” said John, still laughing.
“Hmmm.  What do you think?”
“Jesus,” said John.  “You’re a menace to yourself.  Budge up.”
“Look at me.  Right in front of your face.  Breaking free?  So easy.  I learned how.  You know, Dr. Watson taught me this one,” she says.
“You’re not really a sociopath.”
.  His thumb found a place where the pages didn’t quite meet; he opened it.  There, inside, was Sherlock’s rose, flat and brittle.
“That...you...this…”  Sherlock made an all-encompassing hand gesture. “This is not boring.  Not plain.”  He furrowed his brow as he did when he wasn’t expressing something emotional clearly enough.  “Not ordinary whatsoever.”
pricey bespoke scent I smell on him after we’ve rubbed all over one another.  That’s incredibly arousing, actually.
“Who’s the first?” asked John.
“If someone really wanted him dead, don’t you think they would have gone to better lengths to assure he, um, actually passed away?  Tumbling from a ladder doesn’t necessarily indicate cold-blooded murder.”
roses?”
“Very good!  Very good.  What gave it away?  My lips?  My manicure?  My charming personality?”
Sherlock shifts away from the window and assumes a more neutral posture.  “I wouldn’t have thought that would embarrass you,” he says.
“Already checked it,” Sherlock said.  “Nothing new.  And I simply have to get out of here.”  He bounced to his feet again, eyeing John.  “I see you’re going out.”
“Why don’t you do it, too?”
Chapter 8:  Brilliant and Bizarre
“You have met the man.  Do you think he accepts help?”
John turned to let Sherlock spoon up behind him.  They lay quietly for several moments.  “Would it be…”  Sherlock paused.  “Would it be too much if I asked you to take off your clothes?  I’m feeling… I’m not really....I just would like…”  he trailed off and breathed out sharply through his nose.
Sherlock’s lips pulled tight.  “There’s only been one postman as long as I’ve lived here.”
Sherlock sat back, smirking, pleased with himself.  Juvenile and base, yes, but there was always something very satisfying about revenge.  And he had made John laugh.   Even better, he had outfarted two very masculine men, which he supposed gave him some kind of male prowess.
John frowned at the bottle, picked it up, and went to find his phone.
“Maybe he knew something that someone wanted to keep quiet?”
“Did you tell your father?”
“Seems he’s well known around here.  It’s going to get us what we want much faster.  And the faster you solve the case, the faster I can relax.  Just go with it, Sherlock.”
“I’m afraid I bypassed that completely today,” Sherlock replied, “but you’re not going to tell, are you?  Mundane.  Dull.  Now, dear Molly, tell me whom we have here.”
John would blame the manhandling later for not realising that the muff had been inadvertently squashed between his body and the mattress.  He honestly hadn’t noticed it.  It was hard to notice much when he was so turned on and Sherlock was fumbling around in the drawer of the bedside table for lube.
His future housing prospects looked about as bleak as his opportunities for employment.  There was locum work in London, but nothing permanent. A career as a surgeon was no longer an option.  A wider search proved more fruitful, and after two days of doing little more than browsing the internet and calling around, John found a clinic in Leeds that was looking for a part-time GP.  He hoped his current CV was convincing enough to get him an interview.
_____________________________________________________________
“Jesus, Sherlock,” he mutters into his pillow.  He’d better not choose this moment to have a crisis about cleanliness.  Don’t you see, John?  I want all of you.  The parts you would give to no one else out of consideration or embarrassment.  He understands.  I know he does, and he yields to my touch, concedes to my kink.
“This isn’t going to work,” says Mary.
“You’ve got pond scum on your back, love,” John said.  “Leave the boots.  We’ll get cleaned up and find everything you need.  I’ll call Stamford and see if we can get you into a proper lab tomorrow.”
Sherlock laughed.
“Shhh,” John whispered.  “It’s OK.  Relax.”  He took one long look at what was laid out before him, Sherlock’s most intimate of parts, his anus, tight and puckered, nestled in soft hair.
“Are you still OK?”  The position must be hard on Sherlock’s legs, which were doing most of the work.  In his position in the chair, John couldn’t even get enough leverage to thrust up with much force.  Not that it mattered.  Just being inside Sherlock, feeling his weight and watching their bodies together was enough to start him on the path to orgasm.
of doing that again." He turned his head to face the detective, looking eye-level at the slouching man. His old mind supplied a perfect "
He couldn't say it, though. Didn't want to hurt him further.
John dutifully ignored the man, even though his words were running through him, poisoning his veins, and would most likely eventually stop his breath. He walked on as if he hadn't just seen his once-boyfriend shag someone as soon as he'd left the flat. Pretending that he was fine. This was fine. Jon would have time to feel pain later. Right now, he had to pretend that he was cruel and cold hearted to keep his heart from quitting it’s rhythm. He wouldn’t allow it to even
John must have been looking either shellshocked or deep in thought, for Sherlock approached him.  “I’m fine, John.  Let’s go.  I’m in a hurry.”
John sniffed and checked his watch: it was just after 3am.  “Yeah.  Just let me use the loo.”
Anderson glared at her.
“Would she be ‘brilliant’?”  He spit out the last word.  “Or is that reserved for
Sherlock did, propping himself up at the head of the bed with pillows before throwing an arm over his eyes and breathing through his mouth, his own member dark and swollen against the pale skin of his stomach.  John sat between his legs, re-oiled his hands, took one of those long, slender feet between them, and tried his best to do what James’ magic fingers had done earlier.
“He loves me not.”
“And no black latex.  Ever.  Got it?”
“Mr. Owens,” said Sherlock as he began picking up various knicknacks and twiddling them in his hands, “You have lovely gardens.  But I noticed a lack of roses.  You really should try your hand at them.  A garden seems incomplete without them, and they're not that difficult to manage if you follow a few simple instructions.  Even John can grow them.”
Half an hour later the sheets needed to be changed again, but they were both so tired that they separated to either side of the giant bed, leaving the mess between them in favor of slumber.
Sherlock was examining a package that looked like it contained several livers.  John should have found it macabre.  He didn’t.  “Of course.  They’re usually quite a bit smarter than the average criminal.  It would be an interesting challenge.  Getting into the mind of a killer, outsmarting him.  Most are men.  Statistically.  All sorts of motives, too.  And methods of murder.  There’s your ritualistic killer, usually some sort of zealot, the truly psychotic killer, unpredictable and dangerous, the greedy killer, who will eventually make a mistake: that’s Shipman for you.  There’s always the element of time involved, for a serial killer will kill again.  It’s an elaborate game between the killer and those who want to catch him.”
“I’d like to see you try,” huffed John.
John managed a laugh.  “Not yet.”
“Look, Lillian’s been arrested.”
and you want to be in the same room as I am while a beautiful woman fondles my feet!  What does it look like?"
“No, unfortunately.  The ink on the inside of the boot is all but faded away; there was nothing I could find that would connect the boots to any other place but the pond.  There are very interesting diatoms in that pond, by the way.”
camillllee go to slleepppp youre so ridiculousss
The pair of them sat side-by-side, knowing that any word from either of them might rip the fragile human out of John once again. The doctor looked straight ahead, his hands resting on his knees and his sore back pressed flush to the wall. He allowed for a few minutes to pass before he spoke up, feeling more stable now. He allowed for voice to trickle into his words, taking on the same tone that he would've used to calm Sherlock before all this happened. He cleared his throat.
“How’s the leg?”
“You can solve this,” John said, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s head.
“Stamford liked you. I didn’t know you could be charming,” said John as they were seated at a small, quaint trattoria, the owner of which Sherlock had apparently “helped out” in the past.  It seemed that he’d done a fair bit of “helping out”.  John wondered if it was his way of restoring order to the universe for every lab he’d ruined or person he verbally eviscerated. He’d deduced several passers-by on their walk from the hospital to the restaurant, and while John was suitably impressed, he was also struck by the flippancy in which he ticked off their faults, vices, and secrets.  “I’m not being cruel,” Sherlock tried to explain when John called him on it.  “Just stating what I see.”  His cold, calculating deductions seemed incongruous with the semblance of congeniality he’d put on earlier at the lab.  John found himself wondering if maybe there wasn’t something accurate in that antisocial personality disorder diagnosis after all.
“Your tone of voice suggested that you were accustomed to giving orders.  You took me down easily enough with a move that was not martial arts but rather a hand-to-hand combat military technique.  I can’t quite tell in this light, but I’d guess your hands are still tan.  Your cane over there tells me that you were injured so it’s likely you’ve been honourably discharged.  You were brazen enough to go into areas you were explicitly told not to enter, so either you’re courageous or very stupid.  I’m betting on the bravery, which is probably why you were injured in the first place.  You were searching for someone who was in trouble, or...wounded.  Fucking hell.  You’re a doctor.  A military doctor.”  His eyes widened as if he had some tremendous epiphany.  “Oh! I see! You’re my
“My turn,” he said.
Mycroft is undaunted, and John finds his interest piqued as the older Holmes details the case.  Sherlock
Navya eyed the black bag full of linen, soiled with what was actually three orgasms’ (apiece) worth of Holmes/Watson DNA, a significant amount of sweat, a place where Sherlock had drooled in his sleep and another where he had drooled while not asleep, and three-quarters of a 250ml bottle of edible massage oil.
John snorted.  Sally Donovan sometimes made him want to throw bricks in her general direction.  He did
Sherlock took a sip and nodded as if surprised.  “It’s fine.”
, you basically made ice-lolly mixture.  It
“Yes, I think so.”  Sherlock held the keys in his palm for a moment before unlocking the first, old lock, and then the more modern one.  He then handed them back to John.  “For your safekeeping,” he said, and pushed open the door.
“Not tell me anything until I can’t take it any more.”
With Mycroft’s permission, Lestrade hired a few men and women from the village to help with the grounds, and John found it harder to slip away into the garden.  He still managed, though, and between that and working at the surgery, he found himself comfortably busy.  He knew he should probably start looking for a flat in Leeds, but the idea made him uncomfortable, so he procrastinated.
,” he spat.
John wrote
John turned from the window, astounded.  He was vaguely aware his mouth was open.  He shut it.   “What happened between you two?” he asked at length.
“Yeah, you do.”
“Well, yes.  But not about that.”
Sherlock stared at the fire, thinking, before setting his glass down, too.  He stood, deliberately, and then dropped his robe to the ground.  John swallowed, watching the firelight play off the angles of his body.  He looked like a damn statue.  Sherlock knelt then, before him, almost supplicant.  “Intensely,” he said without wavering, those strange and beautiful eyes locked on John’s own, before laying his head in John’s lap.  John’s hands came up of their own accord, fingers smoothing through dark curls.
“I can’t
“Mrs. Hudson,” began John, “who came with Mycroft the other night?”
John shrugged to himself and tucked the phone between his shoulder and ear while he scrambled for a pencil and pad of paper in the hotel’s desk drawer.
John smiled in spite of himself.  “So, we just learn as we go along?”
Outside, the September wind blew through the heathered moors, whipped through the branches of the trees.  It blew over the garden walls below; nothing stirred within.  Sherlock’s roses, now heavy with scarlet-hued hips, slept on, undisturbed.  Within the stone walls of Holmes Hall, in an upstairs room in a bed walled-in by their worldly possessions, two men did too.
John frowned.  Sherlock rarely muttered anything.  If he had something to say, he made sure
“Maybe.”
“No jam.”

, thought John.
“May I?”  John pointed to the bag of scones.  Mycroft had excellent taste in scones.
“No, I didn’t,” said John.  “Dislocated it rather badly, though.”
The massive hall stood on its hill, proud and majestic, while the orgiastic colour spectacular at the finish line rioted on below.  He could almost imagine the original earl of the manor’s ghost standing on the front veranda, looking disapprovingly at the defilement of his estate.
John raised his eyebrows, then drew them together.  He blinked and tried to determine whether or not Sherlock had really just offered to live with him.

“Well, don’t be in a rush about it.”
“Really?  I’m a trainee physio; nearly done.  Getting my massage and reflexology qualifications seemed a logical way to make money to pay for university.  Where do you work?”
“You’ve got to get all this dead stuff out,” said the gardener, grabbing a fistful of slimy brown grasses.  “This stuff is last year’s daylilies.  And this is ornamental grass.  All this has got to get pulled out.  It’s rotting and it chokes out the new growth.  Got to get down in the dirt, use your hands.  If it won’t come out with a gentle tug, use the clippers.  Give all this stuff here, these green parts, room to breathe.”
“Oh, that’s not half as much fun.”
them.”
“That’s right.  Diana Webster.  In Manchester.  She might be worth talking to.  She was there, I’m sure; she went to work with her mum in the summer holidays and would have heard Archie’s storytelling. ”
You have to have read Corpus Hominis for this to make any sense.  Sorry, it's a bit of a long read.
“Do you plan on stepping back a bit in the future?” asked Sherlock.  “Operating this place must keep you on your toes.”
“Boring.”
Sherlock gives him a look.  John licks his lips.  Again.
“I don’t feel like taking a walk.”
“For god's sake, Sherlock, you can’t just…”
“Together.”
John ducked through once what was a portcullis, its iron gate long gone, and into the structure’s interior. The inner courtyard looked like some exotic movie set, all green, creeping ivy, ancient stone, and sunlight beaming overhead.  He cautiously moved over slippery stones, avoiding stagnant, shallow pools of water, to Sherlock’s side.
He Snores
“And how’s it working for you?”
“I’m going to find Lillian’s office,” Sherlock whispered once they were in.  “Is your phone on?”
Lestrade joined them for supper that night, and remarkably, John noticed, Mycroft could actually carry on a decent conversation that wasn’t somehow condescending or mysterious.  No one volunteered to take a plate to Sherlock.  John figured that, like a toddler, Sherlock would come out and eat when he was actually hungry.
“That’s the thing,” said John, setting his own glass down on the bar and dabbing at the moisture running down its side.  “He’s a grown man.  I am not his minder, his keeper, his babysitter, or whatever it is Mycroft wishes I were.  And it’s none of his business, as far as I’m concerned.”
Instead, he ventured into the walled garden and found Lestrade contemplating a rose bush.  It looked green and healthy to John, but Lestrade’s brow was creased.
As they do when waking, Sherlock goes willingly, and John, as always, follows.
“Ta,” said John, then extended his hand.  Sherlock took it.  The moment stretched on longer than necessary.  John cleared his throat and extracted his hand. It was just a handshake, but something about it seemed oddly intimate to him.  Maybe it was the way Sherlock looked at him, those odd-coloured eyes seeing what no one else did.  He’d only known the man three days, but felt some odd connection with him.  It was a silly and romantic notion, but it was definitely there, strong enough to be acknowledged.  John nodded at Sherlock, who nodded back, before reluctantly seeing himself out.
John smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “I wouldn’t mind if I met someone,” he said, looking down, somewhat embarrassed.  When he looked up again, Sherlock was worrying his lower lip.  “You’re welcome to come,” John continued.
“Do you want to talk about it?”
“Yes.  Near Chichester.  I’d like you to see it.”
Taking a deep breath, Sherlock began listing the London bus routes -  in alphabetical order.
“Assistant.”
John failed to secure a sexual partner for the evening.  He’ll do it in a clinical fashion, too, as if John were just another silly human being with stupid biological urges that he can not control.
“You’ve got one.
“The offer still stands,” Sherlock said as they parted ways for the evening.  “About the flat.  If you’d like.”
“Well, yes, we all have our own crosses to bear,” Sherlock sighs.
.  Oh, don’t look at me like that.  It’s not that difficult.  I wasn’t splicing chromosomes or anything.  Just very selective cultivation and cross-pollination done by hand.  Lestrade’s out there trying to get it to bloom and he’s been doing it all wrong.  Tea?”
“Jesus, love.  You’re so keyed up.”
coming to London with them).  “The only thing that really helps is to get it moving,” he said.  “I’ll miss the pool.”
“A little.  Look, Sherlock, if you want personal things from people, you usually have to ask permission first.  And hair is pretty personal.”
“What were you saying about ports and anchors?” he asked breathily.
She shrugged.  “As it turned out, my father had lost his job right around then anyway, so moving back to Leeds just seemed practical.”
“You’ve had a similar relationship in the past that ended in tragedy.”
“Oh, and Sherlock,” he remembered, turning back, “I’ve got to get a bottle of that shampoo!”
“Yes.  I will.”
Andrew tried a different tactic.  “Look, it’s nothing that has any lasting effects or anything.  It’s totally safe.  Just to help a bloke out sometimes.  Like you.  That pretty brunette you’re with?  She’s out of your league.  I’ll tell you what: how ‘bout one on the house?  I usually charge 20 quid.  Should be easy for you then.  And if you want, I can arrange it so she won’t even remember.  How does that sound?”
Sherlock was already home by the time John got out, unpacking paper bags of what smelled like Korean takeaway.
At that moment, the receptionist returned with the manager.   Lillian, despite her small stature, exuded confidence, practicality and sex appeal from the top of her sleek blonde head to the tips of her sports sandals.  John knew immediately that if he wasn’t, as Lestrade put it, a bit besotted with a certain lanky six-foot plus consulting detective with bald patches, he would be doing anything in his power to get to know this woman better. Or at least, get a better look down her purple scoop-necked T-shirt.
John looked at Sherlock, who resembled a child banished to the corner for wrongdoing.  John propped himself up a bit.  “Sherlock, come over here and watch.”  In the dim light of the room, Sherlock’s cheekbones looked even more pronounced as he continued to scowl.  John smiled at him, a warm smile, one that said
“Maybe I should write for advice about how to…”
“I’ve had relationships,” Sherlock offered with a dismissive wave of his hand.  “Tedious.  I prefer to be unattached.”
“Sex, in every room, on every surface.”  John laughed to himself.  “Maybe it’s a honeymoon thing.  I like the appeal, though.”
“Yeah, sure.”
“We play bridge every Wednesday,” said Mr. Chapman.   “Keeps the mind sharp.”
“...Enough!”  He stands, the chair scraping back.
“What did you cut it on?” she asked as she towelled her hands and put on a pair of latex gloves.
John gave Sherlock his best well-that’s-a-load-of-bullshit face.
The mummified cat had done its work, chasing John’s rampant libido back into the wardrobe of his mind. “We need access to some locked areas,” he said cautiously.  “A key card of some type.”
It had gone 1am before John finally bid goodnight to Sherlock and went back to his room.  He was still slightly warm and loose from the whisky; his bed was warm and comfortable, and he was asleep immediately.
“My brother lacks tact, but his advice is sound.  I’ll meet you momentarily.”
