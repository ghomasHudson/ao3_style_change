They wound up walking passed all the frat houses into the neighborhood part of the row, then even further than that, between the end of the college-town part of town and the city. Dean rambled on about what good guys the brothers are, then about his own brother, Sam, and how badly he misses him, then eventually he pointed up at the sky – it was a clear night – and pointed out all the constellations he could name.
, and Castiel went in for the night. He was exhausted by then, and barely flung off his jacket before falling face-first onto his bed.
By then, Dean was significantly more sober, and offered to walk Castiel home. He obliged, and they made their way back across the frat row, between the academic buildings, and over to Castiel's dorm. Dean had muttered something about
“See?” Anna says smugly.
He goes to the shed and pulls the dangling light switch, a tiny sun in the center of the garden-universe. He puts the watering can back in it's place. All is in order. He makes the mistake of looking to the corner where she and him carved their names, and a lump rises in his throat. He breathes in, hold, out.
"This is true."
Castiel was here.
The guys all greet Castiel casually, with the exception of Gabe, who lights up and looks him up and down.
Forensics is cool. He spends most of it chatting with Ash while they analyze blood spatter samples that may or may not just be watered down ketchup.
“What time is my appointment tomorrow?”
It isn't long before a loose heaviness settles into Dean's stomach. He's gonna have a headache later, he can already tell.
"The rumors are true.”
Castiel shrugs, “It's up to you."
Gilda looks up.
“Hello, beautiful,” He murmurs.
Cas smiles. “Hello, Dean.”
"What're you smiling about?" The boy in question asks, squeezing Dean's hand.
Dean shrugs, "No, but, like, still."
Charlie orders orange soda and Gilda gets water.
"Everything good, man?" She asks, peering at his writing.
Ruby actually listens
“No,” He says quickly, flipping a pancake and not looking at Dean.
“Shit,” She says, her eyes bugging, “ I can't breathe. Can you guys breathe?”
He laughs, “I understood that reference.”
“Oh, this is Dean,” Adra says. She hesitates, “Castiel's...”
He shifts from foot to foot. “Um. Well, Sam thinks--”
“Yeah. He never does that. I dunno what magic words you said to him, but it worked.”
Jo steps up. “Hey, buddy,” says she.
"Right."
"Here, here!" The table responds.
Novak furrows his brow and nods seriously, "If it's not too much trouble."
He makes his way to the bathroom at the end of the hall. The plug-in light is much less harsh than the overhead lights, so he flips that on. His blue inhaler in in the back of the medicine cabinet behind the ibuprofen. He takes a couple slow puffs, his chest loosens immediately. He clears his throat and spits a couple more mouthfuls of yuck into the sink.
“'Fraid so,” She says, moving his feet over an inch so she can sit on the end of his bed, “How do you feel?”
"Twilight? Seriously?" He huffs.
He watches her back as she walks and tries to see what he means, but fails. “I wouldn't know,” He says honestly.
Captain Kirk is speaking to his friend Edith Keeler, a bleeding heart socialist running a flophouse in the 1920s. She is bright, and brilliant, and slated to die by the end of the episode. Captain Kirk is torn up by the revelation. Castiel doesn't blame him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean grits and ungrits his teeth, "I'm tired of it, Sammy," He says, "I'm tired of the way he treats us."
He looks out the window and his eyes throb from the exertion.
“Hey! Show him some respect!”
He bites his lip, "I can't believe he didn't like your hair."
“Does what?”
"Of course."
Dean rushes over, "Shit, what happened?"
He bites his lip and looks away, "I um, I would like to tell you about him. And some other old friends of mine."
"Y'all want something to drink?"
“But is it what you want?”
"Uh, sure thing."
With that in mind, he types his reply.
"It --" He swallows. He paces the length of his car, "I don't want that mushy crap."
Castiel follows obediently and Dean ignores the way Bobby looks like he wants to say something about leaving the door open, but doesn't.
If he closes his eyes, he can picture his friend sitting at the end of the bed, one knee curled up against her chest. She would be older, a little less gaunt, her hair falling over her shoulders.
Sam doesn't notice the smoking, or at least pretends not to. He just blushes and unlinks arms with his friend, “Hey, Dean. This is Jess. Jess, this is my older brother, Dean.”
Sam leaves the pizza on the kitchen table and turns the TV on. Castiel tilts his head, "Are we watching something?"
Dean sighs, “I dunno, my brother hating my boyfriend is probably, like, a bigger issue.”
“I didn't, for a while. It was like the whole world stopped turnin'.”
Dean almost does a spit-take. "Fuck." He puts his water down and makes a cross with two slices of garlic bread, "Back, demon! Back!" Cas tears off a corner of garlic bread and tosses it across the table. Dean laughs.
Castiel awakes with a shooting pain in his throat. Merde. He coughs and coughs, his mouth filling with mucus. The pain doesn't go away. He spits into tissue and adds it to the disgustingly large pile on his bedside table. Only when he manages to take a long drink of tepid water does the pain subside.
“Um,” he says.
“So, what do you study again? I know Dean-o mentioned it, but it totally slipped my mind.”
“Anything?” Jo asks, pulling a piece of hair from her ponytail and twirling it around her finger.
“Fuck, okay. Yeah. We can swing by after book club.”
Adra pets his shoulder gently, calls him ο άλλελός μου.
Dean feels like he's just been insulted, but he's not totally sure. “Yeah, but, cheese dogs.” He says empathically.
“Right?”
She blushes and buries her face in her hands, "She has?"
“Huh. Cool. Don't tell her I said this, but she's pretty hot.”
Others come by. A handful of nurses and doctors, including Meg, who stands and stares into the casket while blinking back tears. Some of their classmates show, and it's then Dean starts to get annoyed. They barely knew him. They never saw him first thing in the morning, his hair mussed and his breath shitty. They never watched him going through his medications with precise motions. They never made him laugh so hard he had a coughing fit. How is it fair that Dorothy can clutch the edge of the casket and cry hot, angry tears for a man she spoke to maybe twice in her entire life, and Dean. Fucking. Can't?
She passes in front of Castiel – there's really not much room in the kitchen, or anywhere in the apartment - to grab bowls out of the cupboard. “Alright, dinner's ready.”
After a moment, she smiles. She reaches out and puts a hand on his arm, and there they sit, together, in the too-brightly-lit hospital room, where the water cooler burbles and electricity buzzes and the sounds of the city creep up from below. This sucks, it really sucks, but Dean's glad he's not alone.
"It's not your fault."
“It's not looking good. He stopped breathing for a bit this morning. They got him back, but, um, we need to go, now.”
Merde. Castiel hlushes.
Sam groans, “It's Sam.”
Adra's voice can be heard inside, "Ναι, ο γοις μου;"
Castiel furrows his eyebrows and says seriously, “They definitely can be.” He drops his voice, “There is one mother who lets her kids run wild the whole evening on Thursdays. We've had to remind her several times that we're not a babysitting service.”
He tosses his bag on the other couch and goes over to Anna in the tiny kitchen.
Sam pouts but lets it go. "Is Cas?"
She rolls her eyes yet again, “Clearly.”
"Excuse me?"
"No shit?"
“No? She loved it, if I remember right.”
Shit. The Warriors of Yesteryear were good, enough that Moondoor almost lost to them last year. And last time the goblins were involved, it was a bloodbath until Monstressor and her elf allies swooped in. Shit. Moondoor hasn't been able to gain the favor of the fairfolk since. Dean swallows, tightening his grip on the wheel.
“Yes, thank you.”
“You are!”
The chair Dean chooses is understuffed and too close to the ground. It's a relief that the doctor and Adra are no better off, crammed into tiny chairs themselves. It's hard to be dignified when your knees are crushed against your chest, but by God do they try. Dr. Marilyn sits across from him, the coffee table in between, and folds her hands in front of her. She's wearing a wedding ring.
"But-- But cheese dogs are an American staple! And they're like $5!”
“Yeah, man, no problem.”
The rain is just starting when Adra pulls up to the library. Castiel taps his pocket to make sure he has his inhaler, then bolts to the door. He gets under the awning just as the sky splits open. He can barely see the car through the torrential rain.
There's a clatter from the kitchen, and Dean whips around to see Sam covered in something brown and sticky, and Gabe around his feet.
“I see.” He mirrors the movement, so their fingers rub back and forth together. "So you were trying to kiss me?"
“Dean,” Jo says, snapping Dean back to reality, “You’re rambling.”
"Sweet."
"Go right ahead." She uses her book to gesture up the stairs.
The gun on the table is a little revolver, less than palm-sized, and it reminds Dean of the colt on the Roadhouse wall. He looks at Bobby and Bobby looks away, mouth twisting into a not-quite grimace.
“Hell yes I am.”
"Bobby tried to give me the sex talk."
“Thank you.”
After a few moments of silence and texting, they settle in to get cracking on their work. Dean interrupts occasionally with stories from Thanksgivings past, including last year where Ellen left the grill on too long and burn everything to a crisp, so they had to order a pizza and spend forty-five minutes arguing over toppings.
Castiel's eyes wander over Dean's face, studying, not really looking at anything in particular. Dean finds himself doing the same. Cas has deep lines under his eyes, not from being tired, although he has those too. But these are little etchings in his face, like a sculptor carved a line diagonally from the corner of his eye down the side of his nose.
“Damn.”
Castiel shrugs, “She didn't say.”
After a couple minutes, the doorbell rings and Dean jumps up to get it.
Castiel flops forward, landing face-down on the pillow. Dean laughs and rubs a hand up and down his back.
Dean stifles a laugh into his fist, and Cas is struck with a sudden, sharp desire to know what he would look like stifling another sound like that. He tries not to let it show.
“Well--” Castiel starts.
When he closes his eyes, he can picture her perfectly: her roots growing in dark brown, her multicolored braces, the deep dark stains under her eyes. He sighs. "I keep thinking I could have helped her more if I wasn't stuck on the couch sick. But I was, and I still am. I'm useless, I'm – I'm letting her down.”
“She's really good,” Sam leans over and whispers.
Dean smiles, "Hey, Castiel."
“Okay,” She says, touching his forehead, “Anything for you ο άλλελός μου.”
“How does it look?” Adra asks.
Cas turns his head so he's not eating pillowcase, “Eleven. Come with me?”
Castiel doesn't say anything, but he looks Dean up and down.
Castiel clears his throat. Good going, Novak.
“Whatever. Help me get Sleeping Beauty up.”
. Dean is absolutely giddy.
Castiel takes a deep breath and it comes out in pieces, “Better.” Sam looks around, but there are no chairs. There is an empty spot against the wall where no one's standing, so he shrugs Castiel in that direction.
It strikes him that his moment with Meg in front of the elevator could very well have been his last, if things had gone just a little differently. Merde. He takes a deep breath in, hold, out.
Mr. B shrugs, "Fair enough."
They continue the ride in silence. Castiel snores softly from the backseat.
Castiel's eyes study him up and down, slow. Dean swallows. Cas seems to make a decision, swinging his legs up and standing. Dean follows. Together, the two of them push the coffee table up under the window to give them a few more feet of space.
Dean's heart breaks for a second time.
Dean swallows a couple times.
"Um, three years.”
Hm. "She would sing you Hey Jude to get you to fall asleep. And every night she'd tell us angels were watching over us. And... she loved you, Sam, she really did."
He flushes, "We... lost touch."
, but catches himself just in time. Thank God he does, Ellen would have actually decapitated him.
“Yes.”
In the car, they get everything situated in silence. He clicks in. Jo hands him her iPod, and when they make eye contact,they burst out laughing. "Holy shit, Castiel." She covers her mouth when she laughs.
Castiel wants to ask how her day was. He doesn't know how.
Behind them, Sam shifts and snorts in his sleep. Dean jumps back, his veins ice. He almost falls backwards into the table, but Cas grabs his shoulder and hauls him up.
“She did. But...” He looks away.
"Yes?"
“Oh, uh. My new friend, the one I'm working on that English project with,” Dean says, feeling himself smiling around his words, “You'd like him, I think, he's wicked funny.” He goes on to tell them about the argument Castiel and Ash got into the other day about moose, which Castiel won by pulling out some moose encyclopedia as big as his head while Ash was trying to frantically Google a video he'd seen on his phone. While Dean talks, Mrs. B glances over to Charlie, who raises her eyebrows back and shrugs.
With that, he's gone.
“Yeah, it's half feral, I think. It's been wandering around our neighborhood for a few months.”
“That's not fair,” Castiel repeats, “What are Sam's reasons for letting the cat out?”
“Ah.” She pauses, studying Castiel for a minute. “Okay. You know, Rosa Bonheur lived with another woman for many years, she even referred to Natalie as her wife.”
He slams the brakes, lurching forward. "Um."
Dr. Marilyn pauses a second before answering, “We have him on medication now that reduces inflammation and is helping him sleep. We will do everything we can for him. He's in good hands.”
“Um. Right," He says, fidgeting, "Hello, Bobby."
“What? Do I have something on my face?” Dean asks, frowning.
“I don't know what you're so upset about.” That's Anna.
“No,” Bobby says, “No, it ain't.”
“Anyway,” Anna says, putting her paintbrush down in the dirty water, “Wanna go down to the river?”
“The Gender and Sexuality Alliance.”
Merde, Anna. Son meilleur ami.
Castiel nods and pulls the bathroom door open, “The Roadhouse is where you work?”
He opens another message and stares at his phone. He and Castiel have been getting along lately, Dean would even say they've become friends. Castiel is weird, no denying that: he wears a trenchcoat every day and just last week he needed Dean to explain to him what Star Wars was. Seriously, Star Wars. But, he's cool, too: he's is wicked knowledgeable about the most random stuff, like ancient Roman history and gardening. His sense of humor is hard to see at first, too, but when Dean gets it, it leaves him in stitches.
"Hey, it works for us."
His heart thunders under his ribs, in between his decrepit lungs. He breathes in, hold, out. In, hold, out. In, hold, out.
“I mean it. What do you want to do?”
"A few years later, I met Anna..."
“Oh! What do you two want to do for Thanksgiving?”
"Oh yeah? What was it like?" He asks, putting a hand down on Cas' shin.
"I'd appreciate that."
Charlie is quiet for a moment, looking down at her feet. “Mom could help you, if you wanted to apply anywhere. Y'know, I think our community college around here has a mechanics program.”
"Hello, Dean."
Everything hurts.
Dean swallows, looking hard at him.
She frowns, drawing her arm close to her chest, “Hm. Well... Alright.”
Dean is warm all over.
Castiel has one hand propping up his head, and the other is curled in near his waist. Dean reaches over and brushes his first two fingers across Castiel's. Cas watches the movement, "You did that the other day, too. Why?"
He looks at his reflection, trying to see it how Dean will. He looks smart, well-put-together. A little small, and not just because he got Adra's frame. He looks better when he smiles, so he does that.
Dean laughs, “What, are you allergic to weed?”
Castiel stands and brushes the dirt off his knees. He makes his way over to the fountain as he talks.
Castiel flushes, “Not very,” He admits, “The first couple of Walton's letters.”
Cas clears his throat and it dissolves into a deep, hacking cough. The monitors beside him jerk and beep. His hand twitches. Dean closes his eyes and the rest of the world disappears until it's just him, and Castiel, and the point of contact between them.
"See?"
They wait for Dean to come up before they go inside themselves and are ushered into a big stage room with movie-theater-like fold-down seats. Someone hands them each little pamphlets for order of performance. Kevin is second, Jo is fourth, and then Jo accompanies a couple other performers on piano. The theater smells a little like drying paint, and Sam can see some theater props tucked into the corner behind the big velvet curtain.
Dean glances over, and Cas has a smile tugging at the side of his mouth.
Princess Leia thumps her tail on the floor. Mrs. B calls her and she bounds away.
"You, uh, haven't mentioned him before."
"Mm, I know. ls there anything actually wrong with what they're doing, though?"
“Merry Christmas, Dean.”
He admires his mother's optimism, really, giving him condoms. He doesn't know how he'll be able to handle... that... if the mere thought of kissing Dean makes him this giddy. Honestly, Adra.
"Yeah."
He swallows. He fidgets in his seat. “Um.”
“So, Dean,” Missouri says, turning her attention on him, “What do you do?”
Jo looks at the clock, "Shit, 7:30 already?"
They talk and laugh for a little while longer. At some point, Dean’s phone buzzes in the cup holder – a text from Ellen.
“Hey guys,” Dean says, and they looks up, “This is my buddy Castiel. Cas, this is Gabe, Luke, Zeke, and  by the sink is Alfie.”
She'll go over and pluck a couple up, cradling them in her slender hands, “Baby's breath, interesting choice.”
Dean is careful not to let his hands falter. "Uh, yes, sir. Jo invited him," he lies.
"It wasn't me, that's for sure."
Sam furrows his brow, “What?”
Castiel spits a wad into a tissue and tosses it into the overflowing trash can. From the bed, Dean makes a face. Cas rolls his eyes and unlatches The Vest. He slides out of it, rolling his neck until he hears a pop. He coughs a few times.
"I can make a roast tomorrow night," He offers.
Halfway to the park, he asks, "So who all is gonna be there again?"
Cas looks thoughtful for a moment. "Interesting. I think he talks too much."
He's right about the colors, red-blue-green teddy bears dance around on the walls, except for the spot where a TV used to be. The TV is long gone but the wires it connected to are still hooked into the wall. The furniture is stacked into a corner. If he squints he can imagine how it was back in the day: rows of art supplies in color-coded drawers, a tiny table covered in crayon marks, and two enormous ketchup and mustard beanbag chairs sitting side-by-side in the middle of the chaos.
“They can fend for themselves for one night – right, Castiel?” She looks to him. Ruby turns around in the doorway and locks eyes with him.
"Yep. Tragic, I know, but someone's gotta take care'a Sam."
Dean laughs and claps him on the shoulder, "You don't, dude, I'm joking."
He smiles, "You, too. Remind me what you do?"
“Oh--” Dean fishes something out of his pocket. His inhaler. “Uh, you dropped this.”
“Why should I?!”
“Boyfriend,” He finishes for her.
He takes the iPod from Jo's outstretched hand.
Ash arrives a little later and stands at the back of the room, staring up ahead.
“Ah, merde,” He mutters to himself as Adra pulls out of the neighborhood.
Castiel squints. "Fine."
Bobby puts his mug down and runs his hands over his jeans. He looks Dean up and down and says, “No, not forever. But, boy? I'm here for you while it does.”
Castiel blushes and touches his fringe. Dean's eyes track the movement, smiling crookedly, "Seriously."
He takes another deep breath, in, hold, out.
Dean picks up one of the figurines on his desk and bobs its paw, then he studies the charcoal drawing taped to the wall.
“Be right there!” He calls back. It's not technically a crime to be up this early, but Dean thinks it oughta be.
He turns away from the sound of her voice, “Um, yes. Perhaps.”
“Yeah. Dude,” He says,  popping the door lock up, “Why don’t you come in, have a seat?”
What? “Um, yes?”
Novak beams, proud of his ability to impart wisdom. It would be attractive, Jo considers, if he wasn't obviously as gay as a tree of a monkeys high on nitrous oxide.
His face softens and he lets out a breathy, oh. "Uh. Yeah, sure. Any time, Rocketman.”
Heat creeps up Cas' face, “Um.”
Castiel bristles. If she didn't learn anything in class it was – at least in part - because she only attended half the time. But he doesn't say so, just makes a non-committal noise, “Mmh.”
Castiel freezes. He knits his brows together. "Um, what for?"
Princess Leia bounds over to her, tail wagging, and lets out a tremendous bark. Mrs. Bradbury waves at Dean and takes the dog out the back door.
"Oh? Wanna show me some moves?" He wiggles his eyebrows.
“But what if it doesn't?”
Dean grins, “Good, man, I'm doin' awesome.” He looks like he wants to say something else, but then a familiar guitar riff comes on, crackling through the bass-boosted speakers, “Oh, hell yes.” He grabs Castiel by the arm and drags him back to the middle of the floor, and that's how the two of them, belligerently drunk – alongside two dozen equally blasted fraternity kids – wind up screaming along to Journey's
When they get to the park, Moondoor has already set up their tents. They leave their bags in the purses-and-coats tent nearest the entrance. Charlie scampers off to convene with the Knights of the Small Table, so Dean makes smalltalk with criminal justice student by day, elf by night Victor Henrickson.
Anna? No, not Anna.
want?”
Dean's stomach feels queasy when he pulls on his jacket. Probably the damn pancakes.
“Mhm,” Castiel agrees, “The problem could've been avoided altogether if he had supported his creation from the beginning, though.”
https://www.thetrevorproject.org/
“I'm fine,” He says, coughing a few more times.
She rolls her eyes, “You'll get over it.”
Dean leans forward, and they're kissing. Holy fuck. Cas lips are as soft as he expected them to be, warm, and Castiel is kissing back, gentle, slow. They move together, and Castiel starts a sway as they kiss, not quite a dance, but almost. They break apart and Dean chases him for another kiss, then another.
Dean blinks rapidly.
“What?”
"Hey Adra, whatcha readin'?" Dean asks.
Sam fidgets, his teeth worrying his bottom lip. Oh, great. Castiel closes his eyes to avoid rolling them, “How are you, Sam?”
She nods and follows Castiel down the hall. The wooden ladder is next to the window. She heaves it over to the still-open trapdoor, and keeps it steady while Castiel climbs up.
He flushes, “I read it somewhere.”
He coughs and the pain kicks against his sternum.
https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/
“Yeah. Uh, here.” He shoves the bag in his direction.
She doesn't say anything else until he passes her standing in her bedroom doorway. Her hair is falling out of it's bun and her shirt is halfway unbuttoned.
“Damn. Does that mean you know Greek?”
“We can just sit,” Sam says, “You don't need to talk, that's fine.”
Fuck, but his embarrassment is cute.
“Adra, my dear,” She says. She's a stout woman with thick grey curls and dark brown skin. She hugs Adra and then turns her gaze on Dean, who feels somehow like she knows everything about him. “Who's this?”
"Nah, he'll ask even more questions."
Castiel tugs at his tie and loosens it a couple inches.
“Damn right nothing.”
Bobby looks away and stares at the table for a minute. “Look, kid, you don't gotta worry about him any more. You got me.” He sighs. “I think... Sometimes I think part of his soul died when Mary did.”
"Holy shit," He whispers, pressing their foreheads together.
Dean huffs.
Dean slings his bag down and sits across from Castiel, flashing him a smile. They do look like brothers, but Dean's face is more square, and his hair is short. He's... cute. Castiel gets distracted by Dean's lips for a moment when Dean licks a drop of rain off them.
He looks to the other family, their heads together, talking quietly. Electricity hums through the fluorescent lights and the water cooler in the corner gives the occasional gurgle. The near-silence is suffocating.
“Hello?”
"You better, baby?" He brings his hands up to Cas' face, wiping his cheeks with his thumbs.
“No it isn't.”
Eventually, Cas wades in up to his knees, a full-body shiver wracking through him as he does. The stones beneath his feet are smooth and cool for the most part, although he has to step carefully. Little fish zip between his legs with precise movements. He kicks water at Anna and she screeches and splashes him back, and that's all the motivation he needs to dive in. He's stronger than her though not by much; She kicks his shin to get him to fold over, and he tackles her legs and pulls her under.
Adra furrows her brows, “What is it?”
The younger Winchester lets them in and calls for Dean, who appears from one of the bedrooms in a truly hideous sweater. It looks something an old grandmother would wear, with a teddy bear and a ragdoll hanging ornaments on a Christmas tree. He turns red when he notices Castiel looking.
“Oh, hey, Cas, you're awake,” Sam says.
"Can we get going?"
“Rocketman.”
At 10:03 that morning, Dean slumps in a waiting room chair, a cup of water growing warm in his hand. Adra is beside him, pulled tight into herself, pale, her eyes empty. He holds a hand out to her and she looks at it a moment, as if she's not sure what it's there for. He takes it back. Electricity buzzes. Sniffling can be heard; it might be Sam in the corner, but Dean isn't sure. He doesn't bother to check. Everything is heavy. Despite the sun pouring in through the windows, all the color has drained from the room.
When Castiel catches up, he reaches out and puts a hand on Dean's shoulder. His friend startles.
“I know what you were saying,” Bobby grunts, “And he don't wanna hear it.”
“It's really good, Cas, you gotta try one.”
He sits up, which takes some of the pressure of his chest. Moonlight spills into his room through the open curtains: long, rectangular stretches of light. He takes a moment to appreciate the stillness. He takes a series of deep, slow breaths, in, hold, out, until the fullness in his chest wanes just a little. After removing all the tissues from his bedside table by jumping them onto the floor, he discovers that his inhaler is nowhere to be found.
“So,” Castiel says.
"Yes. These are crocuses, they just bloomed." Cas smiles when he takes the flowers and The Vest. Dean catches Sam raising his eyebrow and flips him off.
The podium is miles away, but somehow he gets to it in the space of a few seconds. His hands shake as he takes out the paper.
"Oh yeah?"
"Eh, it's more effort than it's worth most of the time."
Dean stares at his textbook, willing it to make sense. He huffs and scrubs his face with his hands, hoping it'll help. But, alas, even as he stares the page continues to be written in fuckin' Greek. Well, maybe not Greek, 'cause then Cas would be able to help him with it. Latin? Chinese? Something like that. Either way, fuck this.
A couple Moondoor knights are tag-teaming one of the big goblins, shooting her with Nerf arrows from halfway across the field. She puts up a good fight, and gets one of the knights with an impressive double-spell sack combo, but she goes down soon after. With a sigh, she tears out her red handkerchief and hobbles off to the Goblin's infirmary tent.
"Do... Do you mean Kesha?"
Dean's face falls. “Um."
Instead of heading to Trig or Guitar, Dean convinces the three of them to shoot the shit under the bleachers, and when Mr. Fueler gets too close for comfort, they head over to the gas station. They get energy drinks and stale donuts and argue about whether a werewolf or a vampire would win in a fight until the store clerk asks them to leave. Dean almost forgets to be sad.
“Whatever.” He looks down at the napkin he's fiddling with, "Hey uh, what do you think of Castiel?"
Dean chuckles and shakes his head, "It was crazy. I was just at this party with a buddy of mine -- do you know Ash Harvelle?" It's Cas' turn to shake his head. "Whatever, good guy. Anyway, apparently this party was for his frat trying to recruit new members, but all I know is it was an awesome time and they invited me to another one a couple weeks later, so of course I went. By the time I figured out what was going on, I just decided to go with it."
Dean wheels around. He can't see Mr B any more, but after a second Charlie passes by and gives him a wave. He swallows. His chest falls. "I-- No, I guess not."
“Hah,” She snorts. She curls her leg up to her chest and takes another drag, “Whatever, man.”
After that, Anna decides she wants to run some errands before Ruby gets home, so Castiel takes his leave and bikes back to campus. His caffeine headache has yet to subside, so he stops by the library cafe for a another coffee. He's a little disappointed when Dean isn't there, but Bela always brews the coffee extra strong, so he can't really complain.
“There are always alternatives.”
“How was the drive?”
He rolls his eyes, “Just make sure its clean.”
Just then, a familiar voice calls out to him, “Hey, Sam!”
“Very strange,” Cas repeats.
“You alright, space cadet?”
She goes with a promise to be back that evening if he wants to see her. He promises that he will. When she's gone, he scoots into a half-sitting position and props his legs up. He reads for a while; It's one of those mystery pulp novels that little old ladies like to read, and it's not very good, but it passes the time as the pain starts to ease just a little. Meg comes by to give him his lunch – another shake, all he can manage. When he finishes it, he asks her if he can go on a walk. She hesitates.
She glances over to Dean and they have a shared moment of, Oh, shit.
She blinks, "Oh, uh, no, I didn't know that." Neat.
Ash looks down. He pulls at the lapels of his jacket, which is a size too big, “Nah. Nah, I just gotta, y'know, decide to be brave.”
The clash is epic. Dean dodges three hackeysack spells, and lands a hit on a big goblin with grey facepaint. Someone behind him tosses an "Ice blast!" that leaves the goblin frozen for thirty seconds. He uses that time to snag the spell pouches from the goblins belt and knock him backwards.
"Yesss!" She puffs out her chest, "For Moondoor!"
If you or a loved one is considering suicide, please reach out. You are needed here.
After a few minutes of going the completely wrong direction, he finds her scowling near the Fairy Gate.
"Of course you do, you see yourself as a tragic hero,” He shrugs.
Cas was right, it would seem. Dean is very grateful for the bastard.
He shrugs, “Not yet, but I'm too tired to continue with it for now.”
"Where is this coming from?" She asks, frowning a little.
“That was wonderful, αγόρι μου. He would have loved that.”
Cas kisses him and smiles into it, "Is this okay?"
A little bit later, Mom comes by again. "Phones awa-- Oh, you're studying."
Adra nods, glancing over to him, “I understand. Is there anything you want to do, now that you have time?”
“Good night,” She says with a quick smile, and leaves.
When it lands, the tree bursts into flames.
Sam startles, but he smiles, relieved, “Um. Hi, Castiel.”
She gives him a small smile, "That's what Nicki is for. Don't worry, man. Dean really likes you, I can tell.”
“Sam named him Gabriel. I told him that's a stupid name for a cat, but he didn't care.”
“Shut up.”
“Uh, sure.”
"Thank you for agreeing to do this," Cas says when they're out of earshot of Sam or any of the neighbors.
"I'm nineteen," He says, "But no thank you, it would interact with my meds." Ellen shrugs and takes the drink back.
"Never mind. I miss you.” It slips out before he can stop it.
Dean looks at him a moment longer than strictly necessary. Castiel can't read his expression.
“Aww, you guys didn't have to wait for me.”
“That's incredible.”
“That's debatable.”
“Really? Why?”
“Uh, Castiel mentioned going to a, uh, support group at the hospital? Was that here?” Dean asks, peering out the window.
Content warning: smoking
"Hello, boys."
“Yeah, whatever.” As he turns the bacon, he adds, “Oh, I have bookclub this afternoon.”
He blushes.
“Well, that's one hell of a welcome,” He says, wiping off his face.
She nods thoughtfully, “How long have you and him been together?”
Dean short-circuits. “What the fuck?” He says again.
“No, it isn't,” Adra agrees. “But I guarantee you made her life more bearable by being in it, Castiel.”
Ruby rolls her eyes again, “Whatever, it's your funeral.” and turns back to her game.
Later, he does see Adra as promised. She's in a sweatshirt and ratty jeans, which is her usual attire these days. Her hair is washed though, so maybe she's coming back to life in inches, too. He gives her a hug with one arm, the other tucked behind his back.
Dean chuckles, then looks away. “Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. Don't ask a stupid question if you don't want a stupid answer, right?”
“Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Why did you... Think that, I guess, about me and Cas?” He pulls on the cord of his amulet.
He smiles back and an incredible weight is lifted from his chest.
He shrugs, “Whatever, man.” He hesitates, like he wants to say something else.
“Although, I hear that's not all he sends.” Dean grins, and Jo nudges him.
"What? No, I wanted to. But... I just mean, I'm sorry."
Dean nods, because it's the only thing to do, “Right. Okay.”
Dean looks over to Cas who has tucked his hands back into his pockets and smiles, "C'mon, let's roll."
Alpha is cleaner than Castiel expected; there is a fine layer of grime across the carpet, and the couch they pass by in the living room is torn and mysteriously stained, but the only beer cans visible are the unopened ones on the coffee table, and the can corpses stacked into a pyramid on the far wall. There is a round of loud laughter from the kitchen, followed by a popping noise and some swearing.
Jo is assigned to work with Dorothy, a cute brunette who sits near the window. Dean smiles at her and she winks. Dean is assigned to work with Casteel? who is out today, just his luck. If he remembers right, Casteel sits behind him and doesn't say much. Weird. But as long as he does his work, it's whatever.
Dean snorts, “I dunno, man. I don't believe in heaven.”
His whole body is heavy as they trudge through the hospital, a couple floors below Talbot's Landing. Each floor has it's own thing, their way of brightening up the place: music, decorations, or even just nurses in brightly-colored scrubs. They come across a few patients, but don't stay to chat. The nurses look at them curiously as they wheel past, wondering which one of them is the patient. Neither of them, Dean thinks bitterly. The patient is –
He grabs one from the fridge and hands it to him. A group of guys are surrounding the island in the kitchen, except for one guy who is letting a bottle of champagne fizz down the sink.
Adra furrows her brow and puts out two fingers, cautiously. Gabriel sniffs them and backs back into the carrier.
"What?"
“I'm sorry,” He says helplessly.
Dean feels like he's floating. Or underwater. He's not really sure he cares which.
Dean shoves his leftovers in the fridge. He doesn't dare turn around lest John see how hard his hands have started shaking.
She goes back to cooking and after a moment Castiel says, “Guess who I ran into again.”
"Sir Dean," She says. She has a bit of an accent, though Dean can't place where from. "It is I, Madam Gilda of Montressor. I've come to help you."
“So I didn't.”
It dips back down to the quiet melody, then roars again. Jo plays with her whole body, her shoulders swaying in time, her face contorting with each change of pace. The song goes on for several minutes, and Jo flips page after page seamlessly, until finally one sequence falls away, then another, and the room is left with only the little melody from the beginning, birds hopping across still-frozen earth at the first sign of spring, and then nothing.
"Shit!" He disappears again and there's a clattering sound.
The road is thin and winding. A couple times, it splits off into a neighborhood: Milton Ave, Hendrickson Street, Talbot Road. Just as he passes Delacroix Avenue, he spots someone walking down the side of the road. Someone in a long, tan coat.
“Any time, kid. What are you up to today?” He sips his coffee and hands Dean a mug, which he takes gratefully.
"That's what they call me. How are ya?"
Mr. B is quiet for a moment and Dean hears the door squeak shut.
“Hello, Jo.”
“Right. Probably not even then,” She says, barking a laugh.
The rain is letting up by the time he pulls into Castiel's driveway. He rushes to the door anyway. Sam goes around to the front seat once he leaves, and Dean stalls in the driveway until Castiel actually opens the front door.
Dean's chest gets tight. He looks away when Charlie glances at him, her eyes red. When Mrs. B rubs her back, all the air has left Dean's lungs. He folds his arms over his chest.
"Right, that's fine then. Hey, listen, I've gotta drop something off at Singer's Auto before it closes, are you guys good by yourselves for an hour?"
“Uh, then why are you laughing?"
They stand like that for a moment, smiling at each other. It's a merry Christmas, indeed.
They talk a while longer. Ruby's taking a class on the plague at the local community college, and her mom's finally getting off her case about quitting smoking. Gilda is vegetarian, she likes horror movies, and she and Charlie have been dating for a couple months.
He squints, "Why? Because we might have sex?"
Dean hesitates, "Yeah. Yeah, he just puts his foot in his mouth sometimes."
shit.”
Adra comes back a couple minutes later, soda in one hand and plastic-wrapped snacks in another. She sighs as she sits down. Dean pops the soda tab. Eugh, it's lukewarm, but better than nothing.
She looks out the window as well, biting her lip, “No. I didn't make him. Sometimes I wish I had.”
He looks away, “Um, almost.”
He swallows. “Um.” He doesn't know how to answer that.
Victor comes out a little while later and the three of them talk for a while. He sprained his wrist and he's gonna swing by an urgent care on the way home just to be safe. Benny offers to drive him and Victor accepts. Someone blows the Moondoor horn in three long bursts. The princess! Despite being dead, Dean sprints off in search of her. At least he can tell her he died.
"When did you take this?" He points to a photo of himself.
Dean doesn't say anything, turning red.
Finally, finally, The Vest shuts off and the room goes quiet. Castiel coughs and spits a wad into a tissue, adding it to the pile. Its strange taking it off, like losing a second skin, but he breathes way easier once it's gone. He takes a few deep, slow breaths, and clears his throat a couple times.
Curious.
“Hey, you,” She would say, resting her chin against her knee.
She rolls her eyes, "He probably wants the Dracula DVD back. I told him I gave it to you last Christmas."
"Your food'll be out soon," She promises, rapping her knuckles against the table, and leaves. Table 8 needs napkins and Table 2 needs straws and someone just sat down at Table 10, so Jo barely has time to breathe before she brings Novak his desserts. One slice of apple pie, one cherry, one blueberry, funfetti cake, chocolate cake, two kinds of cookies, and a pudding. Jo's stomach turns thinking about it, but Novak just looks it over neutrally.
He laughs. “Fine. Give me a second.” He clears his throat, “Um.
“Oh. Um, yes. I'd really like that,” She says, blinking a few times.
flexible." He winks.
“Uh,” He swallows, “Everyone keeps asking me that. Is it bad to say I don't know?”
Another ripple of laughter through the church.
“What for?”
“Thank you. We will have to see what this year holds.”
"Hello. Dean?"
"Yes. I'd like one of every dessert you have, please."
"Jerk."
“Nowhere. I was out for a walk,” Castiel says.
“Okay, mom.”
“Being high?”
“Honey, I'm home!” Dean calls.
They talk for a while longer and Mr. B brings out tiramisu for dessert.
Castiel has
“Better?” She asks, side-eyeing him as he huffs and puffs.
“Castiel,” Adra says, squeezing his knee and breaking him out of his thoughts, “Let us help, please. Isn't it getting heavy?”
“Mister Anarchist thinks monsters follow the rules?”
Cas raises his eyebrows, "Oh?”
"Uhh, root beer.”
"Condiments?"
“We have about forty-five minutes for them to get him hooked up and run their tests. Then they'll let him sleep, and I imagines that's when they'll come see us,” She explains.
Benny shrugs, "Very carefully."
“I mean it, dude, you look real good.”
"Yes?"
“Hello? Earth to Dean?” Charlie says, waving a hand in his face. Dean blinks.
Back outside, a warm breeze has picked up. Dean takes the glass from Castiel and smiles before downing it in one go.
"Good moooorning," Charlie says, flipping the light on. Princess Leia peers up and her and barks. "Good morning to you too, Princess!"
Dean blushes and slings his free arm over his face. "Shaddup. Maybe."
“Indeed, not too bad.”
"I think so too."
“No,” Jo says,“Guess not.”
He frowns at him, “No, I'm gay.”
Dean fidgets with his zipper, "Uh. She's not great."
“I don't wanna hear it,” He cocks the gun and points it, “Now git the fuck off my porch.”
"Well, then go back inside, you idiot. Consider telling them how you feel."
He makes a throaty sound, “Fuck yes. How'd you know I loved apple pie?”
“What for?”
Dinner is good, it's a warm noodle stir fry with peanut sauce. Castiel takes his usual place on the couch and Anna sits on the other side, in front of the checker board.
“Um,” Castiel says as he stirs his drink, “I guess it's just a form of self-expression I've always gravitated towards. I like the music, and it tells the world I don't believe in their authority.”
He looks out the window, where a shovel is sticking out of the ground in the vegetable plot. “It's strange. Doing it without her.”
"Geez," Dean says, carting a hand through his hair, "Alfie sounds like a piece of work."
Sam squints like he knows he's lying, but doesn't know enough to call him out on it.
He scowls, "Yeah. Shit, it's been what, ten minutes?" He glances back at the battlefield, "Jesus."
“Ah.” Curious. He takes a drink. “'Was'?”
“I'm here,” He says, stepping back and watching for her in the window. Sure enough, she appears a moment later, haloed by the inside light.
"I see."
They take turns getting changed in the bathroom, and giggle together for a while after climbing into their respective beds. Dean's sheets are a little scratchy, but they're better than the ones at home.
“Okay. Cool. Uh, hey, can we circle back to this later? When I'm, like, sober?”
"Um," He says again. "Don't hate me."
Dean texts him. Not often, but the first couple times it happens Castiel nearly jumps out of his skin. Adra is shuffling through bills when Castiel's phone buzzes on Thursday.
“Yes. For history. I'm sure you can tell it's a passion of mine.”
Castiel laughs, "Is that not your intention?"
Cas looks over at him, “So we can make out in peace?"
Dean grins, “He is.”
Dean laughs out loud, to the stare of several students in the study area. He waves them off.
He assesses.
Castiel kisses a trail back over to his mouth. They kiss, and kiss, and kiss.
“It's this – fucking – geometry, it doesn't make any fucking sense!” Sam groans.
He wonders if she and Ruby would get along.
Bobby wheels in a little while later and they finish the movie, Godzilla vs. Superman. It's awesome. All in all, it's a pretty good night.
“No, I said I would do the couch, you get to do the rest.”
Dean chews on a mouthful of pulled pork, not really tasting it. He checks his phone for the millionth time. Still nothing. Damn it.
He nods. “I see.”
Dean grins,"Well, I can't say I don't like the idea."
He's halfway through washing a third potato when there's a knock at the door. He and Bobby look at each other and Dean shrugs. He goes to open it and when he does his heart stops. Standing on the porch is John, his hands jammed into his pockets, a box of grocery store cookies under one arm. He's a couple days unshaven and his eyes are bloodshot. “Dean,” He says, smiling.
It sounds fun. He finds himself looking forward to it already.
"Is everyone gonna ask me that? Geez, I'm starting to feel like you like him better than me," He groans.
"Same here."
“Yep, many'a brother has lost his virginity on that couch,” Gabe says, grinning.
He grins. "Yes, please."
Sam puts down the box he's holding, “Dean had to go pick something up from Bobby's. How're you?”
"Burgers, definitely."
Silence. Monitors beeping.
It's hard. But by inches, it gets easier.
“That's not a no.” A slow smile spreads across Dean's face, “Isn't that like, really bad for someone like you?”
"Um," He stutters, suddenly nervous. She watches him with the even, nonjudgemental concern she always has. In an instant, he's sixteen again with her hands on his shoulders, pushing him gently towards the casket Anna sleeps in. He's eleven, watching in awe as she explains the story behind every painting in the exhibit: the artist's life, the type of paint they used and how they mixed it, and how this piece fits into the themes of the rest of their work.
“I do.”
He blinks. “What?”
Sam hits him with a pillow, "I hate you."
“I don't know!” She snaps. She freezes, then softens, “Sorry. I don't know, Castiel.” She grimaces and reaches for him, tentative.
Castiel looks at him, really looks: the way he's speared his hands into his pockets, the worn-out knee of his jeans, the shine of his eyes threatening to spill over. “You shouldn't have to bear that burden, my friend. You have no control over what your father does.”
"Good t'see you, kid," Bobby says. He wheels over with them to the sink. "Hey," He touches Dean's arm and drops his voice, "Cas is a good kid. You keep him around, alright?" He looks in Dean's eyes and Dean is struck with the certainty that Bobby knows.
After the service, they leave to go to the gravesite. Dean hangs back as everyone goes ahead – waiting for Castiel to get up his strength so they can go together – before he remembers. Shit. Adra glances back and sees him waiting, and a sad, knowing look crosses her face. She holds out her arm.
Dean stares at him, bug-eyed.
He makes a noise one last time, and hopes it sounds like Thank you, Dean, before promptly passing out.
Dean frowns. "Really? Shit."
He lingers for a moment, breathing the recycled air. He goes eventually, his hand lingering on the doorframe on the way out.
She grins, wiping her eyes. "Hell yes I will."
Before he can respond that fuck yes, Roadhouse leftovers sound amazing, Miss Sands clears her throat and he flushes.
It's a good day.
Castiel sits gingerly on the bed, his hands in his lap.
The ice in the fountain is bumpy, as if it were moving when it froze. He is seized with the urge to smash it with a hammer. "I just wish I had a choice," He says quietly. He turns around and Dean draws his hand back before it touches Cas' shoulder.
"Don't you look handsome," She says. She looks him up and down, her gaze lingering on his tie, which has once again flipped backwards.
"Thanks. Speaking of, how's Sam?"
"Well am I wrong?"
He grins, "Sweet."
She shakes her head, “Fuckin' wild.”
She squints. "None taken. I assume Ellen is less forthcoming about this sort of thing?" She's still holding the condoms out, loosely, as if she's forgotten about them.
Jo comes out a few minutes later and the cat scampers away.
“Interesting.”
After a second he does pull back and she reaches for his arm instead.
It's cool out, just the beginning of spring, but warm enough to be bearable when one moves around. Dean's shirt is stretched tight over his back, damp from exertion, and Castiel takes a moment to admire the way it clings to him. He stops digging a couple minutes later and leans on the handle of the shovel.
He sticks his head out from the kitchen, "Yeah?"
“Thank you,” He would say with a soft smile.
On his way back to his room, he sees her shadow pause when he passes in front of her door.
Castiel laughs and coughs a big wad up, “No, I won't be attending.”
"No," He whispers, “No!” He falls to his knees. He picks up the baby cabbage, which crumples in his hand. It stinks like an infection. Putain! It can't have been more than a day or two since he checked on it last. All his work wasted by a mistimed fever? He throws the cabbage aside and it bounces off the wire fence. Stupid! Idiote! Connard!
English is next. He likes it more than he admits. Their teacher, Miss Sands, is a fiery woman who does her hair in complicated 50s swirls, and she makes their work actually interesting. He is ducking in just as the late bell is ringing, and he kicks the back of Jo's chair as greeting.
Dean waits until the front door snicks shut before shuffling closer. Cas rests his head on his shoulder.
He huffs, “No. No, I mean... Cas is cool, like, really cool, but I mean he's never – We haven't--”
Castiel freezes. "... Yes. Her step-sister, um--"
“Good morning to you, too,” She says, not looking up from her notebook. She's doodling a small gun, the one Ellen has hanging on the wall of the Roadhouse in between the singing fish and the Elvis Presley poster.
He feels sick the whole time he drives Sam to school. It gets worse the more he drives. Jesus shit, not even the smooth rumbles of his '67 Chevy Impala makes him feel better.
"Yes. I can do so much, and one day I might be yanked across the universe and I have no control over where I land."
“Will they give me a real position on the board?” He asks, only half-kidding.
They unpack Dean's armor and set it out on Charlie's desk, play a round a Bad Fic Bingo, and shoot as many eye-roll-inducing puns back and forth as they can before Mrs. B calls them down for dinner. Dean's stomach growls on the way down, loud enough that Princess Leia stares at him, tilting her head.
He assesses, “Very human.”
They get to the end of the hallway and he stops, breath coming in even shorter gasps. He draws his hand back from Meg's arm and his heart goes wild. His eyes go wide. A deep, stabbing pain slashes him from the inside.
Dean steps closer to be heard. He grins. “Do you party much?” He asks, taking a sip of his beer.
“Ugh,” Charlie says, trying to half-heartedly push him out of the room, “Enough dad talk. Go... make us snacks or something!”
“Hey uh. You think we could invite Castiel sometime?” He asks after a few minutes, his heart speeding up.
“John.” Bobby says, his eyes steely. He moves his blanket back to reveal a small revolver.
Well, it'll be warm, if not the weather than the warm mass of party-goers, so shorts is a safe bet. He pulls out a tank top and his spikey jacket. He glances at his reflection in the side mirror – styling his whole mohawk will take too long; It will probably be fine as is, anyway: it curled as it dried this afternoon, and it's on the handsome side of disheveled, if he says so himself.
He shakes his head, “It did not sound like it.”
“Um, Anna was actually... thinking of staying in the apartment with Ruby. Apparently Ruby doesn't have much family in the area.”
When Castiel turns back, Dean is looking him up and down with a half-smile on his mouth.
He blinks, "Huh. I thought it looked familiar."
He recovers quickly, "Uh, yeah, sometimes."
It's morning when he wakes again. His head doesn't hurt any more, which is a small miracle. Adra is gone, but her jacket is hung over the back of the chair. He flicks his overhead light on, a tiny sun in his otherwise dark, medical universe. His journal is sitting on the table, along with a blue pen. He takes a deep breath and cracks it to the latest entry.
“God forbid a hibiscius.”
"I don't want to interrupt your private time."
“Because why? What's your fuckin' deal, man? Why are you so weird about this?"
“Hey, how're you doing?”
Sam, who is clambering away in the kitchen, pipes up, "Yeah, it's blueberry, cherry, and orange! I had to borrow them from school."
“Hm,” She muses, “He seems dreamy.”
Castiel's heart beats faster the smaller his sandwich becomes. When he's done, he leaves his plate in the sink and stares at it, his heart stuck in his throat.
"I am not your mother."
“Okay, jerk.”
"Uhh,
“Things were... Better when we were little,” He says eventually. Castiel inches closer so he can hear better. “Before Mom died. We did stuff as a family, you know? Dad included. Family dinner and beach trips and all that shit. And it was... happy, I guess. Sam was too little to remember, I think. And then she died, and dad like...” He hesitates, “I dunno. Nevermind, it's stupid.” He turns red.
After dinner, Princess Leia scratches at the door to be let out, so Charlie volunteers her and Dean to take her on a walk. The Bradbury's live in a real neighborhood with enormous two-story houses and street lights. Unlike home, where there are mountains of snow all piled up on every corner, San Antonio has clear streets without a flake of snow in sight, even if some of the houses still have their Christmas lights on. It's a little cool out, but in a refreshing way, not nippy.
"Uh, I'm not working tonight?"
Castiel perks up, “Oh, yes. We used to go to the same church. He was one of the first disabled people I ever met.”
"Grape jelly and cheese is how they do it in some parts of France."
John stands slowly. He puts his book down and tucks his glasses into his shirt. He walks over to Dean and stares through him. "Hm. I can't seem to open the fridge. I wonder why," He says. Dean jumps out of the way, his stomach churning. John smirks. He roots around and pulls out a beer. "I wonder where my son is," He says, "Off being an ungrateful shit somewhere, no doubt." He doesn't look at Dean as he finishes the beer and goes to his room.
"Ugh," Dean groans, falling back on his pillow.
Dean scrubs his face with one hand.
Cas smiles reassuringly. "I agree. What episode were we just watching?"
He got all them wrong, but Castiel felt it impolite to correct him.
He takes a sharp breath, which makes him cough. "If I let you in, you will take her from me."
At 9:15, Dean is in the middle of washing an already spotless dish when the Roadhouse wall phone rings. He jumps. When Jo answers, her face falls.
"Thanks, man. I'm, uh, glad you're here."
“Hey, Dean, nice to meet you.”
He whips out his phone and puts it to his ear.
"What d'you mean?"
“Oh, please don't, Sam would hate you.”
“Not yet, anyway.” He pauses, “Hey, uh, do you mind if I smoke? He hates when I do it in the house.”
“Yeah?” Anna answers.
Dean salutes, "Aye aye."
Sam grimaces, running his fingers through his hair, “Kinda?”
As the party goes on, Castiel gets less and less sober, but compared to the frat brothers, he has an incredibly high tolerance. He outdrinks Zeke and Gabe by three or four beers, which just leads Luke and a couple other guys to keep handing him drinks, just to see how far he can go. He wins a round of beer pong and only then does his vision start to blur. There's dancing, on Bela as well as a couple of her friends, his head rolling back to rest on Bela's shoulder while they wriggle in time to the music. He catches Dean watching him from the sidelines, his face a stark shade of pink. Castiel isn't sober enough to try to decipher what his expression means.
"Oh no," He groans, trying to wriggle out of her grasp, but she's got him in a vice grip.
"Hey..." Dean says, putting a hand on Castiel's thigh. He's seated on the floor, his upper half curled around Cas' legs, genuflecting at the altar of Castiel. "That sucks, dude.”
"I like the hair," Dean says, because he does, even if the black looked better in his opinion.
“Shit, um, I'm kinda coming down now, which is good 'cause I could barely put two words together earlier. Uh. I guess it's like you're floating? And everything is really funny, like, really funny.”
“You know it.”
"Thank you, μαμά." Castiel interrupts.
He shows her his phone. Her eyebrows raise steadily as she reads it.
Dean chokes on nothing, which makes Sam laugh from the kitchen. "Jesus," he splutters.
He looks up at where Dean is biting his lip in anticipation.
Castiel pauses for a moment. How can Dean be missing something so obviously? “Dean.”
Bobby has turned to leave the wine bottle on the counter when Castiel asks, "Is it true you attempted suicide?"
Dean swings a left on his way out of the complex. The main road is to the right, but he really shouldn’t be doing 50 in his state. It’s a few minutes longer trip, but whatever, he likes driving.
His heart sinks. "Oh." He turns away.
Castiel shrugs with his whole body as if to say, what are you gonna do about it? and even Bobby snorts.
“Yes,” He chuckles, “We still have to read books.”
“Oh, thank you,” Castiel says, turning pink.
"Like," Dean flushes, "Like us spending the night together. Alone."
"Maybe,” Castiel shrugs, “But we were young."
Mr. B makes them veggie omelettes and Dean has his with extra bacon. After that, Dean showers and uses Charlie's nice-smelling body wash. He belts Asia until she bangs on the door to tell him to shut up. He laughs.
He glances at John's door, where he can hear him stirring. "Uh. I dunno, just wondering."
“Cas!” Sam says, opening the door with a smile.
“It's alright,” He would say, “It isn't your fault.”
Cas runs his hands through his hair one last time. "Yes."
"Oh, yeah, it's awesome,” He says, crossing his arms, “It's not all parties and booze, you know, they're actually a community service frat, too."
Adra nods, “Yes, with Missouri. It was in the chapel a couple floors below us.”
A little while later, Sam is making his way over to the tree when he trips on a wrinkle in the rug and smashes his mug. Cocoa splatters all over the floor and Sam's jeans. Castiel goes to grab a thing of paper towels while he hobbles off to get changed. When Cas comes back into the living room, several things happen at once: an orange cat jumps out from behind the tree and latches onto Dean's leg; Dean jumps back, slips on the hot cocoa mess, and lands hard on the floor. The cat yells and scampers away, knocking a few more things over in the process. Castiel watches the small, white thing Dean was holding arc into the air.
One Saturday, Dean is sitting at the kitchen table reading over a life insurance letter when Adra pushes a familiar cardboard box across to him.
“Dean,” He says, because that's all there is. Him and Dean and the hospital bed.
He hesitates. "No."
Back at the table, Dean leans over to Castiel and whispers, “Don't tell my dad, but I haven't been doing my homework 'cause Sam let a stray cat in last week, and we've been trying to take care of it while also hiding it from him.”
“I dunno,” Sam shakes his head, “I think there's meaning behind it all.”
“Oh, uh, I was joking.”
It's a sunny day, and the church's big open windows spill stained-glass colors across the floor. Jo's hair is pulled back into a ponytail, but she goes to tuck it behind her ear anyway. From the pews, Dean gives her a thumbs up. She grimacesmiles back.
They sit opposite one another on the Novak's couch, curled up under a single large quilt. Dean is working through
Bobby turns red, "I'm just tryin' to help you, boy."
He sighs. What-fucking-ever.
“Yes. My... friend dropped me off.” The word feels weird on his tongue.
“Castiel?” His mother's voice says from down the hall.
An older gentleman greets them at the door with a polite but sorry smile.
He knows what he wants, though.
"You know, before we got here Jo was implying some very salacious things about you," He says. They stop under some trees, the first part of a walking path that goes deeper through the forest. Someone has strung fairy lights over the path for a ways, but otherwise it's dark and still. A row of pine trees wall off this spot from any peering eyes in the trailers nearby.
Lunch isn't bad overall, considering the horrible spirits it started with.
“Oh, αγόρι μου,” She mutters, wiping her nose with her sleeve.
"What are you talking about?" Castiel unbuckles and pivots so he's facing Dean. Dean dares to look over at his friend, who is squinting, "I wanted to, Dean. Am I, am I missing something?"
“Hey Mom.”
Sam takes a deep breath and does. A couple times, Dean stops him to explain a formula or why something is a given, and Sam backtracks and explains it. After a minute or two, Dean nods.
Dean snorts. “Fair enough.”
“Kid, if you wanna get going, you can. You don't have to work today,” Ellen says, giving him her best worried-mom eyes.
At that Castiel perks up, and wriggles himself into a sitting position. He coughs a couple times. “Oh?”
Castiel rolls his eyes, “Fine with me.”
He spins around to find Kevin rushing over, lugging a cello case as big as he is. They hug, Kevin breathing hard.
“Yeah?” Jo asks, taking the bottle back from Sam. They pass it between them a few more times.
He flushes, “I did not mean to upset you.”
He snorts.
He swivels on his boyfriend, bewildered, "What do you mean you've never had a cheese dog?"
Sam raises his eyebrows, "Really?"
"Thank you."
“Right.”
“Ah. I don't think you ruined Christmas.”
Dean buries himself in his blankets and turns away from Charlie so the brightness of his phone doesn't bother her. He starts to tell Castiel about what she said earlier about the two of them, but he stops. It feels wrong to joke about for some reason. So instead, he tells Cas about Princess Leia and how Mrs B uses her as a sled dog when she uses her wheelchair.
Sam frowns. Castiel tries not to feel bad. He goes back to sipping his water, trying not to let his annoyance show.
The rest of dinner goes well. Sam brings out mac and cheese, burgers, and finally blueberry pie. The mac and cheese is box and Sam added too much garlic powder, and the blueberry pie is soggy on the bottom, but it's a meal well done as far as Castiel's concerned.
Castiel pats the spot next to him. Jo swings the table out of the way and Sam goes over, sitting down on the bed gingerly.
“We gotta find you a boyfriend,” She says at one point while they're lying in the grass.
Sam just groans and buries himself deeper into his homework.
He can't. There's nothing of the old John left. Dean's heart breaks when he says, "So pick it up."
"Um," Dean says. He wants to lean forward again, but he's frozen in place.
“We uh, we grew up on the road,” Dean says, “Sam and me. John, too, of course. We lived all over. It was fine, y'know? We had each other. But one day, Dad got a call from Bobby, something about the hardware store up the road needing some guys, and John uh, well, he got off the call, quit his job right there and told us to get packing. We left that night and got here in two days when it should've taken three. I think... I think we missed it, ya know?”
“Thank you.”
They wind up getting into an argument about who would win in a fight, a vampire or a werewolf, before it veers off into philosophy: what makes a monster a monster, do monsters have to follow the rules set by their legends or is it a carefully curated image? Castiel insists on the former, Dean the latter.
"So, uh, what did you and Bobby talk about for so long?" He asks, handing a glass over.
He's putting dishes away when Dean wanders in to root through the fridge.
Castiel purses his lips, "I never heard from him again. Eventually his emails started bouncing. We stayed an extra week just in case, but... Eventually we had to go home."
He takes a deep breath, feeling it down to the bottom of his lungs.
“Mon dieu,” Adra mutters, “Will he be okay waiting that long?”
“How was it?”
“Any time.”
“Are you prepared for a zombie apocalypse?”
“Look, I gotta get to work.”
Victor huffs, "You said it." A nurse grabs him right away, leaving Dean milling awkwardly in the doorway.
"Uh. So, d'you think I should tell Sam?"
More people come in the longer Dean sits there. Eventually, the nurses have to usher everyone who isn't actually bedridden out, so the dead knights wind up huddled around the purses-and-coats tent.
“No thank you.”
He takes a deep breath in, hold, out, and goes downstairs.
“I'm kidding, dude.”
He almost says
"Does that help?"
Sam digs his heel into the ground, "Um. Do you have any memories of me and her?"
The kitchen table is covered in crap. Jesus. He just cleaned this, what, last week? Ew. Dean holds the ham and cheese roll between his teeth and stacks loose papers on top of one another, consolidates the pens and markers, and collects the used napkins into a pile, nearly gagging when he has to touch them.
"Because."
Cas checks the garden on Thursday after school. The sun is setting later in the day, giving him enough time after he gets home from the library to give everything a once-over. He fills the watering can with hose water and passes over each plot of land methodically. A couple times, there is scuffling behind him and his heart picks up before he can stop it. But no one else is out there with him, just a stray squirrel or a bird.
Him and Anna. They do something different every year. Last year there was a benefit concert for an animal sanctuary that was threatening to close it's doors, and the year before that they got Chinese and watched 80s sci-fi movies until Adra fell asleep on the couch.
He settles back onto his pillows.
And back up the stairs they go, Adra glancing back at him.
“Uh,” Dean pulls back, “Hang on, aren't you sick?”
He grunts appreciatively. She checks his pillows and his catheter and refills the cup of water that has evaporated by his bedside. He's creeping back into consciousness, but everything is fuzzy and far away. The first thing he notices when he can focus his eyes again is that Meg has dyed her hair brown.
The drugs that almost killed him yesterday. He sighs.
Castiel hesitates, but nods. Yes, next time.
-- so he just looks over to Jo and they head out.
He drags the trashcan over, dumping in the napkins and any of the pens with mysterious gunk on them.
"Oh, before you go." She holds a row of condoms out. "Take these."
The dirt path goes for a while, twisting deeper into the woods before it ends all of a sudden. At the edge of the path is a clearing just before a steep drop. Beyond the drop is the city, far enough away that if Dean sticks his thumb out and closes one eye, he can cover the whole thing.
Castiel startles. “I have a school project.”
“Sure. Cool,” He says, “Yeah, I heard the kids in the library are viscous, we don't wanna leave our stuff unattended too long.”
“That bad, huh?”
Sam grins, "Sure."
"Uh. I mean." He doesn't know how to say that yes, that was exactly his intention, but didn't expect Castiel to be so blunt about it.
He sighs, relieved, “Oh.”
"Fingers crossed," the girl says.
“Yeah, me, Sammy, and Mom. Well, also the Harvelles, our next-door neighbors; They're basically family.” He smiles as he says it and there it is again, that warm-fast feeling spreading through Castiel's chest. He stares firmly down at his coffee cup until it subsides.
"Uh, anyway, what's next?"
“What?” Jo asks.
“Still. He could be less annoying.”
Oh, this piques Cas' interest, “Do you know anyone who's interested in directing? We do a production of Rocky Horror every year and we have yet to find someone.”
Which brings him to now: sitting cross-legged in bed, hungover, and absolutely starving. He could go for the greasiest, fattiest breakfast possible right about now. Turning the brightness all the way down, he checks his phone, which he was thankfully cognizant enough to put on a charger last night.
It isn't until he sits down that he realizes Dean wrote his number on the coffee cup.
"You know what you want yet?"
Dean falters a step before he makes it fully into the room, his gaze sweeping over the machines, the gifts, and Castiel, slowly. “Hey, Cas.” He swallows a couple times.
He lights up. It's been too rainy for the river lately, but today is supposed to be nice.
“Yeah, I'm a waiter,” Dean says, following.
The theater lights blink once, twice, and everyone falls into a hush. A middle-aged man comes up to the podium and introduces himself as the director, and talks for a while about how proud he is of all the work the performers put in. He thanks the school for letting them use the space, and thanks a few more people before leaving. The lights go down for good and Sam settles in.
“What do you have there?” She asks, pointing with two fingers.
Cas raises an eyebrow, “I could say the same about you.”
"Good to see you, man."
Dean unthreads their fingers. "Dad's home." Oh, merde.
“Okay... And?”
“I – Thank you for telling me,” She says, looking him up and down.
She comes close a little easier, with more open curiosity. She touches the bedside table, picks up a book and skims the back, “I think Mom read this one.”
There's a beat of silence, "Sorry."
"Well, I'm currently on a date with my friend, but he's not a great conversationalist so far."
He jerks his thumb down towards the road into town, “This way.”
"Who's the football game versus this weekend?" She asks.
“Damn, Sam, you're gonna finish all those?” Dean asks.
"I'll go," Sam says. Dean gives him a one-armed hug.
“Yes, it is,” He grumbles. Dean chuckles.
“But then I would have a cat and you would have one less thing to worry about.”
They start the movie. At some point, Sam moves to the edge of his seat, leaning over on his elbows to get a better view.
“He lives!” Bobby jokes when he comes into the kitchen.
“I'll give you two some time,” The doctor says, giving them a sympathetic nod. Dean waves her off and she heads out, closing the door behind her.
“How are ya?”
He turns away, "I dunno, like, the first time I went to Jess' house, her parents were really... I dunno. They kept asking me questions and stuff, about bookclub or you or whatever. It was weird."
“Hey,” She says.
Adra grimaces, “He wouldn't. My parents both died when he was very young, and I didn't have any brothers or sisters. I believe my mother has a sibling out west somewhere, but I'm not sure.”
“What?”
She looks at him with one eyebrow raised. He shakes his head. Some people!
He draws his arms tighter around his chest.
She squeezes his hand and nods, “How do you feel about getting a transplant?”
There's a pregnant pause. Castiel hesitates, then pushes the door open.
Cas glances at Dean then back to John, "I live with my mother, she's an auditor at a university."
Woodshop is fine. They're making bridges out of popsicle sticks, and more than one of Dean's classmates makes theirs look like a dick. He gets a laugh out of it. He flirts with some of the girls. All in all, not a bad class, except he's so distracted he almost forgets his bookbag on the way out.
Dean nods awkwardly at his father and takes his coffee out to the back porch.
“Yes.” He explains what the doctor's told him. He coughs and spits a wad into a napkin. Jo and Dean make identical grossed-out faces and he huffs a laugh.
He chuckles, coughs, and groans twice.
They make three batches, and by the time they're done Dean's hands have stopped shaking. Bobby half-smiles at him and heaps an extra few onto his plate. They're just as good as he remembers. He almost forgets to worry, until his phone rings.
“Movie night? It's Monday, you weirdo.”
“A little warm, but alive.”
"Hang on, are you actually out?" She tugs the arrows off him with a little pop.
“Okay, see you soon.” He hangs up before he hears her reply, and she disappears from the window.
Castiel hugs him and he lets him go. He faces the group, “I'm glad you all could make it.”
Oh. Cas' breath catches in his throat, which makes him cough again.
Jo shakes her head, “Whatever. Your mom is the coolest, you know that, right?”
"No!" Sam defends from his spot on the couch. "Dean just thinks it's a chick flick. But it's good, I promise."
He looks away. Out in the hallway, the parents who were waiting in here earlier go by.
While Castiel is formulating his reply, the waitress comes by and hands them their coffee. Cas immediately starts dumping sugar packets into his, while Dean just blows on his and takes a sip.
Dean flips open the cover. Paper-clipped to the front is a picture of the two of them laughing together. Beneath it:
Castiel takes a breath, in, hold, and out. Riding a surge of bravery, he swoops down and pulls a cardboard box labelled "Castiel's Catacombs" out from under his bed. He gestures for Dean to have a seat, and he sits cross-legged across from him. In between them is the phrase 'Castiel was here' scratched into the floor.
Hm. He tries to swallow the disappointment. It tastes like salt.
Upstairs, the guest room has accumulated so many of Dean's things over the years that it's basically his second bedroom. There's a desk, a dresser, and a bookshelf, the latter of which currently holds the textbooks he needs to return and a cactus.
She nods with vigor, “Fuck yes. Please.”
Once the pie is delivered, she squeezes Castiel's elbow, wishes him good night, and leaves. He watches her march down to the car. She smiles at him before she drives off, although it comes off more like a grimace.
“Oh, it's good. Dean and I looked over everything last night. The hydrangeas are coming along now that we've gotten rid of the bugs.”
"Uh, Dad, this is Castiel. Cas, Dad." John studies Cas, as if assessing whether or not he's a threat.
"Yes, it is."
“You know it.” He waggles his eyebrows, and the two of them dissolves into giggles.
“Thank you.”
She drives away and he goes inside. It's just a hair too cold considering the weather, and it sends a shiver up his spine.
He bites his lip, rocking back on his feet a little. A clink from the kitchen tells them that Sam is still nearby. "Wanna, uh, go for a walk?"
"Anna!" He shouts, the cold prickling his oversensitive skin, "Anna! Where are you, Anna?"
Jo shakes her head, "By a long shot. I think she still sees me as the little girl in pigtails, if you know what I mean."
“Yeah. I'm, uh, going to see her after school, but maybe y'all could swing by afterwards?”
“Oh god,” Jo sighs.
“I think I need to uh, stretch my legs for a bit,” Dean says once Sam leaves, looking off into middle distance.
Anna's roommate is flung sideways in the armchair, tossing a little ball up in the air with one hand and catching it in the same.
And that's that. Jo gets the remaining table on Cas' side, dancing to the music as she goes. Someone left their whole purse on the seat -- she suspects it was the family with the screaming kid –  so she brings it up to the bar and Ellen calls the number they found in the wallet.
Thunk! Something hollow whacks Dean on the back and he goes down. Shit, that's 10 HP easily. He scrambles to pick up the spell packets he missed, but the goblin in front of him is unfrozen, and starts smacking him with his club.
She hands him his coffee – a large, though he only paid for a medium – and winks.
