"Oh Baby Boy. You're so good to me. Working for your tip..." Castiel, encouraged, increases the speed of his strokes and leans forward slightly, placing his wet lips at the tip of Dean's cock. It tastes like honey and Castiel licks shyly around the head. Dean growls and clenches and unclenches his fists. Purses his lips out. Castiel becomes drunk with lust at the taste of Dean's dick. He whispers to Dean with his lips still grazing the head.
"But Cas…" Sam throws up an arm to protect himself from a shelf that just misses him and falls to land at his feet.
"Jack…I’m…I’m sorry…." Dean can be heard muttering prayers helplessly from above them both. "He loved you. He loved you so much." Jack is shaking his head. He takes another step further away from Sam. Finally deciding to go back on his word to Cas. To confess.
He closes his eyes for a moment and breathes in deeply. The barn is cleaner than the one where he and Dean first met, though matching closely in design. Where the table used to stand, Castiel has placed a bed, and two side tables, with lamps. A kitchen was added to the back of the barn and a game slash media room adjacent to the library. The loft now holds extra blankets, pillows and several musical instruments, as well as two telescopes, which aim at the large windows.
Cas leans against the door, thinking to himself 'He’s in so much pain. He believes he’s in the wrong, that he was wrong to speak to me the way he did that night. It isn’t fair. Dean…Don’t you realize the reason it hurt so badly to say the things you did, is because they were true?' He turns around and tries to make up his mind. Was it a mistake, coming back to the bunker? He could go back into hiding. Maybe contact Anael, if she was still alive…
"Jack, forgive me. I love you so much. It was all my fault, all of it…." Jack wraps his arms around Castiel and closes his eyes. Cas sobs into him and Jack kisses Castiel’s face, his hair, the collar of his trench coat. "Jack. You’re alive. You’re safe. Home. I love you. What I’ve wanted for so long…..to see your face again….to hear your voice. To hold you. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!" Jack leans against Castiel and closes his eyes, returning his hug.
"No, there isn’t. Not now.." He’s looking at Castiel as if he had come back from the dead. "Cas. Don’t leave me again. I need you here. I need you always. Promise you’ll never leave me again." Castiel lowers himself down and kisses Dean on the forehead.
"It...it's sweet...m'like it....mmmmm….it's nice..." Castiel spreads his lips a little further over the head, sucking just the tip. Dean coaches him.
Dean leaps out of bed. Sam’s jaw has dropped to the floor. They both run to Jack to embrace him. Jack presses his face against their shoulders. Sam fumbles for the right words, not believing what's just happened. Billie held too much of a grudge towards the Winchesters for the way they've skirted death time and time again, to randomly gift them like this.
“What is it?” Dean moves to be behind Sam, so he can get a look at the image on the computer screen.
Dean starts to hum to himself. He continues along on his walk, until the path leads him to an open field. He’s surrounded by tall grass on one side of the path, and corn stalks on the other. It’s still dark out and Dean looks up at the sky to see a shooting star pass overhead.
"Where’s Cas? He can’t still be out there!?!" Dean is pounding at the door in agony. Jack's face pales as he finally realizes what's going on.
I wanted to. But you know you still have an aversion to certain electronic devices. It was easier just to...”
“We scanned your face after you got blasted on that ghost hunt last week. You know, after you had passed out.” Sam glares at his brother. Cas sits up straight in his seat.
When Sam and Dean see the “decorations”, they pale. About ten zombie corpses lie scattered all over the grass and dirt road, decapitated, their heads separated from their bodies. The moon reflecting off of the splattered blood, gave the impression of light up decorations, or glitter. One kid walks over to one of the heads and picks it up…
. He remembered the kid had a thing for nougat. Castiel had never failed to keep the kitchen stocked for him. Sam continues to shake his head. He feels like there's something he's missing, here.
"Sam, there’s something I need to tell you. When you brought me back to life, Cas and I were in heaven…..Castiel….." His lips begin to tremble. "Castiel.."
"Why the hold up!?!?!?! You said you would be right fucking back!!" Jophiel moves towards Cas, but Lailah holds onto his arm.
"Sam, what’s going on? Dean was just praying to me, before you arrived. He was saying he hasn’t eaten in days, and you look…" Sam interrupts Castiel and grabs him by the arm. Before Castiel has time to blink, he finds himself inside the bunker. Sam takes him and leads Castiel to Dean’s room. Dean is trying to pray to Castiel, but struggling..
"Castiel! We can’t just leave two dead vampire corpses in the woods for humans to find, later! We have to hide the evidence. Do you want to start a panic in the community?" Castiel stops to turn back and look at them. His face looks pained, and there is a small flash of anger in his eyes.
Castiel turns on Jophiel slowly. Aglibol, Lailah and Jophiel freeze, not daring to move. Their faces pale. Cas’s eyes are burning blue, his skin starts to glow, only flickering due to lack of power but at the same time menacing enough, and his grip on his machete tightens. The leaves from the trees in the forest start to rustle. Jophiel gulps. He holds up both hands in defense.
"We need to leave this place, now!" His mood has shifted again and he seems much tenser than he was, just moments before. Lailah has set the head down, gently, out of respect for such a young victim [ignoring the fact that he wasn’t just dangling the head by its hair, a minute ago]. He turns to look at Castiel in surprise.
"You know we can’t. If they were to find out that monsters like this actually existed, that we existed, there would be complete chaos. The humans would.."
"Look what you made Daddy do. Look at this mess. Look at how wet Daddy is all over." Castiel looks up at Dean, his lips parted slightly. He reaches down to unzip his fly, releasing his fully erect cock and starts to jerk off while still on his knees, looking up at Dean.
"A vampire holding you down to the ground, snapping at your face and all Castiel does is turn around and head in the opposite direction saying ‘He’ll be right back’, like your life isn’t in jeopardy or anything?!?! You could’ve been killed! If Aglibol and I hadn’t been here..." He turns to face Castiel, seething. "Hey, you know what? Why am I even surprised, though!? It’s not like it was DEAN WINCHESTER neck to neck with a blood sucking.."
"Dirty Boy. Naughty...Little whore, little bitch boy. Sucking cock." Castiel puts both hands on Dean's hips and without thinking, swallows Dean's dick whole, devouring him hungrily. He starts to suck and bob his head. Dean roars out loud, clasping the back of Castiel's head and gripping hard.
Aglibol doesn’t understand Castiel’s motives for leaving the vampire bodies to be discovered by the human race. He would try reading Castiel’s mind, but like Angel Radio, any thoughts he might manage to pick up could be warbled, and messed in with Castiel’s memories, past conversations he’s had… Aglibol’s afraid to touch Castiel again, so he slowly passes him on his way back to the jeep. Shortly afterwards, he hears Castiel follow him.
"Sam, it’s good to see you. I’m sorry I left without saying goodbye." Cas doesn’t know what to do. He now feels he should leave. But his feet won’t cooperate and Sam is gripping his shoulders, too tightly. He thinks to himself 'I’ll make you both regret keeping me. Why do care so much about me, after all I’ve put you through?'
Castiel approaches the door tentatively and knocks, loudly. After a short while a man with blonde hair and green eyes opens the door. He's stark naked, not even a towel around his waist. Castiel's breath hitches and Dean Winchester smiles. He's the most attractive person Castiel has ever seen, in his life. He just stands there, staring with his jaw hanging open. Dean takes a step back and palms himself. He's slick all over, as if from just showering or...is he in the middle of getting done with a massage? He notices a bottle of lube still on the bed and realizes Dean was masturbating while Castiel was knocking on the door. Cas clears his throat and nervously quotes the total for the pizza. Dean looks Castiel up and down and licks his lips before taking the pizza and setting it down on a nearby table. He then goes to get his wallet. Dean has to turn around to grab it out of his coat and Castiel can feel his face burning at the sight of Dean's perfect bubble butt. Jesus... Dean turns around with one hand over his bulge and the other waving around the exact amount that Castiel had quoted. He stutters a moment, wondering if Dean made a mistake. Dean takes note and winks.
“Cas. Wait there for me..” Dean watches Castiel fall to the ground, his knees giving out from underneath him. He wants to run to him, but instead takes his time. Step by step.
Aglibol doesn’t understand his tie with the moon, or how he’s supposed to manipulate it, draw power from it. When it happened, it happened. 'Could of used some of that juice a moment ago', he thinks to himself. When he had been told his title and been assigned to it, he didn’t ask questions, not caring at all. God of the Moon. How tacky of a title was that for an angel of the Lord? What had irked him the most was when many started to convince him that he was an actual God, and that he should stop fighting alongside other angels, and instead start to lead them, control them and talk down to them. But after watching the anguish that Castiel had gone through, when Metatron was manipulating the puppet strings in Chuck’s absence, forcing him to lead when Cas was uncomfortable with the idea..
Sam looks at Dean, with an amused (irritated) expression on his face. It was like that episode of 'Friends' where Joey thought he could audition for the role of a teenager.
"Castiel." Jack gently approaches Castiel by moving towards the bed with his arms open. Castiel flies at Jack and crashes into him, wrapping his arms possessively around Jack, not wanting to let go.
"Bad timing, Castiel." Billie has appeared in Dean’s bedroom. She looks mildly interested in what’s been going on with the Winchesters but for once, almost looks sad, regretful. Sam moves towards Dean’s bed, protectively.
Castiel doesn’t notice that Lailah and Jophiel have gone back into the woods to burn and bury the vampire remains. It would take longer than usual. All of their powers have weakened over the years, since they preferred sanctuary on earth more than any of God’s angels, as opposed to heaven. They relied mostly now on getting random re-charges from lighting in thunder storms. Jophiel and Lailah had burnt out most of their lightning charge from fighting the vampire. Now, they’d have to resort to making a fire the way any old human would, and watch the forecast for the next big thunderstorm.
“Thank you Dean.” Cas closes his eyes and lets out a heavy sigh, as he leans back into his seat. "It was closer to home, this time. Even with the warding, I worry about…”
"Yeah, Baby. Good sub. Such a good submissive. Sucking my dick like a pro, and still just a baby...Stroke it. Work my dick with your hand while you suck.." Castiel obliges and grips Dean's dick slightly as he starts to pump. His lips spread wider over the head, as he takes more of Dean in his mouth. Dean sees the shine of the wet all over Castiel's face from sweating and he laughs meanly.
Dean’s a little frustrated, but then sees that Castiel is still holding the bag full of candy bars, and he melts. Sighing, Dean pulls Cas in for a hug. For the first time, Cas doesn’t stiffen, doesn’t hesitate…he’s been through too much. Losing Jack had left him more vulnerable than Dean has ever seen him. Cas drops the bag and wraps both arms around Dean’s waist, closing his eyes. Dean kisses the top of Castiel’s head.
Behind the barn, Castiel added a hot spring with a view of the mountains and with a patio set up, complete with grill and mini bar. He’s enjoyed the taste of food, while in heaven. The chemical taste gone, Jack never forgot Castiel’s envy for a human being’s taste buds. Now, all supernatural beings could appreciate food like most humans could. While immune to several species, the death rate and the murderess spree on earth had shifted off of demons, angels, and even werewolves. While not eliminating the need to consume live game and blood for most beings, a new tolerance for the human species had developed. A new level of respect. Jack told Castiel that it had been because of him, but Castiel never really believed that.
"What, nothing? Didn't you get to play?..." Dean starts thrusting his hips forward and Castiel watches, mesmerized, as Dean lets go of his cock and starts bouncing it around in front of Castiel's face. He can't help but reach for it, while licking his lips. Dean laughs.
Castiel’s face is frozen in shock, …and fear. His lips have parted open, and he’s shaking violently. Cas lets out a gasp that comes out as a cry, his eyes wide. Jack slowly steps away from Sam and Dean and goes towards Castiel, who is panting heavily, as if struggling to breathe.
They both arrive at the jeep and Aglibol leans against it, waiting for Jophiel and Lailah. Castiel starts to get into the passenger seat, but then hesitates. Instead, he shuts the passenger door and goes to the front of the car, climbing onto its hood. The moon can be seen in its full, and not a cloud in the sky. Aglibol looks up at it, bemusedly.
"Thank you Daddy..You're beautiful Daddy. So perfect, so big and strong. Such a big cock. I almost choked on it Daddy..." Dean grunts and his stomach spasms and Castiel automatically opens his mouth and tilts his chin upwards.
"CASTIEL!!! What are you waiting for?!?!" Castiel takes the vampire by the top of its head and violently pushes him to the ground. Jophiel and Aglibol release their grip. Castiel steps on the vampire’s head with one foot pressing down and Aglibol throws himself over the vampire’s legs as he tries once more to get through to Castiel, who seems as if he's in a trance.
Suddenly, all anyone can see is red. The alarms to the bunker have gone on full alert. Castiel has gone limp in Jack’s arms. He’s stopped shaking and his breathing has calmed, though tears still stream down his face. He takes Jack’s head in his hands and kisses his eyes, his cheeks. Then, Castiel holds Jack away from him and attempts to appear as calm as possible.
Had he kissed Cas? Or had Cas kissed him. Dean didn’t care, couldn’t care. All he knew was that they were kissing and, for the first time, everything made sense. Cas was warmth, he was light. It was as if he were holding the sun. Dean’s whole life had been building to this moment, he thought. All the pain, all the sadness, existed to make this moment perfect by comparison. For the first time, he was happy. Happy in a way he hadn’t known existed until now. He could never could go back. He could never give this up.
“That,” Lucifer snorts, bent over with mirth, “was way more fun than I thought it would be. And much, much,
“Considering we’ve been having variations of this conversation for the past hour, I think we can infer.”
“You can’t rush good Television,” Alistair chides him gently, absently pulling at one of his finger nails: dragging it slowly from its bed. “Not without messing up the pacing. Now,” he smiles slyly, “if you were allow me to…improvise, to go off script, so to speak, I could break you in seconds.”
He found a canvas backpack under his bed and set to packing. There wasn’t much to it. Aside from the necessities, there wasn’t much he could take with him. Nothing much seemed like it would be appropriate anyway:  they were relics of a life that didn’t exist anymore. After some consideration, he took some of the books Sam had always bugged him to read; his sleeping bag and two spare sets of clothes. Lingering over the pile on his bed, he carefully removed the smaller pictures from their frames and slid them between the pages of
“Dean,” Cas’ voice is soft as he steps forward to rest his hands on her forearms. His fingers are nearly long enough to encircle them completely, but his grip remains loose and warm. “Can I?” He asks, and she nods, letting him move her arms apart.
Cas feels his heartbeat speed up – which is strange because he doesn’t typically use his heart for anything physical. “Coming from you I’m not sure which is the bigger compliment.”
So it was that Dean was cleaning alone, Charlie lying flu ridden on his sofa, when the strange not-quite-stranger stepped through his doors.
“Sammy!” Dean yelled after him, but his brother didn’t stop, didn’t look back. He was soon swallowed by the darkness once more.
“Don’t mention it Dad. It’s gonna be a busy day.” Dean smiled at his father, John smiled back. The arguments of the previous day forgotten, it seemed, in the wake of bacon.
“Son,” he whispered, “whatever phase you’re going through right now – not going to church, arguing with me, with the teachers, with Pastor Walker – leave it! I’ve tried to help you, but you’ve been determined to ignore me and anyone else who knows what’s good for you. I’ve given you more than enough time to deal with everything and I’m telling you: it ends now. Pastor Jim is the backbone of this community, and he’s done more for this family than your wretched little ass. I won’t have you disrespecting him or his beliefs. Is that clear?”
“I kinda have to don’t I?” Dean sighs again, shooting him a weary look. “And we need to talk too don’t we?”
It was, Dean saw as he thought about everything. “Yeah. I’m sick of people blaming me for their issues. Dad, Uriel, this whole goddam town...” he trailed off, lost in thought.
“Won’t it be suspicious?” he was so tense, she noted, trying to hold himself together with sheer willpower alone.
Sam ignored the warning. “I told you that you were destroying our family, that we would never be together again because of you.”
Dean makes a soft noise that is almost a laugh. “It can’t just be me Cas,” he says patiently. Or desperately. Maybe both at once. “I know this is the ‘make Dean talk’ part of the adventure, but this is about both of us – an’ I haven’t just escaped from a magical hell tour of your mind so I really need to know where you’re coming from.”
“No,” he hoped the panic in his voice would be interpreted as pain. “Why Dad, am I doing something wrong?”
Eventually, however, they were left in relative seclusion. Missouri retreated to her desk, though occasionally her eyes would drift back to the curious sight.
“There is,” Alistair breaks in. “You can get back on the rack and we’ll go back to where we started. If that’s what you want. I can’t force you – it’s against my religion.”
“You’ll understand when you’re older.” Dean’s gaze shifts from Sam to Castiel, who’s watching the scene unfold with a deep sadness in his face. “I don’t know you yet, Cas. Mournin’ a man you never met?”
They needed a plan. Urgently. Castiel had considered hundreds of options, and discarded them all. Every plan required either a car or a miracle, both of which were hard to come by if you were a queer teenage boy.  He’d even briefly contemplated calling his Mom, but he knew she wouldn’t accept Dean anymore than Jim had.
“Dean must not have looked out the window,” Cas says. “So as far as this memory is concerned, the rest of the window  and everything beyond what he saw outside it doesn’t exist – only the parts of the world that he interacted with have been replicated, nothing more, nothing less.”
His eyes met Castiel’s and seemed to dare him to say something, anything about his disrespect. Castiel knew a good son should stand up for his father, but something about Dean Winchester made him want to laugh instead.
Sam shakes his head. “No, god no. I’ll do it it’s just…give me a sec,” Sam pauses, gathers his thoughts and, with a visible effort, speaks. “You know when we were um…well, after Gadreel – y’know?”
Shrill shrieks from behind them broke the moment as Castiel whirled round to confront the sound.  The freshman had been watching them it seemed, one was making a jerk off motion with his hand. Dean blushed as he realised how they must look, on his knees, Cas’ hand.
Cas smiled, secretly thrilled that he’d used the nickname. He’d worried it had been a onetime thing but it rolled off Dean’s tongue as if he’d been saying it for years. “My day was shit,” he admitted cheerfully.
Losing what little was left of his patience, John pushed Dean into his room. “You will not corrupt Sam.” He ordered. “First I lost Mary, now I’ve lost you, I’m not risking Sam.”
Sam nods, stepping back to lean against the wall again and wishing distantly that his phone worked in the astral plain (he had checked earlier, with vague ideas of just phoning Dean, but there had been no signal and when he’d tried to touch the screen his finger had sank in a little like it were quick sand, making him loathe to repeat the experiment.)
Reaching down, she takes his dick in her hand and starts to stroke, grinning in satisfaction at the strangled noise he makes.  She thinks it’s probably the most human he’s ever sounded. She goes a little faster, and feels as he starts to thicken in her hand. He buries his face into her neck, and she puts her other hand in his hair.
“Thank you.” Cas was already halfway across the room. Dean was curled up on an old sofa, his face twisted into a grimace at an unpleasant dream.
“I’ll do whatever you need me to Dad.” He met his father’s gaze steadily, careful not to a let a flicker or emotion slip by. “I don’t want anything to do with Dean. Never again.”
“An’ folks, this wasn’t no Coppermouth nor was it a Diamondback; it was much, much more dangerous. See, those snakes don’t pretend to be anything but what they are. This snake, he hides in plain sight. He pretends to be just like you an’ me. But he ain’t like you an’ me. An’ just like the serpent that ensnared Eve all those years ago, he’s here to tempt you, to take you from the Lord’s loving hands and damn you to hell for all eternity, except he’s worse. Because he ain’t
“Ok,” he relents, noting that both Sam and Cas’ shoulders sag with relief. “But if you get so much as one speck of glitter anywhere on your body you’re walkin’ home. I ain’t riskin' my baby.”
“Your boyfriend tell you that?” Gordon asked dismissively. “Well he’ll be changing his tune soon enough, once he sees what you’ve condemned him too.” As he spoke they were pulling in to the Novak driveway. Dean barely noticed, he was trying to sort through Gordon’s words.
“Oh yeah? Lockin’ yourself away, keeping Sam and Cas out? What kinda strategy is that?” Bobby crosses his arms.
, even when you two’ve tried to rip it apart. I know my path and I’ve chosen to follow it no matter what, so you don’t
His hands were clutching Dean’s shoulders so hard he could feel it beneath his jacket. He bit back the retort he had been preparing, not wanting to antagonise his father any further.
detail, about every random hook up and flirt and whatever. Hell, you’d point at bars we drove past and tell me the name of the girls you’d screwed in the toilets. And yet the way I find out you’re into guys is because you got so drunk you forgot I was there?”
“I still don’t like it,” he meets Cas’ eyes in the mirror and sighs at the determination he sees in them, “but alright.” He’s rewarded by the sight of Cas visibly relaxing, and the sound of Sam’s gentle exhale. “Y’know,” he grumbles, “if I’d known you’d be this excited to go to some stupid parade we would’ve done this ages ago.”
She listened in silence as he told her what had happened, taking in his dishevelled from, the dark circles under his eyes, the bruises on his wrists. He was trying to keep his voice blank, emotionless, as if what he was describing had happened to someone else entirely.
The three of them fall back onto the bed. Dean runs one hand through Cassie’s hair, his other arm sprawled across the man’s chest.  The harsh light of the street lamp flickers out, replaced by the tepid light of dawn, lurking just behind the curtain.
The bell rang, reality forced its way in, and the two of them sprang apart, glancing around to make sure no one was staring at them.
It was only hours later, once they finally managed to escape Charlie, once they were lying exhausted and sweaty in each other’s arms that it finally occurred to Dean to ask the obvious question.
“Already did, an’ I didn’t die did I? Did I?” Dean starts to laugh but suddenly becomes serious as he tries to catch either Sam or Cas’ eyes.  “’M not dead am I Sammy? Cas? S’not some…soul quest thingy you guys are doin’ to bring me back?”
Sam stares at the writhing mass of flesh and hands for a few seconds, then whirls around so fast he almost collides with Cas, who is squinting towards the bed in confusion.
Cas comes up beside them, hooking an arm around Dean’s waist and pulling him shakily to his feet. “What was he saying to you?” Cas asks. “The ghost?”
“I’m proud of you son,” he said tearfully once it was over. He didn’t notice Castiel’s own glassy eyes, or if he did he dismissed it as happiness. “It’s not easy to see the light, but there’s good in you and the lord has rewarded it.”
“C’mon Bobby, keep up,” Dean throws over his shoulder, striding through the forest. “We haven’t got all day.”
Dean flinches, the car swivels slightly. He adjusts his hands on the wheel, shaking off Cas’. It hovers awkwardly in the air between them, until Cas lets it drop back into his lap. Dean’s face has closed off – the eyes are like flat disks or stones, the mouth is taught. He doesn’t speak, just hunches his shoulders – angling himself away from Cas.
God, the bible, his father, Pastor Jim, the whole fucking town, the whole fucking world. He angled the stone in his hand and sent it flying at the river. It bounced once along the surface of the river before sinking.  Frustrated, he began searching for another stone.
He had assumed what he felt was wrong. Why? Logically, he knew he had just heard a sermon on why it was wrong, but rather than strengthening his convictions, his father’s speech was causing them to crumble.
“Yeah well he was so busy spreading the word of God to the masses that he forgot to deal with the doubters back home, and what little he did say only made me more confused. It was all so hate filled and angry. Eventually I cracked: finally went and talked to Missouri.” It was impossible to miss the way Dean’s mouth quirked up at the corner. Sam snorted at that. “Yeah, she chewed me out royally for what an idiot I’d been. But she helped. Then I left to go to college: actually saw the world for what it was instead of what they told me it would be.” He shrugged, “that’s about it really. I graduated this past year: I’m going to start law school soon.”
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Dean asks, warily climbing to his feet. “’N how the fuck did you get here?”
Instead, he was treated to stony silence for the entire ride to the school. Anna answered his questions politely but obviously preferred staring out the window than talking to him.  Dean let quiet sit, it wasn’t until they were at the school that it occurred to him that Anna was annoyed him. He was alerted to the possibility when she practically ran from the car to the hall, not stopping to wait.
“I’m about an hour or so away…just let me get my shit together and I’ll meet you at that diner we spotted... no I’m not gonna shower…well I don’t care if you don’t wanna smell it… If you get there first order me some pancakes…Seriously? You’re gonna order salad for breakfast? Yeah, fruit salad is still salad,” he shakes his head. “Whatever dude. See you soon, ok?” he snaps the phone shut, looks around and frowns. “Where’s Jonah?”
Dean ignores him. Dimly, he can already see the road ahead: just a re-run of the road so far, paved (he knows) with the best of intentions and leading straight too…
“Why can’t this be about both of us? I am not interested in your pity, nor in what you think I want from you. I want to know what you want for yourself,” his voice is calm, and his eyes, when she finally meets them, show only a frank yet unobtrusive interest. Still it takes a few stretching moments for the question to permeate through her, and for her to allow the truth to pass from her lips.
Sam and Cas are arguing over doors. Or, more accurately, they’re arguing over what’s behind the doors. The doors themselves are rather boring: they’re doors after all. Doors that resemble the doors Sam and Cas pass every day in the bunker. On the boring doors are long strings of numbers telling them the date and time contained behind each door – or so they assume, having yet to actually open any of the doors. These numbers are the only interesting parts of the doors. They aren’t in chronological order, and without knowing what’s behind them, it’s impossible to figure out why any door is in any particular place, or what part of Dean’s brain they’re in. The not-quite-Dean Dean leans casually on one of the boring doors, watching Sam and Cas argue with a wry smile on his face.
“How about neither of you does it and we just move the fuck on?” Interjects the other Dean from the side, but even Cas ignores him now – every ounce of his (considerable) focus now trained on Sam.
“..not your fault John,” Jim was saying, looking not at John but at the onlookers, still in preacher mode. “There’s bad ‘uns in every family, not a thing you can do to stop ‘em.  An’ look at Sammy, how well he turned out with the same parents.”
“I guess there’s something special about you,” Sam says sarcastically. “Maybe your character just has more untapped potential than ours? Or maybe you can be relied upon to react in a more entertaining manner?”
“Dean,” Cassie hesitates, takes a deep breath and closes her eyes for a second, but continues. “What you said just then – is it…is it really the end?”
She can feel his hand reaching down between her legs, and she opens them a little wider. She expects his touch to be clumsy and rough, but his fingers are gentle, almost expert, as he starts to rub her clitoris in small circles that send sparks of pleasure up through her body. She’s panting and it’s becoming harder and harder to focus on anything except the warmth and rising pressure…
“Dean, wait, please.” He stilled Dean with a palm to the chest. “Before we –” he paused, trying to get his thoughts in order. It was hard with Dean so close. “I want, no I
head). So, once he’s balled up his coat to use as a pillow, the familiar and comforting vibrations of the engine and the road soon lull him into a dreamless sleep.
“Don’t you have literally anything else to do?” Dean had asked as she approached.  Hael had ignored him, as was her custom, focussing entirely on Castiel.
They tactfully ignored the slip up. “It’s because we have each other,” Cas had told her, grasping Dean’s had fondly.
“Sure Sammy,” Dean says wearily, getting to his feet. “And water isn’t wet and grass isn’t green. Come on. The door is at the bunker. It’s not that far.” Even as he speaks, the entrance has materialised a few feet away from them. Dean stops at the door. It’s different from the other doors – it has no dates, and instead of wood, it’s made of a dark, heavy metal. “This is it,” he says. “I’m through there.”
It was Uriel, a smug smile on his face and two figures at his shoulders. Michael and Ezekiel. He turned away, heart beating fast.
I realised like halfway through writing this chapter that this is supposed to be the 60s but there's no segregation or racism in the school or the town so...yeah i guess it now takes place in a weird timeless void where racism isn't as prevalent but mobile phones don't exist either.
“I said shut up!” Sam hisses again, but he makes no move to turn away – in fact he steps closer, glaring furiously (but ineffectively) at his (spell)brother.
Dean Winchester. The Righteous Man who triggered my release…” Dean’s eye twitches but otherwise he portrays no outward sign of emotion. Lucifer smirks anyway and continues. “…and who fought so hard and – I hate to say it but credit where credit is due – so effectively against me during my last little trip out.”
Luckily, Jim seemed pleased at the opportunity for an impromptu sermon. “Son, there’s nothing I wish for more than for everyone to be saved. I thought it was possible, for a long time I did. But what did I accomplish? All I did was bring sinners into contact with good people. I learned that people need to want to be saved, and Dean’s made it crystal clear that he don’t.” He paused, looking hard into the watching eyes. His eyes met Cas’ last of all, and he held his Son’s gaze as he finished, watching for any flicker of emotion.
He found the photos in a pile on his bed, along with everything else he owned. He should be relieved, he supposed, that there was anything left. He wouldn’t put it past John to burn everything. He discarded his ripped church clothes, and fished his favourite shirt and jeans from the bottom of a box marked
“Yeah that’s what I thought,” he says nastily, pressing down with his boot until Dean can’t help but gasp. “So, I’ll ask one more time. Do you know where Sam is?”
Stunned, all Cas could do was stare through his tears, hand on his reddening cheek. Nobody in the outer circle had reacted to the slap, except for Uriel, whose face suggested something akin to the second coming.
“You’re right, what do you suggest we do?” Cas checked to make sure they really were alone, so he could keep a hold of Dean’s hand.
Missouri had. She watched the two of them pensively. Those idiots probably thought they were being subtle, but there was nothing subtle about young love.  She remembered when she had been their age. Everything had been so much bigger then. There were times when she missed those days; when a simple kiss remade the world. If these boys weren’t careful, a kiss could mean the end of theirs.
Cas had imagined himself walking across the room, the class quieting to watch in his wake. He had walked straight up too Dean and kissed him squarely on the mouth, in full view of Uriel, Hael and everyone else.
The world around them shatters like glass, lurid rainbow light flowing like lava from the cracks. The night sky falls away, the trees meltdown and into nothing; the world shrinks to the small stretch of road, encroached on all sides by the raw form of Dean’s subconscious. “Go!” Dean shouts at Sam and Cas as he too begins to fade away: leaving nothing but a faint after image – hand pointing at the exit, the red smudge of his blood lingering longer than everything else.
As Sam movies the lighter slowly around, the tiny flame reveals a strange sculpture, still almost completely in shadow. It’s too straight to be random or a natural feature of the landscape, yet with odd protrusions and additions that speak of something organic.
They lapsed into a comfortable silence, both shooting furtive glances at one another when they thought the other wasn’t looking. Sam was trying to glean something of his brother’s missing years from his body: wondering at the scar he could see on Dean’s forearm, the tattoo peeking out from under his shirt collar. Dean, for his part, needed to make sure this was real.
“Why would they?” Dean sounded amused. “You’re in a gay diner Sammy; we don’t get many of your kind in here.”
“Good,” Sam can’t see Cas in the dark (pressing them in tight on either side), but he can hear the relief in his voice. “That was…disconcerting.”
She laughs because this is the funniest thing that’s happened to her in a while. She laughs hard enough that her stomach begins to hurt, and even Cas smiles. For a few seconds they stand apart; Dean is happy to catch her breath for a moment, and to take the opportunity to look at Cas properly.
Sam was already downstairs, nose deep in some book. “C’mon Sam, don’t read porn at the table.” He hit Sam on the back of the head playfully. “What d’you want for breakfast? Bacon?”
Bobby ignores him. “This spell you’re under is gonna do most everything it can to trap you. I know you know you gotta fight it.”
Cas grabbed his hand, hard enough to bruise. “It will be. We’ve done nothing wrong” He could see the conflict in Dean, could see how strong he was trying to be, for Cas, and how fragile he truly was. “You’ve done nothing wrong, Dean.” His voice was full of conviction now, and Dean tried to believe him.
“Yes,” Cas’ eyes follow Dean as he heads towards the kitchen, then turn to Sam’s. “How did it go?” he asks.
She’s not sure what to do with them when he lets go, except that she wants to be touching him again, and so she leans in close, pressing her body against his. She can feel the unnecessary beating of his heart (slow and steady) as she puts an ear to his chest, letting the vibrations reverberate through her: calming her own rapid heartbeats, leaving a warmth to settle into her stomach…
told myself, I couldn’t really see you as an abomination or a demon or anything. And part of it was Pastor Novak: he kept going further and further off the rails. Screaming every week about this sin or that transgression. And he was getting so big too: in all the papers, radios, even TV broadcasts”
“Maybe you didn’t mean to lock it,” Cas suggests, frowning in thought. “It could be an involuntary subconscious response – a way to protect yourself from the memories.”
Castiel swung round, grabbing Dean by the shoulders, forcing their eyes to meet. “Listen Dean,” he said fiercely, “everything everybody says about you is wrong. I may not have known you for long, but I know the real you. They don’t. I know that you’re kind, brilliant, hilarious and a million other things. You deserve the world, you aren’t meant to be stuck here with these people. Anyone who can’t see  that about you doesn’t deserve you.”
Dean’s eyes crinkle and he laughs softly. “Yeah: course. Do you, uh, wanna drive somewhere else? I think it’ll be easier in the car.”
Cassie shrugs. “We all need our ways to cope with the stress of it all – especially him,” she pauses, waiting for Dean to meet her eyes. “He worries about you, y’know. We both do.”
“Castiel! Dean! Did you see how many skips that was? It had to have been at least eight!” Sam was standing next the river, a pile of flat stones at his feet, beaming excitedly. Dean shot one last smile in Castiel’s direction before turning to his brother.
“Well I suppose we’re about to find out aren’t we?” Cas’ face is a mess of emotions. Abruptly, Sam remembers his constrained grace – anything Cas is feeling now is amplified well above what he’s used to. He looks distressed, scared and anxious – and Sam can’t help but empathise, as well as feel guiltily relieved that someone else is (at last) the focus of Dean’s psyche.
Dean was laughing so hard he nearly tipped over, and he slung an arm round Castiel to steady himself. The easy contact shocked both boys and they drew apart abruptly. Avoiding Castiel’s eyes, Dean couldn’t understand why his heart was beating so fast. He risked a glance to his right and saw that Castiel too was blushing. He opened his mouth, though he didn’t know what he was going to say, when a boyish shout saved him the trouble.
He nods, Dean feels the movement rather than seeing it, and together they push against the door. Blinding white light floods the room – smoothing the shadows and distorted proportions, leaving it just a room. Dean (both Deans) are the first to step over the threshold, then Sam then Cas, leaving the door open behind him.
How much of what he believed was actually his father’s rhetoric, forced into his brain since childhood? Jim and his mother had never gotten along it was true, but she had never exactly disagreed with him and had often taken Castiel to his sermons when he was in town.
He watched the eyes take him in, the split second of confusion as John’s memories were also forced to align with the present and the flash of recognition. With an unexpected clarity, Dean knew what his father was seeing. He was seeing a tall, tanned man with strong arms and broad shoulders standing staring at him with his dead wife’s eyes. He waited, though he wasn’t sure for what. The majority of him tensed in anticipation of violence, waiting for John’s eyes to harden with hatred, for his fist to pull back. A smaller, but unbearably loud, part of him ached for John’s posture to relax, for him to reach across the doorway and pull Dean into a hug: the kind he got when he’d fallen off his bike or when Mom had died.
“Thanks Jimmy.” John’s face was a mask of righteous fury, “To think of all the years I wasted on that boy. All the years Mary spent loving him...” for a brief moment, grief flickered over his face. Then it was gone, and the eyes were hard again. “Truth be told, it almost makes me glad Mary’s not here to see this. It would’ve broken her heart.”
It was 7 o’clock and Cas still wasn’t here. Dean’s head was constantly turning: searching the horizon for the bus and looking, desperately, for the familiar figure to emerge out of the gloom.
“I don’t know if you should be driving,” he says, hand reaching automatically for the keys, forgetting (for a brief, happy moment) where they are.
“The window,” Sam says instead of reacting to that statement the way he wants to, which would involve a lot of loud swearing and hand gestures that would attract too much attention to be worth risking right now. “Let’s try the window.”
“Looks cool though,” Dean illustrates his point by blowing a smoke ring into the night air.  “You get used to it.”
“Screw you,” Bobby wheezes from behind him, where he’s having to jog slightly to stay within earshot. “You’re the one that remembers me as older than I actually was.”
from her – you’ve strayed. I’ll bet he told you all kind of bull. Some sob story about how he slept on the streets or sold himself to anyone that looked his way. An’ now he’ll tell you that he cares, that he loves you when he ain’t capable of love. All those like him can do is lust”
Dean purses his lips. “I never meant to hide it from him,” he says. “Not really. It just didn’t really happen that often. Me sleeping with men I mean,” he adds at Cas’ confused expression. “I didn’t really even twig that I found men attractive until after Sam left for college and dad gave me some space, and the men I do find attractive are pretty few and far between. I guess I thought’d it all,” he smiles, “come out one day and that’d be the end of it.”
Sam rubbed a hand angrily over his face, trying to dispel his tears. Dean didn’t say anything, but he did pull Sam into a tight, if somewhat awkward, sideways hug, ruffling his hair as he let go. They watched the clouds drift by in silence for a while: wispy white trails dwarfed by the all-consuming blue of the sky.
Sam sighs. “So, I know the reason you never said anything isn’t because you were shy. Why didn’t you tell me?”
Reluctantly, Castiel went. Pastor Walker, Uriel and two men he didn’t recognise sat in chairs ringed around an empty one in the centre. Cas had a feeling to where this was going. He instantly spun round, making for the door. Jim caught him.
Dean makes a small noise in the back of his throat, and looks at Sam for the first time since Alistair ripped his heart out. Sam’s breath catches at the sight of Dean’s eyes – brimming with pain, shame and unshed tears. He can’t help but look away – only for a second.  But, by the time he twists his head back the tears are gone, the eyes dead. Dean takes a faltering step – legs nearly giving out beneath him – clutching the knife tightly.
Sam wavers – he doesn’t want to wake Dean up, but he also knows that the longer he leaves it, the likelihood of them talking will dwindle to nothing. And this talk
“You know what it means,” he said aloud. “It means you’re a faggot. A dirty, disgusting, hell bound pervert.”
“I…” Dean’s eyes flick to the mirror briefly, then to Cas, then away again. “Fuck,” he says again, under his breath, looking down for a second. When he looks back up, his eyes flash. “Fuck it,” he says, louder. “I’m too fucking tired and I’m getting too fucking old to not say this,” he looks at Cas again and doesn’t look away.  “I’ve loved you for a long time. Probably from almost since we met. But I didn’t know till Purgatory.”
“Do you have faith in the Lord?” His father’s voice cut through din, and Cas flinched at the sound of it.
“Or maybe it’s because whenever you show up you only have one thing on your mind,” interjects the man.
“Y’know, I’m actually pretty tired – can you pull over so I can stretch out in the back?” Sam says to Dean. “Cas can swap with me.”
“With everything that’s been happening the past year – all the disasters, all the death... we thought it was your type of thing but we didn’t think…” Cassie trails off – her body beginning to shake with suppressed sobs.
“It’s a good thing you’re doin’, trying to get that boy back where he belongs. With us.” There it was. Of course this would relate back to the church. Everything always did. How good would it make Jim look, Castiel tried to imagine it, if the town “heathen” rejoined the fold.
“That’s what I thought,” Lucifer sighs in mock disappointment. “You know, I’ve been in both your brother and your angel now and it’s just
All too soon, they were pulling into his driveway. His father placed a hand on his shoulder and steered him through the front door.
A force sends Sam flying until his back hits something solid. A rack. Chains spring from nowhere and snake round his body, holding him in place. The rack begins to move him slowly forward until he’s facing Dean – barely more than an arm’s length away. He could reach him if he could only move his arms.
“What’s this got to do with anything?” Sam demands, “I wasn’t even there for most of it. Neither of us was.”
“Like what?” Cas can feel a faint suspicion forming at the edge of his mind, but he ignores it – wanting to hear it from Sam.
“They don’t seem to be able to hear us,” Cas decides to say instead of answering. “I suggest we wait until Dean leaves and try to follow him.”
“It should be easy. Tonight, say to Pastor Novak that you want forgiveness. Just tell him what he wants to hear the most, put all the blame on me, call me a demon if you think he’ll buy it.”
“I could, but I know you didn’t just go through what we just went through to talk about my sex life.”
“I walked mostly, round town. To keep warm y’know? Didn’t realise it got so cold at night here. Then when I got too tired to move anymore I came here, to wait for you.” His eyes met hers for the first time. “Missouri, what are we gonna do?” There was despair in his gaze, yes, but hope too. He wanted her to tell him everything would be ok, that he would see Cas and Sam again. That John would smile at him and look at him; that everything could go back to the way it had been.  It amazed her he could still be so hopeful. It destroyed her that she’d have to dissapoint him.
“You don’t have to do that John, I only did what the Lord expected of me, and I would’ve done it anyway. Mary was such a bright woman...her passing has truly darkened the world.”
“We already know what he saw. We don’t need the play by play.” Dean spat bitterly. And then, because he couldn’t help himself, “unless you’re into that?”
“Now get. Enjoy the sun a while and stop messin’ up my library.” The snappy dismissal signalled a return to normalcy, if such a thing existed for them anymore.  They left her alone, surrounded by her books, her mind immersed in memory.
“I know it might sound wrong, it might even sound hateful. But see, he ain’t really a person anymore. He’s refused every opportunity to return to the Lord. He clearly relishes the dark depravities of hell. An’ that’s where he belongs.”
gay) and she hasn’t been fucked in a long time so it’s two birds with one stone, really. Plus, they can finally get that stick out of Cas’ ass by getting him into her – and maybe some divine intervention (penetration?) will chase out the last of the demon smoke and whoever else she’s been carrying inside herself since she was fifteen. And it’s not like Cas isn’t good looking, and it’s not like she hasn’t noticed a flash or spark or something in his eyes during all those meaningful gazes (and unlike all the other men that’ve been looking at her recently, she doesn’t smell sulphur on Cas’ breath) so it’s not like he won’t enjoy this either. The whisky probably helps in this respect – gives her the certainty she needs to get to her feet.
“Thank you Hael.” She still looked guilt stricken and he cast about for something else to say. “I don’t blame you, any of you.”
“I used the suggestion of you – all I had to work with at the time.” Alistair waves a hand, “but those are just semantics. And, like you said before, ancient history. Over and done with. Let’s see if we can’t breathe some new life into this re-run turned reboot shall we?”
“I gotta say,” he says and his tone is light: conversational. “I’m impressed. Every time you think you’ve seen it all – you humans go and surprise me with the sheer
“Charlie? Where’s my mystery man and wha–” Dean’s voice cut off mid-sentence as he caught sight of Sam.
“I’m fine thanks.” Sam didn’t think he could eat right now if his life depended on it. “Hey, um, do you know if Dean’s in?”
he began to shout  in earnest now, his voice echoing off the walls of eerily quiet church. “Tell me folks: can we let an abomination like this live among us?”
“Weird how?” Sam asks, jumping at the first bit of actually useful information they’ve managed to glean.
Sam’s shoulders slump slightly in defeat. “No, no: of course not. But will you at least tell me why you didn’t just stay the night?”
The baggy suit and trench coat hide a lot, she realises. In it, Cas is an endearing dork, threatening only because she knows what he’s capable of. Underneath the ill-fitting clothes, however, his body is lean and muscled: the body of a soldier. It must have been Cas, she thinks, and not Jimmy that had made the body that way. She thinks back to the power she had sensed under his fingers, and the grace that had shattered windows and mirrors, that had made her ears bleed. He’s so big, so much bigger than she could ever really understand, and it’s evident in the angular plain of his stomach, the long lines of his arms – made hard and strong by the mere pressure of his presence.
“I never even let myself practice this,” Dean admits angrily. “I always kinda thought that, if it all ever came out (which it never would) I wouldn’t have to say anything.”
“Sam told me what Harvey called you. What he called us,” Cas pauses, hand sliding upwards to rest on Dean’s shoulder. “It’s ok if he affected you.”
“Look, we’ve already discovered where he’s buried,” Sam interjects hurriedly, almost as if he expects Dean to be angry that he’s been tricked into driving Cas towards a homophobic ghost. “And as far as we can tell he had no wife or kids or anyone that would hold onto his stuff so that more or less rules out the possibility of him being tied to an object. We get there, we smoke him and then we relax. It’ll be easy.”
Dean screams, and the world begins to shake – throwing Sam and Cas to the ground at the spells’ feet. He doesn’t even glance in their direction – watching the scene in front with hungry eyes, and lips twisted into a smirk. Dean reaches with trembling hands for the axe but doesn’t try to pull it out. Blood spreads under his shirt then wells and starts to drip slowly down his arm. The demon closes his own hand around it but doesn’t pull back. Instead, he drops to a crouch and puts his other hand on Dean’s face, cupping it with a strange gentleness – the action at once tender in its concern and terrible in its dominance. The ground beneath them is trembling and rupturing, but neither of them is affected by the turbulence.
“You? Study?” Sam had reached a hand up to check Dean’s temperature, laughing again at the indignant look on Dean’s face.
Dean laughs but it doesn’t sound much like a laugh. “It’s funny y’know. I’ve spent my whole life trying to be him or trying to please him – even after he was gone, even after I started to understand what he was, he was still at the back of
“You can’t stay here Dean, you have to know that.” She forced herself to meet his horrified stare, she wouldn’t look away.
Noise and light slam into being: the ground beneath them jolting as a hundred pairs of table legs and stools meet the hard, pitted wood of the floor that has just sprung into existence. Walls rise up in a smooth motion, joining with a smoke-stained ceiling that fills the space above them. Sam has to jump to one side as a low hanging lampshade drops down – it’s sickly yellow bulb flickering slightly. On the newly erected walls, windows, posters and dartboards emerge organically from the dirty paint – designs and numbers emerging, then melting into indecipherable smudges. On the windows, stained glass flowers grow and then shrink into diamonds and the fade into nothing before blooming again. Behind the glass, dirty orange streetlights flicker on and off.
They wait as Dean drags himself to his feet, gaping at the destruction around him, before turning to regard the grave he just crawled out of. Then, with a quick glance towards them, he turns and sprints in the opposite direction.
“Hey now, none of that” Dean says firmly, but kindly. Gently, he puts a hand on his own, tiny, shoulder and rubs it comfortingly, waiting for the tears to subside a little. “Look over there,” he points at Sam. “Look at how fu – uh – freaking
John turned to Dean, a hard edge in his voice. “Dean, I don’t want any of your shit tonight, got it?”
Now that Sam can look at Dean without immediately wanting to look away again, he notices other details of time. This Dean is older than the one they just left, but younger than the one they’re looking for. He looks fairly healthy, except for the dark circles under his eyes and a slight pallor to his skin. The sunken, heavy look is back, even under his relaxed smile and easy posture – his shoulders sloping downwards and permanently hunched. Most tellingly, the handprint on his shoulder is still faintly visible – just beginning to edge from pink to white. Both Cassie and the Man touching avoid it, seemingly instinctually.
“We decide what we want to do,” Cas says simply, well aware that it is anything but. “Do we move forward or stay where we are?” He hesitates, then plunges on. “And we also need to talk about Lucifer.”
“Well it looks pretty damn bad,” Missouri informed him, depositing him in a chair and accepting the first aid kit Cas offered. “Thank you, Castiel.”
Dean snorts incredulously, unconcerned. “Hah! I’d like to see you try,” he raises a critical eyebrow.  “Who exactly are you anyway? My pitiful attempt at normalcy and happiness? Some sappy dream of an apple pie future I’ll never have and never could have?” He surges forwards, until they’re practically nose to nose. “You’re weak, and you know it. You couldn’t even make me sneeze, and you know it.”
For the first time in days, he felt calm. The physicality of Dean – the coarseness of his hands in Cas’ hair, the softness of his lips, the wetness of tears on their cheeks – reassured his heart in a way that was beyond the scope of words. He pressed in closer, until he could feel Dean’s heartbeat, in sync with his own. He was
“Holy shit,” Sam swears, unable to stop himself, before immediately wincing at the loudness of his voice – practically echoing and impossible to ignore in the soft quiet. Nobody on the bed – Dean, Cassie or the stranger – reacts to the sound, however: they all seem completely oblivious to the rest of the world.  Dean laughs softly, and turns so he can kiss Cassie gently. The man behind them continues to stroke his hands up and down Dean’s body.
Sam was already in bed, thankfully. Dean made for their room when a rough hand on his shoulder stopped him.
“Who was that girl you were talking to?” Castiel asked as they emerged into daylight. “Your girlfriend?”
The world snaps into place, and then sags slightly: bulging towards the middle. The light takes on a fuzzy, faintly green, hue: making everything look slightly unreal: like a reflection in an oil puddle. The scene begins to populate with strange and disturbing figures: men and women without faces, arms and legs unattached to bodies, fading to nothing at the edges. Near Cas’ shoulder, a man with no head bends towards a pair of floating hands, each of them clutching a beer. The loud, friendly roar of a bar fills their ears – sounds that almost become words rising above the general din before sinking back under, laughs and shouts echoing distantly off the walls. The whole room is slightly hazy and continues to undulate gently, making Sam faintly nauseous.
Rather than the softening he’d been hoping for, Jim’s face contorted with rage. He opened his mouth, but seemed too angry to speak. After a couple deep breaths, he tried again. “Why do you insist on doing this?” he asked. Then, before Cas could reply, he changed tack. “Why did you go to the library yesterday?”
“Hael’s a lovely girl,” He informed his son over dinner that night. “So pretty, and her family’s been with the church for years too. Looks like you’ve got a touch of the ol’ Novak charm in you after all”
“And that was just kissing,” Deans eyes get a faraway look. “Imagine what everything else will be like.”
Dean considers. “I hid it in the dead centre of myself: the part of me where I begin and end,” he says eventually.
Dean Praying: "I didn’t believe you before..when you said we were real. That you and I were real. I couldn’t face that….and the fact that you had to tell me…Listen. I just want you here. I know we’re not gonna fix this over night. That it’s gonna be messed up for awhile, between you and me but..Cas, I haven’t stopped thinking about the look on your face that night. A lot of things have gone wrong in my life, but you aren’t one of them. I didn’t mean to let you go like that. Please, come back to me. So I can tell you I’m sorry to your face.."
He and Cas have only been collecting wood for a short time when they hear Jophiel call out to them. Both set down the branches in their arms and run further into the woods to find Jophiel and Lailah looking down at something. It’s another vampire…a teenage boy. His head having been separated from his body. Lailah tsk tsks at the lax in judgment from whoever left the body in the woods, for humans to find.
"Dean?" Castiel, Dean, and Sam turn their heads towards Dean’s bedroom door. Jack stands there staring right back at them. He looks amazed to see them, to be alive. For a moment he thinks it’s a trick. He looks towards Billie who just closes her eyes. Jack senses she’s irritated….because they broke the rules. For him, for his family...He beams, and looks back to his three fathers. "Sam! It’s me. It’s really me! I’m home."
(considering Sam) the Brawny Man! But you’re wearing the wrong color. He wears a RED plaid shirt, not blue!” Sam hurries to put his gun behind his back.
Castiel balances the pizza box as best he can, on his way to motel door '666.' He's still nervous about his job at Crowley's Pizzeria, not used to the array of customers and their quirks. Just that day, one lady had asked him in for cake and cookies, because he had been delivering pizza for a birthday party. The next customer invited him into her apartment to kill a centipede for her. Lord only knew what lies in wait behind door number three ['666' to be exact.]
Sam decided he didn’t need to know what ‘other stuff’ meant. He doubted Dean would tell him anyway. “You’re still not giving me much,” he griped. “What about Castiel?”
He doesn’t know how long this has been going on when Sam yawns. They both startle – Dean’s eyes jumping from his.
Behind them, Sam’s breathing has evened out and deepened – edging into snores. Dean looks at him fondly in the mirror. “That kid can sleep through anything, I swear.”
He soon finds himself in the kitchen – taking stock of the depressingly empty cupboards. They’re overdue a supply run, he knows, and he’s just low enough on grace that he thinks he might actually be able to enjoy some food – or even a drink. The moment he thinks it, he realises that if
The nothingness has at least solidified into a something – growing gradually around them, sketched in lines of gold. Sam hopes this is a good thing, even if it’s not a something he can exactly understand. There seem to be walls and a floor – curving above and around them, only slightly taller than Sam. It’s kind of like a tunnel he dimly remembers visiting with Jess once at an aquarium. The water had pressed in oppressively on all sides, and he’d been acutely aware of the fragility of glass. Fish and the shadows of sharks had passed over and around them: eyeing them with a bemused amusement at their foolishness, their arrogance, their obvious out-of-placeness. He’d held Jess’ hand tightly in his as they’d shuffled through, too busy searching for cracks to pay much attention to the fish.
ended because I couldn’t do my damn job. So I get what you’re saying and I know it’s true, but I also know it’s not.”
“I should’ve insisted we left, I should’ve guessed He’d do something like that.” Cas’ voice shook. “Instead I let you take all the blame, and now the whole town...” He dropped his gaze to the floor.
“I’ve let this go on long enough.” John’s voice was suspiciously calm. He wasn’t looking at Dean, but at the wall just past his head. “Sam’s at Ruby’s. By the time he gets back I want you gone.”
Then Dean is stumbling, arms grasping air, as the witch’s house slides back into place around them – the witch’s body lying in a pool of blood at their feet.
Something clicked into place and he stared at Hael in disbelief. She had only known him a few hours, why did she want him to take ask her? Why didn’t she just ask him? He didn’t know what to do. He didn’t want to go with her, he knew that much. But if he said so, how would she (or Uriel or his father) react? He didn’t even know why he didn’t want to go with her, she seemed nice enough: it just felt fundamentally wrong. It wasn’t supposed to, he was supposed to be happy, ecstatic even, that a girl wanted to go out with him. What was wrong with him?
“Uriel,” Dean said simply, and when Castiel looked surprised, he clarified. “Not directly. He and some other member of his clique were talking about it, loudly, in math today. I don’t know if they wanted me specifically to hear it or the entire school, but they were loud enough that Sam could probably hear them in his class.”
“Nope, no shop talk right now, not in the bedroom. Besides, you know we’d tell you if any of your kind of crazy popped up here.”
“Leave it Sam,” insists the old (young) Dean. “We’re nearly there.” He starts walking again, and Cas begins to follow. Sam and the other Dean, however, remain in place.
No this will be good for both of them; Cas gets to experience some of the humanity he’s willing to die for, and Dean gets to have someone else inside her for a while.
I had to watch/read a buncha sermons and stuff to try and write the one in this chapter and it made me realise a few things:
“John,” the Pastor chided gently. “We’ve known each other how long and you’re back to calling me Pastor? What’s wrong with Jimmy?”
“I could feel it happening,” Dean is saying. “After I broke, I could feel myself coming apart. It scared me, but staying together was scarier, especially after what I did to you. I needed it.”
“Actually,” Sam cuts in, “you’re the best, uh, ‘person’ to ask about this. You know where it’s hidden, don’t you?”
“Hi Ms. Moseley, how you been?” Dean had always liked librarian, though he rarely saw her. She was practically hermit, rarely leaving the library, except to walk to her small house a few streets down. Her husband worked out of town and tended to stay away for weeks at a time.
“I’d just lost you,” Dean says eventually. “I’d just watched you jump into hell. I was a mess. I was basically just whisky and nightmares, but she took me in any way, and she put salt on her windows and carved devils traps into the floor and she waited until I was enough of a person to love again. Then she loved me. And she let me love her, and Ben.”
– like I was being beat half to death by the fuckin’ devil himself. Thanks for that Sammy. On both counts I mean.”
“I’m sure,” Dean did not bother to hide the sarcasm in his voice. “I haven’t interrupted anything important have I?” His eyes were on Castiel, but it was Hael that spoke yet again.
They turned to face the room. “We aren’t sorry, we aren’t gonna say we’re sorry and we’re sure as hell not gonna repent just to make you happy.” Dean declared. He expected shouting, praying, something.
“What do you mean?” Cas was intrigued now. All the adults in town (and the kids too) seemed to worship his father, it would be refreshing to meet someone who didn’t.
“I think it was my grace – reacting to your presence,” Cas explains. “I didn’t realise you’d also be able to sense it.”
“We haven’t quite figured that bit out yet,” Dean admits, “but we’re gonna and we will – no matter what it takes.”
“It’s good to be back, I can’t say how much I’ve missed this place.” He paused to acknowledge the cheers and beams that swept the hall. “I don’t like leavin’ anymore than you like me bein’ away, but the Lord’s message needs spreading. And I know, that Pastor Walker is more than capable of serving you in my absence, which is more than most places can say.” He paused again, letting them consider his words before he approached the meat of his sermon.
. Dean regards it for a second, before spinning, abruptly towards Cas, an unconvincingly cruel smile plastered haphazardly on his face. “And I bet you’re just loving this
“That’s what I thought about here,” Cas admitted. “I didn’t think about where I was going so long as it wasn’t where I was.”
John stumbled in as Dean was serving up. He looked grumpy and hungover, but his expression lifted somewhat as Dean passed him a plate.
Heading downstairs, the dirt of the last few days scrubbed off, he paused at Sam’s room. He hadn’t been inside since John had found out about him and Cas, what felt like an age ago. Even in here, he was missing: the photos, his camp bed even his birthday cards, all gone. Rage finally broke through numbing cloud that had settled over him. He rummaged through Sam’s desk until he found a pen and paper and began to write:
Cas woke early on Saturday morning, long his father, and dressed as quietly as he could. The library wouldn’t open for hours yet, but if he wasn’t out the house before Jim was up he wouldn’t get a chance to slip away.
“Huh,” Dean thought a few moments. “Why’re you back with him then?” he asked eventually. Castiel looked at him evenly, weighing his options. Eventually, he settled on the truth.
“I’m not sure I understand your definition of fun,” Cas says dubiously, even as he begins to loosen his tie. “I don’t know if this is appropriate.”
Who was this man? Sam had seen his father in many states before. He’d seen him so drunk he couldn’t stand or speak; he’d seen him prostrate with grief unable to do anything but scream. He’d seen John angry more time than he could count: seen him shout and argue and even lash out. But he’d never seen anything like this: never seen John so cold or collected in his rage.  For a second Sam saw only a stranger. But this wasn’t a stranger: this was his family: and he owed to them to try.
Sam laughs at the perplexed look Cas shoots him as Dean rearranges them, though he goes more willingly when he realises his new position lets him put a hand on Dean’s knee. Tactfully, Sam angles his body away from them – focusing on the film. Within a few minutes both are engrossed, though Dean seems to be more interested in watching Cas’ face than the movie itself. They barely react when Sam excuses himself to make some popcorn, and don’t even seem to notice his return – though they’ve used the extra legroom to curl up together.
“Good,” Sam smiles. “It was really good.” He wants to say more, but Dean re-enters before he can – three bottles in hand.
Dean snorts. “You wish: I’m just a discarded habit from an old life. I’m barely scratching the surface.”
The kid was more invested in the church than John was, he took everything to heart. What would he do if he found out...
“Now why would you do that?” A horribly familiar voice creeps in from behind him. “You only just got here.”
“You were very young,” is all Cas can think to offer (dimly wondering how angels have ever thought themselves competent at anything). “And if Dean wanted to hide something from you, then I don’t see how you could have noticed.”
“we can get jobs...” Cas faltered, the gaps in his plan were becoming clearer and clearer. But still, anything was better than staying here.
“Have you been watching a different show?” Dean taunts, “When have we ever cared about what’s possible? You think you’re so powerful but you know what? You’re just some dumb spell, and you’re already losing your grip on me, ain’t ya? Guess I’m just too much to handle.”
He didn’t have a destination as he ran through empty streets. It felt wrong somehow, that the Sun was shining yet no one was outside – he felt like the last person on earth.  Except he could still feel their eyes on him, burning through his coat, his shirt, his skin, right down to his soul – all brimming with hatred.
“Dean that happened how many years ago? And have you ever knowingly hurt me like that since? Or even tried to? As a human at least,” he amends hurriedly. “Demon you doesn’t count.” He scrubs a hand over his face, “Look, I wanted to start with hell because I know it’s what’s tearing you up the most, and I wanted you to know that I’m not angry or disgusted or anything like that. I don’t hate you for being pushed so far you had to hurt me. Do you believe me?”
“I’m sorry it took me so long.” He added a quaver to his voice for dramatic effect. “What do I do now?”
Dean’s face crumples. “I can’t…I can’t do that Sam. I’m sorry.” He closes the distance between them – stopping just an arm’s length away. Some of the chains binding Sam dissolve into smoke – and he desperately brings his arm up to grasp Dean’s wrist – keeping the blade at bay.
Castiel thought about it. “I guess not,” he said slowly. “But I haven’t really been a Preacher’s son very long.”
Missouri cut him off with a wave of her hand. “Please, who else could you be?” She smiled kindly at him. “Don’t worry, I don’t hold it against you, I prefer the quiet anyway. Now, I suppose you boys are needin’ books for Sam? He ain’t been here in a while so I know he’s finished the last lot.”
He finds them under their backup backup phone and a pile of yellow newspaper clippings from an old case a he doesn’t even remember. The box is battered, torn and faded, half empty and with some of the cigarettes broken or partially smoked.
“Castiel, sit down. Now” There was nothing else he could do, so he obeyed. “Okay good. Now, you boys know what Uriel saw. We want to hear your side.”
“Jim!” Gordon Walker forced himself between father and son. “I think you should go sit on the couch. The situation is obviously too personal for you right now. I’ll handle it. Novak was breathing heavily as he crossed the room, glaring at Dean the entire time.
“God, I’ve been such a selfish idiot. I didn’t listen to what you or Cas or even Missouri was trying to tell me because it wasn’t what I wanted to hear.”
In his fantasies, they’d been too shocked to do anything. All they could do was stare as he pulled Dean to his feet and out the classroom. He’d pictured the outrage on their faces, imagined it would be the last time he ever had to look at their faces. In his fantasy, it was always sunset, there was always a bus waiting. They could always ride off into the sunset together.
Dean felt John’s hand clamp round his arm, keeping him in his seat. Not that he could’ve moved anyway, pinned by the now heaving crowd on either side of him. He tried to pull away nevertheless, but John only tightened his grip. “You had your chance boy,” he hissed at Dean, voice thick with malice. “Time for you to get what you’re due.”
Dean’s head is turned away from them and from Lucifer, staring resolutely to the side. They can see a muscle tensing in his jaw, and his hands are clenched into fists on the ground beside them. But otherwise, he makes no move nor noise.
Castiel calmly walks up to the vampire with a machete in his right hand. Since working with hunters Sam and Dean Winchester over the years, Cas had found himself experimenting, trying new weapons, switching out his angel blade for the store of weapons Dean and Sam had kept in the back of the truck he was up until recently “borrowing.” Before he had abandoned the truck to join up with the few angels who still trusted him, who still considered him as a friend, Castiel had taken his pick of weapons and stored them in Aglibol’s jeep.
Dean Praying: "Cas, I’m begging you. If I could just see you one last time..." Castiel starts to panic.
Sam somehow manages to get up, and goes to Jack. He tries comforting him, but Jack backs away and looks up at Sam, guiltily. Sam knows how much Jack and Castiel meant to one-another and he attempts to comfort Jack, who is shaking his head, disbelieving.
"Oh Baby Boy! Oh fuck. What a mouth. What a whore mouth. You like that, don't you? You like it when Daddy shoves his dick down your throat? Dirty whore...Nasty...So fucking hot!!" After what seems like too short a time, Dean releases Castiel and pulls his dick out. It leaves Cas's lips with a wet pop and Castiel's face is a mess. His hair is mussed and his neck is covered in sweat and lubricant and pre-cum drip off of his chin. He gasps for air, taking a deep breath. When he opens his eyes he sees Dean masturbating, his cock aimed at Castiel's face. His body seems to glow and his eyes are glassy. His voice is gravely when he talks down to Castiel.
"Why not? Why the hell not?! How are we protecting everyone by hiding the truth from them? I’m tired of it. Let them find the bodies! They should!" The other three are shocked at Castiel’s outburst. Aglibol tries to support Jophiel and takes a tentative step towards Castiel, holding his hands up in defense.
“The DECORATIONS. Halloween stuff in your yard. We thought the sign was fake, like the bodies up there.” He points to the railing. Dean, Sam, and Cas follow the kids up the stairs to see what they’re talking about.
Dean reaches Castiel, to see Cas covered in what looks like black ink, and blood. But worse…an imprint of his torn and frayed angel wings, covering the walls of the bunker. Later, Dean would forbid Sam or Jack from ever removing them. Dean sobs and takes Castiel’s now dead body…hugging Cas close to him. In desperation, Dean starts to pray: "I’m not letting go this time. They’ll burn our bodies together. I’m not letting go. I’m not leaving you.."
"Look, I just…don’t understand why you were so chill, a moment ago. Alright? You seem…careless lately. Like you wouldn’t even care if we died…I thought we were your friends." Castiel’s light dims. His eyes go back to normal and he blinks as if trying to remember where he is. Aglibol takes a tentative step towards Cas.
"Dean!! Dean I’m here. Please look at me!" Dean blinks his eyes open and looks up to see Castiel, who has crawled onto the bed and is cradling Dean’s face. Then, coming to his senses, Cas raises a hand over Dean’s forehead. There is a soft glow of light, and a gentle hum. Dean breathes in deeply. Immediately, the sweat droplets disappear and Dean stops shaking. Sam lets out a heavy sigh of relief.
Dean hasn’t encountered one car, since he left Bobby, back at the road house. No tiredness, not even a cramp in his leg, or strain in his neck and shoulders. The impala seems to purr, as he glances out the window at the stretches of field and lush green, that whir past. Letting out a deep breath, he slows down and pulls over to the side of the road. Not worried about anything happening to the car, Dean steps out and decides to just go for a walk.
Dean Praying: "I haven’t eaten in a few days. I’m not feeling too hot, right now..If you don’t want to see me again, I understand. But I had to try. If you don’t want to communicate with me at all, you and Sam could still.."
"Change of plans. Dean’s time isn’t up yet. Sorry. You’ll just have to collect on him another time." Even in the face of death, Sam is grinning from ear to ear. Billie shakes her head, almost sorry for what’s about to happen next.
He goes to the front of the car and sees that Castiel is crying again. His face is expressionless, and his breathing appears as if steady, but there are tears streaming down his face. Aglibol sighs miserably, knowing that Castiel's outburst had something to do with Dean Winchester. He climbs up onto the hood and lies next to Castiel, who doesn’t even acknowledge him. Aglibol wondered why he even bothered. Castiel’s heart would never be his, not with Dean still out there… He lays down looking up at his moon.
Castiel is on the other side of the bunker door, his hand raised as if to open it when he hears Dean’s prayer and stops. He can’t remember the last time Dean tried to reach him this way. Not with a text, not through his brother..'He’s praying to me.' Castiel waits a moment, listening.
He reaches under the table, un-latches one of the spare guns, and moves towards the stairs. Castiel wields his angel blade and Dean slips his demon knife out of his sleeve, like Cas taught him to. The three move up the stairs quickly. They brace themselves, look at each other knowingly and Dean opens the door.
"It’s good to have you back, kid. This is….this is incredible. Billie thank you." But when Dean turns around, she’s gone. All who’s left is Castiel sitting on the bed. Cas..
Jack just stands there, miserable, hopeless. Understanding the situation completely…The Shadow. Castiel’s moment of happiness....He starts crying.
"Oh fuck! You little bitch. You prostitute." Castiel purrs at the compliment and releases his hands from Dean's hips. He stops bobbing his head forward and back on Dean's cock, but still keeps his mouth open, giving Dean full control. Dean bends his knees slightly, while grabbing Cas's head with both his hands. Dean fucks Castiel's mouth, hard and fast. Castiel closes his eyes and relaxes his jaw, his arms slack...he's never felt so needed, before. Dean increases his speed and yells out dirty talk to Cas.
"Nevermind. You answered my question. When you get to your next Daddy's house..." Castiel's face turns red, as Dean continues..."Give him his pizza, take his money, and then go to your knees in front of him and open your mouth. If he doesn't drag you inside his place, crawl in and beg him for his milk. Tell him you need it. You want to taste your Daddy. Then, stick out your tongue." Castiel and Dean stare at each other for a moment, and then Castiel smiles in gratitude.
Afterwards, Castiel and Dean lie naked together, in bed. Castiel is explaining the new design and his additions to the barn, and Dean listens as he looks up at the stars. When Castiel finishes describing the hot spring out back, Dean wraps Castiel in his arms and pulls him close. For awhile, they both look lovingly at each other. Dean kisses Castiel once more, before saying…
The kids turn to look at him. They are half way up the stairs to the street level, so Sam has to step outside.
Castiel is hypnotized by Dean’s presence, and just watches his approach, stunned. Both Dean's soul and Castiel’s swell and fill the barn with warmth and comfort and love. Neither Dean nor Castiel notice the barn doors closing, the opening in the barn ceiling expanding, filling the barn with starlight.
"NO! CASTIEL!!!..." Jack tries opening the door. When it doesn’t move for him, he stands back and raises his hand towards it, bracing himself. Dean is screaming Castiel’s name over and over again, as Sam tries to pull him away from the door. When it’s finally cleared, Jack blasts it open.
Castiel lays down on a bed set up in the barn that he recently built, with Jack’s permission. His legs tangled in the sheets, pajama bottoms hanging off of his hips and a top buttoned lazily and messily. Hair mussed and eyes glazed over, Castiel looks up through the broken pieces of the barn’s ceiling, and catches a shooting star pass overhead.
“What are you thinking, right now?” Castiel’s eyes shine bright. Dean’s never seen Cas this happy before, in all the time they’ve known each other.
"Be able to keep their children safe. They would know what’s out there and have a chance at….at seeing their children grow up. They could save themselves from the torture that comes with outliving their own offspring, and then maybe he wouldn’t have had to…He wouldn’t…" Castiel doesn't want to believe what he just saw, or what he thinks he just saw. To himself: 'Dean. You would never…you would have tried to find his maker. Or you would have helped him learn to steal hospital blood, like Benny…it wasn’t you. It couldn’t have been you..He was too young, you wouldn't....' Castiel starts shaking. He refuses to cry in front of his friends, again. Tears well up in his eyes, but Castiel tries taking deep breaths, to calm himself, keeping them from falling. He doesn't understand any of this. It doesn't make sense. His throat catching, he just stands there, seething… 'Dean, how could you?..'
"What about the body? We can’t just leave it here." Then without waiting for a response, Lailah sets off to another area of the woods. "I’m going to go get some fire wood. We can burn him quick and then head out to ‘Hidden Shack’, only a few miles from here, off the back roads. Supposed to be super-rustic, even for a monster-made bar, but Angels drink free, tonight. C’mon Jophi." Jophiel starts to follow, but not before swiping up Castiel’s machete, still on the ground. Just in case. Aglibol sighs and motions for Castiel to follow.
Now, he seemed almost dead-like, unresponsive, uncaring. It was unnerving. It reminded the Angel Trio of the days when Castiel had been brainwashed to kill without question, without feeling. Without caring about those who got in his way. Aglibol removes his hand from Castiel’s shoulder and suggests they all head back to the jeep, now that the vampire they had been seeking had been dealt with. Both Lailah and Jophiel protest.
“Forgive me for doubting either of you, but you both seemed surprised by my appearance when I entered, just now. Like you weren’t expecting me. Is it even working the way it should? How was I able to enter the bunker without either of you being alerted? I’m not as powerful as I used to be, but wouldn’t an angel raise some sort of alarm?”
The vampire still refuses to die, despite Lailah’s attempts. It starts to wrestle against Jophiel and Aglibol. Lailah backs away slightly, holding out his angel blade helplessly. He cries out, begging Castiel to hurry up and finish the vamp off.
"Forgive me. You’re right. I’m not..not as aggressive as I used to be, when in combat….I just..." Castiel looks ashamed of himself, broken and sad. Jophiel feels guilty. He, Aglibol, and Lailah have tried numerous times to get Castiel to open up to them about how they found him trying to take his own life, only a week ago. Since then the four angels had been working cases together…..whenever they weren’t hiding in abandoned buildings, or slinking into the back booths of bars along the highway. Up until a few days ago, Cas had been a life saver, of sorts. Four angels working together was definitely better than three.
Castiel runs inside, and straight to Dean’s bed. Dean is clutching at the bedsheets, and has broken into a cold sweat. His teeth are chattering, and his eyes are squeezed shut. He's crying out for Castiel, not realizing he's entered Dean's bedroom.
Dean furrows his brows and then it’s his turn to look exasperated. He faces Castiel, waiting for it…
“Yeah, whatever. So, are you alright?” (There’s genuine concern in his voice now). He and Sam sit down again, figuring there was nothing that they could really do for Cas when he was beat down, like this. His vessel would re-charge and clean itself off, overnight. “You’re a mess.”
“Seriously, Dean. NO!” Sam has his feet propped up on the map table. Dean has a Red Hood mask on, and a pillow case in his hand (and a knife up his sleeve, and a gun in his left pant leg, just in case).
“That’s different. Your face is scanned into the system, or some crap like that. You can exit and enter whenever you want, like Sam and Me.” Sam tries clearing his throat. Castiel turns to look at
The smile fades from Castiel’s face. The tears falling down his cheeks gleam like silver, with the light of the moon. Dean takes Cas by the shoulders and turns back towards the bunker, keeping an arm around Cas as they descend the stairs to the front door. Castiel sighs heavily and leans against Dean, for support. Dean kisses his temple.
“I’m sorry Dean.” Cas forced himself to turn away, to walk towards Uriel’s cluster of desks. He focussed on their plan. It was Tuesday, he had to get through four days before he could see Dean.
“Dad,” he began, mouth dry.  His father ignored him, turning off the radio, letting the crushing silence rush between them.
my son,” John shook him off angrily. “And he weren’t Mary’s son neither. You think she’d be proud of what her boy’s become: a degenerate? She’s probably cryin’ right now over you and how far down the path of damnation – the path
Through the window, Cas can see the silhouettes of two figures, a car, and a cemetery. He recognises it at once, of course. How could he not? As the scene brightens, he picks out details he already knew were coming: the scorched ground where Michael had stood, the bloodstained grass, the cracked windshield, Bobby’s corpse in the grass with his neck twisted at a gruesomely impossible angle: cap and gun on the ground next to him. Some of the blood and viscera splattering the scene (including Dean), he realises with an unpleasant lurch to his stomach, is him. Never more aware of his own materiality than in this moment, he shifts his feet – reminding himself that he is still solid, still here, and not there on the grass, intermingling with Dean’s sorrow and pain. Not literally, at least.
“This is all my fault.” He whispered, more to himself than Missouri. “If I was normal, if I’d been able to pretend, none of this would’ve happened. Not to me, not to Cas.”
a liar when all I’ve done is love. You don’t know what love is: all you can do is hate. So you can scream and shout at me all you want. You can call me a liar or a snake or the goddam devil himself and it won’t change a damn thing. I
“The minute I realised that it was like this…you say that I’m your mountains? Well Dad was my sky and it was like the storm clouds he left over me just burst. I went out into the garden and just cried.” He’s crying again, Sam sees, the tear tracks glistening on his cheeks. “I couldn’t stop,” he tilts his head back and the tears collect in the wrinkles round his eyes (and had they always been so deep?). “Ever since then, it’s been harder to deal with…with dad.” They lapse back into silence, each digesting. The cigarette in Sam’s hand has gone out. He offers it to Dean, who shakes his head.
“Thanks for leaving the warding up on the walls. You didn’t even fix what I got wrong, the first time.”
"Uh, sure thing Cassie. After we burn the bodies, we’ll all….Hey!!!…." Castiel has already turned to head back to the jeep parked by the side of the road. The others run to catch up with him. Jophiel can't help but feel frustrated again. He tries reasoning with Cas.
They both look up and smile sadly, watching Sam chase the kid with the zombie head clutched in his hand. The kids think that Sam is just joking around with them, and are laughing with glee. A couple of adults standing next to the impala parked outside (the children’s parents) laugh too, and take out their phones to film their kids and the Brawny man. One looks at his watch and calls out to his son..
“Can’t we?”  The hypocrisy of it was too much – he felt the anger rising again.  It was followed immediately by panic as he watched his father.
Instead, she rounded the table and took the space next to him, pushing against him in a too familiar manner. “Of course I’ll go with you Castiel,” she beamed at him.
“Sorry.” More carefully this time, Sam reaches in the dark until he feels the edge of Cas’ trench coat, shuffling so that they’re standing side by side.
Alistair shrugs, seemingly disappointed but not surprised. “It was worth a shot,” he says. “But alas, even when you’re this corrupted you fear me too much. Proof of a job well done, I suppose. Perhaps too well done?” Neither of him says anything, and Alistair smiles widely. “Well, if I’m too, ah, extreme for your taste, may I suggest the next best thing? I can’t guarantee you the same results, of course, but I’m sure you’ll have more than enough to work with.”
In the pool of the impala’s headlights, they watch Cas shift onto his knees, groaning as he does so and clutching his arms tightly around himself. He wavers for a second, before pitching forward until his forehead is resting on the hard concrete. “Dean,” he mutters, and the voice, though clearly deep in pain, is the appropriate gravel.
“I was like you Dean.” She said, her voice still shaky. “I wouldn’t leave: my momma was sick, I needed to look after her. I had it easier ‘cos no one had found out about us, I thought we could pretend, that we could stay forever. She was smarter than me: she left.”
” Jim hurled the last word at him like a stone; Castiel flinched under its weight. “After everything I’ve done and said, after I extended my forgiveness and took you back: after I gave you a chance at redemption, this is how you repay me? This is how you repay your loving father?”
“What makes you think he wants to come back?” Lucifer taunts, still edging closer and closer, agonisingly slowly. Dean, his back already at the car, can do nothing but watch and wait. “What’s he got out here that I can’t give him in there? You?” Lucifer laughs. “Get real. My brother may be a piss poor excuse for an angel, but he’s still a divine creation – straight from God himself and as old as the universe. And what are you?” He stops inches from Dean’s face, bringing his hand up to pat Dean’s cheek, so gently it’s a mockery. Dean still flinches involuntarily, jerking his head in the opposite direction. “Some alcoholic, insignificant ant with a tacky, old car and tired, old daddy issues. You really think my brother could love that?” Lucifer waits for Dean's shoulders to slump in dejection before delivering his next blow. "Oh so you don't know either?" he asks, and then laughs at Dean's sharp intake of breath. "Oh, he loves you alright, this brother of mine. The fool. Not that it matters. He didn't love you enough to stay, did he? Still said 'yes', didn't he? Just like Sam did last time? Interesting pattern isn't it: how everyone you love leaves you for me?"
“You don’t…it’s me that should be apologising. I should’ve been more careful, I shouldn’t have assumed that…”his voice catches “…that you would want what I want.”
time, longer than you probably think, and being a part of this ‘community’ isn’t gonna solve it for me,” he takes a deep breath and forces himself to go on. “All I need – all I’ve ever needed – is my family: is you. I know you’re trying, and I’m sorry I can’t be grateful, but I need you to not try anymore ok? I just need to you to be normal about this, Sammy. Please?”
Uriel guided him into a nearby classroom, talking all the while. “...really is the best school in the district,” he was saying pompously and Castiel nodded as if he’d been listening the whole time. He found Uriel hard to listen to, the boy talked in an eerily similar manner to his father, Pastor Walker, and it was hard to take a seventeen year old who talked like a middle aged preacher seriously.
“He’ll says he’ll be two minutes; he’s gonna bring you pancakes.” She brought the coffee pot over. “What’s your name stranger?”
“Y’know, I think this might be good for me," Dean bats Cas’ arm away easily, barely seeming to pay any attention to either of them. He’s grinning manically; teeth bared all the way to the edge, movements light and carefree. “Give me the character resolution I never quite got in real life. Think of what I’ll become if I actually free myself of you this time. I’m the only me that’s worth a damn because I’m the only me that’s ever really seen how much you two hold me back.”
And of course, Castiel already knew what Jim wanted him to say. He tried not to pay attention to the actual words coming out of his mouth. Dean was his friend, his lover. Even though he knew why he had to say it, it still felt like betrayal. Instead, he focused on his father. He watched his father’s face break into his smile – the real one– as his eyes filled with tears of joy.
“You don’t look good son,” Jim hated being sick, he wouldn’t want to get too close. “I’ll call Simon; see if he can’t squeeze you in between patients.”
“Hey!” his shout was loud enough to draw the attention of others on the street. When they saw who had uttered it, however, they turned away.
Eventually they pulled back, Cas wanted to look at Dean’s face. His features had hardened, sharpened, in their years apart but Cas could still see the softness that was Dean’s true self: a self only Cas had ever seen. It was in the glow of his eyes, the blush of his cheeks, the softness of his lips. This was a Dean that, through necessity and choice, was long hidden from the world, but he was still there, for Castiel. Waiting.
“Scared that it will be too much. Scared that it won’t be enough,” he takes a deep breath. “Scared that I won’t know it’s you – that I’ll think it’s
There was so little left of that month for Dean. More and more faded every time. He’d tried to write things down, to make them permanent, but it wasn’t the same. He’d never be able to create words that accurately described Sam’s laugh or the taste of Cas’ lips. Nothing could capture the feeling, the freedom, the happiness of that time.
“Yeah, I guess we are. Sort of,” Dean takes another cigarette from the box.  Sam leans over, the lighter in his hand. “Thanks,” Dean tilts his head downwards towards the flame. “You gonna smoke yours or just hold it?”
“Good luck son, just,” Bobby pauses, “just try not to too lost in there: it happened, it ain’t happening.”
So it was that a heavy silence still hung over the Winchester household when Sunday morning dawned. John ferried Dean and Sam into the car with a grim look, Sam in the front seat; Dean exiled permanently to the back.
“See you soon, Sammy,” he winks. “Real soon,” and then he, along with everything else, vanishes into the chaos. Sam forces himself to turn and join Cas in the darkness.
As we watches their silent conversation, he fights to keep back tears of his own, Dean’s words from the motel still running through his mind. Is this one of those ‘in-betweens’ Dean had dreamed of? As much as the earlier revelations into Dean’s sexuality had surprised him, he (not to mention the rest of the goddamn world both supernatural and otherwise) isn’t exactly blind. That Dean’s feelings aren’t a notable exception to a lifelong pattern; that there might be more than simple sexual repression that’s kept him from acting all these years; that he and Cas have been restrained by a shared fear that links them even as it drives them apart, and that Cas may have irrevocably broken what’s between them without even knowing it, elevates the entire situation from a farce to something more tragic than Sam could ever have possibly imagined. Fiercely (futilely) he prays to a god he knows isn’t listening (and probably never cared much to begin with) that the real Dean will somehow buck a forty year trend and actually talk about this when they get back to the real world.
But at long last, it seemed, the universe had grown bored of tormenting Dean and moved onto fresher, more arrogant, targets.
“I told you not to call me that,” Sam shouted, voice echoing around the empty road. “Only my brother gets to call me Sammy, and you aren’t my brother.”
“You’d never be happy again. You’d have to live a lie forever and you’d never be from suspicion.” Missouri met Dean’s defiant glare levelly.  “Are you ready for that Dean? Are you ready to ignore every fibre of yourself: to suppress every urge, every thought? Are you ready to find some bloodless girl who’ll ignore or overlook what they whisper about you? Are you ready for years of loveless marriage, never truly able to connect with anyone meaningful again? Are you ready to abandon Cas? Are you ready to abandon life?” Her voice was heavy with pain and anger, her eyes clouded with tears.
“Dad, are you ok?” Sam’s nervous voice forced him back to the present, and he followed it to the kitchen, leaning against the doorframe. John was by the fridge, beer in his hand, his face still unreadable.
“Not yet at least,” says the spell lightly – Cas glares at him and he raises his hands placatingly. “Not a threat – just a comment on the gradual nature of liver disease.”
But John refuses to relent, and instead of stepping he steps forward, forcing Dean into an even more precarious position than before: his legs squashed awkwardly against the lounger. Sam, with a look of pure rage eerily similar to his father’s, springs out of the pool and tries to pry John’s hand off. His fingers pass straight through, however, and neither John nor Dean appears to notice his efforts. He shoots Cas a worried look which Cas returns with one of his own. They’d been able to touch Dean in his other memories – the non-wet swimming pool is abruptly a bigger problem.
“Eh, who knows?” Dean shrugs. “Probably go drag Dad out from the bottom of whatever bottle he’s drownin’ in, then let myself get fucked stupid by some bartender,” He lies back against the hood of the impala, putting another cigarette back into his mouth, lighting it with shaking hands. “Or maybe I just wait here a while.”
were wrong. Because I couldn’t bear another 10 years without my brother – and neither can you. You’re just too stubborn and weak to admit it.” He turned to leave.
eek sorry this took a while! Life keeps getting in the way! We're so near the end now so thank you all so much for sticking with me! Love ya.
“Dean, so help me god if you don’t get in your own room right now, I will lock you in there myself.”  To emphasise his point, he pulled Dean away from Sam’s door across the landing. The look in Dean’s eyes was one of utter betrayal but John refused to be moved by it. Dean had denied his problem, he would have to face the consequences.
He opened the front door as quietly as he could, listening for the sound of his father’s (fakest) real laughter. The house was eerily silent however. Maybe they were praying. He made his way towards the stairs when a voice called out behind him.
“Are those my only choices then?” He asks acidly. “The repressed, deluded brother you gotta drag out the closet? Or the happy, campy ‘out and proud’ brother who kisses his boyfriend in the middle of the street while you cheer from the sidelines? You really think that’ll go any better for me? We still drink in those ‘crappy’ bars, Sam. We still hunt with those ‘shitty’ people. How can you say it’s a different world when yesterday we burnt a piece of it that hated me so much he came back from the fuckin’ dead? You want me to be ‘ok’ with that?” He sighs at the look on Sam’s face, his anger deflating and leaving him vaguely guilty. “Look, you’re probably right: I’m not good when it comes to emotions and shit, and I probably do have some messed up crap in my head. But none of that is new: I’ve been dealing with this a
She was giving him an out, Dean saw with a swell of affection. A chance to escape back to Cas and pretend this had never happened without losing face. He was tempted, almost, to take it. If not for the look in Sam’s eyes. “I want to do this, Missouri,” he assured her, though he was looking at Sam when he said it. “Trust me I know it’s stupid and believe me I’m shit scared right now,” he laughed hollowly, “but Sammy’s right. I have to at least try. I got Sammy back, I got Cas back - how could I live with myself if I didn’t try to get Joh…Dad back too.”
Sam met the eyes of one customer, a bearded man about Dean’s age, and looked away quickly when the man winked. “Well do they have to be so open?”
eyes) flash a strange green for a second. He sees it. He feels it. He sees it and he feels it. “And give you even more sentience than you have now? I don’t think so.”
As they walked up to the front door, he saw that the garden was more run down than would normally be allowed, the lawn was overgrown, and weeds were creeping up through the flower beds. The front porch needed a fresh coat of paint as well. Such things would normally warrant a concerned visit from the neighbours in a town like this, he supposed having a dead wife allowed some leeway.
Cas’ only answer was to hand him the postcard. Dean read it in the flickering orange of the street light that shone through his small window.
“So let’s go to Hawaii or somethin’,” Dean snaps.  “Let’s not drive across the country for six hours just to watch a bunch of twinks in shorts and glitter twerk to Katy Perry.”
The Pastor was taking his sweet time, letting the excitement and anticipation build. When he did eventually emerge, Dean expected to hear cheers and claps, as if he were a rock star and not some small town priest. Instead, an expectant silence swept in waves through the crowd. By the time Jim reached his podium, the hall was silent. Waiting.
“There were people on the street the whole time,” Dean’s voice was shaking. “Uriel said they didn’t care what happened to me.”
Her head disappeared then reappeared once more. “Are you handsome?” she asked, eying him with indifference.
“Yeah? If you could only see your faces right now. The way you’re looking at me? Like you can’t decide whether I’m a kicked puppy or some piece a shit on your shoe. You think I wanna come back to that?”
Absently, Dean wonders how many times Sam’s practiced that speech, and how long he’s been keeping it up his sleeve: waiting for the perfect opportunity to unleash his emotions. Maybe he asked Jodie or Cas or even Charlie to help him write it. He thinks about the kid in the queue, how they probably would’ve killed to hear a speech like that from their brother. He’s lucky, he supposes, that Sam is bending over backwards to accept him. But try as he might, he can’t bring himself to be anything but mildly pissed off at the whole situation.
As if on cue, sound comes rushing in, and the room is filled with heavy breathing and groans that are impossible to mistake or ignore. Underneath it all, music is playing softly – too softly to make out any words underneath everything else that’s going on.
“Dean you know that’s not true,” Cas said firmly, taking Dean’s hand. “They’re the ones that’re wrong, remember?”
Castiel was shaking with rage. The reaction had surprised him. He had been steeling himself for guilt, for shame, not anger. After all, he’d been thinking more or less the same way since Thursday. But there was something about hearing his own thoughts spewed from his father’s mouth that weakened them.
Castiel had watched the taillights of the car in front. Dean was in there. Was it like this for him? He hoped so. He didn’t want to hear what his father would say. He didn’t want to hear what anyone would say.
This, he’d realised, was the moment it had all gone wrong.  If he’d been nicer to Hael, if Cas hadn’t been provoked into his outburst. Maybe nothing would have happened. Or maybe it would’ve. Back then he’d been naive enough to think they could’ve hidden forever, now he knew better. Sooner or later the truth always came out.
He wandered through empty streets, killing time. He was noticing more and more how monotonous his town was. Everything looked the same. Squat, ugly houses sat behind bland, square lawns bordered by neat, wilting flowers. Even the people, the few that were out early, seemed to blend together. Only the street signs assured him that he wasn’t walking in circles.
“Yeah, well that was recent. She’s never gone, far as I know. And she fights with everyone. A lot. But your Dad especially” Admiration coloured Dean’s voice.
Sound next: no screams (for now) just the vague, distant, rusty groaning of chains, vaguely malevolent crunches and splashes as he walks over piles and puddles of things he can’t yet see. Same as always.
“It wasn’t any one thing,” Sam told him. “Part of it was you: no matter what Dad or anyone else told me, and no matter what
“No. No,” Dean tries to shake his head. “You can’t be here. You’re not supposed to be here. You’re supposed to be safe, not here.”
Castiel must have sensed what was going on under the surface, for he reached out and placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Unconsciously, Dean put his own hand on top of it, drawing comfort from the contact.
“So how you gonna save my poor soul?” he asked in mock desperation, dropping to his knees dramatically in the grass in front of Cas.
One day, he was sure, he’d wake up and remember nothing at all. He’d be left with only the memories of the memories. But until that day, he’d treasure every single second.
Dean,” the Dean shaped figure counters, shrugging. “And isn’t everything here technically Dean? We’re in my head after all: it’s Dean all the way down.” He sighs at the stony looks on their faces. “Ok, ok, so I’m not the Dean you’re looking for: I’m just some kind of cerebral echo/ semi-sentient sentience tour guide. But: your Dean
“Isn’t it?” Dean asked. “I’m the outcast, the weird one. I know what everyone says about me. I don’t know why she said yes in the first place.” His voice cracked, and something in Cas broke. He wanted to scream at the school, at the town, at the world, for doing this to Dean. He wanted to protect him from them, to save him.
“Everyone’s friends round here.” Jim replied wryly. He thought for a moment. “John Winchester’s a good man; he’s always done right by the church. Last year his wife, Mary, died, and he had a hard time dealing with it. They were sweethearts since the 6th grade practically, meant to be. He didn’t know how to function without her. Still doesn’t.”
…until she feels something give way inside and gentle waves of pleasure begin to roll through her, and she presses her face into the place where Cas’ neck meets his shoulder, legs twitching, breath stuttering. It’s muscle memory and instinct that keeps her hand moving, and it’s only a few seconds later that she feels Cas shuddering – his movements an echo of her own.
He’d told Cas about it the next day at school. Sometimes, that was what he missed the most, having someone he could talk to about everything.
“No way,” Dean had said, too quickly. “She’s super pissed at me,” he’d added hastily. “No, I’ll go to Castiel’s. We’re gonna, um, study.”
“He always opposed the parade,” Cas adds from the back seat, “but while alive he couldn’t do anything to stop it. This year, however, the run-up to the parade’s been plagued with disaster: the stage has collapsed 3 times already and a night guard was attacked. There are six people in the hospital; all claiming to have seen an angry old man shouting at them.”
A door appears in the wall in front of them, revealing a dimly lit hallway. As they follow Dean out Cassie, and the bedroom, begin to disintegrate. The walls go first, then the furniture and finally Cassie – who watches Dean all the while – her face resigned yet also slightly accusatory. Dean keeps his head forward as they move through the hallway, past smudged pictures of Cassie, Jonah, and faceless friends and family decorating the wall and down the stairs. Jonah himself stands in the hallway, a pack of cigarettes and a lighter clutched in his hand.
Sam opens his mouth to swear, but Dean has already vanished, leaving them alone in the black nothingness.
or Alistair or anyone else that ever only used to me to get off. Scared that I can’t tell the difference between being used and being loved. Scared that even if I can, I won’t care – that I’m so fucked up I need to be used.” As he talks, his hand flickers in an aborted motion towards his mouth – towards the scar – before coming back to grasp Cas’ wrist.
Dean sits back down beside her, taking her hands in his. “Cassie,” he says softly, “listen to me. Me n’Sam – we’re gonna stop it. It’s gonna be ok.”
“Thank you,” he replied stiffly. Uriel was watching him expectantly, wanting something more explicit.
“Yes I fucking know what I have to do,” Dean glares at Alistair.  “Yes, I’ll fucking do it. Just let me down.”
“...just go. It’s only for a night: no big deal.” Sam’s room now. This wasn’t about the library – that’d been a no go – this was a few days (maybe a week?) later.
To Dean’s surprise and horror, Castiel immediately swung away, back into the church. If he’d been a little slower, he would have seen the smile on Dean’s face, the lack of hatred in his eyes, and known everything was okay. As it was, he’d been so sure Dean would despise him that he hadn’t stopped to take in the expression on his best friend’s face.
Dean shrugs. “Don’t really remember. Probably picked it up from some kid at some school that I was trying to impress.”
“How do I escape?” he asked hopelessly, both to Dean and the world at large. It was Dean who answered.
“Except for that last one,” Dean counters. “That wasn’t even a memory. Not really. More a…compilation. Or a representation?”
Even a blind man, Cas thinks, would be able to see how angry John is now. He’s radiating a cold fury that would make even an archangel take a step back, yet Dean stands his ground, meeting John’s eyes with a steely determination of his own.
They don’t have to search long: pushing through the half-forgotten crowd (automatically murmuring apologies as they go) they find him slumped against an empty pool table, cue in hand: a goofy smile plastered over his face, a few beer stains darkening the fabric of his shirt. “Sssam, Cas,” he slurs happily, “S’good to see ya.” His gaze slips to behind them (where the other Dean has reappeared, a smug smile on its face) and manages (with some difficulty) to sharpen into a pointed glare. “Shame ‘bout the company.”
His other weapons useless, Dean fell back to sarcasm. “Wow fellas, those are big words for jocks. Did Uriel have to write them down for you?” That wiped the smiles of their faces, and he allowed himself a moment of satisfaction at the sight.
“No Dean, I wouldn’t,” says memory Sam, at the same time as he swings his fist into Dean’s face. The words continue to echo as he punches Dean again and again and again and again and again and again and again...
“I don’t want to leave you alone.” The words had rushed out of Sam’s mouth, practically against his will. It had taken Dean a few seconds to work out what’d he’d said. Then, the guilt had come crashing over him.
“Nope! Nope! New plan: we’re gonna watch the Last Jedi, we’re gonna cry at its utter brilliance, then we’re gonna go to that guy’s house and you’re gonna smite him. C’mon.”
Dean finishes his cigarette, makes to flick the butt into the lake then reconsiders – placing it back in the box instead. “I’m trying to: I really am but…all I ever wanted to do was keep you safe, Sam. You
“What about you Cas? Every time I’ve seen you, you’ve had Uriel sitting on your shoulder. That can’t have been much fun.” He dreaded to think what Uriel would be like with his superiority complex ‘confirmed’.
Dean smiles upwards. “Not anymore, I guess.” He takes another drag. “I used to – when playing peacekeeper between you an’ Dad got too much. Didn’t you wonder where I’d go?” There’s an awkward silence that Sam doesn’t know how to fill. Dean tilts his head down slowly to catch his gaze before looking down, considering the cigarette in his hand.  “But I guess ain’t got to do that no more,” he says, flicking the half-smoked cigarette into the trees, its faint red light swallowed by the damp darkness immediately, Dean watches him – he seems faintly amused. “No more peacekeeping, no more you. You just left, by the way. How’d Stanford go?”
“So you’re telling me you don’t know where he is?” John’s voice is ice cold, the words echo slightly, and it seems to snap Dean into awareness, so that now, when he looks up at John from his (vulnerable) position, his gaze is wary.
“You’re not sleeping in there.” John informed him. “You are not to go near my son, especially while he’s sleeping. Use your own bed like a goddam man.” The words stung more than anything Dean had heard that night, which was saying something.
“Couldn’t go home. Got tired.” He struggled into a seating position, body complaining all the way. Curled up in front of a door wasn’t the most comfortable position after all.
“Good.” She stood briskly, back in librarian mode. “Now, Dean, I know Sam don’t want to see me no more but I just got in the latest Vonnegut, and he
not the problem,” John says sarcastically. “Which means you’re either too stupid or too incompetent to do the one thing I expect of you – which is it?”
Castiel grimaced at the thought. He’d known how popular his father was, but had hoped, stupidly he saw, that once his initial newness wore off he would be allowed to fade into obscurity.
“And this time Sammy there is gonna see how low we sunk,” Demon Dean smiles. “Now, if I were me – and I am me – I would rather face Alistair and hellfire for another forty years than look you two in the eyes right now – that’s just my own special brand of pathetic. Wouldn’t you agree: me?” he directs the last over their shoulders to Dean’s memory, who glares at him, but says nothing.
As the sun crept reluctantly over the horizon, Dean headed back to the house. Sam would be waking up soon.  Then it would be time for school, he could see Castiel again.
More often, however, he wondered what he had done with the times in between everything that mattered. He’d eat and slept some of it away, sure, but there were other, larger gaps that he couldn’t fill.
“It was a nice night,” Sam smiled as the memory came flooding back. “It was my junior prom and Dad was thrilled that I was taking her that he even let me drive the car by myself…” he faltered, as what he was saying caught up with him.
is craving alcohol, for Sam and Dean it must be much, much worse. The fridge, like the cupboards, is sorely lacking in anything appropriate. That, more than anything, propels him into action.
Sam looks at him steadily, as if he’s trying to decide just how much Dean can hear. A multi-coloured sea of people move behind them, but the area between them stays clear: a little pocket of calm in the glittery chaos. Even Cas has wandered off to a new stall and is bent over to examine a pile of rainbow ties. “I’ve sat and listened to you brag about sex and women for
He sniffs it. “Interesting. Wouldn’t you agree?” For a second he’s smoke again, and then he’s directly in front of Sam, offering the heart to him.  Sam wretches, twisting his head as much as he can to try to get away from the sight, from the smell, from the sound.
“Why would the spell bring you here?” Cas asks. “I thought you couldn’t survive in other memories except your own.”
Castiel arrives back at the top of the stairs with a bag from the local market. Dean raises an eyebrow at him. The children beam when they see Castiel reach inside to pull out three full-size candy bars.
“You got in trouble, for me. So much trouble..” Castiel bites his lip and reaches overhead to clutch onto the head board.
Lailah pulls his angel blade out of the vampire’s head, after stabbing him between the eyes. As the vamp falls, Jophiel and Aglibol catch him from behind holding both of his arms behind its back. They wrestle the vamp to the ground. He’s still writhing and wracking his body, and both of the angels struggle. Aglibol shouts over the noise.
"Hey!!!" He moans at the sight of his now bloody suit. Aglibol and Jophiel both take deep breaths as they help each other up. Jophiel goes to Lailah to check on him, then whirls around to face Castiel.
He quickly disappears down the stairs and into the kitchen. The kids lower their arms and look just as confused as Dean and Sam. Dean lowers the knife and tries to hide it. One of the kids is suspicious, thinking the whole procedure is taking too long.
“What?! Why didn’t you just ask me?” Castiel doesn't even bother aiming his question towards Dean. Sam squirms in his seat, and leans over the map table, trying to talk Cas down.
"Castiel. Dean Winchester isn’t worth the pain. Don’t think about him. He never once deserved you…" He hears Castiel gasp out loud. Looking over at Cas, Aglibol can see him trembling, his eyes wide, lips quivering. "Oh, Babe.. don’t do that." Without hesitating, Aglibol takes Castiel and wraps him in his arms. Castiel whimpers, trying to hold everything in, even at this stage of things. But Aglibol can hear Castiel muttering under his breath..a soft murmer.."Jack….Jack…..No….Dean needed you…He loved you so much..."
"Castiel?!" Cas looks up the stairs to see Sam carrying a six pack of beer. He looks shocked to see Cas standing by the door. "You’re back!" He runs down the stairs and crushes Cas into a hug. Cas can’t help but return the hug, burrying his face into Sam’s shoulder.
"Aw Man, Whoever it was sure as hell knew what he/she was doing. I’ve never seen a cut this clean, before. Check it out!" Castiel leans lower to get a closer look. He tilts his head to the side and then notices the set of footprints near the body. He starts. Castiel’s face goes white. Aglibol looks at him, concerned.
“Whatever, we’ve been over this. Sam’s rigged it so that no one gets near the place without us knowing.”
“Do you remember when I said that the fight happened closer to home, this time? Well, I should have specified…”
“Shit,” Dean swears. “That’s a lot Cas. How the fuck can I talk to Sam like this? Will I be like this forever?”
Castiel jumped to his feet. He was shaking. “I’m sorry. This was a mistake.” Was all he said. Then he was gone, running  away from the grass, away from Dean.
“Shhhh, Dean,” Alistair soothes him absently. “Save that pretty voice of yours for something much more important – that ‘yes’ I just know you’re dying to give me.”
“Great the Pastor properly” he ordered, still managing to sound serious despite his ridiculous apron.
“Don’t Lie to me! Sam’s over there,” Dean jerks his head towards the crib. “’N he’s not that big. And Cas isn’t here yet,” he stops, frowning at the words that’ve just left his mouth. “Wait,” he mumbles. “That’s not…I don’t understand.”
“Yeah well, what would you know about it?” Dean turns away, walking past the dark holes in the wall. He pauses in front of one, considering. Each one is identical to the one before it, and there’s nothing on the walls that gives any clue to when exactly they might be. He stops in front of a random patch of darkness, considering. They must be near the end, if he came in through his grave – which means, at least, there shouldn’t be hordes of demons on the other side. Just something much worse.
Looming large behind him, a large, startlingly pink motel block is an eye watering contrast with the blue, cloudless sky. It’s such a perfect rectangle, with the smaller glass and wood rectangles of windows and doors occurring at such perfectly regular intervals, that Cas has to blink at it a couple of times just to make sure it’s really real and really that pink. It’s a far cry from anything he’s ever associated Dean with. He glances at Sam, and is surprised to find the other Winchester smiling.
Sam took a deep breath, his eyes fixed on a point over Dean’s shoulder. “I came here to tell you, that you’re not my brother anymore. What you are is sinful and wrong and I can’t be ok with it.”
Dean found his attention wavering again; he didn’t enjoy church the way Sammy and John did, never found solace in faith, no matter how much he committed to it. He didn’t normally come to church anymore. What was the point? What had God ever done for him?
Cas grimaced. “I didn’t,” he confessed. “I tried everything I could think of save arson to escape, but they – and my father – were determined to ‘save’ me. It was easier to just wait it out, to pretend to be the perfect son who’d been led terribly astray.” His mouth twisted in disgust. “My Dad only allowed me to attend a Christian college, but eventually I managed to get a scholarship to an art college in New York, the pretence didn’t last long after that.”
Castiel knew he should leave; this was what he was supposed to be avoiding.  Instead, he found himself pulling Dean round behind the church.  There was nobody around. They were safe.
“Did you really just have to fucking ask me that?” Demon Dean steps forward into the memory proper, his eyes flickering to black. The space around him warps and ripples, the ground bulging, the trees in the background curving away –as if he’s at the centre of a fisheye lens. “The spell.”
, was able to regain control and throw himself into that cage? There must be something special about you, I thought. Something different. So, I came to find out. But no,” Lucifer shakes his head with a sadness that could almost be genuine.  “Turns out you’re no different from all the other mud monkeys: weak, sentimental, and gullible. Shame.”
The photos were gone this time, he realised. Him holding Sammy in the hospital; him with Mom at a birthday party; Him, John and Sam standing proudly in front of the car. The memories were gone, leaving nothing but shadows. Numbed, he continued up the stairs, ignoring the dark patches.
Once he was out of sight, Dean let out a mangled groan of frustration and fear. “That was close, Cas. Real close. We gotta be more careful.” He was getting to his feet as he spoke, reaching down to help Castiel up.
“No problem Sammy.” The shallow words conveyed nothing of the understanding that passed between them. But they were Winchesters, so it would have to do. “So,” Dean smiled crookedly, “you go first.”
“I was thinking it might be…easier if we rip the band aid off. Y’know, instead of trying to ease him into it.”
If he turned his head left, he could see the solitary bus stop where he’d waited, alone. If he kept his head straight, he could see the hazy, flickering outline of a church looming oppressively above the squat houses. He turned his gaze resolutely to the right, where all he could see was corn. Corn was safe. Who had traumatic memories about corn?
“Well now that that’s settled I think everyone should head home. It’s late.” Gordon beckoned Uriel to follow. At the door he turned to Dean and Cas once more. “Believe me, one day you two will thank us. You’ll be pleased we caught you so early and cured you before it was too late. Goodnight Jimmy. John.” With that they were gone.
“Everything you deserve,” Cas finishes for him. He traces his thumbs tenderly over the bags under Dean’s eyes – wiping away the tears: again and again as they continue to fall, unsure of where the instinct is coming from, but glad of it all the same. “And more.”
“Jessica,” Sam corrected automatically, shooting Dean another confused glance. All he got was in return was a shrug. “And she’s fine, thanks. But Dad,” he paused, “we’re, um, we’re not here to talk about me.”
“No, you’re right Dean.” Cas had deflated, the good mood from his walk gone. “I just wanted to leave so badly I didn’t think.”
“I’m glad you didn’t have to go through it. I’m glad I could do that much. I meant what I said in there: as much as it hurts, and as much as I sometimes think you’re wrong, a part of me is always proud of you for leaving – for being able to think about after. About beyond me, beyond him, beyond mountains.” Dean says, wiping his eyes. “The weirdest part is that I still love him.” his voice cracks. “I still love him so much.”
Castiel was easily lead to the waiting car, too overcome to do anything but sit as he was driven away from town: away from Dean.
For a disconcerting second, Dean was 16 again, staring into the face of Jimmy Novak. But Novak’s eyes had never been blue, had never been filled with such unrelenting, unending, unconditional love.
He drifts in and out of consciousness – waking whenever a song is a little too loud or fast. The first time his eyes open it’s to the sight of Cas reaching over to grasp Dean’s hand on the steering wheel. His mouth is open but Sam can’t hear the words. In the mirror, he sees Dean’s eyes dart to his, and he closes them at once. He hopes Dean didn’t notice. And if he did notice he hopes he didn’t mind too much. He knows that Dean probably never wanted to have this conversation in the first place, but that if he had ever pictured it, it probably involved a
“Threesomes,” Sam corrects. “We don’t know if he’s into men. He might’ve just wanted Cassie and been willing to compromise.”
“I thought I said you weren’t in this episode,” Alistair says, and Cas’ voice cuts off like he’s been muted. “Now remember your lines Sammy – do me proud.”
“Why: don’t you like me?” Dean pretends to wipe away a tear. “I’m hurt Cas. After everything we’ve been through, you still don’t trust me.”
:  there’s no one left to care. It’s ok for you to be proud of who you are and to be a part of this community.” Sam gestures towards a rainbow flag. “I’m not going to abandon you or think any less of you if you do. I don’t care if you’re gay, or bi or queer, you’re my brother and that’s all that matters. That’s all that’s ever mattered.”
“Yeah I get that,” he snaps. “I just need a bit of time, ok?” he sits cross-legged centre stage, refusing to meet the audiences’ (his) eyes. “It’s not like I asked for this.”
“So we had best prepare ourselves for anything,”  Cas nods grimly towards the now not so distant glow, which has revealed itself to be a bedside light clad in a soft pink lampshade; its comforting glow beginning to sketch a room around it. The gentle lines of a large double bed emerges, casting a soft shadow onto what are now walls. There are pillows all over the floor – other rumpled piles of cloth pooled between them. Sam spots a familiar shoe half concealed by an unfamiliar blue shirt, a knife and a gun lying carelessly on the floor beside them (unconsciously, Sam feels for his own weapons – somewhat comforted by their familiar feel, even if they probably won’t do much here). The rose light of the lamp is offset ever so slightly by the faint but harsh orange of a street light edging in through a chink in the curtains and landing on an exposed stretch of skin.  Several exposed stretches of skin actually, all undulating gracefully in time with each other.
There was someone running towards the bus stop. It wasn’t Cas: he realised that almost immediately. No, not Cas (not yet) but just as good.
“You don’t have to tell me that part,” Dean grimaced, “I remember hearing those fucking sermons as far out as Idaho.”
Cas was so shocked at the words that he couldn’t speak.  As he struggled to compose a reply, however, he noticed his father, watching him tensely. He was still on thin ice – he would have to be careful.
Dean didn’t bother turning his head towards the sound of the engine; he just kept his eyes on the corn. The car stopped, and he heard a door open and shut. Sam sat beside him on the bus stop bench, but he didn’t say anything, just rested his head on his hands and sighed.
“I should be so lucky,” Dean snorts. “Nah, I just figured this would be the fastest way down. Chronologically and metaphorically speaking: see?” He gestures to the hole: a faint red glow is emanating from far below the earth. He gets on his knees, leaning his face over. Faintly, he can smell sulphur. It’s enough to make him hesitate, shivers running up his spine, fingers curling themselves unconsciously into the grass.
“It might be easier.” He pointed out, “And if you do then people’d start coming by again.” He smiled at the look of outrage on her face.
“Yeah, but I still said that more to hurt Dean than anything else. Even at the time, I knew I didn’t really mean it – and I thought Dean knew that too.”
“While we’re on the subject,” Dean broke through the mirth, “I need you to promise me you won’t tell anyone,
we're nearing the end now, but it might take a while for me to find the time to upload the rest of it now that i got classes and reading and such.
“Well that’s not the word I’d use, but yeah. And other stuff too y’know,” Dean blushes furiously, mumbling towards his lap. “Like, I dunno, cooking or watching movies or just doing shit together,” he doesn’t seem able to look at Cas. “Look,” he says, a little desperately. “We both want the same thing – but I don’t think either of us really has much experience with it, and I don’t think our lives will let it be normal, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try, y’know?”
Lucifer pouts at him, slowly advancing forwards so that any move Dean makes will inevitably bring them closer together. “Make me.”
“Just that, I dunno, I’d wake up one day and you’d be there and that would be it. That’s how it’s always happened in the past. It was like that with Cassie (and Jonah), with Li…” he grimaces, cuts himself off. “…with everyone. It just kind of…happened.”
“Of course John, why don’t I come over tonight? I’ll bring Castiel to keep the boys company; we’ll make a meal of it.”
are not a step-down. And besides,” he smiles, “those words have no negative connotations for me: by the time I was familiar enough with human culture to feel the insults within them you had already shown me that they didn’t matter. I haven’t had a lifetime of abuse and shame to contend with, so the words of one lonely, vengeful spirit mean little to me.  You, on the other hand, have had a different experience, and admitting that won’t make you weak.”
he spits out Cas’ full name like it’s poison. “Standing calmly to the side this whole time. All these memories have been about Sam so far haven’t they? Must be interesting for you: getting a front-row seat to our goddamn family melodrama.”
“How are you doing that?” Dean (the spell Dean) demands, his eyes flashing the not-quite-dean-green.  The wall in front of them darkens, Dean and the graveyard fading into shadows with it. Sam lets his hand drop.
“Dean! God –” Sam reaches forward blindly, hands skittering over where the worst wounds have been burned into his mind, resting on his brother’s face. “We’re here Dean. We’re here.”
He felt shame burning within him, anger too but mostly shame. Shame that he wasn’t strong enough to be himself: shame that he wasn’t brave enough to do it anyway.
There’s a sickening swallowing sound that Sam can’t bring himself to think about and then the air is filled with the sound of cruel laughter: filling the horizon and echoing back to the empty road.  The world seems to be shaking: the trees moving furiously in the windless night, the stars smudging into trembling white lines, both in the sky above and on the wet road below.
“Castiel,” Pastor Walker began, tone measured. “Your father has some...concerns about your recent behaviour.”
“Good luck out there!” Dean calls after the retreating figure. “Ok, that makes things easier. And saves us from diggin’ at least,” He strides forward.
“Shit,” Sam starts towards him, but Alistair’s power freezes him in place before he can even take one step.
“Your boy ok there John?” he called across the church good naturedly, “or did the Holy Spirit get caught in his throat?” the whole parish laughed as Sam, bright red and still coughing weakly, tried to hide from the stares.
“Well ain’t I just the picture of mental health?” Spell Dean says sweetly. Both Deans look roughly the same age: though the alcohol has smoothed some of the lines from the memory’s skin.
“Oh really?” Dean raised his eyebrows in mock surprise. “I wonder why? I heard you got a girlfriend though so congrats!”
Every word cut into Dean like knives. He half expected to see blood welling on his arms, instead of the tears that were welling in his eyes. Gordon watched him struggle not to cry, enjoying the spectacle. How often had the older Winchester left him catatonic with rage? His constant snipes and comebacks had irked Walker to no end and it was satisfying to finally see him rendered speechless.
I think…when I was with Lisa and Ben,” Dean trails off, looking at his hands, blinking furiously. Sam lets it sit – he doesn’t think Dean’s even said their names out loud in years. They stay that way for a while, the only sounds the rustle of the trees and the gentle lapping of lake water on the shore.
