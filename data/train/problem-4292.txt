“This is Sam,” Mary introduced, holding onto her youngest’s arm and raising it enough to not cause him discomfort. Naomi’s smile grew larger as she stroked his cheek, “He’s gorgeous.”
“So we’re both right?” Castiel asked, letting go of Dean’s arm and crossing his own over his chest in annoyance.
“You’re cursed with a spell that’s making you forget everything, Dean. It isn’t in your control to remember. My name is Castiel,” Cas tried to smile, but seeing how much Dean was struggling to remember things was too painful.
Dean nodded, clearing his throat as he rubbed at his watering eyes, “Yeah, yeah. Must’ve caught something in my eye, that’s all.”
Dean quietly unlocked it, stepping outside and taking in a deep breath of the chill night air. He could feel the tears beginning to swell in his eyes, making him scrub roughly at them to stop any escaping. Despite nobody being around, he feared showing any sign of vulnerability or that John’s words got to him. Clearing his throat, he descended down the front porch, taking a final look at the silent house before getting back into the Impala and driving off.
Castiel sighed, lowering his head in defeat. It had been stupid to get his hopes up. If Dean couldn’t remember what they’d just been talking about, how would he remember any feelings he had for the angel?
“I’ve never watched them,” Castiel immediately regretted the confession, the redhead whacking his shoulder.
John nodded, putting Dean back down. He rubbed his hand over his tired face before trudging into the kitchen, leaving his family in the hallway. Sammy began gurgling as he finished his milk bottle, Mary carrying him back to his crib and settling him down. Dean followed, peeking between the bars to watch as his little brother squirm before curling up and falling back into a deep slumber.
From the sounds of it, John was already pretty closed to being drunk, his footsteps heavy on the wooden floor in the hallway. Dean could hear Mary sorting out Sammy’s food and her gentle voice talking to her husband. Dean bolted down the stairs, colliding into his father with a welcoming hug, “Daddy!”
“It has been wonderful coming over,” Naomi said, brushing down her floral shirt and looking down at her shoes, “We must return the offer sometime.”
The parents followed behind, Mary placing Sam in his baby seat and handing him a bottle of warm milk to gulp down. Castiel and Dean sat in the seats on one side of the baby, Naomi and Chuck sitting on the other side. Mary walked back into the kitchen, bringing out a large oven dish full of roasted meat and potatoes, before going back out to retrieve the bowl of peas. As she served everyone a decent portion of food, Castiel kept a hold of the card, occasionally glancing down at it. Dean seemed to notice, smiling over how much his friend liked the present.
But Dean didn’t go out on hunts, or at least, not as many as he would have done in the past. Instead, he chose to focus on cars and improving his mechanical skills, offering to assist locals in repairs and services whenever he could. Although, Sam knew that this wasn’t the only thing his brother was doing. The younger Winchester knew better than anyone what Dean was doing when the bunker’s door was closed, when the Impala remained parked in the garage for weeks on-end.
“Sounds like an infection,” Dean snarked, smiling at his joke before turning his attention away when he received a glare from Sam.
Castiel paused, trying to think of which ones he had enjoyed other than Harry Potter, “Umm, I mean, The Hunger Games was pretty good.”
Once everyone had tucked into their food, the atmosphere in the room calmed, everyone happily feasting on the wonderful food that had been served. Gabriel was the first one to finish his food, using the back of his sleeve to wipe at his food-covered mouth.
Castiel clambered out of the passenger seat, unsure of what he was supposed to do. His ears were deafened by the blood-curdling screams coming from the crash-site, alerting him that someone was trapped in a vehicle. He raced over, ignoring the frantic yells from Donna behind him. He stopped by the flipped car, crouching down to peer into it. The side door had been ripped open, blood smeared along the seats as though the casualty had been dragged out. Realising that the trapped person wasn’t in there, Castiel turned to the flames, faintly seeing the flailing shadows of desperate arms in one of the cars.
Dean nodded, rolling the shot glass along the edge of its base. He kept his eyes on the glass, hoping that the woman would change the subject.
“Of course not!” Mary said, raising her hand up, “It’s not trouble at all. Just let us know when you’ll be coming round and we can sort food out.”
Before the angel had the chance to respond, Dean’s lurched forward, his lips colliding with Cas’s soft lips, kissing the words out of his mouth. From the Impala, Rowena cheered and Sam clapped from the doorway of the house. Recovering from the initial shock, Castiel felt his lips move against the hunter’s, kissing him back. In that moment, all Cas could focus on was the tenderness of Dean’s lips, how perfect this felt.
Dean smiled as he finished writing. He carefully placed it on top of his clothes drawer, folding it and putting his clock on top of it so it would stay flat. He wandered over to his window, clambering up onto the stool that his mother had put there for him. He peered out, watching as Castiel helped his brother carry some of the bigger boxes into the newly bought house. They both seemed to be happy, smiling as they talked about whatever it is that brothers talk about. Dean silently hoped that he would be an awesome big brother like Gabriel was to Castiel - he wanted to be there for Sammy and annoy him too. He had tried that earlier, being a big brother, but he had been told off for bothering Sammy whole he tried to nap, and that was something you weren’t meant to do with a newborn baby.
“Maybe he’s just drunk. It is almost afternoon, after all,” A loud noise blared through the phone, Sam hearing Rowena’s frustrated shriek on the other end.
The two exchanged looks before Naomi spoke up, “I don’t see why not, so long as it isn’t too much trouble for you?”
“Do you happen to know whose grave this is, Nico?” Dean replied, fiddling with the mixtape in his right hand.
Dean stared at her, “It’s blank, mostly.” He glanced over at Castiel, who was too far away to hear what the two were discussing. Rowena tilted her head to get the hunter’s attention, “What do you remember, Dean?”
“I presume that’s a story for another time,” Castiel grinned, knowing that he was starting to really like the redhead, despite her slightly aggressive behaviour.
“Don’t get all nerdy on him just yet, your highness,” Dean smirked, taking the beer bottle Jo was passing to him. Benny also smiled, humoured by the confused officer, “She’s a little special, no need to worry about her.”
Donna stood up from the booth, leaving a twenty dollar bill on the table, “I’ll see you at work in the morning, Castiel.”
“You’re so not my type,” Charlie giggled, finally managing to control herself, “I’m just in need of new friends – these lot get boring after a while.”
“Is that a dead guy?” Dean asked, peering over Sam’s shoulder. They had made it back to the motel room, Sam now sitting in front of his laptop with the pictures from yesterday up on the screen, “Yeah.”
Charlie’s mouselike footsteps raced towards the garage, her red curls bouncing with each step. She held her nerdy laptop, the cover pasted in fandom stickers and Harry Potter spells, “We got a new officer!”
“There’s no time to explain, we need to go,” Cas said, striding over to the motel door and opening it. He could hear Dean’s excited footsteps behind him, making the angel smile to himself as they both headed towards the beige Lincoln Continental.
Cas nodded, sitting down in the chair opposite the hunter, “Of course. What would you like to know?”
“I’m sure he would love to meet your new friend,” she replied, looking back at the couple, “Will that be all right?”
The raven-haired boy tore his arm away from Dean’s grip, his eyes glaring at him, “Why did you pull me?”
“Cas? We got the book,” Sam’s tired voice called from the other end, “Bring Dean to the Loughlin house.”
Dean was in the kitchen, standing by the stove as he waited for the foil-covered popcorn to stop popping in the pan. He had managed to get one of the radios in the bunker working, and had switched it onto a station that was actually playing decent music. Or at least, decent to Dean’s liking.
The tallest of them sheepishly raised his hand, using his other hand to rub the back of his head, “I hadn’t meant to crash into them, officers. We had to do an emergency stop and-”
It had been pleasant to get to know more people. Castiel hadn’t realised how close the separate first responder services were to each other, or maybe it was solely a friendship between the fire department and the police force. Either way, that was the opposite to what it had been like in New York. The stereotypical cliché of police versus firemen was clearly evident in the city, with neither force interacting with one another, even at the same sites. Gabriel had mocked it, making the comparison to the banter in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, only without the friendly banter and more of the silent treatment and minor threats if the other got in the way.
“Why haven’t we heard of them before?” Sam asked, “If they’re that powerful, the Men of Letters must have known about them.”
“Figured,” Dean muttered in response, setting the mixtape down and began burying it again, “His name was Castiel and he left us too early.”
“Well, from rumours over who knows how long, hunters failed at catching them, letting the wee laddies get away with the book. But, I dismissed them as gossip. Like you say, nobody has seen them for a long time. At least, until you came and decided to kill Gideon.”
The angel was too lost in his thoughts to notice that Dean was now looking at him, his head tilted to see Cas’s face, “Has anyone told you that you have eyes like sapphires?”
“You spelt my name wrong,” Castiel remarked. Dean blushed more, cowering at the mistake, “I’m sorry, you never showed me how to spell it.”
“Yeah, man!” Dean blushed, looking down at their linked hands, “I mean, I don’t remember if I did have that, but it sounds like something I would want.”
“Dean, you forgot your own name,” Sam replied, closing the door behind them and walked over to the window. Dean rolled his eyes at his brother, huffing in response. Peering out to check for any threats, Sam drew the curtains shut, brushing a hand over his face, “All right, look, we know we’re dealing with a witch, right? Maybe you got hexed.”
Cas ran around the front of the car, helping Sam to guide Dean into the extensive house, “Where’s Rowena?”
“Kinda, not really. I’m sorry for disturbing your evening, Gabriel,” Castiel quickly answered, gulping down the scorching tea and wincing at the burning sensation, “When will you be arriving here?”
Dean looked excitedly at the other boy, “That’s cool! I could show you all my friends and the classroom and the playground and-”
Sam turned to look at his brother, who was staring back at him with pleading eyes, “We know Mom’s out hunting who knows what, but Cas could come in handy with this.”
Gabriel walked over to the two boys, making his presence known by hitting the back of his brother’s head. Castiel instantly turned to face him, scowling as he rubbed where he’d been struck, “Why did you do that?”
“Why does it take so long for kernels to open?” Cas’s voice echoed through the room, reaching the hunter before the angel’s figure reached the kitchen doorway.
Both Sam and Cas gave Rowena horrified looks, not understanding why Dean couldn’t recognise his brother. Suddenly, Dean burst out into laughter, bending his legs as he bowed, “Look at his face! Oh! Kind of like the time when I ate all your Halloween candy.”
But he didn’t focus on the movie. His eyes were still on his trapped hand, which had now become intertwined with Cas’s. The angel was rubbing his fingers in a circular motion along the back of Dean’s hand, pausing when there was a loud sound erupting from the TV. Seizing the opportunity, Dean held tighter onto the hand, smiling when he noticed Cas looking back at him.
“That’s stupid,” Castiel declared, picking up the stick again, “Momma said tea is good for you as it has good things in it.”
After Chuck was defeated and Jack took on his role as the new God, everything seemed to be in a state of peace. Monsters still existed but Jack ensured that there was a form of equilibrium between them and humans, reducing the number of hunters working cases. Jack had also returned the people that Chuck had wiped away, returning Eileen to Sam and bringing back everyone that the brothers had lost during the final battle. Once the couple had been reunited, Sam thought it would be best for them to move out of the bunker, settling into a small, suburban house in Lawrence, close enough to visit Dean often. Dean had stayed, reminding Sam that “our legacy isn’t over yet”.
Sam nodded, “I need to make a phone call,” He walked out of the motel room, leaving Rowena to entertain Dean for a while. If Dean couldn’t remember his previous conversation, he wouldn’t remember telling Sam not to call Cas. The angel needed to be here with Dean, no matter what Dean had said before.
Mary nodded, sitting down on the nearest couch and patting the empty space beside her, beckoning the little boy to clamber next to her. Once Dean was settled nestled into her side, she switched on the television to a nature documentary, not wanting to put on anything too loud in case it woke up the sleeping baby. She could feel her son slowly entering sleep, his grip on the side of her dress loosening and his small head dropping into her lap. She ran her fingers through his hair, smiling at him in adoration. From where she was sitting, Mary could see out the window that the two neighbour boys were playing in their front yard, both armed with sticks. She smiled brighter, silently hoping that she would be able to watch her little boys playing like that when Sam was older. Pulling her sleeping son closer to her, Mary rubbed his back, leaning deeper into the couch and closing her eyes.
John huffed, staring out of the side window at the passing buildings. Dean sighed, switching on the car radio and lowering the volume. ‘Hey Jude’ filled the tense air, its soft tune humming through the car. His father angrily reached across, hitting his palm against the radio and abruptly cutting the song, “I don’t want to listen to any fucking music.”
“Were those nice?” Mary chuckled, picking up a paper towel and wiping at her son’s mouth. Dean nodded, handing the plate over to his mother and raising his hands in the air, signaling to be picked up. Once the plate had been put by the sink, Mary crouched down as she lifted the four-year-old and balanced him on her hip, “Shall we go say hello to the new neighbours?” She asked, her smile broadening as Dean coiled his little hand around her finger. The boy nodded eagerly, shifting excitedly in his mother’s grip.
“Who’s Cas?” Dean butted in, standing up from the bed. Rowena glanced over at him, sympathy in her eyes, “He hasn’t got long, Samuel.”
Dean stopped, grabbing onto Sam’s forearm and forcing him to halt as well, “Wait, witches are real?”
“You’ve drank enough for one night, Dad,” Dean replied, wandering into the kitchen and stopping as soon as he saw the mess. Every cupboard door was open, the plates smashed on the floor. There were only a few packets of food still on the shelves, the fridge door wide open revealing a six-pack of beer. Dean sighed, crouching down and began picking up the debris. It had been a few days since he had last seen John, but the place hadn’t been in this much of a state.
Dean wandered over to the closest bed to the window, sitting down on the edge. He began taking off his jacket, grunting as his arm got stuck in the sleeve, “Dude, if a witch got a clear shot of me, I would be dead, okay? I wouldn’t be freakin’, uh… Dory.”
Suddenly, the hive disappeared, leaving Dean and Castiel alone in the front yard. The black-haired boy gripped onto Dean, getting his attention, “Did you hear me?”
“No you’re not, Dean!” Sam shouted in exasperation, throwing his arms up, “We’re gonna get you some help.”
“Witches use them in spells, but I’ve actually never seen anything like this before. Maybe Rowena will recognise them.”
“I’m glad you all liked it,” Mary smiled, picking up Sam from his seat and resting him on her lap. She began patting at his back soothingly as he squirmed and gurgled. Dean and Castiel finished at the same time, trying to mimic how their parents had arranged their cutlery, ending up making a chorus of noise as metal clanged on the ceramic plates.
“Castiel? Like an angel!” Nico shouted excitedly, resting his little hand on the engravings of the stone, “Is that what it says on here?”
Before Dean could finish his sentence, a finger was pressed against his lips. Cas was now fully looking at him, leaning over so that his chest was up against Dean’s, “You’re interrupting the movie,” the angel whispered, returning back to his initial position, but keeping his hand holding the hunter’s. Dean huffed, shuffling on the couch to get himself comfortable again so that he could focus on the movie.
“I’m surprised it’s taken her this long to interrogate the young man,” Ellen laughed, continuing to wipe down the surface of the bar, “Hasn’t he been here two weeks now?”
Cas paused, glancing up at the ceiling, “He’s a very caring and loving human. Everything he does, the good and the bad, he does for love. He raised his little brother for love, and fought for the whole world for love. He’ll deny it, but he’s the most caring man on Earth and is the most selfless, loving human being I will ever know,” Cas smiled, “Ever since I pulled him out of Hell, just knowing him has changed me.”
“Do you want me to come with you?” Benny asked, helping his friend up and taking the car keys out of Dean’s back pocket.
Four years came and went, four years of the world continuing whilst Dean struggled to hold on. Sam and Eileen now had a son who was already turning into a miniature version of his uncle. Jack occasionally visited the brothers, updating the two on the peace within the supernatural realm and his success in being God. And Dean…
Dean looked over at his mother, noticing how Mary was standing with her arms crossed over her chest. She seemed less tense than she usually was, making the little boy happy. If his mom liked the new neighbours, he could hang out with Castiel more. And even though the boy was slightly peculiar, Dean was starting to grow fond of him and his quirkiness.
A gentle knock at the door caused both men to peer over, Dean instantly getting up and walking towards it.
Before Dean could retaliate, he was being dragged back towards the grownups. He realised that there was a short man standing beside the woman who must’ve been Castiel’s Momma.
“Okay!” Dean replied excitedly, running up the stairs and into his bedroom. He rummaged through the arts and crafts drawer in the corner of the room, pulling out his favourite pack of crayons and a couple of pieces of card. As delicately as he could, he began drawing a blue flower in the middle of a piece of green card. He coloured in each petal with a different shade of blue, adding yellow specks in the centre and then yellow dots all around the wonky flower. He picked up the black crayon, sticking his tongue out as he drew black stripes on the patches of yellow and putting little lines at one end of each dot, making dozens of buzzing bees on the card.
“I can handle John,” Dean growled, pushing the glass towards her and standing up, “I’ll pay when I get Charlie and Benny’s orders,” He turned on his heels, walking over to where his friends had perched themselves in the corner of the room. Benny instantly sensed the change in his demeanour, a flash of worry glinting in his eyes, “You good, cher?”
The three waved the firefighter off as he left. Donna sat herself comfortably in the middle of the seat, finishing her beer, “Novak, we both have to be in early tomorrow, and I don’t need you to be more of a zombie than you were this morning.”
“Dad, does tea make your teeth yellow?” Castiel yelled, keeping a firm hold of Dean’s arm. The short man glanced down at the two boys, “Castiel, what did we say about wanting to talk when we already are?”
“Always,” Dean whispered, standing up and resting a hand on his nephew’s shoulder, “Come on, I’m sure your dad is looking for you by now.” Softly, he nudged the boy away from the grave, pulling a forced smile as Nico ran back towards the bunker.
“My name is Dean Winchester,” Dean mumbled, continuing to fidget with his shirt. Cas kept his gaze on him, curious as to what Dean was talking about.
“I highly doubt that’s correct, especially considering the fact that it’s ranked one of the lowest out of the franchise.”
Dean nodded excitedly, turning the card around so that he could look at the front, “Do you think he’ll like it?”
“Relax, your highness,” Dean raised his hands up in surrender, “The news that there was a new officer came out last week, where have you been?”
Benny threw his head back as he laughed, hitting Dean in the back with his palm as he failed to keep in his reaction, “Isn’t that the screwup who almost stopped you saving that girl, cher?”
“I should probably check up on him,” Benny said, clambering out of the booth and following Dean. Castiel looked back at Charlie, “Were there any other questions you wanted to ask?”
“Assess the situation, make sure everyone is safe,” She replied, swerving around the corner and slamming on the breaks. The site before them was enough to make the officers’ hearts stop. Three cars had been involved in the accident: one of them entirely flipped with the roof on the road, and the other two entirely in flames. Pedestrians were standing by the edges of the scene, another police car blocking any other vehicles passing the site. A fire engine was parked opposite the blaze, men in yellow uniforms dashing across the street carrying large hoses.
“No, Dean. It’s not cool,” Sam took a step back, rubbing his forehead, “Killing the witch was supposed to be the cure. So if he’s already dead, then why are you still…”
Castiel smiled at him, leaning further back against the headrest of the bed. He could feel Dean curl up against his side, their hands still holding each other.
“Sam, over here!” Dean called, standing a few feet away. Sam walked over, having to force himself to stop before stepping on what had caught Dean’s interest.
Rowena sighed, “We could do a memory spell. The obliviate spell wipes the memory clean over time, but it’s intricate magic. I-”
“I don’t know,” Dean replied honestly, patting the ground where he had poorly hidden the tape, “He was Cas. He was the one who brought me back, the one who was there when your dad couldn’t be.”
“Why the fuck are you even here, Dean?” John asked, rubbing his temples in an attempt to expel the growing headache.
“Well, he is old enough to make his own decisions, Dean. Even if it hurts you, you still gotta be there to support him, as that’s what family does,” Benny replied, approaching the far table and pouring himself a cup of coffee.
As the two kissed for what seemed an eternity, Sam and Rowena got into the Impala, leaving the other Winchester and angel to catch up on the missed moments over the last eight years.
Castiel waited for the truck to drive away, the horn going as it passed the police car. Donna patted him on the shoulder, nudging him towards the vehicle, “Looks like we have some paperwork to do now,” She smiled, walking over to the driver’s door and getting in. Taking one last look at the sight, Castiel finally noticed the full damage of the cars: the two that had been on fire were now hollow wrecks, the flipped car surrounded in broken glass.
The station alarm blared out through the garage, triggering both Dean and Benny to run towards the uniform hangers, slipping into their jackets.
Castiel was growing impatient of waiting, tapping his foot on the sidewalk to try and get his parents’ attention. Dean looked around, confused as to where Gabriel had gone. He thought he had seen the older boy go into the house with a packet of candy, but he hadn’t reappeared yet.
His mind wandered to a memory of the angel, which was a common occurrence every time he visited. He remembered when it was only him and Cas at the bunker - Sam was out on one of his weekly dates with Eileen.
Nodding, Dean clambered into the driver seat of the engine, the other six firefighters sitting in the jumpseat area, as they drove off.
Castiel sat in front of his desk in the central area of the station, cradling a cup of coffee like a lifeline. The early mornings and late evenings certainly hadn’t done him any favours, leaving him in a zombie-like state until around midday. He took a sip of the warm brew, sighing contently and clicked at his computer. Jody had assigned the man to read over Garth’s report on the latest petty theft, seeing as Castiel had far more experience than the younger recruit. Continuing his coffee, he read over the document, the friendly rumble of office conversation filling the room.
It had taken the Novaks a few days to finish moving in. The once-full cardboard boxes were now folded and piled on the curb outside the house, alongside a couple of large trash bags next to a full trash can. Despite being neighbours, Dean hadn’t talked to Castiel since their first interaction, neither attempting to make the first move. Naomi had popped by the previous morning, accepting the offer to have dinner at the Winchester household the following evening. When Mary had told her eldest son, Dean jumped up in excitement, throwing his hands up as he struggled to stay still, “Can Castiel stay for a sleepover?” He pleaded, gripping onto Mary’s shirt to get her attention, “I promise to be quiet so Sammy can still sleep.”
“Wait,” Charlie snatched the laptop away from the men, a scowl imprinted on her face, “You mean to say that you met him and didn’t even tell me?! What the hell, Winchester?!”
Sam knew Dean visited the grave often - it seemed like every time he stopped by, the stone had been recently cleaned and the mixtape was less and less buried. He would also notice the growing collection of possessions dedicated to the owner of the grave: a striped, blue tie wrapped around another branch of the oak tree; more and more bee-related objects darted within the grass; a glass of whiskey left untouched.
“Officers Hanscum and Novak are heading towards the wreckage,” Donna yelled, pushing down on the car microphone.
Checking that no cars were passing, Dean tugged his father across the street, his muscles tensing with each collision of John’s fist as he weakly punched him. Suddenly, John stopped, his body beginning to sway, “I think I’m gonna be sick.”
“Uh huh, sure…” Sam smirked, crossing his arms over his chest, “He probably won’t remember this, you know?”
Whilst he kept telling himself that Cas was still alive, Dean knew that accepting the fact that he would never see that trench-coated angel again would help him move on. Surprisingly, it had been his own idea to create a gravestone for the angel, somewhere for the hunter to seek solace when memories of Cas became too haunting. It had been Dean who suggested to Sam that they decorate the area surrounding the gravestone with totems reminding them of the angel:
Ceramic bees encompassed the stone; black feathers coated the grass within the circle; a ‘grumpy cat’ plushie perched on a branch from a neighbouring oak tree. A mixtape partially buried beside the stone, its label visible to anyone crouching to touch the gravestone: “Dean’s top 13 Zepp traxx”.
She clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth, shaking her head, “That girl. Honestly,” Ellen looked back at Dean, concern etching into her features, “John was here last night. He didn’t look so good.”
“Anytime,” Mary smiled. Dean took a step away, bowing his head to hide his blushing cheeks. His mother pulled him to her side, giving his arm a gentle squeeze of reassurance.
“And yet you didn’t pull away,” Cas smirked, “just because I made the first move doesn’t mean it wasn’t reciprocated.”
“It just takes some people longer to get used to new people, that’s all,” Mary replied, “I’m sure it’s very scary for him to be in a new place.”
“How else are you meant to eat it?” He retaliated, his eyes squinting in that cute way that he had been doing when they first met.
Castiel’s cellphone rang aggressively in the peaceful motel room, stirring both Dean and Cas up from their almost slumber-like states. Answering the phone, Cas brought it to his ear, “Did you find them?”
“Dean, can you help me clear away?” Mary kindly asked, her eldest jumping out of his seat and picking up his plate. As precariously as possible, he carried it into the kitchen, making repeated trips until all the dishes had been cleared away. Mary stood up from her seat, carrying Sam over to his crib and laying him down, pulling the blanket over him as his eyes began to close.
I realy hope we will be the bestest of frends at skool and we will play evry day and we stay frends wen we get old.
Once he was satisfied with the front of the card, he skilfully folded it in half, and opened it up. Grabbing a blue gel pen, he tugged the lid off and began writing inside the card:
“Aha, but we do! I texted Donna and she said that after their call, she wanted to award Castiel so she’s taking him here,” Charlie grinned, grabbing the two men by the forearms and dragging them inside.
“You must really love him,” Dean smiled, resting his hand on the one Cas had on his thigh, “Have you told him that you love him?”
So do Dean and I, Cas thought, sighing as the two headed towards the parked vehicles. Rowena began packing the Black Grimoire into her suitcase, and Cas walked towards his Lincoln Continental, perching himself on the bonnet as he waited for the brothers.
He never brought it up with Dean, and Dean wasn’t one to have a heart-to-heart moment voluntarily. The topic brooded in the air between them but it was never acknowledged, just accepted silently. With Sam’s growing family, it was easy for the two to avoid it entirely, focusing more on the present and what wonders would come in the future. But Sam knew Dean wasn’t always focused on those things.
“Do you like bees too?” Castiel asked, his eyes glinting with excitement. Dean felt his cheeks reddening, “I don’t really know much about bees.”
“Dean, wait a second!” Sam tried calling, quickly rummaging through his coat pocket to grab his gun. Unfortunately, Dean had already opened the door, revealing a ruffled Rowena holding onto a suitcase and book.
He ran up the stairs into his bedroom, standing in front of his drawer. He hadn’t touched the card for his new neighbour since having finished it, the blue paper still underneath the clock. Delicately, he pulled it out from under the clock, holding it carefully in his hands. Turning around, he sprinted down the stairs, throwing it into his mother’s face, “Look what I made!”
“Wait, you’re the most powerful witch we know,” Sam said. Rowena blushed at the compliment. “Why can’t you break it?”
As he entered, the sudden feeling of loneliness hit him. Castiel reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone, strolling through the contacts until he found his brother’s name. Putting the phone on speaker, he placed it down on the counter. Gabriel answered on the second ring, “Cassie! Why are you calling me at midnight? Did you get mugged?”
Dean nodded, clambering onto his bed and wriggling under the blanket, “Will we have the same friends?”
“I’m a wee bit occupied at the moment,” Rowena’s alluring voice rang. In the background, Sam could hear the grumbling of men behind the witch.
“Wreckers will clean it up,” Donna said, starting up the engine. Castiel got into the car, watching out the side window as they drove back to the station.
“I hope he does lie pie,” Dean mumbled, ducking his head out of his mother’s reach, “Will there be honey?”
“Yeah yeah, Winchester,” Donna joked, finger gunning the firefighter as he walked back towards the fire engine, “Say hi to the others for me!”
Grabbing a nearby stick, Sam prodded at the prone figure, noticing the dried blood trail on the man’s face, “I think that’s our witch.”
“I’ll be there in a bit, Dad, just let me get in the car,” Dean growled, storming out of the bar. Benny jogged up to him, placing his hand on his shoulder. He furrowed his brow, nodding sympathetically when Dean sighed and shook his head, “Look, just wait outside and I’ll be pick you up. See you soon,” He hung up, collapsing against the side of the Impala, “Can’t he just go one week without ending up like this?”
“What’s got you so down in the dumps?” Benny’s voice roused Dean from his thoughts. He looked over at his friend, before sighing and leaning against the side compartment of the truck, “Family drama.”
“Everybody back away!” Donna yelled, putting her arms out in front. Castiel followed her lead, having to shove back a man who was getting too close to them.
“How do you feel Dean?” Cas questioned, taking a step closer to the motionless hunter. Dean kept his eyes on Sam, his eyebrows furrowing, “Who’s this hippie?”
“I should have done that ages ago,” Dean chuckled, shifting to lean against the side of the Lincoln Continental. Somehow, Castiel’s smile grew as he gazed down all flustered, “I always thought this was something I couldn’t have.”
“We were what?” Cas asked, reaching for the television remote and turning down the volume. Dean gulped, fiddling with his shirt again, “You know… A thing?”
“Then he’ll be missing out,” She replied, guiding him up the stairs to his bedroom, “You’ll both be in the same class at school, he’ll want to be your friend.”
The Roadhouse had a very homey scent, the perfect combination of greasy food and alcohol, mixed with a hint of men’s cologne and cheap perfume. Dean let the comforting air warm him, always being a comfort for him. The bar wasn’t too full on this evening, the regulars all huddled by the main bar with their eyes fixed to the football game on the television, and some others enjoying a casual meal by the tables around the room. Dean looked around, noticing Ellen scrubbing away behind the bar, and Jo waltzing around with a tray raised and full of empty glasses.
“We were on our way to campus,” One of the passengers replied, his face covered with small plasters over glass cuts, “Our classes started a half hour ago and we needed to get there quickly.”
“It’s the only way she knows how to show affection,” Donna joked, moving away when Charlie threatened to punch her.
“The only spell I know takes more time than what Dean’s got. He’s already begun to forget himself, everyone he’s ever known. Ever loved.”
“Remind me when we meet again on Friday,” Charlie winked, waiting for him to move out of the booth before sliding her way across, “Until next time, Castiel Novak.” She brushed down her jeans, then saluted the two, “Peace out bitches,” She called as she walked out of the bar.
On the other side of town, Dean Winchester pulled his Baby over to the side of the road. Dean could instantly notice his father’s hunched figure leaning against the side wall of Walker’s Bar, clasping an empty glass bottle. He stepped out of the car, hastily walking over to his father’s drunken form.
The firefighter chuckled, extending a soot-covered hand towards the officer, “You must be the new police officer. I’m Dean.”
“Hello Dean,” Cas said, looking at the hunter with fondness. Dean began rubbing the back of his head, flustered, “Sammy has told me your name but I uh, I forgot it already. Sorry.”
Dean wandered over to Mary, clinging onto her leg like a little bear. She reached down and ruffled his sandy hair, “How would you feel about the Novaks coming around for dinner soon?”
“Don’t think I’m going anywhere with you gay ass,” John slurred, carelessly dropping the bottle. Dean flinched at the sound of the glass smashing, trying to ignore his father.
The trash can had been knocked over, its contents spilling over the overgrown lawn. Shards of broken glass scattered the front porch, glinting in the light from the streetlamps, empty cans scrunched and tossed carelessly in front of the house.
“You have other friends too, sweetie. Remember Charlie and Jo? They’re your friends too, aren’t they?”
“Uncle?” Nico interrupted Dean’s thoughts, tugging lightly on the base of his uncle’s shirt, “Are you okay?”
Castiel nodded, getting himself behind Dean to push him up the stairs. Whilst Dean could walk by himself, it seemed that his mind was getting too distracted by everything in the main foyer. Cas could see where Sam and Rowena had battled with the Loughlin siblings – pieces of shattered glass scattered the staircase and marble floor, blood splatters like paint covered the hallway walls. From the corner of his eye, Cas could see a woman’s body that had been pushed aside, presumably the Loughlin sister.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you two. I’m Naomi, and that,” The other woman pointed to the brown-haired boy, “is my son, Gabriel. And over there,” she turned again, signalling towards the other boy by the van, “is our youngest, Castiel.”
Mary picked up her sleeping baby, slowly walking back up the stairs and into the master bedroom. Once she placed Sam into the comfier crib next to her bed, she prepared herself for sleep, climbing into bed and switching off the bedroom lamp. Laying down, she stared up at the ceiling, her ears perked to listen for the click of the front door.
“He’s lucky he’s got Dean,” Benny replied, clinking his bottle with hers before downing some of the beer.
The other boy glanced up from where he was crouched on the sidewalk, a pointed stick in his hand. The first thing Dean noticed about him were the striking blue eyes that the raven-haired boy had, surrounded by sun kissed freckles on his cheeks and nose. He was wearing a loose plaid shirt and dirty shorts, his shoelaces untied.
“Oh,” Dean replied, lowering his gaze shyly. Castiel grasped onto his arm, “Let’s ask Momma if tea does make your teeth yellow.”
“Do not leave the city in the next 48 hours, and it is preferred for you to stay home until further notice,” Castiel said. The three men nodded, scrambling off when Donna waved them away.
Meanwhile, Dean lay in his bed, his snores becoming deeper as he spiralled into dreams of playing with his new friend in the front yard. They were both surrounded by bees of different sizes and colours, blue bees buzzing loudly in their ears as they poked the hive with sticks. Cas was giggling quietly as he prodded the nest, licking the honey that was accumulating on one end.
Dean peered down at the stone, wiping at the graving as if he were wiping away tears, “I’ll be back soon, Cas. I promise.” He turned around, slowly following his nephew back home.
Neither Sam nor Rowena were surprised at how quickly the angel had arrived after Sam had called. Despite his grace depleting at a too fast rate, Castiel had forced his wings to carry him to the motel that the Winchesters were residing in. Sam had managed to fill in some of the blanks on the phone, and from the sound of it, Dean didn’t have long before he would forget everything.
“Likewise,” Dean smiled, peering over Castiel’s shoulder to look at Donna, “Don’t let him do that again, Hanscum,” He winked, stepping away.
“We can be best friends forever and ever!” Dean cheered, jumping around. Castiel joined him, laughing before laying on his back in the grass, “We will always be friends, Dean.”
Mary smiled down at her son, ruffling his hair again, “I’m sure I can find a recipe that uses honey.” She looked up at the two Novaks as she waved, “We will see you soon!”
Charlie shook her head, her phone facing upwards on the table, “Donna texted, saying they’ll be arriving soon.”
Dean nodded, brushing the back of his hand over his eyes. Mary stood back up, brushing down her crumpled jeans, then resting her hands on her hips, “Now, let’s make sure everything’s ready for their arrival.”
Sam couldn’t help but notice the slight blushing of his brother’s cheeks as he replied. Dean managed to tug his arm out of his jacket, tossing the coat onto the floor and kicking it away. Whilst kid films certainly weren’t his go-to thing, something about Dory had drawn the character close to Dean’s heart. Perhaps it was her resemblance to a certain angel, her deep blue colour reminding the older hunter of someone’s eyes, or her attitude being similar to that of a lost baby-in-a-trenchcoat. Not that Dean would ever admit to this reasoning behind his love for the character.
“Come in, come in,” Mary beckoned, stepping out of the way to allow the other three Novaks into the house. Naomi smiled as she noticed baby Sam, who was rubbing at his eyes tiredly, “What a sweet little angel you have there,” she cooed, dangling her fingers in front of the baby’s face to catch his attention, “Hello there, precious.”
“Come on, Dad, let’s get you home,” Dean pulled his father’s free arm over his shoulder, wrapping his around John’s waist to support him. He could feel the intrusive eyes staring at him from other people on the street as he tried to get his dad’s frame away from the wall.
“Hello there!” Mary said warmly, tightening her grip on Dean as he fidgeted, “We saw the moving van and thought it’d be nice to help you get settled in. I’m Mary, and this is my eldest son, Dean.” She raised the hand that Dean was clutching, waving it so that it looked like Dean was waving too.
“Oh,” Dean looked down as he walked, his brows furrowing, “I will do everything I can to make him happy.”
The older Winchester made his way into the living room, throwing himself onto the armchair, “Bring me a fucking beer.”
Gabriel had helped Castiel move into his new apartment, checking that the water and electricity was working, “These things usually get brushed over by new tenants, Cassie,” He lectured his brother about the reasons behind the checks, fiddling with the heating and showers whilst he was at it. The apartment itself was larger than the one he had lived in when he was in New York, the new place having three adequately-sized bedrooms, two bathrooms and a fairly expansive living room space. His fridge was large enough to cram Gabriel into (which Castiel had seized immediate opportunity to do when the older man was playing with the temperature gauge), and there were plenty of cupboards to fill with food and plates. They had gone out to buy Castiel new furniture, with a 65-inch television being the ‘piece de resistance’ in the apartment. Once the necessities had been aquired, including the desk by the balcony door and a somewhat decent computer for Castiel to use for work, Gabriel had returned back to New York, going back to his café.
Dean reached into the bowl, his hand freezing when he felt it brush against Cas’s. He muttered an apology under his breath, his cheeks blushing slightly as he retracted his hand. But before it could return to his lap, Cas grabbed it, gripping onto it gently but also somehow in a deathgrip. Dean could feel his cheeks redden more, his breath catching in his throat. Cas guided their hands to beside the bowl, so that Dean was practically leaning onto the angel.
Dean politely accepted the hand, shaking it gently before putting his hand back by his side, “Hi,” he whispered shyly.
Dean was surprised at how quickly Castiel’s attitude had changed. He was now standing up in front of them, hopping from one foot to the other as though he had too much energy to stay still, “We could get honey bees and bumblebees!”
“It’s more like Charlie dragged me in, actually,” He chuckled, watching as she poured him a healthy shot of whiskey, “She wants to meet the new officer.”
“H-Hi,” Dean stuttered, managing to rip his arm out of Gabriel’s grip and extending it out to the other boy, “I’m Dean.”
“Charlie’s a lesbian,” Dean laughed. Donna used the back of her sleeve to wipe at her watering eyes, Benny already failing to keep the tears of laughter back, “Oh he’s definitely a keeper, cher.”
“Momma says it’s easier to write ‘Cas’ instead of my full name,” Castiel replied, “My friends used to call me Cas before we moved.”
Finally, Cas pulled away, resting his hand against Dean’s chest, “Why did it have to be a memory spell that made you act?”
“Wait for me to open the door first, sweetie,” Mary called from the kitchen, picking up the baby from his crib. The noise of his older brother squealing had awoken Sam, his immediate response to shriek back happily. Their mother grinned as she carried the baby to where his brother was hopping from one foot to the other, keeping a safe distance from the door. As soon as Mary unlocked the door and opened it, his little hand reached out, snatching Castiel’s arm and dragging him in, “Hi Castiel!”
“I, uh, don’t swing your way, Charlie,” Castiel replied, sipping his water, “It never would have worked anyway.”
The man laughed deeply, surprising Dean with how low the noise was, “Castiel spoke of his bee obsession then?”
John spluttered out any of the remaining contents from his stomach, groaning as he swiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
She pushed against the door, being careful to not make much noise. There was no sound coming from the crib, Sam was still fast asleep. Dean followed behind her as she entered the hallway, “Why don’t you go to your room and make something for your new friend?”
It’s now or never, Winchester, Dean thought, raising his head as he stepped in front of Cas, “Has anyone told you that you have eyes like sapphires?”
“We will have to ask his mother, but I don’t see why not,” she replied, ruffling up Dean’s sandy hair before returning her attention to preparing a slow-roast.
“Naomi and Chuck Novak were very pleasant to chat with,” Mary interjected, walking into the hallway bouncing Sammy on her hip, “They’ll be coming over for dinner next week.”
“Get who to who?” Dean asked, pulling away from Sam as he tried grabbing his arm, “And who are you?”
“I don’t want that,” Castiel interrupted, glaring over at him, “I don’t want to go to school here. I want to go back home.”
The evening sun settled under the horizon, leaving only a glimmer of light to shine onto the cleaned gravestone. Even in the dimming light, its engraving could still be read:
“Then you must’ve really liked him!” Nico yelled, jumping up, “Dad tells Mom that he loves her every day, and brings her flowers and cooks for her and dances with her. And when they think I’m not looking, they even kiss!” He whispered the last bit, giggling once he said it. Dean smiled at him, his eyes beginning to water at the child’s innocence and excitement.
Castiel continued making his tea, scooping a heavy teaspoon of honey from the jar and dipping it into the herbal tea, using the spoon to calmingly stir the liquid.
Mary nudged her son towards the extended hand, smiling reassuringly at him as he reached to take the candy. Before Dean could react, Gabriel grabbed his arm, dragging him away from the two women, “Come on, you’ll love Cassie!”
Dean rolled his eyes as Charlie began waving at the two police officers. Donna slid into the seat next to Dean, her warming smile on her lips. Castiel didn’t have time to act before Charlie grabbed his arm and pulled him into the seat next to her, clutching his right hand with hers, “Charlie Bradbury, technological genius and Queen of Moondoor.”
Dean shrugged, pointing the flashlight around the area. Sam sighed, nudging his brother in the direction back to the car. Hopefully Rowena would have answers.
“You know how she gets though,” Benny stepped out of the booth, politely bowing towards everyone, “Have a good evening, and I hope we can do this again.”
“No arguments! There is no way in hell you’re sitting next to me wearing your normal clothes when we’re watching ‘Godzilla vs Mothra’.”
“Don’t answer anything you don’t want to,” Benny interrupted, earning himself another kick, “This isn’t some interrogation, Char!”
Benny chuckled as he saw Castiel brace himself for another punch, “Take it easy, Char. Just because Dean’s gone doesn’t mean you can hastle the poor man.”
Dean cursed as his phone loudly blurted out. He scrambled through his pockets trying to find it, signalling for Donna to step out of the booth to let him leave. Looking at the screen, he groaned, accepting the call before bringing the phone to his ear, “Where are you?”
“What are you doing out here, uncle?” Nico asked, crouching next to Dean, who was leaning against the back of the gravestone, his head resting on top of it. He opened his eyes, peering over at his nephew. Just from looking at the boy, it was obvious that he was related to Sam - both had the same hazel-green eyes and chestnut-coloured locks, not to mention that both were freakishly tall. Even at seven-years-old, Nico was a tall child, and everyone knew he would end up taller than his father.
“Why wouldn’t-” Dean huffed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “There’s a spare set of sweatpants and a t-shirt in the top drawer in your room. Hurry up and go change.”
“Anytime, cher,” He handed Dean the keys, stepping away and waited for the black Impala to swerve out of the parking lot. Once sure that Dean had left, Benny returned inside, immediately greeted by Charlie’s yelling, “What do you mean you don’t like The Hobbit?!”
“Dean!” John chuckled, easily picking up his eldest and swirling him above his head, “What have you been up to today?”
“Another friend,” Sam replied, looking concerningly at his brother. He was getting worse by the minute – not a good sign. Returning his attention back to the markings, Sam took a couple of photos on his phone, directly sending them to the redhead.
“I don’t think he’s interested,” Cas replied, looking expectantly at Dean’s repulsed reaction to him saying that he was interested in a man. But it never came. Instead, Dean looked at him curiously, “What makes you say that?”
Mary chuckled at the obscure question. Of course, that was the deeming question that would decide whether Dean would remain friends with the boy - it had come as a shock to Mary when she discovered her son’s adoration for pie. Cherry pie was Dean’s favourite flavour, closely followed by apple and pecan.
Castiel paused, unsure of what to say. If he was talking to the normal Dean, he would have immediately responded with a “yes”. But something in the back of his mind was bothering him. The normal Dean seemed to only want a friendship with him, but Cas had always wanted something more from their relationship. From the moment he had seen Dean’s pure soul in the deepest pit of Hell, Cas knew his relationship with the older Winchester would be different to any other he would develop with humanity.
“Great,” Dean replied, sliding into the booth next to him, “So, any sign of your new victim, your highness?”
The older man nodded, stumbling towards the passenger door and swinging it open as he tumbled into the seat. Dean waited until he heard the brutal slam of the door, patting the roof of the car as an apologetic gesture before sitting in the driver’s seat. He carefully drove the car around the pile of spew, also taking it slowly in case John needed to jump out and be sick outside again.
“You said I was hot,” Cas replied, somehow his cheeks blushing even more. Dean blushed too, clearing his throat nervously, “Well, I ain’t lying.”
“Where are your manners, Castiel?” The man scowled, putting his large hand on the boy’s shoulder, “You know not to be rude.”
The front door boomed open, announcing the arrival of John Winchester. John was known in town for his responsibilities down at the mechanics, working alongside a gruff man who was basically Dean’s uncle, Bobby Singer. Whilst John was helpful to the townspeople for his occupation, it was common knowledge that John had an underlying alcohol addiction, spending most of his evenings so drunk he would forget everything the next day. Dean had managed to avoid interacting with his drunk father, but he was aware of how different he was, and how frequent his father was getting wasted earlier in the evening.
Jo returned back to the group, passing over the two shots to the firefighters and the water to her colleague, “What has the new guy answered wrong?”
“Another bar, most likely,” She growled in reply, shaking her head as she had the first sip of the beer, “He’s lucky Dean gets to him before we do, or else John Winchester would have a record as long as the Wakarusa River.”
“Easy now love,” Chuck smirked, putting his hand on his wife’s shoulder, “Don’t forget you have your own little angels.”
Gabriel sighed, “I know, Cassie, but Dad has a new job here and we all had to move with him. At least here we have a backyard. I bet we can get Dad to buy a beehive or something!”
“None of your goddamn business, Dean,” John replied, pushing open the car door and stumbling out. His son followed after him, carefully stepping on gaps between the stacks of rubbish. John made it to the front door first, shoving his entire weight against it and tumbling in, cursing as he fell. Before Dean could offer to help him up, he snatched his arm away, “Don’t fucking touch me. I don’t need your gay hands on me.”
Sam coughed at the final part of the question, looking back at Dean, “Sirens change their appearance to match their victim’s preferences.”
Turning to face her sleeping baby, Mary smiled softly, reaching her hand over so that she was touching one of the bars, guarding her child. Like her sons, sleep overran her body, as she lapsed into a dreamless slumber, her mind only thinking of what tomorrow would hold.
Nodding her head, Mary walked over to the freezer, taking out the ripped bag of greens. Dean waited by the dining table, tapping his fingers against the wooden frame of a chair as he watched as his mother masterfully moved around the kitchen. As a pot of water was being filled in the sink, she switched on the stove, flames flickering underneath the gas hub.
“Your name is Dean Winchester,” Castiel finished the sentence, hoping to try and uplift the hunter’s spirit, “Do you remember my name, Dean?”
“We will need to look at the CCTV and speed cameras to come to a conclusion as to what to do with you boys, but in the meantime, we need to take down your names, addresses and phone numbers as we will be in contact with you soon,” Donna glanced over the young men, crossing her arms and waiting patiently as each recited their personal details to Castiel.
He whistled as he entered the room, earning himself a side-glare from the angel as he placed the bowl in Cas’s lap and the bottles on the table in front of them, “You ready to watch the best Godzilla movie ever created?”
“Yes, of course. My apologies for calling then, since you don’t seem at all interested in speaking to me.”
“Leave me the fuck alone you fag,” He began resisting, slamming his fist against Dean’s chest, “Let me go!”
Dean sighed, reaching up and closing Bess’ side compartment and stood next to his friend, “Thanks Benny, for being here.”
Dean walked over to the motel table, sitting himself in one of the chairs, “Can you help fill in some of the blanks? I think Sam told me some bits but to be honest, I don’t remember anything he said.”
“He sleeps a lot,” Dean remarked, his brow furrowed in disappointment. He hadn’t realised how little time he would be able to spend with Sam when he first arrived.
Donna had been the one to introduce Castiel to the rest of the police force: Garth, who was the second newest face in the department; Alex, Jody’s adopted daughter; Mick, the IT worker who lived in his den of computers on the lower floor, and Ketch. Despite taking a liking to most of the team, Castiel felt a sense of unease when alone with Ketch. Donna had said nothing negative towards the British officer, but the way he glared at anyone who walked past, or the determined walk to wherever his destination was, seemed to unsettle Castiel. He hadn’t engaged in a conversation with him yet, briskly moving out of his path to avoid interaction.
She nodded, heading towards the bar. Dean handed Benny over a five dollar bill, forcing it into his hand when he rejected it, “Take the fucking money, Benny.”
Castiel stopped in front of his apartment complex, nodding politely at the groundkeeper before entering the main lobby. From down the hall, he could hear the energetic ring of Charlie’s voice, causing him to turn around. She was on the phone to someone, fumbling with her keys in her hands whilst propping her phone against her ear using her shoulder. Noticing Castiel, she waved excitedly, continuing to squeal into the phone as she managed to unlock her door and slip inside. The police officer smiled, walking up the three flights of stairs and approaching his front door.
Castiel watched from the table as Dean headed towards the main door, his shoulders tensing as he spoke on the phone, “Who’s he talking to?”
“He’s funny, Momma,” Gabriel remarked, pulling a piece of wrapped candy from his pocket and offering it to Dean, “Here.”
Castiel didn’t realise how drastic the move from New York would be. After his breakup with Balthazar, he couldn’t stand walking down the same streets he once had with his ex, seeing the places that they had visited as a couple before the man had broken his heart. Of course, his brother, Gabriel, had been supportive and understanding towards Castiel’s departure, promising to visit his younger brother as often as his work would allow him. Gabriel had been the one who suggested moving to Lawrence – far enough away and a change in scenery so that Castiel could start anew.
When your best friend is Charlie Bradbury, of course she is going to force you to meet the new officer again, Dean learnt.
Dean had to pinch his nose to stop the suffocating smell of alcohol burning his nostrils, pretending to be wiping at his face to cover it, “We met the new neighbours! They have two boys and they’re both really cool!”
“Right, okay,” Dean cleared his throat, looking around the room, “So if you saved me from hell, what are you?”
“What? No, it’s fine, Cas,” Sam reassured, reaching into his pocket to pull out a tissue to dab at his head wound, “It was important that someone was with Dean, otherwise he would’ve roamed off and we wouldn’t have been able to save him.”
The news that a family was moving into the abandoned house at the end of the street had been no secret to the locals. The arrival of a moving van and a beige Lincoln Continental only served to confirm the announcement, both parked in front of the battered home. In the peak of its time, the house had been a pearl white shade, with the window frames painted a glossed black that would glimmer in the sunlight. The garden had once blossomed with an array of flowers that had been tenderly nurtured by the inhabitants, attracting the attention of passer-bys and any stranger who drove along the street on the way out of town. It had once been the most attractive house on the street, but after the passing of its latest resident last year, it had been neglected and rundown.
“Everyone hangs out at The Roadhouse at some point, Dean. He must go there with the other officers, especially if he’s close with Donna.”
“We are definitely meeting up on Friday – no excuses from either of you,” Charlie announced, hugging Castiel awkwardly from the side, “It was really nice getting to meet you. It would have been nicer to meet you when the others did too, but that’s what I get for not being a firefighter.”
“Then what do you do for a living?” Castiel had assumed that Charlie was a colleague of Dean and Benny’s, never thinking that she might be in a different occupation.
The main door to the bar opened, Donna pushing against it and a hesistant Castiel walking behind her. Charlie softly kicked the two men opposite her, nodding her head to the direction of the door, “He’s here.”
The policeman turned to look at Benny, giving him a look-over before reaching his hand out, “I’m Castiel.”
“This was truly delicious,” Naomi commented, patting the corner of her mouth with a napkin. Chuck nodded in agreement, finishing the last mouthful of meat and placing his cutlery neatly on the empty plate.
Sam squealed, pointing over to where Dean and Castiel were standing by the dining table. Castiel was holding the card Dean had made him, his brows furrowed as he concentrated on reading. Dean, beside him, was reddening in the face, fidgeting with his fingers as he waited for Castiel to finish.
When Dean would disappear for hours on-end, Sam didn’t worry about where he was. If his brother didn’t respond to his calls, Sam wouldn’t worry. If Dean wasn’t at the bunker, he was there.
“He was the most awkward person I’ve ever met, and I hated his guts when we first got to know each other,” Dean smiled to himself, tilting his head up so he could look at the leaves of the oak tree above him, “But he was also one of the most caring and self-sacrificing sons-of-a that I’ve ever met too.”
“Benny,” He took his hand, giving it a firm shake before grabbing his beer bottle. Jo waited by the edge of the table, balancing her serving tray on her hip, “Can I get you any more drinks?”
“I’m four and three quarters!” Dean said proudly, pushing his chest out, “Sammy is almost six months old.”
Mary clapped her hands together, getting her son’s attention, “Right, I think it’s probably time for us to head back. We left baby Sam at home and he’ll need feeding soon.”
“I work at the fire station, just more as a secretary / assistant to Captain Bobby. They don’t trust me near the hoses after I knocked Ash out with the jet one time.”
“Yeah, that’s true,” The man smirked, “And you also tried to get someone out of a burning car without proper protection.”
Rowena looked at the angel, nodding for them to leave the brothers to have a moment. Cas turned on his heel, internally disappointed in the fact that Dean hadn’t made any move towards him, being solely focused on his brother.
“What the hell is a glyph?” Dean asked, casually strolling up to another one, but not daring to touch it.
John peeked his head around the corner of the doorway, smiling as he saw his sleeping family. He returned his attention back to the kitchen, picking up a chilled bottle of beer from the fridge and downing it, continuing his evening drinking.
This justification hadn’t stopped the older Winchester, who was continuing his search to find a way to bring back his angel. Days would turn to weeks of research, weeks of deadends would turn to months of hopeless searching. But Dean wouldn’t stop looking. Not when he knew that his angel was still in that place.
“Goodnight Donna,” Castiel replied, leaving the bar through the main doors. He began his walk back to the apartment, which he had calculated was a ten minute stroll. As he walked along the sidewalk, he couldn’t stop his mind worrying over his new companion. If all of his friends knew that John was bad, why was Dean still with him? Nobody had told him what the relation was - Castiel could only assume it was familial.
“Dean, this is Sam, remember?” Cas reassured, noticing how Sam had stumbled back in shock. It was clear that the younger Winchester hadn’t expected Dean’s state to be this bad.
“Something I should have done years ago,” He replied, walking determinedly towards his angel. Castiel was still perched at the front of the beige car, quickly looking down at the ground to pretend he wasn’t trying to listen in. He glanced up as he heard Dean get closer, “How are you feeling Dean?”
Castiel had immediately warmed to the city of Lawrence, taking in the new atmosphere like a breath of fresh air. Whilst he had only been in the city police force for just under two weeks, there was an instant bonding with his fellow colleagues, who had eagerly welcomed him with open arms. Captain Jody Mills ensured that the raven-haired man knew his surroundings, especially making sure that Castiel knew where the break room was. She had also provided Castiel with a mentor: the cheery, blonde officer Donna. At first, Donna’s constant mothering towards the newcomer had been intimidating, her hands always full with bakery goods or cups of coffee, but Castiel had adjusted to the friendly woman, growing very fond of her loving nature.
“Sam, I said don’t!” Dean yelled, standing up from the bed and storming into the bathroom. Sam sighed, rubbing his face again with his hand. He pulled out his phone from the side pocket of the duffel bag, dialing the fourth number on his phone.
“Once we are all moved in and unpacked, I’m sure we could arrange for that,” Naomi replied, her lips still pierced in a petite smile.
“So he won’t be here to meet Castiel?” Dean lowered his head in disappointment, blinking furiously to stop any tears forming in his eyes. When he glanced back up, Mary was crouched in front of him, cupping his cheeks, “Don’t be upset, sweetie. There’ll be plenty of times for your father to meet your new friend.”
“Castiel isn’t dead, per se. The Empty took him - he isn’t in a physical state that I can return to Earth, nor is he in a spiritual form for me to reconstruct into a human. And even if that were possible, the Empty and I aren’t necessarily on negotiating terms at the moment.”
Chuck headed towards the door first, his children and wife following closely behind. Mary and Dean waited by the front door, waving as the new neighbours began walking away.
Dean had never said anything out loud, but Sam knew first-hand the type of grief his brother had gone through when Cas was taken by the Empty. It wasn’t the grief that they’d experienced when Mary died, nor was it the pain of losing Bobby back in that hospital. It wasn’t the grief of losing a brother, or any other kind of relative. It was the grief of losing a -
Mary gazed down at her boy sympathetically, giving his shoulder another comforting squeeze, “Well there’ll be another time, don’t worry sweetie.”
Mary perched herself on the edge of the bed, running her hand through his short hair, “Maybe, or maybe Castiel will find someone else to be his friend too. You don’t have to have everything the same as him.”
Cas felt his heart skip a beat. Did Dean actually mean it? He would want that? Maybe with him? The angel glanced over at the door, his lips curling in a gentle smile. He hadn’t heard any communication from Rowena or Sam for a while. Hopefully they were almost done, so that Dean would be saved.
