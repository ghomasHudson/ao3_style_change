[Crack/tenuous theory: when Sherlock asks John if he is the king of England in s3, in the drunk knee grope scene, this shows that his brain’s control over his emotions have slipped; references to the queen in relation to Mycroft before have shown that Sherlock does know about the royal family, so this has to metaphorically refer to his own psyche and letting go of his brain’s anti-emotion side. Like I say, crack. But I believe it.]
“We’ve imposed ourselves on you for far too long already. I know that. But a couple more months – give Rosie her first Christmas here, that sort of thing – if you can’t, don’t worry. Really. We’ll be fine. There’s plenty of money. Mary, you know. I just thought I’d ask.”
). However, what’s important here is that Sherlock has got it wrong. He’s currently trying to work out why what has just happened with Mary poses so much danger, and he’s imagining Mary as the worst threat he possibly could – in a word, this Mary is a supervillain. But Mary is not a supervillain; he’s got this all wrong, and even as he says it, it’s completely ridiculous. This is not the danger Mary poses – and so out the door the client goes, and we’re back to square one, trying to work out exactly why John is in so much danger.
“Not at all. If it’s state, it’s just based on your catchment area. So this is the one for Baker Street.”
normally tie together so nicely, this is a section which has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the plot other than to look a bit silly. But fundamentally, we’re talking about the superfluity of style and image here; we’ve been talking about it for a long time in relation to previous adaptations, but TST brings it in in relation to
Don’t mind me, I’m just crying. Basically, Sherlock knows that John is in danger and that’s what pulls him back from the brink – and we know it’s serious, because Mycroft, the
Mrs. Hudson, knowing his annual ineptitude, had already dropped some less than subtle hints about slippers to him; she had dropped no such hints to John, suggesting that she trusted his ability to buy presents far better than Sherlock’s. Sherlock could not blame her. That would be her sorted. He would take his parents to the theatre when they came up on Christmas Eve. He doubted Mycroft would want anything. That only left John and Rosie.
, a British soap, and already on the wrong side of America for Freddie Mercury’s unapologetic queerness, found themselves under fire from the American censors. Brian May says that no matter how many times he tried to explain
A table that also seems to have a cup of tea on it, which represents queer desire. This is the reason he can’t let it go, although his subconscious is still talking to him in symbols. Another important aesthetic is Mycroft looking at the 13
“Yes!” Rosie replied excitedly. Her vocabulary had been slowly but surely expanding since her first word came, but not quite enough to declare what she wanted for Christmas. Father Christmas gave a great ho ho ho, that John didn’t think was entirely feigned. “Well, I’m sure your daddies will do their very best to get you that, whatever it is.”
We should also note that amo is a verb – amor is the Latin word for love. ‘Amo’ actually means ‘I love’ – we know that Sherlock knows this, because he conjugates the verb earlier in the episode: amo, amas, amat. My understanding is that it is the first verb anyone learns to conjugate in Latin classes, and that therefore Mofftiss hoped their audience might have some familiarity (rather than picking a much less taught language). ‘I love’ is not the same as ‘love’ – it is an action, and that’s something that Sherlock hasn’t quite cottoned on to. He keeps saying ‘love’ but refuses to grasp that he has to be involved in this verb – as we’ll see.
So much has been said, so eloquently, about the tarmac scene, that I don’t know that there’s much more that I can say. The importance of the plane as being Sherlock going to his death is really important as an image that will repeat later – again, see previous chapter
) to navigate the whole inside of 221B, and I suggest you do; it’s a fantastic resource. The mirror showing the green wall is simply wrong – the angle that this is shot from suggests that we should see the black and white wallpaper, complete with skull etc. Instead, we see the green wall – and the door. We can tell this is wrong because in the ‘wrong thumb’ case about thirty seconds later, the right wallpaper is reflected in the mirror. Another note of fuckiness that we should spot is that Sherlock seems to be taking his cases from letters, in the mail he has knifed into the mantelpiece – this show has been really keen on emphasising that he uses email for the last three series, so the implication that people are sending him letters is even odder than it would be in a modern show anyway.
Yet he could not live with this horribly pregnant silence weighing down 221B, and so when John returned from the clinic, Sherlock sidled up to him and placed a miniature chocolate Christmas king in front of him. They had been selling them in Speedy’s when Sherlock had gone down for a watery coffee, and he had bought it on an impulse.
I’ll (ideally) be uploading a chapter a day for the next 13 days. Some of these chapters will contain links to later chapters; if that chapter isn’t uploaded yet, I’ll add in the link retrospectively, so that might be why the links don’t all work on first read. With chapters that have an episode in parentheses beside, I strongly recommend either watching the episode before reading the meta, or even better to do a simultaneous read and watch through with your finger on the pause button. The only episode which doesn’t do a play by play is TLD ½ , purely for time reasons (my college term starts very soon and I really needed this meta put to bed for the sake of my degree!). The other thing worth saying is that if you want this meta as a word document for some reason, drop me a message – I’m more than happy to share it that way as well. It is a cool 50k so takes some reading. This chapter has been a bit of a nothing, but I hope it lays the groundwork for what to expect from the next 12 – I’ll see you over the next 12 days!
Sherlock’s subconscious even trying to break through Mary is important as she refers to the ghosts of her past – this is a phrase which keeps cropping up from TAB all the way through series 4, but it’s normally used in reference to Sherlock himself. She’s again voicing a motif from the programme that as Mary she can’t possibly know about, but as Sherlock’s subconscious is trying to push Sherlock back on the right track.
It is difficult, though, to buy a present for the person that you love. Sherlock remembered their Christmas party of 2011, when Molly Hooper had bought him a gift. How to tell someone you love them without scaring them off, to thank them without embarrassing them or driving a wedge between you, to ask for nothing in return? All that Sherlock wanted to express was somehow inexpressible – and if he did have the language, he was not sure that he wanted to use it. He could not help but feel that it was the one surefire way to drive John and Rosie away from him quicker than they were already inevitably going.
“Well I can’t get you nothing – just give me a clue, for God’s sake, there’s not much time before the shops all close.”
In my reading, EMP theory begins once Mary shoots Sherlock in HLV – I’ve linked the reasons for this in Chapter 1
. Magnussen picking at Sherlock’s food has often been seen as a metaphor for Sherlock being sexually assaulted whilst comatose, which is something I buy into – the food=sex metaphor has been striking from the beginning, and it suits Magnussen’s power play. It’s also quite possible in this scene that Sherlock thinks that everything fucky is real, and the absolute fuckiness of this scene draws it out – this is the scene that foreshadows the realisation that Magnussen is working from his MP, and of course that’s a realisation that Sherlock needs to make himself. The scene opens with a moment of dislocation – is this the hospital canteen or not? – and is about Sherlock working out what’s happening to him.
“Rosie needs stability. And I need… I don’t know what I need. And I know we’ve imposed ourselves on you for too long.”
This Christmas was their Christmas, theirs alone to share. And Rosie, of course. Rosie did not seem to notice the difference in the way her fathers behaved around each other. Perhaps she had always sensed their love, a primal infantile understanding that both of them wished they had a long time ago. Nevertheless, they knew now.
This doesn’t diminish the trauma that Sherlock experiences – one of the things I begrudgingly like about the ending of TFP. Sherlock can’t get rid of the problem and possible danger that is his trauma – but he can stop it from careering to the point of destruction by recognising it, he can learn to live in harmony (see the violin duet) with it, he can accept its existence.  Pushing through that trauma is what makes him able to abandon the plane and (we hope) return to the real world.
are the right things. The fact that Toby reaches a dead end here is important – he’s a weird loose end to have hanging through the episode. When things in
This is my reasoning as to why MP!Eurus represents Sherlock’s innermost trauma. She is not merely the fact that he loves John – he deduced this in TSoT without her appearance. She is the trauma that he needs to come to terms with. A running theme through our analysis of Eurus will be that her gender is particularly important; her representation of Sherlock’s repression cannot be but as a woman, because for most of s4 he is only able to process his identity through the most heterosexual of lenses. We see this hinted at quite early on in TST, when Sherlock takes on a case called ‘The Duplicate Man’, warning John that it is never twins. The word ‘duplicate’ here, removing twins, leaves us with the only real possibility that it is in fact the same person. Eurus’s gender makes that more difficult to see; she needs to be female, but it’s much more difficult to elide the two characters without employing a Cumberbatch doppelganger. However, this hint that Eurus is not only male but an actual ‘duplicate’ of her brother should give us pause for thought. With this in mind, I want to use the rest of this chapter to analyse her three forms before TFP.
There’s something that I really don’t understand here, though, which I think is important – Sherlock drugging the family with the help of Wiggins. This motif of drugging is something which comes back time and again to represent Sherlock’s repression – but here he’s not drugged. Wiggins is also a symbol of repression, but again he’s completely sober. Any thoughts on this would be much appreciated – I don’t like loose ends, and I don’t believe that another use of drugs is insignificant!
The next transition is fantastic. We see two reflections of Mycroft listing off another meaning of Agra (an Indian city) whilst seemingly looking at each other. The reflections are distorted to be thinner than normal, again pointing to the dreamscape we’re used to by now, but also telling us that Mycroft’s voice is Sherlock’s brain here, reflecting – this is the equivalent of going into his mind palace to work something out, drawing on memories and existing knowledge. However, remember that in real life the memory stick does not exist. So why is Sherlock so keen on deciphering AGRA? Well, the treasure of Agra features in The Sign of the Four, in which Holmes is trying to regain the treasures for Mary but does not (as mentioned before, the Agra box is empty) – but the actual important development is that Watson and Mary become engaged. Agra here is not about the memory stick, much like ammo isn’t about ammunition; it’s a tool for Sherlock to engage with Mary’s past. However, Mycroft referencing the original Agra here suggests that Sherlock is trying to grapple with Mary’s potentially criminal past, and also that he can’t get past who she was supposed to be, as we’ve already seen from HLV (she wasn’t supposed to be like that!). However, it’s also a sign that he’s missing the most important part of The Sign of the Four, which is all the more notable for its importance because the wedding episode is named for it; John’s relationship with Mary is the real occurrence in that story.
shows self-awareness from within the narrative that there are extranarrative stories being played out. I’ve said before that I don’t think Thatcher and Napoleon are a good comparison; whether it is or not, Craig’s reference is actively pulling a metatextual part of Sherlock’s history into his story and forcing him to reckon with it. This is important, because he develops expectations of how this story is going to play out (black pearl of the Borgias) which are wrong – because they’re based on what he has learned to expect of himself as fictional character. We could only have such a reference within the Mind Palace.
bears a particular relevance to Mary – and links her to Moriarty as his potential second-in-command. The most important link, however, is that in
And yet, for weeks he had been searching property websites, ignoring the gnawing feeling in his stomach that leaving was wrong. It was only that day, the 3rd of December, when the icy wind blew through the shoddy windows of 221B and John wrapped the blanket closer around his shoulders, that he realised that, home in Baker Street, he had never once complained about the cold.
“If you’ve found somewhere, please don’t worry about me. Rosie should be somewhere stable.” His voice, always gravelly, had a forced quality, the deep vibrations masking his tremulousness. He still did not turn around, did not look at John.
, which only takes place in ACD canon, but even if you think that link is tenuous, he’s also engaged with his canon future as a beekeeper in Sussex. And then, on top of this, there is the problem of Mary versus the housemaid from
John laughed drily. “You’re still young – I’ve saddled you with a brooding middle-aged man and a baby. I assumed that you would take us in – I didn’t even think about you. It wasn’t fair.” He took a deep intake of breath and continued. “So I’ve been looking at flats, and I think I’ve found somewhere that will work. I’ll be out of your hair by the new year.”
John gestured him into the main room, and as he settled into his armchair Sherlock sat awkwardly on his. He could feel a spike of upset rising in his throat and swallowed it down uncomfortably. He eyed John. His jaw was tense, his hand jerking slightly as it always did when he was nervous. Sherlock’s throat constricted slightly. These were signs he did not like to read.
Sherlock had always thought of Christmas as a meretricious festivity for those whose minds were subject to the inanity of ritual and incapable of logical analysis. Yet, this time around, he had to admit Molly was right. Singing Christmas songs with Rosie earlier, when he had thought Sherlock wasn’t looking, there had been a twinkle in John’s eye. Twinkles were unverifiable, to be sure, and it might just have been the light of the fire glinting in John’s vision, but despite never having seen such a twinkle before Sherlock would have sworn by it. And with it came a fleeting thought:
“He doesn’t want you to leave, you know. I don’t want to get involved – I know this flat is pretty small for three, and Rosie will be needing her own room before you know it – but don’t underestimate how much he cares for you, John. Go easy on him. It’s not an easy Christmas for him.”
And then he pulled away, and Sherlock released a breath he had not known he was holding. He turned furiously away from John, determined to hide the flush that he could feel rising in his cheeks, quickly placing a building block in Rosie’s hands. “Here, Rosie. Aren’t you clever?”
“Advent calendars? Though I suppose Rosie is a bit young for them… she might choke on the chocolate. You can get ones with pictures in them, sheep, three wise men, that sort of thing. Although it’s the eighth already, I don’t suppose she’d mind.”
“You probably did,” John reasoned. “You just worked him out when you were three or something, and so you don’t remember.”
Basil Rathbone is one of the most iconic Sherlock Holmes actors on film, and Benedict’s costume in TAB and in particular the big overcoat look are very reminiscent of Rathbone.
Ajay’s torture is another way of teasing Amo and the English woman, which will come to fruition later in the episode, so we’ll move through to Sherlock’s meeting with Mary. Mary, at this point, is still just Mary, no mirrors, no nothing, as Sherlock tries to work her out. Notice how he acknowledges that he had been too caught up in Moriarty and the pearl. I also think it’s relevant that the building in which Mary chloroforms (camphors?) Sherlock is a church – this is a subconscious reference to the Sherlock-is-murdered metaphor in TSoT (
It’s possible that the Appledore Vaults being Magnussen’s MP is the first time that Sherlock recognises that this is a simulation, and that this isn’t real. He certainly looks incredibly distressed, although that could also be because of the immense danger he’s put John in. However, the vaults being a mind palace doesn’t make sense as surface plot, as so many have pointed out – we’ve literally seen the letters before. (I grant that Magnussen could be bluffing, but it seems odd to draw attention to the letters having a physical form nevertheless.) However, the fact that Magnussen’s MP is in vaults underground is really interesting – imagery to do with going deeper and deeper into Sherlock’s mind is pretty much always falling or sinking, as seen in both TAB and TST in particular. That idea of descending into one’s mind is prefigured very neatly here, and should get us thinking about height generally (I’ve talked about the reverse side of this in the previous chapter
One thing that several meta-writers have pointed out is that Ella’s office is… fucky. It’s not the same office as John repeatedly visits outside the MP – it’s possible that Ella has moved premises, but it’s a weird thing to draw such obvious attention to by the weirdness of the room. This isn’t a subtle change, like John and Mary’s place, it’s a really dissonant one, and the oddness of the room pulls our attention towards a character and space that by rights belong in the background of the story. It’s a really odd move – and that’s why I’m so convinced that it’s important.
Do you get it? She’s his sister? But metaphorically, she’s a part of his soul? I was very impressed with myself for
about how water represents Sherlock sinking deeper and deeper into his own subconsciousness – this is the deepest he can go. In Greek mythology, Eurus was the name of the wind most associated with causing storms at sea
“So ask him to stay. Talk to him. Tell him how you feel – however that is. You’re an adult now, Sherlock – yearning after a problem won’t solve it.”
We remember from TAB that Sherlock sees himself as cleverer through John’s eyes, and the reasonably sympathetic portrayal we get in TAB we can probably put down to this attempt at understanding himself from the outside. The water in TST is showing us that we’re going in, and the sad thing is that this is almost definitely how Sherlock has come to perceive himself, but just like Siri he doesn’t truly recognise it. It’s also worth noting here the emphasis placed on God in godfather and later the deliberate mentions of Christianity at the Christening – there is also a tuning out of a culture he can’t really align himself with here, which is more important when we think about the fact that this character has been around since the 19
John’s eyes locked on Sherlock’s on the other side of the room as Stamford spoke. Sherlock broke the eye contact as quickly as John had made it, and John felt something shatter in his heart. To love, indeed. There would be no more Christmases like this, he felt sure. He gave Rosie a rub as she hiccoughed on the warm milk that John had infused with cinnamon for her. Her first Christmas. He should not be so melancholy, but he could not help it.
That evening, John had the newspaper open and was avoiding conversation. Sherlock knew that there was no real interest in the paper; it was this morning’s, and anything interesting in it would have reached John via his phone, which would have provided him with up to date headlines throughout the day. One of the odd things about the internet age was that the day’s newspaper was defunct almost as soon as it was printed. But still it was a refuge for John when he needed some peace, and Sherlock bit his tongue and refrained from commenting on it. It was a level of tact he would not have believed he possessed before Mary’s death; but then, people change.
. I’ve also pointed out that there is no point at which Sherlock is told Moriarty is back, yet he seems to know it automatically – another suggestion that this is EMP, and there’s a lot more going on.
), but I want to reiterate the basic framework, because it still makes a lot of sense. Jim represents the fear of John’s suicide, and Jim can only be defeated by Sherlock and John together, not one alone – and crucially, calling each other by first names, which would have been very intimate in the Victorian era. After Jim is “killed”, we have Sherlock’s fall. The concept of a fall (as in IOU a fall) has long been linked with falling in love in tjlc. Sherlock tells John that it’s not the fall that kills you, it’s the landing, something that Jim has been suggesting to him for a while. What is the landing, then? Well, Sherlock Holmes fell in love back in the Victorian era, symbolised by the ultra repressive 1895, and that’s where he jumps from – but he
This room is lit warmly, quite the opposite to the dark watery colours that we see inside most of this episode – most of the waters take place in Sherlock’s brain, and are epitomised by Mycroft’s office, whereas this scene is warm, the colours one might expect of hearth and home, as heart!John takes precedence for the first time. However, notice the grating and the pattern of light that spreads itself softly over the characters’ clothing – it’s much less obvious than in Mycroft’s office, but it’s still the same chequered pattern. As we move in to TFP and John and Mycroft are tied together, rather than moving apart, we’re going to see that increasingly they are two sides of the same coin, heart and brain. You’ll notice, though, that Mycroft’s grating pattern is more like a chessboard – it’s binary and simplistic, black squares and empty space for white light. The patterns of light in this scene, particularly as we move into the Ajay confrontation, become more complicated – the light is let through in swirls as well as grates, as though heart!John is allowing for much more complexity than brain!Mycroft – which seems to be right, given how much more difficult Sherlock finds Happy Families than chess.
I don’t think the importance of Molly in particular here has been mentioned before, but forgive me if I’m retreading old ground. However, Molly always has importance in
– twice, it mentions the elephant in the room, and so I feel I have to do the same. The first time, you could blink and miss it – the Doctor calls pregnant Amy ‘elephanty’. But the second time, we get this exchange:
Rosie was fast asleep in John’s arms, breathing lightly, and as Judy Garland crooned out a Christmas tune to the child in her arms, Sherlock leant over to brush the soft blonde hairs on Rosie’s head with his thumb. John had never seen him behave with such tenderness. Sherlock’s hand brushed gently over his where he was cradling Rosie’s head, his ridged, calloused fingers from years of playing the violin touching on John’s smoother fingers.
He did not want Rosie to think that he had not loved her mother, because he had. The feelings he had for Mary would never evaporate; he knew that, but he also knew that he had found something bigger, a love that threatened to envelop him and upend everything he thought he knew about himself. He knew he had to tell Sherlock, but it didn’t feel right somehow without her permission. Saying it aloud still felt like an infidelity. He had loved them simultaneously, after all. How could she forgive him that?
He put the textbook down instantly. To someone who didn’t know him, there would have been nothing wrong with John; the change was so small as to be imperceptible. Yet the slight quaver to his tone, the tremor that had been absent these last weeks creeping back into his hand; these were signs Sherlock had been preparing himself for, signs he had been fearing when John first lost Mary. He had not expected them to appear now, just when John seemed to be recovering from his grief.
is not the first to point out that Sherlock almost definitely deduces his own feelings for John in TSoT, in a case of the worst timing in television history. Instead, much like Wilder’s Holmes, I think our Sherlock is dealing with a huge amount of shame and internalised homophobia, which has metafictionally* been building up since Conan Doyle started writing – hence the trip back to 1895 in TAB. S4 is about breaking through over a century of Holmes adaptations which have formed Sherlock’s own version of himself, so that he can break out of them into a ‘Private Life’ outside of established canon.
That’s it for TAB, at least in this series – next up we’re going ever deeper, to find out exactly who is Eurus. See you then?
Next up: Craig and his dog. Nothing can be said about dogs that hasn’t be said in these wonderful metas by @sagestreet (
Water tells us we’re sinking deep into Sherlock’s mind, as discussed in a previous chapter. Water imagery is going to be hugely prevalent in TST, but I want to talk quickly about the subtle hints at water even when we’re not in a giant fuck-off aquarium. Take a look at the rattle scene (which always sparks joy). When we get a side angle that shows both Sherlock and Rosie, there’s a black chest of some description behind Rosie – the top is glowing slightly blue, for reasons I can’t fathom. Then we’re going to cut to a shot of Rosie – despite seeing only a second before that there is nothing on her head, there is a glow of blue on it that looks almost like a skullcap. Cut back to Sherlock getting a rattle in the face, and the mirror is glowing the same blue colour behind him. This is all fucky, and it’s a fuckiness which is aesthetically tied to the waters of Sherlock’s mind perfectly. It suggests that Rosie isn’t real, but more important is the mirror. Earlier on I pointed out how the mirror was showing the wrong reflection; here, the mirror is glowing blue, linking it thematically to Sherlock’s subconsciousness. Visually, we’re being hinted at the process of self-reflection that’s going on in Sherlock’s brain – and the opening of TST is showing him getting it terribly wrong. Note that when the mirror jolted right earlier, Sherlock was proclaiming that it had been the wrong thumb – god knows what thumbs have to do with this, but there’s a question of shifting perception on his person, like he’s trying to locate himself.
), but let’s remember the initial mention of it. It was heart!John who spoke those words, not real!John – because we never get real!John in this series, except through Sherlock’s memory – and so his interrogation of Sherlock’s hypothesis of Mary is where he starts to realise that the problem is one of happy families rather than chess, and that it’s a lot more emotionally complicated than the supervillain arc gives credit for. It’s important that we’re told this story in reverse, because Sherlock is slowly picking up the clues for it but only putting it together late. We’ve seen all the signs that John might be unhappy but haven’t elaborated on them – now Sherlock’s mind is noticing that the Mary problem is something to do with John’s emotions. He can’t work out what, so he hypothesises – this meta chapter (
This chapter has a CN for death (although to be fair, the whole meta does) – it’s analysing the literal peaks and troughs (height is important in this episode) that Sherlock goes through in order to look at how close he is to dying throughout.
Sherlock describes predestination as like a spider’s web and like mathematics – both of these are to do with Moriarty. In the original stories, Moriarty is a mathematician, and one of the most famous lines from both the stories and the show describes Moriarty as a spider. This predestined future is one that Sherlock doesn’t like – Mycroft points out that predestination ends in death, which is what Sherlock is trying to avoid in this episode, and although Moriarty is never mentioned explicitly, his inflection here suggests that Sherlock is thinking about John subconsciously, without even understanding it. The Samarra discussion brings us back to the question of Sherlock’s death, and links it in with the deep waters of the mind he’s currently drowning in – the pirate imagery becomes really important here, because a pirate is someone who stays alive on the high seas and fights against them. The merchant of Samarra becoming a pirate is not merely a joke about a little boy, it’s a point about fighting for survival – and how will Sherlock later fight for survival? We’ll see him battle Eurus (his trauma, more on that later) head on, literally describing himself as a pirate. Fantastic stuff.
). I can’t make these points better than she has, nor can I take credit for them. I’m particularly invested in her description of the aquarium and the Samarra story, as well as the client cases that appear and aren’t updated on John’s blog. Our reading will diverge later on – I think this series is a lot more metaphorical than it is hypothesis-testing, although the latter is a notable feature of ACD canon (see the original THotB) that definitely does happen here as well. I’m going to leave the Samarra story, the aquarium and the cases for LSiT to explain, however, and move on.
Yet the panic continued to rise in his chest as his stomach sank lower and lower. If he loved Sherlock, what did that mean for Rosie? In his wildest dreams, dreams of Baker Street until their creaking bodies could no longer stand the London air, would he raise his daughter in the lifestyle of a detective? Would her uncle be the British government? Would she feel her father had abandoned her mother – would she think of her mother at all? Or would she resent her father – her other father – for taking her place?
This chapter has been a long one, but I hoped it help to set up EMP theory on firm foundations. We’ll move into TAB next – see you there!
being one of Wilde’s plays. But the Vincent Starrett poem, although nostalgic and ostensibly lovely, for tjlcers and it seems for Sherlock himself symbolises something much more troubling. Do search up the full poem, but for now let’s look at the final couplet.
. And, canonically, he’s right. If we follow acd!canon, Mary is not meant to be an assassin, but more importantly for HLV, she’s also supposed to save her husband. She’s meant to be all-out devoted shoot-Magnussen type – but instead she shoots Sherlock. When John says that, then, it’s not just a nod to an updated show – it’s a genuine problem that Sherlock has to contend with, because in neither acd!Mary scenario nor housemaid!Mary scenario is she obeying the framework of a woman who loves her husband. This failing marriage is not in the stories, it’s not supposed to happen, and things that come outside of established canon come outside of Sherlock’s pre-programmed mould – we can think of this as a way of thinking about our own childhood programming to be straight/cis/etc., but in a more self-conscious, literary way!
“See if you can get lights, decorations. Mrs. Hudson will probably have some spare if you ask nicely. Rosie will love it. There’s nothing quite so exciting,” said Molly. Her eyes were starting to glimmer with the excitement of Christmas; she had always been a romantic, Sherlock reminded himself. That was why he had come to ask her, after all.
To understand what’s going on in HLV, we’re going to need to understand the metafiction going on – and this is where a good knowledge of acd canon comes in. Most of HLV isn’t actually based on
Advent calendar. Yes, he had had one as a child. Mycroft and he used to try to deduce what was behind each window. He made a mental note.
John leant over Sherlock’s shoulder, gently resting on the arm of his chair. “You do wind people up.”
He thought back to the Christmas decorations he had placed around the flat the previous afternoon. In the glow of the fire, the room had seemed like a home for the first time in many years, lit up not only by the wintery flames but by John’s laughter, the first time he had laughed in months. The decorations felt premature now, thinking about the sombreness of the day. He hadn’t considered that.
When they were finally let through into Father Christmas’s grotto, however, Rosie was immediately awed into silence; the red crepe and blue lights were not much in John’s eyes, but he could still vaguely remember the excitement he had felt as a child in such places. This was Rosie’s first. He tried to fix her gobsmacked expression in his mind to keep forever, a souvenir of the day. He stole a side glance at Sherlock, suspecting he was doing the same. A shame he didn’t have a Mind Palace, really.
connection between the other characters that is important, like in TAB. The use of the word ‘always’ is really important here – it’s not saying that time travel is possible in dreams in the Whoniverse, but that it has always been possible. There’s an implication here that before time travel was invented, in a non science fiction world, dreams can still do this – and that’s what helps us to jump across to TAB.
The strange thing was, that in the last few months he had been thinking less and less about Mary. There was a strange guilt that now accompanied her image in his head, as he was aware of how inattentive a widower he had been. Part of that was Rosie, of course; there was simply no time to grieve when one had a screaming baby to deal with twenty four seven. And yet it was more than that. In the early days, John had been wracked by nightmares, plagued by hallucinations, unable to even look at his daughter, palming her straight off onto anyone who would take her, anyone who could help him forget his responsibilities, forget he existed. It was after two months of this that Mrs. Hudson of all people intervened and all but frogmarched him back to Baker Street.
But John did not leave; there was no footstep indicating he was going about any kind of business. Sherlock merely sat, eyes averted, every sense in his body prickling with shame.
“All you’re going to teach her is that her parents lie to her, John. Is that what you want her to grow up thinking about you? Or would you rather she feel that you trust her to be a mature adult?”
I know I was joking about Molly and John’s moustaches, but putting such a silly moustache on Molly links to the silliness of John’s moustaches, which only appear when he’s engaged to a woman and in the Victorian era. He has also grown the moustache just so the illustrator will recognise him, and Molly has grown her moustache so that she will be recognised as a man. In this case, Molly is here to demonstrate the fact that John is passing, but only ever passing. Furthermore, Molly, who is normally the kindest person in the whole show, is bitter and angry throughout TAB – it’s not difficult to see then how hiding one’s identity can affect one’s mental health. I really do think that John is a lot more abrasive in TAB than he is in the rest of the show, but that’s not the whole story. Showing how repression can completely impair one’s personality also points to the suicidal impulses that are lurking just out of sight throughout TAB – this is what Sherlock is terrified of, and again his brain is warning him just what it is that is causing John this much pain and uncharacteristic distress.
The next scene is, I think, very important. We come across Mycroft in a dark room with a tiny bit of light – this is really odd, as the obvious place to put Mycroft would be the Diogenes Club. Yet, although clearly more modern, this reminds me most of all of the room we meet Mycroft in in TAB.
parallel which sees him subconsciously making the link to Moriarty. ACDcanon!Moran, unlike bbc!Moran, was the last assassin sent after Sherlock from Moriarty’s network – this means that the dismantling-Moriarty's-network plot from the start of TEH becomes more than a fill-in-the-blanks montage, it means that the show retains its key villain to the end – it structurally
Between the time travel and Jenny, then, TNoTD is probably the best framework we get set up for TAB. This came out only a few months before s3, in which EMP began, so it’s safe to say that these ideas are well-formed in Mofftiss’s heads at this stage. However, if we jump all the way back to 2010 and
Skipping past more bust breakages, the next scene is John and Mary in bed together – and the first thing we see is them, once again, in a mirror. There’s nothing wrong with this mirror (as far as I can tell) – everything seems to be in order! But it doesn’t break the theme of mirrors misreflecting, because this is the scene that introduces unreliable narration on a big level – this is the scene which deliberately excludes John’s texts to E. John and Eurus are gone into in another chapter so we’ll move on again.
But instead, that morning, seeing John swaddle Rosie to protect her against the cold, the intimacy of that father and daughter moment, a panic had set in to the pit of his stomach and he had fumbled for an excuse. Some moments were too precious to be spoiled. And it was a time, after all, for Mary. He had all Christmas with them; and if John ever needed Sherlock, he must have known that he was always there.
Sherlock called back to John from his bedroom, already searching through his wardrobe for something suitably warm so he would not be reprimanded a second time. “It’s her first snow! And she has to see it when it’s soft and pure – before the roadsweepers get their machines on it, before the rush hour pedestrians turn it grey with their tread. It’s beautiful then too – differently beautiful. But it shouldn’t be her first time.” He rushed back out of his bedroom, fully clothed and wrapped up, euphoric, to see John wide-eyed and grinning right back at him, Rosie’s grin just visible beneath her woollen swaddling making a third.
When we first meet Eurus in TST, she calls herself E; this initialism is a link to Moriarty, but it’s also a convenient link to other ‘E’ names. Lots of people have already commented on the aural echo of ‘Eros’ in ‘Eurus’, which is undeniable; the idea that there is something sexual hidden inside her name chimes beautifully with her representation of a sexual repression. The other important character to begin with E, however, is Emelia Ricoletti. The name ‘Emelia’ doesn’t come from ACD canon, and it’s an unorthodox spelling (Amelia would be far more common), suggesting that starting with an ‘E’ is a considered choice.
He lay in bed a few moments longer, listening to John’s faint movements. For another few moments, however, he would bask in the moment that he knew would vanish the moment he arose.
Mary had liked Sherlock, he reminded himself. She had not come between them the way that every other girlfriend had; she had not competed for John’s attention. She had accepted that Sherlock was a part of John’s life and had become another. She had been sharp as a knife, able to respond to Sherlock’s barbed wit in a way that no one but Mycroft could. She had accompanied them on cases, hacked into networks with them, been a third chair at Baker Street even when John had long moved out. She and Sherlock had slotted together like siblings; yes, there had been friction, and one particularly low point which had marred their relationship, a moment which John could not forget. But if he were to move on, he thought, he could not think of anyone Mary would rather John moved on for.
wants Sherlock to get involved in that situation, although God knows why – the Janine-is-Jim's-sister theory feels like it might work here, but I don’t think there’s enough evidence for me to unravel it. If Janine genuinely does open the door out of affection for Sherlock, regardless of her relationship with Mary (the two aren’t mutually exclusive), Janine knowing Sherlock is gay doesn’t make sense
John passed Rosie over to Father Christmas, who placed her on his knee. “What do you want for Christmas, then, love?”
He wondered whether John had thought of any of this. After Mary had died, John had moved back in to Baker Street; it had taken a few weeks, but he had realised that he was unable to cope on his own. It had been a quiet move back in; they had not really discussed it, how long it would go on. Sherlock preferred it that way. Subdued and reticent though John was now, it meant that he could see these days with him as stretching ahead into infinity, although in his heart he understood that they would not. Rosie would grow, and would outgrow the room she shared with her father. They would move out and on whilst Sherlock stayed at Baker Street.
Sherlock stiffened. That serious, direct note in John’s voice was one that he dreaded. Their life at 221B for the last few months had not been easy, of course, but having John back had meant that that had not mattered. But Sherlock had lived without him before, and he was all too aware that their existence together was a bubble, one that could pop at any moment. That tone of voice was the tone he had been dreading; the tone that called time. But he had hoped, at least, for one Christmas.
“About that –“ John cut in, turning scarlet in the dim firelight. “It wasn’t – I didn’t mean to offend you –“
The next section on our whistle-stop tour is Christmas with Mummy and Daddy. Plenty of people have pointed out how Mummy and Daddy are very clear mirrors for our boys – you can see here
The December wind bit at them as they walked, and John could feel his nose redden in the bracing cold. The streets were quiet by the standards of central London, though perhaps this would have seemed busy elsewhere; nevertheless, as they turned a corner John could make out the sound of children shouting and laughing. Break time, he supposed. It must be a school. He had never noticed it before.
We’ve been through what Thatcher represents to queer people of Sherlock’s age, so there’s already a strong metaphor for homophobia being smashed there. However, let’s look at the AGRA memory stick being uncovered. We know (
The jibe about happy families is a little laboured, but it sets up the idea that Sherlock is starting to work in terms of relationships now rather than seeing things in terms of chess. Think of the chessboard squares in Mycroft’s office – but his deduction partner has now switched to John, who represents his heart, and so he’s starting to get on the right track. Note as well how we’re meant to assume they are playing chess or some equivalently cerebral game before we discover that they’re playing Happy Families; this is the same as the chess/Operation scene in TEH, in which we see the difficulty that the Holmes boys have in accessing their hearts. Now that Sherlock is using heart!John instead of brain!Mycroft, he’s almost there, but still not quite winning due to his unfamiliarity with the situation. Note also yet another distorting mirror in the background of this scene.
Despite the many hyperlogical explanations, John still managed to drag Sherlock to the nearest shopping centre to meet Santa with him and Rosie. The queue was not too long, largely because it was a Wednesday afternoon and all the older children were still in school. John reasoned that it was better this way; it really wasn’t fair to submit the parents of children who had just grown out of that stage to a whole host of screaming babies. This meant that the queue, although short, was tempestuous, and more than once John caught Sherlock gazing longingly at a pair of earmuffs in a winter display window.
At some point I want to do a drag in Sherlock meta, because I think there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye, but Jim in a bride’s dress does draw one obvious drag parallel for me.
What does this mean for Sherlock himself, bearing in mind that this is taking place in his Mind Palace? The answer is pretty grim – remember that Sherlock is metatextually grappling with his own identity at this point; he needs to discover the man he is, rather than is portrayed as, in order to get out of this alive. In a psychological sense, then, the opening of TST sees Sherlock deconstruct himself as seen from the outside, and as his psyche has traditionally perceived himself, and realise that that version of himself is hollow. This scene, then, is a rejection of the Sherlock of the public eye, as well as Sherlock’s own eyes.
However, if we want to go deeper we should look at where that quote comes from. I’ve given a few epigraphs to this section to show where the quote comes from – first the book of Ecclesiastes, then
- that such a deduction could equally be applied to himself. He’ll get there in the end (TLD), but right now, that’s what makes this scene so painful for me.
John was in a mood. Perhaps he had had a bad day at the surgery, but Sherlock suspected there was more to it. Rosie’s first Christmas, spent without her mother. John’s first spent without Mary. Sherlock could see this knowledge weighing on John in the increasing sag of his shoulders, the dullness in his eyes as he resigned himself to bereavement. Christmas can be a sad time, Mrs. Hudson had warned him as the season approached. Sherlock had nodded, but he had not fully comprehended. He had never lost someone in the way John had.
holds the top spot – it’s an unashamedly cryptic show all about solving mysteries through dreams, so no wonder I like it. It’s made by David Lynch, and in the TAB chapter I talk about how TAB takes a lot of structural inspiration from his most famous film,
as it seems on the surface, we would end up with a pretty straight reading of TST – John spends too much time with Sherlock, they’re all in danger, Mary dies and John is suicidal because of it. Broadly speaking, this works – Rory is killed in the dream (with a really nice visual parallel to TST) and Amy crashes a bus and kills herself because she doesn’t want to live without Rory. Amy picks the domestic sphere and although it takes several more series to play out in full, this is broadly the direction the series takes us in.
You’re not her father, he reminded himself. Nothing too large, too ostentatious. He was her godfather, of course, but then, when was the last time he had received something from his godfather? He had not seen Uncle Rudi in several years now. He did not want such an apathy to develop between him and Rosie. He knew that it was inevitable, of course; these few months, which had meant so much in his brain, would be forgotten by her. He would be an uncle who appeared less and less frequently as her and John’s lives got busier and busier, wherever they ended up living, and those few early months spent with him would be symbolic not of a happy home life but of her father’s mourning, his brokenness. These moments, the happiest in Sherlock’s life, would be nothing but a stopgap to her.
“To family!” Stamford was shouting, holding out his glass to clink with a slightly mortified Molly Hooper. Others were joining in with greater brio. “To friendship! To love! To many more years of Christmases and New Years spent with the ones we love!”
John looked up for the first time, and Sherlock was touched to see that his eyes were tinged with red. “What do you mean, no?”
We then find our first Thatcher case – others have been pretty quick to point out the significance of the blue power ranger in gay tv history (
“If you had read any of the multiple parenting books I have left lying around the flat for you to pick up, you wouldn’t try to pick her up.”
Later, when asked how he knew that the Dream Lord was him, the Doctor merely says that no one else hates him so much. Domestic!verse, then, is a manifestation of everything that the Doctor dreads – it’s his worst nightmare, being conjured by his subconscious. That nightmare involves Amy’s suicide, Rory’s death because the Doctor can’t protect them – this maps pretty neatly onto EMP theory and TST. Although John doesn’t kill himself, he is rendered suicidal in the domestic nightmare that is left behind. As the previous chapter discusses, Sherlock not being able to protect John is definitely a nightmare, but the nightmare also maps onto reality – John is suicidal, but he’s struggling to work out why, so he has to construct it through a heterosexual lens. John’s potential death and love for Mary are the two things that form the worst nightmare in both dreams, and the nightmarish sense is highlighted in TST by the deep waters metaphor.
(not as bad as it sounds!). This story is actually anti-racism, though you’d never tell from the title – it’s about a woman who isn’t allowed to see her mixed race child, and it concludes by reuniting them. The Norbury line comes at the end – Sherlock has seen the mysterious yellow face and overdeduced by a million to think that he’s solving a murder case, when all the disguise is is a woman trying to see her child. This is the same mistake Sherlock has made in his characterisation of his assassination attempt in the Norbury scene – he hasn’t been able to see past his role as consulting detective into the more important world of human relationships, which would have saved us an entire series of dreams for starters. It’s a really important moment in the Holmes canon, as it’s one of the only moments where we see behind the mask – much like
He turned away quickly. “Nothing,” he muttered. Heat rose in his face, a flush of shame at his obviousness, his weakness in wearing his heart on his sleeve, coming so close to betraying his feelings. He suspected – hoped – that John was too preoccupied to notice. He did not dare to look back to check.
A run through of the EMP in HLV - I would recommend having recently viewed HLV for this, or even watching it concurrently with a remote to stop it as it goes along!
John laughed, helping him to arrange the quilts to keep Rosie warm for her first Christmas film night. Suggested by Mrs. Hudson, of course, though she had double-booked her date with Mr. Chatterjee. She would approve of the film, John thought. Plus, it was a window into Sherlock’s childhood, and an amusing one at that; he enjoyed the thought of a teenage Sherlock and Mycroft rebelling against their parents’ choice of film. The thought of a teenage Mycroft alone was funny. “Come on then, it’s starting,” said John, flicking over to BBC2 as a young Judy Garland stepped out of a terribly quaint horse and carriage. “This had better be good.”
Sherlock stifled a smile as Rosie threw one of the blocks into John’s lap, landing squarely on him. Luckily the blocks were foam, and John smiled distractedly as he placed it back into her hands. “No throwing, sweetie.”
The elephant in the room – that the baby’s not real? Possibly, but not what we normally take it to mean. Rory’s ponytail also has not shaving for Sherlock Holmes vibes, but again it’s not quite concrete in my mind. These little bits at the end aren’t quite tied up, and I would love to hear what people have to say about them. That, however, is for another day! The next chapter in this series will be jumping back into episode-by-episode analysis with TLD – see you there.
Another similar moment comes when Sherlock says he knows exactly what Moriarty is going to do next – how? And, more to the point, it becomes hugely obvious that he doesn’t. Yet, for the first time in history, he feels happy to sit back and wait on Moriarty, because he knows that what will come will come. This insistence that the future will take its course as it needs to might draw our minds ahead to the frankly ridiculous reliance on predictions that we see in TLD – however, it should also draw our minds across to
Sherlock not knowing who Thatcher is – perfectly feasible and actually quite important, although something that I’m not going to resolve until my meta on TFP, because that’s where it comes together for me. But Sherlock playing for time with his further jokes about being oblivious (‘female?’) – that, again, is Sherlock actively playing a caricature of himself. He’s not doing it for fun – he’s doing it to cover up his concern about the smashed
Blue. Blue is the colour of Sherlock’s mind palace, but this scene ties it firmly to the Conservative party. The dark blue of Sherlock’s scarf nearly matches Welsborough’s jumper, which is in fact a better match for the mind palace aesthetic generally. Thatcher unsurprisingly wears blue as well. If blue is the water that Sherlock is drowning in, how interesting that it’s being tied to the most homophobic prime minister of the last 50 years. There was absolutely no need to make this guy a cabinet minister, dress him in blue, even make Thatcher replace Napoleon – I would actually argue that Churchill is a figure who matches Napoleon’s distance and stature much better for our time. Thatcher is an odd choice, and therefore significant. To tie this to the mind palace further, we then get a shot of Sherlock reflected in the picture of Thatcher as he analyses it – a reflection of him reflecting. In case we forgot what this was actually about.
The problem with parents was that they never knew when you wanted to be left alone. Sherlock would have been content gazing out the window for hours, following John’s every movement, the tenderness that he never let the rest of the world see. He turned to Mummy with an obvious sigh.
. That’s why she’s different, and this is actually a vital line. It suggests that the programmed canon that we know these boys follow, because they have to – that’s not what this show is about. Our characters are agents, and for the first time in history, their lives are dictated by free choice. John chose this Mary, not the Mary of canon – and Sherlock himself makes explicit the comparison between John choosing Mary and John choosing Sherlock. The heart of the story is the choices that can be made for the first time. How incredibly exciting.
. Regardless, his first scene is back to parody here. Sherlock’s quip about the polling station is the sort of quip you only see on television, and the fighting that follows is clearly stage fighting. We get Bond-esque drama as they jump into the pool and smash the glass (note the same motif from the Thatcher smashing earlier), but even before that, banging each others’ heads off the surfaces without a scratch is obvious stage fighting and a well known move. It feels more like theatre than TV, and for me it doesn’t work on film. Perhaps I’m being harsh here, but I feel again that we’re moving into a parody of Sherlock Holmes the superhero. We also get several shots during the fight scene where water seems to obscure the lens with its weird refraction of light; I love this, because it’s a jarring reminder that the camera exists, and with that a reminder that this is artificial. It jolts us out of the scene and speaks to its unreality.
So, in MP terms, why does Sherlock gravitate towards his family home instead of Baker Street as the location to unravel John’s relationship with Mary? Bearing in mind that this is a continuation of the interrogation of their relationship, it seems interesting that he chooses to juxtapose them to the only loving couple we see in this television programme. Like a lot of parallels in EMP, this is something that our dads choose to draw our attention to; Daddy says to Mary “you’re the sane one”, as though every happy relationship has a sane one and a mad genius. And they draw attention to it again – Mary points out that Sherlock brought them here to see a fine example of happily married life.
) which he doesn’t with anyone bar John, and we certainly never see him talk so easily with someone who isn’t John. An eagle-eyed tumblr post that I can’t find now also broke my heart in pointing out that Faith!Eurus’s unseen self-harm matches long-sleeved John Watson a little too well.
Sherlock knew he should not have burst out at John the day prior, but he could not bring himself to properly apologise. Since talking to Mummy, everything had become much more urgent. She had put a countdown on the question, somehow. Stay with me. He knew the words, knew he could say it. Or perhaps the politer, more open, would you perhaps…? And yet, John’s words from a few days ago kept echoing around his head.
I had to start writing. Full credit for inspiration here to @tjlcisthenewsexy, who has definitely had many of these ideas independently, and I would fully recommend watching the video before you read this. I personally only really buy Moffat era Who as a direct parallel to Sherlock, largely because Moffat wrote both, but also because 2010-17 matches up exactly with our boys. Lots of people have drawn parallels between 2005’s Bad Wolf Bay scene (by Russell T Davies) and the tarmac scene – those parallels are definitely there, but I think they’re more due to common tropes in love-declaration scenes than from intent.
He had not realised he had been looking at a spot just past John’s head until he finished speaking. He looked back towards John and realised his eyes were swimming with tears, the same tears that Sherlock was blinking back in his own eyes. It felt like several years before John finally spoke.
Casting the same actor to play dream merchants, knocking characters unconscious and altering their memories and psyches? The universe is rarely so lazy. Other mirrors in this episode are easy to pull out. The Doctor and Sherlock have long been read as mirrors for each other – characters who have existed for a long time and are constantly evolving through adaptation, super-intelligent loners, but in case that wasn’t obvious, Moffat went to a reasonable effort to style them very similarly when both tenures began.
Sherlock was not a part of that life; Sherlock knew that he was a reminder that those things could never be. And so Sherlock hung back, claiming to be busy, although he knew that John knew he was not. He had said he would see them at the gates to the cemetery. And here he was, collar up against the biting wind, scarf firmly tucked into his coat, waiting.
What does it mean, then, when Jim and Emelia become one and the same in the scene where Jim wears the bride’s dress? We initially read this as Jim being the foil to Sherlock, his dark side, but I think it’s more complicated than this. Sherlock’s brain is using Emelia as a means of understanding Jim, but when we watch the episode it seems that they’ve actually merged. Jim wearing the veil of the bride is a good example of this, but I also invite you to rewatch the moment when John is spooked by the bride the night that Eustace dies; the
, and here we’re hitting a pretty silly version of the show where they joke that just about the only character who can’t be real is Father Christmas. These hints about looking for what’s not real, though, should be taken as just that – hints. From the emergence of ‘something’s fucky’ theories early on in s4, this has been the abiding reasoning for the various forms of EMP theory that have sprung up, and they’re not wrong. However, if I had to put my money on a figure like Santa Claus, something iconic which functions as a kind of dream thermometer, I’d be guessing:
, the flesh avatar/dream person threat doesn’t just go away. These words of Madame Kovarian are extremely important:
He did not want to leave; he had known this for a long time. Putting off the new flat, delaying estate agents, all from the will to spend a few more precious weeks in Baker Street. He had excused it to himself, told himself that it would be hard to raise Rosie alone, that he needed support. That that was why.
This episode opens, as so many have pointed out, with doctored footage, as though deliberately showing us how stories can be rewritten. However, we only get glimpses of the footage at the start of the episode – the extensive old footage is not security camera footage, but recap footage from s3, and specifically the end of HLV. The idea that there is something classified, hidden, that we don’t have the full story, is meant to be associated with the actual show
My suggestion is that these aren’t just jokes put in by Mofftiss to say look-we've-read-the-books – Sherlock's mind is actually using the bees from the original stories to negotiate his relationship with his sexuality, and
suggests that there are two worlds, and only one is a dream; their survival depends on recognising which is the real one. This is, of course, a lie – both worlds are dreamed, and that false premise is created to trap them in the Doctor’s psyche, presumably until the Doctor dies (although the threat is never clearly explained). TAB sets up a real world in the form of the modern day and a false Victorian age, but the supernatural graveyard scene is the first hint that the reality/dream binary is not real, just like
No. It wouldn’t. But as Mummy sighed and began to potter, giving up this conversation as a bad job, Sherlock couldn’t help but feel that this was a case of easier said than done.
In both scenes, Sherlock and the Doctor are left standing off to the right, unsure of what to do – if you watch both scenes in parallel, it’s striking. There’s a great article here talking about how the angle demonstrates the Doctor to be powerless for the first time, amongst other things.
), and infer that Charlie is queer coded – much like David Yost, who played the blue power ranger, he is not able to come out without being treated badly. This is undoubtedly important, as is the fact that this is the second time in 12 minutes of this show that they’ve shown us how easily film footage can be faked, and someone can be lied to – you don’t need to have Mycroft Holmes levels of clearance, just a Zoom background. This is important too. But the other thing I want to focus on is that he says he’s in Tibet.
Once Sherlock has been shot, the Molly/Anderson/Jim/Mycroft section which sets up EMP is fairly self-explanatory – the only thing I want to dive into here to point out is that this is the first appearance of Jim in the EMP, as a kind of restrained beast, and his most pivotal line is the fear he represents:
He looked to the advent wreath. The reflection of the candlelight bounced off Rosie’s forehead, seeming to plant on it a benevolent kiss. Perhaps John imagined it, but he felt such a kiss on his own forehead as well. He breathed a sigh of relief. Whatever happened now, going forward, he hoped he had Mary’s blessing.
‘Though the world explode’ is a reference to WW1, which is coming in the final Sherlock Holmes story, and which is symbolised by Eurus – in other chapters, I explain why Eurus and WW1 are united under the concept of ‘winds of change’ in this show. Sherlock and John survive the winds of change – except they don’t move with them. Instead, they stay stuck in 1895, the year of ultimate repression. 2014!Sherlock going back in his head to 1895 and repeating how he met John suggests exactly that, that nothing has changed but the superficial, and that emotionally, he is still stuck in 1895.
We move back to Baker Street, where we’ve lost heart!John, because Sherlock has denied him. Substitute John is still there, though – the red balloon exists, deflated, weighed down by some books. Books normally represent ACD canon in this show, so it’s not difficult to see the balloon – John in Sherlock’s mind – weighed down by canon expectation of him.
It was not like that Christmas at Baker Street, with Irene Adler, when John had been brimming over with jealousy and Sherlock had played the violin for hours into the night, unable to articulate his pain.
And then, that Thursday, he walked in from work and into the sitting room, as he always did, plonked his bag down and turned, looking for Rosie. And there she was, in the kitchen, wide-eyed at a laboratory experiment. John recognised it immediately from school – it wasn’t particularly dangerous, just a baking soda explosion. Sherlock knew better than to do anything dangerous with one so young, though by the look of the velocity of the eruption John wondered whether Sherlock hadn’t added a couple of extra reactions of his own. Rosie was mesmerised, unable to look away from the bubbling liquid. She was sitting on Sherlock’s lap; he was holding her up so that she could see, rapidly murmuring to her words that John could not hear, words that from anybody else would have been baby talk but from Sherlock John imagined would be chemical reactions. Start her scientific education from the get-go.
Now. Why is Sherlock so keen for Lestrade to take the credit? It’s another reason to bring up the fact that John’s blog is constantly updating – it’s dropped in a lot in this series as opposed to others – and to make us think about why nothing is happening in real life. But, given that this episode is about Sherlock trying to find who he is, is it a rejection of the persona that goes along with being Sherlock Holmes? Possibly, but he’s going to have to go to a lot more effort than that. John’s blog is the real problem here, making not just Sherlock but Lestrade out to be like they’re not. John’s blog is a stand in for the original stories, which were supposed to be written by John Watson, but TAB has already (drawing on TPLoSH) laid the groundwork for the idea that John’s blog/those stories really do not tell the whole story. So this is coming back with a vengeance here, even though for the first time Sherlock is properly moving against the persona in there, not just bitching about John’s writing style, which is a theme more common to Sherlock Holmes across the ages. John then says that it’s obvious, and when pressed just laughs and says that it’s normally what Sherlock says at this point – so again, when Sherlock stops filling the intense caricature of arrogance and bravado, John the storyteller steps in to put him back in line, even though that means pulling him back to being a much more unpleasant character.
