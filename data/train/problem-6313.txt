“Why don’t you sit down and rest. I’ll go ask Vision what’s going on. Okay?” Steve waits, so patiently for him that Tony feels a bit embarrassed. He manages to nod and then Steve has him settle back into the recliner. “I’ll be right back. Don’t move.”
He falls asleep like that, groggy with tears. When he wakes it’s too early, the sun is just creeping out over the of the edge of the city. Tony glances at the daylight glinting off the girders of New York City. A sleeping giant of metal and steel. He hangs at the window, staring down at his city. He shouldn’t have stayed. He should have gone back to California. But instead, he ended up here with Steve.
“Of course,” Steve says and then deflates – like the anger burnt out and he’s left with not even an ember. He turns away from Tony, head hanging. “Thanks. For everything. I mean. Thanks.”
“You mentioned her on the ship.” Steven says and then they walk toward the morning room. The room is resplendent in the finest dark woods that offset the floor to ceiling doors opening up to the terrace that welcome the gardens. Servants stand at the ready. A sideboard is set and the food warmed, waiting for them.
“Gah,” Tony groans and bats at Steve as he wakes. “What? What are you doing?” He’s panting as if he can barely breathe.
Steve rubs at his cheek but that just makes his nose pound like someone stabs him repeatedly in the face. “The serum will take care of it. I need to straighten it, but otherwise it’ll be fine. We need to find some place.” His voice rasps; he spits out some blood, then looks up and stops. “What’s that?”  He’s no longer looking down at the stain in the snow, but farther out to the horizon.
“It looks like the one in the episode The City on the Edge of Tomorrow on the original Star Trek series.”
The elevator dropped for what seemed like too long. He could feel the anxiety vibrating off of Pepper. She sidled closer to Happy. He would protect her at all costs even if it meant Tony’s life at stake. They’d talked about it before. When the elevator opened on the laboratory and vivarium level a guard stood blocking their exit. He was muscular, dark haired, carried his ammunition on belts crossed over his chest. He held an AR15 in his gloved hands and gave Tony a respectful nod.
“Sir, there is single heat signature in the cave. It is not reading as human.”
“You have claim me as your own, my lord,” Steven whispers and there’s a pain deep in those words.
Steve sets down the orange he is peeling and further wraps his wing around Tony. It aches but the salt water did wonders for him, bathing within the cradle of Mother Earth helped. “Very much.”
But this time, it is too much. The venom acts so fast, so very rapidly. Nothing can stop it. Not nature, not science, not a miracle. Blu scrubs at the ground with his paw and then lifts his head if only for a moment to glimpse him again.
“I get that. But all myths and legends have some truth, right?” Tony soldered as he spoke.
Just as he starts, Tony jerks awake and yells, “Fuck, fuck, what the hell?”
“Well, you could’ve fooled me.” Tony crosses his arms and studies Steven – while his hands have uncurled from fists he’s not relaxed at all. That flight or fight response is high. “It’s not like you want to be around me.”
CHAPTER 8 Off to INDIA
“Obie, I’m so glad you could make it. I was sure you would be off to the fleet by now,” Tony says though his tone to Steve’s trained ear sounds strained.
“The likes of you?” Tony murmurs as he nibbles at Steve’s earlobe.
“What happened? Did someone attack him?” Her greenish blue eyes search his face and Sam lifts up the towel. “Son of a – who did this to him?”  And then she finds it. “What’s this?” She tugs the letter out of his hand. “Jesus, Sam, is this a suicide note?”
“I have serious doubts whether she’s telling the truth,” Tony mutters.
“When we were in Germany,” Tony starts. They flew him from Afghanistan to Germany for treatment at a military health facility, and then straight away to the States. At the base in Germany, he talked with the General about Steve. “Ross didn’t give me much hope. He said there wasn’t anyone searching for me but your group.”
Bruce smiles again with that exhausted look. “No, you won’t, but I’ll be here to help when you need me in any case.”
“Talk to Pepper or Rhodey. See how they deal with the media hounds.” He waves at Steve. “Now, I need to rest. We’ll plan the trip in the morning.”
She mumbles as she consults her V-Nets. “A robot is not the same thing as an omega. Now, hush, I need to find out if there’s another option to find an omega for you-.”
“What are you talking about?” Steve said.
“Yeah. So?” He keeps his eyes staring straight at the doors.
“How can that be when I’m driven by the same biology, the same tenets, learned the same jaded history all the rest of the alphas learned?” Tony bites at his lips. “But the truth is, at least I see it, right? I’m better than the best of the lot, I suppose.”
Sam pops the goggles onto the top of his head and then sends Redwing off to do some scouting ahead. The bird caws as it leaves his shoulder. Bucky doubts the utility of the bird, but he’s not going to say anything especially when Sam agreed to come along on what amounts to a suicide mission. He nods to Sam awaiting his word on where they’re headed. Sam taps his mouth once and points to the east. Bucky moves forward, he always takes point even with Redwing in front of them.
“That’s a surprise,” Tony said. He settled back down into Steve’s embrace. “I just figured you like to do a routine, that you didn’t have time for stuff like that.”
“You’re there. I grew up thinking it was not okay. I never explored the idea that I could, that I might be attracted to-.” He stopped and swallowed hard. He couldn’t look at Tony. “I don’t know what to do.”
“Upstate,” Sam said. “That’s what Nat said.” He gave Steve the address. “She said to approach cautiously – they have traps set.”
Natasha smirked in a rueful way. “I wish. I can’t bring you to a different dimension. I can’t do that with any human. It would kill you.” She eased over to sit on the side of the bed. The bed that was in a medbay but a medbay without equipment in a Helicarrier that looked like it was stripped down to the nuts and bolts. She kept her hands to herself, but the presence, her weight on the bed centered him, focused the room on her. “Once a vampire transforms, we leave that world behind.”
Soul packs are rarer still.
He turns off the big screen and goes to the large sliding glass doors to the deck. Reading people is like predicting the weather. Nice one minute, a blizzard the next. Gusts torture the trees outside and bend them to its will. He thinks of Steve’s reaction. Nothing can bend Captain America to its will, but maybe a fictional story can twist him a little.
He’s not wrong. In order for the mission to work, Tony devised a micro-chip that would sync with the cradle. Cho used the micro-chip to fabricate vibranium neurological interfaces within their craniums. At the base of their skulls, she implanted the devices that would link them to the cradle which would then connect with the internet. Tony wrote the code that ensured that their consciousness shuttled to the closest input point to find Ultron’s base code.
Steve arches up and cries out, his teeth clenched in distress. Jerking away, Tony bends down and coaxes Steve. “Can you hear me? Do you know I’m here?” He has to get Steve out of the dark so he can figure out what the hell is going on. The low lighting from the arc reactor isn’t enough to figure out the details of what he is seeing. He’s not even sure he can get Steve to move, or if the chains and whatever else this thing is over his back will permit him to escape the corner of his prison.
"You'll see." Coulson smiles as if he's watching a child at Christmas. "It really is an honor to meet you. I was there, you know, when they-."
Steve’s glance shoots up and he reads the hardened look on Fury’s face as not an expression of resentment but of reserve, consideration. He’s waiting, testing, and seeing if Steve can earn his wings as a Guardian.
“I thought you said cynic.”
“It’s only a dream,” Steve said and leaned down again to touch his lips not only to Tony’s mouth, but to his neck, he traversed downward and Tony felt his own needs heighten.
Steve hides his face by turning slightly away from Tony. This thing in front of him isn’t Tony. It’s a concoction of Ultron’s design, a creation meant to lure him so that Ultron has the time to infect Steve’s brain, escape the worm, and eventually – what?
“Don’t give me that shit,” Tony said. “You’re not going to stop hurting him if I promise to be good.”
to stop, but there were no words. He had no power on the physical plane at all. His eyeless, faceless self moved over a battered Steve, hunting for something, the fangs prominent in its mouth. Blood oozed from Steve’s many wounds. It laid on top of Steve for a moment as if in need of rest. Steve remained still as the grave. Tony prayed and wished it would stop. Told himself not to do this. In this state would his physical body completely drain Steve? Would he kill Steve and not even know he was doing it?
“Well, we went for a motorcycle drive-.”
“Some of our captors, their children are sick. They come to me and I help them.”
Fury pulled out a dossier from his long leather coat inside pocket and slipped it across the table. “When we found him, he was frozen. We didn’t know he was alive. Things were done, experiments by those in SHIELD looking to find the secret to the serum. No one bothered to figure it out until they started the experiments, he woke up. It wasn’t pretty.”
“Ca-Captain.”
“I can do this all day,” Steve said and smiled. “Now cover up as much as possible.”
“No,” Steve said. He sat on the couch in the same place he’d sat the night before when they ate burgers and drank shakes. Elbows on knees, he clasped his hands together. “I think I need to focus on the Mantra.”
“Are you okay?”
Steve had seen the dossier on Tony; he knows his history, his background. “Well, you’re not alone.”
“You’re officially on the clock. That means that sir would like you to attend him during his afternoon gathering.” Jarvis glowers at him, just waiting for Steve to refuse or claim otherwise.
“And if you did, you’d be in the same position we’re in. Don’t be fooled, darling. What’s happening to us is bigger than you think.”
Yet. The moments before their deaths, before Howard and Maria met the Winter Soldier, clicked into Tony’s mind as if he’d simply pressed a button. He saw Howard’s blood, heard the pleading in his voice, saw him reached up to a cold-hearted killer. But the worst of it, the horror of it was when he experienced the crushing of the bones of his mother’s trachea.
Tony goes to help him as he explains. “That’s my AI – artificial intelligence. Think of him as a robot but without a body, okay?” He helps Steve back onto the stool. With a touch he feels Steve tremble. “Yes JARVIS?”
“Captain Rogers?”
Steve listens and takes a long swig. He doesn’t usually partake, mainly because of lessons learned as a youngster, but he gulps it down and then waits as Tony checks the join.
“Well, then you leave him to Estane. Estane along with Rossi will have a powerful coalition, especially since many saw that Rossi would be the heir to the High Alpha Chair when Spector abdicated and went into seclusion,” Steven says. “That leaves this table and the other alphas that might sign on behind you.”
“You died as a sacrifice in order to get the stone. We needed the stone to defeat Thanos!” The bowl tumbles from his hands. The hot soup burns but it’s not the torment he suffers. The thing – the netted ball of thorns under his breastbone spikes and tears within him. It pierces him through, and he arches his back.
“Aw, it was nothing,” he replies but Tony swears he sees the color on Steve’s cheeks heighten. Expertly, Steve fixes Tony his second cup of coffee and then begins to clean the kitchen.
Tony sighs and gets up once again, striding right over to the lion. “What is your probl-.” He stops. Setting down, he spots the burrs stick all over Blu’s snout and piercing the tender places in his chin and lips. Blood leaks out. He also spots a few embedded in the cat’s paws.
Steve clears his throat and turns back to the bacon. “I think you should consider that a relationship shouldn’t be about changing who you are.”
Tony shoves his hands in his pockets and rather than let the bull skewer him, he takes it by the horns. “Well, what do you want to say, Rogers. Just come out and say it. I’m a big boy.”
But it isn’t. And it will never be.
Steve jerked his hand away. “What?”
She considers him. “It depends. What is your way?
Frank, the monster or prick as Tony thinks of him, puts a hand on Tony's chest to shove him out into the narrow hallway. "Don't think he's interest, John-boy."
“Thank you Erik.”
“I can design the new arm,” Tony said.
Swiftly, Steve makes his way through the ship’s quarters level. No sign of the Strike Team greets him and he’s inwardly relieved. Rumlow creeps him out. At least, Natasha banned him from the Widow’s Brothel.
“Well then, I think Wong will train both of you. I assume this means we will have greater exchange of information?” Strange gripped his hands together, but Steve noted a slight tremor as if they were not as strong as they should be.
Steve flinches at that admission. He doesn’t want that responsibility anymore. The fierce glare Tony gives him feeds him strength. “You want my secrets? Fine, have them all. It doesn’t matter now that we’re dead – does it?” He inhales and then slowly releases his breath. “I couldn’t continue. Not on Earth. Not knowing you died. I couldn’t do it. Everything I’d once dreamed -.” He stops that’s not the right way. There’s only one way.
“Well then go, who asked you here anyhow? Is this about Rhodes and the suit? Or the government trying to take my armor. You can’t reverse engineer it, I figured out ways for that not to happen,” Tony had said and sipped his coffee. His head throbbed and no matter how many doughnuts he ate his mouth still tasted of plaster. What the hell had he been eating and drinking during his party? “No one can take the armor.”
“What is it? What do you want?” Tony desperately needs to move, but he freezes and waits. He needs this to be perfect for Steve.
He knows this is a sin, he’s sinned before with his first charge. He’s a fallen angel and his life is breaking in the mortal world. Bonds between humans and angels are frowned upon, are discouraged. He cannot stop himself.
“We’re talking love.” His voice is a whisper.
Steve pushed away vines as they walked through the path. A light patter of rain started. “And what would that be?”
“Yes?” Tony’s not even sure he should admit he’s here. Maybe he should just get up and leave, because how the hell is he ever going to explain this to Pepper.
“You don’t have to be brave, you know. I can help you,” Tony said as they scrambled down the stairs. The physical alert system of the compound flashing and screaming in the corridors and stairwell as they hurried to the garage.
“Help who? And why?” Tony crossed his arms over his chest, fully aware that he closed himself off both physically and through their soul bond, but sometimes it was necessary.
“I know,” Tony whispers into the dark.
“What’s the story?” Steve asks and is keenly aware that Tony’s watching his every move. Instead of allowing it to affect him, Steve only ushers his Deputy and friend to sit and discuss the issue.
He accesses the current list of attendees. Frowning, he still cannot understand why Fury insists on allowing some of these corporations and groups agency. They deserve less than nothing in some aspects. Over the course of the human history in space, corporations, unions, and guilds as well as some less savory types like Ringers and Pirates have succeeded in attaining person rights. In Steve’s mind that’s all kinds of wrong.
Tony halted right before they approached the emergency room, right before they rejoined the group. Gripping Bruce by the shoulders and trying to stem the flow of his own tears, Tony said, “He called me, he called me Beloved. I have to know, I have to know what- what it means? What does it mean?”
Sam looks him up and down and releases his arm. “Take care of yourself, Steve.”
“Where are you going?” The world narrows around him as if he is looking at it through the wrong end of binoculars.
In response, Blu opens his mouth. Tony peers in and hisses.
“Blu? Blu!”
“He needs you,” Strange says. “You need to come with us. Ms. Potts knows this now. Come. His speech is soon, and the crowds are dying down outside.” He nods to the entrance way where the people have drifted away. The paparazzi aren’t manning their stations.  “That means they’re seating soon for the dinner.”
“Sure,” Bucky says and he’s expression warms notably. It’s almost enough for Steve to relent and announce to Bucky that he has the job as second deputy, but he doesn’t.
Steve stood there, panting with his hand on his chest and his head bowed. Tony crossed the distance between them. Steve glanced up at him, his eyes only offered a remote haunted look that plagued him earlier.
“The one with the Death Star.”
Tony stops at the door, catches the frame with his hand, and then turns his head to assess Steve. “You already said that, I said it was okay. I’m fine with it.”
“I think this conversation is over and you are dead, Iron Man. Perhaps I will take over as the Iron Man, no?” He snaps his fingers again. A man jumps out of the back of the SUV. He’s carrying a whip and a remote that must also control the collar around the lion’s neck. He cracks the whip once and the lion startles.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked,” Steve says and goes into the bathroom. He closes the door, and, leaning against it, sinks onto the floor. He bends his knees up and folds his arms onto them. He cradles his head there and closes his eyes. His heat dissipates. He’s done. He cannot even hide in the rising tide of desire from his own fears and loss. At least with his presentation he had something to focus on. Now there’s nothing.
“Don’t say it, don’t God damn say it. I don’t need my rest. I’ve been well for a long time now, you keep me waiting and doing nothing but watching the tumbleweeds blow down the damned street of the town.” Bucky slams a fist against the window frame. The uneven glass rattles. “You picked Clint as your deputy. Clint.”
Steve finds his way to the chair that happens to be at Stark’s right side while the woman sits at his left. He tucks in but not comfortably since he feels so out of place and ridiculous in a world he doesn’t understand.
Steve chuckled. “No flight. I’m taking the train. To New York.”
He had swallowed down the bitter bile and shook his head. “I appreciate your words of wisdom, ma’am. But like I said, I’m no one. I don’t have a role to play anymore.  I laid down my shield and I think the next generation will pick it up now.”
“Yeah.” Steve gets quiet for a moment as he dips the bread into his stew. “I’m sorry about what happened to your mother, Tony. It has to be painful.”
“You need someone better than me to take care of you.”
“Sure,” Tony says and looks away from Steve’s blush.
She leans down and kisses the crown of his head. “Now, we can be friends. Not boss and employee. Isn’t that better.”
Tony kisses his cheek. “How about I play the piano for a bit and you, you do that little thing we talked about earlier?”
“So that means?” Steve spins on his heels, trying to ignore the momentary vertigo. He spots the exit Door in the distance – but there’s something terribly wrong with it. “Tony? Tony!” He points to the Door. It’s disintegrating, pixelating into fragments.
The toast pops up and Steve ignores it to flip the bacon. “I don’t know. I just thought you were going to retire to a farm with Pepper.”
"No morphine, nothing to put him out?" Steve asks.
Steve hangs up the towel and climbs back up the steps, knowing that Tony will trail after him, passes the prison cells, toward the front office. Bucky is nowhere to be found, the extra deputy badge on the desk. With gun holster belted on, Steve takes out his own badge and pins it on waiting for Tony to explain.
“This might hurt a bit. Don’t bite me, okay?” Tony picks up the forceps and slides them between the massive toes. The burrs are a mass of thorns poking into the tender meat of Blu’s toes. “You know the story of the lion and the mouse. The mouse helps the lion escape and, or the mouse pulls a thorn out of the lion’s paw or something like that and just like magic they’re friends. The mouse doesn’t get eaten. In this story, of course, I am playing the lion and you’re the mouse – obviously.”
“Are you in heat, SR?” Tony tastes the letters – SR. Just doesn’t sound or feel right to him. “Nope, SR. Do you like that? Or should I just call you One?”
“Come with me to bed,” Tony says and reaches up to caress the line of Steve’s cheek. “You’re intriguing to me, Captain, but more so the good in you, the good is my elixir. I want it. Come with me to bed. It’s why you came here, you know that, I know that.”
His hands dropped and he turned away, afraid to look at the phantom of his love. “It’s wrong.”
Of course, Bruce scrunched up his face. “How’s Steve handling it?”
“Yeah, it is,” Steve said. “I’m grateful, Tony. To the whole team, the whole pack for coming with me. I can’t imagine going through Peggy’s funeral with no one, or even just one of you.  Everyone here means so much.”
Clint shrugged. “Laura spends a lot of time taking care of the kids when I’m not here. I try and lift the burden from her as much as possible when I’m here.”
Steve tears away from the intensity of Tony’s expression and he stands up, walking to the rail of the porch and leaning against it, gripping it. “Maybe you and I have a different view on life.”
“No. For not saying what you’re thinking in front of Pepper and Rhodey.” Strange may be an arrogant son of a bitch of a doctor but he respects Tony’s privacy and his autonomy. For all their hearts of gold, both Pepper and Rhodey are far too overprotective. Sometimes he feels as if they treat him more like a toddler than a grown man.
Steve shakes his head and in the corner of Tony’s vision he sees the mane from so long ago. “No. Not at all. Blu brought me to you. Being Blu is part of me. Just like that lanky skinny kid is part of me. Just like the arc reactor used to be part of you.” Steve runs his fingers down the scar left by the arc reactor that had been removed ages ago.
Over the years Steve fooled around with some of his friends. He liked it. Bucky wasn’t really into guys, but they did have the occasional friends with benefits relationship. It was always relaxing and freeing in a way – just some moments of pleasure in an otherwise grueling life.
“Yes, ma’am.”
Natasha looks down. There’s a finality in her words.
“Let’s just say I had an awakening,” Tony says and tries not to think about Steve being garroted and raped. It hurts so much to think about the look on his face as he collapsed into the bed, worried that Tony would expect him to put out. But that look and all the vulnerability disappeared when Bucky happened.
“Steve. Nice to meet you too. But remember it’s all about security, right?” He ushers Steve into a wide hallway much different than the other corridors on the ship. “This way to the prince’s quarters.” He nervously laughs. “So how long you been at the station?”
"Shield?"  He has memories of the disk, the shield he held in his hands, how smooth it was, how light it was for such a large metallic object. But all of those visceral memories are fake. "How can I help you, sir?"
Smirking, Tony shook his head and rolled his eyes. He saw it now. Living in the Tower with the whole team would be like reliving days in a college dormitory. “You drew the short straw, didn’t you?”
“Have a burger.” Logan places a burger in his lap and then hooks a chair with the toe of his boot to bring it closer to the bed. He settles in it and chows down on his burger.
Bucky stumbles to his feet, hovering over a slumped Steve. “They’re all the people you killed. All of them. Kids, women, old men. All of them. See them, Stevie. See that one – he followed you into the battle when you brought SHIELD down, but he died because of his faith in you. See that boy, he died because of your foolishness during the Chitauri invasion – thinking a band of six could go against an army.” Bucky wipes the blood away from his face. “You always were arrogant, stubborn, and stupid. What did Ultron say to you?” Bucky smiles, his teeth are stained with the blood Steve put there. “ ‘God's righteous man. Pretending you could live without a war.’ Always looking to force more death so you can feel important. Why Stevie? Why?”
He gets no indication that Tony hears him at all. He tries heedlessly.
“What is he saying?”
He swears he can hear a malicious laugh in the AI’s voice, but he didn’t program her with any type of emotion. But how does jealousy fit into that? He only shakes his head as he enters the lift. “Omega quarters.” It really isn’t the official omega quarters – that would be in the urgency room or the presentation suite. Even bonded though, this omega was proving to be a problem. Like Pep said, he’s an issue or how Tony likes to phrase it – a regular pain in his ass. It might be time for some disciplinary action.
The chain sounds again and then Tony glimpses a foot shift into the light. It looks human. “JARVIS?”
“Off to my quarters,” Tony says and, with that, picks Steve up bridle style and brings him to the upper level and to his quarters. Once there, he announces, “JARVIS, food. Plenty of electrolyte drinks.”
“That’s really odd. He should know better,” Tony says but heads toward the wreck. He turns briefly to Steve. “Are you coming?”
Steve hangs his head. “This mission is far more rife with dangers than we first thought.”
He turns to see Steven freshly dressed, straight shouldered, and remote standing a meter away from him. His hands are at parade rest, he keeps his sights far away. Tony could address the matter right here, right now. He could apologize, but what would that mean? Would it mean that Tony thinks it’s okay for Steven to question his authority? That Tony accepts Steven’s interference in his drinking? Right now, he cannot parse his own feelings and doesn’t trust himself with any heart to heart with his omega.
“Yeah, eat up because we’re going to my private gym.”
The attacker holding Tony pushes him to the floor, to his knees. “I’m surprised you let him sleep in your bed. I thought I taught you better than that.”
“Nanites,” Tony says. “I did it before. I should be able to do it again. We have to introduce nanites into the system or systems that are affected by the entanglement.”
“Son of a bitch,” Tony said. He’d known there was something here – an animal or something they would need to transfer to a safer facility. Hell, he’d already contacted some of the best zoologists in the world for assistance. He’d never expected to find a human being. His rage transformed then, into hot adrenalin and he could only think of one thing – get the man out of here and then burn the place down. “You!” He screamed at Rumlow. “Get the fuck down there and help. I want him out of that cage, that thing off of his face, and dressed in five minutes. Or else, I tell the Movement that you disobeyed.”
Steve checks his table and sees Wong and Strange settling next to the same couple they were speaking to earlier. When he turns back Rhodes has managed to break the barricade of guards and Steve’s face to face with Tony.
The tapping wakes him and Steve – no, the Silver Knight – peels his eyes open. His body itches for motion and he climbs to a sitting position. The ache in his throat is nearly gone. Tony – no, the Red Knight – stands to the side, leaning against the frame of the cottage. His arms are crossed, and he concentrates on him – as if something about his person might inform the demon’s plans.
Until the new life he lived become something of a puzzle. At times when he tried to unravel it he felt like a cat with a ball of yarn. It never stopped unrolling and it never stopped knotting around him until frustration tied him.
“Get in there, I will meet you back here in thirty minutes,” Steve says and hisses at Tony. It’s playful and Tony wags his eyebrows at him until he huffs, stomps his foot, and marches away.
“Not nervous,” Steve whispers but he swallows hard.
“No, I’m just wondering if we could have some music so I can do my shopping list while you busy yourself down there.”
“Oh.” Tony glances at the setting sun and then back to Blu who waits for him. Though the poppies catch the fire of the sun as it melts along the horizon, he sees no beauty in it. His heart forces him to go back, to follow a big animal away from civilization such as it is, and toward a different path.
“Steve?” Sam asked. The seriousness of the situation settled over them like the cloak of night. “We’re in trouble, aren’t we? All the vampires, the mates, the sympathizers. With the US going full hog crazy, we’re all in a world of trouble, aren’t we?”
No. Tony’s not like his father. Howard commanded a room, yes much like Tony. Howard commanded by force, Tony never did. He always used his wiles and his charm, and his intelligence to gain the favor of people. But then again, nothing in what Steve and Tony did or said over the last two days indicated that Steve was the least bit interested in him. He’d overshot, he’d taken what he wanted. He acted like his father. He gasps and clamps a hand over his mouth. That wasn’t his intention. Never. He hadn’t wanted that. He wanted Steve to know, to understand. He wanted Steve to want him.
CHAPTER 9
“Well, we don’t have a lot of choices. Unless you want to slip out of this rim and go back?” It hadn’t occurred to him before to really retrace their steps. Doing it might throw Ultron off, cause the AI to do another pause in the virtual reality. “It might be the best way to go.”
“Wasn’t the mantra of your Hydra, cut off one head, two will take its place?” T’Challa asked and leaned forward. “Your escape with Mister Stark and Natasha’s coven surely did cut off the heads of part of the government of your country, but just because you have done that does not mean you have rooted out the cause of all evil. The root of it still exists in your lands. It rots the land and poisons it.”
Nat tilts her head as if she’s computing the information. “How dangerous are we talking?”
“Nah, we did that especially for you,” Clint said and slung his arm around Steve’s shoulders. With the other hand he tapped his earpiece. “Nat turn off the perimeter. I got him. Bring out someone to fish Cap’s bike out of the weeds.” He winked at Steve. “Come on let’s go.”
“A little more?” Steve asks.
Tony stared down at the cell. It was plain. Nothing much. A bench in one corner and a blanket folded next to the bench. What looked like a shower head was tucked into the opposite corner. Tony frowned. Next to the shower head was a toilet with a sink. He stared at it for several seconds. Why would an animal need a toilet? Had they trained it to use a toilet? What the fuck had his father and Stane been doing?
“Oh, okay. That’s good idea.” Steve looks around and then realizes his shield is lost. “Do you think I could conjure up the shield again?”
“Activate it,” Estane commands once again and Steven falls when another shock crackles over his skin. Tony can smell the burnt flesh.
“Wait, what? You have one?” Tony asks and the stunned feeling radiates upward numbing him from his toes to the crown of his head.
“Remember, Commander Rogers, that’s Sir Stane to you.”
It turns out that the soup is delicious but with a bitterness to it that stings. His eyes water as he eats. She blows on her spoon and lifts a chin to him.
“God, Steve,” Tony murmured and shifted to give Steve better access to his neck and chest. “I want to- I want to touch you too.” He wanted Steve’s pants off. But suddenly the idea of asking got all tangled up with fears and isolation and – holy shit that was Steve’s thoughts and worries. “Steve.” Tony stopped him, bracing his hands against his arms. “I want more of you. Can we? Can we take off our pants?” Tony felt the blush of embarrassment from Steve just as surely as if he’d been the bashful one.
“Thermos of hot chocolate because Vision told me it would be cold. But mainly sandwiches and some fruit.”  He swings the backpack to the ground and pulls out the blanket. Spreading it on the rough ground, he narrates, “I put a blanket down, just behind you if you want to sit down. It’s in a patch of sunlight.”
He was fooling himself if he thought that the Tony in his dreams might be anything like the Tony in reality. The real Tony wouldn’t be understanding, wouldn’t get that it was hard for Steve to accept the idea that he might just be attracted to a man. He would snark and bitch at Steve, belittle him for his narrow mindedness. But where did the Tony in his dreams come from?
“Sure.” Great he loves the idea of talking to the AI about his asshole.
“Careful now.” She offers him the small cup. “Drink.”
His clothes need to be changed and he’s disappointed because blue suits him so well. Going to the closet he rifles through the clothes and decides on the narrow standing collared fitted tunic with flowing drawstring pants. The pants are slightly see through from mid-thigh down. The tunic is the palest of blues with a beautiful sheen to it. A thin etching of thread embroiders the stand up collar. It will have to do.
“Is the universe deciding I’m gay?” Steve asked.
“And you are.” His mother smiled. “You always will be. Nothing about you was ever a failure, Steven. Nothing. You always stood up. You always fought.”
“You get that we’re all going to be exposed in there, that we’ll be able to see each other’s deepest selfs.”
Tony bites at his lips. If anyone would know it would be Barnes. “The rebar punctured his lower abdomen.” He hopes that sets off some clues to Barnes.
Steve takes the dossier and waves his hand over it to reveal the information and his charge. “Tony Stark, of Stark Industries?”
The agent shuts the door and Steve looks back at the bag. He's stepping out, going to the real world again. A world he cannot fathom or recognize. What could a government agency possibly want with him? He might not know who he is, not with memories or images from his past, but he knows to his bones, who he is as a person and no hospital or doctors are going to suppress that again. He takes off the robe, toes off the slippers and grabs the bag. He goes to the little bathroom and quickly and efficiently showers. He dries off, shaves with the tiny plastic shaver that doesn't do a good job, and finally dresses. He feels more human than he has in months. A shiver of cold runs through him when he crosses to the door to his hospital room. This is the end of this phase, he's leaving now. He glances at the blackened screen of the television and then rights his shoulders. He's ready to go. He grasps the knob and swings open the door.
When considering doing this, Steve looked up some information online. Not the best resource, but it was what he needed. He spent hours reading over the horror stories, but he knows it won’t be like that for him. Cutting out the gland can lead to death, but that seems remote to him. He’s been through this before, after all. The mad scientists that cut out his gland when he had been captured after Tony had been shot had surgically removed it time and again. They left a small root of the gland every time so that the serum would grow the gland back. This time he intends to take the whole thing and not allow it to grow back. He recalls Cho doing the ultrasound on his gland, explaining the anatomy, plus he read some of the anatomy on line. The root of the gland at the apex along with the fibers running to the pituitary gland and the brain are bundled together. He should be able to remove the entire gland. He doesn’t want it recovered. He doesn’t want to even have to think about going to the Retreat again or even the Mating Blocks somewhere else in the world.  The thought of being in heat, somewhere in the world and needing to go to some of the blocks he’s heard about, terrifies him more than it should. This is the best solution.
Every word rooted deep within Steve, tangling with his doubts and growing through the terrors that followed him into the night. He raised his hand and smoothed a finger down Tony’s face, staring into those alien eyes. Yet, he saw not the eyes of a Divini, but the soul of someone he loved, the man he loved, the one he’d trusted all those years ago to save him from the brink of despair. Now, that same man stood before him, both of them dangling over the abyss with only each other to hold onto and hope for salvation.
“I can answer it. Of course I can answer it,” Steve says. He grits his teeth because this is not what he wanted, why he sacrificed his gland. “I wanted to give you the freedom to start again. I was – am – willing to do that for you. This wasn’t a cry for help. It was an act of kindness. Of course, I love you. There’s no question. But I’m not the right omega for you and that’s a different thing, isn’t it?”
“Do you believe in God, Sheriff,” Bruce asks, the rise of anger lurks in his eyes.
“And still you came to me.”
“And Stark?” Steve asked.
"This is your God then?"
And alone.
That’s not fair.
“What have you found to do in the basement?” Steve dips his fries into the vinegar.
Steve interrupts him. “I don’t believe you for a minute. Not for a second. You care. Otherwise smart streets and clean energy wouldn’t be top on your list of projects. You care. I know you do. The world can’t lose you and, truthfully, I don’t want to lose you. Not you.” He drops off to silence.
“Astral projections have energy waves. Energy waves like all waves can cancel each other out. They must synchronize perfectly to bond,” JARVIS said. “A bonding experience is rare, a soul pack rarer still. As it is, Captain Rogers might not find another person to be in his soul pack.”
“No!” Tony says and rounds the counter. “No! You said homosexual. You didn’t say bisexual.”
“No, we can’t use vibranium. It wouldn’t be possible with the gland. We’re using a living tissue matrix for the simulacrum.” That’s Helen Cho and Steve tries to force his head to move to see her. “We’ll harvest tissue from his thigh and we’ll also take some of the nerve tissue. Using that and the last of the gland that still functional, we’ll re-establish the gland.”
Tony pulls on the boots that came with the whole getup and snaps on the gloves. “You know this is ridiculous. We can’t both fit on that thing.”
“Now we know what Divini you are,” Shuri smirked. “My brother, I told you he was Divini.”
“God, no, no, no!” Steve crawls to his hands and knees, sinking into the muddy snow. He gets to Tony’s side and seizes the bare wires. They scorch his hand and he fights to tug them away from Tony. It takes too long to overcome the strength of the electrical current, but he’s able to do it. Thank God it is only a small battery. He jerks and throws the battery to the side. Tony slumps down from the bowed position his body had been thrown into. The smell of burning flesh hangs heavy in the air.
That can only mean one thing - whatever's been going down has been in play for more than a few minutes. His pulse races and he swallows down the fear. He crouches down as he walks close to the building, listening to get an idea of what he's about to encounter. He can’t catch any noise, not outside. It means he needs to go in and that means he's committed to this foolhardy task.
Steve stares at Tony, but he’s blinking too fast as if shuttling through different memories. Maybe the Battle of New York affected Steve in ways that none of them could possibly understand. A quiver runs up Steve’s arm and Tony snaps to attention. Talking to Logan, maybe even Richards becomes a necessity as he watches Steve battling some internal foe.
“Like I said, I need someone to help with technical schematics. I need someone who is a fast study and willing to work through the night. I am on a tight schedule.  I only have a few months to get the project completed. I may need to travel some, in order to consult with experts in the field.” Tony stands up, keeping his hand on the desk as he rounds it and then sits on the edge of it. “I need someone quick on their feet, willing to be a personal assistant, a technical drafter, a researcher, and a little bit of a bodyguard when I need to travel.”
Tony pushed aside the jarred foods and pointed to what looked like an electrical outlet. “I knew this place couldn’t be that Medieval.”
But then Pepper’s text comes back to him:
Steve needed to understand more in-depth how soul packs worked if one of the soul pack died. How much it would affect the others as well as what would happen if he as the leader died. Sure he spent hours of his off time while employed by SHIELD, reading and studying the mechanics of a soul pack. When he had traveled to New York, he visited Wong and received assignments and new reading materials to hunker down to and understand. When he conferred with Wong, they went over the finer details. Again and again, Wong warned him that his pack was scattered and that there would be consequences if he didn’t take things in hand. Their debates and arguments centered on this overarching theme. His stand had always been how could he force people to live a life around the pack? Steve refused to ask people to put aside their wishes and aspirations to follow him on some metaphysical pack. It made no sense to him. In the end, Steve’s ill preparedness fell on his own shoulders. What would happened if one of them died, if he died still hung over his head.  Yet, even now he avoided that information and instead used the phone to search for something else entirely. He input
“It’s all good, Tony.” Pepper smiles. “The Board is flying high because the stock is soaring. Your recent advance in digitalized interface compliance for medical imaging is showing real promise.”
Tony bites back the words again and grumbles a fuck you at Steve. He simply ignores Tony’s protests. “After you.”
“You know, it’s been a while, a long while since I thought of that night.” Tony’s voice softens. “It was a night like this. We were at a party, big one. Holiday. Mom was so happy because she convinced someone – maybe you all might remember – to donate a fashionably high amount to the Foundation. Howard – well, you all knew Howard.”
Tony snapped to focus on Bruce. “Do you understand what the hell is going on?”
“I’m going to have you sleep now, but then I’m going to mount you when you sleep. Would you be amendable to that?”
The doctor glances to the doorway where Steve assumes Bucky is hiding out in the shadows and then back at Steve. “Regardless, I came along for the ride, and now I’m here as well.”
Tony frowns. Dealing with the dead and their ghosts is one thing, handling the ancient living devils is quite a different story.
Tony squirmed inside because he’d tried to retire several times. Being Iron Man had become part of his definition. It was in his blood. Was it an infection or was it written in his DNA? The idea of leaving it behind – that was an entirely different road in life. When he glanced at Steve, a conflict of emotions warred across his features. The same feelings ached in Tony. Envy was an ugly thing, but when it mixed with relief it turned into something sickening.
“God, I hope this isn’t a dream.”
“Geez, Buck spit it out already.”
“No,” Tony said and waved Happy off. “Tank’s all full. No worries about me for a while.”
The knot takes over him again and he falls back into his fugue, not truly knowing what he’s doing as the ravages of his heated blood overwhelm any sense, any logic, rational, or caring mind. He fucks the omega without pause. Time becomes a fleeting, almost imaginary thing as he rides the waves of his orgasms, as the knot comes over him, as he bonds with the omega connected to him. By the end he’s sore. He finally heaves a great thrust as the last of his climax explodes over him until he’s spent and falls onto the man beneath him.
Steve flushes. He feels the slightest pressure of the nanites in his ass and his eyes flutter closed if only for a second. He flashes them open and swallows hard as he tries to control what is body wants and what his mind needs.  He grimaces and says, “I’m not sure this isn’t about you getting what you want.” It’s a taunt and Steve knows it, he waits as Tony’s eyes dilate. It’s nice to know that the prince enjoys someone who won’t always kowtow to him.
Steve moves to formulate words but only a gnarl mutated whine bubbles from his throat.
“Now you got it,” he says and winks at her. They both know his mother’s legacy has been absconded and twisted into a myth. The political forces throughout the Council of Worlds own her now, his memories of her rusted away years ago when they took her and placed her on a pedestal. She became a political tidal wave – pulled by the gravity of others and manipulated to their needs.
“Not really,” Steve said. He didn’t admit that Bruce kind of, maybe read his mind. “I don’t have any idea what the point of all of this is. I haven’t really looked any of it up. I just kind of figured it would sort itself out.”
Tony doesn’t wait for Steve to answer, instead he instructs the landing control that he’ll take a tier on the other side of the bowl. Before there’s an answer, Tony sinks the ship downward and they plunge further away from the station until he brings the nose of the shuttle back up toward Prime so that Steve views the bowl entirely from the underside.
Tony.
Tony doesn’t want to know why the man needs to be soothed or when for that matter. Before he can comment, though, Bruce continues, “No, Tony, listen. It’s the Kiminshy Proposition.”
Steve kisses and nibbles as he finds his way back to Tony’s chest, to his nipples. He lingers over the metal plate, where Tony’s weak heart is protected. He drags his tongue along it and then goes downward again.
He shrugs but feels small and inadequate. Clearly his throat and not looking at Tony, Steve replies, “Just been waiting I guess.”
“I know enough that you invited him into our little pack, didn’t you?” Sam said and turned over Steve’s wrist to display two new marks. One of them connected to the wrist band and wove down but stayed separate from the others. The other one tangled through Steve’s wrist mark and shot through all of the others and continued up Steve’s arm. He peered at it and then realized it didn’t stop on his arm.
“That’s not what the contract said,” Steve replies. “I’d like to talk to Tony.” He tries to get through them, but Rhodes places a hand on Steve’s chest and halts him. Glancing down at his hand, Steve says, “Please remove your hand.”
Irritation leaked into Bruce’s words but Tony realized he didn’t just hear it, he felt the rising tide of Bruce’s anger as he said, “I can’t get in to see him. The doctors are working on him right now.”
“He didn’t even want to be part of the pack.” Steve’s words were muttered but then he turned and focused on them. His face was in shadow.  “She was all I had from my life.”
Tony leans forward, gripping the table. “We’re Avengers. We can’t be hindered by our biology. At any time, we might need to relieve our stress and our needs, so we have an agreement that permits such things.” He stares straight into Ross’ gaze. “It’s allowed. For him. For me.”
“This is a dream,” Tony said with a grin. “At least we won’t die.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony said and glared at him. “But neither of those groups you’re actually a part of so-.”
“I’m sorry I put you in this position,” Steve said. “It wasn’t a choice I made-.”
“What are you going to do now?” Steve has to ask – his life is on the line and his wings as well. The wounds on his back pulse with a fresh ache.
“Animal work? You don’t like animal work?” She was a biologist, wasn’t that something they had to do routinely. They might not like it, but it was something that was kind of required.
“Omegas kind of creep me out.” She tugs up her hood and he chuckles a little at her. She looks ridiculous. He shrugs on the jacket but doesn’t lift the hood even after she frowns at him. She’s his friend not his mother.
Steve hadn’t recognized it then, not at all. Until this moment, reconsidering his life he hadn’t known the truth of the young bachelors. His mother must have known, and still she invited them to dinner. It wasn’t revelation, but maybe his eyes opened a little more as he considered his life. A life lived in a different time, but time moves on and people change. Understandings evolve. Was he right to cling to something once ingrained in him, or was he foolish not to move forward and accept his life as it was right now?
“Truthfully?”
When Tony inquires with the US Army, they regret to inform him that there is no such person as Captain Steven Rogers assigned to try and rescue him from his captivity at the hands of the Ten Rings. He gets nowhere fast with General Ross. Eventually he taps his resources with Rhodey and begs him to search for the records.
“Does SHIELD know about the whole thing?” Tony asks, being careful about his words. He suspects the place is bugged.
He taps his implant and says, “Message to James Barnes. Bring up contacts.” The implant beeps softly in his ear to verify it has selected the correct person. It then beeps twice to start the recording. “Hey Buck. Good to hear from you. Sorry that things aren’t going as well out there. Wish I could help. But then I am helping in a way. Out on Prime Station I’ve been temporarily assigned to the Stark Fleet, doing some support work. It’s a great experience. I like the new position. Stark is a great advocate for the Beyond Regions too. So, hoping we’ll get some help for Peggy and Mike. When you get closer in, drop me a line, then we can talk in real time.” He ends the message and sends it. It’s not lying – exactly.
Tony rushed to Steve’s side and searched for any sign, any molecule of life. It ebbed away, leaking like the blood staining the rocks below Steve. Kneeling, Tony reached out with his soul and the tattered remains answered him.
“Which is something similar to what you experienced when Blu the lion transformed into Captain Rogers.”
“There’s no such thing as magic, just science we don’t understand,” he says in rote. “Something, some elemental force held you, changed you, and now you’re back.”
“Always good to know,” Steve replied. “Thank you for what you did for Clint. For what you did for the pack. That wasn’t easy.” The images like phantoms hung close to the living.
“Yes, sometimes,” Tony says and it feels like he’s admitting something to Steve, but he cannot fathom what it might be. He snaps out of his reverie and says, “You and your deputy come out here for the fresh air?”
Sam raised an eyebrow and scoffed. “Yeah, but everyone knows it’s not a real thing.”
Those simple words set in motion a new path to venture down. Steve cringed to himself and ground his teeth. Another question was all that he needed right now. He should probably excuse himself and just go and get the Mantra over with, though Wong repeatedly taught him that the Mantra wasn’t burden, a chore to be completed but something to find solace and comfort and mindfulness in. It took months to figure it out.
Tony felt his cheeks color and he’d shaken his head. “Spunk is come, and the thought-.”
Steve giggled – actually giggled – at him. “No. But I want to. I really want to. Maybe you could.” Steve dropped his head back onto the couch. “Maybe you-.”
“No,” Ross said. “You’re not done. All the way. That was the deal. All the way.”
Maybe Pierce weighed in to defuse the situation. Steve didn’t know but as Pierce stared out across the Potomac River below the Triskelion he said, “Sometimes to build a better world, it means tearing the old one down. And that makes enemies.” Turning to look at Steve, Pierce sized him up and then added, “I wonder, Captain, where do you stand? On the side of progress and a better world or on the side of stagnation where the status quo will surely tear the world apart.”
“Oh no. I had it for my birthday.” Steve sinks further into the chair. Tony doesn’t think he could possibly curl up further. “Just a quiet get together. No big deal or anything.” He waves his hands like he’s trying to erase everything he’s just said.
Strange cocked an eyebrow. “Then I suggest you find him.”
Of course, the easiest way out is the one way that Tony can’t bear to handle. It means confrontation and that face off might expose truths that Tony just might not be able to handle at the moment. “Not yet. I need your opinion first.”
“He used his helmet, didn’t he?” Rhodes concludes.
"I always come through Obie, you know that." For some reason when Obie slings his arm around his shoulders, all Tony wants to do is shrug it off. Not able to without evoking a full-fledged interrogation from Obie, he withstands it and suppresses the shiver of revulsion.
“He’s asleep now,” Steve says and Natasha nods. There’s a worn look about everyone, the town’s about had it with the drama. They all look threadbare and beaten. It must be Schmidt behind the attack, trying to scare them enough to make it impossible to fight back.
“That’s all dancing has to be sometimes.” Tony must suddenly come to himself, because he drops Steve’s hands and steps away. “Hopefully, we’re not going to dance off the cliff.”
“That’s what I understand as well, why are you here?”
The images flicker over his brain and he flies, soaring over the twilight landscape below. HE searches for something, someone and someone lost. He tries to track his missing half soul with the HUD, but then realizes there is no suit, no armor, no HUD. He’s flying freely. He’s a bird, dark feathered and mesmerizing in the evening light. He lands near the edge of the stream he knows well.
“Thor, I don-.” What could he say? He knew little of Asgard and the greater worries of the Nine Realms. He always wanted to know more. When Thor spoke of his home he always fell into a quiet reserved demeanor. Thor tended to keep his memories and stories about Asgard to the minimum and Steve suspected it might be due to the fact any mention of his home brought back the guilt of his abandoned responsibilities.
“Not for you to take on the whole of Schmidt’s gang to save the entire town, Steve. We can all just move on.” Bucky says and pours some water from the pitcher. “Drink.”
“Don’t have to.”
For ages he’s known one truth. It happened long before Tony snapped his fingers but also at that moment as well. When Tony expired, Steve transformed into a dying soul living in a dying husk. Escaping to the past and living on the Garden had been his only reprieve. Separating himself from the world he defended because the one he loved no longer survived had been his punishment.
Bucky laughs. “Well, take cover, we’re coming out and we’re not leaving any prisoners.”
CHAPTER 9
“Come on Steve, let’s learn some new stuff together. New. Exciting. Fuck me right here on your desk and you’ll understand incidence and risk and ratios and everything.”
“It would mean he can access our neurons and I don’t think that’s possible. The cradle uses vibranium, sure, but also a biomatrix. He can’t read neurons.”
Steve smiles. “Once Sarah sleeps better.”
“Soon, what?” Tony says and jumps up. “How do you know?”
“The God Machine. The reason they need the Perfect Seed. The seed in the central core of the God Machine makes the Ornari sentient beings. So that means someone made the God Machine and the bio-organic? Is that the word? The bio-organic stuff that made up the tendrils or whatever they were of the Ornari.” Steve kisses Tony’s temple. “It means-.”
“No,” Steve gasps as Natasha digs around some more. “Geez, watch out, I’d like to be able to feel my fingers after you’re done.”
“Wow,” Tony says in a low whisper. “All those stories, all that stuff in the news about your phobia of snow and cold.”
“Yeah, he did. Military is verifying. Also the higher ups are not too pleased to know that some of their orders came from Hydra.”
“Joffery knows me too well. He’s been around. Doesn’t stay in one place at all. Been at a lot of different conferences. He follows around like a groupie for a band,” Tony says and smiles. “But my favorite comfort food. Soup and bread. Also some tea.”
“Please do. How’s it going?”
“Steve,” Tony says and sits up. He doesn’t want to cool off the moment, but as he said there are practicalities. “I want you to listen to me. If we do this, then I want to know how far you want to go.   What you want to do. I don’t want to assume something and have this all come crashing down on our heads. It’s too important to me.”
“Come on, Blu. We have to find water.”
“Strange choice.”
“She’s an Avenger. I’m not surprised that you would bond with your team, your soul pack.” Fury sat up straighter in the chair, leaning his elbows on the desk. “This is your first step, Captain. The world around you changed, but this, this will guide you.”
“There’s more?” Steve asked.
Steve doesn’t budge and it pisses Tony off. “I thought we were playing hooky.”
“God, he was a dick.” Tony sits up and slides to the side of the bed. “He was always snapping his fingers at me, talking like he had some destiny. He freaked me out.”
“I’m not hungry,” Tony says but his stomach aches.
“Go ahead, you can eat.”
He taps the glass topped desk that still has nothing on it. “Yes, very official.” He rarely works in his office. He prefers his laboratory, two floors down.
“What’s that?”
“I promised you the same thing,” Steve said. He had. As caretaker, as mate, it was his duty.
Another one that went straight to his chest. He didn’t know Steve, not at all. He didn’t know the leader of the Avengers. “Well, we’re a bunch of bastards now when it comes to manners. What can I do for you?” Tony asked. He both wanted to flee the call and to sit here and bask in it. Steve looked great. That dark dying part of him, settled in his core, lifted its head. It felt like sunlight.
Steve inhaled sharply, and then went to a cleared space on one of the many worktables. “I wanted to tell you something. It’s not going to be easy for you to hear but in light of the fact Bucky could show up at any time, I think you have a right to know my suspicions.”
Then they captured Sitwell, and the intersection of their lives and Hydra’s purpose happened on the causeway. Natasha had called him the Winter Soldier, but Steve might have named him Death’s Knight. The fierceness of his attack launched Steve off the highway and through the window of a bus. Even as he picked himself up in the wreckage he felt the strings of flight and fear race through the bonds from both Sam and Natasha, though both of them managed to quell their panic and stay battle ready.  Steve easily put down his attackers but then he felt the punch to his right shoulder as if he’d been shot and he knew through the ache of the bond that Natasha faltered and hid from the Winter Soldier.  In a mad dash, Steve bolted over to her and stopped the Winter Soldier with shield to his fist. Each hit, each fist, and knife thrust blocked and avoided brought them to a strange and horrible equilibrium. Evenly matched, Steve sought to find an inroad, a weakness. But then the weakness exposed was his own, when the Soldier’s mask came off and Steve stood dumbfounded in the middle of the street staring at his friend, his brother, Bucky Barnes. Only Sam’s appearance on the scene and Natasha’s firing of bazooka saved Steve as the shock deafened him to the din of the world around him.
Tony inhaled, held it, and then released it, cooling off the moment. “Listen, we don’t even know one another. Not all that well. Right now, the universe might tell us one thing-.”
He checks his belt along the back for his grenades. They’re all tucked in and in place. The Guard might not have a lot of supplies but he’s been able to scare up some nice grenades, assault blasters, and some stingers for good measure. They won’t get a signal from Clint saying whether or not he’s gotten away and to the rendezvous point; they are on radio silence.
“Hey, I don’t think we qualify for that,” Tony said as his laughter faded, but he didn’t move away. He snuggled closer.
Tony grimaced. A smartass AI was just what he didn’t need right now. Tony waved off JARVIS and his nonsensical explanations. The AI surely needed an upgrade. “I gotta shower. I’ll be there in 5.”
“Lights.”
“Okay, then.” Steve continue to kiss him but the necking transforms as he slowly tastes and attends every part of Tony’s body, setting nerves into overdrive. His body like a race car waiting for the gun roars with life and need. It is too much and too little all at the same time.
Even as he finishes up with setting the initialization program in the computer, Tony catches Steve shivering through another racking spear of pain. He cannot do this, he can't. There's not a way for Steve to survive this hell.
Steve glances around the room, but cannot find any sign of Tony’s manservant and he wonders when the man slipped out. He lowers his gaze again and his heart burns fire in his chest so much it feels like his breathing problems all over again. “You’re right,” Steve says and his own voice sounds so very far away. “Yes, you’re right. I came here for you. I came here for this, but now-.” He hates being a coward.
“That’s different.”
Blu mumbles a growl.
“Was that a V-Corps phone or your personal phone?” Clint asked as they made their way down the street.
The shudder through Steve could have halted Tony’s motion, but instead it only urged him on, to touch, to kiss. He pulled Steve into an embrace and guided him down to his lips. Steve resisted at first, but then relaxed. The kiss transformed the awkward, hesitant kisses from before – this kiss devoured and hungered. Tony thought to freeze, to let Steve decided how far, how deep to take the kiss, but the little moans and then raking of Steve’s hands down Tony’s back pushed him farther toward active pursuit. Tony pressed, and Steve’s mouth opened to accept him. The taste of Steve, the touch of his mouth, the weight of his body against Tony’s sent ripples of excitement through him. They melted against one another, Tony thrilled to it and let his body lead while he stretched back and found the threads of their souls harmonizing together. As if it was second nature, he wove them together and in response, Steve moaned and shivered against Tony. They stumbled, and Tony moved backwards toward the ratty couch in the workshop. Steve didn’t stop.
The guy doesn’t answer him because he’s headed toward what Tony surmises is the bathroom to fetch the first aid kit. It’s Steve who’s still lagging behind him who answers, “It was an old brownstone. Other floors are just one flat except this floor.”
Tony looks around and then shrugs. “Well, it doesn’t matter as long as we don’t go through the exit Door. Every which way should lead us to the Hub.”
“A nurse, huh?”
Logan pipes in with a low growl that might be the word – shit – Tony’s not sure.
Steve hides his smile behind the soup spoon. He shouldn’t be smiling, not today, not when Bucky is as good as lost. Instead, he eats and then says, “Ma used to make a stew when we could afford the meat. Usually she ended up watering it down – when we could afford the water.” He laughs a little, but it falls flat. “It was good. She tried her best and I think that’s all we can do. Isn’t it?”
He laughs, a small almost silent sound. “Well, I’m sure he is, too. But I was talking about Tony. He’s very fond of you.”
“No bother, it might be nice to see you fuck him,” Estane says. “A little show for my omega Stalls, since you never have the belly for it.” His gut twists as Estane speaks. Pointing to Tony, Estane says, “Get him some fucking pants. This one deserves no clothes. He stays naked.” Estane lifts his boot and then steps on Steven’s penis, pressing his entire weight. Only a whisper of a cry bubbles out of Steven’s mouth. Blood leaks from his lips.
“Hmm. No? They’re in your bedroom in the nightstand drawer.”
It was only three years ago he lost Bucky and downed the Valkyrie – at least by his counting. He doesn’t have much left of who he was anymore. Back then, he hid a lot of who he was, even from Bucky. Steve wraps his arms around himself, the cold creeps in like it always does. Maybe at one time, he might have had a chance to change the path he’d picked but not anymore. With a quick glance he checks on Tony, who seems to be sleeping. Steve will never know how it feels to sleep next to him, to listen to the rise and fall of his chest, to know that warm body close to him, how it means the world.
Later that night he dreams of Blu. He’s reclining against Blu, staring out at their little stream. It’s a pleasantly warm day and he sighs in his happiness. He could stay here all day, forever. Blu laps once at him, his tongue rough but not painful. Tony playfully bats him away.
“He’s my Omega. We’re bonded.” Tony grits his teeth but before he can spew out any further protests Ross holds up his hands.
"How the hell do you move that thing?"
“But Howard.”
“Yes.” Tony reaches and steals a few grapes. “A few years back a case went up to the Supreme Court about religious institutes openly supporting political candidates. The religious side said that it was there freedom of speech and freedom of religion – their first amendment rights. Well, the Court say it differently. While they agreed that they had the right to express their first amendment rights, they also said that they were then liable for all the rights, privileges and responsibilities of any lobbying group. In other words, they would be taxed. That shut up the religious right and gay marriage, transgender rights, everything just fell into place. It’s amazing when you have a strong and impartial Supreme Court what you can do. How the world can change.”
“But why her? Why do you follow her?”
When he opens his eyes again, she’s still there. Her glance shifts to the room, and the bed, and then back to him. “Don’t take too long. I need someone to hold him down while I get the poison out.”
Fury and Nat shared a look and then Nat turned to Tony. “He’s not dead. We made it look that way to make sure that Rumlow and Pierce didn’t know. He’s on the run with Bucky and Clint.”
Steve’s already carved the chicken and placed it on a platter. “Let’s just bring the food to the table.”
As a child, sure, he’d heard of them, but now he knew that was some kind of different memory. A fake one that had been implanted in his head since Strange’s encounter with the celestial being. He feared all of his memories might be fake. But the ones of his mother couldn’t be, could they? As a sick little boy, she leaned over his bed and brushed his hair back, sang him songs from the old country, and told him tales of soul packs in ancient days. Were all of those memories false? What was a soul pack? What did it mean for him as an individual?
“Tony,” Pep hisses.
The windows became startlingly clear. The light streaming in from the city and glinting off of the skyscrapers nearly blinded him. Steve rubbed at his eyes and said, “Wow, the Tower?”
He acquiesces to her request, because he always should. “Can you get me Dummy, please?”
Steve yanked away from them, glaring at Natasha. “No. No, we’re not. Not him. Not us. Never!” He went to the table. Looked at what was left of his friend. A holograph hanging above Sam monitored what little life was left – not much. Just a beat or two. Steve looked down at Sam through tears. The medical personnel stopped their work, frozen as he stood there, staring at the last vestiges of life. Steve placed his hand on what little remained of Sam’s face.
At 4 o’clock in the afternoon Tony’s private jet takes off. They’ll land in Newfoundland and then take a boat out to his island the next day.  Technically, he doesn’t own the island. It’s under Canada’s jurisdiction, but everything on the island is owned by Stark Industries and his personal estate. It’s in the low 70sF, around 22C, when the boat launches and Steve is standing at the bow of the boat, the waves crashing.  The air whips his hair around and Tony joins him. He’s still wearing his glasses and knows when they step foot on the island, he has to part with them. The weeks without them hopefully, will give him a break and will allow for him to wear the glasses for a prolonged period of time during the gala.
He settled on the floor of the cell, his feet still burning from the transformation. Every shot of light like a pixel around him shone bright and pierced his vision. The resolution, the contrast, was all too real, too perfect in their aspect to take in at once. Every cell of his body spoke to him. The sensitivity overload might drive him mad, but he concentrated instead on Steve huddled nearly unconscious on the floor.
Tony busies himself with the fire, only furtively glancing over at Steve who spends his time working on the pan and then pouring the water for the tea when the kettle whistles. He places the mugs and the plate with the sandwiches on a tray and brings them over to the living room area. He doesn’t set them in front of the fire, but choses the less casual, less romantic space at the couch. He settles across from the couch in a recliner. Tony accepts it and then takes his seat across from Steve on the couch.
“I’m glad you stopped me,” Steve said, and he raised his eyes to look at Tony, but then dropped them to stare at his hands again. “Not that I don’t want to. It’s just that I have to take steps. You know?  It was great kissing you. Made me feel like it’s the right thing for me. But I need to take those steps. Okay?” He hissed. “I don’t want to lose you or this that we’re building because of my stupid prejudices.”
“How?”
“I should be able to do it, just focus on yourself,” Steve says and grabs hold of the saddle’s horn. With a great heave, he swings onto the saddle. It isn’t graceful or powerful, but it’s sufficient to get him seated again on the horse.
“No. No he won’t.” Nothing will earn his freedom.
She calls herself Natasha.
“Why would Tony Stark one of the richest men in the country if not the world outside royalty want to be a blacksmith and come to our little town?” Steve says. “And he doesn’t even use his own contact information. It’s the doctor’s name and city.”
Chuckling, Tony helps Steve up to the beach. Steve waits on the patio, stretching out his healing wings as much as he dares to dry them in the warm sun. Tony stands behind him, concentrating on his wings. Steve feels that pleasure again, that pride to know that Tony might just admire his grand wings. They are bigger than any he’s seen before. As they dry Tony reaches out and strokes them, tentatively at first, and then moves to caress them as Steve relaxes into his touch.
Tony smirked. “Could you imagine if we were con artists, what we could get away with? Ocean’s 11 move aside.”
As they enter Tony’s quarters, a hazy of longing settles over Steve. He wants to make this last. Yet at the same time, his appetite drives him mad with desire and hunger. Even with his smaller frame, Steve pushes Tony up against the door and tears at his clothes, kissing, nipping, and licking his way down to his trousers. Kneeling before Tony, Steve opens the trousers and releases his hard cock. When Steve looks up at Tony, his face turns to the side, eyes close and mouth opens with a wicked moan. He should have been prepared, a condom in hand, but he has nothing, and he doesn’t care. He’s breaking all the rules for the prince.
Tony had gotten to his feet and stood beside Steve. He gazed out of the window. “How do we do that?”
“Sentinel,” Steve said. His knees gave out unexpectedly and he dropped to the floor, banging his forehead against the gurney. Tony was next to him with his hand on Steve’s shoulder. Steve looked up to find Bruce standing there or the Hulk – a mix of both of them and then he settled back to the mild mannered doctor again.
Getting across town and to Steve's rundown apartment takes more time than it should considering the hour. He trudges up the creaking wooden steps to Steve’s floor and looks at his phone. It's eleven ten. Sure any sex worker is on the streets right now, but he was supposed to be here by nine. That means he didn't buy the entire night. That means Steve probably had other clients. That thought curdles his hours-old dinner in his belly.
“I get it,” Bruce said. The silence dropped over them and all Steve could hear was the little beeps and the whispered awe of the doctors outside the curtain. He couldn’t stand it.
Too far, too distant. His heart aches.
“No, I’m good.” Tony holds up his one hand and Steve notices it shakes. “Had my maggot infested crap earlier. I’m all filled up.”
“For how long are we safe?” Steve muttered. He sat up and Tony could tell by the way he rapidly blinked his eyes that he was in the midst of a dizzy spell brought on by lightheadedness. Even with the serum, Steve needed an extra boost now and then to deal with the blood loss. A lot of vampires supplemented their mates’ diets with raw meats, iron, and omega 3 fatty acids in order to ensure a strong hemoglobin count and immune system.
“No, the nuns did. I know what I am, I know what is wrong with me, that I’m cursed for it-.”
It's Darcy who appears at the top of the stairs, her hands are bloody and her eyes dark. "He wants you."
The AI answers, “I’ve call the Administrator. He has called your Master of the Fleet. Both are on their way and will be happy to assist you.”
“Don’t worry.” Steve straightens as much as he can, trying to see. He wiggles his butt against the shield and that sends shockwaves through Tony. The shield starts to slide. “Here we go.”
Tony startled and jerked around to find Steve standing at the entrance to the study.
“Let’s get this over with,” he side mouths to Pep.
For a moment he nearly topples into the trap, plummets down the slope, falls into the arms of the despair waiting for him at the periphery. Inwardly, he grapples and holds on to his composure, though he feels the hot prickle of pain, the sweat of nights spent alone and longing. He clears his throat and walks to the windows again.
Blu nuzzles him next to his shoulder, yawns, but then gets back to his work of licking Tony all over. It’s terrifying and disgusting. When Tony shifts to move slowly away, the big paw squashes his movements and presses too firmly on his ribs. He moans at the touch and Blu eases his pressure. Blu stares down at him as if assessing his wounds, then tenderly licks the blood from Tony’s head.  Blu’s tongue lingers near Tony’s pulse point on his neck. Holding his breath, Tony cringes as he waits for the fatal bite.
"Big ass? Who the hell has the big ass?" Bucky laughs as Sam swings forward to dump him into the turret of the tower.
“That’s putting it nicely and, I was lucky, I had a gal that sent food and supplies. Prisoners that had family to help out ended up better than the others,” Steve says, trying to ignore the memories of the Raiders and how they’d extorted what they wanted.
“I look forward to it. And Tony?” Pepper adds. “Please get some rest. It’s going to be a stressful few days.”
“Tell me about it. Wong is so much better,” Steve agreed. “Do you want to just try and chant or should we?”
“Close in. Iron Man take them out at the water’s edge.”
“And what comes next?” Tony shook his head as he picked apart the shaft of a grass blade. “I don’t know.”
The mysterious Soul Keeper had once told him, “The Silver Knight must never fall to the Red Knight. If the Silver Knight falls, the whole of the Soul Realm will disintegrate and all the souls within my protection will be destined to become the demon Outriders. You know what to do?”
“Nice?” Tony huffs at him. “It’s spectacular. The high tech imagery and effects are outstanding. State of the art really. Of course, the art is kind of old considering-.”
It always jerked away from the dreams before the rest of the memory or story. It hated the rest. The final chapters existed inside the cage, or at the table where the experiments happened. No hope or reality happened outside of the prison cell. Not since it acquiesced to the pain, to the torture, to Stark.
She must give Steve the small transponder that she holds in her pocket at all times. Dummy works off it as do the glasses and other devices Tony designed.
“What?” Tony narrowed his sights on Bruce. “You’re not… you’re worried?”
He hits the comm switch and smiles. No one is going to answer. Yet a voice echoes in the darkness.
“I’m getting to that, I swear.”
As he walks down the tunnel his hands sweat and his nerves jitter. Not many people are going in the same direction. Most are probably not even going for a presentation or urgency. Most are probably employed at the blocks. He finds his way to the entrance which isn’t hard because it is a large double door. Opening it, he enters the lobby. There’s a reception desk and waiting area. It radiates calm with its cool blue and light green colors. There’s a fish tank and several broad leaf palm plants. A few couches with tables next to them as well as an area to get coffee or tea are placed in the waiting room. He goes to the reception area and stands there, displaced. The whole place with its soft music and quiet atmosphere makes him feel all the more alone.
They mean to take him alive; they mean to turn his heart and soul. They mean to ruin him. He has no other choice. As the Silver Knight he represents the paragon of everything in this realm that is good and right and perfect. If taken by the Red Knight, the world surrenders to the chaos of the demons. He has no other choice, but the cliffs, the ravine. He must do this – he must sacrifice all that he is to save the promise of the new world.
Tony cringed at the term but kept his outward appearance immobile. Before Cathy led Thor away, Tony managed to a little grunt that stopped her. His whole being locked like someone had glued him together and he’d never move again. Through sheer willpower, Tony tore away at the overwhelming sensation of paralysis and said, “What about St-Steve? Captain Rogers?”
He sighs and walks to the table. The data hovering over the table clearly shows the Carbonelli family tree as well as the Stark family tree. Interesting.
At the table sits Natalie and Clyn, Furin and Marya, Thor with the warrior Sif and then Tony along with Steven. Over the course of the next hours they discuss the upcoming Council of Worlds and Tony makes his case to be in the High Alpha Chair. There is little dissent.
Tony? What the hell was the universe thinking when it linked him to both of them?
Powerful. Deadly. How could they possibly bring her into the pack when she’d been tutored by Hydra itself? And then Tony’s focus went to Bucky – Brother – his brother in the pack and now part of his family. A man who killed his mother by strangling her.  He had Bucky in his sights, just meters away as he swooped down to intervene with the battle in the bailey of the fortress. He could literally blow the man to hell. His nerves fired, and his brain ached. In the near distance he heard JARVIS calling him, trying to yank him out of his fugue. Nothing could. The visions came to him, filtering from the bond itself, as if he tapped into a subconscious part of Bucky’s brain and relived the memories. Felt Bucky’s
“Yes.”
“How do you-.”
“You should, and you did. Now what do you need?” Sam crossed his arms over his chest and stood – no arguments were to be made.
An image of Tony pops into his head and he turns his face away, trying to smother the yearning. He remembers the first time, how almost professional Tony was about the presentation, how easy it was for Steve to drop to his knees in front of him. How he wanted more than anything to be put into the cage.
It seems a little off to say the least. The older boy’s Companion looks like a large dog, almost like a wolf but not that big. He's a fine white and gray color that borders on silver. On the top of his forehead though a patch of fur that's rusty in color forms an almost perfect star. He's a healthy Soul Companion except for the missing leg. When Steve looks at the boy he notes the boy has both arms and both legs. Most of the time a Companion mirrored the soul it belonged to - Steve's does.
Clint lifts his chin in greeting and scrubs at his eyes. He looks like a dog walked all over him, used him as a chew toy, and then spit him out. “Coffee?”
Throwing himself on the bed, he stares at the exposed beams. It’s beautiful if a little too rustic for Tony’s tastes. He’s all clean lines and metal. The warmth of wood and the texture of roughness presents a different picture – one of nature and hominess. Tony never really known home; it’s a foreign concept to him.
“Fuck you, Brock.” Steve clenched his teeth and shivered as Rumlow widened the hole.
When they disembarked, Steve gravitated to Tony’s side and they ended up sharing a car together to get to the hotel that JARVIS had booked. Steve only mumbled a few words now and again, and once they were checked in, he said his goodnights and went to his room without a further word.
She grips his hand and comforts him. “No. It is not Valhalla, though that realm is not your Christian idea of heaven. I don’t think any of us truly understand the nature of death.” She pats his hand. “I arrived after my ascension and knew that was something wrong because the way to Valhalla was blocked.”
Tony laughs and drags Steve into the room. “Glasses, please?” When Steve doesn’t immediately respond, Tony taps his shirt. “Glasses.”
Tony crosses the gap between them in two wide strides and rips the phone out of Steve’s hand. He stares at the text from Natasha. It’s simple, straightforward, and devious.
Steve tries not to smile, but it’s hard to suppress it. “He takes care of you like you’re his son.”
“A little over two months. I applied to the brothel and they accepted me. I was a little surprised since I’m not formally trained. Not really.” Sure, he spent time with the training vids, but the truth is most of what he does he’s just naturally inclined to.
“SHIELD?” Pepper asks. Her voice radiates tension.
“Not as a soldier, as some kind of special government envoy,” Steve says. “Just another name for -.”
“You don’t have to worry, Pepper. This is the first time in a long time, I think I know what I’m doing.” He plays with the pen on her desk.
They spent a little more time in each other’s arms, but then cleaned up as much as they could in the barn and hustled over to the house. Once there they took turns showering and then went to the kitchen for breakfast. Clint was cooking again, and Steve went to help as Tony and Bruce huddled in the corner making plans for their war games today.
“Eat, you need your strength.” Tony offers him the fruit and Steve takes it. He shuffles a little to the side to welcome Tony to sit next to him on the bed.
“Go there and your strength will be purged. Go there and your soul tarnished. You will no longer be the champion of the Realm. You will be tainted,” the Soul Keeper had said to him. “There the tortured souls of the Realm reside – they have been turned by the Red Knight himself. You know this. Do not go there.”
“Nice to meet you both,” Steve says and shakes the offered hand with a nod to Janet.
“I’m not going anywhere, and I don’t think you’re in any shape to make me leave.” He marches into the tiny bathroom. It’s so tight and cramped, he hates it. “You have a first aid kit or something.”
Steve gasped out a cry. “Why? I just wanted to see you, to feel you.”
Steve settled back in the chair at his kitchen table. He spread out the papers again and his writing tablet. “Well you are not the first to tell me that, but I don’t know Sam. Everyone’s happy.” That – right there, he told himself was the overstatement of the century.
Tony curls over Steve as he hunches over his desk. There are books everywhere - open and highlighted in brilliant colors of yellow, orange, purple. All the colors are there in all their garish beauty. Steve’s been at it - studying for his college freshman finals for the last five hours. Tony’s never seen anyone so intense.
“If you say so, sir,” Rumlow said and stood at ease, as if he’d been in the military. Ross assessed Steve one last time. “We’ll make sure he’s not dead.”
Shaking, Tony bends and places his mouth against the sweet gland. He feels like he’s straddling two different worlds. The Steven he saw at the meeting was strong and powerful while this Steven is broken and shattered.
“Parameters show Cint’s cagey about details. He disappears, he doesn’t always answer direct questions. So the equations can’t be fully resolved. More so than even Nat. She seems to know something about it and I can’t figure it out.”
“Yeah.” Steve hasn’t touched his sketchpad yet.
“Well, there goes the honeymoon, darling,” Tony says and winks at Steve – who is sitting frozen, staring at his huge breakfast.
“Please sit. We’ll go over the choices here,” she says and settles back in her chair. Steve sits down too, but on the edge of the cushion.
Steve makes a little noise of surprise and then waves away the comment. “No. No, just excited about the room and a little startled by, you know, the lady in the ceiling.”
Clint winked at Natasha and she only smirked while he answered, “Yeah.”
“I’m pretty sure they’re not-.” Steve said, but Tony wasn’t listening. It was his turn to race around the living room.
“Yes.” He doesn’t even know who won.
There’s something worming its way up his nostril and down his throat. He tugs at it, gags. His eyes water. He chokes and bile burns again. Yanking with a fierceness he does not possess, Tony slides the tubing from his nostril and out of his throat. He gasps out a sob and there are hands on him. A voice – tilted with a slight accent – tells him to rest. He’s been injured, he needs to rest before they come.
“We don’t know,” Bruce replied. “The doctors are still running some tests to make sure they didn’t miss anything.”
“Okay.” Steve stands up as Tony does.
Steve read some of the stories about Howard and Tony’s relationship. “Did you argue over how to deal with the Conclave?”
“And Clint?” Natasha says and while she’s not backing down, she’s listening to reason. Russians when it comes right down to it, are a pragmatic people. That’s one good thing about Natasha, she’s a business woman, shrewd, cunning, and reads people like others read the newspaper. And she’s Russian.
In his hands he touches the key to his salvation. He trembles as he caresses, the fear of loss so potent and ever present. Lying side by side, Steve grasps his hands and kisses each finger then each palm.
“Jarvis is playing mother hen mixed with a mafia godfather.” Tony manages a distinct glare of his own at his butler. Jarvis just waves it off and excuses himself. “You’ll have to excuse him. He’s a little touchy over this. We have to broaden my circle of people who know. He agrees he’s just -.”
Scanning the skies, he tries to glimpse how the outside battle progressed, but he cannot catch a clue as the fortress looms to one side and the rocky slope up to the wooded area covers the rest. The river drains toward the rendezvous point, so he heads in that direction. Redwing speeds ahead of them, chirping and looping downward. Bucky’s sure the bird is on the lookout for Sam. The two are inseparable like Bucky and Steve used to be, before he lost Steve, before this damnable year passed.
It might be an antiquated system of justice that the human hub considers polite society, but it is dictated by biology. The Council of Worlds is ruled by alphas and thus reign over the whole of the human worlds. There had been a time that betas ruled on Ancient Earth, but eventually humans saw the errors in their ways. Infighting killed beta rule eventually, and the world turned back to logic and alphas as human took to the stars. Or so they say. The myths are muddled. The order of society – its way, its rules, and its dictates enabled humanity to flourish and to escape the confines of the ancient world. The order of society has become their crutch, An’Tony worries, and he’s said it more than once at polite society functions. It’s gotten him a very distinct and bad boy reputation on at the Council and throughout the Lanes. Some say he’s charming and mysterious. Others judge him and want to throw him with the rest of the dregs of humanity out on the Purge Rim systems – so far out from the inner core and the Council that there’s no protection. He wonders if that’s not a better way to live instead of this – whatever this is. He’s been to the edge of the Purge, seen some of it. But he has to admit, he doesn’t remember a lot of his youthful days filled with drink and drugs. He partied and played.
“If you resist, then it’s going to be worse for you and worse for your boy.”
He looked between them, trying to read the inscrutable. Shaking his head, Steve said, “Okay, who is this person?”
Strange huffs in little grunts – Tony easily recognizes them. The arrogant doctor has a habit of puffing out groans and grunts when he’s taxed by his patients or their family members. “I assure you that Tony is not in any danger. We will run imaging tests, but I suspect that problem will be the implant.”
“Don’t believe a word of it. Don’t believe your eyes. It’s not real. You’re stuck in the Hub. You need to get out before the worm finishes infecting Ultron.” Steve can see through Tony’s image. He sees the door behind him. “Steve, can you hear me?”
“Jesus,” Tony muttered. He sat up but dropped back down as the room spun around and he gagged a little. He covered his face with his hands and tried to settle his nausea. What the hell just happened? “JARVIS, what time is it?”
“There’s always chocolate cake,” Tony snickers and then taps the desktop with Dummy. “Lead the way, Steve.”
“Well, that good, because I’m family.”
Steve touches Tony’s face, tenderly, softly and whispers, “Tony. Tony, I dreamed of you since the first time I met you. But I can’t have you. I can’t, because they want you. One way or another they’re going to get you. I’ve tried to protect you. This was the perfect way. They would never suspect it. Who would think that the prostitute that you were seeing was -.” He stops.
“We need a plan.” Steve relaxes but still yanks Tony over to a thicket of wildflowers and weeds. “Why the hell is the outer rim of Ultron’s consciousness Barton’s farm?”
Tony eases up on his elbows. “You’re fucking kidding me. You’re telling me this hole in the center of the Earth is real. You’re real. And that fucking lion is real.”
“We were able to save you. I’m not sure,” Steve continued. “How you feel now, but I wanted to thank you again. You put yourself on the line for me and for Clint. You didn’t have to do that, and they came after you because of that.”
“No, sir, I have a special message from Doctor Banner,” Jarvis says.
A helicopter swooped down and a gunner leaned out of the side, targeting the car. “Hold on!” Steve rammed his foot onto the accelerator, flooring it. The car pitched over the bumpy road, spiking into the air and landing with a jarring crash. His vision blacked out for a second – something that never occurred anymore since Project Rebirth. Now, Steve found himself gasping for air and willing his heart to slow down. The pain in his chest spread and tightened at the same time. He sped the Audi down through the forested road. Thankfully the trees offered cover from the aerial attack.
“Good, good,” Bruce said. He pointed at Tony. “How about you?”
“He’s a wanted criminal,” Sam said.
“Yeah?” Sam furrowed his brows and didn’t comment. He side-eyed Natasha, who’d stopped what she was doing and watched Steve.
The lights went down and the click of the doors locking echoed in the workshop. The sparkling of the starry projection shined like a thousand blue and white candles over them. Tony spotted the glints of the lights reflected in Steve’s eyes. Even as he noted it, Steve said, “The whole universe.”
“Really? I’m not really. I’m surprised you even made it.” He finishes tearing off leaves of lettuce.
The progress they made with their relationship (could he call it that?) might very well have been responsible for the fact Tony walked into the Tower on lighter feet.  Suddenly the world as a part of a soul pack and as the designated Beloved transformed into something different, something unexplored and exciting. Tony always loved the idea of exploring. In his heart of hearts he named himself an explorer. He explored science and technology. He explored ways towards peace. He explored what the future might bring. The soul pack and his link to Steve offered him a new kind of investigation. He relished it.
With hard furrowed brows, Tony bows his head and grasps the reins. He lets them hang but keeps them tucked into his gloved hands.
As Tony tugged away from Bruce’s grasp, the other man held tight. “What do you mean?”
The worlds in the Purge Rim and the Lanes suffered from over population, lack of clean water, poorly structured cities. The refuse of humanity lived in squalor.
“Radio silence,” Steve ordered and then used the soul pack connections to check on his team. Thor wrangled the rest of the Legion toward them while Iron Man tried to pick them off one by one, but there were too many to stop.
Steve studied the group as they stood around the counter and waited. He should talk with Bucky -
Standing by the door, Steve tried to smile and at the same time show no aggressive action. He’d never been with an alpha – or anyone else. Being sickly all those years had pre-empted his heat, and when he had gone through a peri-heat he ended up alone in his flat for a day or so crazy and needy at the same time. As he stood there, Bucky stared at him with his lip curled up into a snarl.
“You’ve help me a lot,” Tony whispers and lets his hands glide upward to Steve’s face as he stands. Beneath him Steve quakes ever so slightly. “I mean it when I say that you’re important to me, Steve.”
“Sir is in the parlor.”
“Steve, Cap, please.” He slips further on the steep hill that seems to end in an abyss.
“Steve, come on. What’s going on?” When Steve shifts to leave, to escape his grasp, Tony stands up and stays planted in front of him, blocking his route to freedom. “What’s happening? Should I call Logan? Is there something you’re not telling me?”
“That won’t be necessary, I can do it.”
God, Tony had nearly forgotten about Thor. For a huge demigod, he had the uncanny ability to fade into the background.
“Not sure about Pierce, whether the Governor is or isn’t with Schmidt,” Steve says. “All I know is that Schmidt’s running a gang that’s got just about the whole town of Avenge terrorized and I can’t get any help from Pierce or Fury.”
“It wasn’t,” Steve repeated. He had to because if he didn’t he might not believe it. “So, can someone give me an update?” Steve glanced around at everyone but never settled on Bucky. He should greet his old friend, but something intangible prickled between them. He needed a moment to settle his own troubled emotions.
“Are you okay?” Tony asks. Steve hasn’t spoken much since their little impromptu luncheon on the jet. The shock of everything might be taking its toll.
“Is this what you do now? This?”
Tony cuts her off and turns to Steven. “The Asgardians don’t have the castes. No alphas, no betas, no omegas. Nothing. It’s weird.”
“Yeah. That and the wound,” Steve said. He dropped the gauze in the sink. “What do you want me to say?” He looked over Tony’s shoulder and frowned. “God, Bucky, just open the door. Don’t lurk. It’s rude.”
“I got an address. Natasha found it. Out in Bayonne.” Clint proceeds to tell him. It’s in New Jersey by the docks. It will take him over an hour to get there.
Tony’s expression turns from puzzled and concerned to stern and cold. “You don’t have to worry about it. I don’t need to have a mouth on my cock all the time.”
“Just for a coagulant?” Tony had questioned. A Secretary of Human Security known for his wild ass ideas of a prison in the middle of the ocean and his regular support of vampires being jailed without a trial – well, it seemed out of character. “Why the coagulant?” Could it be that Ross wanted it to wage a better war? Like he said on the news report? The coagulant would be a great help for humans during war, more support on the battlefield, less deaths due to bleed out. The highest rate of mortality in the field during war was hemorrhage. It struck the wrong chord with Tony, though; people like Ross cared little for the pawns they put on the front lines. War wasn’t young men and women dying. It was a game and nothing more. He quizzed Bruce about it.
“You could have reached out through the bond to find me,” Steve said. “I would have answered.”
"Shouldn't look like this." He hears the doctor state as he pulls out what looks like viscous green pus.
“Shit,” he curses and drops the battery. Again he tries as he listens to Tony heave in a breath and then shake as he exhales it out. The tears fog his sight and he murmurs, “I’m trying, please God I am trying.”
“Now wait,” Sam cut his thoughts off. “I understand leaving me here as your outside man, but don’t you dare try and protect me. Riley went down but he wanted to do the right thing. He wanted vampire and human relationships to be accepted.”
Steve sucks in his cheeks and then blows out. “No. It was completely destroyed but not before Zola, the machine Zola revealed somethings. Some terrible things.” He grabs the other stool near the island and sits down, hands folded on the countertop. “Zola showed us things. Things that I spent the last year or so trying to confirm.
