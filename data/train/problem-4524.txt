Dean pursed his lips together to mask his surprise. Touching the back of his thumb to his brow in a sign of thanks, he wordlessly began to lead his mare down the pathway towards the tree line.
“Did you find them?” Dean's eyes fell back to the woman's. Her voice had come out in a rasp, as if she hadn’t spoken since he had left three days earlier. Dean did not let himself linger on the thought.
"Alright, I'll stay," Cas soothed, stroking his hair back one more time before taking a seat at Dean's desk and picking up one of the books Dean had been intending to read but never seemed to have the time for.
The Shadow takes them both, its prize
"Well, big brain or not, you'll resent me for it if you make yourself stick around out of fear, or responsibility, or whatever. I know I have some issues sleeping, but other than that, I'm great. I'm great. I'll be fine if you need solo Cas-time, off on a shiny cloud or roping up some fucking stardust somewhere."
Cas let out a startled bark of laughter, knocking him out of his bemused stillness. "Of course, Dean. Sure." He stood up, directionless for a second, then turned to the dresser, toeing off his shoes and indicating the drawers. "May I?"
"That's not the problem," Cas said with a dismissive wave of his hand, plucking his millionth gummy bear of the day out of the huge open bag between them. "I would be more than happy to drive if you require a break, of course."
"Eileen told me," he answered honestly, "when we had movie night about a year ago. The night we watched Dracula- the one with Winona Ryder. And Charlie told me about an, ah- an
Sam's junker car was already in the garage when Dean pulled in, and it wasn't even nine yet. Cas was back, too- he'd taken the truck to get his gardening supplies and was just gonna keep them in the covered part on the back until they moved.
Cas flushed slightly and shifted in his seat. "Not exactly. I may have... practiced."
“I mean- I don’t know,” Dean floundered. “I just meant, you know. With hunting. The job, you know? What if something happened to the hive while we were on a case?”
"Consequences?" Dean laughed disbelievingly. "Dude, this has nothing to do with you. You're leaving us. You're going to have your own family and that's great, Sam, it is, but you don't get to tell me and Cas what to do."
Just as he reached out to take Dean by the shoulder and turn him around, Dean moved with a sudden burst of energy, like a coiled snake striking out. He whirled around and met Cas’s eyes, took him by the neck and the waist, and kissed him. His lips moved with a gentleness that contradicted the intensity of the grip of his cold-fingered hands as they worked their way into his hair, wormed their way under his trenchcoat, and touched the bare skin they found where the hem of his t-shirt met his jeans. He met the kiss eagerly, licking teasingly at the seam of his lips, biting down gently and coaxing Dean into opening his mouth. He pushed Dean back until his back hit the nearest rusted army-green truck with a small thudding noise, pressing himself up against Dean and tugging on his hips so they were pressed flush against each other, the contact sending and electric thrill racing up his spine.
He was still keyed up when he slipped under the sheets, and he didn't fall asleep for a long, long time. When he did, he dreamt of dirt, dust and the dark, and of monsters- of searching endlessly through trees and hills and rivers for
"Well, I don't know," Dean said, crossing his arms uncomfortably. "I've never looked at a house before. Can we just show up? Do we need to make an appointment with an agent or something?"
7B’s door is open.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course. From the beginning?" he enquired.
"Well, that's no excuse to-" Dean started on autopilot, going right into "Family Beat Down Mode", and then finally processed what Sam said. It took a second. Early morning, and all that. "You- oh," he said weakly, before bursting into raucous laughter. "I can't believe you actually did it!"
"Keys?" Sam asked, fork stuck midair halfway to his mouth.
"Dean," Sam said seriously, and there was his 'I'm well adjusted, so it's emotions time' voice- "did you think any of this,
the smile in his voice, the bastard. "As I was saying, though, you did manage to give yourself a concussion. I'm almost impressed at the velocity with which you managed to stand up, at your age," he teased lightly.
after, or anything. Like if you wanna stay and, I don't know, just, read your book at my desk, that would be okay. It's just. Staring while I'm asleep, you know? I'm not some teen girl with vampire boyfriend"
Cas's mouth latched onto his nipple, his tongue flicking maddeningly at it and rubbing at the other with his thumb.
“What do you want, Dean?” Castiel asked, taking another step forward, the very picture of authority and control. One more step and Dean could reach out and touch him. The air was electric, heady with power as it positively radiated from his body.
He was great.
Sam thought he and Cas were- that they. Hnnnng ok. He thought that they were sleeping together. Yep. Behind his back. Sam actually thought that Dean would do that, that
Dean eased the Impala off the road up the drive, dust kicking up gently behind them. Cas had gone silent and almost statuesquely still, but he didn't look upset. Far from it, in fact. He parked, and before they even got out of the car, Dean was struck by a feeling. He knew it was perfect. He was already hopelessly gone on it, and they hadn't so much as glimpsed the inside. It looked like a place where, once Jack got back, or if Claire and Kaia wanted to stay, or when Sam and Eileen came to visit, they could be... a family.
"Two ounces," Cas said. "Hmm. Here." He broke off a chunk with his hands. "That's two ounces. Chop it down to approximately the size of chocolate chips. It doesn't have to be perfectly even, it just needs to be small enough to melt quickly without separating."
On the heels of that absolutely insane question, Dean was involuntarily seized by a vision: Cas, reaching down and taking Dean's hand in his own with a playful little smirk, pulling it up his leg, and pressing it down onto his cock. He held Dean's hand there and ground up into the heel of it, hardening slowly under the pressure. He bucked up once, twice, just little twitches of his hips as he started really getting into it, closing his eyes for a second and biting his bottom lip as he inhaled shakily. He squeezed the length of it, lightly, the unbearable heat sending a thrill up his spine, and Cas made this sound, a little punched-out gasp, and helped Dean start to ease down the zipper-
It took almost no time at all to drive back. He scooped up the groceries, determined to make it all in one trip, and stuck the keys in his usual front right pocket. He didn't have that many keys, and maybe it was all in his head, but adding this one made it feel heavier in the fabric. It seemed to nudge into his leg like a persistent little reminder as he walked, one that was saying
"Of course," Cas said, producing the tape from what appeared to be thin air. A special angel-made time/space extra-dimensional little pocket. Whichever.
Dean laid the whisk on his little catch-all dish and moved to the cutting board, where a large block of bittersweet chocolate and a knife still lay from Cas's earlier efforts. "How much?" he asked, picking up the knife. It was the same large, smooth-looking silver one he usually used for cooking.
Cas takes a shocked step to him and sobs out a sharp little breath when Dean’s hands touch his face, his thumbs stroking over Cas’s cheekbones and swiping away the last clinging tears. He holds onto Dean’s shoulders too tightly, his fingers tugging at the fabric, his eyes searching Dean’s in disbelief.
He raised his hand, reaching out two fingers, but seemed to change his mind mid-reach, and then he held Dean's cheek in the palm of his hand.
He managed to wrap Dean's leg up decently tight, straight and stiff, but he had quickly discovered it was broken in several places. He didn't know what he could do for Dean's ribs, and he felt, as if from a distance, how Dean's breath was coming shallower and shallower, and he made his choice.
“Don’t make assumptions, Dean,” Cas cut him off, with steel in his voice, “and don’t put words in my mouth. I thought-” he sighed heavily. “I had hoped that we were past all of this.”
A quick one-two-three knock at the door had him nearly jumping out of his skin. "Are you decent?" Sam asked, his voice hesitant.
"I'll take care of that," he said quietly, still seated. "It's late, and you have much to do tomorrow. You should go to bed." His soft tone belied the underlying message-
Dean's ears were ringing with the force of the blow. "I- Dad-" he stuttered out, dazed, pain blooming in his cheek.
It was not, in fact, easy.
. "Yeah, I'm decent," Dean sighed, sitting up and swinging his legs over the side of the bed. Mentally, he steeled himself for the inevitable Sam-storm.
“She’s gonna get through that door.” It’s a grim statement, made all the more foreboding by Cas’s assent.
"No, I know, it's just- do you normally spend the night in Dean's room?"
"Can't believe you're gonna be driving on your birthday," Dean mourned, looking down into the generously sized blue mug of hot chocolate Cas just set in front of him. "Well, I'll see you, dude. Be safe."
“I swear, Cas,” he said, raising his hand to his heart, “I’ll try.”
"There's some toast if you want some, Dean," Sam said, gesturing at the little pile on the kitchen island with his spatula. "I picked it up at the farmer's market I passed on the way back yesterday evening right as they started packing up for the night. First of the year, I guess. It's just sourdough and a seeded white loaf, but they're both pretty good."
Goodbye, Dean." Cas pushes him away, hard. Dean stumbles and falls to the ground against the wall.
"No, you excel at pie. Your breads and cakes need work," he replied matter-of-factly.
"I'll have some soup," Cas said, which was a first.
"Good night, honey," she said. In just the faint glow of his night light he couldn't see her face clearly. "Happy birthday."
"Hey, I'm sure someone's done it before," Dean joked, sloughing off his jacket and hanging it up. He sidled up next to Sam at the sink. "Scoot over, birthday boy," he ordered, trying to wash his hands while Sam still did the same, and got a face full of flicked water for his trouble.
into his hands, into Dean.
), there was no furniture there and they still had to get the locks rekeyed, they couldn't keep these- but he had a house. Where he would live with Cas.
"Holy
Cas looked back at Dean,
"You're not actually mad," Cas said tolerantly, loosening his tie and rolling up his sleeves again from where they'd started to fall. He'd gotten all dressed up to meet a termite inspector, the overachiever, but at least he'd shed the coat and suit jacket while he made their drinks. "And you're hardly old."
"Dean-"
"Well," he hedged, voice rough, "I mean, you don't have to- to
Second, the entity reaches out and engulfs Billie in blackness.
"Yeah, yeah," Dean agreed, "I've definitely read my share of Tolstoy in my time. Used to bore me to sleep as a kid, then after a certain point I couldn't get enough. But you," he teased with a smile, "reading my old books? I didn't really take you for the Salinger type."
“Hello, Dean.”
She held him tighter. "He just needs time. And that might be hard. But Grandpa and I love you, so much, and we'll be here to love you until your Daddy is better and can be like a real dad again." She sounded a little strangled, but he could tell she was being very serious with him.
"Dean, look at me," Cas begged, releasing Dean's hand and capturing his face between his palms, forcing him to turn, to raise his gaze and meet his eyes. There was no disdain or vitriol there. No disappointment or judgement either. "You are a good man. You are
routine. Him and Cas, sitting down to drink good whiskey and just be around each other until someone broke for the dinner table, then after, taking a beer each from the fridge and settling in their armchairs to watch a movie. Together.
"Thanks, Cas," Sam said, the residual tension from their fight starting to clear from his face. "Hey! A camera?" Sam queried, pulling out the box and inspecting it.
As he snuck over to the top of stairs to peek down through the railing bars, hoping to catch a glimpse of what was happening down below, he nearly tripped over himself at the rage in his dad's voice he sounded huge and terrifying and very, very drunk.
Dean felt his cheeks flush with color. Cas was looking at him with an expression that was somehow both perfectly innocent and a bit too knowing. He reached out to press two fingers in a brief touch to Dean’s forehead.
“We should move on,” Cas urged, glancing around. He stretched out cautious tendrils of that grace to survey their immediate surroundings. “Nightfall is coming and we should get some distance, in case there are any more of them nearby.” He also didn’t like to stay in one place for long even if he could sense no one else nearby.  Any use of his angelic powers seemed to be a beacon to leviathans in the vicinity, drawing them out of deep hiding.
Dean knew Sam wouldn’t listen to him. He’d clean up, making Dean feel even more guilty when he stumbled back in later. But he’d also feel thankful; good old Sam, taking care of big brother who was an emotional wreck these days. There’d be a meal waiting and a movie to watch on Netflix, too much beer and whiskey to drink. Then Dean would crawl into his bed alone and pray he’d drunk enough that he wouldn’t dream.
"Jack, come on," he prodded.
), are pre-approved for a mortgage, and the house is theirs, once they finish up on the required inspections during a brief escrow period. Dean worried about that for a minute, but the realtor promised them she could take care of all that, since they live so far away right now. After the seventh of May, barring any unforeseen disasters, they can move in whenever they want. She handed them a paper copy of the sale contract at precisely 5:17 pm and sent them on their way with a little wave.
"I wish you all the happiness in the world, Sam," Cas said. "Of all people, you deserve it."

The first time Jack left after they'd defeated Chuck destroyed him. After they got home he'd spent the next four days haunting the bunker in a haze of grief that even Sam couldn't reach through. It was the final blow to his fragile state and he just couldn't shake it no matter what he tried. He'd prayed to Cas so many times he lost count, begging him to come back. To come home and to be alive and to never, ever, ever do that to him again. He prayed to Jack, to Amara, even, in a fit of insanity, to Naomi.
He shook his head and tutted, unfolding his arms in a deliberate, cocky sprawl. "Cas, you dirty bastard. I didn't know you had it in you," he said, an approving, devious tone to his voice.
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas said. “We don’t need to talk about it. We can forget about the bees.”
"Well, you learn something new every day," Dean said. He shut up the cooler tank and started collecting the rest of their gear. Jack had left his soda cup a little ways away where he had been perched on the rocks, forgotten in his enthusiasm at Dean's last catch. "Go grab your trash," he directed him. "We should be getting back."

"Happy?"
It was a miracle Lucifer let Dean go. He had brushed him off as a non-threat. Unimportant on a cosmic scale, however important Dean was to the vessel. To Sam. So Dean walked out of that run down building alive, and he was the most beautiful, terrible thing Cas had ever seen. His soul shone brighter than even an archangel’s grace in his rage and trembled with the fierce sharpness of grief, and it was glorious,
"I can try! How can I try if no one tells me anything?" he shouted desperately before he could rein it in, mortified at how quickly he lost it trying to defend himself. Dean wasn't sure if he was just talking about Sam anymore. Suddenly this whole thing seemed bigger than that, with his angel sitting in front of him,
He yanked his coat off with a twinge of regret. It was bloodied and worn and what he was about to do with it felt like a milestone he was loathe to reach.
Dean wasn't expecting it to make him
"Fourteen billion, seven hundred million. Approximately," Cas said sagely, petting at Dean's hair, gently, in a way that felt way too awesome for what it was. "The universe is far older than human scientists currently think."
"You know, I don't think you've ever driven Baby," Dean realized out loud. He smacked a hand on the wheel. "Let's get you behind the wheel on the way home. She's a great ride," he said proudly. "Drives like she's almost new, even after everything we've put her through."
"Regardless of your stubborn, juvenile reaction to something like this, it really is time for you to get up," Cas said in the single most passive aggressive tone possible. "If we want to be on time for the showing we need to leave in forty-five minutes. Forty-four, now."
"Sorry," Cas said, too excited to be properly sorry. He was practically vibrating in his seat. "It's the next one on the right. Two and a quarter miles up."
“Oh,” Cas said, deflating a bit. “I didn’t think of it that way.”
His wings are restored, his grace multiplied a thousandfold. It's so much, it almost feels like when he was God.
He moved suddenly, sending Dean’s heart sprinting again for what felt like the hundredth time that day.
"I- oh," Cas said faintly, his eyes darting searchingly to Dean's, and held his gaze for a moment. Then, apparently satisfied (or not) with what he found there: "Correct."
and leave him behind, and why isn't his brain
“Okay,” Cas echoed, nodding his head with a small smile teasing at the corners of his lips. He picked his glass back up and resumed sipping at it as if nothing had happened while Dean just sat there, motionless, trying to process whatever the fuck definitely just happened.
"I- okay," Sam said, clearly making a massive mental recalculation and regrouping valiantly. "Did you ever consider that this might mean something different to Cas than it does to you?"
They ate in relative silence for a few minutes before something dawned on Dean.
But- oh.
"So," Dean hedged, a tentative little smile on his face. "Secret ingredient?"
Cas quickly assumed an incredibly serious air. "It's a top secret recipe," he said finally, his fingers steepled under his chin. "I came up with it myself. It's got sea salt and honey in it."
"No!" Cas shouts, desperation coloring his voice as it cracks, trying to shove Dean away again, but it's too late.
He ran his hands through his hair and let himself luxuriate in the smell of his shampoo- mint, lemon, chamomile- freshly herbal and soothing. He worked it into his scalp and rinsed it out carefully before applying his conditioner. Let Sam call him a hypocrite. Hair care matters.
And damn, his heart was racing. He was a disaster.
"I know you won't be able to walk it," Cas said quietly, unable to meet his eyes even as he interrupted him. "I did what I could, but you'll be weak for days. You need time."
When he'd managed to make his way to the kitchen, the pot was full of hot coffee, a smiley-face post-it note was smacked on the front, and his favorite mug was set out next to the sugar. Turns out angelic forgiveness takes the form of a cheerfully steaming, highly caffeinated peace offering.
"Coffee?" Sam asked again, sounding absolutely desperate to return to the original question. "Coffee. Leave me a mug and I'll grab some in a bit? I was about to go on a run."
"If you want me to," Cas said. "It's easy enough, but I'd have to monitor you in case it turned bad, so I could shut it all down before it woke you up."
us?” he asks plaintively and follows Sam through the door. “It doesn’t make any sense.”
"No, but if you're thawing out the whole container, I might as well. I know how much you enjoyed it when you first made it, and it did smell pleasant."
. And it was going to take me away, but Cas fought it. He-” Jack shudders and closes his eyes for a moment. “He made a deal. To save me.”
“Seriously?” Sam asks incredulously.
"Cas-"
"Yeah," Dean said, still smiling at his brother like an idiot. His cheeks hurt from the exertion, but, dammit- "I'm so proud of you, Sam," he said, reaching across the table to squeeze his brother's hand quickly before relinquishing it and tucking into his breakfast at breakneck speed.
hit pretty hard. She was a great little songwriter.
worth it.
"Just outside Wichita," Cas offered. Dean groaned.
Then the softly petting hand and the warm ribcage were gone, replaced with cool air as Cas started to go, and Dean panicked. A hand shot out from under the blanket before he even realized he meant to move it, and grabbed onto Cas's sleeve.
"Don't let him get to you," Cas recommended. "But, Sam, if you really do have feelings for Rowena, still, you should probably talk to Eileen about that. You know there's nothing wrong with polyamory, as long as everyone involved expresses their informed consent and is emotionally capable of managing multiple relationships maturely."
"Okay, woah, okay, no," Sam interrupted him, flustered. "Slow down, holy roller. That is so not what this night is about. Just," he paused, as if considering it for a moment, before shaking his head and continuing on. "Right now I'm still processing my engagement and you two buying a freaking house. Threeway stuff is not on the table."
"Thanks, buddy," Dean said, letting Cas pull him up by the hand and letting go quickly.
Next, he tried to stand back up and tell whoever was there to turn the fuck around. No damn privacy.
"Toilet?" Grandpa asked.
“Anything,” Dean swore. “Just- Cas, please. I’ll do anything. I will, I swear it. Just please help Sammy.”
? My grace has recovered since Jack took power, you know that, Dean."
Cas had said he loved him before. He loved all of them. This time wasn't any different, was it? And it could hardly be a surprise to anyone, Dean thought, that his 'greatest happiness' or whatever he said he had to do to cash in on the deal with the Empty would be sacrificing himself to save Dean. Cas basically lived to help people. He was the best out of all of them. So what if he didn't think he would come back to Dean when he made his choice and took Billie down with him? So what if he didn't love Dean enough to stay with him and not
Just an hour and a half later he sat on warm, sun-soaked rocks and turned his face into the soft spring-summer breeze. He was grateful for the quiet moments like this but still found himself wishing for it to be like it was before. Like he dreamed about. Without Jack there, he felt the vacancy in his special fishing spot keenly. He knew he'd done wrong by the kid, at the very least, more times than he would care to think about. But he wanted to make it right. He wanted time to make it right. Jack really was family- he knew that when he said he wasn't that last time, that was all Chuck. He couldn't deny that he'd said and done things he shouldn't have when Cas was dead, when Jack had just been born, but... he'd changed. He had. He loved Jack. Of course he forgave him, for everything. He just hoped Jack could forgive him, too, and they could have as many more long days together as they wanted. As a family.
Through the cacophony of his panic-fueled personal porno-vision, Dean registered something strange- that is, that Cas himself appeared utterly unbothered by the crisis unfolding between them, and was acting like this was just completely normal, everyday stuff. Just, something they did. He was even giving the mixtape a solid review, narrating briefly between songs and offering insightful criticism of the song choices, going over certain lyrics, themes, and musical motifs Dean was almost embarrassed to admit he'd never considered. And here Dean was, panicking, and imagining ridiculous shit, and not even trying to talk to Cas about something that was clearly important to them both.
"He has your stepfather and me," Grandma said, trembling in her robe and slippers. "He doesn't need you. Not like this."
Cas snatched his hands back as if he'd been burned, and he was suddenly five feet away again, standing over the pot and grabbing the serving ladle. Weird. "As... funny as that was, a dirty joke was not my intention. I apologize. The human proclivity for assigning sexual or other meanings to numbers escaped my mind for a moment," he said, his voice stilted. "Please pass me your mug."
Castiel smiled viciously at the sky
"Thank you, Dean," Cas said, and he could
Dean looked at him in disbelief and back over at the speedometer, which read at a solid 83 mph. Yeah, not exactly faster than the speed of light, but definitely the fastest he felt comfortable pushing Baby on shitty backcountry highways like this. "Hey, you wanna angel-drop us at the house almost two hours early, be my guest," he said, "but I don't think I can do much more here, Cas. Not unless you're feeling like a breakdown or a
"You could, you know," Dean whispered.
But no words came.
"Well, consider me surprised," Dean said. Something prickled uncomfortably under his skin. Guilt. He took a deep breath. "Cas, I don't want to keep you here- you're not stuck here, especially when I'm knocked out. If you feel like you are, then we got a problem. You don't have to always be around and worrying about me, especially if it's so boring you resort to kitchen experiments to keep yourself busy. You're an angel. Isn't your brain like, the size of a blue whale or something?"
Cas's eyes were even bluer than the sky, Dean decided. He didn't care if it sounded dumb, because it was true. He thought he should maybe be jealous, but realized he wasn't, not at all, because they were part of Cas, and Cas was the best. His best friend.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Big lug can't keep his goddamn mouth shut for anything. Cat's outta the bag, I guess. Why does she text exactly like you do?" he asked.
Some time later- the light out in the hall was still on, shining under the door, so it couldn't have been too long- Dean was jolted out of his fitful slumber by the roar of an engine and the slamming of a car door. The front door opened and shut too, rattling in its frame and shaking the house with the force that had been applied to it.
would do that, and Dean wanted so badly to punch him in the face right now, because Cas
“You sure did, Cas,” Dean said faintly, drifting further into Cas’s orbit as if somehow compelled. Castiel didn’t acknowledge him, keeping his back turned, his spine ramrod straight. Damage control. Holy fucking shit, damage control
“I’m sorry,” he said, his voice cracking as he forced the words out of his shockingly dry mouth, his heart racing in his ears. “I don’t know why I said that. Please- please don’t go.”
"I think one and a half is plenty, baby," she said kindly, humor glinting in her eyes. "You wouldn't want to be sick and ruin your birthday, would you?"
"Dean, I didn't come here to fight or try to boss you around." Sam looked defeated, tired. "Why do you even want to buy a house with Cas, anyway? You love the bunker."
"Oh, and I haven't been?" Dean asked in disbelief. "Seems like it to me, Cas," he said bitterly, looking anywhere but his face.
"Do you need me to put you to sleep again?" Cas asked, lifting his other hand as he turned back to Dean.
Dean looked down at his empty mug, and back up at Cas's soft smile. "Oh, hell yes," he said eagerly. "Let's fucking do this. Lay it all on me, Chocolate Master."
He stepped out of the car and walked over to where Cas was already shaking the realtor's hand. She led them both inside and around the ground floor, giving them a little rundown speech about the specs: "Four bedrooms and an office, three bathrooms, new kitchen- and the basement is top-rated for tornado safety. There's a cellar, too, that could probably be expanded if you so desired."
"It's pretty damn good," Sam admitted, slinking over to the table with his salad. "I'll have some too, Dean. If there's enough," he added.
"I'm not blind, nor am I naive."
"I never doubted you," Cas replied. He looked like he was vaguely high. Who knew that Dean solving a stupid middle-school math problem joke would get him that good. His hands settled a little more firmly in place, warm on Dean's sides through the fabric of his jeans. His thumb hooked in Dean's belt loop. "How did you solve it?"
Wasn't that a terrifying thought?
"At least, we'll make it one," Cas amended, smiling quickly at Dean before going back to looking over the title and other disclosures.
He stripped off his clothes, folding them up in a neat little pile for easy transport back to the hamper in his room, shivering just a little as he was seized by the pervasive chill in the air. He padded over to his favorite stall (third from the right) and hung up his towel on the little hook- far enough from the spray to keep it dry, but close enough for quick and easy access once he'd finished.
He stepped under the beating spray and felt his muscles start to relax, his shoulders dropping the tension they carried around out of the sheer habit of years lived in survival mode. Always on the move, always ready to make the split-second decision that would determine whether he would kill or be killed. The Dean of 2002 would never have believed he'd get to be this old, as ensconced in the brutality of the hunt as he was, and and as convinced as he would become of the inevitability of his own demise at the hand of another. That Dean thought it would be a treat to see the next year. He couldn't begin to imagine thirty, let alone forty.
"Easy," Dean said. "I cheated."
"Night, Cas," he replied, unable to look away from the angel for another couple seconds.
, and John would love him back.
The corners of Cas's eyes crinkled up fondly. They stood there for a second, just looking at each other, but then Dean yawned, massively, and broke whatever soft spell of silence had settled over the room.
"Well, isn't that something," Grandma said, sitting down in her chair next to Grandpa. "That's a very nice compliment, Dean. Thank you."
Cas gasped into his skin, pinching his nipple in retaliation and sucking a buzzing little bruise into the sensitive spot behind his ear. A punched-out little moan echoed at that, and Dean realized it was
"For a start," Cas said icily, "I would appreciate it if you would stop treating me like a child, Samuel. I think you can grant me that courtesy."
"What?" Grandma asked, startled.
"We need to get you to bed," Grandma said, kissing the top of his head. "It's getting awfully late for little boys to be awake."
"Hey!" Dean objected, then reconsidered. "Okay, no. You're right. I've definitely seen better." His last attempt at a nice loaf of pumpernickel ended in smoke alarms and a tragically collapsed loaf that was as hard as a brick. They lapsed into awkward silence, punctuated only by the sounds of dinner.
"Don't- you'll get a stomach ache," Cas said absently. "And no, I'm not reading your mind," he tacked on, his eyes gleaming with mirth, "you're just obvious, too."
"Read to me until I fall asleep?" he asked plaintively in their shared space.
Then something shifts, something
It could have been five minutes or five hours, but eventually, Dean's breath came easier, and he found himself exhausted.
Over behind the bookshelves, the door is ajar. “Sam, there, I think they went that way!” Jack exclaims and sprints down the hall, Sam close on his heels.
"Aww, that's so sweet," Dean cooed on sarcastic, touchy autopilot. "I'm glad you like my food, Cas. It's the least I could do."
But he didn’t hurt him. He didn’t hurt Sam, or smite Bobby, or engage in any sort of holy wrath. He just kneeled, in front of Dean, and clasped his clammy hands briefly in his own warm, dry ones before shifting them both to his right hand and raising his right palm to Dean’s cheek, his eyes darting over his features with an air of disbelieving gratitude. It was so...
"Tell me what?" Dean asked warily.
"I am not a licensed professional," Cas said primly, "but I know what I'm talking about, Dean."
"I'll tell you after. It's an experience," he said reverently, and pressed 'play'.
"I don't
There was a long pause as she finished adjusting the blankets.
A sudden pang of guilt flared up in Dean's stomach. Shit. He's being an absolute dick. Cas's expression was indecipherable, his face carefully neutral, but Dean felt like he messed up, big time, but he didn't know why or how to begin to fix it. He hesitated, and then realized Cas left the book on the table when he stood up to go. Dean grabbed it up and held it out to Cas, feeling like he was about to jump off a cliff or something.
"So?"
What the
“Besides,” Dean said with a forced lightness, taking a rather large sip of whiskey, taking solace in the smooth, sweet burn, “how would you move them? Not exactly an easily portable hobby.”
"Oh. Okay," he said sadly, before another thought struck him. "Was I bad?"
and- and I’ve never felt so alone, Cas. Now how could I want to be anywhere but here, with you?” Dean asks, taking Cas by the hand and drawing him closer before reaching up to cup his face in his hands.
each other.
"You should ask, Sam," Cas said encouragingly. "I bet she would help you too, no questions asked. She's really grateful that Jack brought everyone back- when Stevie disappeared right in front of her, she was so torn up... knowing it'll never happen again, that Chuck can't interfere with their lives ever again, is
Dean cackled and shoved at Cas's generally immovable shoulder. "Dude, oh my
Dean eyed him appraisingly at that and tried not to squirm when he noticed just how intently Cas looked back at him. Was it because he knew, now, that Cas was in love with him? Had it always been like that between them, like Cas wanted to either study him forever or eat him alive? He couldn't remember. How had he never noticed? "You know, we really should take you shopping sometime. Get you some new clothes. You can't wear the same three ancient sweaters forever."
"Yeah, I guess it is," Dean surrendered. "You better remember the hazelnut creamer- but if Sam asks it's not mine!"
“Oh, no, they belong with me,” Cas countered, his tone almost patronizing, like he was speaking to a child.
"Even you have to know how sad that sounds, Cas," Sam said, so softly it was almost inaudible in the hall. "Pining away over Dean until- what? Until he dies?"
“Dean, I’m going to raise a colony of bees. I miss the wild hive I used to watch here in town,” Cas said one day, apropos of nothing in particular. “Ever since they moved out of that old tree just down the road it hasn’t felt right around here without them.” He stared down at the ice ball rolling about a shallow amber sea in one of their little crystal tumblers pensively. “I think we’ve got enough space on the bunker roof for a small hive box, and maybe a few flower pots. It could be… discreet.”
“My lord,” he began hesitantly.
"I just want to be cozy," he mourned, a real beast of a pout forming on his face. It didn't work. Cas just looked at him impassively, with no real hint of emotion or weakness peeking through. Sam always did have the better puppy-dog eyes.
-bass. You had me knocked out real good."
killed my wife!"
,” he swears, shaking his head. Dean’s never heard him swear like that before, not even when Billie had them cornered- and was that already so long ago?
“Cas, I’m not asking you to.” Dean says, unsure and shifting his weight uneasily from foot to foot.
The upper corner of the glass has spiderwebbed with cracks, but it’s still working. The screen lights up and shows all of the missed calls from the past couple hours. Sam stands and leans on the wall, unlocks the phone and starts searching the most recent texts and the call log for any hint about what could have happened to Cas and Dean, but nothing stands out
"What does that have to do with anything-" Sam asked, clearly thrown.
He'd spent the best of three decades desperately trying to be his like dad. He projected the most earnestly learned, hard-won copy of his father, (
Then Dean grabs onto Cas, and they die together in the Empty's grasp, yanking them away and shoving them into sleep, deep into never-ending nightmares and swirling regrets.
"You can do that?" Dean asked, surprised.
“Ready for what?” Jack asks slowly, glancing over at Sam and turning onto the dirt road that led to the bunker. The tires bounce and slide a little in the mud leftover from last night’s rain, but Jack handles it easily.
Once he'd set the perishables in the cooler and turned his sights towards the post office, he realized he still had a ton of daylight left. The keys were there in a large padded envelope, presumably along with some papers and other things for the house- Dean wasn't really sure about the whole document side of things. He ripped open the envelope the second the Impala door closed. Two dull brass keys fell into his hand, and a remote controller for the garage. The physical objects themselves, just sitting there, made the whole situation seem so real. He could drive home now and let himself in. Of course, it wasn't really his yet (
"Blackmail, indeed," Cas said, nodding sagely. "Now, up you get."
. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for love. That is who you are." His voice chokes up and clouds with something that, directed at Dean, feels like a hazy sort of benediction, an absolution he knows he doesn't deserve.
Cas narrowed his eyes almost imperceptibly before relaxing again. “What do you mean?” he asked icily.
"David," Grandma said, her voice pinched. He came back with a glass of half drunk milk, utterly bewildered by the sudden change in the direction of the night, the anger gone from his face. "I think Sammy needs to be put to bed. It's late." She came around the table and picked Dean up out of his chair and set him on her lap, rocking him a little as he cried. "Make sure you get the frosting off of him or he'll be sticky in the morning." She smelled like gardenias and fresh bread. Mom used to smell like flowers sometimes, too. The memory made the tears come even faster than before and he hid his face in her shirt, clinging to it with tiny hands.
, Dean crowed victoriously in his head, putting the grilled cheeses in the skillet aside on a cool burner so they wouldn't char while the soup finished heating up.
in the possibilities and what ifs,
"No, no, no," Cas said frantically, swiping at the screen. "That's not- it's
After tossing and turning in clammy, tangled-up fits for most of the night, Dean managed to drag himself out of bed at about nine thirty. He'd wanted to be up and moving by seven to make sure he had enough time to get things done before Sam got back to the bunker, but something kept him laying heavy and sad beneath the sheets far longer than he'd expected. He'd slept like shit, but that was hardly anything new. No, the problem was the feeling he couldn't hide from that he'd irrevocably fucked up with Cas, despite his kind words as he forced himself off to bed. Hell, Cas apologized to
“No, Cas, you don’t understand,” Dean said, panic coloring his tone and struggling not to raise his voice as his fear started to get the best of him. “I want you to stay.”
Cas swallowed violently.
"Of course I know that, dude. Obviously I love different people. Sam, and Claire, and Jack, Charlie- but that's different," Dean said uneasily. "They're family. You're only supposed to be with one person at a time."
Dean chuckled under his breath and shook his head, readying himself. "You good to go?" he asked.
. On second thought, maybe they shouldn't try to get one. He'd live and die in that bathtub, warm and floaty and smelling nice until the end of time.
"It's not like it'll kill you to ask. Just go for it," Dean said, taking a long pull from the bottle. Soup was getting close to a simmer, finally.
Dean shut off the water and dried off a bit more roughly than was strictly necessary.
"'M not doing anything," he mumbled belligerently, and promptly sliced his left ring finger on a particularly jagged shard. He reflexively dropped it back to the ground and stared as blood welled up in thick beads along the cut. "Oh. Oh, shit." He stood up quickly and stuck his hand under the tap. It stung, distantly.
But then the moment broke, and Cas smiled softly at him and took the book, tucking it gently under his arm and holding it to his chest. "Okay, then. Bed?"
Dean froze.
Present and comfortable loungewear acquired, Dean rushed back to the kitchen, his stomach growling insistently enough that he almost missed the sound of raised voices coming from the kitchen.
.” He pulls Cas as close as can be, and he kisses him. Something in his soul seems to slot into place, a feeling of rightness taking root in a way that he has never felt before. With Cas’s lips on his, his hands in his wild hair, and Cas clutching him to his chest like a prayer, Dean feels like he’s finally home.
Dean felt his heart warm at the kid's sincerity and laid a hand on his neck fondly. "We'll have so many more just like it," he said. "I promise."
Cas would probably help him this time, if he asked. Dean figured he'd do at least a part way decent job all told, as precise and detail-oriented as he was, and he knew the guy could handle a blade better than Obi-wan Kenobi himself. Trimmers weren't that different. He'd figure it out.
"That's not the same," Sam said. "It's too sterile and professional. If you guys took pictures it would be easier to get a read on the vibes of the place."
Dean nearly choked. When he finally unglued his tongue from where it had welded to the roof of his mouth, he tried to return the sentiment. It was always better when Cas was around. If it were up to him, the guy would never leave. They'd smoke weed and sit in the sun and drink hot chocolate and drive around the countryside until the day he died, and then Cas would take him up to Heaven, because of course he would, and things could be like that there, too. If Cas stayed. "Yeah, ok. Cool," he said, nodding along to his own words like an idiot. "I like it better when you're here, too," he added, so-fucking-eloquently, his hands open on the table, palm up in a helpless little gesture of 'what can ya do about it? it is what it is'.
Their intel was wrong, so wrong, and Cas didn’t know how the fuck it happened, but they were fine, they were almost finished, closing up the trucks in the alley behind the supermarket and waiting for Dean and Trish to return from sweeping the perimeter, when out of what seemed like thin air and with no more than a broken shout for warning there were more Croats swarming them than he’d ever seen in one place before, and Joe and Maya and Kris were dead, and Dean was nowhere to be found.
Dean wandered over to his speakers and shut them off, grabbing his phone (
"Not me, ask him," Dean said smugly, brutally throwing Cas under the bus as he gave the melting soup a brief stir.
"But not me," Dean said flatly, staring so hard at the grain of the table his vision blurred.
, Dean. Not to be here. Not yet.” He means it.
"So you see," he said, turning away from Dean and moving as if to inspect his explosive handiwork, "I saved you."
"Wash your hands with the soap bar after," Grandma said. "Count to twenty while you wash."
Dad never apologized for hitting him, or for the night of his fifth birthday, he just moved on with the hunt, and every time after that when he hit Dean just- never happened, either. It wasn't something they talked about. It simply was.
Cas took his hand and squeezed it reassuringly for the briefest instant before releasing him again. "I'm glad we're on the same page, then," he said sweetly. "If you've finished your hot chocolate and would like some more, I can teach you how I made it. It's done on the stove."
"Oh my god, what the fuck?" Dean asked the room at large, so excited, before narrowing his eyes suspiciously. "Dude, you never cook like this. I didn't know you
Nothing. A fat lot of nothing. No cases no one else couldn’t pick up, no monsters that they’d never heard of before terrorizing some town they just had to take out because no one else could handle the gig.
It takes everything in him to turn his back on it again, to look at the angel instead, but the door flies open. Billie is there, and she is angry.
"It's not the same," Cas said solemnly. "Not at all. Even I feel small when I stand beside the ocean."
because Dean brought him here even though he knew better, he did, but he was so
Castiel was brighter than the sun, and he was beautiful. He was the most terrifying thing Dean had ever seen, because somewhere in there, he could still see Cas, the old Cas. He let Crowley go. Dean was going to kill that demon, but- later. Later, when they got out of here and got Sammy put back together.
After he donned the robe he crouched down beside his bed and tugged Sam's present out from beneath it. It was an obvious hiding spot, sure, but that's exactly why Sam would never look there. It was a decent size box and wrapped in some cutesy bird printed wrapping paper Cas brought home one day a couple years ago. Not too shabby, as looks went.
"I've given it six minutes and thirteen seconds," Cas ground out. "Dean, this is so stupid
, Dean noticed. Strong, soft, and broad, with a gentle grip and long, agile fingers. So different from Dean’s own hands, already scarred from the last few years of wear and tear since his resurrection. Of course, he’d noticed before. Noticed that sort of thing about Castiel, how he used his hands to fight, to pray, to eat and to comfort, how they looked drenched in blood and how they looked at rest. How they looked striking a blow to his own face, and how they looked when he healed him. They were one of a million things Dean knew about him better than he knew himself.
"Love you too, Grandpa," he choked out between sobs. Grandma rubbed soothing little circles into his back and hummed low in her throat. It sounded kind of familiar but he couldn't place the tune. She let him cry it out for a while, and when he started to quiet, with little hiccups punctuating his slower breathing, she started to speak.
He fell to his knees.
Dean shrugged. Made sense.
like that, dude. Cas caring about us at all is a miracle in and of itself. It's like, a glitch in the holy-godly wiring or whatever. But me and him, we're good now, for the first time in a long time, so you can chill."
rules. And yeah. Should be back tomorrow night around nine or ten."
"Sixty-nine," he breathed in Cas's ear, in the most seductive voice he could manage. He pulled back and grinned, batting his eyelashes just a bit for dramatic effect.
Of course, Dean knew how
"Dad- sir," he said hesitantly, "the mac and cheese needs boiling water to cook."
"I'll get another thirty out of her," Dean said with confidence, patting the dashboard. "She's my best girl. I know how to treat her right."
"Cas.
And so it goes.
"You know," he said with a grin,"You should drive my Baby more often, Cas. This isn't half bad, this shotgun business."
"Hey, doesn't Lebanon have a farmer's market?" Dean asked, spreading some of his fancy-shmancy cherry preserves (they're from France, he's treating himself) on the sourdough and taking a massive bite. He actually moaned at the flavor, taken aback by how good the bread really was.
He packed up his kit, realizing he didn't mind at all having not caught one thing. It wasn't the same without the kid. He shot off a quick text to Claire, just a simple 'hey, are you up 2 a game of mini golf when we visit? teams you+kaia v me and cas?'
Yeah, his other kid was pretty great too. Even if she was fucking terrifying little hellion. And she was his kid too, wasn't she? He still wasn't sure how that happened, but damn if he wasn't grateful.
"Dean, stop dicking around," Sam said, depositing a
"If I were a betting man," Dean said easily, shrugging.
Maybe Dean wasn't in love. He wasn't sure he ever had been, before. But he could give Cas what he needed. He really could make sure, this time, that Cas wouldn't leave. It wouldn't even be that hard, would it? It was Cas.
human being I will ever know." Cas pauses, pressing his lips together, and Dean can tell he's going to say something more, but he doesn't know why Cas is saying any of this, unless...
Dean sat in silence for a mile, then two. Cas was still frowning at the screen, which seemed to be stuck in an eternal buffering loop. "I don't think we have enough service for the video to finish playing," Cas admitted, finally.
Cas's face relaxed, and his shoulders too. "Well, then I'll repeat myself. That's not possible. I love you."
"Yeah, it got banned pretty much everywhere for a while. And?" Dean replied, sensing Cas was going somewhere with this.
"John, you step away from your mother," Grandpa said, his tone leaving no room for discussion, stepping into Dean's view.
"Thirty seconds, Sammy. Keep your shirt on," Dean said, fiddling with the spark plugs one last time. He ducked out from under the hood and closed it up, wiping his hands off on an ancient grease rag. Sam looked vaguely annoyed and like he might be a little nauseous. Great, all signs of a Sam-induced heart-to-heart. Dean's
Sam didn't rise to the obvious bait. He crossed his arms over his chest and put on a bitch face. "Dean, was he really in here all night?"
It was a beautiful day, warm and sunny with just the slightest breeze to keep the air moving. By the time he got to the gas station, a few clouds had started to coalesce in the sky, puffy and in all different shapes, casting the occasional temporary, uneven shadow on the ground below, and never more than that. Perfect driving weather, even if it totally did suck that Sam was stuck in the junker for his whole birthday. It made Dean want to turn Baby north and let her really fly, pressing the pedal down and not letting up until he hit Sioux Falls, or maybe even further, just for the hell of it.
Maybe they did. Hypocrites, the lot of them. Especially Sam. He knew, too, all too well, the comfort a bottle of whiskey could bring someone like them.
"You know, ever since we met, ever since I pulled you out of Hell, knowing you has changed me. Because you cared, I cared. I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack. I cared about the whole world because of you." Cas is crying in earnest now, but his eyes have never left Dean's face. "You changed me, Dean."
Cas was looking at him like he'd grown a second head, or spoken gibberish.
"Dean, I- I have to try to heal you," he said slowly, knowing that Dean wouldn't want him to be wasteful with his Grace. But this was beyond what human field medicine could help.
He tried to think back to the last time he and Cas had left the bunker for a hunt. There was the rugaru just before Christmas, and a pretty decent sized vamp nest they helped the girls with clearing out in January in Amarillo, and after that…
"I was going to tell you at breakfast," Cas said, hands tucked in his pockets, "but between the whole Sam thing and you ditching me there with him to come hide here- thanks for that, by the way- I didn't get a chance."
"No, yeah, I will," he decided. "I'll ask her. Maybe I'll go visit her. It's been a while, and Eileen was asking about meeting some people- Charlie, Garth, Claire, Rowena-"
"Huh," Sam said pensively. "Hmm. I wonder if- do you think she'd do the same for me? Eileen has never had any trouble with the law like we have, so it would just be me. Even though I know she loves me no matter what, it'd be great if Eileen and I could actually get married, like, legally. We were planning on a commitment ceremony, but being married to her, for real... I'd like that. A lot."
"Ugh," Dean groaned, flopping dramatically back onto his pillow. "Can't you just fly us there?" he whined petulantly.
. "What are you looking at me like that for?" Dean snarked.
"Yeah, okay, thanks," Sam said, and then Dean heard footsteps, heading away.
"Wait, what's it called? Who's it by?" Dean asked, glancing over at Cas's near-rapturous expression.
Cas looked at him funny, clearly skeptical of the quick subject change, but the power of sweets won out. "I'd consider telling you," he said, a spark of mischief appearing in his eyes, "If you promise to give Sam his birthday gift-"
"Surprise, Sam," he said sheepishly, raising his mug in a 'cheers' gesture, "Guess you're not the only one with news."
"Any questions?" she asked, pushing her glasses up on top of her head.
, “it’d be awfully nice to be somewhere we could have a garden.” He took a deep breath. “You know. For the bees.”
Cas's hands were always warm. Not hot or clammy or anything, just warm. It would be a lot nicer to have Cas's hands on his neck than his own, which were usually pretty cold unless he did something to change that, like running them under hot water (hey, like a shower) or by really working up a sweat. Cas, by virtue of being a feathered phenomenon of the cosmos, didn't have to worry about things like poor circulation and whether or not he needed to wear fuzzy socks today, or if normal ones would do. Dean always noticed Cas's hands. It was hard not to, especially times when they were closest: when he would heal Dean with just a touch, when their fingers brushed together on a glass, or a knife, or a bottle, or when they would hug and he could feel the warmth-pressure-squeezing-broadness of them through his shirt.
’ or, the one Dean was waiting for, dreading, the ‘I’m leaving’. But… bees?
"It's no trouble, Dean, you know that," Cas said earnestly. And that was probably true, since Jack pulled Cas out of the empty and left him here he'd been fully juiced up and doing just fine.
“No, Cas,” Dean interrupted before his brain or his fear could catch up to him. “It’s- it’s scrambling your brain.”
everything he could, everything he
"Three and a half."
"Daddy?" Sam said tremulously, on the verge of tears. The whole scene was too familiar, and all Dean could think was
no beta, so please point me towards any typos/mistakes and I will fix them asap
Dean inhaled sharply, his chest tight as he leaned into the touch. "It's yours," he breathed out, "It's all yours, Cas."
The thought made his stomach twist, a wave of nauseated fear splashing over him. He just hoped it didn't show in his face.
"I love you." He means it.
“What?”
In the last hour he'd gone from assuming Cas, as an angel, had about a net total of zero interest in sex to dry-humping his best friend in his bed because said best friend loved him. Was in love with him.
"You think you know anything about this 'ridiculous crusade?" he snarled, getting in Grandma's face and towering over her, waving a bottle with a black label around clumsily. "I know what I saw that night, I know someone, some-
When he had done it, when he had drained himself down to mists and vapors, and had
"Like," he pointed up at the ceiling. "Charlie? Or Charlie-and-Stevie, Charlie?"
Inspiration led him on. "If I'm really, really good, will he want to- to play with me again?" His lip wobbled. "I miss him so much, Grandma." He started crying in earnest, the cupcake forgotten.
(like home)
"It's forgotten," Cas said, refusing to meet Dean's gaze directly and instead looking somewhere in the general vicinity of his hairline.
He'd clearly failed, as Cas had turned to face him, face drawn in worry. "Are you sure you're alright? We can just fast forward and flip to the B-side."
"David..."
- and patted him on the knee as he pulled away, feeling like a clown and a dirty little liar when he oh-so-casually reached up to 'fix his hair' in a transparent attempt to make the moment seem not-loaded. Not-gay.
Grandma's face clouded, too, her lips pursing slightly, before she put on a smile just shy of believable. "He's busy working. He'd be here if he could, Dean." Dad was gone a lot, lately. No one else's Dad was gone this much. Dean's friends at kindergarten talked about the fun things they did with their dads all the time, like playing catch and watching tv and reading comic books, but Dean never got to do anything like that with him anymore. Grandma and Grandpa were awesome, but he missed his dad.
and being so, so alone.
It’s not enough. But he tries.
“We’ll do ours,” he called over his shoulder, continuing down the central path briskly. “We’ve all got our part to play.”
It was absolutely surreal.
Dean’s boots were already gone, his gun and thigh holster absent too. He’d left his green jacket behind, tossed carelessly aside last night and hidden under the trenchcoat on the floor at the foot of their bed. He slipped his coat on over his clothes and shoved Dean’s jacket into their pack- he knew he’d want it later, even if it was just for the drive back. He slipped on the worn coat, habit- he’d stopped wasting Grace on its upkeep a while ago, but it was still important. It felt like comfort, in some strange way, so he kept on wearing it despite the worn-through elbows or the stubborn little bloodstained spot on the hem.
"I promise. Love you, Dad," Jack replied, so softly Dean thought he hadn't heard it after all, but Cas gasped and just held Jack tighter.
"Okay," Cas said faintly.
chapter 4 is coming up thursday after next! the rating will be going up. i hope you're alright with that :)))
He buried his angel blade to hilt in yet another Croat’s throat, yanking it out and ducking out of the way of the spray of blood that followed in a well-practiced motion uncanny in its speed. They would win this one.
Dean's stomach twisted. "Well, maybe once it's summer and things get started up again around here, Jack will have some free time on his hands again. How long can restoring cosmic balance take God, anyway?" he said, trying to put a good spin on things. It was too early to think about this. He knew it wasn't quite the same as the connection Cas had with him, but missed the kid too. When Chuck wasn't actively manipulating him into taking a gun to his head or making him say shit about Jack not being family like Cas was for the sake of his stupid script, he'd actually come to think of him like a son. And beyond whatever it was they all have with Claire, and whatever regrets he might have about Ben, Jack was the closest Dean was probably ever going to get to a son. He'd gotten used to having him around, taking care of him and spending time with him. For his overgrown toddler to be the new God was... hard to come to terms with. So he tried not to think about the whole thing too much, and instead just let himself hope that someday he'd come back home to them.
“Cas,” Dean said faintly, unable to tear his eyes away from his friend’s face even as Bobby attempted to fight his holy gag order from his place next to him. “I… I’ll try. For you,” he added, trying to add a note or resolve to his voice as his thoughts roared in fear and grappled with the idea, stuck on the precipice of this terrible new unknown he had run up against. But he truly had no choice.
"No thanks," Dean said, visibly shuddering. "I love Eileen, but I want to be as far from here as I can when she brings that dog in."
Not yet.
As he rounded the corner and approached the kitchen, he did a mental fist pump at his timing- he could hear Sam and Cas in the kitchen, speaking quietly to one another.
Cas laughed. "And the bathtub," he agreed, and Dean was healed.
no beta, please show me my mistakes and I will gladly correct them
"I know that look, Sammy. Don't test me," he warned as Sam started flushing, pink rising on his cheekbones.
"Of course I don't know that, Cas! How do
He couldn't look at the things anymore. He shoved one back in the envelope and hooked the other on his ring of keys, right between his old key to Bobby's house and the key to the bunker garage. It looked good there, hanging there between the two of them when he started Baby up.
"Dude, Cas is even happier about this than I am," Dean said, confused. "He already found a house he likes. He just wants to raise some bees, have some space while we wait for Jack to come back- and I know he's coming back," Dean added. "He was totally down when I asked. Yeah, it was impulsive, but we're both cool with it. I don't see a problem, Sam."
He made a quick mental note to test the water pressure out at any house they even so much as looked at. No piddly, weak little showers for him, thanks. He'd spent enough time in crappy motels and dingy little cabins to last him a lifetime. He deserved some creature comforts.
"Yeah, go for it, man," Dean encouraged him.
This wasn't what he had in mind. He'd thought, oh, a peck. A couple short kisses, maybe, that they'd work up to something even as hot-and-heavy as making out, over the next couple weeks or so, but he was almost naked, and so was Cas.
"-did we know this would happen? Oh, don't kid yourself Sam," Dean said, smiling. "You two are pretty obvious."
"It's just the one cut. You were lucky," he informed him, enfolding the hand in question in both of his before lighting them all aglow, healing him. He opened his hands and checked the skin again, satisfied when he could see no sign of it having ever been marred. "You're in your head," he said, softly matter-of-fact as he continued looking over Dean's hands, tracing the broadness of his palms, the delicate bones of his wrist with lightly skating fingertips. "I know you. You think that this- this secret is your fault, somehow. It's almost easier for you to blame yourself, because you feel like you have no control over what Sam does. Almost like you're being abandoned. And blaming yourself lets you believe you have control over the situation." He looked up, directly into Dean's eyes.
He steps around the chair, closer to Cas, and tries to steady his racing thoughts.
He tugged on a grey t-shirt and some new boxers (blue and purple stripes, with a funny little cat logo embroidered on the waistband) and threw on his dead guy robe. It was funny, eight years on and he still got a kick out of wearing it. Whatever. It was comfy, so sue him. He half-heartedly made his bed, mostly just yanking the blankets up so they laid-almost flat, then sighed when he realized he'd be sad about it later tonight if he came back to his room to go to bed and it wasn't made up all nice and crisp for him to climb into. People are liars if they try to say it feels the same either way. It doesn't. For a second he thought he'd lost his phone, but it was just wedged under the pillow. He gave the room a quick once-over glance, and, satisfied, went off to brush his teeth and take a piss, since his bladder had apparently decided it was time to make itself known. Urgently.
“Yeah?” he answers. “We’re almost there.”
"Got him!" Dean crowed in triumph, finally pulling the fish out from under the surface into the air. It was a great silvery thing, long and thin and with a strange looking nose. "Huh," he said, stumped. "I've never seen one of these before. It's still smaller than your catfish," he added, smiling at Jack at thumping him soundly on the back.
Sam was looking between the two of them with a funny expression, and he hadn't answered Dean's question. Dean snapped his fingers in front of his face and he blinked then shook his head a bit, as if he had zoned out or something. Weirdo. "Earth to Sammy, come in," he drawled. "I ask again, when's the wedding?"
When they got to his room Cas closed the door behind them almost silently, and set
"I'm hungry," Sam whimpered. "It's been a whole day."
Cas patted his hair, his fingers catching briefly in the longest strands, and left the room with no further pronouncements. The door closed softly and for a moment Dean simply lay there, as if he had been stunned by the simple contact, feeling all warm and fuzzy in a way even his brown blanket couldn't provide.
"Okay," Cas echoed. "Good night, Dean."
"Fine," Dean said reluctantly, "just don't get your
"The latter," Cas clarified, as if that answered everything. It didn't.
Cas's recipe, for all that it tasted incredible, was wonderfully simple. From where he planted himself at his side he talked Dean through each step of it in low, clear tones, handing him the ingredients and implements as they became necessary and no sooner. It was the sort of mindless, relaxing task that loosened him up and reminded him of how he felt when he worked on Baby after a good joint, or when he cleaned his guns and fell into a pseudo-trance with the routine of it all. Cas handed him a jar of gorgeous apricot-colored local honey, and two tablespoons went in the pot on low heat, along with two twistings of pink Himalayan salt out of the grinder and a quarter of a teaspoon of vanilla extract. As the honey warmed, in went a slow stream of reduced-fat milk, two cups, and then a tablespoon of cocoa powder. Dean turned to chop up the chocolate on the worktop, but Cas stopped him with a hand on his wrist, just below the hem of his sleeve, palm-to-skin, and pressed a whisk into his right hand.
"Yeah," Cas said, unbuckling his seatbelt. "You?"
"You haven't. The only one here judging you right now is yourself," Cas insisted.
“I need you to know what you mean to me, what you’ve always-” Cas’s voice wavers and stops.
happened here?
Dean launches himself between them, throwing his arms around Cas and screwing his eyes shut when the cold thing touches his back.
was what made Cas- an otherworldly being he'd had to teach the sacred meaning of personal space to, all those years ago- leave, for good this time? What if that was the final straw in a gigantic pile of all the stupid shit Dean had done before that ended everything good they finally had going?
"No, I'm not," Dean admitted. "Hell, after running and fighting non-stop all these years, the last couple months might be the youngest I've ever felt."
he laughed to himself hysterically,
"Blackmail, Cas?" Dean asked, feigning a deeply wounded air.
"See, that's more like it," Dean said, eyes crinkling fondly at the angel's enthusiasm. "We'll be there in no time now, Cas."
Cas doesn't even acknowledge the imminent mortal danger behind him.
. "Charlie is very, very good at what she does. In any universe. Officially, I'm Jimmy Novak's brother, and you and I have never been 'wanted' by the authorities a day in our lives."
"Dean, please stop," Cas said, voice tight with worry. "Let me look at that."
"Language," she said with no real force.
"What, can't talk to me like this?" Dean grumbled, hands slick. "Hang on, I gotta finish this up or I'll probably bump into something and end up with a fuck ton of grease everywhere that I don't feel like cleaning up."
- Castiel turned back to Dean and met his eyes. “I’m your new God,” he said, with an air of authority and immense self-satisfaction permeating his words. “A better one. So you will bow down and profess your love unto me, your Lord. Or I shall destroy you.”
Next, his stomach plummeting, came the thought:
Then Cas sighed, clearly fed up and prepared to bargain. "If I make you coffee and put some in a thermos will you
"Okay, no, wait," Sam interrupted. "Where are you guys getting the money for this?" he asked suspiciously, eyes narrowing. "Dean, what did you do?"
and his best fake ID photo. A birth certificate. Trade school certification in automechanics. A social security card. Bank statements with proof of savings.
He could hear voices downstairs, one loud and angry, the other two softer, but filled with no less conviction. The loud, angry man kept raising his volume higher and his tone lower until he was near shouting, and Dean started to worry that Sammy might wake up too, even considering how hard he slept. He decided to get up and check on him. His baby brother might need him, and he was good at helping Sammy go back to sleep. He padded as quietly as he could to the door and opened it slowly, making sure it wouldn't hit the wall and make a noise. With the door open, the voices downstairs were much clearer, and he realized that the loud, angry man was Dad.
Something was tugging on his line.
One night, not long after Mary was killed, when they were still living with John's parents, stuck with Dean in terrible clarity no matter how far removed from that time he came.
So he scooted over to Cas and cuddled right up to him, the whole nine yard- tangled their feet together, threw an arm around him and laid his head in the crook of his neck. "Thanks, Cas," he whispered, breathing him in. Warm cypress, petrichor, ozone. Familiar.
"Fuck, Cas, oh my
"You misunderstand me, Dean," Cas said patiently. "It has been an adjustment, of course, now that world-ending crises appear to have ceased manifesting in our general vicinity. But it is a welcome change. Regardless of my desire to occupy myself in a creative manner, if you you must know, I would rather be here. Always. I find that the proximity to your soul brings me an incredible sense of peace."
"It's okay, Dean, you don't need math skills- you've gotten this far without them!" Cas looked immeasurably pleased with himself at the two consecutive digs, and added half the chocolate to the pot with a brief little stir. It changed the color and texture of the liquid drastically. Light, frothy brown turned a deep, silky sepia.
"She can do that?" Dean asked disbelief. "I was half expecting to have to go on the run if the realtor so much as looked at us funny today, and you're telling me-"
"Sometimes," she said slowly, "bad things happen. Bad things happen to kids, or to grown ups, and no one can stop it. And then the people those things happened to are hurt, or sad. Sometimes for a long time." Dean nodded. What happened to Mom was bad, and Dad was sad, most of the time, when Dean saw him. She continued, "Nothing your Daddy does or doesn't do right now is your fault. You can't fix him, and you can't change what happened, baby."
“Oh, Dean,” he said softly, “That’s all I ask of you. Just try. Lift up your heart to me, and I will give you everything.”
"Did I do something wrong? Is that why Daddy doesn't want to be with me and Sammy anymore?" She looked at him, shocked, unable to begin to formulate a response. Her hands twisted at the fabric of her blouse as she stared.
he has been- I know he misses Jack, and I'm all else there was at the time, so sue me for working with what I got," Dean said, grandiosely, righteously angry- "but whatever you're trying to imply, drop it. It's not fair to Cas, for you to think I'd just- fuck him and dump him like some one-night stand and expect him to stick around afterwards anyway! That's not what this is. You know he's like family to me-" his voice cracked. He worked his jaw for a moment, trying to get it together. "After Chuck, after- everything, I'm just trying to be a better friend to him, Sammy. That's all," he said wearily.
Cas turns to look back at him, his face closed off, his mouth set in a twisted little line.
Dean’s stomach swooped. “Okay, Cas, you were. We’re sorry,” he added quickly, his breath shallow and shaky. “Now let’s just defuse you, okay?” he suggested, the words cumbersome and heavy in his mouth.
"Dean," Cas started, the tenderness in his tone almost painful.
"Coffee?" Dean asked hopefully, turning to where Cas sat at the table and making grabby hands at the mug Cas held out to him, not even looking up from the crossword he was doing. He took a massive drink from it, draining nearly a third of the bittersweet liquid inside, and sighed happily. "Thanks, buddy."
Something was stopping Dean from coming back to him.
"Cas- I'm not. I don't think you're a child, and I'm sorry it came across like that," he placated. "I just don't think you've thought this through, at all- or you have and you decided you were going to go through with it anyway. I know Dean hasn't processed anything beyond whatever impulse he had to ask you to do this, and hell if I know how he ever managed to even do that."
Billie mentioned are real.
"We had a bet going," Cas said, snapping the bacon in half and wolfing it down, having met his approval. "Dean thought Eileen would propose first," he said, swiping his fingers perfunctorily across his napkin to clean them before beginning to inspect his eggs with the same degree of scrutiny he had subjected the bacon to. "I knew you'd propose first, though," he added smugly.
"Yes, sir," Dean said, trying to muster a brave face, scooping the money and key off the floor and shoving it all in his pocket. "Thank you, sir," He grabbed Sammy by the hand and tugged him out of the motel room, and started the long walk to the corner shop John had been at earlier.
, because they can love you back?"
"Have fun!" Sam called after him, and tucked his headphones in his ears for his jog, walking off in the opposite direction.
"I love you, Grandma," Dean said, his voice loud in the quiet stillness. "I wish Dad was like you and Grandpa," he admitted, his young voice almost venomous. "I wish you were my real parents."
"Because it is," Cas says, and
. It was from the Empty. It wanted, well,
Sam looked to Cas silently for help, but he just sat there placidly, testing out his bacon with great interest as Dean started to work himself up into a frenzy.
"Why are you telling me this now?" Dean asks, knowing that whatever the answer is, he doesn't want to hear it.
"Technically, my trueform lacks a physical brain structure," Cas said with a slight frown.
"I am not joking."
"Well, all right then," Cas said, raising his hand to take a sip from his mug. Dean followed the path of the chipped little green mug up to his lips, waiting until Cas had actually taken a drink- and there it was, he could see his throat move with it as he swallowed. Speaking of his stash, he was pretty sure there was still a pretty decent sized mason jar of weed just chilling in the icebox.
"Please, like you're any better," Sam said, rolling his eyes and throwing together a salad at the speed of light. "You want any?"
Sam pointed the knife at Dean. "You're a terrible influence."
Then it hit him.
"Wait." One word, and Dean dares to hope.
," he said solemnly, his eyes wide.
When he read through the paper that night, after Dad passed out (blacked out), he found their obituaries. Millie Winchester Thompson and David Thompson, dead in a car crash. They were killed instantly.
Yes. This was a good thing.
After the last five months of tiptoeing around each other (and Sam, and Eileen, when she could get there, and the hunters that kept coming by for Sam’s help or to use their library, and so on) in the bunker, that honestly wasn’t anywhere close to what Dean might have expected to hear from Cas. Maybe something more along the lines of ‘I miss Claire, we should invite her and Kaia to come back soon’ or ‘Why does Sam make fun of you for watching John Hughes movies when you can’t sleep? They’re perfect examples of 1980s teen genre film’ or even ‘I tore my jeans at the seam along the thigh,
"This is true," Cas said matter-of-factly. "In the time I've spent with the two of you, it was quite clear that you had something very special. It was simply a matter of time."
First, Dean's brain is suddenly online again.
"I'm gonna make some coffee," Sam said from somewhere behind him. It's almost six, I don't think I'll be falling back asleep any time soon. Come get some when you guys are ready." He paused for a second, then said quite tenderly, "I’m glad you’re back, Cas."
He managed to navigate fairly easily from there right up until the right turn onto West 87th St South, which they nearly missed- it was a dirt road, kind of hidden by some really tall grass at a not-so-obvious intersection, but they did make it, and if the turn was a little sharp, Cas wasn't saying anything about it. The house itself was much harder to miss. With no neighbors as far as the eye could see and a little black mailbox marking the end of the long driveway, the big brick house stood back from the road in a little stand of trees, like an island unto itself surrounded by endless open fields.
Fuck.
Cas sighed, a defeated little noise that made Dean want to strangle someone. "I told him, Sam, you know that. He knows, and he... he accepts it. I don't expect anything from him, but he still wants to be my friend. He wants me in his life, and that's enough. I'll be in it as long as he wants me, in whatever capacity he wants me. I have loved him in silence for years, and it was always and still is a gift to love him. My mind is made up. It has been since the beginning."
that, he thought, recoiling.
"No, don't use your mojo on me, Cas, it's a waste," Dean refused him, stubbornly.
"Yeah, yeah, masculinity, image to maintain, I got it," Cas said seriously, relinquishing the blankets. "It'll be our secret. As usual."
"I just don't think this is a good idea, Cas," Sam said, clearly losing his patience.
"Wow," he said instead. "That's. That's really something, Cas."
He sounded so certain, so sincere. Dean's breath stopped in his throat for a second, his pulse fluttering with the intensity of Cas's words. He swallowed, stalling, then found his voice and replied: "Then, yeah, man. Sure. If you want. Zepp rocks."
Dean shoved down his fear and tried again. “Listen to me.” He stepped closer to Cas, swallowing hard as his voice fought to stick in his throat and looking steadily into his eyes. “Listen- I know there’s a lot of bad water under the bridge. But we were family, once,” he pleaded. “I’d have died for you. I almost did a few times.” Castiel’s face remained impassive but Dean continued. “So if that means anything to you- please,” he begged, abandoning his pride. “I’ve lost Lisa, I’ve lost Ben, and now I’ve lost Sam. Don’t make me lose you too.”
'It's just... already?" Sam asked. "I feel like you guys just started looking."
Cas looked up at him and put the whisk down, pushing the pot back off the burner so the bottom wouldn't scald. "I don't know what you're talking about, it's a simple question," he said with wide, innocent eyes. "It's alright if you don't know the answer," he added, reaching around Dean, presumably to grab his mug from beside his hip and refill it. For a second, his body blocked Dean in against the counter, and before he could back away again, Dean grabbed his tie and held him there, pushing up into his space as the angel froze. Cas flailed for a second, clearly with no idea where to put his hands, before they ended up on Dean's hips, just a ghost of a touch.
"Yeah, who ever thought I'd be a real boy- getting people thoughtful gifts, buying a house, having fucking insurance?" Dean said, hearing himself as though he was quite far away. "Speaking of amazing, I just can't believe Cas is willing to put up with me for who knows how much longer," he continued, and slapped him on the back in emphasis.
. He turned back to Sam, clothes in hand and hoping his body language screamed 'move out of my path immediately'. "What, Cas?"
Cas remained in his spot at the table. Dean didn't,
"Amen to that," Dean agreed, cracking open his beer and taking a sip. "Anyway, if you think about it, it's not that different from all our insurance scams and fake credit cards over the years, is it? Wouldn't it be incredible if we never had to live like that again? Hell, I bet we could vote if we wanted to. We've even got passports!"
"Don't come back," Grandpa yelled, his voice cracking.
Cas gripped his cup tightly, knuckles turning an alarming shade of white. He set it on the side table between them with deliberate care and folded his hands in his lap, the muscle in his jaw jumping wildly and belying his otherwise composed voice. “Is this yet another dismissal, Dean? After everything, are you really going to make me leave? Again?”
"Yeah, yeah, she knows," Sam said, pulling out his phone and unlocking it. "We talked about it. But, yeah here, I took a couple pictures-" he slid the phone over to rest between Cas and Dean, who leaned together over the screen to get a better look. "She actually had already bought me a ring too," he said, smiling. "I just beat her to the punch. Maybe the only time I've ever managed that with her."
Cas," Dean replied for the fourth time. "Just give it a minute."
There's a sound behind him like nothing he's ever heard before, and when he looks Dean feels a kind of horror he can only identify as primordial, because that blackness, that writhing void is cosmically
Yes, well, you know you are rather an accomplished cook," Cas agreed, sipping at the soup. "However, you could stand to practice your baking skills a bit more, to say the least."
Cas isn't done. "It's not," he says, certain even as tears begin to form in his eyes from the strength of his conviction. "And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for
He'd slowly faded out of the dance scene as he approached his mid twenties, and pop punk started its meteoric rise. Then out of nowhere, Dad disappeared, and he had to ask Sam for help, and well... he knew how that particular story ended. But it made him feel wistful, all the same.
Dean blanched at the memory of the massacre at the bunker before Cas's words fully registered. "Wait, what?' he asked. "You still have that thing?"
"Want to come and help out? You can pick out the guest bed," Dean winked.
"Well if that wasn't opaque as fuck and horrifically vague," Dean started. "What are you talking about? I work on the car all the time."
"Yeah, cause I've never heard "Somebody to Love" in my life, Dean," Sam replied, clearly already exasperated with his antics. "Get out from under there, dude."
know that?" Dean asked incredulously. Cas just looked at him, impassive. "I didn't know," Dean repeated helplessly.
"Yeah, sure, kid," Dean said, field-dressing the fish and packing it in with the others. "It's a freshwater river fish, so that should help narrow it down some. No idea if it's native, though."
How many more times would he do this? How many times before had he followed Chuck’s script, followed the patterns and cycle of hurt and pain, with every part of him screaming on the inside? How many times had he let his fear get the better of him and turn into this resentful anger even without Chuck’s control, lashing out at the people who loved him? How could he know which was which? How many more times could he hurt Cas, who hadn’t breathed a word of his confession after all this time, not
He couldn't exactly complain about it. Cas was an incredible kisser, passionate and all-consuming in a way that made Dean feel almost lightheaded- every sweep of his tongue, every bite to his lips felt like little bursts of electricity under his skin. And his hands, fuck, his
"Feels big," Dean admitted, turning the handle with deliberate care and shortening the line. "Probably another catfish."
Dean stirred again now that the soup was fully thawed and stuck his finger in. Still ice cold. He turned up the gas a little. "Well, do you remember that time, years ago, when Charlie gave us that infinite credit card?"
They settled back in under the covers, shirts abandoned permanently for the night in favor of skin-to-skin contact. Cas plucked the book up from the nightstand and opened it.
“I don’t know what I can do to make it right between us, Cas,” he said, his throat tightening slightly. “But I want to,” Dean offered, looking down in shame. “I want to be-” he choked out.
"Thank you, Dean," Sam said, looking like he might cry but somehow managing to keep it in.
Godly.
Cas felt a bubbly panic rise up in his chest through the haze of battle as it became clear to him that Dean wasn’t coming back. Even from the other side of the building or from inside, there was no way that Dean had not heard the commotion of such a large fight.
"Thanks, Cas," he said quietly, honestly, looking straight into Cas's eyes. As blue as they were, they were warm to him. Never cold. When Cas's eyes were cold it broke Dean's heart.
