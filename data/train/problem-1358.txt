Stroking down over John’s shoulders and biceps. His forearms. His hands.
The music.
John doesn’t give him a chance to settle, just fucks in deep, shoving Sherlock forward so that John’s pink plastic prick catches against Sherlock’s mouth and drags a sticky line across his cheek.
John leans forward, elbows pressed to his knees, and buries his face in his hands.
His fingers stroked absentmindedly over his lips and his head was tipped towards the back of his chair, exposing the side of his throat to me. The shell of his ear.
The first time their cocks touch, they both lose the plot and, holding their breaths, move in tandem: a slow roll of their hips.
“I give myself to you,” Sherlock says, with stunning, beautiful conviction. With absolute vulnerability and trust. John can feel a fierce, overwhelming tide of emotion in response to this answer and he has to lift Sherlock’s open face to his and take his mouth with all the tenderness that is brimming inside him.
He obviously didn’t understand and he was muddying the waters. I had decided to give it up and that was that.
John imagines Sherlock snort-laughing at that, even though it wasn’t much of a joke, and his smile tugs wider into a proper grin.
“You’re helping him,” John says.
Sherlock blinked through a fresh rush of tears and turned the key in the ignition, typing out one last text before he tossed his phone down onto the seat beside him.
Pity, that.
Sherlock swallowed hard as John let go of his awkward hold on Sherlock’s hand. The air rushed over where his skin was damp from John’s touch and sent a chill cutting through him. He shivered. “I feel I am responsible for his death and it’s hard for me to talk about my life before. It’s…”
His voice comes quietly from behind Sherlock as he steps onto the crowded elevator a moment later, “Be on the ready, then, Sherlock. Today just became very, very interesting.”
“Mmm, it’s called a Cockmonster. You want one?”
You kiss, mouths open, tongues stroking. It is deep and languorous and you can’t help the desperate sounds you make or the needy way you palm his back and draw him closer.
“But you were just writing in it for the last week. You were trying to hide it under that great encyclopaedia about bees you checked out from the library, but really you can’t hide it from me. I know the signs, you must realise.”
“Mmhmm.”
“I do, sir. Anything you like.”
“I want you to,” breathed out against your cheek. Whispered, secret. “I want you to kiss me everywhere. I want you to leave the shape of your mouth all over me. I want to carry it with me when I go tomorrow.”
You breathe.
“Not everything,” John corrects quietly.
You shake your head.
There’s nothing interesting on the police scanner and the experiment you just finished needs time to work, so you strip off the gloves and set off down Montague Street for a smoke in the slate blue shade of the British Museum.
“Sit up, will you?” Sherlock asks, setting the rod down on the mattress beside him and nodding towards the pile of pillows at the head of the bed.
John is able, with the reassuring pressure of Sherlock, alive and against him, to shove aside the queasy nausea he feels when he sees once more in his mind’s eye, that billowing coat and the pinwheeling arms, reminding him of a very different leap all together.
Sherlock does as he is told. He turns in Reina’s report to Michael with his notes in the margins and heads across town to the bolthole he’d been staying in ever since things had gone south with Moriarty.
Sherlock shrugged. “I don’t mind.”
John shuts his mouth.
He sucks, gently, on you and you moan, heartfelt and broken.
for John. We would dispense with the cheese course in the interest of time and would have
“Sherlock—“
Sherlock stood and when he found Mycroft still standing there he raised his eyebrows in question.
The words, when they’re finally spoken, are a terribly small vulnerable thing, “I accept.”
On some other plane.
John doesn't meet Sherlock at his solicitor's as he promised. He goes to the pub instead. He sits with it.
“You’re incredible,” John says, taking his hand back a moment later and resting it on his thigh. Sherlock can see the burgeoning line of John's cock in the crease where his leg meets his hip, bulging obscenely against his suit trousers.
Sherlock bends down, nudging his mouth tentatively to John’s, and John kisses him again. And again.
Sherlock appears in the doorway, a towel wrapped around his hips, and Jenny’s head jerks up, but this time she doesn’t bark, just watches him intently. Sherlock’s chest is glistening, still damp, but his hair is dry. John, standing, blurts this out, awkwardly, for something to say, as he crosses the room.
They had not seen him at his pub. His club, where he plays billiards with Stamford, said the same.
John undoes the top three of Sherlock’s shirt buttons, baring his chest. John puts the bell into Sherlock’s hand and guides it up until it rests on Sherlock’s pec, just right of center.
Zoe barked a laugh. “Ha! But!”
Sherlock ignores him, opens his lips, and mouths loosely at John.
“Well—”
John slides the croissants into the oven and pulls a few cookbooks at random.  He takes them with him to the sitting room to rifle through while he sips his tea and periodically feeds the fire, Jenny curled up on her dog bed beside the door to the kitchen.
“I don’t mind, you know,” Sherlock said. “It’s nice to talk about my bees. You don’t have to repay me. It’s no bother.”
, and a bag of roasted cashews for snacking, into the front seat of his Range Rover, Sherlock headed to the honey shed to retrieve his equipment.
But interesting none the less.
This scrawled on the back in neat, slanted print (left-handed now tattooed on your brain):
Tongue out, John dips back down.
Lets you palm his shoulder blades and brush the sweat gathering in the small of his back with your lips. Down over his pale round cheeks. His firm, fuzzy thighs.
Jesus.
“She’s a bit shy,” John explained and Sherlock nodded. John tilted his head. “I realised I never got your name, on Friday.”
Sherlock runs the tip of his tongue along John’s top lip. Silky slow. John opens his mouth and licks at Sherlock’s tongue. Sherlock makes a strangled noise in the back of his throat so John does it again.
“Jesus, Sherlock, I’m at
that I had a beehive
Sherlock, eyes wide, lips parted, nods, slowly.
John groans, seeing it, behind his eyelids: Sherlock’s tight hole between his thighs, laid out at John’s feet while his accountants went over the quarters numbers none the wiser. A plug snugged inside. Cock in a ring. John’s cock throbs inside the tight circle of Sherlock’s spit slick hand and John feels heat gathering in his thighs and hips, radiating brightly out to tingle in fingers and toes, erasing the dull pain in his knees as he kneels on the cold tile floor.
“You love it when I kiss you,” John says, echoing Sherlock's words back to him, lips running up Sherlock’s cheek to his temple.
“I’d like another chance, if you’re willing.”
“A betrayal of what?”
That indefatigable light in him was almost completely snuffed out.
When the fit had finally passed, they were the only patrons left.
At the soft dark pile of his genitals nestled in the thatch of curly hair. At the arched buttresses of his ribs. The pebbled pink nipples. The sharp blades of his collarbones. The vulnerable hollow of his throat.
you that. You had become a part of my purpose for living, but I didn’t think I could ever matter that much to anyone else. I believed I was unlovable. And everything I did only sustained that reality. So I died. And I truly didn’t think I would ever come back. I would never have done that, in front of you, if I thought I would survive what came next."
Love courses through John. A deluge. It knocks his knees out from under him and sweeps him away.
Letting you dream a dream where he survives.
“You didn’t want me to take care of you,” Sherlock says, once they have polished off nearly half the bowl. He sits up straight, swiping the back of his hand over his mouth.
“Don’t tell me you’re going to burn it!” he exclaimed, his feet hitting the floor with a mild thump. Toby considered us from his place curled up on my armchair, ears perked.
“He’s lying,” Clara puts in, shaking her head at him.
He was as addicted to my maelstrom as I was to his steadiness.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I didn’t think—” Ellen started to say, looking remourseful.
Sherlock buries his nose in the hair at the crown of his head.
John smiled and slid his hand into the small of my back as we both turned to go.
After settling it against the wall for him to pick up with again later, John walks towards the back of the library where the computer room is located, Jenny loping along at his side. The light coming through the stained glass windows that line the walls is muted, the sun hiding behind a thick layer of gray clouds outside. The colours are matte, unilluminated, the opalescent glass displaying none of its usual shimmering iridescence. St. Bede’s Library, otherwise known locally and with great affection simply as The Bede, lies in a crook of the River Tyne, between Hebburn and Gateshead, in the small hamlet of St. Bede’s upon Tyne.
Anyone could open the door at any moment.
“No.”
“I’m close. I’m so close, Sherlock, I—“ John buries his nose in the sweaty curve of Sherlock’s neck, his hand anchored in Sherlock’s hair, overcome.
“And why must a hobby be productive? Isn’t the joy of it enough?”
Clara looks at Harry and smiles, softly, wistfully. “I do.”
John wilts under it. Snakes in his belly, he feels bile rise in his throat. He swallows against his gorge and it squelches loudly in the quiet of the flat.
“I got over that a long time ago. You know. You were there. When Sherlock was…” John stops himself from completing that sentence. “I’m not homophobic. And it’s not just having grown up with Harry. I don’t…look, I’m as married as I’m ever going to get and it’s to Sherlock right? I want to be with him. When he asked me to retire with him…we’ve talked about this…it felt like a proposal…it
Everyone but Tom and Ruby raised their hands.
John feels all the blood in his body flood up, biting hot in his chest and face. He grits his teeth. “Sherlock.”
“Great. Perfect. Yeah.” John took two steps towards the back door and then pulled up short, turning back towards Sherlock, as if torn between wanting two things at once. The phone in his hand buzzed again and John cursed and turned back.
But when Sherlock opens his eyes, John isn’t there.
…Sherlock might be an arrogant git, but he had the goods to back it up. If there was room for doubt then Sherlock would be the one to find it.
You decide you don’t want your brother’s money anymore. Your last act is to use his cash to buy a set of tailored suits. A fine coat. Shoes. You schedule your thesis defence and don’t show up. Instead you have it printed and bound in leather and then mail it to him with fuck off written across the dedication page.You put an ad in the Times offering private detective services. You solve your first case and with the proceeds you have your violin restrung. You ignore the CCTV cameras as they follow you on the streets.
I moaned and gripped his shoulders and closed my eyes.
John tilts the carton over the shadowed crack of Sherlock’s arse and pours.
“I’ll just toss you a wet flannel shall I?” John says, ignoring the feeling of pride that swells in him, as he opens the door to the bathroom. “I think we’ve got eggs and bacon in the fridge. Want to fry them up for us?”
He’s been watching you, you can tell the instant your eyes meet.
“You always let Pompey sleep with us even though I knew it bothered you to have him in the bed. You knew he helped with my nightmares so you adjusted. You are chivalrous to a fault. You take care of your clients and always see justice is done, even if that means you do not necessarily follow the letter of the law. You play the violin like a prodigy, you’re a beautiful dancer, and an absolutely hopeless romantic, but shhh, my darling, I won’t tell anyone about that last one, I promise…” Here I begged him to stop, but he was incorrigible and did not listen to me. Instead he twisted his torso so that I was dislodged from my nook and forced to look up at him. His eyes were a deep blue and incredibly soft. “I can prove it. You are always buying me little things you think I might like. Sometimes your coat pockets seem like veritable magpie nests. Have you noticed how when I greet you sometimes I slip my hands inside them just to see? Oh, of course you’ve noticed. Let’s see, you’ve bought me a jumper you claimed was the exact color of my eyes when we were on the beach in Barcelona. A pair of the softest leather gloves I’ve ever owned. A snail shell. A bullet. Books. Tickets to the symphony and, sometimes if I've done something good, a footie match. A butterfly. And, one very memorable time, a ring.”
When Sherlock arrives at John’s address in Kensington he ignores the car tailing him and firmly locks the door behind him and sets the alarm.
“Teach you how…”
Because despite all of his resolve to stand and meet whatever Moriarty has sent after them, despite two tours in Afghanistan, John has never quite been able to quell the nervous frissons that strike through him on the brink of engagement. All of his senses are heightened. He can’t stop sweeping their perimeter. Can’t stop touching Sherlock, a hand constantly in the small of his back or wound up in his hand, an arm around his waist, pulling him in.
Sherlock, his heart racing, unaccustomed to the intimacy of such a moment, took his hand back and turned, busying himself with spooning some of the fried rice into a pyrex for John to take with him.
“You don’t have to hide your scar from me,” he says, after. Embarrassment floods down John’s body, scalding hot at having been seen. He doesn’t know what to say. But Sherlock doesn’t give him time to ruminate, just kisses him again, stroking his tongue against John’s. John releases him, a rush of endorphins surging through him, his body a mess of conflicting signals, as the kiss deepens and Sherlock twists his body to face him. John’s right leg slides over Sherlock’s hip and Sherlock runs his hand up the back of John’s thigh to cup his arse, making all the hair on John’s body stand on end.
Sherlock is smiling at him.
And Clara, bless her, nods in understanding. “Yeah.”
“And here.”
How do you intentionally set fire to your own home?
For the second time in less than 24 hours a window shatters nearby. John starts to squeeze the trigger but is thrown off balance, carried forward by Moriarty stumbling backwards, one hand twisted in John’s shirtfront, a red circle blooming in the center of his chest. John would like to savor the look of almost delighted surprise on the man's face, but he hasn't the time. The full weight of Moriarty's body crashes into the window behind him and it gives with a sickening crunch, the pane already fractured by the bullet that had passed through him a second before. John tries to brace himself against the window frame, he feels Sherlock grab at his arm, but his feet slip on the glass and he’s tugged through, Moriarty below him, pulling him into his body as they plummet, the earth rushing up towards them with sickening speed.
John blinks himself from his reverie, meeting the eyes of his colleague, Anwuli, Ani for short, a biracial lesbian woman who interned at the library and who had taken him to the gay bar two towns over the night before. She’s looking at him through the slitted space above the books from the row in front of where John stood.
, came a voice inside him.
When John gets to the corner he keeps running, desperately scanning the dark street. Sherlock isn’t on the pavement. John doesn’t see him in any of the cabs stopped at the red light.
Sherlock’s eyes track John as he walks, tracing up and down his body in open admiration. John feels invincible under that gaze. Handsome and strong and desirable. That Sherlock Holmes chose him to love: surely that means something, right?
“It makes me feel like I want to taste it,” Sherlock says, with a soft moan as John stiffens in his grip. “Like I want to ride it.”
“An agreed upon word that I could use to signal to you that I want to engage in that type of play.”
It’s a miracle happening in increments. So gradual you almost miss it until one day you’re on the other side of it, looking back and marvelling at how far you’ve come.
John doesn’t wait for Bobbi to fumble out a response. He says goodbye and moves on, checking his mobile for the time. Bobbi’s off-colour question has reminded him that he’ll be training the new guy tonight. He’s been hired on to do the night shift for a short time while their regular night shift employee is on maternity leave. The library is open until 8pm during the week to accommodate classes that they offer, as well as for community members who need access to a computer and/or internet after work and school hours. The new hire, a man named Sherlock, would be arriving around 5pm to learn the routine. John still has an hour and a half to finish up the re-shelving and take his break. Mrs. Patterson and her mobile are thankfully nowhere to be seen, the desk she had been occupying standing empty as he passes.
“We’ll have to bring some bags with us. Pick a bushel. Mrs. Hudson will be pleased.”
John turned and leaned over, elbows resting on the counter top, presenting himself to me.
He pushes.
“Sherlock.”
And again.
Sherlock, twenty-eight and a graduate school drop out, has so far lived up to expectations. Arriving late and disappearing whenever he pleased. He's cold and recalcitrant and said whatever he was thinking, which was oftentimes so truthful as to be cruel. He only completed tasks if he deemed them interesting. Although he was obviously brilliant, with a razor edge intelligence and quick reflexes, he proved himself time and time again useless to John in every respect.
John reaches out and traces the path from Sherlock’s hip bone down the vee of his pelvis.
“Do I. Do I have…?”
They kiss.
John needs Sherlock to tell him, but senses that Sherlock isn’t ready yet. He obfuscates, John can see him coming up with lies, his eyes darting away when John has asked him directly. It makes John ache to see it.
I paused as he rewet my lips, his other hand still cupping the back of my head, holding me close.
In the mirror I watched as John took a handkerchief from his pocket and laid it on the chair between my knees. My ever proper doctor. Even while planning an elicit rendezvous for us he hadn’t forgotten the particulars of the thing: the inevitable clean up. If it was possible I loved him a little more in that ridiculous, endearing moment.
He imagines a boy barefoot in the garden just behind them, brandishing a wooden sword at the roses. He has a wild thatch of auburn curls and mischief in the one eye that isn’t covered with a black eye patch and is shouting at brigands and rapscallions hiding in the hedgerow.
John is pretty sure he will remember the sound of Sherlock’s laughter forever. The uninhibited sweetness of it. The raw happiness. Raucous and hoarse and pure. John collects them like sea shells, storing them away for later.
Is he a donor? A new board member? A government trustee here to check on the library’s use of its grants? John’s thoughts race about in a panic.
John swallows it back down.
He shrugs on his jacket as he comes around the bed and joins Sherlock in the doorway.
Sherlock settled Charlie at the table on his patio and went inside to make the tea. As he moved around the kitchen, gathering the supplies, he watched as Charlie sat quietly at the table, legs swinging, ladybug antennae swaying in the light breeze, her eyes upturned. Sherlock followed the direction of her gaze and watched as John took the woman’s arm and led her back up the stairs and into the house. When Sherlock looked back the girl was bent forward and clicking her tongue at Carrot who was slinking along the driveway, escaped, no doubt, when John’s mum had provided the opportunity. Charlie gathered the cat onto her lap where he curled up into a soft gingery heap.
The windows in the cathedral will be constructed from chips of glass glazed all the shifting colours of his eyes. You’ll stand in it and be stained cerulean, aqua, celeste, cyan, iris, violet, viridian, turquoise, teal, azure, tiffany, midnight. You kneeling on a sandstone floor, flags of ochre coloured rock the exact shade of his skin, the exact colour of a beach in the south of France that you once traipsed across with your grandmother’s hand in yours and the blue blue ocean and the blue blue sky stretching for fathoms before and above you.
“Sod your puzzle.”
The shallow husk of their breaths fill the quiet space.
“How’d it happen? Did you get soused one evening and shag by accident?”
John is watching him and Sherlock has never felt so in control. He wants to be used in every way possible by John. He wants to see how far he can go. He wants to test every limit he has.
“Of course.”
Muffled by the cock in his mouth.
“You should care if I’m clean, Sherlock.”
3 cracked ribs. 1 broken wrist. 1 concussion.
Again.
And yet, John can feel it.
“All right, now answer. Overwhelm you how?”
Sherlock shut his eyes against her.
It had started to rain lightly. Droplets caught in John’s fringe as he stepped outside. The beech trees behind him glowed in the white light from the low-hanging clouds, their gold and green leaves shimmering in the wind, glossy and wet. “Great. What time?”
“Well, they would wouldn’t they?” Sherlock says, moving into the room, sidestepping smoothly around the blood stains on the pale blue carpet. The thick pile sinks beneath his shoes as he squats down and takes out his magnifier to look more closely at the ashtray. John thinks it looks like the one Sherlock nicked from Buckingham Palace ages ago.
The affection with which John speaks has a visible impact on Sherlock, who practically glows after the affirmation.
The frictious burn of John’s mouth grazes the ridge of Sherlock’s clavicle next, his tongue sweeping out to soothe after each pass. “You love how I mark you wherever I kiss you. How your skin remembers my touch long after I’ve left it,” John says, thumbing the raw, abraded skin, which is no doubt a scorched and scoured red, before licking it, kissing it, sucking it.
“They didn’t,” Sherlock says, reaching across the table for the sheaf of newsprint. He stabs a finger at articles in three separate sections, on three separate pages. “Here, and here, and here.”
It feels impossible now that he will get it.
“Please,” John whispers. Trembling. Sherlock’s fingers circling his right nipple. One hand on John’s belly: open.
He has only himself to thank for that small kindness. There has always been a thorn inside you. Of sadness, of difficulty, of shame. Pricking, pricking. Until him you had been nothing but bramble and briar, but among the thicket there is now the odd bloom or two.
. In bed. It’s where people are at their most vulnerable. Sleeping or fucking, they’re at their most unprotected. The entire concept of this place, John thinks, is to encourage people to delve into that place. To get to know their bodies and find pleasure in them. To get in touch with their desires and feel empowered by them. To find people to enjoy their bodies with. To consent to transformative experiences, facilitated through toys, sexuality, acceptance, exploration, connection, support.
“Have a nice mini-holiday, John.”
Sherlock looked at him, very confused. What on earth was he talking about?
“Mercy,” Sherlock pants, writhing, hips bucking, trying to unseat him. “Mercy, John.”
A susurration of hot breath and skin.
“Then why doesn’t he just buy the company? Why spend so much to buy Watson Tech?”
Useless; it springs back instantly.
A moan.
“No? I do believe some of your closest friends are farmers, are they not?”
“Not accurately.”
“What the hell, Sher—“
The sound he makes when he spills inside your mouth, when he bursts hot and thick across your tongue, when he throbs and throbs and is lost utterly to pleasure, that sound is just for you. So are the ones he makes when he draws you up his body, his hands cupping your cheeks. The satisfied hums he makes as he tastes himself on your tongue are for you and you alone. He wraps himself around you and gives you his mouth and his breathless smiles and grateful praise. Gives you his tiny whimpering moans when your hard cock rubs against his spent one. His whispered gentling words as he rolls you onto your back, they’re just for your ears. The quiet shushing movements of his hands over your shoulders and down your sides. The sound your heart makes in your ears when he straddles your thighs and rises up above you, whiskey-gold and glowing, they’re all for you.
As if he is indelible.
“You make a beautiful, beautiful gift, Sherlock,” John says, his voice soft and reverent in the darkness that Sherlock floats in. Sherlock feels it surround him, cradling him. “What next?”
Sherlock is breathless. His curls in disarray. His face red. His cock hard.
He feels, against him, Sherlock tremble.
When he gets home John knows what he’ll be doing. And he knows what it’s going to lead to and all he feels, if he's being perfectly honest, is excited.
Sherlock springs free and bumps against John’s cheek. John takes him in hand and guides him forward. With a long, slow slide Sherlock slips thick and hot between John’s lips. The round head heavy on John’s tongue.
John undoes his belt buckle, draws down his zip and lifts his arse off the seat.
Interlocks his hands over his sternum as if he’s settling in for a bit of a chat.
“Yes. Only one point will make a connection. You’ll feel it in your hands,” Sherlock says as John leans forward. “The sparks. Sometimes it’s stronger for the person holding the wand than it is for the one on the receiving end. You might go a bit numb. Is that ok?”
* * * * * * * * * * * * *
“Just last week you told the chippy that his brother in law was sleeping with his daughter.”
Sherlock’s being an impossible git. Has been all day. This morning: sawing away at his violin until he had woken John up to put the coffee on to perk. Shouting abuse at Lestrade on his mobile for twenty-six minutes. Being short with Mrs. Hudson when she had stopped by to drop off the post. After lunch he had been bouncing off the walls, pacing the living room rug while it rained and rained outside. A monsoon in December and John was trapped, irritation building and building as the day wore on.
“What?” John said, touching the top of her head fondly. Sherlock felt the hot stone return to the back of his throat at the obvious affection glowing between them.
But, then again, he’s never wanted to before either.
Sherlock had run away from his last failure and now he found that it had followed him here.
John sighs. “It’s not nonsense. I told you at the beginning, nothing is set in stone. We are always in flux, always changing, we have to acknowledge that and adjust.”
He moans.
Ella had given him his language back.
“All right, all right.” John says, soothing him with a stroke of his hand and a quieter kiss than the last. “Tell me what to do.”
Christ.
Sherlock names it. “This feels ominous.”
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
“Hey, are you hungry?” John asks, wanting to keep the momentum going. “I could murder some fish and chips right now. What do you think?”
“So I’ve just been a means to an end this entire time,” he says flatly, absorbing the gut punch of this realisation.
**********
I stood, my knees aching, pain sparking up the backs of my thighs, something wild inside my chest, I pushed your shoulders flat against the car.
As Sherlock scoots back towards the wall, arranged on his side so that John can join him, John begins to undress. He does so with deliberate slowness, giving Sherlock’s body time to calm and his breathing to even out.
Clara shakes her head reproachfully at Harry and mutters, “Not the time, Harriet.”
Beneath him Sherlock pushes back, getting his feet squared beneath him. John straightens, dropping his arms as Sherlock turns to face him.
“Queermas?” John asks, distracted, peering down the length of his body to have some warning as to what Sherlock is going to do next.
Sherlock nods, his eyes watching John in what John is coming to know as Sherlock’s own particular brand of penetrating. He’s a composition of opposites: porcelain and armor, perception and innocence. Like he could guess your darkest secrets (like tickling someone to get them to stop hiding their scar), but be unaware of how to work the hob. At the same time that his contradictions confound John, they intrigue him as well. John feels drawn to him.
John hears the taps groan as Sherlock turns them off. A shiver skates down his spine, he prickles with goosebumps. Pausing, he quickly turns up the heat on the thermostat before leaning into the jamb.
The air on his cheeks was sharp and cold and made his nose run slightly. Sherlock tucked his quilt under his chin and yearned to stay burrowed in his warm nook in bed. He spread his toes wide beneath the quilt and stretched, spine popping, achilles pulling taut, shoulders rolling forward and back, arms reaching up, hands tangling with the bed posts. A long, low moan of pleasure escaped him, rumbling out into the stillness of the room. He enjoyed the sensation of his body waking up, felt his nerves spark, his mind slowly coming online. Allowing himself a few more minutes of warmth and comfort before he would have to make the trek to the loo across the bare artic floor, he turned onto his side and hugged his pillow to his chest, surveying the view of his backyard out the three windows that lined the northern wall of his bedroom.
Sherlock pauses, dipping his chin, and letting a drizzle of saliva drop down. John feels it hit off the right side and he pushes his hips up, as Sherlock’s fist slides down, smearing the heat of his mouth down John’s shaft.
“You clever bastard.”
He nudges his nose down Sherlock’s smooth, freshly shaven cheek and sets his mouth against Sherlock’s ear. “You’ll finish going over the figures that Reina gave you and then you’ll go to your apartment and gather whatever you need. When you have everything head over to my house and wait for me there. I’ll be home by 7.”
“So hard,” John agrees, his hands clenched on top of his knees, waiting for the next order.
feeling is just beginning to unfurl, so close to where, if he could just, could just reach it, you would blossom completely, all protections gone. It’s terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. “Sherlock. Lube. Where?”
The bastard.
The look in his eyes is commanding and Sherlock, although he doesn’t understand why, sees that John wants him to stop. So Sherlock helps tuck him away, helps him zip up, and with one last stroke of John’s thumb over his cheek, retreats back under the table just as the video ends and the Novarsky man gets up to turn on the lights.
When he does, the shave of silver eyes over John’s body is close and meticulous. John is sure it does not miss one single hair. The razor of Sherlock’s mind knows every curve and contour, every freckle, every scar. He will know what John had for lunch by the dirt on his shoes, and exactly where he had been and who he had seen by the way John’s collar lies.
“I’ve never seen you afraid of vulnerability before,” he says, baffled.
After having consulted his journal one more time, he grabbed fresh cypress-wood baseboards, his bee smoker and a ball of baling twine and newspaper for tinder, matches, and a large container of sugar syrup that he had mixed up yesterday. He added to this a few new covers, his frame grips, a pry bar, a small upholstery hammer, a bag of nails, and his bee suit. He double checked that the metal lock-box in the corner of his trunk had enough medication to dose all ten hives if necessary and enough alcohol to complete a bee wash to check infestation levels. Varoa mites were the biggest threat to his colonies right now and had carried off nearly half of his hives in his first year of beekeeping. The last thing he added were ten large concrete bricks he would use to ensure that the covers stayed in place over the winter.
“You’re not,” John says, laughing. “But I didn’t say anything about me laying a finger on you.”
This time Sherlock meets him with his tongue, and John groans, opening his mouth and leaning in until their bodies are flush against each other, John resting in between Sherlock’s legs, his back bowed as Sherlock arches over him. Sherlock’s mouth is hot and wet, his tongue silky and insistent against John’s own. He tastes of figs and milk tea; sweetly sharp. John threads his hands into Sherlock’s hair. Holds on. The soft skin of Sherlock’s cheeks juxtaposed against the sandpaper strafe of the stubble along his jaw is sending tiny thrills scintillating along John’s nerve endings. It’s new. Different. And more than a little exhilarating.
John sears a steak and makes a simple salad and then goes to his room to dress for bed.
The words burst out and John can’t be sure where exactly they come from but they feel like they’re torn up from somewhere deep. He thinks of roots, blanched and hairy, ugly, misshapen things that grow in the cold and dark earth. Buried. Secret. The words rasp in his throat. “He wouldn’t hurt himself. He would want to live.”
Blood.
Plummets down into his stomach.
“I think perhaps we might just change the nature of the game,” John says, stroking Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock, feeling steady enough to meet his eyes, pulls back just far enough to look at him.
“I want to give you whatever you want.”
, yeah.”
“I want—“
You hear, muffled through down and cotton, the sound of his chuckle as he jostles down beside you. Snakes his arm around you and pulls you snug against him. You peek out and there he is, nudging his happy mouth down to yours.
Tomorrow John will regain his human form again and it will be another three months until they can come back.
Mist shrouded the ground, hiding all but the rooftop peak of his honey shed in the distance. The seasons seemed to have changed almost overnight, a coolness seeping in through the window sashes and lodging in the floorboards. They chilled the soles of his feet as he finally made his way to the bathroom, prickling his skin up in goosebumps, and rocking him up onto his tiptoes as he first encountered the icy tiles.
, Sherlock thought, as he sipped his tea.
His blood beats close to the surface.
A long, desperate rasp from John’s dry throat slips from his parted, panting lips as Sherlock’s fingers slide just inside.
“How about you give me one item of clothing for every question that I answer?”
“For some weeks now.”
“Shall we?” I said instead, coughing into the back of my hand as the liquor burned it’s way down my throat.
And deeper still.
Sherlock shakes his head, disgust and anger warring on his face. “You won’t tell anyone we’re engaged. I’m like a guilty secret you’re keeping. It makes me doubt whether or not you even want this. Whether you even want me! You took the time to bare your soul to your sister who you’re not even particularly close too and couldn’t tell me. What does that say, John? Tell me. Because to me it seems like you don’t trust me.”
“Darling, our flat’s much too small,” Evan said, patting her hand.
A very grave blunder indeed.
How long? He’d been approached by Novartis before Sherlock was hired, but the deal had been sweetened considerably soon after Sherlock had been taken on as his assistant. That was also when he had begun to be relentlessly pursued by them. John had thought, at the time, that it was because Qwest had entered their counter offer, but it seemed it had been much more sinister than that. What was Moriarty’s aim?
Sherlock moaning as John pulls out and rubs the thick hard heart hammering blood beating head of his cock against the swelling, blossoming red, red, so red, opening of Sherlock
The bar is dark, lit by black light, the dance floor a kaleidoscope blur of bright colours, bodies and faces painted in neon UV paint, white shirts writhing eerily, and teeth flashing like a strobe light as people sing and smile while they dance.
“I wouldn’t have guessed you for the hopeless romantic, Clara,” John says, digging his fork into the butter tart closest to him.
John watches it flare red, a firefly igniting, there and gone, before Sherlock grinds it beneath his heel.
“What about tying me up?”
Sherlock’s forelock falls over his eye as he lets his head roll onto his shoulder. Cheeks flushed.
One hand on Sherlock’s chest, John pins him to the wall.
Nodded. How could I forget? Those few lines sent from my mobile without a second thought had changed the course of my life forever.
“I—“ but the end of your sentence was lost as your teeth began to clack together noisily.
“I’m so sorry it felt like I stole your agency from you, Sherlock. I’m sorry that you feel exposed and that your privacy has been violated.” Tom sounded genuinely contrite. “Are you open to talking with me about how we can prepare for the next time something like this might happen? I also want to spend some time talking about the next week or so as these new painful memories resurface and how I can support you.”
He’s sweating. His palms. Under his arms. In the backs of his knees. He shifts against the sheets. They stick to his back, his buttocks, his calves.
“Every day when you were dead I wished you weren’t,” John says, quietly.
at you, and wanted you.
“You’ll just have to come back another time then,” Sherlock said, standing. “The bees will be happy to have a visitor.”
“Do you remember the day we met?” he said over me, softly cutting me off.
“Arrrgh,” he moaned, scrubbing frantically at his lips with the back of his hand, all while trying to push Quinn off his chest with the other.
If John gives him what he needs will he not need John anymore?
“Trevor and the other boys wanted to be groomed to enter the business world. Shadowing me was helpful to what they wanted to ultimately achieve. But that’s not what you want is it?”
Sherlock shifts on the bed. “You’ll laugh.”
“I’ll fetch Charlotte,” John said, his hand dropping down by his side. “She’ll probably be ready for her bed too.”
John doesn’t say anything. Can’t. He shifts, up onto his knees on top of the seat to make room for Sherlock. Hands pressed to the cold glass of the passenger window. Knees spread, arse in the air, his hole stuffed full, stretched wide. Gravity pulls them lower, he can feel the largest bead resting against his body’s entrance.
This time Sherlock goes slow, lets John do the work, just sitting on it as John plunges it in and out.
sexual encounter. Quick, furtive wanks in the shower or porn driven furious slapdash race to the finish type wanking, and sometimes, very rarely, a leisurely Saturday wank when he woke from a particularly vivid dream to a bit of morning wood and he had time to indulge.
“I used to be a private detective,” Sherlock said, hoping he wouldn’t have to go into much more detail.
“Is it safe?”
John adjusts himself and shakes his head.
John feels a cold chill lodge in his spine. This is far more serious than he had first thought. If Sherlock holds Moriarty’s secrets then he poses a threat to the man that no one else in the world did. He had no reason to keep Sherlock alive so why was he?
“There are going to be times in the days ahead when I need to be the one in control.”
John can feel the blood hammering against the cock ring, his orgasm stymied, it eddies and pools, water pushing against a dam, and then John can feel it start to
“His name is Toby,” I said.
John shifted in his seat, his head dropping towards Sherlock’s to hear him. Their shoulders brushed as John settled, facing forward. “I’m not sure. I think there might be a higher risk of losing the hives, as you said, they are vulnerable, but I’ve also heard Noor, the beekeeper I’m meeting with, say that her bees naturally select for the ones who are immune to mites, disease, etc. and so her hives adapt over time and are stronger for it. I’m not sure what it would mean for output; I don’t believe Noor sells her honey.”
He does need a bit of cheering up.
John meets his gaze, but he knows that Sherlock can see that there’s something else there. John hopes he doesn’t ask him why because he’s not even sure he knows. It’s something to do with being caught unawares. Unprepared. That space. He remembers that uncomfortable feeling of not belonging. It’s irrational, he can see that, but still… he’s tired. It’s true.
John scrunches his brow. “For what?”
“How does it work?”
Sherlock bends at the waist, settling himself over John, his hands curling around John’s biceps. “Then you will stop talking nonsense.”
“You want to know what I thought about?” he asks, leaning down to kiss Sherlock, soft and slow. “At first I just felt it. I had never experienced anything like it before. I had never come that hard. Never. Not by myself and not with a woman. It took over my brain. I was a fucking prostate monk. I practiced every day. I couldn’t think about anything else, besides when I would be able to put something up my arse again.”
“Can we pick one now?”
The boxes are, thankfully, stacked four high in front of the windows that look out on the office where a few detectives sit at their computers.
“Take it off,” he whispers in your ear a moment later, scrambling off your lap and reaching for his belt. He turns, walking around to the other side of the bed, as you stand, a bit wobbly, on weak knees.
who is recording a podfic. Fandom you have my heart forever and ever. This community continues to astound me and save me. Thank you to everyone who read along with me as I wrote. Thank you to everyone reading now. Thank you to everyone who kudos and commented and rec'd and reblogged and shared with others. Thank you, thank you, from the very bottom of my heart, thank you.
His stubble bristles at the edges of John’s mouth, making John’s blood fizz and snap to the surface of his skin.
“You want some more?” John is panting. He doesn’t care. He feels as if he is about to explode. He watches as he glides in and out of Sherlock’s mouth, the corners red and raw, stretched out from his own cock. “Yeah?” Sherlock nods and makes a needy noise in the back of his throat as if that’s just what he wants.
He's not sure there are any.
Hey y'all- I have a request to make. If you're not enjoying this story, if you wish I were writing it differently, if you wish John was some other way, or Sherlock was, that is your right as a human and a reader. I am writing this story the way I want John and Sherlock to be. I'm writing this story to heal something about masculinity that is harmful to me. I'm writing this story because I need tenderness and consent and trust AND kinky sex.
“I’m sorry,” I gasped. “Forgive me, please. I—“
Enough
John nodded, concern or compassion, or some mixture of the two, wrinkling the corners of his eyes. “Yeah, I get that.”
“You don’t even know what I was going to say.”
Sherlock cuts him off. “I’m not going anywhere. It’s you who leaves when things get confrontational.”
“Ohhhhhh,” Clara breathes, eyes flaring wide at the possibility of a really juicy secret.
Mouths open, tongues meeting.
Sherlock draws in a sharp breath, and lets it rush back out, “Yes.”
“Oh, Daddy, please.”
John stands dripping on the rug, just inside the door of New Scotland Yard, and runs a hand through his hair. Raindrops scatter from his fingertips, a spray of gold flakes winking as they catch the light and fall.
“Good. Sherlock, you’re so, so good.”
“Did you just…?” John asks, amazed.
“Apple juice.”
“What? What am I not going to get away with?”
“I thought you didn’t want to play,” Sherlock murmurs, dipping his head down, his lips just brushing beneath John’s right ear.
John loves him.
Naked, John stands before Sherlock, who looks up at John from his place on his knees.
Then it’s easy. John can finally breathe. Can bear down on Sherlock’s cock and breathe and take him inside, take him deeper.
You could read the worry it wrought in the lines on John’s face. The man must feel very much alone, Sherlock thought, remembering the way John had hung his head in his hands at Sherlock’s kitchen table. The faux sunniness of his profusion of exclamation points, which had seemed out of character, a false front for Charlotte perhaps? Sherlock could easily imagine the girl pestering her father to confirm the date for when she could see the bees again. Or perhaps it was just genuine, exhausted gratitude for the loan of Sherlock’s sugar, which must have felt something like grace on a night when the shops had closed and his daughter, new to school and uprooted from her old life, had dropped the information on him as a nasty, albeit innocent, surprise.
**********
“What is it?” he asked, his body warm and familiar against mine.
“You and Sherlock.”
“Yes. John. Of course. Yes.”
Sherlock straightens once more but doesn’t turn around. John can feel the cold air from the fridge waft against his chest and shins. Goosebumps break out on his arms. He takes a step closer, one hand curling around Sherlock’s waist. The navy silk is liquid against his palm as he draws it up to cup Sherlock’s ribs. He feels the sharp intake of breath as Sherlock’s ribcage expands when John tugs the collar aside with his other hand and presses his lips to the nape of Sherlock’s neck.
“No, it’s all right.”
“I can find work in town. I’m better now. I—“
You stroke him, feel him flex against your palm: thick, spit slicking the way, foreskin gliding around the core of him. The bed sheets rouche into rumpled bunches in his fists and he’s making sounds drawn up from deep in his chest, rumbling.
“I’m not making much sense am I?”
It's never happened before, Sherlock thinks, as he kneels, back bent, stomach pressing into his knees, beneath the conference room tables, waiting for the pre-lunch meeting to begin. It happened, the crying, of course it had, in scenes before this. The journey into sub space could be overwhelming, the body flooded with hormones and pain and pleasure all at once. His eyes had watered, he had cried, but he had never felt so overcome that he had
“Yes. God, yes.
His fingers fumbling blindly between you. The last of your buttons undone.
“When will you trust me?”
And yet, when Sherlock truly plumbs his instincts, on which he has relied for his entire life, they are all telling him to trust John.
It’s old. The midnight blue velvet is almost rubbed completely off.
“And what’s different about this particular boy?”
He laughs, giggling again, oh delightful sound, and grips the counter in front of him. “I was going to make you eggs.”
Sherlock’s eyebrows do a complicated sort of dance.
for me and the
Like he would with a clit.
“Not something I’d feel entirely comfortable sharing with my sister.”
6:34.
Flesh stinging.
There are five in all.
“You were quiet tonight,” John remarks when you’re back in your hotel room. He sets the keycard down on the dresser and leans against it, facing you. You sit on the bed, toe off your shoes, and shrug. You reach for him.
His cock hangs heavy between his legs. Thick. Swollen. Throbbing. Dripping. John’s leaving sticky fingerprints all along the inside of his thighs in his haste.
“Wher-umph” He starts to ask, but you’re kissing him again aren’t you, so it bumbles against the roof of your mouth as you clutch him and turn him.
“Let’s stay here. Stay in bed all day. We could see how many times I can make you come.” The words are muffled against John’s Fair Isle Christmas jumper, red this year with white trim.
“Yes.”
“It was those robbers,” Mary says, her eyes glossed over with tears. “Those ones in the dailies. The Lewisham gang that keeps breaking into hotel rooms! I saw them! They tied me up and they did…they did…” She points a shaking finger at the adjoining door to the bedroom next door. “They did that to Billy. They took all of my jewelry and cheers’d over Billy’s body before they left out the window.”
John’s eyes are as changeable as the color of the ocean, and right then they were navy, dark with storm and heavy lidded.
For one night he hadn’t been the invalid with a shoulder blasted apart by a bullet and a hand tremor that had permanently put him out of his former line of work. Hadn’t been the boring librarian who was wracked by anxiety and insomnia and nightmares that left him a sweating sobbing mess pretty regularly.
Clara sighs. “Nothing you can do will ever be enough, John. You can only love them and try to help them, but it’s their decision in the end. You can’t force them, you can’t choose sobriety for them. They have to want it. Do you think Sherlock wants it?”
“I saw him at the hospital last week,” Molly Devers said, shaking her head. She was a nurse. “Couldn’t bring myself to mention it to him. His granddaughter’s fighting for her life. Poor man, poor lass.”
John has worked himself into a proper rage by the time he shoves his key into the lock of 221B.
The breeze has died and you’re both sweating in the gauzy air, fingers sticking, tacky, skin like a salt lick leaving your tongue parched and thick in your mouth. The clock on your mantle strikes midnight.
“Ok, sure, fine,” Sherlock finally says, though it looks as if he has a sour taste in his mouth. “Best get on with the training then.”
“You did! I know you did! I’m sorry I ruined—“
Looking down the length of his body John sees his heels dug into Sherlock’s shoulder blades, his thighs pressed to his ears, his cock thick and red with blood and dripping on his belly, and Sherlock’s thatch of wild black curls, face buried in John’s arse, John’s hands wrist deep in their roiling depths.
“I’ll take that shower then.”
It’s a gift.
Just as the door swings shut behind them John’s mobile pings.
You could have been referring to anything. The number of minutes I would have to come. The number of fingers you would use on me. The number of times I would be denied. The number of days you would be gone from our bed.
“Which is where?” Sherlock takes another bite from the apple and the crunch sounds loudly in the quiet room.
“Require it?” The way he turns red is rather delightful.
John swallows hard at this devastating description and the callously cold way Sherlock delivers it. “He must feel really grateful that you’re here with him as he goes through this.”
“I don’t know.”
“And what was that?”
“This is where I would come,” Sherlock says. “Before.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicker down to the camera screen.
Sherlock scrambles to stand when John straightens and goes over to the dresser, already tugging off his jacket. Having fetched two bottles from the top drawer, which he sets down on top, John turns and hangs up each item Sherlock hands him in the closet. Upon landing in New York they’ll be immediately taken to a hotel where they can get a few hours sleep before John meets with Irene Adler, nee Novarsky, the CEO of Novarsky Inc. at 8am.
The light is off in Sherlock’s bedroom.
“She was not interested in me,” I said tightly. To me you were being spectacularly unfair. “It was you she was trying to land.”
John digs his fingers into Sherlock’s belly, holding him with his knees so that he can’t get away and Sherlock practically shrieks, twisting about desperately below him.
“Sherlock…” he growled in warning.
He rides him. Hips rolling forward and back. Sherlock lets him move. His hands on John’s arse cheeks, pulling him open, wider and wider.
You were a marvel. Taciturn and sulky and infuriating and lovely and kind and intelligent and genuine all at once.
“Could we just, you know, enjoy your party? We can talk about this later surely?”
, over John and John goes. Lying down. Pinned by the hungry look in Sherlock’s eyes.
John shrugs out of the robe.
He throws the door open and steps out into the back alley. Sherlock is ahead, to John’s right, turning the corner.
“What are you ashamed of John?”
John pulls just far enough away so that Sherlock can look down at John’s lips, just millimetres from his own.
“Don’t you think that’s a tad harsh?” Molly said, her eyebrows rising to meet the white fringe of her pixie cut.
“I was minutes away from calling
Clara waits a beat and then says gently, “John, the truth is, you don’t know.”
“The whole country’s run amok with it,” Ellen said, shaking her head. Sherlock glanced at Evan to take their reaction. They sipped their tea, staying out of it, but Penny’s hand was in theirs, holding tight.
It’s a wonderful sight.
He closes his eyes.
“Will you do anything I ask John?”
“Oh.”
That love was not enough to make you whole?
**********
His body is trembling against John’s.
Harry has collapsed against her, giggling.
It doesn’t take long for him to sort out Mrs. Patterson. With a quick scan of her library card he logs her name on the signup form for their
They stay like that for how long John doesn’t know, long enough for his breath to slow and his heartbeat to sync to Sherlock’s, pressed chest to chest, close. It’s intimate in that way you can be with strangers sometimes, a specific closeness achieved through pure lack of relational history. Just bodies seeking connection and closeness simply for the sake of them.
“John, I—“
“Are you sure?”
“To put it mildly,” Sherlock says sardonically. “He’s not just a drug dealer or a human trafficker or funding terrorists through arms sales, he’s also involved in white collar crime. It entirely depends on the opportunity presented to him and what he stands to gain. He’s never at risk, he’s merely in the background, pulling the strings and reaping the rewards.”
John raises his eyebrows. Tucks his fingertips in towards his palms.
Reminds him.
He can remember, clearly, the conversation that they had had before John would agree to move back in.
“I’d have the controller…”
Somehow, how, you don’t know, because you’ve shut your eyes, haven’t you, you coward, somehow he finds it without having to leave you.
The ragged, animal sound of his breathing once more fills Sherlock’s ears.
“Joohhhnnnn…” Sherlock moans, shifting restlessly beneath him.
Smoke wreaths your head as you wait at lights, breathing in the petrol, asphalt sear of a summer day in London. You wander a bit. Ordinary Thursdays are rife for people gawking and people gawk you do.
There is nothing that can’t be solved if we are together.
And, added to the list as he arrived home, a baggie full of soft American-style chocolate chip cookies, burned to black on the bottom, sitting atop his bag of sugar on his back porch, with a note that said, in neat script with a left-handed slant and using an egregious amount of exclamation points, which Sherlock found strangely endearing in this case instead of irrationally irritating as usual:
Sherlock makes a disgruntled noise and pushes his arse into the air.
“Then take it,” Sherlock said, feeling a touch of disappointment as the torch of desire slowly faded within him, but also admiration that John didn’t want to rush into things, didn’t want to ruin what they had been building. Sherlock could admit it scared him too, to think of their relationship changing into something new, risking the friendship they had begun to create.
This thing he was asking of me, this promise, had seemed silly and unnecessary only a moment ago, but the question of my own moral turpitude still lingered, and so I said, “I promise. I promise.”
So Sherlock did the only thing he could think of, he made tea, and sat down to commune with the freshly conjured mistakes of his past.
you.”
“Oh—“ John starts to lean up, lungs crushed, no air, but Sherlock lays his hand on John’s chest and fits his mouth over John’s to silence him.
“Suck it,” he was saying at present, panting. His chest rising and falling quickly, his fingers clenched in my hair. “Oh, suck my cock like you mean it. That’s it. God, you’re such a slut for my cock. You suck it so good, Sherlock. So good. Oh, fuck.
“Kiss me,” I countered, slipping my hands behind your neck. “You haven’t kissed me yet.”
The man raised his hand when he saw Sherlock had noticed him. “Hi,” he called out, speeding up his steps slightly to reach Sherlock.
Sherlock shifts a little down, pointing himself up.
“I guess I am,” John says, smiling.
He had sat at the cliff’s edge sucking salty grease and crackling from his fingers, enjoying the crisp breeze and the sour burst of flavour from the grapes, tart on his tongue. The water had been churned to white caps as the wind picked up and Sherlock had eventually moved inland to escape its buffeting force to lie amongst the scraggly pines. He dozed on the sun dappled bed of brown needles and his thoughts turned once more to the Watsons. A host of tragedy and trauma seemed to have chased them to Sussex. They intrigued him.
“You flirt, Watson. It comes as naturally to you as being blonde or, or, the knack you have for commandeering my violin and ordering me to bed.”
John stows the food in the fridge and hangs up his coat, still dripping, on it’s peg. He tosses the Waitrose bag full of his soiled clothes down next to his chair. A sick infant with impeccable aim. His socks squeak on the lino as he walks through the kitchen; they’re soaked through. His trousers, a pair of navy blue scrubs borrowed from work, are in a similar state. It’d been absolutely pissing rain as he walked the last two blocks from the restaurant on Marylebone. The door to the en suite is open, steam thickening the air as John makes his way down the hallway. It’s dark in the flat, aside from the fairy lights on the mantle, twinkling amidst the pine boughs, and the light from the bathroom pools on the floor ahead of him, bright and liquid, shimmering.
“What? That was the logical question to ask after that specific observation.”
John mistakes it for a chill and, gathering Sherlock into his arms, lays them back into the water, floating, with Sherlock cradled on his chest.
His other hand closes gently around your left arm.
As John makes the drive across town to the 24 hour Tesco he thinks about the kind of indulgence Sherlock is suggesting and sits with the way he cringes at the suggestion that he implement the same philosophy into his own life. His knee jerk instinct is to dismiss it. No, not only to dismiss it, but to denigrate it as something not to be taken seriously. Wasn’t it just Sherlock’s addiction talking? Trying to justify itself? Wasn’t it just Sherlock in denial that he had a problem?
He moves a finger down to his perineum. It’s safe territory, already intimately explored. John’s a doctor after all. He understands the mechanics of prostate stimulation. He’s just never sought it out
“I want you to…” Sherlock licks his lips. Blushing. “I want you to suck me.”
“We talked about Carrot possibly offering his mousing services,” Sherlock said, mind and mouth finally working in unison.
“Like I said, I have a meeting right now.”
Sherlock reaches out, moving slowly, as if he’s afraid of spooking John.
The way he holds it when John is nuzzling his way around his groin. The black coils damp with sweat. He’s still soft and incredibly silky against John’s lips. A brush of John’s stubble over his sac and Sherlock contracts, his heels digging into John’s back. His cock throbs under John’s mouth, a rush of blood and bone and desire.
“Ah, a bit restive, hmm?” He noticed that the bees
“Sherlock, come here,” John says, softly, his eyes so dark and full of emotion. His hands run down the insides of his thighs and Sherlock watches as John’s cock, lying soft along the crease where his leg meets his hip, slowly begins fill. “I want you inside me. Now.”
Now John looks stunned. He steps back from Sherlock, hands dropping away, down, into fists.
You palm his ribs, rub your thumbs over his nipples, the hair on his chest springing up around them, wiry and wet. You run the tip of your tongue over the gleaming coils and taste the soap tinged musk. He moans and arches and shivers, pushing into your hands, his breath coming in short hot little bursts above you. His hips shift on the bed, restless, and you pin him with your hands.
The pads of his fingers are rough with printed whorls and ribbed with fine-edged callouses. John opens his mouth and runs his tongue down their length, tastes the bitter scrim of soap and the faintly metallic quality of his skin. John closes his lips and sucks them deeper, opening his throat and letting them glide until his lips brush the cool, gold band at the base. Sherlock breathes out shakily.
Sherlock stops them just inside the threshold to their bedroom. His hands slip up to cradle John’s face and his kisses turn slower, deeper, more tender. John is lost in them. When his knees hit the bed, he sits down hard, dazed. It is Sherlock’s turn to kneel, head bent as he unties John’s shoes, the wild, frayed ends of his curls lit by the light from the kitchen. They halo him.
“Sherlock?” He sounds concerned.
How does he make Sherlock understand?
Heat fell in a crash down my spine to pulse in my groin.
“I wouldn’t want to bring this to your doorstep. Not when you’ve been… not when you’ve given me so much.”
He stops to drop his duffle off inside Harry’s sitting room and takes a moment to wipe his clammy palms on his trousers and to run his fingers through his hair before he climbs the stairs to Clara’s.
There is a loose board at the top of his stairs that squeaks when you put your whole weight on it.
Sherlock fetched the keys from his pocket and opened the door to the honey shed. John looked up at them as the door whined on its hinges. Sherlock called, “Just grabbing her a notebook. Back in a second.” John gestured, looking harried. “Sorry I’m being so rude, I’ll be finished soon. It’s Charlotte’s mum. The schedule’s gotten a bit mucked up.”
“No harm in that, I suppose,” Noor said. “How’s next week, Tuesday? Say, 10am?”
,” John repeats, slowly, unfolding his arms.
are doing just fine. I told you, there’s nothing to worry about.”
He’s grinning softly down at you, grateful that you understood, sitting starkers beside you, peering at you through the tiny window. His hair is sticking up all over and there’s a mole you didn’t notice the night before, inked on the inside of his bicep. He’s unbearably handsome and tawny as a river rock bathed in the translucent light of early morning streaming in through the open window behind you. By some chance that beggars belief, he’s in
I squeezed my eyes shut and thought,
A wet spot appears on the white tablecloth, as Sherlock is wracked with overwhelming waves of sensation.
John shakes his head.
Charlotte snorted in the back seat, her head jerking up, her eyes slitting open. She made an unhappy moan and rubbed at them, looking around the car in confusion.
“Just let me finish, ok?”
John cocks his head, considering.
**********
Tasting: the salt animal tang of his skin, earthy and warm.
The sonata perfectly captured the wild bacchanalian spirit of the summer harvest. The jubilee of leaving the hive in the morning, the frolic and revel among the blossoms, and the drunken swerving amble back to the hive after the feast.
Yes, I kissed him on the first day I met him.
The thoughts became so intruding that Sherlock finally gave up trying to outrun them, set down the book he was trying and failing to focus on, and closed his eyes. He stretched his legs out in front of him, his socked feet thrust into a warm pool of sunlight pouring in through the window above him. He crossed his arms across his chest and burrowed his shoulders into the armchair.
“Is that Charlotte’s school?” Ellen asked. John and Penny nodded. “I guess I wouldn’t necessarily think that Sussex was particularly affirming or inclusive as compared with London, so that’s wonderful to hear.”
American foulbrood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and can remain viable for more than 40 years in honey and beekeeping equipment. Therefore, honey from an unknown source should never be used as bee feed, and used beekeeping equipment should be assumed contaminated unless known to be otherwise.
Sherlock’s lips twitch at this suggestion and he looks at John slightly askance as if he is surprised and amused that John has posed it.
“Get your fingers wet and touch your nipples, Sherlock.”
That’s about the time that he notices the pink vibrator buzzing happily away an inch or two below the main spectacle.
You never knew a kiss could feel like this.
Please mind the new tags.
“I. I don’t know.”
“How about we go home and have some of that experimental sex now?”
In a primal, wild, wonderful way.
John has been holding back so far; his body ripples with the tension of being held in check, but Sherlock knows what to expect once John starts to come against his mouth. Sherlock buries his face against John in anticipation as finally, finally, John floods Sherlock’s mouth, clasping rhythmically around Sherlock’s tongue and there, there, his body loosens, gives into his instincts, all of him writhing down to twine itself around Sherlock.
“You tell me I’m beautiful, I’m gorgeous, how I feel so tight and hot around your cock,” Sherlock says, his voice taking on a drunken laziness now, as he trails his hands up his stomach to play with his nipples. His thighs bunch and shake as he raises himself up and then back down, his cock flushed a deep brooding red, his bollocks pulled in against his body. “You tell me to move, to ride you, that you want to feel me come on your cock…”
to slap that tight pretty hole with the head of his leaking prick,
John’s voice is low and firm as he interrupts. “Maybe not, but I think you were going to.”
“You are inordinately enamoured of my hands.”
Sherlock makes a helpless noise and John, wanting to hear it again, chases him back, one hand flat against the hot plane of Sherlock’s chest, one hand on the hard cut of his hip, turning him, pushing him, until Sherlock is pressed flat against the wall to their left.
His skin under your white hands: peach, citron, rose.
John had almost forgotten.
“Never?”
He pulls his shoulders back and nods at Sherlock before climbing up and in.
“There are three types of honey bees: the queen, the worker, and the drone. The queen is the leader of colony. She is the only bee who mates with male bees and lays eggs. The drone is a male bee whose only job is to try and mate with a queen. Drones are mainly produced in the spring when the queen takes her mating flight. They are otherwise a drain on colony supplies, eating essential honey and not providing any other service. They are eventually shut out of the hive as summer ends. The rest of the colony is made up of infertile female worker bees, who fill different roles over the course of their life: a nurse bee feeds and tends to brood, a house bee produces honey comb and keeps the hive clean, they also make honey from nectar, help ventilate the hive, and guard the hive entrance. Towards the end of their maturity they are foragers, bringing water, pollen, and propolis back to the hive.”
, John thinks.
Beating into the palm of Sherlock’s hand.
I nodded as you licked your lips.
“Wait here,” John says, smoothing Sherlock’s curls back from his forehead and looking him directly in his wide, confused eyes, before he leaves to make tea.
A tousle of silky black curls. Crystalline eyes. Barefoot in his pjs.
Sherlock’s cheeks lashed in red.
“It was. It was perfect and then I’ve had to be at the Yard all morning for
“Oh, um, your finger,” John said, and Sherlock stopped, looking out at him through the crack. “Keep it clean. You can remove the plaster and put a new one on tomorrow. It’ll be more of a nuisance than anything; until the nail grows back.”
Whiskey tumbler in one hand, cigarette in the other, your robe hanging off one shoulder, about to come untied, you stare.
Sherlock’s heart hadn’t recovered, was still flip flopping about his chest like a landed fish, when Ellen came up beside him, making him jump.
The next kiss is soft.
When they had gone John stood in the doorway that led to our bedroom and held out his hand.
“Could I buy you a pint or a coffee sometime?”
John had gone.
Remembers: the darkness and the wheeling-whirling-whipping neon lights synced to the beat of the bass, the pop-techno rhythm pounding like a drum in his chest, adrenaline fizzing beneath his skin.
So while the kisses have been manifold and plenty, the actual act of lovemaking had been sparse and few between. It was therefore a rare treasure for my cock to be hard of its own accord and filling John’s hand prodigiously and neither of us wanted to waste it. Offering up a silent prayer of thanks to Catullus I lowered myself onto my back, letting my legs fall open as John urged my jeans down over my thighs.
John tears at Sherlock’s belt.
It cracks through the silent car and out of the corner of his eye John can see Sherlock flinch.
Sherlock makes a small high pitched noise. Almost a whimper.
“You didn’t. Oh, God, John, you could never,” I said, horrified at the very thought.
“That’s really kind of you, but I wouldn’t want—” John said, his eyes darting between Sherlock and Zoe.
You pick up his hand from where it rests on the rise and fall of his breath, still warm from the beaten percussion of his heart, and lift it to your lips.
He considers what it would be like to tell John about it all. He feels like he's getting to the point where he won't be able to keep a secret of this magnitude for much longer without damaging the trust they're building. John is patient and he's not demanding Sherlock reveal all of his secrets at once, but it makes Sherlock's stomach twinge a bit to wonder what John will think of him when he knows about Sherlock's past.
