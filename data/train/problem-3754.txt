"And this‚Ä¶" Cas' eyes gleamed, "this makes you hard every time I do it." Cas yanked back his head by his hair, exposing more of his vulnerable neck and throat. Cas latched on to his pulse point, biting and sucking, lathing his skin with his tongue.
"Gonna be looking at you like this forever, Cas. I‚Ä¶ we need to talk about that. I want to run something by you‚Äînot now though. I'm gonna freeze my dick off if we don't get back inside."
chosen him, for now at least; and Cas might like women, but there was no way he could fake that kind of attraction to Dean. Maybe he should have stopped looking the sexy angel-shaped gift horse in the mouth years ago? Maybe he should stop second guessing everything and just ask?
"Do you have pajamas I can borrow?" Dean gestured towards the wardrobe, hoping the waving of his arms was doing a good enough job of asking Cas for permission to root though his clothes. It was too late (early?) for fully formed thoughts and questions. Dean was exhausted too.
Achingly hard now, Cas bucked his hips against Dean's, moving to where his neck and shoulder met to suck another dark red mark.
"I just feel useless and weak, Cas," Dean confessed, lowering his voice but fully aware that Sam could still hear him. "I'm sittin' around day after day, while you and my parents are doing all this shit, and I'm just waiting here like some fucking delicate flower."
Usually closed until 7pm, the Rock Garden had been transformed into a riot of balloons, streamers and confetti for the midday reception. Neither one of them had wanted a formal reception with a sit-down dinner, making small-talk and giving stilted speeches. Instead buffet tables occupied one end of the room, piled high with more food than Dean had seen in one place in his life. Small children were helping themselves to marshmallows and fruit, spearing them with skewers and then holding them in the thick, creamy, waterfall of chocolate that flowed down a mesmerizing chocolate fountain they'd hired for the day.
"So why does Dean have such a hold over you? The entire time I've known you, part of you has seemed to be on hold, just waiting for him to get his act together and realise what he's missing."
Back at the river, the sudden rush of icy cold took his breath away as his body sliced through the water. He stayed under until his lungs ached and his muscles burned, then he broke the surface, gasping in lungfuls of glorious air. Every day he did this, he managed to stay underneath for that fraction of a second longer‚Äîhis improved fitness the one single benefit of this hell.
I'd like to say a massive thank you to Mason and ValandraEvans for all their help, advice and for saving my readers from all the Britishisms I keep inadvertently trying to throw at them üòÅ
"It was always you," Dean whispered hotly into Cas' ear. "I didn't want to think about what that meant back then, but I know now. I
to go to Hell?" He'd be the first person in the history of the Universe to ask for a transfer when he got to Heaven.
"Why are you in such a good mood?" Dean asked his brother, eyes narrowing suspiciously. "If I get up and you've put a Christmas tree up, I‚Äôm going to hurt you. Repeatedly."
"Maybe your human nose needs time to adjust," Dean suggested with a glare that dared Sam to disagree. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we finish our food somewhere else? Leave Sam to think about how soundly he sleeps and how safe he really is from any repercussions‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright, you two. Can you maybe save the declarations for after I‚Äôve gone? I think you owe me a bit more than a garbled, nonsensical explanation before you go off and fuck each other in the bedroom."
"I know," Dean soothed, and instead of his face being buried in Cas' neck, he was pulling Cas' head gently down onto his shoulder. His hand slid up into Cas' hair, stroking down over the back of his neck and then back again, over and over again. "I know. I screwed up and we can't go back and I'm so fucking sorry, Cas."
The sky was covered in large, grey-yellow clouds, heavy with snow. Flakes were starting to scatter again, filling up their earlier footprints, erasing them as if they'd never been there at all. This time there was no time to enjoy the view, to look at the blanketed world around them. They walked fast, hand in hand, not speaking, never meeting another person‚Äîit was too late, too cold, too snowy for anyone else to be out. Christmas done, they were all tucked up warm in their beds.
"And so is Jack!" Amara bellowed back, helpless anger pouring from her in waves of barely suppressed violence. "He's gone, Dean! He's been kidnapped, taken from me, moved, hidden! I can't find him! He's been gone for weeks‚Äîsince before you left to look for Castiel‚Äîand I've been searching all this time, but nothing has turned up! I've lost him and I don't know what to do!"
Dean fought to control his breathing, clenching his hands into tight fists in an effort not to reach out and grab Cas. It was all he could do not to pin him to the bed and fuck him until he was a writhing, wordless, moaning-
"Will Sammy be okay?" his words were in an undertone, but Cas heard them and nodded his head almost imperceptibly.
‚ÄúC‚Äômon, Cas‚Äîopen your gift,‚Äù he predictably evaded with a smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes. Cursing himself for ruining the moment, Cas attempted to distract from the sudden awkwardness by tearing open his own large, lumpy parcel with slightly overexaggerated enthusiasm.
sort out," Cas denied, pulling his arm away in an attempt to save his sanity. He grabbed the bowl that held the tiny individual packets of sugar, toying with them just for something to do with his hands. He daren't shred the napkins here - Kate would kill him.
"I have absolutely seen that before," Sam nodded, solemnly. "Just not today, in this room." He was gone before the book Dean had on his bedside table bounced off the wall, centimetres from where his head had been moments earlier.
"Something to live for," Sam explained, simply, watching Cas carefully. "It's just a set on Friday and Saturday nights."
His body was covering Cas', pinning him to the bed with his hips. Dean had replaced his hands with his mouth, exploring the shivering, shuddering body underneath him with his tongue instead. He was feverish with it, moving from neck to chest, to hip, leaving hot, wet trails of open mouthed kisses in his wake. Cas was moaning and writhing underneath him in an sinfully uninhibited way, not seeming to care who heard him, not holding a single thought for shyness or shame. Fuck, it was glorious.
"It has been pleasant," Cas said, with a small shrug. "Although my bladder is telling me that I'm going to have to move soon."
"Hey," Cas murmured softly, catching his arm and halting his pacing. "We'll be out of here in no time, and you'll be drinking beer and looking at naked strangers with Sam before you know it."
By the time Cas was taking two fingers with ease, Dean was having to stop his assault on Cas' cock every few seconds, because, judging by the way he was holding his breath and the way his cock was throbbing against his tongue, Cas was going to come before Dean got to fuck him, and that definitely wasn't what Dean wanted to happen right then.
There was a moment where Dean just looked at him, held his gaze and waited. Then he reached out his free hand and wrapped it around the back of Cas‚Äô neck, holding on. His eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled at his friend.
"I think Dean can speak for himself, don't you, Sam?" Dean interrupted his brother with a warning glare. "Isn't something burning?"
Cas' cock jumped at his words, his hand speeding up, his wrist twisting each time he reached the head of his cock and Dean remembered how much he'd loved feeling that skilled hand on him, how those proficient fingers had brought him close with indecent speed.
‚ÄúKate, what you don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Cas said earnestly, his eyes flicking between Kate and Dean, ‚Äúis that there‚Äôs a freckle on Dean‚Äôs left asscheek that looks like a perfect letter C."
"Okay," Cas agreed, his voice soft, sleepy and affectionate in a way that Dean had never heard before, and it made his heart ache to hear it. "You should sleep."
"I despair of both of you!" Kate flounced out of the door, stopping to give Cas an exaggerated wink, before she danced back out to everyone else.
Just like before, nothing happened, except Dean felt like he might like Cas just a little bit less. Maybe this was how he was going to get over Cas? Cas could squeeze his pressure points and soak him with ice cold water until Dean could be in a room with him without wanting to fuck him up against every wall in turn.
"Because I've never seen you this upset before," Sam said gently. "Because we‚Äôre friends and you need someone right now. What did Dean say?"
"Don't," he pleaded, his voice breaking on the word. He couldn't say what he was pleading for - for Dean not to cast aside his confession like it was nothing? For him not to rubbish the most important moment in his life, the most important words he had ever spoken?
He stepped into Cas' space, their chests almost close enough to brush and Cas felt like the air around them had been suddenly sucked from the room.
The sofas were arranged around a huge old fashioned log fire under an oak mantelpiece, already piled high with logs, as if the owners hadn‚Äôt expected to leave when they did and had just readied it for their next use. It looked perfect for a cold November afternoon, and Cas wondered if it would be entirely wrong to drive back here once everyone had left to do his wallowing in front of a roaring log fire. He‚Äôd never sat in front of one before, but he had an idea that his now human senses would love the feeling of the heat warming his skin, the smell of the burning logs, the comfort of the orange flames dancing, licking at the wood. He found his feet moving towards that corner of their own accord.
"Two days too long," he sighed. "I helped my parents move out of Sam's and into their house yesterday. I need every bit of Cas goodness to erase the homophobia from hell I had to deal with all day. "
Paralised by his sadness, utterly void of hope, Cas stayed silent, and after a few minutes he heard a sigh and the familiar footsteps of Dean Winchester walking away.
He had to be doing this on purpose. It was some sort of cruel punishment for screwing him around, and it was perfect. It was working. Dean
Once he had finished his beautifully cooked breakfast, relieved himself, and showered, he wandered out into the main room to find Dean sprawled on his big, squishy sofa, watching TV.¬† Dean's attention was on some cooking show that Cas had seen him watch before, but Cas had never been very interested in it, so he had fiddled on his phone or read a book whenever it was on.
What happened the night before came rushing back to him, only serving to add to his already insistent morning erection. Cas had a near photographic memory, and the vivid images of Dean's beautiful, talented mouth wrapping around his cock as he looked up at him with actual wonder in his eyes‚Äîwell, that was something that Cas would be picturing in glorious technicolour every day for the rest of his life.
"There's so much I want to do with you, Cas. If it didn't involve letting go of you, I'd stop and make a damn list."
"You mean my heart fucking breaking? That little display? No. My reasons, they still stand. They're not some manipulation or trick. But if you're holding Jack to punish Cas, please don't. He's not done anything to you."
The knowing smile and familiar travesty of a wink from Cas brought Dean back to himself with a jerk, and he felt his cheeks colour in embarrassment as he finally heard Rowena, somewhat impatiently this time, asking for the rings.
Dean had deliberately driven the long way there, and even once they arrived, he'd parked and then insisted on kissing Cas until his eyes lost that haunted, sad look, and instead burned with want and need. By the time they'd straightened their clothes and smoothed their hair, the bar was full of people, laughing, drinking, and hopefully oblivious to the undercurrent of tension that flowed underneath everything‚Äîtension that shouldn't have even been there. Today was meant to be perfect, and getting your parents back should be cause for celebration, not stress and misery. Their family truly was fucked up.
Cas' eyes shot to Dean's, an acknowledgement passing between them that this might not all be insanity - they might actually be right.
"Kissing you is like a damn addiction," Dean growled against Cas' mouth, pulling back to yank at his t-shirt, pulling it over Cas' head as Cas raised his arms automatically. "I swear I've thought of nothing else since the very first one. You're such a fucking distraction."
‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt just Dean‚Äôs chest that seemed to have moved closer without either of them moving, but Dean‚Äôs mouth was so close to his now that Cas could feel his breath on his face.
Cas in Dean's own clothes was probably the sexist thing he'd ever seen, and he'd seen a great many appealing things in his lifetime. Dean knew he was a little possessive over Cas at times - he hated it when Meg, Crowley, waitresses and, well, anyone at all had flirted with his Angel. He wasn't sure what the deal with Kate was, but he disliked her for the possibility that there even was a deal to be had there. But the look of Cas in Dean's clothes, with his just fucked hair, his chin and jaw that were sporting some seriously sexy stubble and Dean's shirt clinging to a body that Dean just wanted to debauch - that was off the scale. Dean's previously flagging boner was back to being fully interested in the situation.
"You die, and you don't bother to tell me you're back? I only found out at all because Dean missed check-in!"
Never one to be known for his self control when it came to sex, Dean could feel his resolve wavering. Seeing Cas wearing nothing but a thin pair of navy blue pyjama bottoms, his upper body bared to him, all Dean wanted to do was explore every single bit of him. The dips and crevices; the hard muscular planes and the soft, pliant skin; the ticklish spots and the places that would make Cas moan - he wanted to chart that body like he was a fucking explorer.
Cas smiled. He'd missed them too. It was almost comforting to be around them, and there was a time when he truly never thought he would say that.
Kate turned away from them, rifling through her bag for her lipstick, which she re-applied, before looking back up at them.
Dean nodded. "I get that." It only felt like it had been a few months since they had defeated Chuck, but that 'lonely, something is missing' feeling had been with him every single day since.
Cas watched her, his brow furrowed. "It's because she's not evil, not any more. Jack's power, Chuck's power - they've mixed with the Darkness and made‚Ä¶ you. You're not killing us because you're not actually the darkness anymore. You're full of light too."
Cas held out the slightly less filled cup of coffee and Dean unfolded his arms to take it without a thanks, placing it unceremoniously on the table by the door.
Chuck laughed again, spitting out a worrying amount of blood. ‚ÄúYou think I haven‚Äôt tried to kill myself? You think I haven‚Äôt tried to
Dean's kiss, when he finally stopped teasing, brushing against and slowly tormenting Cas' lips, was Earth shattering. As his lips pressed more firmly, Dean's talented mouth coaxed Cas to kiss him back, to match his level of intensity, heat, passion. Sucking Cas' bottom lip, nipping at it, lathing it with his tongue to soothe it, only to gently nibble at it again - Dean was breathing hard, making tiny sounds at the back of his throat, pressing his very obvious arousal into Cas' hip.
"Being in love? It's terrifying! You're not in control, they can break your heart, you could lose them in a million different ways. You've been hurt so many times, right from losing mom, all the way to losing Cas. And I
Fifty minutes later Dean's throat was scratchy from the constant talking, and Cas still wasn't asleep. He'd clung to him, listened, laughed quietly, but he'd never seemed even a little close to drifting off.
Folding his coat and placing it on the floor next to his shoes, Cas climbed back on top of the covers, his arms folded grumpily.
This seemed to almost mollify Kate and she nodded. "Okay. It would mean a lot to me to meet your family, Cas."
Did he count as anything anymore? He didn't fit anywhere. Not in Heaven with his brothers, with Jack. Not here with Dean who quite obviously didn't want him there if his early morning escape was any indication.
‚ÄúI never wanted the life I was created for.‚Äù Not since the moment he had set eyes on Dean. Meeting Dean had made him want things for himself for the very first time.
"I was a mess before you even picked up the phone," Dean admitted, his mouth brushing against Cas' neck as he spoke. He let his tongue dart out, tasting Cas' skin for just a moment, but long enough to make the angel's breath catch in his throat.
"Alright, alright." He cleared his throat. "I'm sure you're looking particularly handsome tonight, Cas. I'm looking forward to our date."
Dean went to the fridge and grabbed a beer, offering Cas one too. Cas took it gratefully. Today wasn't a day for him to stay sober.
Cas‚Äô anger ebbed away, and in its place was more sadness than Dean thought could exist in one place. It was like he was mirroring Dean's emotions, and magnifying them times a thousand. The air seemed to be weighed down with it and just looking at Cas made him ache with sorrow. His wings seemed to droop, some of their brightness fading.
"A little, but you did just tell her that Angels and monsters are real. Maybe give her a bit of time to deal with that before getting out the thumb screws?"
Dean looked up from adjusting the strings on his guitar, softly strumming chords until they sounded perfect, and shrugged unashamedly at his brother.
"We met through Castiel," Kate said, the gentle teasing tone gone from her voice, replaced with oddly cold suspicion. "Why do you ask?"
"Don't look at me,‚Äù Dean shrugged. ‚ÄúThis is your show, buddy. I've done 'the talk' with plenty of people, but never someone who could potentially get me chucked in the loony bin‚Äînot to give you any ideas, Kate."
If two months of junk food and comfort eating had put weight on Dean, three months of mountain climbing, swimming and living on a diet made up of fish he'd caught himself and his few precious canned supplies had made his body hard and muscled in a way it hadn't been for a long time. His skin was tanned and his beard streaked with ginger. He'd accepted a video call from his brother a few days ago, and Sam had asked him how Wilson was doing. It had taken Dean an embarrassingly long few seconds to recognise the reference to Tom Hanks' volleyball shaped friend. He was sure his beard wasn't
He cleared his throat. Singing one-on-one felt curiously like tearing his soul from his own body and holding it out for Cas to see.
The events of today came into sharp focus, as Dean realised that he had allowed the fear of his father's judgement, his father's prejudices
He was wet, Dean could see it. Wet and still leaking with every upward stroke. Dean pressed his face into the crook of Cas' neck and groaned.
"To annoy one specific angel, yes. Although Gabriel really loved the cats in the end. When he banished them to Earth, he kept fourteen just for himself."
"The time I did have with Cas was cut short, because of you!" Dean growled. "We could have been a family! Cas and I could have finally given Jack a real home together!"
"You did all this, because of Dean?" Sam asked incredulously. "Because you have some insane crush on my brother?"
‚ÄúI got you a bee!‚Äù he announced before Cas could finish reading the words on the certificate. The delight was evident in Dean's voice as he bounced in place on the bed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got its name on there, and its job! It‚Äôs a honeybee!‚Äù
"You're really not keen on letting me finish my sentences today, are you?" Cas paused, sighing. "You're 'freaking out' aren't you?"
There was a silence, broken only by the rustle of the material of Dean's coat as he lifted his hands in a clear gesture of, '
"How is it that you and this big strapping lad here know each other?" Rowena asked, suddenly curious. "Save you from some monster somewhere, did he?"
Cas looked at him and Dean forced himself not to look away. He never used to look away - Hell, he would stare back twice as hard when Cas looked at him normally. He‚Äôd heard people talking about it, been ribbed about it, even had Charlie assume he and Cas were secretly fucking because of it. Now he could barely look at him, because every time he did all he could think about was that damn kiss.
And there it was, the real reason Cas regularly encouraged him to make friends, to go out. If he was doing that, he couldn't revert back to his old, dangerous hunting ways. Only Cas had no fucking idea how hard it was to resist the hunt now that his dad was back and Cas was half the world away. Cas wouldn't even know if he went on a hunt or two.
"I didn't want to talk about this, but I'm not having you think that I'm ashamed of you. Anyone would be lucky to be with you, Cas. It's not about that, alright?"
Seemingly oblivious to Cas shattering in front of him, Dean carried on. "You don't need to kill yourself explaining it to me. I've not lost any sleep over it."
"Candy Cain," Cas supplied for him with a nod. "What parent calls a child Candy when their last name is Cain?"
Yes, okay‚ÄîDean was hot when he danced. He was hot when he sang. He was hot when he just sat there and breathed. The man should come with some sort of warning label.
"Once a week Dean and Claire phone each other to make sure neither one has been injured or is missing. I'm surprised he hasn't said," Jody explained, giving Cas a hug on her way to greet Dean and Sam who had left the kitchen especially to say hello.
‚ÄúActually, no. Gabriel is my brother, and he‚Äôs really not as great and glorious as you would think. He‚Äôs mostly just into porn, cats, and more recently, politics.‚Äù
Touching was also fine, right? Touching wasn't sex. Touching was sometimes wholly platonic, friendly even. Right now he felt like
Well, as the only type he had ever had was sitting across from him now, achingly sexy in one of what must be an endless supply of flannel shirts, Cas severely doubted it.
Cas dropped something small in the bin, slamming the plastic lid shut loudly. Then he looked up, as if sensing Dean's amusement.
"I've always been more of a doer than a talker." Dean shifted awkwardly in his seat. If he kissed Cas now, it would have the added bonus of shutting him up.
An hour later, his cock half hard in his hand, he felt like he'd scrolled through all the porn that the Internet held. Nothing had jumped out at him and piqued his interest, and he'd looked at some pretty kinky things. The level of taboo alone should have got him close but he was left decidedly disinterested. Maybe he'd finally done it? Maybe he'd finally finished all the porn? Was there some sort of award? A certificate maybe? A gold-plated tissue box?
He hated himself, hated how much he had wanted to kiss Dean, hated that he had so little control. Dean didn‚Äôt deserve this, had done nothing to encourage it - what was wrong with him? What was he even thinking?
Dean had rather ravenously started eating the rest of his dessert platter. It felt like he hadn‚Äôt eaten in days rather than minutes, and he wondered if it was a side effect of whatever mojo Cas had used. Even if it was, it was a side effect that he was absolutely fine with.
Dean blinked, dazedly following Cas up the stairs. There had been Bobby, looking really good‚Äîhappy. There had been Ellen's bar but not in the right place. And no Cas. Where was Cas?
Dean walked across the room to the drawer that he knew Cas kept an emergency stash of cash in. Pulling a few bills from the pile, he handed them to Kate.
"Yeah," smiled Sam, remembering his son with a pang of sadness. How long would it be until he saw his face again? Eileen‚Äôs face?
"So do you want to tell me what happened, or should we just get drunk and egg Dean Winchester's car?"
"You've no idea how much I'd love that, but you still need to talk to your parents and putting it off is only going to draw this out. Your mom caught me outside the gents and hugged me‚Äîat least find a way to talk to her?"
There was a nod against his shoulder and then a shiver, as the cold air seemed to have broken through the haze. Dean smiled, pulling Cas to him until their chests were pressed together.
He was going to shower, chase the estate agent about his lake house again, and then he was going to gather supplies. Fixing the place up was exactly the sort of distraction he needed, and taking advantage of having two bored Angels with superstrength at his beck and call couldn't hurt. He just hoped the estate agent or owners wouldn't think to visit the place before she sold it to him. He'd have a hard time explaining that one. All assuming they still wanted to sell.
"Well, this was great," Dean said, getting to his feet and coming around the back of the couch to reach for Cas. He gladly took Dean's hand again, despite the fact that they'd been holding hands for the best part of an hour already.
"You do know how ridiculous you sound?" Cas asked, exasperated but not sounding angry, which Dean figured was a positive.
The touch against his hand was so light that Dean didn't notice it at first. Cas' hand was sliding slowly, tentatively into his, linking their fingers before Dean realised what he was doing.
Dean finally stopped, turning to Cas and making a, "what now?" gesture with his split and raw hands. What they had thought would happen hadn't. There had been no appearance of a White Knight to save Chuck and now there was just a bleeding one-time God lying almost senseless on the Bunker's floor.
"I think it might be best that you don't try to stand up - the oil has turned the shower into a death-trap."
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that a good thing?‚Äù Sam asked. ‚ÄúOnce it‚Äôs gone, you‚Äôll not be in limbo anymore. Right now you‚Äôre not quite one or the other; neither human nor Angel. It can‚Äôt be easy.‚Äù
"Cas, you can't just go around slaughtering people for being arseholes!" Kate hissed. "If I did that, Earth would be left with like six people on it!"
Kate pressed the back of one of her hands to her cheek to cool it, still hanging on to Cas' shirt with the other.
‚ÄúDean,‚Äù Cas whispered, his voice cracking on his name. He held him tighter, wanting to somehow envelop him completely, hide him away from the world.
creepy, it is to see you in this barely lit bedroom. I mean it's tame when compared to some of the things Gabriel has dragged me into lately, but I truly didn't expect it of you. You don't normally like to share, Cassie."
Laying there against the fluffy white pillows, Dean watched Cas watching him, a small, sexy smirk on his face. He was wearing a short sleeved t-shirt that did nothing to hide biceps that Cas had actually seriously considered biting on several occasions. He was obviously still hard - even the blankets he‚Äôd pulled half over himself were doing nothing to hide that, and now Cas was supposed to get into bed with him and somehow not lose the control that was currently stretched so tightly that Cas was worried it would snap completely.
" Dean's own hips jerked against nothing and he could have cried at the lack of friction. This wasn't about him but he was aching with need. And God, he wanted to touch Cas properly. He
Dean grinned and bent his head to kiss Cas' neck, to run his tongue along the edge of his ear, to whisper hotly in his ear.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought at the start,‚Äù Dean said, and even without looking up Cas could feel Dean's eyes on him. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve had plenty of time on my own to think, and I‚Äôve realised that it isn‚Äôt that at all.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs turned into fucking groom-zilla!‚Äù Dean whined. ‚ÄúHe calls me fifty times a day, with all sorts of ridiculous shit.‚Äù
With an impatient sigh, he wound down the window and stuck his hands out, pouring whisky liberally over each in turn before reaching into the back for the discarded old t-shirt that he sometimes used as a rag to wipe the windscreen. Drying his hands, and heedless of all the bacteria he'd probably just rubbed into his cuts, he threw Cas a look that said, "Happy now?" - like Cas' utterly unreasonable demands had now been met.
"Everything okay?" she asked, eyeing Dean's still half full plate. "I can do you a doggy bag if you want to save the rest for later?"
"Admittedly I'm a bit drunk, but you did say that. And ever since you said that, you've been flirting almost constantly. I swear that when you look at me sometimes, it's like you want to do it again."
"No. Fuck, no. You're not - I don't want to find a 'nice woman' either." Dean felt like this had all gone completely out of his control and he wasn't sure how. "Everyone I love ends up dead, Cas! So I can't love anyone!"
Night times were the worst. He could still smell Cas' fading scent on his pillows, on his sheets and he refused to change them. He felt like a lovestruck teenager, except of course, he wasn't lovestruck. He was missing his best friend and he was a horny S.O.B. That much he could admit.
"Oh Dean, I'm sorry. I should have fought harder. It was my responsibility and I knew it was a terrible idea."
"For money, Cas. I did things for money. To pay the motel bills, to feed Sammy. I-" Dean's voice cracked, his throat closing as a wave of emotion poured through him until it was visible on his face.
‚ÄúKate can recommend someone for you to talk to if you ever do feel like it would help?" Cas was saying gently. "She‚Äôs got contacts, and she can tell you who‚Äôs likely to be good, who you can trust. You could ask to see her, but she's a child psychologist and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the sort of thing that would translate.‚Äù
Cas let out a panicked puff of air. He pulled his hands from his pockets and placed them on Dean's shoulders instead. He had been so sure that he was going to try to push Dean away from him again. He was strong - not Angel strong now, but he could give Dean a run for his money if he tried. Instead, his treacherous, disobedient body just held tightly onto Dean instead, steadying himself, clinging to him.
Cas sighed, narrowing his eyes in annoyance. "I could chain you to me so you can't go anywhere, but I don't think that's very healthy for either of us."
"Look man, you know I want you. I mean, I haven't made out like this since I was a frickin' teenager. But I just made this speech about how I was using you for sex, and now I need to fix what my stupid mouth did and
He needed Dean to stop talking. He could storm out and go back to his apartment, but Dean didn't deserve that. He'd done nothing wrong. But if Cas stayed, Dean would keep digging, prying,
The applause from the guests, led by Sam and Eileen was warm and heartfelt. Claire was whistling and cheering loudest of them all, and suddenly he felt like he could do anything, stand up to anyone. He scanned the room and spotted his father standing with an unreadable expression on his face, staring towards Cas as the angel picked his way through guests to head towards the restrooms, stopping to talk to Sam and Eileen, before carrying on.
. I‚Äôm prepared to risk my heart. And I would say that this is the last time, I would say that if you hurt me again then this is over, but we both know it‚Äôs a lie. I‚Äôm yours, Dean and I will always be yours, in whatever capacity and for however long you want me.‚Äù
Cas had the audacity to laugh, kissing him once on the forehead, before tipping his entire body to the side, with Dean on top of him. He maneuvered Dean onto the bed beside him with ease that made Dean let out a huff of annoyance. He‚Äôd seen Friends, and Cas had essentially just very diplomatically used the Hug and Roll on him.
"I have definitely not been sufficiently wooed for whatever it is you're thinking of," Cas chided. "There's a set menu tonight‚Äî"
There was a murmur of agreement from the hunters in the crowd, a few of them lifting their glasses to their lost loved ones. Dean nodded respectfully to them and raised his bottle.
"Alright, Amara. I know you're playing Big Brother, watching my every fucking move. We need to talk."
"Really?" Cas asked again, the disbelief even more evident now. Dean just knew Cas' eyebrow was raised, his pretty pink lips pouting, those beautiful blue eyes narrowed in suspicion.
It was late‚Äîclose to 3am, but the snow reflected the streetlights so well that the landscape around them was brightly lit with a warm yellowish glow. Everything around them was bright but off-colour, like looking at an old discoloured photograph. If Cas hadn't been so cold, and if Dean wasn't upset over something, it would have been a lovely night.
Cas looked around the room for anything at all to distract him from the absolute idiot he'd been stupid enough to fall in love with. Punching him wouldn't help either of them, but occasionally it was so tempting.
‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt look like there was much chance of that happening,‚Äù Cas said, trying not to sound as jealous as he so obviously was.
The flickering orange glow of the street light shone through the bay window, illuminating Cas' body with an unnatural fluorescent light. The window pane was frosted with a thin layer of ice, but as Dean looked down at the man sprawled naked on the bed before him, he felt warm‚Äîhot even. It was almost as if there was an energy between them, radiating out to fill the sparsely furnished bedroom and generating a heat all its own.
"We gathered as much," Balthazar nodded. "But it's good to know for sure when trying to convince our brothers and sisters to get off their arses and join the fight."
"Are you two really just casually discussing killing a man who hasn't even lifted a finger to try to defend himself? None of this is okay, even if this
"Is this okay?" Dean asked softly. Dean's gaze didn't leave Cas' face, watching as Cas gave a jerky nod of consent, resting his hands on Dean‚Äôs shoulders and forcing himself to think about anything other than Dean‚Äôs hands undressing him. Anything else. Anything at all. He had to stay in control.
"I'm such a fucking awful influence on you," Dean pointed out wryly, smiling an actual genuine smile for the first time all night.
"Being in your arms is what comes naturally," Cas choked out, before he'd realised his mouth had even formed the words. When he realised, his eyes flew open and his relaxed movements ceased entirely as all three of them came to an abrupt stop.
"Are you going to be one of these people who thinks they're in charge, even when they're naked, bound and gagged?" Dean asked breathlessly.
The room was filled almost wall-to-wall with furniture that seemed to be quite surplus to requirements, and only served to make it feel cramped and oddly stuffy. This, along with the presence of Sam, Dean, and Cas‚Äîwho were anything but small in stature‚Äîgave the impression that the cabin was even smaller than it actually was. At one end of the room, the ceiling sloped so low that Dean had to duck his head as he paced back and forth in the restricted space.
"You're amazing, Cas," Dean whispered hot in his ear. "I knew you could dance. Moving like this‚Äîit comes naturally."
Cas followed them all into the kitchen as they put the food on the side. He accepted a hug from Donna and returned Alex's smile, before taking another bottle of beer from Sam. He turned around in time to spot Patience staring at Dean like he had grown an extra head.
Hesitating for less than a second, Dean drew back his arm and punched the man squarely on the jaw, throwing him backwards. His head ricocheted off the back wall of the wardrobe, and he collapsed in a heap at Dean's feet.
Dean had tried to hide his own looks after that. He knew he was good looking, pretty almost, and he'd hated it for a long time.
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù As Sam spoke, the trees around him blurred and faded, until nothing was left but the wind, the rain and Jack, standing calmly in front of him.
"But he's barely sleeping, barely eating," Sam continued. "You want him to want to live again, yeah? You want him to be happy. Don't you think having his best friend back might help?"
Unless you had a parent like John Winchester it was impossible to understand the mix of feelings that came with it. The loyalty warring with guilt, the love warring with hate. Knowing that the things they did were so very wrong, but not being able to stop blaming yourself as well. Cas knew. Cas understood loving someone despite their mistakes better than most.
Dean hid his face in his hands again and Cas‚Äô fought back his own tears. He‚Äôd done this. He‚Äôd hurt the only person he‚Äôd ever loved.
The Bunker felt more welcoming when it was full of people. Not that Cas ever objected to the times when it was just him and Dean, but the feeling of family wasn't one that Cas would ever take for granted. He'd felt it when Jack was there, but now he only really got glimpses of it - never daring to cling onto them in case they were taken away again. Sam, Dean, Eileen - they were family, but one he knew he would have to leave one day when Dean got tired of whatever
It was the first time that he'd ever truly come close to doing anything like this. Leaning closer, feeling Dean's breath warm on his face as he did, it made him feel like the world was tilting on its axis. Everything was being thrown off kilter, his head felt light, butterflies danced in his stomach.
‚ÄúEileen‚Äôs is the one in the Scooby Doo mug,‚Äù he said, pushing them both into Sam‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúYou know how she needs her coffee to be hot enough to take skin off the roof of her mouth, so you should probably take it to her now.‚Äù
Dean's stomach actually swooped at the deep baritone of Cas' voice. He should be more than immune to it by now, but he was fairly sure the effect was getting worse rather than better. His stomach lurched at the sound of it in the same way it did when he took Baby over a hill in the road too fast, and it felt a little like his stomach had been left behind in the back seat. Like a roller-coaster, but longer lasting, more exhilarating, more addictive.
"I'm terrified that I'm gonna lose you." Dean's hand reached out for Cas as he spoke, then dropped uselessly by his side when he stopped himself. "I feel like I'll lose you either way - if we keep having sex, and if we stop."
The look in Dean's eyes suggested it was rather more than good citizenship, but Cas dropped his hands and allowed Dean to unbuckle his belt, watching Dean pull it free of his jeans and drop it on top of his sweater.
The donuts smelled amazing, and despite only having eaten an hour earlier, Cas' stomach rumbled loudly, making Kate laugh at him and open the box wide.
"I yield," Cas said, tipping his little metal ship over onto its side. "You'll beat us in a few turns, Sam."
Sam opened his mouth to speak, but Dean held his hand up to silence him. Staring at Cas like he'd just grown an extra head, he said, ‚ÄúTherapy? You‚Äôre getting your head shrunk?‚Äù
Cas choked‚Äîon what he wasn't sure. He wasn't eating or drinking anything, but suddenly his own saliva was trying to kill him. He bent over, hands on his knees, coughing and spluttering.
"You're not helping by being here. This is not your fight and I need you to be safe - go and find the others."
They'd stayed longer than the rescue teams had, friendship and duty pushing them to fight against the despondency, to keep searching even when they'd run out of new ideas. But even they had come up empty handed, not able to find a single trace of the magic that Cas had insisted was so powerful that it could cover the signature of an army of angelic insurgents. When witches wanted something to remain hidden, it seemed no one would be able to find it.
"Fuck, I want you," Dean murmured, looking out at the rest of the room passively, like they were just talking about the weather.
"It's all dad taught him to be. Any time Dean tried to have anything for himself, dad would make sure he felt so shit about it that he stopped even trying.‚Äù
Having Dean occupied so completely had shown Cas just how much he and Dean usually paired off in social situations like these. Without Dean by his side, Cas felt at a bit of a loss, his eyes constantly seeking him out, finding him and then feeling awful as Kate touched his arm, or flicked her ridiculously sleek and shiny dark hair over her shoulder in a way that Cas had only ever seen her do when she was flirting.
‚ÄúNot an answer, Cas.‚Äù Dean shoved up the t-shirt that Cas had only just put on, pushing it as far up as it would go, exposing as much of Cas‚Äô chest and stomach as he could. His head dipped low, his mouth ghosting over Cas‚Äô skin, gentle bites and licks following a line from his hip to his nipple. When he paused his exploration to lathe Cas‚Äô nipple with his tongue, Cas arched off the bed with a loud and desperate cry. Dean swore he could come from that reaction alone.
‚ÄúIt was a long-shot,‚Äù Cas shrugged. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not answered me once though, so that doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn't him.‚Äù
Cas followed meekly, allowing Dean to pull his chair out for him and place his spoon in his hand. He was coming down from his high, his movements sluggish.
Cas smiled. "Considering our lack of any sort of long term relationships, we've got a lot more children to care for than people would expect."
He wished he could just stop thinking, stop feeling, stop remembering and hurting. He burrowed deeper under his covers and wished he could make himself fall asleep, but the only time he'd done that had been when Dean had held him in his arms. The rest of the time, when he closed his eyes he felt overwhelmed with this fear that he'd never be able to open them and see the daylight again.
As Chuck echoed Eileen's words from earlier, Cas' eyes shot to Dean's face. Was it true? Had Dean loved him back then? If he still loved him, maybe there was a chance they could weather this storm too? All hope of that left Cas the moment he caught sight of Dean's face, distorted in anger.
Luckily, although adult conversation couldn‚Äôt sufficiently distract him, Cas had discovered that children absolutely refused to settle for just a portion of anyone‚Äôs attention. They demanded complete concentration and attentiveness, and as Gertie seemed to have taken a bit of a shine to him, he was sufficiently distracted for a good portion of the afternoon. Eventually, Cas had started telling Gertie stories about when all the Angels were together, living in Heaven. The little girl seemed particularly fond of hearing about the various pranks Gabriel had pulled, and over a ridiculous amount of years, there were a
Dean let out a breathless laugh, which turned into a groan when Cas‚Äô hand found the gap in his boxers and wrapped around his cock.
"Pleased to meet you Dean," she said, smiling at him, but the look of concern on her face was not fading. "I'll leave you two gentlemen to talk."
It wasn't that he couldn't admit to loving Dean - it actually felt quite freeing to say it out loud without being terrified the entire world would topple in on itself. But now it wasn't just his secret, it was Dean's too. His love was unrequited, yes. But some part of this whole thing
- you can see that his prejudice, his reactions are what is disgusting here can't you? Not your sexuality. His reaction was the shameful thing. He is the one who should be beaten black and fucking blue."
Cas' icy layer of self protection melted into a metaphorical puddle on the floor. People didn't buy him things. Part of the reason he adored Nigel so much was because it had been one of the rare times anyone had ever given him something just because they had thought he would like it. How was he meant to stay strong and unfeeling towards Dean when he was holding out a gift that showed that he'd been thinking of him? That he did care, even if it wasn't the way Cas craved it.
"I'm just‚Ä¶ Amara." She spoke quietly, sadly, and Dean almost believed she was hurting too. "I'm not the Goddess of anything."
"That's a lot of possessed animals now, Claire," Cas said, worry evident in his tone and in the anxious twisting of his hands. "There's definitely a link, and it does seem to be converging where you are. You need to be careful. Maybe Jody could go with you next time as backup?"
On the wall, half hidden by the bookcase, was a child's drawing. It stood out, clean and new against the dirt of the walls, as if it hadn't been there long enough to gather dust. A drawing of a little girl standing under a tree, a dog with one ear sitting next to her. Cas crossed to the shelf and picked up the broken dog ornament. Taped to its underside was a string with a weight on the end.
He missed Cas. It had been eight days since Dean had seen him. Eight days since he‚Äôd been able to accidentally on purpose brush their knees together under a table or even just shoot the breeze over a beer. He couldn't keep his mind focused on anything else without it wandering off to the way those beautiful, big eyes darkened like a storm was coming every single time Dean had even got close to kissing him. The way he'd let out these tiny moans when Dean had kissed his neck. The way his hips had pressed hard against Dean's, unconsciously seeking him out, trying to get closer.
"And really, we're only related to each other in much the same way as all the humans are related to each other, but because there were fewer of us, there's this closeness. It leaves the relationship very open to confusion. I mean, I call Balthazar my brother, but he'd definitely try to get into my pants if he could."
"Wasn‚Äôt needed?!" Dean banged his hands down onto the table so that the coffee cups jumped and spilled. ‚Äú
‚ÄúBedroom. Now.‚Äù Fuck dinner. They had a microwave. Besides, it would take them ages to sort out the kids and Cas was fairly sure that neither he or Dean were going to need very long to finish this.
Thank you all so much for your support ‚ù§Ô∏è You're all awesome and I'm sorry for torturing you with yet another cliffhanger (although not sorry enough not to do it).
A few minutes later Cas appeared next to them, looking dishevelled and painfully sexy in black jeans and a t-shirt, no Children's TV Presenter sweater in sight. Dean didn't know whether to rejoice or cry.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me,‚Äù Dean said with a little laugh, trying to brave out the fact that his entire foundation had been shaken by nothing more and nothing less than Cas‚Äô touch.
Dean had gone around the room asking guests if they‚Äôd seen him, checking the restroom, the garden, even the closed, dark siderooms of the Rock Garden with an increasing sense of unease.
"Cas wasn't quite himself at the time," Dean placated. "Much like he isn't right now. Maybe we should get you home, buddy?"
"Thanks, Cas. Will you send me that when you get home?" Dean reached out and squeezed his arm and Cas beamed back at him.
A stab of utterly unfounded jealousy knifed through Dean's chest. Unsure if he was spurred on by that, or just by how unbelievably fucking hot Cas was looking, Dean moved to stand closer to his friend.
"I've had more fun with Cas than I ever thought I would. We've taken classes together, watched half of the movies in existence, and he's fascinating to talk to and debate with. But I don't fancy him!"
They drove in silence. Cas was pretending to be asleep again with his head against the window, and no music was playing because the bitch who made herself Goddess of all Creation thought taking the one thing that brought him comfort in this world and fucking with it would somehow make him love her. Right now he didn't even have the energy to hate her.
"The Angels are disobedient children who are, for the most part, shut away where they can't interfere," she dismissed his plea. "I wasn't kidding around when I said we don't interfere on earth now. The Angels who break this get the exact same treatment you did. They get
"I can't afford to lose more family, okay?" she said, the anger in her voice not matching the words that came from her lips. "And whether you realise it or not, you
Claire gave him a shrewd look, but held her tongue. Sam had been glaring at him since he stepped into the room and Dean was reminded of how different Sam and Cas were when they were pissed at him. Cas withdrew to the point where he wouldn't even look at Dean, protecting himself from any hurt in the best way he knew how. Sam on the other hand would glare and sulk in such an overt, obvious way that it was impossible to miss.
not like opening the same old gift twice. "Only I don't think it really works like that with naked bodies. The thrill you get when opening a gift? That isn't a one time thing when you undress someone. You sorta get to relive that exciting, uncovering feeling every damn time."
"I'm going to be single forever!" Donna groaned, dropping into the chair opposite Dean, oblivious as to what she was interrupting, somehow missing the tension between them entirely. She took a long drink of something that looked like wine poured into a giant coffee cup, and then she dropped her head to the table just as Jody appeared behind her.
The silence on the other end of the line was telling. Cas didn't deny it, and Dean felt his stomach twist with want at the idea that Cas wanted him too.
What if, when all their friends and family gathered for Thanksgiving, Cas did something to give them away? What if he tried to hold his hand or outright kissed him? People already talked about how they looked at each other, and that was before they'd kissed, had phone sex, had become so attached to each other.
"The bar. It‚Äôs a joke, you‚Äôre lawyers." He looked for support from Sam, who just shook his head in despair.
And then Amara was gone too, vanished as if she had never been there at all. Dean dropped back down to the ground, his head in his hands, his body shaking. Thunder rolled in the sky as a storm formed overhead, the first fat drops of rain hitting the back of his neck as he sobbed brokenly into the dirt below.
"Do you think I was just pretending to care about you all these years?" Dean asked, running his fingers through his hair in frustration, making it stand up in all directions. "Do you think I'm made of stone, Cas?"
"I'm sorry for doubting you, Cas," he said seriously, glancing up as he sorted his pillows into the right positions. "If I ever do that again, you slap me down, okay?"
Dean ignored Cas' question. Something in him didn't want his hands free, but telling Cas that right now would just add to the shame he already felt coursing through him.
"No. It's good," Dean murmured, his words starting to slur as he couldn't fight off sleep as it finally started to overcome him. "You're perfect."
"Camomile," Dean said, gesturing towards the cup. "It's meant to be soothing, and I figured as the packet was still sealed you hadn't had any yet. Might be worth a try?"
Cas looked up warily, the dark circles under his eyes more pronounced than they ever had been before. He looked exhausted. "Yes?"
"It is," Cas agreed with a small shrug. "But I'm past the point of caring, Dean. And to be honest, who do we really think we were kidding? Demons and Angels alike think we're‚Ä¶"
They would be old men in their rocking chairs on the Lake House porch, and his heart would still beat harder every time Cas looked at him with that little smile, or that little look of need, or that exasperated glare‚Äîhell, Cas only had to look at him full stop to get his heart pounding. He was so in love that he'd turned into a sap and he didn't even care. He'd be walking on air every single day if the love of his life wasn't hundreds, maybe thousands of miles away from him, risking his life searching for celestial beings that didn't want to be found.
As they had left the bar and Cas took one last long look, Dean was bending over the pool table. The woman in the blue dress had both hands on his rear as he wiggled it in the air in an exaggerated fashion. Cas hadn‚Äôt come back for months after that visit, and luckily Jack had kept him too busy for him to have a chance to wallow.
Dean smiled as Cas racked up the table again, loudly declaring that he was going to 'whoop Kate's ass' this time, a phrase that had definitely come from Dean.
"Shit, Cas. The noises you make are like fucking porn all by themselves. You need to slow down." He placed his hand over Cas' heart and felt it race against his palm. "Slower‚Äîthat's it. Yes. Fucking perfect. Now use your fingers and slide them over the tip real slow."
He looked around the room before quickly turned into the hallway, hating the sudden paranoia he got that he wasn't alone.
He moved in just the way he liked it himself and hoped it would work for Cas too. A minute later he was swallowing Cas' moans, expertly taking Cas to the edge, then stopping to kiss him while he cooled back down, before starting all over again.
"But now I'm scared you're gonna leave," Dean took his eyes off the road to look at Cas, but Cas steadfastly stared straight forward, refusing to give away his thoughts.
"I can't lose you again. Every time I think you've died I lose a piece of me, and I'm not sure I‚Äôll ever get them back. There‚Äôs not much left of me, Cas."
He'd felt like a fool for thinking that Dean would be mourning him, thinking about him. Their friendship had always meant more to Cas than it had to Dean, of course it had, so why would Dean not be celebrating life now he was free, why would he be killing himself trying to break Cas out of the Empty, when he didn‚Äôt need him anymore? The fight was over.
Dean was entirely sure he'd never been this hard before, never been this turned on. It was like every cell of his body thrummed with pleasure as Cas' beautiful, perfect hands explored the shifting muscles of Dean's back. They slid into his hair, nails scraping across his neck and scalp.
"Tell me you're lying," he demanded. "Bring him to me now, or I'm going to stay here and make this place feel like Times fucking Square every day for the rest of my life. There will be no peace for any of you. I will bring people here again; dogs, witches, hunters. I will call for Amara and I will help her hunt down every last one of you. I will make it my life's mission to destroy you‚Ä¶ unless you give him back to me."
"I'm leaving most of them here," Sam told him, his tone still pissed off, like he begrudged having to speak to Dean at all. "But Eileen was thinking that if you don't object, we could start directing some hunters here, as a sort of base? It's safe, has masses of resources and it's probably going to be a bit lonely with just you and Cas rattling around in it."
He'd thought he was out of tears, but the rapidly soaking cotton underneath his cheek proved otherwise, and Cas let himself drown in the agony again. At least here no one could see or hear him. Maybe tomorrow it would hurt less?
"She's got a headache," James quipped, looking forlornly at his hand, as if it had broken his heart.
"And you didn't think that I might quite like to know that you were okay? You couldn't have taken the time to drop in, answer a prayer, even just once to tell me what happened?"
Dean ignored his brother and pressed the skip button again, even though the first chords of the next song hadn‚Äôt even begun.
He pushed Dean's legs apart, and his fingers coated in oil, Cas rubbed and pressed against Dean, teasing and sliding until finally one finger eased inside him. Dean pushed back with a whimper. Cas' other hand found Dean's cock again, moving his hand in time with the hand that was fucking him.
He had never known a dog take so long to relieve himself, ever. Dean had gone to some considerable effort in order to clear a patch of the deep snow especially for Miracle, and right now he was just pacing up and down in the slush. Every few seconds the dog would glance up at Dean with a couple of hopeful wags of his tail, checking to see if he‚Äôd been enduring this hell for long enough and could go inside.
Sam leaned back in his seat, shaking his head. No, he wasn‚Äôt. He‚Äôd missed his brother more than he could ever get across to Dean, and now he finally had him here again he wasn‚Äôt going to waste their time together arguing. He was opening his mouth to speak, to agree with Dean, change the subject, talk to his brother like he‚Äôd been waiting to do for the past forty-nine years, to ask about their dad, Bobby, Ellen, Jo, when a fork of lightning split the rapidly darkening sky directly in front of them.
"It's fine. I have friends and family, and more than I ever thought I would be able to have. I'm content."
"What would we do with chickens in the winter anyway?" Dean already knew the answer to this, but he wanted Cas to say the words out loud, so he could tell him what a damn pain in the ass he was and that it was never going to happen.
As Cas stomped past Dean with his brows knitted together in a frown, he deliberately knocked into him with his shoulder. A small, triumphant smirk appeared on his face as Dean, not expecting it, had been knocked off balance and flailed in an effort to keep himself upright.
Cas turned away from where Kate was now watching them like she was at a tennis match, her head swivelling back and forth. He advanced on Dean, expecting him to back away or protest, but he just watched Cas coming with eyes that burned into him.
"No!" Cas finally reached him. "You want to do this, that's fine. You can destroy every good memory we have of each other - go ahead! I'm here. I'm listening!"
"Why are you doing nice things?" Dean sniffed the air suspiciously, trying to decipher the smells he could detect coming from the kitchen.
That hadn't been what Dean had meant, but seeing him with Kate was better than not seeing him at all. Maybe he could direct her towards Danny, the band's lead guitarist. Women couldn't resist Danny, and then Kate would be busy and Cas would be all his for the night.
They broke apart minutes later, both breathless, both clinging on to each other, anchoring themselves with handfuls of clothes, as if afraid that the other might slip away if they didn't. Dean revelled in the way Cas seemed to unconsciously drag his hips against him, so obviously hard from just their kiss. Cas leaned his forehead against Dean's and made him shiver as his fingers explored the sensitive skin of his lower back.
Sam had visited, bringing with him a large leafy plant in a massive green pot, which he'd tasked Cas with keeping alive. It had seemed to Cas like a fairly awful present -
‚ÄúWhy do you fucking think?‚Äù Cas snarled, anger and hurt radiating from him as he advanced on Dean, pressing him into the door. "Because I couldn't stand the thought of you dying before you got a chance to live! Because I care about you, Dean! If I was lost, would you have left me for dead? Oh wait, silly question -
"It's fine. He's obviously delusional - he thinks we're this epic love story, destined to defy adversity and live happily ever after," Cas said dismissively. "But if you were worried about his approval, he couldn't have been more obvious about it if he'd arranged a small platter of condoms and lube on your bedside table for us."
Cas sighed. "I'm not hitting you, Dean. I'm not annoyed with you‚ÄîI'm annoyed with myself, and I'm really tired."
‚ÄúI adore my new bed. I would stay in this bed forever if I didn‚Äôt keep needing to get up to eat, drink and urinate."
"And what's with all the sexual tension here? You were bad enough before, but now you two look like you'll combust if you touch each other. Cross the wires, see what happens. You might like it." Balthazar winked at Dean suggestively.
Not seeing Cas at least meant that at no point would he be able to give into temptation, throw himself at his feet and beg him for forgiveness, which Dean had to admit was a distinct possibility. The constant distraction was working, although Sam had put off moving out until after Christmas, claiming it was too stressful. Dean knew without Sam saying anything that it was entirely because he felt Dean might implode at any moment and he didn't trust him living alone at the Bunker. And living at the Bunker was what Dean would be doing for a long while yet, because even with all the work he was doing to make the lake house habitable, Dean was damned if he was going to share a home full time with Gabriel, Balthazar and various other Angels who flitted in and out as they were recruited. They would end up coming to blows. He and Amara agreed on one thing - Angels in general had been given too much power, and too little conscience. There were notable exceptions, but Dean was trying not to think about those in his attempt to stay sane.
‚ÄúHello? Yeah, from just outside the Safe Harbor restaurant, to‚Ä¶‚Äù he frowned. ‚ÄúKate, where is it that you live?‚Äù
"So good, Dean," Cas muttered breathlessly, gazing at Dean in almost religious reverence. "You're utter perfection."
"Dean, have you heard yourself when you pray?‚Äù Cas' fingers had slid under the hem of his t-shirt and were caressing the skin of his back, exploring slowly. ‚ÄúYour prayers are the most irreverent, the most-"
"You don't get a choice in this," Cas said harshly, closing the cuts too. Then, still straddling Dean's waist, Cas looked at him expectantly.
"We should do this sort of thing more often," Dean said. "Especially when it's warmer and the lake house is free‚Äîwe could have barbecues. There's loads of space for the kids to let off some steam and for Miracle to run about. In the summer we could swim in the lake, or do some fishing."
"When's the last time you hooked up with a woman?" Kate asked Dean casually, neat white teeth biting into the soft, sugary dough. Kate was capable of putting away more junk food than anyone Cas had ever met, except for Dean. A lot of the women Cas had met seemed to pick at their food, graze more than eat, but Kate relished every single morsel of food that was put in front of her.
‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm hunting or drinking, I‚Äôm not thinking. But the rest of the time, I just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt stand it. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore, Cas.‚Äù
Out of the corner of his eye, Cas could see Jodie and Alex helping Bess to unstrap the twins from their chairs, gathering up Gertie and moving towards the door.
Cas whimpered softly at the endearment and Dean slid his arm around him and pressed a soft kiss into his neck, then reluctantly he got back to his feet.
what Cas was doing and it was like an intricate form of torture‚Äîhe could feel the ridge of Dean's cock hard against his ass, pressing into him with every tiny movement. Cas was hard too, and the chances were that Kate already knew‚Äîwith the way she was dancing so closely, how could she have missed it? This was far too public a place for Dean to be doing this, and there was no way he couldn't know. There was
Dean just looked at him expectantly, waiting. When Cas didn't seem to get it he sighed and tried again.
Dean rested his head on the steering wheel. It was too late to reach out, to touch Cas, to comfort him.
"Still tasting molecules?" Dean asked him, sympathetically. He could understand the pain it would cause not to be able to enjoy food anymore.
"To be fair, you did get on well with Crowley at times. Just not in quite the way he wanted you to get on."
Their mouths were so close. Dean's hands were moving restlessly over his cheeks, across his jaw, threading through the short hairs at the back of his head. It was heady and addictive and Cas was so close to just leaning forward and closing the gap between them. But did Dean want to? Did he want to for himself?
‚ÄúI could do that every day for a year and it would barely make a dent,‚Äù Cas said, easily. ‚ÄúMaybe a week-long session with another angel‚Ä¶‚Äù
Cas nodded, wishing he'd brought his own car so he didn't have to get back into that small, intimate space with Dean again.
Seeing Cas' face, reading his doubt, Dean pulled him in for a hug, not seeming to care who was around to see them. Friends hugged all the time, didn't they? It was okay.
"That doesn't mean we can't go on a date. Look, tomorrow, assuming I'm back at the motel as normal, we'll meet at 7 your time."
"I know, and I think I'm gonna need something stronger than this damn coffee in me to make you understand."
to feel at this age. Didn‚Äôt all humans above a certain age make groaning noises as they got out of chairs? At his age, he‚Äôd figured that maybe he was meant to feel a little bit like he‚Äôd been hit by a speeding car. But sleep had done wonders for at least 95% of those aches, and he really owed it all to Dean. If only Cas' ridiculously one-track mind would let him think of some that didn't involve his tongue.
"We can't explain here," Dean said, looking at his bloodied, split open knuckles and then shaking them, as if giving them a good shake would magically fix them.
"I have neither the time nor the energy for this, Balthazar," Cas growled grumpily. "Now we can talk freely, maybe we can finally discuss what's been happening in Heaven?"
"You're my family too," Cas said, his face starting to crumple in a way that pulled at Dean's heartstrings so much he just wanted to pull him into his arms. "But so is Dean. Don't make me choose."
Cas chuckled. "Good for him, getting his head straight. Having your parents back has been really hard on him."
Dean didn't know what to say. Of course he felt that way, he'd always felt that way. Anyone foolish enough to care about him got hurt, either by him or because of him. He was a fuck-up, he knew that. He was good at hunting, not navigating this sort of shit. It was messy, confusing and it wasn't meant to be
he wanted right then. But this wasn't for him. None of this was for him and he couldn't just take what he wanted.
He'd been so tense. Cas had been so tense. They'd both needed this. And when Dean had righted himself, wiping tears from his eyes, Cas's hand was still on his shoulder. Cas seemed to realise at the same time Dean did, and he squeezed once before letting go, and they smiled into each other's eyes for far longer than they should have.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Dean nodded, feeling almost shy about it now. This was ridiculous - he was a grown man. He got out of bed, conscious of what he was concerned might become a permanent boner if Cas kept pulling this sort of shit. He went to the little sink in the corner of his room to brush his teeth.
He slipped under the covers and the stark contrast between the cold air of the room and the incredible, comforting warmth that immediately enveloped his entire body actually made him groan out loud. The covers were beyond soft and he sank into the mattress, which was covered in something that had pretty much turned the entire thing into a damned cloud. The pillows were bouncy and perfect, and
. There's no way to predict when they would come, no link between what food he ate, or what he watched before bed - they just haunted him whatever he did.
"You're incredible, Cas," Dean whispered brokenly. "Tell me what you taste like? Do you like tasting yourself?"
"The way I ended up going‚Ä¶ it became rather treacherous. Possibly on purpose, which leads me to believe I was getting close."
Cas wasn't sure quite what would have happened if Kate hadn't interrupted them. He genuinely didn't know if he'd have just torn Dean's clothes from his body and fucked him there and then, right in front of her. There was only so much temptation he could take, and he was a roiling mess of emotions and need that only Dean's touch could quell.
"Everything go okay?" Jody asked, meeting his eyes across the table. "Sam told us what he could, and you know we'll be there if there's anything at all we can do."
Sam had told him that Dean had withdrawn into himself after Cas left. His friends had been neglected to the point where people just stopped calling. But today, the love that filled this room
"And Mom is alright on her own, but around dad she's so damned Stepford Wife that it's painful to see. She's this badass hunter, what the fuck is she doing cooking his dinner while he sits at the table reading the damn paper?"
"‚Äîseveral live chickens, for luck!" Kate was chattering away, seemingly blind to Cas' standoffishness, to the way his arms were folded defensively over his chest.
"Dean, are you telling me that you'd kill off Velma or Daphne to either marry or have intercourse with a cartoon dog?"
‚ÄúIf you want to meet my family, it‚Äôs only fair I meet yours,‚Äù Cas insisted. "Why don't we arrange that?"
mind," Cas protested breathlessly, his fingers digging into Dean's ass, pulling him down against him over and over in a rhythm that Dean knew would take him over the edge if he wasn't careful.
"I don't know, some people get off on that," Dean quipped, not expecting to be taken seriously or to get any kind of followup question.
At the start of the night Dean had promised to himself that he wouldn't ask, but now Cas was here, Dean didn't want him to leave. He didn't want him to leave at all, ever again, but as a short term solution this worked. He wasn't asking him for sex. If that happened, then fucking Hallelujah, but that wasn't why he wanted him here. Torturing himself had risen to a whole different level.
"But did you get it in writing?" Cas teased, more light hearted than Dean remembered ever having seen him.
In the end, it was Cas' shiny new status as a human being that stopped Dean from going through with pressing the little green 'call' button and inviting him on a road trip.
"Oh fuck off, Amara!" he snapped. "You don't want to help me, you don't care about anyone but yourself!"
Cas got to his feet, unsteady for a moment and then regaining his balance as he strode over to Kate.
"Sam and Eileen finding each other‚Äîmy brother finding someone so damn perfect, that was a freakin' miracle. I've never seen him so nervous to go out on a date, or spend quite so long on his hair. What's it called, Sammy? Deep Conditioning?"
Dean forced himself to loosen his death-grip on the sheets. He reached down and hooked his thumbs in Cas' waistband, sitting up so he could drag them down Cas' legs. Cas lifted his hips, then his knees, shoving his pyjama pants down impatiently, before even more impatiently pulling at Dean's.
"I don't want there to be any awkwardness between us," Cas finished lamely. "It's been a few months for you, but I've been away for much longer. It was all a long time ago."
"Hey!" a snowball came flying through the air, whizzing past Dean's ear as he ducked down low, his mouth now fascinatingly close to Cas'. "Get a room, you two! Some of us are sexually frustrated enough over here!"
"You're even sounding like a shrink now!" Dean growled. "You'll end up being taken away by the men in white coats, Cas. Or worse! Do you know what our government would do to you if they found out what you really are? And now there's some guy out there who knows all our shit!"
"Does anyone else know how fucking adorable and romantic you are?" Dean's heart was beating fast from Cas' words alone.
They'd had sex this morning‚Äîslow, languid, taking time to cherish each other. This wasn't going to be anything like that, and Cas hardened at the thrill of it‚Äîthe risk of being caught, the fact that he'd known that Dean had wanted him all night. All night he'd felt nothing but Dean's gaze, heat radiating from him across the room.
Cas' hand slid into Dean's hair, nails scraping against his scalp. Then his fingers tightened suddenly and Dean sucked in a sharp breath, his eyes flying open.
Cas turned to look at the pathetic man on the floor. He deserved so much misery for what he'd done, but did he really deserve to be used like this? What else could they do now?
, but quite frankly, Cas in his lap was so goddamn distracting that he was struggling to hold onto any thought. Whether he knew what he was doing, Dean wasn't exactly sure, but Cas just kept fucking wiggling.
"I overstepped," Cas admitted, looking down. "I'm sorry for that. I tried to put it right by leaving, but I feel like nothing I do is right."
Cas wasn't stupid - he knew that what he and Dean had couldn't last. Dean had said himself that when it became too serious he would push Cas away. If Cas had to guess, all this had crept up quite suddenly on Dean. It had gone from an impossible idea burning in the background to a real possibility almost overnight, and Dean was riding a wave, completely out of control with no idea where he would land, or whether they would still be intact when they did. No, Dean didn't know what he wanted and Cas making himself more dependent on Dean wasn't a good idea at all.
His fingers moving quickly over the keys, he pressed send before he could over think it and stop himself.
"I mean it, Cas. Next time I get that bad, I'll call you. You can come and babysit me or whatever. Bring pizza and porn, I'll never make it out of the door."
"Sammy‚Ä¶" Dean murmured, choked and feeling panic rising in his chest. He was grateful and touched. So fucking touched. But he was being laid bare, and while it was great that Sam felt like this‚Ä¶ maybe a beer basket might have made the same point?
"I won't," Dean promised. Anything to feel Cas inside him. He would have given him literally anything he demanded.
When they broke apart again Dean could feel wetness on his cheeks‚Äîhis own tears, not Cas‚Äô. He didn‚Äôt know why being loved by Cas had ever scared him, ever confused him. It was
‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent weeks thinking about it since you came back,‚Äù Dean said, walking over to the leather sofa. He sat down next to Cas, close enough for their knees to brush. ‚ÄúDo you know what I think?‚Äù
"Yeah, I see where I might be your best bet, but I'm good with this kidnapping you thing. I had a date with Netflix and a microwave meal for one tonight."
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean. He'd been pretty drunk back at the bunker‚Äîin truth maybe they both had been. Dean had certainly been a lot less guarded than he would usually be. But a brisk walk in the freezing cold outside air had sobered them both up pretty effectively. Effectively enough, apparently, to mean Cas was back to rolling his eyes at him as if he were the biggest idiot in the world. In an affectionate manner, Dean hoped.
By the time Dean threw open the door to his room, Cas was gone, his shoes and coat still sitting neatly by Dean's bedside table.
Cas pushed the door open. "I'm a phone call away if you're struggling. I still want to be there for you, if you'll let me?"
"You don't have to hang up." His voice was calm, without a hint of hesitancy. As angry with himself as Dean was, he couldn't quite bring himself to hurt Cas by snapping at or hanging up on him just so he could escape his own embarrassment.
As if summoned by his name, Jack was standing in front of them, looking no different from the day he left them standing on the street, the day he‚Äôd defeated Chuck.
"What I said to you before the Empty took me‚Ä¶" Cas started, the churning in his stomach increasing tenfold at the mere mention of it.
family." Amara sounded less conciliatory now‚Äînot murderous and angry like he wanted her, but definitely closer to it. If Amara took him out, would his soul cease to exist? Would this pain finally be over and done with? He didn't want eternity anymore. Eternity without Cas would be hell, wherever he lived it out.
"This is a respectable establishment!" Cas tutted. "And we've got a lovely table, right at the back, candle-lit and private."
"No‚ÄîI was reading an article called 30 Ways to Pull Off the Perfect Date," Cas informed him in complete seriousness. "Step one was to keep you waiting and not to seem too keen. I don't want you to think I'm a sure thing or you'll stop making any effort."
They headed towards the bedroom, Dean determinedly not eyeing Cas' perfect, taut back muscles, which quite frankly were a goddamn work of art.
‚ÄúExcellent idea,‚Äù Dean said, throwing some money on the table and getting to his feet. He turned to Kate, eyeing Cas' hand on her shoulder before lifting his gaze to meet hers.
Dean's eyes shot open, his heart stuttering in his chest. He started to shake his head in denial, to tell Cas not to say it, that he couldn't feel that way, not now that he knew everything.
"There's no need," Cas said. "I'll just be topless instead - I go to bed naked when I'm on my own, so it's not like it will bother me."
Two banana and salted caramel waffles, two coffees and a dozen doughnuts to go later, the two men were back at the bunker, Cas steeled for Dean‚Äôs reaction.
"Dean!," he called behind him. "I rescued your potatoes after you left them to burn. Come eat, man! Give Cas room to breathe!"
Dean relaxed into his driving, the road stretching out in front of them, music playing on the radio, a light breeze blowing over his skin. The first notes of Angel with a Shotgun came to his ears on the radio and he closed his eyes for a moment before setting his jaw.
"Well I wouldn't have mentioned if it wasn't causing an issue with me being able to comfortably lie on my stomach for a massage." He sounded defensive and he'd turned on his side, his back towards Dean.
"You guys defeated daddy-o, and I figured you'd want to help again, as this time the Goddess Almighty has taken your blue eyed boy hostage. Not to mention the fact that Cas is our brother and he needs our help."
The hands on Dean‚Äôs shoulders were more gentle now, Cas‚Äô thumbs caressing his skin through the material, his eyes beseeching. Dean knew Sam was watching, that he was hurting, had questions of his own, but he couldn‚Äôt look away from Cas. This Cas was his Cas, this Cas cared. This was the Cas who had said he‚Äôd loved him with a look of rapture on his face, like just allowing the words to fall from his lips was the most incredible thing he‚Äôd ever experienced.
When the door immediately opened, Cas took an alarmed step back, spilling hot coffee on his shoe as he did. Dean's large frame filled the doorway, arms folded defensively over his chest and Cas immediately noticed the dark circles under his tired eyes. His hair stuck out at all angles and his clothes were crumpled, as if he'd spent all night tossing and turning in them.
"I am sorry, Kate," he said, steeling himself to pull away from Dean to go over to her, dragging himself away despite Dean's low growl and tightening grip on his hip. "I feel a bit like everything is off kilter today, but that's absolutely not your fault and we've been really rude."
"Having fun?" Dean asked, as Cas reached them and Dean guided him to the quiet area near the emergency exit where the music wasn't quite so ear piercingly loud.
"C'mon Sam! Do you really need me to spell it out to you? You know what I'm saying! I'm saying Chuck wasn't wrong! I'm saying that I can't fucking sleep without thinking about Cas every single time I close my eyes. I'm saying that when he's with me, it's like I come back to life, until the moment he's gone and I'm empty and cold again. I'm saying that he's‚Ä¶ he's
"Shh. You'll wake your boyfriend." Sam admonished reprovingly with a finger waggle, his face lit up in delight.
"You looked so peaceful, I thought I wouldn't disturb you." Cas tipped his head to the side so Dean could have better access to his neck. He threaded his fingers into Dean's hair and pulled lightly. "And I thought it would be a good idea to check on Sam."
The rising panic in Dean's chest had risen up to his throat and it was choking him. His hands clenched on the steering wheel and he fought for control. He should pull over, he wasn't safe driving like this. But if he did, Cas would know and Cas being Cas, he'd comfort him, when it wasn't Dean who should be being comforted. He didn't deserve that from him.
‚ÄúYour official documents‚Äîwhat you need to apply for jobs, have background checks‚Ä¶ to, you know, get married and shit like that,‚Äù Dean explained with a nervous edge that Cas didn't understand. ‚ÄúComplete with a background history that I‚Äôve been assured is absolutely water-tight. You can be a proper human now‚Äîyou‚Äôve got an identity.‚Äù
Cas immediately stepped back from Dean, lifting his hand to cover his face while he fought to get himself back under control.
"Dean, can I test something?" Cas said, letting go of Dean's wrist and giving up making him hold his hand under the icy water. "It might not be pleasant."
"Being human has its positive aspects," Cas told Dean, skirting over it. "There are lots of simple pleasures that I never really took time to experience last time I was human. Soft sheets against bare skin being one of them.‚Äù
"Are Angels supposed to be this filthy-minded?" His hand closed over Cas' shoulder and he squeezed, his expression happy, soft, and affectionate.
Dean's eyes shot to Cas', instantly sober. He nodded reassuringly at Cas, patting the gun in his pocket.
"Sammy, I'm gonna need you to trust me," he said apologetically. "I can't explain, but if things kick off, I do need you to make sure the little ones are out of here and don't see anything too bloody, and that no one gets in the middle of anything."
"Actually, Sam, I want to talk to you about something. I was doing some digging, and I found somewhere that I want to live. It's been for sale for a while now, so there shouldn't be any issue getting it. I've left a message and I'm waiting for a call back from the agent when it's not a holiday, but there's not much that would change my mind about wanting the place."
When minutes later Eileen leapt behind him to use him as a human/angel shield, Cas used the opportunity to speak to her, pulling her backwards and dropping them both down behind a snow-covered bench for cover. His fingers were numb and stiff, so after a few moments he gave up, settling for silently speaking to her, moving back enough to allow her to lip-read.
He appeared next to Cas, a large, steaming cup of coffee in his hand, and an adorably hopeful look on his face.
"Thanks." The towel disappeared for a moment, then was shoved back out of the gap again, a glimpse of Cas' long, thick thigh and the curve of his perfectly rounded ass visible through the gap.
As his chest cleared and concern for his immediate life was no longer at the forefront of his mind, awareness of exactly where Cas' hands were surged to the front. Cas was bending over him, rubbing and patting his back with one hand while tightly gripping his shoulder with the other.
The moment Cas was inside his apartment and the door was closed, his facade fell and he sank down to the floor where he stood, his back against the painted orange door. He pulled his knees up to his chest and stayed that way, sitting in the dark, listening to the sound of his clock on the mantelpiece ticking away the seconds. He sat there for hours.
"If you saw it, you'd understand. It's the sorta place that we would have loved to have grown up in. It just feels right. Calm. Peaceful." Or it would be when it didn't have two Angels hiding out there.
"It's an even better view from here," Dean said, patting the dusty old coverlet next to him, and shuffling to the side.
felt this, Dean. It's changed a lot over the years, but this part‚Ä¶ this I've felt since the moment my fingers first touched your soul."
"This looks lovely," Cas said appreciatively, looking at Dean with a question in his eyes. But he didn't ask what was on his mind, and as he sat down at one side of the little table, Dean left him to go and quickly finish off the cooking.
‚ÄúYeah, right. I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre screwing with me like this,‚Äù Kate said, taking a long drink from her second glass of wine. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs he?‚Äù she gestured towards Dean. ‚ÄúThe great and glorious archangel Gabriel?‚Äù
Porno Cas was groping Other Guy, while Girl Next Door was straddling a chair and finding the entire situation far more erotic than was warranted, going by her exaggerated, enthusiastic moans - when Dean's phone rang. Dean muted the porn and sat up.
By his sixth week there, he almost felt relaxed around her. She was this kind, friendly, gentle woman, who knew none of his complications. She had no idea that he'd tried his hand at being God and had spectacularly failed. She didn't know that he had allowed that odious boil on the ass of Angel-kind, Metatron, to steal his Grace. She didn't know he had allowed Leviathans to take over his body, and the less said about him working with Crowley the better. Most importantly, she didn't know that he'd confessed his love to the only person he'd ever loved romantically, only to be shunned completely and deemed utterly unworthy.
