The beer was just finished by the time Cas came back. He started talking as soon as he heard the familiar swoop of wings.
Cas’s lips moved absently to the song that was playing, and Dean’s heart skipped. He knew the song because of Dean. Dean had forced him into a Pirates of the Caribbean marathon, and hadn’t been sure what Cas thought of it. He must’ve liked it if he remembered the song. His face erupted into a grin as he watched Cas and joined in, singing above the music.
The mild California weather made their time in the line easy, and Dean was happy just to talk to Cas. They rehashed their latest hunt and discussed where they might go in the future. On a whim, Dean took out his phone and snapped a picture of Cas. He stared at the result for a moment, thrilled to have a piece of the day forever. But he snapped back to attention when the line moved forward and he realized he had the real thing next to him, and didn’t need a picture.
“I’m gonna go to Disneyland!” Dean said, taking a long drink from his own bottle. His eyes fell on Cas as he said it, who was already staring intently at him in that way of his. At the last word, Cas’s eyebrows furrowed and his head tilted to the side.
“Whatever, man,” Dean said, ignoring curious and alarmed glances from passersby as he pulled out his gun and a knife and handed them to Cas. “Take care of these for me.” The sight of Cas tucking the weapons into his trenchcoat while wearing the Mickey ears again was too much. Dean gripped his shoulder in what he hoped was a casual gesture, chuckling. “Catch you in there.”
“I’ve actually already been to Disneyland. Back when I was at Stanford,” Sam had said from his computer when Dean came into the room and jumped unceremoniously onto the bed.
“Well then you can be our tour guide, Sammy. I know you like to show off your knowledge of everything.” Sam rolled his eyes in response but didn’t bother to retort. Instead, he turned towards Dean and smiled conspiratorially.
They found a white painted outdoor table at a little diner and settled there, facing the castle. Their chairs were right next to each other, close enough that two of the chairs’ legs were intermingled.
“You should’ve let me carry you, Dean,” Cas said, raising his eyebrow.
No matter how your heart is grieving,
“Besides, I think you and Cas could use a little vacation time alone. See what happens.”
Your rainbow will come smiling through.
“Right.”
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate’s life for me!
Cas slightly narrowed his eyes, but let his hand fall to his side.
“Sorry, pal,” he choked. He didn’t know whether it was the laugh or the word “pal” that made his throat ache. He turned away and scooted down the bench an inch or two further from Cas.
When Dean had told Sam the night before that they were planning to go to Disneyland, he’d expected a totally different reaction. Actually, he hadn’t even expected a particular reaction. He was just surprised by the way Sam had responded, and he wasn’t sure he liked what Sam said.
The next morning, Dean and Cas had the Impala packed for California. Sam stood outside the car as they got in, waiting to wave them off.
The metal detector at the park’s front gates beeped, shrieking its protest as soon as Dean stepped through.
Stand up me hearties, yo ho
“Dean,” Cas whispered, a serious expression on his face that Dean couldn’t read.
Dean took a long pull from his beer, absentmindedly running his tongue along the bottle’s lip.
Now Dean was avoiding Sam’s eyes as he lifted his hand in a weak wave and put the car in drive. He turned the radio up loud and shook off his thoughts, shooting Cas an easy smile as they drove away. His heart thumped when Cas smiled back.
As soon as Dean opened the door of their room, a new tension settled in his shoulders. He’d be staying here alone. With Cas. At night. He barreled into the room, tossing his bag onto the bed and backing away from it while Cas followed his example.
“No!” Dean said as soon as Cas’s hand moved up to take them off. “Don’t. Keep ‘em on. It’s a good look for you.”
“Why would you want to go to Disneyland?” Cas asked, stepping out the way as Sam walked past him and out of the kitchen to adjust the bunker’s thermostat.
“But you were joking about Disneyland,” he said seriously. Despite his best efforts, Dean couldn’t match Cas’s expression. He covered his mouth with his hand and tried not to look too long at the ears. “This is what people wear there. I don’t need it if we’re not going.”
“I’m not wearing those,” he said, shoving the ears away from himself with his hand. They were normal ears, except they were covered in silver sparkles. “Those are for chicks.”
“He just wanted to go to Disneyland. His father never took him as a child,” Cas said, as if that explained anything. Dean rubbed his hand across the back of his neck, and it was starting to feel like he was on fire.
He understood why they called it the happiest place on earth today. Today Disneyland was pure magic. But yesterday it wasn’t. And after they left, it wouldn’t be anymore. Because the happiest place on earth couldn’t be anywhere but next to Cas.
Cas stood on the other side of the gates, already having flown into the park. He’d offered to take Dean with him, but flying with Cas was an experience Dean preferred to save for never again. Now he realized he was dumb to turn down the opportunity. He caught his angel- the angel’s- eye, just slightly jerking his head back in a signal. Judging from the way Cas disappeared, Dean hoped he’d gotten the hint.
A flap of wings interrupted his thoughts, and Cas was gone.
“I think couple’s trips to Disneyland are so romantic,” she said, smiling encouragingly at Cas. His eyebrows furrowed and he turned to look at Dean.
Dean’s first instinct was to tell his friend that he was adorable, but he bit it back. This was his friend. Friends were good. More was not. But that didn’t mean he couldn't make the most of this. It was just a funny situation. That was it.
“They’re silver,” Cas said, shaking his head. “Like you use to kill a werewolf. You like silver.”
“Actually, you know what?” he said, involuntarily taking a step towards Cas. A tuft of dark brown hair was sticking out on the side of the angel’s head, displaced by the Mickey ears. Dean’s hand itched to adjust it. He shoved his hand into his jean pocket instead. “I always kinda wanted to go to Disneyland. See the old rat trap.”
“Just give me the keys,” he said gruffly, smiling weakly at the girl as an afterthought when he realized how unfriendly he sounded. She never lost her friendly expression, handing him a little white envelope with two keycards inside. Dean’s stomach clenched when out of the corner of his eye he caught her wink at Cas as they left. What did she think this was, some kind of honeymoon?
They could smell the water and hear it splashing when the line made it indoors.
There was still a hint of tension, and it got worse when the night set in. The park would be closing soon, and they’d be going back to their hotel room. Alone.
“Come on, Dean,” Cas said with authority, pulling for a moment on the sleeve of Dean’s gray flannel. Dean dutifully followed as Cas led them past the Rivers of America, through the park, not stopping until they were in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle.
“I think he’s a mouse, actually,” Cas said automatically.
“Listen, Maggie,” he said, putting on his most charming smile and making direct eye contact with her. “I got a couple things I need to have with me. It’s alright, I’m FBI.”
Dean looked down at the bed, his face burning.
The plan was to find a motel in the city, but Dean found himself driving closer to the park anyway. Cas had been alive for eons and he’d never been to Disneyland. They had to do it right. So instead, Dean found himself pulling up to a giant hotel building that advertised free shuttle service to the parks.
Before he answered, Dean allowed himself one tiny moment to stare into the angel’s eyes. Not even living in the bunker together and seeing each other everyday lessened that strange, swooping feeling in his stomach when he did.
“I asked questions the first time I stopped here,” Cas said in answer to Dean’s raised eyebrows when they stopped. “This is the best place for the fireworks.”
“Put these on,” Cas said as he walked up, holding something at his side. Dean immediately resisted.
“Attention guests. The fireworks show will be starting in 10 minutes. We hope you enjoyed your day at the happiest place on earth,” they heard blasted through the park.
“Dean.” Before Dean could figure out what he was even trying to say, Cas leaned in.
Son of a bitch.
The fireworks in the sky had nothing on the ones inside Dean when their lips met.
The boat passed under a tunnel, with a mechanical dog at the top holding jail cell keys in its mouth. Dean turned to make a joke in Cas’s ear about how he felt about dogs, but Cas must have had a similar idea. They turned their heads and leaned in at the same time, their noses brushing against each other.
“I won’t die, Dean.”
David can hardly sleep for excitement.
“You better,” Sam says. He punches Dean roughly in the shoulder  and then gets out of the car. Melissa comes out of the house, holding June on her hip.
Castiel spins and his heart drops into his feet. Alastair has Dean by the throat up against a tree, and there’s blood all over Dean’s face.
“Did I tell you where I wanted to go?”
“Yeah, David,” Aaron says finally. “I’ve met an angel.”
Dean moves, takes Castiel’s mouth again, rocks into him more fiercely than before. Castiel’s fingers card through his hair, he moans, bites his lip. Dean breaks away and his eyes bore into Castiel’s, wide and truthful.
“Then come on, let’s go out,” Dean says, tossing back the rest of the wine in his glass like it’s a shot. “I’m looking forward to seeing you get drunk as a human. Bet it’s easier than when you were an angel, huh?”
“You aren’t really getting along, are you?” he asks.
“Get these dogs off me,” Dean growls.
“You did?” Dean sounds proud. “I should have known. You’re a regular Bear Grylls.”
“Mommy... toast,” she mumbles, burying her nose in Sam’s shoulder.
“You sound shocked.”
,” Dean moans, tossing his napkin across his lap. “How much would I have to pay to get you to leave that guy over there with the stupid hair and pick me instead?”
“As thrilling as this is, may we move on?” This must be Alastair; his voice sounds like it’s being squeezed out of a very small tube. “I’m really looking forward to killing you all today and I’d like to get started as quickly as possible.”
“Double of Jack,” he says, winking.
even, and not angels or demons or other hunters.
you want to throw all that away?”
“Dad, leave him alone, he doesn’t talk--”
But then Cas is gone, for some reason. There’s yelling again, but it’s different this time.
“Hey, gentle!” Dean scolds, whacking Sam on the arm. “She’s been out of work for a while.”
After a few moments, Castiel pulls away, his hands still framing Dean’s face. His eyes search Dean’s, and it’s like it’s always been with them-- the real things, the important things, they don’t need words, and Castiel finds what he’s looking for in Dean’s face because he leans up again, to press their lips together, and it’s less urgent this time, sweeter, and Dean feels like he could wrap himself up in this and never let go.
The next morning (Saturday, thank whoever) Dean tiptoes down the stairs and finds Melissa and Sam already up and making breakfast.
Then Sam is on his other side. “The demon is taken care of,” he tells Cas hurriedly. He looks down at Dean, his face stricken. “Dean, stay with us.”
As Sam shows Castiel how to load a shotgun, John paces before them like a military officer delivering strategy to his troops.
But Castiel is gazing up at the light with such a fierceness that Dean suddenly doesn’t even believe himself.
Over the next few weeks, Dean finds himself going out with Paul and Nick even more. Retirement had done the impossible and made him sober, and while he isn’t in AA or anything like that, he has tried to put drinking behind him, stuck in the past, just like hunting. He’s nursed waters and sodas out at bars, and the guys have never given him any crap about it.
“Dad!” Dean calls. “They’re here!”
“Cas was just--” he begins, but Dean cuts him off, glaring at Castiel.
“Oh, Dean.”
“I’ll take you back to school in the morning, Sammy,” John says. “I think we all need a good night’s sleep. In beds,” he adds, with a look towards Dean and Castiel. Then, realizing what he said with horror, he adds, “Separate ones! In different rooms! Dean, don’t look at me like that! Go brush your teeth! You’re a child, for God’s sake!”
The worry slides off of Castiel’s face and is replaced by ice.
“We can’t.”
Castiel doesn’t know why, but he follows Dean Winchester out of the store. He can already hear the distant sound of sirens.
“Friends of yours?” he says, raising an eyebrow.
“Bullshit,” Dean says immediately.
Dean collapses onto the bed, the woman next to him still writhing in delight. Dean winces at how winded he is, how his back aches; when did he get old?
It is Ben and Aaron, as well as Claire and Kevin, and David tries not to feel too insulted that they’re basically sending four people to babysit him while he conducts a very simple salt and burn. He obviously can’t interview witnesses or impersonate police officers, but he can sneak into the old house with Ben, find the old scraps of the dress the ghost was buried in, and burn them before she can kill any more people. After that, Claire takes him to the graveyard where they dig up the body just to be sure, and David is shocked by how unaffected he is by the acrid stench of a burning body.

“I will be careful, Dean. Thank you,” Castiel says, smiling gently.
He eventually finds himself standing in front of the big window on the landing looking out at the vineyard. In any other circumstance he would go the a walk around it to clear his head, but he knows that is likely what John’s doing and he doesn't fancy that conversation just yet. Instead, he places his hand gently on his lower stomach and rubs his hand across the area in slow circles.
He starts feeling bad the moment he leaves the dining room, largely helped along by the calming scents he now realizes Mary was trying to use to calm them down, along with the four pairs of eyes he can feel burning into his back.
Dean nods and they start to walk past her, with Dean pausing to give her a brief hug and whisper, “Thanks mom.” She only allows him a second or two before she’s shoving him towards the large table in the centre of the room.
He’s brought out of his musings when the alpha looks back up and he’s caught in the alpha’s crystal blue stare that has taken on a sad tone since last he looked.
Dean quirks his lips in a brief smile when he looks up at her. “Yeah, I'm fine mom, thanks. Just - tired I guess.”
Castiel looks stricken. “No, Dean, let me. It’s my fault, I should have left last week as we planned-”
Dean leans back in his seat and looks to Bobby, waiting for him to go on.
“I don’t mean actually married, just for show,” Castiel quickly jumps in.
Also, this chapter now makes up around half of the total word count of the fic (which I did not realize until today). So hopefully it was maybe a little bit worth the wait. (Again, I am so sorry)
I hope as much as this chapter was angsty you enjoyed the little scenes around the angst, because I enjoyed writing them. Thanks again so much for all the wonderful comments, it's great to know people are enjoying this and want to see the conclusion.
“Mr. Winchester, I have come to ask your forgiveness for lying to you and your family. It was only to help Dean but I understand your anger towards me for deceiving you.” John snorts derisively, but without further interruption Castiel takes it as an allowance to continue. “I also want to tell you that I love your son, and if he'll have me, I'd like to be his alpha. I was so blinded by my own insecurities that prevented myself from seeing how foolish I was to not tell him how I feel, to deny those feelings until I had left and I realised how deep they actually were.”
‘Al’ smirks over his shoulder at the beta before turning back to the other man. “Oh yeah?” He stands and goes to lean over the other alpha, clearly trying to intimidate him.
Why is he getting so wound up over this? He's not even really married to Cas. The man will be gone in the morning, and they're more than likely to never see each other again afterwards. Cas will go on with his life, and Dean - Dean will go on with his.
Mary is hanging back, allowing John to head up this argument, at least for the minute, but Dean can tell she’s angry as well. Bobby’s a little further back, with Henry off to the side as well. He can’t get a clear read on his grandfather from where he is, so he just hopes he’s not too pissed as well.
“Dean Winchester, it’s nice to meet you.”
“What about rings? It looks pretty fishy without rings.” It might be the best idea he’s got, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to accept it without a fight.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean sighs and runs a hand through his hair. “I’m just saying that you don't have to deal with this! What are you even doing here? You want to have a laugh at the dumb omega while his life crashes around him!” Dean knows his tone has definitely moved into accusing, but he can’t bring himself to care. “That it? Just thought you’d stop off on your trip home for a bit of a laugh, or what? What fucking reason could you have for being here? For dealing with all this
They look back out again and see that Mary has now joined John and they appear to be having a discussion of how to proceed in reaming him over. John's gesturing wildly and Mary is appearing to switch between calming him down and yelling back.
He goes to his childhood bedroom instead of what is still technically his parent’s room to try and find some solace, unable to look at the bed he shared with Cas. He stands next to the window and presses his face against the glass, staring out at the green expanse outside dimmed by twilight. Dean lifts a hand to his stomach and cradles the tiny bump. “Sorry about this kid,” he sighs. “I promise things are gonna be okay though, alright? You and me. We don’t need anyone else.”
Dean raises a hand to silence him. “No, Cas. This is on me. I need to do this. He’s my dad, and if he kills me for what I tell him,” he laughs almost freely, feeling almost giddy with the fact he no longer cares. He laughs like a man with nothing left to give and ready to deal with whatever will be thrown at him. "Then I guess I’ll deal with it.”
“You used to have an omega that would say that, didn’t you Al?” He says, addressing the alpha.
Dean feels slightly less horrible about lying to Mary because he did actually go out to celebrate after his exams, just he was already seeing an alpha at the time, except that one just turned out to be a dick.
“Yeah, about that. What’s the plan here? We’ve confirmed this is angel business, but what does that mean for us?”
Dean raises an eyebrow at him.
He wishes he had his book.
“How many months,” Dean demands, alcohol slurring his words and making him louder than he needs to be.
he screams like a little girl, but he can’t be sure. Moments later he feels weight on his legs-- most likely the labrador.
“You like that romantic crap?”
Paul practically glows with secondhand happiness. Dean decides not to mention that he brings his lunch every day.
“I actually gotta be getting home,” Dean says, reaching out to shake everyone’s hand again. “Paul, Nick, thanks for finally getting me out for a night, I’ll see you guys at the garage next week... nice to meet you, Jude--”
“How much you got?” she teases, and when Sam makes an indignant noise, she cups his cheek and kisses him sweetly. “I’m just kidding, baby, like there’s enough money in the world to lure me away from your stupid hair.”
“You idiot,” is the first thing Dean says. Castiel chuckles and places a hand on his cheek. Dean sits up, taking deep breaths. “Cas, he says. “Cas, I—”
John looks up in surprise from where he and Sam are tangling with Azazel. Sam has Azazel’s arms and John has a large bag of salt in his arms.
And those moments give them both hope.
He doesn’t call Castiel.
“You’ve met an angel?” David asks eagerly, leaning forward.
“Miracles,” Dean repeats, still bleary-eyed.
“Okay,” Dean says, dropping his eyes.
He thinks about how all of that could have been a lie.
“Excuse me?” Dean says. He’s starting to lose feelings in his legs.
All hell breaks loose once the first aggressive movement is made; within seconds, Meg has Castiel pinned up against the wall, her breath smelling like blood against his face.
Dean leans forward and brushes the hair off of Castiel’s forehead, a tender, sweet movement, and Castiel opens his eyes to gaze at Dean with a look in his eye that Dean wants to photograph and tuck away in his wallet, to take out and stare at sometimes, to have and to hold when he’s sad or lonely. It’s a look that rips right down into Dean’s soul, and it’s all the better because Castiel
“Let me finish, Cas. Yes, I want you to have your powers, but that’s because
“Funny story,” he says, and then stops. Castiel is staring at him expectantly.
“So why are you really here, Dean?” Castiel asks, eyes on his drink. “I thought when we spoke on the phone that you understood my feelings.”
“So do you want my number?” she asks, a bit of edge to her tone. “Because if you don’t--”
“And then we had to save the world, but it wasn’t the apocalypse, it was a nuclear reactor or something and we had to climb all these stairs so you could fix it, so we were just climbing and climbing--”
Later that night, David examines his face in the mirror. Dark hair that sweeps across his forehead but curls weirdly by his ears. Lanky body from running around Garth’s backyard for the past year. His nose is sharp, his chin strong. His eyes are big and blue,  and he wonders if they’re the reason the sheriff’s daughter was so set on him. He blinks, once, and wonders why he doesn’t seem to have those feelings. He knows he hasn’t met too many people yet and that he’s still young, but he’s never even had a crush on someone he’s seen on TV, or a book character or anything. Well...
“Oh, so it’s like that,” Dean smirks. “You little tease. Well, then how do you like this?” He buries his nose into Castiel’s shoulder and snuffles wildly.
“That car has been through worse shit than a little door-slamming,” he says, but his eyes soften as they fall onto the Impala, looking shiny and beautiful as always (like Dean would take her out on the road looking less than perfect).
When he opens his eyes in the morning, both his hangover and the shame from last night hit him at the same time. He wants to roll over and go back to sleep. He wants to go upstairs and tell Cas he’s sorry, that he didn’t mean it, any of it, that he hates himself for being that cruel.
“Oh, really?” Castiel says, his voice rising. “Well, that makes sense. Because that’s how it’s always been, hasn’t it? I should just
David is ashamed by the relief that spreads through his body at that statement. He knows full well that he has no claim on Dean, that the man is dead and has been since before David was even born, but it doesn’t keep him from wanting to dance around knowing that he’s not going to meet one of Dean’s kids or, god forbid, Dean’s widow.
“No,” he says. “I’ll come back for your wedding, man. For Junie’s birthday. I’ll visit as often as I can. But... I just can’t live here anymore.”
okay,” Dean says, and he wants to write it in the sky. He doesn’t know what’s
Dean watches the dogs peer worriedly from him to the house back to him, their big eyes sad, and he turns on his heel and stalks out of the salvage yard.
Castiel takes off out the open door of the cabin, his shotgun ready in his arms. He stops to listen for sounds of struggle, but the woods offer only the normalcy of twittering birds and rustling leaves. Castiel begins to run, not knowing whether he’s even headed in the right direction. He knows he’s making too much noise to be able to sneak up on Dean and Alastair, but at this point, his main objective is finding them and he doesn’t care how he does it.
“It’s not the same thing and you know it,” Dean says. “You’ve been human for five years and you think you’re a goddamn expert. But you’re not.”
“So, you know how Josie and I and Aiden always told you that you were special?” Krissy says, plaing her other hand on top of David’s.
Paul’s-friend-Gina is having a party, and her apartment is already full of people by the time they all stumble in. Paul wanders off to hug a group of people, all of whom scream, “Happy birthday!” at him, and Gina takes his arms gently to guide him to a couch.
“Dean?” he mumbles.
He vanishes up the stairs, leaving Melissa and Dean to feast on eggs at the table and steal all the coffee.
“I’ve been tracking some anomalies up the coast,” he says, flipping through some pages. “Odd lights in the sky, people going missing.” He quirks an eyebrow at Dean. “Miracles.”
He cracks an eye and regrets it immediately-- the sun is streaming in through the window right next to his face and it makes his head throb painfully. Dean scrunches his eyes shut again and pulls the soft sheets over his head.
Dean chuckles as Castiel pulls down a couple of wine glasses from the cabinet and yanks a bottle of red from the pantry.
“You?” he asks, as if the mere idea of Dean leaving the state by himself is preposterous. “Dean, I thought you liked it here.”
“But you love him,” Gina says, her tone almost defiant, and Dean hesitates for a second before he shakes his head.
If Castiel were home, he would be reading. He reaches into his pocket absently and realizes that the paperback he was purchasing before Dean came in is there. He must have slipped it in during his altercation with the... the demon. He pulls it out, runs a finger along the exposed neck of the swooning heroine.
Castiel throws the phone onto the counter and fixes Dean with the most murderous glare he’s ever seen.
Castiel glares at him, but the ire is gone.
It doesn’t feel anything like anything Dean’s ever felt before; Castiel rips all of these new feelings out of him that he’d usually rather push down, rather keep locked away, far from the sun, to be safe; Castiel pulls him open, brings those things to light, but somehow makes him feel taken care of at the same time, and Dean doesn’t know when he started trusting Castiel with his entire life again, but when he opens his eyes and looks at Castiel, flushed, panting, beautiful beneath him, he feels nothing but safe, trusting... home.
They say it’s over because they want it to be, but Dean knows the truth. It’s never over. Not really.
Gina is beautiful when she and Dean have sex, and it’s good, it really is, but afterwards he doesn’t want to do anything but roll over and pass out. So he does.
?” she screams in his face. “He is
half-way. And you know the way we were raised. Sam’s not going to want to pretend to be a dad and then leave. If he’s committed to being the Bug’s dad, then he’s going to be her dad.”
Dean’s been driving for hours before his mind clears enough that he thinks to call Castiel. They haven’t spoken since their fight but Dean knows it would piss both Cas and Sam off if he went into this without backup.
“You’re too tall for me anyway,” Dean grumbles, digging into his eggs, and Melissa’s laugh rings in the kitchen.
“Oh, really?” Castiel snaps. “Were you also a warrior of God for a millennia, Dean? Did I miss that somehow?”
“They don’t know they’re outnumbered anyway,” Sam says, matching his father’s smirk.
The fight has gone out of Dean, too, and he sags onto the bed, energy spent.
David feels a lump in his throat. He knew Sam was probably dead, judging from the way everybody talked about him, but it was another thing completely to hear it spoken so frankly by someone who was close to him.
” before the phone falls out of his hand and he succumbs to darkness.
“You calling me fat?” Dean feigns hurt.
“Don’t make me pump you full of rock salt,” Dean says. “I guarantee, it won’t be fun for you. Go on, you’ve played scout... go back to your brother and your sister and tell them we’re ready.”
Castiel studies his face for a moment, mouth twisted and eyes exasperated.
“Yeah,” Sam sighs, completely oblivious to Dean’s pain, and he floats off to his room, probably to write about it in his diary or something.
“Go ahead,” Dean says, turning away, heading for the couch. “Fuck all of Sioux Falls. Fuck the whole damn state of South Dakota if you want to. I don’t care.”
like the sound of a machete being swung very hard, and a couple thuds. Dean hopes it’s vampire heads hitting the ground. Then... silence.
“It’s cool, man,” Dean says earnestly. “I mean, no disrespect. Chastity, and all that.”
“Don’t act like this is all me, Krissy,” Garth says, prying her fists off his jacket. “It’s what he wants, and he’s good.”
He stuffs his arms through the sleeves of the coat, and
“I think it’s for the best,” Sam says, apologetic. “I mean, we only ever got Cas into trouble. It’s for the best we keep our distance.”
Dean steps forward and shakes out the coat until it hangs, full-length, from his hands. He steps close enough to Castiel that he could press their foreheads together if he wanted to, and he wraps the trenchcoat around Castiel’s shoulders.
Unfortunately, he’s way out of practice.
“Sixes?”
“Oh, thank God.”
of your business,” he says. “But since I know you’re not going to stop bugging me, fine. I went on
“David?
“I ruined their lives,” he says. “Make it so they won’t remember.”
Dean tries to smile, but it must look like more a grimace, because she immediately purses her lips.
“I come here often,” is all Castiel says as he seats himself at a little table adjacent to the bar.
Dean works late doing accounting stuff, and by the time he locks up at quarter to ten, the last place he wants to be is Gina’s apartment, forcing small talk and ending the night with sex. So he goes back to what is technically still home for him-- he and Sam’s apartment close to Stanford’s campus.
. I know it’s been your dream since forever, and I love visiting it, I really do. Seeing you and Melissa and June-bug, that’s so great, Sammy, it really is. But I don’t want it for myself.”
Dean buries his head in his arms and groans.
” Castiel lunges at him with grabby fingers, but Dean dodges him and throws himself down the stairs, Castiel on his heels.
One of the witches actually looks up, her eyebrows furrowing.
Dean responds with a tight smile that he’s sure makes him look constipated.
“I don’t care,” Castiel says, firmly, and it may sound like something directly out of his romance novels, but it’s exactly how he feels.
Sam’s not home from a study-session with friends, so Dean just crawls out of his clothes and tumbles into bed, but he doesn’t fall asleep for a long time.
“Can’t wait, dude.”
“Well I’ll let y’all get back to your drinks,” Mark says. “Cas, give me a ring sometime, all right? You’ve still got my number?”
“Excuse me?” Dean sputters. “I tell you that, and all you can say is--”
Castiel crosses the room in two strides, takes Dean’s face in his hands, and kisses him. The words get lost in Dean’s throat as his hands come up to squeeze Castiel’s waist, and he gasps in surprise when Castiel presses forward, deepening the kiss, plunging into Dean’s open mouth.
David sits up a little. “There is?”
All of the sudden, the pain is white-hot and David feels like he’s on fire. He knows he’s screaming, but he can’t hear himself. He can feel bones cracking underneath his hands and he knows he’s squeezing too hard, but he can’t think and he can’t breathe, all he can do is scream. He thinks can hear Charlie saying “so close, I’m so close to it, I can feel it my fingertips, hold him down, hold him down” and then even worse pain than before, he didn’t know it could get worse, but it has, and it’s eating him up inside and he tries to say “stop, stop, you’re killing me
In the morning, over the breakfast table, Garth hands him a slim paperback and says, “I was gonna save these for your birthday, but plans change. Start reading, kid.”
Dean wrenches his arm from around Castiel’s waist and rolls off the bed, stumbling a bit.
Castiel is seventeen years old and his mother despairs of him. As he is preceded by four older brothers who made excellent grades, earned numerous awards, and maintained healthy social lives during their high school years, Mrs. Novak expected that her youngest son would follow in their glorious footsteps.
Sam nods, and in a very rare act of brotherly maturity and affection, he reaches across the table and squeezes Dean’s hand. And in a similarly rare act of maturity, Dean doesn’t even make fun of him for it.
“So, Dean, where’d you live before California?” Nick asks, startling Dean out of his thoughts.
, I should just
In the moments it takes for him to dress and slip on his shoes, the voices escalate and he rushes into the kitchen to find Dean being screamed at by a gruff looking man with a gun. The man’s back is to Castiel, and Dean’s eyes find his. He shakes his head slightly, and Castiel can see “get out, get out” written plainly on his face, but before he can retreat back into his room, the mysterious man rounds on him.
Occasionally, there are signs, and it takes every inch of self-control Dean possesses to repress the instinct to run to the basement of their house, dig out the shotgun shells, and start blasting at every shiver in the air. But Sam is insistent. He won’t let Dean sleep with a knife under his pillow anymore.
“Would you keep your voice down?” Castiel hisses.
“Goodnight,” Dean mumbles into Castiel’s shoulder.
Or at least he tries, but it’s impossible to actually fall asleep when a furious woman is glaring daggers at your back, seething with rage.
“So, what are you doing here?” Castiel says, the barest hint of anger beneath his words.
“Nothing I say is going to change your mind, is it?” Sam asks, sounding very defeated, which makes Dean feel so very guilty, but he shakes his head.
“Heal him.”
“Bring it to me like you said you would when I asked.”
“Move,” Castiel breathes, and Dean does.
Castiel shakes his head. “I forget,” he says quietly, “how gentle you can be.”
“You thought I traveled halfway across the country to fuck you?” Dean practically screams, and he gets a moment of perverse pleasure when Castiel flinches.
bouncing around his brain, making him feel excited and happy without knowing why.
Dean closes his eyes against the pain, against the truth written in every furious line on Castiel’s face. He expects, wishes for, wants another punch to his face, his stomach. He wants Castiel’s fingers around his neck. He wants to feel his bones shatter, feel his last breath leave him.
Dean hears the screen door slam again as Castiel comes bolting out of the house, tugging on his pants, and grabs his arm. He tries to pull away, but Castiel is strong.
“Well, that’s not very good for you,” Gina says. “Chicken is healthier. I’ll see you at home around eight, Dean?”
That’s a can of worms Dean can’t open right now, so he pretends that was a super normal way to answer a question and suggests that they try to find Ingrid first thing in the morning. They undress slowly without looking at each other, folding themselves into their separate beds. The space between them feels like a chasm that Dean could never cross, but just before he flicks off the light, Castiel says, “Good night, Dean,” and the hurt lessens, just a little.
He stares at the phone for hours.
“All right,” Castiel breathes.
“Coming right up, angel,” Melissa says, and Dean feels a stab of hurt in his gut. He can feel Sam’s eyes on him, but he refuses to look, focusing on June instead.
Dean preens as he takes June from Sam, smoothing her blonde curls and sitting her on his lap.
and then there it is. Like a book taken off a shelf, like a trunk opened, like a song playing on the radio, it’s all there, clear as a day, like it was never buried.
“You know those few days were the worst of my life, don’t you?” Castiel asks, his voice weak. “I regret everything that happened then, Dean, and I hate thinking about it, and I hate that no matter how much I atone, there are things I took from you  that I can never give back--”
“You are
“Well,” Dean smiles. “Are you coming, or are you coming?”
. He wants to say
His eyes are open in an instant, and terror floods his veins. He thinks about how stupid it was of him not to have crafted some sort of weapon: there are dangers in this world besides bears and snakes, as he has discovered in this past week, and if the demons are looking for the Winchesters, they might just find him by accident. He scoots as far back into the cave as he can go, hands scrabbling the ground for a rock or a stick, anything to defend himself. The crashing continues, getting closer and closer, and Castiel sighs and closes his eyes, preparing for the worst, preparing to die--
After that. Garth puts him through even more training, presumably to distract him, which David appreciates. He’s getting pretty good, too, and he wins more fights than he loses.
The other witch looks up now, and now they’re definitely paying attention. Virginia scowls.
want to leave California. Relax, man.”
“Next time,” Castiel yawns. “I’m about to fall asleep standing up.”
? He knows about Sam, but not
“Just stop Sam!” Castiel shouts, and he reaches for Dean’s face.
There are a million things Castiel wishes he could say to Dean in this moment. He says none of them, but he wonders why Dean uses the word ‘job’.
Confronted with this memory, Dean almost flings himself out the train window. Hitchhiking back to California sounds a lot easier than facing Castiel in a few short hours. He takes a deep breath and forces himself not to freak out.
“Oh, Dean,” he hears Cas say, and he
They talk and talk for the rest of the night. Dean tells Castiel about everything he can think of: Sam’s school stories, the garage, Paul and Nick and Jude and some of their nights on the town. Castiel responds with his own stories about living in Sioux Falls, the people he’s met, some of the hunts he’s been on. Dean had been anticipating that after his revelation, the night would descend into horrible awkwardness, but that moment just doesn’t come. On the contrary, he didn’t think he and Castiel had ever talked this much, not so casually, about their lives. They had always had some greater purpose, some more pressing issue on their minds, no time to tell meaningless anecdotes for laughs.
“I know,” Cas nods hurriedly. “I want you, too. Please, Dean.”
Jessica smiles a bit sadly and nods.
Getting into their nest is easy enough; they’re all gone, probably out drinking or eating somewhere. Hopefully they’ll come home drunk, making them easier to behead. Dean checks his pockets for the vials of dead man’s blood, and settles in to wait.
“Say you’ll stop hunting,” Castiel says.
He doesn’t speak, just runs a finger along the rim of his glass. Inside, Dean is screaming.
The phone moves again, and Dean hears the whimpering.
Dean cuts off his brother with a clap to the shoulder.
Dean is gone when Castiel opens his eyes the next morning. He panics for several minutes, his mind going everywhere at once: Dean was eaten by bears, Dean was killed by demons, Dean drowned in the lake...
“He likes you already,” Sam tells him as Dean follows his father, throwing Castiel a grin over his shoulder. “He just won’t admit it yet. He has to keep up the ‘big-bad-military-man’ act until you kill something.”
They’re ready to go once Cas has organized a friend to come by the house and feed the dogs, and they drive to North Carolina, the site of the last miracle. Apparently someone had nearly drowned in the Outer Banks, and when the lifeguard on duty had failed to resuscitate, a mysterious stranger had appeared and laid hands on the blue-lipped victim, who had immediately coughed up gallons of sea water.
He can see the train is getting closer to his stop so he makes sure he has all his things, especially seeing as he moved seats part way through the journey. He cringes slightly as he remembers how well that went and considers whether it would have been better to just stay where he was. When he moves into the aisle he’s reminded further when he spots the alpha from earlier asleep a few rows down and quickly shuffles past to wait by the doors until they open.
The other man puts his arm along the back of the seat and somehow leans even closer, nearly making Dean gag on his putrid scent. “Yeah, he used to say he wasn’t interested, always meant the opposite though…” He feels fingers beginning to stroke along the top of his shoulder and okay, he’s about one second away from punching this clown, pregnancy be d-
“Hey Cas.”
Dean chuckled and Castiel could swear he saw a slight blush rise on his friend’s cheeks. He gestured with his bottle to where a sheet was pulled over something.  “Yeah, I finished it, but I’d hardly call it a masterpiece.” Castiel tilted his head at Dean and turned his gaze to the sheet. “May I see it?”
The ride back is silent and Dean’s not sure if the quiet disappointment and pity from Bobby is worse than the visible anger from John.
Just as he is about to judge the man asleep and make a decision if it would be better or worse to wake him the figure lets out a low growl.
“I am so fucking sorry about all of that. I knew it’d be bad but I’d hoped you wouldn't be dragged into it like that, even though it was kind of your fault a little bit. But I so get it if you want to leave now and skip dinner.” Dean knows he's probably rambling but before he can regret it too much, Castiel is jumping in.
“What is that?!” She says pointing at the metallic gold ring on his finger.
Dean stepped closer, putting them back into each other's space. He met Dean’s eyes again, then allowed his own to dip to Dean’s lips before moving back up. His tongue darted out quickly to wet his lips and saw Dean’s eyes track the movement.
“Hey beautiful,” says the alpha in the seat next to him, leaning into his space an uncomfortable amount for Dean’s tastes. Dean keeps his eyes on his book and makes sure to not acknowledge them beyond what’s necessary when he responds,“Not interested.”
John turns his anger on Dean. “No Dean. You made this choice. You have to deal with the consequences.” The old alpha steps forward and Dean fights the instinctive urge to retreat. “How did you think this was going to go? You show up out of the blue, without so much as a call, wandering through the fields with an unknown alpha, who you claim is your husband.” The scent of angry alpha starts to permeate the room, and Dean finds himself hunching his shoulders and trying to resist the instinct to wrap his arms around his stomach to protect his pup. He still keeps his head up, meeting the angry glare aimed at him. He tries to prepare himself for whatever line of argument his father will use next, dreading whatever his father will say when Dean doesn’t reply. However, he’s spared when the sudden scent of angry omega cuts into the tense atmosphere.
“Dean-” Mary says, trying to prevent the trainwreck they can all see coming, but John is clearly as unwilling as Dean to pay much attention to her at this point.
They smiled gently at each other, dipping back in for a few more brief kisses before stepping back.
He doesn’t do any of that though. Instead he stays where he is on the ground and looks up at Dean, almost a parody of a proposal. “Dean, please, allow me to help you. I’d like to know at least one of us gets to go home at the end of this journey.” There’s an unexpected vulnerability in the man’s beautiful eyes and Dean can’t help but hold them. He’s not sure which one of them looks away first, but suddenly Castiel is on his feet again and holding out a hand to Dean who takes it and allows himself to be pulled to his feet.
Dean’s preparing for the interrogation and intimidation tactics to start then, when quick slight footsteps precede the sudden appearance of red hair in the doorway.
The air of the room was suddenly tenser than it had previously and the moment felt as though it dragged out longer until Dean broke the silence.
“Yeah, probably.” Dean laughed, “Just trying to get something done to make the last minute rush easier.”
"Bet you he'll be here," she says in that know-it-all way that all little sisters have. He rolls his eyes at her to hide the fact he's annoyed at her for poking such a fresh wound. "Charlie, he's gonna be on a train back to his wife by now, he wasn't sticking around."
“Actually Dad, yeah I do. I do know him. I know he’s nice, and he’s kind. And that he’s smart, and gentle, and protective and he cares about me. So, I’m sorry, Dad, if my decision to marry an alpha
He has to focus on his dad though, as much as he wants to run after Cas he has enough sense to recognise he wouldn’t only be putting his life in jeopardy but his pup's life if he runs in there now.
“Like how you had actual feelings for Castiel, or how much your professor was a complete dick to you, which honestly I kind of suspected with how things had gone, but still.”
Dean is kind of wishing he could sink into his seat right about now but doesn’t intervene, hoping that maybe they’ll at least get the message and back off.
He turns and swings his rucksack onto his back and goes to hoist up one end of his case, “You gonna give me a hand lugging this thing up the hill or what?”
That finally pulls a laugh from Dean and he realizes he’s in much lighter spirits than he was at the beginning of this conversation. “Cas, man, I’m really grateful, but honestly, you don’t have to do this.” Even as he says the words he’s hoping Castiel won’t now agree with him, grab his bags, and carry on down the road, leaving Dean to figure out how to make the best of his original plan.
Dean scoffs. “Don’t you have somewhere to be or something?”
Castiel’s eyes switch from Dean to Henry, and Dean can’t help but be glad for the reprieve. As much as the clear concern in the alpha’s eyes warms him, he didn’t enjoy the scrutiny. “My name is Castiel Novak, it is very nice to meet you, Mr. Winchester.”
“Oh.” Looks like it’s going to be pity. “You’re…?”
Just as Dean says that, John turns and meets his eyes through the windshield almost as if he heard him.
Dean pulled the cloth back to reveal a frame of metal rods going across vertical and horizontal creating a square of sorts. Attached to the rods were, looked to be close to a hundred, different shapes and sizes of glass pieces. Most of them blue, but some with other touches of color as well, spread out what appeared to be randomly across the metal framework. The dusk sunlight was filtering through the windows, catching the glass was only adding to the effect.
Castiel is still looking wary, but now the atmosphere in the room is feeling suffocating and needs to leave. “So, uh, I’m gonna go see what my mom wants. Try and avoid people if you can. Stay here if you want. Or not…” Dean starts backing towards the door. “Just, don't get shot or anything. My dad probably wouldn't, but this isn't really something that's come up before so-” he knocks into the door and quickly opens it and steps through.
“That’s it’s name. An Ocean in Blue Eyes.”
Dean clears his throat before speaking. "Uh, yeah, he had to leave for...work." Dean feels unprepared for this conversation so for now, he chooses the easiest line to go with.
Dean hesitates in his peeling long enough that she no doubt notices before he replies. “Yeah, course I do, Mom.”
Sorry it's late, but it's still the weekend so that's like... Friday's siblings.
Castiel looked back to the sculpture, and couldn’t help the look of awe he knew was on his face. “It’s beautiful, Dean. Incredible…” He reached out to trace the nearest piece of glass, feeling the smoothed and sanded edges.
When he pulls back and his arms slide from around her, green eyes move to his left hand and she grabs it.
As usual I will start by apologising.
Cas nods in understanding. “Thank you, Dean. I am sure she is lovely, and it will be a pleasure to meet her if you think so highly of her.”
He quickly brushes away the tear tracks on his cheeks and looks up in time to see Mr. gorgeous from earlier round the bend in the road and catch sight of him. His brows are furrowed and that little crease is back and Dean should not find that look as cute as it is. If this alpha turns out to be anything less than the chivalrous idiot he appears Dean is royally screwed because he knows for a fact that the nearest house is a couple miles away and there’s not likely anyone around to help him if he needs it.
Cas takes the compliment far better than Dean ever could, and merely smiles serenely with a quick bashful look down before meeting her eyes again. “Thank you, Mrs. Winchester. May I say that you look quite beautiful yourself?”
Dean stops in front of the group. “The fire department’s on its way, did you get everyone out?”
They get out of the car and do the whole song and dance of the barrels up to the minister, someone throws some garlands of orange leaves and other autumnal pieces over their heads, the wine is blessed and declared good, and then the glasses start getting handed out and everyone's happy to start drinking with a raucous cheer.
She just shrugs, looking out over the crowd. "How much would you bet?"
“You lied, Dean. To all of us. You told us you were married, and you brought some random alpha you hardly knew into our home to do so! What the hell were you thinking?!”
“Yeah?” Dean had moved closer now and was a lot closer than he’d been, with an almost proud look gracing his features. He couldn’t help but think that the sculpture wasn’t the only beautiful thing in the room.
I'm sorry this took twice as long to do as the last chapter, but that is because I had basically the whole chapter done, then I decided I hated it so I used it as an outline and re-wrote everything.
It’s Sam who breaks it this time.
He can’t help but let out a small gasp as it occurs to him the alternative they might offer though, and his hand flies to his stomach. He knows no matter what they say, he’s not getting rid of it.
Dean gives her a weak smile in return and rests his hand on top of hers to squeeze it. “Thanks, mom,” he murmurs.
Shortly they are all finally around the table, but no sooner than grace has been said does everyone return to silence as they focus on their food. Dean's startled when a slight throat clearing across from him breaks the tension a few minutes into the awkward meal. “This is very delicious, Mrs.Winchester. Thank you.”
I apologise in advance
It was several hours later that Castiel felt satisfied enough with his work to leave it for the day. Charlie had finished painting her engine not too long after he’d arrived and managed to coax Kevin from his nap under the table. A few others had been in and out to work on their projects, but none stayed longer than an hour. Apart from Dean that is, who had been working alongside him since his arrival, but taking small breaks, unlike Castiel. One of these had included returning with coffees for both of them though, so he would count that as a break, despite what Dean thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
He feels a small smile crack across his face at the sight. “Dude, stop apologizing, it’s fine. Better late than never and all that.” Without getting up, Dean holds his hand out high enough for Castiel to shake,
Dean's taken aback slightly by the suggestion, and as much as he still feels somewhat standoffish towards John, he sees the olive branch for what it is and nods, hoping the drive will be just the simple drop off. Which, knowing his dad, is pretty likely. John, despite all his faults, doesn't tend to be too underhand when he wants something to be known or happen.
Dean knows his father won’t hesitate to make his displeasure at the simplicity of that career choice known even before he hears him snort derisively. In response Dean lays down his cutlery and angles himself toward John, but doesn’t yet meet his eyes.
“No, Grandpa Henry, it was me who didn’t tell anyone I was coming back.” He gives him a squeeze around his shoulders and gets one in return and steps back. He wonders if Bobby had perhaps opened his study door enough to alert him more quickly to the commotion going on downstairs.
They don’t get a chance for introductions before they need to start getting ready for dinner. As it’s a homecoming meal of sorts, they make it a bit more fancy than usual, with Mary promising that they’re eating in the proper dining room with the fucking mahogany table from 1900-and-whatever. Of course that means they have to dress up a bit more. Dean makes his excuses and escapes back to his bedroom to find Cas. The alpha only has the suit he came in, but after a shower and an ironing later, paired with one of Dean’s shirts and a tie, he’s not looking quite like he had walked several miles in it. Dean swiftly follows suit, and soon enough they’re gravitating towards the dining room and the smells of food.
Charlie looks back up at him, and he knows he's got her, even if she tries to glare at him. “Maybe.”
The warmth in John’s face is so genuine Dean feels a lump form in his throat, and the floor seems to drop out the bottom of his stomach. He’s not sure how much of it is from the fear of taking that away from John, from himself, when he tells him the truth, or from wishing that he could keep it all. That they could have a wedding, that he and Cas could have their happily ever after, with his father’s approval and his whole family there. But that isn’t going to happen and Dean feels it like a stab in the heart. He knows without a doubt what he needs to do, Castiel is metaphorically out the door looking back because of some sense of duty and Dean needs to face up to his mistakes. The lie’s gone far enough and he’ll have to do it now or later, and later is coming up quick.
“Are you okay? Sam asks. “Mom and Dad are still fighting, I didn’t catch much more than a couple words so I couldn’t tell you who’s winning.”
Dean hugs her back and takes in her comforting smell of cherry blossoms and lavender before he replies tentatively and “Sorry, mom. I wanted it to be a surprise.”
“She was only going a bit father in to check and told me to keep going and I wasn’t arguing with her. She'll probably be out in a minute, just wait Dean-’
I'm sorry
Dean's surprised though when John gives him an almost warm pat on the shoulder as he comes up next to him. "Well done, boy. Dean," he seems to correct himself. "Do you fancy driving into town with me this time? Just like old times, eh?"
“You don’t know my dad. Anyway, it takes two to tango and all that,” Dean smirks, forgetting his situation a moment in exchange for a lewd joke. He quickly sobers up again when he doesn’t get a laugh out of the other man and clears his throat. “Reputation’s a kind of big thing for him though, and an unmarried and unmated pregnant omega son wouldn’t really help that.”
They pose for pictures for the paper and all the other stuff that goes with the fun, but as only a background member of the 'family business,' he manages to escape after only a few minutes and moves to sit on a low wall nearby where Charlie has settled herself.
They pause as Dean directs them into his old room, and they put down the case and close the door.
Dean’s at a loss for what to say in response so he just mumbles, "Um, thanks Dad, that means a lot."
“Am I late? I didn’t mean to be, sorry, I just got sidetracked for a bit, then, y’know, suddenly I was late.” Her eyes dart around the dimly lit room then rest surely on Castiel and a bright smile slips onto her face instead. “Oh hi! You must be Dean’s husband!” She glides smoothly to Castiel and holds out her hand a second before ducking to give him a hug. Castiel looks startled but hugs her back hesitantly. Dean lifts his glass to his lips, with a quick sniff to ensure it’s only water, to hide his smile. He notices John roll his eyes, but Dean can tell there is a hint of fondness, used to Charlie’s behaviour, but annoyed as to who it’s currently directed. He crosses the room to take his seat, deciding that it’s not yet the time to make Dean regret every decision that has brought him to this point.
“Uh yeah.” Dean still didn’t look up and Castiel kept his gaze locked on him as he continued to look down, but his eyes appeared to have shifted so that he was now looking at the sculpture. Dean seemed to be debating something with himself, so Castiel decided to wait for him to come to a conclusion instead of interrupting and similarly turned to look back at the piece.
“Boy, what happened to you was shit, and that alpha that thought it’d be a good idea to leave you in the lurch after leading you along is a dick with a capital D. But that wasn’t your fault, what was your fault was what happened after that. Try and remember that your daddy’s not angry because you’re expecting a little one-”
“And anyway, you never answered my question,” Castiel adds. He then waits as Dean scans his mind back through their conversation to answer.
“Dean let go of me!” John protests. Dean is now holding most of his father’s weight as Sam’s glassy eyes are fixed on the house only loosely holding John now, and Henry has appeared at his brother’s shoulder on the other side.
“I was going to figure it out.”
After pushing through the crowded Kansas station to the bus stop, Dean soon finds himself settling into his seat on the bus where another bout of fatigue hits him and he can feel himself already nearing sleep again. He’s just beginning to drop off again as the bus rolls away from the station and a shouting from outside the bus makes him sit up.
Mini warning: Dean experiences some abdominal pain briefly and worries it's to do with something being wrong with the baby
Enjoy
"She left me with divorce papers when I returned from service. I have had them in my possession since I met Dean, but I was an idiot and thought it was better to have something I at least considered stable in some definition of the word that I could perhaps salvage than to go out on a limb and hope for something real. Something with your son. But tonight I signed the papers and they are on the way to her now. If Dean wants me, I will spend the rest of my life being the best husband and alpha I could possibly be to him and love the pup he carries as if it were my own. I love him. And it is because of that I will accept whatever his choice is. If he doesn't feel the same I will happily walk away and never bother him or your family again."
“Would it make it up to you if I introduced you to him?”
“What’s going on? Who is arguing? What happened?” A flustered looking Henry Winchester sweeps into the room from the hall, ruffled grey hair falling over the side of his face and jacket looking to be inside out is on his shoulders. Sharp hazel eyes sweep the room and the stiff posture of its occupants, only glancing over the two alphas that have yet to break their staring contest, and land themselves on Dean, bringing a sunshine bright smile out across his old features.
Dean watches her cautiously as he replies. “I, uh, I got married.” He makes himself smile as convincingly as he can and tries to surreptitiously pull his hand away before she can examine the ring more thoroughly.
“Henry Winchester, Dean’s grandfather. It’s a pleasure to meet Dean’s husband. I hope you will be good to him,” Henry’s voice lowers almost imperceptibly when he continues, “And if I hear of any words to the  contrary, I assure you that we will be having words.”
There is a fountain in the middle of the courtyard he is standing in that’s probably older than Grandpa Henry and that he features solidly in so many early memories. He can’t stop himself moving toward it and sitting on the now cool stone edge to look up at the open skies above the house.
Thanks to the people who haven't given up on getting an update and for commenting and getting me off my ass. And to everyone new, welcome, and I hope you're enjoying the read.
“You’ll like this place, kid,” but as soon as the quiet words pass his lips, he thinks about how they might not actually be here by the time they’re born. Dean sighs and let's his hand drop, trying to fight off the melancholy mood settling over him. He stays at the window a moment longer, just watching the breeze sway the short trees around the field. Eventually he knows he should go downstairs though, and decides to brave the risk of running into Castiel, Bobby, or anyone else who happens to be around.
Castiel grabs his hand and squeezes tight and nods then takes off back towards the house. Dean yells at his back and starts running toward the brewery. “I’m gonna raise the alarm! Don’t die you dumb son of a bitch!”
Castiel smirked and turned back to where he’d left his paint. He had nothing against Dean’s extracurricular activities (other than the fact he’d prefer it if Dean hadn’t slept with just about everyone except him), if he did, art school was probably the wrong place to be. Most of the students followed similar patterns, with work often being done in the week, or night in some cases, before their projects were due. Usually fueled by coffee, redbull, and cigarettes.
However, a second after that thought crosses his mind, thudding footsteps can be heard from the back hallway, coming steadily nearer, and a moment later John is stepping into the room, standing stiffly in his suit and tie. He stops short at the sight of them seated at the table, and Dean knows that his mother’s ‘talk’ likely had little effect.
I know it's been (nearly) two years
Out the corner of his eye he sees Charlie smirk, then she's elbowing him in the ribs and pointing toward the stone arch of the town hall.
“Heh, yeah, I noticed. Forgot how into it you can get when you working,” Dean paused to take a pull from his drink and Castiel’s eyes tracked the movement, “looks really good though.”
John frowns for a second. "Shame," he grunts out, and Dean thinks the conversation is over, but then he continues.
The alpha frowns, then holds up his index finger in the signal to wait and crouches down next to his duffel. A moment later he pulls out a small purple ornate box with delicate patterns of gold inlaid on the lid. He snaps open the box to reveal what are probably the fanciest chocolates Dean’s seen in his life.
Bobby nods grimly and they keep running. They reach the outside of the kitchen to find a small huddle of people now with John. And Castiel.
“We understand you are an adult Dean, and these were your decisions. But they are also damn stupid ones. What are you planning to do with a baby Dean? Or when we all found out about Castiel?” Mary seems to be asking for an actual answer, so Dean finds his voice even while keeping his head tucked low as if in preparation for a blow.
“Why don’t you wait ‘til you’ve sobered up, Dean,” Paul says, patting his arm and trying to walk away, but Dean pulls him back.
Castiel wonders briefly about the other demons, Azazel and Alastair and Meg, and whether they can find them in this little haven, and Dean must be able to read minds because only a few hours later, he says, “The other demons can’t find us here, in case you’re wondering. The whole place is warded. And they don’t like salt, so Dad had it enforced into the windowsills and doorways.”
me. How am I supposed to know what that means?”
“Don’t worry about it,” Kevin smiles at him. “It was painful for you, David, or, uh... Cas. It’s...” he squints at him. “It’s you, isn’t it?”
“You don’t want to stay here with me?” Azazel puts on a faux-offended voice. Castiel wants desperately to turn around-- the faceless voice is more terrifying than anything else-- but he follows Dean’s instructions.
“How sure are you?” Dean asks.
“You know, Cas, I thought you were smart,” Dean says. “But you never got this. You were my
“No, no, I do,” Dean leans across the bed to grab his phone and hand it to her. “I’d love your number, really, this was fun.”
Not only has he grown up a lot in four years, this is
“That’s the last box,” Sam says, shoving it into the backseat and slamming the door shut before anything has the opportunity to fall out.
David pouts until lunch, when Krissy and Aiden and Josephine show up with a huge birthday cake in tow. David forgives them for lying to him for thirteen years when they hand him all manner of knives and guns and weaponry for his future career in hunting.
Castiel jumps.
“That couch is calling my name,” Dean says, heading towards the living room, figuring he’ll drink until he passes out, but Castiel grabs his arm and tows him up the stairs until they’re both in the bedroom and Castiel is slipping out of his shirt.
“Her name is Melissa,” Sam says, and his cheeks color slightly when he says her name.   “It’s, um... it’s actually our third date.”
The vampires get the jump on him before he can even pull out his gun. They must have seen his car where he stashed it a mile or so back, and they snuck up on him from behind and knocked him out with a piece of farm equipment (he thinks it might have been a hoe... goddamnit) before stringing him up against the wall. He counts four or five of them, three guys and a couple girls. One girl licks up his neck while they’re binding his hands and whispers, “It’s a good thing I’m not hungry, baby, or I’d tear you apart.”
“Did you even sleep?” Dean grumbles, padding over to the coffeemaker and fiddling with the buttons.
“That’s very considerate of you,” he says darkly, yanking on his pants, then his shirt.
“Of course,” Castiel shakes his hand. Of course this is Sam. Dean called him “a floppy-haired, oversized puppy in human clothing” and that was exactly the picture standing before him. “Sam. I’ve heard so much about you.”
Castiel watches from a distance as Dean curls in on himself, his body convulsing. Castiel doesn’t know if he’s crying or just shaking with the shock, but he stays where he is and simply keeps watch.
Castiel smiles to himself. That sounds like Dean, his beautiful, weird, goofy Dean. The only terrible thing about remembering is that it makes him miss Dean with a constant emptiness that didn’t exist when he was just David, just the eighteen year old kid. The emptiness was there, he supposes; he just couldn’t name it. Now it has a name, and a face, and a date of expiration, when Cas dies and joins his friends, human soul and all, back in his old home.
“Goodnight, Dean,” Castiel sighs.
Warmth surges through Dean’s body, his bones, his organs, and he gulps fresh air. His vision clears and now he can see Castiel, human no more, his wings a shadow on the back wall of the shed.
“You hated it, Dean!” Sam argues, his eyes wide and practically tearful. “You told me. Every year, you got more and more tired. You just think it’s what you want because you’re bored.”
“How do you think I should kill him, Dean?” Alastair asks. “I could... cut him into tiny little pieces, starting with his feet? I could make him choke on his own tongue. I could open his chest and give you his heart.” He draws a long, thin finger down Dean’s cheek. “You see? I am a romantic.”
“I’m not going to lie to you,” Sam says, looking slightly embarrassed. “Dean gets around. He likes flirting and he likes sex. He’s kind of a slut. But as for your actual question,” he smiles genuinely at Castiel, “he’s never brought anyone up here before. And he’s never let anyone meet me or Dad.”
Sam smiles and leans back in to kiss her again.
Dean’s eyes narrow. “You wouldn’t.”
“What?” Dean feels like he’s been struck in the face. “Cas--?”
Castiel laughs lightly at that. He can’t wait to meet Sam. Dean talks about him almost constantly. He is slightly more hesitant about meeting John. Dean talks about his father like he’s his captain, and Castiel fears how this perfect world they’ve created will change when Dean’s father arrives.
He removes his hand from over Dean’s mouth, but he doesn’t lean back. They sit staring at each other for a moment.
“Hello? Hello? Is this the police?”
He trails off. Dean resists the urge to poke and prod, and waits patiently for Cas to finish.
“Fuck you,” Dean finally manages to wrench his arm from Castiel’s grip. “Get a fucking clue, Cas. I said I wanted you last night.”
Castiel doesn’t think. He just watches as his hand moves of its own accord, picks up a bottle of wine from the shelf next to him, and hurls it at the girl.
“Oh, sorry,” she says, pulling back and blushing. “I forgot you don’t know me like I know you. Well, I don’t know you, but we used to play when we were babies.”
“Would you stop it? I don’t care about that—”
“Well, too bad,” Sam answers.
In the moment where Alastair’s attention is partially diverted between the two of them, Dean whips his knife out from his coat and slices Alastair in the hand that’s gripping him around the throat. Alastair cries out, and with his focus redirected, Castiel falls from his tree and Dean slips out from underneath his arms.
There’s a buzzing in David’s ears and he feels like he’s not in control of his own voice when it emerges, low and terrible, from his throat. “
“No,” Dean growls, feebly trying to bat Castiel’s hands away. “I’m fine.”
“Okay, fine,” Dean laughs. “I just... I don’t get it, dude. Why read about sex when you can just... have it?”
And then, it’s over. David slumps to the ground, the chains on his arms and legs mysteriously broken. His nose is bleeding, and he’s pretty sure his ears are, too. Claire has blood all over her face, and he has no idea what’s left over from the witches and what’s due to whatever just happened, but Claire needs medical help immediately so he digs his phone out of his pocket and dials Garth.
Dean untangles himself from Sam and stomps up the stairs, fixated on getting his shower and then falling into bed and sleeping forever.
Dean glares at him for a full minute before rolling his eyes and muttering, “Yeah. Whatever. Just don’t boss me around and we’ll be fine.”
Dean’s eyes snap up to meet his brother’s and a guilty pit settles in his stomach when he sees that Sam actually looks
“I don’t take requests,” Castiel teases.
Dean and Sam live about a half hour away from campus. He wonders how Sam can come back to California. Back to Palo Alto, where he lost Jess. Back to San Francisco, where he lost Madison. Dean can’t bear to go back to the places where he’s lost people. It’s part of the reason he had to stop moving around: he’s lost people everywhere.
She gives him a sideways look. “Nah,” she says. “You’re special.”
It takes him exactly two hours to drag all his stuff up the two flights of stairs and unpack it all, and when he finishes, he stands in the center of the room and looks around himself appreciatively before hitting the papers.
Kevin and Krissy are immediately at his arms, holding out hands for him to take. He accepts them both, gripping their fingers tightly, and he nods. Charlie nods back, and he eyes flutter closed.
“You have grown,” he says finally, “into a wonderful, brave, strong woman. Your father would have been proud of you.”
“You’ve got such a long trip ahead of you,” Castiel says, stretching a little. “I thought you’d want to get an early start.”
They make it back to the cabin much later, where Sam is burying Azazel’s body.
“Don’t be mad, dude,” Dean says, a grin still plastered across his face. “I’m not making fun of you, I swear. It’s just-- you’re an angel, and--”
“I...” Dean doesn’t know what to say. “Yes?”
“Thank you,” Cas says. “I’m… glad to hear that.”
Castiel runs a hand over his face, and oh, shit, did he get that from Dean?
“All right,” he says. “I’ll admit, Ben and Aaron have been giving me pretty good feedback. And Claire says you’re a natural.” He picks up the phone, sighing. “Krissy is gonna kill me.”
“Oh,” Dean turns his head to stare at the ceiling. He tries every day not to think about, tries every day to pretend that it didn’t happen, but he can’t lie anymore. He can’t pretend that it isn’t why he’s so mopey, why he refuses to be a good boyfriend, why he can’t make it work with anyone anymore. “Yeah. It’s... it’s the South Dakota thing.”
That name again. It’s like a spark on a puddle of oil in his belly and suddenly he’s ignited. He can’t explain it, but that name, he can’t explain why, is
And Dean can’t stop himself, because it’s been six months of holding that coat tight to his chest when he moved his belongings from trunk to trunk, town to town, when he wanted to be holding something else, someone else, and seeing Cas wrapped up in his coat is like getting something back that was lost, so he surges forward and presses his lips to Castiel’s.
,” he mimics Dean’s earlier words, and then, with another whistle, he has the dogs leaping up and clambering over each other to get into the house.
“Oh, so you’re the new mechanic!” she throws back her head and laughs, revealing her white teeth again. “We’ve all theorized about you!”
“David, what do you know about angels?” he asks.
“Is it... is it a guy?”
But it does. And Dean can’t forget. He can’t move on.
He and Dean become sweetly, silently domestic. Dean makes eggs for breakfast, Castiel makes sandwiches for lunch, and they collaborate on dinner, standing side by side at the stove, frying meat and boiling vegetables. During the day, they laze around on the dock outside, Dean pretending to fish while he watches Castiel lie in the sun. At night, they read or play wordless card games. Dean loses millions of dollars of fake money to Castiel’s excellent poker face.
“Are we honestly back on that?” Dean groans, throwing back an ample amount of his whiskey.
Dean resists the urge to laugh hysterically.
Dean is getting worked up now.
want, what
And with that, Dean scrambles into the passenger seat and they’re off.
is born to that life, that’s Dad talking, and the fucking angels talking, like fucking fate or whatever! You don’t have to be a hunter!”
“I don’t,” Dean says, and then stops. Castiel can feel his jaw stiffen. “I don’t get to keep much, Cas. I’ve lost a lot of people. I don’t want to lose you.”
the only one. The dear departed would rise and have my head if I let you hunt at fourteen.”
Castiel sighs, downs the last inch of his drink, and grabs his coat, heading out of the bar and into the night. Dean follows him sullenly. They walk back to Castiel’s house, having left the car at home, and they’re both silent for about ten minutes before Dean explodes.
“Did you really just call me to tell me about a dream you had?”
Sam gives him a look that’s an odd mix of sympathy and respect.
Cas shushes him, but it’s gentle, his hand cupping Dean’s cheek.
,” Castiel says. “You are not allowed to hate me for this.”
Castiel supposes that his survival instincts could be chalked up to natural selection, but he’s almost surprised with how quickly he is able to adapt. Lighting a fire takes him forever, but he manages to coax a tiny flicker out of some dry sticks and leaves, just enough to roast his little fish on a sharp stick.
“We can and we are,” the man says.
He turns his head to kiss her chastely, but then turns back over to bury his head in the pillow.
Dean resists the urge to take his phone and hit himself repeatedly in the head with it. This is not how he wanted this conversation to start out.
“I’m so glad you’re all right,” Castiel snaps as Dean’s world goes dark again. “I want you to be in perfect health when I kill you.”
“Now it just feels like you’re mocking me,” he says, huffy, and Dean wipes his eyes on his sleeve.
Dean trails off and Castiel dares a glance at him. He looks lost.
“Whatever,” Dean flips his cards at Castiel and rolls over onto his back. “You’re too good at cards, dude, you’re gonna get a big head. Just wait until Sam gets here, he’ll cream you in poker.”
When Dean stalks into the house, exhausted and un-showered from three days of consistent travel, Sam practically leaps on him, demanding answers.
“I know it’s not what you want, Dean,” Castiel says tiredly. “But I don’t want to lock you up and I’m not going to let you kill yourself by hunting alone. So we’re hunting together.
“Okay,” he says. “Lemme me grab my coat.”
Dean recognizes a peace offering when he sees one, and he takes a forkful of cherry pie, pushing his own piece of apple towards Castiel. The smile Castiel gives him is small, but deeply genuine.
“I don’t want to scare you away, Cas,” Dean says, avoiding his eyes. “I don’t know what I would do if you went away and you thought I was some kind of--” He stops, but Castiel sees the word painted plainly across his face. Monster. “Everybody leaves me,” Dean sounds like he’s speaking more for himself now. “Everybody. And everybody will. And I’ll be alone.”
“Dean--”
He spends the next forty-five minutes staring at his phone, wondering if he should call Castiel and tell him he’s coming. But what would he say?
“Dean?”
“I was going to kill you quickly, Alastair,” Dean gasps, his eyes burning. “But if you hurt him, I will torture you for years and never let you die.”
It could also mean
“All over, actually,” Dean says, fiddling with the straw in his water. “I was born in Kansas, lived there ‘til I was four, but after that I don’t think I ever lived anywhere longer than a few months.”
“Sam, hold on,” he says. “I’m going to call my friend.”
Castiel, again, does not acquiesce. Dean gives him a look, and Castiel thinks for a moment that the other boy is going to come over and make him, but before he can, the door swings open again and Dean springs into a fighter’s stance.
“Call me when you get there, okay?”
And then he’s gone. Silence rings in his ears. Dean has no time to wonder whether that was
Now that John has arrived, the idyllic cabin has been transformed into a miniature magazine. There are guns on every surface: shotguns, rifles, and pistols, not to mention all the non-firearm weapons, like the enormous machete lying on the breakfast table. John, appearing to accept Castiel into his little army only on the condition he act like a solider, immediately sits him down next to Sam and gives brief instructions on how to pack shotgun shells with salt. Castiel follows his orders efficiently and correctly, and John looks mildly impressed before scowling and storming off.
“Good!” Castiel shouts, and he stomps back into the house, the screen door slamming behind him.
Dean’s face gets hot with embarrassment. It’s not up to these guys to protect him. Hell, he used to drink every day. He’s not a freaking
“Are you going to kiss me, Cas?” he asks, his voice higher-pitched than normal.
, and you know it
. John gives him a hearty clap on the shoulder that sends warmth through his entire body. They get into John’s truck and drive away, leaving Dean and Castiel standing in the driveway watching them go. As soon as they’re out of sight, Dean breaks away from him and heads towards his car.
“Fuck you,” he says aloud, and he’s not sure whether he’s saying it to Castiel or to himself.
Dean groans and rolls on top of him.
“I’ll make him understand,” are Dean’s last words before he falls asleep. “I promise.”
From very far away, Dean hears a crash, and yelling. The yelling doesn’t sound like English.
David squeezes his eyes shut against the hysteria building inside him.
“You,” he says, pointing a trembling finger at Dean. “You killed her.”
“I’m fine,” he says, his earlier fears of the day banished in a moment by the look on Dean’s face when Castiel cards fingers through his hair. “I caught a fish.”
June looks mildly grumpy from being woken up and she’s rubbing her eyes with one baby fist and clutching Sam’s collar with the other.
Dean wakes up just outside of Boise. It’s the end of the line for the train, so he has to get off and buy a new ticket. It’s going to take him about twenty hours to get from there to South Dakota, and he thinks longingly of his car, back in Palo Alto. He almost decides to go back and get it, but a little part of him knows that if he goes back to California, he’ll never leave again. He buys a ticket for Pierre, hoping he’ll be able to rent a car once he gets there.
“Sam,” Castiel says once the entire table is filled with completed shells. Sam turns to look at him and raises his eyebrows in response.
“Why don’t you tell us about it while I make your toast?” Melissa suggests, and then June is off on a rambling babble about lizards and candy and planes and Dean is suddenly hit with the realization that this is what Sam was thinking when he gave it all up; this is what they stopped hunting for. For eggs and coffee and kitchen tables and children who tug your hair with grubby fingers and tell you about their dreams.
Dean’s eyes feel like they’ve been glued shut. His fists clench in something soft... sheets? He’s in a bed. How did he get into a bed?
“Nerd,” Dean throws at him.
“Did not,” Dean mutters. His head is feeling slightly less achy, so he throws the covers off of himself and swings his legs around to the side of the bed.
He’s expecting her to kick him out of her bed then and there, and he would deserve it, but she just lays a hand on his arm.
“The angel Castiel did a lot for humanity,” Kevin continues. “And he... he fell in love with a human. And when that human died, Castiel decided that he wanted to have a human soul so that he and the human could be in Heaven together. So he pulled out his Grace and was reborn as a baby.”
“Yeah, it’s me,” Dean breathes, relieved.
“That’s not what I meant, Cas, I just-- I’m glad someone’s out there. Someone good. Since Sam and I-- well. I’m glad you’re helping people.”
He can forget about it. He can move on.
He stomps back towards the house to raid Castiel’s fridge and is almost to the door before he notices that his car is sitting in the driveway. He gapes at it while Castiel breezes past him, his lips hinting at a grin.
Castiel’s eyebrows go up even further.
Then they’re in the car, Castiel in the passenger seat, speeding down the highway. Dean puts on music again, but this time it doesn’t feel like the credits are rolling.
“I’m Sam,” he says, showing white teeth. “I’m Dean’s brother.”
“No,” John shakes his head. “Well, then
Please,” Sam is saying weakly. “He’s dying.”
.” He directs these last words at Aaron, who immediately sobers.
date with him, a few months ago.”
Castiel knows he’s blushing, so he turns his face away so Dean can’t see.
Dean has to concede him that point. He hadn’t handled that case as elegantly as he could have, but damn Cas if he thought he could get away with telling Dean what to do.
“You are,” Claire says softly. “You’re the angel Castiel. You were friends with Sam and Dean Winchester, and they asked us to take care of you when they passed. The bunker is theirs. We’ve been waiting to tell you since you first started remembering. We were just waiting for... a sign.” She reaches across the table to him. “Don’t you remember? They used to call you Cas. It’s short for Castiel.”
Have faith in your dreams and someday, the music played as the fireworks burst in the sky.
“Fine, hang on.” Dean turned and left the way he came, walking back through the lines of people until he found Cas waiting for him.
“That is why we came,” Cas said neutrally, looking at Dean’s hand on his shoulder longer than was probably necessary. Dean swallowed, still feeling the warmth from Cas’s shoulder in his hand as he pulled away.
“Give us a room with one queen,” he told the girl at the desk, adjusting the leather duffel bag on his shoulder. She was wearing a Nightmare Before Christmas Disneyland button on her suit jacket.
“What are you talking about, Sammy?” he had muttered, but Sam had just shaken his head and smiled.
“Hell yeah!” Dean replied, grabbing Cas’s arm and steering him towards the ride. It wasn’t necessary. Cas already knew where to go. But it was reason enough to touch him, and Dean was taking it.
The bustle around the park settled when the first colored lights projected onto the castle, and A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes started to play.
“Cas, man, it was a joke.”
Dean didn’t know what to do with himself. Part of him recoiled in horror from the offending ears, but then there was the tiny voice in the back of his mind. The one that said Cas thought about what you’d like. He got them for you special. Cas was looking at him with his crystal blue eyes wide, waiting for his decision.
“Shit,” Dean wipes the knife on the little girl’s coveralls and pockets it.
Somehow they make it off the floor onto the couch, and this time, Dean pins him down and presses hard into him, and Castiel knows why he and Dean work so well. It’s because they don’t need words; they never have. Dean is perfectly willing to give them, and now Castiel can give them back, two-fold, but they, the ‘us’, exists in the quiet way they wash dishes together, the silence of the dock as they fish. It’s now, when hands and tongues and lips say things that words can’t, speak feelings that don’t have words.
“Castiel,” barks a woman in a pinstripe suit who has ahold of one of Cas’ arms. “Now that you have been reunited with your grace, we are summoning you to stand trial in Heaven.”
“Hello!” the man calls (up close, he looks more like a boy). “You must be Castiel!”
“You got what you needed from me,” Dean says defiantly, his eyes meeting Castiel’s.
He stumbles out into a clearing, and a nasally voice says, “Nice of you to join us.”
, Cas. You want me gone? I’m gone. You never have to see me again. I won’t call. I won’t show up on your doorstep. Congratulations, I’m officially out of your hair.”
Dean isn’t sure what happens next, except that he suddenly can’t breathe. His clutch on Jude loosens, and he topples backwards onto his ass. Except he can’t feel it. He can’t really feel anything. It’s only when he looks down and sees the long blade protruding from his body that he realizes that his lungs are slowly filling with blood.
Garth sighs. “Sit down, buddy.”
“You told me I had to take you to the train station,” Paul says. “You wouldn’t let go of my arm.”
“Nice job,” Garth chuckles, as David beams at him, flushed with victory. “But you know vamps and weres are gonna have faster moves than this old man.”
He tosses the phone down on the seat next to him and floors it, the speedometer needle edging into 80. He only hopes he can get there in time.
There’s a few short staticky noises, like a phone is being passed from hand to hand, and there’s a long guttural sob.
“Castiel. It’s nice to see you.”
“Cas is weird,” Sam shrugs. “You know that. He asked you not to call, so don’t call.” He flicks his hair out of his eyes.
“That’s
Dean fixes Sam with the coldest glare he can manage.
Garth strokes the scratchy stubble on his chin. “You’ll be eighteen soon, technically, and we can set you up doing basically whatever you want. So read through all this crap, think it over, and let me know what you decide.” He places a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and grins. “You may have all your angelic knowledge, Cas, but you’re still human. And so we’re all going to be here to take care of you for as long as you want. Okay?”
Dean opens his mouth to respond, but the acid rises and before he knows it, he’s puking in the bushes like a frat kid after a beer bong.
are you?”
“Mmph,” Dean answers, and then he falls asleep.
There’s a hand on his shoulder, and there’s Sam, looking incredibly smug, and Dean tries to wipe what he knows is an terribly sappy look off his face.
Maybe it’s because Dean seems so much older than everyone else. He looks their age, certainly, but there’s something in his eyes that suggests maturity and age. Castiel thinks back to the way his knife pierced the back of that little girl and thinks that makes sense. To be able to stab a child in the back with such determination requires knowledge of true evil, the knowledge of what would come should the child be allowed to live.
Shockingly, Dean’s mishap doesn’t wreck the tenuous truce he and Castiel had built over the last few months, but he can feel Castiel looking at him carefully whenever they hunt together. He’s not sure entirely sure why, but it feels a little too close to pity for Dean’s taste, so he refuses to turn and meet Castiel’s gaze whenever he feels it, sure it will lead to more apologies and explanations of how Castiel can never be with him. Probably has to do with him being a repugnant human failure or something fun like that. Dean’s well aware he has nothing to give. He doesn’t need the reminder.
“Dean,” Cas tries to interrupt.
“Okay. Extremely drunk. And I bought a train ticket.”
“You have no idea,” Castiel hisses, and then he covers Dean’s mouth with his own.
Dean’s lips twitch in annoyance. Okay... that either means that there’s another hunter here or the
“Yes?”
In that moment, Dean is reminded that Castiel used to be a general. Despite the fact that Ingrid could smite both of them in two seconds without breaking a sweat, she defers to this instruction and nods, her chin at her chest in a slight approximation of a bow.
Garth shakes his head and chuckles, rubbing his scratchy face.
“That was out of line,” he says regretfully. “I’m sorry.”
“Paul told us how elusive and mysterious you are,” she says, narrowing her eyes at him playfully. “He thinks you’re a war veteran, but I think you were a spy for the government.”
upset.
“It should be fine,” Garth says.
with him, why he’s so insistent on hurting Castiel, even though they promised to forget about everything, including the night they spent together.
Garth immediately shakes his head. “No way,” he says. “You’re too young. Fourteen? No. Krissy would kill me, and she is
“So I’ll just drop you off at the city limits,” he says.
The pain reminds Dean of why he had passed out in the first place, and when his brain recalls the last thing he saw before his world went black, he almost pulls the sheets back over his head again. And has a horrible realization that he’s been in this bed before under very different circumstances.
Charlie nods. “When I was younger, I was one of the best computer and internet hackers of my generation,” she says, studying David’s face. “Turns out, hacking into a human brain follows many of the same principles.”
Dean and Castiel grab a pair of guns and troop outside to the backyard. There’s a whole mess of empty bottles in a heap, and Dean begins to line them up along the fence. Castiel swallows at how small the targets look from where he’s standing.
Castiel opens his eyes.
matter. We could ward you against them, we could fight them off. If it meant having your grace back, I mean… isn’t it worth it?”
“With who?”
They go to a diner to stuff themselves full of pie (the ultimate cure to almost getting torn apart by half-wolf monsters) and Castiel is examining the menu with squinty eyes when Dean blurts out, “I know I’ve been kind of a brat lately.”
“No, shit, that’s not what I meant. I meant... ah, fuck.”
“It’s what’s best,” Dean says. “You have school. Your family is probably worried about you.”
“Sounds good to me,” one of the male vampires grins and picks up the hoe again.
“That’s kind of a big deal, Sam,” Dean says.
“I thought--” Castiel runs a hand through his bed-head frantically, and Dean is seized by the terrifying, ridiculous urge to smooth it, settle his shaking fingers. “I thought that’s what you wanted, Dean!”
David tries to speak but nothing comes out. His throat is burning.
“What the fuck— get off!” Dean shouts, but Inias has a firm hold on him.
It’s not that he doesn’t like Gina (he’s been dating her for three months, to everyone’s delight, it would suck if he didn’t like her at least a little bit) but she doesn’t get him. And it’s not that she isn’t trying to-- there’s just a communication disconnect that neither of them have been able to breach.
Dean wants to punch him, then, because he tried to be a father once, and it ended in complete disaster. Castiel must get a look at his face, because he sighs.
“What happened last night?” Dean demands.
“Should this bother me more?” he asks Claire, her face lit up by the flame.
Castiel nods his head.
Castiel doesn’t answer. He chooses glaring as his mode of communication. Dean catches his eye and his face colors slightly.
“You too.”
Castiel doesn’t know what to do with his hands, but he pours himself into Dean like he’s been waiting for this moment forever (maybe he has) and when he pulls back after a few moments to rest his forehead against Dean’s, he’s smiling.
Instead, Castiel reads paperbacks, and he doesn’t talk.
“Something... incredible,” Claire says, smiling weakly at him.
“And all day I just wanted to come out here and find you and make sure you weren’t dead because God, Cas, I don’t want you to die, and I know you wouldn’t have died in less than twenty-four hours, my dad was wrong, you’re stronger than that, you’re not just a civilian, Cas, you’re... you’re awesome, and he was wrong about the other thing, too, Cas, that’s not what I think of you, you’re more to me than--”
Castiel whacks him on the shoulder.
“I’ve had worse, Cas,” Dean says, struggling to sit up in the bed, eyes searching the room for his shoes. “They whacked me a couple times with a hoe, big deal.”
Castiel stares helplessly at him, for a second, and then nods. There’s a rusty blue pickup in the yard, and when Castiel settles behind the wheel, Dean can only stare. When Castiel notices, he rolls his eyes.
He doesn’t do either of those things. He sneaks out, the sun barely light in the sky. He gets in the Impala and drives back to his apartment in Kansas, and he hides.
“Are you coming back?” Paul asks.
“Is it a girl?”
It misses, but the bottle does crash into the opposite wall, cabernet splattering against the paint like a mockery of a crime scene. The little girl’s eyes flick from the dripping wine to Castiel, who is still standing and staring at her with the romance novel in his hand.
Soon, they will be home.
That night, as Castiel lies in bed (without Dean, unfortunately-- John was serious about the separate beds thing, so Dean gave him a very thorough goodnight kiss before they retired to their rooms) he thinks about what will happen when the sun rises.
They drive to the Pete’s and get coffee and then they just tool up and down the length of the street, sitting in comfortable silence and ignoring the other drivers. When Dean finally drops Sam off at the house, he takes a deep breath, thinks about making a big speech, and settles for, “I’ll call you when I get there.”
"I’ll hold them off, I’ll hold them all off!” and Dean wants to say
Dean shoves this thought away with vehemence and punches his pillow into it’s proper shape. It doesn’t matter that he’s single again. It doesn’t change anything.
“FBI,” Dean says brusquely, flashing his badge at the sheriff. “Here to talk about the murder of Eloise Summers.”
“It’s nine,” Melissa says, checking the time on the microwave. “Time to wake up the Bug.”
Castiel tightens his grip on Dean’s arm. “You don’t?”
“I’m tired,” the other girl yawns. “Let’s decide what to do with him later.”
to be hilarious, watching an ex-angel of the Lord attempt to connect with a precocious and bossy little three-year-old. But when he sees Castiel smile gently and walk the dog up June’s arm, Dean feels a pull in his heart that is way,
Castiel nods quickly. He looks a little queasy, so Dean decides not to push until they’re checked into a motel room and have watched at least an hour of Jeopardy.
An hour later, the paramedics have been called, Nick has been rushed into an ambulance, and Jude is talking to the police, covered in a shock blanket. When Sam and Dean woke him after being exorcised, he hadn’t remembered much, only that Nick had some kind of psychotic break and tried to lure Dean to the house.
Castiel shuffles closer obediently. “Dean, what--?”
?” he practically screams.
The witches laugh from the altar where their herbs are burning, the spell clearly pulling all the blood from Claire’s body as David watches helplessly.
Dean laughs weakly, scratching the back of his head.
“You better call me back,” Sam warns before hanging up.
“Hey, it’s Dean. A demon has one of my friends. I told you about ‘em, Jude and Nick. The couple. The demon’s got Nick and he’s keeping Jude as a hostage, or bait or whatever to get me out there. I know you wouldn’t want me to, but I’m going. I have to try to save them. And I’d, uh… I’d appreciate if you would have my back. I have to do this, but I’ll feel better if you’re doing it with me.” He pauses. “Anyway, I don’t know when you’ll get this, but it’s uh,” he checks, “About two, on Saturday. I’ll be there by afternoon tomorrow.” He pauses again, knowing what he wants to say but not sure it’s the time to say it. “I… well. I hope I’ll see you there, Cas.”
There’s nothing local he can find (a couple weird deaths, but sometimes weird deaths are just that: weird) but when he branches out into more national papers he finds something good. With a big red pen, he circles
“To be honest, I got kind of drunk.”
Castiel eyes grow wide, answering Dean’s unspoken
“So, are we just not going to address the fact that you traveled thirty-six hours to have a glass of wine in my kitchen?” Castiel asks, and Dean swallows, the wine burning on the way down.
“Ask me to stay,” he orders.
“Those and plenty more,” Garth says gravely. “They’re all real. That’s what we’re doin’ here, kid.”
“Dean, don’t fight,” Castiel says in a soft voice. His lips are still red with Dean’s blood.
In school, no one speaks to him. He never had many friends, but the few students who had tried to befriend him to get closer to his older brothers have faded into the background since Michael, Gabriel, and Luke have all graduated. He belongs to no clubs, takes very few extracurriculars. His lab partner, Anna, is nice, and she tolerates him, but she has her own friends, and no one has much interest in the mute baby brother of the Novak family.
“Oh, I would,” Castiel says with a wicked smile.
His eyes fall on Claire, and he opens his mouth to speak, but nothing comes out.
Dean is looking at the road, so he probably can’t see Castiel’s mouth hanging open like a fish, but there’s a tiny smile on his face, so Castiel isn’t sure.
“No, sir,” Castiel says, quiet but firm. He’s completely terrified of this huge, bearded man but he refuses to be thought of as a powerless plaything. Even if that’s exactly what you are, a voice inside his head taunts.
“Did you talk to Cas?”
“Who was I gonna call?” Dean thunders.
He tries to stand, and immediately slumps, winded. It takes three tries to get out of bed, and then he has to hobble like an old man across the room and down the stairs, leaning on walls and doorways and bannisters for support.
They salt and burn the creature and hightail it out of town before anyone notices the smoke, and by the time they get back to Sioux Falls, it’s only nine and Dean is wide awake. On any other night, he would drive back to Kansas, to his own apartment, but something is holding him here tonight.
Dean’s just finishing up a story about a woman who’s car he fixed that has Castiel chuckling when he checks his watch.
Hours later, they’re curled up on the couch, limbs knotted. Castiel has a cramp in his leg and his pants are sticky and Dean is practically squashing him, but if he didn’t have to, he would never move again. Dean turns his head so his chin is on Castiel’s cheek, so he reaches up and kisses it. He wishes he could kiss every part of Dean, every freckle and scar, until he has them all memorized.
Dean remains obnoxiously belligerent towards Castiel during the first few months of their shiny new partnership; most conversations tend to end with bickering, Castiel swearing up and down that hunting alone is a quick way to an early grave, Dean yelling himself hoarse that he doesn’t need a babysitter. It isn’t until Castiel saves Dean from being sliced to ribbons by a particularly vicious werewolf that he has to grudgingly admit that having a partner again may not be the worst thing that’s ever happened to him.
Castiel sighs, not deeply, just a short little burst of air like he’s trying not to laugh.
“You’re right,” he says. “This isn’t fair to you. I’m sorry.”
“I slept enough,” Cas grunts, shaking bones out of a bag into a large wooden bowl. “I want to get this done.”
Dean opens his mouth, then closes it.
be really ready. It’s my job to get you prepared, and that’s gonna take you at least four more years, kid.”
Dean fishes in his pockets and finds a ticket stub.
Castiel isn’t used to speaking to anyone besides Dean (and even that was fairly recent) but Sam is absorbed in his work and doesn’t seem to need to fill the silence with chatter the way his brother does.
Castiel looks up from the counter and Dean swears there’s a hint of a smile on his face. “It’s a fairly new habit,” he says, handing one of the glasses to Dean. “But I find I enjoy it more than beer.”
Dean tries to fight back the wave of jealous nausea before it can hit him, but it crashes down with the weight of a thousand tons and he can almost feel the vibrations of
