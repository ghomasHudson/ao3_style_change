“Well I can't just turn it off and on like a tap,” was all John heard from his patient before Sherlock gave an indignant huff and turned his back to the doctor.
Two steaks cooked to perfection and a side of garlic potatoes with green beans had John salivating as he worked. The table was set and everything complete before he went to get Sherlock up. Time difference being what it was they were technically only having lunch now and Sherlock was sleeping away hours they'd already had. John walked in and called Sherlock's name to no avail, so he went to his bedside and clasped his shoulder, rocking him gently and marvelling as verdigris eyes fluttered opened at his touch and a smile etched it's way across a sleep eased face. "It's lunchtime and you haven't eaten in a while so, there's a plate for you on the table anyway if you feel up to it." Sherlock blinked and looked around, settling up on his elbows to get a better look at his surroundings. "I'd ask how I got here, but based on the fibre that matches your jumper that I left on the pillow I'd say you...carried me in. That's sufficiently embarrassing to start this holiday off. Sorry about that." John couldn't help but smile at the little blush on his cheeks. "It was my pleasure, and this steak will be too if you come out and eat it with me. I'll see you in there." He slipped out as Sherlock stretched long and lean across the bed.
They strode hand in hand into the dining room and made a beeline for their seats in the centre of the table, with Orabelle on the far and Mrs Hudson to Sherlock's left and Greg to John's right with Mycroft at the end, their table surveyed the room as a whole which meant John could have a peek at who was here. He needn't have worried about that because as soon as they sat down one table in particular made itself known to him. "Alright Three Continents?" a gruff voiced man called out to him and John searched for the face to match it. There was only one possible man but he could hardly believe he'd be there. "Bill bloody Murray what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be getting shot at somewhere? And Christ, Andy? Jill! Tom, Danny boy, Tony, Charlie, Major Sholto! Jesus you've brought the whole gang Murray! How the hell did you manage that!?" John guffawed as he embraced all but one man, who he saluted. Major Sholto obviously. Sherlock stood aside, wondering how on earth Mycroft had pulled this one.
The relieved smile on Mary's face was audible "Thanks Greg. Give them a bollicking about their phones from me while you're at it."
"No bother, you're not the first person to use my hand as a stress ball, I remember once while I was training to become a doctor I came across this heavily pregnant woman in the car park of a tesco and she was in labour in the front seat of her car, husband was in the shop grabbing dinner, and I had to just deliver it myself because there was no way she'd wait for an ambulance to arrive. So he comes out of the shop to find another man with his face under his wife's skirt and his hand in hers while she groans and I swear I've not seen anyone run that fast since my rugby days. Ended up with a broken finger from her, near heart attack from her bloke and down a jacket to their baby boy, Jonah." John chuckled at the memory and Sherlock relaxed back into his seat, beginning the story of  how he'd  solved his first case and revelling in John's laughter and obvious enjoyment of the story, of his story.
Curled up on the couch, his dressing-gown clad back to the world, was Sherlock. This position was one that could mean a couple of things, but usually (at least, as far as John had been able to establish any sort of connecting links between events) it meant Sherlock was feeling something, and feeling it keenly. It was less the act, and more the whole scene presented that troubled John.
Mycroft decided the first room on the left was as good as any and didn't hesitate to open the door. The sight that met him was unexpected to say the very least. Gregory was there, a shock in and of itself, and he hadn't seemed to notice Mycroft's presence at all as he was still singing to himself and nodding his head in time to what Mycroft guessed was something by Springsteen while he dried his hair roughly with a towel. He was not prepared for the impromptu spin that brought them face to face. "Mycroft!" Greg yelped, surprise evident even over the blush. "I thought… Luc said maybe Thursday… Eh… I'll just um… Should I…?" Greg stumbled over words, babbling nearly incoherently, but Mycroft caught the sentiment and rushed to intervene. "No! No. Gregory I… I have treated you in a manner that is truly abominable and I, I apologise. You do not deserve that. You deserve far better." Mycroft held what wanted to come next in his throat, even as Greg's face fell, he couldn't say it. Greg tried to gauge what was happening, but all his theories reached the same conclusion, that this was a variant of the 'it's not you it's me' conversation, and he didn't know what he was supposed to do because he'd not been punched in the gut in a while but if he could remember it correctly it felt a lot like this.
In fairness to Henry, it did take quite a lot to surprise Sherlock Holmes, and knocking him out entirely was, Sherlock would grudgingly admit, mildly impressive. Particularly if, and Sherlock rolled gently onto his other side to take make sure, he had managed to knock both himself and John out. Which he had, but while Sherlock knew that he had folded like a sheet of paper after a single well placed surprise blow, John had clearly put up more of a fight; the split lip and puffy eye he was sporting as he lay on the ground a few meters away a testament to that fact.
Sherlock smirked and tossed the sheaf of papers into his lap. “Firstly, whomever it was that took these needs to have their IQ tested.”
Holly had received a plane ticket with the destination empty from Mycroft, A gorgeous red sundress from Greg, a black phone case that said Don't talk to me on the back from John, a book on how to effectively kill a man with nothing but what you had in your pockets from Orabelle, and, surprisingly, a list of all the things Molly Hooper liked from Sherlock. She had opened those without ceremony and now sat back to watch as the others got to the gifts their partners had gotten for them. John had reached his first, his face a picture of domestic bliss as he read whatever was inscribed on a set of cufflinks. Next was Greg, whispering something she definitely didn't want to hear into Mycroft's ear as he pulled out a pocketwatch that's cover was scratched full of interconnecting circles and lines, then Mycroft's eyes warming as he opened a gold locket that looked as if Greg had designed it himself and found a photo of himself wrapped in Greg's arms, both of them smiling in their sleep against the backdrop of crisp white sheets. She had sent Greg that photo just for this, having been planning on keeping it for the wedding that would inevitably occur eventually. She turned to watch Sherlock, as did everyone else, open John's gift to him.
“What?” John asked carefully, aware that he might have asked a bit much of someone who'd just come out of a coma. Sherlock shrugged one shoulder and continued to stare at him like he was a specimen in a shadowbox.
"Want to sit down Mycroft?" he asked, bringing Mycroft back to reality. John was soaked already and so was the grass but Mycroft surprised even himself by sitting next to John against the stone. Carefully he balanced his umbrella so the three of them were under it's protection. "John I am truly sorry for everything. This was my fault, and mine alone." Mycroft said into the night, hearing rather than seeing the bottle tilt into John's mouth. "Yeah, it is. You had the chance to stop Moriarty but you didn't, you gave him everything he needed instead. But, Sherlock fell of his own volition and as much as I wish I could just blame you, there's enough to share between the three of us don't you think?" John asked seriously, shivering at the burn of the whiskey in his throat. Mycroft raised an eyebrow "Three of us?" he frowned, he could see his own responsibility, Sherlock's too, but John? What had he done that had lead to this? "He thought no one cared about him Mycroft. I called him a machine, one of the last things I said to him before he died reaffirmed a life time of conditioning to hate himself, and I, I was supposed to be his friend but I let him down. That's on me." John shook his head slowly and closed his eyes "It seems mad that he could see just about everything except how I felt about him."
Just before he sinks down, John looks up at Sherlock’s face and is floored. The man looks wrecked, head thrown back in ecstasy, chest heaving while he clutches desperately at the sheets. “If it is too much I can continue with my hand.”
Can't believe I just said that he thought to himself as he sat down at the table and began to eat. Sleep could wait until the sun had gone down, he was used to little rest and last night had refreshed him enough to make it through the day, if somewhat drowsily. Sherlock arrived and plonked himself into the chair across from John's with a sleepy smile and began to eat. It was these easy domestic moments where neither had to say a word, and both would be assured of the other's contentment that made their relationship so remarkable. It was nice to feel well fed again, he had to admit. Sherlock sat and watched as John began to clear up the kitchen, staring at him like he was the only interesting thing on the island. John was sure he was just thinking and looking at nothing, or perhaps he kept walking into the line of sight Sherlock was on.
That's when John kissed him. Really kissed him, applying the years of experience he'd gotten into hopefully giving Sherlock everything he deserved from the (most likely) first real time anyone had ever kissed him. He went full pelt, licking his way into Sherlock's mouth and taking, taking every little keen and whine and trying harder, learning what really made Sherlock cry out and shake and pressing those buttons over and over until Sherlock was a mess and only then would he back off, light brushes of his lips against jaw or neck lulled him back to a more manageable level before John ramped up the heat again. "Dear God John, touch me, anything, please, 'm so close." Sherlock moaned into his mouth, begging for release. Looking at him like this, he was everyone's fantasy partner, eager, vocal, responsive, it was hard to believe he was a virgin, how could anyone not want him? Sherlock writhed on his lap, trying to get some elusive friction to finally send him over the edge. John dipped a hand into his pants and stroked him once, twice, marveled at the slick glide of his hand, clearly Sherlock really was enjoying himself, three, four and Sherlock was done with a bellow, spurting into John's hand and collapsing back onto the bed with a euphoric face. His eyes began to droop shortly after and his attempt to reciprocate was gently declined in favor of sleep. "Stay" he murmured as he drifted and John was more than happy to oblige, right after he cleaned his hand. As much as he might love him, there was a line.
He nearly side a double take when he did step out. The aisle was a long white carpet spread between an avenue of trees that had created a tunnel, at either side of which the guests sat in rows, all able to see him clearly through the gaps. The petals scattered underfoot were a pale lavender, and the flower arrangements all along the pews were a mixture of white calla lilies, the dark blue orchids he had on his chest, and an assortment of what looked like bluebells, hydrangeas and babies breath to round it out.
Dumping their bags in the foyer, Greg and  John wandered from room to room, following the sound of the Holmes drawl into a beautiful open kitchen where both brothers were slathering sun cream on their faces, necks and any other exposed skin, which encompassed quite a bit as both were down to trousers only.
John felt his grip tightening around his wrist, his throat threatening to release a cry of pain. John wouldn't let himself do that. He was a soldier, something he repeated continually in his head as Moriarty crushed first his wrists and then punched him in the face. A soldier. "You're no fun at aaaallll John, Sherlock needs to discipline you better." Jim laughed, looking at his watch. His grin widened as he pushed an earpiece into John's ear and shoved his purple wrists into the coat sleeves. "You say whatever I tell you to. One word different and BOOM both of you will die!" Moriarty zipped up the jacket as Sherlock's voice rang out from the pool. Jim pushed John out of the cubicle and into the darkened pool.
of a brother that you're ill is like... I can't even think of an analogy for that, and I have an analogy for will vouch for me, that's how insane it is." Clara smirked apologetically and turned her appraisal on to Sherlock for the first time, looking him up and down carefully, scrutinizing every feature. Sherlock held his breath and waited for the inevitable judgement of freak to be expelled from her lips, but it never did. "I can see why you like him John. He's got great taste, and you know what I say about men with great taste" she wiggled her eyebrows at John as Sherlock just stared at her. John blushed deep red and nodded, a small grin on his face "Funnily enough Clar, I don't think anyone can see why I like him, let alone love him, but that's the beauty of it: you don't have to." John stared up at Sherlock, admiration glimmering in his eyes and Sherlock could not help but think of sunlight hitting the lake back at Mycroft's when he looked into them.
“Once the patient is stabilised, I want a tox screen ordered and we need his stomach pumped,” John spoke, checking on the patient’s wavering vitals. Wasting no time in trying to save this young man’s life, John set to work. It wasn't long before he had the patient wheeled into the ICU.
John's hands seemed magnetically attracted to Sherlock's curls, he couldn't seem not to touch them when they kissed, stroking and pulling and nuzzling into them with gentle hands and perfect pressure, as if his hands had always know where they were meant to be. Each curl was uniquely beautiful to him, and he had often said that he was jealous of the pillow that got to hold them all night when he couldn't.
In all his years of practising medicine, both in hospital and in the desert battlefields of Afghanistan, there had never been a single person who was ‘prepared’ for what happened to them or their spouse, friend, brother, mate. It didn't matter how light, or how devastating an injury was. No one is ever ready. John had learned that firsthand. Still, he didn't want to leave the man imagining all the terrible twisted things one's mind does when you're waiting. That's almost worse than the injury itself ever could be. John sat on the floor next to him.
Greg arrived back at the manor sweating steadily even with the cold and traipsed wearily in through the back door, wary of trecking old withering leaves into the foyer because he had told the cleaners Yolanda and Samuel that they may as well take a week off and the sweeping brush was hidden somewhere that he had yet to discover. His fingers burned slightly at the sudden transition from one extreme temperature to another, but he relished the feel of warm air on his skin again and it helped him to resolutely ignore the sick feeling in the pit of his stomach at the thought of his being forced to leave Mycroft. He gulped water straight from the tap before heading up to shower. All the bathrooms in Mycroft's house were top quality, ivory tiled utopias of fine design and equipped with large showers and the occasional bathtub. The shower could comfortably hold at least three people at a time and Greg snorted a laugh to himself when he tried to imagine Mycroft having a threesome. The man had been astounded that Greg had wanted him in the first place, he didn't seem like he'd be comfortable showing such vulnerability to two people, he was very sensitive about his body, though Greg could not fathom why, all that pale, freckled skin... There was that sick feeling again. Greg stepped into the spray and cleaned himself thoroughly, Mycroft had thought himself sly when he'd surreptitiously placed Greg's preffered brand of body wash into every single one. Once he was clean and clothed a bit more Greg dumped his sweaty clothes into the wash and put his earphones back in while he dried his hair with his towel and sang along quietly. "Can't start a fire, can't start a fire without a spark, this gun's for hire, even if we're just dancing in the dark" Greg bobbed along to the music and didn't notice when someone opened the door.
“Running will change some things. Whether I go to prison or not, for example. Do you know what would happen to someone like me in a prison? Listen to my voice. I would be torn apart. I won't let that happen.” Ricoletti countered, eyes jumping from side to side searching for some way of escaping. The man had unwittingly cornered himself by running onto a bridge in the first place; there are only three ways you can go: Forward, backward, or overboard.
"I'm going, I'm going, time is of the essence and all that, I just don't see why he would put them in--"
Mycroft was getting just a slight bit out of hand now. Fine, so the case was incredibly simple to figure out but that didn't give anyone the right to force him to do anything. He had been quite enjoying himself on skype to John, sitting naked at first and watching as John's eyes had widened and sharpened and he had blushed but smiled a lot too until Lestrade began to stride over and it was the fastest Sherlock had ever put a sheet around himself. This was an ingenious idea, having John tramp about the place while he sat at home waiting until the chase. Plus this way he could really ignore the boring ones because he'd never actually go to one again. But noooo Mycroft couldn't just leave them alone. Tosser Sherlock's mind supplied as he sat in the helicopter wearing only a sheet. The two guards that were with him had high security clearance and reeked of monarchy which had puzzled him for all of a millisecond when he realised the direction they were headed. Buckingham palace indeed. This could be very interesting.
Sherlock sighed loudly, throwing his phone across the room, causing John to open an eyelid slowly. "I'm not getting that back for you later" John mumbled, voice muffled by the pillow against his face. Sherlock looked at John for a second, giving him the we-both-know-that's-not-true face before falling back against him. "Not a case then?" John asked hopefully. He was knackered and quite frankly loathe to leave the new found comfort of Sherlock's bed. In a contrast to everywhere else the Sherlock-hurricane tore through his bedroom was immaculate, if a tad dark. John quite liked the colours, dark greys and black accented with purple and navy. It was almost like Sherlock wore his room around everyday.
"Why do I have grass in my hair? And what are all these scratch marks on my n- oh my. Gregory?" Greg held back his grin with his teeth as he buttoned up his shirt.
The Venetian air was balmy and hot, almost sweet to taste compared to the smog and rain tastes of London. John revelled in it as he stared out the window at the city below, seemingly frozen in time from the height that they were climbing.  He had to admit, when Mycroft had pulled a set of car keys out of his pocket he'd been more than a little surprised, and the sight of the generally chauffeured man driving was quite strange to him.
woman after she had dumped her boyfriend and realised her issues with Sherlock were really issues with herself, Mrs Hudson and her best friend comme neighbour Mrs Turner, and Michael's two sisters Kate and Lucy. While Michael was off in the town with his police mates, doing God knows what, the girls had free run of their house and were having a cocktail party simply because Sally had taken a course that month in bartending and wanted to put the skill to use. Mrs Hudson grinned at Molly and patted her hand, making Molly want to cry a bit. The old lady had become something of a mother figure to her and reminded her that her own parents would not have the chance to see her happy. "Thank you for keeping the party at home dear, my hip you know, can't handle the clubs like it used to" and Molly was laughing once again, revelling in the joy of her life and the company of good friends. The kitchen was abuzz with voices, and try though she may, Molly couldn't be everywhere at once. Eventually, having watched the girl fret at where she should go next, Sally took her arm and sat her down at the counter in between Anthea and Mrs Hudson. Pouring them all another drink ('None for me dear, Mrs Turner and I are going to head home now, want to look fresh in the morning') as the tamer guests began to take their leave and the clock chimed swiftly from two to three.
As for the medic well... He was a different story all together. His name was John and he was ex military, something that Sherlock's manager/brother Mycroft had decided was a bonus when he hired him. It was the only action he had undertaken Sherlock was remotely grateful for,the hiring of John Watson. The first time they met Sherlock had been feeling petulant, he didn't need a nursemaid and he wanted him gone, and the fastest way to make him go would be to deduce him. So he did, spouting about his injury in the war, psychosematic limp, his relationship with his family, financial security, everything he could see down to the last blow about his alcoholic brother. And when he was finished he waited for the yelling, sputtering, anger in general. John had stared open mouthed at him for a few moments and then broke the silence. "That, was brilliant. Truly amazing." Sherlock was completely shocked and his eyes flew to John's face, he was genuinely amazed. Sherlock smirked and began walking off "That's not what people usually say" John was at his side once more "What do they usually say?" Sherlock grinned emphatically "Piss off" and that was the first time he made John smile.
"Are you okay?" Sherlock asked, swallowing nervously. John knew what he meant. "I thought for a while there that I wasn't going to make it" Sherlock nodded. "So did I." John pulled him closer. "Yeah, well while I was thinking that I realised something else. I thought I wouldn't get a chance to tell you, you probably know already, but I just think you should hear it from me. I love you Sherlock." John said, confident. He didn't blush or giggle, simply smiled up at the man he loved. "I love you too John."
The low hum of buzzing had become so normal to them both that they had all but tuned it out at this stage. Then again, it might have been an indication that they were getting old and deaf in their later years. Of course the great Sherlock Holmes would never age in his mind, but his transport had betrayed him once more, showing the marks of his near eight decades of life in his still full head of suave silver curls and little trenches etched across his face. The detective was whirling about the sitting room with his violin the same way he had been when John had first gotten to know him. John himself was in the kitchen puttering about making tea, the familiar rhythm of what John had come to call 'Breakfast time sonata 4' serenading him as he worked.
"How long was I out?" John asked, running a quick assessment of his injuries as he registered the cold, and the swelling of his left brow that made frowning both an obstruction to his vision, and a literal pain in his face.
Oh Jesus... Don't think I can do it mate, most people don't check everywhere they go for secret mistletoe -G
Behind them, Mycroft pointedly cleared his throat. Evidently the elder sibling would never not be uncomfortable around prolonged displays of affection. “I, too, have a present for you, little brother. You see, I do not intrude on a person’s privacy without due reason.” With that, he stepped forward, and simply said, “St. Bart’s staff lounge, 9.30 o’clock this evening. He’s all yours.”
Rounding another corner, the two men end up back onto the streets, quiet now that London was settling down for the night. Sherlock followed the perpetrator as he sprinted across the street, heading towards Waterloo Bridge. He also appeared to be slowing down but was pressing on, keeping a steady distance between himself and the detective. Soon, although perhaps not soon enough, they found themselves on the bridge with the murderer coming to a halt halfway across and turning to face his pursuer.
"Greg? Sorry to bother you like this." She said, voice slightly strained "But you wouldn't happen to know where Sherlock and John have gotten to, would you?" Greg frowned. The duo hadn't been into the Yard yet today even though they had an active case.
Mycroft held out a hand as he walked, and Lucia dropped a file into it, tapping away on her phone as they moved into the control room. "They were last seen being bundled into a white transit van just outside the city, and I've got the delta team running through the footage as we speak to figure out their location now sir. Do you want me to call a car?"
John stared hard at himself in the mirror, carefully adjusting medals and flattening his beret. It'd been a while, a long while since he'd had occasion to wear the ensemble, not since he'd been awarded the medals pinned to his breast actually. That ceremony was one he remembered very little of, the agony of his shoulder, the grief of lost brothers, the emptiness of discharge honourable or otherwise. He hadn't cared what he looked like in the damned uniform, although he suspected the far away eyes and ashen skin would have made him look dead. Now however he cared a little. He'd be stood next to Sherlock who could make literally anything look good, and he'd undoubtedly be dressed to perfection by the infamous tailor that had made almost everything he wore (someone should give that man a medal because those shirts... ) so Sherlock would be the picturesque Armani model stood next to some middle aged guy who was getting a bit grey around the edges. Anyone who thought men didn't fret over their appearances was just not paying attention, and before their weddings? John chuckled to himself and was resigned to the fact that he'd look how he looked regardless of whether he liked it or not. Greg looked very dapper, almost George Clooney-esque with his hair being set off by a dark blue suit, white shirt with cufflinks that had what John could only assume was the Holmes crest engraved on them and a lightly silver tie.
you are like this, and all for me. My God Sherlock, you don't know what you do to me. Yes, that's it love, give in to it, you're perfect, absolutely perfect." Words streamed constantly from his mouth, encouragement, praise, worship all breathed into him while he could say nothing but John. Each small touch was a new ecstasy, and Sherlock whined when John's hand left him, flushed red and aching with the need for release. With strength Sherlock could not have hoped to posses at the moment, John lifted him and flipped them, settling Sherlock back into the chair and then dropping to his knees.
"Non, c'est assez utile pour le travail, j'ai travailé un fois en France à Rennes. Les gendarmes étè difficle, j'ai fondé que un gendarme qui s'appele Christophe étè le meurtrier. Je pense ils me n'aime pas." (No, it's kind of usefull for the work, I worked once in Rennes. The police were difficult, I discovered that a police officer named Christophe was the murderer. I don't think they like me.) John was gaping, firstly because he was still following the conversation, and secondly because if it were possible Sherlock sounded even better while speaking French. Mrs Hudson clearly had no idea what they were saying so John quickly engaged her in conversation, still keeping one ear in the one happening next to him. "J'aime lui, bien sur, mais tu es positif que ce décision est bon pour vous? C'était une grand surprise" )I like him, of course, but are you positivethat this decision is right for you? It was a big surprise) She whispered, she was happy for them, having been positive that there wouldn't be anyone in her youngest son's life at all, but worried none the less. Marriage was a huge step after all. Sherlock understood her wariness, it was a surprise to him as well, but he wanted everyone to know that John was his to have for as long as humanly possible. "Je suis vraiment sur Maman, Il est le person seul dans l'universe pour moi. Il est le mien et Je suis le sien." (I'm truly sure mum, he's the only person in the universe for me. He is mine and I am his.) John looked away just in time to avoid catching Sherlock's eye when he looked over and smiled at him. "Je suis content pour vous" ( I'm happy for you) she added, giving his arm a quick squeeze "Merci Maman, Je suis content aussi." (Thank you, I'm happy too)
Mary let out a chuckle. "Not wrong per say... Turns out this baby got it's patience from Sherlock because I'm in labour." Greg gasped, suddenly panicking. This was wrong, the due date wasn't for over a week.
It'll get better soon, pinky promise ;) and thank you everyone who've been following our fic, we appreciate your patience and support.
like him to find his soulmate in the bloody A&E? He’d been drawn to Sherlock from that first moment, but what the hell was he supposed to do with the knowledge that they might be (probably were) soulmates?
All the tropes  (Pin up John, with tattoos, Papa Greg being proper friends with Sherlock, John being all body confident, Lestrade - and everyone else - getting hot and bothered by him...) Also! I'm on Tumblr, and I'd love to hear/see any of you there, my URL is 'imakemyselflol' so if you do come along be sure to drop me a line! Ttyl ~S
"No, why?" John shook his head and took another spoonful of whatever it was they were supposedly eating into his mouth.
really and the nurses had given him a round of sympathetic smiles at his optimism) there was any next of kin to be found.
During one of those times, he had awoken to a familiar silhouette hovering just outside his hospital room door. He could just make out the shadow of a limb stretched out as if to push the door open but the hand and its owner would bade a hasty retreat once Sherlock’s breaths had evened out.
“So if you're as much as a genius as I think you are, and trust me I know if your deduction about me when we first met was anything to go by -- then how did you manage to land yourself in this state? Forgive me if I can't quite figure out how an intelligent man like you could be stuck in hospital from a near-fatal overdose.” John had at this point pulled up a chair and settled in at Sherlock's bedside.
you two are, I was wondering when you would return Mr Holmes, after one of your little workers came running to say that you'd need a bath run and then scattered I was left quite worried that the hot water would go to waste. Still, not to worry now, it's all set up in the usual spot, tea as well Mr Watson, Just this once mind you, I'm not your housekeeper." Mrs Hudson exclaimed as soon as the front door opened and she chivvyed both men upstairs to their flat instantly and was gone downstairs before either had a chance to thank her. The bath, tin bright and water steaming sat carefully in front of the fire and Watson, seeing tea laid waiting for him in the kitchen made a beeline for it while he could hear the sound of buttons being undone behind him. Once the sound of water sloshing began he felt he could eat comfortably, although the feeling of being watched lingered, he did not dare turn around.
“Right. Thanks Paula, I'll go and see what I can do.” He turned to walk away and heard her shout after him.
Lestrade nodded his agreement “It’s to Pentonville and then abed with me, Dr Watson, this business has taken enough of the night. I assume we’ll be seeing this one in the Strand?”
John rolled his eyes and continued, though he couldn't help but amend his words. “OK, Sherlock then, amazing you may well be: invincible you are not. I can't let you go home without doing a full work up, not to mention the reason you were brought for in the first place. You came in on the verge of death, Sherlock, and you're mistaken if you think I'd let you off so soon. I'm here to help you but it will not speed up your getting out of here if you continue berating my staff like that.” John was used to difficult patients but this one came across a wee bit eccentric; he had to tread carefully with Sherlock.
John pushed through the crowd, garnering horrified looks as they watched who they believed to be the help traipse in the midst of the Holmes family. The audacity! Eventually he reached the clear space, and by extension Sherlock, who's whole body relaxed just a bit as he approached. "There you are love, I was wondering where you'd gone" John said with his signature smile and twined his fingers with Sherlock's. "I was just getting tea, would you like to join me?" Sherlock's lip twitched at the side and John counted even that small movement as a massive victory. "You could just call for tea you know John, it's expected behaviour." Sherlock explained as the walked hand in hand through the path that had formed for them in the middle of the gaping mass. John laughed, a raw infectious sound that Sherlock couldn't help but chuckle after. "If a man can't make his own tea he's not fit to call himself an Englishman" he said seriously, locking eyes with Sherlock and setting them both off again. They completely ignored the rapid whispering that filled the room as they closed the door behind them.
Greg don't look surprised, or at me, but Sherlock and I have a plan to get you your Christmas present-J
Greg dropped the tablets into the awaiting hand when Mycroft reached him and lead the way down the hall to the bathroom. Yolanda and Samuel would be giving them a bollicking when they came to find about five different types of glitter, some confetti, and a blue French horn they'd... acquired somewhere along the way.
, that’s all there is to it. When Sherlock had put up his shields and deduced John all the way to his toes that first meeting, the doctor did not make so much as a twitch. He certainly did not mouth Sherlock off and flip him the middle finger or run off crying hysterically like at least 90% of the souls who were unfortunate enough to come his way in the past.
Lestrade was unsurprised. He'd worked with Sherlock long enough to appreciate his genius and to know that these were not insults. "Alright we'll send a team to arrest him." John had been leaning against the door the whole time, watching. He was prepared when Sherlock spun around quickly and rushed out, coat swirling behind him. "Oh and Lestrade, do tell my brother that we say hello." That was one John had not been expecting. He had to run after Sherlock into the street and only managed to get his breath back when they sat down in the taxi.
He'd just finished up clearing his desk a bit when there was a sharp rap on the door that he'd gotten so familiar with he didn't even bother inviting them in he just hopped up and wrapped them in a hug. "How are you then…?" Lucia smirked "Holly this time Greg" he laughed "Festive." Ignoring the stares the two of them were getting, Greg held back the urge to skip along excitedly as they made their way out to the car that held Mycroft. Lucia had been busy, astoundingly so, the amount of work she had to do had meant she hadn't seen Greg at all since sending Mycroft home from Vienna. Even now she was tapping away at her blackberry, scheduling, checking the news, spying and hacking with ease. "Busy I take it then Hols?" Lucia laughed, a high tinkle that never failed to make Greg smile too. No matter what name she chose, Greg would abbreviate it, just to be contrary. "Quite. The more time he spends at home, the more time he doesn't spend on the phone with the government in Uzbekistan. Not that I begrudge him, anyone, that, just, piles the work up a bit more. It'll be fine again after the holidays, he always gets antsy for work during the holidays." Greg nodded along seriously. Mycroft was an important man, Sherlock hadn't been lying all those times he called him the British government, Secret Service and CIA on a freelance basis and his work was his life. No one else in the world could do what he does. The lift chimed and the pair stepped out talking of lighter things, and generally messing about as friends do. Stepping out into the open air was like a slap in the face. "Christ it's freezing!" Greg cursed and pushed forward through the snow to the idling car that awaited them. "Greg?" Lucia chirped. "Yeah Lu?" "Sherlock and John are in the car." He whipped round and to her credit he mused, she had the decency to look mildly ashamed that she'd kept that quiet until now. He loved both men obviously, but journey's with them were hellish enough when they were off to a crime scene, Which was why he was more than happy when the detective duo came along after him. Sighing, Greg tried to console himself with the knowledge that Mycroft was in there too. His eyes widened as the reality of that statement, Sherlock and Mycroft in a confined space, dawned on him. Dear God this was probably already a minefield. However, he wasn't made a DI for nothing, so Greg opened the side door of the 4x4 and his jaw nearly dropped at the sight of a sleeping Sherlock and a relaxed Mycroft. John grinned at him and gestured to the curly head in his lap. " Sleeping tabs" he whispered "he'll be out until we get there." "Dr Watson here endeavoured to make this trip a bearable one for us all." Mycroft added and pursed his lips in the way that Greg knew meant he was holding in a smile. Greg and Lucia clambered in and soon they were whizzing along the roads, somehow avoiding the worst of the traffic.
He had seemed most upset, most riled by (and this was only slightly surprising) the idea that Sherlock was in the hospital in the first place, that in his … pastime he was somehow diminishing his own worth. But why should Sherlock's habits bother him so severely? He’d known what they were before he'd known Sherlock's name, to be upset by them now was frankly absurd and more than a little bit confusing. Why did he
The dwindling light only added to the atmosphere of the whole thing, the only light was from the tip of his cigarette. The ash would be enough to identify him, so he tipped it into his pocket. The spotlight was a nice touch, he had to admit that it gave the whole show an audience, even if it wasn't the right kind. He giggled,pouring the sand at a steady pace. The funnel had been a stroke of genius, there was no mess left if he used that. The worst bit came after, resewing the top layer of skin and muscle back to the rest was time consuming, but necessary for the full enjoyment. That way the uniforms stayed clean. Still giggling in a high pitched voice he dragged over the new sewing machine he had made. It whirred and hissed as it punctured the sinewy muscle with thread. While that did it's job he pressed the jacket and trousers again, pinning the medals to it and prepared the scaffolding for the main event. A single beep broke the heavy silence. It was pulled the clothes onto the captain with practiced hands, and the knots he tied were stronger than ever. His favourite part had arrived. Flicking the camera on he began the show, pulling the strings, making the captain move and dance, his body limp as a ragdoll but for the addition of sand. He moved in grotesque jerks, mouth sewn shut, eyes wide open as they had been at the moment he had died. When he was finished he tossed the body back on the ground, methodically stripping and draining it of sand. Satisfied that the outcome he wanted would be achieved by this, he walked out, into the black night and faded once more into the shadows.
"Lestrade... he does want you. Whatever he said to the contrary is a lie even Anderson could see through. I would know." Greg cleared his throat awkwardly, it was one thing to know objectively that Sherlock would always see everything you wished he wouldn't, it was entirely another for him to acknowledge that he knew you oggled his brother."So. You will fix this with John right? It won't be easy, you've been a right tit to him, but you need him. He makes you better. Every day. I'll see you in the morning Sherlock, try and get some sleep." Sherlock muttered something that sounded to Greg a lot like he said "Goodnight goldfish" but he couldn't quite be sure. He didn't really care, he was bloody tired and he just wanted to phone buzzed one last time against his thigh.
Harry Watson awoke to the blurry vision of her doctor staring down at her, and no one else. She didn't have to be a genius to know what that meant. "Tell me then." she rasped out, her throat was dry and it felt as if she'd swallowed nails. "When we opened Ms. Watson, we got a much clearer view of the damage than we did with the CT and MRI. It became apparent that performing the histerectomy would have little effect except to buy some time for you. The cancer has spread at an alarming rate, your kidneys, liver, bowel, and lungs have all been compromised, the damage is irreparable. Surgically, there's nothing else we can do." Harry took a few minutes to wrap her head around this, still reeling from surgery and cloudy with drugs, she really just wanted to know. "How long?" The doctor sighed and looked reluctant to say anything. "That bad huh?" Harry said, trying for levity. "A couple of months is the best we can hope for. I'll have someone come to talk to you about end of life care later on. Would you like me to tell your next of kin?" Harry scrambled to sit up but hissed in pain, forgetting in her panic the surgery she'd just endured for no reason. "
He threw some money at the driver before acknowledging that anyone else was present. Donovan's jaw was on through floor next to Anderson's. Greg on the other hand just chuckled to himself before turning to his colleagues and demanding that they pay him ten pounds. "That was remarkable! If I'd known that would silence Anderson and Donovan I would have probably done it before!" Sherlock quipped as they hurried into the scene.
John wanted to shake himself, to wrack his brains and find even a twelfth of the intelligence Sherlock possessed so he might understand what was going on, anything to fix this. He had nothing, and he still couldn't see, couldn't use his best sense to try and read the situation. Maybe the light would help. The switch was a string pull system that would require him to walk a little way into the shelving units but at this stage, he was desperate. “I'm just going to turn on the lights alright? Just, just wait a second for me to turn on the lights.”
His lip quivered again. "I know the signs when I see them, and now I know them in myself. Its been coming on for a while now. I feel weak John, and I don't... I couldn't find a way to tell you until now." John was silent. Utterly and completely silent on the floor, Sherlock wouldn't have known if John had been breathing if he couldn't physically feel the chest expanding against his knees. "John I..." A gnarled hand rose to silence him. "How do you... how do you want to spend the rest of the day?" Sherlock hadn't expected that at all, he'd thought there'd be a lot more shouting at least. But that was John, still surprising even now, him half a century later. "I want to be alone I think..." John froze for half a second and Sherlock watched the strife cross his face before it disappeared into soldier John's stoic mask. He began to stand up and suddenly Sherlock understood. "No!" He reached out and grabbed John's wrist "I meant alone... together. I always mean you and I when I say alone." John sank back to the ground, and, just for a moment, they didn't have to pretend (as they were going to for the rest of the too short hours they had left ) that everything was going to be ok. The moment passed as all moments do and John was a soldier again. "What do you want to start with?"
"Come on, You can sleep in my room, I have a few bits to do before bed anyway." Gratefully John rose and Greg led him towards the side door of the inn, bypassing the common room and leading straight to the stairs. He handed John the key to the room and sent him off before bolstering himself to talk with Sherlock. A low buzz from his phone made him pause and reach into his pocket.
It arrived almost five days later, a wooden crate that looked, as per request, deceptively like it contained a live animal. That was why, when he signed for the package, John didn't dare open it, fearing whatever venomous creature would lie inside. That was exactly what Sherlock had hoped would happen because if he had have opened it, well firstly a dead cobra would have met him, but beneath that was a box and contained within that box were two items that Sherlock was very very pleased with. John was very pleased at the moment that Sherlock didn't pay attention to his comings and jewelers appointment had gone very well, Sherlock had actually planned to go to the morgue anyway and John has been there and back before Sherlock had even thought about going home. It had been pretty quick, mainly because he knew precisely what he wanted. Well mostly, the ring had been a difficult enough decision but the other thing, that had been easy.
Holmes rose abruptly, walking over to the fire, and staring into its depths. “It is somewhat connected to that, though it is not about Mr Thompson, he was quite dull, more's the pity.”
Sherlock pressed closer still and he met John's eyes. They were blazing, pupils eclipsing all but the tiniest ring of blue. John's lips were on his in a heartbeat, and Sherlock was melting into him, hands straying, heart pounding, limbs all entirely focused on this new, lust filled John almost forgot that they were wearing the costumes for a reason, so blank had John rendered his mind. Sherlock was surprised to find he had a physical reaction to John's every move, and having the constraining jodphurs on was the only reason he remembered the case, because it had been more than a little difficult to get them off. He broke away from John, looking a little dazed. "Apparently I have a weakness for consulting cowboy detectives" John breathed into him as they tried to compose themselves. There was always after the case, plus it was added incentive to finish quickly.
"Maybe we should take a break? Let their voices rest until the show tonight, I mean, I know you had other plans besides spending your last day here in the theatre right Irene?" Sherlock asked innocently, mouth twitching at the crazed look Irene shot back at him before she took a second to breathe. He knew well enough that she had to pack still and that she was desperate to watch the capture the flag game, plus she had a very important appointment at the lake front to prepare for and him giving her an out, for whatever reason, was good enough for her.
Sherlock picked up the navy material and smirked slightly, it was the same exact pigment as his own, which was what he had been going for. The scarf was soft and durable, and Sherlock could see John wearing it and thinking of him. On the inside neck so as not to be ostentatious, were the letters JHWH monogrammed in an even darker blue. John Hamish Watson Holmes did have a nice ring to it after all. He hoped John would like it, it was a private but public display of his affection for the man and John would appreciate the sentiment. His scarf was the one thing he never left without, it was a comfort and a constant in his life, and he was bestowing that onto John. Sherlock wrapped the scarf around his neck and went on with his day, experimenting with the cobra venom that he had extracted from his decoy and some arms he'd gotten from Molly. When he had finished he removed the scarf, knowing that it would smell like him now and put it back into the box, eyes locking on to the ring box he'd cast aside earlier.
Sherlock sealed the melody into an envelope and left it on the stand, a gift, a goodbye. Leaving, he spared John one last look, drinking him in. Yes, anything for you John, anything at all.
"John?" he whispered, gulping down something that sounded like fear. It was written all over his face. He had his arms up, covering his chest,  defending himself. "Mmm?" John grunted back, still drowsy. "John, I... I have realised that... Its about time I told you that I have feelings for you." John was stunned. For one that Sherlock had said anything at all, the man was notoriously inept at dealing with situations involving any sort of feelings, especially his own but mainly because he felt the same way John did. Sherlock took the prolonged silence to mean rejection and blushed  deeply, hoping that he hadn't just lost his one and only friend, and the man he loved. He made to leave Johns bed, feeling more empty than he had ever felt before. He didn't want to be alone. He needed his John.
When he had opened them, John had been quite nervous of his reaction – after all, their attitude at that stage had been more suited to walking across a minefield than living together again - but the genuine warmth that had lit Sherlock’s eyes had acted like a revelation and slowly but surely, they had gotten back to the way things had been before.
He huffed a laugh and pocketed the phone, wondering what delightful tidbit of information about the frankly scarring sexual escapades those two engaged in would assault his senses first.
Greg looked scandalized and genuinely upset and in that moment Holly was so happy that Mycroft had found someone who'd been raised without the Holmes values to protect any of their future offspring from this fate.
Having caught only glimpses as Sherlock flicked through, even Mycroft couldn't say precisely what lay within the confines of those pages, but the look in his brother's eyes was enough to tell their story a thousand times over. Sherlock nuzzled his face into John's leg like an affection starved feline, and the slow stroke through Sherlock's curls that John had started kept all eyes on the pair. It was, to Greg at least, a show of intimacy that they were clearly intruding on. He coughed. "Tea anyone?"
"Whatever you need Sherlock. Do you want to go now? You look wrecked to be honest." And now that he was looking for it, it was true. The dark circles, wild eyes, gaunt face, deathly pallour, he was a dead man walking at this stage. Sherlock's audible sigh of relief was encouraging, and the fact that he stood up and headed for his room was as good a response as any, so John followed.
John opened his eyes to a head of silver hair that abruptly ruined his pleasant mood by reminding him what had happened with Sherlock last night. It was still early, and if he wasn't working with Sherlock he really had nothing to do. Luckily John was experienced in having nothing to do, after he'd come home and lived in that god awful bedsit there had been ample time alone to figure something out. In fact it was thanks to one of his cures for boredom that he'd been introduced to Sherlock in the first place. A walk around Dartmoor (except Dewers hollow) would clear his head and give him something to bloody do. Quietly as he could John rolled out of bed and left Greg to his sleep, he wasn't sure what time he'd made it upstairs but it had been very late indeed because he'd had a bit of trouble sleeping but had been out cold by the time Greg reappeared.
"John" Sherlock groaned and John looked wickedly up at him and hummed, sending sparks through Sherlock's entire body. John's jaw ached but he was damned if he was going to stop now, not when he had the velvet heat of Sherlock on his tongue, the sound of his appreciation loud and glorious as his rumpled curls and sweat slick skin. He'd forgone hesitance, and simply done what felt the best to him, and whatever got Sherlock to moan the loudest. His own pleasure demanded to be attended to and his trousers were open, his hand flying as he sucked and licked, revelling in the fluid that leaked in earnest into his mouth and hand. He felt it when Sherlock grew impossibly harder against his tongue and knew that this was it. He stared up at his face and waited for rapture to take it, hand and mouth both moving faster in anticipation.
Sherlock carefully stepped out of the trainers and opened his eyes, finding himself back in the now. He hadn't really needed to see more, "I said don't make people into heroes didn't I?" the low croon of it into John's ear was enough to make him want to tear the shoes off, his ears off. The only real question was just how long it had been since he'd (not you Sherlock not you) done this unforgivable thing. Could he leave the flat without John knowing? Was he even still here? The contrast between Sherlock now and this other man was so great it was hard for him to believe they could coexist in his one body, especially now that the acts of violence he committed while locked in his own mind were so devastating in their affects. Perhaps mother had been right in thinking a mental institution was the place for him. He didn't want to hurt anyone.
I’m sorry this took so long. It’s been just... a Lot. But I told myself I would finish this series no matter how long it took, and here I am. To anyone who read these and liked them and commented and bookmarked and just generally was here - Thank You. Looking back on them now, I’m proud of the growth each new story gave to me. Even the bad ones. This was something that meant a lot to me to do and I’ll always be proud that I did it. Sorry it took so long. All my love - S
Deep in thought, Sherlock did not notice when Doctor Stamford came in, clipboard in hand. “How are we doing today, Mr Holmes?” he asked, drifting over to the monitors on Sherlock's left to make notes.
Ripping open the bag and pulling on his costume, John had to admit that Sherlock had great taste. It was a simple costume, tight fitting navy suit pants, a white and navy striped t-shirt that hugged the muscles in his biceps and a white captains hat , all of which had a small gold anchor embroidered on them somewhere. John was pretty snug in it, but that was the point, after all he was wearing a very large amount of clothing.
A/n (before the fic? *Gasp*) Im going to do an AU - soulmate!verse just to try it on for size. I know exactly nothing about doing properly AU so sorry for the shambles that this will probably be
"But why? I don't understand Mycroft! It's not like he moved out, I can tell that he's here for a few hours at a time but then he leaves before I get back or wake up. It's not exactly as if I know what I did, though most times I don't..." Mycroft sat silent in the armchair, tapping his umbrella against the floorboards and waiting for Sherlock to finish pacing. "Sherlock have you possibly considered that it is not you who has done something?" Sherlock twirled around "A new girlfriend? But surely he would have worn nicer clothes and smelled less like the clinic" Mycroft sighed. "I meant that he has done something, although I dare say that Sarah woman played her part... You must have figured it out by now surely." Sherlock wracked his brain but nothing came. He looked so lost, and with what was coming next Mycroft decided to take pity on him, just this once. "Sherlock sit down. From what my sources can gather two weeks ago Sarah got tired of watching idly by while John was oblivious to certain facts, so she had a long discussion with him about it and apparently John reached the desired conclusion, although he didn't look pleased, more ill than anything else" Mycroft drawled at the befuddled detective. "What could John have been oblivious about that Sarah would have noticed?"
Sherlock raised his eyes to focus on the doctor's face. He took the chance to map out the frown lines on John's forehead, the crinkles at the corners of his eyes. In the dim lighting of the room, Sherlock could read everything about John and yet still not make sense of the man before him.
He had to leave and do the job himself, besides, what was there keeping him here? Sherlock looked around the sparse room with a softer gaze than he would usually have allowed himself; over there John had given him his phone, he'd sat in that chair, run his hands over Sherlock's forehead on that pillow. Tiny moments that Sherlock would never forget, but probably with little meaning for the good doctor. No, he resolved, leaving was the best thing for all of them. He'd be able to get back to The Work and John could go on with his other patients as if Sherlock, and whatever it was that he had done to upset him, had never existed.
“There you go. Take care not to move too much, mind you,” John said, gathering the remnants of the bandage and standing up, getting ready to leave. “There’s only so much morphine I’m allowed to give you, you know.”
, again, Sherlock, but I wish you could have done so without having to resort to drugs again. I honestly thought we were over that. That you were in complete control of your transport, as you never fail to remind us constantly.”
"I... If you are not... I would ask that you say nothing... you would have been the first so no crime has technically been committed and... Yes. Well. I apologize for this grievous lapse in judgement, please excuse me." That was the moment John stopped debating, stopped caring whether this would end in the ruination of them both for the terrible sin of loving each other. When he moved to turn away, to go and leave this behind for good, John reached out and lay his hand on his arm, softly, softly turning him back to face him.
"If you want one, take one." And he did, leaning in with lips and tongue and a smile on his face that never failed to make Sherlock's heart race in his chest. Soft caresses were quickly growing in heat as John took him to pieces with just a whisper of lips and a smile.
It wasn't as if he had anyone to ask about what to do. Mycroft was a no go obviously, and Mrs Hudson would be too squealy for a serious conversation to take place. That left one option only and he didn't like it one bit. Molly was doing it again, watching him. She had stopped for a while, and Sherlock had hoped that it was for good but alas there she was again, lurking in the doorway. "Molly if you're coming in come in, you're wasting valuable oxygen in both rooms if you simply stand there between the two." He was feeling skittish, it seemed a bit redundant to get dating advice from someone who was always single but he was clutching at straws here. The internet had been no help, with 50/50 odds on positive outcomes. Unfortunately the blabbering woman before him was his last chance. Just perfect.
Sherlock wanted a lot of things. He wanted Mycroft to stop spying on him via cctv, wanted Lestrade to fire Anderson and Donovan preferably in front of him, wanted the criminals of London to be a bit more inventive, wanted Mrs. Hudson to accept that she was in fact his housekeeper. All of those he would sacrifice however if he could have one thing. John. It was an alien sensation for him he would admit but he definitely knew what it meant. John was perfect for him, and he was already there, living together meant he had seen him at his worst and also been there at his best.
The next afternoon John gathered the team together and Lestrade brought them across the back pitches to Lobelia. He'd already given them a speech about making a real effort being just as important as showing up, and all 14 guys had nodded along seriously. It might be a bit embarrassing but they would do anything for each other, especially if it meant keeping their friend's records relatively clean. Still, John couldn't help the frisson of excitement that he felt as the walked through the luxurious corridors to meet the woman waiting at a set of wooden double doors. "Christ mate I might have given dance a go if she was the one putting me through my paces." Danny muttered to the group as they got closer. She was beautiful, acres of pale skin and dark hair, blue eyes and a cracking body, but John personally got the feeling that she was hard to please and the look in her eyes made him feel like she'd tied him up, and that was how she liked it.
"I think I know what's going on" she grinned broadly. "Mycroft doesn't like you. What he did, rather impressively, was force you two to talk about relationships." She looked at John as if that explained everything. He stared back blankly. "Sherlock only had feelings for one person in his life right?" John nodded. "So if he only had those feelings for one person, he'd be very sure that they didn't attach themselves to someone who could, I don't know, ship them off to Antarctica right?" John stared at her, jaw dropped. "Me? He likes… me?" Sarah rolled her eyes "No John" she said sarcastically "he likesme. Of course he likes you! The two of you have been inseparable since the day you met and if his winning personality is anything to go by that's a first. Combine that with the obvious chemistry between you two… have you seen the way you two look at each other? It's so obvious! You mightn't be gay, but you're most certainly not 100% straight. Seriously though John, how can you not see that he wants you… If I knew someone who looked at me like that…" Sarah shook her head and looked at her watch. John was clearly thinking hard about this and she wasn't going to get any useful work out of him now. "Go home John. You're distracted, and I know you have some thinking to do." John nodded with a half smile. "Yeah… thanks for this by the way I wouldn't have gotten that at all." She smiled and patted his back as he walked past "Don't mess this up John." John strode out into the rain, realising about ten minutes into his walk that he'd left his coat behind and that it was hailing just a bit. It didn't seem to matter though.
"Of course you can John. I- Mrs Hudson has been missing you terribly, she's been forcing her inspid television programs on me, it's been torture." John heard the slip and smiled that little half mouth smile he had "I've missed you too, and Mrs Hudson of course. Can I come in or are we going to give the neighbours something else to talk about?" Sherlock started and moved back into the hall and John slipped in behind him. Despite the enormous capacity of his mind, Sherlock couldn't quite get over the fact that John was there, really actually there to stay.
Quietly he walked towards the supply cupboard, wincing at the intermittent squeak of his shoes on the polished floors. However, either Sherlock hadn't heard him, or he wasn't going to run away, because before he knew it John's hand was on the door handle.
“What she means to say, son, is that it seems to us like you, and probably this doctor of yours, would both like to be something a bit more familiar than just acquaintances. I haven't seen you this worked up… well, ever I think. I know, we know that you can do anything you put your mind to- including having a relationship with someone if that's what you wanted to do and I think it is. So I suppose the real question is, what's holding you back?”
"Isn't it lucky then that  I love you quite a bit as well?" Water lapped between them , a cool contrast to the heat of their skin as they slid against each other, hands assisting when the quickening rut was not enough, and muffling their collective gasp when John finally pushed in with Sherlock's legs wrapped around his waist. Whispered affections mingled with groans were swept away by the night as they collided to the rhythm of their breaths, stolen between kisses, and the stars shone their approval in silver streams  on the  water's surface, while far below, Venice slept.
"Right you are Miss Hooper, right you are. I've come to inquire about a journeyman who just recently--" Molly brightened considerably as she interrupted him.
In it’s overwhelming strength, the storm made it almost impossible for all but the most hardy and dedicated to leave their homes and so, naturally, Watson had gone out, the note he left stating something of vague importance about Mrs Hudson’s stock of wood or some other such rubbish.
Admittedly he had been contemplating dashing off. The doors locked when they were closed. She knew him too well. John's mouth had found his neck and in seconds he had forgotten where they were going. Continuing apparently meant a had enough sense to move their suits out of the firing line anyway. "Thank God for sound proofing" John murmured into Sherlock's ear, grinning widely as he wriggled back into his suit, straining around the seatbelt he had managed to wear the entire time. He really was fascinating. Not only with the surprising flexibility but he had in fact noticed the opulence of the vehicle. Always a surprise. "Well if you could stay quiet that would be entirely unnecessary" John feigned an offended expression "I recall hearing the name John being shouted a few times? And you call me loud" Sherlock rolled his eyes and tied his scarf around his neck. "It's exactly 37.5 minutes until we arrive."
" Nah, she talks a big game but when it comes to it she just isn't going to have sex with somebody she barely knows." Greg grunted and rolled onto his front in the grass, absently twirling a long blade between his fingers. Finding a girl that would be happy to do the deed just because it was the last day of camp and John was a fairly good looking guy was more difficult than he'd anticipated.
Think of things you hate, ugly people, your aunt Mary, anything but the almost naked man you're about to get into bed with. John lifted the blankets he had covered Sherlock with and slid beneath them, his chest to Sherlock's back. John shuffled closer and wrapped his arms around Sherlock's torso, threading his legs around Sherlock's own. Sherlock sighed audibly and sank into the embrace. John took the opportunity to bury his face in Sherlock's curls, breathing in the scent that was oh so Sherlock.
Sherlock snapped to full attention, his mind supplying him with facts about the soulmate mark that he had grudgingly picked up along the years and threw aside as useless. Yes, he was aware that the mark simply represented the birth date of your intended, but what was the possibility of seeing his birth month
"John. What I said before. I meant it. I don't have friends I-" Sherlock called to him but John cut across before he could finish. "I don't need to be told again, contrary to your opinion I can actually remember some information." Sherlock growled and yelled across the grass at him, looking a little bit hurt and more than a little scared "Just give me five minutes ok? That's all I ask and then you can go on your merry way and never speak to me again" saying that felt worse than any pain he'd experienced "if you want but just a moment is all I'm asking."John scowled but stood rooted to the spot and waited. " Thank you. As I was saying, I don't have friends, I only-" and John had twisted on his heel and started off again.
smiled placidly at Mycroft, who's shoulders had finally relaxed once he was certain Sherlock was not going to be difficult. Yes, they had been more civil towards each other recently, but long car journeys had always been a point of contention for them and he didn't want to be on bad terms before they even started this holiday. Once Greg arrived with Anthea/Holly ("Her real name is Lucia John why do you insist on using whatever paltry name she deigns to give?" he'd sighed and attempted to explain that it would be wrong to use her name before he was given it but Sherlock had just snorted about his morals being unbelievable.) there was friendly banter between the men with the occasional quip from Holly and then they were pulling out of London and into the country.
John wasn't a cruel man, Sherlock knew this, and he wouldn't just throw Sherlock away without explanation or valid reason, both of which Sherlock consistently took great pleasure in ripping apart to suit his needs and in this he would be justified...unless of course John was already spoken for, or if he was waiting for some sort of guarantee that they were soulmates before he'd agree to be anything to a man he knew was a drug user, or he really didn't feel the same way as Sherlock clearly did.
Maybe soup would be a good plan, something warm in his stomach would do Sherlock good. After all he barely ate anything. All John had to do was get into doctor mode and it would be fine. Just keep telling yourself that he muttered to himself as he lifted the tray upstairs. Sherlock had not improved any while he had been gone. If anything he was worse. John sighed and began stripping off. "Wh-what are you doing John?" John focused very hard on untieing his laces. "Body heat is the most effective way of fixing hypothermia, and seeing as I'm the only body available..." Sherlock was staring at him when he pulled off his trousers.
Mycroft had frozen when Gregory had professed that he loved him, his mind had shut down within moments, the implication of the statement so devastating that his mind had attempted to connect it to their every interaction, to reconcile with the idea that was even possible after years of being conditioned by his father to believe only the worst of himself. He didn't notice that Greg had left, hadn't paid attention to anything else that had been said until much later. "Wait, Gregory! Gre—" he sprinted to their room and was hit with the realisation that it was empty, All Gregory's belongings were gone, his bedside table cleared, the singular photo of the two of them gone (they hadn't even been aware it was being taken, they weren't posing together at all, it was just of Mycroft watching Greg from across the room with a soft smile on his face as Greg laughed at something John had said). Mycroft fell into an armchair and put his head in his hands. He was an idiot of the highest calibre to have let Gregory go. It was his own fault of course, looking back on their altercation he could not blame him for thinking that Mycroft was trying to, as they say, let him down easy, and when he had confessed that he loved him Mycroft should have been there, with him, telling him that he felt the same way, but instead he'd retreated into his head and screwed everything up royally.
John doesn't mention the burning pain he felt on his mark when Sherlock was lying there, half-dead from his overdose.
"I thought London was supposed to be very interesting indeed?" He quipped, hands once again moving, this time through sandy blonde hair.
Sherlock reappeared and Mycroft had to pat himself on the back because this was definitely his best design yet, and made perfectly too. Three piece, jacket and pants both an almost black navy as specified and perfectly tailored because obviously all of Sherlock's measurements were already at his tailors, but it was the shirt and waistcoat that really pulled the whole ensemble together. Both were so close to being white you might just believe they were white if it weren't for the shimmering quality they had that made you give them a second look, made them a paler than the moon sort of silver, and made Sherlock look even more ethereal than he usually did. Mycroft had a bowtie in reserve in case Sherlock decided he wanted it, the same colour as the shirt but for a hint of blue, he also had something else, with strict instructions from Gregory as to how to phrase the giving of it. Now seemed as good a time as any. "Traditions for nuptials are tedious but should be observed and adhered to for the most part, and thus it falls upon me to give you this, and tell you to put it on because apparently 'John will understand' although I'm not sure I want to understand" Mycroft reached into his pocket and pulled out a lacy garter with more than a little blushing. Sherlock smirked and pulled in on under his trousers, not needing any more than that.
