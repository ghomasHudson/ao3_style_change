been trained on them and poised to shoot, and only their son's somewhat clumsy handling of the chunk of wood and miraculously impeccable timing had stopped either one, or both, of them from having a bullet lodged in their brain.
Sherlock and John had been gone approximately 20 minutes when the message came through. The message that made Hamish wish he hadn’t instructed Benson to intercept any police communications to and from Scotland Yard. The message that contained chilling details of yet another killing. He'd been too late. Too late to save them. Hamish felt so painfully suffocated by the news as it came through, so completely crushed. Nothing could halt the bile from rising in his constricting throat when the initial police report disclosed that, on this occasion, there was not one but two bodies at the scene. The images that followed provided the sickening confirmation which Hamish hardly needed. On the screen in front of him, was a young woman discarded like an old rag in a dump of nettles. The inscription of that panicked and desperate apology on her back was only half complete, as the lifeless form of its scribe – Martin Bridges – lay by her side; their bodies boasting similar purples and blacks and blues. Hamish desperately tried to oppress the panic rising within him; two people were dead and two more were in danger, because if this band of sadistic criminals had identified that messages were being left, then they would be preparing for whoever it is who was following them. Without a word, and ignoring Benson's protests, Hamish pulled on his jacket, stuffing his phone into his pocket, and all but ran from the room.
Sherlock pulled John forcefully into his arms, forming a protective cocoon around him whilst murmuring his name into his ear.
Sherlock cared. Sherlock loved him, wholly and truly. John knew that he always had. Love and adoration was such a rare thing for anyone to achieve from a Holmes, and John could never undermine the value of the trust he'd gained that allowed Sherlock to leave himself and his heart open to him. But being with someone who didn't display his feelings as openly and honestly as anyone else did was difficult. Everyone needed to see sometimes. Sometimes just
people. What kind of a shitty person would I be to just selfishly sit on that for the sake of living a 'normal childhood'?”
“A case which I'll have solved by lunch time – at which point I'll require another one. Really John, I'd have thought you'd have been aware of my detective abilities by now” he said, dryly.
Time would pass easily with George and Sarah. It became less like trudging through mud, the endless expanse of a Somme-like battlefield, and more like a gentle stroll, as though the same expanse had blossomed, sprouting the life of long grass peppered with red and white flowers.
Hamish had drifted off to sleep by the time Benson had arrived, his hand still loosely cradling a stubby pencil and his journal lying open and face down on his chest.
“Something was different about this one”, he commented simply, allowing John the space to add what he wished or to ignore the remark completely. He felt John nod against his chest, and his hand tighten its grip on his shirt.
Sherlock had immediately known the reason for his son’s presence. He vaguely remembered John inviting him under the duvet in the early hours of the morning. Hamish, his eyes wide and frightened from another nightmare, had scrambled between them and buried himself under John’s arms, his hands unconsciously seeking the dog tags. He’d come to their room, seeking confirmation that they were both still there, so the nightmare had been about them. Though his eye lids were drooping indicating his fear to fall asleep again, they were not red raw; he’d not cried this time. He was curled into John, clutching possessively at the dog tags; the dream had been about John, then. Sherlock watched as Hamish’s thumb trailed absently over the engraved letters. He traced his son’s line of sight as it flickered briefly to where the chain rested over the scarring on John’s shoulder and then to the metal tags resting in his hands. He’d dreamt of the war again. He’d thrash in his sleep, crying out just as John did, plagued by nightmares which weren’t even his own.
Sherlock was definitely not the model of reliability, or even truth. Hell, Sherlock had pulled the wool over John's eyes more times than he cared to remember and the man's timing left a lot to be desired. As he sat on that splintered chair in that darkened tramway, a rusted but deadly bolt aimed precisely at Sarah's heart, and the death defying situation waiting for him like an old friend, he'd realised how dangerous it was to trust a man like Sherlock Holmes. He also realised he didn't care, because that's what trust was about wasn't it? Unwavering faith. Trusting someone with your own life is one thing, trusting them to save someone else's is another – John had known at that point he was well and truly screwed – but not once did his belief in Sherlock's ability falter.
to know everything, and yet he'd not picked up on the fact that Hamish had been working away at a University application. Were they really both paying him such little attention? John couldn't fight the sinking feeling in his stomach; the guilt. What else had they missed? What kind of a terrible parent didn't know that their child was applying to University? John had always pictured himself helping his son with things like this, guiding him through the application process, accompanying him on Open Day visits to the institutions he'd chosen. John considered the possibility that perhaps Sherlock was right, and that Hamish had wanted to keep it as a surprise until he was certain he'd successfully been offered a place, but he couldn't help but feel like he'd missed out on a huge part of Hamish's life. University was a milestone, it was a big deal and John would never forgive himself for not seeing Hamish through that. No wonder he'd been stressed. John had just assumed it was nothing more than exam stress and teenage angst. He hadn't even
He swiftly cleared away his dirty dishes and returned to the pile of post on the desk. He shuffled through the selection of envelopes, casting only cursory glances at each of them as he wandered into the hallway towards the bedroom.
“Case?” Hamish inquires. Sherlock simply shakes his head in response and Hamish gives a small sigh. “London's criminals are so dull these days, it's borderline rude.” They share a glance and break into light giggles. Sherlock reaches a hand to ruffle Hamish's sandy blonde curls before moving back to his typing. John finally makes an appearance two minutes later.
forgive you for this.” The choked sobs, which had been threatening yet another attack, returned with a vengeance. John felt the weight of it crush his lungs and twist and stab at his sickened stomach. Sherlock's heavy focus faltered as he looked away.
Birthday, relatively simple murder, what Sherlock had called 'an easy starter'. His Dad had been fuming when he'd found out.
Sherlock was gone by the time John woke the next morning. It wasn't unusual for Sherlock to rise before him, he often did; wandering out into the flat to busy himself whilst John slept on undisturbed. It was a rhythm they'd settled into long ago, John adapting to comfortably sleep through Sherlock's early morning violin sessions.
a child. No matter how much Sherlock tried to repress the idea, no matter how many times he regarded his son's tall lean frame and those features which he could manipulate to pass for a man twice his age, Hamish was still a child. That was a fact. 17 years old and still very much a child, and moments like this, just tiny and otherwise insignificant moments like this served only to amplify this assertion. Child; a word that tasted so very bitter on his tongue and so felt so very raw in his head. It brought him doubt, and there was no feeling Sherlock Holmes despised more than doubt. Bounding up to the body in front of him was a child,
John didn't know what he'd expected to find, or who. He wasn't even sure if he'd wanted Sherlock to be there but he couldn't help the slight twist of his gut upon finding the flat empty. The worry had started to nag, tapping ever so slightly at the back of his mind. Sherlock had left the hospital some hours ago, distraught and sorrowful, yet he'd not returned home.
Sherlock smirks. Point taken. Hamish settles himself next to Sherlock, who has reached over the arm of the sofa to retrieve John's laptop and is now furiously typing away, obviously trying to occupy himself whilst they wait for John to make an appearance.
Lestrade fixed them with a glare. “Do you mind not doing that?” He gestured vaguely in the space between them. “Gives me the creeps.”
I really enjoyed writing Hamish in this chapter; it's really quite fun to play with such a diverse range of characteristics from both John and Sherlock and form them into just one character, but I am still finding my feet with 'Mish so do please bear with me.
was okay. He wondered if Sherlock ever worried over the state of John's heart and mind after an argument in the way that John worried about him.
, and it was almost wounding, because how could John ever turn him away from a desire like that; a motive so pure?
As a crossfire erupted above his head, bullets sweeping their graceful trajectory in search of their targets, John realised that reinforcements from Scotland Yard must have arrived. He couldn't determine from the exchange of ammunition how many there were, and he found that he didn't care. His focus was locked and there was nothing in it but himself and Hamish. The roar of gunfire barely even penetrated the muffling bubble that seemed to be constricting around him. As his hands carried out the almost habitual ritual he'd performed so many times on fallen comrades, he thought of all the times he'd managed to save his friends from similar wounds...and then he drowned in the times that he
"Calm down." I carried out Holmes' order and administered some laudanum. Hopefully, it would relax his nerves for some time. "I understand, sir," Holmes continued in a soothing voice. "Yet I can't do anything without facts. I need your help. Calm down and tell me the whole story."
The Jinn were made of fire. Or, humans had regarded them as being about more than granting wishes, or living in bottles. They weren’t thought of as having blue skin and wearing horrible clothes, or
the feeling that Mrs Nordon is no such woman. She didn’t want to harm anyone, so, tragically, she lied about her identity to Colonel Landsbury. That was a big mistake.”
On our way back home, even the cab ride through the winter wonderland was spoiled, as Holmes did not put my mind at ease but admitted that he believed Norton would at least try to kill him so he said, Norton’s whole career had been built on the fact that he could inspire confidence.
The child’s room was filled with toys, small colourful wooden horses, and delicate porcelain dolls. The walls were covered with small golden frames. The pictures showed rural scenes. Her bed was unmade. The comforter had been pushed back, and the pillow moved. There was an imposing fireplace against a wall. Various knick-knacks hung on the mantle.
I sensed Holmes had a plan, one that was falling into pieces at the moment. Frankly, I was still baffled about our presence at the opening of the will. What did we have to do with this strictly private matter? The Landsbury case was closed, hadn't Holmes made it clear to us? The rest were no longer our business, especially if Mrs Nordon was away.
my particular voice, I normally saved for my patients or, more often these days, for distressed clients, I addressed Jones: “That was surely difficult for you.”
John was furious. First, because it was almost an echo of Sherlock’s first sentence during their first cab ride, and he wouldn’t put it past that bastard that he did it on purpose. Second, because the older Holmes had always claimed that he would worry about him, Sherlock, which had to be another lie. Because, and that was the third and final reason, he had used his own brother as a pawn in a game with Moriarty. Yet, John pushed back his emotions, but barely.
In the beginning, John had inquired about Jessie and Beatrice and their friends out of necessity. Naturally, he had kept track of their whereabouts from afar, but records only reveal so much. He had read that Beatrice was fierce and determined, over-protective of her sister and her friends, that she had a great heart and he estimated that she’ll hate him for all eternity.
If Tobias Organ had hired some impersonator to look and sound so like me that even Nicolas Cartridge, who had known me for years could be convinced, then Holmes might although be deceived and then what power they would have in their hands.
This assumption carefully crafted by myself was incorrect on two counts. The first was rather obvious, as Holmes himself had said prominently once that he would be lost without his Boswell. We shared everything as we had done for decades on 221b Baker Street. Our partnership was a fixed point in a changing age, and while the world was on fire, we two remained; however, and this was the second wrong assumption: Holmes and I lived not in Sussex but in a lovely seaside town called Sherrington in Dorset.
"The Winsterneys told me a few things about Colonel Landsbury and his entourage. Our client places his trust in a very questionable manner: The Winsterneys suspect Miss Parker. She is flirtatious towards him. She appeared at Crevecoeur Hall shortly after Landsbury's wife’s death and has woven her web over the years to trap the colonel. She seems to have succeeded."
I witnessed how it hit my partner in slow motion. His first instinct was to scold them because they’re too loud — and proud. Then, Sherlock's mind fired up: at last, he made the connection. Pride month.
not. My sight was blurring around the edges. I hoped I was only feeling dizzy and not actually suffering a stroke. I was breathing heavily as if I had run a marathon while I was frozen on the spot. Suddenly, there was a warm hand on my shoulder; it was only Holmes.
have been killed! Damn, Holmes, leave this to people who are more skilled in such matters. Now, Holmes, you listen to me: if this happens one more time, I will lock you up in our rooms. The very idea...! You make me furious. I... I just do not know... Sometimes I just
Mike was perpetually cheerful, self-deprecating, getting soft and round as a university professor. He had only stopped his easy smiling when John had replied to his inquiry about what he had done in Afghanistan with “Getting shot”.
Help? Please,... a man who lived for years with fraud and still believes in him? You don’t really believe that we need such people to do our work?
Immediately Holmes started inspecting the room, first the corners, then the walls, muttering quietly to himself. To be frank, I was not sure that he was not secretly enjoying this. While I was visualizing myself and Holmes being starved to death, my companion brought me back to the present.
Oh, Sherlock knew where to go, who to hunt down and what to do, but his heart was not into it anymore.
“Gordian knot, I assume you’re familiar with the concept? Now, imagine that violence, in this case, does not hold the key, but deduction. That instead of using a sword, one uses the mind to solve it. What would then be your take on our mystery?”
The police needed results, tips, anything. They were running out of time because the press and the public were chasing after them. I wanted to do the right thing — and took the wrong turn: I informed Greg about our findings.
Out in the open, they are the best of friends. From time to time, you will see them talk in the Criterion, arguing about everything and anything. Daily, Watson comes to the smithy to bring his weapons for inspection. When the blacksmith gets burned he consults Watson first, and over time, the townspeople remember that he used to be the late apothecary son. With Watson’s reassurances, he aims for Molly Hooper’s shop for a salve.
When you want to tell me about your memories of said movie or episode, or dunno, your fannish crushes, do tell :D
Sherlock had surprised him - them - by an invitation for a Christmas party. John had been even more baffled when he had entered his old rooms. Not only Mrs Hudson had greeted them but also their found family, Molly, Greg and Mike, but also Sally and Anderson, Janine and Irene Adler. How she had come from death (again!), John had forbidden himself to ask. Further, to get a rouse out of her meddling and hints and fake smiles. Her girlfriend (?) had attended the rather unusual festivity as well. Thank God Mycroft had remained home or wherever his residences these days; the aftermath of the whole debacle that should not be named had strained further since their relationship that had been tested since their first meeting all those years ago.
Holmes and Cavendish wanted to speak to Mrs Nordon immediately. I went to fetch her, welcoming the time to calm myself. It wasn’t proper either if three men visited a woman in her room.
Therefore, it was only a matter of time until Rosamund “Rosie” Watson-Holmes asked her father one night, “Tell me how we ended up here.”
John and Harry Watson had never got along, but when he had returned from the war, she had been John’s only option. For obvious reasons, John had to
During the walk, I have become almost a comrade, an absent brother-in-arms for the colonel, who cordially called me Watson. War could do that two men, memories bringing people together.
“But why kill Adèle? Wouldn't it have been easier to keep her alive and return her to the Colonel once the truth about Mrs Nordon is established? Why go to the end of this madness?”
“You left the newspaper twice open at that page. The moneylender, Zimmermann, a legitimate businessman with a wife and two young children, was murdered with an army rifle. The police have many reasons to believe Organ to be the culprit; one of these is that Organ owns an army rifle. Organ, of course, denies that his army rifle is the murder weapon.”
"We're going to have to dig. With this damn snow that covers everything, we will discover nothing until spring."
“Cartridge. I have not the least idea what you talking about. And as for newspapers, I haven’t seen one in days.”
Sussex is where every Londoner went. Everyday people save up all their lives to retire there, to Brighton, Hastings, and Eastbourne. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were no everymen.
Tuesday night turned into Wednesday morning. One, two, three, four a.m. came and went. I was exhausted, but the memories of today and the past tumbled together inside my head.
Several hours passed. Mary-Ann, a good compassionate soul, brought me some hot coffee and sandwiches, prepared by the cook. At my request, the fire was lit. Time passed lowlier still.
I heard Holmes' footsteps come back to me. I pulled myself up against the trunk of a tree and could see what he was doing. To my horror, Holmes dragged Cavendish's body around and undressed him.
Our old brown horse reared in fear, despite Master Cavendish's whip. We could not avoid the carriage. Our little pram, so fragile, was hit violently on the side.
“Excellent work, Mr Holmes! I read your text and rushed over. While I wanted to express my thanks in person, I am also curious about the identity of the culprit. You’ve been silent about this. But I read enough of Dr Watson’s reports to know that you love a big scene, so do your worst, Mr Holmes.”
it is a work of art, and a fascinating piece of social history. Alternatively, as I would say: A Sex Toy can reveal a whole existence. Here: A very well-do Anglo-Irish family with the name of [...].
The good doctor looked at him more and more lost, wondering what had happened to the real Sherlock Holmes, because, even if he had without a doubt the appearance, that could not possibly be him.
As we were about to leave his office, the little lawyer had perhaps a gasp of remorse. He called Holmes back. "I cannot help you, Mr Holmes. I want to, but my ethics forbid me. Please, understand me?"
The next morning, I found Holmes in the same position, looking more sullen than ever. I couldn't get anything out of him except for a few indistinct growls. While my companion was getting ready for our trip to Norwich, I ate breakfast alone. I took my doctor’s bag with me. There might only be a slim chance, but I had not given up hope yet. Therefore, I wanted to be prepared for all eventualities.
Before I could answer, my friend's dry voice, emerging from the dust-covered vault, echoed: “Excellent idea, Miss. We are following you.”
Holmes continued, and I detected a glimmer of mischief and fondness (rather odd, my subconsciousness noted) in his whole demeanour.
See you all tomorrow when the phase starts I love to read (and write) texting, oh yes, it’s #epistolary
"I did, Mr Holmes, for weeks I searched for her. I even travelled to her Aunt Lydia, who lives at the seaside because I believed she could hide them. Of course, I
After his return, after we became more intimate than the current law would allow two men to be, I learned I am the exception for Mr Sherlock Holmes in many things; one of which is that he does not mind my meddling. It pleased him as he admitted to me in the secret of our bedchamber once, that even when he is deep in thoughts and lost to the world, he can trust in his companion to be there when he emerges again.
It’s half-past one on the dot when Sherlock Holmes eyes the left-over lasagne suspiciously, and John Watson inhales the same dish with gusto. The company by proxy makes Sherlock give the lunch a try, and he surprises himself that he finishes most on his plate.
"I do not know. It’s all very curious. But someone must know about it. And you know what’s even more strange?"
“Yes, and a miscalculation on my part. I should have deduced that you both shared more than a dorm room at university. Do not deny it, John. It is alarmingly obvious, at least, to me, now. Spare me the details. I am not a jealous man, John. So, stop whatever you want to say. Now, it is late and works to do tomorrow. I must insist on extracting you another guarantee.”
It had taken me far too long to understand why the trip to the countryside occurred more often in the 1910s. I had simply followed Holmes, where he went, I followed, always and forever. No Great War could part us, even though it had been a close call for me.
For having never been here before, Holmes appeared to have a lot of local knowledge. Normally, I would admire his dedication to the case. More than likely, I would have praised him by now if this was any other day or any other case. Instead, I felt irritated. I should be the one guiding Holmes for once, I should introduce him to my past, I should not be the one who followed and dragged around like a chess piece in some elaborate game of his at worst. Never in our long partnership have I found us on such unequal footing. It was distressing, and if I dare say it, heartbreaking in my mind.
"Do you wished it to be?" The doctor retorted, puzzled and irritated by that absurd accusation, raising an eyebrow.
“Prepare something for yourself,” he called back. “I am afraid I have sent Mrs Hudson away. I cannot risk the lives of innocent people. And Watson, be so good to stay away from the basement. Confine yourself to our own rooms and the kitchen, there’s a good fellow.”
It’s her line - and England would fall when she’s going to leave Baker Street: “A nice cuppa? I’ve made a cake, a simple one, mind you. Not very celebratory. Will pop over to the shops later!”
he touching me for a second?—and somehow I ended up in my armchair and some brandy passed down my throat. His very own grey blanket, knitted by Mrs Hudson,
The final line echoes loud. Mrs Hudson has stopped her hoovering as well as her sing-along. Leaving on the mic had been a bad idea.
Not even Sherlock reacted, even though I wasn’t sure if it was because of the disruption. It might have been the umbrella that resembled his brother’s that made his face turn expressionless.
Hesitantly, John reached through the hole in the Plexiglas and he touched the driver on the shoulder. The man’s head jerked up with a start, and he put his foot down on the gas, lurching them across the intersection.
I understood nothing Holmes was telling me. What was happening? What role? In the past, whenever Holmes had kept me in the dark, it had hurt us or our clients. My Holmes knew all-too-well that I had severe trust issues. Yet, my partner abandoned me once more.
Wilkes, who is pale and drunk and nearly falling off his stool, interrupts Anderson without even an apology. With a booming voice, he blurts out, “Damn! What great jewellery! Bless Holmes’ britches and his balls!”
As if summoned, Sherlock was suddenly standing in the kitchen. Before meeting Sherlock, John would have put such things into the category of a fairy tale. However, trading with a Jinn—nothing could be impossible, not as John believed in such things now.
Landsbury The colonel got up like a madman and ran into his office. Fearing some misfortune, I followed him. But Landsbury only wanted to find Ms Nordon's references. He began frantically rummaging through the files neatly stored in his desk drawers. He threw them on the floor, reminding me of Holmes in his relentlessness to find the information hidden in his documents. Soon the room looked like the Stock Exchange after a session, with the floor littered with papers. The colonel sat down in a large padded armchair, overwhelmed.
Not that I hoped to be scolded for leaving him behind once again, or maybe I did secretly. To hear his hurt, and to know that he cared.
“You know very well that Mrs Nordon will inherit nothing. The colonel certified to me he had disinherited her.”
Ashamed of my weakness, I got up. About ten policemen surrounded me, mocking faces. Fortunately, Lestrade was not among them.
On the clifftop trail that looked like a road to nowhere but led to a lone estate. I got the impression that a bad storm could send it tumbling down the cliff. We followed the sandy track that cut through the gorse.
“There was a question, John?” The bastard acts all innocent, rails him up on purpose, and oh, how he hasn’t missed this one iota.
when you got in. You’ve exhibited no discomfort ever since—as if you’ve forgotten about it, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan—Afghanistan or Iraq.”
As a smart man, Sherlock Holmes can do the maths: today is their anniversary. A private celebration might be in order; it’s a thought that caught the blacksmith unaware. He, who believed to be as hard as metal, discovered a softness in his soul.
Maybe, Sherlock muses while he searches in his mind palace for the final piece, I finally found him.
His fingers are dancing; up, down, up again. There’s some variation in it today. John’s right, you cannot play Chopin while following the rules, Sherlock’s treacherous inner voice says.
I went up to Holmes to force him to look at her. She was smiling at the photographer, ribbons in her hair.
"They invite me regularly to their country party." Landsbury smiled condescendingly. "The Winsterneys have a higher rank, they are nobles."
He also knows how to fiddle around with the ladies, if you know what I mean. In fact, there is not a tavern in town where he would not play, especially if they have comely little serving maids there.
John had come back to London after being shot in the shoulder, and that he survived should have been a miracle enough, however, what good was surviving when one scarcely had means to live another week? His nerves were too shattered to guarantee a full night’s sleep. He had woken more often than not with the sound of gunfire ringing in his ears. Recently, he caught himself thinking about ending it all with his illegal service revolver. Apparently, posttraumatic stress disorder was far worse than all the warnings made it out to be.
John would never be fully convinced of how far that was true. Old habits died hard, and it had always been a characteristic of his to hold himself accountable for the suffering of those around him. He'd always felt it was his own responsibility to help everyone. It was part of the reason he became a doctor; an attempt to ease that burden by feeling like he was at least giving something back. It backfired of course, served only to amplify this care-taking part of his personality. He couldn't shake it at the best of times, with complete strangers, but to be relieved of that weight now that it was his son unconscious in a hospital bed before him was an impossibility.
But you didn't, because you think you're so high and mighty.” John was towering over Mycroft where he sat in the chair now, refusing to back up and only closing in further around his brother-in-law. “I'm not one of your little government pets to be ordered around. We're family and, like it or not, we're equals. You have a responsibility to come to me when Sherlock is being reckless, regardless of your own desires, because I
Sherlock moved to stand by the bed, looking down at their son where he lay connected by a web of wires to every machine imaginable; keeping him breathing, monitoring his heart, pumping him with fluids and medication to keep him sleeping. The recovery would be long and slow. Hamish looked so broken, and Sherlock thought he may as well have shot Hamish himself – his blood would still be on his hands.
John threw hasty accusations that Sherlock had created a rift between them and Lestrade, that his stupid stunt had made their friendship and working relationship uncomfortable. Sherlock, to his credit, tried to defend Lestrade as far as he could, trying to take the brunt of the blame. But John was like an angry bull, and each of Sherlock's frantic excuses, each of his desperate attempts to apologise and to calm John down, acted only as another red flag. His rage was white hot, scalding and bitter, and then it was red, a fiery passionate rage. It was the sizzling heartbreak all over again.
Hamish's unsatisfactory assessment of the room's offerings was abruptly halted by the middle aged man he saw struggling through the main door across the room. He was propping the door open with one foot as he hauled his case through, followed by a display board;
John sighed. “This wasn't big or clever, Hamish. Do you realise how seriously you could have been hurt?” His voice was a mixture of aching concern and heartbreaking resignation. “It's bad enough your Father being a reckless idiot, without you blindly following him...”
Hamish gasps, leaping across the sofa to clasp a hand over Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's grin is obvious even under his son's hand, and a pink flush creeps across Hamish's cheeks. John sees fit to continue the assault with a remark of his own.
It didn't feel like their bed tonight though. It felt huge, vast and empty. There was a chasm between them, a void. The space in the sheets stretched for miles between them, a canyon which seemed eternal and endless, both void of anything and teeming with everything left unsaid. The bed had never felt so huge and John had never felt so cold within it. He was so used to having Sherlock's lean form all but wrapped around him, cocooning him and holding him close and safe and warm. Now they laid parted and isolated, neither reaching to bridge the gap, but both wishing they knew how to, longing for the strength.
George nodded, his expression bright with new interest. "I can imagine. A particular favourite of mine was 'The Speckled Blonde'. Bizarre.”
John gave a sad smile at the collection of birthday cards for Hamish which were located towards the bottom of the pile. Hamish would turn 18 in two days; they'd not really planned anything to celebrate, but spending his birthday in a coma was so far from how John had imagined the milestone birthday for his son. He flicked past the coloured envelopes swiftly in an attempt to quash the sickening tightening in his throat and chest.He halted his shuffling when he encountered another envelope addressed to Hamish. This one, the envelope pristine white, bared the name
Sherlock had always said John was lousy at observing – he was right, to an extent. Sherlock's mind was electric and wired and
Oh gosh I am so sorry! I had a draft for this when I posted the last chapter but I somehow lost it and, well, with life being as hectic as it is lately with Uni prep and whatnot, a rewrite has taken me a while! But here you go. Enjoy?
He moved a hand up to cup Sherlock's cheek, running the pad of his thumb up the ragged contours of that impossible Sherlockian face. “You know that's not true”, he said simply. He hoped it was enough, but the truth of it was that so much was going unsaid. Cuts had been made and wounds would need nursing before scars formed over them. John swallowed, drawing back and running his hands over his face in frustration. Why couldn't Sherlock just
“Did you know?” The question was simple enough, but it was underpinned by the slightest accusation. It was obvious to both parties that it translated more as
Benson paid regular visits. Daily, in fact. Sometimes his wife joined him on these visits bringing with her offerings of home-cooked food. The scent of lovingly-crafted, sweet, cinnamon buns and warm chicken soup that drifted through those double doors after her brought with it a gentle hum of nostalgia. She provided the kind of mothering that reminded both John and Sherlock so warmly of Mrs Hudson. She, like the nurse, never overstayed her welcome. She offered enough comfort, but gave Sherlock and John valuable time alone, time that they needed, even if they don’t know they needed it.
proved to be fruitful. It returned leftovers of Hamish's home made chilli. He opted not to bother cooking any rice to go with it, and instead thrust the container into the microwave for a few minutes before settling down at the kitchen table to eat. Mrs Hudson had insisted she teach Hamish to cook, stating that neither John nor Sherlock had culinary skills beyond those of cave man, and that if at least one occupant of 221B didn't learn to cook soon then they would all die of malnutrition. John suspected that she didn’t have the patience to teach either himself or Sherlock, and thus figured that Hamish was the only option which wouldn't significantly age her. It was times like this that he was glad they'd humoured her. He still vividly remembered the first time Hamish had cooked chilli for them all, not even a whole week from his 11
He adjusted himself slightly so he was sitting up a little more, and the nurse reached behind him to adjust the pile of pillows propping him up before going about her duties.
It was John who eventually broke the spell of silence which had descended as they picked at their breakfast.
When the surgeon emerged several excruciating hours later, still not a word had been uttered. John barely heard what he was saying to them. He was completely numb, still trapped in the muted bubble which had enveloped him as he'd begun his work on Hamish at the factory. The doctor's words washed over him as his heart finally beat a steady but deafening rhythm.
, were left implied, and John finally understood the growing restlessness of his son to solve this case. He was still fighting to save whoever was unfortunate enough to have been earmarked for butchery today.
John heaved a deep sigh at the sight before him. “'Mish...you could at least make an effort. Today's an important day for you.”
John woke to the unnerving feeling of someone else's presence, a feeling soon justified as he looked up slowly from where his head was resting by his son's hand on the side of the hospital bed, to see Mycroft stood across from him. He was staring intently at the digital display of Hamish's vital signs, leaning casually on his umbrella with his left foot crossed loosely over his right. John blinked a few times, trying to clear the sleep from his vision, before sitting up straight in his chair and self-consciously brushing himself down. He glanced briefly to the clock on the wall; he'd slept for just over 90 minutes, and if he was honest he felt worse for it. The clock on the wall seemed to be struggling as he was, laboriously forcing its hands on their circuit of numbers, each tick echoing guilt at not being able to move faster and bring John closer to a time where his son would be with him again.
The camera wobbles slightly as Hamish adjusts it where it's sat on the mantle. He moves to shift the armchairs slightly so they are positioned neatly in frame. He pulls up a third chair from the kitchen, placing it between the two armchairs facing the camera directly. He frowns slightly, his brow furrowing as he makes a soft 'hmph' sound. Unimpressed with his setup, he moves the chairs back to their respective original places in the flat, before hauling the sofa forward. He flops onto it with a sigh, puffing out a breath and closing his eyes briefly.
“John.” The response came back low and hoarse. Sherlock sounded worn and John imagined he looked worse – withered and drained. John sat up on the bed, making space for Sherlock in a silent plea for him to come closer. John was still angry, and he still wanted to punch the detective, but not half as much as he just needed the comfort and security that only he could offer.
angry. He didn't want to go running to Sherlock this time. He didn't want to be the one to give in and cave first – Sherlock needed to understand that sometimes he was in the wrong, and that John wasn't always going to come running after him to patch things up and check if he was okay. For once John wished that Sherlock would approach
John called up the stairs to his teenage son's room, not for the first time that morning, to receive the same grumbling response.
It was the final chunky book of his son’s collection which drew John’s attention the most. A worn and well-read copy of Shakespeare’s complete works, littered with various scraps of paper and post it notes marking various pages. These, as John later learned, contained Hamish’s favourite quotes, with the dog-eared pages indicating the frequency of Hamish’s perusal of them. John couldn’t say he was surprised that Hamish owned such a literary classic, but he was surprised that he didn’t possess this well-loved copy because he was studying it.
Hamish cast his eyes across the room to a stand for the local bank. The banker, large and balding, and evidently uncomfortable in the suit he was wearing. Maybe because it was a bit snug and he'd gained weight, more likely because of its expense. Not a fat cat banker – evident from the low quality, faux gold watch on his wrist and the age of his mobile phone; two or three years old at least, at least 3 new models had since succeeded it. No, this man did
Sherlock would outlive God trying to have the last word, and yet this text remained without response.
He was pulled from his thoughts by a nurse opening the door behind him, pulling medical equipment behind her. She made her way round the bed, with a thermometer and a cuff. She placed a gentle hand on Hamish’s shoulder to rouse him.
He silently placed the Shakespearean literature he was still clutching on the end of the bed, before moving over to Hamish's side. He leant down, planting a gentle kiss  on the mop of blonde unruly curls which covered Hamish's head. As he moved away, replacing the tender gesture with a gentle ruffle of his hands  through Hamish's hair, his other hand went to the letter that had been pressed closed to his heart. He withdrew it, and without a word pressed it into his son's  hands.
There was a rumbling chuckle as George's mouth creased into a wry but amused grin. “Son, if I had a pound for every time I'd heard that one in my 40 years, I wouldn't be doing the rounds of London's secondary schools every year.” He sobered up, clearing his throat and straightening himself, shifting his weight onto his right leg and smoothing down his jacket, as though he'd just remembered why he was there and who he was supposed to be representing. “So, interested in a career with your nation's armed forces, eh?” He offered Hamish a leaflet, which he took without acknowledgement and folded into the inside pocket of his blazer.
Of course he was. Of course Hamish Watson-Holmes would frequent the famous verses of Hamlet and Othello to
Suddenly John yearned for his company; needed it like air. He rejected the solitude, he didn't want to be alone anymore.
“It's 8:45, Hamish.” Sherlock stated flatly and in response Hamish gave a hefty sigh and disappeared without so much as a goodbye. They heard the click of the front door as he left, and Sherlock was already typing a message on his phone.
Hamish still spent a lot of his time sleeping. He struggled to stay awake for much over 40 minutes at a time for the first few days. This increased to an hour or so by the end of the week, but his body was still recovering, and so he remained much the same; sleeping for 4 or 5 hours at a time, and then waking for short periods.
He unfolded the last two thirds of the paper and, after a moments hesitation and a reassuring nod from Sherlock, began reading:
“Took me feckin’ ages.” George continued, looking down into his now empty mug which he rolled absently between his hands. “Civilian life didn’t exactly sit well will me to start with. Took me a while to realise that it wasn’t life as a civilian that disagreed with me so much, but life as an amputee.” George stopped himself abruptly. He wasn’t sure how much more he should be saying, he honestly hadn’t intended on making this visit a post-war shit-story sharing session. John seemed completely at ease with the conversation though. George imagined that, like him, this was possibly the first time he’d had the opportunity to share these memories with someone who was both
Not until the next morning, when it was so gingerly pierced by the soft sound of a raspy voice from the bed beside them. “Dad?”
“Well, I’m happy with your BP and temperature,” the nurse piped up. “Someone will be round to replace your IV shortly, but shout if there’s anything else we can do to make you more comfortable.”
John had to do a double take. He'd been gently nodding and smiling to himself in agreement at his son's praise of Sherlock, the man he'd chosen to love, the man he'd waited 2 years  for and never given up hope on. The delay was the fault of his own lack of attention to what his son was saying, his assumption that those words were of course about Sherlock. Not once would he ever have himself believe that words which sung such praise and admirtaion were intended for him. But when the reality of Hamish's praise caught up with him, he found it difficult to breathe past the lump forming in his  throat.
John's eyebrows knitted together in frustration as he rested the newspaper back onto his lap. “Sherlock, you
“Psychology? You think that's because of me?” The creases of John's brow deepened as his eyebrows seemed to knit together, seeking comprehension of Sherlock's theory.
I'm so so so SO sorry for the long hiatus. University kinda got on top of me the last few months. Unfortunately I've been stuck writing essays and reports rather than what I want to be writing...but I'm back for now! Here's a short chapter to keep you going for now.
They chatted idly, about everything and anything, and even Sherlock felt inclination to offer the odd baritone contribution on occasion. Though he knew that the detective would not admit as such, John was certain that Sherlock had taken a liking to Sarah. She was intelligent, wise beyond the years that her face gave away, yet youthful almost to the point of innocence. She wouldn't bother him, she never intruded upon his quiet brooding. She only spoke to him if he spoke first, which was rare but not wholly non-existent. Brief, simple comments, but laden with neither the sarcasm nor animosity which he so often directed at the majority of the population. John felt a silent pride seeing Sherlock so amenable, and though John wished their meeting could have been under different circumstances, he was glad that Benson had finally introduced them both to his wife.
“Too little, too late.” John's voice was low but harsh. “Now get out. You have no business with me or my son.”
“Two sets of DNA. Our victim's blood, and that of his killer. Our messenger here cut himself whilst carving out his apology.”
Mycroft didn’t dare to show his face, but his input was felt. Hamish was made more than comfortable, even as the steady flow of his medication was reduced as the days passed. They were in a private ward, all press attention and communications for Sherlock were diverted. Mycroft had ensured that their time in hospital was spent in complete peace from the outside world, and as much as they loathed to admit it both John and Sherlock were grateful. Hamish underwent his treatment undisturbed and uninterrupted by press attention, and John had never been more thankful of the seemingly endless power that Mycroft possessed over everyone and everything. As the days passed, the medication that was keeping Hamish comatose was reduced, until the only thing keeping him unconscious was his own body's healing processes. John found himself afraid to sleep, to leave Hamish's side for even a second, in case he roused from his slumber. But as hours turned into days, John had to grapple with reality, even whilst desperately trying to keep one hand wrapped round his own misguided hope. His medical mind told him that there was simply no knowing how much longer the healing process would take, and he grew weary. He grew worn and frustrated.
is an appropriate time to show concern for your brother.” No response came, but John knew that he'd understood, and with that he collapsed back into his former chair, running his now sweaty palms over his face, his weary eyes stinging with lost sleep.
“Callously murdered, not by our prime suspect; Mrs Turner's Cat, but by Mrs Turner herself!”, John adds in a scandalous tone that Mrs Hudson would be proud of.
Hamish rubbed a hand anxiously at the back of his neck. “Erm...internet.” He chuckled slightly to himself. “Anyway, turns out I was right.” Hamish beamed, and Sherlock rolled his eyes as if to say
Sherlock gave an irritated tut before meandering swiftly through the huddle of forensics personnel and sinking to his haunches beside the body which was face down in the foliage. Hamish followed at a slightly slower pace, with Lestrade in tow, documenting the surroundings. They were beneath a redundant railway bridge in the darker corners of Camden town. The undergrowth had been left to spread and multiply like bacteria on the once intricate Victorian stonework. Those old cobbles had probably seen their fair share of criminal activity over the years; drug deals taking place in the darkened shelter, out of view. Hamish wondered if this was the first body to grace its twisted and tangled undergrowth. His evaluative gaze followed the trail of flattened weeds leading to the unfortunate victim. The body had clearly been dragged, a lone assailant then?
John trusted Sherlock, possibly against his better judgement sometimes, but he did. He trusted him wholly and completely from the very start, without even really considering what it meant. He never truly considered the gravity of that commitment at the beginning, because that's what trust is; a commitment of faith greater than any other.
“But I’ll be honest with you, I don’t even know where to start.” John continued, before running one hand over his face in frustration
Sinking down to sit on Hamish's bed, he averted his attentions back to the letter in his hand, having placed the birthday cards on the pillow. He turned the envelope over in his hand, seeking a return address on the reverse side in order to discover the letter's origin.
Sherlock cuts him off abruptly, giving him a withered look. “Don't be obtuse, John, she knows who you are.”
The last thing he wanted was visitors. Sherlock, Lestrade, Mycroft – they could all go to hell. John wanted to remain in his room; him and his son cocooned in an impenetrable bubble.
He was craving the calm serenity and comfort, the man who radiated loyalty and compassion and something beyond
“Northumberland Fusiliers”, Hamish remarked, nodding towards the badge's position on the lapels of the man's jacket.
“I'm here”, he mumbled softly between kisses. He'd not had to do this in so long, the nightmares which had plagued John so often had almost faded completely over the years, with John only suffering them mildly ever few months. It'd been years, or even decades, since one had provoked such a traumatised and nightmarish reaction. Sherlock could feel John almost shaking in his arms. Nightmares of the war had always been bad, but never like this. Something was different now.
Before John could even think about what he was doing, his body was acting without him; his fist collided heavily and squarely with jaw of the British government.
Hamish's skin was quivering under the spread of goosebumps which were making an assault up his arms and legs, but he tensed himself and slammed his foot down onto the pedal. Sweat began beading on the back of his neck, and his heart was strumming a rhythm in a tempo he'd never previously experienced as the engine splutterd into life beneath him. “I expect so”, he said under his breath through gritted teeth, before tearing away from the curb.“It's just that sort of day.”
“But this time,” John continued. “You couldn't be more wrong. You think I'm only doing this for Hamish's sake.”
The soft reverberation of each note, the gentle caress of each sound, sang of those serene and lazy Sunday mornings. They chimed of the laughter of a little boy bouncing energetically on his parents' bed, his squeals as he was tackled into the duvet and tickled into submission. They carried the scent of powder and honey suckle and the touch of tender finger tips grasping at thin air and seeking purchase in the soft cotton of John's shirt.
"Brilliant? That he is." John smiled to himself. He chuckled lightly before adding “He's also a colossal pain in the arse.” George barked a laugh at that, shaking his head slightly whilst shooting John a quizzical look. “See those bullet holes in the wall?” John continued. George cast a glance at the smiley face which had become such a trademark part of 221B and nodded, his brow furrowing slightly in confusion. “He was
The impact sent John reeling. Those hushed Gaelic syllables were wishes of good health, wishes of luck and good fortune. They were wishes of happiness and love. But more than that, they were the words of a mother who never was, and John's heart just ached for them both. It choked him, gripping at his heart and pushing violently against his ribcage. He had a son. A beautiful, wonderful, talented, intelligent son, and he had so nearly lost him. John Watson was blinded by just how
“How dare you.” Mycroft was almost snarling now, spitting his words like venom. John could not help the sense of triumph that washed over him at seeing Mycroft Holmes with his feathers so violently ruffled. He had to sharpen his focus in order to keep the flicker of amusement from announcing itself in a small smirk on his face. “Do you realise-”
John wasn't sure which possibility he liked least. He shared a glance with Sherlock, and they both nodded an agreement. Priority: getting their son out of there, out of danger.
All the more reason, John thought, to get their son out of there as soon as humanly possible. John had no doubt that, having been left behind with so little explanation and cruelly (and possibly slightly woundingly to his manhood) outrun, Benson would show up at their location in the not too distant future. Hopefully, John found himself praying, flanked by some armed officers and possibly a disgruntled and slightly ruffled Lestrade.
for fear of creating a spark which ignited them. He'd all but waded through the bogs of anger and boiling rage, and now he found himself consumed by a fog of raw and unrelenting
John spun around on the spot, his face suddenly contorted by an expression that Sherlock could not place; disgust? Rage?
“What the bloody hell are you doing here?” John asked, still disbelieving. “Christ, Benson it's been what...”
with stopping anyone reading such classic prices of literature, even for such a reason as to ensure Hamish's exam success.
Hamish groaned as he came to, as teenagers do when they’re woken up against their will, or made to do anything in fact.
“Interesting hypothesis”, Hamish acknowledged, looking up at him. “But wrong I'm afraid. At least to an extent. Are you seriously telling me you buy into the 'two typologies' crap? Murderers don't all fit into one of two categories, Greg.”
George blinked several times, opening his mouth briefly before forcing it closed again before he could stammer a humiliatingly weak response. He quickly collected himself, however. “Afghanistan.” Hamish nodded, as if to confirm that he thought as such. “Bugger me. That was feckin' fantastic, if you'll pardon m' French.”
There really is no excuse for how late this chapter is, so my apologies. It is, however, a relatively long chapter so hopefully that will make up for it? Please don't come to my door with pitchforks and flaming torches.
. Whoever our culprit is, they aren't adept at this.” Hamish zoomed in on the images slightly, levelling them side by side for comparison. “See, the bruising is inconsistent between victims; messy and brutal killings, but the state of damage to the bodies decreases by the time you get to the third victim. Like he's getting more practised.”
“Ah. Well, actually I was about to come and get you.” He moves to the doorway, most of his body now out of shot, just one foot remaining visible as he calls up the stairs to John. “Dad! Hurry up and get down here!” Sherlock has noticed the camera by now and looks squarely down the lens, cocking his head slightly.
Benson's fingers flew across the keys once more, before a message flashed upon on the screen indicating that he had been granted access. “We're in!” he said triumphantly, before typing in the coordinates of the search area. Sure enough, there was a missing person reported in that 5 mile radius in the last 5 days. George pulled up the file on screen, and the entirety of the Watson-Holmes family had congregated behind him. The missing person's report depicted a middle aged man, 36 years of age, with close-cut dark hair and dark stubble dappling his chin. “Martin Bridges,” Benson read aloud. “Reported missing 5 days ago after he failed to pick up his five year old daughter from Chisenhale Primary School.”
Hamish glanced at it and then back at his Dad, the desperate hope and anticipation burning in those startling blue eyes. A small nod from John followed,and the letter was opened and read.
Here they were again, the air crackling with the static of silence around them. When Sherlock eventually roused himself from his reclusive thoughts a minute or so later, he smiled tightly; a smile that struggled to permeate his gaze.
“It's not the words”, George said from beside him, apparently sensing his old Captain's confusion. “It's the blessing. It's the one I used when...” he took a breath, “when we were still trying.”
“Thinking” he responded simply. John heard an intake of breath and saw the shadow in the window tense. “I owe you both a thousand apologies.”
They followed as Hamish was wheeled from theatre, to a private ward. John assumed it was Mycroft's doing. Mycroft would have known, John didn't know, or even care, how he knew, he was just grateful that he did. There was a small basin in the corner of the room and John silently approached it as nurses worked on connecting Hamish up to drips and machines. He violently scrubbed at his hands, closing his eyes to save himself from the sight of the water running red with the blood which had caked his hands. Hamish's blood.
He had gently prized the notebook and pencil from Hamish’s limp grasp as he’d sat down. Curious, he leafed through the sketches within. Page after page were sketches of aircraft, some which Benson recognized form his time on the front line; Typhoon jets, Chinook helicopters, others which were older than his lifetime but their position in British military history making them known to him: the Spitfire, Lancaster Bomber.  He made a mental note of this for later. He had some favours he could call in, and this kid hadn’t had much of an 18
Across from them, Sherlock was lounged back in a chair, his gangly legs propped up on the desk, tapping away impatiently at the keys on his phone. He huffed irritably. “Are we getting anywhere?”
left his lips. In that moment the pieces of the puzzle that were the Holmes boy adjusted and manoeuvred to accommodate each other, not quite harmonising, but co-existing, and George Benson had seen and heard all he needed to. He had not completed his day's work, in fact he had not even started it. He left that unremarkable school soon after the remarkable boy. He'd placed the look in the boy's eyes, and there was no mistaking it, and that was how he found himself at 221B Baker street.
day he had ahead of him. He was certain Sherlock would have objected to John's insistence that he go to school. Evidently he was wrong. The disappointment actually stung. He grimaced to himself: the thought of spending the day listening to endless drivel about making the 'right choices' and 'leaving your options open' and 'formulating a career path' was almost physically painful. He could already feel the headache coming on. As he boarded the next train to pull up at the platform, his phone buzzed in his pocket.
“And where have you been?” Sherlock rose from his seat and turned his back to head towards the window. His silhouette filled the window frame, the dark shadow almost ghost-like. He remained silent. “Sherlock” John added in a warning tone.
Hamish gave a sad smile, a smile that screamed of how underserving of that love he felt radiating from his Dad. He swallowed thickly.
even, when Sherlock expressed his anger. He tried to banish the thought, but he couldn't help being plagued by the minuscule devil of possibility that, previously, Hamish had considered his anger a price worth paying for Sherlock's pride...
In which Hamish visits his first proper murder scene, and is thrown in at the deep end with a case inherently more intriguing than Sherlock had expected.
“Someone who simply inspires you to be the best version of yourself you can be, that’s the true meaning of hero”. He paused, smiling warmly before continuing. “Now, I’m no detective, but even I can tell where your heart really lies.” He gently replaced the sketchbook he’d removed earlier into Hamish’s hands. “Maybe you should start listening to it.”
Part of John was yearning to see him, to hold and to soothe him, and still, there was a part of him that knew he couldn't face Sherlock just yet. He was torn between worrying about whether he'd end up pulling Sherlock out of a gutter somewhere in some shadowy corner of the city and telling himself that he was supposed to be angry beyond reason. Because he
John was left, staring blankly into the void he'd left, the empty Sherlock-sized space in the room. He swallowed, his throat tightening, before moving to take a seat at Hamish's beside. He mirrored Sherlock's action by taking hold of Hamish's right hand, and ran the pad of his thumb absently over his son's palm in a soothing motion. Quite whether he was trying to sooth himself or his son, he didn't care to dwell on. He looked back up, into the empty space where Sherlock had been stood, and whispered solemnly “I love you”, before burying his head into the hospital bed clothes and permitting a fresh, but silent, cascade of tears.
That was so painfully true that John almost couldn't stand for the weight of it on his shoulders. He'd left Benson behind once before, and it'd ended catastrophically for him, and now he'd gone through that all again. Another heavy sigh escaped John's lips as he ran his hands over his face. “I-”
John cast a glance to the empty space in the left side of the wheelchair, to the now asymmetrical appearance of Benson's lower half, to where his prosthetic had once been.
“I take full responsibility”, he mumbled simply. Sherlock had said this on occasion before; deadpan and sarcastic, but never with the words so achingly laden with self-loathing. John was struck with the full force of the magnitude of his mistake. Sherlock was truly blaming himself, wholly and fully, holding himself accountable for the near fatal condition their son was in. Why did John feel guilty? He had a right to be angry. He'd been betrayed and lied to, the man he loved and his own
John cleared his throat. “Enough on me, you’ve probably read it all on the blog anyway. Trust me you don’t want to hear any more about Sherlock, I’d be here all day reeling off his endless annoyances. Tell me about your wife.” John took another sip of his tea as he settled back into his chair slightly.
“So,” John began, hands curling around the warm ceramic. He couldn't have sounded more awkward, but just where did someone start when addressing a person they'd only ever known in a war zone? Sure, John had respected George – he was a promising young private, his head was screwed on and he was clued up – and he'd genuinely liked the guy, they'd got along well, but so much time had passed and they'd shared so many horrific memories. Was it really possible for a friendship to remain between them, the way it had, with so much guilt weighing on him? John had to be honest with himself and acknowledge the fact that he hadn’t really thought about George all that much over the last 20 years – life with Sherlock doesn’t allow a lot of time for quiet contemplation. But sometimes he’d think of him when he woke up from his nightmares; a flash of his face as he was slowly brought back into consciousness. One thing was certain though, John was bloody glad to see him. He hadn't realised how much he'd missed company that wasn’t Sherlock or Hamish. He
” Hamish descended the stairs, shoulders slumped slightly, and his satchel slung haphazardly over his shoulder. His school tie sat at a skewiff angle round his neck.
"We're so proud of you, 'Mish. But remember that offer is conditional upon you passing, so no more Shakespeare!" He chided mockingly, wagging his finger.
John shook his head, giggling. “Best not to go there.” Benson gave a knowing smile, he could see the look of pure warmth and adoration in John’s eyes. He’d already observed the way his eyes seemed to light up whenever Sherlock’s name was mentioned. It was refreshing to see an old comrade so happy, previous reunions had never gone so well. But John was happy, he’d built a life for himself, and George found himself thanking every deity he could fathom for the blessing of seeing his Captain Watson so contently settled. He thanked them for the blessing of Sherlock Holmes for making him that way.
. He almost wanted them to have an argument about Sherlock's apparent disregard for his own health; he wanted Sherlock to tell him how much of a waste of time sleep was, John wanted to retaliate and plead with Sherlock to at least get a few hours for the sake of his own sanity if nothing else. At least that would carry some element of normality. It'd be exhausting, but the right kind of exhausting. It'd be impossible and irritating, but anything was better than how emotionally strenuous Sherlock's current state was. John hated it. It wasn't Sherlock.
The camera is jostled once more as it's snatched from Hamish's hands, and John's beaming face fills the screen. “Shame, we'll just have to invite her over then. I'll be sure to send an invitation along with the tape.” The image blurs slightly as John runs with the camera, Hamish just visible over his shoulder in hot pursuit as he rounds the corner into the kitchen. “Happy Birthday, Léa!”, John adds finally, his laughter mingling with Sherlock's to drown out Hamish's resigned sigh as the camera is switched off.
“The News.” Sherlock responded without missing a beat. It would do no good to contest John on this matter – Hamish had to go to school today – John was always extraordinary stubborn concerning their son's attendance. It was frightfully boring of him, and most inconvenient, especially on those days when Hamish's presence on a case would prove valuable.
Hamish nodded. “Exactly. If they'd had a knife, they would have stabbed the victims to death – far easier and less draining than beating them with their bare hands. So, we're left to draw the conclusion that the carvings were made with the sharpest object they could gain access to; most likely a piece of broken plastic. Their blood was drawn from the force with which they had to grip it.” Hamish clasped his hands together and clenched his fists to demonstrate.
and he couldn't bear it. Hamish couldn't either. Anger, he knew how to deal with – letting his Dad cool off before apologising and ensuring him that he loved him – he could cope with that. Parents were supposed to get angry and frustrated and infuriated with their kids, much like it was almost in the job description of the children to rebel and try their patience over and over again. But disappointment was a whole other ball game. Disappointment was wrought with complexities; it was thorny and difficult to navigate, and Hamish felt so utterly helpless being confronted with it. Anger was easy to reverse because it had a simple and polar opposite. To expel anger Hamish could simply install a state of calm, reinstate happiness and provide a reminder of just how much love he had to give his Dad, but what was the opposite of disappointment? Disappointment had a firm and icy grip, seizing and debilitating, and the object of its focus had no control or possession of a remedy.
my fault, Sherlock. It was yours.” The tears had ceased, but John's voice was trembling; shaking and quivering under the weight of the accusation it had just made. John knew he should stop, step back from the brink before he said something that pushed them both over, falling into a dark abyss of hastily flung insults and scolding words which they couldn't take back. The words, however, kept coming, burning like acid in John's mouth.
When the resultant casualty of the tragedy was your own flesh and blood, could you ever not punish yourself for not being able to protect them?
“Ah. Well, this is where it gets interesting.” Hamish's eyes were bright now, and he was alive with the blinding aura that always consumed Sherlock whenever he was dancing through a case like this. “They were all beaten pretty badly. The amount of bruising and broken bones would lead you to believe overkill...but the reality is the first victim was
It went unsaid, but they both knew what Lestrade had done for him, they both knew that Sherlock would forever be grateful, and they both knew he was too proud to admit it. Greg had made sacrifices for Sherlock, and Sherlock knew he had never once done a single thing to deserve it, but he did know that his son deserved every ounce of Lestrade's attention and adoration which came his way. That and more, because Hamish returned that sentiment. He was like Sherlock in that he often treated Lestrade like an idiot – deservedly so, mostly, because Lestrade
John reached across the table to take Sherlock's hand in his own. He gave it a light, reassuring squeeze and offered a soft smile. “It's you too, you know. 18 years ago I wouldn't have said the same but...” he took a long drag of air before continuing. “That humanity is as much from you as it is me, Sherlock.”
“Hey.” he said, acknowledging George’s presence. His voice was croaky, and his throat was dry. George poured some water from the plastic jug at Hamish’s bedside, which Hamish accepted gratefully.
“Organised offender.” Lestrade piped up. “They position the body; murders are usually well thought out.”
John couldn't help but feel strangely at ease with the scene before him. Sherlock, their son, and his old army friend all working feverishly at a lead to try and identify their killer...or should that be victim. Hamish was watching, slightly awestruck, over George's shoulder as he frantically typed away on Hamish's laptop. Hamish had used DRAGNET to identify a 5 mile radius of the probable location of the man they were looking for, much to Sherlock's disgust. He'd declared geographical profiling a 'primitive waste of time'. And now, Private George Benson was 'forcibly accessing' Scotland Yard's missing persons database in search of someone living in that area who'd gone missing just prior to the first murder, who was a potential candidate for the unfortunate forced killer.
Something about today had Hamish on edge, something about today had Hamish dreading the possibility of even finishing his breakfast judging by his laboured chewing.
Sherlock smirks. “Hello, Léa” he begins, sitting up to lean towards the camera slightly. “Hamish says you're a fan, I must begin by commending your taste. However, what I really want to say is Happy Birthday!” His smile is sickly sweet, and Hamish throws him an accusatory stare. He's evidentially not convinced of Sherlock's sincerity. “Finally, I'd just like to point out how painfully obvious it is that Hamish here has an enormously large infatuation with you.”
to be irritated, but the clean taught line of his son's shoulders made this impossible; there was a tension there he couldn't explain. Something had shifted in Hamish in recent weeks, as his 18
