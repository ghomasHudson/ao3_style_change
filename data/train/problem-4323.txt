He paused for a moment, as if he was weighing his options, but shook his head. “Can’t. I have to return to work.”
“And he didn’t,” he assured him. “It wasn’t Dean. I just had a moment of—that wasn’t—we were both into it. It seemed so…but before I—we got interrupted. Someone walked in on us.”
But they also talked. They circled on topics about the ranch, but it happened once or twice that they accidentally dwelled on subjects involving the summer. Or Castiel’s birthday. Or a next potential destination they could visit. It would never be for very long and they would quickly change the subject.
It wouldn’t have been a problem, save for the fact that the place was screaming health codes violations.
But it wasn’t. I just told you Davies was a good guy. Castiel and Dean had a bit of trouble believing this, however.
Dean nodded, pondering on the matter. “You’re probably right.” Then after a moment, he said, “I am looking forward to Dad’s ridiculous eggnog.”
Clear as day. He lifted his phone to show Dean. “If that’s you I’ve been talking with all this time, how the hell do you explain this?”
“You say you’re not engaged,” he added urgently. “Assuming that’s true, doesn’t change the fact that you don’t actually live here.”
Petty theft to survive. Due to anger. Frustration. Not knowing the real consequences because nobody had ever told him where they could truly lead. After all, it wasn’t that far off from Dean’s own origin story into shady work. It had just taken him longer than Castiel to get there.
And then Castiel, who, unlike Dean, was absolutely composed and wanted to ask the real questions, said, “Do you always sleep that peacefully all the time?”
Castiel took a deep breath. “Look, I’m not trying to be above the rules, I just—” and then he stopped talking all together and decided that none of this was worth it.
Sam cleared his throat. He dressed himself quickly, despite still feeling shaky. As he was putting on his shirt, his eyes fell on the nightstand to the right. The side where Sam had been sleeping. There was a large glass of water and his phone.
Crowley lifted himself from his throne and stepped down his little steps, keeping his focus on Dean—for dramatic effect, of course. “If it’s the business with Empress Amara you want to deal with, I can help. I can also help with each of your current
“Dad, um. I would. I mean, I can tomorrow, but it’s just—I made plans tonight. I’m going out with Lisa.”
And if Maggie, Jack’s best friend, and her family hadn’t moved to a different state in the middle of the summer, Castiel was convinced that some of the nosy parents—or anyone who seemed to have an opinion—wouldn’t have commented on Jack’s so-called unusual behavior regarding Belphegor.
“Sam, just—you and Cas have been weird since the moment I walked into the library. You have been the whole way back.”
And even though Dean never finished his sentence, Castiel didn’t need to hear it. He knew what Dean had meant to say.
“It’s done,” she told him. “Castiel is under my care and I say he’s good for it. Thank you for you time, Mr. Novak. We will contact you for more details, but for now, let’s just say we will see you back here in six months time.”
Dean lifted his eyes and shook his head. Castiel wasn’t sure where to nudge the conversation from this point on. He didn’t want to grill Dean on his family members’ deaths this early on, particularly when Dean evidently wasn’t overly open to it.
Wow. This took a little longer than I had anticipated. But it's here! Thank you for your patience! Hopefully the next one won't take this long 😊
That last comment might have been too much for Dean, as he started launching at Patrick, who didn’t move a muscle, feeling completely unthreatened by him.
So, hoping his neighbour was as forgiving as he claimed to be, Dean immediately marched to his door to thank him and properly apologize.
“No running in the stairs!” warned Castiel gently. He then turned to Dean and said, “You don’t have to if you don’t want to.”
Although both parents remained quiet, Sam could feel John’s stare on both of them. He knew his father was studying them with attention, which meant that if Sam tried anything too obvious, John would immediately weigh in.
But if what Anna had told him was true, he didn’t want to fuck it up. And he had no idea what to say to him. What to ask. What to keep to himself.
If he was to be left completely isolated from everybody for more than a month, he wasn’t sure he would be able to tough it out for the rest of his vacation. While he was convinced that he could never grow tired of the serenity the place offered, eventually the need to see a friendly face would no doubt become vital.
But before Sam could say anything, Dean said, “Sam didn’t do anything. He wasn’t around the car all day."
Castiel took a deep breath and stretched his arms and his back, suddenly feeling a wave of fatigue. He stood up, grabbed his backpack and said, pointing at the doors, “Which one is the bathroom? Actually, can you tell me which one is my room too? I’ll just drop my stuff if you don’t mind.”
“He won’t be happy about it,” said Sam, smiling. “He’ll be rethinking why he didn’t have the bunk beds, that’s for sure.”
“But it wasn’t—nothing had been leading to this,” Castiel pressed on. “It wasn’t like we had been pining away in our corners. Or had made a questionable decision due to life trauma or heavy drinking. It just happened. And it wasn’t weird. Neither of us freaked out the next morning. We remained the same. I don’t want to say it was meaningless, because it wasn’t, far from it, but I—I don’t know how to explain it.”
But Sam, as it turned out, hadn’t been satisfied with a simple text. While he hadn’t called his brother a liar, he had demanded proof of everything Dean had told him, not in the goal of teasing him—although that was inevitable—but rather because he wanted to make sure Dean wasn’t on his own and miserable and that he was simply telling them this when it wasn’t true.
So, once Naomi was reassured that everyone, especially her nephews, had no objection with this arrangement, she accepted with the promise that she owed Mary, Mr. Redfield and Mrs. Middleton a favor for their kindness.
For safety measure, they opted to set the tree in between the bed and the booth, so it would be in the dead center between the stove and fireplace.
Sam sighed, and even though he was slightly aggravated by his brother’s stubbornness, he went to help him after settling both dogs on the back seat, and soon enough, they managed to make everything fit, without squashing the desserts and other baked goods they had gotten for their parents at their requests.
A fact that, oddly enough, Castiel had found himself forgetting at times, given how close he felt to Michael. Aware that it was somewhat unusual, even in a digital age, Castiel had never been bothered by it, however.
Castiel, after stealing a few minutes to study him sleeping, slid himself off the bed as delicately as possible, keeping his eyes on Dean, making sure to not wake him. The floor was dreadfully cold, so he put on a pair of thick sleepers and hurried to the bathroom, quiet as a mouse.
But the way Dean had told his story, how he hadn’t been so keen on sharing it, not because it was private, but rather because he sounded ashamed of it, that distressed Castiel deeply.
Knowing that Samuel’s culinary skills, though efficient, were nothing to brag about, Dean was then really glad to have stopped at
He caught Dean glancing at him on multiple occasions, which always gave him a hint that something very important and dramatic was about to unfold in the next scene.
After the word had been given out of an intrusion, many employees who lived on the premises decided to pair up and scan the surrounding in case they would find anyone suspicious.
“They didn’t venture too far after that. They just stayed on the patio taking in the sun. Listening to really annoying music, but yeah.”
While they argued that if the trio had gone through all the trouble of luring them to a showdown once more, they would probably wait for them before beginning whatever it was that they were scheming about.
Ketch sat himself at the corner of the desk, and after a short pause, he said coldly, “Lady Bevell, Mr. Davies, let’s move on to the interview.”
“Yeah. We talked about it for a long time. We kept changing what we were planning on getting. When I left for college, which at the time we had settled on a lyric—I will not tell you which one—”
But Dean remained still. His eyes then shifted towards Sam, who nodded to him. But Dean stayed quiet.
Dean was eyeing him like he was trying to read his mind. Sam found consolation in the fact that at least he wasn’t ignoring him anymore.
And by the following year, they exchanged Christmas gifts as husbands, in the coziness of their own home in Chicago, where Sam and Jessica were their guests, as well as other friends celebrating with them.
After their meal, because it was still early in the evening, they went out for a walk to explore the hotel. While the outdoor pool was evidently closed because of the season, the indoor pool wasn’t and Castiel instantly added it to his to-do list during their stay. They also walked by the other two restaurants of the hotel and agreed that they should eat there as well before leaving on Sunday.
“Gabe! What the hell!” Castiel held his hand over his chest. “You almost gave me a heart attack. What are you doing here?”
Jack had a go with the saucer sled as well, and because it spinned, he ended up sliding backwards for most of the slide, looking at Whiskey running behind him. And Castiel heard him laugh the entire way down, as they were next to him, on the toboggan.
After their heart-to-heart, Sam and Dean then pursued discussing more joyful matters, such as the town’s gossip.
“For real estate reasons, we were told. He practically handed us the handbook for ‘how to steal a car.’ It was easy money, so of course, me and a couple of my friends were dumb enough to fall for it.”
I have layers! I know it’s very easy to be fooled by my charmingly mellow appearance, but I’m deep,” he said, feigning being insulted.
There were murmurs of excitement within the crowd. And Dean felt Castiel fidget on his feet next to him.
He carefully listened. Adamantly ignoring the pang he felt in his chest, he then shifted on his feet, took a deep breath, and braced himself to knock.
Dean shut his eyes tight at Sue-Ann’s voice. He silently cursed himself for having let his guard down for a moment and slowly turned around to face her.
“In a quiet town like this one, it’s awesome,” said Richie. “So, on that Saturday night, we got this great country band, which I have no idea what it was called,” he turned to Dean for assistance, but he shook his head, not remembering the name either. “The crowd loves it. Loads of people. It’s late. Most of them are somewhat tipsy.”
By only using his thumb and index, Castiel took hold of Dean’s cock, right underneath the head. With a mild pressure, he stroked Dean’s cock.
And although that fact also brought Castiel some worry, he nonetheless was grateful to have found shelter, as the wind was biting by the time they had reached his door. Much like the other cabins he had observed on their path, Dean’s cabin was square and rustic, with small windows—to help with insulation, thought Castiel—and no civic number or a mailbox. It did appear to be larger and higher than some of the other cabins, however.
Dean gave out another moan that resonated through Castiel’s entire body, making his cock twitch. Dean, despite being overwhelmed, sat up as best he could and gently pulled Castiel by his arms, lifting him to his feet, and causing him to let go of him.
They stared at each other for a moment, and just as Lucifer was taking a step forward, thundering was heard and the ground shook, so much that all three of them momentarily lost their balance. Chandeliers swung up above their heads, and some of the instruments on the tables slid to the ground.
She nodded amicably. “If he comes back though, I’ll make sure to tell him you stopped by asking for him. And I’ll tell him to call you,” she assured him.
“Just wait a minute,” Sam told Dean and lowered his phone. “Bela didn’t say anything. I—my brother works with a guy named Castiel back in Lawrence, and—long story short, he recommended this place once he learned I lived in Chicago.”
“I—the truth is that—Cas, I—this whole week has been a mess. I went out with Lisa and it wasn’t—it felt off. My mind—I wasn’t into it, and—”
Processing what had just happened, Dean was craving for Castiel’s thoughts. Besides straitening his jacket, his general composure and face were unreadable to Dean. And while he knew that asking him—or speaking, really—would be a good place to start, it seemed that he was rendered completely speechless in that moment.
They continued exchanging long lingering looks, until Sam said, “So? What is it, then? What’s your favourite Christmas movie? I’m curious now.”
“I know I shouldn’t have favourites, but I always liked you best. You’ve always been the kindest of my brothers.”
“Lucifer’s grace. He won’t be able to harm anyone anymore. Well, he’ll still be a pain in the ass, but not to this scale.” Castiel walked over to Dean and handed him the bottle.
And the fact that Castiel was realizing this—just now—was not a reassuring thought for him. He might have not neglected his son, but his lack of focus made him feel guilty.
But Castiel was smiling. “It’s okay, Dean. We’re okay.” He paused a moment, and then said, “I did many things for the Garrisons that I—you can’t erase that. And saying I never wanted to do it and that I deeply regret having done so, is not enough. Which was a problem when Dr. Hess came into power. But since they judged me sensible enough, and were also fully aware of my so-called skills, and my knowledge of the Garrisons, they gave me a chance to…plead my case, I suppose.”
Gabriel burst into laughter. “You think this is extravagant. Dean, trust me, I’m going easy on you. Remember your earlier outfits? Or should I say, lack thereof?”
“Okay,” said Dean, letting the information sink in. “Okay, but even if—if that’s true, that still doesn’t explain why you left.”
Dean was examining the list of the prisoners on the monitor, while Castiel, wearing his breastplate and trench coat, was studying the witness accounts more closely.
Castiel turned to his side. “I don’t want to be disappointed, and I feel like I will be.” He pulled up his covers all the way to his chin and turned on his back again, letting out a sigh.
“There. Does that help?” said Gordon. “Bring me my money or I’ll do way more than break his arm. And Dean? I’m seriously getting impatient. Don’t let me get bored with poor Sammy here as my sole distraction.”
As he listened to Dean, Castiel was once more hit with a rush of relief and that he had accepted Dean’s proposal.
Just past an hour after Dean’s arrival though, Castiel noticed Dean had finally woken up, and was now seated at the edge of the pool, his feet dipped in the water.
I am aware how confusing this must be. I assure you, I am fully serious with my intentions and mean it as a service to help you, as well as a favor to me.
There was one, but it was faint. Very faint. I rested my hand on Sam’s chest and could feel his heart beating.
“Anna is right. It was just what the evening needed. It’s quite a pity that Gabriel did not grant us his presence,” said Amara. “I ought to have a serious discussion with this boy about what he owes this family.”
Jessica remained silent and looked at Gabriel, when Sam finally clued in. “I’m sorry, Jess. This is Gabel—I mean, Gabriel. He’s Cas’ brother.”
Therefore, an agreement came to pass between Leader Singer and Dr. Hess, the representative of the BMoL, who demanded repercussion for the loss of their precious cargo.
“Okay,” said Chuck. He shifted on his feet. “There is a lot I’d like to say about this, but considering you’ll simply overthink everything I say, I’ll simply ask: Why did you come to the conclusion of joining them if you suspect it might only be a ploy by me?”
Castiel smirked at the corner of his mouth. He blew him a kiss as a pleasantry and Dean made a face of exasperation because he was like a twelve year old who didn’t know what to do with himself.
“Yeah.” And then, wishing to change the subject, Sam cleared his throat and asked Dean what had occurred when he had asked Castiel out.
“As for the blog, I only closed the mailbox because it was honestly getting out of control. Over the last few weeks, I was able to answer more letters due to my free time. At first it was great because I was catching up on things. But then it appeared that my productivity ironically created more demands. The more replies a day I posted, the more messages I was receiving and—that’s why I had to close it. I’m glad I had the good sense of leaving the comment section open though…I just never expected that it would take me so long to return here. Or that you’d…I—I’m so sorry.”
“If that’s what it takes,” said Castiel, and he swung the sheets off of him, letting Dean see for himself, and rested his hands behind his head, as if he was lying in a hammock.
Thankfully, getting the key codes had not been a hassle. They showed up in some dodgy bar ( most of the establishments in that station consisted of dives) and met Kip, Crowley’s inside man on Turbulentus. He subtly handed them one key card, and explained they would simply need to wave it at the entrance panel of the Levis’s HQ.
“I’m older than I look,” she said, amused. “And we had a mutual friend in common. I used to work with Mr. Winchester. A very long time ago. It’s a long story, but I’ve known Henry all my life. In a way, I suppose I could say I owe him my first employment, even.”
“A pretty good idea. But, better than that, I know someone who knows without a doubt where to find Lucifer.”
Castiel observed his brother more attentively for a second. Something had been bugging him about his appearance since the moment he had barged into the room and Castiel hadn’t been able to figure out what it was.
“Quite so. And that’s why I made sure my car was stored properly when I acquired it a few years ago.”
“Unimpressive, I must say. The gates of heaven were shut, like you had stated they might be, so I went to the portal—the sandbox you spoke of—and from there…well, it was disappointing.”
The road leading to town was empty and quiet as ever, and though it was still taking him nearly an hour before finally arriving at his destination, he at least noticed an improvement with his physical state over the last week.
So, he hid himself in his house and attempted as best he could to not spend his time being angry with himself.
And even though everything Dean had said made perfect sense, it still had not solved Castiel’s problem.
You’d think all this would have been sufficient enough for people to actually notice who was standing in front of them, but no. You’re giving these people far too much credit. And the few who had noticed—yes, some had—didn’t care in the least, as I know for a fact that every, um,
Castiel truly hoped it would be the latter, and given she had been kind enough to come and visit, he believed it conveyed Hannah’s view of the situation.
Sam shook his head. “He’ll come to us. He will want to know where Cas is, especially if he’s—especially to see if he’s with someone else.”
“All right, Dean. Here’s the thing. Like I told you before, this is quite the predicament you’ve found yourself in. I don’t think I need to tell you that.”
Not long after their brief exchange, Dean grudgingly drove off, leaving Castiel quite stunned by his attitude. He replayed their encounter in his mind as he settled himself slowly into the lake-house, and although he hoped it was simply a big misunderstanding, Castiel nonetheless promised himself to try anew and apologize on his return.
Without looking at his father, he buckled his seat belt and said, with the greatest effort and misery to not break down, “He doesn’t want to talk to me.”
“I’m sorry, Dean. But like I told you earlier, I don’t think it’s necessarily a lost cause. You might have to wait a little longer, but I really don’t think you should give up. The New Year is coming up. That usually brings a change in perspective for a lot people. And in any case, I actually think that a few days away from this, a change of scenery, might be a good thing for you.”
“Nothing, Cas,” he repeated, feeling his chest tightening. “They drove by, didn’t slow down until they reached their driveway. Parked. And they immediately went inside the house. That’s it. They didn’t linger. They didn’t suspiciously look around or—nothing weird happened.”
“Not exactly what I was hoping for. But thank you.” He lifted his head and moved his hand to grab it. But Castiel recoiled his hand and stared at Dean, amused. After a second of confusion, Dean opened his mouth slightly. Eyes locked on one another, Castiel brought the fruit to his lips and slid it in between his lips. He let Dean chew on it for a second, and then gave him a quick kiss, tasting his lips.
The clip changed once more to another boy who was sitting at a table, eyeing his bowl and his spoon. His eyes turned, as if he was looking at someone off screen, and then he refocused his gaze on his bowl. He tapped his fingers right next to the spoon, but didn’t touch it. He could move, but he was still not grabbing that spoon. Even though it was clear in his eyes, which kept glancing off screen every ten seconds out of frustration, that this was precisely what he wanted to do. He lifted his hand, and just as he was about to grab the spoon, he froze, and let his hand drop right next to the spoon.
Castiel held his serious stare as long as he could, long enough to discern panic in Dean’s eyes, until he wasn’t able to suppress his smile anymore.
And even though the sun had set, Dean could still discern an astonishing amount of greenery. More than he had ever noticed in the city.
No matter how much he wanted to, he knew that not a single word would come out of his mouth if he attempted this conversation with his friend at that very moment. Lessening the guilt would hopefully give him sufficient amount of courage to confess.
They both turned, surprised to see the entire group of the bachelorette party waiting by their side.
For the time being, it seemed that Castiel was granting him some needed space. Pleading eyes had been his only retaliation. No more ambush. No more knocking on his door. Or even notes left on his doormat.
A soft bell rang announcing new customers coming through the door as a small group of teenage girls made their way to the counter. Jessica was one of them and she stopped dead the second she saw Sam. She waved and smiled shyly at him, which prompted Sam to reply with a smile as well. She hurried down the line with her friends, whispering to them. Sam returned to his sub, only to realize that Gabriel was staring at him with the biggest grin on his face.
“If you’re not pulling extra hours at the garage, you mean? Which I’m guessing you’re already doing in the mornings during the weekends? Am I right?”
They observed one another for a long moment, until Dean cautiously stepped closer. Castiel felt Dean’s warm fingers brush his.
Dean glared at Sam with a piercing look as though he was trying to read his mind. Sam, nearly frightened, observed his brother for a moment. He looked at his eyes. Dean wasn’t mad. This wasn’t angry or annoyed Dean.
“I’m really glad to hear that, but you’re allowed to not be fine, Sam. That was really messed up. And I—like I said before, I’m sure you have a lot of questions.”
a game that Jack was heavily dominating both of them, claiming that he was aided by Belphegor’s strategy, they set up for an early dinner.
“Now that I know who your friend is, I promise we’ll say hello later,” she had said to him, smiling.
With the bright sun coming through the wall of windows directly to Castiel’s left, the living room area, the dining room, and most of the kitchen, which were all in one big open space, were illuminated and warm.
With shaky legs, Dean did as he was told. He sat in the driver’s seat and Castiel sat in the back seat, as always.
“All right,” she said, sighing. “Well, thank you for trusting me with this. I hope it will get better. But know that we have your back here, okay?”
“Pfff. It’s fine,” he said, waving his hand at him. “Actually, you kinda did me a service. Something
So, not random, thought Dean. It was no wonder then, why Isaac and his wife had changed neighborhoods after that.
The next chapter is shorter than the others, but that means it will be posted very soon. (like in a couple of days top). I think it will lift your spirits ;)
“So, before you offered us your trip, Jess and I had a three day weekend planned in almost a week from now. But since we just came back from an amazing trip, we feel kind of silly to just leave for another one right away. I mean, don’t think we would be above the idea, obviously, but anyway, we thought since you guys gave us your trip, we think it’s only fair we do the same with ours.”
“Because you don’t have a choice?” suggested Gabriel. “Because you’re Sam freaking Winchester, it’s the ‘right’ thing to do and all that hero complex thing?”
“Yes, you came here to talk, as you said. Is this the part where you say, ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend?’”
“Fuck. That’s not why we’re here, douchebag!” barked Dean. “We’re here because you—wait,” he said briskly. “Auntie?
More furious than ever, Dean, after sliding his chair and himself away from the table to facilitate his task, began untying his boots.
He poured the pot’s contents at the base of the archway and adequately placed the few twigs to facilitate a fire. Satisfied of the presentation, he then added the slice of pie and the scraps. He lit a match, made sure the flame caught the twig, and took a step back, shut his eyes and cleared his mind.
And just as their tongues touched, after Dean had smoothly slid the tip of his tongue onto Castiel’s lips, Dean then slowed down and kissed his chin. And jawline.
Sam turned to Castiel. “You know that the only reason she made those is because you’re here, right?”
My mischievous smile grew. “Noted. I’ll make sure to add more next time,” I said, continuing running my finger through his hair. “What else?”
And unlike Castiel, he hadn’t just ended a long-term relationship not even two nights ago. Not to mention the little morning kiss episode Castiel had sadly witnessed.
“Hold on,” I said, lifting my finger. “Before we get to that, we have other details to discuss. If you want to storm in there, you’re going to need more than just us three.”
Finally aboard the ship, away from additional harm, the moment my feet touched the ground, many people rushed towards us, eager to help Sam.
He didn’t even protest. He thanked her and headed straight back to the house, only to find himself even more depressed once he was on his own in a big empty house. He sat on the couch and did nothing but look ahead of him for a really long time, until he heard, “Cas?”
And they both chuckled. Sam took care of the coffees, while Gabriel examined more attentively what was on Sam’s coffee table in front of him.
And after a pregnant pause, the Boy King said, “Satisfied with my answer? Was that you wanted to hear?”
“Cas!” he yelled again, waving his hand as he walked towards them. Sam immediately sat up straighter and briefly fixed his hair, while Castiel was looking at his brother with a mild exasperation. Indifferent to being shushed heavily by the librarian, Gabriel came to a halt once he reached their table.
“Yes. No horses, either,” she said, smiling. “Nothing strenuous. Basically, take it easy for the next few days. Especially the next forty-eight hours.”
“You see, there was a reason why I was picked to be King Michael’s warrior. It wasn’t a random decision.”
“‘Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,’” the music conductor said. “Would that be fine with you, Mr. Milton?”
He was a little more specific regarding some details, however. Like how incredibly crowded the restaurant had been. And how keeping the door open for everyone to exit had resulted with him getting rammed into by a couple of brawny men dashing impatiently through the crowd.
He also wasn’t stupid and knew that Castiel and Dean had nothing to do with Purgatory and that they were most likely victims of circumstance.
“Not here, Dean. I’m working,” she whispered, but just then, they both heard the doorbell, signaling that her only costumer had left the shop.
He was tempted to check his phone to see if Hannah had replied. He had been rather occupied since he had texted her, which had left no opportunity to verify.
She stood up and hauled her purse on her shoulder. She stuck her hands in her coat pockets, and looked at him directly.
Sam gaped at him. “That’s…embarrassing,” he said, running one hand over his face. “I feel like I have to apologize.”
Children, Uncle Crowley was right. I’m happy to say that Dean got over himself, listened to him and took the damn blaster.
Once upon a time, maybe Castiel had thought that the prospect of being Dean’s roommate was a pleasant idea. But now, considering that simply spending time with Dean was causing him emotional pain, Castiel wasn’t so sure that was the case anymore.
to arrive to his own party, I will speak on his behalf for now. As you know, we love celebrating this holiday and it means a great deal to us that so many of you were inclined to share it with us. Thank you, for granting us your presence tonight.”
Seriously rethinking his motives for being there, Dean did as he was told, knowing full well that storming out of that room would help no one, least of all himself.
Dean took a moment to weigh his words. Since Samuel’s comment had been rather vague with no mention of the Garrisons per se, Dean decided that he should follow his lead on that matter.
And no longer able to resist, Dean gently nudged him towards the bed, with which Castiel was happy to comply.
Dean reflected on what Castiel had told him for an instant. “If that’s the case, Cas, why didn’t you say anything about it after that? When the guards caught you. Arrested you. Why didn’t you say anything about the other assailant? About your powers and when I visited—fuck, why?”
Dean, having been busy the entire day with Castiel and Jack, hadn’t had much time to look at his phone and answer calls or reply to texts—the many worried texts Sam had sent him due to Dean’s lack of replies.
Castiel: My shift ends at the same time as last night. I’ll head straight home afterwards. Can we talk then?
“You know that bakery on Lazarus Street?” Castiel was scrolling on his phone, checking for opening hours. “They probably make the best pies in town. Maybe I—I could bring one for Dean.”
And soon enough, they met at the car, where Dean added Castiel’s items in the trunk with the cooler he had brought.
He suggested dropping everyone off in front of the house and meeting them back there, after finding a proper parking spot for Baby. He felt like a complete asshole saying “See you inside” to Lisa, when he was relieved at the prospect of finally being away from her.
And once more, after a quiet ride, they reached their destination, and Castiel repeated his instructions to Dean, took a deep breath and left the car, heading towards a large—but run-down—commercial building.
“So, here is what’s going to happen. I don’t care how you got this money, but you’re gonna go back to them, and bring me more. Every week, you’re gonna crawl back here, and give me my dues for having thought you could double cross me, or Sammy is gonna have more broken bones.”
Zachariah’s assistant apologized to have made him come all this way and hurriedly showed him the door, telling him that their appointment would most likely take place on the next day.
He took a deep breath. “It’s with pesto chicken. Extra cheese. Mushroom and zucchinis.  Bacon on one side only. Italian spices. Thin crust. And, um, the sauce is Alfredo.”
Castiel examined Dean’s state attentively as he pondered on his request. His state had considerably improved. He was no longer panting or trembling. He was speaking in full sentences. There was still a faint, yet detectable waver in his voice, however.
And at night, in his bed and listening to the wind brushing against trees, he slowly drifted into sleep, recalling the way Castiel’s deep voice was pronouncing his name.
Henriksen nodded, as his grin grew wider still. “True. If we go back further than that, we might get more interesting stuff. I mean, how can it not be?” he said, pointing at the frame. “The thing, though, is that we don’t really need to, because just that there—that one frame—that’s enough. That’s the money shot. You see, Dean, as you correctly guessed earlier, I’m here on behalf of Empress Amara. She summoned you, and like a capricious little boy, you said ‘No’ and ran away. She’s not happy. So, now I have the shitty job of tracking your ass down. It’s been my job for a while now. All this pointless chasing you around to bring you back to her…I nearly went nuts.” He turned to one of his men. “Tell him, Lee, how I nearly went nuts.”
He had no idea where he was. He had no idea how he had gotten there. He had no idea who was restraining him. Or why they were restraining him.
“So, where were you?” asked Sam, once Dean had dropped his phone on the nightstand and had slid himself under the covers. “It’s later than usual. And a weekday.”
“Dean, no—wait,” pleaded Sam. He had jumped to his feet, fearing the outcome. But Dean didn’t get to act on his anger. In fact, he hadn’t even been able to stand up. His footwear—stiletto boots—had caused him issues with his balance and had forced him to remain seated.
“That’s very thoughtful,” said Mary. “We will be sure to try them.” She paused a moment, and then added, “Anything we can do to help with your errands?”
But Dean did not let him finish. “Cas, how about we start by getting breakfast ready and then deal with the world exploding if that’s the case?”
Trying not to knock over anything, he carefully made his way to the kitchen to pour himself a glass of water to leave next to him, so he wouldn’t have to walk on the cold floor during the night if he got thirsty.
more than a car with his driver. Since he had taken on new responsibilities, we hoped that by establishing new ground rules it would keep him in line. But it appears that old habits die hard.”
Starting with Deanmon, Sam and Jack were to subdue him, while Castiel and Dean would try to gain the upper hand on the other two, or at the very least, distract them long enough so Jack and Sam could apprehend Deanmon. And then they would move on to the Boy King, and at last, Godstiel.
That being said, Dean could make fun of Sam for his curiosity all he wanted, the fact was that he sure would like to know many answers to those questions himself.
Still holding the other bag, Dean said, “That’s the first half of your stupid money.” He slowly opened the bag, emptied its contents on the floor and let the bag fall on top of it.
“It’s not your fault. And anyway, it’s just a job for the holidays. No matter what it is, we both know the novelty would have worn off eventually.”
“At first, I was more focused on—but anyway.” Castiel cleared his throat briefly. “I—I kept replaying it in my head and the more I thought about it, certain things he had mentioned, it was a little too extreme, even for Michael. Unless there was more to it.”
With his eyes glued to his hands, Sam answered, “That wasn't even—what I'm angry—it was stupid of me to say that. It was even more stupid to do it, too.”
“Um, I—I—thank you for last night. And I would, but the thing is—” Sam couldn’t finish his sentence.
Namely, Sam had sneaked out of the apartment because he had been mad at Dean, had ran into trouble, had called Dean from work to come to his aid, and Dean had found him like this.
Later in the evening, Jessica and Donna managed to convince everyone at the table to go on the dance floor. Resistance had occurred, especially from the Winchester brothers, but soon enough, everyone reached the dance floor.
As Dean shut the drawer, he took a deep breath, bracing himself for what would come next now that this part was behind him. He turned around to face Castiel.
Castiel gasped at the sight of the car and rushed to Dean’s side the moment he stepped out of the vehicle.
She lifted her head, and once assessing who was present, she wiggled her tail a few times, but rested her head down again, determined to stay comfortably in her warm spot.
Castiel burst into laughter. “I love it. But—isn’t that ruining the authenticity of the place?” he asked, gesturing around them.
Focusing on Castiel’s eyes, and letting himself be engulfed with warmth and a sense of peace, as he noticed his eyes often had this effect on him, he said earnestly, “I liked the ones about warriors.
Stubborn Dean-o fought like hell, but it was no use. Soon he got hit on his melon and it hurt and he got carried away down the hallway. From what he could see, glimpses of chamber after chamber, as he was literally dragged on the cold and wet floor, the place was indeed empty. And given the million stupid little lights blinking, loud alarms screaming, vapor coming out of those pods, and a shit tone of a water on the floor, it was safe to say that whoever had crawled out of those pods hadn’t woken up that long ago.
That being said, Dean brought back game from hunts with him all the time, and while carrying a heavy load was often demanding, at that particular moment, he knew this wasn’t the main issue.
“Okay, well, for now, let’s just be glad you made it back in one piece. Maybe some of the details will come back later on. Now, I know it’s a stupid question, but how are you feeling?”
“I—this is difficult. I’m not really sure where to—” he cleared his throat once more, and then said, “I always liked your work. The paintings you’ve been posting online. I came across it one day because of the fan art. I had never commented before because…I don’t know why. I know people post things to share them, so it’s not like they don’t expect comments, but for some reason, when something resonates with me or I just thoroughly enjoy it, I get discouraged from saying so. Even if they are a complete stranger. That’s the part that always weirded me out, actually. That a stranger managed to…I don’t know…reach me? I know it’s stupid and, of course, I don’t necessarily mean in a deep, life altering way, but…”
And so, for the second time in less than ten hours, they knocked on Anael’s door. This time she didn’t make them linger and immediately let them in.
When they had retrieved their clothes and personal items aboard the BMoL ship, only two bracelets had been accounted for. And the key card Kip had given them had also been missing from their personal items.
The soup was slowly warming up over the oven, and Dean set aside noodles to add on later and the necessary ingredients to make them grilled cheeses as well, before rejoining Castiel who was still digging out decorations from the box.
Still, he stubbornly remained as is, positive that he was simply experiencing a mild discomfort due to something else entirely.
“I’m sure you’ll do just fine, Dean. I was just curious,” said Sam sincerely. “And how do you feel about it so far?”
So they nervously took a seat at an empty table and scanned the room quickly, searching for her, while trying to not look conspicuous.
“I don’t think I need to tell you,” Bevell continued, “that this is the outcome you want to avoid. The same will happen if we don’t like your attitude, you are uncooperative or you become agitated. Got it?”
Sam laughed. “We were supposed to be on our own yesterday. We aren’t five, Mom. I think we’ll survive.”
When John arrived home, they decided to let him have the living room, despite his protestation that he would simply watch whatever they were watching. Shortly after, however, John started dozing off in the armchair. Sam put the television on mute, left the remote next to him, and he and Castiel moved their conversation to his room, where it was private.
“And what about school? I remember you had mentioned something about grad school when we met.” He paused a moment, pondering on the matter. “Literature. Is that what it was? Or did I dream that?”
She hesitated a moment and then, after taking a deep breath, she added, “Would it be totally crazy if I asked if you were free tonight, also?”
That was it. No hospital in sight. No factory. No theatre or coffee shop. Bookstore. Gym. Not even a school.
While they kept to their respective sides and consciously did not cross the invisible line separating them, their proximity was still blatantly evident.
The bouncer opened the door with a wide smile, as though he was about to devour him whole, which was incredibly unnerving.
And it wasn’t until that moment that Castiel, with Dean inches from his face, remembered how this whole day had begun. His eyes hadn’t properly adjusted to the dark yet, and the moonlight was of no help at that angle.
“Awesome,” said Dean, trying to not think about what that could have entailed. “Because I think we finally can do something together. All of us.”
“No,” said Sam, letting out a small laugh. He squeezed his hand and shifted closer to him. “No, nothing like that.”
“If everything goes according to plan, I believe he and his children should be able to move in by the end of the summer, right before the beginning of the school year.”
It had started simple. Small. How could it had not, as they only had brief encounters. Almost like admiring someone from afar. Positive his attraction to Dean would dissipate, Castiel had ignored it and had filed it under moments of stupidity. Loneliness at work. Completely natural and nothing too bothersome.
For the umpteenth time over the past few days, Castiel lifted himself from the ground, unsure of what had happened.
Dean was overwhelmed by a strong desire to flee the scene. But he remained on his spot all the same.
“Yes. Although, that’s only what I’ve heard. I confess that I am not entirely sure how truthful the source was.”
Castiel reassured him that it was a very common thing to do and that there was nothing to feel embarrassed about, which seemed to comfort Dean when a shy smile appeared on his face.
But since they had shared their piece with Gabriel, they also gathered that it was up to Gabriel to decide now. No amount of nagging would change that.
Soon enough, once everything was cleared, Dean and his father arrived at the Winchester’s Auto Repair Shop with
Dean, nearly sobbing, wrapped his arms around him and hugged him tightly. Castiel buried his face in his neck, as he kissed it, smiling.
And in that moment, if Castiel and Dean thought that the topic of cryo sleep would make it awkward for them, they didn’t know what was about to fucking hit them.
And just as Castiel was debating if he should simply shift onto his back and look Dean straight in the eyes, he heard him walk towards the dresser, pick up a few things and exit the room.
And now, even though it had been Castiel who had exposed him, he felt like he was the one with the dirty secret. Or worse, that
Dean opened his eyes again, and this time he seemed more alert. He seemed to realize where he was. What he was doing. He looked down, as if assessing he was naked for the first time, and he brought his hands in front of his genitals, hiding himself. Dean looked directly at Castiel with sad eyes.
Sam, Dean and Castiel looked at Chuck questioningly. His sole response was a nervous shrug, and when he noticed a small group talking amongst themselves while staring at them a little too profoundly for his comfort, he then hurried after Gabriel.
Moving his hands under water, as he seemed in deep thought, Gabriel then said, “There’s something I don’t understand.”
“All right.” Sam, staring at him, desperate to hold down his smirk. “If you win, you get to spend the night here. And,” he added, suddenly inspired, “I get the pleasure of cooking breakfast for you tomorrow morning.”
“Yeah, not bad Cas. You’re a bit rusty, but it almost sounded as good as it used to for a moment,” said Raphael, gulping down his drink.
Shortly after, however, Dean awkwardly lifted himself on his elbow, while making sure to not disrupt Castiel’s task.
“No, no. It’s tradition. I’ll abide by it. Now, you said the rest of the required attire are pajamas? I don’t think jeans qualify as such, huh?” he said, gesturing his outfit.
Mildly confused, they stared at each other, both catching their breaths, as they quickly fixed their clothes.
“You won’t. I took care of that. I—Mrs. B. helped me. She—just trust me, the only way this is getting off your coat is because you, and no one else, will it.”
“Dean,” yelped Sam. He and Castiel, both startled by his sudden presence, quickly jumped to their feet and started picking up their stuff in a hurry.
Jack’s knitted jumper was of a grey and maroon color, with daleks and cybermen on it. Castiel’s was bright green and a bit of beige in it, with Christmas trees and stormtroopers, while Dean’s was a blue and red knitted jumper, displaying grumpy cat with a Christmas hat.
And with a sad smile, Castiel kissed him quickly, yet tenderly, on the lips, and once on his forehead.
Of course, these miscreants’ attitudes changed real fast once Castiel was hooked up to some machine and they discovered that he was not actually human.
They broke the kiss after a moment. Lisa smiled, and holding his hand, she gently pulled Dean towards the living room. Dying to step as far as possible from the kitchen, he let her guide him, uncertain he cared about anything else anymore.
Dean let out a huge sigh of relief. “That would be really something, Cas. I mean, you’re already helping enough as it is.”
And Castiel, despite his best attempt, could not help but feel his heart grow heavy at the simple wish that, for once, he wouldn’t have to watch this scene on every Sunday morning.
“But—” Sam shook his head, repositioning himself on the couch. Fully facing Gabriel, he held a serious expression as much as he could. “
I began to panic a little. Not only for myself, but for Sam because he was, after all, a cryo patient.
The rest of the day flew by, but Dean barely noticed. His mind had been elsewhere. Sam’s discoveries about the sigils turned out to be more fascinating than he had ever thought. In all honesty, he hadn’t expected Sam to unearth any new information. Not because he doubted his brother’s skills, but because a lot of information surrounding the Mountain had been thoroughly documented already.
Sam was studying in the library after lunch. His teacher had announced that everyone would be allowed to take this class to work on their group presentation, which was due in a few weeks. She had also given them permission to work elsewhere than their usual classroom, as it might get rather loud, so long as they dutifully used this time and didn’t waste it.
No vehicle was parked outside, only a yellow bicycle resting against the porch. Luggage was spread out on the patio. And the door of the shed was wide open.
“And knowing Cas,” sighed Gabriel, “he’ll be there wearing a jumper. I shouldn’t complain though, as normally he wouldn’t go at all.” Sam smirked at Gabriel. “What?”
Castiel and Jack, who until then had remained quiet, exchanged concerned looks. Wishing to help move this discussion in the right direction, Castiel stepped forward and said, “Tell us more about the spell you are proposing.”
“Good. That’s good,” he said, and after a significant pause, he added, “and it’s a good thing you’ll have the weekend off, then." Dean knew he had meant it, and yet, he could have sworn there had been a small hint of falseness in his father’s voice. "It all works out in the end it seems.”
“Why not? Don’t you know anything? Today is probably the best day to ask her out! I’m not saying is a done deal, just saying—”
If they allowed Hannah to stay in the house, a few details would evidently not escape her notice. Like their sleeping arrangement. On the other hand, nothing was happening between Castiel and Dean, and surely, she would also notice this important detail.
“Really?” asked Sam, smiling. “You mean like a chauffeur? Would you have to wear a suit? And for whom?”
“She’s okay, Sam. She’s going to be okay. I—I need to hang up the phone, but I promise I’m not going anywhere until you boys get here and I’m calling back the moment she wakes up or I have another update. All right?”
“No,” said Sam firmly. With one hand held in front of him, he shifted on his seat to look at his brother properly. “One, we said we’d leave tonight. Dean, we agreed. We’ve been trying to do this for the last four years.
Sam lifted his arm, signalling Dean to join them, while Jessica whispered something into the brunette’s ear and smiled at her brightly.
“That wasn’t the reason!” he protested. “I’ve been meaning to come here for a while now. Really. It, um, just happened that she volunteers here, too.”
“And unfortunately, it doesn’t tell us much. I don’t claim to be an expert, but given its size and all, I’m fairly certain this couldn’t have been inflicted by a large caliber. Not from afar. I don’t even think you were shot.”
Rufus nodded, and before heading towards the patio door, he told him, “Jody is on her way, and more of the ranch’s security will be here shortly.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” she said, smiling at the corner of her mouth. She picked up her cup that she had laid on the balustrade of her porch. “But I may have heard a wee bit of something about you and a certain dashing Dean Winchester…”
. But if you’re looking for other qualities, like being dependable and committed…let’s just say he had one foot out the door the entire time.”
The moment it happened, Dean felt Castiel stir next to them. As he was about to slide in between them, Dean urgently lifted his other hand to stop him. With a pleading look, Dean shook his head, signaling him to not get involved.
He used to think that what was so special about their connection was the aspect that they hadn’t been able to interact organically, which had allowed them to grow closer in ways he had never achieved before. But now, he began to wonder if he hadn’t used that side of their relationship as an excuse to compensate for everything else they were missing.
As I’m saying this, I’m aware it might seem a bit weird, considering…you know. Which is why I’ll stop there for now and I’ll reserve this for the upcoming good part. I’m already gonna cross the line, assuming I haven’t already, soooo, moving on.
And while Dean hadn’t necessarily been glad of the way the night had ended, the fact that he hadn’t been overly heartbroken about it, suggested that his feelings for Richie would remain just as they always had been.
“I know,” said Sam earnestly. “That’s why I’d like you to assist Rowena. Everything is fine, he won’t go anywhere. It’s perfectly safe. Okay?”
Puzzled by Castiel’s odd behavior and by his suggestion, Dean waited a few seconds to see if Castiel would elaborate, but he only repositioned himself on his seat, as though he was ready for them to resume their route.
Or was it the figure’s soft facial features, despite its gigantic scale, that rendered it so mesmerizing?
“We did. My parents only moved to Lebanon a while back. Mom got a job offer that was too good to be true. She didn’t want to leave because her whole life was here. Her family and her friends. But Sam and I weren’t kids anymore, so it’s not like we couldn’t fend for ourselves. And while Dad had his auto shop set up here, he argued that mechanics were always needed everywhere, so he could simply set up another one over there as well. I don’t think Dad minds one bit where it is. He’d follow Mom across the globe no questions asked.” He smiled at the thought. “Anyway, I—since then, Sam and I head over there for Christmas.”
“Oh! Good. That means research.” He came to halt and said excitedly, “I should get Sam’s computer, then. I had borrowed it earlier!”
The man smirked, took a sip of champagne, signaled for his companion to leave them for a moment and stepped forward.
Castiel continued as long as he could, causing the sound of slapping skin to be heard over their panting. Eventually, feeling himself getting close to orgasm, he stopped moving and hastily pulled himself out, hoping it would help.
“What happened with Dean, Cas? I know it’s about him.” Then, after a short pause, he said, “It is about Dean, right?”
But he abruptly stopped when Castiel recoiled back to the wall. Dean’s shock at his retreat left Castiel perplexed at his own action.
The next few days had not been kind to Dean. He barely slept or ate. His mind and emotions had been all over the place.
“Yeah. So Granddad was now stuck with a massive house he didn’t really want. Sam moved in, of course. He was still in high school when it happened. I stayed with them during my school breaks.”
Castiel retrieved the boots from the box to examine them more properly. They were dark brown, nearly black, with meticulous blue stitching. The detail in the stitching was actually beautiful. As Castiel ran his fingers over it, the patterns reminded him of wings. He took off his shoes, and tried them on. They fitted perfectly. He stood up from the couch and started walking around in the living room to try them out.
Thus, when it was time for Samuel to leave, Dean helped them pack the truck, wished them a good trip and promised he would meet them shortly.
But Castiel knew that no one could change anything. Not even Dean, and this no matter how true his intentions were. The damage had been done.
Dean loved waking up early in the morning and hearing Castiel whisper to his plants while he watered them as though he was an adorable old lady.
Intrigued as to what Dean was thinking of, Castiel nonetheless reasoned that he should content himself with the fact that the matter had been dropped, at last. And wanting to ensure that it stayed that way, he then questioned Dean about
“I’m sorry,” he repeated. “Lisa, I am so sorry. You didn’t deserve this. Figuring shit out on my end was already one thing, but what happened yesterday… Like I said, I get it if you never want to see my face again. But I hope that won’t be the case. I want to make it up to you. I have no idea how, but I’ll think of something. If you let me.”
He was convinced it was a terrible idea. This wasn’t his style, and as far as he knew, it wasn’t Sam’s, either.
In the stables, Dean approached Elliot Ness’ box. Castiel, wanting to help, headed to Dave Mather, but Dean said, “Let’s just take Elliot Ness.”
“Dean, please. This is—it’s already been so difficult as it is. We can’t just—we agreed to stop because of—of everything. And the situation hasn’t changed. I still live here and you—you said—”
And he was about to tell Dean how beautiful he was, when Dean, still out of breath, began stroking Castiel’s cock again.
And while that was what he ultimately did, Dean was then blessed with another idea that could make the exchange far better and less random.
“Nothing!” barked Dean. “Come on, you know that. Look, tell us what you want and…we’ll promise to do everything we can about it afterwards.”
“Well, the gorgeous, yet so humble, Sam here is aiding me with last-minute errands for a party tonight. Do you know my friend Kali?”
His eyes were glued to the ground. His heart was pounding. And the pit in his stomach was growing, which wasn’t helping his overall nauseous state.
Dean let go of the man, sat himself up and gripped the end of the couch. Although his pants were still on, the woman was tending to his erection by rubbing her hand over it. Dean slowly began to move his hips, following Castiel’s rhythm.
Dean partly wanted to walk up to them and ask for him, but he remained frozen on his spot. If they didn’t know where he was, they might suggest in joining the search for him and that was the opposite of what he wanted.
Castiel, remaining silent and witnessing the exchange between the two, had to admit that the camaraderie was hard to miss.
And finally, how are you? I’m having difficulty believing it’s been four years since we’ve seen one another. It’s been too long. And when I think that you haven’t seen Bobby, or even gone to the village altogether for nearly as long, it worries me. I sometimes regret having accepted coming here. I know it was years before your situation changed, and there isn’t much we can do about it now, but I cannot help but wonder if you’d do the same if I still resided in Tulpa. I know there are rules and I’m proud of you for keeping your word (which I knew you would). But I still worry about you and I wish I could do more.
“I promise, I won’t,” Sam assured him. “I get it. I—I know how to keep a secret.” He cleared his throat. It dawned on him that it might have been unfair of him to have put Castiel on the spot like this. In order to remedy it, he added, “And more accurately: I know what it’s like to keep your feelings to yourself. To keep them secret.”
He lay on his back, snuggled up warmly underneath heavy and thick covers, and paid close attention to the moans he could hear over the running water.
Gabriel busied himself with filling up not one, but two boxes of sumptuous pastries and chocolates. One, which was meant for Dean, solely contained chocolate, as they both decided he had earned his own box. Sam had given Gabriel his information, and Dean’s so he could send him the box by mail—a service that the bakery offered for less perishable items—knowing it would be a good surprise for his brother.
Rowena wasn’t so keen on Sam brushing her off, which he had to admit was rather unkind considering she was helping them at this very moment.
And although what Sam had just said was the truth, his comment still felt partly incomplete to Dean. So, he stepped in and said bluntly, “I can’t speak for Sam and Cas, but I know that, for me, I just…there are things that I don’t like to think about, let alone openly discuss. Because I regret it. I’ve done a lot of things that—many mistakes—but
Despite their eagerness to return to their room, they actually finished their meal (and their morning) in a leisurely manner. Since they now had plans for their afternoon—at the minimum—they decided to postpone their visit at the vineyard and brewery to the following day, so they could remain within walking distance from the hotel today.
“Oh, yeah,” laughed Dean. “I might regret it tomorrow, but I really don’t care right now. Everything is so delicious. Even the tomatoes. I wouldn’t have thought of roasting them. That was brilliant.”
He strategically moved one of his legs in between Castiel’s, and he positioned his hips at the right angle to feel Castiel’s erection against his own.
Dean and Castiel retrieved their bags from the cargo bed, and before leaving in their turn, Dean tucked the keys into the glove compartment, shut the door and nodded at Castiel to follow him.
When Dean anxiously stepped into the cafeteria at lunch, he was relieved to see Sam and Castiel weren’t alone, but seated with Kevin and Channing. As he watched Sam in a seemingly deep discussion with them over a sheet of paper, Dean’s whole being tensed when he noticed Castiel smiling and apparently listening heartily to every word Sam was saying.
With John yelling, there was no point for Sam to fake waking up. And due to the fact that he hadn’t woken his father the night before, there was also no point in pretending to be confused about whatever drama was about to be unfold. So, he stepped away from his window and gunned for his door.
Castiel felt his knees weakening at the sensation—and at the sight of Dean going up and down his cock—until Dean gave a hard push.
And then all the lights went out, loud terrified screams roared around them, and a massive amount of blaster shots were fired. A large group of men started rushing in. At first the boys thought it was Henriksen (again), but no. This wasn’t Henriksen. They weren’t mercenaries. These guys had their own emblem. With a giant “K” over their chests.
Dean wasted no time and called Crowley the very next morning. With a bit of coaxing, Crowley accepted his terms to relay his information to them in exchange for a conversation with Castiel, and would wait for the rest of his demands until after the pressing drama was dealt with.
Seeing it twitching in front of him, Dean felt his heartbeat increase at the thought of what was to follow.
“Doesn’t matter. You—you ask him. I—there’s a lot of things I want to say, but Dean has the right to say it himself. And if not telling you is gonna force you two to speak, then I’m keeping my mouth shut forever. I—I really, really think you guys should talk. At the very least.”
“No,” said Dean eagerly. “I—I have to meet Mr. Zach about—he wants to have a discussion about this morning. But I should be good to meet you and Sam after. I don’t know how long it will take…”
Of course, that was not exactly what Dean had meant. And Castiel knew that. But now he found himself in a weird place. If he refused, it would then convey that he was full of shit
But finally, once he concluded that he was probably overthinking it, he put his pen down, read it one last time and hurried to Dean’s porch, passing by the Impala, before he would change his mind.
“Cassie, this could take care of a lot of problems. Your student loans alone. I know people who would sell their soul for a deal like that, and they wouldn’t even get half of the other compensations you’re getting. Nor would they be able to do all this next to that tall refreshing glass of water like Dean.”
And although Jack’s teacher, Mr. Sully, had been very adamant that it had been an accident and had assured Castiel that Jack was not in any trouble, the simple fact that he had nonetheless seen necessary to inform Castiel of the event was, somewhat, worrisome to Castiel.
Even if his mind required rest, it was anything but restful. His thoughts kept bouncing off many different things, keeping him wide awake and frustrated. Sleep wouldn’t come to him.
But he evidently felt obligated to say something, and just as he was about to do so, Dean moved his hips against Castiel’s side.
“Boys, listen. I want to help you out. I really do. But given your crazy state and, um, current statuses, telling you this information would seem to be the very opposite of helping you out. Unless you tell me why.”
Mary and John both took their place at the table, bringing coffee mugs, orange juice for Sam and Dean, and toasts for everyone.
They blurted out the high points of the information. Regarding Sam. Regarding cryo. Regarding their situation.
So, Dean was to go on his own and had shared the strong possibility that he might spend the night there.
Besides, it wasn’t like Dean had much to do in his free-time anyway. What was he supposed to do? Implementing a social life wasn’t such a good idea these days, considering the company he kept.
Alas, once Dean and Castiel had left the booth to Garth and Alicia at the end of their shift, Dean, on the way to the employee lounge, after being stopped by customers and co-coworkers, had somehow lost track of Castiel.
Dean nodded, and once Castiel judged that he would indeed not flee after examining Dean’s expression, he stepped back inside to speak with Jack, shutting the door behind him.
Crowley held his stare, smiling, and said, “All right, then. But if you ever change your mind, you know where to find me.”
They had their little staring contest for a good minute until Castiel chuckled and leaned in as well.
“Oh. Um, that’s—since I was still here, I just wanted to drop this off for you guys.” After Dean made sure that the bags weren’t too heavy for him and that Jack had a solid hold on them, Jack carefully brought the bags inside with him.
On his arrival in the main hall, Castiel was impressed by the large and enthusiastic gathering, and immediately understood why everyone had been making a big deal about it.
Sam dropped his head, laughing and feeling embarrassed. “Those were a silly gift from my brother who thinks he’s very funny. I nearly never wear them, because…well…”
“You’re in Tulpa,” to which Castiel gave him a that-tells-me-nothing look. “The town is about three miles from here. You’ll be fine. Just go to the main building,” he said, pointing at the small cabin, “and they’ll have more information for you on the situation and how they can help you.”
Dean’s questionable behavior, however, was nothing compared to when Sam brought up Castiel’s name to the table near the end of supper.
He parked the car further down the street, and both he and Castiel, sitting in the car, scanned the place as best they could. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Quiet. Dark.
“Come on,” said Dean calmly. He instructed Castiel to hand him one of the blankets, and bridle. “And no saddle,” he said, petting Eliott Ness’ neck.
Dean was sitting at the edge of the tub. His arms were crossed over his chest. His eyes were puffy and red. And he was desperately trying to even out his breathing.
So, after instructing Jack to continue his good work, Sam and Rowena left the library and ambled down the hallway.
His feet were sore, his back and arms stung, and his whole body was heavy. The moment he stepped into his apartment, all he wanted was to fall into a deep sleep.
Intrigued, Dean tugged the small pile towards him to get a proper look. He started reading the back covers. While he did so, Castiel busied himself by continuing to browse, but he couldn’t help smiling.
To Dean’s surprise (and relief), however, Castiel did no such thing. He never ran into him. Dean’s eyes never found him in the crowd. Even on the numerous accounts when he spotted Castiel’s family.
“What is it you’re sorry for exactly, Dean? Is it that you led me on? Two-timed me? Lied? Ditched me, when you were the one who had invited me to the party in the first place? Said you wanted to go out with me when you didn’t? Or was it that you got caught? That you used me for—I don’t know—what is it?”
“Um, I don’t know,” he said, unwrapping his sub. “I don’t have anything against Lisa. She’s great, and Dean says he likes her a lot and all.”
The moment he arrived in the lobby, he was shocked at how many people appeared to be wearing trench coats. Having no doubt that Gabriel was behind this, he scanned the place quickly, which wasn’t very difficult to do, given his height.
And one look at Gabriel’s face, and he knew he had meant it. Relief spread throughout Sam’s whole body, and he reached for Gabriel’s hand.
With both Winchester boys innocent (so to speak), safe and sound, and my big bad bro finally given the time out he needed, that was a pretty good win for Venandi.
They eventually came across an ice cream stand, which they thought was a ridiculous thing to eat in the dead of winter.
And after a moment of hesitation, Dean took a deep breath and told Sam of his miserable evening from the night before. Of his harsh words to Castiel. Of his anger.
The look that Dean was giving him. Like he was assessing every detail of his face in utter admiration of the spectacle before him.
Laughing and browsing through the various merchandise on display. Conversing with the occasional monster or spirit the brothers had once fought.
Dean, evidently feeling embarrassed, shared that he didn’t like having to resort to medication and urgently specified that they were simply in case of emergency.
“After the shock kicked in of the—of what it entailed,” continued Dean, still staring at the ground, “and I had my mini-freak out and all that… I knew I had to go to New York. I had to try for the ranch. But—but the idea of seeing you after all this time terrified me. And that was before—I was expecting you to laugh in my face or worse—but I never
They briefly woke up nap guy, asked him a few questions about Henriksen and the ship, and then zapped him, too. They chucked him and the others over board, and urgently started the engines in order to get the fuck off that planet asap.
“I don’t know. Let’s just try to get off this station first,” he said as they started to walk again.
“No, look, I—I’m not trying to be an asshole, okay? But no matter who it is, I—how can you—aren’t you worried? How can you really know him?”
was among the long list of people who Dean just about wished he would never have the displeasure to fucking set his eyes on again, but also because these insinuations were coming out the wrong way.
“I’ll skip the introduction then and get right to the point. I must confess that at first,” he said, “we were going to interview the both of you separately. You know, good old intimidation tactic. The ‘he said, he said’ thing, and then turn—”
“Nope, not what I’m talking about,” said Dean gleefully. “But we are definitely coming back to that.”
The moment they stepped into the airport, it became rapidly apparent to Castiel that Dean was a nervous flyer. So much so that once aboard the plane, Dean had to take pills to calm his nerves.
—I know he likes you. Everybody can see it. That dumb idiot doesn’t deserve you. I don’t understand why he did that. He freaked. He’s a shit person and I’m totally going to kick his ass, but—”
Michael took a good long look at him and said, “You think that would be the case for him if it comes down between the ranch and you? Considering that’s not what Henry did, I wouldn’t hold my breath too much on that one.”
“He said he didn’t need much. And I’m not the only one who has to offer something that might weaken them, Dean. You think I like either of you,” he said, looking at the brothers, “giving out blood?”
“We were like this. Perhaps not to that extent, but… what happened to me—to my family—what happened after, I think it serves as evidence that problems and issues were already there. Your family suffered a lot of tragedies too, Dean, and compared to mine, when confronted by it, yours seemed to have gotten closer, not divided. I know it’s not clear science and it doesn’t mean it’s the same for everyone, but as for my family, I don’t think tragedies and bad luck are what broke it. It just emphasized how it really was all along.”
Castiel shut his eyes, shaking his head. “It’s too hard, Dean. Look, don’t worry. I’ll—just—just forget—I—”
Castiel immediately pulled out his fingers, which made Dean groan. Turning his head to the side, Dean watched him grab the bottle of lube.
In the hallway, he carefully listened and could still hear Samuel’s snores over the news. He debated for an instant if he should wake him up.
He went for his right sleeve, but Dean grabbed his hands. For a moment, Castiel thought Dean was stopping him all together, but then Dean gently helped him with his cufflinks. The shirt drop on the floor and Dean tugged him closer to him by his belt.
Samuel held his stare for a second and then nodded as he took a sip of his glass of water. Dean glanced at Sam again, who was now smiling at him shyly.
Wearing his father’s leather jacket, Dean found himself awkwardly inquiring, to a very aggravated Kali, if she had found a phone, a blue jacket and a set of keys. She informed him that as far as she knew, no one had mentioned finding keys or a random blue jacket. A couple of phones, however, had apparently been left behind, so she let him in to take a look.
“It is. I…I know it might not seem like it, but I really enjoyed last night. And not to sound pathetic, but going out with you, I’ve wanted this for a really long time.”
And after making sure that his fingers were sufficiently coated with saliva, Dean slowly began moving Castiel’s hand downwards.
Super done with the party, Dean returned to my house and grumpily gunned for his room. He pushed through the door and locked it as he groaned. Frustrated, he pulled off his jacket and threw it on the ground. He was about to take off his shirt, when he heard water splashing. He grabbed his blaster and turned abruptly.
Aggravated, Deanmon twisted his blade in his hand. “I thought you said you could take him,” he told the Boy King.
“If it’s about the prank that was pulled in the teacher’s lounge, we already know,” said Castiel as Dean dropped his tray on the table and sat next to him.
While he had never believed the legend to be an accurate historical account, Dean had nevertheless accepted the core of the story as the truth, since he had heard it so many times.
But before Castiel could answer, they both found themselves back inside the hotel, fully dressed, and standing next to Sam and Gabriel.
Dean’s voice was breaking then. The room wasn’t properly lit, but Castiel could discern that Dean held his fingers on his eyelids, and tears were sliding down his face.
After his warning, he opened a large case, which had been resting on one of the tables near them. “A few more things, too. First, you’ll need this.” He presented Dean with an old blaster of a silver color. And when I say old, I mean, a freaking relic.
As for the days when they weren’t on the job, unfortunately, Dean wasn’t in a position to run to Castiel every time he wished to.
He had, however, and quite surprisingly, left Bobby a voicemail that he would not come into work the next morning, promising he would (doubly) catch up in the evening instead.
Castiel made notice of that sensitive zone, pulled Dean closer, and kissed him hard on the mouth. Happy to comply, Dean slid himself onto Castiel’s lap. After freeing Castiel of his shirt, Dean glued himself to him, keeping him warm.
“It just feels like ten times worse right now for some reason,” said Sam, watching a pair of Sam and Dean waving plastic machetes in the air, as though they were fighting an invisible monster.
While Dean was busy with his task, Castiel finished up putting the rest of the food they had brought in the pantry, and stored the meat, along with beers and the milk in the cooler.
As much as the trio had planned on tackling their conversation with Gabriel, they weren’t exactly granted many chances to do so after the waiter had left their table. Becky, who was loquacious as ever, spent the better part of the following ten minutes questioning Sam about various subjects, from his childhood to his favourite books. And though Sam wasn’t particularly keen on discussing personal issues, nor did he appreciate being put on the spot like that, being the polite guy that he was, he still answered as truthfully as he dared to in the hope that it would satisfy Becky’s curiosity, and, not to mention, so he could move on to the more
With full bellies, they then undertook the annoying chore of clearing the table. They let Jack amuse himself with Whiskey outside in the yard while Castiel and Dean put the leftovers away in the fridge and filled the dishwasher.
On the very next day, he had received a text with the sole instruction to lay low until the next weekly meet-up.
His heart was racing. Dean lowered his hand down his stomach, while he busied himself nibbling on his nipple.
Castiel twisted his phone in his hands. “I suppose, if I have to pick one, I’d have to say the rules. Though, I wouldn’t exactly say it bothers me, more like—I’m just confused about them.”
The main problem with this was that stating he had returned home would most likely bring questions. And even though Dean was occupied at the moment, a little too much for an inquiry, he probably would follow through with the interrogation process on the following day.
Sam and Dean were sitting at the kitchen table, doing their homework, while their parents were busy preparing dinner. Dean usually liked this tradition, as it permitted him to work on a bit of homework, while still being surrounded by his family members.
“No. The so-called security cameras have never worked and the alley next to the restaurant leads to a small private parking lot. Which is never used except on Sunday nights, and it’s well hidden.”
“I—I’m sorry about leaving without telling you. Really. And I’m sure she’s nice, but I—I don’t really feel it.”
“It’s okay. It happened a long time ago,” said Castiel, staring at him warmly. “I’m all right, now.”
Yet he didn’t have one scratch on him. The rest of his clothes were still impeccable. And he didn’t even have one hair out of place.
Castiel, startled by his friend’s sudden arrival, turned briskly. After assessing who was next to him, he let out a short laugh. “Hello, Dean.”
“I know, but tracking you down to give you additional workload during the holidays…it’s not the policy we usually strive for at Host Co. So, just—don’t strain yourself. Look at it if you can.”
And he got served with massive, smooth tongue action, making his knees tremble and his legs tighten around him. Dean decided that breathing was an overrated concept, and continued exploring Castiel’s mouth instead.
“I know you were busy, Dean,” his friend gently replied. “And I had stuff too. As for the other night, it’s okay. It wasn’t that bad.”
And while Dean had dreaded this moment since the night before, notably because he felt—still—ambivalent about the whole ordeal, caught in a vicious circle of anger, embarrassment and confusion, he had no idea how he would react once Castiel was standing in front of him.
Castiel gently took hold of Dean’s face. “Thank you. Without you, I would have never done what I should have done a long time ago.”
Remaining quiet together, they were soon startled when people began waking up like clockwork. Everyone felt refreshed and relaxed, as though they had had the best sleep of their lives. No hunger. No illness. No hangovers. Just as Gabriel had promised.
had felt even longer and slower. Because it was the night before Christmas Eve, the store had been opened until ten o’clock, and it had been even more stressful to work at the booth as Castiel and Dean had to share their already cramped and awkward workspace with Garth and Alicia.
The night had been long and exhausting. He spent most of his time, once again, fighting the urge to jump in his car and rush to Castiel’s building apartment—at some point, he even got dressed and had his keys in hand—until morning finally came.
And after giving him the most depressing look Castiel had ever had the displeasure to see on his face, Dean gunned for the front entrance and slammed the door behind him, leaving Castiel alone in the house with the weight of Dean’s speech around him.
They entered one of the million dodgy places of that darn station, and ordered something quick. The food, just like the company roaming around them, was not that inspiring, but Dean still devoured it like the precious bean he is and Castiel couldn’t help but smile as he watched him.
A couple of hours later, Castiel was still settled at Dean’s side. His eyes shifted away from his book once in a while, wanting to be sure that Dean was all right.
And no mention of his conversation with Sam from the day before, or their little morning chat in the hallway, either.
The door handle wiggled and once it was clear that the door was locked, Dean then heard footsteps on his porch, rushing around his house, as if Castiel was trying to find another way in, but Dean had been thorough. He had pulled every curtain properly and not a single window had remained opened.
Lucifer started laughing. “Um, sorry to interrupt your moment. That was quite something. But no way Sammy does anything to me. He
“Because now I really didn’t have anything holding me back.” And with pleading eyes, he added, “I wanted to stay here with you since—since even before we—before that night. Before our day at the lake. I didn’t know how we could make it work—I didn’t even know if you liked me—but I wanted to stay here. To live here. With you. While I was dealing with the drama back home, I made a few calls and I was surprised how quickly I found employment in Tulpa. Once I knew that I was no longer in trouble financially, finding a place to live around here didn’t sound as impossible. I tried for Donna’s first, but I didn’t want to rent. I wanted my own place. And you know the rest.” He paused and looked across the lake where Mr. Sinclair’s house was located and hidden behind trees. “The only thing left to know was how you felt about me. I—I just—you were so angry with me. But your letter gave me hope.”
A smile of relief grew on Castiel’s face. Dean had taken care of it. Just as he had said he would. Grateful and contented, he reminded himself to thank Dean in the morning.
Not only was Sam using full sentences when he was addressing himself directly to Gabriel, but Castiel even heard him make a joke or two. He almost seemed like his usual self. Still nervous, perhaps, and he glimpsed at Gabriel a few times when he was sure he wasn’t looking at him, but Sam was miles away from what Castiel had witnessed this past week.
While teleportation wouldn’t have been a problem to reach their new destination, it wouldn't have been wise to assume that it would be the same for all future destinations. Also, if by some miracle they managed to find Sam, two teleporters wouldn’t be of a great help then.
Castiel’s warm breath against his neck. Which made him bite his lips and shape his hands into fists, trying to keep the quivering to a minimum.
“No clue. There are many lakes around, so people have a lot of options. I suppose this one is very far off from everything, which can bring certain issues like the need for food or, um, bathroom breaks…and maybe safety issues for families with young kids, you know? But I always liked this spot.”
“That’s great.” Castiel waited a moment and then added, “He seems kind. What do you like the most about him?”
Castiel frowned. “I’m fine, Dean. Don’t worry about me. You have enough going on,” he said, gesturing around them. “I can manage. That was nothing.”
“Oh, I know who you mean. But Gilda doesn’t work at the store anymore. She left in August, I think.”
Whatever twinkle that had been present in Dean’s eyes a moment ago, instantly vanished. He leaned back in his seat and said, “It was fine. Nothing much to report. After you left, I mean.”
Castiel quietly repositioned the door as it had been, and hand in hand, Dean followed Castiel to his bedroom at the end of the hall.
That being said, because it had been short notice, Hannah wouldn’t be able to leave until the end of January. Castiel wondered if Dean would still agree with that arrangement, as the two days Hannah could spare were smack in between Dean’s birthday and their next trip.
I shot a look at Castiel, to which he immediately understood my concern, and said, “We have good reason to believe Sam is alive.”
“Hello, I’m Castiel. May I be of assistance?” he calmly said, standing next to Samandriel once he had reached them.
Sam opened his mouth to say something, but closed it once he processed what Dean had said. He then frowned at him, and now evidently confused, he glanced at the house next door through the window.
Having Dean cook breakfast for him, in this specific context, had been the scenario Castiel had daydreamed about on so many occasions.
After giving him a pressing kiss, exploring Dean’s mouth with his tongue, Castiel grabbed the edge of the table past Dean’s head and began grinding against him.
Although he hadn’t told Dean of the particulars, since Castiel’s first visit, it was clear to Dean that the place had somehow been enhanced.
Castiel, still kissing the woman’s shoulder and running his hands on her back gently, smirked at Dean’s reaction.
She shook her head. “Feel free to retrace your steps if you think it would help you. But if that top of the line cleaning staff didn’t find it, I doubt you will.”
And then, the next photograph was Castiel, with a bright smile, sitting next to a beautiful brunette.
Castiel and Dean reached the bar, and while Dean ordered each of them a pint of his favourite brand of beer on tap, Castiel examined the room more extensively. At least the place had a genuinely merry vibe to it, nothing like the shady and depressing place Gabriel and Balthazar often frequented.
“Still,” said Dean finally, “I think you would have enjoyed Friday night considering what I had planned for us.”
“Castiel, I swear if you don’t tell me where you are I’m… I’m gonna call Michael, Lucifer and Naomi.”
He went to the corner store, the one they often stopped at after school and where they used to buy their comics and candy when they were younger.
Castiel glanced at the bed for a second. “I’m not sure. But I think lying on your back is your safest bet.”
situation. As much as he would like to believe that it was because they had found each other and they would therefore leave him be regarding this issue, Castiel knew better.
“No,” admitted Dean. “But there isn’t much interaction with the customers on my end. Not like you, anyway. And, um, like I said, you really do spend long hours there. Even after the bookstore closes.”
He remembered the overwhelming sensation he had felt when the quake had occurred. How strange the discussion had been.
Hold on. One minute. I just need to clarify that the BMoL, for those of you who don’t know, are usually massive dicks.
Without wasting a moment, Sam and Jack had carried the Boy King to the dungeon on their arrival, while Rowena took it upon herself to perform additional protective charms to the surroundings.
Dean smiled. “Yes, he mentioned that.” He swallowed hard and took a deep breath. “That’s—that is actually why we’re here,” said Dean, uneasy. He was fidgeting on his spot and kept rubbing his hand on his neck. “Cas, um, I know you’re working right now and you probably have plans this evening, but is it possible that we could sit down and talk at some point?” He cleared his throat and continued looking straight at him, even though he seemed uncomfortable for the first time since he had arrived. “I need to tell you something. It’s very important. And urgent.”
If he had been reticent about discovering what those social calls entailed before, he was now convinced that avoiding the subject altogether was the best policy to adopt.
Dean, however, didn’t like the idea of weakening Castiel, especially since he had just been returned to them safe and sound. It didn’t seem fair to him.
And the thought that their Impala had manifested itself in front of him in a moment when he desperately needed help to rescue Sam hit him straight to his heart.
And whatever it was that Bobby was about to say, the trio wouldn’t find out right away, because before he could finish his sentence, he, as well as Ellen, suddenly vanished in front of their eyes.
“Thank you again for tonight. That was really kind of you.” Castiel reached for his wallet in his back pocket. “The plans were made at the last minute, so we didn’t really discuss any—but I usually give Row—”
He wasn’t preachy. He wasn’t discriminatory. He wasn’t arrogant. And he wasn’t sugar coating it, either.
Castiel maintained that he would be just fine now that the power was back. And so, they agreed to call it a night for now, as they both cordially mentioned that they had enjoyed each other’s company. As promised, Castiel sent the link of his blog to Dean, and they decided, for practical purposes, to exchange phone numbers as well.
Castiel took a moment to think about it. “I’m okay with that, Dean. I would have followed through with the rule. It is just sleeping after all, as we agreed. But we can start like this for now, yes.” It was evident that the subject was awkward for the both of them, while they themselves weren’t exactly sure as to why. But Castiel appreciated that Dean was trying his best to make him feel welcome, and ensure that he would have his own space and say in everything as well. Which was more than what Castiel could say about most of his past relationships, romantic or otherwise.
So, he grabbed his phone with some apprehension and sure enough, without even checking the caller ID, his hypothesis was confirmed the instant he answered it.
When he reached the end of the bottle, humming, he stood up and walked over a few corpses lying on the floor to go behind the counter, not caring one moment that he was stepping in a thick and sticky pool of blood.
Hoping they were only rushing after the black SUV, Dean turned onto another street as casually as he could, while maintaining his quick pace.
The best part, however, was that he was sharing this moment with Dean next to him. Dean, who was smirking at every single one of his reactions. At his protests or random comments.
“On the flight from Juneau? Yes. I had a large suitcase with me from Chicago to Seattle. But, um, the airline seemed to have misplaced it.”
And Castiel had slowly begun leaning in, but right before their lips could touch, Dean said, “Before I forget, I just have one last question.”
Castiel nodded and carefully stepped closer to face him. While Dean was still holding on to his wrist and gasping, Castiel gently rested his other hand on Dean’s shoulder.
After a minute, during which he tried his best to bury everything down, he took a deep breath and decided he should head back to his room to get his coat and scour the grounds for Dean.
Castiel abruptly sat up, ready to jump to his feet, feeling the adrenaline spread throughout his entire body. But the individual threw a large and heavy object on his chest, causing Castiel to remain seated on his bed, as he watched his assailant fleeing out of his room.
“Bess wanted to bake you something,” said Garth after Dean glanced at him questioningly. “Coming here last month had been a last-minute arrangement for me. I was glad to do it,” he added quickly, “but having known ahead of time, we would have taken the opportunity to include something from the both of us. That’s partially why I volunteered again, and this time, we made sure you’d have a pie.”
“At some point during the night, Bela and I decided to take a mini break from work. We were just talking and there was this…um, moment…All that happened was that Bela, um, let me know that she was single again.”
Dean pursed his lips. “And what does that mean? Like, being branded? Because to me this sounds like ownership or some really creepy thing like that.”
A few minutes passed, and Castiel decided he needed to say at least one more thing to clear the air.
Thanks for letting me stay at your place for the last couple of weeks. I really needed that. Everything is working as it should. No problems with the plumbing either, though you were right about not lingering in the shower for too long.
Glad that Dean was indisputably feeling better, Castiel spent the rest of the flight reflecting on the last twenty-four hours, while Dean snoozed peacefully next to him.
Considering where he was found, and that he had been missing for a big long while, and that nasty rumors about him had been circulating since even before his disappearance, and that I’m not even at the part where a certain footage got very public, a lot of stupid people pointed their finger at Sam and were left uneasy about his “release.”
They stared at each other for a moment, not sure if they needed to add something or not, until Castiel finally broke the awkward silence by suggesting that they should try to get a bit of shut-eye before the morning came.
“I did wait! I didn’t do this, I swear.” He pointed at large containers on the kitchen counter. “Kevin and Ash came by and dropped this off for us both. Aaron made us breakfast.”
Dean, finally coming back to himself, hurriedly passed his hands over his face to wipe away the tears as he tried to regain composure.
Dean smiled, happy to find everything exactly the way he had left it. He retrieved a cold beer from the fridge and sat down on his rocking chair right outside his front door.
But despite their constant brainstorming on the matter, and how much they had wished for it, the week had progressed without one, and the next thing Gabriel had known, Saturday had already arrived.
As the evening progressed, when they eventually continued with their shopping, Dean had caught himself eyeing Castiel’s hand on more than one occasion.
And not only was he present and seemed perfectly happy to be there, he had also dressed up for the occasion.
“Though I’m starting to see why, I thought you said you didn’t entertain in this bed?” said Dean, amused.
Dean took a deep breath. “Because I didn’t know how you’d react. Not—I don’t mean just about the fact that I had lied, though that was a concern, of course, but I mean about me. You—you thought you were talking with Michael. Who has potential. Money. A way out. I’m—even laying out a future with him was complicated because of the different locations. Once he would have been compared with me… I’m a joke, Cas. I can’t go anywhere. I knew you’d be disappointed.”
“Since we can’t leave the ranch because of work, how about some of your friends come and visit you here instead? Like Hannah and Balthazar. Or someone else too. Whoever you’d like.”
Feeling comfortable with the company, Castiel enjoyed hearing funny stories about Dean and Charlie’s misadventures. Like the time they had stopped at a diner on a road trip to Lawrence and the entire menu was vegan, which hadn’t pleased Dean one second. Or the time when Charlie had aided Sam and Dean with shopping for a computer for their father.
There was a long pause. “There’s a lot of things I—I’d like to say right now,” said Castiel, “but I, um, think in the long run, it wouldn’t be fair to either of us if I did.”
“I thought you’d never ask. Shall we? I’m sure you must have done so, knowing you, but I checked the itinerary and—”
Walking down the hallway leading to the dungeon, Sam checked his phone quickly to see if Dean and Castiel had any news, but there were no notifications. He debated on calling them for an update, but then decided that he should simply get the interrogation over with, first.
“It’s not. Leave it open,” said Dean, and after a small smile, he pushed the door slightly, but just to say it wasn’t shut, and then took Castiel’s hand off the handle. And then kissed it.
“Look, it’s not complicated,” said Bevell. “You either both planned this a long time ago or Mr. Winchester made a friend along the way. We’d like to know why prisoner 4010918—who, by the way, has a massive amount of discrepancies in his record—was the only prisoner left behind. After you both escaped Henriksen’s gang, you could have easily gone your separate ways. But you didn’t. We considered the idea that you could have kept him as a hostage, but after looking at his vitals—we had to, as he did look rather glum—we realized that…well, considering
“As your friend is desperately trying to warn you, I’m one of those the Garrisons send in when they aren’t happy with the results.”
Watching him attentively, Gabriel continued brushing the side of Sam’s face with his thumb. “But something is still bothering you.” He observed him a moment, as if he was weighing on something, and then said, “Does this have anything to do with your—your situation? About this other person?”
“Probably not. But when I told Jody about it, she said that it would be a good idea to double check in case some of the stuff you might have received matched the ones I received back in September.”
He passed by the quaint houses near a park. He rode by the town’s only school, which was obviously empty due to the summertime. Not long after reaching a flower shop, he turned on Main Street, which displayed a little more activity, and yet, was still very calm in comparison to the big city busyness he was accustomed to.
With his eyes still shut, and desperate to not wake Dean, Castiel swallowed hard and withdrew his hand as delicately as he could, paying close attention to Dean’s breaths. And just as his hand was nearly free, when his fingers were just reaching the bottom of his shirt, making Castiel believe that he had succeeded, Dean’s hand reached for his.
And he would find Castiel alone, in the afternoon, later that night, or at some point later on that day, and tell him.
She pondered her options briefly, and said, “In less than five hours from now, there’s going to be a very dashing evening on the Inflatus Station. A charitable gala. Where you can go and admire ancient treasures collected from every corner of the galaxy.” She grabbed a device on a cabinet next to them. “There is one item that I would like very much. A necklace.”
Not knowing where else Castiel could have gone, Dean had walked aimlessly into the neighborhood for a very long time. The cold was biting, but his mind was too high on alert to care.
Dean let out a short laugh, tapping his fingers on the counter. “Yeah, well, I—I guess my point is to make sure you’re okay with it too. This whole thing is kind of unfair to you.”
Hearing the birds singing, Dean peeked at the spring sun. The snow was melting and soon, the warm weather would roll in. And still beaming, he stared at the faceless mountain. The giant was gone, but the story and vibe somewhat remained.
convinced you to both pretend to be interested in each other as he knew perfectly it would annoy Dean.
They hadn’t done anything extraordinary. They hadn’t felt like they needed to constantly talk or entertain themselves.
And even though they knew they were both being silly about it, it took them a long time before dealing with the petals.
The notion that soon he would find himself in this very spot had been Castiel’s only small comfort on his way back.
“No. They might be sad to not see you as long as they wanted, but no one is going to be mad. I promise.”
. Some got wind of the whole Michael thing, and even though there was no way of proving it, as it’s not true, they threatened to pin the whole thing on you and—it doesn’t matter now, because they’re gone, and all of it was bullshit anyway. But I just—I couldn’t put you through that. Not again. Not if I could help it.”
“What? Oh, um, no. I—I, actually, rain check? I’m gonna call it a night,” he said, pointing at his door, down the hall.
Dean fixed his clothes as though it would erase the whole episode, and while he still wasn’t happy with the situation, his moment of anger with Gabriel had considerably diminished.
Although it hadn’t been mentioned to them, they judged that they should probably wear something else than jeans and flannel shirts for dinner given the overall touch of elegance of the restaurant Dean had in mind.
Castiel wasn’t that old-fashioned and he supposed that if the situation had been reversed, and that nothing would happen between them, there wasn’t a reason for alarm.
It seemed as though only seconds had passed, but when Dean woke up, he found Castiel quietly sitting in the passenger seat, an hour later.
As he watched Castiel making his way towards a two-story house, with an actual white picket fence, Dean pondered on the short conversation that had just occurred.
Dean swallowed. “Not what I wanted,” he breathed. And even though it had been the truth, he also knew that stating this fact was only making things even more complicated.
“And that’s why I hesitated with you. I didn’t know how to handle any of this. I really didn’t think you were dishonest. And that’s why messing this up was the last thing I wanted to do.”
One last day of them holding their breaths and Castiel and Dean could finally be free of this weight.
Gabriel stared at him. “Cas, I know I’m in no position—no position, whatsoever—to tell you what to do, but you can’t ever do this again. Taking off alone like that? Ever.”
Nevertheless, he had to admit that having Godstiel by his side, who didn’t require an actual door to access hell, had its advantages.
“He says so. I know he will be. Don’t worry, we’ll still check up on him. But that’s not why I called you though. Look, I hate to do this at the last minute and during weekdays, but we’re swamped here. We got delayed this weekend, as you know, so I was already planning on staying over later than usual this week to keep up, but now that Jim’s gone too… I’ll be able to do most of it myself, but if you could help me out tonight and tomorrow after your football practice, then maybe that will save me from burning the midnight oil all week. Bobby agreed to help me out this weekend, so I’ll give you the entire weekend off, this one and the next after that, too,” he added to sweeten the deal.
And even though everything Dean had just said made perfect sense to Castiel, he couldn’t help but think that there was more to this story than Dean was telling him.
“Better, I suppose. But he’s sleeping. And he needs it.” Donna nodded. “The more he sleeps, the better he’ll feel when he wakes up.”
From his now strong jaw and neck, to his long and slim torso, all the way down to his waist and his already long legs. And that was for starters.
And while they were intimate, they also didn’t force the issue about sex. Almost like a couple undertaking a short period of abstinence before the wedding.
who I had strong feelings for, not unlike how I feel for Dean, but obviously not as strongly. No one ever equaled him.”
“That’s where you’re wrong. Unlike Castiel and Dean who had to rely on curses and enchantments of sorts to improve themselves—”
He gave Castiel a faint smile in the mirror before refocusing his eyes on the street ahead, hoping he hadn’t overshared.
“I just—I feel like I need to clarify that nothing happened,” said Gabriel, pointing at the bed. “Well, okay. Maybe not ‘nothing,’” he said, gesturing air quotes. “But we didn’t…”
Castiel opened his mouth to reply, but shut it quickly. After taking a moment to compose himself, he said, “It is Dean who came to me with this information. Not a lawyer or a representative. He came here, himself, accompanied by his remaining family members, even though they must have a million other obligations they should be dealing with at the moment, including Mr. Winchester’s funeral. He spoke to me. Presented me his research.
“He told me to!” he snapped at her. “I told him I wanted to stay and I never fucking meant something that deeply in my life, even if—” he stopped as his voice was breaking. He swallowed hard and took a minute to calm himself down. “Why are you telling me this? Even if Dean—I still can’t. It’s not just about the ranch. Or Dean. It’s about everyone else.”
“You mean…” incapable of finishing the sentence, Castiel stopped there and focused all his attention on Mick.
Gabriel was still x-raying him. “Good thing there’s a party then, right?” Dean nodded, biting the inside of his cheek. “Anything could happen,” continued Gabriel. “I hope Cas can relax a little. And, um, who knows? Maybe
When Castiel arrived at the entrance with his bag, Dean was waiting for him with only a small backpack as well.
,” said Lucifer, suddenly changing to a more playful tone, “perhaps he’s having the most carnal dream of
Where he could finally apologize without rambling. Or worrying that Sam might hear something that was best kept unknown to him. Or being interrupted by whatever dramatic event was about to be dropped on their heads.
“I’ll go check on Isaac and the others, and then I’ll catch up with you to see Ellen and the baby,” said John, smiling at his wife’s eagerness to see the newborn. He then turned to his son. “Do you want to say hello with me, Dean? Or would you prefer going with Mom, Sammy and Tamara?”
“I told you, it’s tradition. Everyone in the family has a pair. And I just—I really just want to make sure you feel welcome here. Saying that you’re pretty much saving us all is an understatement. I appreciate it and I won’t forget it. Like, no matter what happens after, I won’t forget this.”
And for an instant more it had seemed like it had been a product of his imagination, much to his dismay.
“You can’t change anything,” continued Chuck. He hadn’t said in a warning tone, but just as a matter of fact, which made it far worse.
And the same could be said for Dean. Davies actually liked Venandi and often wished the BMoL would chill on their hatred for them.
Everyone dug in and helped themselves, and Castiel and Dean (though mostly Dean) began filling them in on the details of the night before.
There was only one thing left to do that morning. He picked up the phone at the front desk and called Dean’s room.
Sam let out a little laugh and said, “I believe you, but I might rethink the location. Don’t think that’s gonna slow him down.”
After he exhaled deeply, as if he had been holding his breath since Crowley’s departure, Dean said, “Did that just happened or am I still asleep?”
“Because of my whole track record with long term relationships... Namely that there isn’t much to tell. It didn’t really bother me before. I just figured that I had time or—but I—" he cleared his throat. “And now, I—I’m not sure why, but it felt like overnight I kept being cornered by everyone around me who incessantly commented about my relationship status. Or more specifically, about my lack of having one. People kept asking me when I’d finally settle down, openly and constantly fixing me up with someone—without even consulting me—and I—and I know they mean well—some of them, anyway—but…it’s gotten to the point that now I just feel—I—” and the rest of his sentence died in his throat, as he felt it tighten.
“Oh, sorry Dean,” he said. “I already asked Benny. I was here really early and the teacher announced to those of us already present that we would be working in pairs for most of the class today.”
Uncertain if that was a good thing or not, Dean nonetheless thanked his father, and was soon greeted by Sam and Mary, who were both sitting in the living room, seemingly in a deep discussion, on his arrival.
Dean nodded. “Right. You mentioned them before. I didn’t know they weren’t here though. I just figured you hung out at their place or something.”
Not sure what to make of his last comment, Dean then said, “Okay. Well, that—that’s not—I’m just a bit off today, I guess. Nothing’s wrong.” He paused for a second and wanting to prove it to Castiel, he asked, “What are you looking forward to the most once you’re back home tonight? Or for the rest of your weekend?”
He had also been comforted when he received an email from Hannah, nearly two weeks after his arrival. Although she was still evidently upset that he had left, and this so quickly, it seemed now that she was no longer cross with him as she had been before and supported Castiel in his decision.
Sam and Castiel were dancing. They were playing that freaking dance video game him and Sam always liked to play to amuse their mother.
After what felt like an eternity to him, Gabriel pressed his shoulder against Sam’s, and said, “How about we start by getting you home first, and then depending on what’s the situation there, we’ll see what’s what?
By the time they finished decorating the tree, Castiel heard his stomach growling, which earned him a laugh from Dean.
And avoiding Dean was exactly what Castiel was planning on doing from now on. Even though he had reasoned that his idea of moving out had simply been a momentary freak out on his part, he had caught himself contemplating the idea during most of the day. And with the weekend beginning in a few hours, the dread of Sunday morning was enough to nearly make Castiel’s hands shake.
She let out a short laugh. “Are you kidding? You caused quite the buzz around here and everyone is really eager to meet you. I was so mad I missed your arrival yesterday. But anyways, I still knew it was you the second I looked at you.”
“Um…do you want me to hand him a questionnaire when I see him next?” said Dean, half-laughing, as they continued eating.
“It still is. The donation part, I mean. Look, I don’t know the whole story, but apparently there was an issue last year with some of the volunteers, so this time, they decided to offer their own Gift Wrapping services. Nothing has changed. Every customer is entitled to the services, to donate however much they want, and all the funds goes to the Children’s Hospital, just like last year. The only difference is that the store is employing people instead of relying on volunteers.”
Castiel realized he had made a mistake and had mentioned a little detail he would have preferred keeping to himself. “I—what I meant was—”
After the few stolen hours that they had had earlier that day, he believed that there was no better time to finally have a proper discussion.
“Dean. What’s up?” She picked up one of the mini-boxes of chocolate and said, “Want one? I’m supposed to make sure everyone who passes by gets one of these. Freebies.”
“You both know that’s the rule if there is an issue,” said Mary. “Even if it’s late. Even if you think you’ll be in trouble. You’re really lucky. Something horrible could have had happened.”
The morning came by much faster than Dean would have liked. He had passed the entire night tossing and turning. Furious with himself to have yet again fallen for this trap.
“No. I—it’s not like that.” And while the overall tone of his statement might have been believable, the fact that it had taken him slightly longer to answer than it should have, somewhat contradicted his words. Castiel lowered his eyes, as he leaned on the counter, feeling defeated. He grabbed his drink and gulped it down. Nearly coughing, he shifted on his seat. “I’m sorry,” he finally said, glancing at Mick. “I didn’t mean to lie. Or to waste your time. I—I really do appreciate your company. And I wish I could just…”
But that was unnecessary as another set of hands immediately seized him and dragged him to his feet.
The good thing here about Castiel and Dean is that at least they were together. Even though they were ridiculous about it, and kept stupidly insisting that they weren’t, we know the truth, and it is that they were. Together.
Yeah, so that was more or less what Dean and Castiel were experiencing in that moment, and yet, they knew that they couldn’t leave without their target.
“I’m sorry, Jack. It seems that Daddy’s not fully awake yet.” And after a glance at the counter, he added, “And, of course, I’m afraid that was the last of the cinnamon bread. I know we usually keep it for Sunday morning, but I guess we’ll have to make due with cereal this morning. We can eat the sweet ones we keep for special late snacks. How does that sound?”
They helped themselves to some of the appetizers, which consisted of cheese sticks—regular and Jalapeño ones—lemon and pepper chicken wings, sweet potato fries and garlic bread.
Dean, annoyed, gave him a nod as he was ready to move on from this conversation. Minutes following this, they left their eatery to get the codes and the informant.
Castiel stared at him with a sharp look. He swayed forward until he stood directly in front of Dean. The points of their feet touched. In fact, their noses practically did as well. Dean, fighting the urge to step back, stood his ground.
Anael turned to him quickly and said, “Yes. A fact I would rather not call attention to. So keep it down.”
“An idea, which was highly supported by you and, not to mention, most of what happened last night was still
“Then, I’ll just wait the whole day, that’s all. I’ll tend to the groceries later in the afternoon.”
“That’s still so nice of you,” she told him, and then turned to Castiel. “He was going to leave, but since I was already making breakfast for us, I thought he could join us. You could take the car if you want, but I just thought since he went through the trouble of asking…might as well wait for you.”
“I wanted to help you. Like I said I would. There’s still plenty to do in the, um, overall of the situation, but since I cost you your job, I thought I’d start there and I—I made a few calls. And I found you potential employment. I have five job offerings already lined up for you so far.”
In the lounge room, he put his sad pizza for one on the table for later, sighed deeply and dropped on one of the couches.
Dean gasped. He stared at the door. Castiel’s shadow was gone from the door’s window. But his voice was clear. He was right behind that door.
“Definitely,” said Castiel, grinning as he was hit with fond memories. “Both only child. Same school. Even at university. We both went to Georgetown. She was majoring in political science and I was pre-med.”
Writing had always been a nice alternative to get his point across, so he hoped that it would suffice.
Which was why, when he found Castiel’s note on Wednesday night, he was plagued with a moment of panic.
Recovering from his initial shock, Castiel rolled his chair closer to his brother, handing him one of the food containers he had snatched.
“Sorry. Maybe everything is stagnant right now because nothing can be done until the six months? It's possible that revelations will surface as we approach the deadline.”
Once Sam was satisfied that Dean had sufficiently calmed down, he informed Dean that right before taking the road back to Chicago earlier that day, he had given Bobby a call to let him know of the situation about Dean’s state and the location of his car.
The property was massive. Ridiculously so, Castiel had always found. The exterior features of the house, such as the multiple windows, the warm brick, and a long impressive walkway behind the gates, had always been cause for admiration around the neighborhood. To them, it conveyed a peaceful, impeccable and respectful home. Once, Castiel had even heard someone identify it as distinguished.
“Was an accident,” said Samuel, cutting him off. “Yes. I know. You told me.” He pursed his lips and shot a stern look at him. “I will have my talk with Sam about that, alone, later this afternoon. As I ought to.”
“Jack, listen,” said Dean in an unwavering voice. “We know it was an accident. We don’t blame you. It happens. And we do
. Who is a real person. I know you say that—he’s real and I’ve been with—no.” He shook his head. “I sent this to his personal address. In Fairbanks. Not—not to Dean Winchester in Juneau or—
And they shook hands. Maybe a little longer than Castiel deemed acceptable, but Dean had kept hold of his hand, looking him straight in the eyes. Almost as if he was trying to read Castiel’s mind. Finally, when Castiel got his hand back, Dean fetched something from his pocket. A silvery flask.
As soon as everyone was settled, the waiter came in to drop off some additional menus and informed them of the specials of the day. Since Chuck, Becky and Gabriel were ready to order, and a quick scan of the menu sufficed for Sam and Dean to make a selection, the group didn’t waste any time and began their order.
After what seemed like an eternity to Dean, Castiel said, “We usually have long hours during weekends like this. And as it’s partially why I’m here—to help my brother,” Castiel reminded him, “I’m afraid I won’t be able to wander too far off from the shop, even in the evenings.”
“We work together.” Sam blew on his coffee, giving himself an excuse to avoid Gabriel’s eyes in that moment.
“Sold,” said Gabriel as he mimicked striking a gavel on the counter. “To the gorgeous man in front of me.”
“Honestly Gabe, the moment that—everything was kind of a blur. All I remember was that I needed to get out of there as fast as I could. I ended up at a park and sat there. It was cold.”
“I—I don’t really want to talk about Lisa, right now,” he said, looking at Castiel right in the eyes with no intention of diverting his gaze.
“And if something changes,” said Sam, “or we feel like we could make something work, we tell the other?”
“But that’s his problem—and he has a lot of those at the moment, so he really shouldn’t talk. But I’m not here because of Michael.”
Naturally, Samuel had been skeptical. But before he began asking questions which Dean had no answers for, Dean had the good sense to distract him with something else instead: by informing him that he was looking for another job.
Castiel leaned back his head, scanned Dean’s face for a second, and until he said, “Then prove it. Kiss me.”
“No, silly bean. You, working with the clientele. I didn’t hear everything you said to him, but from what you reported, and how quickly you dealt with the situation—without aggravation—I honestly cannot say I would have pulled this off. You’re brilliant. I know you like the greenhouse, but you—you should visit us more often. You’re good at this.”
He deposited the note right next to the other three glasses of water he had left by Dean’s nightstand, making sure to not wake him.
“Look, I know how you feel about this,” continued Gabriel. “I know it’s why you’re treading carefully with Dean. You worry about what might happen, but there’s only one way you’re gonna find out.”
“What? What do you mean? Okay, it’s not the way I would have made my approach, but hey, until you mentioned that goat skin, it wasn’t half-bad. That was almost adorable even.”
He gave him a firm nod and hoisted his duffel bag over his shoulder, and Castiel watched him walk towards a small cabin—the one the pilot had disappeared to on their arrival—which was not far from a larger building that Castiel could only deduce to be a hangar, based on its large doors.
The words came out of Dean’s mouth the instant he had successfully met Lisa at her locker during recess.
The interesting part was that Sam wasn’t the only one with gawky eyes. Castiel had caught his brother observing Sam with lingering looks as well.
Grateful that he had taken the time to study those maps, even if he obviously didn’t know all the streets by heart, his efforts seemed to have paid off when finally, he managed to lose them.
As for Castiel’s surprise dish, it had been a good gamble: smoky maple barbecue sauce ribs, with roasted rosemary and garlic potatoes and vegetables.
And in that moment, Castiel had to admit that his kid had been onto them since day one. “I do. And I think Dean likes us, too. Which is why I—” Castiel stopped mid-sentence.
A considerable amount of time passed. He had then taken his seat back, thinking that sitting down would perhaps help more for his nerves.
So, I was nearly done tearing down the second family—so to speak, of course, I like to watch, thank you—when all the fun paused because some beggars were at the atmosphere limits and were being super aggressive about being granted permission to land.
As for Castiel, the moment he heard the man’s unnecessary insults and bad attitude, he adopted his deadpan expression and looked the man straight in the eyes. He didn’t let it show, but he was now boiling inside.
They stared at each other awkwardly for a moment, until Dean realized what he was doing and said, “All right. Um, I guess, I’ll leave you to your stuff.”
Castiel squinted back at the main building on their right, which still looked like an elegant barn. “I am,” he admitted. “Something is different. That or it’s just been too long and I’m remembering it differently.”
He took off his coat and boots with great effort, let himself fall onto the nearest chair in the kitchen, and buried his face in his hands.
“Just curious.” And after a few seconds of being under Castiel’s stare, he then added, letting out a fake laugh, “Forget it. It’s—it’s none of my business.”
Approaching the side of the bed, Castiel took hold of his hand and paused for a second. Even though he was sure Dean wouldn’t have any objection, he didn’t want to simply climb over him. It seemed too forced for his taste that way.
The cabin was essentially one room, with the exception of the bathroom. Castiel counted his blessings that there was a toilet and that he wouldn’t have to run outside in the middle of winter.
Although Donatello hadn’t given Dean a specific address, the brothers had no doubt that Team Free Dark was waiting for them at their old home, and therefore, had also no intention to simply stand by. They wanted to act now.
After doing so, Dean sighed deeply and sat on one of the chairs, as he firmly believed he wouldn’t be able to do so for very long.
As for Sam and Castiel, the rest of their evening had been rather uneventful after meeting with Gabriel. He had insisted on dropping them off himself at the Winchester’s home where they were both greeted by a cheerful Mary.
“Sam’s not wrong. And what happened between us, what we—when we…” Dean stepped closer, now squeezing his hand. “You have no idea how happy I am that—I’m just—I hate the way it ended. And I was worried that you—that I—”
“He kissed me,” repeated Castiel. “I kissed him back. But things got…” Castiel ended his sentence there.
And then his eyes fell on Castiel, who simply stood there, expressionless and seemingly unperturbed.
Castiel’s legs were failing him, and soon his captors were holding him up more to help him stand rather than keeping him grounded.
Dean shook his head again, harboring a faint smile. “It’s okay. Take your time. I’ll—I’ll call Sam. You told me he tried to call this morning.”
He stayed put for a second, and then slowly took off the sunglasses. Castiel extended his arm to grab them and stash them away for the time being, but Jack held on to them, and laid them delicately on the table, not far from the condiments.
“Sam,” groaned Dean. “If he wants to act like a warden, that’s his prerogative. But I’m not going to act like a prisoner.”
Just as the pilot had done for Castiel’s backpack, the man carefully installed his luggage, a green duffel bag, on one of the two free seats left, and dropped into the one next to Castiel.
“All right, listen up, you punks! I have a bad news,” said Rufus, the football coach, on Friday morning in the locker room. “Well, it could be good news. It depends which way you wanna look at it.” The whole football team had been called in for an emergency meeting, which created a lot of anxiety in the air on a day of a big game. “I don’t know the specifics yet, but I’ve just been informed this morning that tonight’s game is cancelled.”
He attempted the best he could to get himself back on his feet, but it was difficult. One side of his head felt hot and stung horribly. His right shoulder had been stabbed and his chest felt heavy from the blows he had received.
“So from what I understand,” said Gabriel, “is that we should prepare for all eventualities, which includes making sure to keep the top bunk available for Cas.”
“You didn’t,” he told Dean. “It wasn’t your fault. It was mine.” Dean frowned as he watched Sam lowering his eyes to the ground. “The only reason why Gordon caught me was because I…I sneaked out of the apartment. I shouldn’t have. And I only did because I—I was mad that you just kept to yourself and I—it was so stupid.”
to what we can do as well. So, in the coming weeks, I’d suggest increasing your level of caution.” And then, with his eyes still on Castiel, he added, “Why don’t you tell us what happened once you left the Princes’ residence, Dean.”
“Dean, may I ask what was really bothering you at the beginning of the evening? I know you said it was nothing, but I—I’d like to make sure you are indeed all right.”
In a desperate attempt to address the issue as indirectly as possible, thus hoping to not expose himself further, Castiel asked, “How’s Lisa?” Before he could register Dean’s reaction, he then forced himself to turn his back to him. “I felt really awful.” Looking out the window, he focused his stare on the empty street, without truly observing it.
“Really?” asked Sam, uneasy. “I—obviously I was wondering if now was the best time to tell you guys all this after yesterday, but I—I wasn’t sure if—I, um,” he said, before clearing his throat as he shifted on his seat.
, which hadn’t been overly promising, Castiel had been pleasantly surprised by the apartment. It was far more spacious and modern than his current place, and he could have his own parking space and access to a storage room in the basement, with no additional fee.
The fresh, chilly winter air rendered Castiel’s cheeks and the tip of his nose numb on the following Friday night, as he and Dean headed into
Dean nodded shyly. “Thank you.” They both looked at each other awkwardly, not knowing what else to say.
Castiel briefly turned his gaze away from Dean, pondering on what to ask. And then he thought of something. “Why was Sam hoping I’d be dressed as an astronaut?”
Which was why he said, “Dean, we’re here. All four of us. Together. I’m not saying we go in blindly, but he had been fair last time. Besides, if he meant us any harm, given that he knows everything about us like you just said, he could have easily dropped in on us and we would have never seen him coming. But instead, he called us.”
“Yes. There’s this old theatre near my apartment. The popcorn is delicious and they often show classics. I like going to those.”
“I was very clear about the risks and that it is never possible to predict the outcome. And might I add, the spell
“But I want to stay,” he added in an imploring voice. “So I’m only leaving if you tell me to do so.” He lifted his eyes. “But you have to be the one to say it,” he whispered.
Tears were nearly forming at the corner of his eyes. It had come back to them. Perhaps not in the way he had expected…but it was there.
“Now that we know the specifics of the spell, what about your price? I imagine you want to be compensated for your help.”
Following his lead and continuing their burning kiss, Castiel then eased his left leg over him, slowly positioning himself over him.
Once Gabriel was settled in, Sam stepped towards the bed, but as he took hold of the covers, Gabriel lifted his arm as a warning, which made Sam pause.
By taxi, they arrived at the ranch in the dead of the night, partially relieved by the fact that they wouldn’t have to explain anything to anyone at this time. They paid the driver a generous tip for having driven them all the way there.
“Yeah. But that’s mostly during the summer. It helps with the tourists. We still have guests during the winter, of course, but for the big events, outdoor activities are much more pleasant in the summer season than in the dead of winter.”
Gabriel made a face. “I don’t know, Cas. All this pining, that’s not right for the soul. That’s why I’ve never allowed myself to reach that point.”
For their next slides, they then tried multiple combinations. Dean slid down with Whiskey on the saucer sled.
Laughing, Castiel said, “Growing up, we didn’t really have that many rituals for Christmas, except the Christmas breakfast brunch. But Jack is usually up rather early, and given that we spend most of the day at his grandparents where there is an abundance of food…brunch isn’t really a good idea. Therefore, by cooking most of our Christmas breakfast the night before, all I have to do in the morning is warming it up while we open the presents. And that way, we are both hungry by the time we get to the Klines’ and I still get my epic breakfast.”
With John and Mary busy listening carefully to Jody about the procedure on how to get the car back as they were seeing her out, Sam and Dean, who were still seated at the table, took advantage of the situation to discreetly exchange a few words.
Of course, Castiel was always surprised when someone was reaching out to him in such a personal way.
It was hidden just behind a large tree. And although it wasn’t made of wood, but rather of white and gray stone, it was charming, private and cozy-looking like Henry’s cabin. Nothing extravagant. Simple, but practical. And beautiful.
Daphne, who was incredibly nice, was perhaps the reminder Dean needed. After all, it wasn’t as though he had forgotten about the fact that Castiel was engaged. Nor had Castiel hidden it. Nor had he openly flirted with Dean despite it all.
For the past couple of weeks, dinner had occurred much later than usual, because Dean had been working relentlessly, not unlike it had been in December
Dean left his eggs for a moment, and leaning on the counter, he took a sip of his coffee as he watched Castiel.
Smirking at him, Dean said, “Are you always this methodic before sex or is this just for my personal benefit?”
It didn’t matter if Castiel hadn’t given him another location. As long as they wouldn’t remain on that spot like sitting ducks, it was enough for Dean.
With a sigh, he put his phone back in his pocket, reminding himself to focus instead on the good news he had just received.
Feeling his brain turn to mush due to exhaustion, Dean said, “I really don’t understand what you’re saying.”
And just as he was cheering himself up with that idea, turning the corner to reach Rowena’s office, he ran smack into someone.
With a heavy heart, Dean took another bite of his pie, trying not to resent the fact that he had parents in that moment.
“I was teasing. But I meant it. I’d do way more than that, Cas. If I—I’d—because I—but—” and the rest of his sentence died in his throat.
Dean nearly jumped out of his skin. A hand over his heart, he turned to his left only to realize someone was standing next to him.
Facing the door, Dean, key card in hand, stalled a moment, as if he was weighing on saying something.
“Well, aren’t you a sight for sore eyes. Especially since I’ve been meaning to have a word with you for a big long while now,” said Gordon.
A tiny object. An ornament. It wasn’t jewelry. Not exactly. Nor was it flashy. It was simple and effective.
As for Dean, he was focusing all his attention on the back of their naked guide’s head. He wasn’t observing how people were occupying their time around them, nor was he scanning the place for security measures like Castiel was. He just stared at the head of the guy in front of them.
“Because of my fuck up with Lisa. And that I was too—” Dean ran his hands over his face. And stayed hidden behind them.
All of it was fake, of course. Intentionally so and purely for the purpose of celebrating the story of Sam and Dean, so Becky had told them.
“Um, he—he gave Jack a Star Wars movie collection. He’s been going through them again all week long in—”
And something told Sam that this was their way of letting them know the location of their big finish.
, actually.” Seemingly about to elaborate further on his viewpoint, Sam then turned quiet and stabbed his salad with his fork, adopting a casual attitude.
He left the door slightly open for a bit of additional light, just as he always did, and went down the stairs as quietly as he could.
“I think it’s better if both my hands are occupied.” He let out a deep breath, scanning Castiel’s face.
Dean promptly walked away without any ceremony, went to his room, shut the door calmly, changed his clothes as quickly as possible and slid under the covers.
And the next thing he knew, he grabbed Castiel’s arm, pulled him towards him, and after quickly bringing his hands on each side of Castiel’s face, he kissed him hard on the mouth.
On the next morning, the crew at the ranch were extremely curious to know why they had come back so soon from their trip, but Castiel and Dean’s grim faces hadn’t prompted people to inquire too deeply about it.
“Because I panicked. Okay? I know it’s a dumb excuse, but that’s what happened. I mean, God, I—I knew I liked you, but—but what happened between us—being with you—the way you—I wasn’t expecting it to be like this. I mean, I don’t know about you, but that wasn’t just blowing off steam for me. It meant something. And—”
But he also didn’t want to pry. Dean was entitled to his privacy—something he had not often been granted from the rest of the town.
“Eliot? Who—” and the rest of his sentence died in his throat. He gripped the wheel a moment. “The Christmas sleepover party. That’s—that’s this weekend,” he said to himself, not believing he had forgotten.
“But you said—when did he leave? How could he leave without—it was the pilot’s idea to regroup at around seven thirty!”
Unable to recall the last time his grandfather had had a visitor, Dean was puzzled. He glanced at Sam, and once he assessed that he was still sleeping, he slowly climbed out of bed and tiptoed his way down the hallway.
Uriel took a sip of his drink, his eyes studying Dean a moment and then said to Zachariah, “What did you have in mind for Dean? Move him to another garage? Work on the cars?”
Swiftly covering the stranger with his own jacket, fearing he might freeze to death, Dean grew anxious after the man fell unconscious. Unable to get a response out of him, Dean then opted for the only sensible choice: he hastily carried him to his cabin.
“Um, no, you didn’t. I—that was the plan initially. I postponed it last year because I wasn’t sure where I wanted to apply and other stuff too, but, um—anyways, I don’t think I will do it at all now.”
And without asking, Dean grabbed one of Castiel’s slices and continued eating with a smirk on his face.
“But if you allow me this one indulgence, I have to say that I am particularly grateful this year, because all my brother’s children were finally able to attend tonight,” she said, pointing at a small group of four near the tree, and then turned to Castiel, “including his youngest, and my favourite nephew, who’s been particularly
“I know, sweetie. But I just wanted to make sure. There’s food in the fridge—good food, now—and also—”
“Why you’ll be late for dinner?” said the clerk, almost amused. “Don’t worry. Already sent out the word via radio the moment Lafitte decided to stay grounded. Fairbanks and company will know what’s what.”
“Dean, sorry,” barged in Bobby. “Sorry,” he repeated. “Cas. Donna,” he nodded to them, and returned his attention to Dean. “Um, you’re needed at the front. Adler showed up.”
Sam let out a deep sigh. “You’re probably right. It’s just…I’m not used to this and it makes me uncomfortable.”
I leaned towards him, and since he wasn’t moving, I gently pressed my fingers on his neck to check his pulse.
As he thought back on that particular conversation, Dean remembered that today—at this very moment—was the day of Sam’s date with Gabriel.
Castiel bit his lips, and after a brief contemplation, he said, “I—I have—are you free this Saturday?”
A heavy silence dropped around them. Sam shifted on his feet, while Dean, his eyes glued to Patrick, couldn’t help but shape his hands into fists.
Usually, another of Castiel’s co-workers, Benjamin, who was incredibly nice and accommodating, nearly always accepted to step in when a situation such as this one would occur late at night, knowing that Castiel had a young child to tend to.
“Many of the positions available to me at the beginning were often seasonal. And, um, some of these positions at the beginning were—it was decided I should perhaps be relocated elsewhere.”
So, after a long night of reflection, Castiel, loathing confrontations and often at a loss with social cues, decided to leave a note of apology on Dean’s doormat the next morning.
Jack observed them a moment more, seemingly trying to discern the lie. He glanced at the glasses, and just as Castiel was bracing himself for another awkward revelation from Belphegor, Jack simply returned to his drawing, and said, “Okay.”
“Dean? I just need to make sure I understood properly, okay? You’re saying that it was Zachariah’s promise to keep Gordon at bay and Gordon didn’t listen?”
And yet, Dean took the time to browse the place. To look at his pictures and drawings on his fridge. To examine the pile of second hand books by the couch, waiting to be read.
And that worry—that nagging feeling spreading slowly in his mind—stayed with him for the rest of the day.
Not sure where to begin, they both stared at each other quietly for a moment, until Gabriel said, “So, you know Bela.”
“I was. I just made sure you weren’t looking. But I paid attention. It actually came to a point where I didn’t even need to look at you. Recalling your face, your body shape, your build, every detail was imprinted in my brain.”
side of the narrative, of which Dean was still in the dark about certain details. A fact that Castiel was in no hurry to remedy.
“We haven’t decided yet. I am, in a way, looking forward to it. Taking a break is always a good thing, and I confess that I haven’t had the chance to do so myself in years, but—”
Unfortunately for Dean, once he finally stepped out of his car and walked to his front door, that was exactly what was displayed to him in the living room window.
And while Castiel didn’t comment on the matter, he in fact kept his gaze firmly focused on the horizon, Dean could have sworn that he had seen a faint smile creep momentarily on his lips, only to disappear as quickly as it had appeared.
with limitations, and nothing more. And it hits me like a ton of bricks every goddamn time I remember it.”
“The weather was the culprit as well,” said Castiel. “And today was just—anyway, I just felt like coming home early tonight.”
While Dean’s pronunciation wasn’t sloppy like that of a drunk, it was still obvious that he must have consumed a few beers.
Castiel couldn’t believe it. Dean was telling him everything he wanted to hear, and it wasn’t as a joke or said in a sarcastic manner, either. His tone was sincere.
Dean couldn’t remember coming across this name before. Written or otherwise. It was such an unusual name. He would have remembered if he had.
Castiel nodded absently. He understood Dean’s reasoning, even if that wasn’t how Castiel had approached the situation on his end.
And as he watched Dean hurrying down to the truck, Castiel was sure he had caught Dean wiping off tears.
The growing pit in his stomach was a big indication of where he stood about that idea. Never mind if Samuel wouldn’t like it, he
Knowing exactly what Dean was planning on doing, he leaned down quickly, grabbed Dean’s hands and placed them on his shoulders, thus stopping him from reaching out for his cock.
Dean wrapped his arms around him, so he wouldn’t completely fall. He froze, however, once he noticed various scars were slowly appearing on Castiel’s face. He almost looked as though he had been scorched.
And then, there was Castiel’s blue fire. It wasn’t simply warming up Dean’s cold fingertips and toes faster than a regular flame. It also chased away dark thoughts the moment Dean would find himself within its vicinity.
He wanted to know if they had felt the quake. If they had noticed a drastic difference in the air as he had. If they knew what he had been up to.
“If you took one look at yourself in a mirror, you wouldn’t bloody think that,” he argued. With Castiel apparently determined to remain silent, he continued speaking. “Look mate, you have two choices. You go back and fix things with him—”
After a few cups, Dean went to the bathroom, and Castiel walked to the kitchen for a refill. Once he arrived at the counter, however, he noticed the bottle was already empty. Vaguely remembering something about other bottles in the so-called office, he dashed over there quickly.
Castiel Novak had always done the right thing to the best of his abilities. His life, though perhaps not filled with excitement, was far from being awful.
“That’s why I never bothered with anything with Jess, even though I like her a lot. I just thought it wouldn’t be fair to her, because on that day, it was pretty clear that there would always be someone else I would like even more.”
“Please. Do you know how long we’ve been waiting for this one to bring someone?” they said, pointing at Castiel.
The mouth-watering aroma of chili peppers and lime mixed with meat had long reached Castiel’s nose before his eyes snapped open. Gripping the edge of the couch, he sat up abruptly. “Dean, no! You’re not supposed to—” he started saying, but the rest of his sentence died in his throat, when he realized that Dean was not the one cooking.
“We are driving the 1971 Buick right now. That’s not a car you would spot on every corner street, no?”
“Sam and Jess aren’t here this Christmas. They already left for Jess’ parents. They usually stay here at the ranch, because—but the situation is different this year. I insisted that we’d be fine and that I wouldn’t work. And the crew, well…Bobby assured me like a hundred times a day that they had everything under control. And I’m pretty sure Donna said she’d kick my ass if I stayed here on purpose. So, here we are.”
“He seems nice,” said Anna. “I can take care of this while you go talk to him. And, um, we’re almost closing, so…you know, take your time. No one else is out there.”
But an hour into their errands, Sam started to answer with a few actual sentences instead of monosyllabic words.
“I agree with Sam,” said Patrick. “The spell is no use against them since the context, connection and—well, just about everything is different here. I can see what I can come up with, but in the meantime, you should ask yourself why this happened.”
“Considering what happened to my parents,” said Dean softly, finishing his sentence. And Castiel squeezed his hand.
“We did. So much that a few months back, we started looking into it. There’s a lot of things that don’t add up. And it dates further back than we initially thought. Long story short, it looks like we have more than just one mole. The ranch is okay, it’s safe, but…That’s always been Granddad’s baby. He’s had many other businesses, a few overseas in fact, but the ranch…it’s his. And while it expanded, he managed to keep it exactly how he wanted it. I think that’s why we stand out so much. We constantly have offers to buy and to invest, which is why many of our current investors often felt that we should go bigger. And the most obvious move to do this would be to make it a public company instead of a private one.” He lifted his hand. “I cannot press this enough that this was the last thing Granddad wanted for the ranch. He’s been pressured into it for years and he always put his foot down.”
“I’m the one who should have warned you. I told you, I’m used to it. I forget that people don’t know. I actually assumed you knew.”
“Is this your way of telling me I look like crap?” he asked her, already chewing on his sandwich, which prompted Mrs. Butters to squint at him about manners.
Even though he had said nothing whatsoever regarding the rumors in his messages, it was obvious that Balthazar knew about them. The number of messages he had left him was a big indication of this, as he had texted, emailed and called Castiel nearly every day since. Which was why, once Castiel had read every single one of his friend’s messages, he called him right away.
But Castiel continued rambling. “And I—it’s not just that. I don’t know what to do.” He sighed, disconcerted at everything. “Over here, in my house, I don’t usually—there is a reason why I don’t, um…”
“I’m fine, little bro,” he said, taking a sip of his coffee. “It goes directly to the heart, but I’m fine. Besides…” he said with a smile and a direct change of tone that made Castiel nervous about what would follow, “...I wouldn’t dream of crashing your private time with Dean. That is one upside to our stupid sibling drama. The longer you’re there, the better. And now, I get to ask for an update: how is everything going with Dean? Any progress?”
Then, he finally said, “I’m sorry, um—Dean? Was it?” Dean nodded, holding his breath. “I—I’m sorry, Dean. We really are all out of apple pie. Because of the holiday, what we have left is what’s in the display for today.”
“And everyone knows,” continued Kipling, “how infatuated the poor guy is with her. For months now, the look on his face every time she shows up, it’s almost sad. But hey, it looks like luck finally turned in his favor, considering how pretty cozy they seemed to be together when I left. And that was a couple of hours ago. When the place was still busy.”
“I wanted to return this to you,” he said, handing him the keys. “I brought back the car, so you don’t have to worry about it.”
“I—I’m just not sure how to ask this without sounding incredibly impolite. And that is…not what I want to do.”
“I’m fine.” He waved at them in protest. “I just need a second to catch my breath. That and just process whatever the hell I just saw.”
“Oh, you mean like this?” said Castiel, pointing at his tag behind his ear. “Look, it was just to get us in. We got in. Now we need to follow through with part two: get what we came for and get out. None of this will—um, matter once we leave.”
Dean repositioned himself slightly, by sticking out his ass more after shifting on his feet, hoping it would facilitate Castiel.
“Of course,” he said, stepping closer. “You were supposed to be here in a week from now anyway should your schedule have allowed it.”
They took a short intermission around episode seven, when they had taken a small stroll outside to get some fresh air. But came back inside eager to continue.
Still suspicious of him, however, Dean wondered if the short duration of his visits was simply to avoid Dean’s questions.
“S’okay. Unless you’re a pilot, not very many people know about it. Especially not people who aren’t from around here.” Still staring at him, Dean helped himself to another sip from his flask. As he twisted the cap back on, he said, “Anyway, it’s certainly unfortunate that’s not your stop.”
“This is going to sound weird,” said Dean, “but, um, is it okay if you sit down with us for a moment?”
She lifted an eyebrow. And a cunning smile appeared on her face. “Oh. You haven’t yet? Did he say no?” She stepped forward, scanning him head to feet. “Probably for the best Dean-o. Clarence is not like the rest of us.”
He took a good long look at Castiel and Dean. Smiling, he said, “Not at this moment, no. But I’ll know where to start if something comes to mind. Gentlemen,” he said, before heading out of the first door.
Unfortunately, he had been immediately stopped by his mother who had been surprised to see her son attempting to simply leave right in the middle of a large crowd and without informing her.
Jack thought for a moment. “Because you didn’t ask my permission first? Like when Maggie used to stay over or when I used to stay over at her house, I had to ask you first?”
“Makes sense, Granddad taught me.” They both burst laughing. “Not that I would dare insult you, but you aren’t exactly a professional dancer, either.”
No matter what, he had to admit that the view of the lake and forest, made possible because of the glass walls, regardless of the time of day, was nothing short of breathtaking.
“Of course not,” he said, laughing. “It’s only eight. Come on.” And he began heading towards the front stage where Garth and Bess were.
While Castiel had had no doubt that a night with Dean, which he had imagined for nearly a decade, would have been deeply satisfying and memorable, he had not expected the level of intimacy Dean was offering him, however.
Rowena stepped nervously into the room, holding a gold and green talisman, as she chanted an incantation.
“A place that we really should avoid now,” answered Dean. “Which is why those teleporters are pointless for us. They will only bring us to Cr—somewhere we can’t go.”
“Okay, wow. You—you almost got me there for a sec.” Dean took a big bite of his taco. “Anyway,” he said, returning to his story, “um, I—I don’t remember where I was in the—but when the doc showed up and all that, we finally got to leave and we—SHIT! MY CAR!” In his agitation, Dean tried to jump to his feet, but froze, half-hoisted up, when his brisk movement caused him pain. Clenching his jaw, he gripped the edge of the table to keep himself stable.
Sam’s focus had been terrible, to say the least. And while his work had not suffered during the week, despite the fact that Gabriel had been on his mind, and therefore a major distraction, Sam had failed at keeping his attention on his job.
Sam opened his mouth and looked back and forth between Castiel and Dean. “I—I’m not saying—I don’t mean—” he said, shifting in his seat. “I didn’t mean it like you don’t have a shot or something.” He cleared his throat. “I just thought you had moved on from her.”
Feeling ill, he wrapped his arms around his chest and began taking in deep breaths in the hope it would suppress the sobs he could feel building up within him.
“I always cared, Cas. And based on what Henry did, I think he cared a whole lot too. And so does Dean.” And Castiel shut his eyes, holding down a lump in his throat. “I was so happy when I heard you were at the Winchester ranch.”
There were a couple of wooden chairs on the left. A reception desk facing the door. A small television hung high on the wall and, given its blue screen, it suggested that it wasn’t working properly. And beside a public bathroom, that was pretty much it.
“And don’t sleep for the next few hours at the very least. Then you can take a nap if you want,” she said, then turned to Castiel, “but you have to check up on him.”
Gaping at him, Castiel licked his own lips, and traced Dean’s jawline with his thumb. Dean swallowed hard and opened his eyes. And following Castiel’s lead, he let go of Castiel’s hand and grazed the side of his face with his fingertips.
The dining area was modest and, most importantly to Dean, nearly empty. That way, at least, they had a fair chance to carry a decent conversation, even if it would be in front of Becky and Chuck.
“What the fuck,” he let out. “Why—why didn’t I know this? Like before. Hell, even since Purgatory or whatever.”
But here he was. Almost at the finish line. One more little delay was nothing to worry himself with. After all, not even an hour ago, his situation had seemed hopeless. Due to some incident with another airline, the Garrison Airline was now the only option for many travelers, including Castiel, and with nearly every flight already overbooked, and this,
, Dean moved on to another question. “And how did you two became friends? Like when did you two meet? It wasn’t that long ago, right?”
Clear second attempt that night. If Castiel hadn’t been sure about Dean’s insinuation before, there was no denying it now. And just as panic was settling in Castiel’s chest, Dean added urgently, “Just, you know, once in a while. For—would you consider it?”
“You have another option.” Sam faced Gabriel with his knees touching his thighs as he turned. “You can stay at my house, if you want.”
And Sam asked many questions about how Gabriel got to own a bakery, and listened with fascination about his travels in Europe where he had learned most of his skills.
The next few days were pleasant, but difficult for Castiel. He tried to keep himself occupied with as much as he could in the hope to avoid being hit with homesickness. For the most part, it worked.
At the saddening sight of Sam, Castiel debated if he should share with him that he had opened up to Gabriel about Dean.
“Oh no, there was. But it was embarrassing. There are nearly no angels left. The plan of seizing control of heaven seems rather pointless when its value is practically nonexistent. It will most likely fall very soon.”
“Sorry mate, but seeing the state you’re in, no can do. Now, come on,” he slapped his leg as he stood up from the couch. “I’m hitting pause on your…whatever this is. Go take a quick shower, put on some clean clothes and we’ll go get you some food. My treat.”
They looked at each other for a serious moment, and as Castiel was slowly leaning in for another kiss, he stopped suddenly when rose petals were falling on his head.
His heart stopped, however, once he realized that the hammock, as well as the rest of the patio furniture, were also gone. Panicking, he took another look at the house and nearly let out a gasp when it appeared like the place was inhabited.
“Castiel, say goodbye.” And his brother presented him his hand, signalling to him that he had to leave immediately.
“Still. Just—just talk to friends. Check up on the info I gave you. Sleep on it. And I’m here if you have questions.”
Sam was eyeing his brother with a growing smirk on his face. Dean was gazing at Castiel, as anxiety was spreading in his chest. And Castiel, bouncing his eyes back and forth between Sam and Dean, wondered by every second that passed why neither of them had moved.
But now, in this context, remembering what Mrs. Butters had told him about his intentions, he found the task rather pressuring.
He wasn’t about to share that detail with Castiel though and contented himself with the fact that for once, he felt enthusiastic about his weekend plans.
Castiel, blade in hand, then proceeded in taking off his jacket in a calmly manner, unperturbed by Gordon’s threats.
“Well, this is weird as hell,” whispered Sam as Dean was walking away with Lisa. “He’s so clueless. I feel like I have to apologize for him.”
“So Granddad was very generous and he left Sam and me a considerable amount of money, and his shares in most of his enterprises. With just that alone, we have nothing to complain about. He did the same with many other people he worked with over the years, which I’m not surprised one second about because that’s who he was.” He took a pause and rubbed his neck. “He also left me the deed for his house and everything in it, as well as many other residences on the land and the land itself as well.”
The strawberry blond stepped away from him, while her friend was staring at him, resting her free hand over her chest as though he had said something immensely offensive.
He had left in a less hurried manner once or twice before, but he still had left the room long before Dean was done with his shower.
There was a pause, during which Castiel took in the weight of Dean’s promise, until he said softly, “Dean?”
Castiel gave him a moment to continue, but Dean shifted in his seat, eyes still on his bowl of chili. “It’s just what?”
“He said he’s okay,” said Gabriel, looking at his text message again. “Somewhere safe and not outside anymore.”
Dean pursed his lips. “I know. I just—we’re halfway through the six months now,” which Castiel had difficulty believing in that moment, “and I know you still talk to your friends and everything, but maybe seeing them would help too. I—I know the weather has been harsh lately. You don’t go outside as much as you used to before Christmas. I don’t know. I thought it would cheer you up.”
As it was usually the case on Sunday mornings, Castiel was woken up by some clatter caused by Dean in the kitchen.
And they remained still for a little while, deeply wishing to not ruin the moment as they grew highly aware of their surroundings and what could follow.
Castiel nodded, pleased as well. Rose petals were one thing, but bathing out in the open was another.
Dean let out a sigh. “I get for Lucifer—and Gadreel, even—given…you know, but Michael and Anna? They don’t check on you?”
Dean let out a laugh. “Um, I don’t think it’s about how much of a gentleman I am or not. This,” he said, waving his hands at the armchairs, “has to do with bravery at this point. If you’re brave enough to attempt this, it’s all yours. I’m certainly not brave enough and I wouldn’t recommend it.”
They also took short breaks for stretching and going to the bathroom. When they realized that they still had the second half of the movie to go through, Sam decided to make popcorn, which they consumed with a few of Gabriel’s treats. They also indulged with refills of the delicious mulled wine.
“I’ve met him before. Bela sometimes invites me to her office parties. Or just whenever she goes out.”
And Castiel was staring back with a concerned look on his face. Not annoyed or even uncomfortable, but
Soon enough, resting his forehead against Castiel’s, to catch their breaths, and unable to contain their grins, Dean said, “I got you a present too.”
“Hello,” said the clerk, without lifting his eyes from his old paperback book. “What can I do for you?”
“Right, sorry,” said Sam. “Cas, this is Jess, she’s in my year. Her parents own the shop. That’s how I know of it. And Jess, this is Cas, he’s a friend of the family and a book lover, too.”
Aware of the probability that this was an ambush, Dean reasoned that having Castiel by his side was undoubtedly a smart move.
Dean slid himself on his side to see where Castiel had gone, only to watch him return quickly from the bathroom. He handed Dean a wet cloth to clean himself with, and threw it in a basket bin not far from the bed once Dean was done.
Rushing to the house in the bitter cold, he felt anxiety spread through his chest. They had only spoken briefly over the phone since he had last seen her, and he had to admit that he had missed her tremendously.
“Because everything sounded good to me! I’m not that tech savvy and Dad isn’t, either. So, if I was okay with it, I figured Dad would be too.”
The doctor repeated warnings and symptoms to look out for that Tasha had warned them about, and told them to immediately come back if that should occur.
There was also the worry that they might have been watched after the few snags they had hit in the past.
So, after a quick glance around them, detecting no potential customers—or eavesdroppers—Dean, took a deep breath and started to speak.
“Never needed one,” he said defensively. “I mean, this is nuts. This has never happened before. This is a peaceful place. Nothing like that ever happens. The most hostile stuff that ever occurred here are stern looks and passive-aggressive bullshit conversations. That’s it.”
He had no idea what he could tell him. The situation hadn’t changed, and the more he was thinking about it, the more furious he was becoming at Dean for not having said anything.
Castiel snorted. “Trust me, yours is better. And your situation was different. My family was chaotic from the get go.”
gave him an hour to change, quickly clean-up and head to wait wherever Pamela’s events occurred on Saturdays.
Castiel was worried. He didn’t like unexpected guests. No one had ever asked for him by name. Nearly all his friends worked at the hotel, therefore leaving no surprises there, and the few others he had outside of work had no reason to show up unannounced.
Dean turned down the hallway to reach his locker in a hurry. He walked into at least three people on his way there.
“Before I go the bed,” said Castiel, finishing his sentence. Smiling at the corner of his mouth, he then told him, “I do add something to my bath. Though I don’t remember someone ever asking me about it.”
But he had kept at it and had been amazed how he still succeeded to find the time, even if it seemed impossible to do so.
A few other people shared a few words, much like Sam had done, and soon the crowd started to break ranks. Food and beverages were then brought in and mini-groups started to form, discussing among themselves.
However, as Castiel slowly made his way towards the kitchen, it became clear rather quickly that this was not the case on that specific Sunday morning.
“WHAT?” Dean’s jaw dropped and he turned to Castiel, freaking out. As per freaking usual. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
They both stared at her, furious at her deceit and even more furious at themselves for having missed that little detail.
“That he’s still out there. Fighting. But I don’t know where. I don’t know what happened to him. But—” and she stopped abruptly, pursing her lips.
Sam moved the basket of laundry, which had been resting on Dean’s bed, to give him room to sit and dropped on his own bed afterwards.
“I just need to finish with—but it shouldn’t take long. I’ll be able to leave shortly if you don’t mind waiting a little.”
“See,” said Dean. “It’s a silly gift. But since you’ll be living here, I thought it would be handy.”
“Chill, little bro. Nothing funky for you—for either of you, for that matter,” he added, looking at Sam. “As per my promise to the charming Mrs. Winchester. So cheers!”
“Jess,” Gabriel leaned back on his seat, “not only are we going to be there, we are also helping making it happen.”
“The problem is that,” continued Sam, “while I really like Gabriel, and I really do, I—um, the feelings I have for Bela haven’t just…disappeared. There is a clear difference though. Saying that it wasn’t like it was before seems a stupid way to explain it, but it’s true.”
Not wanting to risk waking John, he slowly shut his door as much as he could, but not completely, making sure to not make it squeal.
Swearing under his breath, but determined to stick to his plan and prove Dean wrong, he then dropped all his blankets on one of the armchairs.
And he was. But literally nobody in the whole freaking universe and multi-verses could have predicted what that little shit pulled.
Dean gasped when he felt Castiel’s erection against his ass. He twisted his body, so he could look at Castiel. His ass still on Castiel’s crotch, he rested his right arm on the edge of the tub, and stuck out his right leg to not feel too cramped, causing more water to drip on the floor.
Following Jessica’s advice, Castiel brought up the topic of their holiday on the very next night after the Halloween party with a firm intention to finally settle on a destination and date.
But in a way, it made the times that they were able to share together, even if for only a few hours, all the more precious.
Finally, Castiel turned his eyes on him. His only reply was a firm nod. Dean, not wanting to stay there one more second, drove off.
And after an awkward goodbye, yet warm enough, Castiel took his seat, Mick shut the door behind him, and Castiel headed back home.
“Look at it this way,” said Crowley, “even if you had stayed, it seems that drama was inevitable and you would have suffered the same—well, a similar—fate.”
for God’s sake. Like it was some dumbass excuse I came up with once I heard it was a family gathering.”
Writing that one short note had been a struggle for Castiel. He rewrote it many times. He constantly changed the order of topics. He doubted every word.
Thus, Castiel put the book aside, and gently woke Dean by shaking his shoulder. A tad confused at first, Dean repositioned himself in the armchair, looking around him, as if he was looking for clues explaining what had happened.
“You deserved that,” he said, laughing. “But seriously. I promise. I will be the model civilian that I secretly am. The one I am so well, in fact, that you don’t even know anything about it.”
I found your shirt from the other day in my laundry. As a thank you for saving me from my own mess, I made an apple pie and your name is written on it. So, if you don’t have any plans tonight, please, stop by my place, I’ll properly return your shirt to you and we could perhaps have dessert as well.
There was a long minute of silence, during which both men drank they coffee, until Samuel said, "I heard what happened last week with the Walshes."
“Mr. Winchester! Hello. How are you feeling now? Oh, who do we have here?” she asked once she noticed Castiel’s presence. “Are you the brother?”
But Augure and Orationis are pretty far from each other. Too far for teleportation. Plus, there’s some bullshit smack in the middle of that route that most people would prefer to avoid.
Remaining in the same position, Dean turned his head to him, and after a short hesitation, he nodded.
. I was hiding out. Someone caught me. I was put to sleep, without my consent, and then pouf, I woke up next to you. I don’t even know what year we’re in.” Castiel laughed. “Look Dean, it’s very simple to me. If they wanted to fuck with me and destroy my life, they’re a bit late for that. The only thing left for them to do would have been to kill me, and they could have easily done that by slicing my throat when I was under. Or even better, just tampered with my cryo pod and that would have been it. Nobody would have questioned it.”
Dean, even though he hadn’t been looking at his brother, lowered his eyes as though he had been caught in the middle of a lie.
“Diner,” corrected Gabriel. “Yeah. I was surprised they both agreed. I mean, they’d already been there that day. That was part of the reason I had been craving pancakes in the first place.”
“This is going to happen, Dean. We'll deal with the car, and then we'll go to Lisa’s, where you will apologize and clear the air, because we both know that’s the right thing to do.”
As he was slowing down his pace to consider all the options, Castiel, on the other hand, was advancing at a steady beat, seemingly knowing where he was going.
“I know. That’s the one thing I feel bad about, too,” said Sam. “I don’t hate her, but she’s not Cas. And Dean knows that and he needs to own up to it, already.”
“I don’t think I have the whole scoop, but I know enough. More than him, I think,” he said, glancing at Dean, amused.
“I have no idea. But—” Castiel crushed the letter in his hand. Panic suddenly spreading through his chest, he jumped to his feet and dropped the squashed letter on the kitchen counter, as he headed towards the entrance where Dean was still standing.
With time fleeting away, his insecurities at play, and his failure to bring himself to utter a few simple words, Dean’s hesitation was only growing.
“No, he doesn’t. Officially. I think he might suspect. He’s made comments before, but I honestly never know if it’s just him
After a brief introduction, during which Castiel tried his best to remember everybody’s names, people went back to their usual occupations, and Castiel was left with Dean and Donna to begin the tour of the ranch.
Once Jessica had gone, Castiel turned to Sam, lifting an eyebrow. Sam gestured him to follow him to the front window of the shop, ensuring them additional privacy even though Jessica had already left.
“Well, with everyone blabbing, none of it by me, she knows now.” She handed him the piece of paper. “This is from her. Basically, because you chose to omit a lot of details, and because of the—um, rumors—unless you show up in New York, like, now and prove that all of it is bullshit, you’re pretty much fired.”
“It’s way funnier that way. Anyway, like I said, it doesn’t really count. Ish. Depends where you’re from.”
“Why aren’t answering any of your calls?” said Sam, cutting him off. “I’ve been trying to get hold of you since Sunday and nothing. Not even a text back.”
But it seemed that Elliot Ness didn’t resent him for that fact and gladly let Castiel pet his forehead, nonetheless.
,” he said, sighing, “because he couldn’t deal, because he couldn’t do anything on his own, came to Stanford and screwed it all up for me.”
