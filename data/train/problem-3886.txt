They stood there for a second, swaying in an almost dance-like way, just enjoying the other’s presence before Persephone felt a sharp pain in his back. He looked behind him to find a demon, arm still outstretched from throwing the angel blade embedded in Persephone’s back, before the god collapsed onto Hades and everything went black.
Gabe stepped forward, a mockingly serious face plastered upon his features. “Dean, we’re worried about you.”
The Winchester relaxed minutely. “You’re...the Spirit? Then why do you look like me?”
“God,” the Angel scoffed, banging his head on the wall behind him. “Will anyone ever tire of asking me that fucking question?”
“Well, Samsquatch, we are gathering the ingredients for a spell that should at least bring Cassie and Deano out of their funk.”
After getting Sam to bed, leaving him with the lie that Dean had been with friends the entire night, Dean remembered that he had left Sam’s crutch outside. Rubbing a hand over his face, he walked outside, searching for the apparatus in the moonlight.
One of the main guys who were huddled around a car full of “the goods” turned incredulously and raised his gun at the same time as about thirty other firearms were pointed at him. “What do you want?”
The younger man rolled his eyes and grabbed a Honey Bun off the counter. The other one sighed, set aside the records he was looking at, and leaned back into the couch.
over. He made Dean feel nothing about this whole situation, even going so far as sucking out the man’s will, his drive, to make Dean no longer fight, before sending him off into the abyss of his psyche. Because
“You have a
“No, no. You aren’t you...I’m not having this conversation. I need to leave. I’m leaving.”
“Sam, we’ll just have to let it play out.”
Gabriel was in the middle of shaking his head when Anna walked in. “Who?” she asked, putting on her apron.
, Castiel?”
He was turning to leave when Michael piped back up again.
“Get the fuck away from me, asshole. Cas and Sam are gonna save me and then you’re gonna be just a fucking smear on the sidewalk. Gone. Kaput.” Dean’s confident expression disappeared when the thing started freaking
Castiel grabbed his head, the darkness around and within him growing every second. He was slipping into a mindset that was not familiar to him. Though he was the angel of tears and solitude, he felt every negative or base feeling grow. Everything was becoming so much smaller, yet so much larger. He couldn’t handle it as this darkness overpowered every bit of his being, dominating what used to be the angel Castiel and turning him into something...more.
Castiel nodded, but just that action caused him to sway. Sam lurched forward and caught the man, forcing himself to ignore the spike of pain that emanated from his leg. Sam rotated and half shoved, half dropped the hurt man onto the couch, wincing in sympathy at the groan that escaped the man. “...Sorry.”
The younger Winchester was taken aback by Castiel’s authoritative tone and went to protest, only to be silenced by the deadly gleam in the man’s icy blue eyes. Sam eventually looked away, and Castiel, satisfied that the young Winchester was properly chastised, turned away and picked up Dean bridal style, much like he had back at the lot, eliciting a very surprised oof out of Dean.
He chuckled. “Whoa, whoa, easy, I’m not here to hurt you...no wait, actually, I am. Unless you answer my questions. That’s all I want.”
“Sam,” Dean said, worry coating the very word. “What were you doing out there? Are you out of your mind?”
The two sat in silence for a little bit, the tension in the air still decently thick. Dean eventually squirmed and decided to cut it.
“Watch the shop for a little bit. Your cousin and I got some stuff to do.” Gabriel opened his mouth to protest but, to Castiel’s surprise, quickly closed it, seeing something in Dean’s face. The blond smirked and grabbed Castiel’s hand a little too forcefully.
“Dean’s
The older boy’s eyes fluttered before he stubbornly squared his shoulders, trying and failing to hold back the inevitable wince that accompanied the motion. “No, no. I just need some food in me. Any chance you have supplies for a PB&J?”
Sam stifled a laugh while the other man looked at her, head tilted, confused. “I don’t understand that reference.”
“What? Why are you laughing?” Dean asked. Sam threw his gaze at his brother, making Dean flinch back at the mix of frustration and bemusement in those hazel eyes.
Dean was sitting on a sidewalk in front of A Taste of Heaven, a local diner a block away from Bobby’s. He had his head in his hands.
“Cassie, I’m sorry for lying to you, okay, but I did so for the sake of your love life.”
“I don’t know.”
Also, I realized while writing this that when I started writing this story I was younger than Sammy boy. Wowza.
Dean had this devastating pit in the bottom of his stomach which drowned out the current pain coursing through his body. He’s lost him again. Cas was possessed, or was changed, or whatever the hell could cause something like what just happened. Dean couldn’t do this; he couldn’t lose Cas again.
Sam, previously holding things down, was immediately distracted by the sight that greeted him once he turned. Dean’s eyes were open, but, instead of revealing his brother’s normal forest colored eyes, Dean’s irises were bright green, an unnatural color that could only have been found in the deepest of rain forests.
Castiel Novak jumped from his place at the counter by the window of his Aunt Anna’s cafe, A Taste of Heaven. He was a waiter there, but, every once in a while, he would get distracted by the passersby outside the cafe’s two large windows in the front. And that was why he had zoned out now.
“Shit!” he yelled, trying to scramble away but somehow frozen in his position, knife remaining in his hand.
Tuesday: SAT
Wednesday: ACT WorkKeys
His vision cleared and he found himself in a room filled with dead bodies. Blood spatter covered the walls and the floor was littered with bodies, burned, bloodied, and broken. Dean was stunned by deja vu and his eyes watered, his skin feeling hot and prickly, like there were needles trying to get out. That squishing sound kept bugging him, getting louder and louder, the repetitive sound making his eardrums rattle. What is that?
“I have
“What was he chanting?”
Castiel shook his head. “No, not Dean. Not anymore. The thing inside him.”
Castiel and Dean looked at each other, Dean raising his eyebrows as Cas tilted his head. The elder Winchester turned his attention to the other people in the room.
at the docks? And
He was a killer, that was all he was. And he was finally free.
Sam ducked his head and rubbed at his eyes, not really feeling like answering but deciding to anyway.
“Dean!”
sexy Angel was cleaning. Those beautiful blue eyes widened and the Angel dropped the rag he was holding in shock, no doubt.
Dean scoffed. “Great. So basically we’re riding around in a sociopathic killing machine?”
Dean looked up from his empty glass of water. “When we were getting beaten up by those demons, I prayed for Cas.”
Persephone made a sound of sympathy. “Well I am sure you will do a wonderful job.”
“I don’t know,” the Spirit said. “This has never happened before. All my previous vessels were never stubborn enough to go against their own well-being just because of some misguided duty to a younger brother as well as a crippling fear of change.”
Dean Winchester. Now that Castiel could put a name to that face, he understood why he hadn’t recognized the other man at all. The last time he had ever seen Dean was the last day of third grade, when Michael had decided to homeschool his cousin. Dean was a mystery, even back then. Dean had been often quiet, not really making an impact on anyone. He was sweet though, that Castiel could recall. Castiel remembered that once he had been having a hard time solving a math problem in class and Dean had come over and wordlessly pointed out how to do it correctly. The dark haired man remembered the shy smile after Castiel had thanked him.
- Destiel angst, anyone?
“It used to be gold and teal.”
Destiel in the next chapter. (Woot woooooot.... Cas is gonna need all the hugs 😈)
Castiel cleared his throat and leaned onto the counter. “Do you want anything to eat?”
Sam shook his head in exasperation at his older brother’s antics, only to have it lost in the fray of his fretting sibling.
Meanwhile, Sam sat downstairs with a worried expression on his face. What could be wrong with his brother? Then, at that moment, he came to one conclusion: the only way he would know what was wrong with Dean was if he found out himself. And, even if it ended with one or both of them being embarrassed, Sam resolved himself to following his brother the next night.
The silence that ensued was excruciating.
"You must. This is a matter of war. The Demons have declared it, and, with their prison break last night, time is of the essence."
“Kind?”
Everyone sat in silence for a while, silently mourning for Dean. All of a sudden, a voice piped up.
Four hours later Dean had avoided Bobby’s curious looks, stocked all the shelves, cleaned the store, checked out a new car that had come in, and did all of that while ignoring the asshole in his head.
The blonde rolled his eyes. Castiel, after intently watching Dean for a minute, asked, “So what does he - is he a he, I don’t know - feed on?”
“Sammy! What the fuck are you doing out here? It’s freezing!”
Although, this time, she had to hand it to Dean. He managed to upset his brother so much that little Sammy played right into her hands.
wall down?"
He searched the room again before finding the source at his hand. More specifically, his hand which was repeatedly stabbing into a long dead and charred body, blood making his fingers stick to the blade.
Dean froze midstep.
She was one of the most easily manipulated people the world had ever seen.
“Oh, that sucks. You can’t cancel them?”
Ruby could never stand it.
Warning: a little self-cest, but I feel like it doesn't really count as self-cest, but crap gets weirddddd and I did not intend to write it going into this chapter.
Sam gulped. “....Persephone?”
His brother shot up as quickly as he could with a broken leg and stared at Dean, while Cas stared at him with worried and lost eyes, which was an expression Dean had never seen on Castiel before. He decided he didn’t like it.
They basked in the silence of the motel room hallway, happy that they finally got their respective brothers to admit their feelings for one another. Sam was the first one to speak.
Dean gulped and ran a hand down his face.
In which Dean (or is it really Dean?) is a pervy creep, Ruby's just a plain old creep who thinks she's soooooo smooth, and everyone else is extremely worried.
The moment that some but probably not many have been waiting for:
“Shut up!” Dean was squirming, eyes watering.
"No."
Fic is not abandoned, writer is just lazy and forgetful. ❤️ I appreciate you for reading.
Ruby’s mother smirked, a plan forming in her mind.
"Prison break? What do you mean?"
He heard Michael suck in a breath and slowly let it out. Castiel tensed, preparing for the worst.
“I have to work second shift tonight at Taste of Heaven. Come over there around nine?”
“Yes, you dumbass. Who else would drag your ugly mug off the sidewalk?” he replied, trying to mask his concern for his brother. How long had Sam been out there? How long could he have been out there if Dean had decided to come back later than he actually had?
Gabriel nodded. “Yes.”
Sorry for any typos, I am too tired to edit rn lol. Probably look back later.
Persephone stood, moving with an almost feline grace that truly marked the difference between his brother and the god. The god moved toward Sam, features soft, and stopped right in front of him, holding Dean’s palm up to gently cradle Sam’s cheek. “
“Oh, you know…” Dean said. “The whole ‘we’ll be down in the morning’ thing.”
Dean grinned before pulling out a knife that he had acquired from a previous excursion.
“Well we have to fix him!” Sam yelled. “We can’t just...do nothing!”
Sam looked over at his brother to see Dean frozen with a look of gut-wrenching anguish gracing his features. As confused and worried as he was, Sam knew that he would have to take charge of the situation, because his brother was obviously unable to even sort of function at the moment. So Sam did what he’d been doing all his life.
“No, I...,” Cas paused before continuing. “I like it. It’s the first nickname anyone’s ever given me that I never actively despised.”
Hades smiled wide. It was time.
So,” Charlie had said once they had gotten settled in on her couch. “Start from the beginning.”
As his entire being faded into black abyss, the last things he heard were the Spirit screaming and Chanel Dean No.3 cackling.
She smirked. “Soon, I will have Sam Winchester eating out of my hand.”
Oh my God, I literally suck.
“I have CONDITIONS!”
“...Hello?” Castiel winced at the grating sound of his voice.
Un-betaed, all mistakes are mine.
“Sam, when have you ever known me to not?” she replied, plopping down on the couch, phone out, previous rageful demeanor apparently forgotten. Castiel turned his attention to Sam with a slightly shocked expression.
“You assbutt,” Castiel said lowly, his eyes loving and warm. “I love you.”
SAM AND CAS ARE TEAMING UP! And sorry Cas got beat up and I left Chapter 12 on such a cliff hanger, but hey, I gave the man a pb&j. He deserves one.
“And then today we were on a hunt and some demons got the upper hand. Then Cas shows up out of nowhere-”
Castiel shook his head. "Michael, n-no. I-I can't go back there. You know what happened last time, I can't go through that again. And anyway, I'm busy."
Oh yeah, and I have absolutely NO updating schedule. 👍 Kudos are love 💕
“Dude, that is literally, word for word, the same thing I have told you for years now. Don’t worry about me, worry more about yourself.”
Murdery weird possessed boy vs three dudes who try their best, which isn't that great!
“Eh, a little eye of newt, a little toad, you know, that sort of thing.” Sam continued to question him, but Gabriel remained elusive. Eventually the archangel found a shelf and yelled “Eureka!”, grabbing a box that looked thousands of years old before flying them to the next place. Sadly, though, their relocation did not stop Sam’s stream of questions, so, after flying five more places, Gabriel finally flew them back to the bunker. He laid all the various boxes and containers out on the War Room table and then turned to Sam with a hand up, effectively silencing all questions.
(...sorry.)
Sam looked down at his hands and nodded. “I understand.”
Dean jumped at the sudden intrusion on his search. He had almost completely forgotten that it was there, as it had been silent since the...incident at the docks.
I also promise to have out the new chapter soon. My grandma sleeps a lot and I have time to work on my projects sooo...this next chapter is already in the works. Honestly, 16 and 17 were originally one big chapter but I broke it up. Very very long.
An extremely sarcastic brow arched. “What did you think he was?” The younger Winchester sat back for a second, thinking. The night before everything went wrong, the night Sam had seen Dean kill all those people, Sam had just assumed that Dean was...well, there was no other word for it than “changed”. When his brother had told him that he was a fiery monster dude, Sam really couldn’t find it in himself to get past that. He swallowed and went back to tending Castiel’s wounds. “...I don’t know.” he said quietly.
“And what exactly do we have to do?”
The cafe was pretty empty, save for a few teenagers who were trying to stay out as late as they could before their parents got worried. A short teenager with wavy dark blond hair, who Dean estimated to be maybe a year or two older than Sam, looked up from washing the dishes and grinned. He winked at Dean before yelling (making all the patrons jump in surprise), “Cassie! Your boyfriend’s here!”
As Castiel was wolfing down his second slice of pizza and Sam was in the bathroom deciding to do something about the greaseball he called a head, a brief knock was heard at the front door before it swung open.
The long haired man tilted his head, curiosity and surprise at the once-in-a-lifetime possibility of Dean opening up to him making his eyes widen before he pulled himself back together again. “Try me.”
“Okay.”
Dean came back to himself. He felt hands on his shoulders and saw Bobby only a few inches from his face, wearing an expression that was a mix between horrified and worried. Panicked, Dean breathed through his nose and out his mouth, closing his eyes to do so. After he was calmed down enough, he ran out of Bobby’s grip and left the store with the voice chanting over and over:
“Dean, you don’t need to mother hen me. I’m fine. My pride’s hurt more than anything.”
“Dean, we’re going to find something eventually. Someone must know something about the attempt on your lives."
Sam groaned. “Gabriel, where the hell are we going?”
Ruby ended the call and set her phone down on the counter as her mother stared at her expectantly. “I’m meeting Sam Winchester in an hour,” she said. “He sounded super upset and, I quote, ‘needs to be with someone right now’. How pathetic is that?”
But now that the pesky human was out of the way, he could finally get down to having some fun. Being cooped up all these months was so
It fully faced him. “Oh, trust me, I am.”
Cas quirked an eyebrow. “Hunger?”
The teenager looked Bobby dead in the eye. “We have to save Dean.”
The creature was suddenly in his space again, hand a vice on his forearm. “No, you’re not.”
Cole Trenton sat at his desk sipping coffee. He hated the night shift; it was boring and monotonous, and most nights he struggled to stay awake. Staring at monitors was not the most riveting job, but, for fourteen dollars an hour, he could deal with it. He watched as Gordon Walker, his only other cohort on the night shift, made his rounds. Cole liked Gordon. He did his job well and efficiently, not showing any emotion except pure steel rage, which was useful when dealing with the lower-than-dirt assholes who were caged in this godforsaken penitentiary. The man took another drink of his coffee, closing his eyes and savoring the feeling of the caffeine hitting his system. He felt the need to at least obtain a little joy from
Castiel and Dean startled out of their reverie and responded to Gabriel’s apology at the same time.
His surrogate father glanced up from his work and looked back down. “Castiel.”
Five minutes later, Charlie surged up in bed, eyes filled with tears and face contorted with a mixture of grief and horror.
At that, the girl threw her arms around him; he caught her, shocked. “Oh you sweet sweet little thing, I’m gonna have so much fun with you.”
He hobbled over to the kitchen and pulled one of the many bottles of whiskey out of the pantry before going to the bathroom and grabbing some bandages. Returning to Castiel, he lowered himself and his goods down and steadied himself. “Shirt?”
“I’m a friend, Dean. And I’m here to help you.”
Gabriel and Sam met each other’s gazes and rolled their eyes simultaneously before turning their attention back to their respective brothers.
With that, Dean quickly fell asleep, exhausted from the long day and internal turmoil. Castiel, arm still around the other man, brushed away some soot that had remained on Dean’s forehead and, after a little hesitation, brushed his lips where the soot had been. His arm tightened around Dean as Castiel began to drift off.
“Yeah, a long time ago. We were kids.”
Sorry to end on a cliffhanger....brings a little suspense to the New Year
His brain caught up and he let out a whimper. These people, all these people, dead because of- because of… Oh god.
, it said, irritated.
Sam stood up and looked at his elder brother, his hands folded and face caring but firm.
"Michael-"
The older boy sighed. “Alright, Sam. And keep me updated as to your brother’s condition, please.”
Dean quirked an eyebrow. “Yes?”
“I was worried.”
Dean had raced home to find his little brother sitting on the sidewalk a few meters away from their house, breath quicker than it should’ve been, with his crutch a few feet away from him and his head in his hands. As soon as Dean's voice rang through the air, Sam's head shot straight up. Once catching sight of Dean, he struggled to stand, only to immediately collapse back down onto the sidewalk. Dean ran toward his brother, arms catching Sam before Sam could make impact on the sidewalk.
Oh this was going to be fun.
Sam awoke to the sound of banging on the door. He grabbed his crutches and made his way to it, before opening it to find Castiel, barely conscious, holding himself up against the door-frame, covered in blood.
“Yes, Michael.”
The Winchester in question raised his head slowly, focusing sad eyes on the angel less than a foot away from him. “Cas, the person I love will never love me back. And if I can’t have you, then what’s the point?!”
Castiel grabbed a cloth and started nervously cleaning the counter. “We just made some pie.”
my brother, and I’m going to fix this.”
So Castiel decided to watch him. In a totally non stalkery way.
Dean stared for a few more seconds before nervously nodding and moving over. “O-okay.”
Dean smiled, but that smile quickly dropped off his face when Cas asked him a question. “So, Dean, what - not to put this too crudely - are you?”
You thought there was more? There's not.
“Your..aura. It’s different.”
He felt the Spirit sigh, resigned, before it retreated back to...wherever it went when it wasn’t talking to him. Dean sighed and put his head in his hands. Suddenly, he heard one of the voices raise, panic and anger making the words shoot through the air like a bullet.
I feel like this chapter is really long but that just might be me.
Upon reaching the door, Sam slowly opened the sliding window and gasped at what he saw. “Dean!”
Dean snorted. “Look, I think you’re just worrying yourself over Sam. We’re all good here.”
“Did what you just said ring any bells for you?”
“What do you mean?” Dean asked, irritated that Gabriel wouldn’t just come out with it. Gabe held up a hand to keep Dean from continuing and then continued.
“Well, you have. And you haven’t. Not really. It’s just been li’l ol’ me behind the wheel, out for a joyride. But you don’t know what it feels like. To feed on that power, the power of a soul leaving this plane and transitioning to the next”
In a motel room, in a motel room miles above the Underworld, Persephone opened his eyes.
Sam fumbled his way out of the bathroom to find Charlie standing in the living room with her hands on her hips. Her glasses were askew, failing to hide the enormous bags under her normally lively eyes, and red hair sticking up all over the place. She looked awful. Sam hadn’t seen her like this since he accidentally walked into Dean’s room years ago to find Charlie crying in Dean’s arms as he rubbed her back.
Dean looked at Charlie with the most forlorn and lost expression she had ever seen on his features.
“Yeah, nine’s good.”
“Where are you looking? The freaking police database or somethin’?” Bobby asked. Charlie nodded in response, distracted. She clicked on something and gasped. “Holy shit,” she said softly, clapping a hand over her mouth. Castiel stood up as Sam moved closer.
“You say you’re good, but, really, you could be
____________
Castiel gestured to the kitchen and Dean stood up and followed the dark haired man through the kitchen door. Upon arriving in the kitchen, Castiel walked to an oven that had a cooling apple pie on top.
Castiel hurriedly walked through the park, weaving between the masses occupying the area. Gradually he made his way to the northwest corner. The farther he got, the amount of people tapered off until there were only a few people, scattered around, sneaking through the area. Castiel laughed at their fear under his breath and climbed into the trailer that everyone was not-so-subtly avoiding.
“About me? Sam, you have a broken leg. Worry more about you, not me!”
Dean gulped and then refocused to see the gangsters looking an equal mix of extremely irritated and extremely perturbed. He put his game face back as the leader became more hostile. It seemed that while Dean had been speaking to the Spirit, the other party in the deal had gotten the hell out of dodge. It didn’t matter that they did though. Dean was only after the Demons.
Castiel looked down, slightly embarrassed. “None of your concern.”
Relieved, Castiel made for the door, but was stopped by Sam’s voice, suddenly weak. “This is gang stuff, isn’t it.” It wasn’t a question.
Castiel tilted his head and squinted at Dean, shock having faded away and replaced with suspicion. There was a bone-chilling malice in the depths of Dean’s eyes, and the way that Dean held himself was just...not right.  “Something’s different.”
Castiel shook his head stubbornly. “Dean, you look utterly exhausted. You are going upstairs and straight to bed.” He turned his head and looked at Sam. “Sam, we will see you in the morning. Then, all of us will talk.”
(Also, 1.4K words in this chapter! Damnnn)
“Why would Dean kill people?! How could he?!”
The whole “murdering bad guys for the greater good” thing with Cas was going pretty well. Dean was feeling better than he had in a long time, since it seemed that the Spirit was much nicer (both to his body and his mind) when he was well fed. Speaking of feeding…
No reaction.
“Heya, Cas.”
Making his way to the panic room door, Sam began to feel as if something were wrong. It was too quiet; in the past hour or two, every time someone came down to check on Dean they were greeted with the Creature being an obnoxious asshole. The complete silence was unsettling. He began to advance with caution. “...Dean? You good in there?”
She knew hanging up on him was cruel, but, frankly, she didn’t care. She couldn’t stand to talk to her mark any longer. All his feelings were way too obnoxious and...emotional.
Dean turned his head, still holding the body, to see a figure in the shadows. He fought to get his voice before responding. “Why?”
“Dean?”
Gabe winked at his cousin and put a lollipop in his mouth that he seemingly had grabbed out of thin air. “Have fun Cassie.”
The armchair Bobby had been in hit the wall with the force at which the older man shot out of his chair. Castiel found himself with a face full of pissed off Bobby.
“You aren’t Dean Winchester.”
"Last night was disastrous, Castiel. Inias is dead. Uriel and Zachariah have disappeared. And they could have used some backup, but was there any present? No. Because you've been neglecting your duties."
The brunette cleared his throat. “You said he was chanting something. That day, in your business. What was he chanting?”
“Dean..” Gabriel murmured. “DIdn’t you know him Cassie?”
Castiel smiled minutely and nodded before turning and walking out. It was at that time that Bobby chose to walk into the front of the store. He stopped in shock.
“‘Yes, Michael’
Possible tw: Non-con, but literally nothing happens. More like just the threat of it. Nothing explicit.
alone,” Gabriel interrupted, him and Sam smirking, causing Dean to turn bright red. The eldest Winchester stammered, rendered borderline speechless as Cas marched toward him with a purpose, righteous fury illuminating the angel’s blue eyes. Gabriel materialized a bag of popcorn and offered some to Sam.
Bobby Singer smiled at the boy. Bobby, the owner of Singer’s Auto Shop, had known Dean and Sam for the majority of their lives and thought them to be like his sons.
The lord of the Underworld pressed his forehead to Persephone’s, staring into those gorgeous green eyes, and couldn’t help but notice that they were flickering a little, the glow dulling. “I see you are having trouble controlling your human side.” Persephone glanced down.
He turned to see Gabriel gazing up at him with his golden-amber eyes filled with understanding. Sam wryly laughed. “Jesus, Gabriel. When will this shit ever end?”
Charlie Bradbury tossed and turned in her bed, an arm planted heavily over her eyelids. She had felt a migraine coming along all day, and now, instead of continuing her rewatch of Harry Potter, she was instead stuck with the remarkably shitty feeling of her head simultaneously cracking into a million pieces, being frozen in sub-zero temperatures, and also having molten lava poured through it.
Dean nodded. “Yeah.”
“‘Wow’? That’s all you have to say?”
? Like,
Suddenly Dean Winchester was gone, and all that remained was the monstrous visage of the Spirit of Vengeance. All the Demons gasped in terror at the horrific sight.
Dean tried to lunge forward, but the cage which was his body prevented him from doing so. “SHUT UP!” he roared.
“Dean, do you even remember a time when you
There was a lull in conversation for a bit before Dean spoke up again. “And there’s no way to fix it?”
“Haha, that’s where you’re wrong Dean-o,” Gabriel announced, popping his sucker out of his mouth, lewdly winking at Sam.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ruby, I- I was wondering if you were free? I can meet you at the library. I- I just really need to be with someone right now.”
“What in the Sam Hill...Sam, will you tell me what’s goin’ on? Because I have no freaking idea about what’s goin’ on with your brother and this guy,'' he gestured toward Castiel. “Is a criminal and is apparently all buddy-buddy with Dean all of a sudden? What’s going on?” He glanced over at the dark haired man who, at being called a criminal, had the decency to look sheepish.
He willed his eyes to return to their previous owner’s green color before strolling up to a very familiar diner and entering, plopping down on a stool at the counter that a
"Dean, it's okay. I'm not Dad. I won't call you any bad names, and I won't think less of you for admitting it."
“Sam, I believe that Dean is tired and needs to heal, as his body went through a lot of stress today. Dean, come on. You two can finish this conversation in the morning.”
“Not a bad person? You’re part of a gang, and are known to be one of the worst of ‘em.”
If Dean could see himself, he would probably be blushing. “I don’t know...it’s a nickname, I guess. I don’t have to call you that if you don’t want me to.”
“Dean, what did you just say?”
Gabriel and Sam had been sitting near Dean’s body, worry emanating off of both of them, when, all of a sudden, the Earth started shaking. The tacky pictures so familiar to motel walls rattled right off the ugly, outdated wallpaper. Sam rushed to hold everything down as the tremors worsened. He could feel his teeth rattling in his skull.
felt about something, whether it was the entire year she boycotted ice cream due to it’s “utter cliche-edness” or when he respected her not wanting to talk about her parents. He also respected her when she broke down while telling him about her parents’ accident, even holding her as she cried. Dean and Charlie just...fit.
to do is be prepared to meet with your friends and discuss Dean. I can live with a few burns and bruises, Sam. However, I cannot live without food.”
“Of course.”
Sam couldn’t argue with that logic, but he still believed that Cas should continue to rest, so to console himself he face-palmed before responding with, “There’s cold pizza on the counter.”
“Enough!”
Castiel nodded and Sam smiled.
Castiel sighed and resigned himself to the already uncomfortable conversation.
“Sorry, Sam, I just… I’ve been thinking,” he tried again. “About, you know, life, in general. You know, with this job I never thought I’d make it past 20. I was never meant to live, but, now, I’m getting old. I’ve been thinking about settling down. I know you’ve been thinking of settling down, going back to college. And I know it’s selfish of me to make you keep going through this life, but I don’t want to settle down...alone. Just like with this life,” Dean paused to gesture at the motel room. “I don’t want to be alone. I want someone with me.”
Sam shot the archangel a look. “Well, he showed up the other day acting really, really weird; kinda like a darker version of himself.”
"Work?"
Dean gulped. He knew exactly what this was about. “Sam,” he sighed, too exhausted by his issues to deny his brother an answer. “You wouldn’t understand.”
The injured man erupted into a fit of painful coughs and pulled himself up into a sitting position, hands white-knuckling as they gripped the couch. Sam sat down on the floor next to him, hands still slightly outstretched in case the man attempted to pass out again. Once Castiel could catch his breath, he relaxed against the couch and looked over at the young Winchester. “Hello, Sam,” he grunted.
“Of course, man, that’s what friends are for. However, we’re all caught up on homework and studying and stuff, so would you mind just indulging a little hobby of mine? It’s a little embarrassing and nerdy.” She tried her hardest to fake blush as she pulled some blueprints out of her bag.
“Different this time, isn’t it?”
The human nodded and the Spirit took a deep breath.
The man set the piece of pie on a plate and sighed. He held up the paper plate with the pie on it. “How about we take this outside?”
the man attached to his hand was. Castiel soon found himself being thrown onto the bed with the creature, as Dean definitely wouldn’t be
, and he couldn’t believe that he had ever lived without feeling like this, without feeling like life was literally running through his veins.
His brother turned to face him. “
The elder Winchester helped his brother up, supporting his weight, and began (gently) dragging his brother to their house. Dean didn’t bother acknowledging his newfound strength; he was too busy worrying about Sam.
There was a pause and then Ruby spoke up again. “Well, we’re almost finished, and I told my mom I’d be home by 8, so I gotta go.” Sam looked up at the clock, and, seeing it was about quarter to 8, stood up. “Oh shoot, yeah, you better get going.”
Remembering his brother, Sam whipped around to see his brother, ethereal eyes still staring forward. There was now a beatific smile upon his features; Sam often wished he could’ve seen a smile on his brother’s face more often, but he never wanted it to be in this way.
Cas’ eyes widened, trying to look innocent. “What?”
Castiel’s eyes widened and he put his hand forward, gently grabbing Dean’s chin and slowly turning the hunter back toward him. To Dean’s surprise, Cas kissed him and then put his forehead against Dean’s own.
“I don’t want to be better. If going into the family business, which I barely tolerate in the first place, makes me better, then I’m good. Any other job? Sign me up. But not what you want me for now. Not for this.”
Sam crooked an eyebrow at Dean. “What I want to talk about is something that you would never agree to talk with me about in a million years. You would do what you always do; avoid the subject. Something is not okay in your world and it's killing you. Now, where were we?”
Dean suddenly was overwhelmed with another vision.
“Dean, it is no inconvenience to me. I want to make sure you’re okay, and, no offense to you or Sam, but I’m not trusting your brother to properly help you either.”
“No.”
“Before I tell you this, you have to promise not to interrupt until I’m done. I really need to focus on what I’m saying, and I have a hard time thinking with you two yapping like mothers whose children are late to dinner.”
Sam stared at the area before him, dumbfounded. Concrete, once a gigantic rift that led to the Underworld, now only showed slight signs of distress, absolutely giving no passerby any impression that it had just swallowed up two people barely fifteen minutes before. The younger Winchester turned his face to the sky and pinched his nose, closing his eyes. Seriously, what the actual hell? He made a rough “chuffing” sound that could’ve easily been mistaken for either a laugh or a sob, and flinched when a hand made contact with his shoulder.
Dumbfounded, Dean blinked at Cas for several seconds before stuttering out, “Move-move over?”
, by the way, and making him
“So what?! To hell with everyone else, as long as it serves Dean?!”
Castiel thought back to what had caught his eye...or rather, who, as Gabriel had said earlier. He had been washing one of the tables by the window when he had noticed a man hunched over on the sidewalk. He had had his head in his hands and was shaking. He had looked troubled, and Castiel had wanted to help him. However, he had a hunch that the man needed alone time, not someone to hover over him and ask if he was okay.
Castiel watched him calmly with calculating eyes, making Sam squirm in the stretch of uncomfortable silence, before pulling himself up to a standing position, swaying as he tried to gain his footing. Once he was stable, he looked Sam dead in the eye. “Sam. You aren’t helpless. I remember a time that I was just like you, frustrated with the whole lot of nothing that I could do as my world fell apart around me...Don’t get me wrong; I blame you for Dean leaving. I haven’t forgiven you, and I probably won’t until we get Dean back-”
The next morning Castiel sat in the diner, trying to quickly eating a banana before Taste of Heaven opened. He couldn’t help but obsess about what he had done last night. Before he had gone back to the trailer park to report to Michael he had done something he would never, ever do: he had followed the mystery man back to his house. Castiel had watched him help a young boy and move around a little bit before the man had frozen and looked outside before pulling the shades shut.
He gave her a slight shrug and a nervous half-smile. “Uh, hey, Charlie. Long time no see.”
“Angels kill people.”
I'M SO SORRY I HAVE NOT POSTED.
“...Well, at least...not fully.”
Sure, yes, Ruby was smart. She had a mind of her own. But she didn’t have a fantastic ability to make decisions in serious situations. Ruby was a lackey, and her mother took advantage of that very much. So, when Ruby was telling her mother about Sam and Dean Winchester’s accident and survival, her mother sucked in a sharp breath before recovering herself, putting on a gentle facade and finding a way to exploit the situation to meet her needs.
) to calm his nerves, only to feel a mix of flakes and slick fluid rub off on his face in some twisted form of war paint. Like he had been burned, he pulled his hand away quickly, and, in the dim lighting, saw they were both covered in a red liquid that looked black in the moonlight shining through the windows. In fact, it looked like he had practically bathed in the stuff; upon further examination, he was completely covered in it. What could it be?
“Yes. There’s something...calming about having a normal life.”
“How what sounded?”
“Dean Winchester, you are the most idiotic intelligent humans I have ever made the acquaintance of,” Cas raged, stopping very close to Dean. “Why would you fall back into these poisonous habits?! How could you?! I will never, ever, let you kill yourself over something like this!”
Also, Dean needs a hug.
(Also, yes, the Spirit is acting a little differently than it did when it was just a voice. All will be explained soon, young Padawans.)
“Hey Sam, what’s up?”
Charlie tapped away on her computer for a minute. “Okay, I got something. So there’s apparently been a ton of mass-murders that the police have been keeping out of the news, happening almost every day.”
There was a pause before Sam spoke up again. "...A guy?"
“Dean, look out!”
Then some dumbass decided to shoot Dean in the shoulder.
“Dean, you just slept for -”
“Hi Uriel. I was just walking back from work.”
, Castiel thought as the door banged into the outside wall of the trailer, his mood officially soured.
“Dean,
He stopped before continuing his stride, feet eating up concrete at a slightly faster pace.
“Cas, you didn’t have to carry me up to my room. And you sure as hell don’t have to spend the night,” Dean said as the other man made sure that he was tucked comfortably into his bed. Cas fixed him with his blue gaze from where he sat on the edge of the bed.
“Why?”
“We’ll save him, Sam. We’ll find a way, no matter what happens.”
He jumped away and waited with Bobby and Sam, looking on in worry and horror. Three minutes later, she opened her eyes, tears swimming in them. Charlie swallowed thickly and composed herself before turning to the men. “I know where Dean is. And you need to hurry.”
But his brother was already out the door. He felt Gabriel put a hand on his back, but he didn’t register it. They both stood in the window, watching their respective brothers fall into their roles.
After twenty minutes of awkward-yet-finessed conversations and frequent apologetic looks shot towards both Anna and the patrons, Castiel plopped down on the stool in front of Gabriel at the counter.
She took her arm and moved it off one of her eyes so that she could grab her cup “Mrs. Maple’s Healing Tea” (ONLY because if she popped anymore aspirin, she’d probably end up with one of those creepy af diseases they put on the label) and immediately winced at the light piercing her vision. “Dammit,” she muttered, before taking a drink of the foul (don’t let that happy sunshine-y name mislead you - it’s absolutely rancid) substance. No sooner had she set the cup back down on its coaster than she got hit by the vision that had been ruining her day. Before she got pulled under, Charlie managed to grumble, “Well at least this day can’t get any worse.”
amused Sam’s lap.
When the Commander replied, Castiel could hear the relief in his voice. “Good.”
Merry Christmas :)
At that, Sam laughed bitterly, throwing his head back at the irony of that statement. Dean crossed his arms and leaned back from his brother, crossing his arms while furrowing his brow in confusion.
Enjoy!
“Okay…”
MONSTER of a chapter. Geez. I split it in two, so I WAS going to have the action in this chapter but lo and behold I wrote angst. Ugh. I have a problem.
“Nope.”
Silence overtook the conversation once more, an awkward tension in the air. Castiel took a moment to study the features of Dean’s face. Moonlight cast shadows over the other boy’s face, making him seem almost ethereal. He continued to observe as the boy watched the moon shine over the woods in front of them with a mysteriously wistful expression on his face. It was very calm until Dean disturbed the silence.
Dean woke up to the low rumble of voices below him.
When the younger man finally spoke again, he didn’t care that his voice came out frigid. “Trust me, Michael. You won’t.” At the lack of response from the other side of the line, Castiel scoffed. “Text me the details of the meeting,
Cas rolled his eyes. “Dean, I’m here looking out for you as a friend, okay? Nothing more.”
“Well you love it, and I need it. Come on…” Dean doesn’t even know what he wants more, food or sex, and that says a lot for the man who puts nothing before his food. Well that was until he and Cas got involved. But still, they sit down to have dinner anyway.
"So, umm how was the hunt?" Dean asked awkwardly
"Hmm, amazing. You're amazing. I'm sorry it took me so long…" Dean let his voice trail off.
“I am happy Dean. Thank you” Cas seems so at peace, Dean can’t help but give away a small shy smile, the one only Cas can bring out of him.
"Sammy, please, just listen to me" Dean tries lowering his voice and calm down. He was half begging, half demanding.
"I hope some day you can forgive me"
Dean was so angry and a little sad that his boyfriend doesn’t care in the slightest, of what he's asking him to -not- do.
The next day he was busy baking Donna's birthday cake while his mom was cooking most of the food. They were trying to keep Donna from helping out, since it was her birthday after all, so she just sat at the table next to them, telling them funny stories about work.
The angel no longer had his grace, but he still had some small amount of angelic power running through him, so even though he was not immune to injury, he had hyper senses and some more than average strength.
“Just a kiss.”
I wrote two parts today. I've had the majority of this chapter done for like two weeks. I've just been stressed and tired and stressed and tired and stressed and-
Finally, he made it to Hades, who smiled in joy. “
“I just want what’s best for you, Castiel. And, after what happened at the Sandbox last year--” Castiel tensed further, without regard for the many, many muscles protesting. “--I don’t want any repeats.”
“And why would you do that? Because last I checked, you wanted me to be good and gone, not causing any trouble for you.”
The older man nodded. “I remember. Dean mentioned them a few times. Do you know why they’re coming here?”
, that man was a nuisance. He couldn’t just put up and shut up. It was getting hard for him to even think.
The brunette sat up at attention, the pain that accompanied the motion far off in the distance as he swallowed. “Yes, Michael?”
Dean didn't say a word, but when Cas put his hand over Dean's groin, he gasped he grabbed his hand instinctively, moving it away.
“Oh. Too tired for that.. Leave it” Dean can’t possibly go anywhere right now.
"Alright." Cas simply said and started again.
“Yes…” Dean hisses and backs into Cas, his body begging to be touched more deeply.
“Cas..You’re amazing” Dean murmurs, and Cas presses up against him even harder, thrusting his hip into Dean’s, feeling his hard cock grinding over his own, the friction making them both moan.
“I… I want you. Don’t stop, angel” Dean pleads. Cas twists his fingers inside Dean, causing him to gasp and lean his ass into the touch.
"Yes, I very much want you in my bed, Cas. Want to hug you and sleep with your arms around me. Ok?" Dean said in a shy voice as he looked into Cas' eyes. Cas smiled in understanding.
"w-why?" Dean stuttered, a tear falling from his eye.
They ate some great food, drank beer, and had a good time together.
When he returned he went straight back to bed.
He was in bed with Cas, who was spooning him from behind and showering kissed over his head, cheek, arms.
They sat in silence for the remaining time it took to get the older boy patched up before Sam broke the silence. “Can you tell me more about what’s going on with Dean?”
Bobby’s words clamored through Dean’s head on repeat, following him around throughout the day. That was all Dean could think about while working, while making sure Sam was good and fed, and while he was walking toward the diner he had promised to meet Castiel at. Dean’s feet moved as if they were moving through sludge as he stepped, when, really, Dean was walking like that because he was afraid. What would Castiel do? If Bobby was right and Castiel was one of the most dangerous Angels, then what would he do? Is he going to tell people about the other night at the docks? If he hadn’t already?
The real version weighed his options before deciding. “You know what? Fuck it. Fine. Do you want me to do my wish now?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ten minutes later, Bobby let himself into the Winchester house to find Dean’s best friend, Sam, and Castiel freaking Novak draped over the odds-and-ends furniture that occupied the Winchester’s living room. The injured Angel was staring at Charlie with an almost fearful expression as she played Candy Crush on her phone, legs thrown over a
“Whoa whoa whoa, Cas,” the teen said, reaching out toward the man in case he needed to be steadied. “You need to lie back down.” At that, he was met with a pair of obstinate blue eyes.
“Dean?”
Just got done with exams and have been super busy, but this fic is not abandoned. Slow-going, sure, but not abandoned. ❤️
When had he been arrested? Last time Dean woke up in a prison cell he had been 16 and had been caught stealing a loaf of bread so Sammy could eat. Were they going hungry again?
Castiel was internally freaking out - this new ability only further confirmed that this wasn’t Dean. He quickly filed this new information away though (he was a little occupied with not having mutual non-consensual intercourse with his best friend) and strengthened his resolve before forcibly shoving the creature off of him and onto the scratchy shag carpet that had most definitely not been deep-cleaned since shag carpet was in.
“Yeah, that would be Dean Winchester.”
“Samuel Winchester, I swear on the grave of Han Solo that if you do not get out here right now I will start throwing punches...okay well I’m not going to throw punches but I can do...something.”
“...Shut. Up,” Dean ground out, squeezing his eyes shut. Unbeknownst to him, it grinned at its growing success, proud that it was getting under the man’s skin so easily...well, metaphorically. It was already literally inside his skin.
Castiel’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Dean, I have no intention of hurting you. You must know that, right?”
"I know, it's just...I feel like we're running in circles. It's shitty."
His brother started walking away and Sam, stunned, hesitated to get up for a split second. “Dean! Don’t! We can fix this!”
Cas looked at Dean, unamused. “Yes, I have to sleep somewhere.”
The Dean x Spirit!Dean kiss was a little modeled after a demon deal. But also, I'm tired, and had no intention of writing the mind space scenes at all...
Sam didn’t acknowledge the last part, crossed his arms and leaned on his crutch against the door frame. "That's funny, because I called Bobby when you didn't call me by 9:00 to say you'd be home later. He said you cut right out after your shift ended."
My Teen Wolf fan came out in this chapter but even I wouldn't catch it if I didn't know or even if I DID know so if you do catch it you are amazing. I'm sorry for rambling so much. I'll stop now.
Sam’s head jerked to the side to see Gabriel staring up at him with a worried but determined expression. “Sam, you need to step away from the window. Hades is coming for his Persephone, and you do
The younger rolled his eyes at Dean’s attempt to remain dignified before fixating his attention back on his brother.
“Aww, come on, you have your brooding face on,” Gabe said playfully before turning to a more serious tone. “You know you can tell me anything, right?”
, to entertain himself with until you get boring. You think a gang member cares about you? I’ve seen his soul, Dean, he’s no innocent. He doesn’t care about you. Honestly, when you think about it, nobody cares about you. They only pity you and use you.”
“Did Sam tell you my name and that I would be here?”
Its expression became mocking. “Oh, yeah, that's right: your precious little family. Sammy and Castiel. You think they’ll
Dean stopped, momentarily startled. The Spirit had been quiet lately, having been sitting back happy and full while Dean killed his way through Demon after Demon (which was becoming way too easy these days, something that worried Dean very much). He resumed walking.
“Not that you would know, because you never bothered to actually listen to your brother due to your irrational anger that ultimately caused Dean’s downfall, but Dean’s currently being possessed by a creature.”
Castiel’s eyes were pure ice as he stared down the other man. “Dean makes his own decisions,” he ground out. “And it was helping him.”
“I heard there were a few Demons over by the docks. Go see what they’re doing and report back to me.”
Castiel whirled around to see his cousin Gabriel rolling his eyes at him and gesturing toward the disgruntled patrons who were waiting for their liquid energy. By said patrons was Castiel’s Aunt Anna, who currently was attempting to calm down patrons saying that more coffee was being made and that they should get some shortly. Castiel, after a split second of wondering what was going on, realized he was carrying the only full and ready coffee pots currently in the place.
The man in question, the man he had been growing to like in a more intimate way, who had had a soul-deep battle with a supernatural being less than two days ago, was standing in front of him, looking a little worse for wear, but somehow somewhat okay, which is a major difference from when Castiel had seen him last. Dean looked exhausted, but he looked alive, so that was definitely an improvement.
“Sam, I know,” Gabriel said, moving closer. “I know. But this isn’t fully under his control. Nobody could’ve foreseen this happening, and, if they had, they wouldn’t have been able to stop it.”
“It’s…” she trailed off and reached into the backseat to grab a notebook and some crayons. Charlie worked for a little bit on her drawing and, when finished, handed the notebook to Dean, then put the car into drive. Dean looked down to see a miasma of gold shot through with dark red, black, and bright orange.
cocked his brother’s head and smirked, so like his brother but so
Dean hesitantly opened his eyes - were they even his eyes anymore? Or were they the Spirit’s? - and was completely disoriented. He took in his surroundings. It was dark, but, as his eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, he found himself to be in a jail cell. Concrete walls surrounded him, save for the bars that were opposite him. Upon further examination, aka when Dean finally got a good grip on his faculties, he was sitting in a corner of the cell, the cool cement seeping into his clothes as he grounded himself.
Dean parted Cas' butt cheeks and brushed his index finger in his hole, playing with it, making Cas cry out with pleasure. He gently pushed his finger in.
He didn't have to move to know that it was Cas. Dean was still laying on his side, Cas sitting on the other side of the bed now.
"Cas… I don’t know." Dean started but went quiet.
“What do you want, dean?” Cas asks. Usually Dean would be fast asleep after all that intense sex.
Taking Dean into his mouth and fucking him with the plug, and again, when Dean was reaching his orgasm, Cas stopped and waited until Dean cooled off a tiny bit.
Dean is making dinner, boiling pasta and stirring the sauce, while humming to himself quietly. He would have chosen to make some burgers but he knows Cas likes his pasta, and he really wants to lick that sauce off his lips if they get dirty. He imagines licking Cas’s lips, neck, and how his body reacts. He jumps when he feels a hand over his waist, grabbing him from behind. He feels embarrassed about his thoughts, but then thinks to himself, it’s just Cas, and leans backwards for the touch. Cas kisses his cheek.
"Dean…sweetheart." Cas could literally feel his heart breaking.
But they just stopped having sex.
“You could never” he says and grinds his ass up Cas’s groin. Cas is taken for a moment, but he’s on board after a quick second, reaching over to put his hand over dean’s groin, feeling him getting hard already. He puts some pressure over the denim and Dean moans softly.
"Hey, Cas. m'sorry I didn't come say hello" Dean said shyly as he brushed his hand over the back of his head.
Dean wanted to punch them both.
Cas texted him all morning
"I understand." Cas felt heartbroken. He let go of Dean and got out of bed.
And the other thing was, he didn't even touch himself ever since that. He wasn't aroused at all, not even when waking up in the morning. He was a bit concerned.
Sam caught a case down in Ohio, a nasty ghost so it seemed. Only problem was, the boys have invited Mary and Donna over for a few days to celebrate Donna's birthday, and they were arriving tomorrow morning.
After a while Dean leaned back and kissed Cas on the lips, soft and sweet.
"On your hands and knees, now" Cas said in his low voice that made Dean shiver.
Dean's eyes grew wide as he understood Cas was still going. It was like a slap in the face.
Dean closed his eyes.
He sat on the bed, head in his hands, thinking, feeling a little choked up, when Cas stormed in after him, standing in front of him with his hands crossed over his chest.
This is not the way it was meant to go. He actually didn’t think so far ahead, but his attempt to whatever it was he tried to do, failed miserably.
Dean nodded.
'How are you feeling today?'
He felt awfully ashamed of his nakedness and his position, his eyes were wide and finally, after 2 seconds that seemed like a lifetime, he remembered he can speak, and he knew exactly what to say.
'What about you?' Cas immediately answered.
He bit his lip and turned on his phone. The texts from Cas were streaming in, the first one was right after Dean texted him last.
Something cold was touching Dean's ass, and when Cas started pushing it in him, he realized what it was.
“Cas…”
“Mmm?” Cas returns.
"Honey, did you do all this?" mom called out as she and Donna went down the stairs. The bunker was filled with colorful balloons, music was playing in the background, and some amazing smells cam out of the kitchen.
"it's OK, you just need someone to show you how to behave. I'll show you, Dean." Cas said in a pleased voice and pulled the plug all the way out and slammed it back in, all the way into his tight ass.
Cas was licking and sucking, while moving one hand down to push the but plug in and out of Dean. Dean was growling and enjoying every second of it, feeling like he'll never feel this good again, feeling the orgasm finally building up and about to burst out of him, and then it all stopped.
“Cas, for the first time in my miserable life, not only am I happy, but… you made me believe that I might actually deserve it. I… I don’t know what I’d do without you, angel” Dean Whispers, his heart a bit heavy from the amount of love and emotion he holds for his partner.
“If you want more, you’ll get more” Cas says and just like that pushes his hard cock inside Dean, pumping in and out, fucking him again with no mercy, reaching down to tweak his nipples and finally to grab his dick and stroke it while fucking him. Dean is in heaven, making such obscene sounds he could play in a porno, but he can’t help it. he’s arching his back and biting his lip, moaning like no one else exist in the world but him and his angel.
"Dean, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel this way.. I'm.. so sorry" Cas felt awful, being the one who put his baby in this position.
"Please, fuck me, Cas" Dean was begging him with all he had. Cas bit his lips, wanting to fuck Dean so badly, his own cock so hard and aching in those pants, but he had to keep going with what he had in mind.
"You still want me here in your bed?" Cas was so unsure. Perhaps he should leave? He could see Dean was not ok.
The next one was from that afternoon
You're not going alone on that hunt!" Dean was practically yelling.
But Sam wouldn’t hear it. He said he's going and that's final, and when Cas stumbled over to the war room, he immediately joined in with the conversation.
And Dean did that, with the plug still in him.
Because whenever he has a good thing going for him, it gets taken away somehow. And Cas knows Dean is just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
"please, get out" he was begging him.
He was ashamed of his reaction.
He didn’t answer. Cas reached over and put his hand over Dean's shoulder.
When Donna called it a night, mom finally scooched over to Dean and put her head against his shoulder.
"He's not going" Dean kept saying at Sam as he walked away.
“Hmm?” he asks to make sure this is what Dean Wants, and he nods in agreement. Cas slide 2 fingers at once into Dean, he feels his own cum still inside, warm and slick, he starts massaging Dean’s hole and prostate, gently this time, sliding his fingers in and out, and Dean leans over to kiss him, fingering his lips and tongue and sucking hard, while Cas is finger fucking him until he can’t take it anymore and comes again without even being touched.
Tears were streaming down Dean's face again, and he was sniffing his nose.
The next day Dean was feeling excited. Mom and Donna were coming over and he had lots to do. He went to the grocery store and bought a whole bunch of stuff. He was gonna bake them apple, cherry and pumpkin pies. And of course, fresh burgers for dinner. He also got balloons and ribbons and cake decorations.
Dean was stroking Cas' hips and after some time, moved his hand to grab his ass. Cas moaned in approval. Dean felt like the denim was in his way, he wanted to feel Cas, he missed him so much.
“No, what I
“Well, uh..I’ll keep that in mind,” he replied quickly, trying to get out of this conversation as soon as humanly possible. “Do you know if Michael’s around?”
Wait, wait...is that actual character growth I see??
“Do you remember that guy outside the diner the other day?”
The Angel raised an eyebrow. “Cas?”
in this hellhole.
“Nothing like another group of Demons that have absolutely no idea why their gang tried to kill me and Sammy.”
The archangel removed his hand from the giant’s shoulder and remained close-mouthed, silently urging Sam to let it out. Sam roughly ran both hands through his hair as he glared at the sky. “I mean seriously, Chuck, when will this ever end?! Dean, Cas, we’ve all been through so much of this bullshit! And- And we thought it was done, you know? The- The countless Big Bads around every corner, the plots that continuously tear down everything we attempt to build, and the witches and the curses and Hell and everything and now? Now when we are finally, finally allowed to have the chance to build just a tiny, tiny life of our own, another thing gets thrown at us! When does it END, Chuck?!”
“What the hell?” Dean said under his breath.
“So what - or should I say who -”, Gabriel asked with a suggestive wink. “Caught your eye this time?”
But he still couldn’t get the man out of his head.
The injured man scoffed and grabbed the bottle of whiskey out of Sam’s hand, taking a pull from the bottle before handing it back. “Who do you think?” Sam’s eyes widened as his heart dropped.
As soon as Gabriel confirmed that, Dean, previously silent, grabbed his head and collapsed.
Sam looked at his older brother as if he was an idiot. “Of course, Dean. I was there when a bunch of...gangsters, I guess, tried to kill us.”
All of a sudden someone came into the store. Dean looked up, interrupted from examining the logs, from where he sat at the front desk. There was a tall man staring at him intensely, blue eyes meeting green. Their eye contact continued until Dean finally broke it to look to see if Bobby was in the area. This man looked familiar, but Dean couldn’t place him for some reason.
“Castiel,” Michael started, softly. “You know that that is not true. I just...I worry about you. You’re my charge, and you haven’t been back to the park in months.”
Sam sighed and then sniffed, as if he had been recently crying. “I can’t talk about it, Rube, I’m sorry. Can we meet in an hour?”
Unfortunately, that one innocent moment taken to relish the hot liquid was the same moment somebody chose to hit Cole on the head with an extremely hard object. He felt the sharp pain on the back of his head, spilling hot coffee all over his lap with the shock of it, adding to that pain, and fell to the floor. The last thing he saw was a masked figure shut off the monitors.
"Castiel, stop." With those words, his jaw snapped shut with an audible click.
“What is this, an intervention?” Dean asked disbelievingly, jumping out of bed.
Here is the new chapter and more should be coming soon. I'm gonna attempt to work on this more, even though this story legitimately sucks :)
Ruby, ten minutes later: yo Sam have this map as a distraction sex is for dummies
Ruby nodded, glancing up at Sam while chewing on her pencil’s eraser. “So we would need to either figure out a way to crank up the furnace or somehow not have the body heat show up.”
"I, uh, well-"
“What’s up Cassie?”
Castiel put his head in his hands, digging his fingers into his scalp. Remarkable that only a five minute conversation can devastate oneself so easily.
That was all Dean could manage, his heart was beating so fast with anxiety. Every beat felt like an impending death sentence.
She gave him a minute smile, gathered up her belongings, including the map, and left. Sam shook his head and stretched before grabbing his backpack and slinging it over his shoulder. As he made his way to the library exit and descended the library steps, Ruby was on his mind. Where did they stand? Were they together or just friends? He knew Dean didn’t like her, but he kind of liked her, and screw what Dean thought.
“Eat something?” Sam asked, Gabriel’s response stemming his questions out of shock. The archangel didn’t speak directly to him once after the ingredient wisecrack and he was surprised that Gabriel finally answered. The archangel turned back to the ingredients.
Dean gulped. “Nah, you can look like me. I was just startled, that’s all.”
“Castiel, are you alright? The..the last time we spoke wasn’t pleasant, and I would like to know about...your well-being.”
Dean froze before recovering himself, popping the lid on the beer. "Geez Sammy, nosy much?"
The Spirit winced. “If you want to put it crudely, then yes. Although, really, it isn’t the ‘shittiest’ part of you, more like the part that lusts for power and control, the part that doesn’t care about self control.”
Thank you to all who read this and comment and give kudos. Appreciation means more to me than you will ever know ❤️ love y'all.
“‘We’?”
I'm actually attempting to move along with the demon storyline. Yayyy!!! (Who are Ruby and Lilith trying to break out? Gee, so hard to think of someone...)
“We’re finally gonna break him out.”
Castiel peeled his t-shirt off, wincing as the parts of the shirt that had dried into his wounds with the blood ripped his wounds back open. Sam cringed at the sight. The man in front of his was just one giant bruise. On top of the two black eyes and the finger bruises on his neck he was sporting, he was black and blue all over, with cuts and gashes freely bleeding all over his chest. And, from the looks of it, all the injuries didn’t stop at the stomach. Mild burns peppered his arms. Sam held in the urge to gag as the man in front of him calmly observed him. “Jeez, Cas,” he croaked out. “Who did this to you?”
Gabriel chanced a glance outside before getting a very, very worried expression on his face. “Shit shit shit shit shit.”
The Angel rose to his full height, and the whole room seemed to shrink from the pure fury rolling off the man. “It was for the greater good, Bobby. The Demons hurt people. They hurt
“Yup. You know the tale of Hades and Persephone, Sammy. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy drags girl to the Underworld, girl gets trapped there for half a year because she couldn’t help her pomegranate cravings, yada yada. So as long as Deansephone doesn’t get a case of the munchies, we should be in the clear.”
A filler chapter? Huh? Nahhh.
The elder brother sat up in bed, wincing at the pain in his back due to the uncomfortable motel bed. He rubbed a hand over his eyes and sighed.
Also, I don't like turkey. I don't know why I fixated on the sandwich. However, come to think of it, a sandwich sounds really good right now.
Gabriel gasped with fake shock, theatrically putting his hand over his heart.
“Ruby,” her mom said slyly, her voice soothing and expression falsely innocent. “Tell me about those Winchesters. Sam’s in your class, right?”
He shook his head and glared at the creature. “There’s a lot you don’t know about me.” The snarl-grin grew wider before the creature’s eyes glowed orange and it peered at Castiel, staring deep into...what felt like his soul.
Dean began to shake his head before suddenly a flurry of memories came rushing back.
- aHAHAHA the demons plan is kind of revealed
Slightly irritated by the teen’s suspicious tone, Dean brushed past his brother. "Work." Sam raised an eyebrow.
“Still working at Anna’s?”
Okay, so the end of this is weird as hell, pun not intended, but I had no idea how to write the ending of this chapter so I made it work.
“I called him.”
“Dean, we need to talk.”
were the one who was watching me at my house that night?!”
Sam paused at his brother’s interruption and glanced at him in confusion. “Huh?”
And with that, he hung up and promptly passed back out.
Castiel brushed his fingers through his dark, unruly hair and then rubbed his eyes.
All comments and kudos are love ❤️
“So….why were you laying on the sidewalk?”
“So what does that mean? Cas is suddenly Hades, Greek god of Death and the Underworld?” Sam asked.
His brother didn’t move to look at him. Instead, Dean sat up slowly, acting as if he was in a trance. He opened his mouth and one word came out in a voice that both belonged to his brother and didn’t.
Aw, poor lil Sammy. He just wants everything to be okay. Too bad this is SPN, because SPN wouldn't be SPN without angst.
Gabriel glared at Dean for the interruption and then continued. “Well, this is where this gets a little tricky. The new Hades is the angel who has spent the most time in Hell, and has been subjected to the most Hell magic. Other than Lucifer, Castiel is the one who has been in the deepest levels of Hell. Therefore, Hell has decided on its new ruler.”
He stood and slid the small window in the door open to find the Creature staring blankly at him with hellish orange eyes. Slowly recognition dawned upon its features, causing its mouth to curl up. "Hey hot stuff. How's it hangin'?"
Hades frowned a little, tightening his grip on his love’s waist. “So much has changed. Demons have absolutely destroyed it in the many battles that have occurred since the last time we resided here. It is going to take a while before everything is back in order.”
Gabriel leaned over to refill some of the stragglers’ coffees. “Geez, you can cut the tension with a knife, am I right?”
Bodies. Bodies were everywhere. The dripping that he had awakened to was the blood of a woman who was impaled on a nail in the warehouse wall as it fell from her many open wounds, her glazed eyes staring blankly up at the dark night sky. He looked around to find that many cold, dead stares lost to the cold grasp of the grim reaper. He swallowed. This was a massacre. How had he managed to be the lone survivor?
Destiel fluff and chaotic bisexuality are two things I highly enjoy.
Castiel filled Dean in on how there was a major Demon drug and arms deal going down at the docks. The blond could feel the bloodlust surge up just from the mere mention of Demons. The Spirit was growling in anticipation; it was ready to feed.
After a while of quiet driving Charlie was the one to break the tense silence.
“Oh shit,” Charlie said, color draining from her face. “After I picked him up we went back to my house and he was telling me about the accident...and I was telling him that I thought that the Demons - the gang - were responsible for it. He might be going after them.”
Dean scoffed. “Yeah, and I never will, you sick motherfucker.” He wheezed the last word as he forced himself onto his back.
With that, Castiel nodded and schooled his facial expression before departing. Sam breathed out through his nose, worried for the boy, before heading toward the basement.
Ruby smirked. “Mom, are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
Dean #1 then quickly kissed Dean #3, or, well, tried to. The Dean 3.0 held onto his waist in an iron grip and forced his tongue into the original Dean’s mouth, and sucked something out of what felt like Dean’s very core. Dean went pliant in the Doppelganger’s hold and, once the Doppelganger stopped violating Dean’s mouth, he looked up into fiery orange eyes. Instinctively he tried to fight, but then he had no will to. In fact he had no will at all.
Sam unconsciously leant into the touch, leaning into the hand that held him when he had nightmares, the hand that held his own on the first day in every school they went to until Sam decided it was “uncool”, the hand that stitched him up after dangerous hunts, and he was almost convinced by the smooth voice of the god that was in his brother. But then he stopped and quickly scrambled away. “
The elder brother shook his head, utterly and completely confused.
Dean sat in stunned silence. After the revelation of being trapped in his head and the initial shock, the Spirit had had the courtesy to explain the situation to him.
All of a sudden, Dean was seeing what he could only describe as...Castiel. There was gold and blue mixed with a darker navy that just seemed to shine brighter than any sun.
“The guy outside the diner the other day.”
The mystery man leaned forward to reveal the face Dean saw every day in the mirror. “Dean, we need to talk.”
“Uh, well something’s not right-”
Gabriel sighed and pushed the heel of his hands into his eyes before answering. “I was afraid this would happen.” He then summoned a candy cane into his hand and sucked on it thoughtfully, leaving the brothers in suspense before finally breaking the tension.
They chat about the latest GOT episode they all watched together with Sammy, wondering how angry he’ll get if they continue it without him.
He was up there in a second, obeying as usual.
"Can I please hold you?" Cas was asking for permission, trying not to scare Dean again.
“you’ll thank me in the morning, when all your limbs aren’t aching and sore” Cas places a gentle kiss on Dean’s lips, the other man already back to sleep, but after a few minutes he can feel himself being lifted, the brush of feathers around him making him feel loved and secured and he smiles to himself, thinking he must be dreaming.
Eventually the water runs cold and Cas helps them both out, drying every part of Dean’s body, worshiping him. They go back to bed, still naked, facing each other and pressed together on every surface of their body.
"I am. Stop being a child, Dean." Cas said with a stern face. He was getting angry. Trying to please Dean can be exhausting.
They end up watching some chick flick movie that Dean loves and Cas is ok with. Dean is lying between Cas’s legs, leaning against his chest, and after some time he falls asleep. He can feel feather like kisses on his face, and the feeling of being lifted with no effort, being engulfed in Cas’s arms, his head leaning into his chest and his arms instinctively wrap themselves around his neck. Cas smiles at the sight and places Dean carefully in his bed.
"I'm sorry Dean, you can stay here, you should stay here, keep mom and Donna company until I come back" Sam sounded resigned on going.
Cas's tongue was not there anymore, and the plug was in him but not moving. He opened his eyes, breathing heavy, his chest rising and falling, looking confused.
'Dean, just answer the phone'
Cas pulls his tongue out and reaches over Dean to the night stand, grabbing the lube. He puts some on his hands, tempted to touch his own throbbing hard cock, but he doesn’t. He lubes his finger and presses one against Dean’s crack, feeling how tight he is.
Dean was starting to remember their fight from before, almost blocked out of his memory at this point.
"Hmm, yes… don't stop" Dean was moving his hips back and forth.
"Turn around" he told Dean and the man obeyed, turning over to be face to face with Cas. he looked scared.
"I'll be there to look after Sam" Cas added.
"That's ok. Hello" Cas said, trying to examine Dean's face, not really sure what to do.
'Does this new man still wants me?'
Dean gasped and choked a little but didn’t say anything. Cas was kissing his shoulders.
"What are you talking about, ma?"
He felt like his insides were ripped apart, like the whole world was closing in on him, and he was so tired, like all his batteries had run out.
With all those thoughts in his head, he fell asleep.
He stormed off and went into their shared bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
He decided to answer Cas.
“you ok?” Cas asks and caresses Dean’s back in a loving way that Dean is feeling overwhelmed at how someone can be so attentive to him.
'I love you, goodnight' he saw on his screen just before he closed his eyes.
His voice was raspy and broken.
“yes” he breaths and Cas is now hard again, and he doesn’t care about anything anymore, he flips Dean on his back and all of a sudden Dean is tied to the bed, both hands are cuffed and spread out over the head board, his legs are spread wide, each leg is tied to it’s own ankle and he lays there, like a butterfly, opened and vulnerable, thinking how he could never be that way with anyone else in the entire universe but his own private angel.
Cas continued to slap Dean's ass and thighs until his ass was a deep red color and Dean was fighting back his tears.
"Well, yes. Dean, I can't let Sam go alone. It's not safe" Cas brushed his hands over Dean's hair. The moment Dean felt his touch, a broken sob left his throat and the tears began streaming. He shut his eyes, trying to escape Cas' look.
He huffed.
So Cas got off the bed, not hugging Dean as he wished to do, and left the room, closing the door behind him, still hearing the gentle sobs coming out of the room.
“I need you… inside me” Dean asks and refuses to feel ashamed at the words. Cas takes his hand and rubs Dean’s sore ass, reaching over to spread his legs, and place his finger in Dean’s entrance.
Cas smiled. He wanted Dean to relax, to let go of all his anger and control issues. He knew exactly where Dean's mind was at – he was beating himself up about not being able to control this, to control Sam and Cas and making them do as he pleased.
Cas looked at how beautiful Dean looked like that, all ready and horny and his. Only one thing was missing, so he reached over to the sex drawer, taking the blue tie he knew Dean loves, and went on to tying Dean's hands together, above his head and onto the bed's head bord.
Cas grabbed Dean's ass tightly, trying to increase the friction. Their cocks were aligned together, slicked with precome. Cas held on to Dean's prefect ass, bringing him closer and closer as Dean was thrusting into him, eventually taking both their cocks in his hand, stroking them together as he thrusted into his fist, rubbing off on Cas' hard cock.
"Dude, relax. It's not like I never hunted alone, plus Cas is with me so what are you all worked up about?" Sam was honestly confused, but he also didn't really care all that much. No one was gonna tell him what to do, not even his big brother.
“Good” Dean kisses him and falls asleep, wishing and dreaming of a lifetime of Cas by his side.
Dean was demanding Sam would call up Garth and send him instead, or look for someone else; he couldn’t leave his best girls high and dry, and he obviously wasn't gonna let people die. He was just willing to let this one go, to another well trained hunter.
“Yes..Keep going… fuck me, Cas. Harder… harder” he begs, and Cas does just that, as tears are flooding Dean’s eyes all of a sudden, causing Cas to stop. Dean opens his eyes, his body almost bursting with lust. “Keep going” he begs and Cas nods and continues thrusting deep inside Dean, while jerking him off. Dean’s head is thrown back to the pillow, his eyes are rolling in the back of his head and the tears are spilling out as he cums so hard once again, feeling so spent he could die and not care one bit. Cas is still going, fucking him raw, while Dean rides out his orgasm and Cas is reaching his, spilling his load inside Dean, again, still stroking his dick. After a few moments he catches his breath and moves out of Dean, unties his arms and legs and helps him move him limbs again into a laying position.
Cas obliges and starts fingering him in and out in deep motions while his other hand is grabbing one ass cheek so hard it will surely leave a mark. He leans down and bites the soft skin, while adding a second finger, scissoring Dean.
"Yes, please" Dean answered as their bodies collided together in a warm embrace. They pressed every part of their bodied they could to one another, Dean nuzzling his face in Cas' neck, and Cas stroking his body in soothing movements from his head to his back.
"You're so beautiful" he murmured and put his hand over Dean's butt cheeks, massaging lightly, making Dean moan and move, trying to get Cas to keep touching.
They came almost at the same time, Cas in a low growl and Dean practically screaming into Cas' mouth.
"No, Cas. you're not going anywhere, and neither is Sam. Listen you two, I'm calling Garth, he'll take care of it, and Donna can have her birthday with all of us, she deserves that." Dean tried to reason with them.
The bedroom was the one place Dean truly gave himself over to Cas, submitting to him, pleasing him, doing what he's told with no arguments or questions. They both liked it, from time to time.
He also let his mom know he's expecting her and turned off his cell. He went back to bed and spent the rest of his day there. By evening he finally felt a little better and took a shower, drank some water and watched a movie. He even laughed at one point.
Dean thought about seeing Cas later today when he comes back, and he had some mixed feelings about that. He missed him like crazy, and he needed to hug him, badly.
When he feels the water around him he opens his eyes and realizes he’s not dreaming, he’s inside the bath tub and Cas is entering after him, placing Dean between his legs. The water is warm and the room is all foggy.
"You were never gonna let me come?" he whispered.
"Cas, please… I need to come." Dean didn't know how else to ask, he was so desperate.
"Turn around" Cas ordered.
He didn't even bring himself to think where Cas was. He dove right back to sleep.
"Don’t move" Cas added in a harsh tone.
“I'm not going anywhere. I promise. As long as you’ll have me, I’ll be here for you”
"Dean, this is about handing over control" Cas finally said. Dean tried to focus his eyes and find Cas's face. He did, after a few hazy seconds.
I hope you enjoyed this. This is one of the few chapters I'm not totally and completely ashamed of lol. Stay safe and stay healthy, loves.
The spirit laughed.
“How about working, Gabe?”
Shit. Did he just say that out loud?
Castiel sighed. “Demons are a big problem. They kill people and-”
The blond shook his head. “No, someone’s always out to hurt me.”
Once more, there was a pause. Castiel finally spoke up. “We..could remedy that hunger.”
“What?!”
“Dean this is not dealing! Becoming an alcoholic is not a smart way to fix a problem!” Sam shouted, tired of his brother’s bullshit. Dean opened his mouth to shoot a scathing response back at his brother but was cut off by Cas.
Sam finds out.
“Dean Winchester is very strong, and his soul isn’t...fully embracing this new change,” he replied softly. “I can handle it, though, Hades. I’m stronger than I look...well, looked. This body is much stronger than my last.”
The younger Winchester winced, swallowed, and steeled himself before speaking. This thing in front of him wasn’t Dean; it was just another monster. “What do you want?” he gritted out.
"Castiel, where were you yesterday?"
“If your own family doesn’t love you, how can you expect anyone, let alone Castiel, to do so?” Dean’s eyes shot to the monster’s, wide and disbelieving. “Oh don’t even bother to protest, buddy. I’m in here,” it tapped its temple. “Remember? I know everything you know, I’ve felt everything you’ve felt. All you are to him is something new to explore, just a distraction, a
Sam recoiled and, cowed, suddenly became very interested in his sandwich. Castiel felt a pang of guilt strike him through the fog of feelings muddling his brain. “I’m sorry, Sam. I’m fine. I just...I have to go somewhere for a bit.” He swallowed down the bile that was creeping up his throat and stood. “There’s something I need to do.”
“You wouldn’t know Hell if it came up to you wearing a nametag! I am a creature of Hell, and I WON’T be disrespected this-”
“Yes,” the dark haired boy said.
His brother didn’t react, face unchanging. He didn’t even flinch; he was so still.
“Oh, do you
Dean paused in front of the doors to the diner and took a deep breath to calm himself down. He pulled the door open.
They climbed up to the roof via the fire escape and sat on the ledge. For a minute, Castiel stared at the stars before he looked back at the blond man next to him.
“Sorry about my cousin,” Castiel said, dishing out a slice of pie for Dean. “He can get really annoying-”
“What the hell, Dean?! What’s going on?!”
Dean snapped out of it, finding his hands gripping his head as he laid in a fetal position, the Spirit calmly watching him from where he still sat across the room. He quickly got to his feet and lunged at the deity. “You son of a bitch!”
, Dean recognized) and it let go of Dean, letting the Winchester’s face drop none too gently onto the cold, hard cement. It began to pace the room thoughtfully before finding a rest against the wall, a sly smile growing. “You know, Dean, you don’t really know what it’s like, the hunt..the chase. The feeling when you take that first life, the knowledge that you have complete and total power over a meatsuit’s life.”
“Wow,” Cas said.
Dean sighed and propped himself up on his elbows, earning a brief glare from Castiel. “Man, Sammy really didn’t make a good first impression, huh?”
The Spirit gasped and was about to say something when the newest clone waved a hand and seemingly glued the Spirit’s mouth shut.
“Oh really, babe? Let’s see. Cuz I can see a whole lot of shit that you’ve been up to. And you have been a very-,” it paused and tsked. “Very naughty boy. I mean, all the things that your uncle made you do? And the things that you’ve done willingly? All those people, lives ruined and taken, all your fault.” Castiel gulped as a faint outline of that otherworldly skull flickered beneath the creature’s skin, excited for the promise of violence. “I might just need to punish you.”
“Sorry,” he apologized and pointed at his head. “This guy is just yammering away up there.”
