such a grand combination, if he was honest. John found himself really not minding too much if he could have Sherlock's intensity and focus on him like that again.
Sherlock peeled himself up and planted his hands on John's shoulders. He leaned in to nip at John's earlobe and fleetingly drew it into his mouth for a quick suck. John's head thunked back against the wall bonelessly.
John took a long pull from his glass and shakily turned to Hamish.
Sherlock raised his mental estimation of Dr. Sawyer up a few notches. He nodded his thanks and slipped out of the room, down the hall, and into John's office. The bag was exactly where she described and he pushed the stethoscope down to the bottom of the capacious bag. He left the room unobserved and returned to await Sarah back in the kitchen. He heard John's footsteps and voice as he brought his next patient to the room and the noise of him closing his office door.
“I didn't label the carton John.”
“You wanted firelight, it is lit and roaring,” (An open mouthed bite across John's strap-like sternocleidomastoid muscle.) “The table, the give and take.” (A suck and a tantalizing swirl to the skin along the carotid artery.) “All of it, yes. Why did it take you so long?” Sherlock growled again, low and menacing, as John tipped his head back helplessly to give him further access.
John scooped up his wine glass and rose with a sense of finality.
“I really think you'll like it,” John grinned breathlessly.
“Not the groom, you git! You! You just THREW yourself at him, relentless and all touchy and batting your eyelashes at him. It was appalling.”
Mr. Chamberlain  was suddenly on his feet, shouting at John. He needed something. NOW. It was unbearable and he needed to make it all stop and Dr. Watson better do what he asked. John quietly hit the intercom button on his desk phone as he made a pointed display of putting his clipboard and pen down slowly and non threateningly. His thought was that what was happening in his office was now would be broadcast to all the phones in the clinic. Someone could then get the police here as soon as possible. He just had to talk the raving drug deprived man down a bit.
They hardly lasted a few more thrusts when John, without warning, suddenly rocketed off the edge and came violently in short, powerful bursts.
“Mmmm. I like you like this,” John murmured  into his mouth. “You alright?”
John poked his head out of the kitchen for a moment to give Sherlock an odd look.
Well, duh.
. Damn, I want to make you beg for it, plead with me, to
It was Sherlock.
Sherlock smiled slyly up at John.
John's eyes flew open in protest.
“Look,” he started testily. “I walked in and you were making noises like you were the star in a seriously filthy porno. Moaning and carrying on and wriggling about.” I threw the blanket at you and got the hell out.”
The meadow, the picnic items spread out, tea tasted from John's fingertips -  it was all playing out before him and Sherlock leaned forward to catch all the details and nuances that he could.
John bit his lip in distraction and carefully began to turn from the room.
Another nurse approached the desk and picked up a file.
Sherlock knew she was not being entirely serious, but there was a bit of truth in her words. He felt as though he would honor them, if she ever asked for some inexplicable reason.
-----
“Which matter might that be, Sherlock?” she muttered to herself, after right herself a tad. “You stealing John's stuff or giving you inside information on your rival for Dr. Watson's more personal affection and a little push?”
“Ohhh, yes...YEssss...Jooohhhnn...”
I didn't usually crane my neck that much. Lemme see your mouth.” John swiped his thumb across Sherlock's Cupid’s bow and then to the impossibly fuller lower lip in turn.
Dreaming about tea of all things. In a warm grassy spot. A sunny, breezy meadow bursting with heather and beebalm and other wildflowers. He was reclining on a blanket languidly and he recalled breathing it all in and the feeling of serenity and pleasure.
Sherlock felt he deserved some sort of reward for NOT rolling his eyes and spewing out the most embarrassing deductions he could muster at the nurse as they stood, still in the middle of the hallway.
John slept very restlessly that night. He wasn't sure what brought it on, but he was certain that the source had something to do with the infuriating and immaculately dressed consulting detective who was draped across the sofa in front of him in his dream.
Crisis narrowly avoided.
Sherlock smirked, though the effect was slightly ruined by his kiss-swollen lips and look of lust-haze about him.
“Good morning, John. I trust you slept well?”
Sherlock had the actual good grace to hang his head a few degrees.
Sarah flicked her own speculative gaze at John.
“John….that was beyond amazing... ohh, God, yes…” Sherlock panted, snuggling him closer.
John stopped himself, realising that he had gone a bit shrill. He felt his face pale and he unfolded his arms nervously and looked down at them in his lap.
Sherlock burrowed deeper into John's neck and closed his eyes. Sleep didn't come to him as quickly. He almost fought the heavy sensation threatening to engulf him for fear he might wake up, discover this was all a cruel dream, and John would be gone from his arms. He chided himself for such feeble imaginings. John was really here. Of his own volition.
John happened upon Sarah as he was hanging his coat up in the kitchen.
“You are an irreplaceable and engaging idiot. I had hoped you would have reached this conclusion sooner, but you were worth the boredom of waiting for.”
Hamish looked jumpily around as well. “I don't think so. Should we go help Dr. Watson? Oh, man. What if that guy gets violent or crazy?” Hamish froze. He and Blondie looked at each other like proverbial deer in the headlights.
Sherlock felt like he was gaining the high ground again and plowed on. John continued to stroke his scalp absently, but that couldn't be helped.
Sherlock continued to appraise him searchingly. “I found it in my violin case this morning,” he countered calmly.
Objectively? Nope. That wasn't really working. Sherlock smiled and stretched lightly.
Damn Lestrade and his moronic hairdresser case.
He really WAS going to kill Sherlock for this.
John considered this for the briefest of seconds. No way in
And yet, here he was, face-planted into his laptop at the table with a massive headache. What the hell had he been doing? Updating his blog? Oh, THAT would be bloody brilliant in a drunken, brain dead state.
Sherlock could disrupt anything he damned well chose, but heaven forbid if John prevented the free-flow of Sherlock’s own brand of chaotic entropy.
-----
A half of an hour later, Sherlock broke the silence.
The confounded arse had printed it out. Oh, he had seen it alright.
Rosmarinus officinalis. Faintly under the pervasiveness of the lemon and artificial oversteeped tannin notes, but there.
He hadn't wanted to disturb Sherlock.
Silence.
“Hey, at least you didn't get your shoes pissed on by one of the resident’s contraband cats,” John countered.
Sarah smiled again, this time a bit more speculative while still trying to be kindly.
now. It was like having rationed little sips of water all your life in the desert and then suddenly coming upon an oasis overflowing with an endless supply to drink your fill.
“Is that the REAL reason, John? Somehow, I think we haven't gotten to the real heart of the matter.” Sherlock's eyes narrowed to slits as he appraised John from a few inches away.
Sherlock was sitting on the edge of the bed waiting and fretting. He cautiously lifted his eyes to John's just to see if in the span of five minutes, John had changed his mind.
John lifted Sherlock's chin and kissed him softly.
care about him, don't you?” Sarah sternly addressed him as he had tried to tell her good night.
Sherlock gaped. He had had an entire debate structure and persuasive arguments concocted in his brain to gently ease John into acquiescing to the ahem, logic of, well, upping the game, as it were. He was prepared to play dirty. Perhaps that wouldn't be necessary…?
“Sherlock, yes,
. Two words that Sherlock had both written and spoken to John. Two words that would change their lives and hopefully take hold and flourish...
“How did we get here, Sherlock? It's a bloody miracle, honestly, “John softly mused. “You know I love you too, right? I think I always have.”
“Jaaawn...” Sherlock breathed into his mouth. It was all Sherlock could seemingly manage as he clutched and grappled with a savagely tight grip. John maneuvered his own arms around the taut lengthy flanks, pushing him into the alley wall, his lips teasing Sherlock's open until he was finally inside, tasting him. He was warm, wet, and sweet with the tang of juniper from his drink at the bar. John sucked soft, little helpless moans of response from Sherlock’s now pliant mouth. Sherlock felt himself sinking irrevocably under the spell of John's intoxicating words and the deliciously hot response to the way John was making his body
“Sweet dreams, John,” Sherlock murmured in the dark muzzily.
Sherlock's face frowned distractedly. “Dr. Watson relayed that he spoke to your grandmother a bit in her native language before he had to defer to your translations.”
“I'm here for my 12:45 appointment,” Sherlock offered, waiting to see if he could get a fish on the line with minimal information.
“I'm counting on it, love.”
Immediately, he felt as though he had been punched in the solar plexus. It was the letter. THE letter.
“Sherlock, I have to ask you, though,” John's voice intoned mellifluously as Sherlock tried to settle himself even more comfortably on John's warm chest.
me, Doctor,” he cooed, ready to play this game to lose.
Sherlock plucked John's mug of tea from the counter and headed down the hall to take a shower, his brain fully engaged on this new development on John's part.
close…
Hadn't John come in to check on him when he got home? He felt as though he vaguely remembered hearing him crash about a bit before retiring. He had wanted to tell John to stop disturbing him but then felt a brief pang of guilt at recalling waking up with a blanket around him that he hadn't procured himself. John must have kindly put it on him. He really had gotten it tangled around himself as well - he had managed to wrap it around his chest and legs in such a way that it had partially pulled his pajamas right off of him and rucked his sleep shirt up into his armpits.
? ” He insisted, somewhat breathlessly.
John had absolutely no objections when Sherlock tried the same area with his mouth. A hand to John's stomach soothed him enough to continue, though John breathing was becoming very erratic.
“I've been home for about an hour now, not that you noticed,” John started techily. Almost out of habit, he lifted his body up, slowly plodded into the kitchen, and started the kettle. Tea had always been John's remedy of choice for anything unsettling. He absently set out two mugs and went to the business of brewing tea for the both of them.
221B was a safe cocoon around them and perhaps it always had been. Even since the time when it had just been, “Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other,” and “How could you possibly know that?”
It was Captain Watson that actually answered the challenge.
John opened his eyes and was momentarily thrown.
Sherlock was dressed in one of his ridiculously fitted suits, sans jacket, just lounging there on the dream sofa, buttons nearly groaning in their buttonholes. The black silky fabric that was tautly pulled across his chest, rippled with every inhalation or really any movement Sherlock made at all. He was staring at John, eyes at half mast. Intense and intimate, like a great cat, feigning sleep to survey his hunting grounds before him, prey already targeted.
“Fine, Sherlock. Whatever. But believe me, you were doing more in that dream that having a tea party. Now I'm going to bed. YOU clean up for a change.”
Sherlock's heart raced frantically. He may have whined a bit plaintively before he could cover his eager expression.
tell you,” Sherlock all but growled at him. “Yes to ALL those things. YES.”
“You know how I loathe to repeat myself. I
Sherlock pulled John into a fierce embrace. He took his turn lifting his head towards the stars before meeting John's dark, colour-rimmed eyes.
“So glad you have caught up, John,” Sherlock gave him a scathing glace while rolling his eyes heavenward.
“Explain.”
What. The. Fuck.
Blondie fidgeted wildly and stage-whispered to Hamish. “There's people out here - did anyone hear that?” She looked around nervously at the two or three early appointment patients.
-----
“Sure, sure,” John eyes softened. I'm still more upset about my stethoscope, if I'm honest than all the other goings-on from today. What does that say about me really?”
“Oh, he's been searching
“And what of me? She had no desire to, 'size ME up’?” The faint pout was apparent on the detective’s full lips as he crossed his arms across his chest mulishly.
Another flash of dream memory set upon him. Syllabub. They had tea and scones and a sinfully delightful lemon syllabub swirled with raspberry jam. Sherlock knew how much John enjoyed the fruity jam, so he always endeavored to include it in meals and treats as much as he was able to for him. Raspberries and John just went together. Just like tea and sunshine and the smell of damp wool and the faintly sweet and lingering scent of green herbs and the citrus tang of bergamot…
“Hold that thought,“ he distractedly waved at John as he scribbled intently in the little book.
Perhaps he wasn't really a morning person.
Fascinating
John offered the bag to Sherlock, who immediately started rummaging through the contents. John then took the opportunity of the brief distraction to wander off into the kitchen to put kettle on. The rustling bag sounds abruptly stopped in the sitting room and alarm bells went off in the military man's head. Silence was usually not  such a golden thing in 221B. He knew this MUCH too well.  He craned his neck to see if he could spot the cause of the lack of noise on Sherlock’s part. The detective had abandoned the bag carelessly at his feet and was carefully scrutinizing a folded slip of white paper that he had discovered inside.
He had awoken loose-limbed and content even though he belatedly realized he wasn't in his bed. He could have sworn that he had collapsed in his room sometime during the night, but apparently that memory was faulty.
Hamish, as casually as he could, ambled into the kitchen after he had been listening at the slightly opened door while Sherlock and Sarah were discussing the day's events. He was admittedly puzzled at catching Sarah telling John's flatmate about his dinner plans for the evening and his intentions.
“The carton in the fridge,” John said carefully, as if to a sugared-up five year old.
They collapsed on to each other in satisfied, exhausted oblivion.
He pulled Sherlock's face up between his hands and crushed their mouths together. Sherlock melted into his body and dropped his weight completely into John's lap.
He never heard Sherlock's whispered reply.
His entire body blossomed and soared with heat. His fingers itched for a stronger purchase on the tweed coat and he grappled Sherlock closer. John felt him release a painfully held breath into his mouth and finally began to respond in John's arms.
John flushed with the praise. He tried to hide his response by thrusting a spoon into Sherlock's hand and gruffly muttered that he should eat more and talk less.
Hamish stared at it in his hands.
John pulled out the box of tea bags and deposited them on the counter. He stopped to scratch his head and stretch his neck a bit. He then filled the kettle and switched it on.
I...I would like to. I would really like to. I've wanted to for so long. Sometimes it's all I can think of how much I'd like to...just...you. And me. We. I'd like to. To slowly, over and over. I'd like to by the fire light. I'd like to on the table where we take our tea. Just softly. I'd like to. Just we. I'd like to. To gently...if you let me. Deeply. To just...mmmm. To hear it spoken softly. To say...to say...softly. I'd like to. I'd like to give...and take. To yes oh god yes. I'd like to. Would you. Would you like to?
This is a rather massive hulk of a chapter, folks. I couldn't help it.
John released his grip on Not Sherlock instantly as if he was that broken curling iron that Harry left in the bathroom one time when they were kids. He still had a bit of a scar on his palm as a reminder and strangely enough, right now, it burned. They hovered there for a moment, each deep into the other's personal space, chest to almost chest. The stranger blinked in a stunned manner and then his face morphed into a beautiful smile. His lashes coyly dropped and then raised again, half lidded to meet John's gobsmacked look of stupefaction.
Sherlock then took in John's general countenance.
John snapped back to attention.
Oh, please please, ahhh, now… so close…
Either way, he needed to retreat NOW.
“Sure, sure,” John capitulated. No harm in that, he justified.
you LEFT it somewhere? You've had that thing forever and literally trained yourself to keep it at your fingertips. Did you dump the supply bag out completely? It's a rather large one, you know.”
Pride coursed through Sherlock's body triumphantly and that awakened inner beast surged forward hungrily.
John rummaged through a drawer in search of a corkscrew.
“We could go to my room. The bed is bigger.”
“Mrs. Greene?” A heavily pregnant woman with another child hanging off her hip and other assorted dangling baby accoutrement, waddled up and followed Hamish down the hall. He could hear them faintly as they walked further away from the waiting area.
He MUST have inadvertently fallen asleep on the sofa after all. Sherlock was still faintly puzzled as to how he felt so agreeable now after waking in such an awkward position.
John tilted his face up to touch his lips gently to Sherlock's. Sherlock leaned into the touch and responded with a slide of his hands into the short blonde strands of John's hair and a soft, rapturous moan into his mouth. They kissed just for the pleasure of feeling their bodies close and warm for a few languorous moments.
An immediately recognisable baritone growled from the depths of the living space.
John was magnificent. Thick in girth and hard and jutting upwards, curved towards his stomach. As Sherlock stared in naked lustful admiration, an opaque drop of precome oozed from the head and Sherlock unconsciously licked his lips and shivered. He couldn't help but say that first thought aloud.
“No, I, well, NO. It was cruel of you. Really it was. Toying with him like that,” John stammered embarrassingly. He felt his tongue swipe quickly over his lower lip of its own volition. Sherlock's eyes followed it and his own cupid-bowed mouth parted like he wanted to join it.
“We finally have a replacement for Nurse Josephine in this morning,” Sarah casually remarked as she tidied up her cup and proceeded to get up to begin her shift. “I'll introduce you later on. Seems to be quite popular with the natives already.” She suggestively waggled her eyebrows at him as she slid by. “Catch you later, John.”
Hands that were already clutched around Sherlock's back, wandered quite purposely to the lush arse that was pushed into his lap. John grabbed a handful through the thin pajama bottoms and
YES.”
Sherlock was actually FIXING this? Well. That certainly called for a celebratory cup of morning tea.
Wait. What?
Naturally.
Sudden peripheral awareness flooded his overtaxed senses. John was, in an uncoordinated fashion, trying to peel the rogue bottoms and from his body. The sound of ripping fabric filled the air and finally, Sherlock was divested of the vexing clothes and John's hands were pressing harshly against his hips and groping his bare arse.
Her expression visibly softened. “Let's see what we can do,” she started. “You obviously didn't
She proceeded to tell him about her harrowing disaster of a date and Sherlock's role in the safe conclusion; their crazy lifestyle, the succeeding string of girlfriends that Sherlock shooed away, and John's propensity to leap to attention at Sherlock's slightest whim.
-----
John had to get out. Out of the sitting room, out of the flat, and breathe for a bit.
“You know, you were kind of a shit today with that groom, you know,” John snapped.
After a moment, John shook his head muzzily and looked up at Sherlock who seemed to be closer to him than he was when he first started talking. “What was that about a needing the right conditions  to grow a date palm? Is that what she wrote? You really are talking rubbish, I see...” The last syllable became a bit stuck in John’s throat as incredibly, he felt Sherlock's fingers graze his cheek gently before settling there. It was warm and comforting and yet almost electric. Oddly, there were no clanging alarm bells going off. John felt like it belonged there somehow. He looked up, confused, into Sherlock's eyes that seemed to be asking an unspoken question.
Oooooo....let the sexy times begin!!!!!  Mature, but not QUITE Explicit. (Oral sex/frottage)
“Y-yours, John?” Sherlock adorably stammered again. John rather liked him like this. He'd have to remember this tactic.
It seemed to be coming from the sofa.
“Lick,” he commanded Sherlock darkly, barely blue eyes meeting barely blue-green ones.
Sherlock roused to the sensation of John caressing his arms and back with obvious affection. He was chuckling a bit to himself and Sherlock had to know what he found so amusing.
John grimaced and tilted his head uncomfortably to the left. His trousers seemed a bit on the tight side.
John's eyes widened in alarm. There was no doubt that he had walked on his flatmate in the midst of a scorching-hot sex dream.
idea why humans want such a tenuous, fragile thing. But you. You became a
“All of that was just a few hours ago,” Sherlock whispered. “Are you sure John is alright? No injuries he was trying to hide? Stitches? Bruises? You know he hates making a fuss about himself.”
John let out a broken cry and crushed their mouths together. They couldn't get close enough, although Sherlock had already wrapped his legs around John's waist and was actively trying to push his way through John's body. Their erections met and slid and the friction was almost achingly unbearable.
“It says you are confident in your physical abilities and have quite the sentimental streak. C'mon, now. Are you
Sherlock smiled and watched John writhe as he encircled the rapidly tightening bollocks in turn and tugged gently.
John flailed for some sort of control of this situation. This was his dream, dammit, he should be some sort of guiding force.
Well, not really alone, seeing how the subject in question was actually in the room at the moment. Sherlock hadn't moved or even acknowledged that John had come home and was sitting right across the room from him. He was probably completely focused on redecorating some new niche in his Mind Palace.
“You are mine, dammit. I won’t have just anyone thinking they can have their way with you as easy as you please. It may have taken me awhile to see it and a small battle to admit it to myself, but I'm yours too, you know.”
Using the leverage in his legs and his hands on John's arse, Sherlock managed to switch their positions so now he was the one pressing down on John, nothing between them except for the flimsy material of his pajamas and the hardness of both of their now aching erections.
“Easy, there,” Sarah put her hands up in mock surrender. “I know you have a special place in your heart for Sherlock, but you have to admit he isn't the friendliest of sort. Definitely doesn't smile and put people at ease like Hamish does. He's a natural at his job, it seems. Gets along with everyone and certainly with
The girl looked hopefully at Sherlock.
“Hnnnngg….”
“I got us dinner, Sherlock,” John called out as he entered the flat and crossed into the kitchen to set everything down on the counter. “Wash up and I'll open this bottle to have with.”
The light that streamed softly through his curtains puzzled John as he blinked himself awake.
“You look positively radiant, Mrs. Greene. Can I take your baby bag? It looks terribly heavy. Allow me, please.”
Hamish set his drink down and toyed with the rim of the wine glass with a long, graceful finger.
“I just do. You are the most important person in the world to me and what I feel about you?  God, it's taken me SO damn long to get past the whole, ‘I'm not gay’ thing. I'm not. Not really. I'm not gay, or bi, or any sort of certain category or label.
“Ah, yes,“ he rumbled. “Just a moment, let me get my notes.”
“Ah, Angelo knows how much I adore this. He does not make it very often. The rosemary and garlic are at perfect counterpoint to the sweet notes of the yeast dough. Here. You must try some now while it is still at the ideal temperature.”
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's slim waist, and pulled him flush against his own body. Both men groaned in heady approval.
Sherlock pulled himself up in that completely graceful and boneless way of his and sauntered off to his bedroom.
“That’s sooo good...More now. But...but..Yesss...Oh, god, pleeease…”
The week passed slowly for John. He was uncomfortably aware of Hamish wherever he was in the clinic and was oddly put off by the obvious popularity he seemed to have garnished in the short time he had been there. Hamish was gregarious and flirty and didn't seem to care whether the recipient was male or female. John just wished he would stop seeing Sherlock in the tall man's appearance. Maybe not even that. Seeing someone that favored Sherlock so much outwardly and yet acted so warmly and obviously enjoyed any interactions with John was oddly frustrating.
“You know I am a genius, John. I know quite a bit.”
John wandered down until he circled and teased a rosy and very interested nipple. Sherlock couldn't hold back when John sucked it carefully between his teeth and flicked it mercilessly with his tongue. He squirmed and pushed his mouth into an almost white line with effort to stay silent.
Hamish insisted on talking as they walked.
The spell was dispelled when Sarah briskly trotted from her office to the front desk. She must have heard the disturbance over the phone in her office as well. She leaned heavily over the counter and eyed them both with frank disdain.
Sherlock was almost glad John had rushed away. The feel of his strong, competant hands on him, even innocently, was almost too intense. Almost. In his own defense, innocence could be debated at the end there perhaps. John had slowed the massaging to a virtual crawl until his hands had just rested warmly on the sensitive tops of Sherlock's thighs, fingers caressing them softly. He had mentally pleaded with John to trail his hands up just a little bit higher and then bring them together to meet each other right over the growing tightness in his trousers...
They had fallen asleep. Together. It wasn't uncomfortable. Not in the least. Sherlock lost himself in that thought. Curled up against John's body had been, well, extraordinary. Very much so.
Oh. Sherlock stopped. John had said that his Pashto was rusty. So. Another word mistranslated.
John stepped into Sherlock's body and put his hands gently on his waist.
Check.
Sherlock was euphoric - John was just as delicious as he looked and he moaned so beautifully under his novice mouth and hands. He realized belatedly how hard and desperate John's responses were making his own cock and he pushed the heel of his hand into it for a little relief and adjustment in his pajamas that were now a bit wet and stuck to him.
It was two £20 notes and a message.
“You see, I do admit that I neglected to label that specimen. I'm conducting an experiment on the direct effect of concentrated beta carotene on the human cornea in relation to ocular functionality and encroching presbyopia.
One of Sherlock's latest web tabs popped up to grotesque life. Oh, dear God. THAT was going to take a few nights to scrub from his nightmares. Medieval torture. Right. Note to self - Never suggest a Google search to a tall, infuriating arsehole when he doesn't GET a Monty Python sketch. That was just stupid on his own part. He should have just left to meet up with Lestrade instead of encouraging the berk to watch it with him before he headed out last night. It WAS rather miraculous that Sherlock had actually taken his suggestion, though.
John, still struggling with the corkscrew, turned at the smell, eyes closed, reeling slightly at the smell that he so keenly associated with his flatmate.
------
John patiently waited. He trailed his fingers in light circles over Sherlock's pectorals.  Privately he was sweating bullets. He desperately wanted Sherlock to say yes to pressing themselves together and rutting and tasting themselves into oblivion, but he still wanted Sherlock to know that this MEANT something to him. And he SO very much wanted it to mean the same thing to Sherlock.
Sherlock was playing the dutiful son - albeit in a mad scientist sort of way, but nevertheless, a boy looking after his mother.
John could physically feel the confusion on his own face as he helplessly goggled with his mouth hanging slightly open.
Sherlock raised a single eyebrow at him.
Just a little more of the knife drama...
“Yes,” Vida continued. “Easy to germinate, but requires meticulous hand pollination and precise measured watering to set fruits and then to have them mature and ripen. Insects and other pests can destroy an entire grove. But the palm will faithfully produce fruit and shade and life for many, many years with the proper conditions. You hold that seed in your hand, Mr. Holmes. Think of it as a heart. THE heart. The caretaker must be very passionate and vigilant about his date grove. Tend it wisely.
Vida returned home that afternoon. Her grandmother was at her usual place at the computer, fondly combing through back cases on John's blog. She lifted her head expectantly to her granddaughter. The younger woman just smiled. “You've still got it, Grandmother. The seed has already set root. Heavens, now you've got ME using your crazy heavy-handed horticultural analogies too.”
Sherlock squeaked at the touches to his lips and tried to rigidly weather this downright tactile assault from John as dignified as he could. They stared at each other for the eternity of a few seconds. Sherlock then quickly excused himself for the night, all but ran to his room, and slammed the door.
Trying to act cooler that he felt, he casually placed his hand on her arm as he passed and called out evenly, “Yeah, well, see you later on, right? You can stand me a pint.” He leered and winked at HER.
Sherlock, adorned in his dark blue dressing gown and pajama bottoms (no shirt, curiously enough), shrunk his deducing eyes to slits as he took in John's appearance from top to bottom and stopped at the shoes.
“ Ah,
When John returned home that evening, he was laden with bags. He had felt vaguely guilty for his rude exit from the flat this morning and very foolish at his body's own rogue reaction to last night's events.
“Tell him it's the heaviest I have,“ she smiled merrily and patted his hand as she guided him back up on his way.
Well. There were apparently quite a few things that Sherlock associated with John.
rescue.
Upon searching the Mr. White's bedroom, Sherlock had discovered the man was a collector of vintage scientific laboratory equipment and was an obsessively clean germaphobe. The first he could understand. The second is what could have possibly  killed him. While Sherlock was caught up in a moment of covetousness at the expanse of glittery glassware, John had wandered over to the bedside table where vase of garden flowers was arranged prettily. The doctor absently swiped at the table which was covered in a fine layer of dropped pollen. Sherlock, drawn to the sudden movement, saw the evidence of a previous hand through the messy yellow particles on the dark table, the contents of the vase itself, and immediately pounced on John, ripping his shirt up to cover his nose.
“John, you are mouth-wateringly exquisite,” Sherlock breathed reverently. “Please. ”His voice cracks slightly. “Let me taste you, I want the feel of you between my lips and in my mouth, oh, John, I want to so badly...”
“Is there, well, something between them then?” Hamish blurted out.
“Come out to the pub after work,” he cajoled. “It's been an insane week and we deserve it.” He smiled that 1000 watt American white-toothed smile and John found himself struggling to say anything but yes. He could use a pint and a bit of a wind down from the discombobulation of the past few days, even if Hamish was going to be there too.
“What DID your grandmother do in her village then?” Sherlock countered carefully, trying to level her with a frosty glare. Vida paused for a moment before she spoke. Sherlock could almost say she looked a tad embarrassed.
-  for the love of GOD,
He stirred again and was rewarded with the warm, heavy weight of his blankets as they  resettled themselves around him amidst the comforting presence. John sighed after a deep inhale and drifted back into sleep.
“Jesus, Sherlock,” John softly bit into an earlobe that dangled temptingly right by his lips. “Lord help me, I wanted to do this slowly; take our time, be considerate. But you are are
It wasn't a quiet night at 221B. It rarely was anymore. Mrs. Hudson had sound-dampening insulation put in as a Christmas gift to all of the Baker Street inhabitants. Sleep was had eventually and dreams were usually good ones.
“We go in, love,” John answered simply. He took out his key, unlocked the door and held it open.  Sherlock followed a bit hesitantly.
Dammit. Why did this sort of thing always seem happen to him? The old adage, “Nice guys finish last” seemed to be his own personal bad luck tag-line. His heart just wasn't in this anymore.
“Let's make sure it isn't too hot for you, Sherlock.”
under most of John's body.
“Why are you doing this? This isn't like you, Sherlock,” he leaned his head back away from the looming one in front of him. “Why would you care about my thoughts about how you manipulate people for your own gain?”
“We had a visitor,” Sherlock quietly intoned from his chair in a deceptively neutral manner.
“What do we
Sherlock gaped at Sarah when she came to the end of the story.
Mr. Chamberlain was one of those patients that bounced from clinic to clinic with vague symptoms of pain - his lower back, migraines,joints, whatever he could say to convince the medical staff to prescribe him pain meds for him. They had identified him as a pain medication addict fairly quickly and tried to refer him to the proper channels that could address his problem and give him the help and support he needed.
Of COURSE Sherlock was home. John had stupidly neglected to notice the closed bathroom door.
John pulled on his jacket, and bid the staff good night. He headed out towards the Tube station in deep study. His thoughts kept going back to the cryptic words Sarah left him with before he left the clinic.
Well then. Apparently his subconscious self wasn't afraid of asking for what it wanted.
“Oh, no. No, no,” the dark haired man chuckled. “Just me and you. Thought it would be good for us to get away from everything and just talk, be comfortable. Without distraction.” Hamish leaned in a bit with that last statement. “Don't know if that part is working though.You are even more distracting now than at the clinic.” He leaned in a even further towards John till their shoulders met for a moment before he pushed playfully away.
“H-hamish, huh? Um, I'm a Hamish too. Family name,” the doctor stammered out a little too helpfully and ran a hand quickly through the close-cropped hair at the nape of his neck.
John groaned into Sherlock's mouth, but held fast.
“I have a thought. It has been quite the day for both of us - in more ways than I can even
Sherlock ran his palm incredulously down John's cheek. His tremulous face split into a rapturous smile as he blinked his eyes rapidly.
He had resolved to firmly ignore it all and simply venture forth. What purpose could it possibly serve? He had gotten some Italian takeaway from Angelo's and a couple of bottles of wine that were inexpensive enough, but still drinkable. Hopefully Sherlock wouldn't fixate on that and just eat.
“Yours if you want, Sherlock. I do. If that's what you wanted too, I'm right there.” John stroked the thumb at Sherlock's jawline and felt him lean into his touch.
Sarah was clearly astounded by Sherlock's confession. This wasn't the sociopath she had seen manipulate and coerce without care except for furthering his own causes. He was actually concerned that John was distressed and repentant of his part in causing that. She had never seen Sherlock like this - so human and even caring about John’s feelings. She actually felt bad for him, even though he had brought this upon himself. She was tempted to just tell him to man up and give it back to John and take his punishment. But something in Sarah had shifted. She saw Sherlock in a way she hadn't before and right there, she decided she would help him.
?, Sherlock. I'm really not feeling all that well right now, just tell me,“ John weakly began, as he looked up at him further.
“I'm still asleep, dammit,” he mockingly groused. “I got you coffee, though I wasn't sure what you might like to eat or if you had any restrictions. It's cream, no sugar, right?”
Had Sherlock gone to shops of his own volition? He felt a shiver of excited anticipation race through him.
“Ooh, John. Tiramisu. You ARE a prince among men, you know.”
John knew that he should be on guard with such an abrupt change in topic, and the stare,  but he couldn’t pinpoint exactly why THIS line of questioning could be potentially dangerous. What did HE know though. Idiot, right?
Sherlock lifted his chin haughtily and stormed out in high dungeon.
The front door opened carefully and it became apparent that the police had arrived. An Armed Response Unit member walked slowly in, his hands raised and cautiously pointing to the ceiling. He made an obvious display of being empty-handed. He called out to Mr. Chamberlain that he was going to help him, he just needed him to put the knife down and stay where he was. No one would hurt him, he just needed to take a deep breath and…
“Both of us seem to have a great affinity for the sense of smell. We find it pleasing and comforting and even arousing.”
“Good morning, John,” she blandly remarked, sipping a weak cup of tea and finishing up a muffin.
It had been a few weeks and he was back. The first appointment of the day, Seven fucking o’clock in the morning. John had been irritated to have the early shift that morning, but what can you do? Same complaints, but now with a definite edge to them and to the patient. John watched the man for a few moments as he took notes.
“Idiot.” Sherlock leaned in and kissed him deeply again.
John nearly dropped the laptop as if it had been dipped in bubonic plague. Did HE write this? Or better yet, WHY did he write this? What was all this “I'd like to???” And addressed to Sherlock? It was as if someone had hijacked his brain, held it at gunpoint, and forced him to type out THAT. That absolutely ridiculous, contrived and somewhat incoherent drivel.
“Ah, that,” Sherlock grimaced for just an moment and then beamed beatifically at him. “You are always going on about how I finish the milk, so, um, there you are.”
That decided it. Sherlock was never one for not knowing things. Particularly things in his own head. He grabbed John's blanket for warmth (though it seemed to be a bit smaller than he than had recalled in times past), breathed deeply, closed his eyes, and opened the door to his Mind Palace.
The dark, ruffled-haired head turned in his direction, looked him slowly up and down and two words came out of his mouth in a low, resonant timbre that John could almost feel in his bones. The voice had the ability to cut right through him with scalpel-like efficiency and then lay him to waste effortlessly. It always had.
Sherlock snuggled back into John's arms and they both dozed, the scent of their bodies together heavy and calming to them both.
John proudly marched off down the hallway, so confident in his little act of swagger that he failed to see Sarah's look of confusion and faint words of, “Later on?”
Sherlock vaulted over the arm of his chair and strode quickly to the bathroom. He snatched the bottle from the shelf in the shower and flipped open the lid and inhaled.
“Who are you seeing today?” the girl shot back nervously.
Sherlock's face took on slightly bored and irritated expression. "The date palm,
Why had he never made that connection before? HIS body wash had a rosemary component to it, however blended with cardamom and lemongrass, that he had always found it soothing and sensual.

John cleared his throat uneasily.
, get up here right
“Maybe I'm your cock, John,” he breathed into John's mouth, so close, their lips nearly brushed as he said it. “The part that wants this so badly.”
“Hi, Sarah! So sorry to disturb you. I know John is busy now and I could use your assistance. I rather, erm,
“Am I not present enough, John? “ he chided with a smirk.
A faint warning bell went off in his head.
“You had an objection to the groom, John?” Sherlock began again carelessly.
Damn him.
Sleep finally won.
“So. Let's discuss why you have felt the need to bring us here tonight,” Sherlock began, his baritone register sounding even more rich and enticing than per usual.
“Please,” he roughly beseeched Sarah. “Help me get it back to him without him knowing it was my doing. He just left too early and before I could return it. I had no idea he'd be so, well, bothered by it; that it meant so much to him. He'll be apocalyptically cross with me. I can't say I can blame him now.” Sherlock looked and sounded rather crushed.
“Yes,
“Sherlock, you complete and utter prat! Just because you have an official looking clipboard in your hand and are wearing doctors togs, does not mean you can waltz in here and take advantage of the new staff that haven't been warned about you! C'mon. Out. Why the hell are you here anyway? I'm WORKING.”
it. We are all getting tired of your bullshit.”
Sherlock relented. Hamish wasn't a menacing character, it would seem. That didn't mean he had to like him though. OR his accept his presence in John's personal life.
“Right. Because the universe revolves around you, Sherlock, not that you would know that, mind you, since you DELETED the whole thing. I was at WORK, you egotistical berk. Being productive, healing the sick, you know - doing my part for humankind,” John shot back testily.
“That good, huh?” smirked Hamish. They don't even have to pay. Better than being in the States. They get a free ride here. I brought 22 to 25 gauge needles. Maybe I should have brought a few big adrenaline needles for show and scare them into soiling their Depends?”
Finally done with dressing, John squared his shoulders, came down from his room and called out a quick goodbye to Sherlock as he closed the door and headed down the stairs and out into the street to the clinic.
Sherlock did the one thing John had always wanted to see him do with those fingers. He wrapped them around both of their cocks, enclosing them tightly and
Sherlock caught himself returning the look briefly. The man's accent had been exceptional and somehow it vexed Sherlock irrationally.
John startled at her words.
Again.
It was not a good day.
Sherlock felt his nipples tighten and become hard, flinty points.
John had rolled into his side and propped his head up on his hand via a bent elbow. He toyed with Sherlock's curls around his face and then buried his hand into his scalp and tugged gently.
“They've been locked in a careful orbit around each other for years, I think. If something was going to happen, it would have by now. Either that or they are just
The cream.
------
John keened long and low as Sherlock rubbed a circle onto his exposed cock with his flat stomach. Sherlock peeled back, eager to see and touch for himself.
Sherlock was unprepared for the power of his own reaction and very nearly howled at the sensation.
Sherlock rummaged carefully in the messenger bag and pulled out John's stethoscope. Sarah's face immediately changed. She look relieved and immensely pleased.
Sherlock actually cleaned away the dinner dishes and leftovers and then claimed the remaining tiramisu as his reward. He took the container and his spoon to the sofa to ruminate on the disconnected bits of information that he had gathered thus far. He rolled the creamy concoction around his mouth thoughtfully and softly smiled at his fondness for these sorts of desserts.
“تاسو ستاسو په لاس کې د زړه وکړي. د اوبو او ميلان لري او د خپل ځان د دا پروا او مينه به ستاسو د ميوه وي.”
-----
This was punctuated with both a 1100 watt Hamish grin and the ubiquitous Hamish wink. John found himself flushing a bit pink under the paltry influence of a half a glass of lager and the sheer force of the man's personality. He was noble on top of all of that. Selfless, wanting to right the world's wrongs with his knowledge and skills. The military and medical man in John suddenly felt that was a very attractive quality in a person. He rotated on his stool so he was facing the American and leaned in a little closer.
“You know where The Volunteer is right at the Baker Street station? Let's head there, you get a table, and I'll get clean shoes and meet you back.”
“You got distracted and stayed on the floor so long you compressed nerves and mucked up your circulation? Who is the idiot now?” He shook his head and went back to the task of heating the water for the bottle.
-----
Sarah reached in her box and pulled out a small black velvet jeweler’s bag with gold Chinese characters imprinted on it. A note was pinned to it.
“ما ښکل کړه."
Sherlock pulled his mouth from John's and glared accusingly at him, trying to get his breath back.
He was not in a good mood when he arrived home that evening to 221b.
Sherlock had begun to head down the hallway towards the exit and pivoted back towards the kitchen door. He realized it had been slightly ajar as he left. There was a lingering smell of a certain cologne.
Silently, they prepared for bed. Quiet gazes still passed between them and little touches were had every few moments, as if they were reassuring themselves that the other was still there. Sherlock changed into pajama pants, forgoing a shirt and John simply shucked everything except for his pants. They got into bed and without preamble, Sherlock turned onto his left side, into the crook of John's right shoulder and rested his head there, breathing in the smell of John's hair and his warm skin. No more of the torture of burning for this man, a breath away and yet so hesitant to inhale. They both had been really. Sherlock purposely took in a slow, deep breath of John’s proximity and let out a long, contented sigh as he brought his arm up to rest on the firm chest, just below John's scar. Fingers met him there and John's hand cradled them over his heart.
Sherlock had texted back.
Sherlock worked into the night. The message the old woman had given John perplexed him. Around 3:30 a.m., he discovered something potentially important. He had scanned the note and had a translation done directly from words on the paper. It gave him a slightly different translation than what John had. Where John had said 'life’, the word was actually ‘heart’.  “You hold a heart in your hands. Water and tend and care for it with your own, (John had left that part out) and love will be your fruit.” What sort of dull sentiment was this? Whose heart was John holding? Was this woman a threat to John? A stalker? Sherlock lay on the sofa placing his palms together across his chest, fingers gently resting underneath his chin. This required further study. An hour or so passed before he realized how much better he thought when John was nearby and touching him. Like tonight. The doctor's short, sturdy fingers tracing patterns on his thigh idly, as he watched the telly and Sherlock worked. It made things seem clearer. Brighter even.
John released the tender flesh and kissed it better after the rather rough treatment. “Mmmm, go ahead, sweetheart. Just let it go - I want to hear you; want to hear how I'm making you come apart, that you want more so damn badly and that it feels sooo fucking good…”
His entire upper body wrapped around one bare-chested Sherlock Holmes as he honest-to-god
John, in the same maneuver Sherlock had enlisted earlier, flipped their bodies over and ground himself onto Sherlock almost through the bed. Both men groaned their approval desperately.
Sherlock wanted John. He knew that now.  In all honesty, that was one of the final points, but it was a damned important one. He wouldn't have snuck upstairs and slipped into John's bed at well past 2am otherwise. It was surprisingly easy to cosy up to the sleeping doctor. John had actually done all the work, rolled over and tucked Sherlock alongside his body and flung a proprietary arm and leg across him. He knew the shower and the bath gel had been the right decision when John stuck his nose in the crook of his neck and licked a long swipe of that infuriating tongue of his from the top of his upper trapezius to just shy of his left mastoid process. It ended with a soft, open mouthed kiss there and a tug of the sensitive earlobe a few centimetres up. Sherlock had shivered violently and did everything possible to calm his body's reactions and sleep. And wait.
“A most cryptic, although flowery message. We cannot weather another 'fan’ like I was burdened with. That would never do for my faithful blogger to be put into danger.” He dragged his focus from the computer for a brief moment to lock his penetrating verdigris gaze on John's.
John stood in stunned amazement for a tick and then burst out laughing.
Sherlock did the unexpected. He reached out and grasped her forearms gently and bowed his head slightly and almost reverently. Momentarily stunned, Sarah simply watched him glide out of the kitchen.
Sherlock reached under the cushion and pulled out a slim journal.
Funny how his legs had suddenly become completely immobile. And that heat on his cheeks and ears was spreading. Then a faint twitching of his groin...
“'Morning, Sarah,” he carefully returned. Their relationship had been a tad strained after the events of their ill-fated date a while back. Almost getting a girl run through with a Chinese death escape device wasn't exactly the way to encourage future romantic endeavours. Well, at least not for
He had been edgy and manic and hadn't wanted to meet Sherlock's eye. He curtailed his usual morning ablutions and left hardly uttering a word. Fascinating.
John heard the rustling of cloth and thump of the table as he presumed Sherlock was rising and stepping on and over the table in an effrontery manner. Through the slits between his fingers, he could see that the tall, looming figure had stopped right in front of him.
Upon opening the box, John was suddenly enveloped in a cloud of dust and dried leaves. Tea dust and leaves to be exact. Every single tea bag had been stripped of its filter paper pouch and was now just a sad heap of dried plant matter at the bottom of the box.
Hamish turned that sloe-eyed grin John's way, and nudged his hip into the doctor’s.
“You're my cock?” John's eyes flew open only to slam shut again as Sherlock ducked his head to fasten his mouth on the pulse point on John's neck. He couldn't help the moan that escaped from his lips.
He smoothed his slicked hand down John's stomach and eagerly grasped his cock and stroked it firmly from root to tip.
-----
“Why do none of my clothes fit, you utter arse?? And why is Mrs. Hudson giving you thread?? What the hell are you on about THIS time? You’d better make this right, damn you!”
But how did it morph into the languid and almost sensual tone the letter took? John didn't see the his flatmate like that. How could he? This was Sherlock, for Christ’s sake. Good lord, DID he? John knew their relationship was more than a simple friendship. It always had been. Sherlock was his best friend, flatmate, the one that understood how he ticked, pushed his buttons, the life in his life. There wasn't anything John wouldn't or hadn't already done for him. In addition, the man looked revoltingly gorgeous in the modish clothes he swanned about in. The coat, the cheekbones.  Even HE had to admit that.
John approached him and put a hand on his shoulder in greeting and as a question to his presence.
He could hear Sherlock shifting to an upright position. He looked up to lapis eyes almost right in his face. His breath caught.
Sherlock cautiously backed away, not before he pressed the paper to John's cheek.
Sherlock grimaced at this conclusion and shook his head like he was shooing away a bothersome fly.
“You misunderstand, John,” Sherlock rumbled in his impossibly deep baritone tones. The finger on John's lip was simply intoxicating. John could hardly think as he sank into the sensation, feeling as though he was right on the edge of something. Something so very close…
people, he wryly thought to himself, trying not to think about Sherlock dashing to his, erm, he and
John headed into the clinic that morning just as he had countless mornings before. He endured the usual hustle and bustle in the Tube, a bit of spilled coffee on his coat as he plodded his way up the stairs, and then the short walk up to the clinic doors. There was a bit more chaos than the norm at the front waiting area today as he breezed by, but it was rather trial by fire here for new front desk personnel. Kill or be killed, keep order with the waiting queue, or be trampled by the masses. John somewhat uncharitably reflected that he was glad he got the crowd one at a time, in a timely fashion, instead of the lemming-like onslaught in which they arrived.
The detective opened the cabinet and handed the bottle to his rather agitated flatmate. John grabbed a glass, poured two fingers into the tumbler, and knocked it back ruthlessly. Sherlock winced in sympathetic pain as John spluttered a bit before he marched right in front of him and stopped to glare up at his face.
Sherlock genuinely looked pained when he spoke again.
Sherlock breezed over to her and clasped her arm in a friendly manner. She startled for a moment before Sherlock hurriedly smiled his calculated, “Just relax, I'm a harmless, toothless old crocodile,” smile at her.
“Let me try that again. Come sleep
John closed his eyes and an embarrassingly loud moan made its way from his lips.
“I've been following Dr. Watson's blog. The adventures seem like something from a James Bond movie sometimes. I didn't know people could really be like that! He lives for that, doesn't he? He has a great deal of respect for you, you know. You can tell in his writing.”
He sure as shit was awake now.
Sherlock was nearly vibrating in excitement. He kissed John intensely for a moment and then swirled all his fingers down his torso languidly.
Hamish found a note written in French sitting on top of the fine tissue paper that lined his box.
The truth was, after getting no response from John on his mobile and rejecting calling in a favor from Mycroft, an admittedly, ahem, concerned Sherlock attempted to distract himself by dipping into his Mind Palace to have a conversation with John there. Peripherally, he was aware that he had knocked some of his hair samples on the floor. Somehow, as he knelt down to get them, the Mind Palace room shifted to the pool scene. He found himself kneeling in front of John, ripping the semtex vest off of him again and again and again, but no matter what he did, the explosives went off every time. Only when John had walked into the sitting room in the actual flat did the image fade and Sherlock had slumped in relief.
“Oww!” interjected Sherlock unhelpfully.
He loved Sherlock. He always had. It didn't matter if he was gay, or bi, or whatever - it was whatever people called themselves that simply loved each other.
Fueled by John's climax, he teetered at the very peak and then crashed over the other side with a piercing bellow.
John lifted his head reluctantly and tended to one last detail. He pulled Sherlock's ruined pajamas to them and cleaned them both off as well as he could in his feeble state.
Ow. Shit.
Sherlock attempted to stand to berate John a bit more for his inattention, when his legs gave out and it was only the doctor's quick intervention that prevented him from hitting the floor. John hauled him up, wrapped his arms around the immobilized detective, dragged him over to his leather chair, and gently sat him down. He bent to his own knees and began carefully palpating Sherlock's numb thighs and calves.
“They do, don't they?” John countered. “Just like killing a man threatening someone that person had just met? Dropping everything when they text, or jumping on a madman's back so that person could get to safety? All gut reactions, Sherlock. Don't you see, it's always been you. Always been you for me. I just wouldn't allow myself see it.”
“John. What do we do now?” Sherlock softly questioned.
“Ah. So the groom today, hmm?” Sherlock brushed a bit of imaginary fluff from his trousers idly. John's eyes couldn't help but trail down the impossibly long legs to follow the motion of those nimble fingers. Dammit. He was doing that on purpose.
A weird sense of premonition swept over John, not unlike the certainty he used to feel right before a bomb raid. In his mind's eye, he almost saw the Swiss Army knife before the agitated man pulled it from his pocket and flicked it open to the largest blade.
There was no one else from the clinic in the pub. Just he and Hamish.
me. That was the part that I never could see happening. But in there. Tonight. You said you regretted not letting that moment happen that night in the hall. Or at Angelo's. That you wanted it too, but couldn't. I'm such a coward for just not doing it myself then. Lord knows I wanted to too.”
-----
John shivered at the words and the sensation of heat rippling off of Sherlock’s looming form. Directly behind him. Nearly pressed up against him, right there behind him. He gripped the countertop tightly and tried to screw his eyes shut to block the cascade of images that now ran unchecked through his brain.
'Yeah, I kinda noticed that a while back,” John entoned, his voice silky and low.” It does things to me. Has for awhile, if I'm honest. Especially on you. ”
The fragrance that wafted up from the mostly warm liquid in his cup triggered something as he frowned in concentration. This was John’s usual morning Earl Grey. He typically only made it for himself as Sherlock preferred a heavier blend or coffee upon rising.
“Finally, John. That was rather unlike you to fall asleep on the sofa and be so difficult to rouse so early in the evening”.
Neither man lifted a hand from the other for the rest of the night.
With the slicked palm, John grasped both of their shafts tightly together and stroked them down.
John took in a deep breath and slowly released it. It was something he employed quite frequently in Sherlock's company. It kept him from actions he might later regret against his flatmate; his messy murder or perhaps pushing him hard against one of the Victorian papered walls, crowding his body up against Sherlock's, pulling his face down to meet his, lips fleetingly touching…
John’s expressive face did at least three or four different things at once and they all battled for dominance in their display. He looked both embarrassed and angry and rather flushed all at once. There was also a hint of, “Oh, God, why do we have to do this NOW,” about him. It was disturbing, but nonetheless, rather impressive.
It tasted as sumptuous as it smelled. Yeasty and sharp, with the tang of the garlic and the damnable rosemary.
He couldn't help closing his eyes and smiling.
Sherlock settled back into the sitting room upon the sofa and proceeded to stare at John. It was unnerving. He could never REALLY tell if it was him being stared at or just in John's general direction.
John ceased to breathe. His mind went staggeringly blank and with an inhuman grunt, he tried to haul Sherlock up on top of him and lunged for his mouth.
Sherlock moaned as he tried to straighten his legs out. He had been sitting on his heels for the better part of an hour waiting for word from John and for his supplies. Once he had them, he would be able to wrap up the salon murders he had been working on that night. Lestrade thought he was SO amusing with that one. Like Sherlock would have some sort of inside information about the life of hairdressers, just because he took SOME pride in the appearance of his own coiffure.
Sherlock ducked his head sheepishly then tried to meet her eyes bashfully. The gesture seem to knock his age down ten years.
Deirdre nodded a shaky
“You know I don't hear you when I'm not actually here, you great cracking idiot,” John muttered sourly. “What the hell were you doing on the floor anyway?”
John would surely give the case a ridiculously sensational name in his blog. He shuddered at the depths that his flatmate might go to with this one.
John HAD to get out. He made a hasty retreat after a rather contrived glance to his watch and a “Oh, I'm late for my first patient, GottaGoBye.” As soon as he rounded the corner away from the supply room, he slumped his back against the cold walls of the hallway and blew out a shaky breath.
Inside was a beautifully carved jade hair clip. Sarah flushed slightly as she let her fingers trace over the intricate curls and filigree of the piece. Her insides warmed as she reread the message.
“I know JOHN is busy now, but would Sarah, I mean, DR. SAWYER, be free for just a moment? I just have something brief I need to discuss with her.”
John felt rooted to the spot.
John's mouth was unbelievably soft, warm, and so, so good at this, Sherlock could hardly contain his exponentially expanding impulses; they were taking over his brain’s ability to catalog and function logically. He gave up trying deduce John's movements, simply groaned louder, nipped John's lower lip, and sucked it between both of his own.
“John..John...ohhhh. I can feel that
. I've found the person I want to be with forever that happens to be a man. Happens to be YOU. Beautiful, stunning, unbelievably brilliant, and madding YOU. It took meeting someone that looked so much like you, who was attentive, and so obviously attracted to me for me to actually
“Let's go home.” John reached for Sherlock's hand and Sherlock quietly slid his fingers into John's. They turned to look at each other, which morphed into the complete inability to tear their eyes away. They both realized at the same time that this was
had to be the one to bridge the gap, to stop acting like a blind, scared idiot. I love you, Sherlock Holmes. I can say that now. Say that to you, and mean it so much. Please forgive everything it took to get me here. But I'm here now and I hope you can be too.”
“I was occupied,” Sherlock purred from the other room. More cat comparisons. Stupid brain.
The flat, upon entering, was dark and strangely still. John stopped to sigh and breathe in the comforting smell of home. Whiffs of formaldehyde, tea, Indian takeaway, rosin, burnt toast, and a hint of rosemary and soft musk all assaulted him like an over-eager fifteen year old boy with a can of pheromone body spray.
“Rest, baby,” he murmured into Sherlock's skin and leaned into him. “Just for a little while.”
Sherlock's eyes bolted open almost painfully and with a thumping of a nearly tachycardic heartbeat in his chest.
The meal went down beautifully. The pasta was lovely and the wine complemented everything with its simplicity. John felt mellow and much more content with the world in general afterwards. Sherlock actually ate a good portion of his meal and most of the bread. John rose to grab the last box that he had kept hidden from Sherlock.
Later interviews with the gardener would reveal that he had only put flowers in the arrangement, no greenery, and that Mrs. White was an avid orchid collector. She had amassed a rather sizable collection in a specially built conservatory on the first floor of the main house that she allowed no one entrance to. It was from those shears that Sherlock isolated the Taxus baccata pollen and sap from the yew stems that Imogene had cut with her scissors and tucked into the fateful flower posey. All that was left for a big insurance payout was to let time and her fussily clean husband do their work.
“It's funny. Rosemary is supposed to be for remembrance - my gran always said that,” John mused. “Well, I for one won't ever forget this, you magnificent git.”
John fumbled to reach the pull on the drawer of his bedside table.
He grabbed Sherlock's shoulders and bodily slammed his back hard into the cushions along the wall. Sherlock's pupils had blown almost completely black from just that. He surveyed John greedily before him as John straddled his hips, effectively trapping Sherlock between his legs and beneath him.
Why were you kneeling for so long?” John huffed, trying act causally scolding. “Do you know where the hot water bottle is? I'm going to do that up for you to loosen up your muscles.”
. One that rarely fell from the detective's mouth, followed by his own name, did it for irrevocably for John. He arched and every muscle in his body tightened. He hastily wet his other hand and pumped the two of them with both hands as Sherlock raised to meet him with an uncoordinated thrust of his hips.
John crossed his arm defensively and felt the unmistakable sensation of a seam ripping.
John hardly slept at all that night. Every time he felt himself drifting off to sleep, he would find his hand drifting down towards the drawstring of his own pajamas, the sounds of Sherlock’s moans echoing in his head.
Sherlock, unable to sit still, threw his leg over John's, straddled his hips, and pushed into John's chest firmly. The momentum thrust the two of them against the headboard of the bed and the surge of the sudden impact took both of their breaths away for a brief, frozen crystalline moment in time. Sherlock let out an approving “
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably and cleared his throat to force the image to dissipate. “I hadn't realized it had been so long. I was working at the table with the hair swatches,and a draft blew them on the floor. I suppose I got, erm, d-distracted picking them up.”
me. Just sleep, I mean. I feel like I really don't want to be without you all night. It really seems a bit pointless for us to march off to our separate rooms at this point,” he smiled almost painfully and ducked his head slightly.
“So, then. Erm. Tell me more about yourself then. What's an American nurse doing in a NHS clinic in Central London?” John was pleased he got back on track again and his head out of thoughts of Sherlock. It seemed the man filtered his way through John's existence like osmosis. Ever pervasive and persistent, thy name is Sherlock Holmes.
“That you are, love. More than you know.” John let Sherlock rest against his chest and ran his fingers through the tousled curls.
“Thanks for the cream, mate,” John chirped over the edge of the folded paper. “Really hit the spot.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John had never felt like a bigger jerk. He saw the hurt and the anguish permeating throughout Sherlock's entire body and rushed in for triage.
Sherlock was aghast.
Sherlock stood mutely for about 15 minutes on the spot. The note was for him? HE held John's heart? How? All the tripe about caring and nurturing the palm was sentimental foolhardiness - what would come of it? John didn't look at him in that way. Did he? Could he? The tall, brooding man sank into his chair in heavy contemplation for the rest of the afternoon and hardly stirred until John returned home that evening.
Feverishly, he slid his hands down to push the bedsheet out of the way of the tempting swell of John's arse.
Oh, fucking hell, yes,
Sherlock forcibly extricated himself from the kiss after a moment. “Y-you
“Keep your arms right there and don't move them,” John growled in his ear.
“Tell me about your clients today, John, “ he sharply inquired as he pinned John with one of his interrogative glares.
Damn him.
He goggled at John incoherently. He might have moaned a little.
Sherlock feigned appreciation. “I know where -  Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Please do,” he caught himself and allowed Hamish to lead him back to the staff kitchen area.
Sherlock spent the remainder of the evening on the sofa, tirelessly combing the internet for who knows what. John turned on the telly mindlessly, and joined his friend on the neighboring cushion as the younger man absorbed information. At one point, John leaned over to have a look at the screen. He saw tabs filled with maps of Pakistan and Iraq and Iran, Middle Eastern language sites, even an essay on women's social roles in rural post WWII Afghanistan. He sniggered quietly to himself and patted Sherlock's leg, as it was smashed up against his own, in a friendly manner, and went back to whatever idiocy Jeremy Clarkson had been up to.

They pulled apart and John brought his hand up to stroke Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock realized he had been holding his breath. Sarah stealthily returned, shutting the door behind her. It stubbornly popped open a touch, but she paid it no mind.

“Shut it,” John admonished. “They came all the way up from Chatham to see me at the clinic. That was the first thing the granddaughter said. Her grandmother, without question, wanted to make sure that I was THE Dr. John Watson from the Army Captain’s blog. She would only see HIM. Apparently, she likes my stories. Well, our stories. It was like I had a groupie!”  He smiled.”Kind of nice, that,” John mused for a happy moment.

At that moment, the other nurse bustled into the kitchen, clearly on a search mission. She spotted Hamish and reached out to grab him.
John ducked his head and scraped his teeth across the sensitive erectile tissue closest to him. He sucked and swirled his tongue over it teasingly and released it with a gentle *pop*.
Sherlock came to an abrupt halt and turned awkwardly back towards John.
“John, you are being ridiculous. I distinctly recall dreaming about a picnic in a flower-covered meadow and having tea and scones and marmalade. YOU were even there,” he added with an accusatory shake of his hand, as if that made it all clear and above board.
“Ohhh, G-god yes, YES, YES, John! Oh please, please,
I had such a grand time tinkering with this tale - it went from a one shot to a multi-chapter Not So One Shot deceptively quickly. Thanks, TCEW!
