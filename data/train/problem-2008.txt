“My landlady,” Sherlock corrected. “She fancies herself an adoptive mother, but not my housekeeper.”
“Sherlock!” Greg rises from his chair and glares at the taller man. He is not at all surprised at the insubordination, nor is Mrs. Hudson - Sherlock Holmes has spoken his mind since day one - but he is typically more diplomatic with the team’s owner.
“Something like that. I was an assistant coach because I hadn’t coached formally before, and I was so young. No one was about to give me my own team,” Sherlock corrects. “Mrs. Hudson took a big chance making me head coach at 28.”
As always, these questions only touch the surface of all you could be asking. Feel free to put voice to more. I'm all ears. In the meantime, please be patient with me for the next chapter. I promise I’ll get things back on schedule. Thank you all so much for your love and support. I love each one of you and you all being joy to my heart. I'm so glad to have the opportunity to continue sharing this with you.
What is going to happen?? Will John remember everything? Will John and Sherlock confess their feelings?
“Shh,” the doctor shushes him, squeezing his hands. “You knew that wouldn’t happen. You had Greg in the water. You knew he’d find me.”
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock answers. He watches John eat a bite of his salad and decides to push his luck. If John is asking him about his past, he may as well do the same. It may not be the best move, but he is willing to take the risk of revealing more of his deductions to learn even more about John Watson. “You’re an only child.”
“Yes. Let me show you,” Sherlock turned his chin and looked out at the people around them. “Look at that woman at the bar.”
Sherlock studies John’s face carefully, gleaning it all from his features. He knows what happened next, but there is no way in hell he is going to let on. He straightens his middle finger again and touches John’s elbow gently. Instead of pulling away again after contact, Sherlock lets his fingertip remain against John’s arm, wishing the doctor had worn a short-sleeved shirt.
“I can’t deny that Griffy vouching for him doesn’t lend credence to that, but I would like to have met him first,” Greg says carefully. “Asked him some of my own questions. Maybe had the opportunity to factor into the decision.”
Jammer - the skater who skates around the track and aims to pass all of the blockers on the opposite team. A point is scored for each opposing team blocker the jammer passes.
John left him up there alone with those jackals. What have they done? Is Sherlock in the water too? They’ll never find him. Greg must have been under The Crown watching for John to go over or he wouldn’t have found him either. John had not sunk far before darkness overtook him.
5. Will Sherlock survive living with John and will he finally "be brave" and talk to him about his feelings?
Hello, friends. Not action-packed, but necessary for the next step. The image of Sherlock shelling peas came to me one day and I HAD to write it into the story. It was too hilarious and adorable a thought to just abandon. But I didn't feel he would necessarily do it willingly. Hence, John using Sherlock's own manacles. Tee hee hee.
John opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. There were so many things John wanted to say and could give voice to none. The words just hung there in his mind and refused to become the sentences he needed.
...And stick around for the next chapter. I'm trying to get them out a bit faster after the long dry spell.
“His flashlight,” John amends with a laugh. “It was so dark and my lungs were on fire and I saw this light. For a second, I thought it was light from ‘the door to heaven’. That’s what my grandmother always said.”
Sherlock sighs. His resolution to steer clear of romantic entanglements is in tatters. It faded before his eyes the moment he met John Watson and his heart did it whole-heartedly without even consulting him. Sherlock knows he should be furious with himself, but instead he feels delighted and almost refreshed. Happier than he has felt in some time, if he is honest. He is just as mystified by that and he is by John himself.
“Her ankle may be broken too,” he replies after gently squeezing one last time. “I need an x-ray. Could be sprained, but I’d say broken.”
Happy reading, y'all and thank you for your continued love and support. Hope you love this Part too!
“And my doctor,” Sherlock ignores the interruption, “you are obligated to help me relax, by your own admission.”
“What?” John asks and then raises his brows in understanding. “Oh, no, no. He phoned just after I got back to my room, but I didn’t hear it in the shower. Then I fell asleep watching crap telly as soon as my ass hit the sofa. I woke up just a little while ago and saw the message.”
“Yes,” he answers without stopping to consider it. He has no need. He trusts John implicitly and he knows the feeling is mutual. There is no reason to delay any longer. There never was. “I have no real evidence of my suspicions.”
“So what do you do for the police?” John asked. It was a question of many, not all pertaining to what “consulting detective” meant, but it was as good a place as any to start. “What does a ‘consulting detective’ do?”
Sherlock visibly jumps at the thought, startled by his raw desire for John. He jerks his hand away without meaning to and the doctor’s smile is gone when he looks at him.
Sherlock watches John in fascination. There is absolutely no sense of superiority or condescension in his tone or manner. If anything, John seems almost dumbfounded by his own intelligence. It is both charming and odd. He is in a position to have become an incredible asshole and yet, he is friendly and unassuming. Sherlock wonders at how John’s parents kept him grounded. They must have been good people indeed.
Sherlock feels numb. He watches John reach for the doorknob and then something in his mind explodes. His hand juts out abruptly and he touches John’s arm.
Sherlock stares at her cooly. He runs a few scenarios in his mind palace as she continues to curse in a steady stream, becoming more and more creative as she goes. A second later and his eyes are focused again.
“How did you… You see people, right. How do I keep forgetting that?” John smiles and then winces when he moves his arm.
“Okay,” John’s tongue darts across his lips and it is all Sherlock can do not to look at them, not to even glance. “What suspicions?”
A wide grin instantly spreads across the coach’s face. Given the fact that John said he had never loved anyone he dated in the past, using the word so freely now and in this context makes Sherlock’s heart swell. He should not dare to hope; John truly cannot promise their relationship will be any different. Even so, Sherlock cannot help himself because maybe, just maybe it means John will realize his true feelings for him.
Hello again, friends. This chapter isn't action-packed adventure by any means, but things you all need to know. Trust me on that.
“Evening,” John answers just before losing his grip and clutching at the side, pulling himself tight against it in an effort not to fall.
And now, on a personal note...I want to thank my new, and official, beta MyBreadAndButter for all of her hard work and advice. She has helped make this chapter and the last the best they can be. She stresses my out, but also makes me think about my characters in all new ways and I love it. She is truly my bread and butter. What? You didn't think I'd make a lame joke about that? Do you know me at all? 😂 Yep. Had to throw that in too. You know, I protest the fact that there is no Deadpool emoji. I want a Deadpool emoji. Am I right?
"Not just any rooftop. This one is special for us. All three of us. The building where your trusted doctor shot my worker bee."
* When will John talk to Sherlock and what will he say? (Is this the "I don't think we can be together anymore" conversation? AHH! Hearts breaking)
Angelo pulls John along as they introduce themselves to one another. Sherlock follows in silence. He rolls his eyes once John’s back is turned and brings a hand to his face, pinching lightly between his eyebrow and cheekbone. He drops the hand quickly and grins, trying to look nonchalant when John looks back at him suddenly. Angelo presents them with a candle and bottle of wine after they are seated at a quiet table in the corner. John has a wide grin on his face while the man fusses over them and Sherlock becomes the focus of that smile once Angelo has gone.
“Yeah,” John replies with not just a little affection in his voice. “Something like that. Can you trust me?”
I am constantly blown away by all of you and I want to extend my thanks for all the love and support. All the comments and kudos and bookmarks on both parts always bring a smile to my face and a skip in my step. You all keep me going and make me love writing even more. Thank you from deep in my heart. I love you all.
Once the film was over, Sherlock knew he would never willingly part with it. He felt a certain kinship with the Grinch. Badly hurt in his past, unwilling to let it happen again, shutting out people and feelings, a single friend by his side. He has not mentioned how easily he can put himself in those shoes because Molly would just feel sorry for him, no doubt. She would also not appreciate being equated to Max, the dog and would staunchly disagree. She sees a side of him that no one else does. If they had not grown up together, he probably would have shut her out too. The changes in Victor and their divorce had hurt him so deeply, he did not think he would allow anyone but Molly into his life again. Then he met John and, just like with Cindy Lou Who, everything changed. He supposes John would also not appreciate the comparison.
“Oh,” John’s shoulders sank and his face fell as disappointment filled him. He scolded himself silently for just abandoning Sherlock on the dance floor without a word. My god, he was so stupid. John was certain by now that it looked like he was stalking off in a jealous rage. No doubt watching from afar only confirmed it when John got angry and snapped at Jim. Honestly, what the fuck had John been thinking? He had every intention of kicking Jim to the curb when he started across the dance floor and then with Moran there being all possessive and Jim doing his typical song and dance, John’s anger had gotten the better of him until he finally snapped out of it. ‘Be right back’. That was all he would have needed to clue in Sherlock, but John had just stomped off. Jesus Christ, he was an idiot.
Anyway, wherever you are, whatever you're doing, I hope this next chapter and all of the following being a little joy and distraction to each and every one of you. Sorry it's a bit short, but the next one is freaking long! It's taking me forever to type and edit. I can't wait to see what you think of it!
But enough about that, the bout with the Ravens is finally upon us! Instead of my usual snarky teasing, I know how disappointed you are (Ha!), I wanted to define a few terms again and explain one or two things.
“This is a hired bus and yet, you know the driver?” John replies, making no effort to hide his smile.
“There’s no one here,” John faces him, finally finished scanning his surroundings like a startled animal.
Billy leans close and stares into John’s eyes. John follows suit, anxious to hear Billy’s next words. Knowing the risks, how could this man keep such a secret?
Molly’s strategy and intellect closely match that of their coach, making them a perfect force to lead the team to its place as number one in the nation. It is a title the Detroit Rock City Rollers once held for ten years from the late 1970s into the 1980s. One the team’s owner never thought they would see again after The Fall. One they regained when they were revolutionized by a budding young coach called Sherlock Holmes.
John reaches for the apple and picks it up, setting his mug on the table as he does so. He looks at the bite that was taken and slowly rotates the shiny red orb in his hand. As the other side comes into view, small marks scratched into the fruit’s skin with a fingernail spell out words that make John’s heart go cold.  ‘I need you’.
Hi ho, Everyone! It’s been a rough week for a variety of reasons and just when stress was the highest, I got another curve ball. Gotta love that, not to mention your very own Cakey Jane using baseball metaphors. Gah! Has the world gone mad? Haha. Anyway, I’m hoping things get better and that you all like the chapter. It has also been a source of anxiety for me and I’m a little hesitant to post it. Any and all comments are welcome.
“You said the gunfire held them down. You would’ve been shot if you tried to get to him. Even if you had been right next to him, you may not have been able to control the bleeding. He may have still bled out.”
“That is what I’m suggesting, yes,” Sherlock confirmed, all seriousness and formality as though it was a business transaction. John felt a sudden tingling wave of anticipation envelope his body and he nearly shivered from the unexpected pleasure of it. He tried to keep the smile from being so wide as to give away his every thought, but knew he failed completely. To his delight, Sherlock mirrored his emotions as soon as he saw them on John’s face.
Their lips move together, even as their mouths remain closed. Sherlock feels dizzy. He has never felt so good or whole in his life. He finds John’s arms with his hands and holds on gently. John squeezes his shoulders and parts his lips just a crack. Sherlock immediately feels the humidity from his breath and lets out one of his own in a rush, like a moan with no sound. John kisses him with fervor. There are sighs into mouths, and across faces and lips. Though the kiss remains chaste, breathing grows heavier and faster. Motivated by blind desire, Sherlock tightens his grip on John’s arms and takes John’s bottom lip in between his own. He sucks lightly, eliciting a loud moan from John, and he nearly comes in his pants right then and there. Sherlock breaks away quickly, desperate to regain control. He drops his head back against the wall and takes in a shallow breath. John does much the same, leaning his head forward and resting his forehead on Sherlock’s chin. Sherlock swallows hard and then sucks in a harsh breath when he feels John’s gentle, incredibly warm lips on his throat. John is smiling against his skin. He brushes his lips over Sherlock’s Adam’s apple and then straightens his own neck, pulling away from the taller man. Sherlock lifts his head from the wall and looks down at John, into his eyes blown wide with want.
“Me too,” John replies quietly. A feeling of deep contentment slowly, steadily fills every inch of Sherlock’s body and his lips turn up. He feels lighter, tranquil, and like he was never meant to be anywhere or with anyone other than this man.
Sherlock hears the hint of desperation in John’s voice and stops. He inhales deeply and then drops down into the chair again. He takes John’s hands in his own, stroking the backs of his hands with his thumbs. Sherlock isn’t sure if it is meant to calm John or himself, but realizes he does not mind either way as he watches the doctor shift to a more comfortable position. John blows out a long breath and closes his eyes. Sherlock watches him, sees every feature on his countenance and sighs. He leans forward and rests his forehead to John’s. The connection point is warm and radiates heat down Sherlock’s neck and into his body. It does not stop until it reaches his toes and he hopes John feels the same. No, he knows it does because it is not simply a physical connection. It is one that runs deep into their souls.
“I’m sorry. I can’t,” John muttered, barely loud enough to hear over the din. Disappointment shown thick on his face and in his tone. “I’m meeting someone.”
I will only answer the last. I'm thinking through my many ideas for the next story, but am writing a oneshot in the meantime. It is my first and I hope it actually turns out to be fairly short, and still makes sense. As you all know, I can be pretty wordy. Lol. What, me? Plain Jane?? Surely not. Bahahaha!
We've learned quite a lot in this chapter and learning is always good. Then there's all those fond looks and sparkling eyes. Sure he's not your date, says Angelo. Heh. Heh. But for how long? (infamous brow waggle, knowing smirk, and meaningful gesture) You all know me. Jane the Romantic! (and not evil at all heh heh)
He goes through everything that took place and in as much detail as he can. Sherlock cringes when John gets to the fire escape and alley. The bastard came so close to finding John there and would have surely killed him where he stood. No place to run. Sherlock does not interrupt, forcing back his fear and worry for John.
That said, here it is. Chapter 13. The follow-up to John rushing out of Sherlock's hotel room after a hot night, but rude awakening. A friend asked me last night why I don't add more tags that truly reflect the nature of the story. To my credit, I did add slow burn. However, I have neglected little gems like torture, evil, rude (in some cases, fucking rude). So here's the poll: To add or Not to add? What do you all think?
Thank you again for all your love and support! I love you all! You are the best fans a gal could ask for!
“My height, blonde, brown eyes and fair skin. He was wearing a black turtleneck and sport coat. I couldn’t see anything else through all the people. He had this look in his eye, like he knew something about me or someone I hold dear. And smirking, but more of a sneer. He’s dangerous, John. I don’t know how, but he is involved in all of this.”
“It’s fine. It’s fine. Just come with me,” Sherlock takes hold of the hand on John’s uninjured arm and guides him through the condo.
What did you think? Anybody else excited to see Billy in a completely different role?? I love breaking the norms, taking the road less traveled. That's right! Your friend, Jane is a crazy woman. Bwahahahaha!
“I have researched it quite extensively and found that there is a very sensitive erogenous zone on the feet of most men.” Sherlock slides his eyes to look at John, an impish smile on his face. For his part, John bursts out laughing. He throws his back against the arm of the sofa and categorically ignores Sherlock’s petulant expression.
There is a moment of silence while the two men gaze at one another. Searching and learning, drawing on one another’s strength.
John’s eyes widened and he wondered how Sherlock could know which hospital. He did not ask, unwilling to interrupt the brilliant man before him.
“I know, John,” Sherlock places his free hand comfortingly on John’s knee. “Bill’s death was a tragedy to be sure. But if you hadn’t been in London for the people you have saved before and after it,
“He’s been a surgeon in London for ten years,” Sherlock states and Greg’s eyes dart to him again. How the hell would he know that? But Greg doesn’t have much time to wonder before Mrs. Hudson continues.
I really hope you all loved this chapter! I'll try to get the others out as soon as I can, but I'm heading into a busy weekend.
Hello Hello!! I’m back and I’m so sorry that I made you wait so long for this one. I took a little trip to Packer country last weekend and wasn’t able to work on it. It was a wonderful getaway though. I really needed the time away and spent some quality time with two really great friends. Don’t worry. It was a very safe and distanced. 😉 Oddly enough, we spent most of the time playing a detective game. It was so much fun, but we completely failed the first case! Our score was 8/24 for god sake. We did it a second time that went better and then excelled on the second case. I can't wait to get together again for number 3. Anyway, if you ever get a chance to play detective with your friends, do it.
Well, y'all, I'll keep editing and we'll see where this next case takes the boys. It's bigger than they think and will test them in ways no one would expect. How's that for a teaser? LOL. The DP questions here would simply be frustrated exclamations. "What? What the fuck is THAT supposed to mean?! Test them in ways... Why don't you just say Sherlock gets lost in a corn maze and John is thrown head-first off a motorcycle? I mean, jesus, that's a much better teaser." And Deadpool would shuffle away, still making sarcastic remarks as a car flies by and knocks over a fire hydrant, water shooting up in the air and raining back down on him while he pays no mind.
Also, before we get to the questions, WHAT THE FUCK, MARY?? Back off the doctor. Sherlock is jealous perhaps? Anyone else see that? Then a little spat and DINNER?? Ooooooo, the mind boggles.
Hello, my lovelies! I've missed you from one weekend to the next. This week went by so quickly too. I can hardly believe it. Like all of you, I'm trying to get used to a new schedule, kids being home from school and trying to home school them. God, what a time to realize I'm not cut out to be a teacher.
“No, I don’t think she does,” John replies with a knowing look. “You forget I’ve met with all the staffers. Paul Dimmock, Daniel and Craig, Greg - they all say it.”
John resists the urge to snap at him in favor of looking away and straight ahead instead. After a few moments of silence, John sighs and looks down at his feet.
Mary takes another step closer and pulls open the jacket she had held tightly closed up until this point. Not a stitch lies beneath. John does step back, what little he can, startled and trying desperately not to show it. Judging from the small smile on Mary’s blood red lips and the amused gleam in her eyes, he is failing.
Yes, Jane of Cakes is back with another work and I really hope you all like it. It's my first AU and I'm nervous as hell to put it out there. I just keep hoping it isn't complete rubbish. As the quick description says, our boys are in the roller derby racket for this one. It is born out of my joining the local roller derby team in 2018. I love it. Unfortunately, my flipping back decided it was time to die and I had to stop skating, but not before giving myself a derby name. Say hello to Pepto Dismal. Hahahahaha!! I may not be able to skate, but I still keep score at bouts, which I love almost as much.
No. John dismissed that as soon as he thought it. That was not why he wanted to leave the club with Sherlock. John had no interest in making Jim jealous. He just wanted to spend more time with the fascinating consulting detective. My god, John wanted to learn all he could: his work, how he had conceived of it, how he met Greg, everything. John had never been so drawn to a person in his life and was more than a little pissed off to have met him tonight when he was here waiting for fucking Jim Moriarty to show up.
John sits up again and takes a deep breath. With his teeth biting at his lower lip, he lowers himself down slowly and then turns onto his side carefully. It’s the most goddamn erotic thing Sherlock has seen in his life. Bending his good arm and supporting his head on one hand, John looks up at Sherlock. He gives him a pained and hesitant smile.
“No, I didn’t. There was more opportunity in civilian life, in England. Bill had shipped out to Afghanistan,” a determined look comes over John’s face and his elbow presses into Sherlock’s fingertip as if he needs to ground himself with the touch. “I thought I could do more, help more people, make more of a difference working in London. Women, children, young and old…”
John Watson is in love with his flatmate and he wants him to know it, but how to tell him? Perhaps the perfect time will arise over the holidays. As ever, Mycroft gets in the way.
“All day,” Sherlock tells him, rolling his eyes in his mind and stifling the desire to mutter ‘tedious’.
“No. You’re perfect.” Sherlock tips forward and kisses John passionately, but he keeps his mouth closed. When he pulls away, he brings his hands up to cup John’s face and meets his eyes. “I do not intend to rush you.”
John freezes on the spot, his eyes wide with shock. His jaw drops open and all trace of humor drains away.
John fixes Mycroft with hard eyes and stalks forward, imaging the man can see the angry smoke rising off his head. For his part, Mycroft puts on that smile of forced pleasantry and opens his mouth to greet the doctor. John comes to a quick stop and cuts him off.
Dr. Watson takes over his thought processes as John grabs a towel, drops to his knees, and presses it hard to Sherlock’s chest. The detective gasps and then groans in response.
Okay, so it was another fairly short chapter, but what a chapter! Am I right? It was a fun one to write, let me tell you. I hope you all enjoyed its sentiment and its steam. I'm not sure what to say about this one, other than what I've already said. Our intrepid duo picks up the case again in the next chapter, which I believe, will be a longer one. Keep your good eye out for it. I'm hoping to post it quickly.
He jerked their hands down to their sides, pulling Sherlock into his personal space and fixed him with a smoldering gaze.
“Yeah, I suppose that makes sense,” he concedes reluctantly, “but I don’t have my wallet for a hotel. I don’t even have any clothes.”
“I know, but it’s not particularly healthy and... I worry about you.” Now John continues very carefully. “Especially with these nightmares.”
“No,” Sherlock replies quietly. He rests his hands on John’s waist and pulls him up so their bodies are touching from chest to knee, their hips more or less together. John cradles his face in one hand while placing the other on his shoulder. Their lips meet hesitantly, softly. Both exhale slowly through open mouths, close enough to feel the warmth of the other’s breath.
John nearly spits a mouthful of wine across the table, swallowing quickly and rushing the glass to his lips to catch any drips. His eyes blink wide.
The sound of shrill sirens fills the air and a megaphoned voice demands that arms be raised, hands visible, and it is clear that the cavalry has arrived. Greg’s face lightens and he huffs a laugh.
John pauses. Sherlock meets his gaze and then lets his eyes drop down to John’s lips when the tip of his tongue darts out to wet them. Sherlock swallows hard.
They stare at it for a moment that seems to go on forever. Then they both spring into motion again as they scrabble for it, each trying to knock the other’s hands away while grabbing for the gun themselves. They roll onto their sides, facing the steering column and still grappling for the flare gun. Sherlock stretches his arms their full length and then stretches them again. The tip of his middle finger can just touch the trigger guard. He gives it one more shot and only succeeds in pushing the gun another millimeter out of his reach. He huffs in frustration and wraps his arms around Moriarty instead. The shorter man has positioned himself between Sherlock and the flare gun, their bodies flush with one another as if spooning. If their roles were reversed and Sherlock was the smaller spoon, the gun would be his.
Instead of being angry at the slight, John eased up and huffed a laugh in spite of himself. He could feel the muscles in his body relaxing just as quickly as they had tightened and marveled for a moment at his reaction. He began to study Sherlock more intentionally.

Is John right about his feelings for Sherlock being stronger than anything he might find out about their past?
It needs its own paragraph, it's that phenomenal. This Part is going to have a lot of fluffy, fun, goofy, peaceful love in it. And sex. Lots of sex. Sometimes crazy fun sex. OOOO! I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Mm-mm! You just wait. You haven't seen anything yet. M'boys are gettin' a vacation.
Wow. Moriarty is a bitch when he's angry. I know I'm really sticking it to my poor John. It's not because I don't love him. John is my absolute favorite character. Like I've said before, he's the sassy man version of me. With great challenge comes great strength. John's trials are my own exploration of strength and John Watson always comes out kicking ass. It looks pretty bleak now, but this too shall pass. The dawn coming our way. But beware for the darkest hour.
This chapter was incredibly difficult to write. I must have read through it for edits three different times and I changed something every time. I hate doing such horrible things to my John and Sherlock. I truly love them both and, frankly, identify with John the most. Writing is not just something I do for pleasure. It helps me deal with my own feelings and with things that have happened to me in the past. However you all may feel about stories of rape and abuse, I hope you can see it in your hearts to stick with me and trust that I don't just do it for effect. It has actually been very therapeutic.
Tune in next Sunday for the final chapter of KYFC, otherwise known as Kind Yodelers Fond of Coffee.😂
“You used to surf in Anaheim,” Sherlock remarks instead, clearing his throat and keeping his tone even. John blinks.
He eyes John with concern when the doctor does not answer in favor of staring down at his own hands. Sherlock nudges him with a shoulder.
Their faces were dangerously close again. John could feel Sherlock’s breath ghosting over his face and he found himself wishing, hoping for the other man to do something. They pulled away to stand side by side, staring into one another’s eyes before moving in different directions to curl their bodies in identical fluid motions. They met again a moment later, back to back and angled in the same direction, their cheeks pressed together. John pushed against the taller man and he leaned into John as they slowly dropped low and raised up again, snapped their heads back and broke apart to dance in their own idioms again.
Sherlock glances at John and then averts his gaze to the ceiling, disgusted with himself for behaving so irrationally. He sneers and waves it off dismissively.
5) For the love of god, is John ever going to realize he's in love with Sherlock or am I just stringing you all along? 😈
“Yes,” Sherlock answers before he can think better of it. He looks at John, who is very clearly surprised. Anything more than that is difficult to read. Sherlock crinkles his brow in frustration. This would all be so much easier if he could deduce John properly. Of all the people he has ever met, why does the one person whose innermost feelings he most wants to know have to be so damn impossible to read? “We are friends and I want to help.”
3) How is Sherlock going to feel about all this once he has a chance to think about the fact that he just confessed his love for John? (head exploding)
“I don’t doubt it,” John chuckled. He met Sherlock’s eyes. “I’d love to hear about it. Somewhere else,” he took a steadying breath. What the hell was he doing? “Quieter so we don’t have to yell.”
Sherlock is looking away and rising to his feet, desperately wishing this conversation would end. He picks up a sterile bandage packet and tears it open, swiftly putting the bandage in place. It surprises John enough that he almost recoils, but Sherlock grabs his hand roughly and shoves it toward the bandage.
Sherlock turns to mirror his position. Draping his left arm across the top of the back, his fingers are close enough for him to touch John’s elbow with his fingertips. A soft brush of affection, of love. Sherlock wiggles his fingers slowly, but does not get close enough to actually touch John. Oh, how he longs to.
Sherlock opens his mouth to fly at the GM, but does not say a word. To Greg’s surprise, he merely stands poised for battle and then lets his arms slowly drop to his sides. His shoulders sag ever so slightly as all the fight drains out of him. Greg continues in a kinder tone.
“He cut it damn close though,” John continues, his voice barely above a whisper. “I thought I was imagining things when I saw the torch.”
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John rushes to his side, dialing for help as he goes. “I need an ambulance and police at 221B Baker Street. Gunshot wound to the chest. He’s lost a lot of blood.”
Hello, Everyone! I'm so sorry for the delay in releasing this chapter. It wasn't originally in the manuscript, but I felt it had to be added. Between being stupid busy and ending up in the ER again (eye roll), it took a while to write and edit AND the first section nearly killed me. God! I love this chapter though and hope all of you agree that it was worth the wait. I'm hoping to get back to my usual posting frequency now. Oh, and no spoilers. Heh heh.
John wears a fond smile and has a far away look in his eyes. He clearly shares the opinion and loves them dearly. But suddenly he sobers and the wistfulness vanishes.
2. Will he ever get to tell Sherlock he loves him now that he knows? And godammit, Jane, how could you do this? Just because we were all afraid John would figure it out at a critical moment doesn't mean you had to do this!
“Your concerns are unfounded,” he replies petulantly. “I have been sleeping, as you can see.” He flashes a fake smile. “Now you can go.”
“Do him!” John exclaimed, jerking his head to his left. Sherlock’s amused gaze followed and picked out the man instantly. He looked back at John with narrowed eyes and a knowing smirk.
“Bender!” Budreau barks at another officer on the boat. “Take the helm and follow side by side to the marina.”
There are many more questions, my friends, but I have to stop somewhere. Feel free to submit your own questions and we'll chat. Haha. I feel like that character from SNL with the thick New York accent. Cawfee Tawk! Yes, that's what her show was called! And she loves Barbara Streisand. Anyway, I feel like "I'll give you a tawpic: Sherlawk and Jawn are clearly in love, so why don't they say it awlready? Tawlk amongst yourselves." Hahahaha.
A moment later, John is sitting next to Sherlock on the sofa watching singing trolls and John smiles in spite of himself. He can’t believe he’s watching this. He can’t believe Sherlock, of all people, is watching this. The story begins to make more sense as the film continues and John’s grins keep getting wider and wider whenever he spares a glance at Sherlock. It’s not long before John just has to say something and totally disregards his promise.
They continue to stare at one another, neither moving an inch. Sherlock finally rolls his eyes and huffs, shifting his feet impatiently.
Sherlock presses forward until his lips touch John’s gently. They are warm and soft and perfect. All of the thoughts that normally fill Sherlock’s head suddenly stand still. The only one that seems important stems from the kiss he is currently sharing with his flatmate. The one causing a tingle in his belly that builds as the kiss continues. His eyes slip closed and  he presses a little harder against John’s lips, parting his own ever so slightly. John follows suit. Sherlock feels like he sucks the air right out of the smaller man when he gasps at being granted access. His tongue ventures out hesitantly, its tip just touching John’s bottom lip gently and for only a second before darting back in his mouth.
Hella hooted as she rolled by her partner, slapping her ass on the way. Sherlock had signaled for more laps and then glanced at John as his laughter grew even louder, tears actually beginning to roll from his eyes. Sherlock had grinned at the reckless abandon.
What the hell, Jane? Is it really a mystery? At the roller derby? Oh, wait. Does it turn out that Molly really is suffering from some kind of delusion? I mean, Sherlock isn't even a detective. John isn't his partner. They barely even know each other. They aren't even married. They're not even divorced!
Unfortunately, John does not have time to savor Sherlock’s voice or his words. A few sentences in and he notices their guide slowly moving in on Sherlock. Irritation wells up within him and John immediately has the impulse to touch Sherlock. Stake some sort of claim with a touch that is just intimate enough to say ‘Back off. He’s mine.’. Something that will definitely tell her to get the fuck away from Sherlock.
“Anytime. Anytime you feel like getting yourself almost killed,” Greg cocks a brow and shakes his head. “Never a dull moment with you two.”
Sherlock grimaces and uses the last of his strength to punch him square in the jaw with his left hand. Stunned, Moriarty falls to the floor, but manages to pull himself up again to look Sherlock in the eye one last time. He can see the detective is fading fast.
“I can’t,” Sherlock said in a shaky voice. He pressed his lips together, curling them in on one another. “People don’t like hearing my deductions. They don’t like that I know their secrets.”
“Angelo would have been hesitant to let you in in that condition anyway,” Sherlock’s words pulled John back from his own thoughts. The detective still had a hint of a smile on his face as his beautiful eyes ran the length of John’s body. “You’ll never get a cab and will catch your death walking for an hour.”
John tried, he did, but lying to Sherlock was too much for him AND he’s that much closer to seeing his true feelings for Sherlock. How great is the moment when Sherlock just  blurts it out? “I love you!” and he doesn’t try to take it back. He just lets it be. John’s reaction is the greatest too. “You...you can’t. You haven’t known me five minutes.” Hahaha! I love it! I mean, I’m clearly biased so please let me know what you think. I don’t want to beg, but I’m not above it and it has been a bad week. Any encouragement is more than welcome and VERY appreciated. You all mean so much to me.
“Ah,” John grins cheekily, “makes sense with all the strategies, cuts and turns, and all those jumps.”
“So,” John begins as Sherlock feels a burst of lightheadedness when he gives his arm a squeeze and then gestures to the empty water bottle on the coffee table, “any chance I could get another? Or was that wine I saw on the counter?”
Am I right? Am I right? (diabolical laughing) You all keep telling me the peace is beautiful, but cannot last. Well...unfortunately, you're right. I really feel like I shouldn't be so tickled by the prospect of my beloved readers tearing their hair out or hiding their eyes behind their hands, hoping John says "Oh, no, wait. Don't go, Sherlock. I'm being ridiculous. You're right. There's something very suspicious about Mary. Let's snuggle a bit and figure out what it is." Sorry, friends., but you'll just have to wait and see what happens. No hints.
Notice some of the tags have changed and the rating has gone from Mature to Explicit. (insert infamous eyebrow waggle)
The doctor stares at Sherlock for a moment with stormy dark blue eyes that slowly begin to lighten. The anger and seriousness on his face smooths into something softer. He releases his hold on Sherlock and shuffles backwards, relieving the tension and what little space there was between their bodies. Sherlock, however, is not going to let him off that easily. He closes the gap again and touches John’s shoulder just under the blood. John flinches, but does not pull away.
Sherlock decides quickly that may not have been the best thing to say, but he has no idea what he should have said instead. He clears his throat and gestures to the closet door.
“Yeah, right, I know. You read people, but it’ll be my voice and my perspective. There’s value in that that your method ignores.”
Could he have saved him? Would it have made any difference or is Sherlock right? Would he be dead too?
“You’ve seen me dance?” John asked, a little startled. This lithe specter of the dance floor had noticed him? Sherlock just replied with a satisfied and very amused expression.
* How the fuck is John going to find Sherlock? Will it be too late? Is this the fall? Hmm? I know he fell off the cliff already, and with Moriarty even like the Sherlock of books, but this could get pretty bad.
John waved him off and took another drink. He watched Greg and Roland mix drinks for a bit, chuckling whenever his friend fended off the flirtations of both men and women alike. The man was an enigma, never showing interest in any gender or persuasion, the ideal businessman. It was really no different from him at Bart’s, John supposed. Still, it suddenly seemed odd that in all the years he had known Greg he never mentioned a partner and John had never asked.
“Right,” John takes a step closer to the sofa. “And just how are adoptive trolls a statement of the human condition?”
And it was not a decision. That dinner with John changed everything. The door wasn’t just opened, it was forced from its hinges. In spite of it, Sherlock has tried to board up the doorway and move on. He may have feelings for John, strong feelings, but cannot risk his heart again no matter how persistent it is. Because John would have nothing less than his whole heart and losing it, losing John would destroy him.
“Apparently, even The Machine gets the flu,” Greg said by way of explanation. He continued with a shrug. “Who knew? To be honest, I hope it doesn’t spread around. She sounded terrible.”
Jim stared at him inquisitively. He tilted his head curiously and cocked a brow, seemingly about to speak. John cracked a mirthless smile and squeezed Jim’s shoulder.
With one hand around a metal rung, John looks up the ladder to the top of the boat’s side. It looks like it’s fucking miles away. He swallows and turns his head to look back at Greg as best he can, managing to catch the man’s eye.
Thank you all again for the love and support, especially at times like these when it's longer between postings. I love you all. Jane
John doesn’t remember what happened when Sherlock returned from the dead, but he knows enough. It was far from a loving reunion or happy embrace, and he still married Mary. Why did he do that? He recalls the wedding now. He knows how he felt about Sherlock, that he loved him with all his heart. Did he believe his friend did not feel the same? Was he simply protecting himself? Did he actually think Sherlock was happy for him or that he, himself was happy with Mary??
John leaned forward to rest his forehead against Sherlock’s chest. He felt Sherlock’s breath falter and straightened again in a shot. He stared at Sherlock while internally berating himself for spoiling the moment. He swallowed hard, his mind searching for words and coming up empty. To his relief, their stilted movements grew more easy and relaxed as they listened to the lyrics drifting around them.
Completely taken aback by the joke, John just stares for a full ten seconds while Sherlock opens the med kit. He watches as the tall man sifts through its contents in search of peroxide, gauze dressings and bandages. Sherlock observes him from the corner of his eye, wondering if John is actually going to sit down and let him tend to his wounds or needs to be prompted again. One thing, he sure as hell is going to explain how he was hurt and why he is running around Detroit in a t-shirt and underpants. Not that Sherlock is complaining, of course, but he is hardly going to tell John that.
“That’s brilliant!” he exclaimed, clapping the taller man on the shoulder and beaming at him with bright eyes, their depths growing even more blue with his merriment. “It sounds amazing.”
“What? Why?” John’s eyes fill with concern and his pupils begin to shrink, even as Sherlock smiles and strokes his hair. “Have I done something wrong?”
“I assist the police when they are out of their depth, which is always,” Sherlock answered, growing quite serious. “I am a Consulting Detective.”
“My day off,” John replied with a slight laugh, leaning against the bar and resting his arm on its surface. “I need it. Ten days on and just as many late nights. I feel like the Duracell bunny, but on half full batteries from a Poundland Christmas sale.”
Just after midnight, Sherlock wakes with a start from another nightmare. He has awoke this way every night since returning to 221B two months ago. He and John have shared his bed every night since that first one, which has made things difficult. Sherlock has gone out of his way to keep his nightmares from John and it has worked for the most part, but the detective is certain it will not last much longer. John isn't stupid and he'll soon realize that Sherlock's night terrors happen more often than he believes. Sherlock has to come up with something to tell John without lying, or telling the truth. God, what has happened to him?! Has falling in love so deeply and so completely laid waste to all of his mental abilities in a mere matter of weeks? And, if so, what can he do to combat it? Sherlock knows full well that trying to go backwards and just be friends again will not change his feelings for John. Or John’s feelings for him. They will still be drawn to one another. Laying flat on his back, Sherlock sighs up at the ceiling. Caring is not an advantage.
“Okay,” John stumbled over his own thoughts, trying to comprehend, “but how can you know all that from just…”
“Thank you,” John smiles. At moment, as if by magic, a cab stops right next to them. John glances back at her with his hand on the door handle. “Share a cab?”
John knew it was defensive and unnecessary. Greg would never in a million years judge him, but to have this happen time and time again hurt. Greg’s words always stung, even though he meant them in the most supportive way possible. John knew he should take them to heart and he did, just not enough to do anything about it. It was true his relationship was far from perfect, but in all honesty, he really did not give a toss. It was what it was and it was easy to ignore what he did not like.
“Thanks for calling us in, Doctor,” she nods. John nods back, looking a little confused. Greg calls loudly from just inside the next room and Sally immediately diverts her course.
And now.....drum roll.....wait for it.....you know what's coming.....I am suddenly feeling very silly........and it feels so good.......
That deep and shaking baritone pulls John from his horrified stupor and he rushes for Sherlock, ripping his own coat off as he goes. He beats his friend with it until the flames on his clothing are smothered. He turns his attention to the release rope, but its incendiary treatment continues fueling the flames.
He watches in silence as John’s dark and stormy eyes slowly begin to clear. He may have heard words like Sherlock’s before, possibly from his parents, but he had never dared to believe. He could never find any peace in his heart or mind. So he bottled his feelings and carried the weight of his guilt. John clearly never spoke of it at any time, in any relationship and the fact that he would trust Sherlock with it opens Sherlock’s eyes. He sees for the first time how much their friendship truly means to John.
“How can you say that? Moriarty has tried to kill you three times in the last few months and hasn’t succeeded because he hasn’t wanted to. He’s come so damn close, Sherlock, and he isn’t going to stop until he’s finished what he started.”
I also want to apologize for the delay in getting this chapter out. I had planned it all out and someone nearly broke her arm over the weekend. Turns out that can change the best laid plans in a heartbeat. Go figure.
“Can’t happen again? Why the hell…” his eyes narrowing, “You’ve been talking to Mycroft. Or maybe he’s been talking at you.”
I say it all the time, but I love each and every one of you and appreciate your support. Please keep reading and loving. Hearing from you means so much to me. A big shout out to my very own AGPatton for declaring the last chapter her new favorite. I got a little misty-eyed when I read that.
legendary, isn’t it?” John replies from behind his water glass. “I think that’s made my choice for me. And you?”
Sherlock fights with these emotions he cannot show, trying to master them. He must maintain control like never before and tamp down his instinct to leap into the water for John or this is all for naught. He has to stick to the plan.
Sherlock stopped a moment to insert a turn in their dance, in spite of the fact that he was not leading. John followed along with a quiet chuckle. Sherlock added a series of steps that ended with them closer to the edge of the dance floor, but still far enough away from the bar and the couple they were watching. Dozens of people talking and laughing at tables separated them. Even if the woman or her lover looked out to the dance floor and saw Sherlock and John, neither would think anything of it.
The voice rang out sharply over the mass of people eliciting a loud cheer from the crowd. Prom time was over and everyone sprang into action, including Sherlock. Wanting to erase his words and the awkwardness from John’s mind, he raised his arms straight up and moved his lithe body in an obscene wave timed perfectly with the rhythm. He threw his head back at the next “Yeah” and when his gaze fell on John again, it was searing. John stood watching in shock. He could not comprehend the sudden change in Sherlock’s demeanor. As John struggled through the confusion and lingering awkwardness, he opened his mouth to speak, but was rendered speechless when Sherlock took a step closer. He lowered his arms, fingers skimming along his body as they went and resting on his own undulating hips. He turned his back to John, looking over his shoulder with those smoldering eyes, swinging and rocking his lush ass. He was just close enough to barely bump into John’s groin, filling him with a teasing pleasure.
In a sudden fit of rage, Sherlock growls and veritably throws the smaller man off the bed. His mind clouded by anger, he jumps up and launches himself onto Moriarty’s body. The upturned knife pierces his chest and he falls heavily onto the other man, the blade pressing further into his body. Moriarty pushes the detective onto his back and grins when a strangled cry slips from his throat. He stares right into Sherlock’s eyes and leans in close, so close that Sherlock can feel his breath.
“Oh?” He can’t help but notice Sherlock’s uncharacteristic nervousness - the wide and shifting eyes, the color in his cheeks, the way he licks his lips.
“We had just beaten the Demons badly. It wasn’t for the championship or even a play-off bout, but Moriarty was pissed off,” Sherlock had said with a growing grin. “He made some disparaging remarks about Molly and I…”
Similarly, there are no further attempts on John’s life, or Molly’s. Mycroft continues to keep an eye on her through PT and in her room. Sherlock has even walked in on the two of them in the throws of a ruthless chess game. Mycroft has also proved useful in obscuring John’s whereabouts. After picking up enough clothing to last a couple of weeks, along with a few other items, John drove to a hotel and made it look as though he had checked in while actually leaving for Sherlock’s condo. John repeated this every two or three days so he appeared to be moving around.
Sherlock’s expression quickly melts into relief. He wraps his arms around John and tucks his head over the man’s shoulder in a tight embrace.
I apologize to anyone who feels the underlining disrupts the reading experience, but I want to be cognizant of any readers who might be disturbed by this subject.
I guess you all know I'm not going to stop at Part 4 now. I hope no one's disappointed that the show goes on. I know this is one damn long series, but hey, I've never made a secret of it. Persistence is key. A BIG, HUGE THANK YOU to all of you! You, who have stuck with me through it all. I draw so much strength and joy from all of you, and hope I'm bring you just as much joy with each new chapter. I love you all and hope to see you for Part 5. I'll work on getting it out as soon as I can.
“You are impetuous and driven,” Mrs. Hudson’s tone and expression are stern. Greg can’t help but think of his mother’s face during what she used to call Come to Jesus moments. “It is what makes you the best coach I have ever seen. But sometimes you’re an asshole.”
“Right, right. Sorry.” John turns to go and takes a few steps, but stops. Sherlock’s head is tilted to one side. John can almost see the impatient expression on his face through the back of his head as he waits for John to speak. John takes a couple of hesitant steps toward the sofa.
“Thank you, Greg,” she smiles, taking a seat. Greg follows suit. “We met on the morning of the second day. Charles Griffin and I got to breakfast late and he was sitting at a table on his own.”
“Is this really necessary, Sergeant Budreau?” he reads the name tag beneath the man’s badge. “We are not armed and have made clear our full cooperation.”
“Many times,” Sherlock grabs a napkin and fishes a pen from his breast pocket. He starts to draw a diagram of the track and team boxes, the spectator areas, every detail he can think of. He looks up to John when finished to see him already studying the diagram closely.
Greg was the first to come into the fold as an expert and honest general manager. He revolutionized every aspect of team business, making it professional and accountable once again. Together, he and Mrs. Hudson hired a most accomplished staff for the team to depend upon. It was his demeanor more than his experience that made Mrs. Hudson trust his judgement implicitly, in spite of being roughly 25 years her junior.
“Fuck the policy,” she growls, closing the gap and grabbing his waist to hold him steady as she crashes her body against his.
Sherlock leans closer. The two gaze at one another with the kind of trust and bond typically earned only after years of friendship.
It started the moment they met. There was an electricity in the air when he laid eyes on the stunning man, all tall lines and dark curls and skin, so much skin! Why was it all covered with that tailored suit? When Sherlock Holmes looked up at John to take the offered mobile from his hand, John felt the air around them crack. And those eyes. Not quite blue or green or grey, almost silver, like a kaleidoscope of the universe in just those two beautiful eyes. John later decided they were most definitely silver with small flecks of grey that somehow reflected blue and green. Chameleons. Just like the man they belong to, who can put on another personality at a moment’s notice for a case.
“It was the late 80s,” Sherlock shrugs. “I don’t know what it was like in London, but things were pretty lax and the suburb was like a small town where nothing bad happens. They all knew us and we just went around the cul de sac and up the street, not far at all. Our parents knew it was safe and that we could be trusted. Mom used to say I was an adult at five.”
“They found me in what doubled as a library and office when I was four. There I was, under the desk with a book in my lap. They thought it odd because it was decidedly not a picture book. It wasn’t until I started talking to them about the events described in that book, and others, that they realized I was reading them. And quickly too,” John puffs out a breath and looks away, out into the restaurant at other patrons as if in disbelief at his own memories. “They had been teaching me letters, sounds and colors, things of that nature, for a week or so. There weren’t any nursery schools close enough to our house and they’d taken it upon themselves to teach me the basics. Meanwhile, I used what they had imparted upon me and taught myself how to read.”
Thank you all so much for your kudos and comments. All your encouragement means the world to me and truly motivates me to carry on. I love this story, which is why it came out so incredibly long. I just couldn't stop working with these characters. I do hope you will all stick with me to the bitter end and that you all love it, and the boys as much as I do. You all have my undying love and respect.  ("Bitter end"? What does that mean, I wonder? Ahhh!)
The attraction was undeniable and yet, John “I’m not gay” Watson dismissed it. He tried to write it off as just being very intrigued with this most unusual person, who is brilliant and funny and fucking gorgeous. A man who positively HAS to be delicious when tasted and has ridiculous cheekbones. A man John killed to protect only hours after meeting him. Nope, nope, not attraction. Just intrigue.
They arrive at Krispin’s Diner nearly an hour later, colonially themed and larger than one normally expects a diner to be. Perfect for their over-sized group. They are able to get tables fairly close together, in spite of the busy night. The evening passes nicely enough as they all eat, joke and laugh. Unfortunately, the opportunity to talk through the bout does not arise, much to Sherlock’s chagrin. However, there is a restaurant in the hotel and he intends to speak with John once they are there. It might be better to do it alone anyway.
“It was no accident, Greg. That woman was on Harry’s case from the moment it started,” he says with certainty. “She was the target. If she had impacted the track with that force, she would have broken more than two bones. Janine was in both the right and wrong place.”
It is Christmas eve. John and Sherlock have just finished opening presents from one another, deciding it best since they have invited friends for a party the following afternoon. The evening is comfortable and warm. The flat, lit by only the fire and twinkle lights is cozy, almost misty. John sits in his chair across from Sherlock, looking at the open book Sherlock has just given him. It is a mystery novel and one that John has wanted to read for some time, but had gone out of print. The man has connections and really does know him too well. He glances up at the curly head across the rug, face hidden behind a chemistry book Sherlock has had his eye on for over a month. Is this the moment? The moment he tells Sherlock he would love nothing more than to spend his life with him doing more than catching criminals and sharing laughs?
John’s head snapped up, his wide eyes immediately finding a lone figure standing across the street. The corners of John’s mouth quirked up, his foul mood instantly lifted. The tall man in the swooshy coat was unmistakable. John felt light and his heart soared, even as his throat closed. He could not seem to get a word out, so he just stood there grinning like an idiot. He watched as Sherlock made a few quick deductions and scowled.
“Their pattern of frequency and the days on which their meetings occur suggest visits to the city for business and he is clearly not a colleague,” Sherlock added.
John closes his eyes abruptly, struck by a sudden wave of memory that pulls him under. A pane of glass shatters and he sees himself in a lab at Bart’s. The man from the park, Mike Stamford stands close by as John passes his mobile to Sherlock. For just the smallest of seconds, their fingers brush and electricity tingles through John’s whole body. And those words, smooth and silky in that beautiful baritone that has secretly tickled John’s spine ever since.
“I most certainly do not!” Sherlock raises his chin, straightening his long neck. He looks down his nose at John. “I merely appreciate a job well done.”
“Uh...It’s not,” Greg backpedals, also glancing at Sherlock and receiving a death glare. “Not at all. I just… He doesn’t usually invite people over, you know?”
You bet your ass you did, and with little to no injuries too. Haha. See my Persistence series if you want to know why that should tickle your funny bone. Anyway, I kept you waiting for these last two chapters and just didn’t have the heart to keep stringing you along. That said, I know what else you’re thinking.
Hey, y’all! I hope you all had a great week, even in the state of suspense in which I left you. Haha. But seriously, I hope all of you are well and as good as you can be.
“Damn it,” Sherlock mutters as he produces the offending device. “Greg, hello. Your timing, as always, is impeccable.”
“Oh, I’d feel a little odd doing that. Wouldn’t want to intrude on the off-chance someone is still there.”
“When he entered his home Wednesday evening, John was attacked,” Sherlock explains, sounding significantly more calm than he had the rest of the meeting. “He managed to escape..”
* Thank god the shoulder scans didn't reveal any hidden tracking devices. Moriarty clearly didn't plan on John ever escaping. Or did he? They didn't really scan anywhere else...
Sherlock counts heads, making sure to see the face of every skater and support staffer before turning to the driver who sits directly in front of his seat.
“You,” the tallest officer commands with a nod at Greg, “get in the boat and keep your hands where I can see them. Slowly.”
Greg remains silent while John tells the tales of the previous nights, including this morning when he spoke to that irritating detective again. When he is finished, Greg’s fury has not diminished, but he has reigned it in.
Greg’s torso lurches forward just a bit, his shoulders hunching as he bites back the bark of laughter threatening to burst from his mouth. He coughs a little, clearing his throat, trying to cover. Sherlock gives him a pointed look, clearly not buying it. Greg recovers quickly and glances from one to the other as they stare each other down.
So, this is their last sex holiday day. We all know they'll make good use of it. Oh, yes! I'll try to get the next chapter out as soon as I can. I was way ahead with editing, but I've caught up now. Entonces, I have some serious editing to do before I can post anything more. Don't worry, I won't forget all of you, but I have some long nights ahead. Thank you all for your love and support. You make this even more of a joy than it already is and you all mean the world to me.
“And why is that?” John leaned further onto the bar, extremely interested now. He was not sure if it was because this man was a friend of Greg’s or just that he was so damn interesting, but John thoroughly enjoyed teasing him and was not about to stop. Maybe being in the club on his own tonight was not so bad after all. “What is it that keeps the great Sherlock…”
“No, not really. We all had some good scrapes, but never anything serious,” Sherlock drinks some wine, replaces his glass and waves his hand as a means of transition. “We kept at it for years. We started learning everything - rules, techniques, strategies - everything. We were going to be championship skaters together.”
Hello, my friends! Sorry for posting again so quickly, but I couldn't help myself and this is a short chapter. Speaking of which, I may be adding a chapter or two to the total once again. It will still be a little while before I know if more should be added. I'll keep you all informed.
“Like you want to give me a right flipping seeing-to,” John comments, suddenly sporting a playful grin. An outright wicked smile spreads across Sherlock’s face. John is momentarily surprised and pleased, but his expression quickly reverts to concern. “You need to take care of yourself no matter how intense things get with Moriarty.”
* First Mary and now Janine? Is John too trusting?? (But isn't that what makes him sweet and adorable John Watson?)
“So?” he rests his elbows on the table and brings his hands together, fork still in the fingers of his left hand. Sherlock brings a cloth napkin to his lips and blots away a bit of salad dressing. He takes a deep breath in and straightens his spine.
I wish you all a good weekend, a Happy Mother’s Day and an excellent upcoming week. I usually say I hope this brought you some solace, and I do, but this time I hope it continues to distract you all week long. Mwahahahaha!
He shoves at Sherlock’s arm again, watching fondly as Sherlock tries to reign in his merriment. When he has finally collected himself again, he looks at John with a more serious expression. It does not last as he starts to giggle and then quickly descends into laughter again. John shoves at him a third time, making both laugh even harder.
Hello, friends. This was a shorter chapter than usual, but worry not, some of the upcoming ones are going to be pretty long. I also think there might be more than ten after all. It all depends on how they break down. I hope all of you are still enjoying this. After all, we're finally getting to the REALLY good parts. The proposal and cool cases and hot sexytimes and who knows what's in store?
“Your boyfriend,” Sherlock rasped, nodding his head toward the bar. His mouth was still so close to John that the sigh he let out drifted over John’s lips and the doctor was loath to look away. What he saw drained that wonderful, tingling, incredible adrenaline rush from his body.
“Look, Sherlock, you’re good at hiding things from people,” John pauses, pursing his lips while Sherlock gives him a smile of smug satisfaction, “but not from me.”
“He’s a good ally to have, Watson,” Billy says instead of answering. He leans forward again and looks at John intently. “After what you’ve told me, I can see now that whatever was going on is more serious than I thought. I was a fool for not seeing it then.”
“Well, we could talk now,” Sherlock suggests, the smile evident in his voice and John finally turns to look at him, still expecting to be mocked somehow. Sherlock does look amused, but John should have known better than to think Sherlock would ridicule him.
“Yes, papa,” HardOn quips as heads begin to drop, the skaters finding their seats. She casts a glance at John and jokes. “Don’t let him tell you what to do, Ph.D. Keep him in line.”
Moriarty suddenly scrambles in Sherlock’s arms, kicking at him and hitting any place he can reach. Sherlock holds fast, but the man lurches forward when he cannot break free and the momentum slides them both closer to the steering column. Moriarty reaches as far as he can, straining against Sherlock’s arms and closes his fingers around the flare gun.
Jammer - the skater who skates around the track and aims to pass all of the blockers on the opposite team. A point is scored for each opposing team blocker the jammer passes.
Sherlock sits next to him and they both sip their coffees. He tries to read John in sideways glances. He looks tired, but not worried or frazzled. Assured of Janine’s condition, Sherlock allows himself to relax further and take a moment to observe John. It is quickly becoming one of his favorite pastimes; watching John. John’s face is all soft lines and dimples. His eyes are the color of the ocean, clear blue like a sunny day with expressive specks of midnight. His cheeks grow a most delightful shade of pink while Sherlock watches him. He finally stops his observations when John clears his throat and sits up straight in his chair. A bit not good, he supposes.
John blinks and pushes away the thoughts more forcefully this time. Now is not the time for nightmarish questions that will drive his mind into darkness. If John is going to think about Bill at all and how he fits into who John is today, he has to remain objective. If John had to guess, he would say losing Bill contributed, but he was already doing it before Bill. In fact, Bill seemed to have been the only exception and now Sherlock is too.
“Sherlock,” he finally says when his mind gets itself together, and it still is not firing on all cylinders, “there’s something you have to know about me.”
And now, because I HAVE to, thank you all for allowing me this extra time to craft a very cool chapter (if I do say so myself - sorry for bragging camp, but I'm really proud of this one) I didn't expect to add. Your support and patience mean the world to me. I'd have never made it this far without all of you. Thank you! I can't wait to see what you all think. Enjoy!!
“She is safe, John,” Sherlock assures him. “I called in a favor long ago. Mycroft is his name. He was an officer and then chief of police in Tampa before retiring early and moving to Detroit. He does short stints as a security guard when he gets bored and spends the rest of his time as he pleases. He has been watching Molly’s room nearly the whole of her hospital stay and will continue to do so.”
But John is not stepping back. His blue eyes explore every inch of Sherlock’s face as though he has the same idea Sherlock does, but that cannot be. John does not feel the same way and Sherlock feels so many things at once - joy, safety, adoration, comfort and... He feels like he is home. Not just in his condo, but home.
And so I take my leave. Stay safe and keep your stick on the ice. We're all in this together. (*sigh* I already miss hockey.)
Sherlock shrugs away from John’s touch, leaving his hand hovering alone between them. By the time it is back at John’s side, Sherlock is at the door with his hand on the knob.
“You’re right,” he breathes, a tear slipping from his eye and trickling down his cheek. “I know you’re right. But it’s so hard.”
“Yeah, the one you hate talking to,” sighing in frustration, “If you hate his interference so much, why do you let him control you?”
Please pay special attention to the tags when it comes out. Some of them will be changing and I'll be adding notes with the chapter summary. Also, there will definitely be more chapters to this part than what I have already indicated. I'm still not sure how many though.
The detective gasps almost silently and softly presses his lips to John’s. Their eyes close and they both lose themselves in the touch. John nips ever so slightly, teasing Sherlock’s lips open. A breath passes between them, a promise. It feels like hours pass before John suddenly pulls away to fix Sherlock with panicked, guilty eyes.
I will see you again next weekend, my friends. Thank you for your love and support. You comments and kudos are treasured, as is each of you. Keep safe, stay inside, good work, good night. I'll most likely kill you in the morning. Hahaha. Bonus points if you know where that line was plucked from!
“There you are,” John beams. “They were about to send out a search party and believe me when I say they would’ve carried you out here kicking and screaming. It was all I could do to hold them back.”
God, it was amazing. Caught up in the excitement, John’s mind flew forward to more nights with this man dancing and talking about his cases. So distracted by his own thoughts and simultaneously focused on their movements was John that he did not notice how close they had come to the edge of the dance floor until the crowd surged and pushed them against the wall.
John’s shoulders curl in a bit with the force of his feet landing on something hard and another jolt of pain vibrates through his body. He silently curses to himself, knowing it is only a flesh wound and not worth all the trouble it is causing. It is only the water and his wet clothes and the struggling that make it so painful.
Blocker - a skater who tries to prevent the jammer from skating around the track and scoring points.
John is leaning against the back of the ambulance, his bum resting on its bumper. A bright orange blanket hangs around his shoulders in spite of his swift movements as he points a finger and glowers at the paramedic before him.
is a true team. A team of equals, partners. That is what he has always worked toward and that emphasis has made his team unique.
“We’re in this together, yeah?” he says simply, leaning across the table. He looks at Sherlock so intently that Sherlock tips his head to the side, almost in wonder. “You, Greg, me, we’re working together to pull this off and protect the team. Now it’s just the two of us and I can’t help if I don’t have all the pieces. I
I'd say more, but I'm not even sure what else I can say. So bring it on. What do y'all think of these developments? What are you theories? Can Sherlock really protect John when Moriarty can apparently still just waltz into their flat whenever he wants? When will he come for John and what will John do when he does? What will Sherlock do? Jeez, I thought I had no words and here I am Deadpool questioning anyway. Here's the big one. The biggest MFer of them all. ... What is Sherlock going to do when he discovers Mycroft's betrayal? AHHHH!
“Is that what you…” he stops and shakes his head ever so slightly. His brows lower into a thoughtful crease. His features become deadly serious, but soft and understanding as well. “Don’t apologize, Sherlock.”
“Jesus,” John runs a hand through his hair and lets out a long breath, “someone else should know. Greg or Mrs. Hudson. Someone should be watching out for more accidents. Molly can’t do it while she’s on the track.”
“I’ll send one of the officers around tomorrow so you can both sign your statements,” Budreau replies, a slight smile his only response to Sherlock’s comment. “You’ll be at the stadium then?”
John is speechless for a full ten seconds. Any longer than that and Sherlock would have thought he had done something wrong. John takes another step closer to buy himself some time while he searches his mind for a reply worthy of Sherlock’s declaration. It is still so hard to believe this wondrous man would ever be interested in John the way he so clearly is.
“It’s all right, Greg,” Mrs. Hudson says easily. “I expected it. I expected you’d both be angry I didn’t put it up for discussion, but I knew John Watson was the doctor for our team as soon as we were introduced. Spending so much time with him at the conference only sealed the deal.”
“Great. See you around,” John muttered, turning his back on them. He set off in an instant, a spring in his step and a grin on his face.
And we're back. I know it's been a little while. I hope you aren't all vexed by the wait. Speaking of which, I want to add that we'll be on the move for Thanksgiving. I'm hoping to keep editing and posting, but I can't make any promises.
“Not good. It’s near the knee,” John glances up when Trixie sets the medical bag next to them. “Ta.”
4. Can Sherlock get past Moriarty AND Moran to get in the water after John in time? If he does, will they jump in after him?
“Stay where you are!” the policeman trains his gun on the coach, not knowing who is the perpetrator and who is the victim. “Both of you raise your hands slowly and stay right where you are.”
“Sherlock, my boy, why have you been away so long?” he laughs. “I thought this was the off-season, yeah?”
They share a look. It is very serious and intentional. Is it Sherlock’s imagination or is there heat in John’s eyes? He is certainly trying to keep it from his own. His hand is on John’s, holding it gently, though he does not remember putting it there. John’s hand is warm and soft. God, he wants to hold it forever. He wants to learn everything about this man, spend the rest of his life touching and holding and memorizing every inch, every thought, every dream he holds dear. It all comes upon him so suddenly that their one point of contact feels like the key to a secret door, opening and revealing a part of himself he never knew existed. Sherlock has never felt this way in his life. He had loved Victor, to be sure, but did not feel anything even close to this. It is amazing. And...Jesus Christ, he is completely fucked.
Without a word or thought, Sherlock lowers his head. His eyes slip closed and he just brushes his lips against John’s. The slightest touch, light as a feather and completely surreal. Sherlock’s entire body tingles with just that one touch. It starts at their lips and spreads through his chest, down his arms and legs to fingertips and toes. It. Is. Amazing. Glorious. Perfect.
Fear not, friends, he’ll get there. Even-tu-ally. Haha. You know it won't happen so easily. That is simply not the way I work. Do not doubt that I am still the Mistress of Villainy. Mwahahahaha!
Angelo catches sight of the tall coach and his doctor as soon as they enter the little restaurant. The robust man is at Sherlock’s side in an instant, throwing his arms around him like he would a son.
So I decided to go with the end of the chapter, the conversation between Sherlock and Greg. When I first typed it up, I thought it was really clunky and wasn’t sure I liked it, but when I read through it again and again, it fell into place. I hope you all think so too and get my choice of song.
Now, I know the BJ scene could be pretty controversial to some of you. I acknowledge that it has been a very short time since John's rape and realistically, not many people in his situation would find themselves in another sexual situation so quickly. What I'm trying to show here is how safe he feels with Sherlock and how much they love each other and how that love helps them both. They truly are two halves of the same whole and that means complete security and trust. In this specific case, those feelings are so strong for John that his hurt is taken away and he is free to be with Sherlock the way he wants to be again, even if only for a moment. I hope that makes sense, even if it's an old romantic notion. If not, please remember this is a work of fiction and as real as I want it to be, sometimes it may fall short. (But hopefully it's still good! ;D )
Sharp grey eyes study the five skaters as they race around the track. Wheels glide smoothly over concrete, one leg crossing over the other on the straight aways, knees bent to keep low around the turns. Bodies bent slightly at the waist and spines arched with shoulders back in perfect derby stance. They make each pass with ease and undeniable focus. Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody plays loudly from a portable speaker laying in the center of the track. A short woman off skates stands next to it with a timer, shouting out every minute as each one ticks away. The only other sounds that interrupt Freddie’s voice are the occasional cries of 5, 10, 15, as well as shouts of encouragement from the stationary skaters positioned around the inside of the track as they count their teammate’s laps.
John to be with Sherlock, to work himself back to as normal as he can be, also to finally get Moriarty.
“Piss off, Moran,” John barked, standing to his full height and entering the man’s personal space. Moran had a good six inches on him, but John did not give a shit. He never liked Moran. Part of John had always wanted to punch the sneer of a smile off his face, but he had avoided the temptation. John might just make an exception tonight.
“Not even a little,” John laughs quietly and watches his flatmate closely as he moves his hands over John’s feet carefully.
“No worries,” John’s hand is at the back of his neck again, his brows raised. “I guess I should call the police.”
“Oh. Are you finished?” John gestures out to the hall. “I can wait if you need more time. You could just give me a call.”
“Are you?” John narrows cold eyes at Mycroft and leaves the room, letting the door slam to punctuate his exit.
Sorry this is such a short chapter, y'all. I'm hoping to get the next one out faster now. I must say I'm having fun editing it, but...of course I won't say why.
When he returns this time, John is standing closer to the bed. He looks nervous, holding one hand in the other and wringing slightly. Sherlock smiles reassuringly, trying to ease John’s mind. He steps in close and drapes a thick dark green towel on the bed. When he stands straight again, he and John are face to face, inches apart. John’s mouth is open and he is breathing more heavily than he should be. His pupils seem even larger than before.
“John, you’re here,” Jim said in a pleased tone that would have fooled anyone else, but not John. Jim leaned in for a kiss, but John turned his head and angled away. Jim frowned and then shook it off, resuming his typical swagger. “Greg wasn’t sure he’d seen you.”
4) Will there be another attempt to sabotage Rock City and will they see it in time to save its target?
Feel strongly that I missed an essential question here? Feel free to post and let us all know what it is. I've always believed in expression. Express, not repress. Repression festers and leads to rotting of the soul. No good, no good. One day will find you smoking at a cafe and saying, "My ass is twitching. You people make my ass twitch."
Sherlock toes out of his shoes and pads into the bedroom where his bags still sit on the bed. He should shower after the day of traveling and practice, but it is late enough that he cannot bring himself to do it. His only desires are to change and fall into the covers. However, there is one thing he wants to do more. Sherlock sets the wine glass on a side table and unzips his rather large bag. He slips his violin case from it carefully and runs a hand over its smooth surface. Playing helps him relax, clears his mind of most things, like flights. He places it on the bed and turns his attention to the garment bag next to it. He takes out the suits and hangs them in the wardrobe. They are a bit wrinkled, but it is nothing his morning shower won’t fix. He has another sip of wine while changing into dark blue pajamas and then pulls on his favorite dressing gown of cobalt blue satin. The color actually reminds him of John’s eyes. He quickly shakes his head to free himself of that thought. Jesus, he’s like a lovesick adolescent.
She steps forward, undressing him with a fiery look. When her focus returns to his eyes, she is pleased to see they are focused on her bosom, but soon realizes they are looking at something lower.
Looking ahead, I've been trying to even out the ass worship. Really, I've tried, but I have to follow my heart. For those of you who have mentioned it, I concede defeat. I have been informed by a reliable source (not that you aren't all reliable, but I've known this source longer) that I have an ass fetish. .... I believe this to be true. But can you blame me? They're so delightful and round and perfect for my hand to hold. I wholeheartedly admit to ogling my husband's delectable ass at every opportunity. I admit it. I do.
“Indeed,” Sherlock admits after a beat. “Mary is one of our more aggressive players and not exclusively on the track. I’ve been expecting it.”
What he has told Sherlock about his romantic life is true. He has devoted no time to dating during his time in the States. He put little effort into it in the UK, to be honest, but had dated off and on in uni and medical school. He really only felt anything for two or three of them and none of those feelings came close to what he feels for Sherlock. It is… What is it? John is so confused, his head spinning. What does it mean when you don’t just want to spend the night with someone, but every day too? To talk to him and learn about him more than you want to sleep with him?
Thank you all for your love and support and feel free to let your emotions fly. I must confess, I'm especially interested in seeing if my good friends, Sherly and AGPatton will leave comments with tons of swears. I love those messages. Tee hee.
“Looks good,” John nods. They discuss the logistics a bit more and then both sip their forgotten drinks, satisfied with the plan. That is until John gives Sherlock that look. It’s the look John wears when he knows there is something else on Sherlock’s mind. His ability to know Sherlock so well is infuriating, especially when John himself remains a mystery so much of the time.
Sherlock closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose, his fingers resting precisely on the two little wrinkles that traverse the top of his nose when he furrows his brow. He sighs in both frustration and anger.
Hello, everyone! I know it's been a while AGAIN, but I've had a hard time editing this one. At long last, it is finished and I am excited to see what you all think of it. On a side note, it's been a shit week and posting this chapter makes me feel better - like I've managed to accomplish something. I hope you all enjoy it.
Sherlock’s misty grey eyes turn to stone and his jaw sets like iron. He doesn’t move a muscle and yet, he suddenly seems about ten feet tall and towering over John. Still, the compact doctor does not back down, straightening to his full height as well. Sherlock has a good six inches on him, but John still cuts an imposing figure.
“I go out on it all the time,” he says in a good-natured, if not breathless, tone. “Great way to spend the weekend. Sorry I haven’t invited you yet. I’ll give you the grand tour.”
* Where the bloody hell is Greg??  What or who is delaying him? Is it Sally? HAS she left the side of the angels as Purrfect suggested?
John purses his lips and just stops himself from saying what the fuck out loud, spelling his doom. Speaking of which, if he doesn’t get some air fucking now he is fucking dead. As if reading his mind, Greg takes the regulator from his mouth and holds it out to John. He nods at it urgently and pushes it closer. John does not need to be asked twice. He grabs the mask with both hands and shoves it in his mouth, inhaling deeply. Greg motions for him to go slowly and John nods. He breathes twice more as slowly as he can bear and offers it to Greg. He takes it for a few breaths and gives it back to John. As he breathes, Greg motions instructions that John interprets as they will continue swapping the mask until they hit lake bottom. At that point, Greg will cut John loose and they will take turns with the mask on the way up. Confident he understands the plan, John nods. Greg nods back with a tight-lipped smile.
Join me again, hopefully sooner rather than later, for the next chapter. Will there be any answers? Hmmm.
John stares up at the red roof of the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum in the late morning sun. It is a fairly small and unassuming home, but he cannot help wondering at what secrets it holds. He has bubbled with anticipation since he read the words “..walking into Poe’s Baltimore home is both disturbing and ethereal” on its website at breakfast. He had invited the skaters along, but they all had other plans already. So, here he is, standing before it alone.
“Um...sorry,” he huffs an embarrassed laugh. “My name is John Watson. I’m looking for Dr. William Wiggins.”
“We both went our separate ways once she graduated. Molly to Iowa because there was a derby program in athletics, not to mention the Old Capitol City team outside of the U, and I went to Wisconsin,” Sherlock pauses a moment to chew the bite waiting on his fork. John just sips his wine patiently. “She was recruited right out of school, as you know, and then negotiated her way back to Detroit, with Mrs. Hudson’s help.”
“I see the evidence no one else can,” Sherlock answered after a pause. “I make the connections immediately and tell the police what to do next, where to go. I read people.”
“I trust gut feelings. It’s what helped lead me to you. The team,” he corrects quickly when Sherlock’s eyes meet his and this time they are startled. “This man, what did he look like?”
Yes, I am the queen of torture and angst. My t-shirt is being made. I will promise you, my friends, promise you that there will be more of the same and it will be agonizing. Hopefully, not so much that you stop reading. Haha. I have to say that as I type each chapter and then edit, even I keep thinking "My god, stop. Just stahp!" It's going to be a wild ride, my friends, and one I hope you love.
“Sherlock, promise me.” John is in full Captain Watson mode now. “No unusually stupid risks or ducking out on me to go it alone. No drugs. I’ll know. You know I’ll know.”
Sherlock drapes a blanket around his shoulders and pulls a chair close to the bed to sit next to him, his perceptive gaze finally able to take in every detail of John’s form and condition. His bruised and lacerated wrists, bruised temple with a fresh wound that still slowly weeps a thin line of blood. He must get a cloth for that and some ice. That is when he sees it. The dark red soaking into the side of John’s shirt, on his torso and just under his right arm. It is easily overlooked since he is soaked to the bone and his shirt is such a dark blue that it looks black with all the water.
The detective’s cheeks color. He takes off his dressing gown and climbs under the covers, careful to stay on his side. Resting one hand over the other on his chest, he stares up at the ceiling for a moment before closing his eyes, ready to settle into his mind palace and try to understand the man sitting next to him. They snap open again and dart to John when he feels a hand on his shoulder. The doctor is smiling down at him warmly.
I love Sherlock and John in this one. Sherlock is so uncertain at times and then full of resolve. He loves John so much and makes it clear he will do anything for him, and to help him. Likewise with John trying to keep Sherlock from doing more than he's ready for. And their kissing and snuggling. They're adorable. Suffice it to say, I am full of warm fuzzies.
“What? Oh, right,” John says, regaining his focus. He starts for the bed, but stops. “Sorry, I can’t do this. I’ll ruin your sheets.”
of his past relationships have been exactly the same for him. However, his brain has seized because Sherlock used the word relationship. He said it like it is something he wants, like it is already a thing, a real thing. He says it like last night was not a one-off as John had feared. Still with his track record, Sherlock cannot possibly mean that. Maybe he actually hasn’t put everything together yet, in which case it is John’s duty to tell him.
“Then you won’t mind filling us in,” the stone-faced sergeant tells him, crossing his arms over his chest.
In the meantime, happy reading and have fun thinking about what the future holds for these two lovebirds.
“No,” she snorts and turns sideways so she can see him fully, “it was time to switch to the next center.”
Thank you again for all your love and support! I hope you loved this chapter and enjoy the ones to come.
As if on cue, Angelo reappears and insists they owe him nothing when they try to pay. The three men debate it all the way to the door, which Angelo unlocks to let them out. John and Sherlock finally concede and say goodnight as they step out onto the sidewalk. Soon they are walking to John’s car in a comfortable silence.
John just presses his lips together into a thin line and grumbles nearly inaudibly. He has no business being jealous. No place warding others away from Sherlock as though he were his. Sure, they spent the night together, that annoying voice in the back of his mind reminds him. They had sex, but that does not mean they are together. It does not mean Sherlock wants to do it again. They are able to step back into their lives and friendship seamlessly. This little jaunt proves it. There is no awkwardness between them, just some initial misunderstanding and then back to their kind of normal. If John is honest with himself, he has never felt so comfortable with anyone in his life. Not even Bill, and that realization strikes him with the force of a bullet.
And there you have it, friends. How can two blokes be so lucky and so unlucky at the same time? One of these days, they'll stop being kidnapped, nearly drowned, shot, strangled, stabbed, and all the rest of it. BUT not until they retire. At least, not in my book. Heh heh heh.
“Sorry, sorry,” John blurted, opening his eyes to see that Sherlock had perched himself on the bar stool next to him. He seemed to have finished sizing John up and also appeared to have no intention of leaving. “I was… It’s nice to meet you.”
“Oh my god,” John snorts, rocking back and forth. “I can’t believe you and Molly got away with that! Did he ever show up at your house and tell your parents?”
Sherlock nods, giving John’s arm a tight squeeze as he pushes him off the track and towards the exit. John understands, gives Sherlock a tight smile and jogs after Smacks.
4) Just what is going to make it a "long night"? Mayhem and disaster? Dancing and sexytimes? Are you all biting your thumbs in excitement? (infamous eyebrow waggle)
“Jesus, Sherlock,” Greg’s voice is full of shocked disbelief. “Do you think Harry will be targeted again?”
They all raise their hands collectively in a gesture of power, their faces already in triumph as if by the power of Greyskull, they have the power! Their hands drop with the kind of assertiveness held only by a true badass who knows
Minutes later, they stand at the door to Sherlock’s suite. Neither has said a word and Sherlock feels like a complete idiot. Why the hell did he think
4. Which song lyrics will be featured in the next chapter, I wonder? Any guesses? No, they are not all from Queen, but they do always pertain to the chapter in some way.
“Yeah,” John croaks, swallowing hard. Visibly forcing his muscles to relax, he shakes away his feelings and gives Sherlock a kind of uncertain smile. “Yeah, I’m good. It was all good. Greg found me before I…”
“Yes,” Sherlock’s eyes go out of focus, gazing passed him in distraction, in thought. A glint of realization in them. “And what better way to hurt me?”
* Where is Greg? What is he doing? The poor man needs some time to himself, but will he get it or will someone interrupt it?
“Sure,” Greg answered after a pause with a look that told John he wanted to say more. He knew John and the whole situation far too well.
When we last left our intrepid duo, the villainous Justin Giles had kidnapped Sherlock by mistake and dumped him in a flooded out cove. Will John and company get to him in time??
John merely made a suggestion and Sherlock agreed. He did not ask him out. Just because Sherlock is going to his favorite restaurant with a gorgeous man does not mean…
“And many more lives saved,” Greg reached over the bar to pat John’s shoulder. “You’re a credit to the profession.”
Heh heh. You all knew John was on the hit list after what happened with Billy, yikes! A man dressed in black lurking in his flat, waiting to kill him? That's a few steps up from poisoning. And how about our John, eh? Even without the military background, he has mad skillz. But can he do it a second time? Can he do the same for Sherlock once he gets to his condo? Wait, wait! I'm getting ahead of myself, which can mean only one thing. Question time!
Upon their arrival at the hotel, the ladies head up to their rooms to stow their gear and meet back in the bar for a drink or two.
“I suppose so,” he reflects, “but I would never have called it that at the time. Molly joined the derby class when she started high school. Coach Jones offered it after school, unofficially, of course. I think he only did it because Detroit has two teams, and because he liked it. Midway through the year, and at Molly’s urgence,  he let me join in coaching. I took a year of community college for Molly’s senior year so we could keep training.”
“Sherlock?” he sort of half calls. His voice sounds frighteningly loud in the quiet flat. John walks quietly into the room and surveys the area. Finding no one, he walks toward the bed and bathrooms. The hair on his arms and the back of his neck is standing, the sense of foreboding growing with every step he takes. He curses himself silently for leaving his gun up in his room. He stills again just beside the formal loo. He glances ahead to the open door of Sherlock’s bedroom, listening intently for the noise he heard to come again. It’s from the loo and sounds like labored breathing, a bitten-off moan. Tensing his body for a fight, John  takes another step toward the doorway, jerking to a stop when he hears a quiet shuffle.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up, making them sparkle a decidedly silver sheen and a brilliant smile spread across his full lips. He offered a hand and John took it, allowing himself to be led onto the floor. As they found a place within the other bodies around them, piano chords rang out through the club and a pure tone began to sing lyrics so ironic that John could not help but smile.
I want to thank you all again for all your support, and to apologize for not getting this chapter out before now. I have been in a bad way the last couple days and working on this, while on the forefront of my mind, was not something I could do. I hope for better days ahead and a little bonus time with the holiday. I appreciate everyone sticking it out and hope you continue to do so.
“No,” Billy sighs. John feels himself deflating and he cannot hide his disappointment. Billy shakes his head. “I could easily see there were more injuries than usual. It was as plain as the nose on your face. Didn’t really occur to me that it could be anything other than a series of unfortunate accidents until Molly brought it up.”
“I couldn’t sleep anyway. And besides…” he rises and steps around the desk, wrapping his long arms around John’s body, hands resting on his hips. “I like you in my bed.”
“Careful, Watson,” Billy says in a quiet, warning tone. “There are some things one should stay away from. Leave it be.”
6. Why doesn't this fic warn readers that it's slowburn torture? Haha! Did you notice? I added it. I am much too clever for you naughty people. Heehee.
“We both finished in two years and got jobs. I started teaching at Stanford and Victor joined the family business practicing law,” Sherlock sighs in resignation at the memories. “He was expected to attend a lot of formal functions and parties, and needed someone attractive and poised on his arm. I fit the bill, but he wanted someone with no life of his own and nothing to do but help him look good. What Victor wanted was a trophy wife and I did
“He must tell you who shot him so measures may be taken,” Mycroft squares his shoulders and says forcefully. John just looks back at him with an angry smile.
“John,” he says quietly as he approaches the doctor. John looks up and Sherlock offers one of the two coffee cups in his hands. “Just the way you like it.”
She begins slowly sliding his hand upward, but he immediately pulls it away and takes the barest of steps back before bumping into his own desk.
“Saving her is reason enough to eliminate you,” Sherlock finishes for him as it begins to snap into place. John must believe the same because he is already nodding. “It’s Moriarty. It has to be.”
going back in the water. He heaves himself up so his head pops up over the side and he can see in the boat. The sight that greets him is a rather disheveled Sherlock, with hands in the air, standing over a prostrate and tightly bound James Moriarty. John’s eyes widen at the blood spattered across Sherlock’s shirt, but he quickly determines that it is not his.
Here's your chapter before the weekend, as promised. I don't know what time it is where all of you are, but it isn't quite midnight here so this totally counts. i hope you like this one. A a couple of parts really tugged at my heart strings. I think you know which ones.
Sherlock forces his drooping eyelids to open again and renews his hold on Moriarty’s wrists. He twists his legs out from under the man and wraps them around his waist, rocking from one side to the other. Moriarty frantically tries to stop him as he gains the momentum he needs to switch their positions. Moriarty squeezes Sherlock’s neck with his fingers, bruising it with an iron grip. Sherlock clenches his jaw and rocks harder, faster until they flip over completely. Moriarty finally releases Sherlock’s throat as their bodies roll. He thrashes his arms, trying to grab anything he can to keep Sherlock beneath him, but fails and falls flat on his back. His left hand crashes to the deck with a loud thud and a spike of pain that has him crying out. Both men glance toward it to see that his knuckles struck the flare gun that went flying when Moriarty attacked Sherlock.
I hope no one minds another chapter coming out so quickly. This is a shorter one and, sorry, no spoilers.
As a friend said, "John cuddled him! John fucking...[cuddled him]!" He loves him so much and Sherlock knows it. Sherlock heard him say it, but just can't believe John would still love him if he knew everything about their past. And yet, every time John learns something new, something big, he has not turned away from Sherlock. I mean, remembering your best friend destroyed you by faking his own death is huge! Add his sister being your shooter, nearly killing you. WTF, Watson. Why aren't you running away?
“Sorry. I’m sorry,” Greg says quickly, biting his lip. “I wasn’t expecting that. Who would expect that? You could’ve given me some warning.”
“You usually leave with Greg,” it was not a question, but John’s voice rose with it as though it was. His Machiavellian expression made sure Sherlock understood his meaning, the underlying question in John’s uttered statement. The man was completely unphased by John’s directness, smiling and huffing a quiet laugh as he threw a handful of pretzels in his mouth.
Hello, hello, my friends! I’m so sorry it’s been so long since our last meeting. God, I’ve missed you all. It’s been a hell of a couple of weeks, but all is well. I hope this finds all of you well too. I’m sorry to have left you dangling over the cliff all this time. Trust me when I say it was not intentional. Please forgive me. I certainly can’t wait for you all to read this next, long-awaited chapter, so I’ll get right down to it after I thank my wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter. She brings out the best in me and words cannot express my gratitude.
2. Why didn't he tell him right then and there instead of just saying thank you?? And, WTF, John? 'Thank you'?!? I know, I know, he saved your life. Well, technically Greg saved your life, but 'thank you'??!!
“Christ, Sherlock, it’s not important,” John grumbles. He is weary and frustrated, his face scrunched up and lips pursed. “It’s just grazed. Just...stay here. With me. Please.”
“I’m sure Martha took that into consideration when she hired him, Sherlock. No one wants another situation like Anderson. We can thank him for opening all our eyes, the bastard.”
“A surgeon, in fact and a skilled one at that. You consult with patients, who appreciate your bedside manner, but are also the first they call for emergencies,” Sherlock paused, looking more comfortable and resolute. He pressed on. “As a result, you spend a great deal of time at the hospital. St. Bart’s.”
“I should be the one apologizing, John. I am seldom able to deduce you so fully and when I finally could, I got carried away. It was stupid and an obviously very painful part of your past. I’m sorry,” Sherlock says in a rush, his voice flustered. He bites his lower lip and looks at John with nervous eyes.
“Typical,” John continues, frowning and feeling grumpy. “You haven’t heard a thing I’ve said. And you’re looking at me like…”
“John,” Greg begins, his voice filled with sincerity, “there are so many things you don’t know yet. A lot has changed.”
Sherlock lifted John’s hand high to draw him in and used his other hand to guide John into a quick turn so his back ended up flush against the front of Sherlock’s body. John pulled Sherlock’s hand down and caught hold of the other one too. As the music swelled, John rested their hands on his hips and they ground together, bending their knees a bit and inching down lower. John tilted his head back to rest on Sherlock’s shoulder, closed his eyes and nearly moaned.
He is about to walk up the small wooden staircase at its entrance when he becomes aware of a presence to his right. He turns quickly and comes face to face with a hesitant Sherlock Holmes, shifting his feet and looking at John with a face full of uncertainty.
“Yes, I know,” Sherlock’s lips curled upward as his eyes studied, no read John’s face. John felt like this clever man could read his entire life with a simple glance, much less the current scrutiny. John stared like a moron as his mind caught up with the situation at hand and he closed his eyes in regret. He had just spluttered the most idiotic introduction to a man who already knew his name. God, he was so stupid.
John’s laughter died in his throat. He looked at Sherlock in shock and Sherlock thought his chin might actually hit the floor.
“Go on,” John prompted casually, trying only a little to hide his excitement at what Sherlock might say next. His words seemed to settle something inside of Sherlock and he continued.
John Watson stands in front of a quaint house wondering what the fuck he’s doing there. It’s been two weeks since his first day in the stadium. Fourteen days since he spoke with Molly Hooper about her suspicions. It has been in the back of his mind ever since as he has read medical records in his office, spoken to the skaters in the exam and training rooms, and even while making dinner or reading a book in his flat. It is especially on his mind while he watches the ladies practice and god, he cannot believe how hard they hit on the track. He has seen hockey players crumple under hits like these and they are covered with pads. Frankly, John is surprised there are not more injuries throughout the year, especially since these are only the practices.
“You can always join a gym,” Sherlock suggests. As he works, he takes notice of the wound’s odd shape and angle. It is oddly familiar and yet, like none he has ever seen before, and he has seen quite a bit throughout his ten years in derby. This is different. What kind of object would make a mark like this?
“Why can’t he, Sherlock?” he asks with a sly look in his eye. Sherlock stares a moment longer and then shakes his head dismissively, resuming the pacing. “He’s a great guy.”
John looks at the man standing before him and suddenly it occurs to him that he has never actually seen Sherlock like this before. Even in a month of time here, he has always seen him in the gym shorts, tees and bandanas from practice. No one in meetings minds what he is wearing because he usually has afternoon practice post-meeting anyway. Why change?
Why had he left like that? People say John is brilliant and Sherlock is very much his intellectual equal, if not more so. His ability to strategize and calculate is amazing, and John still wants to learn more about his mind palace. Surely he deduced John’s inability to love as soon as he learned of Claire. John had told him. He told him he didn’t love her, couldn’t love her. Couple that with the stories of his other relationships and Sherlock would know that a relationship with John is the worst mistake he could ever make. John’s breath leaves him in a rush. He simply cannot bear the thought. He wants to
Hey, everybody! Let me draw your attention to the number of chapters. It has increased to 10 and may just end up being 11 before I'm through. It sure is shaping up to be a great part in this series though. I'm so excited for all of you to read the rest!
To that end, I am not opposed to the idea and I am still editing, but the story is what it is. I wrote it the way I wanted and with what felt right at the time. If I think something is missing as I edit, I will change it, but I make no promises. I appreciate everyone's comments and suggestions, I truly do. Just promise me that whatever direction I take, you will not question the depth of John's love for Sherlock. He most assuredly loves him with all his heart and soul. If you want to think of it in terms of the show (i.e. The Fall), John would absolutely die for Sherlock if it meant protecting him from harm. Need proof? Go back to chapters 1 and 2. He already died for him once. Oops. Did I say once? ONLY once?
Before I get started taunting you all, I want to thank my always wonderful beta, MyBreadAndButter. She is The Best and always ups my game. I have been scared shitless to release the last two chapters, but I'm feeling good about this one. I think I'm finally getting the hang of having someone else's input. Haha. It's been a learning process in many ways and I'm glad MyBAB convinced me to give it a try.
“You come here often,” Sherlock stated, his eyes sharp. Goddamn if he did not have the longest lashes John had ever seen.
“She says he trusts me,” John gives a half laugh and turns his head away from the older man. He can feel an unexpected low burning anger in his gut, though it is not directed toward Billy. He continues, suspicious and spiteful. “I suppose I should believe her since they’re thick as thieves. There’s something going on between them.”
John is in Sherlock’s condo, standing in right front of him in nothing but a pair of boxer shorts and a t-shirt. A somewhat clingy t-shirt at that. One that hugs every curve and muscle and dries Sherlock’s mouth in an instant. As he swallows hard, he notices the dark red stain of blood on the tee’s shoulder right at the top of John’s arm.
“What?” she steps back to give him more room, completely thrown off by his remark. Mary peers down to see what he is referring to. “Oh, that’s nothing. Happened a few days ago in practice. What
“Holmes,” the man supplied when John paused, the dramatic effect it created not lost on either of them.
Sherlock’s lips quirk up at the corners. He looks down again at the candle flickering on the table between them.
He pulls on his jacket and closes the office door after they are both through. The two men walk side by side down the hall. Having regained his typical ease and confidence, Sherlock looks sideways at John with a smirk on his lips.
“Oh my god,” he rolls his eyes before fixing Greg with a glare and pointing an accusatory finger. “We must find out all we can. If he touches anyone on the team…”
John smiles to himself as he sips tea. Having just shared a cuppa and lovely chat with Mrs. Hudson, before they realized the time and she had to dash off, John poured himself the last cup and has been deep in thought ever since. Three weeks have passed since their last confrontation about Sherlock’s nightmares. He and Sherlock have tried a few different tacts John has learned over time. The first week was hard to get through, but the last two have passed without event. John isn’t entirely sure if that is because there have been no nightmares or because Sherlock has managed not to wake him. Either way, John has every intention of discussing it when Sherlock returns from the case he’s working with Greg.
“Oh? Hasn’t Mrs. Hudson taken good care of you?” he teases, casting a mischievous grin at the older woman.
“Because there are more important matters at hand,” Sherlock bends at the knees for emphasis with all-out annoyance on his features. “As soon as he gets home tonight, he’ll start asking questions and what am I supposed to say? Greg was surprised I’d let you live with me because I ‘like you’? Jesus Christ!”
“There was poison in her system, Greg. A lot of it,” John interjects. “There’s no way it could’ve gotten there without someone administering it.”
“Oh, Sherlock, I couldn’t,” John starts, raising a hand in protest. Sherlock silently blows out a breath of relief that he has skirted the line and John has not taken offense. He shrugs, his confidence returning.
3) John is very obviously confused, caught between feeling his love for Sherlock and not knowing what the hell it is. IS HE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT? IN THIS LIFETIME? Because Goddammit, Jane, how much can the heart take?
“Sherlock?” John whispers, bringing the man back to himself. John looks worried, his pupils already shrinking. “Are you okay?”
Hello, my friends! I’m back and I’m sorry to have kept you all waiting so long. I didn’t expect shit to go right off the rails and get so off schedule. I’m afraid chapter 18 will have to wait as well. It won’t be anywhere near ready this weekend, so I will post it next weekend. I should even have extra time over the holiday. Yay! I’m sorry I couldn’t keep everything on track and hope you’ll forgive me. It's been a tricky couple of weeks.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter and the next. Also, I have been receiving notifications again, so I'm hoping the system has been restored and you're all getting them again too. Much love, Jane
“Affair with a colleague,” Sherlock said by way of explanation. “Her husband won’t grow facial hair and she likes the way it feels on her nether regions.”
They watched as the man leaned in for a gentle kiss that she reciprocated. The couple appeared to be very taken with one another, very much in love, not desperate to get out of the club and into bed like new lovers. As if reading his mind, Sherlock leaned in to whisper in John’s ear.
Thank you all for reading and loving. You all mean so much to me. I love writing. I'd write no matter what, but knowing that I'm bringing joy to others is the greatest reward. Thank you all.
6. Are we going to get the happy ending we all want or are you going to go all Lady Jane of Angst and Pain on us and make a sequel to this one where they finally get together in the midst of some other mystery? HOLY SHIT, JANE, DON'T DO THAT!!!
“I’m sorry,” he says again, hoping his tone conveys the depth of his feeling. He does not want to lose this friendship. He cannot lose it. He watches Sherlock for any sign of forgiveness and, to his relief, he sees the coach’s grey eyes soften and his annoyance fading.
“Well, put me on,” Greg ignores his admonishment. “I want to go over the plan for tonight. I assume John is with you.”
“Six weeks?!” Sherlock bellows. John squares his shoulders and prepares for a fight, ready to defend his position to the end. But Sherlock surprises him, his expression becoming less angry and more thoughtful.
The wrinkle between Sherlock’s eyes deepens as he studies John. The corners of his mouth turn down as he searches John’s face and cocks a brow.
John considers his dinner with Mary as he cleans his teeth. He supposes it would be easy for her to misjudge the detective. After all, John himself thought he was an ass when he first met him. An incredibly intriguing and sexy ass, but an ass nonetheless. The corners of his mouth curl upward as he thinks back on that day in Molly’s lab when Mike Stamford introduced him to the great Sherlock Holmes. It was all so coincidental, so perfect. Meeting the exact man he needed to meet at the exact moment he needed him. So much like the fate Sherlock doesn’t believe in. John looks at himself in the mirror for a moment and then leans forward to spit into the sink.
John huffs and rolls his eyes before he can stop himself. He has largely kept his jealousy to himself. At least, he hopes Sherlock has not picked up on it. He has given no indication, but the git probably noticed the moment the woman began talking.
“I have...an uneasy feeling,” Sherlock pauses and swallows. He should feel like an idiot, citing anything as irrational as sentiment as a basis for suspicion, but it is a feeling he cannot shake. Something is not right in Baltimore.
A few minutes later, far fewer than they would have liked, the boat docks next to the police boat at the Metropark marina. When John and Sherlock emerge from below deck with Riley in the lead, the police are already interviewing witnesses from other boats. Moriarty and Moran are formally arrested and bundled into a patrol car. Two paramedics approach John for a look at his wounds as Riley removes the handcuffs from both he and Sherlock at Budreau’s orders. Apparently, Greg has given the man enough evidence to believe their story. Sherlock is the only reason the growingly irritable doctor walks to the back of the ambulance without incident. One of them begins packing off the gunshot wound, even as the other argues with John about an impending trip to the ER because stitching is not something they do on the scene.
“What? I didn’t catch that,” he straightens again and glares at the taller man. “Oh, are you angry because I had the balls to call you out? I don’t know how the others can ignore it like they do. Are you so important to the team that it doesn’t matter?”
“Surprised, dear? I do listen to your rants, you know. ‘You see, but do not observe’. I’m excited to see if you meet your match in him.”
As trite as it may sound, I mean that as much as I mean this.. Keep your stick on the ice. We're all in this together.
When he turns to John again, he means to speak, but the words die in his throat and come out as more of a gasp. John is just pulling the t-shirt over his head, tousling his blonde hair as it sweeps past it. He drops it on the bed next to him and looks at Sherlock expectantly, but the coach just gapes. John is gorgeous. His sun-kissed skin looks smooth and almost silky, stretching over his pectorals to his shoulders and down over the mostly defined muscles of his abdomen. There is not a single hair on his broad chest and his nipples are peaking from the slight chill in the air conditioned room. He looks like an underwear model and Sherlock’s mind floods with ways to worship every inch of his body.
Btw, I'm pretty sure there's a pretty glaring spelling error somewhere in the second half, but I couldn't find it when I read through again. I may have corrected it, but I still might have missed it. My apologies.
This was a fun chapter to write. I thoroughly enjoyed making Greg get a little more drunk with each shot. He's still making sense, but his words start to be just a bit out of order and make a little less sense. Picturing Rupert this way gave me the giggles every time. I also loved writing the more touching dialogue in the latter half. I know romance may not be some people's cup of tea, but I love it, especially between these two idiots. So precious.
“Someone tried to poison him to get him to leave and now as soon as you have another competent doctor, someone tries to kill him? No,” John shakes his head. “It’s too damn coincidental.”
“I know,” Greg meets his eyes and then John’s with a very serious gaze. “So we keep our eyes and ears open. If something’s going on, we’ll see it. I know you have it all stored in that brain of yours. Have all the accidents in the past been against the Demons?”
“No,” John breathed. He shook his head slightly, staring at Sherlock agog. His mouth hung open a moment longer before stretching into a smile. “That was...amazing.”
“Who was it, John?” his tone is soft, but firm. Sherlock has not heard anything quite like it from his own lips before. He wonders silently at this man’s power over him and wishes he had some,
“Neither does eating,” Angelo reminds knowingly. Is it Sherlock’s imagination or did John just glance at his slender frame? Probably thinks he is too thin like everyone else, Sherlock thinks as he shakes it off.
John purses his lips, raises his brows and tilts his head to the side in both a thoughtful gesture and one that acquiesces the point. Sherlock leans closer and rests his hand on John’s thigh, just under the wound. He watches John’s face as he glances down at Sherlock’s hand and then lifts his gaze to look at the coach full in the face. His features are wary, but otherwise unreadable. Sherlock squares his jaw. Nothing is going to keep him from finding the truth.
Greg leaned in and rested his own elbow on the bar’s top as John took a quick sip from his drink. The burn as it slipped down his throat punctuated his mood. He had been in this situation many times before, waiting at the bar with Greg while his boyfriend remained absent, but John would damned if he let it ruin his evening this time. When Greg continued speaking, John made a concerted effort to improve his own disposition.
“Ass,” John accuses playfully from atop Sherlock’s chest. The coach wriggles beneath his body to no avail. He places his hands on John’s hips and then slides them a few inches up John’s sides. Sherlock’s breath hitches and he blinks once. His nerves are somewhere between disbelief and sheer panic. If they keep this up his body is going to react in a way he cannot easily hide from John. He must end this here and now before he gives away everything.
“He is concerned she will discover his suspicions about the company and Lennon and dump him,” he finished triumphantly. “There’s more, of course, but those are the highlights.”
John looks up in surprise at the sound of his first name. Billy is wearing a decisive expression and nodding his head slowly.
“No, you’re right. I’m sorry,” the doctor interrupts, taking a step away from the door. “I apologize for the hour, but I just got a message from Mike.”
John flounders and then jerks hard to one side. Unfortunately, he tips right over the edge of the couch and brings Sherlock with him. His back thuds onto the floor loudly, the taller man thumping down on top of him.
“You would have avoided speaking entirely if it were possible,” Sherlock huffed, aggravation pulsing off of him in waves.
I know you're all suspicious, trying not to be lulled into all this bliss because I, the Evil JaneOfCakes, always end things with drama and devastation. "I will not be fooled, Jane!!" I can hear you say. You know I don't like to give anything away, but....you all may be right.
Sherlock is perched on the edge of his seat now. His fingers are nearly touching John’s thigh where he grips the bedclothes tightly. He watches the doctor carefully as John squints and screws up his face in concentration. After a moment, John lets his features relax and looks at Sherlock almost sadly.
He lets his voice trail off and when he turns back to John again, the smaller man is very close, right up in his business close. Sherlock’s stance falters, but he holds his ground. John is staring up at him intensely. He squares his shoulders and looks every bit the military captain he was before being wounded.
“More to Greg’s point,” Sherlock finally speaks again, “what guarantee do we have that this Watson won’t show the same disregard for ethics that Anderson did?”
“Hey, Bossman,” a man named Roland called from down the bar. Greg and John looked his way immediately to see a bottle in each of his hands and people crowding the opposite side of the bar. “Give us a hand, mate.”
I want to draw your attention to the increase in chapters. Twelve will be the final number. And the number that will be counted is twelve. Thirteen is right out. And so is eleven, unless it be followed by twelve. (Mwahahaha! You guessed it. I'm in a mood again.)
His head snaps up at the light tap on his door as it opens. Sherlock’s eyes are wide again and he swallows audibly as John steps in with a warm smile on his face.
As they talk with Greg, John holds on to the hope that he and Sherlock can resume their conversation, but it is all in vain. By the time they are finished, John and Sherlock have just enough time to rush back to the hotel for a change of clothes, to collect the ladies and their gear, and hop the bus for the night’s venue. The ladies are scheduled for an extended warm-up before they take the track and Sherlock insists on keeping a schedule once he has made it. For his part, John tries to stay focused, but cannot get Sherlock’s last two words out of his mind.
“Merry Christmas, Sherlock,” John blinks slowly and curses himself internally for losing his nerve. He’s Captain John fucking Watson. What the fuck.
“And would this ‘something else’ be a relationship?” he shakes his head, “No, Dr. Watson. Caring is not an advantage and my brother knows it. All hearts are broken.”
John returns Sherlock’s gaze, determined not to look anywhere but at the man’s face no matter how much he wants to. He opens his mouth to speak and the action is too much, as his eyes betray him and glance down at that mouth. Sherlock steps impossibly close, cups his hands around John’s cheeks, and swoops in.
BAHAHAHAHA! If you've seen DP, you know what that means. Tee hee. As another aside, but to all of you, my 5 year old loves DP because he loves unicorns just like she does. Hahahahaha! Crying! (And no, she has never seen the movie. She only knows what I tell her and has seen his pic and merch EVERYWHERE. And she knows how much Mommy loves him.  ;D  )
“I’ve gotten to know all of the ladies a bit in the last month, had lunches with Greg and Mike and other staffers, but I know virtually nothing about you.”
“Good. We’ll be off then. Best, Dr. Watson,” Budreau acknowledges John as he turns to leave. The doctor replies with a ta and the sergeant begins to walk away, but stops suddenly and looks back at them. “Take the championship. The Rockets are looking to kick you off the throne.”
“Maybe,” Billy replies thoughtfully. He gives John a look and narrows his eyes. “You have met Sherlock?”
“My pleasure, Captain,” Harry salutes and skates to the outside edge of the track with a broad grin on her face.
Thank you ALL for your love and support! It has meant more to me recently than ever before. I won't bore you with my own struggles, but having you all around has made all the difference. Thank you!
“I promise,” he smiles, leaning down to kiss her cheek. She kisses his too and smiles sleepily up at him.
“Do you?” John asks thoughtfully. “God, I need to get myself a real place. Having my own equipment would be perfect.”
“Shit,” John’s voice draws Sherlock’s eye and pulls him from his thoughts. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that the way it sounded.”
“Yeah,” he replied in an even tone, not wanting to fully broadcast his irritation. Greg was perceptive though and John knew it. Damn that man learned too much about people’s tells in all his years of bar tending. “He called me at work and wanted to meet here. We’ve not seen much of each other lately.”
So, on with the story. The shit’s finally hitting the fan and John just went over the side of The Crown. Aahhhhh, JAWN! Save him, Sherlock! SAVE HIM! (Don't you fuck with us, Jane. Save our John Watson.)
“Who is Mary Morstan?” John asks breathlessly. He knows, but there’s so much he doesn’t. He needs to know.
Lead jammer - the jammer who breaks through the pack first (no points are scored on the initial break through. The lead jammer controls the jam and can call it off at any time, unless in the penalty box.
“They were hit on patrol and pinned down for hours,” he sounds distant and still stares straight ahead. He looks as though he can somehow visualize the scene, like he was the lone witness who could do nothing. Sherlock inhales sharply when John’s elbow leans into his touch with all its weight. He can feel John’s pain as acutely as if it is his own. John finally looks at him with watery eyes haunted by sorrow and guilt.
Sherlock lurches at Greg and stops inches from him. Looking down at the GM, eyes still blazing, he paints a frightening picture. In spite of it, Greg stands his ground and looks directly in the face of the taller man.
Sherlock made no reply and simply watched as John lowered his eyes to the floor. Damn it, John wanted to go with this man. He needs to go with this man, but it would not be right. Oh, fuck it all. Fuck Jim and whatever he may think. He was always sneaking around with Moran anyway. Let him think John was sneaking around for a change.
“It’s where we’re similar. You see, I haven’t been here long, but I’ve grown quite fond of the ladies. I’ll do whatever I need to protect them. And you.”
Now, a little house-keeping. I'd like to draw your attention to the number of chapters again. It hasn't changed, but I think it just might before this is all over. It's likely to become eleven or twelve chapters. I'll keep you updated. I'm not sure if this will continue to happen in subsequent parts or not. We'll all see together. If nothing else, it just gives you more chapters to love. :)
Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes at Greg’s big-brother overtones. The call ends just as the cab pulls up to the hospital. Sherlock pays the driver and walks swiftly into the building. He makes a few polite inquiries into John and Janine’s whereabouts, resisting the urge to snap at every person in his way. Taking a quick detour to stop at the hospital coffee shop, he ultimately pushes into the day of surgery waiting room. John is alone, save a couple mumbling in low tones to one another in the corner.
Running out of patience and full to the brim with concern for John, who seems more and more wobbly by the minute, Sherlock opens his mouth to unleash some scathing deductions about the Budreau’s wife
2. Who the hell did he call on his cell? Seems Sherlock may have been right about a hired killer. (Shit, that was an answer. I just can't help myself.)
Question time, my friends! Couldn't get a better lead in to it and I'll start with the question first and foremost on all our minds.
So, when we last left our boys they were snuggling and cute in Sherlock’s bed. Awwww. Prior to this bliss, however, John had resigned verbally to Greg and tried to do the same with Sherlock, but the stubborn coach would have none of it. John was soon confessing all that had happened in Baltimore after the team had left. They went home and began to hash out a strategy.
And then John says no. AH! Gut-wrenching! And why? Why?!? I hope you can all understand John's reasoning and don't hate him...or me.
“Since he graduated,” Mrs. Hudson agrees, clearly enjoying the conversation. “Charles resigned shortly thereafter and relocated to the United States for the derby. They kept making jokes about John driving him out of the university with his shenanigans.”
That was all Moriarty had gotten out of his mouth before Sherlock hit him and the same white hot fury streams through his veins now. Sherlock yanks Moriarty onto his back by his lapels and throws a leg over his body to make sure he stays down.
But now he is wearing sleek black trousers and a bespoke, white button-down with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, like some sort of well-dressed scientist about to begin an experiment. All he needs are goggles. And speaking of eyes, dark brown curls fall artfully around them, setting off pale skin and sharp cheekbones. John blinks once at this sight he has never before seen. He had not even considered what Sherlock’s hair might look like, always hidden under black, blue or dark purple bandanas. Never in his life would he have imagined what stands before him now and that is the precise moment that John realizes how little he knows about this man. Where did he come from? How did he get here? What exactly is his connection to Molly Hooper? Mrs. Hudson told him a lot during the conference, but it still seems like so little now when he suddenly wants to know everything about Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you ALL for reading and caring. Please, please send comments if you'd like. I love reading them! They can be about the story, the weather, ideas, speculations of what might happen further on in the story, whatever. I love connecting with people and feel very connected to all of you. Just making someone happy with each chapter I post is the most awesome feeling ever. You all are my lifeline. <3
Do I try to find something to go with John and Sherlock telling Greg what’s been going on, but how hard is that? Believe me, HARD. I kept looking at songs that give you courage to go into the breach, as it were, but nothing fit. At all.
“I know, I just…” Sherlock finally met her eyes again. “I swore off that sort of sentiment after Victor. You know that. Caring about someone that deeply is not an advantage.”
