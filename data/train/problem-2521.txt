Sherlock scoffed, “I know you’re used to taking charge in your relationships, but that really isn’t necessary, and I’d hate to have to prove that.”
For lack of a better term, Sherlock understood that John was out of his league. John could do better and deserved better, so why did he find Sherlock to be attractive? The genius could not understand.
Sherlock didn't realize he had grown quiet and slipped into his mind palace, but John did. If anything, John found it to be more amusing than annoying or rude. He smiled to himself and flipped through his newspaper, softly humming to himself.
“You crazy bastards did it..” He said with a breathy laugh and shock in his tone. The three men looked at each other and started laughing together. It could have been the adrenaline, the fear, the shock, or maybe they truly did find this rather amusing, but no matter what they tried they couldn’t seem to stop the laughter.
“Yes.” He spoke and looked back towards Sherlock.
“Of course it’s serious! I wouldn’t have rushed you here if this was a mere threat. Most of Central London fell thirty minutes ago. We are in a state of emergency and this time I don’t think there is a way to stop it.” His tone was full of defeat, his body language showed clearly he felt at blame.
“Thank you.. Hell I don’t even know your name!” He stated seeming rather alarmed at this strangers kindness.
“Mike told me that the suicides were linked to whatever this is.” He motioned at the screen.
“You okay?” The silver haired man leaned in close and whispered in Sherlock’s ear, his warm breath on his neck causing a shiver. He nodded in response.
The car ride to his brothers residence was long and filled with overwhelming silence and confusion, but it was thankfully over. The car pulled through the high front gates of the mansion his brother lived in, a loud squeaking as they closed behind them. The driveway was long and winding, trees everywhere across the property. In the three hour drive Sherlock had formulated many questions. He had periodically been checking his phone for any news updates on what his brother had been talking about. Everything seemed pure radio silence which was all the more unnerving.
“What do you see?” Sherlock was hoping John picked up on what he had.
“What is it?” Sherlock inquired but received no response. Before he could press farther an alarmed Mrs. Hudson burst through the open door and ran to embrace Sherlock. His body went rigid before he relaxed into the hug.
John plunged his hunting knife into the back of the dead man’s head that had been reaching out towards him. His dark eyes looked at Sherlock inquisitively, but Sherlock didn’t let his eyes wander from the dead woman crawling towards his feet. Her arm was outstretched. She had clear silver lines across both arms visible from under her ripped shirt sleeves. She struggled with mental health, from the looks of the healing wounds she had only stopped at most three years prior to this moment. Sherlock’s hands unconsciously moved to his own covered arms where there was an array of scars, mostly needle marks. Her style of clothing reminded him of how is own mother dressed through his childhood. That seemed such a distant and impossible memory now. The joys of childhood, the food his mother would make him after a day running around playing and annoying Mycroft, how his father would read to him until he fell asleep. His parents were dead now. Destroyed in the bombing of the cities, a casualty of this new world. Tears brimmed his eyes and he said a silent apology to this women who was now gripping his lower leg about to bite him. He plunged his blade deep into the back of her skull and she went limp against him. He kicked his leg free a new look of coldness and determination on his face. He had a job to do, a machine to be. He took some strides forward and plunged his knife into the skull of another of the dead, this one pressing against others trying to get through the gate. Sherlock tuned out the sound of the dead and the knives puncturing the brainstem. Greg was shoving his machete through the fence taking out some of the ones towards the front. Everything was happening rather fast now and Sherlock couldn’t help but be grateful to have John on this side of the gate. He moved swift, fast, a soldier. Bodies were dropping around him rapidly and he never once faltered. If Sherlock wasn’t tasked with his own group of the dead he would just stare at this man working away. By the time all but one of the twelve had been dropped the three men were practically panting from the effort, their clothes and hands covered in blood. John and Sherlock were now shifting around left and right avoiding the dead man’s attacks but keeping him closed in to the gate. Sherlock was fast in unravelling the thick red rope as John drew the dead man’s attention to him. Quickly before it got too close to John he threw the rope over the man and used his whole body to knock the man to the ground. It was now screeching and thrashing around under Sherlock’s weight as he struggled to tie the rope.
“I need you to pretend to be my boyfriend!” Sherlock blurted out.
‘The letters were addressed to me. He only truly wanted me to know why he did this to himself. I can’t risk anyone finding them.’
First letter everyone! Hope you enjoyed it! Please leave a comment or kudos if you did! They're always appreciated. Hopefully you'll return on Wednesday for the next letter!
Sherlock waved his phone in the air. “I just got off the phone with a Miss Irene Adler. She is on her way over and expects me to take her out on a date and expects more after! I can’t do that and she essentially invited herself over without even giving me a say in the matter!”
However, it also made me realize that it would be pretty hard for me to confess this all to you when I had a very difficult time talking about my feelings. I have a habit of keeping things to myself, which isn’t safe for they end up festering.
It was probably all in my head, but that’s what it felt like, standing up there and being the best man at your wedding. When I gave you that ring and you smiled at me, it was like the confirmation of the vow that had slowly been forming in my head.
It has been two weeks and three days since Sherlock and John had closed their last case together. It has been two weeks and two days since Sherlock and John had their last celebratory dinner together. It had been two weeks and one day since John had seen Sherlock alive for the last time. It had been two weeks exactly since Sherlock’s funeral. It had been two weeks exactly since John had gotten off of the couch and did something productive.
“We wanted to keep it a secret,” Sherlock butted in. He started to become more comfortable with the lie now that he realized John was going along with it as well. “The media would be blowing up if they knew that the consulting detective was dating his partner. That's what we were trying to avoid.
It was about three years ago, after we had finished a very minor case that the name has escaped me of at the moment, probably because it wasn’t important at the time but to me it is now.
She put a hand on her hip. “And is that a problem for you?”
John was still sitting in the same spot on the couch. He would lie down in order to go to sleep, but it was never for much more than a couple of hours. He would drink the water Mary would bring to him and the occasional tea from Mrs. Hudson. He would sometimes eat the food Mary would bring; a bite or two of this or a bite or two of that. The only time he got up is if he needed to use the bathroom. After he relieved his bladder, he would just go back to his original seat and stay there until he had to go back.
We had gone out to celebrate, just like we do all of the time, except you decided you’d had enough of the small cafe we always go to and wanted Italian food. I finally gave in, since you were very insistent. We arrived at the restaurant you wanted to go to, but it was closed. You were very mad as we walked to the cafe, but I couldn’t help but silently laugh to myself. The way you stood up for yourself and then was very disappointed in the outcome made me realize just how much I wanted you to stay by my side for a very long time. It made me realize that that is exactly how the world is, but I want you to see the better side of the world. It made me realize that I want you to be the happiest you’ve ever been. It made me realize that I wanted to be the one to make you the happiest person in the world.
“John!” Sherlock shouted from his bedroom. He opened his door and slammed it shut. “I’m going out!” He stomped over to the living room where John was mindlessly scrolling the internet on his laptop for a new case.
Mary came sprinting over to him from the kitchen. “John! Are you okay? What happened?”
This letter is my end all be all. Some people leave a suicide note before they commit suicide to explain why they are doing so to their loved ones. This is a little bit different, but it’s the same concept. I decided to write a suicide letter. This is because there is only one person I want to tell the truth to, and that’s you John. You deserve to know the truth and no one else, at least in my opinion. You could tell anyone you want after reading this and that would be your choice.
At that point, John shut the laptop. “Sherlock? Are you okay?”
That was when I began to think. I started thinking that death was the option. Then, I started thinking that maybe there was something better, faking it.
I should have just told you about the way I felt, but I was too much of a coward. Maybe if I had gained enough courage to, I would actually be here today. Maybe if I did, we would have been a couple.
"I do believe you are far more skilled at riding me than you are at riding a horse."
It's nice to see Watson so confident in his bare skin. Confident showing it off to Holmes. Holmes is happy all his hard work in praising and showing his appreciation of Watson's appearance has not been in vain.
Maybe my obsession with his hands had always been this intense.
I needed to feel this in the morning. To know it had not been a dream. I wanted a constant reminder of what transpired between us. I wanted to throw heated glances at him when my bum reminded me of the pounding it received. I wanted his knowing smile in return. Promises of more to come.
I wasn't sure when my eyes closed but they jerked open when I felt his hands at my trousers. Holmes teased playfully, rubbing my prick lightly, before setting to work undoing them. When he finally opened them, his thumbs hooked into the waistband of my drawers, pulling both down swiftly to my ankles.
"The tin," Watson rasps out, pushing up to get at good look at a flushed and aroused Holmes.
He feels Holmes retreat almost completely and then a third pushing in. The slight burning that accompanies the extra stretch makes Watson hiss. Holmes' free hand comes up to rest gently on Watson's lower back, index finger rubbing in small circles to sooth him.
John’s thumbs spread Sherlock a bit wider and he smirked as he looked down at the prize before him. He couldn’t help but to comment on what he saw, “You cleaned yourself up?”
Sherlock blinked and stopped pacing. He sat down on his bed. “He said that he didn’t think I would ever feel the same way about him?”
“What? I was only going to mention how you’ve so eloquently described him to me! Tall, d-“
He decided to review it just to further assure himself that he didn't like Sherlock in that manner. He figured that once he assured himself, the idea would fade.
“No! I’ve spent forty bloody minutes thinking about it!”
He pulled on some jeans that fit him well, which was already a bit out of character for him. He hadn't worn jeans like that since he was a young adult frequenting clubs and bars. But nevertheless, he hoped that showing himself off a bit would help to catch Sherlock's eye. He pulled off his jumper and put on a light grey shirt, tucked in the front, put on brown boots, and a black jacket. He felt like an absolute idiot. He wasn't even going on an official date and yet he was more concerned with his tonight’s outfit than he was on his real dates. But he did look good. Even he had to admit that he hadn't lost his touch.
John disrupted his relaxed state by pulling him close and getting him off the stained pillow, which he tossed aside. He held Sherlock’s panting body as the shakes slowly subsided. When Sherlock was relaxed in his arms, he stroked his lower back and planted a kiss onto his forehead. “How was that?”
Sherlock noticed how he paused to think before answering the question, he couldn't help but to question it as he was lead to his room. John's answer warmed his heart, "Because as much as I would like to have you in my bed, I know you haven't done this in a while and your experiences aren't the best. I want to make sure you're comfortable."
The detective gave a nod and then furrowed his eyebrows. “You didn’t tell her what time to be there.” He pointed out.
John smirked as Sherlock moved his hips. He slipped the tip of his tongue into Sherlock and fucked him with it. The tip moved in and out as fast as it could, attacking the nerve endings just inside Sherlock’s entrance.
He was cut off by John pressing his lips to Sherlock’s. He was a very eager kisser, but John took it slow, letting the tip of his tongue trace the bottom of Sherlock’s lower lip.
Without missing a beat, a wicked grin spread across John’s face as some lewd ideas crossed his mind. “That leaves so many options.” He said as his hands drifted up to undo the buttons of Sherlock’s shirt. “I’m going to enjoy this. I want to take my time with you.” He commented as his lover’s shirt slipped off. He stepped forward and pressed his lips back to where they once sat on Sherlock’s neck. He picked up as if he had never stopped. His lips moved down and embraced Sherlock’s collarbones, giving gentle nips that were so unlike the harsh bites Sherlock had once known.
John nodded, seeming to understand. He should have known that courting Sherlock wouldn’t be normal. But then again, normal is boring. “Do you not like the intimacy of it?”
That’s when it finally dawned on him.
Mycroft stared at John a moment as the doctor sat down and took his own cup of tea. He could tell that John was being completely honest, and somehow, he took flattery in the fact that a doctor honestly thought he looked average. “I’ve decided that I like John much more than I like you, Sherlock. Do be good to him.”
“We’ve established I have feelings for you. How do you feel about me?”
John chuckled and kept him close as they laid on the bed, practically laying the man across his chest.
John blinked a few times. “H-Harry? You want to meet Harry?”
"Are you sure?"
Sherlock took it in his hand and almost immediately understood what John wanted to do. “You can’t be serious.” His face flushed, cheeks and shoulders going scarlet.
John’s eyes seemed to light up with an innocent excitement. It was as if it were an honor for Sherlock to allow him to do something like that. “Are you certain?”
“No!” John said at the same time as Sherlock’s, “Of course.”
He went downstairs and acted as if he tonight was just another night for him. "Sherlock, are you ready to go?"
“Yesterday, just before I left work, I got a text from him saying he’s certain that loves you.”
It took two days for John to realize this and he wasn’t going to let Sherlock get away with it.
John cracked a smile. “Married to your work, right.” As disappointing as it was, it was still a bit funny. He realized he was quite stupid for letting himself get excited in the first place.
“Shut. The. Hell. Up.”
Had John been intentionally singing love songs this entire time? Had he been humming and singing love songs to Sherlock?
“Oh god. Neither of those are true.” He was certain that he’s never been so amused in his life.
He found himself doing it much more often. He hummed everything. He hummed old songs, new songs, songs that weren't well-known but that he loved, tunes he'd heard Sherlock play on his violin a thousand times, little melodies he made up himself, he did it all.
John cracked a smile. “I know, I just might let you. Uh, you remember my friend, Sherlock?”
John let out a whine and turned his head to the side, his body twisting as he attempted to lift his hips up.
Sherlock blinked a few times and found himself freed from his deep thoughts. But as he tasted reality, another thought flashed in his head just before he left.
The taller man let out a soft cry, rolling his hips back, eagerly fucking himself on the other’s tongue. He knew what he wanted and he was prepared to take it. His groans were long and low, rolling out of the back of his throat and bouncing off the walls. He wasn’t even trying to hold back anymore. He felt good and that’s all that mattered to him.
Sherlock was about to respond when he noticed the wetness on his face. He wiped his tears and said, "Yes, I'm quite alright."
Sherlock saw it all. The hope and the destruction. He felt a bit bad for it. Perhaps that joke hadn’t been the most appropriate considering his intentions. “At least, I thought I was.” He hesitantly added.
Angelo nodded and went to get the wine.
Sherlock was dumbfounded. He recognized all five of those names, but had been under the impression that they were women. "So, you're bisexual?"
emotional attraction.
“You, want me to be ..... happy?”
When John finished, Sherlock immediately interjected with his own two cents. "I hope you realize you aren't stupid or ugly." He was quite firm in his statement. The firmness was a bit of a surprise to John as he didn't expect Sherlock would have such a strong opinion on the matter. But now that he's put it out there, he was quite flattered.
The idea of letting his work go was easy and natural, he knew it would happen and he had no qualms about it. But the idea of letting John go might be the one thing that has ever truly scared Sherlock. When he did let John go, and spent those two years without him, he only did it because John would have been killed if he hadn't. He did it all for John. Those two years were spent making the world a safer place for John; Sherlock didn't even realize that until now.
After a brief fight between Sherlock and the girl that ended with Sherlock nearly breaking his nose and John holding the girl at gunpoint, Lestrade caught up.
John wasn’t have any of that. He grabbed Sherlock’s hips and spun them around so Sherlock rested against the counter. “I’ll kiss you like you do to me, and we’ll see how you like it. How’s that sound?”
“Yeah well it’s not as if there is anyone left in the world who’s I.Q I could lower now, is there? It’s just us.” Anderson grumbled under his voice. A sadness took over the room again.
“Mrs. Hudson, you are a mystery.” The man said as he inspected the contents revealed to them now. The boot of the old woman’s car was practically an arsenal. She had rope, an array of handguns, a number of knives varying in size, two machine guns, and no less than five rifles.
“Let me help.” She interjected once more and took her card back out.
Right now they were protected by a thick gate. It would be easy to just pick them off through the gate with their guns but the gunshot would no doubt attract more. Greg’s voice seemed to draw them in, so gunfire surely would. The gates were strong but they were on hinges and with enough force would push open. Attracting too many of these things could prove deadly for the whole group. Opening the gate with this many of them there would prove deadly. There was too many of them and only three men to fight back. There was no way to get one of them in without opening the gate. Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and ran over the property layout in his mind. Two kilometers from where they stood there was a section where the three men could climb over the wall using some vines. Sherlock had done it many times. If they came from behind perhaps they stood a chance. They’d need someone inside to open the gate though. They couldn’t climb back over with one of those bodies.
“Sherlock, what would your brother say?” She said with fury.
“If only your self destructive habits were the reason for my call.” Mycroft’s voice seemed somber, “I need you to come to my residence at once. There is no time for delay. I have a car waiting for you out front.” Mycroft’s words stirred up a twinge of anxiety within Sherlock that he suffocated like a flame.
“Oh, not him again.” Anderson grunted piecing the dots together.
“Of course. Yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much.”
Sherlock had little to no issue climbing up the wall and bounding over it, but John did not have the advantage of his long legs. He was an impatient man but for John he was willing to wait. When both men were on the other side they started walking back to the left where the gate was, hidden in the treeline.
“Anderson, don’t talk out loud. You lower the I.Q of the whole street.” Sherlock retorted just a second before the room illuminated again as the generators kicked on. Anderson scowled at Sherlock but lowered himself back into his chair.
“They belonged to my husband. I figured one day they would be of use.” The woman said as she stepped aside so the men could grab some of the weapons. Greg already had his pistol. He made a move to grab a switchblade, rifle, and a machete from the trunk along with some extra ammo. John picked up a large hunting knife, a pistol, and one of the machine guns that he slung over his shoulder. Sherlock inspected all the weapons before picking up some rope, a British Army Browning L9A1, and a switchblade.
“You’re a doctor. In fact you’re an army doctor.” Sherlock said as a fact rather than a question. This took John by surprise.
“You brought her along, she is your responsibility. Now shut her up!” Mycroft snapped. The front door flew open and Greg walked in, his eyes glassy and wide, his skin white as a sheet. In tow he had Anderson who seemed to match his expression entirely.
Martha Hudson had spent her morning at the shops picking up some much needed groceries. She had dinner plans with Sherlock that evening and he was a rather picky eater with a large sweet tooth, but she knew what he liked. She had years back taken on the task of keeping Sherlock well fed. The man was quite thin and felt rather inconvenienced by any food that wasn’t fresh chips, biscuits, or a fresh baked good filled with the sweetest of fruits. She almost had a laugh each time she scanned an item at the self checkout wondering how ridiculous she must look with all these overly sweet items, a sack of potatoes, and some freshly cut fish filets.
“I wish I could answer your questions better. There is only so much known right now.” Mycroft continued.
Hey and thanks for checking out chapter two of 'Flesh is Only an Indulgence'. I know this chapter is a bit short but in this chapter I wanted to explore more of what is going on with Mycroft and the apocalypse. With each chapter I will be able to dive further into how everyone is managing things, but this chapter was mainly about some answers and the introduction to the mastermind behind all of this.
“Do you think there are any other survivors out there?” Mrs. Hudson asked from the opposite side of the table. Her usual chipper voice was dull and full of sorrow now. Sherlock was at a loss for words. He didn’t have the answers to this. The person who would know would be his brother, and he seemed to think locking himself away was the best response to this situation.
“The end of the world.” Mycroft said absently.
“Mike, as I previously stated,” Sherlock began but was swiftly cut off by his mobile. His eyes darted to the offending object sat on the table a few feet away from him, the name on the display being none other than his older brother. He let out a scoff. “Sorry, if I don’t take this the entire British Government will descend upon us.” Sherlock spoke with a venom in his voice as his slender long fingers wrapped around the buzzing item.
“Sherlock, please handle this woman.” Mycroft was succumbing to his headache and the sound of her wails was not much help.
“Greg, I need you to stay here. I will need you to keep them focused on you in here. Make noise but do not fire your gun. Open up the gate when I say. John, you come with me.” Sherlock didn’t explain further. He took off in a full sprint towards his right. He heard John’s footfalls behind him and knew that he was close behind.
“You know I’m not a fan of small talk, Mike.” Sherlock spoke dryly not removing his eyes from the petri dish where he had just dropped an array of chemicals onto a small blood sample. His eyes remained fixed and curious as it sizzled and foamed up.
“Oh, Myroft. Good to see you up.” Sherlock said with a smile as if this was the most normal thing in the world, and in a way it was. This was the new normal, the new world.
“Mrs. Hudson is putting some tea on if you’re interested.” John stepped to the side a bit and let his eyes wander across the papers inquisitively. Sherlock inspected his features as he looked at the scans and test results.
“No kidding you didn’t deem these people a threat.” Sherlock muttered under his breath and shot a slight glare towards his brother. He flipped through the files reading up on all the information his brother did have on this group. The things it contained seemed relatively small in the grand scheme of things. Theft, fraud, murder, nothing that would ever indicate biological warfare that would take down the entire world. At the centre of all these crimes and all these pages was one name, one master of the entire network. Sherlock flipped to the back of the file and there was a face staring back at him. A face with cold, dead, dark brown eyes and a sadistic grin, A face and stare that looked straight into his soul and embedded itself in his mind. The face that was responsible for the fall of society and billions of deaths. James Moriarty.
Sherlock poured a large cup of water for his brother and placed it on the coffee table directly in front of him, grabbed one of the yarn blankets their mum had made for him for Christmas a few years ago and placed that over him before he walked and took a seat in the office chair Mycroft had been seated in before. For awhile he just watched his brother sleep wondering when the last time was that he had the peace of a real deep rest. Eventually though Sherlock couldn’t help but turn back to the screens playing the horror of this newfound reality. He watched each and every screen play a different horror, saw and memorized every face he could make out that was killed by these diseased beings. He ran his hands along his face and felt a few tears slip from his eyes watching all this. He didn’t care what his brother had said, there still had to be people out there, something worth fighting for, and he was going to fight for it. He shook the tears off and picked the lock on his brothers file cabinet and pulled the laptop from the side drawer of the desk. He needed all the details. He pulled all the files that looked relevant and dropped them onto the desk next to the closed laptop. His eye quickly scanned through the abundance of papers the large files contained.
“Yes? Right. Oh. I understand.” Mycroft ended the call and walked up the staircase to where his room was without another word. Sherlock knew the news was not good but he decided that he didn’t want to know the obvious reason for Mycroft walking off as he did.
-ASirensDeadliestSong
“I’m sure you three have read about the suicides in the papers. The poison they took contained the virus. The victims acted as the incubator for the virus to take root, then they themselves became the means of spreading the virus.” Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose, his face contorting. It was clear he was getting a headache.
“What do you expect me to do?” He shot back and bent his hand in frustration as annoyance overtook his face.
“It infects the brain subsequently killing it and the host’s body. Only the brainstem survives and as such only the most basic and primal of instincts. Eat, move. They are driven by hunger and pure aggression.”
Sherlock’s mind was processing many things at once about the disease that ended the world but his mind never wandered far from the man who started it all. James Moriarty. No matter how far Sherlock wandered in thought or in research he could not begin to comprehend what could motivate this man to end the world. He seemed to thrive on causing trouble, but with the world over there wasn’t much trouble left to be causing. The virus was too random, too uncontrollable. Once someone was infected they became mindless beings that had no master, no morals, they only wanted to kill. What benefit could Moriarty find in this? How could he even ensure his own safety in all of this? If ending the world was for his enjoyment, how could he enjoy it all if he too died?
“It doesn’t make sense. With these scans it was clear where they should have been focusing, but..”
“Well the labs are down. The hospitals bombed. There is no way for us to find out now.” John stated and looked towards Sherlock.
“Back away from her, now!” Greg shouted, his gun firmly fixed on the man as the sound of him chewing flesh filled the space, “Did you hear me? I said back away!” He shouted again. This seemed to get the man’s attention. He stood in a strange lethargic and broken type of way and started shuffling over to where Greg and Anderson stood. “Stop where you are! I will shoot!” The man pressed forward and made that same growl sound he had before attacking Donovan. Greg fired a shot into the man’s leg. This did nothing. The man pressed forward completely undeterred. Greg shot again, this time aiming and hitting the heart. He and Anderson both watched in shock as again this seemed to do nothing. Greg fired three more shots, but this only resulted in the man stumbling backwards.
“You haven’t seen what it’s like out there. You have no idea..” Greg was getting red with frustration.
“It’s just an outage. The power stations probably got hit in the bombing.” Sherlock said with annoyance at how everyone was acting, “Mycroft has a number of backup generators. They will kick on any moment.” Sherlock felt around with his fork and brought some of the steamed vegetables up to his lips.
“This is an emergency broadcast. This is not a drill. Remain in your homes. Do not answer the door for anyone. Earlier this afternoon a mass group of people began attacking civilians. The numbers have grown dramatically. We urge you to stay inside and not try and flee. Military efforts are being made to subdue these groups of individuals. We have received reports that most large cities have fallen victim to these attacks. If you are getting this message please take precautions. Please await further instructions.” The silence fell once more as the group of them took in the message. Greg was the first to speak.
“No one is coming to save us.” His words both a statement and a question at the same time. The atmosphere now somber, uncertainty and fear taking over. Sherlock couldn’t help but see this as a case he needed to solve.
“Oh Sherlock.. You have no idea what we have seen.” She muttered out through her tears.
Mycroft leaned over the side of the couch and emptied the contents of his stomach into the small rubbish bin that was waiting there for him. The sight was unbecoming of the once proud and posh man. He tried to chase the bad taste away with the glass of water that had been left for him. His eyes were squinted from the massive headache he was feeling. It didn’t take him long to locate his younger brother lost in thought surrounded by the confidential files.
“That’s where you’re wrong.” Sherlock stood again and started walking towards the doorway, “We are in a house full of doctors, chemists, and a forensic scientist. We have the means to run our own tests.” A look of determination was on Sherlock’s face.
“Madness and brilliance go hand in hand.” Sherlock walked purposefully out of the office and down the stairs in a rush. His coat and scarf were rested on the chair where he had left it the past evening. He put the heavy item on and wrapped the scarf around his neck. Greg was in the sitting area reading some strange fantasy book. It didn’t take him long to notice that Sherlock was dressing to head out.
“What would you know of it? You’re a man of little to no intelligence if you are so willing to follow my brother here on such a pointless suicide mission.”
Greg Lestrade had just finished a press conference in regards to the recent string of suicides and the strange new development of the bodies going missing shortly after being taken to the morgue when he received a cryptic text from Sherlock Holmes. They had been acquainted for long enough now for him to understand that when he received a message like this it was best to listen.
“Any good?”
“Sherlock you take this thing out of here right now. You have put everyone in here at risk bringing this creature into my home. I always knew you were an idiot, but this?” Mycroft spat towards his brother.
“Christ!” Anderson shouted out in horror and disgust. He made a move to run towards Donovan’s body but Greg was quick to shove him back against the car, his gun now drawn. He felt sick as the man fell forwards towards the body and ripped another chunk of skin from Donovan’s unmoving corpse.
“Christ…” Someone breathed out from the doorway causing Sherlock’s head to snap up from the floor. John Watson was standing in the doorway with his gaze fixed on the screen, the lights of the horror they displayed reflecting in his blue eyes. He was leaning heavily on his cane and his free hand was trembling and clenching at his side.
“What if something happens to you?” She seemed a bit upset right now. Terrified, even.
“What does it do?” Mike finally spoke, but it was clear in his voice that he wasn’t all there.
“John. It’s John Watson.” The man said warmly, but his tone was laced with terror.
“Mike, right. I remember you.” He said and extended his hand to the man.
“John!” He called out needing assistance.
“What’s the plan here? We are quite outnumbered in this situation.”
“What did you just say?” Mycroft slowly turned back to his brother. The dead man was pulling hard against Sherlock’s grip and fighting to get a taste of any of the flesh in the room.
“Ah yes, more of your strays.” Mycroft was clearly too exhausted to put any bite into his tone. “Let them in.” He ordered and waved the man away.
“Hello, brother mine.” Mycroft spoke in his usual cold tone, but it had a slight edge of worry to it that caused a scowl to cross Sherlock’s face as he exited the lab into the extending hallway.
“A virus. It was engineered somewhere in Serbia under a crime network we had previously thought a minor threat.” Mycroft leaned back against one of the ornate tables as if he was about to crumble under his own weight.
“New lead?” Donovan inquired as she trailed behind Greg.
“As I said, I’m not sure. He just told me to meet him. I’m not fool enough to ignore him.” Greg pulled his keys from his pocket and hit the unlock button. The click of the doors opening broke the sudden silence. Suddenly a gasp broke through it as well causing Greg to spin on his heels. There was a man covered in blood and bile walking towards the three of them. Greg’s hand fell from the handle leaving the door of his car slightly ajar.
“So you’re just giving up then? That’s that?” John took a purposeful step towards Mycroft. Mycroft sat up as if ready to embrace whatever beating John may place upon him. Sherlock took a stride forward and positioned himself between the two men.
The overwhelming smell of the herbs and spices coating the food wafted into Sherlock’s nose and started giving him a minor headache. His long fingers curled around the tables edge and dug in a bit catching the attention of John.
Undetermined amounts of time passed by as Sherlock stood almost paralyzed before he straightened out his suit and headed back in the lab. Molly Hooper was now stood beside Mike Stamford exchanging laughs over two mugs of coffee. Sherlock’s expression was vacant as he watched the two. He considered Mike a friend of sorts, or as close to a friend as someone like him was capable of having. If Mycroft’s sources were accurate he couldn’t leave Mike to potentially perish at the hands of whatever this attack may be. Molly Hooper however he found at times to be ditsy, over eager, and rather annoying, but she was useful when he needed assistance. He took long strides to where his Belstaff wool coat and his dark blue scarf were draped neatly over a chair.
There was a long and deafening silence that overtook the room aside from Molly on the floor as they waited for two other cars to arrive.
Twenty minutes into her drive the whole atmosphere of the world seemed to shift and people seemed to be more distressed. Her eyes scanned the walkway to her left and saw a grizzly sight. A woman was drenched in blood and bile pursuing a man who was attempting to beat her advances back with a cane. There was a moment of shock when she recognised this as the man from earlier at the shops. Without hesitation she unlocked her doors, rolled down the right sides window and called out to the man.
Mrs. Hudson was on the floor trying to console Molly. Mike was with Anderson and Greg trying to explain what he could about the situation. John and Sherlock were left standing alone and slightly awkward, their eyes locked on each other. A million different thoughts were racing through both men’s minds, not one being said aloud.
It didn’t take the elderly woman long to take notice of the rather short silver haired man beside her getting frustrated with with his self checkout station. The man had a cane at his side while trying to scan items with his free hand. Mrs. Hudson finished up at her station and paid before walking to the young man with her bags in tow.
“Want to see some more?”
Her mobile lit up just as she was about to put a berry cobbler into her oven. An urgent message from Sherlock. Even through the text she managed to fully grasp the urgency in his words. Completely abandoning the meal she was preparing she left the flat and got in her car. The address Sherlock had given for his brother’s residence was well outside of the city and more towards the quiet countryside. It would be quite the drive. She moved her hand and cranked up the rock album she had left in the player from her earlier drive.
It took a few hours for the group to calm down enough for everyone to gather in the dining area. Mycroft hadn’t emerged from wherever he had gone off to, and an eerie silence had taken over the world. Almost everyone was sat quietly around a large oval shaped table, not a single person making eye contact with anyone else. Sherlock was sat between Greg Lestrade and John Watson doing his best not to continue deducing this man. There was a loud squeak as the doors to the kitchens opened and three of Mycroft’s workers came rushing out carrying plates of food and a bottle of red wine from his cellar. Sherlock’s eyes glanced over the small serving of chicken that was on everyone’s plates accompanied by a spoonful of rice and some steamed vegetables. The portion was less than half the size of a normal adult meal. The rationing was already starting and it seemed no one at the table questioned this. Most of them didn’t have much of an appetite anyways.
“He won’t be going alone.” John pipped in. Greg looked exasperated. He rubbed his hands across his jeans before nodding.
“That’s right. Come get me you filthy bastard!” John shouted before hitting Mycroft full on with his whole body. The two stumbled and fell backwards.
She had spent the afternoon unloading groceries and preparing the meal for the evening feeling rather good about herself. There was always an unmatchable joy she felt at helping others. Her mind couldn’t help but wonder what would become of that man.
“The information I told you was not meant to be shared. You risked the very peace I try so hard to protect by sharing it with your fanclub.” Mycroft spat and slammed the front door. Sherlock stood ready to start a confrontation but his brother raised his hands up in surrender. “Now is no time for a childish display of dominance, brother mine.”
“”These results show that it’s very likely this is either a fungal infection or parasite that latches on and grows in the brain stem. But..” John stopped and squinted at the reports done on the brain tissue, “The people who were doing these tests were testing the wrong areas of the brain to get conclusive evidence.” John motioned for Sherlock to come closer and look at the page he was focused on, “They were focused on how this damages and harms the frontal lobe, they never once ran any tests on the stem.” John’s face contorted in confusion as he moved back over and picked up the scans again. Sherlock watched intently.
“What is it?” The gravity of the situation was hitting Sherlock and he sunk back into the chair he had risen from.
When they finally arrived back to the house Greg entered to find a very angry Mycroft who looked like death, a worried Mrs. Hudson, a confused Mike, and a jittery Anderson. They seemed rather horrified and disgusted by the state of Greg now, he must have been quite the sight with the fluids and dirt he was covered in. He was very aware of how bad he smelled now.
“Now will you all shut up?” She asked coldly before throwing the knife to the ground and walking out without another word. Everyone was silent as they watched the blood pool on the wood floor from the dead man’s head.
“James Moriarty. He corrupted the results of the tests. He is the reason the lab fell.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at his brother, “You know good old James, don’t you brother mine? The man who ended the world after you deemed him a minor threat?” Sherlock’s tone was venomous.
“John.. I think it’s dead.” Sherlock muttered as Greg helped Sherlock back to his feet after checking him for scratches or bites. His coat was ruined. Not only stained by blood it was practically in ribbons now. These dead people were strong. They didn’t have that control people had they prevented them from using the full brunt of their strength. John remained stabbing the dead man again and again until Greg finally stepped in and pulled the man away. There was barely a head left of the dead man now. John angrily walked off muttering things under his breath. Sherlock grabbed the rope again and told Greg to keep its attention and lead it to the mansion. John shut the gates after they all entered the property and together they walked back to the mansion. Sherlock was pretty shaken, not that he would let on. He almost died, he could have become one of those things.
“Excuse me.” Sherlock said and stood from the table walking out of the room, most of the chicken still left untouched. From behind his back he heard Lestrade utter something about not wasting any food and then the clatter of a plate and plop of food onto another one.
“Shit!” Greg said as he ran to open the gate. John was quick to get to Sherlock’s side and start tying a tight knot as Sherlock used both hands to hold the things head down and his knees to pin its arms from scratching at John.
“A car has been sent for out parents as well, but that is all the information on them I posses. We haven’t got the time to discuss this right now. Get in the car, Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice was more demanding than normal.
“How do we go about this, Sherlock?” John asked stepping directly beside him staring at the creatures as well. Sherlock’s eyes were darting around trying to figure out the best plan here.
“Oh, God, yes.” There was an eagerness and hunger in John’s eyes now that Sherlock found almost irresistible. He stood from the floor and dropped the plate of biscuits next to Mycroft’s empty glass. His slender fingers gathered all the relevant papers about the virus from the floor and dropped them back onto Mycroft’s desk. John was just on his tail peering over his hunched over shoulders.
The first file of relevant info was the baseline of what they knew about the virus and what it does to the body. Sherlock placed the scans they had of the brain from before, during, and after the virus took over on top of the screens still playing the surveillance footage. There was quite a clear difference between all the scans and he understood now what Mycroft had meant about it only bringing the brain stem back to life. There was absolutely no activity left in the neocortex or frontal lobe after the virus took full effect. Everything that made a human alive and who they were was gone. Next Sherlock looked through the notes in the files. The notes seemed to compare the virus in a way to how meningitis invades the brain. Right before death the adrenal glands seem to hemorrhage in all these cases causing brain shut down followed by massive organ shut down. Through all the notes and studies it became apparent that not one single person had any real idea what this was, how it truly worked, or how to stop it. He slammed that file shut and moved onto the one that contained information on the crime network that Mycroft thinks organized the attack. This file was substantially smaller. Sherlock let out a scoff.
“I’m not sure.” He saw no point in being dishonest.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t risk my life to retrieve this man for research just for you to have me throw it away.” Sherlock was glaring his brother down.
“They are in a state of both death and life.” Mycroft says matter of factly.
“Would you help me get him to the sofa?” Sherlock motioned his head towards the large unsightly brown sofa tucked towards the far end of the room. John nodded.
“Greg we need to leave!” Anderson yelled and dove into the car slamming the door. Greg’s flight instinct took route and he dove into the driver’s seat and fumbled with his keys. Just as the engine roared to life the man slammed into Greg’s windows, his fists smashing repeatedly against the glass smearing it with blood. Greg shifted the car into reverse and slammed the gas. The man pursued the car as it turned. Just as Greg was speeding out of the car park he saw as Donovan sat up and looked towards the car, her expression vacant, her eyes now seeming a cloudy marbled blue.
The car deposited the three adults at the front door where Mycroft remained in the doorway. The first thing Sherlock noticed in his brothers expression was relief at the sight of him safe, but this emotion was quickly replaced as he noticed the two other people standing behind him. Now he looked scandalized.
“I need to run some tests, and for that I need one of those things. Alive, dead, I don’t have a preference right now.” Sherlock started instructing, “Gavin, you have the gun. I need you to cover John and I. John, I need your help isolating one of them and getting them back here. They infect us by biting and scratching. Keep your arms close to you body, watch your surroundings, don’t get cornered, move fast.” The two men were nodding in understanding when Mrs. Hudson rounded the corner with a look of murder in her eyes.
As always I hope you readers enjoyed the chapter and will continue to join me along this journey.
“Sherlock!” He called and ran forward gripping his hunting knife tight. He knocked the dead man off of Sherlock and into the ground before plunging the blade through its eye socket. Once. Twice. Six times and showing no sign of slowing down.
“Care to expand on that?” Greg said clearly irritated. Anderson was now throwing up in one of Mycroft’s one of a kind pots. This brought joy to Sherlock for several reasons. A small smirk crossed his lips.
“Someone will need to keep an eye on him. Make sure he doesn’t choke on his own vomit in his sleep.” Sherlock nodded. John started walking towards the doorway. He was almost through it when Sherlock called after him.
“The virus was in the poison they took.” Sherlock confirmed based on what his brother had told him.
“Right,” Mike said softly, as usual at a loss for how to interact with Sherlock, “I was wondering how that search for a new flatmate was working out for you.” He was cautious with his words almost as if he were fearing waking a wrath from deep within Sherlock’s soul. Sherlock gave an exasperated grunt in reply to the question, his mind already formulating a tangent about how not a single soul in London would want him for a flatmate.
An obnoxious beeping came through from the adjacent room and Sherlock took this chance to break the trance and dash off to where the sound was coming from. It seemed that the others had the same idea. The sound was being produced from a large flat screen television.
“Everything all right, Sherlock?” Mike asked hastily standing from his seat and inspecting the tall man throwing on his jacket and tying his scarf.
“Right.” He said after a good half hour. Sherlock had stood stiff beside him the whole time leaving the man room to think. “These people are definitely dead. There is absolutely no higher brain function after the virus takes root.” John dropped the papers and turned to Sherlock.
“Lighten up, Sher. It’s the end of the world. A glass of wine won’t hurt.” Greg chimed in downing his own glass immediately and motioning for a refill.
“What does freak need this time?” Donovan put her jacket on and continued following Greg to the car park below the building.
“Both of you need to come with me. There is no time to ask questions or collect any items.” Sherlock said quick and emotionless. His words drew the attention of his colleagues to him at last.
“I do believe I said there is no time for questions, Mike. We need to leave immediately.” Molly looked half petrified but she nodded at Sherlock’s words. Mike seemed to stop his protests and questions as well. As a unit the trio left Bart’s and just as Mycroft had said there was a sleek black vehicle waiting for him. Molly’s mouth opened as they got in the car but a glare from Sherlock made her snap her mouth shut abruptly.
There was a series of loud thunderous claps from the distance and Sherlock didn’t even need to look out the window to understand what was being done, the answer had already been clear in Mycroft’s actions after that phone call. They were bombing the cities.
“How did it start?” A few tears were now spilling from Molly’s eyes as she spoke, her voice cracking.
“Mum? Dad?” Sherlock couldn’t resist asking regardless if this was a good time or not.
“Bit of trouble too, I bet.”
“Oh what the hell is he doing here?!” Sherlock shot up from his chair as his face contorted into pure rage. Greg didn’t reply, it seemed his voice was lost somewhere back at New Scotland Yard. Anderson didn’t fire back some ill thought out insult or sarcasm. Sherlock’s expression softened a bit realizing something was very wrong.
“Very good.”
“Fine.” Was all he muttered out before taking a large swig of water. The man coming around and pouring wine into the crystal glasses made an attempt to fill the one sat in front of Sherlock. He was fast in shooting his hand out and covering the top. “None for me.” His voice was venomous.
“What is it? Has something happened to Mum?” Sherlock’s mind was racing scanning through all logical reasons for this seemingly urgent call.
“Yes. The question is how and why.” Sherlock sat back in Mycroft’s chair and ran his fingers along his face.
“We had many run tests and find nothing useful. This is needlessly reckless. You may have no regard for your own life, but I would quite like to keep mine.”
“Right. Yeah, no problem.” Together the two men carried Mycroft’s limp body towards the couch and dropped him indelicately onto it. His brother was already snoring by the time his head hit the soft surface. Sherlock used his long leg to drag and kick the rubbish bin under the coffee table to be positioned right by Mycroft’s head. John spun the man so he was laying on his side.
“It will give us the best results. Now keep quiet. If they hear us this plan won’t work and we will be dead before any of this discussion will even matter.” Sherlock pulled the switchblade from his pocket as they got closer. “Remember, aim for the head. If it’s the brainstem that is alive that is what we need to destroy to kill them.” John nodded beside him before pulling out his hunting knife.
“Okay. Tell us what to do.” Sherlock’s eyes narrowed but he wasn't going to argue. Greg had a gun and they needed that.
“But they didn’t follow through.” Sherlock walked back over to the papers scattered across the floor. He went to the computers, typed in the surveillance tape code he needed and pulled it up. The lab where they had been running these tests came up. The place was now overrun by these dead people. Sherlock rewound the tapes to a few days prior where the incident occured. John stood with his arms crossed over his chest and watched intently. One of the infected was strapped to the table where three scientists were running a number of tests. The results to these never came back.
“Sadly not. This is a fast moving virus and once it is introduced to the system there is a small margin before it takes over and goes beyond something curable.” Mycroft said even more defeated now. Clearly he had already worked out all potential options and came up with nothing.
“We had received information that there was.. A virus” Mycroft said and finally lifted his head to face John and Sherlock. Sherlock now saw how red, swollen, and raw his brothers eyes were. This drunk man sitting in that chair was not his brother. This was a broken shell, a complete stranger. “None of us had any idea how bad.. How deadly. We did all we could. It wasn’t enough.” Mycroft’s words seemed to be slurring worse now that he was sitting up. His voice was raw and cracking. Sherlock took notes of the trickles of blood on his brothers head where he had dug his nails into his own flesh before pounding his fists onto his forehead.
The scientists were running different frequencies of electricity through the living corpse while the minimal brain activity was being monitored. In the background a man was taking notes. They adjusted the electrical current again ready to run the next level of tests. That’s when the man taking notes smashed his clipboard over one of the scientists head, cut the restraints on the test subject, ran out of the lab and locked the door. The attack was violent as the creature devoured the three scientists who had been beating on the door to be let out. The man who did it could be seen from behind the door with a grin. Sherlock paused the tape and zoomed in on the man.
“You brought one of those things in here?!” Anderson shouted towards Sherlock with a fire of rage behind his eyes, “I knew I was right about you. You really are a psychopath!” The dead man growled and Anderson took a large jump backwards. Mrs. Hudson was looking a bit green and had to leave the room because of the smell.
“We?” He asked and his face twisted with confusion that wasn’t long lived. A short silver haired man limped into the doorway and looked around at the scene before him. He seemed alarmed and confused to say the least. His cane seemed to be covered in blood, but he himself seemed clear of any. Sherlock’s mind raced as he took the man in. Psychosomatic limp, army man recently home, tanned slightly, clearly stationed in Afghanistan or Iraq. Sherlock’s icy eyes darted all over him before his train of thought was interrupted by Mike.
Sherlock stopped walking abruptly when he reached the thick metal bars of the gate. Just outside of the gate, a few feet away were twelve of these dead people.Two were dragging themselves along, the flesh and muscle from their legs completely gone. Three were missing an arm, the rest were covered in ripped up and dirty flesh and blood. The creatures seemed to be bent over a corpse ripping the flesh and organs from it, loudly feasting on what used to be a person. Sherlock knew from a quick glance that this was the person who had been guarding the front gate. The sound of them feasting churned his stomach. John and Greg reached the gate not long after. The smell coming off these things was vile.
With love,
“Sherlock, this..” Mike started and covered his mouth as if he were about to be sick, “This is insane, even for you.” Mycroft pushed John away from him and stood up.
“Help would be lovely, thank you.” He said in a low grumble but not sounding hostile at all. Together they managed to scan and bag all the items the man had. She was just about to walk away when the man began to have a full on row with the chip and pin machine. It seemed he had insufficient funds for his items.
“Sir, are you okay? Do you need assistance?” Donovan said while hesitantly approaching the man. His behaviour seemed slightly erratic. Greg moved his hand to the gun harnessed to his right hip. “Sir?” Donovan asked again and moved to rest her hand on the man’s shoulder. He made a motion as if sniffing the air and before there was even a moment for any of the three of them to react he went full attack mode. There was a growl like scream from the man’s throat before he latched onto Donovan’s exposed throat and ripped clean through her jugular. Her body tensed and fell to the ground as blood spurt from her neck and doused her cream coloured clothing in thick crimson red. The man now seemed to be chewing and swallowing the chunk of skin he had taken.
“Got it! I got it!” John finally said and fell backwards into the dirt road. His pupils were dilated from the adrenaline. He was laughing almost manically. Sherlock stood up off the dead man and admired John’s work. He had managed to tie its arms tight to its body and its hands tight together. Sherlock held tight to the rope as it tried to thrash and get free. The gate finally starting opening up and Greg ran to them breathless. His eyes scanned the man thrashing and screaming on the ground.
Sherlock’s strides were long and purposeful, his mind running its usual thousand miles a minute. His long fingers ran through his curls and messed them up a bit. His feet were carrying him though he had no desired location. He found himself in Mycroft’s study where his brother sat with his head held in his hand, an empty bottle of whisky at his side, and a number of screens playing security feeds from earlier in the day before they were knocked out by the bombs. Sherlock remained in the doorway watching with horror as large groups of people hounded the ones running for their lives. The effortlessness in which they tore into other humans and consumed their flesh churned his stomach. In his life he had seen many horrors, many violent murders and deaths, but there was something about seeing people being eaten alive that shook him to his core in an unimaginable way. When the screen flashed to a group of children being attacked Sherlock walked into the room and turned his back towards the screen. His eyes scanned his brother taking everything in. Somehow in the few hours since he had last seen him he looked alarmingly worse, as if ten years had passed in a matter of minutes. The room flashed as the displays showed the moment the bombs were dropped on the large cities, then darkness. The tapes then replayed. Sherlock wondered how many times his brother had watched these tapes over and over before being unable to look anymore. From the odour of alcohol coming off his brother that bottle of whisky was not the only alcohol that had consumed.
“All we know is that it spreads from contact. The first cases of spreading came after being bitten or scratched. It all happened rather fast after that. There is no stopping it, and there is no slowing it down. The world as we know it is at an end.” Molly then dissolved into a puddle of sobs on the floor, her body convulsing with fear and sadness.
“James Moriarty, the man responsible for all of this.” Sherlock stated and held the picture from Mycroft’s files up next to the screen. “He got himself into the lab and botched all the results. He ensured that these people died before they could find a way to stop this.” John was silent but Sherlock could see the gears in the man’s brain turning.
“Good, but I was hoping you’d go deeper.” Sherlock nodded back towards the papers on the desk and John moved back to them.
“Mycroft, for the last time I am doing well. I’ve even quit smoking. There is little need for you to constantly disturb my work.” Sherlock spat.
“I got shot.” The man replied bitterly and his left hand clenched into a fist and released shaking.
“You knew about what was going on?” Anger was now in John’s voice and Sherlock watched his expression change as he turned to observe Mycroft.
“Have Anderson and Molly set up a lab for me. Find the room with the strongest door, most space, and a good lock. They will know what to do from there. If my brother asks I’ve gone to take a nap.” Sherlock says to Mrs. Hudson before kissing the top of her head and walking off while pulling on his leather gloves.
“So there really is nothing left then?” John inquired though it was clear that he already knew the answer. It was written clear across the screens.
There is that mischievous twinkle in his eyes again.
I could now feel the heat of his body against my back. His lips pressed feather light kisses to my neck and his hands roamed my body. I closed my eyes and reveled in the sensations.
"You haven't turned a page for the last half hour, my dear," he finally spoke. "In fact, every day for the past week you have sat in this chair to read and yet, you fail to turn a single page the entire time."
Holmes nods and Watson settles himself fully on Holmes. He wriggles his hands, palms up, under the pillow below them both, hugging Holmes to him.
Watson may express concern over his figure from time to time, usually only after a visit to the tailor but, Holmes always is there to alay those worries. Regardless, Watson does not worry too much because he still keeps up with Holmes on cases and he can still easily pick Holmes up to fuck him against the wall when the occasion arises.
Holmes glares incredulously.
I should say, by this point, I was rather worked up to a frenzy. I could only sit and watch as his hands work their magic on me.
I did and quickly. I missed his touch.
Watson could not contain the gasp of shock as two of Holmes cold fingers breach him. They quickly warm and Watson finds he cannot keep still. Holmes reaches deeper with his long, thin fingers. Prodding depths his own could not.
And that's when Holmes realises he expressed the fantasy aloud. He shivers at the possibility of enacting it out in the future.
No one has ever had the effect that Watson has on him and he is forever grateful for the man who quiets his brain.
He frotted a few times and then fell to his knees. His hands spread my cheeks and I felt him apply his tongue enthusiastically to my hole. He made me come from this once. As much as I enjoyed it, I hoped that wouldn't be the case this time. I already cleaned ahead of time in anticipation that we might be intimate. I was in desperate need of his cock filling me up.
I never felt happier in my life and never more right to be laying underneath my dear Watson. My arms wrapped around him and held him tight until I too fell asleep at last.
Holmes may not be able to see Watson's face but, Watson huffs and Holmes knows Watson is rolling his eyes.
We stuck with the slow pace. I relished in the drag of his cock over my prostate. But soon enough I found I needed more. I started to meet his thrusts and he took the hint.
The pace slows abruptly and Holmes is relieved. Thankful for a short reprieve from the heavenly bliss. Watson is just grinding his hips, incorporating slow circles. He uses Holmes to push up and slam down so hard Watson swears Holmes' cock was in his throat for a brief moment. Watson groans, his head tipping back.
"I want to feel it the next day."
Holmes runs his hands up and down Watson's thighs and then to his chest, disturbing the hair. The man bounces without mercy. His heavy cock now bobbing between them.
Holmes blindly searches for Watson's prick. He wraps a hand around. It's scorching hot and wet. He's leaking profusely. He takes mercy and starts to frig him as Watson begins to bounce again.
Watson lets his trousers and drawers fall and demands Holmes to undress before the door has even shut behind them. Watson is naked before Holmes but, by the time he locks the door and turns to his detective, Holmes is too.
Holmes is taken by surprise when Watson grabs him by the shoulders and pins him to the bed. He is roughly fucking himself on the hot, hard prick beneath him. His blonde hair is turning dark from sweat and is beginning to plaster to his forehead.
"I'm your stubborn ol' mule," he smirks.
Without another glance, I head to our room. I rummage through the wardrobe and bureau but, there is no sign of my favorite sweater. The brown one with black elbow patches. I know it's been quite sometime since I last wore it, though I am quite sure I would not have rid of it.
In the bath together, Holmes thinks this evening is exactly what he needed. Watson is gently washing his hair. His inner demons are quieted. He is content and ready to sleep again because Watson will be with him.
Obviously, this letter was shorter than the previous one. To be exact, about 200 words shorter. I don't know how long each letter will be, but I hope I add enough words in there that you all enjoy them! I certainly hope you enjoyed this one! Please leave a comment or kudos if you did! <3 They are always greatly appreciated! I hope you come back on Friday for letter number three!
“Sherlock Holmes was a great man,” Mary began. “He was a great flat mate and an even better friend to my amazing husband.” She held out her hand in a gesture of pointing to John. “He gave us countless smiles, laughs, tears, and fights, but I wouldn’t change any of it for the world. He will be missed dearly.”
Sherlock went to open the door. However, he couldn’t help calling, “I heard that.”
Thank you for reading this story! It took longer than I had anticipated for it to be over, but we've reached the finale. Even though there was a very sad ending, there is a small glimmer of good news. If you enjoyed this story, there is going to be definitely one, possibly two stories that make up a series. Now, here me out. The next one will be a short Irene/Molly fic. I'm still debating about whether or not to do a Mycroft/Lestrade oneshot or not. Either way, keep a look out for both of them. Also, I promise that they will both have a happy ending.
We're coming so close to the end of the story! One more letter and then one last chapter to close it all off. I hope you're preparing yourself for the end and enjoying this story! However, the only way I'll be able to know is if you tell me! Please leave a comment and/or kudos down below! Thank you, you wonderful readers. <3
“John, are you hungry?” she asked him. He was staring at the coffee table. However, he still shook his head no. “Are you thirsty?” Again, the only response was a head shake. Mary sighed again and then walked closer to the coffee table. She swiped at everything that was on top of it, causing all of it to come crashing down. The floor became littered with papers and information from all of the previous cases John did with Sherlock and all of the cases they had lined up.
That day two vows were made. One was between you and Mary, that you would be with each other and love each other until the end of your lives. The second one, which you may or may not have been aware of since this was somewhat all in my head, was between you and me. This vow basically stated that we would be best friends until the end of our lives.
Irene looked over to John. He confirmed Sherlock’s statement with a reassuring head nod. “Well,” Irene proclaimed, clearly flustered. “I guess I shouldn’t have come here anyways. I’ll see myself out.” Irene sashayed over to the door, clearly trying to get Sherlock’s attention. However, it failed. “Well this was a waste of my time.” Irene wrenched open the door and walked out. She quickly slammed the door afterwards.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How can you be so sure of that?” She started walking over to John.
