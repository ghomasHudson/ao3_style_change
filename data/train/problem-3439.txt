It takes all of maybe 2 minutes in the car for Sam to start his interrogation. Dean clears his throat in preparation for the long conversation.
“Been good, can’t complain,” Lee says, then he pauses for a moment to look Dean over as well. “It is
“It’s okay, Cas. So, uh, after she died, I guess I just found it hard to…to put my faith in someone when He could take my mom away from me like that.”
“There’s nothing to talk about, Dean. I knew this could never work. I’m sorry. Please leave,” Cas says.
As soon as they’re in, Cas slams the door shut and presses Dean in between himself and the door, his lips crashing into Dean’s. Dean closes his eyes and melts into the kiss.
The text is opened as soon as it’s sent, and Cas responds with an eggplant emoji and the water droplets emoji, to which Dean responds with two peach emojis and a lotion bottle emoji. Who knew there was a fucking lotion bottle emoji! He laughs to himself and locks his phone.
“This looks fantastic, Eileen,” Dean says as he signs. Cas clears his throat next to him. “And Cas,” Dean says, rolling his eyes and kissing Cas on the cheek.
Cas begins a steady rhythm pulling almost all the way out and then pushing back in, provoking moans of pleasure from Dean almost in sync.
“Actually, I-uh, I think ‘m done for t’night,” Dean replies. He flashes her a smile and says, “thank you, though, for all this. And all the, uh, yeah.”
This was the last thing Cas sent Dean before he broke up with him the next day. Dean’s eyes start to water as he dials Cas’ number.
“I hope y’all saved room for dessert. This is Mary Winchester’s famous apple pie. So good, it’ll make you wanna slap your momma,” Dean jokes.
“I’m never leaving this bed,” Dean says as he cuddles up against one of the pillows and closes his eyes.
“No, Jack. He, uh, he just needs time to process,” Sam clears his throat. “So, uh, what did you find in the book about the spell?
They get to the Roadhouse a few minutes later and head straight inside to a table in the back where Sam and Jess are already seated.
He rolls up to the studio around 1 in the afternoon. He nods in greeting at Rachel, the receptionist, and heads down the hallway to recording room 2. When he walks in, he sees Bobby sitting in one of the swivel chairs in front of the sound mixing board.
They’re shuffled to a stage with a giant curtain closed in front of them. They move everything into position as they hear Alicia Keys announce him:
“So, did your wish come true?” Cas mumbles from the bathroom, his mouth full of toothpaste as he brushes his teeth.
“Cas sacrificed himself to save me. He told me-,” Dean swallows. “He told me he loved me, Sam. And the empty was coming, there wasn’t enough time. There just wasn’t enough time and I…I didn’t get to say it back,” his voice cracks. He covers his face in his hands again, his shoulders shake.
“It’s a very good song, Dean. I admire your ability to take an experience and turn it into something so amazing.”
Dean gets back to his house around 11. He doesn’t see Cas’ car, so he figures if Cas did stop by last night, he didn’t stay.
“We, uh,” Dean stutters, heat rising on the back of his neck, “we kind of had a thing a few years back. Me, Cain, and uh, Colette.”
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. Clearly you’re not comfortable with whatever it is,” Cas answers.
Claire laughs as she plops herself down on the couch, reaching out for Kaia’s hand to pull her down with her.
Dean kisses him back, reaching his good hand up to grip Lee’s long hair while the other rests on his waist.
“Glad to see you’re still alive,” Sam says walking over to open up the curtains, letting in such an obscene amount of sunlight that it makes Dean squeeze his eyes shut and turn away from it.
The group decided to meet up for dinner at seven at a restaurant a few miles from their hotel. Dean and Cas end up being the last to arrive so the entire table stares at them, cracking jokes about why they’re late.
He looks around and sees that the couch is empty. Maybe Cas moved into his bed last night after Dean fell asleep?
“Alright, enough dilly dallying, boys. Y’all better go get prettied up before the red carpet,” Bobby says, shooing them all out of the rehearsal area.
“Right,” Dean clears his throat and turns his attention back to the DVD’s. “Ahh, here we go,” Dean says as he pulls a movie off one of the shelves.
“Then don’t do it for us. Do it for you. Do it because you deserve better than this. You deserve to be treated like the great guy I know you are,” Benny says.
Castiel looks at Dean sympathetically. Of course he wouldn’t want to talk about this. Castiel feels guilty for bringing up the topic of his own mother.
“No worries, man. We’ve all been there. Good to have you back in the studio. Song’s almost over, then I’ll introduce you and start the interview. Sound good?” Storme asks.
“He didn’t want you to worry,” Jack says. “He knew you would try to get him out of it, but he’d made peace with it.”
He slides his thumb over Dean’s slit, spreading precome over the head of Dean’s dick. Dean moans and reaches down to jerk himself off until Cas pulls his hand away.
Dean drives a few miles out of town and down a long stretch of dirt road. Bobby and Jody live in a large farmhouse with a lot of land just outside of Nashville. When he gets there, he walks up and knocks on the oversized door several times before Bobby actually opens it.
“Hey, you wanna come in for a beer?” Dean offers. “Nah, I have an early morning. I’ve already been out way later than I should’ve been,” Sam replies.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean replies, awkwardly running a hand over the back of his neck, “you uh-, you wanna grab a table?”
Surprisingly, Dean feels somewhat relieved after telling Cas all of that. It feels like a weight has been lifted off of his shoulders and it’s one less thing Dean has to hide from Cas. He sighs and looks down at his plate.
“That was awesome, Dean. We’re really excited for the album release. And I mean it about you coming back and giving us the scoop on your mystery boo,” MC says, still fishing for details.
As soon as they’re inside, Dean pushes Cas up against the door and crashes his lips into his. Cas reaches up and rests a hand on the back of Dean’s head, kissing him back.
“How could you think you didn’t mean enough to me for me to write about you? Hell, I probably have, like, twenty songs in old notebooks ‘bout you. Just never recorded most of ‘em,” Dean continues.
He pulls up to Green Hills a few hours later, once Sam gets out of court. He texts him and tells him to meet him outside of the Macy’s.
Twenty minutes later, they pull into the parking lot of a restaurant whose sign reads ‘Raising Cain’s’.
“I know, I’m sorry,” he says. Cas stares down at their hands, avoiding Dean’s eyes. After a moment, he adds, “are you ever gonna be okay with this?”
“You’re the first man I’ve ever been attracted to, Dean. And I didn’t call because…because I wasn’t sure-I’m not sure-what that means,” Castiel continues.
“So, I know Dean understands how hard it is to come to terms with yourself and be proud enough of who you are to come out to others. I just think that sometimes he forgets how long it takes. He’s been out since he was fifteen, you know, so I think it’s just one of those things where he lets his eagerness to show you off cloud that part of his brain that knows these things take time,” Sam finishes.
Dean gets home just before 2 and heads right into his studio to continue working on the song he started yesterday.
“Uh, hmm,” Dean stutters, looking down at the dark brick, “well, Cas, usually my old man’s trick works, but, uh, I think this one might be a little too far gone.”
“Hey everybody,” Dean starts as the bar begins to quiet down, “my name is Dean Winchester,” the whole bar begins to cheer, Sam being the loudest and most embarrassing. Dean laughs and continues, “this song I’m about to sing is one y’all haven’t heard yet, so, I hope y’all enjoy it,” he finishes as the bar cheers again and the music starts to play.
Benny’s face falls, but he gets it. He tells Dean to take the limo back to the hotel and that they’ll catch a cab back later. Dean thanks him for the lap dance and heads out.
Cas walks out of his bedroom ten minutes later wearing an outfit identical to the one he wore the other day to the coffee shop. His tie is backwards again, and Dean’s tempted to fix it, but it’s kinda cute, so he elects to leave it.
“It’s not, it’s just as fucking terrifying as all the other times. But this time-,” Dean cuts himself off as Benny and Andrea walk up to them. “Hey, Ben. ‘Bout damn time!” He says, changing the subject.
“Sounds good,” Cas smiles and kisses Dean again. He can do this. If Dean’s gonna be by his side, he can do anything.
Dean starts pounding into Cas’ ass harder than before and Cas is almost screaming with pleasure at this point.
He lays his head on Dean’s shoulder and they sit there panting for a few minutes before Lee lifts himself off of Dean’s softening dick. He wipes them both down with the closest article of clothing within reach before throwing himself down on the bed next to Dean.
“I’m sure. If worrying about how the rest of them will respond is the biggest thing holding me back, then I need to address it in order to move forward with you.”
Dean pushes inside Cas and Cas arches his back up in response to the stretching heat now occupying his backside. He squeezes his eyes shut and purses his lips.
“That’s your problem. You’re not a man. Never were. Dunno where I went wrong with you, ‘cause I sure as shit didn’t raise a girl and yet, here you are,” John says. It takes everything in Dean not to lunge at him and beat him bloody, but what good would that do?
They were so good together. In every single way, they were so good. And Dean resents Cas. He resents him for not wanting to come out. He resents him for putting Dean through the best seven months of his life only to rip them away. He resents Cas for making him fall in love with him.
“It’s fine. I’ll talk to you tomorrow, okay?” Cas says as he kisses Dean on the cheek. The other cheek.
“Wow, uh, okay yeah, of course,” Dean says, taking it all in. He’s not on the same level as Blake Shelton or Luke Bryan, much less George Strait or Hank Williams Jr. He’s in a state of shock right now that Blake specifically asked for his appearance.
“I’m, uh, gonna give y’all a minute. I’ll be downstairs,” Benny says before shutting the door behind him.
Dean scoffs as he stares down at his phone. He reads the text a few more times to make sure he didn’t misread it. Nope, Cas ignored him intentionally.
Dean remembers the coffee Cas made for him and he walks back into the kitchen. He takes a big swig of it and then immediately turns to spit it in the sink. It’s ice cold. Fucking perfect.
Dean laughs, not bad is an understatement. Dean’s never felt pleasure like that before in his entire life. He thought being the one to cause that sort of reaction was the most pleasurable thing in bed, but god was he wrong. So fucking wrong.
“Jody has us check in with her regularly while we’re on hunts. I think if we’d tried to go longer than two hours without at least a text, she’d send a search party,” Kaia reassures him.
“I feel like I’m gonna throw up. I don’t know if I can do this,” he says, looking more worried than Cas has ever seen him before.
Dean wakes up to his alarm blaring at 8 o’clock. He has to be at the Highway studio by 9, so he reluctantly pulls himself out of bed and into the shower. He steps into the searing hot stream of water and immediately relaxes. He hadn’t realized how tense he was until the heat hit his body.
Benny walks right over to Dean, grabbing his face in his hands and planting a big, sloppy kiss on Dean’s cheek.
Dean groans as Cas pulls himself out of Dean and heads into the bathroom. When he doesn’t follow, Cas emerges from the bathroom and helps him to his feet.
Benny knocks on Dean’s door around nine in the morning. When there’s no answer, he lets himself inside and heads up to Dean’s bedroom.
Dean wants to hug Cas, but he’s not sure if he would be okay with that in public either, so he refrains and instead, he pats Cas on the back and asks him to join him back over at the table with Sam, Jess, and Benny.
The woman pauses for a moment as she pulls John’s file. She furrows her brow and then looks up at Dean.
“I didn’t mean to force you into doing that. So soon, I mean. There are other ways to...,” he trails off.
The rest of the brunch goes a lot smoother than it started. They get back to Dean’s house around 2 and the second they shut the door behind them, Dean has Cas pinned up against it.
Cas leaves Dean standing there outside of his building. He doesn’t know how long he’d been standing there staring at his reflection in the door before the driver honks the horn, snapping him back to reality.
Dean raises an eyebrow at Sam and laughs as he wraps an arm around Cas’ waist and takes a sip from his own mug.
Dean takes one more look at himself in the mirror before getting up and shaking himself off. He can do this. He’s got his favorite lucky boots on, plus Bobby and Cas are right, he knows these songs like the back of his hand.
“I brought your clothes back,” Cas says, holding up a gym bag. “I washed them, that’s why I’m a little late.”
“Okay baby,” she says as she straddles Dean again, “you just let me know if you want me to stop, but remember, I’m here to please you.”
Colette comes up to their table with their food. Dean and Cas smile and thank her and after she walks away, Dean continues.
He finishes the second song and the entire crowd erupts into cheers. He’s riding a high right now that he hasn’t felt since their last tour ended.
Dean starts unbuckling Cas’ pants, not allowing his lips to leave Cas’. He slides Cas’ pants down around his thighs and Cas wiggles his hips to get them further down.
“What’re the specials tonight, El?” Benny Lafitte, Dean’s drummer, asked the bartender with a thick, Louisiana drawl.
“No, fuck no, m’dad woulda lost his shit if he caught us like that,” Dean laughs. “He’s still-that’s a story for ‘nother day. No, the paparazzi caught us. ‘m kinda famous, so they follow me around sometimes.”
He pulls into the studio where the Highway records at about ten past 9. Fucking traffic. He runs into the studio and the receptionist directs him down the hallway and to the left, third door down. He looks through the window of the door and Mary Carlisle, Storme’s co-host, waves him inside.
Jess pulls an apron out of the pantry closet next to the kitchen and asks Dean how she can help. Meanwhile, Sam sets his phone up to play some music. Dean laughs when he hears his own voice through the speakers.
A series of “yes’” and “mhm’s” answer his question as everyone packs onto the shuttle. Cas notices Dean is getting antsy again so he places his hand on Dean’s knee and starts rubbing it with his thumb. Dean smiles at him and puts his hand on top of Cas’. Only a few short hours and they’ll be safely back in Nashville.
After fifteen minutes of Dean going over the thousands of reasons why he thought they were, in fact, not ready to be parents, Claire informed him that this little girl was brought to Jody by a young woman who decided she wasn’t cut out to be a mom. Jody brought her home and they all agreed that putting her in the system would be cruel and that the best thing for her would be to go to a good home. When Alex suggested Dean and Cas, Jody got on the phone with Sam that night to make sure they’d be willing. “Merry Christmas, old man,” Claire said to him before putting the baby in his arms. “Don’t say I never did anything for ya.”
“Just wanted to see if there was anything I can do to help with the release,” Dean answers, innocently.
He sits on the bed next to Cas, refusing to look at him. Neither of them say anything for what feels like forever.
“Alright, alright, enough of that. I’m gonna go grab another beer,” Benny winks as Luke Bryan and a pretty blonde woman walk up to them.
“Oh shit, Dean, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you had company. Sam said-,” Benny starts before Dean cuts him off.
Dean opens it to find Cas in a dark blue button down and medium wash jeans. He looks Cas over and bites his lip.
He runs his good hand through his hair and steps out onto the balcony to get some air. Benny joins him a few minutes later, putting his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Sam steps in and brings Michael up to speed on the plan. Now that they all understand their parts, it’s showtime.
Dean walks into the large, western styled farm home. It smells like Jody’s been baking all day, he closes his eyes and takes in the decadent scent.
“See ya later, Sammy,” Dean says, rushing to shut the car door before Sam can protest the nickname again.
They all laugh as Cas jumps onto the other side of the bed, nearly knocking Dean off with the bounce.
Jody raises her eyebrows and cocks her head to the side in that motherly way she’s been doing since Dean can remember.
He must’ve dozed off at some point during the Dr. Sexy marathon he was watching because the next thing he knows, it’s almost seven in the morning.
“Benny, you ask me that every time y’all come in here and it’s the same damn thing every time. Burgers, wings, and beer. That’s it, so you gonna order, or are you gonna keep acting like a dumbass?” The woman glared at him.
“We love you so much, Castiel. Nothing is ever going to change that,” Naomi says, squeezing his hand.
Bobby has been texting and calling him nonstop to schedule rehearsal dates for the tour that’s rapidly approaching. Benny has called and texted a few times and so has Sam. But Dean’s not in the mood to talk to anyone other than Cas, so he just isn’t. That is until Sam and Benny show up to his house unannounced (or maybe announced, who knows. It’s not like he’s been checking their messages).
“Oh my god,” Cas responds, sounding much more awake than before. “Is he okay? Dean, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for you.”
“Look, Dean, I know you’ve been having a tough time since…everything happened,” Sam treads carefully, “but you can’t let it get in the way of your life.”
“Dean, cut it out!” Sam scolds, pressing the button again to close the roof, “I like my car. You need to update the Impala. Or better yet, upgrade it.”
“I, uh, I’m kinda freakin’ out a little bit, not gonna lie,” Dean says, rubbing a hand over the back of his neck. “What if I fuck this up, Bobby? What if I forget the words to one of the songs or if I trip or what if I-,”
Dean avoids making eye contact with Bobby as he peers his head around the entrance to the kitchen, hoping to catch sight of Jody so he has a reason not to answer Bobby’s question. Unfortunately, she’s not in there, so he looks at Bobby and says,
Castiel starts cracking up while Dean sits there with that smug grin still on his face, stretching from ear to ear. See? He knew he was funny, Sam can kiss his ass.
“Damn, Cas. This is-this is quite a collection,” Dean’s a little surprised at the number of DVDs in front of him. He’s always considered himself well versed in the movie world, but some of the movie titles he’s reading he’s never even heard of.
Dean laughs. He and Sam have known Bobby since they were kids. Bobby has always been the father figure that Dean turned to when his own father wasn’t there. John Winchester was an asshole and a drunk. In his defense, he wasn’t always like that. It wasn’t until Dean’s mother, Mary, passed away in a car accident when Dean was eleven that John turned to alcohol to cope. When John was drunk, he got angry. He would take his anger out on Dean. Dean would never let him take his anger out on Sam, so Dean was always the punching bag whenever John Winchester needed to hit someone. Thankfully, Bobby was there to offer guidance and acceptance when John wasn’t. It was Bobby that got Dean interested in music in the first place. Bobby convinced John to pack the boys up and move with him to Nashville nearly 15 years ago. He said it was to put Dean in the environment of music, to prepare him for the life, but Dean thinks it was more to keep him and Sam safe and still under Bobby’s watch when his job took him east.
“As promised, this morning we’re joined by none other than Dean Winchester! It’s good to have you back in the studio, Dean. How you been?” Storme says by way of introduction.
Once they’ve finished eating, they go for a walk along the beach. They walk up and down the beach for a while and it feels like hours have passed. Then they watched the sun go down as they sat in the sand near some dimly lit wooden torches.
“Come on, Dean. You’ve been MIA for nearly a week. Time to get out of bed and do something,” Sam says.
“Right? Me either! But the manager of the hotel insisted I try it and when I did, I immediately fell in love with the flavor.”
“Well I’ll tell you what, if things start to go south, you give me the bat signal and we’ll high tail it outta there. Sound good?”
Colette seats them at a table by the window, gets their drink order, and lets them know she’ll be back in a few minutes to get their food order.
Dean leans over and kisses Cas’ lips. Cas turns his body so he’s facing Dean, keeping his eyes closed as Dean kisses him again.
“Wow, man, the stories I’ve heard about you,” Benny says as he reaches a hand out to Lee before remembering what he walked in on and quickly retracting it.
He knows it shouldn’t bother him, Cas doesn’t do it to offend him, but he can’t help but selfishly wish Cas would come to terms with his sexuality already so Dean can just be flirty and hold his hand and kiss him and wrap his arms around him in public.
Cas leans over to look him in the eyes, but instead he’s met with a light snore. Dean is already asleep.
Dean laughs, relaxing a little as he does, “sorry, Cas. I’m just trying to brace myself. I’ve never felt it, but experience on that end of things, I know it hurts at first.”
“Alright, Imma be the one to ask the awkward question no one seems to wanna ask. Sam, how’s your daddy doin’,” Benny says.
He gets off the bed and starts to undress. He needs to go to sleep before he does something even more stupid than trying to call Cas.
“No, no, I don’t wanna stop,” Dean starts to relax, and he leans up to look at Cas. “Keep going, I want you to keep going.”
Dean unlocks his front door and walks straight into the living room where he sees Cas standing there staring back at him.
Dean gets back to the hotel around four in the morning, now adorning an ivory-colored cast from the base of his fingers to the middle of his forearm. He heads back up to his room, turns everything off and goes to sleep. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
“…That she reminds me of mom…” Sam adds, “And, well, you know how he gets when we mention mom. Anyway, we were arguing, and I said that he didn’t have to always shut down conversations about mom. That we can still talk about her and our memories of her. And I guess he just kind of lost it. Started throwing anything within arms reach and I tried to grab something from him to stop him from chucking it across the room and he jerked his arm out of my hands and elbowed me in the eye. You walked in when he was about to take his second swing at me,” Sam finishes, looking defeated.
“Oh, it’s Benny’s. I couldn’t find mine this morning, so I borrowed one of his,” Dean says, looking back up to Cas’ face and smiling.
“Couple of days? Bold of you to assume getting fucked by Dean Winchester won’t leave its mark for longer than a couple of days,” Dean teases.
“The gash in her shoulder that I gave her from her blade, it was fatal. She said before she died that she, uh, she wanted to see me dead. So, me and Cas, we ran. We locked ourselves in the dungeon and Cas warded it against her, but the warding wasn’t gonna be able to wait her out.”
As he stands there fucking around with the stupid machine, Cas walks out of his room in nothing but a towel.
The three of them sit and talk for a while to catch up. Claire tells Dean about the hunts they’ve gone on since the last time they saw each other. Dean reminisces about hunts he’d gone on in the past. He tells them stories of the times he almost died and of the times he actually did die. He won’t admit it, but sometimes he misses hunting. He loves the life he has now and he wouldn’t trade Cas or Alma Grace for the world, but a small part of him misses the action, the adrenaline rush that came with going on a hunt. He gets to share his knowledge and tips with Claire and Kaia, though, and that’s enough for him.
“Alright, alright, enough hating on my pizza. We’ll order two, you baby,” Cas says as he sticks his tongue out at Dean.
Dean stands up and pulls a box out of his back pocket, then he joins Cas on one knee and opens the box without a word.
“Yeah, yeah that sounds good. What kind of pizza do you like?” Dean asks as he sits down, hoping Cas has decent taste in toppings.
“Yeah,” Cas chuckles again, “yeah it’s definitely not the best couch in the world. I was gonna ask you if you wanted to move to my bed last night, but you looked so peaceful, I didn’t want to wake you.”
“Party starts at 5,” Dean raises his voice a bit so he can be heard from inside the closet. “I was thinking we could probably get there at, like, 4:30 or so, just to see if Bobby needs any help.”
Dean closes his eyes as he lets the water run down his back. Cas watches him adoringly and then he leans in to kiss him.
She bites his earlobe and starts kissing his neck. He throws his head back and puts his hand on her waist.
Dean is scheduled to meet Bobby and the rest of the band in the lobby of the hotel first thing in the morning. Once he joins them, they head out to the venue where tonight’s show is being held.
They start in on their salads. Dean has never been a huge fan of salad, no matter how many times Sam tried to tell him they’re good for him and that they’re not that bad. Yeah, maybe if you’re a fucking rabbit.
deserve it, Dean. You put your heart and soul into this album. Nothing you’ve ever put out before is realer’n this one,” Bobby says back.
Dean spends about an hour in the booth fixing little issues on tracks here and there. Then he and Bobby make a few minor changes to the album and Bobby sends him home.
“What can I get for ya, hun?” A short, plump woman with red curly hair and stains on her apron asks.
“Dean?” he hears Sam call from down the hall. He doesn’t respond. “Yeah, Jack, do you mind starting to dig into the lore? I’ll be right there once I find Dean.”
Cas watches his partner interact with their daughter with adoration. He’ll never need more than this.
Dean walks back out into the kitchen and looks for a coffee maker. All he finds, though, is one of those hippie dippie single cup brewers. He rolls his eyes and tries to figure out how to make himself a cup.
“Not yet,” Dean says. He tosses his shirt in the general direction of the laundry hamper as he comes up behind Cas, swaying as he walks.
“Don’t worry about Sam and Jess. I, uh, I kinda already told Sam about you…,” Dean trails off, worried about how Cas will respond to that.
“Half an hou-,” Dean starts to ask as the line goes dead. He pulls the phone away from his ear, “see you in half an hour, Cas,” he says to no one.
“I’m sorry,” Bart chuckles. “I don’t know if Castiel told you, but I’m a preacher. I’m always trying to find my...my flock, so to speak.”
Dean smiles down at her and wraps her in a hug. Cas watches them and smiles as his father appears in the doorway.
The three of them make their way further into the crowded restaurant as Benny walks up to Dean and hands him a whiskey on ice.
“Or maybe not,” Dean says, his face falling a little. He rubs a hand over his face. “Fuck...yeah. Yeah, that’s, uh, that’s a good idea,” he manages to piece together.
“Well, lucky for us, we have a master chef at our disposal,” Sam says, wrapping an arm around Eileen’s shoulder and squeezing her into him.
Dean contemplates walking out the door anyway. Nashville is a big enough city, he could probably leave and get away with never seeing Castiel ever again. He almost does when he locks eyes with Charlie. The look on her face tells him to sit his ass back down and hear Cas out, so he sighs and sits.
Castiel gets up from the table and extends a hand to Dean. Dean takes his hand and stands up to follow him into his bedroom.
“I have something I wanna talk to you about,” Dean says, looking at Charlie. “I’ve been wracking my brain and I just need another opinion or two.
“I mean he’s gone, Sam. And I-,” his eyes well up again. He rubs his fists into them and tries to stop the tears from falling, but he can’t.
“Oh, yes please!” Sam says, excitedly taking one of the mugs in both hands and bringing it up to his nose. “Mmm,” he says as he closes his eyes and takes in the strong scent.
Dean, Cas, and Bart all take seats comfortably in the Novaks’ living room while Naomi finishes dinner.
15 minutes and 22 dollars later, the cab pulls up to the curb outside his apartment building. Dean gets out and helps Castiel get out and up to the exterior door.
Dean feels like such a little bitch right now. He’s getting so worked up over something so trivial and for what? So he can pick a fight with Cas? What good is that going to do? Cas hasn’t responded yet, so Dean texts him again.
“I got you these,” Dean says as he hands the flowers to Cas, “it’s kinda cheesy to bring flowers I guess, but-“
“Your father is bleeding internally from injuries sustained in the accident. Unfortunately, due to his inebriated state, we aren’t able to operate right away without risk of complications. Over the next couple of hours, we’ll keep him in a medically induced coma in order to prevent further irritation or injury. Once his blood alcohol content is low enough, we will operate,” the doctor explains.
“You’re not fine. Far from it, brother. I saw the trash bag full of empty liquor bottles, which I’m assuming Sam gathered up because, according to him, you had hardly left your bed in days when he stopped by. I guess that didn’t last, though, huh? Lee, Dean?” Benny steers the conversation back to the initial topic.
“It’s okay, Sammy. I’m on my way,” Dean says as he gets back in the Impala and heads to Nashville General.
“Alright, Sam. I believe you, and I’m happy for you,” Dean smiles, clapping Sam on the back, “let’s go look at rings.”
“It’s a client I’m defending on a faulty drug charge. Nothing major, but ya gotta start somewhere, right?” Sam says, bashfully.
“We just finished the last song on the album. Bobby sent us home for the night.” Dean replied. They’ve been working day and night on this album for almost a year. Dean had a handful of songs from the beginning that he wanted on this album, but he wants it to be perfect, so he took his time choosing the rest of the tracks.
“Yeah, Cas, it’s okay, but uh, I was kinda thinkin’ we could…you know, before Sam and Jess get back,” Dean says.
“Hey,” Dean says, putting his hand on Cas’ chin and turning his face up towards his own, “I’ll text you. We can plan another date soon.”
14 hours. That’s how long Dean and his band were in the studio today recording and preparing for their new album, Laps Around the Sun. They finished the last track on the album around when the clock hit 9:30. Bobby Singer, their manager, decided it was time to call it quits for the night and send everyone home. Dean’s guitarist, Crowley MacLeod, suggested they all head over to the Roadhouse for some burgers and a few rounds before the night ends. That sounded like a pretty damn good idea to Dean, considering he hadn’t eaten in probably 12 hours.
As Dean walks over, the curly haired woman across from Charlie sees him and a huge smile appears on her face.
Dean smiles back down at him and then they all head into the living room. Sam sets the presents they brought under Dean’s tree and then joins Jess in the large loveseat, opposite Dean and Cas on the couch.
“Well, I’ll be damned. What are you boys doing in here on a Thursday night?” A raspy voice asked from behind the bar.
“Castiel,” Bart begins, and Cas can already feel the heat rising on the back of his neck as he interjects.
The rest of the band gives Ellen their orders and then they make their way over to the pool table for a couple games. Dean stays seated at the bar talking to Jo for a minute to catch up. He’s about to get up and join his bandmates when someone at the end of the bar catches his eye. A tall figure with dark hair and bright blue eyes.
“So, that song was written about someone you met the other night? Why didn’t you tell me about it?” Sam starts.
“I appreciate that, Sam. It took a lot for me to do that, but it was something that had to be done. I don’t want Dean to feel like I’m ashamed of him…of us. This whole thing is just unknown territory for me. I’m learning as I go,” Cas says.
Sam doesn’t say anything about it though. He follows Dean down the stairs, noticing the bags sitting outside the laundry room that Dean still hasn’t unpacked from the tour.
“I know you’re hurtin’, brother. And it’s not my business who you decide to sleep with to take that hurt away, but just remember that it’s only temporary relief. Just like a bottle,” Benny pats him on the back.
Christmas morning, Dean wakes up to the smell of coffee brewing. He smiles and opens his eyes, jumping out of bed to meet Cas downstairs.
“Alright, I got some stuff to work out with the album release and press coverage. Get outta here ‘fore I make you sit and make phone calls with me.” Bobby threatens.
“She was right, this will pair nicely,” Cas says as he unscrews the cork and pours a glass for Dean and himself.
“I, uh, I didn’t think I’d ever hear from you again. Not after how we left things…,” the man trails off.
“I guess they don’t call it a one-night stand for nothing, if that would even count as a one-night stand,” he mumbles to himself.
Here we go. Exactly what Dean was expecting to happen is happening. Cas isn’t in to him, and he took things too far that night. If only he’d just left like he-,
As he pulls his jeans off, he realizes he’s still half hard, so he kicks his boxers off and makes his way into the bathroom to jerk himself off in the shower.
He starts pulling open drawers in his bathroom until he finds what he’s looking for; cover-up. Good thing he let Andy convince him to dress in drag to go to that bar a few months back. Not necessarily something Dean is going to start doing regularly, but he'll admit it was fun.
As soon as Claire had let Cas know that she and Kaia were on their way, he and Eileen started cooking.
“I’m not fucking doing this with you, dad. It’s Christmas for fuck’s sake,” Dean says, rubbing his cheek.
“After he left my apartment, he drove. He got into an accident and he’s, uh, Dean it’s pretty bad,” Sam says, on the verge of tears.
“You’re not gonna fuck it up, boy,” Bobby cuts him off. “You’re a natural born performer. You’ve been performing in front of people since you were in diapers. You know those songs like the back of your hand, you’ve rehearsed them countless times. I’m sure you could probably sing them in your sleep at this point.”
“My father loves movies. He used to take us to midnight screenings all the time. Trips to New York to see plays on Broadway, he really loves the theatrical arts,” Castiel says.
As much as it pains Dean to leave, he doesn’t want to push Castiel, even though he’s the one offering for him to stay longer. They had dinner, made out, and had sex. He doesn’t want to overwhelm Castiel his first time with a man. Plus, if he stays longer, sitting in silence with Cas during a movie, Cas might start thinking and realize this was a huge mistake and kick Dean out and never want to see him again. Dean doesn’t want to risk that, so it’s better if he just leaves.
“We, uh,” Dean closes his eyes as Diamond begins unbuttoning his shirt. “We were t’gether for, uh, for seven months.” Diamond starts kissing and nibbling at his chest and down his abdomen.
Dean hadn’t realized three whole days had gone by. He slept through most of that time and when he wasn’t sleeping, he was drinking, which means Sam’s probably right. He needs to eat something.
“I hope you like spaghetti,” Cas says, breaking the awkward silence, “it’s really the only thing I know how to make.”
Dean walks back out of the closet and stands in front of Cas, grabbing his hands and pulling him to his feet so that they’re at eye level.
He beings stroking Dean’s dick to the same rhythm which causes Dean to throw his head back and moan even louder.
She reaches out and pulls him into a tight hug. Castiel towers over her. So much so that she almost disappears into his chest completely.
Dean smiles around Cas’ cock and he continues to bob his head, licking the underside of his dick each time he comes back up.
“That’s not what I said, I-,” Dean groans as he rubs his hands over his face. “Benny and I are not sleeping together, Cas. The only person I’m sleeping with is you,” Dean says, taking a step towards Cas again.
One hour until Dean and the guys go on stage to open for Luke. Cas, Sam, Jess, and the rest of the band’s guests showed up to watch the show. Dean catches a glimpse of Jess and Caroline chatting it up while Sam and Cas huddle together in the corner.
Dean’s not sure how to talk to Cas right now, either. What does this mean? So, Cas is attracted to him. That doesn’t automatically mean they’re gonna start dating now. Clearly, he’s uncomfortable with this new-found revelation.
“Hang on, Cas. We’re gonna figure this out,” Dean says, reaching for Cas’ hand. Cas pulls it away and bends over to collect his bags from the floor of the car.
“They won’t let me be in there with him,” Sam says as Dean pulls out of the hug to look him in the eye.
“Hey Cas, it’s me. I know you’re not talking to me and I’m trying to give you your space, but I really hope you listen to this. I just wanted to check on you and make sure everything’s okay. I know this was a huge thing that you didn’t want your family finding out and I don’t know if they have yet, but uh, I just-I know you won’t wanna talk to me but you can always talk to Sam. Or, hell, any of the guys, if you just need someone who knows and won’t judge you. I’m here if you do end up wanting to talk though,” he hits the end call button and stares at his phone for a minute. He wants nothing more than to hear Cas’ voice right now.
“What about our fans? What about all the shows already announced, all the tickets already sold?” Dean asks.
The doctor walks up to Sam and Dean about an hour and a half later. They both jump to their feet in anticipation.
“They’re gonna be a blast. Mexico is always a trip. I’ve never had a bad show there, knock on wood,” he says as knocks on the bar to his left.
“’m actually not looking for anythin’ tonight, ma’am, but thank you,” he says to her, his words slurred from the alcohol.
A few days go by and Dean hasn’t heard from Cas. He’s left him messages and sent him a ton of texts, but Cas is ignoring him. In turn, Dean is ignoring everyone else in his life.
Cas’ immediate reaction is anger, but his face quickly relaxes and turns into more of a worried expression again.
“Whatever. So, you gonna tell me why you’ve been holed up in your house for the last couple of days? Isn’t your album coming out in a few weeks? Why aren’t you out promoting?”
for Christ’s sake. Let’s go explore!” Sam says, throwing one of the rolled up towels from the neatly stacked pyramid at his head.
The backstage crew rushes them off stage so they can set up the next performer as Dean pulls out his phone to text Cas.
“Perfect!” Dean says, “now look here, you take the warm pie and you scoop a bit of ice cream on top. Now they’re ready to eat.”
Once everyone is in position, Sam begins the summoning spell. Within seconds, Chuck is standing before them. Dean rushes him and stabs an angel blade into his back. He doesn’t even flinch.
The door to the hotel room opens and Dean pulls away from Cas and grabs a towel to wrap around his waist.
He reaches down and starts to jerk Dean off, leaning in to kiss him softly. Dean’s not in the mood for soft though, so he reaches up and takes a handful of Cas’ hair and presses his mouth against Cas’. Cas opens his mouth and allows his tongue to enter. Dean scrapes his teeth across Cas’ bottom lip and draws a low moan out of Cas’ throat.
Ash is pretty firm in this idea of a medley, for some reason. Dean, however, is pretty certain he doesn’t want to do one, but in order to move on from the conversation, he tells Ash to go ahead and rework it and he’ll take a listen.
They laugh as Dean goes around to sit in the chair across from her. His face falls a little as he remembers why he’s here, and Charlie notices almost immediately.
They make their way into the house and Cas just kind of stands there in the doorway, completely awestruck.
Dean and Cas walk back out to the rental in the driveway. Once they’re inside, they sit for a moment in silence before Dean turns the car on.
They pull into the driveway of Cas’ childhood home at a quarter to 5. Cas doesn’t move at first, so Dean watches him and waits.
The Roadhouse is only a few blocks from the studio, so the guys decided to just walk. None of them planned on being sober enough to drive home anyway, so leaving their cars in the garage at the studio sounded like a better idea than leaving them in the open parking lot of the bar. They walked in at about a quarter to 10 and were greeted with loud music and even louder voices.
“Aw, come on, Dean. Hang out for a while. We’ve pretty much been working all day. Stay and have some fun,” Benny pleads.
They stand there for a moment, breathing each other in between each kiss. Dean has his good hand still on Cas’ arm and he’s moved his right hand up to awkwardly cup Cas’ head.
“Hey, man. I’m really excited to watch you perform tonight,” Luke says once they make it to the venue.
Cas smiles, grateful that Dean feels the same way. They undress and climb into Dean’s bed, falling asleep within minutes, Cas nestled comfortably under Dean’s arm.
Cas gets up and holds his hand out for Dean to take so he can help him up but instead, Dean pulls Cas back down on top of him and kisses him again.
Dean gets back home around one o’clock and he doesn’t know what to do with himself. There’s still 6 hours until he has to be at Cas’ apartment and he’s sitting around twiddling his thumbs. He tries to watch a couple episodes of his favorite show, Dr. Sexy, one that he’ll never admit is his favorite, but he can’t pay attention to it. He gets up and goes into his studio, maybe he can write to pass the time.
Dean is silent. He’s awake, but he can’t bring himself to care about anything anymore. So, what if the world is ending? His already has.
Dean sets down the spatula in his hand and walks over to them. He puts a hand on her back and kisses her on the nose.
“C’mon Cas, they’re my best friends. And, again, this was all before I knew. Plus, Charlie’s gay so she’s gonna be the last person to have any sort of negative opinion about it,” Dean says to his defense.
“Now, Dean, didn’t Castiel tell you? We’re huggers in this family,” she says, holding her arms out. “Come on, bring it in.”
“Thanks man,” Dean smiles back. “Oh hey, I’m really looking forward to the Cancun shows this summer.”
They stand there making out against the door, Dean’s knee is positioned between Cas’ legs as he ruts his hips against him.
“Have, uh,” Dean stutters. This is always a hard conversation to have with anyone and with Cas having never been with a man before, it may be something he’s never closely considered. “Have you, like recently, uh, you know…been tested?”
He lays his head back down on the pillow and rolls over to find Benny lying next to him, still sound asleep.
Dean steps away from the mic, turns around, and cups his hands over his mouth. The crowd cheers and applauds as he stands there for a moment before walking backstage. He bends over and puts his hands on his knees doing his best not to break down right there. Performing this song was a mistake, he wasn’t ready for his fans to hear how pathetic he is over this break up.
As the band walks on stage and the crowd cheers, Sam, Cas and the rest of the guests get comfortable in front of the large screen to watch the performance.
Dean goes nearly a week without speaking to Cas. Ignoring any messages and any calls he gets from him. He spends most of his time with Bobby and the band, working on tour details for the one they’re planning next fall. Benny asks him about Cas a couple times, but Dean tells him to drop it each time, so Benny finally stops asking.
“Believe it or not, Cas, this ain’t my first rodeo,” Dean says. “I’ve pretty much been in charge of Thanksgiving dinner since I learned how to work a stove.”
Nice bedside manner. How’d this chick ever get certified to be a nurse? As annoyed as Dean is, though, he can’t help but bite his lip at how authoritative she is. But, despite being slightly turned on, he ignores the urge to flirt a little to get his way and he walks back over to Sam.
Everyone, including Bobby and Jody, show up one after the other and they board the plane soon after that. Cas continues to reassure Dean that he’s fine and that he’s safe for the entire flight to Cancun, Mexico.
“Claire and Kaia will be here soon,” Cas says. “Why don’t we head into the den and put on a movie for the kids?”
“I don’t know. Something about bleeding and they need him to get his strength up before they can operate so he needs to not be around anything stressful,” Sam says.
Dean wakes up around noon to a text from Cas telling him to meet him for lunch at his office at 12:30 with directions on where to go. He jumps out of bed to take a quick shower and get dressed and then he’s out the door.
“Hanger box over there,” Benny grins and points to a tall moving box with a built-in metal bar that a portion of his clothes are hanging from.
Dean’s eyes are closed and he’s moaning Cas’ name along with other obscenities. Cas relaxes completely, satisfied that Dean is no longer uncomfortable, in a bad way, at least.
They’re halfway through the movie when they pause again to clean up their dinner. Dean says they can wait until the movie's over, but Cas insists because he doesn't want the pizza to go bad. Dean rolls his eyes, but he obeys. Cas puts the leftover pizza in the fridge while Dean washes the dishes. He grabs the dish rag hanging on the oven handle. He’s drying his hands as he’s whipped around and pressed up against the counter, his lips met by Castiel’s.
“Yeah, I mean I figured. Obviously, anyone can get infected, but, you know, it’s always been more prominent in the LGBT community,” Dean says. “I get tested regularly and, uh, I’m clean, just so you know. And, you know, I’m sure you are too. I just, uh, you know, I wanna be safe.”
The man rolls over and rubs at his eyes. Once he realizes there’s a third man in the room, he stiffens and sits up to cover himself with the comforter.
“Actually, that’s why I’m here,” Dean starts, “well, part of why. I also wanted to see your gorgeous face.” He winks at her and she playfully rolls her eyes.
“Hey, hey, none of that. You’re tougher than you think, Dean. Look, I’ve known you for a long time, right? I’ve known you through countless relationships. You’ve made it to the other side when each of those ended, right?”
“I don’t even know what to say right now. This means more to me than either of you will ever know,” Cas says, his eyes red and puffy from the tears.
“So, Dean, what are you feeling right now? First time performing at the Grammys, that’s gotta come with a lot of pressure,” a pretty, red-headed reporter asks him as she holds a mic up to his face.
“He sounded off on the phone. I don’t know, Red, it just didn’t sound like he wants to meet for a coffee date. I feel like I did when Cassie texted me asking me to meet her for lunch and she ended up breaking up with me
“You sounded good,” Cas says, “I went on their Facebook to hear the song they were talking about you performing at the sushi bar. Am I wrong to assume it was about me?”
Once the sun has illuminated their front lawn, Dean heads back inside and puts on a pot of coffee. Cas walks out of their shared bedroom moments later.
Cas’ mouth waters, outside it smells even better. And, to Cas’ surprise, there’s a table set with glassware and candles.
“Yes, I saw you lean over,” Cas continues, “but I didn’t just ignore you for the sake of ignoring you, Dean.”
Dean throws on is favorite boots and heads out the door. He gets to Cas’ building just before 5 and Cas buzzes him up.
Dean obliges and Cas flips through the channels, landing on Dr. Sexy. He sets the remote down and eats a spoonful of ice cream.
Cas still looks concerned. He obviously doesn’t believe Dean, but he can read the expression on Dean’s face that’s begging him to drop it, so he does.
“You don’t have anything to apologize for,” Cas says, still sounding a little hurt that Dean won’t tell him the truth.
“Not to worry, Dean. I get it,” Bart starts before Naomi walks into the room and announces that dinner is ready.
The whole bar cheers as Dean takes a breath between the chorus and the next verse. He’s surprised the song is receiving this kind of reaction considering he wrote it in a day. This song isn’t on the album. In fact, Dean hasn’t sung this in front of anyone before, not even Bobby or his band. But they’re loving it, so he jumps into the bridge full force,
Cas kisses him back and they stand there for a moment, taking each other in without coming up for air. It’s right about now that Dean’s remembering the painful bruise on his jaw. Cas tastes so damn good, though, so he can’t be bothered to care about the pain.
“It’s my mother’s recipe. She always cooked dinner for my family. This was her infamous spaghetti and meatballs recipe that she made every Monday night. I thought it was only right to make it for us, since, you know, it’s Monday and all,” Cas says, looking up at Dean hoping he doesn’t sound like a total sap.
Cas notices the slight shift in Dean’s demeanor. He looks up at him and smiles, then he wraps his arm around Dean’s waist and squeezes, letting Dean know that he’s okay with this.
“I knew I wasn’t ready for this, I knew. I never should’ve tried to push myself into being okay with it before I was ready,” he says.
He kisses Cas again and then starts stroking Cas to the same rhythm until they’re both digging their nails into each other’s shoulders to steady themselves as they come.
“You wanna watch a movie together downstairs or something? I bet the cinema channels have a lot of the newer movies on there that we can rent,” Sam tries.
On his way home, though, Dean passes Charlie’s. He decides to make a quick U-turn to stop in and see her first.
“She said she had to process it, which is why she didn’t reach out when she first saw the news. But then she said she just wants me to be happy, she doesn’t care who it’s with,” Cas says, smiling at Dean who’s smiling right back.
Instead, he wraps his hands around Lee’s face to pull him in for another kiss, only this time, he’s walking him back up against the wall.
“I can’t say for certain right now. After surgery, I’ll know more. Excuse me,” he says, turning to leave.
Shit, Christmas. Dean forgot the holiday is coming up next week. Does he get Cas something? They haven’t really been seeing each other all that long. But what if Cas gets him something and he doesn’t have anything in return?
“Gone,” he manages to choke out. He takes a deep breath, the first one he’s taken since the empty took Cas. “He’s gone.”
Dean leaves the coffee shop and heads straight to the liquor store. He can’t show up to Cas’ dinner invitation empty handed. He walks in and browses for a moment before seeking out the help of one of the store’s employees. Dean’s got a taste for whiskey and finding the best brand in this store would be a piece of cake for him. But he’s not about to show up to Cas’ with a bottle of Jack. He needs something more romantic, so he opts for wine. Problem is, he doesn’t know the difference between sweet wine, dry wine, or anything in between. How can wine, a liquid, be dry anyway? It makes no damn sense. Luckily, one of the employees knows her stuff and finds him a nice bottle of Bordeaux. He buys it and then he’s off to his next stop, Bobby’s.
He walks out of the bathroom and glances at the clock. It’s a quarter after 3 so he should probably get ready. He does the same song and dance as last night, trying on different shirts and pants before settling on a pair of dark wash jeans and a gray Henley.
The world begins to fade away as he transitions into the second song. They decided on just two due to time restrictions, but Dean is putting his heart and soul into this performance regardless of how long it lasts.
Castiel just smiles at him. He never needed Dean to say it back because just loving Dean was enough. But hearing those words come from Dean’s lips, the vulnerability in his shaky voice, he feels whole.
He bobs his head a few more times, allowing Cas to ride out his orgasm before sliding his mouth off Cas’ dick with a pop.
He pours the coffee out into the sink and rinses the cup out. He quickly gets dressed in the clothes he had on yesterday and heads home.
“Please don’t touch me,” Cas says, punching the code to his building into the keypad. “I can’t do this right now.”
“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding,” Dean recites as Castiel looks up at him. His cheeks turn hot, “Or, something like that.”
“That was good ‘ole throwback to 2004 with Live Like You Were Dying. Now, I hope y’all are as excited as I am for tomorrow morning. Tune into the morning show with Storme Warren if you want to hear a live interview with Dean Winchester on the news of his new album! Dean will be discussing some of the tracks and their inspiration, and we might even get a little sneak peek! So, if you’re as fired up for this new album hitting stores January 9th as we are, then you don’t want to miss this interview!”
Cas smiles and they both head back into the hotel room. Dean is sound asleep on one bed and Jess is sitting up reading in the other.
“Thanks. She was my dad’s before she got handed down to me,” Dean says, proudly. “So, where ya wanna go for lunch?”
Once the steaks are done, Cas helps Dean bring the rest of the food outside and they sit down to eat.
“What the hell happened last night after you left the strip club?” Benny asks him, a look of concern spreading across his face.
He heads into his kitchen and pulls a beer out of the fridge. Before opening it, he checks the oven clock. 2:30. Eh, late enough in the day. He pops the cap off and tosses it onto the counter.
“What the fuck,” Dean grumbles, rolling over and bumping into the body lying next to him. “What the fuck?” He rubs his eyes and sits up a bit to get a better look at the man sharing his bed. “Oh fuck.”
Ellen Harvelle is the owner of the bar. Dean has known Ellen and her daughter, Jo, since he was 13. He used to sneak over to their house with his little brother, Sammy, when their dad would come home soaked in alcohol and rage and start throwing shit. It was best to not be around John Winchester when he was drunk off his ass.
“Right, so I just didn’t want to get into all that shit. But, it’s not fair for me to lie to you,” Dean’s quiet again. Cas doesn’t say anything either, he waits for Dean to continue.
“Nice. I’m from Lawrence. Moved here almost 15 years ago with my dad and brother, then I started my music career. What brought you all the way out here?”
Dean tangles his fingers in Cas’ hair, kissing him so deeply, you would guess he’d been planning it for years.
Dean decides to show him just how sure he is. He rips open a condom wrapper with his teeth and rolls it onto his growing erection. He pops open the bottle of lube and squeezes it out onto his fingers.
He watches out the window as Cas drives away, trying to replay the events of the night in his head to figure out what’s bothering Cas, but aside from not spending more time with him, he can’t think of anything.
“I’m not a big wine drinker, so, uh, I wasn’t really sure what to get. Lady at the liquor store said this would be good with almost anything,” Dean says, hoping he didn’t screw up the drink of the evening.
with him. Castiel. He remembers his name was Castiel, and he had the most beautiful blue eyes Dean has ever seen. The rest of the night comes back to him in flashes and he remembers he left his number on Castiel’s counter. He immediately rolls over to check his phone, which brings the nausea rushing back, causing him to jump up and bolt to the bathroom.
“You tell me, Cas!” Dean yells, throwing his hands up in the air. “You wouldn’t even talk to me afterwards. You wiped your hands clean of me, just like that. And Crowley told me he saw you with some chick at the Roadhouse a few nights back, so it seems pretty clear to me that you have.”
“You heard the boy, no one will be commenting at this time,” Bobby says, shutting the door after Dean.
“No,” Cas laughs, “that would be a lot of Novaks in my tiny apartment. Several of my siblings have families, so it’s just better that they stay in Kansas.”
Dean pulls into his driveway around 11:30 pm. After sitting at the hospital all day long, they finally got some answers. John was taken into surgery and now he’s in recovery. All things considered, he’s gonna be fine. Dean had finally convinced Sam that there was nothing they could do for John right now so they might as well go home and get some sleep. He dropped Sam off at his apartment and then headed straight home.
“Yeah, well, sort of,” Dean hesitates. He doesn’t really want to delve into family issues on their first official date. “My manager, Bobby, was transferred out here about fifteen years ago and he brought me, my brother, and my dad with him. Bobby’s kind of like my uncle, he’s the one who saw my 'potential'," Dean says, using air quotes around the word 'potential'.
Dean gets on top of him and starts throwing punch after punch, yelling things at John and cursing every other word out of his mouth.
“Just a round of whatever’s on tap, El. And I’ll take a bacon burger.” Dean cut in. Ellen may be small, but she’s a force to be reckoned with and he’s gotta protect his drummer from getting his ass handed to him.
“So, Dean, we got word that you performed a new song last night at Sushi Sal’s. A couple of fans posted videos on our Facebook page. Now, there haven’t been any stories in the media about your relationship. So, Dean, I mean I gotta ask, who was the special someone that inspired that song?” Storme asks, throwing Dean for a loop. How the hell is he supposed to answer this?
They get to watch the show for about an hour before they have to head backstage. Bobby goes back with them briefly, just to “supervise”. Dean thinks it’s really just to make sure he doesn’t panic and run out the back door or something.
“Criminal law. I was transferred from my position as the DA in Smith county in Lebanon to Nashville. Right now, I’m an ADA, but I’m working my way back up to DA for Davidson county.”
“It’s okay, Dean. I understand wanting to kiss someone you’re attracted to in public. And believe me, I wanted to, I just-I’m just not ready.”
Several years ago, after spending so much time with Sam and Eileen’s boys, Dean and Cas decided that they wanted kids of their own. But, with Dean being legally dead and Cas not existing on paper, they couldn’t conventionally adopt. Fate seemed to be on their side, though, when Claire and Kaia showed up to Christmas in 2023 with a newborn. Dean jumped into defensive dad mode immediately and interrogated the girls, asking if they were sure they were ready for this and how they planned to continue hunting if they were taking care of a baby. Kaia tried to cut in and explain, but Claire grabbed her arm and shot her a look that said, ‘let him finish’. To this day, she still loves to rile him up.
“Mr. Winchester is in room 102 on the fourth floor. Here, you’ll need this visitor badge,” she says as she hands him a sticker with his name on it and the word ‘visitor’ written in big blue letters.
Dean leans back and just sits there, stunned. What the fuck just happened? Why wouldn’t Cas let Dean kiss him goodbye?
Bobby has such a way with words sometimes, Dean rolls his eyes and walks over to the door of the sound booth. He stands there for a moment before opening the door.
? I mean, you met the guy once and wrote a song about him. We were together for almost, what? Two years? And I didn’t even get
Cas moves his fingers around, stretching him open just enough so he can fit himself inside Dean, but still cause him a little bit of pleasurable pain.
“Case notes,” Dean scoffs, “sure. Whatever, Cas. Look, this really hasn’t been all that easy for me, so if you don’t mind,” Dean points to the door, “I’m sure you can see yourself out.”
“Awesome,” Dean laughs, “My little brother Sammy’s a lawyer. Pretty damn good one, too. Best in Nashville if I do say so myself.”
Dean pulls up to Charlie’s 10 minutes early. When he walks inside, he heads straight to a table in the back occupied by a petite red head hunched over a laptop. Dean comes up from behind and covers her eyes,
As soon as they get back up to the room, Cas slams Dean against the hotel door, connecting their lips. Dean reaches up and grabs a handful of Cas’ hair, dragging low moans out of Cas’ throat.
Dean can’t look at Cas. He’s trying so hard not to break down right now that he just stares at his untouched food.
“Mr. Novak, as per your request, this email contains your test results. We tested over blah, blah, blah, your HIV test came back negative. If you have any questions please call us at…,” Dean trails off. He smiles as a wave of relief washes over him.
Dean stares at him for a moment before saying anything. He always knew Sammy was more of the settle down type, so it should be no surprise that he wants to marry Jess. He just didn’t expect it to be this soon.
Cas feels heat rising on the back of his neck at the site of Benny kissing Dean, even if it was just on the cheek.
Benny takes his hand off Dean’s shoulder and heads back into the room. He plugs Dean’s phone into the charger and walks towards the door.
Dean allows himself to sleep in today. Soon he won’t be able to for a while, so he takes full advantage of this time he has to relax. The only thing missing is Cas.
“Oh, stop it, Cas. You did most of the work, I was pretty much just a glorified assistant,” Sam retorts.
“Already done,” Bobby cuts him off. “You’re in no position to be performing right now. I don’t care if the album sales go down the crapper, your health and overall well-being comes first.”
Dean turns the water off and dries his hands, getting blood all over the towel. He pops the top off of his beer and takes a long swig of it.
“Dean, where the hell have you been? Why haven’t you been answering your phone? Didn’t you get my texts?” Sam starts in.
He groans as he rolls over to turn his phone back on. The notifications start rolling in and he immediately searches for Cas’ name.
“I know it ain’t been easy, brother,” Benny starts, speaking softly, “you can’t let yourself spiral downhill, though. You got a lot of people counting on you, Sam, myself, the guys, and Bobby included.”
Castiel leans in and kisses Dean. And then he kisses him again and again and once again they’re pressed up against one of Castiel’s doors making out. Seems like this is their thing now.
“I know you are. I'm sorry,” he says as he kisses Cas’ forehead. “C’mon, you wanna go out and explore?”
Bobby doesn’t say anything. He just searches Dean’s face for who knows what. When he doesn’t find it, he relaxes.
Dean works on his jaw until he’s convinced the bruise was never even there. Damn, who knew he was so good at applying and blending makeup.
Dean sits back in the booth. Yeah, okay, maybe he didn’t want to delve into his sex life in front of Colette and maybe he’s not sure what he and Cas are right now, but he sure as hell doesn’t see Cas as a friend.
Trigger Warning// Conversation about HIV. The conversation is brief, it's right after Dean and Cas get home from the diner. It's not bad, it's just an uncomfortable topic so if anyone would like to avoid it altogether, you have been warned lol.
“What happened? I don’t know how I got-,” Cas is interrupted by the crash of Dean’s lips against his.
The giant curtain opens up and all Dean sees is lights. He’s used to that. He can sort of see the first few rows of people, mostly made up of fans because they’re not on the center stage. He relaxes a little. He’s got this.
“No, no, no, no, I don’t sing. But, uh, Dean, you should get up there! Sing us something off your album!” Sam replies, knowing damn well he’s putting Dean on the spot.
“Yeah?” Dean answers, realizing he and Cas left a trail of clothes from the door to their bed. His face grows hot and he runs his hand over the back of his neck before he starts picking up each article of clothing. “Oh, sorry about that.”
“Holy fuck!” Dean moans loudly before coming all over his stomach and Cas’ hand. Cas has a huge grin on his face as he finishes himself off and pulls out.
It’s a bittersweet victory. As much as Dean would rather top, he was kind of digging the idea of letting Castiel take control. Oh well, this means there has to be a next time since Cas so desperately wants to top, too.
“Yeah! Or, or maybe he didn’t notice you leaning over to kiss him. Maybe he was just getting out of the car,” Charlie suggests.
Right after dessert is brought out, Cas stands up and clears his throat to get everyone’s attention. They all fall silent while Cas briefly scans the table, landing his eyes on Dean.
He doesn’t really care what Jess thinks on this particular subject, though. She has no idea the hell John put Dean through, so let her go on thinking Dean’s the shitty son. Hell, John already thinks that, might as well live up to it.
“He, uh,” he struggles with his words. “He’s not a happy drunk. He used to throw me around a lot. Not Sam though, I-I wouldn’t let him touch Sam.”
Dean attempts to hold it long enough to let Cas come first. He acknowledges him by squeezing his thigh. He sucks down to the base and swallows one more time before the back of his throat is hit with the warm release as he follows right after.
“Yeah, okay. I get that,” Cas says as he repositions himself to sit next to Dean instead of straddled on top of him.
Cas has tears running down his face. So does Dean. Bart and Naomi get up from the table and wrap both boys in a hug. Dean struggles to keep himself from completely breaking down in front of them. Obviously Bobby accepts him for who he is, and as the only real parental figure in his life, that means more to him than anything. But Bobby isn’t like this. He didn’t react this way. It was more of a pat on the back and a “you like what you like, don’t matter to me”. All of this is so foreign to Dean, but it’s also so comforting. Even though the Novaks are not his parents, he’s never going to forget this feeling of family and acceptance that he’s feeling right now.
Dean flops onto one of the beds the second they walk in the room. They’re sharing with Sam and Jess. Benny and Andrea are sharing with Crowley, and Ash and his wife, Lydia are sharing with Bobby and Jody.
“Nope, but I did expect it to buy us a little time,” Dean says. He looks over Chuck’s shoulder at Michael and Jack, hands joined together, the both of them glowing white, hot light.
“Nananana, okay, yeah, nope, mm-mm. Don’t have to dive into that one tonight,” Dean cuts Sam off, tossing a playful glare his way.
Dean watches as Cas’ eyes shoot open, his pupils blown wide with pure ecstasy. Cas moans loud and tenses up as a white ribbon spreads across his stomach. Dean finishes him off, and then proceeds to slam into Castiel a few more times before he comes as well.
“Yeah, uh, it’s a lot to take in. It’s definitely a lot of pressure too, but, uh, you know, we’ve been rehearsing for a while, so I think we’ve got it down pat. I’m not worried,” he lies.
“It’s not a big deal, Sammy. We made out a little and he passed out on his bed. Not like I professed my undying love for him and he turned me down. Let it go,” Dean tries, even though he knows Sam is absolutely
It quickly dawns on Dean that this may be more affection than Cas is willing to display, so he moves his arm from Cas’ waist and brings it up to brush the back of his neck.
The rest of the lunch goes just about as well as the beginning of it. Sam talks about work and about Jess and Dean continues to nod silently, never looking up from the table in front of him. Sam occasionally asks Dean a question, to which Dean typically responds with a one-shouldered shrug.
“Alright, you two. Enough flirting. I need a beer,” Dean says as Sam shoots him a look. He smiles proudly, succeeding in already annoying Sam within the first five minutes of his arrival.
“You’re insane, Baby is a classic. She’s perfect just the way she is. Besides, a car should drive, Sam, it doesn’t need all of this extra bullshit,” Dean argues.
They get back to their room around 11:30. Dean stumbles in with his arm around Cas for balance with Sam and Jess following closely behind.
Sam pulls John up off the ground next. Smug son of a bitch is laughing. Dean’s heating up again but before anything else can happen, Sam is dragging John out the door.
“Alright, boys, listen up,” Bobby starts. Once he gets everyone’s undivided attention, he continues, “shows are Tuesday and Thursday. Now I don’t give a shit what else y’all do while we’re here ‘long as you’re on time for rehearsals and show times and no one gets arrested.”
Lee cocks his head to the side and looks at him with a confused expression. Dean swallows hard and closes his eyes for a moment because the look reminds him of Cas.
He drags himself out of bed, though, and gets his day going. First stop is The Morning Show on Nash FM with Ty, Kelly, and Chuck. This interview went just about as you’d expect. Questions about the album, more questions about the mystery person in Dean’s life, basically a recap of the previous morning’s interview.
“I’ve always wondered where I went wrong with you,” John says. “Never did grow a pair. Never learned how to be a real man. It’s no wonder you turned out to be a fag.”
“I, uh,” he sighs and gives in, “I wanted to know if Jody made any of her famous apple pies today. Got a date tonight and I wanna bring one,” Dean admits.
Cas is looking at Dean with so much concern and pity on his face, Dean thinks there might even be a hint of guilt in there for pressing him about the bruise.
“Well, that’s why I said, ‘Eileen and I’. I’ll really just be there for moral support. I’ll be her cooking wing man,” Cas says.
“Alright, we ready to get rid of this cosmic douchebag for good?” He claps, walking over to the freshly made pot of coffee on the counter. He pauses for a moment, remembering all the times Cas would sit with him in the mornings while he drank his coffee. Even if Dean was acting like a grumpy asshole, Cas never seemed to mind.
“Watch me,” Dean retorts, tossing his straw onto the table and finishing his glass of water in one, long gulp.
“Hey, Dean, what’s going on, is everything okay?” Cas asks as he walks into the dressing room. Dean doesn’t answer, he immediately grabs his arm and drags him into the nearest bathroom.
He puts Cas down on the bed and grabs at the neckline of his shirt, pulling it over his head. He begins to unbuckle his pants, but Cas moves his hands out of the way and does it for him. Their lips meet again, and Dean manages to wiggle out of his jeans without actually touching them.
Once both men are cleaned up and dressed, they head downstairs. Dean says goodbye to Lee and tells him he hopes to see him around, but they both know the chances of that are pretty slim.
Dean rolls his eyes and shakes his head. The snark would normally turn him on a little if he wasn’t so irritated with the topic at hand.
“Woah, wait, hang on,” Dean says, catching Castiel’s arm as he turns to leave, “Can ya ‘least lemme walk ya to your car?”
Dean drags his finger in and out of Cas, loosening him up, then he adds his middle finger. Cas tenses up again, but Dean presses their mouths together and enters his mouth with his tongue, and Cas relaxes.
Cas doesn’t answer. Dean knows something is still wrong, but he doesn’t want to fight with him this early in the day. Well, this early in his day, at least.
He gets out of the impala and heads straight for the door, completely forgetting about the bags of alcohol in the passenger seat. He glances at the car on his way in and Cas isn’t inside. He knew he wouldn’t be. He still has his key because there wasn’t really a lot of time to exchange the ex-boxes the day Cas ended things.
“So, at my meeting with Bobby this morning,” he begins, “we went over the usual stuff, you know? Like what the next 8 months are gonna look like before the tour starts and, uh,” Dean hesitates.
The phone rings twice before Dean hangs it up and throws it across the room. He puts his hands over his face and yells.
Dean gives in and allows his lips to part to let Castiel’s tongue enter his mouth. Dean laces his tongue around Castiel’s as he moves one hand down to hold onto Castiel’s waist and the other up to grip his hair. Castiel moans at the slight tug of his hair as Dean breaks free from his mouth and starts pressing wet kisses down Castiel’s neck.
“Let’s just go back out there, finish the show and then we’ll go out and have a good time and help you forget all about him. Sound good?” Benny says as he takes the beer out of Dean’s hand.
“I don’t know but we’re gonna figure it out because that’s what you do when you love someone. You don’t just give up on them,” Dean says.
“Lemme see. My dad taught me this trick for when you burn bread. If you scrape away the black, the bread underneath will be good as new,” Dean says as he gets up and walks around the island to stand next to Cas.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Dean asks him, anger beginning to set in. How dare Cas let himself into Dean’s home after what happened.
