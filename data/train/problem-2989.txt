“It was beautiful,” Eileen ads, and Dean feels a little bit bad about not noticing her appear next to Sam. He leans back against the car and looks around, surveying the notably Yeti-less space.
Finally, Dean gets out of the car, and Sam follows. Behind them, Claire and Kaia—who followed them back because they still have the cabin for two days, and Dean decided they also deserve a break—pull into the driveway.
More specifically, there’s something trudging around a ski resort in Aspen, Colorado. It’s not doing much besides scaring innocent skiers, but it’s
“Tempting, but I’ll pass.” He’s pushing himself out of his chair and reaching to take his laptop back from Sam when Cas walks into the library, arms filled with the next set of old books to categorize, and when he smiles at Dean it’s so fond that he doesn’t have the heart to be irritated about losing another day with him to their archiving project.
“Are you sure?” she questioned. “Nothing about you, and—” the last part came out a squeak. “and men?”
Sam doesn’t share the sentiment, though, which becomes obvious when Dean slides into the seat across from him in the library. “A kid fell down the slope and broke an arm, Dean. That’s not a case.” He waves his hand at Dean’s laptop screen, where the article is pulled up.
Dean tries again. “Would a bear sneak in the open back door of a cabin and raid the fridge while everyone is asleep?”
Eileen pauses to greet Jack too but Dean continues on into the small cabin, where Sam and Cas are crouched by the fireplace trying to start a fire. “I remember when humans discovered fire. You’ve come so far since then,” Cas muses, flicking the wand lighter off and on, and Sam nearly drops the wood he’s trying to stack.
The last word sounded more defeated than angry, so Dean forced himself to look up. He swallowed and nodded, not wanting to apologize a third time, and they held tense eye contact for a long second before Castiel sighed, rubbed a hand across his face, and took a step forward. “I’m sorry,” he said, softly, placing both hands on Dean’s shoulders. Dean felt even
“It’s alright. I understand the confusion. Although,” Cas tilted his head, frowning a bit. “Dean. You do know I’m
Amelia briefly panics and makes some big assumptions about Jimmy's sexuality bUT there is no homophobia or hate here, just (as it turns out, unfounded) worry about what it would mean for their relationship
“Showtime,” he mumbled, not bothering to look at Charlie as he stood. He didn’t need her disapproval messing up his game.
and Dean will take anything, at this point. The peace and quiet was nice, for a while—Chuck gone, Jack smoothing things over upstairs, Cas back—but if Dean is cooped up for one more day, he’s going to lose his mind.
Dean took seriously, it was Kurt Vonnegut, so he forced his eyes closed, turned his phone off, and shoved it deep into his backpack. He had plans to meet Castiel after class, anyway, and would confront him about it then. If he argued just a little more aggressively in class than usual…well, he could use the participation points.
Cas sighed heavily, removed his lips from where they had been working their way down Dean’s neck, and dropped his forehead to his shoulder.
“I don’t know, Sam,” he snaps, and it comes out more frustrated than he intended. “Probably before I almost
It’s nearly 4am when they get back, and all Dean wants to do is crawl into bed, but the caged Yeti in the backseat (and the other one in the cabin) demand more immediate attention. As it is Cas is already appearing at the car as soon as Dean turns off the ignition—without even saying hello he yanks open the car door and then the cage, and attempts to coax the creature out in the same soothing tone he’d used for the first one. It doesn’t work, though—the scared Yeti curls into the back of its cage, teeth bared, not moving.
“Want him?” Dean asked almost breathlessly, words coming out more exhausted then he’d expected- almost empty. “Why the hell wouldn’t I want him.”
Jack gave her a glare but followed her as they walked across the parking lot and onto the sidewalk. They walked shoulder to shoulder, a silence hanging around them as they made their way down the familiar neighborhood, past the houses Claire had long ago memorized and to Chuck’s.
"Sam." Dean cried as he ran around the outside of the school, finding his brother at a small basketball hoop with a few other kids.
A moment of silence passed as Billie stared at Dean, and he stared back. He could feel the discomfort of his chest, everything telling him to get up and leave.
“I talked with Crowley,” Sonny hummed as he blew out a cloud of smoke. Dean didn’t move, instead staying frozen a few feet away, a safe few feet away. “He agreed not to press charges if you’ll spend a few weeks helping him out after school.”
He forced himself to take another breath as he herd movement behind the door, and then with his heart leaping to his throat, the door was pulled open.
He was beautiful. Not in the way Dean would describe a woman, with delicate features, and elegant movements. No he was beautiful like the sun flaring across your cheeks on a summer day. Radiating a comfortable, perfect warmth. An endless calm, that made everything seem okay, an addictive feeling that seemed to leave Dean always wanting to be closer. He was not beautiful, his actions, his words, the emotions he brought to Dean were beautiful.
This was what she’d always wanted, and maybe she didn’t have it at first but like hell she was going to let it go.
“I think you should give him a chance,” Jack replied softly, a comment Claire decided to ignore and instead look back to her feet, letting the silence once again fall between them. It thankfully stayed that way for the rest of the walk, until they reached Chuck’s house and made their way up the back porch.
For a moment the room sat in silence, only broken by Cas’s occasional gasp, and Dean’s own low breaths, his one hand resting against Cas’s lower back, while the other rested between his shoulder blades.
Without a word Claire stood her legs shaking as she moved forward. Mind numb. Her mouth still dry. Her heart beating heavy in her chest. She couldn’t bring herself to speak or even begin to process everything that had been said and instead she sat next to Dean and pulled him into a tight hug.
Sam sighed, “tell you what?” He took a seat at the kitchen table, Dean following suit. Sam looked exhausted, his hair no longer long but messy, his beard growing in a similar mess. It was a problem, though one that Dean would have to focus on at another time, at that moment he had more important problems to solve.
He stood from his seat, taking another long drink from his beer before moving out the door. The burning of the alcohol felt good against his throat, it gave him a distraction, brought some ease to the adrenaline that continued to course through him. Still the taste of coffee overpowered the beer. How many bottles would it take for the coffee to disappear, two, three, would he need something stronger.
Dean clenched his jaw, a deep breath filling his lungs as they pulled up to his house. He pushed the passenger door open, determined not to give Crowley another glance, until the other man cleared his throat, getting Dean’s attention.
He’d been trying to be perfect for so long. Perfect grades. Perfect athlete. Perfect future. Perfect girlfriend. Perfect life. Perfect son. But now perfect seemed to crumble upon him, just out of grasp, staying that way no matter how hard he ran towards it. No matter how much effort he put in, no matter how much he sacrificed.
“Do you,” Dean began, his voice seeming far too loud in the silent parking lot. The young boy looked upw with his wide eyes, the exact same look Sam and held as a child. “Do you like playing?”
This is going to be the last update for a bit, with lack of sleep, school, everything that's going on in the world, and more, my mental health has been spiralling and I honestly can't really imagine updating this book daily! So at the moment I'm going to be taking a break for the rest of this week and most likely the week to come!
And that was proven as Cas gave a small nod of approval before he stepped around Dean, for once Cas’s eyes not meeting his own. “I’ll see ya tomorrow,” Dean said, his own gaze staying forward, locked on where Cas had once stood, and instead listening to the other walk away, the snow crunching under his boots.
Slowly he got out two bowls, filling each with cereal and cheese, before he put them in the microwave. A minute later he pulled out the soggy mess of cheese, and cereal, and placed one bowl in front of Sam, keeping the other for himself.
Once he was fully dressed, he silently crept out of the bedroom, leaving the door open, in fear of waking the women, and through the rest of the apartment. His breathing didn’t become normal until the front door had been closed, and he had crumbled against the hall walls, his eyes squeezed closed. “Fuck,” Dean mumbled.
"I'm," Dean choked out, his vision becoming foggy with tears, Why couldn't he just fucking say. "Sammy," Dean begged
When he began pushing the tree branches to the side, Ellie let out a loud screech. “No!” She sobbed, pushing herself further away from Dean and closer to the wall, her silent crying becoming loud sobs. “No!”
He took a step around Eileen, beginning to walk to the gym’s exit, though after only a few steps, he stopped. “Sammy,” Dean called, his brother looking to him with his wide puppy dog eyes. “We’ll find her.”
Dean looked over to Cas as they walked, a smile across his face, “You’re such a fuckin’ dork, we need t’find you some music.”
Dean sighed, he dragged his hands down his face. His brother was right, no matter how much Dean wished he wasn’t. “I know, I'm just.” Dean let out a shaken breath, “what if i'm not enough? His family already hates me, I'm broke, on the verge of being homeless every second week.”
Castiel tilted his head to the side, shaking it slightly. His blue eyes were wide, looking up at Dean in curiosity, “I could- uh, I could teach you sometime, tomorrow if you’re free.”
When the sound of running water stopped Cas sat up, grabbing one of his blankets that had fallen to the ground, and covering himself just as Dean stepped out of the bathroom.
“Well I’m not bi either,” Dean spat, looking back to the ground. Though the words were for Sam, he wasn’t sure who was trying to convince his brother, or himself.
“But I’m not,” she snapped, turning towards him. “You chose him, after everything that fucking happened, after everything that he fucking did, you still chose him,” the bubble of emotion burst through her chest as her words became more frantic, fists clenched at her sides. “Why aren’t you angry at him?”
It had been four days since they’d arrived in LA. The first three Dean spent in the studio, finally on his first day off he decided it was time to make Jack an actual bedroom.
“Uh yah- totally get it- work- rough mornings-” Dean lent to the right to see over the man's shoulder, though he could only get a glance of their living room before Logan closed the door enough that only he could be seen. “is Cas here?”
When Dean realized there was nothing else for him to say, he lent forward pulling his brother to a hug. His grip only tightened as Sam broke into sobs.
“Are you guys ready to go?” Dean asked when he’d once again met the cashier's gaze. He turned to his classmates? Acquaintances? He wasn't sure, though only Cas had looked back, Meg instead digging through her backpack.
Cas sat up, head tilted the slightest bit, his confused expression clear even though the darkness. “Dean, I don’t understand your analogy.”
It wasn’t until Jack had ran out of the room that Dean stood, stomach taking a dramatic drop at the sudden movement. His eyes immediately squeezed shut, a hand raised to his mouth where it stayed for a moment. Then another. Then another.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut for a second, a shaken breath filling his lungs. “Is it because of dad?” Sam whispered, voice so low, so broken, Dean almost hadn’t heard. “Like Meg said.”
“I think,” Dean began, the exhaustion clear in his voice even to himself. “I wouldn’t have to rely on drugs if I was dead.”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel replied, purposely speaking harsher than before. “Did you not spill soup all over yourself last night?”
Another choked breath came from Dean, as he only shook his head, tears continuing to roll down his face. “He- he found us-“ another heart shattering gasp. “Sam.”
He used the old t-shirt to wipe the throw up from his face, before throwing it into the corner of his room. He then pulled on the new t-shirt, his gaze continuing to stay firmly forward as he pulled off his jeans, and pulled on the sweat pants, his fingers hesitation at his waist.
“Okay,” Sam said to himself as he placed the ingredients onto the counter top, a large bag of flour, baking soda, apples, sugar, and anything else he could remember the recipe recommended. “Where should I start.”
The whole room seemed to buzz as Dean sat there. The lights blaring, the distant hum of traffic seeming to scream against the wall, it was the same energy as the club. An endless chaos, that blurred Dean's thoughts, not letting him sleep, no matter how much he wanted to simply pass out.
The moment his hand touched the others shoulders Cas froze, slowly turning around to meet Deans gaze. “Sorry for scaring you,” Dean began. He let out a breath as he stepped the slightest bit closer to the other, letting his hand linger on Cas’s shoulder, before he brought it back to his side, “I just- you don’t have to go.”
The man raised an eyebrow, as he looked Dean up and down, Dean’s own gaze dropping down his body, to the old t-shirt and faded jeans he wore. “I don’t know your boyfriend, but I have reasons to believe price isn’t his biggest concern,” he paused, finally stopping his judging look and giving Dean a forced smile. “And that you should be putting your money in other aspects of your life.”
He had considered cutting it away, once, twice, the thought was always at the back of his mind. Grab one of their many knives and slowly carve out his own skin, cut himself thigh gaps, force a thin waist. Sam was the only thing keeping him from trying.
Dean shook his head, but rather than arguing, climbed the few steps down the ladder, the snow crunching under his boots as he reached the ground. “How about you climb up, show me how to do it, and if I’m right and you don’t know how to,” Dean gave a small shrug, “I’ll show you, free of charge.”
Cas should probably shower, though he couldn’t find the strength, or the want to move. Instead he stayed laying, listening to the muffled sound of running water, and Dean’s humming, that at times would become low singing.
“Now I’m ready,” Cas whispered as he stepped back linking his own arm with Dean’s, resting his hand against the other’s bicep.
Even with his clothing in hand he didn’t start getting dressed, and instead took a seat on his bed. His eyes on his lap, stuck on the dark hickey that bruised his inner thigh.
Dean opened the small velvet box raising it as he did so. He kept it raised for another second before closing the box, letting his arms fall back to his side, “what did you think? Would you have said yes?” Dean asked the man behind the counter who looked back with what Dean could only describe as utter exhaustion. “Maybe I should try again with the silver one, you know with the huge fucking diamond.”
Dean lips parted only to close seconds later, then open once again, the words never seeming to come. He could only focus on the hammering of his heart, and Cas. Cas proposing.
Cas’s gaze dropped from the door and to the blue jacket he wore. It was slim fitting, made from the same material as Dean’s, with a gold pallet across his chest, and along his shoulders, the same shade as the belt around his waist. The red sash that traveled from his left shoulder to his right hip bone stood out, seeming to stare back at him. Mock him.
"I told you, I want to repay Castiel for watching the kids yesterday." Sam has asked where Dean was that morning, over and over, though Dean had only shook his head, repeating a lie that even he couldn't believe. Despite that Sam eventually gave up, instead letting Dean stick to his awful lie. "he'd done that enough last month, and it was unfair to him how last minute it was." Sam pulled out some glasses, before he shut the cabinet, "now would you please open the door for them," Sam paused as Dean moved to the door, hand on the knob, "and be nice!"
"I can tell." Dean pushed himself off the wall, instead standing so all his weight lent on his right leg. He watched the women in interest as she shifted through her mail throwing each one into the garbage can after she had pulled off the stamp. Which she would then tuck into the pocket of her oversized purple dress. "It's going to be much longer if you keep waiting for the elevator."
It took both kids half an hour to get dressed, followed by another fifteen minutes to get down to the parking lot and an hour for him and Ellie to agree on a small diner. By the time they'd sat down and received their menus the clock had struck 11:00 and Dean had become starving.
Dean shouldn’t have been driving, and with each wrong turn, ran stop sign, and poor lane change that became increasingly clear. His breathing had once again become forced, body tense with adrenaline, though the panic attack hadn’t come, and instead a feeling of dissociation. As if his body and mind worked at different paces. His body desperately trying to keep him in reality, while his thoughts were numb, stuck between the feeling of fight of flight.
“From the day I met you, you were different. You were kind and patient, and you loved everything so much. And you had me amazed. I couldn't understand how you could do it, find the good in everyone and everything, you made games out of traffic jams, and brought homeless people for lunch, even when I told you not to. But you never cared what others thought, or said, and you loved with every inch of your being. I never thought I could have that, but when I’m with you, I do. I love you with everything I have, and everything I am.”
He could clearly remember his panic attack on the side of the street that had happened yesterday, all because of the sound of screeching tires.
Chewing at her lip Claire looked back meeting her dad's gaze. His expression sat emotionless, though Claire could hear in his tone how much he wanted her to take it. He wanted her to pretend as if the first fifteen years of her life didn’t happen, as if they were a family, as if Dean hadn’t left them.
“I didn’t fucking ask for an I told you so,” Dean snapped. He sat up properly, green eyes glaring at his brother, who stared back in the same frustration. Neither spoke until Dean took a deep breath, letting his harsh glare falter. “Why don’t ch’you want t’help him?”
“Heya Sammy,” Dean greeted, forcing a wide grin across his face as he turned to face his brother. He began to push himself up to sit properly though as pain flared across his body, he decided being half sat up would have to do. “Where are the kids’?”
That thought continued to tick at his mind as he quietly walked back across his room, and towards the hallway, heart still hammering. He didn’t want it. He’d been looking, thinking, wondering, not considering.
Then like every other Christmas morning Dean slowly picked up the three mugs, carefully carrying them across the kitchen, into the hallway, and towards the living. His socked feet padding against the wood flooring as he turned from the hallway, and into the living room doorway.
“The alcoholism, the no friends thing,” Sam could only dumbly nod along, as his friend listed back everything that Sam had told them about his brother. He couldn’t listen to it any longer, maybe he’d admitted too much about Dean.
His gaze stayed there until he could hear Cas’s footsteps returning. He quickly flipped the other’s phone over, placing the glass of scotch down,a dn instead grabbing the paintbrush, before he rushed over to the wall, he’d started on, just making it as Cas returned.
Castiel brought a hand up pointing to a kid that looked similar to himself, “That’s my brother Michael.” He moved his finger as he spoke stopping at each sibling he named, “Lucifer, Gabriel, Anna, and Samandriel.” Cas finished pointing at a boy much younger than the others.
The child paused his sobbing for a second, looking up at Dean in curiosity. His cheeks were still a bright red and his eyes hazy with tears, but he’d become silent, and Dean considered that a win.
Dean’s first clenched at his side, teeth grinding. He waited for the other to reply though when Cas didn’t, Dean unclenched his jaw. “And you think they’re right,” Dean barely whispered, Cas not replying. “You think i’m a drug addict?”
“We’ve only just started talking again,” Dean replied. The chance of ruining things was too high, which was selfish of Dean, wanting to hold onto whatever relationship they may have rather than make sure Cas was okay. But he’d always been the selfish one in their relationship. “I don’t want to lose him again.”
This time the security didn’t answer, instead writing something across the paper in front her. She then grabbed a second paper, handing it to Dean.
He could feel his heart in his throat, his breaths becoming more forced with each word Dean spoke. Stomach twisting as Dean talked about the girl he’d met at the bar, exchanging  numbers, the way her hips had swayed as she walked away.
Chuck hummed, “there are a handful of times when he was a teenager, and I believe three or four as an adult.”
“I do,” Cas insisted, even as he spoke he walked backwards slowly. His eyes darted from Dean's face to the mall entrance that was a few shops away. “I am very sorry.”
He’d shown them around, insisted they could go anywhere, minus his or Lee’s room which both needed searching, eat anything, play in the heated pool, though Cas had seemed unconvinced. As if when Dean returned he’d go back on every promise he’d made, no matter how many times he’d made it.
Even when the door had been shut the questions and camera flashes could be heard, the car only becoming completely silent when they’d driven a block or so away.
As they stepped out of the forest the scenery opened up onto a cliff side, the sound of crashing water filling the silence.
“I’ll wait here?” Dean suggested, stopping a few doors away from the women’s. Cas followed suit only looking back in silence, much like he had for most of the drive. Dean and quickly given up on trying to talk to him. No matter how unbearable the silence was. He didn’t want to push the other, Cas would talk to him when he wanted to. “You talk to her.”
“Look at those son of a bitches.” Dean cried. He looked to the other, with a wide grin, Cas smiling back, “they’re fuckin’ awesome.”
Even Jack had picked up on it. The child’s smile having dropped, feet shifting closer to Castiel. Close enough that he almost hid completely behind Cas.
A second of silence passed. Sam surely stared in shock, eyes wide, and mouth a gap unsure how to reply. “Dean-”
“Hey, El,” Dean began attempting to sooth her sobbing. Though even to himself his voice sounded frantic and shaky. He brought his arms back to his side. “It’s okay I just want t’help.”
Dean walked around the car getting into the passenger seat, while Sam got in the drivers, and Cas in the back with Jack, while Ellie and John were in the far back. The first half of the drive was filled with conversation, mostly between Sam and Dean though Cas joined in occasionally, and Jack attempted to at times though he couldn’t talk much. While Ellie sang from the back of the car, singing as loudly as she could to whatever song played on the radio. It lasted until the high had worn off and Dean had become exhausted, instead finding more interest in watching the New York streets whizz by then talking.
“Remember the first time we went ice skating?” Dean asked softly, his eyes immediately meeting Cas’s as the other turned his head. His features sat emotionless, lips pressed in a tight line, and chin tilted up the slightest bit in a fake confidence; one that may have fooled anyone else, though after years of Dean sitting on bathroom floor with the other, holding his hand through panic attacks, he knew Cas’s small ticks too well.
He was alone, with a bloody handprint on his jacket sleeve. No Cas, no empty, and no changing his mistakes.
The music rang through Dean’s headphones, loud and blaring, cutting out the world, and everything that he had yet to accept. With his eyes closed, and feet propped up he could almost imagine he was in some motel, waiting for his dad to return from a run, or jumping between his dad's new side jobs.
The nurse gave a nod before stepping away, he then walked back to Cas, stopping to talk. Dean continued to watch them, until his gaze met Jack’s, a wide smile immediately spreading across the child’s face
He couldn’t focus on Lee, no matter how hard, even when the other was right next him handing over the microphone.
Cas’s gaze dropped back down Dean's body, his nose scrunched the slightest bit, something that if it weren’t for the fear, Dean would have thought was cute. “You are more than just a bit. Organ failure, a developing esophageal perforation, anemia, heart damage, malnutrition. You're incredibly sick.” As Cas took a small step forward Dean tensed. “I can fix it though it may take a moment.”
"I won't!" Despite Crowley's protests Dean hung up, letting the phone fall from his hand and onto the couch. "Fucking Crowley," Dean mumbled. He kept his head tilted back, studying the popcorn ceiling, as he hummed a slow beat. He drummed a finger against his thigh, trying to keep the melody going, it would've been easier if he'd had his guitar, but with that still in his car, his fingers would have to do.
He hesitated for a second, the powder barely a centimeter from his nose, before he closed his eyes and without a second thought snorted the powder. A second line quickly followed. Dean then pushed his way out of the bathroom and back into the mall. He couldn’t waste time, in fear of making Sam suspicious, though as he walked back up to his small group none of them seemed concerned.
The white powder stared back at him. Familiar and welcoming, traced with a taunt. A tease as the energy, the confidence, the pure euphoria was at the tip of his fingers, only a thin layer of plastic away. He could taste it across his tongue as if the drug already laced his mind. He could feel the way the needle would pinch his skin, the minty spike that would shoot up his spine.
“So does being homeless.” Dean opened his mouth to respond though quickly closed it, unsure how to. “Dean, I have nowhere to go, no money, Jack doesn’t deserve that life.”
Dean glanced to his brother. Had Sam said something, or had Cas seen something. Did he forget to put on the sunglasses? Dean brought his hand to his face feeling the plastic of the sunglasses as well as a sticky substance from his nose. “Son of a bitch,” he cried as he looked at the crimson red blood that now coated his fingers.
“You can’t sleep with him! I told you! Or anyone in my building, I like them, and I want them to like me!”
He stuck his hand in the same way he’d done the night before, though when he didn’t feel the plastic bag a frown grazed his face. “Shit,” he mumbled. Dean leant his head under trying to see if the bags of cocaine had fallen. Even when he heard the sound of the door being opened he didn’t move, instead continuing his search, pushing a few items to the side.
Hot, rough, and emotionless, filled with shameless moans and barely audible please. Hands bruising skin, gasped breaths, lips sucking hickeys into skin as nails scarred backs, that’s how it always was with Lee.
If your interested in still reading some of my stuff I’ll probably be posting a few cute short one shots!
Dean raised a hand to the back of his neck, as he glanced around the shop, unsure exactly where to look. He could see a few people glancing their way, mostly women, with a look of pity, and sympathy. Probably thankful for once it wasn’t their own child making a scene.
Dean’s fingers leave Cas’s arm and instead are brought to Cas’s chin, gently yet forcefully tilting Cas’s head so he had no other choice but to look at the other man. The other man who was so close, so close that Cas could only make our one thought through his spiralling mind and boiling insides; how hadn’t he noticed Dean’s eyes. barely inches away, and the only thought Cas could make out through his spiralling thoughts, and boiling insides was how hadn’t he noticed Dean’s eyes. They were such a vibrant colour, a breathtaking shade of emerald green that were flecked with lighter and darker shades.
“Five days.” Dean didn’t look up from his phone, instead keeping his head down as he found Charlie’s account and hit follow, shoving his phone back into his pocket afterwards. “Maybe four, I don’t know I’m leavin’ Monday.”
For a moment Cas didn’t reply, his gaze on the cat in his lap one hand brushing through Atticus's calico fur while his other rested around his cup of tea, leaving the room to sit in a heavy  silence. Each breath that parted Dean’s lips seemed too loud, seeming to echo off the walls, bouncing back.
About deleting Logan's number. He should. He couldn't. He enjoyed talking to the other too much, he enjoyed where their relationship was at, similar to when they were friends, or had just started dating. Part of Cas wondered if their relationship could be fixed, if he'd made a mistake, made some assumptions, maybe a small scare was all they needed.
It wasn’t until Cas tilted his head that either of them made some kind of movement, there eyes still locked on one another’s. “Dean,” Cas began in his usual steady voice. “Are you busy Thursday evening.”
When Cas disappeared into his own apartment, Sam turned back to Dean, his features rested somewhere between exhausted, and worried. “I think you should stay here.”
He tugged harder at his hair, grinding his teeth together, in an attempt to gain control, though no matter what he tried it always seemed lifetimes away. The panic and sound spiraling around him for what seemed like hours, until all at once the sound stopped, his eyes still squeezed shut, body tense with adrenaline.
Dean tucks his phone back in his pocket and knocks on Sam’s door, peering inside to see his brother curled in a ball under a thin sheet. “Hey, Sammy. I got some more Gatorade for you. Can you sit up and drink some for me?”
Dean froze a second not meeting his eyes, then let out a long sigh. "You really like to talk stuff out, huh." It wasn't an accusation, more of an observation, and Castiel just nodded. "If I tell you, will you sit perfectly still while I finish?"
“You too,” Castiel says truthfully. “At this rate, I might know more about you than I do my own brother.”
He can’t understand why this time was so different, why it felt so…amazing. He isn’t sure if it was just Castiel, the humiliation of it being public like that, or what…but his body had finally thrown up the white flag. Instead of it feeling terrifying, it had actually felt freeing. His ass was so exposed, and his pants around his ankles—he’d felt small, and somehow, unbelievably cared for. Safe. The orgasm had snuck up on him and been the final cherry on the pie. He had no idea how Castiel made him like something he normally loathed so much. To top it off, Castiel thought he was
“Yeah, well between you and Jo never calling me, I would feel like pariah if it wasn’t for Sam here. He never misses his mom on Monday call.” Ellen gives Sam a wink.
“If you're my good boy you can,” Castiel adds with a smirk as Dean groans, pressing a hand to his crotch and willing his cock not to harden.
Alistair snarls and presses on the remote. Dean’s body is rocked by the power of the jolt that runs through him. He falls to the floor, body convulsing and twitching. The pain radiates through him and it just won’t stop. There’s a screaming sound of agony ringing through the room and Dean vaguely registers that the sound is coming from him. This might be it, he thinks, it might be the end of the road. That’s when the pain stops and he hears yelling and scuffling over his own screams.
Before he can overthink it he replies with a curt, “Yeah, okay, whatever,” and leaps out of the car, moving toward the back door. He hears Castiel’s own door shut and the sound of his footsteps following him. When he reaches the creaking screen door, he pauses, turning to look at Cas.
Castiel suggests they order dinner in, but Dean balks at the idea and starts pulling random ingredients out of the pantry. Cas looks at him incredulously, but the omega just shoots him a lopsided grin and gets to work. He grabs flour and vegetable oil, an array of spices, then heads for the fridge and pulls out a container of raw chicken, eggs, and buttermilk. He heads to the sink to wash his hands as Castiel just blinks at him.
"It’s really not that bad, I swear, lots of people have been through much worse. I'd get it though, I mean if you think I've got too much baggage, you'd be right, I do. I'd understand if you want to stop this, whatever this is."
“She said in about another hour or so. Want me to tell her to set an extra place?” Missouri’s eyes hold that knowing twinkle to them as she grins at her boss.
“I’m peachy, Cas. Glad you’re ending things with him. Just be careful…he’s a dangerous guy, okay?” Dean comforts himself by acknowledging that Cas rarely attends these things alone. Plus, Roman already had his revenge on Cas—it's just Cas who doesn’t know it yet.
Twenty minutes later, Castiel drags himself downstairs. The kitchen is bustling with people, many of which give him comical wolf whistles as he comes into view. He feels foolish dressed this way, as he does each summer when he’s forced out of his standard suit and tie. Still, the pool opening is a good boost to morale, something he could benefit from at the moment. He’s donned blue swim trunks, a gray t-shirt that must’ve shrunk a little in the dryer, and a pair of water-resistant flip flops with aviator sunglasses perched on his head.
marathon while they eat. They spend the rest of the night eating pizza and laughing at their favorite show. When Castiel finally goes to leave, it’s with a promise to let Dean come with him on the camping trip. A few nights out under the stars with his crush sounds fucking amazing.
“Nice to meet you.” He nods, thinking the chef is someone he definitely wants to be on the good side of.
Always at the back of his mind now is Cas. Is there anywhere in this potential future that he could carve out space for the man? He can’t see it, can’t see how to make that work, like he has puzzle pieces from all different boxes and he can’t force them all to fit together.
Castiel chuckles. “I made sure to bring her from that man’s house as well.” Sam jumps out of the front seat, smiling and tossing the keys to Cas before beaming down at Dean.
He wants to take Dean, right here—right now. To tear through that dirty, wet t-shirt with his bare hands. To unbutton Dean’s jeans, strip him, manhandle him until he’s on all fours, then part those beautiful, gorgeous cheeks and
“Okay I deserved that… I miss you,” he adds, quieter than before, already feeling guilt twist his gut.
“Eat,” Castiel says, popping another piece of bacon into his mouth, and Dean thinks he is pretty damn lucky to have such a badass man.
“Hello there, Dean, long time no see.” Roman’s mouth twists in a victorious smile as Edgar, Roman’s right hand and muscle, closes the door behind them.
“Yes, but…” The corners of Castiel’s mouth quirk up into a smile. “Don’t you think LaCroix is ‘pretentious, flavorless, hipster crap’?”
“Seriously. To suggest laying off two hundred people without batting an eye…” Dean trails off, sounds irritated as he crosses his arms.
Castiel feels a wave of nausea pass through his body. He resists the urge to shout, to lash out, to kick them all out of his house. Of course this is upsetting, this is horrifying, no one should have to put up with this. But Dean knows it’s all on act, at least on Castiel’s part—right?
After a quicker-than-expected forty minute drive he pulls up to the large house, saving him from his own thoughts. He turns around the large circular drive and stares up at the expansive estate. Mansion is more like it. He barks a nervous laugh as he looks up the huge white pillars and delicate landscaping all around the front entrance. His eyes catch another small drive off to the side and he figures it’s the service entrance. He pulls around till he reaches a small parking area.
the first chapter got so much (completely unexpected) positive feedback (thank you all omg) that I had to keep going!
Finally, he looked up to meet Dean’s eyes, and he saw plenty of sadness there, but no guilt. Something inside Dean ached. Did he care so little that he didn’t even feel
In the full light, James could see the entirety of the hurt/angry/panicked expression on his fiancée’s face, and he stopped. “What?” he asked, and she stood, arms crossed tightly.
It hits him in a way it probably shouldn't, and it's suddenly all Dean can do to just hum in agreement and let the silence fall again—heavier, but somehow more comfortable.
Sam actually rolls his eyes. “If that’s not good enough for you, can always help me and Cas archive,” he points out, which isn't
) even without any of his family backing him up, so they all trudge off to bed with the promise of Dean proving them all wrong tomorrow.
but then Amelia seemed to realize she had been staring for too long and stepped back in a hurry. “I’m sorry,” she hastily apologized, blushing in obvious embarrassment. “I just—you look so much my fiancé’s brother’s boyfriend, but I’ve only seen him in a pic—in pictures,” she explained.
“I’m glad he’s doing well,” Dean tuned back in at the sound of Cas’ voice, and he looked up to see his boyfriend smiling softly at the phone. He looked back up at Dean and held his gaze, smile faltering.
Dean, who is knee-deep in Himalayan folklore, sighs without looking up from his laptop. “That’s the million-dollar question, buddy.”
“Better than molecules, yeah?” he asks, as Cas sighs into the warmth of the coffee, and he gives Dean one of those small smiles meant only for him.
“Sure. Listen, I gotta go. But really, Dean. Be careful. And I’ll see you tonight, yeah?” It was Star Trek night tonight, part of an ongoing saga to get Cas into sci-fi. Dean sighed. “Yeah, yeah. I’ll see you.”
Dean leans forward, elbows on the table, and looks at his brother almost pleadingly. “Sammy, if you don’t get me out of this bunker in the next 24 hours, I swear to
Cas looks at him as if he’d just asked the dumbest question in the world. “Of course not. We’re taking the snowmobiles.”
Dean shrugs and slings the arm not holding the cocoa around Cas’ shoulders. “Nah,” he replies, even though they both know he would have taken
animal,” he gestures to the Yeti, “we might as well save the rest of them. At least turn the poachers in to the authorities.”
“Because—I don’t know! Because of—things like this,” she gestured to her phone, which Jimmy had set on a counter. “And because—aren’t you supposed to be, like, closer than close? You’re telling me you have a twin that you’re
Cas looked up and shrugged slightly. “You’ve met two of them.” And as that was Dean’s only real rebuttal, he was at a loss again.
Cas hums. “Knowing I won’t be alive to watch them erode, or to watch more form…” he pauses. “They feel more permanent.” He turns to Dean, smiling. “Thank you for risking archive duty to come out here.”
Charlie, who had been quiet most of this time, gave Dean a triumphant kick in the shins under the table. He glared at her.
A split second later, before he could really even process it, he was pulling Cas across the table to kiss him, and nothing else mattered.
He’s about to hang up, but Claire protests on the other end and he reluctantly raises the phone to his ear again. “Burning daylight, Claire.”
Unfortunately, the blonde woman didn’t seem to agree. She blinked, then quickly shook her head. “No. Listen, I know you mean well, but if there’s anything I’ve gotten from all this, it’s that no matter how sad they are they don’t even want to talk about what happened. I can’t imagine forcing them together would go well.”
“Yeah, it’s good to see you too. Now open up,” he knocks on one of the back windows. “We’re staking out with you.”
James stared at her, at a complete loss. “I got lunch with Rodger, if that’s what you mean?” it obviously wasn’t. He took a deep breath. “Really, Ames, I have no idea what’s going on.”
It’s the same size as Eileen, at least, probably taller. But it’s certainly not the giant Dean had been anticipating.
Amelia sighed, checking her phone for the time. “Listen, it’s been really great meeting you, but I have to go. I’ve already eaten up enough time, and I have an exam Monday.”
Dean raised his eyebrows and leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. Out of all the ways he expected this to go down, this wasn’t it. He expected his boyfriend to be smarter than that. He scoffed. “Really, dude? You ran through all your options and you’re going with ‘that’s not me?’ Come
They haven’t seen him since he became God—which is still a weird thing to say about your three-year-old—but there he is, as if no time has passed at all. Sam is the first one up the steps, long legs taking them two at a time to crush the kid into a bear hug. “It’s good to see you, Jack,” Dean hears him greet quietly, and then he’s stepping aside to let Cas through. Cas, who—holy
Cas paused, regarding Dean through narrowed eyes for just long enough that Dean started to worry that he’d made it worse, but then he nodded and smiled. A real smile, a warm one.
investigate—or, at least, as serious as they can be on the snowmobiles they had to rent because he didn’t want to risk moving Baby in the snow. They hang around the main lodge of the resort, posing as first-timers looking for tips on what parts of the slope to avoid. They finally hit the jackpot with a couple of middle-aged women who are simultaneously warm and welcoming, and eager to gossip over cups of hot chocolate. They go through the standard spiel about easy hills for beginners, but then one of them (the one on the right, named Amy) leans in conspiratorially. “I’d stay clear of the eastern slopes, though. If I were you.”
“We have to stop them,” Jack is already rising from his chair. “Snow leopards are nearly endangered, we can’t just—"
They load up the car and take off just after 10—Cas is in the passenger seat, leaning grumpily into Dean’s side and nursing a full thermos of coffee, relegating Sam to the back. They swing by Eileen’s and all traces of Sam pouting about seating arrangements disappear when she climbs in next to him and greets him with a kiss. Dean watches them in the rearview and smiles, and Cas squeezes his hand across the bench seat.
, you know? To just…swoop in and save things. We left the criminals tied up for the cops and everything. I felt like
Dean turned slowly, disguising it as a stretch, to watch Amelia Everett walk across the café to order her usual. Right on time. As predicted, through—as much as Dean hated to admit it—stalking.
The next morning, Dean makes them all pancakes. Claire and Kaia take off with two of the snowmobiles down to the slopes so Kaia and show Claire how to snowboard, and Sam and Eileen take the other one because they’ve suddenly discovered a joint passion for skiing, so Dean and Cas and Jack stay behind to make snowmen and snow angels (
“If they’d tried to take a baby in front of it’s mother, they wouldn’t have gotten out alive,” Cas points out, and Dean shrugs.
Neither of them had any idea when, in a windowless lecture hall, in the middle of her economics class, Amelia got a panicked text message accompanying the worst photo she had ever seen.
Christmas movie. He curls into Cas' side on the couch, watches Nakatomi Plaza explode, and feels warmer than he has in a long time.
Dean turns very slowly to raise his eyebrows at Sam, but he waits until they’re outside to say “I told you so.”
Cas swallowed thickly, pushed the phone back across the table, and didn’t meet his gaze. It was silent for another long, terrible second before he spoke.
, Dean thought, smiling back. “I’ll accept those terms,” he replied, already leaning in—and that was that.
Charlie sighed and closed her laptop. “Through stalking. But we’re here now. What are you going to say to her that you couldn’t just send through Instagram DMs?”
clear that I, Charlie Bradbury, don’t endorse any of this. My fault or not,” she turned back to her laptop. “And excuse me for trying to do the right thing. Don’t get me wrong, Dean, I’m thrilled Cas isn’t cheating on you, but who was I to know this would end up like some
Dean blinked at it, staring at his phone just steps in front of his classroom, and he could feel the blood rushing in his ears as his vision turned red—to match his face, he was sure. But if there was
a bear,” Dean grumbles into the dark of their bedroom, not caring that he sounds like a broken record. “Okay, Dean,” Cas sighs against his chest, already half asleep, and it’s so close to the
Cas stares at Jack for a long second, looking for words, before giving up entirely and reaching out to pull his son into a tight hug. Dean can see Jack smile over his shoulder even from where he is by the car. “Welcome back, Cas,” he says, and Cas laughs and squeezes his shoulder as he pulls away.
“I’ll let you know if there’s another one,” Dean promises, and hangs up. His phone buzzes with the exact address—a warehouse outside of town.
Cas moved back a bit, consternation written across his face, and he fixed Dean with a look that said he knew something was deeply wrong, but he had no idea
managed to fight his way through the commitment issues, emotionally unavailable, afraid-of-love bullshit Charlie had been lecturing him on for years, now wasn’t the time. “I’m sorry I was angry,” Dean said instead, and Cas smiled at him, and he knew it was over and everything was okay.
“And that’s all I have,” Amelia shrugged, taking a sip from the last dregs of her latte after recanting how her own photo fiasco had gone. After a brief, if awkward, explanation of who he was (leaving out all the cyber-stalking, of course), Dean had convinced her to sit down with him and Charlie to try and fill in the gaps. So far, it hadn’t been too helpful.
“—Guys?” Eileen cuts him off, and they all turn to follow her pointed finger, just in time to see a small figure duck back behind a tree.
and calls it 'a break?' Knowing Cas, it's probably just some dumb misunderstanding that blew up." Dean paused, then smiled, an idea forming. He leaned forward, conspiratorial. “So. They don’t talk, they’re both sad about it. We’ve got three months left of senior year. What’s a better grad present than a family reunion?” he grinned.
“You nerds have fun,” he grumbles, but there’s no heat behind it, and he squeezes Cas’ shoulder as he leaves.
“They bonded,” Cas explains, as if Jack being buddies with the Yeti was the weirdest thing about this situation.
Dean grinned and typed in his number, a buzz from his own phone signaling the photo had gone through. He stared at it, smiling.
. He’d come back from the Empty and they’d had to tell him that Jack wasn’t dead but he was gone, and he was also, well. God.
“Remind me,” Claire breaks it, “why we aren’t just going in, getting the Yeti and calling the cops to deal with the leopards?”
She looked at him for a moment before crossing the room and wordlessly shoving her phone in his face. He took it, holding it closer to his face for a moment. “Huh.” He looked back at Amelia, still waiting for an answer. His eyes widened as it clicked. “Oh! Oh,
The extraction is quick because two human men, even with guns, are no match for four hunters. They leave them tied up but alive, and tip off both the authorities and the local animal control about the four leopards. The Yeti, which is smaller than the one back at the cabin but still straining at the bars of its cage, struggles as the four of it haul it into the impala. Dean’s heart aches for it, but without Cas’ soothing words they know they won't be able to calm it down and can't risk opening the cage.
But then there’s a soft noise from behind Cas, closer to a whine than a growl, and suddenly the smaller Yeti is clawing its way out of the car and past Cas to throw itself at the larger one, who’d followed him out of the cabin. Dean watches through the car window as the two hug, and he smiles. He’s seen that before.
They pull up to the mountain cabin they’d splurged on (although it’s not really splurging if they used Charlie’s hacked card) just past 8pm. The impala’s wheels immediately sink into the soft snow covering the driveway, and Dean grimaces looking at it, but he doesn’t have time to worry too much—not when Jack is waving to them from the porch.
on it, okay). Cas hums and props himself up on his elbows, realizing this is going to be an actual talk.
“Hey, Frosty.” He leans against the railing next to Cas, close enough that their shoulders brush. “How’s that mountain air feel in your human lungs?”
“A Yeti,” Dean confirms, and gives no time for more questions. “Listen, I just need you to case the joint, okay? Let us know what we’re walking into.”
“Lucky for you, there was only private plane recorded in U.S. airspace, traveling from Nepal, landing within 500 miles of Aspen in the past week. It landed in Rawlins, Wyoming last Tuesday.”
“Yes! What was I supposed to think? I had a whole speech planned about unconditional love and acceptance and support and—hold on, did you say
Everything goes back to normal, after that. Dean makes burgers and Sam over-spikes the eggnog and after dinner they eat the grocery-store berry pie without cutting it into slices. It’s not quite Christmas but it’s the closest they’ve gotten in years, even with Mrs. Butters—which
Which, admittedly, hurt his grade on that exam, but Dean had never minded that. It had been worth it, he told himself, and he believed it until…
There’s a longer pause this time. “As much as I’m all for animal conservation, isn’t that more of a call for someone like Jody than for us?”
“Okay. How?” Charlie responded, unfazed, and Dean frowned. “I was hoping I’d figure that out once we got here.”
Hours later, Castiel snoring softly beside him, Dean was staring up at the dark ceiling and doing the exact opposite of letting it go. There was always a way to fix it—Dean had Bob-the-Builder'd his way out of enough situations to learn that. He just needed more intel.
“Such…a…fucking…sap,” Dean rasps, smiling up at him, and Castiel realizes belatedly that he’s said all that out loud. “You gonna move anytime soon?
All he wants to do is slump into bed and hold his mate, but he has to maneuver Dean’s leg over to one side—which requires a good amount of fumbling, thanks to Dean’s belly and Cas’ knot. It’s getting to the point in Dean’s pregnancy where penetration may not be achievable for too much longer, but Castiel has perfectly good hands and a rather skilled mouth. He has no intention of denying Dean pleasure when he wants it.
“Paul, right?” Dean guesses, wondering if he should go the friendly route instead of surly. “Look Paul, I got no beef with you, alright? Just walk away.”
“You gonna be good for me, omega? Already so wet and hungry for me.” Castiel’s low gravel makes his skin prickle.
Right as he feels the wave of tension building up to an unmanageable level, his phone buzzes. He looks down to see that he has a message on his Signal app. They’ve only exchanged a few messages in the three days apart, and they haven’t been nearly enough. He clutches at it, grabbing his phone—desperate to hear from Cas. But he freezes a second before opening the message, wondering if he’s canceling or having second thoughts. Well, better to find out now then at the club. Besides, he likes his own whiskey better than the shit they serve at Black and Blue.
“Do you want to taste her, Dean?” Castiel mutters in a raspy voice, sliding a hand inside Dean’s pants but not touching his cock.
intruder—but the relief is short-lived. As soon as a flicker of light fills the space, Castiel can see there’s panic on Dean’s face. His t-shirt and boxers are drenched with water, and he’s shivering slightly in the nighttime air.
“Well, that is your second big issue here, Dean. Your blood pressure is through the roof, your heart rate is elevated. Your blood work shows anemia and multiple vitamin deficiencies. Based on your vitals and symptoms, you are suffering from rejection sickness.”
“You feel so good, Cas,” Dean moans, his hand speeding up rapidly. “Fuck, there’s so much…so many things I wanna do with you…”
TCBaby: Oh yeah, CB and I bid on art from the lovely Gio and won some truly hot and explicit stuff. Like everything we do, y’all, the art is NSFW. You’ve been warned. ;)
Hey y'all, vacation was amazing and getting back to work has been rough but I finally got this chapter written. Love you guys <3
His hand slows and he strains his hearing, wondering if it’s just Missouri coming to confirm some details for tomorrow. But she would’ve sent him an email or text first. The floorboards creak and Castiel sighs, figuring it’s just his luck that the one day he’s feeling indulgent, it’s rudely interrupted. He shuts off the water and only dries halfway before slinging a towel around his waist. He wears blockers out in public and around the house, of course, but there’s a short window of time after he bathes where his natural alpha scent permeates the room. It’s why his bedroom smells like him—woodsy and light, like sandalwood, with a slight spicy sweetness, cinnamon or cloves. He pads out of his bathroom, walking awkwardly because of his erection, and checks his phone.
Strong fingers massage at his jaw and blue eyes inspect his face and body up close. Dean relaxes into the gentle touch he doesn’t deserve.
His pet cradles the hoodie as if it’s a precious prize, and he grips it up and holds it close to his face, sighing into the fabric. “It smells like you,” he breathes, with wonder in his voice.
“Who is the guardian in this situation? Don’t you go stressing about me. I'll be fine.” Dean stands to tuck the bills into the mail holder by the fridge.
Castiel is fairly certain he can’t breathe. Normally he can comprehend legalise easily, but with Dean potentially in jeopardy, it feels like his brain is sinking in quicksand. “Does that mean…?”
At the same time that Pam asks, from the kitchen, “Go where?” Gabriel shakes his head at the suggestion.
—and the fact that Dean is offering means he feels the heightened attraction between them too. It’s more than just a Dom and a sub interacting—there’s chemistry here, lust that has nothing to with their biology.
Castiel glares at him, but reaches for the mug of black coffee on the tray. “Don’t call me ‘swoon-worthy,’” he says, taking a long sip. It burns his tongue and he finds he doesn’t care. What could possibly hurt him more than he’s already been hurt? “It’s creepy.”
But there’s a problem with this game—Cas doesn’t want him. Plus, the touch of Benny's hand makes him feel… off, wrong,
“Impala, Master,” he breathes, and Castiel feels better knowing his toy hasn’t completely let himself go, not
Castiel flushes, butterflies in his stomach. Dean has put just as much effort into the evening as he has—he just masks it well with sarcasm and embarrassment.
“Yes, Master,” he replies, quickly already imagining how good it will feel to have the searing heat of the leather on his skin.
Dean can’t smell Cas but he can taste him, making his head swim and his body practically vibrate with need. He really wants Cas to just bend him over the desk, pull down his trousers, and work this talented tongue into him till he’s begging for his knot, and—
“Won’t be gone long, Sammy,” Dean answers, clapping his little brother on the arm and jostling Castiel out of his thoughts.
“True,” Castiel concedes, but then brushes Dean’s elbow and whispers softly, almost to himself, “And some things haven’t changed at all.”
The man hesitates a moment before looking at Dean and standing up from his stool. “If you're ever interested, Bambi, the name is Alistair Cross.” The creepy guy leers at him one more time, then slinks off into the crowd.
Castiel chuckles a little, feeling some of the tension in his chest unraveling. “In most of the dreams, there are complications. Sometimes you go into labor early, sometimes it’s late. We’ve had the baby at the hospital, the cabin, the manor…even the Impala once.” Dean smiles a little at the thought, kicks his shoes and socks off, and gives him a thumbs-up. The gesture gives Castiel the strength to continue. “But every time, Dean, you end up dying and I…I fall apart.”
He shakes his head ruefully, knowing tensions have been growing high the closer they are to the delivery date. While Dean is understandably nervous about juggling a full-time career with a newborn, Castiel has been fretting about a dozen other things—what if something happens to Dean? What if something happens to the baby? What if Castiel is a terrible father? What if having a child strains their marriage? The alpha has spent the past few months drowning in
“Yard work is one thing, or office work. Carrying in a bag of groceries is okay…but setting off explosive devices is
“I’ve been known to make a few things, yeah. Where’d you hear it from?” he asks, eyeing the man as they reach the long coils of rope.
“I helped Alfie wash the cars this morning. I washed the Impala too, with that Armor All soap you like. He’s offered to drive me to Lawrence, actually.” Sam shifts where he’s sitting. Dean knows Sam too well and can sense a question coming.
“Well, I hope you like it. And you’re free to read any of the books in here that you’d like,” Castiel adds.
An especially hard hit lands on the meat of his shoulder and upper arm and he lets out a cry of pain. His eyes are burning with unshed tears. He can’t even remember now what he was so angry about. All he can feel is the sting and burn of the whip.
Dean’s own voice is a bit shaky, and he clears his throat a few times. “Okay, I believe you.” He does believe Cas, and it may seem like a small thing but it means everything to Dean.
“Do you agree to these terms?” Castiel keeps his voice level, but he can already see a flush spreading across his pet’s chest, his hands trembling.
“I do, yes. Most of my meetings are conference calls, so if you could look at that to-do list Missouri left over here…” Castiel leans over him and points out a to-do bar on the side of his calendar. “Then I have an in-person consultation meeting with Mr. Adler around lunch. I’d like it if you can sit in and take notes for me.”
“If you’ll excuse me, it’s been a long day and I have other business to attend to,” Castiel says briskly, standing and pulling at his jacket by the cuffs. Dean follows suit, standing and shooting Castiel an approving smile.
“I’m secure enough in my masculinity to order wine when I want it, Dean,” Castiel says, feigned scolding in his voice.
"I'm sorry you were in that position, Dean. I actually have some empty sketchbooks and art supplies in my attic. They were Jimmy's when he fancied he'd become an artist. I bought them for him for his birthday. That obsession lasted all of a month before he quit." Castiel gave a soft smile at the memory and Dean relaxed a bit. "They are yours if you want them."
Castiel bites his lip, considering this point for a moment. Pam takes advantage of his contemplative look, adding, “He’s right. If you and Dean had met somewhere else, you might not have ever known you’re a ‘subpar’ match. I’d bet my medical license you would’ve been perfectly fine, if not completely healthy and happy, if you had just trusted your instincts.”
“Still can’t believe I did this to myself,” Castiel says grumpily. “So sick of walking around with this limp.” Castiel sighs as Dean moves to lift the opposite leg, getting a much easier stretch.
“Maybe I can help you with that,” his sub whispers hoarsely. He clears his throat, biting his lip in a tempting way that Castiel wants to zero in on. Castiel isn’t quite sure why the man is reacting this way, but he supposes this
“There now. That’s nicer.” Michael steps up closer to him and he has to squint at the bright light. A back hand swiftly strikes him across the face and he topples to the side, groaning as he hits the cement floor. “You do not make eye contact with your Dom. Do you hear me?” Michael’s voice booms and Dean’s stomach twists with anger and fear. “Kneel,” Michael commands, pointing right in front of his feet.
“Fuck! Jesus fuck, alpha, oh my fucking… Christ, don’t stop,” Dean begs, voice strained and practically slurred as he shouts. Castiel loves when Dean gets like this, when he lets go so completely and trusts Castiel with his beautiful body.
Castiel clears his throat, busying himself with the stack of papers on his desk, and decides to avoid the question. “I just meant, it’s a common misconception that a dominant has to be physically larger than their submissive. The act of submission has nothing to do with being overpowered, and everything to do with offering your obedience willingly. A dom will be entrusted with your needs and your wellbeing, and that is a gift that should be respected and cherished.”
Dean chuckles, exhaling before admitting in a rush, “Okay, well…we’ve talked about how getting off is one of the only ways I’ve been able to get out of my head. Right?”
“So perfect, you're just so perfect.” Castiel finally shifts, pulling Dean’s legs up and out, sliding a pillow under his hips all while never letting his lips leave Dean’s skin. His inner omega purrs.
They finish dinner in silence, and Dean drags his aching body to bed. He stares at his phone, wishing he hadn’t deleted Castiel’s messages. He just wants to hear his alpha’s voice. Well, not
“Yes Sir,” Dean breathes happily, leaning into Castiel’s hand, eyes closing pleasantly. “Shit, that was…that felt so good, Sir, like…like I was floating.”
“Sure thing. Where is it?” He had intended to figure out his laundry situation, but he can never say no when someone asks him for help. Jo turns and leads him down a hallway toward the west wing and into a small side door. They enter what is essentially a large closet tucked behind the big staircase. There’s a desk, a wall of TV screens, and two office chairs. He glances up at the black and white screens to see all different parts of the house, both inside and out.
Hearing the sound of feet approaching, he lets out a long breath. “Took you long enough.” Dean looks up to find Sam but is greeted instead by five sets of unfamiliar eyes. He looks at their faces a moment, and he realizes it's the same group from earlier—the ones who catcalled him in front of Benny.
Oh My Chuck Guys!!! I can't believe how far into this story we are. OK my friends (yes I am calling you friends) this is a slightly longer chapter but I cover a good amount of ground. There will be a point in this chapter where I could have left an insane cliff hanger, you'll know it when you see it, but I kept writing cause mostly I couldn't stop myself lol. I hope you guys like this one we are covering more ground here. Thanks for all the support <3
He goes to Castiel’s side, lacing their hands together. This seems to steady Cas a bit, giving Dean a more genuine smile. “You met Sam just fine. This will be a piece of pie.” He kisses Cas on the cheek just because he can.
Castiel plates both of their food, and Dean watches as he puts the extra crispy pieces on Dean’s plate. Dean opens his mouth eagerly for Castiel to feed him his first bite, when he hears a scoff across the table. John is glaring at him, but he can’t figure why. Castiel has fed him all his meals since they came home.
He walks back to his apartment leisurely, his light gray t-shirt and black shorts clinging to his skin. When he can no longer withstand the sensation of sweat dripping down his temples, he pulls his shirt up and mops off the perspiration, flashing his bare torso and ruffling his hair in the process. When he lowers the shirt back down, he sees his coworker, Hannah, sitting on the front steps of his apartment complex with a flustered look on her face. Castiel realizes she had caught a rather full glimpse of him, much more than he usually reveals in his medic uniform.
“It was…” Dean pauses, scratching the back of his neck. He’s spent the past few seconds gazing into Castiel’s eyes, and it makes the alpha’s skin buzz, his hands fidgeting from adrenaline. Having Dean’s undivided attention seems to have that effect on him.
“Ready?” Castiel asks, as he rubs a towel over his damp hair. Dean licks his lips and tells his damn pregnancy hormones to chill. Still, just the sight of Cas damp in his jeans and t-shirt makes his pants tight. “Don’t look at me like that. Your brother should be here any minute.” Castiel smiles at him, and Dean thinks his scent obviously gave him away.
Castiel is unable to deny his mate anything right now, which is his only excuse for growling out with lust and slipping two fingers into Dean’s open hole. They had sex just last night, and he’s pleased to find his husband wet and pliant again, begging for Castiel’s cock to fill him up. Castiel props Dean’s hips up with a pillow and bottoms out quickly, knowing neither of them are going to last long, but he’s feeling too raw from their earlier conversation to deny them this pleasure. He pistons into Dean as forcefully as he can while still being aware of his omega’s belly, dick warm and slippery inside the tight channel of Dean’s perfect ass.
"Well, I have a favor to ask, and I know that it might be a pain for you, but I am going out of town on business next week, May second through June fifth. I want to bring Gordon with me but it will leave no one to watch my house. If it’s not too much trouble, could you stay at the house and watch over the slaves and property for me?"
Castiel sinks down to Dean’s chest, but finds it annoyingly covered in clothing. He lifts Dean to a sitting position, their hard cocks brushing each other indirectly, and Dean’s breath gets caught in his throat.
“I’m trying to find a way out of this for us. I’ve been through every legal precedent I can, trying to find a loophole. I even tried to see if I could just buy out the contract, void it completely and absolve the debt—”
,” he admonishes, unable to keep his tone from sounding accusatory. “What in the world are you doing?”
Dean blushes a lovely shade of pink, biting his lip and staring at Castiel with something like wonder on his face.
“I think I need to break things off with my...my friend with benefits. I just don’t know how to do that without being a total dick about it.”
The omega turns obstinately, eyes trained on his lap. Eventually his gaze lifts, perhaps Dean finally deciding to give in, and a gradual sweep of eyes locks them together. There’s pain behind Dean’s eyes, a deep sense of forlorn that makes Castiel suppress a gasp.
Castiel hums and rubs a hand up and down Dean’s thigh. “We ran your levels tonight before I pulled you out of the scene. Everything is normal ranges, now: serotonin, subamine, norepinephrine. Your blood pressure has come up and stabilized and your blood sugar has leveled out as well.”
. “It’s in the bottom of the birdhouse. I’ll call the emergency line and get the power turned on for you boys. I expect you to let me know the second you get there safe.”
Dean’s body freezes—it suddenly feels like he has a brick in his gut. He watches as Castiel stands and offers him a hand, helping him to his feet. He wonders if this is when the axe is gonna fall. Gordon was one strike one… Maybe this is strike two.
Castiel growls in frustration and snatches two pieces of bacon, chewing them aggressively. They taste greasy and cold and it nearly pains him to swallow, but he does, because he needs to hear an update on Dean...even if it is secondhand gossip.
“Look, FlyBoy and I are just friends and we decided to keep it anonymous, alright? And my other hook up, well…” He blanks for a moment when he thinks of his blue-eyed dom and the sweatshirt currently laid across his pillow. “It’s just about sex, okay?” The second the words leave his mouth it has a bitter, wrong taste to it. Is it really just about sex with his dom? He’s pretty sure it feels different than any other dom he’s been with, their connection feels so much bigger than that. But then again, the guy still wouldn’t give Dean his name, so the line in the sand is staying firm. Just about sex then.
idea. “Though, not before you clean me up. I’m afraid you’ve gotten me quite dirty, Dean, and it’s your responsibility to fix this.”
. If he signs this he’s basically signing up to be this guy’s bitch for two whole years. “There’s no way, I am not gonna be your omega whore,” Dean growls, slamming the papers onto the table.
The walk to the house isn’t long, especially since Dean cleared a nice walking path through the back garden up to the main house. He likes that no one can see the cabin from the house, giving them more privacy. Still, he loves that the rest of his family and his work is only a few minutes’ walk away.
But he thinks of Dean—his integrity, his moral compass, his faith in Castiel. And he says, “I’m in the process of finalizing the paperwork with a potential buyer. Once it goes through, I’ll only retain a small percentage of the equity. The new investor will take over the bulk of the communication in my stead.”
“Nothing. Sorry, just…nothing. So what’s up?” He tucks the card into his jeans pocket which does not go unnoticed by Sam, though he thankfully doesn’t comment on it.
She leans down and pulls a final packet of paper from her bag, laying it gently on the table. Sam reaches for Dean’s hand and he gives it a reassuring squeeze. Late last night, he and Bobby had discussed this over a few glasses of whiskey. If John had sold the contract and they couldn’t buy it back, they had an exit plan. Canada was damn cold, but they didn’t have omega contracts like the US and had difficult extradition processes. No alpha was ever gonna lay a hand on Sam so long as Dean drew breath.
“Hmm, probably not till late afternoon. Why?” Castiel walks over to Dean, leaning in to whisper, “Does my omega have plans for me?”
But a suspicious look from Missouri had snapped him out of his haze, and he just tried to breathe through his mouth while they cleaned. He’d just gotten his boner under control when Castiel told him to order a sturdier bed, because apparently the alpha fucks so hard he broke the last one. Just the image of that had driven Dean to run to his room and rub one out. He was glad he had the presence of mind to clean his bathroom quick after, seeing as he was leading Sammy to the suite now.
He isn’t sure how to finish that sentence, but Jo is suddenly giddy, rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet. “Wait, are you saying what I
He nudges his face against Castiel’s groin before pulling his half-hard cock through the slit of his underwear, spitting in his hand before jacking Cas off. Castiel hardens quickly, the possessiveness in Dean’s eyes and the licking of his lips going straight to Cas’ libido. When Dean swallows Castiel’s cock, he does so without preamble, his lips stretched around tightly and the cockhead hitting the back of Dean’s throat.
Castiel slips out of the shiny black SUV, adjusting his sunglasses on the bridge of his nose. It’s the early afternoon and the interstate had been backed up already, but Alfie navigated the traffic expertly.
Castiel lets out a huff or relief. “Honestly, that’s a welcome idea. I was feeling overwhelmed with the prospect of hitting the ground running today.”
“Yeah, too fucking long,” Dean sighs and looks back up at the man he loves, “but I wouldn’t trade any minute of it. Even the painful parts. It all brought me to you, to us.”
“To everything. And all time. All at once.” He furrows his brow. “At first, it was overwhelming, but now…” he looks around at their small circle and smiles. “Now I understand.”
“Honey, I’m ho—” James got half-way through the cheesy tradition, which Amelia usually found so endearing, before catching sight of her and frowning. “Why are you sitting in the dark?” he asked, slipping off his coat and hanging it up before moving to the kitchen and flipping the switch. Light spilled out from the open kitchen, illuminating the other half of the living room.
"Could still be a bear," Sam grumbles, with the air of a man who knows he's lost. Dean chucks his empty cocoa cup into a nearby trash can.
The next morning Dean is ready for Sam in the kitchen, armed with eggs and toast and Twitter. He waits until Sam accepts breakfast before launching into it. “We gotta go to Aspen.”
A few hours later, she pulled out her phone, finding the message thread created when Dean had texted himself the picture. Taking a deep breath, and hoping for the best, she typed out a short message.
haven’t mentioned. Sounds real likely.” He said dryly, hoping it would sound less absurd out loud. It didn’t.
It started off badly—texts that start with “I don’t know how to tell you this” rarely end well—and got worse when the picture loaded.
“I’ve met your brothers,” he argued back, because it seemed the most obvious fallacy. Gabriel lived close enough that they saw him somewhat regularly, and he’d met Michael over an incredibly uncomfortable dinner while he was in town for business. Neither of them had mentioned a mysterious twin.
Randomly running into Jimmy’s mystery-brother’s boyfriend in Starbucks had been fun, Amelia thought, but now she was ready to put it behind her and accept that closure as the best she would get.
“I get it,” Sam cuts him off with a huff, then pauses and sighs again. “Look, if you’re really that stir-crazy, call Jody. I think Claire and Kaia are tracking a vamp nest through Nebraska.”
young Castiels. Or, Dean corrected himself, one Cas and one…what name had he said? Jake? James? Dean made a note to ask later. And also ask how one of them got named
She stared at the phone in her lap, not wanting to unlock it to see the contents but mentally preparing herself to use it if she had to. The whole day had been a battle between intense anger and trying to come to some semblance of understanding. Was he gay? That would be okay, she had finally decided. Well, not
He frowned as he watched her leave, and once she was gone, sank back into his chair with a pout. He wasn’t
But Castiel just sighed and picked up the phone, zooming in for closer inspection. Dean stared at him, closely, as the expression on his face shifted from confusion, to recognition, to something like…grief?
Dean sighed, and nodded again, this time saying something. “Okay.” Cas visibly relaxed, and Dean took this as permission to wrap his arms back around his boyfriend’s waist, pulling him closer. “Okay. I’ll let it go.
There’s not much to do, really—the plan is pretty basic; find wherever these poachers are, take them out, take off with the Yeti (if there is one) and leave the leopards for the local authorities. Jack takes the Yetis back to the Himalayas, where they belong, and…all is well.
Stepping closer, she could tell it was the picture of Dean and Castiel, which she hadn’t even remembered sending him. “Honey?” she questioned, and James jumped, quickly closing the photo.
He trailed off there, and something warm and comforting bloomed in Dean’s chest. He slid Castiel’s phone back across the table towards him, then left his hand there, open, inviting. Cas slid his own hand in without a second thought, and he linked their fingers together.
He sighed, and crossed his arms, all sign of amusement gone. “It’s a big campus. We’ve avoided this for years, I guess I thought we could make it the last few months.”
discussion questions on Vonnegut (Dean was still in disbelief that the university let him fill his core requirement with a class on sci-fi, but he wasn’t complaining) when he got the text from Charlie.
why? But they attended the same services at the catholic center on campus. A progressive one. The priest pinned a pride flag up before every service, for God’s sake. So maybe he wasn’t gay and was just cheating on her. That would be
he mocks to himself when he’s back in his bedroom, staring glumly at the Netflix loading screen. He gets 10 minutes into their newest gimmicky dating show before he’s closing his laptop with a huff and stomping down to the shooting range.
Cas says that Dean can't fix it, but Dean is never one to back down from a challenge. No matter how many times Charlie says it's a bad idea.
Cas goes entirely still, arms loosening around Dean’s waist. “It’s different now,” he replies, quietly, and Dean immediately feels like an asshole. “Human,” he clarifies, as if Dean would miss that part.
Neither of them noticed a young woman, across the lounge, surreptitiously snap a photo and send it off to her best friend.
,” Cas insists, and he’s frowning when Dean glances at him. “You are a wonderful man and you do wonderful things. You didn’t kill anything because you didn’t
He smiled, but it was thin. “Yeah, of course. I just—” he gestured with his phone. “It’s good to see him happy, you know? It’s been a while.” He swallowed, thickly, and that sad look was back, and Amelia made a decision.
“I apologize for not telling you. I…you weren’t supposed to find out this way. It’s difficult to talk about, and I admit that I thought this campus was large enough that it wouldn’t become a problem just yet. The only reason we’re both here is that our mother thought it would force us into getting along. As you can see, that didn’t happen.” He stopped there but didn’t break eye contact, searching Dean’s face for a reaction.
They pull up to the warehouse a few hours later, park the impala out of sight, and Dean sneaks up without warning to rap on the window of her red car. He’d feel bad for laughing at the way she jumps if Kaia didn’t also laugh from the passenger seat. Claire glares at her girlfriend, then turns the icy stare on Dean as she rolls down the window.
“Oh. Jack,” Cas starts, in his kind voice, reserved for teachable moments with hard lessons. “We don’t know where they are, if they even had leopards, if it’s not too late—”
“What? No,” Dean leans closer to his phone, which Sam put on speaker. “Head back to Nebraska, we can handle this.”
Cas looks between Jack and the Creature. “We’ll take it back with us. Once it knows it’s safe, it’ll warm up to you.”
Dean looks down. He shrugs. “I was thinking, uh. You’re always going on about us needing a vacation, right? So let’s say this doesn’t shake out—or if it does, but it’s painless—I figured we could hang around a bit. You can grab Eileen, we’ll call Jack down from God duty, and…you know. Relax.” He looks back up at Sam, who looks even more confused.
Castiel looked up when Dean approached, immediately greeting him with the wide smile he had come to know and love, but Dean fought off the warm fuzzies and kept his face tight, unforgiving. The smile faded and Cas began to stand, but before he could, Dean slammed himself into the seat across from him and fixed his boyfriend with an icy stare.
Cas turns to smile at him, and he’s not sad, like he’d feared. “Good,” he answers, completely honestly. “I like it here. I like the mountains, as a human.”
Sam looks up from where he and Eileen are scouring the internet for sightings in any other parts of the US. “What if it wasn’t a commercial flight? What if it was a—uh, charter flight? Or private plane?”
If Cas caught the sarcasm, he didn’t show it. Instead, he nodded, some relief creeping into his eyes at Dean’s faux understanding. “Yes. That’s correct. We don’t, um. Speak. Our brothers respect our wishes to not discuss each other.” The relief was gone, replaced with a frown, and he reached out for Dean’s phone, unlocking it so he could once again see the photo on the screen. It was an intimate action, and Dean remembered the day he’d let Cas program his fingerprint into his phone—they’d been about to go on a road trip, and Cas only needed to be able to text Sam back while Dean was driving, but he had seemed so honored by the gesture that Dean had kept it.
“Meg, whatever I’ve said—done, to make you think— I’m sorry. But this isn’t what I wanted. This is not what I thought we were doing.” Castiel sounded upset—as upset as he could, notorious stone wall he was, standing at least five feet away from her with every bit of him closed off and looking almost
, and Meg could stay out there like a chastised dog all night for all she cared after this. She shut the door and left her out there, and watched through the window, but her expression and position didn’t change at all. Shaking her head, she walked back into the den, toward that warm, quiet, dark space she’d been enjoying a lot with her girl before this shit went down.
“Enough to offer far more than that.” His eyebrows rise, expectant, and Dean smirks, closing in on Castiel’s “personal space”. (He has never had the issue with it Dean has; from very early on in their acquaintance, he enjoyed the thrill of intimacy.)
” Dean jokes, fighting a yawn, finally opening his eyes in time to see Castiel’s stern expression. Cas isn’t real fond of Dean’s sense of humor when it involves bagging on himself; Dean
because of—that, at least a little bit. Not the whole protection thing, not always, but man, I know you’re part of that, I got that loud and clear, and.” He’s quiet, eyes closed and face in Cas’s sweaty hair, his voice choked. “We both are.”
Dean trembles, barely noticeable except for Castiel feeling it through his fingers. He would read Dean’s mind, but he has promised not to, and honors that promise as much as he can. “Might be bad for you,” he warns, but Castiel remains undeterred. This
Dean’s sleepiness slips away, because Cas is being even less understandable than usual, unless Dean’s usual

and whatever…” She trailed off, mildly triumphant, and Castiel stepped away from her and turned around to leave.
, to Cas. I should pull you down from that damn tree, friggin’ sitting there like Queen Bitch of the World, and—”
Castiel’s mouth tightened, and Dean felt his stomach jump at another reminder of the severity the guy seemed to be trying to express. “I knew you well, Dean, after Hell. I will always know you, the way you were then. Humans are wild and artless, hard to predict, confusing for one as foreign as I was. Jimmy was helpful, but nothing was more relieving—and, and
“He thought I was…interested, then, when we’d only met. I couldn’t argue with him, feelings were difficult for me. I couldn’t always identify why I was connected to you.” Castiel’s thoughtful look turns troubled, his eyes moving away from Dean’s face. Dean shakes the wrist that’s carelessly draped over his chest, trying to grab his attention back, but he remains diverted. “I thought it was my grace, or some form of—” and finally he faces Dean again, pressing his hand flat where it lay. “Ownership, forgive me, Dean. I thought it was because I’d returned you to yourself, that it was pride in creation, and it was unclean, blasphemous, because the only true creator is God.”
“No to your firmly closed lips, Dean Winchester,” he says, directly staring, watching Dean’s unblinking response, feeling Dean startle under his hands. Dean likely hadn’t realized he’d noticed—or even that he’d been doing this.
Castiel’s answer is almost inaudible. “At first, thinking of your regard was odd, off-putting. The brothel, in Maine, was especially enlightening to me, but even then, I didn’t
He shakes his head, removes all space between them until their noses brush and Dean’s eyes are too close to meet.
“Mm, nngh,” Dean breathes over his lips, when they finally separate. Castiel’s eyelids lift as slowly as Dean’s did before, and Dean looks pleased by whatever they are communicating to him, seems to lose all his previous reluctance as he shoves back into Castiel’s mouth with aplomb until both of them are, again, panting.
“No? You’re mixing your signals here, buddy,” Calmly amused though he might seem, his restraint fades with the shock and his eyes fully darken for a minute or longer before he controls himself again. Castiel is very grateful sometimes for this particular indicator.
“You were interesting to me, because I had been told so much of you, and yet, you defied the telling. I found…
but it’s kind of sweet, that Cas, the big dumbass, left him alone cos he thought he was happy. He might’ve hated it back then, and part of him does now, but he can see, now, why Cas would do that. Even if he didn’t like it.
Don’t call me that. It’s been a month—never really know when to stop pushing, do you. I’m unsurprised.”
Ruby welcomed her into her arms and closed them, strong and browned, around her. The comfort was undeniable, but then she heard muffled yelling, and sobbing, and the thunk of what was probably Cas collapsing onto his best friend in the world and knocking him into the door, and it just didn’t quite work as well as it should. She could hear a low rumble, like Dean was trying to ease Cas anyway, despite his own rage, and as much as she wanted to help—
morning–rubbing her bare arms in her ribbed tank top as the cold seeped in, to make sure, and yeah, she was gone.
to help her brother, nobody got to Cas like Dean did, and it was better to stick it out and wait for their bond to work its magic.
. Have I asked you for more? Ever given any indication I wished to repeat the experience? I can’t recall an occasion.”
affection is one thing Dean will never get, and Cas has tried but he can’t seem to even explain it himself, so it’s better left unsaid.
Shaking his head, Castiel does something unprecedented (Dean kids, he kids) and returns to the point. “But yes, that is the appropriate translation. I was fond of you, as I am of Sam now, as I’ve been of Anna, of Balthazar, even of M—” Dean makes a little disgusted noise and Castiel’s mouth twitches as he closes it with a snap.
But until Charlie updates them, there’s nothing they can do. So Dean sits against the wall, with Cas, drinking their coffee, and when he drains the mug he presses a kiss to Cas’ temple before climbing up to go make lunch.
Dean moves around the couch, trying to get a look at his alpha’s face but he’s staring at his lap, face in shadow.
“You better,” he lets out a long breath and can’t hold back the smile, Castiel’s storm blue eyes full of hope.
“Uh, nope. These feet stay on the ground. Couldn’t you have dared me to do something easy…like, I dunno, blow you?”
