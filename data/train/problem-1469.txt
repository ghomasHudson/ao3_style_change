Sherlock grinded back onto John, Sherlock was mildly impressed with the maneuvering John was doing to get Sherlock out of his pants and trousers. Sherlock took a deep breath as he felt John’s cock graze against his well fucked hole. He arched his back getting ready for the intrusion.
John laughed, “oh really you sure it wasn’t because you were wondering if you absorbs bit of me through your rectal lining because you said some really weird things post orgasm.” He kissed Sherlock before rolling on to his side.
Sherlock nodded and took on the Mastador, he felt it really pulling him and he thought that maybe he would take a bit of work, he looked around the park. There was a pond and it was filled with ducks. Bopper looked like he was scanning his surroundings, Sherlock thought that he would make a great watchdog and would probably be very loyal, he liked that about Bopper, it was very easy to feel safe with Bopper. He looked around and noticed Solomon and Golem were just resting by a bench. And Rosie and Mrs. Hudson were looking at the flowers.  Sherlock smiled, for once he was just seeing what was in front of him, he didn't feel like he had to look at every possible detail just in case something went wrong. "I like Bopper as well, I feel like he can take on a lot of the background noise, like I can really focus on important details and not get consumed by the background noise. But there is one more dog, this is going to be a hard decision."
Mycroft smirked, “I think we both know the answer.”
John laughed, “yes, I agree that all goes in the green column.” He pressed a kiss into the back of Sherlock’s laugh as Sherlock joined in on the laughter.
Kayla gestured at the cake on the ground, "how do you think that got there? Toby has been trained to only bark when someone is having a seizure.”
When he was satisfied with just how flustered Sherlock became. He grabbed both a hot blade and a cold blade and pressed them together in hopes that they were close enough that Sherlock’s brain would read it as one blade. And he held the blades over Sherlock’s thigh near where the initial cut was made and he raised his hand slightly and then pushed into Sherlock’s skin as hard as he possibly could. John could hear a muffled scream, and he saw Sherlock’s absolutely explode with an orgasm. But he heard the three sharp taps that was their non-verbal safeword.

Solomon waived his hand in the air, "charitable donations are a blood sport, sometimes you got to fight dirty and appeal to some part of a person that makes them want to give be it for genuine hopes to help or by stroking their ego or offering a tax deduction. Or a combo of all of the above."
“Hey man, it wasn't me!”snipped a young blond man in nothing but a shit ton of body glitter, a hot pink Andrew Christian briefs, and a pair of sneakers. He was smoking some capri cigarettes
"I mean of course you are proud of them all, but we don't know know what Mycroft does other than taking after Uncle Ruddy and I am still not sure if my brother was a malevolent or benevolent force in he government, that boy does seem to keep so many secrets. Sherlock well, we don't need to brag about him, his roommate does that enough and I mean it does make the conversations easier since we aren't the ones who started it," said Siger quite earnestly.
This was the first time John “agreed” to cut Sherlock the way he wanted to cut him. The thing was all parties involved that ultimately thought that it would cause more harm than good. But Irene guided John through a way of giving Sherlock that sensation without causing the damage, it actually would.
The trio looked at Sherlock fairly stunned, Sherlock never likes anyone and for him to make such a comment was unprecedented.
“Are you going to be a good boy for your captain?” Asked John crouching down to Sherlock, running his hands through Sherlock’s hair. He smirked at how Sherlock reacted so enthusiastically about him calling himself “captain” he was going to have to play around with that.
Kayla wrote something into her note book, and nodded. Well judging from our conversation earlier, I think all we have left to buy is the milk.
"Why is he so big?" asks Rosie.
Sherlock laughed, "you would be surprised. I am not exactly an easy person to get along with. Through the years I have gotten better at it, learning to care and all, especially since you have been in my life." He started to frown, "I know I built a lot of walls around myself and written over or forgot about things to make it easier to not care, but all that happened with my sister, I realized that I had to change that, because I wasn't always like this, I wasn't always alone." He sunk further into the couch, "I don't have to be like how I am, I am starting to change and at times I wish I could change faster, but this is taking time, and I regret how much time it is taking."
John's head turned and he stared at Sherlock. His eyes never left Sherlock as he descended, slowly, slowly slowly, until Sherlock could feel John's breathing on his groin.
Moran turned to look at Sherlock and his eyes widened. "You came with him!", he shouted. "Look at that! Getting a backseat bingo from the nerd, Sherlock?", he said, raising his eyebrow.
John blinked and turned to look at Mike with a frown. "Huh? What?"
Sherlock stared at him, his face showing his surprise. A tear was threatening to make its way out of his eye but he tried as hard as he could to pull it back. He couldn't, however, suppress the knot in his throat.
Sherlock stopped him, his face dead serious. "Don't. Don't you dare say that."
"You're lying."
Sherlock lifted his hand and touched John's face, and it was so warm, it felt so right. John closed his eyes at the touch. "Goodbye, John."
Greg waited for a couple minutes more before he left Sherlock's bedroom. When he came back to the living room and looked at John sitting on his chair he looked at Sherlock with a smile, raising his thumbs up. Sherlock dragged a deep breath and shook his head slightly, Greg's face falling.
Sherlock smiled, “Yes I will probably want to do that again in the future.”
Aithne smirked.
"Oh come on Sherlock don't pull that over me, you didn't get your way so of course you went to mummy, you are never going to have a private moment again, I swear to g-d, I don't even care what my agents see between you and your John but it wouldn't be the first time they saw things isn't it. He used to bring his girlfriends to your apartment. I have video." hissed Mycroft. He got distracted by his office door getting thrown open with a crack.
Rosie looked at the two of them, "cake?" Which for any young child seems like a reasonable response to having to deal with a complicated tea time.
"Blaze, you wanker, that group is all about following the rules, they don't tolerate breaking the rules. Also I really don't need to know about the ongoing adventures of your ass," snipped Aithne.
He ran back up to his room, grabbed his tinker box and brought it down to the kitchen. He got into a flow as he gently pulled apart a bike chain as he wrapped it around a ball baring, he used a zip tie complete the loop. He started to spin it, in hand, he found the balance absolutely perfect. He kept it going for as long as he could when suddenly he was shaken out of his flow. Papa gently shook him, and he noticed a smell he previously missed. It was smoke he looked at the source and saw it was the pan he used for the play dough.

Chapter 12
Aithne came back to the table, and continued on as if she didn’t leave to use the restroom, “I am assuming he was used to quiet because the other two siblings was quiet, like Sherlock the middle one was very personable and a big people pleaser, but sometimes things would happen that cracked a hole in that shell, so like when Blaze’s interpretation of the rules of a game was different from his, an argument broke out, a rather vicious one at that. And there was the youngest her name was Eurus, she was quiet and from what my brothers said they all thought there was something off about her, but given that mother and dad told us to try our best to be nice. I decided to go full on because let's be real being the only girl sucked and the idea of a friend that was a girl sounded very appealing. And who knew my luck that out of the families mother can pick for us to meet they just happened to have a daughter who also couldn’t feel pain. So can we all guess where that goes from there...” is
Jeanine laughed, “nope most times I am telling people to just break up.”
Ella laughed, "I don't do interventions, I just gently draw it out of people."
John nodded, and pushed Rosie's stroller into the stroller parking and grabbed a cart to putting her into it. He wore Rosie's baby bag, one of those weird ones that looked like an engineer corps bag, it was a gag gift from one of the guys in his Veteran PTSD group. After one of the group members saw him running around with a floral bag petunia pickle bottom that Mary got. It was an impractical thing that while everything had it's place there is such thing as too many things to fit in such a large bag. It was at one point bigger than Rosie. He really didn't like the thing, but he wasn't about to let toxic masculinity stop him from using a £200 bag. Rosie laughed as she was put in the shopping cart.
But one day, William was just not feeling it with homework. He found it absolutely boring and unnecessary. It was exactly a year since he settled with the name “William”, he was very much relieved
William did understand where Uncle Mycroft was coming from, but he really didn’t have time for that. If this problem could be solved by manipulating data on a computer, he’ll take matters into his own hands. He had his own computer, and he remembered that at one of the Trans Youth Program sleepovers, they watched Mr. Robot together (Ryver, one of the girls from the group info dumped excessively about how there were multiple trans women in jail for hacking bank systems, not that they did anything wrong they just wanted to prove that the banks had holes in security that needed to get fixed, but people don’t like being shown errors). It made him think, maybe he could solve this problem on his own. It just may be a little sooner than people think he should be able to solve it. And if he could solve that problem, what other problems could he solve with just some keystrokes.
“That could be anyone,” Said John inching closer to his shit “kitchenette”, the man was next to his desk so the gun was out of the question, but a knife will have to do. He didn’t like what this stranger was doing.
“What do you mean Sherlock? She’s only 7,” replied John.
Sherlock took his seat, pulling his legs up in the seat, he folded his hands and tucked them under his chin. He was buzzing in anticipation in the way a child is gleeful when a rival gets in trouble.
Violet was staring at Sherlock, and she appeared to be concerned.
“William, where did you hear that?” Asked Sherlock, “and if it matters that much to you, I will ask you father to marry me, I mean it is about time now that you mention it.”
John shook his head and back into his Captain voice, “No sherlock, I want a verbal answer, that is an order.”
By the next day, John’s hangover had dissipated and he let what memories he could gather from his stag-do be what they were. What he remembered, he remembered. What he couldn’t remember, he couldn’t remember. He decided it was best that way—stories of drunken shenanigans were embarrassing enough when he was a youth, and surely became all the more embarrassing now that he was a middle-aged man. Perhaps not remembering very much about his inebriated behavior was a blessing in disguise. Since he and Mary’s hypothesis that Sherlock’s proclivity for angering strangers seemed to be a high-probability reason for their arrest, this was the story he went with whenever one of Mary’s friends giggled and said to him
“Where?” John asked.
He needed to
He shoots you a sour look. “I’m never wrong,” he says. He nods down a street to your right. “Turn here.”
“Have you two tried the fireplace yet?” Hugh asked. “Every guest we’ve had loved it.”
, Sherlock said, eyes still pointed at the photograph.
may it wither in the cold!
You chuckle and help him sit back on his knees. His breaths are starting to slow, but his voice sounds harsh and torn. You run gentle fingers over his throat. His airway doesn’t appear to be restricted, but he could stand to get checked out by paramedics all the same.
“My pleasure,” Claire said, and with that she pulled her boat away from the harbor, turning back towards the mainland.
John could hear Sherlock breathing again, rough and angry. “Understood,” Sherlock said.
“Would you think of me?” Sherlock asked.
Thanks for sticking around and being awesome. Love you guys.
“You just saw me,” John said, choking back a yawn. “One hour ago.”
There’s a place for the people with nowhere to turn,
“A bastard,” Sherlock agreed.
Watching Gilly, John saw very little of the woman he dated for nearly a year. Where the Gilly he knew was bubbly, this woman was sleek and cool. Where the Gilly he knew was chatty and just a touch flighty, this woman was calculating, sharp. He once saw Gilly cry at a movie where a cat died, and this woman looked as if she wished for nothing more than to gut the two of them like pigs. John considered that he spent the better part of a year dating a complete stranger, someone whose true nature was kept entirely hidden from him.
Mary had rubbed at his chest, doing her best to comfort him while being half-asleep herself.
—before you remember the hit count. Right. Appallingly low, but one higher now that you’re here.
“Sherlock,” he gasped. “Oh god, Sherlock.” There was something to John’s voice, a sort of new knowledge, as if he had just made a discovery that was of the greatest importance.
John didn’t look, but he could nearly
“Ah,” said John. It did seem a bit obvious, now that he thought about it. Frustratingly, most things did. “So you think that the pages—”
that I want?”
“You’re doing great,” John said again, doing his best to keep his voice light, steady. “Should be ready to graduate to living subjects any day now.”
John let him go and he slipped underneath the hole of John’s bound wrists. The man’s arms drifted to the side. He started sinking slowly, tossed in the waves. John tried to swim away.
Lucy blinked again. She sniffed at the air.
Sherlock was in front of him, vibrating with energy. “Which means…”
Sherlock turned, grabbing John’s hand in his. “
Sherlock pressed a soft kiss to his lips before moving his mouth to John’s temple. John felt Sherlock’s lips move against the bruised skin. “You could have a concussion,” Sherlock whispered.
There was silence. John turned a page.
“Boring,” Sherlock said from under the blankets.
“We’ll just have to cuddle,” Sherlock said, nudging John with a shoulder.
He blinked, his eyes warring against their sudden use. He didn’t remember falling asleep, didn’t even remember feeling sleepy, but apparently had fallen into something akin to a coma, deep and motionless, that spanned the entirety of the night. His brain was struggling to emerge from said coma, sluggishly shuffling through the data Sherlock’s tired eyes sent in and trying to make sense of it all.
“You don’t have to,” John said, eyes still on the whiskey glass. But Sherlock was already gone, leaving John by the fire alone, feeling foolish.
Sherlock’s hips began to move—slow yet forceful—against John.
“I’ll get you another ice pack,” John said. Sherlock heard the click of the door as John slipped out of the room and down the hallway. Sherlock kept his hand pressed over his eyes. Light was officially his new arch nemesis.
“We’ve done this a bit backwards,” John said.
had anything to do with Afghanistan. He resisted as long as he possibly could (which, truth be told, was not particularly long) before he slipped out of bed and into the bathroom. It only took three rough strokes before he came all over his hand and stomach and a bit on the floor of the loo.
He dialed Gilly’s number. He raised his mobile to his ear.
John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s forehead, smiling. “I got there eventually.”
Outside, Fitz barked louder.
“I’m the world’s only consulting detective,” Sherlock said. “Sherlock Holmes. And this is Doctor John Watson.”
, but Sherlock didn’t have much time to consider how else he could respond before John continued.
Rosie giggled again. John foresaw an upcoming scenario in which he had to explain to her that they would not be getting a pet goat.
He stopped by the field for a moment to check on the remainder of the sheep. So far as he could tell, they were all grazing peacefully, unaware that anything nefarious had ever happened on their island. Somewhere off in the distance, Fitz, also unperturbed by everything, ran after a rabbit. John watched the sheep as they continued about their uneventful existence, feeling oddly out of sorts that Sherlock was gone. He ought to feel relieved to have a bit of time to himself, he knew—after all, the two of them had spent nearly every waking moment together since they arrived on this island, and hadn’t exactly kept much space from each other before they got here either. Whenever he and Mary spent too much time cooped up together, John would feel himself start to get itchy, crotchety. However, Sherlock had only been gone for a moment and John felt as if some piece inside of him had been misplaced. All of it made him feel more than a bit mad.
“Indeed,” Sherlock said.
“I might have modified my attention,” Sherlock said, “to incorporate the things that really mattered.”
Sherlock made himself go slowly—he would start slowly, with John. He would ease into him, wait until he was open and relaxed and panting beneath him. He would slide himself in and out of John with care, moving as if the two of them had all the time in the world, waiting until John was begging him for it.
. However, they were giving it a go and blowing a fuse over the word
The man’s gaze darted back towards his mate. His eyebrow lifted, so quick as to be barely noticeable. A communication.
“I am fully aware of the impact of physical contact on the release of neurotransmitters in the brain,” Sherlock said. “There have been numerous studies conducted with lab rats. Oxytocin in the presumed culprit. It is a physiological response, nothing more. If we are aware of it, we won’t be tempted to fall victim to it.”
room in the flat was dark, including Rosie’s. Odd, John thought. They usually kept a little light on in Rosie’s room. As quietly as possible, John unlocked the front door and walked inside.
When both plates were empty, Angelo returned to their table with his wide grin. “Was everything to your liking?” he asked. “Can I offer you two some dessert? We have a lovely chocolate torte tonight.”
“Best to maintain the element of surprise,” he said. “It is unclear how a former assassin in hiding might react if an unfamiliar car pulls up in front of her house.”
Hearts,
John shook his head. “Nope.” His eyes were still on Sherlock. He didn’t seem keen on ever looking away.
“Please,” John whispered.
The sitting room was empty. The kitchen was empty. Sherlock’s bedroom was empty. John wasn’t thinking it. He
“Molly is looking after Rosie,” John said, choosing to only answer the second part of Mary’s question. “Mrs. Hudson is helping as well. We owe them favors.” He scratched at his head. “A lot of favors.”
“And I certainly won’t be able to look Mycroft in the eye.”
Sherlock pored through the café again, on his hands and knees looking for footprints, loudly cursing the sea of people who walked into the little shop after Declan was shot and muddied up the crime scene, at times literally.
John shook his head, blinking back the stinging in his eyes. “I loved you, did you know that?”
“Type 1 diabetes,” Sherlock repeated.
“What are you doing here, Sherlock?”
There was no shortage of candles in the cottage, and soon the small room was bathed in a flickering orange glow. The tiny wicks cracked and popped and the room started smelling like warmth, a mixture of wax and vanilla. The light danced along the furniture and cast shadows on the walls that dipped and swayed with the tiny flames. John considered that the room suddenly looked very romantic.
“Yeah,” John said. His face was still twisted up, his breathing labored. “I’ll need you to…” he gestured at the cut on his leg. “I could do it myself—I’ve done before. But it’s hard, that. And I’d rather not if there’s someone else to do it.”
Gilly slipped just to the side of the door, preparing an assault on anyone who entered. “Be perfectly still,” she said. Her gun remained trained on John. “And perfectly quiet.”
Sherlock felt as if a knife had sliced through him. “Nothing,” he repeated.
“Why do people tear pages from their journals?” Sherlock popped up, his knees briefly grazing John’s thighs as he did so, and resumed his pacing. “Because they have written something they don’t wish for others to see. Something so private that it isn’t even safe to be kept in a journal. Something that ought never to have been written.” He turned, pointing at the journal, still shut in John’s lap. “What was in that journal that Declan didn’t wish for others to see?”
“You’re doing great,” John said, but the thick wavering in his voice made Sherlock feel as if he were taking John apart limb by limb.
“I’m a consulting detective,” he says. “People find their way to my doorstep when they’ve got a puzzle they can’t solve. More often than not, it’s Scotland Yard, but sometimes it’s the general population as well.”
“No it doesn’t,” John said. He moved forward. He could move this time—his legs weren’t worthless and stationary—and he flew forward, running into the street.
The couple behind them let out another uproarious bout of laughter. The restaurant had emptied out a bit by this point, so the sound really reverberated through the place. The both of them flinched.
Sherlock looked incredulous.
John rubbed at Sherlock’s hair. He could feel his own eyes starting to sting.
was a bit of an exaggeration. As their dinghy bobbed closer to the island, John observed that the so-called harbor seemed to be a tiny patch of concrete, followed by a steep climb comprised almost entirely of naturally-occurring rocks. John was still feeling a bit wobbly after the boat incident and was not looking forward to the climb.
He had gone and gotten himself captured, bound and gagged and hidden away in a boat. By the Taibhses, a duo notorious for murdering—with limited care and spectacular methods—every person who laid eyes on them. This was exactly the sort of danger Sherlock told him
“So you’ve been following a bank robber all across the city,” you say, “on the off-chance that he’s about to rob a bank?”
John turned his head against Sherlock’s, doing his best at pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s cheek that was not anywhere near the kind of kiss he wanted. “That seems in direct opposition to any sort of survival strategy,” John said.
Neither one of them had eaten very much of their meals, and at this point neither one of them would. Sherlock settled their bill and John took a cursory swig of his pint, not wanting to leave the thing completely untouched. As they moved towards the door of the pub, John reached out his hand for Sherlock’s, an offer.
John looked up, jaw dropping open slightly. “I…” He glanced away. “I haven’t made up my mind just yet.”
John followed close on Sherlock’s heels. “That’s not true—”
“I want you healthy,” John said. “Taking care of yourself.”
“I nearly brought you to orgasm without once touching your cock,” Sherlock said, sucking at John’s earlobe. “Just me inside you.”
” John countered, although the question was mostly directed at himself at this point. “It’s not fifty-fifty. The odds are higher that the car is behind the remaining door. You are more likely to win the car if you switch your choice to the remaining door.”
,” John repeated, his smile widening.
” John hissed again. He sounded like a gran, he knew, but he could do little to help it at the moment. Sherlock was too close to the edge. The grass was too slippy. He would fall, John was sure of it.
now? What more could she possibly have to say about their upcoming wedding that she hadn’t already said?
Sherlock nodded again. His brain was remembering how to work in stops and starts, periodically flashing him helpful bits of knowledge and experience instead of non-stop screaming panic. He knotted the suture once more for good measure, then secured the needle back in the holders to continue his work.
“I—” It
Still, that was only him. For Sherlock, apparently, nothing had changed. Still
Neither John nor Mary needed to be told twice.
“Weddings are a lot,” Sherlock said, walking to the wall and beginning to tug off some blueprint sketches of what appeared to be women’s dresses.
“Not a werewolf,” John said.
“It’s all right,” John said, his mouth dry. “It’s…that is, it wasn’t all right. But…”
John thought.
~ ~ ~
,” Sherlock said excitedly. “Come look at this. They’ve found
Sherlock rolled on top of John, propping himself on an elbow. He nudged John’s shaking palm away and took the both of their cocks into his hand, his long fingers wrapping around them in rough, tight strokes. All the sound fell from John’s mouth and he was left a shaking mess, soundless mouth open and barely gasping, barely breathing, only able to twitch and shake against Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock bit at John’s lips, his breaths ragged against John’s mouth. The both of them were burning, sweat beading on their foreheads and chests, hair dampening. John gripped at Sherlock with iron fingers. Sherlock’s head fell onto John’s chest, his forehead digging into John’s collarbone, the whole of him tight, shaking, teetering on the edge.
John felt that if he clenched his jaw any harder his teeth would shatter. He nodded. It all made sense, now that he thought about it. It all made perfect sense. “Right. So. The problems of your past, then…”
“I don’t think,” Sherlock said, “that we have to do anything.”
Sherlock glanced around the room, his hands in his pockets. “It was a good case,” he said. “One of the better ones, I’d say.”
“You boys have fun,” she chirped as the two of them gathered their things. “Some time away in the countryside, just the two of you, seems like exactly what the doctor ordered.”
“I can’t,” Sherlock said. “You—the other you—you don’t know. You can’t know. And I don’t think I can bear it, you not knowing,” he swallowed, “how I’ve fallen.”
“Couldn’t agree more,” Sherlock said with a smile, and John missed him so much he thought he might keel over from it.
Sherlock took a step forward, the smallest he could muster. “You have?” he asked.
“Alright,” John said, hearing his voice go cold. “If I’m so worthless, then, what am I even doing here?”
,” John read. “
“Right,” you say. “No choice. So if the police found out that you’d been effectively stalking this man…”
switch,” Sherlock said, much louder than was advisable given their current circumstance.
“Shhh,” Sherlock said. His eyes hadn’t left Fitz once.
painted on the side and the one in the middle had the word
“More,” he says, and takes your hand in his own, shoving two of your fingers in him before you even have the chance to think. He moans again and slaps his head against the mattress and you can’t stop staring at him. You’re afraid you’re about to start drooling.
Sherlock grabbed at John. He scrutinized his face, his body. John had scratches along his face, one or two of which boasted a thin trickle of blood at the edges. His skull wasn’t crushed in. None of his limbs appeared broken. He was still moving, still speaking, still breathing. Still here, still John.
“The owner gets out of prison in five years,” John said. “Maybe he’ll reopen.” He switched their plates so that Sherlock’s lasagna was properly in front of him now.
his well-worn vest read, and John seriously considered standing up and paying him fifty quid just to
“Right,” Sherlock said again. He managed to locate the needle holders and—after more failed attempts than he’d have liked—fit the curved little needle into the thin jaws. He tugged the needle free, a thin strand of suture thread following in its wake.
“Well,” said John. “I also happen to be playing nursemaid at the moment. To—I might add—one of the most unbelievably infantile patients I’ve ever—”
“You mean waking Rosie at half-two on Christmas morning, piling her into a car, and sneaking out of your parents house in the dark of the night, as if we committed some sort of crime?” John asked. “Yes. I’d be opposed to that.”
John could have defended his case if he wished. He could have disagreed. He could have petitioned for other facts, different ones.
“Probably from this,” Sherlock said. He pushed the sleeve of his jacket to his elbow, revealing a gash on his forearm that was leaking blood through his shirt.
“What I mean is,” John said, the warmth of the wine making him feel as if words were leaving his mouth without permission, “if I was to be in a relationship with you, it would be because I knew
“Good,” John said, grasping Sherlock by the nape of his neck, keeping him close. “I don’t want them to. It’s mine.”
Sherlock stayed still for a moment, letting their joined hands stretch out between the two of them, linking them together. Sherlock considered how organisms are bound to one another, sometimes through tangible means—cell walls and membranes, bound hands and joined mouths, invitations to enter one’s body—sometimes through intangible means—complimentary niches, defined roles in fragile ecosystems, flat shares—and sometimes through means more intangible still—heartfelt declarations, knowing looks, love. The binding agents that persist after hands are dropped. Sherlock smiled.
There wasn’t a body in the little room off the top of the stairs, of course. There was no pink lady sprawled out across the floor, coat covered in rainwater and fingernails chipped from scratching a name into the wood of the floors. She was long gone now, rotted and buried in some cemetery somewhere, the sensationalism of her death long since faded into obscurity. Still, John remembered exactly where she lay. He remembered how Sherlock crowded around her body, taking in every piece of information about her at lightning speed. He remembered kneeling at Sherlock’s side, utterly confused about everything that was going on but so taken in with the man that he couldn’t be arsed to care.
. Christ,
Rosie, of course, brought a new dynamic to the flat, but John was accurate about her ability to be endearing in all her demands. She adapted to her new environment quickly and took to Sherlock with a speed that seemed to astonish John. Sherlock found that he had a knack for calming Rosie when she was otherwise inconsolable, which earned him new responsibilities with her fairly quickly. He didn’t mind. He was teaching her how to walk.
Sherlock knew this was a bad idea, but decided an opportunity like this would never present it  self again. He also knew it was probably a bit desperate, but he would take what ever John was willing to give. So he bent over and started grinding himself against John’s leg, it felt a little bit awful and a bit degrading, he was pretty much acting like an ill trained dog against John’s leg, but it felt so good. But it was John, and he said it was okay, and John was just threading his hand through his hair, with a sad look across his face, but his eyes were dilated. Sherlock didn’t want to read into it, because there could be a number of reasons why this was happening, and as ideal as it would be for John, to want Sherlock, it could also just be the drugs. Sherlock continued to thrust against John’s leg because John said it was okay, and he was going to do this as long as he could stand. He wasn’t really experienced in this matter, and despite only having minimal friction going on he was really close to cumming, so he picked up the speed at which he was grinding himself against John’s leg. He held himself still against John’s leg when his orgasm finally hit him, but he felt a sharp tug at his hair and suddenly John’s lips where on his. John was kissing Sherlock, and Sherlock didn’t ask for that, he wasn’t quite sure what to make of the situation, but he copied the motions John did with his tongue, it was almost like a weird waltz, for some odd reason he thought of a waltz, maybe he could convince John into learning how to dance a waltz.
Sherlock just stared at her, "I don't know what you are talking about."
“Don’t be stupid John, of course I know you are currently clear of any STIs, that’s why I let you cum in me,” Said Sherlock.
“Thank you Daddy, I love you too.” Sherlock leaned against John and jumped a little bit as he felt the shower shot enter him again. He winced as he felt himself fill up with water again, but he held it in for as long as he could before letting loose again.
"Well just remember he is actually good at fighting, and you fight like the femme sissy you are," joked Aithne.
John looked at Paul, "do what?"
Scott groaned and dug his hand into his pockets and pulled out his phone and dramatically started firing off e-mails, “fucking Blaze, now I got to call legal to review anything he signed in the past two months,” he muttered under his breath.
Sherlock twitched, “to be honest I don’t even know but I’m trying my best to avoid boredom because I don’t want another trip to the country side, and you look like you need some company.”
Sherlock nodded his head, "yes I enjoyed it, I would consider doing it again sometime."
“Okay Blaze, can you list off the good parts about missing your Invega shots and all the good things that happen because you take your meds? You don’t have to choose to get your shot now, but I want you to really think about the advantages and disadvantages of missing your shot,” said Aithne. “I can call Dr. Paulo if you need me to, that way we can get you to a different thing that might help with the numbers. I mean I get it the numbers help you but remember what else came with the numbers, were those helpful for you?
just needs to sit with her thoughts and process it for a bit. I wouldn’t interrupt her at the moment.” She frowned as
The first teen said, "well we can't get off the roof till we see you exit."
John and Sherlock were in the kitchen fidgeting with the final details of things to prepare for afternoon tea with Sherlock’s parent and brother.
Sherlock nodded, and immediately started cleaning, he darterd around as fast as he could with his straining boner.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But john... you had to admit 8 years is an awfully long time, to wait, we have to play a bit of catch up,” Said Sherlock as he awkwardly rocked in John’s lap, he tried to lift up because he could feel like he was getting a little hard, and if John wants to slow down he probably should respect that by not further grinding on John’s cock.
“Hello sir, security alerted us that you are actually banned from using any self check out kiosk at a Tesco,” said a staff member with a strained smile.
Mycroft chuckled at Sherlock's confusion and he finished writing his terms on the scraps of paper.
Aithne's smirk turned into a smile.
They found Sherlock curled up on the couch, he was staring blankly, his mouth occasionally made some chewing motions. John walked over to the couch and offered a hand, "hey Sherlock are you okay?"
“I want you to crawl to the bedroom, strip, and kneel down and wait for me,” John roughly pushed Sherlock down. He playfully swatted at Sherlock as he crawled away.
John laughed, "Sherlock, I am not mad, but that really can't be comfortable." He tilted his head in the direction of the quickly drying spot on Sherlock's pants.
Sherlock gets punished for ruining dinner.
Uncle Rudy smiled but kept his eyes on the road, he eventually stopped at 221 Baker Street.
Suddenly the door opened, and Mrs. Hudson
John laughed, “really Sherlock you’ve felt this way since we’ve met?” He stopped laughing when Sherlock did a slight pout at him, he ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair.
The tore through the streets of London the way only a man with access to the traffic lights can. It made him feel in control, today and tonight he felt that he lost a lot of control. His entire family wanted him out of their business and he was having a hard time sitting with that revelation. He hated that he lost a match which meant not only did he not get as much of a chance to gather as much info as he could but also meant that he had to remove the security devices from Sherlock's home. He didn’t want to do it, but he really thought he would win, he felt really stupid, and he didn’t like feeling stupid. His grip on the moving pieces in his life was falling apart and he hated himself for allowing that to happen. He couldn’t pin point precisely when he lost control so he couldn’t even figure out where he could’ve changed things. He hit a roundabout that was empty, he took some really tight turns, “FUCK! FUCK!FUCK! FUCK! FUCK THIS SHIT! FUCK! FUCK THIS! FUCK THAT! FUCK YOU!” He rarely cursed, but sometimes it was the best way for him to let off steam, since it couldn’t possibly start a war when done in the right place and it certainly replaced the urge to eat enough calories to fuck up his plans for a month. He may have lost control of a lot of interpersonal and familial relationships, but he still could control what went into his mouth, and at least he had that.
Sherlock reappeared with a bottle of lube and a couple of condoms, “oh aren’t you a good soldier, waiting for me to give you an order.” He turned around, and grabbed John’s hair and guided his head till John’s face to his ass. “Come on, soldier show me what that tongue can do.”
“Yeah and ask him where he got the choker, because it was super cute?” said Skye.
Sherlock suppressed a laugh.
Mike smirked, “okay, so case WIHO010982 hooked up with the Captain, so none of you have to wonder who jumped the grenade last night and honestly shame on all of you, I know how you all talk about him, the man’s brother is a huge advocate for our program. Also he is actually not that bad if you get to know him. If anything it is all on you for being uncomfortable with him reading you to filth. Sure he has no perception of social mores, personal space, and seems to be stuck in a constant tug of war between overstimulation and mind killing boredness, but he is really caring underneath it all, I don’t think he can help it. I am pretty sure they will be very happy I mean Val seconds my decision of making them meet, but I do wish I made him change shirts before dismissing him for the day. But again try not to talk ill of WIHO010982 or his brother because since the brother got involved we have just been having a lot more easier of a time making progress in getting PrEP covered.”
“I promise we will no longer participate in public sex,” said John.
“I bet you can,” Said Molly as she walked away, “just wave if you need anything.”
Sherlock raised his head with a big smile, “how do you want me to cum?”
Sherlock nodded, and got off the bed, he walked around it, all while just poking, prodding, sniffing, and licking John. He murmured off his little observations about John and tried to take a guess at the origin of different marks on his body and John told him if his guess was correct or not.
John laughed, "well looks like you are actually going to clean up something."
Aithne sighed, “ah yes when they all start sharing using stories which triggers someone to relapse… that is never a fun day here.”
John gently stroked Sherlock's hand. "Sherlock are you okay?"
Sherlock grabbed a couple of boxes of Ginger Nuts and tossed in a couple of different other varieties and dropped them into the cart.
Sherlock was a little taken a back when John suddenly impeded his ability to breath. He closed his eyes to really take in the sensation, when he felt some cold glass being pressed against his face.
Irene laughed, “you had 3 examples but it applies to at least 4 of the Clara-s we know.”
Sherlock laughed, “we’ll see about that, maybe we can get it post valentines, your dad does love a deal.”
She heard a burst of laughter. In that moment Molly said that last sentence with a little bit too much emotion.
Kayla followed behind them writing notes.
Sherlock pauses for a moment, “come along John, let’s just get out of this crowd already, must you be so slow.”
“Do you really think so little of me? You did just imply that my use will literally kill you,” snapped Sherlock.
“Then don’t make anything out of it,” said Sherlock with a tone that wasn’t exactly clear on intent.
“I am not going to make any promises I can’t keep,” replied Blaze.
Sherlock looked closer and struggled to find the difference.
Hiram was slightly confused at how his youngest set of twins referred to each other, because he knew Wolf referred to Blaze as “boy” sometimes and that had implications. He wasn’t too sure what to make of it outside of some kind of weird way of the twins affirming the other’s gender identity. Or it could be that thing some gay folks do where they refer to everyone as “girl”. He shook his head, and watch Blaze walking away from the dining room in that strange swinging gait of his.
One of the officers laughed, “I don’t want to go into private security.”
John looked a bit worried.
John smiled, “okay hope to see you later.”
“It was from the morgue, I haven’t decided what I am going to do with it yet,” answered Sherlock.
“Sherlock, you are going to be proven so wrong,” said John with a smug little smirk at how Sherlock was slowly becoming more flustered with each restaurant patron. Everyone had scratches, no matter what their substance use level was. Sherlock frowned after he saw everyone’s phones his observation about phones was being challenged.
“Just checking to see if you were still with me. I’ll steer clear of that spot for the rest of your punishment, okay,” Said John as he ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, while his other hand wiped away some of Sherlock’s tears. He gave a sharp tug to Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock yelped again, “Okay, Boy, we are going to continue, is that okay? Are you ready?”
Sherlock and John continue their adventures... this time with sensory deprivation, temperature play, edge play, and knife play
The pup looked at his meal and whined, it nudged John’s leg.
“Okay, Dr. Watson, I can offer you a lot of money for this task,” Said the man.
Sherlock nodded, "that's all fine." They walked the block to the closest Tesco. Toby kept a good pace along side Sherlock and she wasn't distracted by anyone or anything. When they got to the front of the shop, John and Rosie was there waiting for them. Sherlock waved at them.
John gasped at the sudden pressure against his cock. He looked down at Sherlock, he was greeted with the image of Sherlock nuzzling his cock. John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, “well aren’t you eager, come on let’s get on the bed.” He gently helped Sherlock up, and Sherlock flopped onto the bed, John got on the bed and faced Sherlock, they were very close together. John could feel Sherlock’s breath against his skin., “so Sherlock what do you want to do?”
“Do you say that to all your bar patrons?” Replied Sherlock witca slight glare.
“So is Blaze co-parenting all of the kids in that house or just Wolf’s kids?” Asked Hiram, still slightly confused at the family dynamics of his children. “I mean does that make me a grandparent, I mean honestly i’d like to know, because i’d like to know just how much Christmas shopping I need to do and how many college funds I am going to need to set up. Lord knows your mother isn’t thrilled with any of this, but I mean that's why I have been trying to get the divorce so that I can freely handle the funds. I mean I am definitely glad she didn't get spiteful with the money before most of you got control of your accounts, again sorry, Athina, I am ridiculously sorry I couldn’t hold off until you were thirty. Setting up the college accounts are best done at birth, and Blaze’s kids are already 7 and 9.”
"...I brought you tea." Greg's voice interrupted them. Sherlock turned to look at him. Greg stopped at the door, his eyes flickering from one to the other, realizing he had just spoiled an intimate moment. Well, as intimate as it could be in a hospital while John still had no idea who Sherlock was.
The door of his house was opened, and from the entrance he saw his mother sitting in the kitchen table, hands on her head, with the telephone right next to her, waiting for news. As soon as he entered she ran towards him. "John Hamish Watson where were you?" She said looking very angry.
He entered to his house, didn't talk to his mom and went directly to his bed. He didn't sleep at all that night.
Finally, when they were halfway through their meal, Sherlock turned to look at him. “What? What is it?”, he asked.
want to live it, not how they expect you to."
"Are you serious about this thing with Irene?"
He smiled, "I think everybody wonders that once in a while."
“Yes, well, I gathered that much.”
Except for the fact that John was thinking about Sherlock even though he had just told himself he wouldn’t, but it wasn’t as if he could stop his brain from thinking. It was impossible, ever since that first meeting at the gallery, Sherlock had been a constant in John’s mind.
Sherlock had his eyes closed and his hands below his chin when the bell rang. He opened them and frowned, he told,
“You- you have the technique, and the body you were painting in Mike’s photograph was fantastic, and I was wondering if you could teach me, just a little, how to be a better painter.”
He ignored the emptiness of a room that had once held the deepest secrets of the most incredible man he had ever met, a room that had taken hold of John's screams whenever he woke up from a nightmare, or when he opened the drawer and saw the gun, and stared at it over and over and over. It had taken John's deep rumble of laughter, John's thoughts fluttering around as he wrote a new case for the blog, it had even taken hold of John's army mug, which he never left in the kitchen, considering it far too valuable for Sherlock to use it on his experiments.
“Hm”, Sherlock said, turning to look at the window.
John said frowning.
anything,
“Both apply.”
"Fi...fine, I'm fine, it's okay, everything it's okay."
"I'm sorry." Sherlock looked at him without saying a word.
"Can we go now, please?" John was bored, this day seemed endless, and though he enjoyed Harry's company, he felt... Empty. Everything seemed dull and annoying and predictable and stupid and Sherlock wasn't there.
my fault!"
She started preparing John. "Do you have any mementos of him with you?"
"No, no, no." Sherlock said moving his head spontaneously. "I'm not talking about the War."
John's mouth was open in surprise. He blinked and tried to put himself together but just before he could say something, all of his thoughts were interrupted when Sherlock leaned closer and kissed him. God, it had been so long. They had gone through so much. John thought right there he needed this, this tiny moment of peace.
"And?"
“Look at it.”
"You don't have to suppress your feelings, you know that, don't you?"
"No Harry, I'm not. Not at all."
It was nothing more than pure chemistry.
, didn't he tell him that women were not his area? Why was he dating her, then?
And yet, it was absolutely
"It's Greg! And yes I'm sure, it's really late and then I won't be able to take the underground back home, but thank you, dinner was delicious, and thank you for the gift John, really nice from you. Give my best to Mrs. Hudson"
The greaser widened his eyes and turn to look at John, who in response shook his head and rolled his eyes. "WHAT?". Sherlock turned to look at the teacher again. "Sir, I enjoy working on my own, actually I hate working with somebody, anybody, so please, let me do this on my own."
Later that night, Sherlock was looking at a couple of samples of blood on his microscope when the door opened.
He was woken up at around 8 pm when he heard footsteps approaching and the door opening. He looked up to see Lestrade, who stared at him worryingly without moving.
pick on him on he first place?"
"Hmm?" Sherlock looked unfocused, staring at the window again, thoughtful.
----------------------
"Mr. Holmes..." John insisted.
He immediately put it on once again, apparently his body was too slow at waking up, and his lungs were slower than normal.
John nodded and remained silent. Sherlock finished his cuppa in silence and stood up, fetched his violin and started playing, as he stared through the window.
Sherlock put his hands on his back."I've worked with Lestrade in a few cases."
He came back some minutes later, and offered a cup of tea to John, who took it absentmindedly.
Sherlock smiled widely and sighed in relief. Yes. John wanted to come, John was actually excited of going with him? It seemed absolutely impossible, but it seemed to be true.
"Can I come in?"
He raised his voice in the middle of the hall. "HARRY!"
It would look 20 years older, wearing a dark expression, filled with dismay, with pain, but most of all, with fright. It was only bound to get worse, it was only bound to look older and darker and grimier.
protest
---------------------
He opened them reluctantly and found
"Are you sure? You haven't even touched your food!" Mike said pointing towards John's lunch with his knife.
Sherlock flinched, looking around. “I don’t see any wonderful paintings in here”, he said with all honesty.
"You're hiding something from me. What is it?"
"I consider seven times to be many", Mycroft replied calmly. "This is my fault", he said looking down, a twinge of disappointment painting his face, "I should have seen it coming".
But instead of a kiss, Sherlock felt one of the erasers hitting his black leather jacket, and suddenly everything was white and John was coughing while he laughed and well... Sherlock's jacket was ruined.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment and smirked, looking confused. John turned and said, "I'll see you later."
"Doing what?" Sherlock said innocently.
“Is the other one-
War had taken away the only good thing left in his life. No matter what he did, something always sent him back to Afghanistan.
She smiled. "I need to talk to you. In private."
Sherlock shook his head quickly and pointed at John, who tried his best not to flush. He looked at Sherlock with a
"Shut up and let me do the talking stud! If you cause him any pain, of any kind, Holmes, I will skin you. Because he doesn't
Sherlock shook the insult and the implication away and asked her, "where is he?"
Reluctantly, John broke apart and opened the drawer of the table next to Sherlock's bed, taking out a bottle of lube and a condom.
"No. You're staying. I already called to your house."
In the picture, he wasn’t smiling, but he looked happy. His face was completely focused on what he was painting. That day he had chosen a palette of blues to mix them with green, and so Mike had chosen the same palette to print the photograph, so it looked mostly tinted with blue.
Harry stopped talking when she realized maybe she had been to harsh on him, he still was turning his back at her, but she could tell, he was having some kind of emotional overload. Did Sherlock even know what an emotion was? Doubtful.
A tiny, almost imperceptible twitch of John's fingers caught Sherlock's attention: his left hand was shaking. As soon as John saw where Sherlock's eyes had drifted to, he crossed the arms tighter, hiding his hands. And Sherlock understood why he had crossed them in the first place: so Sherlock wouldn't notice the tremor.
don't."
“Drugs?”
Sherlock finally reacted, he opened his eyes widely and looked at her in disbelief. "Wh...what... What are you doing here?"
Sherlock's smile grew even wider.
John had grown quiet at some point.
, Sherlock secretly thought. Still, it didn't make the whole experience more bearable, nor it made Mycroft less annoying.
Something in Irene's voice warned Sherlock he really shouldn't.
"Well, at least I'm judged by a
John felt his eyes well up with tears of relief.
But still not working good enough.
"No one. Let's go." Sherlock turned and left. John stood where we was, confused and looking at Sherlock.
"I have one." And Sherlock immediately regretted what he said. He didn't know why he had said it, but he did and there was nothing he could do about it.
"Lestrade", a sleepy voice replied on the other end of the call.
“Stand in front of the mirror.”
John sighed, “what are we using, then?”
John didn’t reply.
But oh God, he loved John. He loved him so much.
While he slept, he kept jumping from one dream to the other, not quite sure what he was dreaming of, only knowing the sleuth was there. Within the dreams John wondered what the hell was going on, he was aware of Sherlock's presence on them, but what was that man doing there?
Sherlock pursed his lips and didn't answer. Instead he looked down. He stood silent.
"I just need you to keep me undercover from your brother. Don't let him look at your texts, if he asks, tell him you know nothing about me, and please, please, don't let John talk to him. He wouldn't doubt for a second if it was about killing me."
greaser
A playful voice called after him.
Oh of course, he had been buying time. While he contorted with pain he managed to break himself free from the rope tied around his hands. Brilliant John.
“Take my hand”.
"Yes but you're smarter."
Mycroft looked at him incredulously, which forced John to keep the eye contact. "Really, I just saw him very very drunk and brought him home. That's all."
greaser
"Look, all I want is to get a good grade!"
“No”, John said shaking his head. “No matter how good you are, you’ll never be better than Vincent Van Gogh.”
She widened her eyes and stared at her brother, looking surprised. "What? The greaser brought me here?"
John looked up with a nervous smile. He looked slightly anxious, slightly worried. Was he okay?
greaser
"Oh, Sherlock, you are so sweet."
"He was shot", he said as he stared into nothingness, his brain screaming at him that sentence over and over.
"Well, let me tell you that the boy
John didn't come again. Not once, not by mistake, not to check up on Sherlock's health, nothing. He asked nurses and other doctors about John but the replies he got were vague and simple.
John simply kept walking and climbed up the stairs.
"I just-", John argued.
Sherlock looked up to find a tall, skinny, girl, with her green eyes fixed on him. "Obviously." He said expressionless.
John stared at him, mouth hanging open. “I-I…”
"What are you doing here?", John whispered, his eyes widened.
“I love you, John”, Sherlock repeated.
something he would do.
"Oh, John, did you at least tried to talk to him?"
John stood silent trying to think of something to say. Nothing.
“Back- back at the rooftop. He said that if I didn’t kill myself you would be killed. Then he killed himself so I wouldn’t have a way to stop him. I had no other choice, no other chance. I had to jump. I needed you to know, to keep you safe.”
John smiled and turned to look at Sherlock, who winked at him. John tried to stop the whirlwind of thoughts drowning his mind after the wink and focused on listening to the teacher. "... You've certainly progressed on the final project with this first draft, so, there's a lot of work left but if you continue down this road, you'll do very, very well."
*******
Sherlock entered the interrogation room carrying the knife and explained carefully how he had killed Alice. A detailed, precise description that Sherlock had managed to put together after talking to Melissa and deducing the guy's manners.
“How do you do it?”, Sherlock asked, his eyes wide.
John didn't want to argue, so he didn't went too far with that subject. Still he wanted to know what the woman had told Sherlock. "What did you talked about... You know... when she went into your room?" It was better to go straight to the point when talking to the detective.
"Going to therapy?" Sherlock looked at him, his green eyes fixed on his friend's. He looked surprised, he knew his fake death had obviously affected John, but he had no idea he had came back to therapy, he knew he used to take it before meeting him, but he never thought he would return, and less because of him. Sherlock felt so much guilt, he finally understood everything his friend went through during that time, and it was painful.
Sherlock was progressively losing the hope he had gained a few moments ago. "Please, John. Just let me talk to you."
And a feeling he would never put into words. Words never would be enough.
Irene smiled calmly. "Look, Sherlock, you would have to be two things to deny the possibility of being with me: either an idiot or gay. I know you are not an idiot. Certainly not an idiot. So there's only one left."
John caressed the outskirts of the scar, touching incredibly softly, like only a skilled and careful doctor would do. The skin around was sensitive but it didn't hurt, for John knew how to apply the perfect amount of pressure. Sherlock closed his eyes and John stared fixedly at the wound.
Sherlock looked up and stared at John in utter and complete surprise. John pointed at the player once again, "that's-", he dragged a deep breath, "that's what it said, in the tape. I. Would. Have. Gone. With. You."
He knew that there was nothing left. He had gone back to where he started.
"This one's for you, Sherlock"- Greg said handing Sherlock the gift. Sherlock read the card.
"And you brought
Before reaching the door, he took a deep breath and felt very nervous. He thought of something to say, but couldn't come up with anything. He opened the door. Sherlock was smoking anxiously. Sucking, sucking, sucking, that one cigarette finished incredibly fast and he pulled out another...okay John needed to talk to him right now.
John smiled but then covered his smile because he was supposed to be mad at Sherlock. "Sherlock..." He said, trying to come up with something to say, but the greaser interrupted him.
Sherlock's brain stopped. Sherlock's heart too.
Sherlock was human. Probably a drug addict? Probably sad and lonely? Who knew? John certainly didn’t.
Sherlock started pacing across the office, his hands below his chin. He didn't say hello, nor bothered to tell his thoughts to Lestrade. Everything fell silent in the room. Lestrade shifted his weight from one foot to the other, clearly filled with impatience.
"Because it wasn't important John!", Sherlock didn't look surprised, but did look annoyed, as if he was expecting more from John, more understanding, a bit of help, an advise, something, anything but a fight.
"Coffee?"
"Please tell me you'll leave it as soon as the wound has healed."
"You better do, Watson" Sherlock said, standing up.
Sherlock shook his head, still not daring to look into John Watson’s eyes. “Ever since that first night, or at some point after that. I don’t know. I just knew it before I jumped”, he said, his voice breaking at the last word.
That was the first thing that came into John's mind as he looked around. Why was there so much yellow?
you want but leave
He remembered his eyes closing while his mind decided that it was too tired to keep thinking. After that, a string of dreams appeared, over and over, as he remembered everything that John didn't. Then he felt a couple of arms picking him up, but he couldn't tell whether it was dream or reality, everything was a blur.
Sherlock frowned and turned to look at Mycroft, who was smirking. "Congratulations, Sherlock. You found a
Sherlock didn't lowered his voice tone. "I'M BORED!" He said moving the hands in the air.
Sherlock felt relief spreading all through his body. He smiled weakly at John, allowing the tears to fall down his face, just a little bit.
"Thank you! Now, where were we?"
"Thank you, Sherlock, did you pick this?"
"In behalf of my...friends. About what happened yesterday."
John felt a knot down his throat. He tried to swallow it down and smiled bitterly. "Leave it, Watson. Leave it." He told himself.
Greg shrugged. “Sure mate. Now, did you mention something about a cigarette?”
John looked at him in disbelief. “Fuck! Do you want to kill yourself or what, Sherlock?”
"Oh." John said with a frown.
He pointed at himself. "Me?"
When they finally reached upstairs, John guided Sherlock to one of the chairs at the kitchen table. “Stay here, I’ll get you some paracetamol”, John said.
John bit his bottom lip and looked at Sherlock for a while before nodding slowly. “-Fine.”
“Good nose job, too.”
"Thank you." Lestrade said, sounding a bit relieved.
"Well, it's the first time he brings a friend here, so you must work
"What happened? Is everything okay?" He yelled from the second floor.
John looked at the naked silhouette that the portrait depicted. “Yes, I can see that”, he smiled without wanting to. It looked like a wonderful drawing Sherlock was doing.
Melissa pulled out a piece of paper and started to read. “I don't know how I'm meant to be writing this. I'm not a writer.”
It was a feeling that stopped as soon as he saw that madman staring fixedly at the picture Mike had taken. That madman who looked at him and knew it all, as if he’d known him all his life and was waiting for the exact second so he’d be able to introduce himself into his world.
They would meet again, of course.
"You are alive."
Sherlock
"I was away." Sherlock said avoiding the eye contact with his brother.
But he couldn’t save him anymore and John wasn’t strong enough to save himself, so Lacuna was saving him. And that was fine. It was all fine.
HiSarah.
"Jesus, Sherlock...yes", John said out of breath and Sherlock kept stroking, establishing a rhythm between them, he could tell John liked it.
John tried to stay as calm as possible. He sat straight too. "Sherlock, I just want to get to know you better!"
Lestrade looked uncertain of what to do.
Harry frowned, but kept smiling. "Fine, you can take booze out of me, doesn't make it less obvious."
"Because... Because... Because you need your space. And it's fine. Don't worry, I'll keep staying on the couch."
“Perhaps.”
*******
"I- yes."
in every single possible way, it was so,
Sherlock shook his head. "I'm not. I'm just bringing a friend to buy some things and enjoy a gig. What's awkward about it?"
, which was one of John's favorite books, but he realized it was better to keep the conversation short and go straight to the point, so it wouldn't end up in a fight or something like that, which certainly, without a single doubt, John would lose.
Sherlock remained expressionless. "I told you to stay in the car", he said slowly, trying not to burst in anger.
"A... You know... Murder."
And he waited.
Sherlock had slowly walked towards him and heard him perfectly. “What was what?”, he whispered.
"So, you want me to pretend to be your Girlfriend?" Irene said, and Sherlock looked at her immediately.
John couldn’t help but smile at the sight of Sherlock Holmes.
"I don't." Sherlock said stopping and looking at both Sebastian and Greg who threw him an amused gaze.
! If I'm your best friend then tell me what is going on!"
. He didn't look at him, he didn't have his feet on his chair and, during the rest of the class, he didn't disturb him at all, which was the most surprising bit.
He couldn’t explain what was that he felt, he couldn’t put a name into what it was, what they were, he simply couldn’t explain it. It just was. They just were.
Sherlock couldn't breathe, but for completely different reasons.
“Mr Holmes!, please don’t tell me you-”, she started.
"Why are you doing this, Sherlock?" Greg said seriously.
"That won't work", Sherlock said stubbornly, turning towards the living room and hanging his coat and scarf.
Sherlock nodded. "You didn't like it."
Sherlock was hypnotized by John’s words, by John’s voice, by John’s closeness. He could feel John’s passion as he spoke, he could feel it radiating, permeating into himself. He had never seen it that way, he still thought the painting wasn’t good enough because it lacked technique and precision, but it was filled with the same passion of John’s voice, with the same kind of emotion. He smiled.
were nothing but a distant nightmare.
Melissa looked up as she saw Sherlock approaching. She had just hung up the phone and was wearing a smile on her face, which vanished as soon as he faced him. Sherlock softly smiled at her as a salute.
“Yes.”
He just ignored her and closed himself in his mind palace.
Sherlock laughed, "I'll leave it to your deductions."
"The work is for Thursday... You are exhausted..." John said, eyes still closed, still mumbling.
"...yes."
He hadn’t ever lived anything remotely like this feeling before. This was completely new. Sometimes he just sat and stared into nothingness, remembering, and he felt he was going to collapse piece by piece.
"Dear lord, what is it now Mycroft?"
"John.
So alcohol was the explanation.
He wasn’t good enough. He knew that much.
He must have seen it coming.
"Who says I'm leaving?"
John was pulling at Sherlock's hair now, desperately.
The first time Sherlock saw John Watson again, the vision was so overwhelming the detective had to stop for a second and take a deep breath, focusing all of his senses into the man standing across the street. Only in that precise instant Sherlock felt back at home, and did he miss that home.
were the one who started with all of this! So don't blame on me!"
John muttered something in surprise, but kissed him back, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's nape and tangling his fingers through Sherlock's curls. Their mouths opened to each other.
John wondered without opening his mouth because he was scared he might end up making a fool of himself.
“Doesn’t mean you should stop being fond of them.”
“Um, hi.”
"...No." John said shaking away the idea from his head. "No, Sherlock, you are drunk and your brother must be upset and I'm doing what it's right and I'm leaving you here."
He used to wonder if there was something wrong with him. He used to wonder at which moment everything seemed to go downhill, not in his career, but in himself.
John remained silent.
"How can you be so sure about it?", John narrowed his eyes.
"Yes."
all of the files."
"Fine, fine. I want you to move in with me!", he almost said in exasperation.
Sherlock moved his hand in the air. "No, she is used to that."
"Because you like biology. You are interested in becoming a doctor and here we have two corpses who might serve perfectly for your purposes." Sherlock replied naturally.
Sherlock stood up. "Sorry, it's just... the tremor, you should take a look at that." He said, pointing at John's left hand.
A mental image invaded his Mind Palace.
He had Sherlock’s number but didn’t feel capable of calling him nor texting him. He didn’t know what to say, how to say it.
It wasn't his fault. I don't want him to anchor himself on the past either. I don't blame him, how could I?
"Is he alright?"
John laughed, leaning his head against the wall and closing his eyes. Sherlock stared at him in wonder, and smiled even wider at the sight.
Melissa leaned a bit closer towards him and said angrily: "How could've you done that to him? How couldn't you tell him you were alive? I didn't want to believe what the news were saying because I thought you would never leave without letting Dr. Watson know where you were heading. You are an idiot!"
Sherlock got out of the bathroom buttoning his shirt. He had been expecting John to be still asleep when he left but apparently that was asking for too much. "Yes?"
me!" Sherlock said defensively.
"Yes, dear?" His mother replied from the kitchen.
Sherlock’s hands closed into fists. “This is between you and me, Melissa. Leave him alone. Let him go.”
John’s heart raced in a way he could only explain as a pre-heart stroke, which wasn’t a very common thing among people his age, but not something that was unheard of. 32 was a very risky age, after all. He swallowed and told himself to stop being stupid and immature. He was 32 after all.
And the world around him collapsed. Or built itself together. He couldn't tell.
"Thank you. Thank you", he whispered.
"Are you sure you're staying?" John turned to look at Sherlock, who was unfocused, but returned his attention to him.
"Mycroft..." Sherlock repeated, his voice hiding a threat.
There were so many things that Sherlock could have said, so many things that he could have asked, but he couldn't find the strength to do it, not without probably saying
"I couldn't bring myself to do it", Sherlock said with honesty.
“I- No. It’s. It’s good. Appropriate.”
Sherlock
"I'm sorry doctor, but we can't let him do such thing!"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, this time he did look slightly annoyed. “I said I’ve never heard of him.”
"Do I?"
More than fine, actually. Sherlock did not expect anything more.
John had fallen asleep half an hour ago. The process was just beginning. Hawthorne had checked on vital signs, connected the wires and Melissa hit ‘enter’ a bit reluctantly. John didn’t say a single word before falling asleep. Hawthorne wished him luck and gave him the sleeping pill. Melissa took a last glance at John and could have sworn he was having second thoughts about this, but he didn't retreat. He looked bitter, yet he still managed to seem determined, and that was what determined her to press ‘enter’.
If Sherlock could describe with one word exactly what he felt it would be terror. Utter, intense panic spreading all over him. A voice in his mind repeating
"I don't see a reason to refer to you, my work partner, as just Sherlock. I think it's better to stick with Holmes"
"When did you first go to rehab?" John asked, his voice just a bit louder than a whisper. His tone was soft and tender as if afraid Sherlock would just retreat and run away in any second.
Well, John wasn't expecting that. "I...
"Look at that! Not even
“Tell me about your morning.”
Sherlock lifted and eyebrow and turned to look at John, who avoided eye contact with the greaser at all costs. "Oh! Has He?"
"Mr Watson and Mr Holmes. Interesting pair. Let me see your work." Mr Hikes said, holding a pen in his hand and looking defiantly at John, who was shaking.
"...I met Victor Trevor when I was thirteen."
“Yes, you are.”
I'm sorry
He blinked.
The name sounded familiar. Perhaps whispered in the artists’ circles, in the most exclusive, selective places he'd been in. He'd surely heard his name before.
Anthea was smart and intuitive as well. She knew exactly who John was trying to delete too.
"Because he knows this isn't a good sign, Sherlock!, her being back! It can't be something good! It simply can't! You better stay away from her!"
John shook his head. "I can't make myself believe in you."
One more chapter and an epilogue to go. Thank you so, so much for reading, I hope you enjoy these final chapters! <3
But with John Watson...if that's what John Watson wanted, he'd do it. He'd give up on them, if John asked him to.
"NO!", he screamed.
“You’ve been painting”, John said as he walked towards them and inspected them closely. They were beautiful. Incomplete and far too…academic for John’s liking but they showed all the genius inside of Sherlock.
And for once, he willingly embraced the darkness.
He stopped a cab with a shalking hand, and as it went to Scotland Yard, he looked at the last messages he had received. They were from John.
Sherlock opened the door, John was holding a glass of wine in his hand, he looked at Sherlock, Sherlock didn't look him back, he just stared at the window, speechless. "So, she's back".
"I am NOT going to Chemistry Club!" He said rising his voice.
"Sorry, the door was open. Good afternoon, Dr. Watson. Nice to see you again."
“Do you realize you do that?”
Sherlock grimaced without even intending to. Where had John taken that from? What was he doing at three in the morning asking him if they had been a couple? What was all of that? “What?”
"You'll find nothing." Sherlock said seriously.
"Look, I'm sorry, but I did it for your own sake, Sherlock. I meant what I said, you need to focus on defeating Moriarty, and she was distracting you." Sherlock didn't say anything. He just frowned and went to his room, shutting the door closed noisily.
"You can't promise that!"
"I just...I have to get sober, I have to recover, and I'll do it for her. And I will, I promise."
Melissa raised her hand, silently asking both of them to shut up. "Mr. Holmes, Detective Inspector, Alice is dead."
Sure, right, the explanation.
"I don't think that's actually his fault, I think you left this very very clear for him in the exact moment you started to play the back seat bingo with Irene Adler! So don't come to talk to me as if you were the victim! You have been a huge asshole Sherlock!"
*******
And that’s exactly what John would do.
Lestrade was holding a giantic cup of coffee which was indication of the detective's current mood. As Sherlock walked in, he rubbed his forehead.
John nodded courtly with a smile on his face, then he turned to look at Sherlock again, noticing he hadn’t looked up in all this time and frowned. Fucking hell, if he didn’t want to see the project he wasn’t going to insist. He exhaled loudly and put the paper on his bag. Sherlock was still scribbling, still not looking up.
His mother looked unamused. "Yes."
John kissed Sherlock's finger delicately, with almost the same devotion Sherlock had examined the wrinkles in his lips. It was a moment charged with passion, with innuendo, but with another thing Sherlock couldn't put a name to, because he had never lived it before.
later.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “I tried to paint it.”
This was certainly a bad idea. He should get away from John.
Sherlock walked towards his room and found John smiling at him through half-lidded eyes. "Hey", John said with a smile.
Sherlock had forgotten he had notifications for John Watson's blog. What was the point in remembering it anyway?
John smiled. Sherlock smiled back and bit his lip. God, what was wrong with him? Why was he acting like an ordinary fifteen-year-old boy?
After a while, John sighed and closed the book, burying his face in his hands.
The greaser took a deep breath, closing his eyes. “I need a fucking cigarette.”
"So, we did good..."
"Oh, but I
"Idea? Of what?"
Her mom turned to look at the car, "...you arrived a long time ago and didn't enter the house. It wasn't hard to figure out where you were, but it was worrying finding out."
“Sir.” Anthea came in running towards Mycroft’s office.
"I'm sorry", he whispered, almost inaudibly.
"You know, I do believe we can't always erase something completely off our memory. There will remain ashes, little paths, something to bring us back that memory we've lost. And I'm certain that deep, deep inside, Dr. Watson hasn't forgotten a single one of the memories you built together. We just hid them, but they'll find a way out, somehow, someday."
He didn't say anything else on the subject.
She shut her mouth and looked down, embarrassed. Sherlock felt bad for her. Actually, he felt worse for feeling bad for her. "...yes, I like chemistry."
What? Which games? He never said he was up to play with her again. Not again. He had won the last one, he wasn't risking to lose this time.
As soon as they arrived to the flat, John breathed hard. He turned to look at Sherlock. "Could you explain to me what the
John looked at his hand and clenched it. “It’s not easy.”
They hadn't left it like that.
"No, it's okay, I can handle it by myself."
Then the patrol turned into the street which had became the place of the crime scene. Sherlock gasped. John lived down that street.
------------------
This was a bit not good.
"You too,
"Orders from above, brother dear. I'm only doing my job"
“I already did.”
"Don't worry bird, my lips are sealed" she said leaning closer to him.
“Remember that time I drew a hand?”, John asked.
“There was a moment when I felt all the strength leaving my body, all the energy giving up, and I just let it happen, but then it didn’t. It never came. And I still wonder why it didn’t. Before- just before that, I saw you”, he said, refusing to meet John’s eyes. “And I said I was sorry I wasn’t going to make it, I’d never see you again.”
John cleared his throat and looked away. “What about the blog?”, he asked.
Sherlock took the sketch and entered to the car. The driver's seat. It had been so long. He touched the steering wheel slowly, feeling it, enjoying the moment. He turned on the car, and felt so excited, yet so terrified. What if it happened again? What if he caused any harm to Harry? What would he tell John? He shook the thought away and pulled off the accelerator. And the car started moving.
“I always pictured it different”, was all John said. He didn’t look angry, not at all, actually he was smiling, not the angry smile he had mastered, but a melancholic smile, a smile that longed to remember and was doomed to regret.
Sherlock shrugged. "I don't know. What I do know is that he does not remember me."
Sherlock leaned closer, his lips ghosted over John's neck. "Thank
He came back to reality a second later, already feeling himself growing addicted to that sensation. Heroin had never felt like this. Never.
John barely opened his eyes. He mumbled something that Harry didn't understand and closed them again. "JOHN! FOR GOD'S SAKE WAKE UP!"
“Yes. Yes. Yes”, John replied.
*******
"You're okay", he said once again, before his eyes drew closed.
John didn't reply.
"Not good."
John finally let go.
"You are the proof of that aren't you?"
idea?"
Sherlock shrugged. “I see nothing but too many colors that look very similar, mixed together in horizontal stripes”.
"Look, I just want to forget everything about John Watson. In this place you do that, then attend my request and delete him from my mind!"
Sherlock frowned as he stepped over his finished cigarette. Nice choice of...
"Maybe he is not the one who is crazy." Mycroft said lifting his eyebrow.
He took his pencil, opened the pad, closed his eyes and imagined Sherlock’s hands. And allowed his hand to move, just like Sherlock’s had done twenty four hours before.
"Fine! Fine!"
Sherlock smiled compliantly. "I saw your face brighten up when I called you a doctor. You
“Isabella Dorman. Actress. 27 years. Was filming a movie in London, had dinner with her colleagues, stood until late at night with them, and came back to the hotel. She was stabbed repeatedly. She arrived alone to her room.”
"Oh!" Molly's face lightened. "Good! I'm sorry I saw it in other way."
"No." John said taking Sherlock's hands off him. "Just no, Sherlock. I can't." He was afraid this was his last chance with Sherlock. He thought the greaser would turn and walk towards the door and leave forever, away from John's life.
Yeah, he was definitely going to the party.
“No.”
"He is with me." Sherlock said, without looking at the detective.
John's smile dropped. "What happened to her? Is she okay?"
"I already did all the fucking job!"
Sherlock's frown deepened but he followed Lestrade, turning to look at the stack of folders laying on the DI's desk. Lestrade was holding one of those in his hands.
Sherlock thought.
And Sherlock’s silhouette somewhere in the middle.
I’m better than all of these”, he said with disdain, as if it was an offense in itself to be place in the same category with these artists.
He took two steps towards John and kissed him back.
He stared at them. Big age difference, not much in common except for the fact they’d gotten out of painfully long relationships and
Damn it.
"What happened? Is everything okay?"
"Oh..."
"Something tells me John hasn't left yet." She said with a wink and taking Sherlock by his hand and leading him towards the parking lot.
Hawthorne nodded towards Melissa. “Melissa, please put Dr. Watson to sleep.”
"John-", Sherlock repeated breathlessly. "John, I want you."
Sherlock felt as if he had just been stabbed. He opened his mouth to reply, but didn't know what to say. "I...I-" he faltered.
John's gaze turned towards Sarah, a brunette girl with a pretty, pink lace dress and a nice hair up-do, who smiled at John and nodded, raising her eyebrows towards him. John had seen her before, she used to pick Molly up after chemistry club, but didn't see any subject with her. He smiled back, then the words settled on his mind:
arrives.
"Come on, you can't be telling me you prefer listening to this... Noise than listening to Beethoven or Bach!"
He frowned at it, and saw that it was a call from Lestrade. He hoped with all his will it would be a case that could put his mind to work.
"He will."
John nodded and walked out, wondering where the hell had all those thoughts come from. How had he allowed that?
John was dying to ask him what the message said, but anything it may had said was going to make things worse. He was angry, she always got in the way. What now? He is going to see her again? Celebrate that she is back? Have dinner? Shit, he knew what having dinner meant, but did Sherlock even know? He turned and looked at the detective, still checking his phone, silent. Definitely, he was in love with her. But John felt something different, something had changed with that conversation they just had, he felt a sudden determination.
Sherlock turned and took a frankly outstanding amount of magazines out of his bag, putting them on John's desk.
They broke apart instantly and John took a deep breath. He nudged Sherlock. "We should really go before she opens the door." He said with a smile.
Sherlock stared at him silently for a moment before replying, “no pleasure when I’m
Sherlock sighed, clearly he was getting annoyed with so many questions, but John
somebody. At least for you."
And yet, he did.
He hadn't seen Sherlock in drugs a single time after he met John. And
Sherlock frowned. "Yes, I remembered."
"See? We could be civilized!"
He sighed and collapsed against the pillows. It was only logical, now that he thought about it. Of course John would want to spare himself from awkward talks and morning kisses, it was fine.
"Sherlock! Mycroft made sure it was her! He said it only took you to fool him!"
Sherlock stopped himself. He was hurting John. He couldn’t. He couldn’t play her game.
Sherlock flinched. “It doesn’t work, Victor. It will just make you feel more miserable. It. Never. Works!”
"It's just... I'm not like that." Sherlock cleared his throat. "Well, at least not in front of people. But with you... It feels...
Silence fell between the two of them. They looked around the empty hall, but they didn't look at each other, John because he didn't want to see the moment Sherlock would burst into laughter and say it was all a joke, because
John realised it was already time to go looking for lunch, but he really didn't feel like it. His head was still killing him after taking two pills. What he really needed was a coffee, to leave the hangover behind.
He took the plastic bag out. Two blues, one purple, one white, one yellow.
Sherlock heard John’s intake of breath. It was shaky.
------------------
“But…I stop feeling and that’s better than feeling anything at all.”
"It's okay for me, not sure if it's okay with John."
Sherlock hid the folder inside his Belstaff and walked away. Whoever it was couldn’t have access to John’s file. Sherlock would make sure of it. He’d keep that file locked in the depths of hell if he had to, if it meant keeping John safe.
The greasers' table was as full as usual, but people seemed pleased of seeing Sherlock there. Jim didn't make any comment on it, but kept talking and talking and talking, trying to catch Sherlock's attention while the greaser listened to him absentmindedly, barely nodding and fighting against the sensation to roll his eyes.
Sarah was sitting on the waiting area when Sherlock walked into the ER. He frowned, thoughtful. Were John and her together again? Unlikely. Probably they were still working together. How awkward.
“Was it-?”, he asked before he even realized, he bit his tongue as soon as he did. Stupid.
"You can go now. But you better work the next time I put an activity in couples. Understood?"
And in that moment, the old man arrived to class, two minutes late, which was very weird coming from him. John sat immediately and, surprisingly, Sherlock didn't bother him at all. Now they had to do that damn job and they were going to do it so good the rest of the work pairs would be jealous of them.
The problem, he thought, was that no matter how hard he tried, whenever John was concerned, he simply couldn't focus. There was no way he couldn't avoid considering John a victim, relating anything and everything he saw and heard about the case to John, he couldn't stop thinking about the danger John had put himself into because of him.
He had been discharged minutes later, and he couldn't look at John one last time to make sure that he was aware of their unspoken promise. It had been 72 hours since then.
Moran. John said, biting his lip. His sister was behind him, laughing, half-asleep.
about
updated.
"Oh no no no, don't worry, I don't want to ruin the family plan."
Sherlock raised his other hand and slowly, softly touched the back of John’s hand.
John leaned closer to shake her hand and looked at Mrs Hudson as he pointed at Sherlock. "And we are
He closed his eyes and remembered that portrait of the bird he had seen the day he decided to be an artist. Trapped inside a pump. How very telling. Sherlock looked through his window and felt just the same, looking at the rest of the universe from his own personal jail, unable to grasp it all, unable to understand it all.
John shook his head, and he looked distant, as if he was immersed in thoughts, in a world Sherlock couldn't follow him to, no matter how much he wanted to. "I-", John sighed. "I can't, Sherlock. I can't do this anymore. I can't listen to you. Please just stop talking and- stay away from me. Please"
"Y- yes. Yes, I'm fine."
Harry Watson?"
The greaser walked in few minutes later and John just stared into the notebook as if the world’s fate depended on it. He could tell from the corner of his eye by the way Sherlock walked, he was even more exhausted than John.
"Then whose fault was it?"
Sherlock went into the bathroom and John took his pjs and started putting them on when he threw Sherlock's coat off the bed. He bent down to pick it, and he found a piece of paper on the floor. He picked it up. He read it:
John grabbed the brush from Sherlock’s hands, their fingers meeting each other for the shortest of seconds.
"No, but I want to. Come on, I promise you it will be fun!" Sherlock said grabbing John's hand and taking him into the record store.
John dragged a deep breath. “You should have said it”. He looked up, “you should have.”
"Where are we going? Damn it! I knew you would do something like this!"
Although it did lose its appeal when he took the Sherlock element out of it.
They had all been stabbed. Which was honestly an ineffective way to die. So this killer, whoever it was, had psychopathic tendencies, for they enjoyed the pain, enjoyed the suffering and enjoyed seeing a slower death than if they were killed at gunpoint.
John smiled looking at his mom. "I'll drive mom."
But he was good with colors.
"So there's your reason."
Harry smiled compliantly. "You are ruining the family plan, Sherlock!"
He passed by his locker to get his books out of it, while everybody was moving across the hallway. He took them out with a sigh and closed the locker, he turned and tried to react but it was too late, Sebastian was approaching him and pushed him strongly towards the lockers and first thing John felt was his freaking shoulder hitting against the metal and the pain came as the greaser passed by. The books fell to the floor strenuously. "Watch your step, Nerd!" Sebastian said between laughs. Jim walked right behind him, having a laugh.
"Is what, Watson?"
"Yes." -John's voice sounded sad, he tried to hide it but he certainly couldn't.
"Moran knows and he'll tell Moriarty and the whole school will know. It doesn't make sense. A greaser never helps a...", he hesitated.
Neither of them blinked.
"He's not." Sherlock said looking completely convinced.
John kept looking at Sherlock, surprise drawn in his face. "Sherlock, Scotland Yard couldn't solve them-"
“I’ll see you later”, John said tenderly as he stood up.
John finally looked up to meet his eyes. He kept his expression neutral, but his eyes betrayed him. He walked towards Sherlock slowly, painfully slowly.
Greg greeted them without smiling, he looked worried, something was wrong. He looked at the detective very seriously. "Sherlock, we have another one."
"Where to?", Lestrade asked as Sherlock gave the cabbie an address he hadn't heard before.
For someone who didn’t deserve it.
John frowned. “What?”, he asked.
John stood up and sat right behind Sherlock. Then he reached out and traced the path of the scars in his back, softly, gently. Sherlock dragged a deep breath and leaned into the touch. John replaced his fingers with his lips and kissed the skin that had stitched together after the whips, a touch that could only be compared with that of a feather. There was so much love behind John's touch.
"I didn't say that!"
“John…”
"John, it's not your fault."
whether
Sherlock smiled while he shook his jacket, "I refuse to do that as much as I refuse to let you go."
"I'll come back tomorrow, okay? Have some food, you need to recover the energy you've lost." Sarah said, saying goodbye to John and waving a hand at Sherlock and Greg before leaving the door closed.
John looked down again. "Yeah... Well. Things have changed."
have a point.
He leaned back and stared at it. He smiled softly at the color of the skin, it really reminded him of John, and although the shape was a bit flattering, it was as if John’s essence had somehow spread all over the painting. It brought a kind of magic and a kind of life Sherlock hadn’t seen before in his own works.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at the simplicity of the whole case and sighed. Scotland Yard had really gotten sloppier. It seemed impossible but, well, it was true.
Now he didn’t know how long had it been since he last saw John, and that was the only thing he really regretted.
. It's not much, I know, but there's no one else I would ever trust enough to tell all my life to. Yet you've always been the exception to the rule, haven't you? The unexpected, the intriguing. The most incredible human being that I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.
the body!"
Lestrade nodded slowly, as he tried to remember the details of it. "A case. About a year ago. Murder. Unsolved."
"Goodbye Mrs Hudson" Sherlock said closing the door.
John threw his plate of fruit to the ground in rage. The china shattered in little, little pieces.
*******
"You better don't, Watson." Sherlock said with that threatening tone again, which sent a shiver all over John's body. As if it really meant he better didn't.
Half an hour had passed since John and Harry left. Sherlock was sitting on his chair, thinking that he hadn't been alone in the apartment since he came back from death. He hated to admit it, but he missed John and despised the feeling of loneliness he used to treasure long time ago. How was that even possible? What had changed so much? What did John change?
“STOP!”, John finally snapped. He turned his back towards Sherlock and stood up. Sherlock looked up and saw John’s shoulders trembling.
This painting was a challenge. A mental puzzle.
Now he was curious.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at his brother, clearly trying to deduce something from him, but Mycroft knew better than that so the detective found nothing. "Oh," he said while the initial shock passed. He straightened his back. "So?"
startled
John didn't want to know what that meant, except he did. He went upstairs.
He woke up to find the chair John had dragged to his bedroom to keep an eye on him empty.
Damn. She had a point. But the woman was the woman. She was addicted to danger too, she was a little crazy too.
care. Happy?" As soon as he said it, he turned towards the window and took his violin again.
John groaned.
She frowned. "About John?"
But this expression. This expression he would have recognised it everywhere.
John softly caressed Sherlock's forearms and the warmth seeping through those perfect hands was enough to calm him down completely.
Well, that was until the nightmares started.
"Sherlock?" John said, but the greaser just stared at him, silent. "Do you?" The boy hesitated.
John nodded slowly. Actually, he wasn’t. He had had panic attacks before, as soon as he’d come back from the war, but he hadn’t had one since Sherlock arrived to his life, and certainly none of them had been as intense as this one. He was not better, he was worried.
Sherlock got defensive. "What's that supposed to mean? She is my girlfriend!" The words felt weird coming from Sherlock's mouth.
“No”, John replied.
while
Breaking into the apartment was far too easy. This man was leaving for three weeks and didn't even bother about properly securing his house? What was up with the criminal classes these days?
John smiled into the kiss and pressed his lips harder against Sherlock’s, who could only respond in eager before opening his mouth and deepening their kiss. While John’s brain had collapsed for a moment, the first thought that crept into his mind as soon as it decided to wake up was that nothing, ever, had felt the way
"John?"
"I did, I did, I just don't... Understand. Can you explain it to me?"
History was his first class and that didn't help because he really didn't want to see Sherlock's face and now they had to work together and he was an idiot and John didn't know what to do anymore. Before entering to the classroom, he took a deep breath and prepared himself to face the boy. Yet, to his surprise, the Greaser ignored him completely,
"We don't know too much-" answered the man, taking a hand to his head, clearly worried of the situation. "So far, all we know is that about twenty minutes ago, eight gunshots were heard and the result was two people dead inside their house."
John held Sherlock’s hand,
John took a step back, trying to increase the distance between them, trying to get as far as possible, Sherlock stopped looking at John and looked down. "I'm sorry, did I scare you?"
"Careful, Jim." He said seriously.
greaser
The name sounded familiar to Mycroft, but he couldn’t quite figure out what it was. “Lacuna?”
John followed him until Molly stopped him. "John, why is Sherlock's phone doing that noise?"
He walked towards it while Sherlock simply stared at his own painting.
Sherlock handed it to him, John used it to draw the eyelashes at the forefront.
Still, not looking up, Sherlock answered. "You'd be surprised." "Really?" John said confused.
Sherlock nodded.
"There's just you and me in here." Sherlock said with a
Which made the whole moment twice as uncomfortable for John.
"Then tell me what I can do, please."
Sherlock remained speechless. Breathless. Air was so overrated. The world was turning, turning too hard, too fast, and John wanted him.
"Time to go home!" John said pointing with his head towards the door and smiling
“Is that-?”, John asked as he stared fixedly at the painting Sherlock had finished recently. The one with their hands joined together.
Sherlock took a deep breath, he looked into John's eyes. "Well, you'll have to, Watson. Now if you excuse me, I have a crime to solve." He said turning towards the door.
"I mean it." Sherlock said extremely confident with himself.
“I don’t know, Sherlock.”
A voice brought him back. John was wrinkling his brow and pointing at him. "Is
John held him through it all. All of it.
Sherlock dismissed it. "I couldn't care less about
"Sherlock!"
Melissa was still talking. Something about why she had murdered all the other people but he didn’t care. He had deduced it hours ago, on his way to Battersea. It was only obvious now that he thought about it.
“Oh, I think you know
She looked surprised and perhaps a little scared. Sherlock resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "Is everything okay?", she asked.
"...and you're not seeing him again."
"John..." Sherlock pleaded.
"What?" John asked quizzically.
"Can I sit?"
"I would find that exciting." John shrugged.
*******
Sherlock couldn’t turn to look at John, he focused on the painting and stared at it, taking in every single detail, it was beautiful.
"Not much I can do anymore, is there?"
He only came up with one question, "why are you doing this?", John asked terrified, his voice low and soft.
John narrowed his eyes. "Sherlock, I saw this body and I'm shaking and I feel incapable of keeping my eyes on it and I feel like I might throw up. I can't. I could never be a doctor." He said with a tone of disappointment.
John finally turned to look at him. “I want to improve it.”
"Simple balance of probabilities", Lestrade replied.
That day I met a man, his name was Sherlock Holmes. The name sounded oddly familiar, and he knew my name too, which was odd, but I thought I would remember someone like Sherlock Holmes.
Not two seconds after setting his duffel down on his footlocker he was suddenly thrust forward face first on his cot with two heavy bodies on top of him.
“Watson and Sholto showed up together.”
“John?”
Bill just continued to stare until Major Watson clapped him on the back with a grin, sending him off balance momentarily, “Yeah, Murray, poker!”
Just wanted to throw out a quickie for those of you still with me. Stick around and I'll have another chapter up soon!
The thought of taking solace in his violin flitted through his mind until he remembered that he no longer had anyone to play for, and wouldn’t for six months. A sixteen month old couldn’t quite appreciate the stringed instrument as his John could.
And if you're thinking about Backstreet Boys' "The Call"... then you'd be correct!
“Exactly.”
Murray glared at Jamie briefly, “You do realize we’re exhausted after ten hours and four surgeries?”
to go back?” All the while his brain was running through several scenarios to keep the doctor home and not off in the desert. At Rosie’s frustrated wiggles in his lap, he set the toddler on the ground to run free; it was best she wasn’t in the middle.
They were silent a moment, the empty room suddenly this with tension. Before he could really register his own actions, John pulled the other man down into a heated kiss reminiscent of that day years ago when John had left for that patrol that ended his career - or so he thought.
Thank you to everyone who is still with me :)
He wouldn’t cry. He was William Sherlock Scott Holmes. Caring is not an advantage and it seemed it never would be.
“Okay, now you’re just spouting facts, get on with it!” Bill was too annoyed with this conversation before he’d even downed his first cup of coffee.
"So how's -" An alarm and the sounds of heavy booted feet running outside the tent cut off Jamie's sentence.
Turning, John felt his first genuine smile in two weeks spread as he faced his longtime friend, "It's major now."
want to go back.”
The two soon put the Watson/Sholto conundrum out of their head as action around base picked up. Jones out on patrols and Murray getting personal with the onsite hospital. Except fir the occasional quick chat as they passed, neither enlisted men had spotted the majors together outside of mess. Maybe they were just paranoid for their friend being back at war.
Bill narrowed his eyes, “Not actually married, but he
Sherlock couldn’t believe what he was hearing. They was going to lose this man, the man he loved for so long and from afar, to the military again and there was nothing anyone could do about it. Even fatherhood couldn’t seem to hold him back.
Automatically making a second cup of tea and a sippy cup, John brought them into the sitting room where he placed both cups beside their respective chairs, the sippy cup next to the brunet’s as he was still holding the toddler. “Sherlock, please sit down.”
"Now now, sergeant, haven't you heard? Major Watson here is a family man with a little girl and a gorgeous husband." And that was definitely the voice of his former - current - head nurse, Bill Murray.
John speaking brought him out of his chaotic thoughts, “There’s nothing Mycroft can do. This isn’t his division… and I’m not entirely sure I
“John, what was – “
Coming out of his mind palace, Sherlock swore he had heard John on the stairs. Getting up from his chair, he quickly crossed the room, Rosie in his arms, and opened the door to the landing. He had been correct. There stood John, frozen on the staircase holding a letter and a look of shock on his face.
Maj. John H. Watson, RAMC
Another 14 hours later.

“Yes. No. I don’t know. Look, Sherlock, this isn’t something I have a choice in. They’re calling me back into the army. All this publicity must have drawn their attention. I’m needed there.” He wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince, Sherlock or himself.
“Hey, Murray,” Sergeant Jones nudged his friend with his elbow while in the breakfast line at mess.
If he could get one life back, maybe he could get the other as well... but could he keep them separate?
The sergeant nodded in return, waving the two off as he headed towards his own bunk in the barracks for a nap. A smile sat on the soldier's face as he caught Watson and Murray's continuous banter across the yard, "... Bill! We're not even married! I am NOT gonna do that!"
As soon as the instructor raised a hand to signal John over, Murray shoved the doctor in retaliation from previously, yelling in a childish manner, “Last one there is an RAF pilot!” He made a beeline for the chair beside Sholto leaving John to take the last seat between Jones and a private.
“Yup. And their tents are nowhere near each other. Not even a place to cross the other’s path in the morning. They don’t even had the same shift. I asked Caley in the admin building, she said-“
Bill stared at Jones for a spell before nodding in agreement. He turned his gaze back to the two officers, narrowing his eyes at the hand Sholto had placed on John’s forearm, thumb caressing the dark khakis visible even from across the room.
Inclining his head towards the opening, John glanced over at Bill, "Looks like that's our cue. Sorry Jones, later?"
“He’s married with a little girl, ain’t he?”
John’s spare set of dog tags. Sherlock immediately felt guilt because for a single moment he was glad John was gone, if only so he couldn’t see the tears beginning to overflow.
Bill slapped John on the back, "So how does it feel to be back, Major?"
“But you’re needed here!” In a rare display of true emotion, Sherlock jumped up from his chair and started pacing around the sitting room of the flat, making sure to weave around the toddler’s attempts mimicking him. John could hear him muttering under his breath as the detective put his hand on his head and into those curls that the doctor loved so much. He could almost see the stress pouring off of Sherlock as he started pulling on his own hair.
Eyes going wide, Sherlock asked, “Whatever for?”
16 hour flight. Camp Shorabak. Kandahar, Afghanistan.
The moment Bill had his butt parked in the metal folding chair he felt Major Sholto tense up for a second. Glancing toward the doctor he quickly realized why, John was giving James the sly eye and a wink. He quickly shifted his gaze to Jamie and nodded once, confirming that the infantryman was most likely correct in his observations. Bill signed, took a sip of his beer, and took the lousy hand he’d just been dealt.
When he finally sat up, he wasn't surprised to see James standing in the doorway to the weight room, dry towels in hand. At the cocked eyebrow and sly grin from the taller man, John nodded once and Sholto retreated into the locker room like a man on a mission, the sounds of a shower kicking on. John stood and stretched to release his already sore muscles and sauntered after the other officer, wiping sweat away from his face. Only two days into his return and the two majors had picked up exactly where they left off as if James hadn't almost been murdered the year before and John had never invited the other man to his doomed wedding.
“Yeah.”
Two months was all the time that passed for Bill and Jamie to become suspicious of the majors. Not only had John been spending more time with Major Sholto and in the gym, but he’d only been to the tech room twice since his second day on base. The letters beside his bed were piling up… unopened. Some bulged with what could only be a toddler’s own coloring, but unlike other fathers at the camp, John hadn’t gotten around to opening his letters from home and displaying his little girl’s artwork proudly. This wasn’t the same John Watson they’d known for over a decade.
“Okay, Jamie, I got it! Geez, just lower your voice.” He intentionally lowered his volume at the last bit in an attempt to encourage the sergeant to do the same.
At Bill’s nod, he continued, “Since he’s only here instructing, isn’t his tent over by command?”
Sherlock never considered himself sentimental, but as with all things surrounding John, things were changing. Too many to halt whether he wanted to or not. Closing the curtains, the detective turned on his heel and quickly made his way into their shared bedroom with their little girl, now only his bedroom again. The room was still dark with its own curtains still shut, they crawled into the large bed, using John’s pillow he wrapped them in the doctor’s favorite duvet, and Sherlock head in the scent of his soldier.
“Hold on, I just need to think this through for a moment.” Sergeant Jones glanced around the room briefly, eyes landing on Watson and Sholto huddled together alone at a table away from the others. “That’s Major Sholto?”
“Wha-oh shit.”
have a partner and little Rosie.” The nurse’s expression became quizzical when Jones’ brow slipped farther into a deep frown. “Where are you going with this, Jamie?”
“What, Jones? It’s too early,” Bill groaned.
“Do you
“You know Watson better than I do, right?”
“You’re late.” Taking in the full picture of his blogger, Sherlock stopped himself, hiking the little girl higher on his hip, and asked, “John, what’s the matter?”
