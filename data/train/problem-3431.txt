Anna frowns a little and begins to open her mouth to respond, but Gabriel cuts her off. “Good for you, pretty-boy! Who
Instead of calling the rental place, Cas nudges Dean into the driver’s seat with the instruction, “Let’s see you put those engineering skills to good use.”
As for Cas, well. This is payback for so many things. Least of all whatever the fuck that was with Nick before.
Jack’s gaze bounces between Dean and Cas. And it’s all kinds of sinister when their softhearted, I-can’t-tell-a-lie son says, “Then I guess you know what you have to do.”
The bathroom is on this side of double doors that separate the east wing of their dorms from the main stairs and west wing.
Cas’ fly is still open, jeans slung low on the sinful jut of his hip bones, dick tucked behind cotton again, and Dean has conflicting feelings about whether he wants to go another round or whether he just wants to get the fuck outta here.
Well. Except for now. Now he’s just annoyed. Sitting on his nice couch, drinking his nice beer, Benny’s being
Castiel spends a couple of minutes with the cat, Dean rooted to the spot the whole time, mesmerized. When Castiel stands up to leave, the cat winds itself around the dude’s shins and calves, slithering between his legs, in a pretty clear attempt to stop him from leaving.
Inside, after a quick search, they find a couple of quiet study carrels near a window and sit next to each other.
Taking the cap out of his mouth, Cas smiles at him, but it’s a close-mouthed, white-person-in-a-hurry smile, rather than the genuine, toothy ones he used to grace Dean with before the Meg incident.
“I wish I could tell you,” Cas responds, full of blue-eyed earnestness. “But I have no answers for you right now.”
Cas whips his head around like he can sense Dean’s making fun of him and Dean schools his features into something more somber, “You’re right, you did Cas. This is all happening because our first dance was to
“Why do you have this?” Jimmy asks, holding up the lighter. It had been in the back pocket of Dean’s sweats, which Jimmy, for some reason, took it upon himself to rifle through.
He continues along the line, throwing them back, one after another. He turns each miniature glass upside down in succession.
“Dean, I didn’t realize you’d be home so soon,” Cas explains, clambering to his feet and glancing at the clock on his nightstand. “Oh. It’s late.”
“Looks like we’re heading inside the cabin,” Dean mutters to Benny, leading them back around to the porch steps.
Cas doesn’t say anything. A week in the wilds isn’t exactly Dean’s idea of a good time either, but this is Garth’s choice, and he’s had a rough go of it recently, what with his marital troubles, so the least Cas could do is pretend that he actually wants to be here.
"Okay, just calm down," Charlie says. "Let's think about this logically. We need some kind of plan, because this place is huge, and we’ll never find him unless he’s lucky enough to find us. Which will be next to impossible if we’re moving around. And the chances of him waiting for us to come back like Benny did are next to nothing, right?”
And yeah, the finger quotes that Dean doesn’t need to turn around to see are adorable, are about the only thing about Cas that is cute rather than badass, and it just compounds the problem, really. This was never supposed to happen. It should’ve just been sex and nothing more, but then Dean fucked it all up.
“We weren’t the only ones who had a good night, eh?” Dean grins, twisting in his seat to look at Garth over the back of the couch.
It’s enough to allow Dean to throw himself backward, and get his hands underneath him, scrambling away.
Settling himself between the spread of Cas’ legs, Dean curls his fingers in the elastic waistband of Cas’ sweats and waits for Cas to lift up before he tugs, dragging the pants down just far enough to have Cas’ hard dick slapping up against the flat plane of his stomach, string of precome a sticky thread connecting his skin.
Dean gets a hand around the thick, satiny length of him, leaning forward to dip his tongue into the slit, tasting the bitter saltiness of Cas.
What twenty-year-old sleeps in the same bed as the friend he’s in love with but hasn’t told, ‘cause the thought of rejection is scarier than the psychopath taking photos of him and sending blood-red bouquets?
When Cas comes home, hair a mess and pressed-in-bruises beneath his eyes, Dean’s happy to be the stress relief and basks in Cas' attention on him all over again.
“And alcohol too!” Charlie grins, neatly stealing the whiskey. “Since he’s the only legal one amongst us.” And with that she’s dancing off with the alcohol, holding it high like she’s about to perform a ritual.
Cas hums. Dean feels the vibrations deep in his chest. “I have an invitation to a party, if you’d like to come with me. That might be fun.”
“Will his memories return?” Dean asks, ‘cause if not, they’ve wasted an entire could-be-sleeping-right-now cycle.
He shoves himself up into a sitting position, knuckling the sleep from his eyes. “You’re gonna have to narrow it down for me, Cas. You’ve got like a hundred of the things.” He drops his hands down between the bow of his legs, over the covers.
She tilts her head, gazing down at Castiel’s hand. Castiel looks too. She’s done a good job of painting his nails. It’s neat and tidy and admittedly, the pop of color is rather enticing.
There was an incident last year involving a pond, Claire’s brand new Ford Fiesta, and an unfortunate family of koi fish. Dean assured anyone who’d listen it would be over his dead body that Claire got another car before she turned thirty.
Dean appreciates the irony, but, "Are you nuts? Do you have any idea how long all that took me to dig up and plant? Nope, no way.”
Lack of oxygen soon becomes an issue, so reluctantly, Dean breaks the kiss and they pull apart. Dean’s attention immediately settles on the candy red of Cas’ mouth, the spit-shiny glisten of their combined saliva a gloss on his plush lips.
“Glad you asked.” Dean quickly refolds Castiel’s ticket to freedom and replaces it in his left ass pocket. Not that Castiel is watching of course. “We want to prove through the use of rapid-scan mobile observations that the traditionally regarded hypothesis of tornadogenesis is wrong.”
. Friendly enough on the surface, but with a bit of a weird undercurrent that Dean’s struggled to identify. He’s never asked either of them about it, ‘cause it’s only tiny sparks of friction here and there, rather than an ongoing feud or some shit.
“For someone who professes to hate dick, you sure are obsessed with it,” Dean says to Charlie as he hands off a scalding hot coffee to Benny.
Gods, monsters, angels, demons; Dean doesn’t know what exists, what awaits them when they die, or the next time they accidentally open a portal to another dimension.
Slowly, they climb the stairs, trying to avoid the creaks, but the boards are loose and old; there’s no chance of not making a symphony of moans and groans. Luckily, it doesn't manifest anybody wielding a machete.
Cas’ cock feels huge, the head bumping against the roof of Dean’s mouth, his soft palate, with every thrust. Cas’ thighs tremble slightly, stomach muscles clenched taut, pulled tight against the need to shove himself down Dean’s throat.
Both of them in their respective beds, Cas switches off the lamp on his nightstand, plunging the room into darkness.
Standing there in a grandiose room with oil stains on his hands that refuse to budge even with an entire bucket of sugar soap, Dean knows he’s a lot less than Cas deserves.
Castiel drags the pad of his thumb across Dean’s bottom lip. Dean opens his mouth, pink tongue curling around the whorls in Castiel’s skin. He’s sin, he’s evil, he’s dirt.
On the nightstand, next to a glass of water, is a folded piece of paper. He sits up on the edge of the bed, wincing a little with the movement, and unfolds the note.
It’s more than Dean had been wanting to pay — more than he can afford, scholarship and all — but Cas insists on picking up the slack. He’s got money saved. A severance package from his family, he calls it.
They’ve been standing out in the hallway like a couple coming back from their first date, all jittery and expectant.
It’s perverse and Dean doesn’t know why he does it; he just can’t help himself. It’s like tonguing a tooth that’s hanging by a thread of sore gum. It’s fucking compulsive.
His boy smacks the dean’s head off the wall hard enough that the tile cracks, crimson spilling into the fissures, leaving a dark smear behind.
Dean’s gonna melt listening to how he’s a revenge-fuck-turned-love-of-Cas’-life. It’s the fairytale romance every queer boy dreams about. “You old romantic, you.” He goes to turn away, partly to get this sweet-but-kinda-fucked-up moment off of him, and partly ‘cause time’s a-tickin’ and they’ve got a twin to skin and Cenobites to fool, but Cas catches him by the wrist.
“Yes,” Castiel agrees on a weary sigh. “You may be right. He came to my house earlier and gave me some lavender.”
. I believe that Bukowski once described Fante as his ‘God’, so I think that you would enjoy his writing.
Even if he can’t call, Cas usually drops Dean a quick email when he’s passing through Marrakesh or whatever. But now, it’s been all quiet on the Western Front since the voicemail Cas left ten days ago:
Dean slips inside, Bartholomew hot on his heels and ass. He’s panting lightly, puffs of vaporized alcohol ghosting over Dean’s cheek, arms around his waist, and Dean grits his teeth, bile rising in this throat. Mercifully, before Dean can lose his lunch over them both, Bartholomew detaches himself from Dean as his eyes fall on the mattress and sex toys in the corner.
Hiding in plain sight. He’s almost daring Jimmy to say something, to notice. To react. Just give Dean a reason to finally tell him everything.
Oh, dear. They’ve got maybe thirty seconds. He turns around, resting his forearm atop the passenger seat. “I’ll make you both a deal. You can have whatever you want for dinner, on me, okay? Just tell your father that I’ve gone out for some drinks with work.”
This time, Dean doesn’t bother with the whole stripping charade. He doesn’t want to be caught out by Jimmy again, so time is of the essence. As soon as Daniel is inside the attic, Dean’s got the knife in his hand hidden behind his back.
“But I have my suspicions,” she adds. Her eyes flick briefly to Cas, and her smile is apologetic. “Pretty sure it’s your friend, Meg.”
the bunch of idiots who thought that camping out in an abandoned hotel would be a good idea, so sensible doesn’t really come into it.
“Ten minutes give or take,” Cas answers, murder in his eyes, his own cell pressed to his ear, no doubt calling Gabriel to get everyone else safe.
“Everything okay, Cas?” Dean asks, feigning nonchalance he doesn’t really feel, pulling back from Cas’ face to watch him properly.
“No, that’s okay,” He flashes a quick smile as he almost bumps into a couple of scandalized Karens. “I’m sure I’ll see you both again though.”
“There!” Cas jabs his finger at one of the monitors. “He’s just gone past the main fountain.” He grabs himself an AK and shoves his pistol down the back of his jeans. “Let’s finish this once and for all.”
Except for a shifting sound that Dean can just about hear above the noise downstairs and the patter of rain outside.
Fine tremors run through Dean’s hand as he pushes the door wide. He kicks a fragment of tile in front of it, and wedges it open. Ready to make a quick escape.
“I could try and find the place where I followed Cas to. Show you that my account of events is the correct one.”
“No,” Dean says, “You’ll still be getting paid. We just need you to keep it on the down-low that you’re working for us. If any of your men get picked up by the cops, they can’t spill who they’re working for, no matter the charges.”
A couple of seconds later, Benny’s trying again, and Dean would admire his tenacity if he was even remotely interested in what Benny has to say. “I pushed him, Dean. That’s all. He was getting up in my face and I shoved him out of the way.”
Dean wishes he could say the same. But Jo was his best friend, and her death was yet another fucked-up thing in a long line of fucked-up things that happened in his junior year.
“Papers?” Dean finally says, small inflection at the end signaling that it is indeed a question and not a confirmation.
Cas is nearest to Mrs. C and he would definitely prefer to get her out of here before the shooting begins, so he steps toward Nick with the intent of distraction.
Together, they walk across campus to Charlie and Garth’s place for the final time in their sophomore year. They don’t hold hands, ‘cause Dean’s not a chick, but they do keep super close together, all up in each other’s personal space, and Dean can’t help but feel a little smug about that blond prick from last night who looked at Cas like he hung the moon.
“I hear ya,” Dean says, glaring past Cas’ shoulder at the others in the dining room. “They’re talking about us.”
Dean reaches for the jug-vase, turning it over in his hands. Behind him is silence. No more click-clack of the keys.
Dean needs to focus and not let things devolve. Which is easier said than done when all he wants to do is bury his face in the shiny-wet hollow of Cas’ throat and just breathe him in until this nightmare is over.
. But obviously not, because Dean’s married and Cas doesn’t wanna be tied down; he enjoys his freedom to come and go as he pleases far too much to even consider staying with Dean.
“I’ve never killed a god before, so looks like we’ll be each other’s firsts. Kinda romantic if you think about it.” The demon’s eyes flash onyx. “Though, by the looks of your meat suit, I won’t have to do anything other than wait you out. You’re gonna pop like a pinata. Another couple of hours, it’ll look like a slaughterhouse in here.”
The missed calls from his brother pile up, but Dean just texts back, telling him to go have fun with friends instead of Dean. What kind of sixteen-year-old wants to hang out with their older brother and his boyfriend anyways?
“I don’t think there was much you considered on your five-second journey over here to break the dude’s nose,” Dean jokes, semi-relieved that he’s managed to defuse the situation.
“Dean,” comes Cas’ voice from behind again, so Dean turns to face him, waiting to hear his suggestion. Which Dean’ll give more weight than everybody else’s ‘cause Cas has got otherworldly eyes and a talent for exploiting Dean’s weakness (which is himself and therefore cheating, if you ask Dean). “I think you should go.”
Dean takes a sip of his draft and makes wary eye contact with Charlie who nods. “Singer,” she confirms, expression grim.
Now normally, this wouldn’t be a problem. You meet your hero, you’re disappointed, you part ways never to see each other again. You cry into your pillow a bit for all the jerk off sessions you’ll have to forgo and you move the fuck on.
Jimmy’s voice is cracked around the edges when he speaks again. “I’m sorry you feel that way, Dean.”
He makes the universal sign for ‘drink’ in Cas’ vague direction, before he shoves through the bodies in the hallway, searching for the kitchen.
It’s pitch black inside the house, kinda a little musty-incensey, and all Dean can hear are the disembodied voices of the two pizza customers.
Dean doesn’t respond, keeping his eyes firmly shut, because if he can’t see Cas, then Cas can’t see him. If it’s good enough for toddlers, John Cena, and dogs, it’s good enough for Dean Winchester.
stop staring at him, at his kohl-rimmed eyes, the curve of his muscles, the shine of the black latex braces on his bare chest, clipped to the tight leather pants that accentuate the thickness of his thighs and perfect ass.
“Oh come on, you’ve got to tell me. Did your devious plan to enrapture Cassie work? Did he sweep you off your feet and then do you up against the wall? Inquiring minds want to know.”
There’s a rustle at the other end and he can hear Sam speaking to someone - presumably Benny if the muffled Southern lilt that responds is anything to go by - before he’s back, talking directly to Dean again, “Benny says he’s working for a private courier and it absolutely
Dean’s cranky AF and not just ‘cause of the lack-of-sleep-being-the-kid-of-a-serial-killer-who-has-a-copycat combo either. He can’t figure this guy — and it is a guy, Dean’s 99.9% certain of that — out. His kills lack anything personal. In fact, they give absolutely nothing away, which is not only rare as rocking horse shit, but also nigh on impossible without training and a level of professionalism that serial killers don’t often possess.
In fact, Sam’s starting to get suspicious of Dean’s eagerness to be in bed without a warm body accompanying him.
Caught up in the first proper conversation they’ve had in two weeks, Dean’s brain-to-mouth filter cuts out at just the wrong moment. “Well, what else would you rather be doing?”
Dean’s stomach swoops. He doesn’t dare tell Cas that he wouldn’t, because they both know he’d happily send Dean back to Jimmy, aching and unfulfilled, secure in the knowledge that he’d stay that way.
“Not pretty,” he corrected, licking his way to the center of the iced treat — a secret to be kept between them, dad’s friend had insisted — trying to ignore the squirmy feeling the man’s hungry stare gave him.
Cas shrugs, but the gesture isn’t quite as easy as he’d like Dean to believe. “I can think of someone.”
Dean feels as though there’s a block of concrete resting on his chest, slowly crushing the breath out of his lungs.
There’s a reason why horror tropes are a thing. They set up the expectations for the audience, giving them something to rely on. If it's a really good horror story, those expectations will be subverted without veering into the ridiculous.
Returning to Dean, Cas ducks his head, and says, “I’m sorry you had to see that.” He taps a couple of buttons on the register and it springs open. He begins counting, depositing the money in little piles.
With another to-camera sigh, Dean settles in for a long morning of fielding calls and googling ‘175 hilarious pranks to play on your asshole husband’.
Dean eyes the bottle of Listerine next to the kitchen sink. He’s already forced Cas to rinse his mouth with the blue liquid three times, like a puritanical parent whose kid has just used a bad word. Cas is just lucky that Dean didn’t stick a whole bar of soap in there, because on the list of things he never wanted to see his husband do, right up there alongside sitting on another man’s cock, was eating another man’s small intestine. Which is apparently quite chewy. Like calamari.
After a long few minutes, Dean breaks free of the trees, leaving them behind. He runs up the slope of the driveway, feet and heart pounding. Vision jarring as he reaches the top, he scans the length of the inn, its windows and porch, and doors, and then the parking lot.
Jo sticks out her hand to help Dean up. “Yeah, yeah. We all know you’re adorably pathetic. C’mon. Get up.”
What Dean means by that is, Cas has never brought anyone back to their room before. He must have liked Meg enough to trust her with the task of getting Dean to back off.
for a Bukowski/Vonnegut fan? Your last recommendation was so spot on that I figured I’d better consult the expert before I went for it.
). He’s unsupervised for the first time since the stalker shit started last semester, and he’s not entirely comfortable. Thankfully, he’s not gonna be alone for long; he’s supposed to be meeting Cas at the library, which is literally in his line of sight.
It might not have any witnesses the first time, but somehow this declaration feels more important than any that are gonna come after it. “I do.”
He’s breathing faster and harder, and Dean can tell that Castiel’s close, but then he draws back entirely, leaving Dean open and used and feeling more than a little vulnerable.
There’s a long moment where Dean’s wondering if he’s the only dumbass who doesn’t know what they have to do. There isn’t exactly a manual out there:
In all fairness, it’s kind of a high standard to live up to, so maybe, just maybe, he should cut his friends some slack and try to meet them halfway.
occasionally slow on the uptake and probably just now realizing that dragging them all to their deaths includes his.
Benny locks eyes with her — his friend for fifteen years. It could all come down to what he says next, so it’s apparent he’s choosing his words very carefully. “I didn’t
On the porch, the night black around him, he flicks his wrist and sends the water splashing down the steps and across the asphalt. He breathes deeply a couple of times, sucking the fresh air down into his lungs, holding it there, then releasing.
A year or so into their relationship they’d lain awake one night discussing how to create a rapid-scanning mobile Doppler radar in order to properly catalog individual tornado vortex signatures with the aim of finding out more in order to improve warning times. Dean’s mom had been killed by an EF5 in front of Dean and his brother Sam when they were just four years and six months old respectively. Their dad had sort of lost the plot and had decided to take up his obsessive campaign against tornadoes until he’d died when Dean was twenty-three.
Eleven minutes in and Dean gets the pin. The crowd goes nuts as the referee collapses to the mat next to them, begins the count.
They gather up their things, then trudge past the side of the car. “Where to?” Garth asks, holding a flashlight.
“Cas,” Dean breathes, wide-eyed and so in fucking love that he feels heartsick with it. Is this a dream? Or is he dead, face-down on the kitchen table, poisoned by mold, with Miracle eating his extremities in order to survive? Is this his heaven? Is this where he gets to spend all of eternity, under that blue-eyed stare? He can’t even pretend to care, ‘cause Cas is
Castiel doesn’t end up cooking breakfast for Dean and the kids, because he’s too busy eating his own. By the time Dean comes downstairs, Castiel is on his hands and knees on the grass, already nose-deep in Balthazar’s intestines. Apparently, human meat is substantially more filling than ground beef. Who knew?
Cas climbs into bed first, his back to the wall. Then, he lifts up the covers invitingly, like he’s done in so many of Dean’s fantasies, where Dean ends up fucking his fist and coming to the fevered blue of Cas’ eyes.
There were so many times when this didn’t have to be it. Cas tried to talk to him in New Orleans last year, asked Dean to meet him down at the hotel bar on their last night. Dean said yes, then chickened the fuck out, knowing what would happen if he and Cas were alone, where they’d end up.
Dean can’t contain his choked-off whimper at the vehemence in Cas’ voice, the insistence that Dean’s worth a damn.
He’s never been a talker during sex, but he can feel the words rising up now as Dean finally kicks the door shut and then gets them both fully naked on their lust-fueled stumble over to the bed.
- out of the way with the toe of his boot. There used to be a fiberglass bar along the far wall of this place, with kitschy lanterns above it. The bar has barely survived - softened into an even uglier hunk of junk - but the lanterns succumbed. The stairs leading up to the private rooms - both sets - are malformed and unusable, the entire upper floor completely lost to them for now.
So Dean keeps attending parties, soirees, whatever, always by Cas’ side, gritting his teeth whenever Meg shows up, ‘cause he knows exactly how it’s gonna go.
“Meg’s the one who told me about this place, actually,” Garth adds, making casual conversation, instead of coming up with a solution to this shitshow.
“I honestly can’t remember,” she admits. “I was starting to fall asleep. He might’ve been wearing it, he might not have.”
In the next second, Dean appears in the dining room doorway, worse for wear and covered in blood – Charlie’s, Castiel hopes. Their eyes catch and hold, and even from here, Castiel can see Dean’s stuttered exhale of relief. Dean glares at Meg out of the corner of his eye, an I-dare-you-to-shoot-me glance, before he’s rushing toward Castiel, collapsing the distance between them, dropping to his knees.
,” Jimmy continues, sloshing liquid around like rough seas, as Dean stands there uselessly. “I knew you were up to something back in Chicago, probably with some
If Jimmy’s spoken to Balthazar, he already knows. But it bears repeating, ‘cause it’s pretty much the sticking point of Dean’s entire existence right now. “Cas’ll die.”
When Castiel emerges a handful of seconds later, his hair is tousled and sticking up in all directions. His eyes are bright and roguish when he replies, “I know,” with an undercurrent of mirth in his voice that makes Dean squirm. “It’s you I came to see.” He drops the towel on Jimmy’s desk next to his discarded suit jacket and digs into the knot of his tie with deft fingers, yanking it loose and pulling it through the damp collar of his shirt.
Cas raises his eyebrows, pen poised above the crook in Dean’s elbow. “What do you want to do for your birthday?”
Abruptly reanimated, he tips all his stuff into his backpack, photo included, and nearly injures himself in his haste to get the hell outta there.
Nothing of note — some sports team just scored — and so Dean returns his gaze to the place it matters. He stares at Cas, the asymmetrical beauty of him.
They both end up in a tangle of limbs on the floor and Dean yells out to Cas, “Stay the fuck back!” ‘Cause the last thing he wants with Nick’s wild flailing and trigger happy finger is for Cas to end up eating lead.
“Speak for yourself, Cas,” Dean says. “All this adrenaline and terror is making me hungry.” He pats his stomach.
“Always,” Dean responds. He turns his cheek, pressing a kiss to the lifeline in Castiel’s palm. The private little half-smile that Dean aims upwards has Castiel returning it, warmth sprawling in his chest. He relinquishes his already tenuous grace-hold over Dean, trust implicit in the gesture. As per his promise, Dean stays on his knees of his own volition, his face cradled in the cup of Castiel’s hand.
The Chef throws his arms up in frustration and stalks off, leaving Dean to grin to himself and revel in his petty, pun-based victory.
going to ask you if there’s anything you need. A drink? Do you want to go home? If you want to stay here, that’s fine too.”
Nothing that’s happened between them has ever made Dean feel like Cas doesn’t love him, but then, like Meg said, Cas doesn’t trust him. And surely that’s a big part of love?
Dean lowers the shovel as Cas comes closer to the bumper so he can see better too. “Kids, what the fu— hell are you doing here?”
There’s nothing in the world like being the center of Cas’ focus. Dean wants it all for himself. Which is kinda inconvenient because, well, he’s fucking married (to the wrong twin) and Cas values his independence above all else.
The leader of the quartet is deathly white and has pins driven into his head at inch intervals. At his side, a bald woman whose neck is pinned open like Dean’s ninth-grade vivisection frog. Accompanying them is a feature-less creature whose bloody mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle — the exposed teeth sharpened to points — and the fourth is a grotesque, sweating slug-monster whose eyes are covered by dark, John-Lennon-esque glasses.
Cas’ voice is a low rumble against Dean’s skin when he answers, “Would it make a difference if I had?”
For their sins, Dean and his butt took the meted-out punishment like any self-respecting adult receiving their birthday
“It’s a little tight,” Cas complains, stretching out his fingers right to the tips, rolling his neck.
“It’s at times like this,” Dean says, plucking his shirt away from his chest, fanning at himself with it, “I wish I was a chick, so I could do that trick. Y’know, the one where they tie their shirt tails in a half knot underneath their boobs.”
Castiel steps past him, closer than strictly necessary, the heat and scent of his skin so fucking close, all fresh rainwater, earth, and masculinity. Dean breathes in as Castiel breathes out and the air around them is utterly still, the silence only fragmented by the soft pelt of rain outside.
Dean snaps with it, a hot rush of nerves in his blood. “Yeah? Have you ever considered telling her that? ‘Cause she told me—” This time, Dean cuts himself off.
When Castiel rushed out after Dean to apologize, to maybe stutter out his feelings, Dean was sitting on a bench in the plaza, looking so miserable that Castiel actually felt something like guilt carving out a hole in his chest. It was odd, and he didn’t like it. Though, looking back, it was the first indication that this wasn’t a mere infatuation, as Meg kept insisting. This was something more.
He pushes things just a little bit too far with a dude in a bar — he barely even remembers what the guy looks like — suggesting a threesome, which the guy is definitely keen on. Dean, and especially Cas, not so much.
He refuses to be the Sarah Michelle Gellar of this situation. If he's gotta be anyone, then he's at least a Jennifer Love Hewitt.
“Fuck,” Nick spits, panic starting to creep in around the edges along with the realization that he’s been outmaneuvered by some pretty boy he’d hoped to have ass up or failing that, dead. He keeps shooting Dean little glances out of the corner of his eye as he heatedly confers with his still-standing ape, whilst Dean keeps an eye on the one at his own feet, kicking him in the stomach when he starts having ideas about getting back up.
Lips clinging softly, Cas pulls back a little, dragging his mouth along Dean’s jawline and down the tight tendon of his neck, sharp points of his teeth nipping as he goes.
Dean gets it, of course he does; it’s through breaking down individuality that the masses can recognize the humanity in others and relate to it. They can’t show a kid wearing his favorite black metal band shirt to the press, ‘cause that’s an aberration. It’s the same reason why every funeral ever has the same empty platitudes. He was a vibrant soul who lit up a room, she loved Elvis and we would always find her dancing in the kitchen to All Shook Up, they loved to travel, taken too soon, yadda yadda etcetera etcetera.
“Shit, sorry—” Dean begins to say, stepping back, but then he gets a proper look at the guy, and embarrassment quickly slides into dread.
Castiel turns his head enough to glance up the inch or so in height difference through his lashes. “Really? I thought you’d be furious.”
“That seems like a lot for eight-thirty on a Tuesday morning,” Dean says. “Can I not just tell him about the stalker thing for now and then tackle the love thing at a later date?”
Anyone whose husband commits murder is going to have issues. But when your brother is a lawyer and the neighbors on either side of you are the sheriff of Santa Clarita and an FBI agent respectively? That’s more than issues. That’s a whole goddamn subscription.
Castiel is God. Castiel is the Alpha, the Omega, everything in between. The chlorophyll in the grass, the water vapor in the clouds.
It’s why nobody else could even hope to understand. It’s why being here, where there’s no distractions, nothing but
He’s out of the door and closing it behind him before Cas can respond, and as he closes it, he just about catches Cas asking Meg quietly, “Do you think it worked?”
Focusing on piecing together the fragments — the scent of the creek’s muddy flats, the algae-covered rocks on the bank, the thick, wet rot of moss and leaves — Dean tries to drive down certain neural highways in his mind to get him from A to A Revelation.
Chef Novak seems to remember the cameras then, but doesn’t look directly at them in case he turns to stone or some shit. His voice is quieter and more hoarse when he says, “Do it again. But
Days seep into one another, blurring and bleeding together, just a mess of studying, pining, and nervous anxiety.
, but instead, he shoves Castiel’s clothes into the dryer, not bothering to check the labels to make sure that they won’t shrink or whatever, and tells himself that everything’s fine. It’s just physical appreciation for someone who looks like his fiance. In fact, it would be weird if he
Jimmy’s smile dims, fading out until it’s replaced with a wistful look. “I’m sure they’ll be very happy together.”
Cas slides an arm around Dean’s waist. He presses a lingering kiss to Dean’s temple. “It’s okay,” he murmurs, attempting to smooth out the wrinkles in Dean’s heart. “We’ll figure it out, like always.”
They decide on a good old-fashioned ‘suicide’ by hanging. Cliched as hell and Dean’s not entirely happy about it. Her note looks like it was written by a five-year-old and the ink has gone all spidery where she was crying as Dean held a gun to her head.
“That right?” Dean asks, “Any ones in particular that you’re thinking of? So that I know which ones to avoid next time I want somebody murdered.”
Cas is still leaning into his ‘I-have-no-idea-what-my-eating-a-creamy-donut-does-to-my-perpetually-horny-roommate’ thing, so he acts all flustered, and wipes off his cheek.
Beyond the porch looms what looks like a log cabin. The bark of the cabin’s walls blends in with the trunks of nearby trees. Its roof — if it has one — is hidden under a canopy of branches and leaves, practically a part of the forest at this point.
But something could’ve happened to Benny when he was with the help? Some crazy cannibal with a meat hook?
.” He gestures broadly at Cas and all the blood. “Look, okay, so maybe we had a disagreement, but it was nothing like
Giblet says nothing - as expected, (Castiel’s a little stressed, not insane) - but merely stares at Castiel via their reflections, green eyes unblinking.
“Awesome,” Dean says, channeling his excitement at seeing Cas tomorrow into the megawatt smile he gives his husband. “So now we can both look forward to it.”
He reaches out for his husband’s hand, across the table and the gravy boat. “You gonna come with us on Saturday? I think Sam’s got tickets for the River Architecture cruise.” Including Jimmy ain’t a hardship; if anything, it gives Dean and Eileen some grownup time while their spouses nerd out over… whatever there is to nerd out over when you’re into
It quickly becomes apparent when the two of them walk into the huge, unnecessarily opulent and ostentatious boardroom, that this ain’t gonna be no amateur city hall bullshit. Which is probably one of many reasons that Cas didn’t fuck Dean in the bathroom and force him to squirm his way through the meeting.
(Sam still complains about that time they had nothing to eat but rice, lentils, and cheap ground beef that had too much gristle.)
They walk in silence for a couple of minutes whilst Dean tries to remember Cas’ schedule. He doesn’t want Cas missing any classes or whatever for him.
Dean waves him off with a strong, long-fingered hand, “Nah, I’ll get ‘em in.” He gestures to Cas’ near-empty bottle on the table, “Same again?”
He watches hungrily as Dean braces himself on his palms above Castiel, sleek and predatory, ducking his head to suck a bruise over Castiel’s collarbone.
Cas, though, is watching Dean with the kind of intense focus that used to make his dick throb. “It might not be,” he says eventually. “I’m okay with staying though.”
get it. Which means you also don’t get to dictate how I deal with this. Could I have been more professional in there? Sure. Would that have got him to open up to me? I fuckin’ doubt it, man. Like it or not, I built rapport with the witness.”
He remembers the cloying, metallic scent of blood, the endless sketchy motel rooms, the salt and sulfur, and gunpowder. He remembers John Winchester passed out drunk with blood under his fingernails, oxidizing into a thin line of rust. He remembers bundling thirteen-year-old Sammy out into the night wearing nothing but his Mutant Ninja Turtles PJs, the two of them escaping barefoot across a motel parking lot littered with used needles and broken glass.
“So, remind me. Who are these guys?” Dean asks, strolling between the rows of melted slot machines, lit only by the narrow streaks of light slanting down through the ceiling. The whole place holds the smolder of fire and burnt manmade materials. It’s pretty unpleasant and Dean’s mildly concerned that they may never get the stink out, but that’s mostly Gabe’s worry for the moment.
“Why’s it gotta be the river?” Garth asks, and three heads turn whip-quick to look at him. He’s making some pretty gross lip-smacking noises as he sucks the dust off his no-doubt-filthy-with-rain-and-dirt fingers. “
They fuck bare and hard, the two of them dripping rainwater all over the kitchen, Cas in his stolen body, using his twin’s cock to fuck Dean deep and dirty. Violent pleasure shudders through Dean with every smack of Cas’ pelvis against the meat of his ass, every core-deep drive inside, shoving time and again up against Dean’s prostate with bone-jarring accuracy.
Dean’s sticky as hell, clothes glued to his skin, and one shadowed glance at Benny shows that he’s in pretty much the same state.
that the second he allowed even the tiniest sliver of it to break through that partition wall in his mind, he’d be catapulted all the way back to that dangerous place where Cas is everything and everything is Cas. After years of him and Cas not being together, experiencing all this craziness first-hand again — instead of merely reliving the memories like worn-through film — is breathing air back into his lungs. The last ten years have felt like stasis; stale and a wash of gray, when he could’ve been living his life in color.
Cas hunts down his own petite mort, fucking Dean relentlessly, anger and primal need driving him, and it has Dean shivering as Cas grinds into him, fucking him deep enough that he’ll be feeling it for weeks. Cas follows Dean over, still thrusting through his own orgasm, moaning something that sounds like Dean’s name, but it can’t be, because it sounds anguished, like this all means something and it
Pinhead smiles. His teeth are foul, discolored and coated in a film of grime. “It doesn’t matter. You must come with us.”
“You got my name from the mailbox, huh?” At the salesman’s nod of confirmation, Dean tells him, “I’m not interested,” and he starts to shut the door, but the guy’s black briefcase blocks it.
“How?” Dean asks, tossing his pen away in frustration. It hits the silver-plated frame with a photo of him and Sammy outside this office the day Dean opened. His younger self is so full of hope and excitement for the future. Dumbass. “If you’re so sure that he’s a vampire and is going out to drink from other people, then you don’t need me to follow him, do you?”
“Great,” Dean mutters. “Be sure to make that differentiation to your defense lawyer when Jody arrests you.”
In his sleep, Cas shifts, bringing his arm up around Dean’s lower back, anchoring him. Dean smiles against the underside of Cas’ jaw.
He glances at Cas, who’s squinting at his textbook like the words are written in a foreign language. He’s not paying any attention to Dean and his present at all.
And with that, she sashays away, winking at him before she disappears back inside, leaving Dean standing there gaping after her.
“Is that consent?” Cas is trying to keep things easy-breezy-beautiful-Cover-Girl, but his dark eyes are telling a different story. One that would probably be sold in a glossy magazine on a newsagent’s top shelf.
The intensity lifts off of Dean just long enough for him to take a sip of air. Those eyes move to Benny briefly, sharp and calculating but ultimately disinterested before they find their way back to Dean, compelled and with the heated focus of someone scared that the thing in front of them is a mirage.
Either he’s some kind of superhero, in which case, why isn’t he in downtown Manhattan right now instead of laid up in a hospital bed, or he’s incredibly fucking lucky.
, except for where he’s absolutely freaking the fuck out, because finding out that your husband eats people is a therapy bill waiting to happen. Finding out that your husband eats people twenty minutes before your sheriff neighbor is presented with the same information? Well, that’s a recipe for conjugal visits and a lifetime of laying horizontally on couches, staring at inkblots.
Something stirs the atmosphere beyond where Dean’s straddling the corpse. Breath held in his lungs, heart in his mouth, Dean freezes and listens, catching the scratchy sound of movement.
Dean’s pretty sure that suffering is something god was big on back in the day, but he remains quiet, thankful for Amelia’s can-I-speak-to-the-manager attitude that’ll get them the fuck outta here sooner rather than later.
Unlike the other pictures, there’s no obvious sexual connotations to these. No proprietorial overtones. Just creepy candids, like someone checking in.
to do are two very different things. He yanks the keys out of the ignition and slams the car door shut.
Cradling Cas’ limp body to his chest in that house, the metal handles on the mahogany drawers of the double sinks digging into his back, Dean believed he’d lost his husband. He thought that he was gonna have to make it through the rest of his life alone — without the person he loves most in this world. The best part of him gone. Just like that.
Which is one of many reasons she is not allowed a(nother) car, and coincidentally, precisely why he's not eager to leave his aforementioned clone and his id-oriented zombie husband alone together.
Who would even buy someone they were interested in that kind of gift anyway? It was clingy and strange, Castiel suddenly realized.
The dude stares unblinkingly at Dean, painfully earnest, “I won’t take but a minute of your time, Mr. Bonham.”
worth discarding. Cas, who called him beautiful with the kind of reverence that most reserve for religion or art or a diamond the size of a fist. Cas, who always comes back for him, and now, apparently even from the dead.
There’s nothing else. No other reports to suggest anything else came of the police investigation, but…
It’s one thing to receive a sinister kind of catharsis from a brutal (and well-deserved) beating, but to actually kill the guy feels like a vindictive step too far.
However, ‘a face only a mother could love’ is one that he’s always understood, but not wholly appreciated until right now, because this...whatever the fuck it is, is the actual embodiment of the sentiment. The lesions on its skin dot an expanse of haunting whiteness and there are blisters everywhere, pus dribbling, open sores. Festering and swollen, they seem to be the least of the creature’s skin issues - something that not even L’Oreal and an entire field of tortured bunnies could rectify - black and puke yellow, spectrum ends of a bruise. Rotten. Its breath comes in rattling wheezes, clinging like a heavy drag in wind.
Wiping a sausage-fingered hand across his sweat-shiny brow, the chief says, “Turns out that people are murdering bastards on the weekends as well.”
Cas’ voice is harder than Dean’s dick ten minutes ago. “Are you sure you want to go down this route?”
Turning around, he begins to soap himself, fresh scent mingling with the steam. He wonders what Cas will look like once he’s finished with this guy. How many more will he need before he’s whole again? How did he escape from wherever the hell he’s been? What the fuck is that box?
“Alright,” Dean agrees slowly, light-headed and numb-brained with the possibilities of what they might find on a more thorough search. “So we head back into the woods?”
To the man who is technically his superior — at least in name — Dean replies, “Eat a dick, Henriksen.” To Charlie, he says, “‘
The three of them nod. Practically in unison, and Dean has a super bad feeling about this. But up until whatever caused Cas’ condition, dude was thoroughly sensible.
“I know you’re at Jo’s on Tuesday evenings these days, but perhaps we should stay together tonight? Just until everything with the stalker is resolved.”
So rather than the wine bar he visited a couple of days previously, today it’s an Irish pub with soccer on the huge TV screens positioned all around the wood-paneled space. It’s got a comfortable, worn-in feeling, with Guinness on tap and fish and chips on the menu.
There’s something enthralling about the way the guy is so at ease with the darkness. The way he’s not in a rush to get home, despite it being the early hours and the news constantly broadcasting that there’s a serial killer on the loose,
Inside, spots of rust-colored blood form a trail that dead-ends at a bench with a hole in it. A swarm of flies buzzes over the recently eviscerated corpse of some poor animal. Entrails and blood slop from the bench to the floor.
Cas glances down at the photo and then back up at Dean, storm clouds gathering behind clear blue eyes. His frown deepens, displeasure written in every line of his face. “Your stalker took this? He was there?”
Sensing she’s gained a tiny lead over Dean, she continues, “I’ll level with you, Ken doll. I don’t think you’re cut out for Castiel. He’s special, and you’re—” She drops her eyes down his body and back up again, and Dean has to fight back the repulsed shudder. “Well, you’re just bland, boring,
The five of them stroll towards the Jeep, with Benny and Garth reaching it first, Charlie close behind, and Cas and Dean bringing up the rear.
Cas responds with a kiss just beneath Dean’s ear. He drags Dean’s still-open shirt down his arms and leaves it there, tangled around Dean’s wrists, pinning his hands behind his back. Automatically, Dean’s fingers search for Cas’ skin, coming into contact with the firmness of his stomach, the back of his knuckles brushing against the silky head of Cas’ erection.
is to resent the implication that watching Bruce Campbell going nuts in a remote cabin isn’t fun, but he
Dean rushes out, “Cas, please. Pleasepleaseplease,” as his husband begins to suck in earnest, the air growing thick with dirty, slick sounds. He tilts his head back when his cockhead tips down Cas’ throat, right past his apparently non-existent gag reflex. “Oh, fuck. Cas.” Dean’s arm is trembling, struggling to hold up his weight.
If sleeping with your brother-in-law on your wedding day can be referred to as a lapse and not a sincere attempt to fuck it all up. Which Dean doesn’t
In the dining room, the others — all freshly dressed and huddled around in a little pow-wow — stop talking as soon as Dean gets close enough to hear.
Her opening line isn’t: ‘hey, how’s things’ or ‘happy birthday, buttface’, it’s, “what happened to your face?” as she reaches up to stroke a gentle finger over the pink, ever-so-slightly abraded skin on his jaw.
To be fair, when Dean tossed his bag in, he wasn’t really paying attention, and he doubts the others were either.
Cas’ voice is pitched low when he replies, “I think we’re just the right level of attached.” He kisses Dean on the mouth, just a soft kiss that smolders into a slow burn, and the tension at the base of Dean’s spine eases with each sweep of Cas’ tongue against his, and Cas backs him up onto the couch, studying the furthest thing away from either of their minds.
It’s a Sunday morning, so Jimmy is out at church, content to go along with friends of his who won’t sizzle upon stepping across the threshold. Dean’s got paperwork to catch up on anyway; their honeymoon only pushed back Dean’s workload rather than erasing it for the two weeks, so he’s been working overtime on both cars and administration since they returned.
The phone calls have been getting more and more frequent, and Dean would put it down to the same worry his and their mutual friends are exhibiting, but it’s
Cas slides a burning hot palm really high onto Dean’s thigh, fingers brushing the inseam of his jeans, and Dean makes a squeaking noise, coffee nearly sloshing over the edge of the mug. He goes to side-eye Cas, but that intense, blue-eyed stare is all for the situation unfolding on the TV screen.
Charlie, holding a flashlight, leads the way to the front door. “And so, we bid this place a fond farewell,” she says as she descends the porch steps.
Cas turns up a half-hour later, full of rushed apologies. Dean’s feeling kinda tipsy on posh-people booze and nothing but a couple of canapes in his stomach. He’s inordinately pleased that Cas has finally arrived to save him from this pomp and circumstance, but Cas barely presses a cold-lipped kiss to Dean’s cheek, before he’s moving on to shaking the hands of the men who were sniggering behind their palms at Dean.
Cas sees it too. “Dean,” he says, this time with a thicker accent and more force. “Come here.” He’s not looking at Dean as he orders him about; no, his focus is on the two in the doorway, blue eyes ice cold.
He kinda-sorta wants to ask Cas what his plan is, kinda-sorta doesn’t. He’s scared of the answer. It’s clearly something Cas had been mulling over for a while, while Dean had kept his own homicidal thoughts firmly in the realm of fantasy.
When Cas comes, it’s with a mangled approximation of Dean’s name forcing its way past his plush lips, and Dean shudders all over again, shattered into a million pieces by the way his name tears itself from Cas’ soul and embeds itself right back into his skin, and Cas collapses against him, bodies and heartbeats pressed together.
Untied, but still sprawled on his stomach, Dean lies there enjoying the pleasant ache in his muscles, the stretch, the burn, satisfaction sunk bone deep.
“You could say that,” Victor interrupts. “Charlie, we need you to find everything you can on the three victims we have so far.”
Dean’s hurt his husband’s feelings. And it’s not like he can still pretend that Cas doesn’t have any like he used to be able to, ‘cause Cas’ wedding speech lives rent-free inside Dean’s head. That
Dean gives her the finger and Garth snort-laughs. Cas is stiff next to him as Dean throws an arm around his shoulders. Between Dean and Garth, Benny places his palms on their lower backs.
Feeling petty as hell and completely irrational, Dean closes the door, turns the key in the lock so that Gabriel and Balthazar can’t resume their incompetent game of telephone or ride to Cas’ rescue. He drops the key into the front pocket of his jeans.
Because the ominous threat-slash-promise isn’t quite The-House-on-Sorority-Row enough, there’s a picture tucked into the bottom right corner of the mirror.
He can feel the familiar sensation hurtling up on him, the hot rush of it under his skin, tugging behind his navel. Fuck, he’s gonna come untouched, his cock slut-red and curved toward his stomach, his balls pulled tight. Oh, fuck it's too much. Shit shit
Jimmy’s laugh is a choked-off, bitter sound. “First the lighter, then this. You must think I’m stupid!”
Castiel’s voice reverberates around the warehouse, shattering what remaining glass there is in the rusted iron panes. “Enough!” The demon barely even flinches as chunks of glass rain down; a marked difference from the first time Castiel attempted to talk to Dean as a human. “I’ve only let you live this long because I once cared for the human you are infecting.”
In the wake of Cas’ phone call, however, Dean tones it down, figuring that now he’s actually seeing Cas again, he can offer Jimmy some peace from his twin.
Near the north end of the lake, there’s a narrow outlet. The glassy water reaches north-west at least a hundred yards before it vanishes under a field of reeds and lily pads.
Lo and behold, with nobody to banter against, she gives in after a protracted pause. “Do you know how Clarence and I know each other?”
It’s a photo of him fourteen years ago, sitting in the plaza at college, heartbroken ‘cause he’d walked in on Cas and Meg getting jiggy with it.
Dean’s beginning to think that they might be a pair of idiots. Failing to communicate, like the oblivious morons in every rom-com ever.
Though as he stands there on the morning of his wedding, on the threshold of their shared Chicago home, staring at the mirror image of his soon-to-be-husband, Dean has a pretty good idea.
before Cas and this guy is barrelling on like Dean’s given him an in, “You looked lonely standing here all by yourself, so I thought I’d come over and keep you company.”
Cas makes a noise of consideration, drawing out his decision until Dean’s starting to sweat — metaphorically and literally. “Do you remember when I withheld your orgasm for over five hours?”
Done with Jimmy’s guests and the evening, Dean checks the clock behind his husband — the same clock he stared at years ago when Cas was getting undressed in the study at their old place. It’s just after midnight. Respectable time to retire for the evening. “I think I’m gonna go to bed.” He flashes a stiff-lipped smile around the table at everyone in turn.
“Berkeley has a scheme where I can move into transition housing over the summer,” Cas says casually.
Still, the whole thing drags, not helped by Cas glaring daggers at John for a large amount of the ceremony, unable to take Dean’s hand on what should be a pretty proud day in their lives. It’s dumb, but Dean hates his dad a lot in the moment, hates him for intruding on Cas and Dean’s little bubble, for making Dean remember that there is a world outside of them, and it’s not always going to be welcoming them with open arms.
“I don’t have a girlfriend,” Cas tells her, ever so slightly puzzled. Most likely as to why on earth she’s asking this, but probably more so as to why Dean would’ve shared any information about his love life with these people.
In their haste, Dean and Cas damn near fall through a stairwell door that’s barely hanging onto its hinges and come out on the second-floor landing. Giving access to above and below, the stairs sweep away from them in both directions, grand in their heyday —  like the rest of this place —  now just old and dilapidated.
The five of them spend the rest of the afternoon exploring the dimly lit hallways and corridors. There’s gotta be around two hundred rooms spread over four floors, so Dean’s not surprised to find that, apparently, the maid doesn’t do bedrooms either.
Dean jumps off the pile, boots hitting the floor with a dull thud, “Overwhelming, right? The first time I came here, I didn’t know where to look
On the other side of the lake, Dean can just about make out the faint shape of the dock with the diving platform, but he wants to try and get as close as possible to where the river and lake meet, so that he’ll be nearer the hotel. He steers the boat to the right, fighting against the current, which is gaining strength with every inch he rows closer to the river.
Dean’s relieved to see that, at least, none of the hundreds of windows have institution-style bars. But most of the shutters hang open or are damaged or crooked, or are just gone entirely. Some of the windows are broken.
tried. I spent weeks trying to convince myself that I was imagining things. That it wasn’t real. That it was just sex, that you weren’t the most beautiful person I’d ever seen.”
Dean wants to ask, but at the same time, doesn’t. They all know that Garth is currently separated from his wife, allegedly because he was having an affair, but they don’t know the hows, whys, wheres, etc.
Fingers curled around the base of Dean’s cock, all faux-innocent but genuinely irresistible, Cas asks, “Do you
More clacking. “Yep. Boy wonder is right again. The Ripper’s seventh victim was a college freshman named Jason. Oh, he was cute. He had that all-American, corn-fed teenager with blue eyes and blond hair thing going on. Seems like his family was made of money and they really kept the momentum in his missing case going. If they hadn’t, his body might never have been discovered, left out in the sticks as it was.”
They had money saved. It was supposed to be an extended honeymoon of sorts, something they’d been planning a long time for. But then Castiel’s twin brother and sister-in-law died.
Dean jolts against the bed when Castiel’s tongue laps at him, shoving inside him, stubble a rough scrape against Dean’s tender, oversensitized skin. He gasps, twisting against the sheets, until Castiel tightens his grip, a silent warning to stay still.
Dean laughs, perfectly psychotic. “Y’know what? I don’t care. I killed one of my best friends tonight. I killed him because there was a chance that all this might’ve been his doing, but now that I know it’s not? Makes no difference. Know why, sweetheart? He hurt Cas, and he was threatening to turn us in for the Ketch murder. So what do you think I’d be happy to do to
But. He won’t be able to get it out of his head if he doesn’t investigate. He’ll spend the rest of their (hopefully) short time here freaking the fuck out, waiting for whatever just slammed that door to come out of the shadows and throttle him with razor wire.
For a long moment, Dean just stands there, flashlight held limply in his hand. He’s tempted to get the multi-tool out of his pocket; it’s got a couple of small blades on it. Enough to jam into someone’s femoral artery and do some serious damage, but he decides against it, choosing to keep his right hand free.
Cas lets go of the creeper, who slumps to the decking. The guy’s chest rises and falls unevenly, his breathing ragged, so he’s not dead.
The lead Cenobite — the one with all the pins — points at the configuration on the floor next to Jimmy’s foot, where he must’ve dropped it. “You opened the box,” he says in a voice several octaves too deep for a human’s. “We came.”
Benny’s eyes round out with surprise. “I assure you I didn’t. I didn’t even see him on my way back inside. Which means that he must’ve followed us. He saw us being pally, goofin’ off. Mistook it for somethin’ it definitely wasn’t.”
Dean reaches up to Cas’ face, drags his fingertips over the day-end stubble. “Cas, I want you so bad. Please.”
believe me, ‘cause he’s very popular if you know what I mean,” He winks salaciously, leans back, makes a show of squeezing Cas’ ass, “it’s me he loves.”
While Jimmy’s busy in the kitchen, Dean stands out on their porch, Cas’ lighter in his palm, running his thumb over the skin-warm metal, digging his thumbnail into the engraving. The sky above him is heavy and painted in bruise-like purples and blacks, threatening to tear open at any second. The scent of petrichor permeates the air.
It mildly occurs to Dean that his visit to the house a few weeks ago may have been a little more insidious than at first pathetic glance. Dean didn’t catch the second half of the conversation between Benny and Sam, but he would bet his newly acquired castle that their wedding and honeymoon dates were mentioned.
