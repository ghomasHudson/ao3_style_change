She takes the knife to the edge of the braid, realizing as she begins to saw into the hair that this is a lot more difficult than
"Cas are you ok?" Dean asks again, pausing from the monologue of random topics she had been keeping up to focus herself and try and distract Cas.
reason sits there, hanging in the air, and Dean tries to forget that she smells like no perfume she’s ever owned.
It had been a dumb mistake, really, letting the ghost knock her back against the fireplace in the old manor. Dean had insisted on going with her mother, begged that she was old enough to hold her own.
Why she goes in, Dean doesn’t really know. She sees Cas in her little blue vest, the nametag reading
"I'll go figure it out" Cas says, moving to leave, to retreat to the bathroom or to the room that's apparently hers now, anywhere where Dean isn't looking at her like that.
“Dean I-”
“Gladly” Dean responded, but Sam had already slammed the door in her face.
"Ya know when Sammy was like 7 or 8, she hated cutting her hair right? She wanted to be like Rapunzel or something." Dean laughs a little, and Cas feels a smile starting to break across her face.
Sam shook her head at Dean, realizing there was no talking her out of this.
When she was younger it was easier to make money that way. Her body was still soft and she still moisturized her hands with hotel lotion most days, pretending she was a normal girl. Her small breasts and malnourished frame even did her favors, as prepubescent innocence can be a turn on in the right corner of a bar. Either way it kept Sammy well fed and safe, which was more than dad’s food allowance (when he remembered to leave one) ever gave them. Sammy hit puberty early, and was always the prettier of the two of them, so it took everything Dean had to keep the creeps eyes on her and off of Sam’s back.
Twenty minutes later the barber holds up a mirror and holds out a hand. Dean digs in her pockets for the cash, but she can’t take her eyes off the mirror. She looks different, but stronger. The sharpness of the haircut seems to match the sharpness of her, well, everything, and for the first time since Sam left, she feels like herself.
” Dean said, trying to end the call so Sam could go back to her life, even though Dean still desperately wanted to catch up with her sister.
Dean stood up and grabbed the hair clipper off the dresser. She might as well make use of her impulse buy right?
Dean didn’t know exactly when she decided she wanted to cut her hair, but now seemed as good a time as any. Maybe she would lend more credence to rumors of her being gay, but what did she care? With no one to stop her Dean took the knife she usually carried and pressed it against a length of hair. The first chop was deliberately messy, and so were most of the others.
“Oh” Mary says, “Well, good then, as long as that’s the reason.”
Her gut was right, as it usually is, because she walks into her room to find Mary Winchester, staring at the dark tv with a cup of gas station coffee cooling on the countertop.
She sloughs off her jacket and jeans and crawls onto her bed in a tank top and boxers. Some rerun of a 70s show is playing on the tv and Dean doesn’t pay it much attention. The show’s steady noise reminds her of her childhood, like it’s something her dad would leave on for Sammy whenever he went out on a hunt.
"I do too, Dean. I'm worried that Dorothy is Not what's best for our friend."
"Yes Charlie?"
"What for?"
"Dean. No. The beauty of this situation is that it's good for both of us. Being able to sleep with you banishes the panic attacks I had at night. I would feel so alone at night and the panic would begin. I could convince myself that the world had ended and there was no one left but me. Of course, my brain would then decide that somehow my Uncle had survived and was going to come after me again. So, you help me immensely. Also, it does keep you from having your nightmare, yes?"
He held his hand out for Cas to shake, only he didn't. He just sort of held it. Dean wasn't going to complain if a cute boy wanted to hold his hand, he just wasn't sure what Cas meant by it.
“Don’t,” he whispered when he saw Dean reach for a pair of boxers, getting ready for bed.
As he was sitting at the stop sign letting traffic go through, he caught a scent that caused the hair on his body to stand on end. It was the perfect combination of a perfect cherry pie and the inside of his baby, like worn leather. Huh, it wasn’t only his body hair that stood up. Dean took one hand off the steering wheel to press down his half chub. When he turned the corner, the smell faded and it made his omega whine at the loss. What the hell?!?
“Alright, now, tell me what scent we are chasing.”
“Good. Castiel, he goes by Cas, is a professor here, at Stanford. He teaches Religous History but he hates it. Our parents were utter crap and set some heavy shit on his shoulders when he presented as an alpha.”
"Always."
"Who, or what are you talking to Cas?"
"Crap! Dude, where did you come from? You scared the shit out of me."
“Oh man. It's perfect. It's like Missouri’s cherry pie and leather.”
Sammy was always looking at their clasped hands and then rolling his eyes when Dean caught his eye. So, yeah. Sammy knew how he felt about Cas, he continually tried to convince Dean that he should tell him. He said that it was obvious that Cas felt the same way. Dean wasn't so sure, but he was going to find out. Soon.
“I just need to touch your skin. Please. I do kinda like you teasing me, I just need some contact.”
Dean shook his leg to get the guy to let go before stepping down from the chair. Great now he smelled like beer and he still hadn't found Cas.
"Good. So today was just about this date?"
Dean was waiting for Cas to get out of the shower so they could go eat. They had been up a few hours and he had managed to coax him into drinking a couple of cups of tea, after convincing him that tea was not in fact evil, and Cas thought he should be able to keep some food down. He was sure of his love for his Angel after he cleaned all that vomit up. Yuck.
“I’ll beg, I’ll do whatever you want! I need you.”
“Well, that’s good, since it’s my Mate! Come on, let’s go back this way where I first caught a whiff. When I turned, I lost it so we should go the other direction, yeah?”
But with you there it won't be bad
Dean’s omega was pacing, whining and crying at the thought of his Alpha being mistreated.
Cas winced as Dean pulled out to raise up on his knees. He stripped his cock hard and fast, pointing it at Cas’ stomach and chest. He couldn’t take his eyes off his man. He was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, but his beauty intensified when he let out a grunt and began marking Cas.
“Castiel, come on, Darlin’. Let go. I can feel it, you’re almost there. Give it to me, Cas. Give it up. Damn. You look so beautiful spread out with my cock inside you. I love being buried in your hot, little ass. Damn. Fuck. It feels so good...ummm...I can feel every part of you. Please, baby. Come on, come for me. I love you so much, Sugar.”
"You'll be fine, Dean. Ash and Max are going, hook up with them to walk over."
"I know. I can't thank you enough, Charlie."
Dean knew that Cas's social cues weren't that great so he just had to make sure. Plus, there was the whole 'getting his hopes up' thing.
“Where are you?”
Dean woke up on Monday when Cas's damn alarm went off. Since it took Cas about three times hitting the snooze button to actually ya' know, get up, Dean always got up when Cas needed to.
Cas trailed off thinking of the last month that had been both Heaven and Hell. He and Dean had become the best of friends. There wasn't much they didn't tell each other or many times that they had even been separated since they had moved into their dorm room.
"Nothing. Everything else is the same as we talked about on Friday. I'm doing my breathing when I feel a panic attack beginning but I haven't needed to in a while. I'm keeping a journal as you suggested."
"Cas?"
"That's o.k. I'm Dean and I'm pre-med. You?"
Or that I could feel these things for you
"Well..... did you get the right size?"
"O.k., then. Both ya' idjits are blind. Cas is coming up the road."
"Yes?"
“Not yet, Sugar.”
Holy BatCrap. Dean never knew that his name could sound so pornographic. Cas actually shimmied closer rubbing himself on Dean's hip. The only conclusion he could come up with is that Cas was trying to kill him. Actually wanted him dead. He really needed to have some time to himself in the shower and that wasn't going to happen unless he got his blue-eyed sexy as hell Angel up and out of their room.
"Good. So, what else brings you here?"
"Yep. What did he drink?"
"Alright, look here Dean. Do you remember the discussion we had years ago about your parents taking you at your word that you were fine and trying not to let their own worries affect how they reacted to you?"
"Max, please??"
"Well, if you need me...."
"Cas! It's gonna be fine! You guys are made for each other, everyone can see it! Don't worry about it, you're supposed to be enjoying yourself, remember?"
"Cas, shut up. Why can't you sleep?"
While Cas thought this torture was hard (pun intended) physically, he was beginning to think it was worse on him emotionally. He wasn’t sure if he could do this, so he needed to talk to Dean. Luckily, Dean was always willing to listen.
"You interrupted me to tell me to shut up and then asked me a question."
"No."
"Mornin' Bobby."
“I want you to watch me. Put your hands on the bed behind you so you can lean back just a bit. Yeah, perfect, Baby. Watch.”
"O.k, so let's get back into this paper."
Dean knew Benny was drunk that's the only reason that Dean had been polite so long, you never knew how a drunk was going to act. However, when Benny tried to reach over and grab Dean's ass, he was done. He shoved him against the pantry door keeping him in place with his arm across his throat, gentle enough not to hurt him but hard enough that Benny wasn't moving.
“There’s something out there Sam, I know it.”
“I was getting coffee” Dean lies, realizing she hadn’t prepared herself for her mother’s reaction to the hair.
"Why not?"
did you do to your hair?”
Besides, there wasn’t much of her left to offer, even though creepy old men aren’t often picky. But over the past few years her baby fat had melted into hard won muscle and scars populated more of her body than not. Men didn’t want to take advantage of a 20-something crossbreed that smelled more like old spice and leather than a woman. Dean didn’t think she was a lesbian, didn’t really think of herself as anything, but she had been called a dyke enough time to know what people thought of her.
“Back at you, bitch”
She looks at the small couch besides her, the space where in some other day there might be another bed, another body, there to laugh and share a beer with until Dad came home.
"I have an idea" Dean says- and Cas looks up finally. Dean's eyes are twinkling and suddenly she's reaching behind Cas into the medicine cabinet.
“Give me a number six” Dean says, pointing to the board on the far wall. Short sides, a little long on top.
Sam is gone and has been gone for a few months now. It was Christmas and Sam was still in California. It wasn’t like Dean had expected her home or anything, Why would she? None of them had called the Campbell house ‘home’ since Sam graduated, when it was no longer a convenient address for school paperwork. Sam had called, at least, hitting up Dean’s cell after hanging up with Mom who was still out in Henderson finishing up a case. Dean had planned to meet Mary in Vegas for Christmas, but Mary had decided she didn’t want to drop all her leads just for some holiday that came around every year anyway. She’d be in by New Years at the latest. That, she promised.
The angel looks back at her with bright blue eyes and a dark head of hair, cut in a chin length bob that mirrors Dean’s own.
With the longest bits off she stared at herself in the mirror. She looked like a crazy person with frayed tufts of different lengths sticking up at all angles. She looked like a mental patient. She might’ve been a mental patient if there were anyone left to stop her.
She almost stays for breakfast- almost, but she’s slipping out with a quick peck on the lips. She hates to leave her, in her silk robe and nice apartment, but something in her gut tells her she needs to get back.
"And if you don't like it you can just grow it out, start fresh." Cas is nodding. She can do this, of course she can do this, just like she can eat and shower and breathe. In fact, she
Cas looks up at Dean, who's staring at her from across the table. She's showered now, and no longer smells like weeks old bus station, but she'll admit she kinda dropped the ball on her hair.
After taking a small sip of the drink Cas began watching some of the party goers dancing to the music. It wasn't the music that he and Dean enjoyed listening to in their room, but it definitely had a bass beat that had his hips starting to rock back and forth.
"O.k., then. Well, since you promised the truth I will promise you this is the last time I'll ask you this. You really don't just sleep with me to keep me from having a nightmare?"
He scooted his ass to the edge of the chair so Cas could see his balls heavy with need, and get a glimpse of his hole. One thing that Cas loved more than anything, other than getting fucked deep and slow, was rimming Dean. They hadn’t been able to be together for a few days on this hunt and Dean was more than ready to get off, but first his Angel needed a little torture...uh, visual stimulation.
He tilted his neck as Dean ran his nose up from his shoulder to behind his ear, to leave sweet kisses there. He especially liked it when Dean whispered in his ear ‘me, too, Darlin’. It made his whole body shiver with desire.
I thought life was always fair
Cas giggled quietly, not really wanting to be loud in the warmth and quiet in their room.
What a smile could look like
"I just thought that maybe that was something you could do to let Cas know how you feel. You gotta tell him soon, Dean. It's driving you nuts, and I know, I KNOW he feels the same way. Everyone can see how you two are, except you two."
"No, that's perfect Dean. Orange Raspberry sounds delicious. I just...O.k., this stays between us?"
“Look at you. Marked with my come. Holy fucking batcrap! Ummm...fuck. Came so hard for you. Love you.”
Cause I know that you're near by
"Why don't we go find an empty room upstairs and get to know each other better?"
“Dean! I've told you time and time again we need to be better prepared, but no! You have to go running in swinging your machete, leaving me and your boyfriend no option but to follow you.”
Dean heard the warning just as someone bumped into the chair he was standing on. Arms spinning trying to keep his balance he poured his beer all over himself and whoever was now steadying him by holding his legs.
Dean swears under her breath and hands the kid cash. She knows tomorrow won’t be fun but tonight she’s gonna get drunk and go to sleep.
Well, Dean's the one she rebelled for, and Dean's- she's still hours away. But Cas isn't sure that even once they're together, the distance will feel any closer.
When she was younger she might’ve known how to get money fast and easy, but since coming back from the dead she swore off that shit for good.
Dean takes a look at the two braids in her hair, and at the knife she’s only recently re-sheathed in the side of her boot.
"It's ok Cas" Dean says, raising a comforting hand to Cas' shoulder.
“Where were you?” Mary asks coolly, not even looking at her daughter.
"I mean, as long as you don't mind matching" Dean says with a smirk, gesturing to her own head.
Dean shakes her head and leaves the memory alone. She grabs her wallet and counts 40 bucks, affording gas and dinner tomorrow might be a struggle, but that’s a problem for tomorrow’s Dean.
and Dean almost laughs. There are a million things she wants to say, wants to be sorry for.
Dean looked at the hotel room around her, dingy and probably not updated since at least the late 70s. Outside she could see Christmas lights on the swinging ‘vacancy’ sign, but desert everywhere else. Just another normal night in the life of Dean Winchester.
Dean looks at her for a moment with something just left of pity. Dean keeps giving her that look- like she's some useless child now, when just a week ago she was an angel of the lord, just a week ago she hadn't just cast all her siblings out of heaven- oh god.
when she’d be off the phone so they could eat.
“Dean, I want to help you, I do, but Dad’s dead. I know it’s crazy that you’re alive, but I think this should be a sign that we both need to settle down, find a life. This is a chance for both of us.”
“Fine- I get it. But I’m keeping the car. Have fun with your boytoy and your white fucking picket fence Samantha.”
"Why don't we just cut it?"
No, the worst part was the look on her mother’s face.
"Hell, I helped Sammy plenty of times when we were kids, it's no big deal."
"But she hated brushing her hair." Dean's eyes drift off, like she's remembering. "Mom hated brushing her air for her, always told her that she was old enough to brush it herself. When Sam let me brush it for her she always cried a little, not as much as when mom brushed it because I tried to go gentle, but she always loved it when it looked nice."
Dean Winchester is 22 when she’s in a shitty motel room. Of course it’s a motel room, when has it not been a motel room?
Dean brings the brush to Cas' head, starting gently trying to undo a section of knots at the nape of Cas' neck.
“So you just want to give up? On me, on Dad?”
So then they're standing in the bathroom together and Dean's got a brush in her hands. Dean hasn't touched her yet, instead inspecting the mess that is her hair. Cas is just looking at herself- all she sees of herself now, just this face, trying not to freak out.
Dean Winchester is 30 years old when she dies.
“Talk to you later.”
“I’ll have some beef jerky and a pack of menthols” Is what comes out instead.
When it’s done, she tosses the two braids into the trash can.
¨I told you Dean, I’m not going back”. Sam was standing in the doorway of her apartment building. Dean looked at her sister, chewing her lip, as she spoke.
“I wouldn’t mind that” Cas says flat but meaningfully. Dean looks at her for a moment, then clears her throat.
She pops the 6th beer open on the back of her pocket knife blade and eats her dessert dinner with the spoon attachment.
Sam hadn’t had much to say on the phone. She’d made a friend, Jessica, who also wasn’t going home, so at least she wasn’t also alone on Christmas.
“Maybe for you, Dean, but not for me” Sam said.
She goes back to the motel and puts 5 of the beers in the lukewarm mini fridge and peels open her pint of Phish Food.
Mary had brought Dean back to the motel room, waking Sammy up from where she had fallen asleep in front of the tv. She’d bled all over the carpet as she was carried to the bathroom. Probably ruining their security deposit even if they’d have time to attack the stains with bleach before checkout tomorrow. Mary had looked white in the mirror as she inspected the cut, which tore across the front part of Dean’s scalp and clotted her pale hair dark under the flickering lights.
“I’m gonna have to cut it” Dean heard her Mom say against the deepening throb of pain that had her dully picking at her jeans. She nodded glumly, at least there was time for it to grow back a bit before school started back up again.
smells, being stuck on a greyhound bus to Lebanon for days on end.
Cas let's Dean try and brush her hair again, and for a few minutes it seems to be going well, but then it just starts to seem like they'll never detangle it. Even the parts that Dean gets looking smooth still look ratty and unwashed, nothing like the smooth slick bun she had for the past year, or even in Purgatory. When Dean brushed her hair in Purgatory it wasn't like this. Maybe she still had some of her grace left, was the difference, and then she could just revel in Dean touching her hair, taking care of her in a way. But Cas can't seem to revel in that now. Instead it just seems like all her human sense are screaming at her, bundled with the guilt of all she's done bundling into what got here her, what got her human. Is she going to have to deal with this for the rest of her life?
"Thanks. I miss her every day of my life but last night was worse than ever. I just didn't want to be alone, I wanted to stop hurting for just a bit, ya' know? Don't get me wrong, you are a good looking man, I probably would have asked you out for coffee if we hadn't met at a party where I was drunk outta my head."
I never knew
"Yep. I'm good, Cas."
"Alright. I agree."
"Of course, I am."
"He's gone. I don't see him bothering us anymore."
"Morning Dean!"
"Because you keep petting my hair."
I never knew
Son of a bitch.
"What's up?"
Cas wondered what the man was up to when he dragged the chair from the table next to the bed. He sat down and gave Cas a wink and a smirk.
"Your hot."
As soon as the last drop fell from his cock, Dean pushed up on his hands and hefted one of Cas’ legs up around his waist and began pounding into Cas, chasing his own orgasm.
"Excuse me, back up, please."
"It was alright, Bobby. I only have two classes with Dean along with lunch. No classes with Kevin, or Charlie, but four with Benny. Which is a blessing since in two of those Azazel is in there."
“Thanks Sammy, really. I'm so thankful that Missouri has been around to teach you how to be a good alpha. She was able to counter anything Dad taught you.”
"I don't know about him feeling the same, but you are right about me going nuts! You think I should do something like that, that big, instead of just talking to him?"
“Yes, Dean.”
Dean took off at a jog to his future, as he heard his brother telling Gabe he could stay with him for a few days. He was glad to hear the offer to his future brother-in-law, but all he could think about was getting to his Alpha.
“I wonder...”
John had tried to tell Dean that he was protecting him by keeping him home, away from dangerous alphas. He had told Dean over and over that he was better off not meeting his mate, and that he would probably be an ass that wanted to keep him barefoot and pregnant. Of course, he was telling him these things as he beat him with one hand and chugged moonshine in the other hand.
"N...no."
"You can put me down now, Honey."
"I wouldn't miss it."
"Cas! I can see your thoughts spiraling. He came to apologize. He wants to take us out to breakfast to apologize. I think we should give him a second chance, but only if you agree."
He was perplexed as to who was waiting for him but had an idea it was the drunk guy from last night. Dean definitely didn't want him anywhere near his Angel.
“Deeeeeeean, please....”
"What?!?"
Cas didn’t know how long he had been sitting completely still, watching every stroke of Dean’s hand as he slowly jacked his cock. He was sure that in his whole existence he had never been tortured as much torture as Dean was torturing him with, or something like that. He couldn’t think with most of his blood having left his brain a while ago.
"The bee."
"Come on in"
"Yeah, yeah. I know. Tell him you're looking for him."
Dean followed Ash over to the coffee table. He was looking for a small red head that was with a tall, something. No one would tell him what Cas was and he was so frustrated.
"This is true. I was, however, trying to keep you from doing exactly what you're doing, being an assbutt who is in my personal space without my consent. Release my arm, back up and there won't be any problem."
"Hello Mrs. Winchester."
Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy!
Dean jumped in before Cas went on another tangent of thanking him for taking care of him. Of course he would take care of his Angel.
"Taking over his sister's thigh high boots."
All the good and the sad
Dean was standing in line trying to figure out if he had just asked out his angel.
"Max, let's go over there and get on the table. We should be able to see them from there."
Dean watched as his brother stopped before starting the truck.
Cas watched as Dean removed one arm to pull his phone out, keeping him pulled tight against him with the other. He was close enough that he could almost taste the coffee on Dean's breath. It was heavenly.
"So, you drunk?"
Feeling Ash smack him on the back of the head he turned to see him pointing. Following the path of Ash's finger, he spotted Charlie! She was dancing in the corner with a girl with pink hair up in pig tails. He was stretching his neck trying to look at the people around them to find Cas, but it was so hard to see!
“No, no. No touching allowed, for you, at least. Here's the ‘game’ I wanna play.”
"Well, I guess I'm just worried about this party that Charlie talked us into attending."
"I'm sorry you lost your SoulMate."
"What's going on?"
Cas grabbed his things and ran across campus so he had time to talk to Charlie. He spotted her red hair going up the stairs to the entrance of their building. He called her name several times before she heard him over all the other students around, when she stopped to wait he started running a bit fast. She could be impatient sometimes.
"I am, Charlie. Thank you. I would just feel better if Dean was here, he's always supposed to be here."
Dean was beyond thrilled that Sammy had skipped a grade and was now a freshman going to school with him and Cas. After his first day, his little brother had come up with a perfect idea. The four of them were sitting down to eat dinner after their first day when Sammy planted the idea in his head.
"Yes?"
“Back off Sammy, that’s my Mate.”
"Yeah, fine. Where the hell is Cas and Charlie?"
"Sure am! Guess what guys! I got tickets for everyone for the talent show tomorrow night!"
“Dean, I mean, yeah, Missouri has saved our hides over the years, but you’re the one who taught me how to be a good alpha. You raised me Dean, not John Winchester. Now, let’s go find your Alpha.”
It would start off when one of them would just, out of the blue, walk past the other and leave a wet raspberry on the other. After a few hours of raspberries, tickles, and ear nibbles, they would find themselves in a tickle fight in their bed and well, one thing always led to another with them.
"I'm Dean, Dean Winchester. Nice to meet you."
“Gross, that doesn’t sound appealing.”
"Sorry man"
Dean couldn’t help but notice that Cas had a cute smile. The messiest hair he ever saw on someone awake. The plumpest pink lips that he bet tasted awesome. The bluest eyes he had ever seen that were staring at him. Crap.
“Fuck...Cas. Damn, Baby. You look good enough to eat.”
"So, if I'm gonna be a "dark and scary" Joker, is Cas Batman?"
"I know. That's why we had the 'family' session and everyone got to hear it from Cas himself."
time they met til now, Cas usually held his hand if they were sitting together. Didn't matter if they were in class, at lunch, on the couch watching t.v., or sitting on the porch swing watching for falling stars.
Kevin rolled his eyes again but grabbed his ticket out of Dean's hand before stuffing the last of his pizza in his mouth as he texted his Mom. She was definitely a helicopter parent. Benny said he wouldn't miss it while taking his ticket before heading off to a football meeting. Charlie smiled so big it was kinda scary. She did grab her ticket before flashing them the peace sign as she left to go find her girl crush of the week.
"I just wanna dance with you, pretty girl. What's the harm in that?"
Cas pulled back so he could look into Dean's eyes. He knew he was blessed to have Dean be so accepting of him. He was holding on tight just staring back into Cas's eyes. He really wanted to know if Cas would have wanted to go. After searching his thoughts Cas realized he really didn't.
"Sure. A bit nervous, Cas too. Right?"
"I need Dean here, now."
He took a few sips of his cooling coffee while chasing crumbs along his plate with his fork. If he was honest with himself, and he really tried to be, he was more than cool with going to the college party dressed as a couple with his angel. He wanted everyone to know that he was there With Cas.
He really didn’t know how difficult this was gonna be.
"Cas, did Charlie tell you that our costumes are going to be kinda like a couple's thing?"
“Now, wait a minute. I never said that and I’m sorry if I implied that. He is terribly shy and he has bad anxiety. He came home because he smelled you just a block or so away, and made me come meet you first. He wants me to tell you about him, to give you a chance to leave if you want. So, can I tell you what he wants you to know, so you can go get him?”
"Alright. I have a most important question. Star Wars or Star Trek?"
"I'll walk with you. Gonna meet Dorothy at my place in a bit anyhow. What about Max and Ash?"
"What did you buy"
When they got back to their room the first thing Cas did was trade his shirt for his favorite sweater. Which always made Dean happy because one, it gave him a glimpse of naked skin and two, because it was his sweater that Cas always wore.
"O.k., the thing I had to take care of was Benny was downstairs."
"Hello. Thanks for the welcome."
"O.k., I'm not going anywhere. Holy BatCrap! He's a big guy."
"I'll just wait right here."
“I’m sorry.” He could feel his throat closing with the effort not to cry.
“Fuck! Yes, please. Please.”
"Yes, Castiel. I do believe that Dean was making sure that you knew it was a date. How do you feel about that?"
"O.k., why are we studying in my room anyhow? We always study in your room, ya' know, so you can "watch over" Dean."
"I saw someone that was hurting on his own but smiled at you as if you were the brightest soul he ever saw. I was glad that after your folks signed off that Cas felt like he could share his story with me. Do you know if he's still seeing Miss Donna?"
"Yeah, just about. Cas and Charlie are just leaving for the party so just relax, you'll see him soon."
His head thrashed on the pillow as his man opened him with tongue and fingers. Cas knew Dean was going to tease him by taking his time with it because he was always careful and thorough. He said he would never hurt him and would never rush this step, even when Cas begged. Which he did... a lot.
“And while you know I love it when you beg, I'm still not gonna rush. Need to get at least three in and comfortable before you’re ready for my cock. Now, I do love your begging, so ….”
As he pushed and pulled his way through Dean couldn't help but wonder at his faith that Cas belonged with him. Since the first night they met, since the first morning he woke up in Cas's arms he knew. He Cas's and Cas was his. If for some reason the universe didn't give Cas a mark to match his, Dean was determined to convince Cas they could still be together. Somehow, he would make this work, first he had to go get rid of Benny.
"Good. Let's go see if Charlie's ready to leave."
He turned from staring at his own ass to see her waving something silky, pale blue, with little white flowers on it.
“Well then, I'm off to find a motel, and Dean-o? You are going down to the house at the end of the street. See the one there, with the bee flag in the yard? That's Cassie’s house, go help him make it a home.”
"Umm...o.k. Thanks."
“Of course.”
"Alright. We should stop by the store so we can replenish our snacks stash, we should also grab some more coffee and tea."
"Sure. Find out what hours Cas is gonna have and we'll make sure you have the same free time."
"Charlie, really?"
"This is your first date?! No way!"
"Yes, Dean."
"O.k., Dean. Thank you for taking care of me."
"Yes, Dean. We will be there together so that would be a correct assumption for people to make."
"I love you."
"Yeah, you have."
He watched as Cas did his thinking pose. At least that's what he and Charlie called it. When Cas was thinking something through his eyes got kinda squinty, he tilted his head to the left, yes always the left, and he either nibbled on his bottom lip or did the cutest duck lips. All of these actions touched Dean's heart, and some a bit lower.
He had to stop as he crazy ass friends stood up clapping like fools, making loud wolf whistles, and doing the Arsenio Hall whoop...crazy. When they settled down thanks to the principal standing up to look at them, Dean began again.
"Sorry. I'm just nervous."
Dean watched as Cas opened his mouth to place the last bite of his pie on his tongue. He had loved pie his whole life, but never before has he wanted to be pie. Man, he wanted to be pie.
“I’ve got blockers on.”
“Yeah, alright. The rules of this game are that you can’t talk, you can’t touch me or yourself, and you keep your eyes on me. Don’t give me the head tilt confusion look. You'll enjoy this, Angel. And if, for any reason you want to stop, you can always say so. Alright?”
"Do not leave me. Please. There is a guy walking over here, and it's not Dean! Oh, I wish it were Dean"
“Bitch.”
"Charlie?"
"Good deal."
How I love you, baby”
"Umm. Listen Cas, my roommate, and I both have a lot of social anxiety. He really wouldn't do well with me just showing up with you. I'll go get him and we can go. He's a great guy, just... it's just better if he meets you down here first. Alright?"
"Cas....come on dude."
“Fuuuuckk! Yes!!”
I never knew
"Crap."
Cas nodded and was a willing subject as Dean arranged him on a pillow, sliding Cas’ hands underneath it, telling him to grip it tight.
"Why didn't you tell me, Cas? Maybe I can switch classes."
They had stopped at a small neighborhood store a few hours later, to grab something cold to drink and some snacks. He was standing outside drinking his water, inhaling the faint scent of his Mate that they had been chasing around campus and the surrounding neighborhood. He hoped the cold water would cool off his inner omega. He could feel it pacing furiously at his inability to find his Alpha so far.
Cas whispered the last part in her ear. He had noticed the guy walking towards him with his eyes locked on him and not Charlie. The guy was looking at him as if he were prey. He didn't like it, not one little bit.
“Shut up, jerk.”
“Got it in one, Stretch. Cas has some property our grandfather left him and he has a few hives going. He wants to live there permanently when he has finished school. He would living there, now, if it wasn’t for me.”
Cas began doing some breathing exercises that Miss Donna had taught him. He ever grateful for Missouri recommending her. He had been in therapy when he was younger but when he started kindergarden his parents decided that school and Jody were enough to help him. Jody didn't agree but there were somethings his parents were stubborn about.
"Text me when you're done."
Charlie showed up after two cups of tea each along with several hours of studying. Dean loved that when they were both just reading, they ended up sitting next to each other on the bed. He loved feeling the heat from Cas up against his side, or when he would fidget around before gently laying his legs over Dean's to get closer. Dean never was a cuddly type person. He loved hugs, absolutely, but whenever he and Sammy would end up sitting together to watch t.v., Dean always wanted his own blanket, and space enough to stretch out without touching his nerdy little brother. These days he thinks he would have withdrawal symptoms if he didn't snug up with Cas at least once a day. Thanksgiving break was going to suck.
He could hear the laughter in her voice but he knew her well enough now to know that she was not truly making fun of him. Since the day he had met Charlie in their freshman english class she had decided that he was hers. He really did like her and he sorta liked her girlfriend Dorothy. They weren't SoulMates but were just enjoying each other's company for now.
"Wha...what Dean?"
"Everyone knows that Cas has been my best friend from the day we met on the first day of our freshman year. Where he is, I wanna be. He's been there when I laugh, when I get mad, when I get hurt, and when I cry. He's always there and I'm so thankful for you Cas. I need you to know that this song is for you. I'm in love with you, Cas."
"Shut up, Charlie and study."
“Hmm.”
"Let go. You do not have my consent to touch me."
"What did you lie about?"
"I am."
It seemed like it took forever to get Cas to their dorm, up to their room, and inside the door. A sleeping Angel was a pain in the butt to maneuver that's for sure. Dean had a smile on his face the entire time, cause ya' know, it was his Angel his was maneuvering. After getting him laid out on the bed Dean groaned. Seeing Cas spread out, in the mini skirt, in the boots and knowing that he had to at least remove those heels for Cas to be able to sleep.
"Sorry, but come on Cas, talk to me."
"Cool."
"Yeah. I just wanted to check with you."
I never knew
Crap.
"My morning class been cancelled. You wanna meet me at the library and we can go get a bite?"
Just as Cas was leaning in to tell this drunk that he was going to hurt him so severely that he would never be able to ejaculate again, Cas saw him. He saw Dean. He saw his Dean! Cas finished his threat in the guy's ear, shoving him away. He shook off Charlie by turning to tell her 'Dean!!', before he took off stumbling towards Dean. He saw the instance that Dean realized that Cas was moving towards him. Cas watched the tension leave Dean's shoulders and His smile bloomed on his face. The smile that was only for Cas. It was tender, it was sweet, it was sexy as hell, and it was all for him.
When the clippers go silent there’s a moment where Dean just stares at Cas in the mirror, her eyes tracing over the newly shorn head of an angel, before locking eyes with Cas.
“I’m gonna go grab a broom.”
She threw a pack of beer and a pint of ice cream into her arms. She passed through the small hygiene isle, eyes skimming over the pregnancy tests and condoms before landing on a small hair clipper. It was 15 bucks, expensive for her budget but cheap for these sorts of things. Something in her says “grab it”.
Stepping back he patted the Moose on the cheek.
“I ripped the pillow.”
“I was just thinking. Wondering if my mate is a student, or just someone who lives around here. I will not believe my mate is a runner or jogger. Whatever you call it, the only reason I would run is if something is chasing me.”
Just as he knelt down to start undoing the many straps on Cas's boots, the boy sat straight up, looked at Dean with wide eyes, and the proceeded to vomit all over the floor between them.
Cas smiled as Dean shoved the chair back and crawled onto the bed to lay next to him, wrapping Cas in a tight hug, just the way they liked. He snuggled in deep with his head under Dean’s chin. They lay still, just enjoying the contact for a few minutes, before he felt Dean grab his ass cheek and give it a hard squeeze, pulling their hips flush and letting their cocks just barely rut together. When Cas went to grind up against him, Dean pulled his hips back.
"What, Sammy. What's going on?"
"Course it does."
Dean kicked at him while Sam just laughed his head off. Once he had learned how Dean felt about Cas he loved to tease him about it. He never did it around Cas for which Dean was very thankful. His brother could be a pain in his ass but he always had his back. They were closer than a lot of siblings were since they had lost their parents.
I never knew
Dean finally takes a breath to look at Cas. He can see a bit of confusion and shock on his face at Dean talking about him. He gives him a smile before continuing.
All the things that people face
"Be still, Dean. I need to make sure that this smile is just so and you're not helping."
"Nah, smelled the coffee. Plus, ya' know..."
“Dean, it’s gonna be alright. Hell, better than alright! Your Alpha is here! You realize that means once you find him, you don’t have to leave! We can be close!”
"You want me to wear womens panties?"
"All we can do is keep our eyes on her and make sure she knows that we'll be here if she needs us. Here, try this before I doctor it up so I'll know how much honey you need"
I really never knew
"I thought you were going with Cas?"
"Yeah, I'll be right down."
"So you've said, Ash. So you've said. Max already gone this morning?"
"I know you do, Cas."
"What are you talking about Charlie? I have never said that I...."
"Huh?"
“No, no, Angel. Put those hands back up there or I stop. Do you want me to stop? I didn’t think so. I think this is going much better than what I had originally planned. I like hearing how your voice gets soft when you get so turned on. It makes my cock rock hard when you get so lost in how I touch you, and all you can do is whimper. Damn, Babe. You as close as I am?”
"Um...just to make sure. You know that since we're going to be dressed as a couple people will assume that we are there together."
Cas opened his eyes when he heard a breathless ‘son of a bitch’ from Dean. Dean was looking down at where he was buried in Cas. He could the tell his orgasm was close because of the shivers down his spine, he just needed...
Dean stopped as the breeze brought the alpha’s scent to him. It was coming from the south; the way they had just come from! Damn alpha was backtracking. Once he told Sam where it was coming from, he could see the Moose thinking hard.
Cas's jaw drops as he registers what Dean has said just as Sammy begins to play and Dean begins to sing.
“Dean. Please, I need you to touch me.”
Cas had been so surprised when Dean had asked him on a date after he had been at the bunker for a month or so. He had always known that he was in love with the hunter, but he never thought he stood a chance. Dean had been shy and nervous asking him, but when Cas said yes, he winked at him before strutting away with those damn bow legs.
Cas gave her a big smile before glancing at the front door again.
“Next time, we really need to make sure we know how many vamps we are moving on.”
"Sit down, Dean."
"Yeah. My roommate and I were going to go get some breakfast, let me go get him."
“Thanks Gabe. See ya’ in a few days. Sammy, I need you to call John. I’m not going back. Alright?”
As soon as Cas closed the door to the bathroom he buried his head in his hands in mortification. He couldn't believe he had woken up with his cock pressed against Dean. He could only hope that he was still out of it enough not to have noticed. Dean wasn't too functional before coffee. Speaking of which he could just catch the scent of coffee which meant he needed to get in the shower and get moving. He really didn't want to be late again, especially since Dean was wonderful enough to make sure he got up on time.
"Dean?"
“Huh?”
Cas was exhausted. Sitting next to Dean in the diner booth, he couldn’t help but lay his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder with a deep sigh. Dean didn’t stop talking to Sam, but he leaned down to place a kiss on his temple.
Cas felt the blush bloom on his face while noticing the shy way Dean was looking at him. Well, isn't that something. Learn something new all the time. He just hoped he remembered tomorrow.
"I think you should. If it's just you two talking, I think it would be too easy for you to back out. If you are doing something in front of everyone, there's no way to stop. It will be out there and you will see that I'm right. He loves you too, Dean. I'll even help."
As they walk down the hall they begin arguing, again, over the fact that Cas always used that quote wrong. It was an old argument. Cas did it just to but him after learning that Dean loved Shakespeare. God, Dean loved the nerd.
Cas grabbed Dean's hand that was picking at a loose thread on their comforter. When they decided to 'try' this arrangement on a daily basis, like three days after they met, they went out to buy a larger comforter. They pushed their beds together and bought all new bedding. It was heavenly, or maybe what was heavenly was just being able to be this close to Dean. The bedding was dark blue flannel sheets but the comforter is a white down filled deliverer of warmth. The heat was not reliable in this dorm and they needed it. Dean's parents didn't even bat an eye at the extra $300 expense for bedding, his Dad went so far as to make sure that Cas was happy with the arrangement. He didn't think he had ever blushed so much in his life.
“Cas,” Dean made sure that they had eye contact before continuing.
"Yes, Honey."
“You enjoying what you see, Angel?”
“But what? Oh, I see.” He saw Dean’s eyes widen when he turned around and saw that he had slid his hand into his sleep pants so he could stroke himself while admiring his man’s ass.
"I have a question or two for you Charlie, and I know you aren't going to be around after our classes."
“I wonder if your Alpha is following your scent?”
Charlie had backed them into a corner. There was no more room for her to pull him back and this guy was just following along still not letting go. Cas was done. He was so done with this. He was going to get rid of him, grab Charlie and find his green-eyed devil. He really needed some Dean time.
"He has a skype session with Missouri today that was rescheduled from yesterday. He will text me when he's done so we can grab the pizza and go back."
"Do you?"
He decided to use some of Cas's shampoo again. He liked catching a sniff of the apples that reminded him of his angel throughout his mornings. It kept him focused until they were back together at lunch time. In the afternoons he forced himself to not think of Cas at all. Unless you counted the many times he looked at Cas's picture on his phone, but ya' know, he didn't.
"Dean. I think I'm still drunk."
"Shut up. You had your chance to talk, it's my turn."
Opening another beer Dean leaned against the counter hoping to gather the courage to go looking for Cas, he noticed that the guy who ran into him was still standing there staring at him.
“While your schtick is cute, let’s get on with this. Cas, well, he’s going into rut and I’m thinking Dean-o here is gonna go into heat pretty quickly. Cassie isn’t as weird as he thinks he is, he just had a lot of crap shoved in his head that I've been working on getting out for years. I think the love of his omega will help. Yeah?”
"What is it?"
"Like I said, I'm fine here. Waiting for my friends, besides, I'm positive you're not my SoulMate."
"Hello, Dean."
"What?"
"I am. Thank you for making sure I don’t worry. I really appreciate everything..."
Until it came from you
"Come on, Angelboy. Let's get you home and tucked in."
"Sure, let's go with that. I gotta run, got class in half an hour. Catch you guys tonight for dinner?"
He heard the laughter behind Dean's whisper and turned to look towards him. There was just enough light coming in from the windows that he was able to see his eyes. They got lost staring into each other eyes, which he could admit that they do a lot. A lot. Cas realized that their roommate relationship was much different than anyone else's, that he had noticed. Max and Ash that lived next door were great friends but they were nowhere near as close and Dean and he were. The four of them had met the day he and Dean had gone to the bookstore and became friendly when they helped their neighbors move in.
"What?" Cas is asking, like this simple solution is somehow the most insane thing either have done when they've both stopped the literal, biblical apocalypse.
Dean went to speak before a voice came from t
“Find a life? This is our life, Sam”
She's still in the clothes from the laundromat, but now they're sticking to her like a second skin. Her stomach reminds her it's empty at regular intervals, like she somehow didn't already know. She doesn't want to hate being human, these are in fact the beings she rebelled for…
"I don't think I can do this Dean."
“It’s just a haircut Sammy” Dean says, trying to smile against the tension seeping into the room. Sam just shrugs, wiping her nose on the front of her teeshirt.
It's a strange thing being human. There's so much that she had just never considered. Like how people smell, how
Dean scrambles for something a reason, a lie, besides the truth that she
She grabbed her wallet and counted her cash, $200 dollars plus some change. She had one credit card left from their last hunt, but the likelihood that it would be declined was high enough. Enough for a motel and a beer tonight, she could figure out the rest tomorrow.
"Ok it looks pretty knotted, but we're gonna try and detangle it ok" Dean says, and Cas just nods.
Showering is a process, Cas is learning, with a variety of steps that are supposed to go in an order? She attempted to use Sam's shea moisture shampoo, but quickly realized detangling it would be a lot more work than she was up to. Dealing with her hair wasn't ever a priority, not really. When she took Jamie Novak as a vessel, her hair just sort of stayed fine- her grace took care of maintaining the neat bob like it was the day she came down to earth. Sometimes it had gotten messed up, but with her luck it seemed like she'd die before it became noticeably a problem, and every time she came back her hair sort of reset to ‘manageably not messy’.
"Hey, it's not a bad look" Dean is saying, plugging in her set of clippers and holding them up for Cas to see.
“Go enjoy your dinner
There’s so much Dean wants to say, in the tiny Gas n’ Sip in the middle of nowhere, and Dean only knows how to say one thing.
“Fuck you Dean”
Someone who wasn’t fucking girls and selling her soul to save the sister she couldn’t save the first time around. Someone who wouldn’t let her Mom die like that.
“I didn’t want it getting in the way on hunts” She says, and even she’s a little convinced by it. Because that’s easier, isn’t it?
But without her grace Castiel was rapidly realizing how easy it was for human hair to get disastrous.
With the stitches in place the pain finally started to dull (after choking down some ibuprofen, because Mom wouldn’t let Dean share in her whiskey based pain management just yet). Mary meant to move Dean to the bed but Dean, in a rare moment of teenage petulance, brushed her off. Chosing instead to look at her bare head in the mirror.
“You look good Cas” Dean says, and Cas knows if she were still an angel she could count the heartbeats between them, but instead all Cas hears is silence. She wants to say something, doesn’t know what she was going to say.
She calls Bobby and he’s there picking her up (though she can tell he doesn’t believe it’s her).
She looks at her hair, in two braids trailing down onto her shoulders, like she used to do for Sam.
Evidently, she wasn’t good enough to take the shot, even though training and instinct should have all kicked in.
Dean keeps looking at herself in the mirror. Aside from the wound on her head, the haircut is striking. Her hair’s a short peach fuzz- almost military, like the pictures Mom kept of her Dad’s marine days. But the lack of greasy blonde hair makes her face sharper, more mature. She almost likes it, even though she knows it won’t make her anymore popular in the fall.
Cas looks at her with that signature squint, cocking her head like she always does and she’s asking, “What are you doing here?” but all Dean can seem to think about is how long Cas’ hair has gotten. It looks soft, a few inches long and starting to curl at the nape of her neck. It finally hits Dean that time has passed, that Cas is
“Alrighty then” Dean says as the clippers start whirring.
"Let me help you" Dean says, standing up.
Sam- who buried her. Sam, who she died for. Sam, who hasn’t talked to Bobby in months.
Dean looks at herself in the mirror in Bobby’s bathroom and her fingers dance over the red hand marred across her shoulder. The handprint is smaller than hers, fitted neatly under where she lays her own palm so that for a moment, it seems like there’s no scar there at all. She looks whole, unnervingly whole. The scars that she’d collected over the years, bites, and burns and bullet holes, all gone, untouched. She wonders, jokingly, if the ‘restoration’ job applies to her virginity. Re-hymenated at 30, that’s what going to hell got her. She presses the pads of her fingers to her scalp, where there used to be a raised scar hiding beneath her hair. Her fingers trail across smooth skin. Whoever it was certainly didn’t miss a spot.
“You’re such a jerk” Sam said, but Dean could hear a smile in her voice. At least that was the same.
Her hair is darker now than when she was a kid, going from gold to a sort of wheaty blonde. She’s kept it in a low ponytail out of her face since it grew back and was long enough to do so. After that when it got too far down her back she’d just cut the ends herself. Dean really didn’t have much time to care what it looked like these past few years, with helping Sam get into college and holding down the fort while Mom was on hunts.
"I'm sorry Dean- I don’t know why it's such a big deal."
Dean took the clippers and plugged them into the sink’s outlet. The clippers whirred to life and she brought the blades close against her skull.
Dean clears her throat.
When Naomi pulled had pulled Cas out of purgatory, she apparently had opinions on Castiel's hair, and she showed up with it pulled back into a neat bun that again, her grace always seemed to keep in place.
When they meet the angel, Castiel, she is shorter than Dean, with delicate hands wrapped around the knife Dean’s just lodged in her chest.
She thinks about how she let her hair grow out when she was with Sam once Mom went missing. It was more practical, letting it grow out. She lacked the time to get it cut, and there was something comfortable about letting it get long again, like when Sammy was still a teen and Dean was still someone to look up to, someone to be proud of.
Dean notices that she has a voyeur, seeing Sam. perched outside the small flickering bathroom. Her sister doesn’t look at her, instead picking at the carpet with tears in her eyes.
She’s not that girl anymore, if the wavering memories of fire and pain clouding in at the edges of her thoughts have anything to say about it.
Instead of hesitating, like Cas thinks she would if she were alone, Dean just dives right in to shaving Cas’ head. Around her feet Cas watches her hair fall to the ground in long stripes. Dean cuts it quite short all around. It’s not a professional haircut or anything, but Cas doesn’t complain. She instead feels weightless, one less thing to worry about when it comes to being human.
to do this.
The only time she'd had really had to deal with it was when Dean brushed it out for her in Purgatory. In her time alone her hair had gotten long, drooping past her shoulders.
She places her stuff down on the conveyor belt and hands the minimum wage worker the credit card.
breathe.
Mary stood above her with the scissors, chopping quickly trying to even out the hasty job she’d made of her daughter’s hair. Her face is pale, stern, and she does anything but look Dean in the eyes.
"I didn't brush it" Cas admits, setting down the reheated burrito she had been focused on digesting.
"Ha, I guess." Dean looks at Cas again, making eye contact in the mirror. "So why don't we keep trying."
“Yeah, later” Dean said, ‘love you’ hanging on her tongue as the phone clicked off.
When she was done she brought her hands against her close cropped skull. All that was left was a thin veneer of fuzz. Dean tan her hands over her head, far cooler to the touch than she expected. Cool enough to distract from the hot tears pooling on her face.
