"I could simply ask them to send me the file." Carl said with a little shrug, "I can give you a copy." he said and Sherlock smiled, "That'd be great, actually." he said and grinned at John. "While you're at it, is there any chance you can get Rosie's file too? Rosie Bane. And Timothy Carter?" he asked and Carl frowned, "Sure but.. Wait, you think it's a serial killer?" he asked and sighed, "Looks like it, yeah." Sherlock said, not wanting to say too much about it just yet.
John moved to get up behind him and stretched a bit, before following Sherlock out of their bedroom. Meanwhile Charlie was busying herself with making four hot cups of mint (it's Christmas!) tea, keeping an eye on her sister.
"Let's tell them then. Looking at it from that perspective there's really not much that'd speak against it." John ate the last bit of his croissant. "I'm sure Clara and Mycroft will be incredibly happy too. Do you think she's already contacted them?"
"You know.... I could have it healed in a minute.." Sherlock said and smiled at John giving a small shrug, "I mean.. I don't even have to taste it, if you don't want to, I could just apply my saliva with a cotton bud, that would do the trick just as well." he offered, taking the towel from John and wrapping it tightly around the cut. "Although you'd get a faint impression what the high feels like, so.. probably better sit down for a moment then."
"Well, I thank you for that." John commented with a smirk and waited for Sherlock in the door frame.
"I know, right?" Charlie smiled and sat back. "I think I'm onto something with him. He's nice in all the right ways, you know?”
"Yeah, exactly." Charlie said with a grin. "Good observation." She said and looked down for a moment. "You know, I'm really happy were family, Rosie.”
Just to be safe, Sherlock injected John with the second injection just a few minutes later, before he took his hand again, smiling a little when some colour returned into his cheeks, not much yet, but he definitely didn't look as white as a sheet anymore.
John smiled back and walked with him through the kitchen into their bedroom. "Damn, I can't wait to take your clothes off." He said with a smirk.
Smiling at that, Sherlock tilted his head a little, "And what have you been thinking about?" he asked, still caressing her sweaty hair.
Sherlock sighed when they finally had found their places in the first class of their plane (three hours later) and stored away their luggage on the overhead lockers, "God, I had forgotten how much of a struggle commercial flights are.." he said, leaning back in his seat, "I should have asked Mycroft for his jet." he mumbled with a roll of his eyes.
"I suppose..." Sherlock said and smirked at John, "Any specific reason, you're so eager for her to learn to knock?" he asked with a cheeky grin.
"Yeah, while you were out grocery shopping I just went ahead and got children. Surprise!." John said with a bit of a laugh. "Don't worry, I'd have texted you if I had gone out."
"Doesn't feel like I will.." Sherlock said and cuddled up to John again, "You got some more of that aspirin?" he asked after a moment of silence.
Parking the car in front of the orphanage, Sherlock turned off the engine and turned a bit to look at the others, "I suppose I'll go in and get Rosie, doesn't really make sense for all of us to go."
"Hm, good thing you adopted them." Viktor said with a smile. He didn't know to much about highly gifted children, less so that there were even IQ tests for children. Apparent they did serve a proper purpose.
"Oh, don't look so mortified." Sherlock said with a smile, ruffling her hair a little, "He is quite cute." he said and chuckled a little, "But don't tell John, I said that, he's already jealous enough."
"I can fit you into much tighter things than my schedule, so that shouldn't be a problem." Sherlock said with a smirk, snuggling closer up against John.
"Don't worry, I'd refuse to do that too." Sherlock said and chuckled, shaking his head, "That would suggest that I'd want him near me for a considerable amount of time which is definitely not the case." he said and smirked at John, "And what's wrong with a pink princess room when it's a room for two little princesses?" he asked with a laugh.
Rosie nodded happily, "I dreamed something really exciting! But I can't really remember, but I know there were pretty dresses and ladybug men!" she said and chuckled.
"No, I think you misunderstood something, John." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "Biting someone normally doesn't feel particularly good for the vampire... but it does feel really very good when you and the person you bite have sex while you're doing it, I figured you've realised that even if I didn't say it so clearly before."
"Been a while.." Sherlock said as he unbuckled his seatbelt, "Meaning this as an actual question rather than a side blow, when have you been here the last time?" he asked, looking at his brother.
"That's what worries me in a way.. why is no one coming for her?" Sherlock asked and frowned, "They're quite eager to get Charlie.." he said and looked back at the closed bedroom door, before he looked at John again, "Why aren't they eager to get her back? Is this like a worthy and unworthy thing? If she gets caught and kidnapped or even killed.. how can they just don't do anything?" he asked and shook his head. This whole group seemed so messed up.
Charlie began to chuckle at that and smirked back. "I'll try my hardest not to in that case." She whispered as they went to the entrance. Oh, this was really exciting, she thought as they came to the reception, though she more or less kept a poker face from then on.
"Very good idea, but they need three things for that first: they need to know where to look and not smudge our fingerprints themselves, they need a fingerprint kit and they need everyone's fingerprints to compare them to." She whispered and held her hand out for Rosie to take. "And right now, they don't even know we've been in there."
"Deal." John said with a grin. Thanks to the rugby practices, he really wasn't in bad shape." I hope you've brought your wallet."
"It's fine.." Sherlock said and nearly purred at the fingers in his hair. "Not like you could do much but maybe pouring me a glass of... water.." he said and smirked at John, leaning in for another kiss, not too eager to leave him even just for a few minutes.
John chuckled softly. "Yeah, I think we can." He said and took Sherlock's hand. "She's spend the whole day up here if you can believe it." John said, though not that he was complaining; that way he hadn't had to run back and forth between them.
John chuckled a little at the way Sherlock had looked at him and how accurately Harry's description was (for that moment). "We actually did have Italian pasta yesterday. Sherlock learned how to make it from a housebreaking restaurant owner." John said with a grin, finding that story just perfect.
"Morning.." Sherlock said and yawned again, "Anyway, merry belated Christmas. I didn't really want to give this to you with everyone around, especially Paul and Amber, it would have given the wrong impression." he said and held the small box out to her - intentionally doing it with his left hand, wondering if she'd spot the ring on it, they had decided to wait until after the holidays to tell the family, since they'd all be coming over for his birthday again anyway. But since he was here now, there was no reason not to tell her.
"Especially when you consider that John's grandfather and I have been good friends since long before any of my family members met any of his." Sherlock said and shook his head with a chuckle, "Well at least none of my family members is married to him." he added with a smirk.
"I don't mind, daddy usually cleans it!" Rosie said with a happy grin as Scout gave her his other paw too, "I think he wants to dance!" she chirped.
Vanessa smiled at that. "Yes, I think it's wonderfully someone actually gets to wear it after me." She said, obviously not having thought that possible until recently. John nodded. "Well, there isn't too much of a story to Sherlock's, I have to admit. I just.. I don't know, looked at it at the jewellers and was reminded of that time we were studying in the park last summer. I mean, we hadn't been together at that point yet, but I can still remember when a bee climbed onto your finger and you just watched it for a while.. You looked so content and.. at peace." He said and gave his fiancé a smile, wondering if he could see it too. "I couldn't really not get it."
Sherlock chuckled, "Well, I'm not. Our little live-in spies packed your suitcase over the week, which is why you couldn't find part of your clothes." he explained with a smirk, "The girls are staying with my mum until Saturday and they'll spend Saturday night with Mrs Hudson, and the three of them will pick us up from the airport on Sunday evening. Oh and I called your work. Jim agreed to take your shifts as a sort of thank you for introducing him to Dennis." he said and chuckled again.
Charlie began to walk with Jane back to her cottage. "Jane, can I ask you a question? Is the older Sherlock very different from your young one?"
"Yeah, I don't really get that either." John said with a chuckle and began to trace shapes across Sherlock's back. "But I'm sure Charlie will figure that one out for herself."
John chuckled and shook his head. "You're way too good at this. Anyway, yeah, you should've thought of it. But if I'm the reason anyway, it's only fair if I have the decency to remind you then, I guess." He said with a bit of a smile. "And better now than there."
"Hey, guys. Ron's here." Charlie said with a smile as she led him inside the living room. "Oh, hello again" John said with a smile and put his phone away. "How are you doing?"
"Right.. good." John nodded and let out a sigh. "That gives us some time. Are you going to try and talk to the Tech guy tomorrow too?" He asked. "I mean, we can be quite sure he's dangerous if he somewhat looks like the man on the picture Charlie found."
"We have to bring her the sheet anyway remember?" Rosie asked and chuckled, "Can we dress really pretty for the photo?" she asked, looking up at Charlie.
"The way you're holding yourself, mainly. That and .. I've met a fair share of military people, eventually one gets an eye for it." Sherlock said and thought of Viktor for a moment, "My fiance is actually going to join the service soon too." he said and sighed, "Not that I'm a fan of that idea." he said and shrugged.
"To be honest, I'm a little nervous too," Sherlock said with a small laugh, "So is John, so we're all in the same boat, I think. It's a new situation for all of us."
Sherlock chuckled, "I don't know.. perhaps the fact that I'm a vampire would distract them successfully from the fact that their son is in a homosexual relationship." he said with another laugh. "You could start the conversation off like, hey mum, dad, this is my boyfriend, he's a vampire." he said jokingly as they walked down the stairs and left the building.
"And making them orphans." John said and shook his head. "Why would anyone want to do that?"
When Sherlock woke up to the smell of coffee - let's face it, the smell of coffee in the morning definitely trumped the smell of blood, even for a vampire - he couldn't help but smile, "Morning.." he murmured, looking up at his fiancé.
Charlie grinned a bit, since it was quite special to be allowed on the streets alone (even if Sherlock was keeping an eye on them). Especially since she was responsible for Rosie now. "Come on then." She smiled and helped Rosie out of the car and brought her to Mrs. Hudson. Four minutes later she got back into the car, though she got into the passenger seat this time. "There you go." She smiled and handed him the keys.
When Sherlock arrived at the orphanage that morning, he was quite nervous about telling Charlie about the recent developments, not so much about Rosie, he was quite sure that for her it'd be a big adventure, but Charlie? He just worried having to go back would hit her harder than it would Rosie. Especially with the added pressure that the two were in serious danger. Shaking his head to clear his mind a little (after all he had a class to focus on), he went to hang up his coat in the teacher's lounge.
About ten minutes later a different nurse unlocked the door and stepped inside. "Hello, I'm Ted. I'll show you to the showers and then you can get dressed." He said and waited for William to stand up. "You can keep your sheet if you need it. Can you walk and shower by yourself?"
Sherlock smirked at John, "I'm surprised he said that after I've just told him I'm most likely going to marry you." he said and chuckled a little, running a hand through his hair.
Sherlock returned just two minutes later with a corset, a white gown, a pair of shoes and a small navy blue jacket for Charlie. "Alright then, I think your dress really does work as an undergown for this." he said and spread the clothes on the bed, revealing a little box as well, containing a hairbrush and some ties and hair clips. "I'll just quickly do your hair. You won't believe how often Jane made me do it for her so I should get a usual hairstyle done, but don't expect a work of art." he said, steering Charlie over to the bed, feeling somewhat rushed since his father could come back any time, but he was likely to give them half an hour at least instead of his usual seven minutes.
Viktor raised an eyebrow but complied, so a few seconds later, he was right at Fay's feet, sniffing her legs curiously and wagging his tail. Fay couldn't hold back a bit of a smile and reached out with her free hand (hadn't the tall one said she could get both hands freed?) to pet him. Cute. And she calmed down (which was only to their disadvantage, because she could think more clearly. Ha.) Meanwhile John gave Sherlock a smirk, seeing how his trick seemed to work.
"I'm sure that's going to be fun." John said and huffed a laugh. "I was actually talking about uni classes. It's hard to keep track of all of those classes we're taking or giving."
John raised an eyebrow at that, because she should know him well enough to guess the answer to that question. "I'm just accompanying you, sweetheart. The rest is your responsibility. Come here, there are plastic bags in that shelf right here." He told her, though not unkindly.
"Nearly 1L still a bit to go.." Sherlock said and gave John's hand a little squeeze, "Don't worry I'll have an eye on the cup." he said and smiled at John, "Still sure?" he asked softly.
"Cool!" Rosie said and walked over to their beds, "It's like camping!" she said and chuckled, "Can we roast marshmallows in the fireplace?" she asked hopefully and Harry laughed, "I don't know." she said and pointed in the direction of the kitchen, "Maybe you should go and look through the shopping bags in the kitchen if we brought some." she said and Rosie nodded happily, "Okay! Charlie, come!" she said, dropping her backpack, before taking Charlie's hand and pulling her into the direction Harry had gestured to.
Emma smiled, wrapping her arms around her granddaughter (now that felt a little weird to think, truth to be told she felt a little too young to be a grandmother, but he still loved the girls like one already), "Hello dear," she said and looked up at John, before she hugged him as well, just before hugging Sherlock, "And hello you two." she said, looking around, "Oh, where's our little detective?" she asked, a little disappointed she didn't get to see both girls.
"Sure he would." Sherlock said and chuckled a little at her expression.
Sherlock chuckled, emptying his glass and standing up to rinse his mouth, "Actually.. I was kind of thinking I could spice up some of that lasagna again for Richard..." he said and smiled a little at John. "I ate half of yours anyway, so we could have dinner together.." he said as he grabbed the mouthwash and rinsed his mouth.
"Yeah.. even if not, I mean, you've had every right to obviously." John said. "Was it obvious? The jealousy I mean. It runs in the family if you hadn't noticed." He gave a wry smile. "You know, it's hard not to think everyone around us wants a piece of you."
"I wasn't sick that much until like a while ago." Charlie said in between sips. "Maybe it's because we're outside more?" She asked in between sips, leaning into her father. "Hm, I don't know. The air on the streets is a bit polluted, but at the same it's the middle of summer. I think a check-up would really be a good idea, just to be sure." John said and Charlie sighed. "Can we do that on another day, though, please?"
John gave Sherlock a shocked look, before forcing himself calm for the sake of his cousins. "Here, there you go, princess." He said and gave Amy the glass back, though he kept his hand on it so that she wouldn't spill even more. This couldn't be true... Jesus Christ. "Sherlock, is Mrs. H downstairs?" He needed to talk to his boyfriend. Right now. Meanwhile Amy accepted that and continued to happily drink her tomato juice, though she did notice that the two men weren't alright. "Are you okay?" She asked after a while over a glass.
Lifting Rosie back onto her chair, Sherlock gave her a smile, "You can't just give him some of your food without asking Viktor first, okay?" he asked and Rosie frowned, "Why?" she asked and thought that giving him some food would be a nice thing to do, so she didn't know why she had to ask, "Because some human foods aren't healthy for dogs." Sherlock explained as he sat down, "For instance, you might think if you had chocolate, you might think it would be nice to share it with him, but chocolate is very unhealthy for a dog, but he would still eat it because he doesn't know. So we humans have to make sure dogs don't eat what's not good for them."
Rosie was incredibly excited as she put on her shoes and jacket, trying to be really really quiet because she wanted to surprise them all! She'd go and get cake, she had almost saved 10 pounds now, that was a lot and cake couldn't be that expensive, right? Grabbing her piggy bank, she put it into her school bag and sneaked down the stairs and took the emergency key from under the doormat to unlock the front door, before she walked out of the house. She had memorised the way to the baker at the end of the street and she knew she could do this. And then they'd all have cake for breakfast! Even though it was a little scary, because it was still a bit dark, but not as dark as at night, so it seemed okay.
"It really doesn't suit me." Sherlock said and chuckled, shaking his head, "And no.. I don't think we should ridicule vampires just before we're trying to tell them there are some which reminds me that we don't even need the garlic allergy excuse." he said and remembered that they wanted to tell them anyway.
"Quiet, once the girls fell asleep at least." Sherlock said and sighed, "Honestly, you'd think they'd be over the worst by now, but.. they aren't, to be honest, this is more like a regular flu.. it progresses extremely slow for a vampire." he said as he started to walk up the stairs.
John shook his head but relaxed a bit when Sherlock kissed him. "You two are perfect for each other." He commented and Charlie laughed a little. "Yeah, I agree, Sherlock."
"So basically you want to change schools?" Sherlock summarised with a smile, "Is it far away?" he asked, though security did sound good in the current situation, he was still with Greg in the primary grades, so he didn't have his eye on her all day long anyway.
Sherlock chuckled, "Yeah, it really does sound good." he said and smiled at John, "And next year in February we'll all have the exact same names."
John bit back another sigh and just pecked Sherlock's temple instead. They'd all get through this somehow, he knew they would.
Sherlock smiled a little, before turning to the door when he heard footsteps on the stairs along with giggles, before the door opened, "Papa! I did it! I picked up Scouts poo poo and it wasn't even as icky as I thought!" she said as she basically hopped into the room. Well.. so much for that dampening her wish to get a dog.
"I get a dress too?" Rosie asked wide-eyed, now even more eager to get a look into the bags.
David clenched his jaw. "I'd say that's quite obvious, isn't it?" Vanessa gave him a mild smile. "I can tell you that it's really not. And I know you're not into this 'therapy talk', so I really just want to talk to you. No hidden agenda." She said, giving a bit of a smile. "But for that to happen I need to understand your reasons." David gave a tense sigh and nodded; that sounded reasonable. She waited for patiently for his reply. When it came David did his best to sound angry rather than hurt. "He hasn't shown any interest in me my entire life. I don't want to see him."
"Heavens, three weeks?" Violet asked him, looking with shocked, before going to the reasons why he could've ended up there; he'd either told someone about vampirism or his homosexuality... Heavens, she had a good idea what a sanatorium looked like like back then.. "How did you get out of there again?"
"Uh.. no. We allowed Charlie to have a bit of wine with blood and yeah.. her alcohol tolerance doesn't seem to be particularly high.." Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes, "It's that or she's sneaked more wine than we allowed, but she was very cheery last night. Not so cheery when she woke up briefly this morning.." he said and chuckled a little, it felt a little weird though, that suddenly his mother and him had children - almost the same age too.
"Ah, you're Violet's boy! I could've sworn you looked familiar." Greg said with a bright smile and took his hand to pull him into a short one-armed hug, patting him on his back twice. "Pleasure to finally get to meet you."
"Hold on a second, how many famous authors do you know?" Charlie asked disbelievingly. Sherlock must have lived quite a life. "You have to let me read your memoirs!"
"Kay" Charlie said with a smile, giving his hand a warm squeeze. This moment was so pure... "Thanks for bringing tea today."
"Okay Rosie, how about you go play a bit? Sammy could do with some company right now." She told her; she always liked to pair Sammy off with quiet children, since was a little timid. Rachel then continued talking to John again. "Okay her office is just over there. Let me just take you there." She said and motioned them to follow, before turning around once more to tell Rosie. "And don't ruin the garden, alright? Greg has put a lot of effort into the flowerbed." With that she left the garden, expecting the two men to follow.
"I want that on paper." John said, leaning into the touch and resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder. "I do have my understandable moments sometimes." He said, with a bit of a smile.
"Oh damn, no, I haven't." Sherlock said and rolled his eyes about himself, "Well, we'll definitely be late if we go back home now..." he said and sighed, running a hand through his hair, "Although I guess it wouldn't be good if I sit there with a growling stomach despite getting enough to eat.. because I still get that too.."
"I'm absolutely sure you can." Charlie said with a chuckle and put the bag of toys carefully into a free corner of her bag and closed it. "You haven't seen our room there yet, have you? "
"I'm barely able to contain myself." Mycroft said and gave a sigh, his expression remaining unchanged.
"Well, while I can see your point, the situation with Ron isn't going to improve once I stop ageing in five or six years." Charlie said and pulled a bit of a face. "I mean, two years really isn't the world, but fine, let's wait for dad."
Within a second, someone had slung an arm around Charlie's upper body, covering her mouth with the other. Charlie's arms were trapped in the hold and immediately began to scream, even though it was muffled. Kicking and squirming, she tried to stop the other person from dragging her towards the street, her heart practically beating out of her chest.
"I think she forgot that when she stormed out." John said and put the clothes onto the bed, keeping an eye on the bathroom door lest she slip out and try to make a run for it. "Having heard her story, suddenly I don't feel as bad about keeping her jere anymore."
John chuckled a bit. "Yeah, they'd probably figure it out in under five minutes the way I know them." He said, shaking his head. "But you know maybe-" He broke off; if he turned, there was no way they'd stick around long enough until they could tell them. But he didn't want to think about that right now. "What's on tonight's mortal menu then, love?" He asked instead with a smile.
Violet laid her hand on her son's back while he coughed. "How about I make you a nice hot cuppa then?"
"Awesome" Charlie smiled and glanced at his lips. before cupping his cheek the way she Lowell had done it during her first kiss and brushed her thumb over his cheek (because if a kiss wasn't wanted, she'd screwed up anyway so why not do it properly; but Ron just seemed like he adorably careful, so she was probably safe). Figuring there was no point in waiting any longer, she leaned in two seconds later and softly kissed his lips.
Sherlock smiled, "Yeah, she was okay with that." he said and pulled John into his arms, "I hope your dad doesn't mind that we didn't tell him right away... I mean.. letting two weeks pass after letting them know about major things in our life was not quite what I had agreed with him when they came over to meet the girls."
"Says the one with little reindeers all over his body." John said with a chuckle. "We really need to take pictures later." He said.
"No, just Mycroft, me and Jane were turned together." Sherlock said and his head snapped up in realisation at that, "Oh you haven't met Jane, have you?" Sherlock asked and chuckled, "That's Clara's best friend.. Jane.. Austen, actually." he said and kind of liked the looks of people he got when he told them about her. "Thinking about it, I should ask her if she'd like to give English classes at the orphanage, she'd certainly be qualified, both in capability and on paper, she's a uni professor at the moment after all."
John chuckled at that. "I've got a slight feeling it's not, at least not very soon. Besides I want you back /in/side the bed in about ten minutes."
"The only thing I have done is taking two little girls in a giving them a home. Your group is who terrorises her." Sherlock said and dragged the girl over to the chair, pushing her down on it while trying not to hurt her, "Can you tie her up?" he asked, looking up at Viktor, he obviously couldn't let go of her, "Not too tight though, I really don't want to her to be hurting, but still tight enough for her not to slip out. Oh and she's a mean fighter, so make sure you don't get kicked in the face or anything."
"Oh, no we're not. But we're from the same orphanage. Rosie came up to me one day because of a break-in and, yeah, the rest is history, I guess." Charlie said with a smile.
"Noooooo." Rosie chuckled, shaking her head, "But Mrs Hope was mad at Lucas once because he was answering a call when she practised driving with him and she told him that and took his phone away for a whole month!"
John let out a sigh and looked at Sherlock, for a moment, before crouching down in front of him, unable not to glance at the ring. He swallowed, his anger having evaporated, before saying. "You really think that after all this some empty shouting could chase me away?" John gave him a weak smile. "Now you're the one being stupid."
"Let's start with that one." John said with a smile and already sat down on the sofa, while Sherlock took care of the film. While he was sitting here like that, he found that he was more than excited to get to see that footage. [cf. notes] Sherlock quickly set the projector up and pulled the screen down, before he pushed the sofa in front of the TV, "If we're staying in here longer, I should probably light up the fireplace.. it tends to become rather cold in here, especially since the window is covered." he said and grabbed a few logs, popping them into the fireplace and lighting them up.
Sherlock smiled and rested his forehead against John's, "So.. should we go to bed?" he asked with a chuckle, "I didn't sleep so well yesterday, I'm surprisingly actually tired." he said and yawned.
"Yeah," Sherlock said and laughed, "But on the other hand he's terribly good at keeping the fun parent alive, well and very happy, so I think we can let the boring thing slide." he chuckled, leaning over to peck John's cheek.
"Good, Amy." Sherlock said and smiled, "Snakes!" Ally called and smiled, liking this a lot better and it was way less confusing than what mummy had said. "They have stripes too sometimes!"
Charlie's face became red again at the thought of Sherlock having seen that... "Yeah, I can still do that later tonight though." She said and cleared her throat, a bit amazed by the fact there were fifteen brands of tampons currently her bed, just as ice cream and... "So you figured it out and bought... like everything related to periods?"
"Hm.." Sherlock murmured and leant down to pick up his shoes, putting them into his lap so he could take them with him downstairs, he didn't know how things would progress tonight so if anything happened he did want to have to deal with them on socks, there was always the possibility that they'd have to leave in a hurry with the girls after all, there was no telling what those people were planning to do with the information they received through the bug. They could just as well be waiting for Sherlock and John to go to bed so they could break in.
"Well.. at the very least take the card and keep it on you for emergencies.." Sherlock said and gave a small shrug, "And well.. so we don't have to go through the process of ordering a whole new one next year." he said with a smirk.
"Yeah well.. could have been worse, the blood was the biggest problem, really." Sherlock said and frowned, "The more or less painful therapy methods wouldn't have bothered me so much if it wasn't for the lack of blood."
Sherlock laughed, "No, he's not. Never been.." he said and shook his head, "I suppose the right partner for someone like him is not yet born." he said and chuckled again.
"Well, we were just waiting for sleeping beauty to wake up, actually." Sherlock said and smiled at Rosie, before looking back to John, "We could leave with you and drop you off at uni." he suggested.
Sherlock smiled, "Yeah.. I need to grab the tags too, just in case I really can speak openly." he said and walked into the bedroom to grab his jacket and the tags from the bedside drawer, before returning to John. "Okay let's go then." he said, taking his keys and wallet from the coffee table.
"No, still not a car and we had to return the rental before new years, so I took a cab." Sherlock said and smiled, "Is it just me or did the girls seem a little moody?" he asked and chuckled, "Long night?" he asked.
"..and then we can all fly together on our bees!" Rosie finished and chuckled a little, looking up with a smile, "John, Lock and I just imagined we're all flying on our bumble bees! That would be better than cars, because huge bees wouldn't be as dirty as cars and they could make a lot more honey, but they would need hives as big as houses!" she snickered.
"See, that's the spirit." John said with a chuckle and kissed his cheek. "And they'll probably be busy kissing each other, so that won't be a problem." He commented, though he wasn't exactly thrilled to possible see her sister snogging her wife in front of him.
"You too!" Charlie said as she watched him leave, before looking back up at her father. "So how do we get to Jane?"
John sighed. "Looks like you, but doesn't know me; that meet-up had something nightmarish to it in that regard." He said, before adding. "But apart from that it's kinda sweet to see how excited you were about your first love."
"Well let's take truth then, that's more quiet." Sherlock said with a glance at Harry and smiled.
John grinned at that. "Yeah, I suppose so. I'm already looking forward to seeing you in a suit." He chuckled. "That'll almost be the best part., well except for the tax cuts." John said teasingly giving Sherlock's hand a squeeze.
"I think it's more an on and off thing with them." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "Good eye though." he said, giving Charlie a smile.
"Yeah, Vanessa and Paul are always busy, so I think they'd just be happy for the cheap babysitters." He commented, before smiling once more. "And 'advanced early education'? You really like them, don't you?"
"Mmh, Amber mentioned that too." Charlie said and scratches her head. "As much as I love them, how she deals with two literal spies in the household on a daily basis remains a mystery to me." She commented and John shot Sherlock a small amused glance, remembering for example how two live-in spies had stolen his clothes just three days ago.
Sherlock chuckled, "I'm sure you looked adorable in those dresses." he said and pecked John's cheek again, "And after all, you did see me in a dress too, so.. it's only fair."
Sherlock smiled at that, "So.. how long until we tell her that we're alright with it?" he asked with a smirk. "20 minutes more?"
"I don't think she'll be upset or anything. The way I know her she isn't particularly resentful or anything. I think you should be the one to tell her this time though." Charlie said with a bit of a smile.
"I will..." Harry said and smiled at him, "You too. And you Sherlock." she said and pulled him into a hug as well. This family really had a thing for hugs it seemed. "See you next week." Sherlock said and watched with a smile as she got into the car and drove off.
"Alright then, if you're sure, let's see if they've got a similar one for Rosie." Sherlock said holding his arm out to help her down the stool.
"So did I. If only my lunch break was a bit longer." John said with a chuckle, before adding. "I love you."
"I can't decide between, 'Sherlock, how much money did you actually spend today?' and 'Oh, I would have expect you to go even more overboard, actually' as far as his reaction goes." Sherlock said with a chuckle.
"Really?? Mummy, can you show us that?" Amy asked, not waiting for her to answer. "Have you ever seen that? Bees sound like they're soo cute!" She said with a smile, slowly calming down again, but this was really exciting. After all she got to go and see tigers and zebras with Mummy, Ally, Lock, John /and/ an animal expert who was now her friend.
"I know where she is." Sherlock said with a smile and gestured Charlie to follow, "She used to be out in the their garden to write nearly everyday around this time of day." he said as he led Charlie towards a house that was a bit away from his own, "You need a cover identity." he said with a smirk, "How about you're my friend's sister, that friend being John. He's ridden off to find your four year old sister who ran off, so he left you in my care, but obviously we need a chaperone, so I'll ask if Jane can join us. It's incredibly indecent for a young lady to be alone with a man she hardly knows and that isn't part of the family." he said and frowned. The whole business of people marrying at young ages had always bothered him, but now having a daughter, he'd slaughter any man that would seriously intend to marry her this age.
John and Charlie got out after him and while John was talking to the cabbie, she went back to Sherlock and looked up to him. After thinking about being kidnapped by a cabbie earlier on, she'd thought of something. "Hey, Sherlock. Guess what's the best getaway car in London?"
"She- of course." He should've probably known, but that still felt like a punch to the gut. So that's why she never visited the grave. David sat down at their dinner table and waited for Richard to follow suit.
"Mycroft!" Violet said sharply. "William Sherlock Scott Holmes, you are 242 years old and should be greatful you still have a brother that loves you. I want you to apologise to Mycroft right now." She said and Mycroft rolled his eyes. "You are being ridiculous, you know that?" He said with a sigh, before being cut off by their mother. "Mycroft, be quiet."
Sherlock sighed, leaning closer and resting his head on John's shoulder. "I'll save that for when I'm really desperate." he said with a small chuckle.
"Mmh, now that you put it like that... Yeah, that'd drive me insane." John commented. "Good thing you've finally found out about that orphanage." He said, wondering how many similar vampire-run project there were out there.
"My schedule's actually packed next month." Lowell said and looked apologetically at her, "When is it exactly?" he asked, hating to disappoint her, but he couldn't help but saying no. Playing on her party was meant to be a surprise (obviously he wouldn't miss her birthday), so he couldn't agree now.
"Dennis has been talking about children since day one, so we might actually consider it." Scott said with a smile. "When I've told him about it, obviously. How did you broach the subject to John? I'm terrified of that talk to be completely honest."
"He's seen a lot in his time, this one." Viktor said and smiled a bit sadly at Scout, before patting his head. "He's very loyal too. You like dogs in general then?" He asked Sherlock after a moment.
"Let's wait for David. though." Sherlock said and gave John a smile, figuring it'd be better to tell them about it before doing anything else, just to get that over with.
Charlie couldn't suppress a smirk, having a rough idea what Rosie was thinking right now. "So you're already reading the next chapter on your own? Maybe you could read it to daddy so he doesn't miss out on it."
"Good, I'm glad." Paul said with a smile. "And you've been very pleasant patients, so thank you for that." He said before scribbling down two different prescriptions. "Okay, Sherlock, this one's for Rosie.  Give her today and tomorrow half a pill in the morning and half in the evening. Give Charlie a whole each time and stop giving them the medication after five days. If you can go to the chemist's before ten you can already give them their morning dose; the earlier they start, the milder their symptoms tomorrow will be. But after that the worst should be over." He said and handed Sherlock the prescription. "Any questions?"
"How about we'll have Shepard's pie for dinner and ice cream for desert?" Sherlock suggested and Rosie nodded, "Mhm.. that's okay too."
"What are we having for lunch today anyway?" Charlie asked him from the back. Their fridge was literally almost empty so there was technically no reason to cook one of their favourites.
"Oh..." Sherlock said and frowned a little, "But.. she doesn't anymore right? I mean.. anyone can see they're still head over heels for each other.. the way they look at each other sometimes.." Sherlock said and sighed, "It'd be sad if they'd break apart over something like that."
"I don't know.. maybe they just figured it's one orphan looking out for another." Sherlock said and shrugged, "It's not entirely unreasonable. It's not frequent enough to really be suspicious without further evidence."
Charlie took the letter and skimmed it quickly, a proud smile creeping onto her face. "Yeah, that's my girl. She's become really good, hasn't she?" She asked him with a chuckle. "What's all this of this stuff though? Did she use up all of the crayons here or what?"
"That would be awesome." Amber's eyes lit up a bit as she nodded. "Do you have a piano at your place or would you rather bring your violin round here?"
"Good. But... if you know where she is and she might be in danger, and I mean actual danger.. don't wait. I know you wouldn't if you see she's in danger, but you might hesitate if you think you're forbidden." Sherlock said and smiled a little at her when they left the house. "But that's only in a situation where you really can't wait. Everything else, you go to Jane and you will do what she says. If you really get into that situation, though, there's a church, you can see the tower from basically everywhere in town," he said, pointing at the church tower that was rather far away, but still clearly visible. "If you get lost, that's where we'll come to get you. Understood?" he asked, wanting her to confirm, just to ease his mind, "Oh and I erm... I think I stole my own money.." he said and wasn't sure if that would be actually considered theft, though he shook that thought off quickly, they had time to think about that kind of thing when they had found Rosie. "Here, that's ten pounds which is as good as about 300 pounds in our time." he said, handing her a small purse with containing some coins and notes.
"Exactly and also tomato juice and ketchup both have some salt in it too, to give it more flavour." Sherlock said and smiled at Charlie, she really did a good job with Rosie. "Oh, that makes sense!" Rosie said, satisfied with that answer as she nipped at her tomato juice again.
Sherlock chuckled and rolled his eyes, "I suppose so." he said and looked at the camera screen again, "You've got a good taste though.." he said and smirked at her, "He does look good and he's nice.. he's offered countless times to carry Mrs Hudson's groceries whenever he's seen her on the street with heavy shopping bags. She usually declines, though." he said and smiled.
John sighed once she was gone and closed the door behind her, making a memo to himself to rage about Mark's mum at a later time, when he wasn't in charge of his baby cousins anymore. "Come here, Amy." He said and lifted her up as well, before carrying them both upstairs. (He didn't want to risk any staircase-related accidents). Sitting them both down on the carpet in the living room, he crouched down next to them. "So, here we are."
Daphne Blake was a detective. A good one. Those men hadn't even seen her because she hid quickly enough, she was sure of that. She didn't think they were baddies though. They didn't look like baddies. They weren't baddies or pretending to be monsters. They did look familiar though, Daphne just couldn't really place it, but she was set on finding it out.
Melody moved into the room. She stayed in the middle of the room, knowing that going to either of them would be seen as picking aside. Sometimes it was hard having your younger sister on your team. "Alright, Alita go downstairs and start unpacking your stuff. I'll come to talk to you in a little. Ignatius, go with her."
Melody dismisses them back to doing what they were and the room slowly empties until it was just John, Sherlock, and her. She takes a seat on the couch before looking over at John.
“Thank you, Ignatius.” Alea pulls into the handicapped parking space at St. Barts and turns back to Ignatius. “Though there are some really nice battle facilities here in London. You can probably get into the competition scene if you’d want.”
Yep this is done. I started writing this in high school, re-wrote it once before it was ever posted anywhere and then I have re-rote it once since posting it, but now it is done.
Melody doesn't answer as she hears John's voice start to drift down the hall. She stands, takes her crutches, and goes to meet the rest of the group. John had Growl out walking beside him and Sherlock had Kaimana walking beside him. Lloyd joins after a few seconds.
Melody took another few seconds to appraise the fit on Sherlock, knowing that John knew how a dress uniform was supposed to fit. It was a smidge short on the sleeves, probably due to how he liked to wear his suit jackets, and just a smidgen long in the pants, but surprisingly it was the right size on his torso.
“I’ve noticed that your Porygon isn’t like the rest. Why is that?” Sherlock asks as Melody presses the up button on the elevator.
“I wonder why Moran doesn’t kill the Pokémon?” Melody mummers as she goes to pick one of them up. It opened to release a Hydreigon that looked at Melody and landed in front of her. It didn’t seem to be attacking anyone and for one of the most violent Pokémon, it was startling. Melody recalled the Hydreigon to its Pokeball before tossing the Pokeball to Nicholas.
“Because we’re almost certain that he’s using his Pokemon to start the fires,” Lestrade explains.
Once they were dropping into the underground parking lot Melody turns off both the lights and sirens. She also slows down to a reasonable speed. She stops just before the restricted parking in the bottom to wait for Lestrade to catch up. When she sees his car join hers she pulls up to it.
“I’m Brigadier General Melody Sykes of the Pokemon Investigation Police. The one over there is Lieutenant Colonel Ignatius Brown, my resident burn expert.” Melody drops her crutch off her arm and holds out her hand to shake.
He comes over to him and sits down in the only other chair. “I want to know what you are going to do about Moran?”
They drive back to Baker Street in silence. Melody leads the way up the stairs with John fast on her heels. Once inside Melody plops down on the couch and John sits beside her. Sherlock in his normal chair Lestrade in the visitor chair as Nicholas takes John’s normal chair.
Lestrade walked over and looked at the spot for a few seconds before answering, "An Arcanine head with a stick of some sort."
"Correct. Roy is so protective of me because he was my brother's partner Pokémon. Though that is the only time he's ever attacked someone without being provoked."
The Captain nods and lets the two cars through. Melody takes the closest parking spot to the underground pass and Lestrade parks beside her. They all pile out of the two cars and the Porygon goes back to sitting on Melody’s head. Melody leads the way through the underground tunnels, taking note of how they had changed in the years since she'd been down there.
Melody nodded as she pulled off her shirt revealing a white bra. Around her side, he could see the bright colors of a tattoo along with extensive scarring across her whole torso. Melody turned and lifted the edge of the bra so that he could see the entire tattoo at once. It was the basic outline of an Absol's head with a pair of bright purple forearm crutches in its mouth. Part of the tattoo had been damaged at some point, but it was obvious that's what it was.
"You have a file number?"
John just gave her a questioning look before nodding. “Why do you ask?”
"What did you want to show me?" Lestrade asked as Melody pulled off her jacket to show a plain black t-shirt.
“Nick, I’ve got some interesting information about the case that we are working.”
Melody glared at him, “Hopefully not have to kill him so I can ask him a few questions. At least at first.”
“What are you worried about?”
“Not surprised, we agreed when we got sent back here we would keep it to ourselves. Both of us have lost a lot and we didn’t need people knowing that I was connected to him. It would have just painted a larger target on both of us.”
John nodded not one hundred percent sure where she was going with her train of thought. "You had both Roy and Archer out and Roy just about attacked Moran's Infernape."
Mycroft seems to try and look through her for a few seconds before asking, "Do you think he killed your brother?"
"So, he's targeting the police now?" Alita asked as she came into the room completely dressed including the black beret and jacket.
Melody had just gotten dressed dreading what was going to happen that afternoon. It wasn't like she liked the ranking ceremony and all it entailed. Most of it would truly suck, mostly because standing for so long with only the use of her left crutch was going to send shooting pain up her legs for the rest of the night. She had gone ahead and made sure that her jacket still fit before putting it back on its hanger and heading down the steps to go into 221B.
"To be fair I think had I been here when they got on the topic I probably could have stopped Alita, but I had gone to go change into my uniform and mark down the alterations that needed to happen to Sherlock’s." John leaned against the wall.
After another short break Melody speaks again, “Alright, we’re done here and I’ll catch you and Sherlock up when I get back.” Melody hangs up the phone and slips back on her jacket before standing. As she goes to make her way out of the office Molly stops her. “I didn’t know that John Watson had friends in PIP.”
Just as Ignatius got started on the last body the door opened and a younger woman entered. She was dressed in a white lab coat and had brown hair back in a bun. She stopped just inside and looked oddly at Ignatius.
Melody shook her head. "Dr. Hooper, where's the closest private room that I could show Lestrade something?"
“Then you really are scared about how things will go with Moran?”
They made it to where the other twenty or so PIP members were waiting. Melody started to get them in line by rank and order that Lloyd had provided the day before. After ten minutes of waiting in line, Melody led the way to the ballroom. Once they were in the antechamber Melody gave the last little bit of advice before she heard her name and rank get called.
“Can you and Ignatius roll him over so I can get a good look at it?” They both nod and roll the body onto its side.
"Lestrade, if you want the answer you're going to have to come to Baker Street. I will not speak about the time I spent near war here." Melody starts back towards the SUV. The rest of her team followed. Lestrade says something to Donovan before following her.
Melody nodded. She looked between Sherlock and Lestrade. "I don't know how much you two really know about me and my family, but my brother was Colonel Archer Sykes of PIP. He was burned to death in front of me when I was eleven and he was twenty-one. I was left with extensive burns on both my legs and the right side of my torso. When Moran tried to kill me and John I'd done the same thing that my brother had. Stood between the fire and another person. Something about me doing that to protect John made Moran and his Pokémon hesitant long enough for a lot of us to get away unharmed."
"Well, that explains the excessive burning on the body." Ignatius moves on to the last body.
"You heard Ignatius when he said that the unburned part looked like a tattoo that John and I have right?" Lestrade nodded. "Well that's what I'm going to show you, and allow you to take pictures of for both of our records."
"You mean that Moran for however long you guys have chased him has never once done that?"
“I find it odd that Harry’s is larger than the tattoo that it’s overlapping. Both of our tattoos didn’t go above the edge of the sternum if you drew a line around out from there, but he did do the same perversion to it as the one on my ‘father’s’ body.” Melody shook her head. “Just when I thought I understood what the hell Moran’s MO was he changed it.” Melody’s phone started to ring in her pocket and she pulled it out.  She looks at the caller ID for only a second before answering it.
Ignatius pulled out a pair of gloves from the box before he went over to the closest body and pulled back the sheet that covered it. Melody leaned against the wall just inside the door, far enough I word as to not get hit by the swinging doors. Lestrade joined her in watching Ignatius. After a few minutes, he covered back up the first body before moving to the second. When he uncovered it he gaged a bit.
“He’s never done anything close to that even on the few lookalikes that he’s killed over the years.” Nicholas had his phone out and Melody knew he was going over the old files.
“Moran’s directly targeting us. At this point, it’s better to be safe with a Pokemon that can get you out of there immediately.”
“Pokemon with Teleport are highly regulated. It takes a lot for anyone to get a hold of the TM. Why would PIP just give it out to a whole team?” Sherlock moves from where he’d been sitting in the kitchen.
“Let’s go. John, Sherlock, Mrs. Hudson, Nick, you’re riding with me. Alita, Ignatius, you’re riding with Lestrade. Lestrade, I trust that you know where the PIP headquarters are?” Lestrade nods. “Good, cause I’m going with my lights on. I don’t want to test if Moran actually wants us dead or not.”
Melody goes up to her room and pulls out a black pair of crutches from under her bed before slipping on her jacket. She pulls out her phone and shoots off a quick message to Lloyd about what was going on. Then she went over and looked out the window and saw that Lestrade had come over in his personal car or an undercover car instead of the standard police one. She went over to where the box was for her dress shoes and pulled out the beret. She settled on the black crutches before making her way downstairs. John was back with Mrs. Hudson along with him.
Once they get back to Baker Street they can hear yelling as soon as they open the door. It sounded like one of the voices was Alita’s and the other must have been either John, Sherlock, or Nicholas. Neither of them was very sure because the voice didn’t carry very far at all.
Sherlock had an understanding look in his eyes. Absol was often seen as a bringer of disaster, but it was the opposite, they warned of it. This meant that they were keenly aware if someone was bad. Moran must have been someone especially bad if a highly trained PIP Pokémon was trying to attack him.
"Ignatius, join us when you're done here." Ignatius saluted before turning back to the body.
"Nicholas, Lestrade, we got everything we need?" Nicholas nods. Lestrade just continued to look at her with confusion as he nodded.
Melody marches into the room, her crutch barely hitting the ground before it's picked up again. Her legs burn by the time that she is standing in front of Lloyd. Melody salutes her commanding officer as he pins the ranks onto her uniform. He salutes back and Melody takes the small box that he presents her before taking the chair behind him. She clips the temporary epaulets over her own as the next person is called.
“What is it?” John asked.
"Send the results to me then."
"Yeah, but I have no clue which is which. I'd just send an image of them to Lloyd or Nathaniel to have them go over them."
Only took me a week to write 3,000+ words once I got started. It's that getting started part that really sucks.
"Couldn't that have happened with any Infernape then?"
Lestrade takes several deep, steadying breaths before even trying to answer, "I was shot at on my way here. I picked up one of the two bullets that went both high and wide and brought it in so that Melody could run it." Lestrade pulls it out of his breast pocket to show the rifle round.
“Not at all, sister. Come on you guys.” Alita starts to walk off with the rest following. Melody follows Lloyd back o a small table near the open ballroom. Melody takes the only seat there and leans both crutches against the table.
It was only two days after the incident of Sherlock pissing off Melody before they all went to a crime scene together. Melody drove with John in the passenger seat and both Sherlock and Nicholas in the backseat.
"God, are we sure that it's Moran?" Ignatius quickly went over the body before covering it back up.
"I don't even want to be in your house, Jesus Christ!" William said and struggled a little to get out of the idiot's grip, "If you don't want me here then just let me go and tell everyone I ran off."
Sherlock smiled, gently squeezing Charlie's hand and chuckling a little as he spotted Rosie already dozed of, lying on her back with her arms spread out to both sides, one hand still holding the bee. "Well at least one of us is deeply relaxed." he said and smiled.
"Wow, that's incredible. It sounds like you knew just about everyone important at the time." John said after a moment, looking a little incredulously at his boyfriend, before chuckling and kissing the back of his hand. "And of course he had you in mind writing Dorian Gray, beautiful. Mediocrity must be something different then, after all of that. " He remarked, wondering quietly why in the world Sherlock would have chosen him.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Sher.'' John apologised, remembering what had happened in Sherlock's dream at this. Wrapping his free arm around his boyfriend as well, he kissed his boyfriend's cheek. "And they didn't have chocolate glaze, so I hope chocolate sprinkles are okay as well."
"Probably." Sherlock said and nodded, "What do they teach you about pretending to be older and eventually going away for a while when you look way too young for your age? I mean do they teach you strategies for that, or?"
"It's really easy! Look!" Rosie chirped and made a pirouette, holding her arms up above her head, "Come on, darling, you did for Harry, you can do it for Rosie too." Emma said and chuckled a little, giving her husband a light push forward.
Charlie chuckled and crouched down in front of the table and angled the camera so that she got both Juan and Ron. "I do, but not in the relationship sense." She commented and snapped a pic of them, glad her face was behind her camera. "And I like reading a lot. What about you?"
Charlie smiled and took his arm, before climbing down. "Yeah, let's do that. I think I'll keep the dress on for later when I'll pick the shoes"
John followed him into the bedroom and began to take of his shirt, finding that the day was coming along very nicely. He really didn't know which time of the day was the best for a good shag, but afternoon sounded very good. Once he'd send his shirt on the floor, he kissed Sherlock once more and pulled him gently into bed.
"Let's start with dare then." Harry said and smiled at her wife.
"Well then I know who's not going to nursery tomorrow." Sherlock said and frowned at Charlie, "You don't have to go to school either, we could say you both have the flu." he said and sighed, "Although it might be less suspicious if only Rosie doesn't go to the orphanage.. but if you're afraid you don't have to either. I'll be there the whole time though, I'll ask Greg if I can go into your class for a week or two, I mean, it's after all a sort of work experience so it'd be easy to pass it off as just getting a look what teaching higher grades is like."
John was quiet for a good while, thinking about his answer carefully. Tightening his arms around his boyfriend a little, he eventually spoke. "Well, for starters, what I don't like about an eternal, or, well, let's just say very, very long life is of course that I'd leave my family and most of my loved ones behind. But if that were the main problem, I'd have already agreed. You know that I love you enormously much, so I'd still have had you. And I was going to watch for example my parents die with or without myself turning. I know you love me a lot, so I'd just leave you alone and heartbroken, so I wouldn't have to." He sighed... he had thought about this before. "No, I wouldn't do that. The problem I have is committing to that long a life. Not committing to a life with you or my family. I don't know if I want to risk forgetting about my old life, going insane or just wanting my life to stop. Because however much we love each other, I already know there are things that can ruin it. I don't want to be resentful towards you or ask you to kill me because I won't be able to do it myself from what I've understood. There are just a lot of things I have to consider."
"Every bee hiff is a great bee hiff! Because it gives bees a home and like that more of them survive." Daphne explained and Sherlock chuckled, "Bee /hive/, sweetheart." he said and Daphne smiled, "Bee hive I mean." she corrected and Sherlock smiled again, he really couldn't help it, the little girl was a little sunshine.
Sherlock smiled, "I have the feeling they'll join.." he said and chuckled a little, "At least there's no force on earth to stop my mother from spending Christmas with her kids." he said, finishing his second glass, before putting it into the sink. "We'll probably have them over with Mycroft in the afternoon as well. Not entirely sure Mycroft would want to join a big family Christmas."
Sherlock nearly sagged with relief when it finally knocked at the door. He had had tried to call John a gazillion of times until he had realised that phone was still at home, he felt a bit ridiculous now for panicking like that and he would have to send Harry and Clara a text not to tell John that he had bombarded them with texts asking if John was with them. But really what did John expect if he told him he'd just pop out to get breakfast and then stays away for hours, walking over to the door, he could feel how his worry transformed into annoyance, "You know.. you could have at least taken your key with you.. where the hell have you..." he started as he opened the door, swallowing at the sight of two police men standing in front of the door. No. No this wasn't happening. Please..
Sherlock just stood there, staring into space for a few seconds - or minutes? Hours? He couldn't tell. He didn't hear anything the policemen said, before he closed the door. He just felt numb. Empty. There wasn't even pain. Not yet. He didn't know how he ended up in bed that night, or the night after that. Or the next night. The first time he could grasp a clear thought was four days later when he woke up Harry's face looking down at him. "Sherlock..." she said with a sigh, holding up one of the empty bottles of wine scattering the floor in his bedroom. "You think that's what he'd have wanted? You starving yourself and be the first vampire that drinks himself to death?" she asked, her voice softer than her words would make it seem. "Get up.. it's today.." she said and Sherlock rolled onto his side, turning his back to her, "Go away.." he grumbled, feeling tears stinging in his eyes.
"Awesome" Charlie said with a smile, while John glanced at all of the unwrapped presents. "How about we have some breakfast now that we've checked the most important part of the day." He suggested with a chuckle.
"Not at first glance, because you're doing a pretty good job hiding it. But underneath... yeah, you're my big softie that initiates group hugs, wants a double wedding to get everything right for Harry and likes to be held." John said with a smile. "But don't worry. Your secret is safe with me."
"Ah, I just meant when you're turned as a little kid." Sherlock said and frowned, "It's basically the same though, isn't it? I mean, you get to grow into that kind of life from a young age." he said and shrugged, "It's different when you're turned and left to figure it all out on your own, without knowing the first thing about it." he said and shook his head to chase away the memory of Victor, how he had longed to know how to turn someone. "Anyway, you found out on your own then?" he asked, not surprised in the least, really.
"A /lobotomised brain/? Where on bloody earth did you get that from?! That practice has been illegal for as long as my dad's lived." John had been sure they'd disposed of rotten organs at this point. At least it looked like Sherlock was about to throw it away. "Where did Richard even find it?"
"Oh.. yeah.. that's.. erm.. fascinating. But I've read that before." William said and took the book, before he placed it back into the shelf, "Erm.. do they have books with.. you know, more words and less pictures too?"
"I love secrets!" Rosie chirped, tugging at Charlie's hand, urging her to walk faster, while Sherlock frowned a little, though the smile stayed on his lips, "Sometimes I wonder why they bother to ask.." he said and chuckled.
"Sounds nice." Sherlock said and chuckled, "And I'm sure Angelo's is missing us terribly by now."
"Actually, if you can take care of this, I'll go upstairs and fill those." Sherlock said and reached for a separate bag, which contained three drink bottles for kids, he had made sure that neither is see through and well, for Rosie he couldn't resist the temptation to buy a bottle with a bee print. "Figured the little ones might get thirsty." he said and chuckled a little.
"That's actually something to write on a motivational poster in your teachers' lounge." Mycroft commented.
"Right, I- wow, thanks." Charlie said and looked at him for a moment before lying back down with a chuckle. "This is so sweet and so awkward, I can't even."
"Goodnight and you too." Clara said with a smile, before picking Harry up bridal style and carrying her into their bedroom. "Goodnight" Janine said and watched them leave.
"Oh yeah, she did." Sherlock said and shrugged, "I don't know much, she just sent me a text saying that she thinks David is more likely to consider meeting Richard now.. but that's all I know."
"Who knows maybe we'll be funding the first uni degree concerning vampire paediatrics.." Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes, "At least we don't have to start from scratch since it's all very similar to normal mortal medicine."
"Well there's a similar situation like the one we have these days. Those people just have been through a world war, so fear was still in them, no one goes out of a situation like that without being scarred. They also have been feeling oppressed by rules they've gotten by the rest of the world after losing the war. And yes, they did know what Hitler was planning to do to certain groups of people, but that also means they knew what he was capable of doing to people he didn't want to have around. Places where they did horrible things to people were horrible in itself, but they also worked as a warning what you can expect when you get on his bad side. So many people made sure to avoid that. And you can't condemn them for that. They are guilty of looking away and letting these things happen, but.. truth to be told, if we'd be living in a situation like that.. I'd probably look away a lot myself if that meant keeping you and Rosie safe." Sherlock admitted and gave her a little smile, "You know... before we took you two in... I kind of thought the same thing you did, that they should have done something, should have stood up against it.. but having kids.. you see a lot of things from a different perspective." he said with a frown, "And these days instead of those fears, we have terrorism and refugee waves and there are already people who are using the fears that come with that to manipulate the public (*cough*trump*cough*). It's the same system. Using already there fears and hyping them up to further your own plans. And unfortunately it's working rather well."
"She helped a lot more with that than you can imagine." Harry said and smiled, "Anyway, I gotta go and you should go in anyway." she said and Sherlock smiled, "See you sunday." Sherlock said and closed the door, so Harry could drive off, figuring she wouldn't want her parents to see her. "Okay... into battle then." Sherlock said, suddenly starting to feel nervous after all. Really nervous.
John chuckled and put his arm around Sherlock. He himself was focusing on tge proposal before anything else. "Yeah, you do that."
"Still mad I dragged you here?" Sherlock asked, giving Janine a little smile.
"Well anyway, how about we watch some of the videos now while we're waiting for the pizza?" Emma suggested, looking through the box for the tape she had mentioned before. "That sounds like a great idea." he said, grinning at John.
"Nah, I'm good. Vanessa was nice enough to make supper for me as well." John said and followed Sherlock into the kitchen where his study material was splayed out on the table.
Once the floor was clean and the sofa recushioned, she sat down on it and gestured Sherlock to come sit with her. Until six years ago there had been a two hundred year gap of her taking care of her children and it still amazed her how natural it felt to go back to that role. "Is your brother doing alright for himself?"
much easier"
When Sherlock walked back into the bedroom to get dressed he still had to think about his dream, that was weird, he just couldn't shake it off like normal dreams, but maybe that was because that dream had been particularly realistic and maybe because it had contained a lot of faces he hadn't seen in a long time. A very long time.
Charlie took Rosie's hand and twirled her around one last time, before falling comedically on her bum and acted as if she was too exhausted to get up. John peeked into the kitchen. "It already smells good. What have you made?"
"No really, me neither. It's actually good for her, probably." Sherlock said and sighed, "Letting her watch TV is probably also good. You know, letting her get an idea what actual families are like.. and maybe she could meet a few of our friends.. You think Carl would be okay with letting her look up her own case file in the police database?"
"Reaally??" Amy gaped, before grinning widely. "Mummy, may we?" Vanessa chuckled at that, before nodding. "Naturally, you may. Especially if Sherlock already promised you'd get to do that. Speaking of which..?" She started glancing at her son's hand, which was obviously still lacking a ring; and she would've thought they'd had already told her if anything was official.
John's face smoothed out again and he hummed agreeing at the last part. "Okay. Love you." He mumbled, slowly falling back asleep.
"True.." Sherlock said and frowned, "But I guess that's one goal we all have.. keeping it secret. So I think if we'll actually manage to set up a system like that with own prisons, vampires would accept it, since it's after all better than falling into the normal system where you will also be locked away, just without access to blood."
"I didn't exactly agree.. in fact when she first asked, I said no.. but then I suggested it again and told her I'd talk to you about it." Sherlock said and chuckled a little, "But it would actually be for a good reason. It would be incredibly easy to put a tracking chip into it, maybe even a diamond to cut glass and no kidnapper would check for piercings while making sure to take everything off of her that could be used as a weapon or tool to escape."
"Oh no, you don't!" Ron said and stood up quickly pulling the rubikscube he had brought for Rosie to give her later out of his pocked and throwing it as hard as he could at the back of that bitches head as she tried to drag Charlie away, before he grabbed Charlie's wrist and pulled her behind himself, "Get your dads! I'll distract her!" he called without looking back at her, already trying to block the girls way as she tried to get Charlie back, "Go!" he added when he didn't hear her running.
"Oh yeah, it is getting a bit late." John agreed and Viktor stood slowly up. "That's my queue I guess. Wouldn't want to keep you up." He said and clicked his tongue for Scout to come. "It was nice to have you over again. We should do that again sometime" John said with a smile, doing his best to sound beliebable; Viktor wasn't actually leaving after all. "Erm, yeah it was great to be here again." He said, sounding just slightly off, and put his coat on.
"Yeah, bit not good." John said with a wry smile. "Thank god Mrs. Hudson's fine then." He said after a quick moment of mental maths. Considering she was a woman the odds had probably been quite a bit worse. "Anyway, thankfully most nutters nowadays believe in things like chemtrails and wear dinosaur t-shirts."
"Oh, I told her about my time there." Sherlock said and shrugged, "Probably that made her curious."
"You two realise that I could just have sent you," Sherlock began looking at Richard, "John's number and given you," he went on turning to look at John, "Richard's?" he asked and chuckled, shaking his head as Richard took John's phone. "This is more convenient though." Richard said and chuckled, "You're just annoyed this is delaying your couch adventure with your fiancé." he said and Sherlock smirked, "Maybe." he admitted, clearing his throat, "He's my boyfriend, though. Not my fiancé." Sherlock explained and grinned at John, "Wait, didn't you say you're going to marry?" Richard asked and Sherlock chuckled again, "Well, yeah we will.. But John keeps waiting for the right moment to propose." he said with a smirk.
"Either way my point still stands." John said, before lifting the towel to have a look at the taller man's irritated eyes. "They could look worse, I guess. Are they a bit better?" He asked, returning to soothing Sherlock's eyes with the cloth. Sherlock could definitely do that by himself, but John couldn't help jumping at the next opportunity to fret about him a little.
"Not really." Sherlock said and reached for one of the small bottles of mouthwash from the hotel, quickly rinsing his mouth - now that would make a huge difference if he didn't have to rinse his mouth after every sip of blood. "To me everything else still tastes the same as it had before. Seems to be just the way you taste blood, I didn't notice any differences otherwise."
"Erm... we've got a Cluedo board downstairs." Charlie said, a smile playing on her lips at the thought of that story (good thing John was already on his way downstairs. "I've also got a deck of cards in that drawer over there. We're not that big on boardgames."
"What about earrings though?" Charlie couldn't help asking. "How do piercings work for us anyway, do those wounds just close again?" She said with a frown.
"That's not how most people would describe her. She really lives in her own world." Rachel said with a frown, immediately alarmed those strangers might've made one of her children do something they didn't want. "Rosie, love, are you out here?" She called after a moment, looking around the garden, though she knew that if the little girl didn't want her to she couldn't find her.
John came downstairs a few minutes later, carrying Charlie's pyjamas. "Okay, there we are." He said and looked over the stuff Sherlock had brought. "Are you sure about the cookies? That seems like a bit too much of a treat all things considered" He said and raised an eyebrow. "I could go get an apple instead though, that's at least got some nutrition." He commented and Fay perked up at hearing a faint voice outside. Her eyes flashed open again as she forced herself to stay collected and get the hell out of there. Her heart was beating like mad, as she tried to stand up and smash the chair so she'd be free to fight whoever was coming in. This escape atempt quickly ended with Fay just knocking the chair over to the side and hitting her head on the ground. She groaned; Great, now she was dizzy and didn't face the door anymore...
"Absolutely not." Sherlock said and shook his head, "First of all, I don't trust her. She might after all do something to Charlie.. or to herself, who knows if they have some sort of if you can't get back kill yourself thing.. so better not give her anything she could light a fire with or decapitate herself with."
Sherlock blinked at John's parents, rather dumbfounded at especially David's reaction, while Emma, sweet and charming as ever, turned to the two of them, "I'm sorry about that, Sherlock, gosh, what kind of impression you must have of our family now.." she said, seeming genuinely concerned and Sherlock gave her a warm smile, "So far... I have a very good impression of this family. Thanks for standing up for John... and well.. me to some extent. It means a lot." he said truthfully and looked over at John, along with Emma, "Oh darling, are you alright?" Emma asked and smiled at John.
About fifteen minutes later, Sherlock, Charlie and Mrs Hudson were still busy comparing even the tiniest detail about their stories, all still amazed about this, while still being worried about John. When eventually the doorbell rang, Sherlock's eyes moved instantly to the mantel, where of course John's keys were lying, as usual. "I'll let John in quickly." he said and smiled a little, that bit of familiarity, John forgetting his keys was weirdly comforting. Making his way downstairs, Sherlock's had a very unpleasant flashback to the nightmare he had had months ago as he opened the door and instead of John, he found a neatly dressed woman in front of the door. Anthea. What did Mycroft's personal assistant do here? Uncommunicative as usual, she texted away on her phone, with one hand while handing him a very old, yellowed envelope, before turning around and walking back to the black limousine. Looking at the envelope, Sherlock was a little startled to find his name - or well, /William/ - written on the front in a very familiar handwriting.
"I'm sorry, love." John said quietly and kissed his head once more. In an attempt to comfort his boyfriend, he ran his hand tenderly up and down his back, holding him firmly with his other. He wasn't going to leave right now.
"Yeah, that's true. We two still have to be careful not to break it though." John said, figuring most of that stuff was older than his grandfather. "Where do you want to start?"
Sighing, Sherlock sat down on John's lap, "I'll try to remember to talk to you about things like that first instead of just blurting out the idea." he said, moving his arms around John's neck.
"Yeah, love, I have to agree with Sherlock there." John told her, but she shook her head vehemently. "Just because I was wrong this morning, doesn't mean I'm wrong now." She said, though she couldn't definitely say that that wasn't fear talking. "You took us in three months ago and now a psycho doppelganger shows up? No way."
"Well she did want to call the vicar when her husband told her I'm 'a gay'." Sherlock said and rolled his eyes, "But I suppose that was more because she didn't know how to handle the situation and there certainly was a good deal less hate than there was with him."
"Yes, I'm still sure." John said with a nod and let out a sigh. He was nervous, but sure. "I don't think there's much of a point in putting it off now. Let's best get on with it."
"A gay vampire double wedding with Red Velvet Cake and Bloody Maries, hm?. Sounds just about perfect, doesn't it?" John said with a chuckle and shook his head a little. "Yeah, maybe."
"You utter prick. "John said began to laugh, almost getting some lasagne in his throat. That joke was too ridiculous, which thankfully spared him from realising a little late his boyfriend was taking the piss a bit out of him a bit.
John nodded and said Mark by for now who wished them good luck and walked off to talk to his brother. Going up to his father, John felt himself growing properly, properly nervous. Once they stood in front of him John swallowed and cleared his throat. "Hello Dad, this is Sherlock, my boyfriend." David Watson was a man of small but strong stature, whose entire demeanour demanded respect. Right now, however, he mainly gave off a sense of suppressed anger, a feeling underlined by his clenched jaw. "Hello, son." He said, still glaring at Sherlock, though it wasn't too far a stretch to say he wasn't addressing Sherlock.
Sherlock chuckled a little, "So what would be my job in the runway show?" he asked and raised a brow, "You've got to be the audience!" Rosie suggested with a chuckle, holding one of the smaller bags as Sherlock helped her out of the car. "Well, as long as I don't have to wear any dresses, I'm on board. But first, I think we have to move all that stuff upstairs first."
"Yeah.. I can definitely understand that. I mean.. I know now Mrs Turner is two years younger than me, but even when I thought she was 200 years younger.. it still didn't feel that way. She always felt like.. well it did feel like she's a couple of decades older than me." he said with a chuckle, before walking over to John and wrapping his arms around him from behind, "But I'm glad you're not going to leave me because of that. Just imagine how disappointed Rosie would have been if she couldn't be a flower girl after all." he said and smiled, thinking about the little girl.
"Right well.. then start asking." Richard said, taking off his coat and hanging it over the back of his chair. "I'll try to answer as best as I can."
"Actually.. I was a bit taken aback as well when the first phones without buttons appeared. But it's pretty intuitive." Sherlock said and paused, wait... he didn't look very much older than 18.. so the first touchscreen phones came out when he was what, 1? 2? "I mean.. when they appeared for me.. my mum used to let me play with her old chunky phone. My version of a toyphone.. so no buttons completely baffled me then." he said, hoping that sounded somewhat believable.
"Oh, damn." John said with a frown and set the pot down on the stove. "That must've happened this morning in a hurry. I hope Sher hasn't hurt himself too badly." He said and already reached for a cleaning fluid.
"No need to apologise. I'm just glad I did notice eventually." He told him truthfully. "But I'd like to talk to you about it in the morning, if that's alright." He said and kissed his boyfriend's head once more.
"Alright..." Sherlock said, watching John with a frown, before deciding to just give him some time to think about whatever he needed think about, while he tried to ignore and wash away some details of his dream, for instance that his 12 year old daughter kissed some boy. Not something he wanted to dwell on for too long, no matter what his dream self had told Charlie. It probably wouldn't be that bad if she would get her first kiss that age, but yeah he was a bit relieved that this dating business hadn't started just yet.
Sherlock followed and closed the door behind them once they were in the room, allowing for some more privacy, "Right.. I actually don't know how to start this.. and it might not be my place to tell you in the first place.. but like this it's probably less of a shock." he said and cleared his throat again, "Still, I felt like you might want some privacy first with this kind of news.. what John referred to just now... it's the fact that.. Richard.. he's still alive."
John took both and put it into his coat pocket. "Let's get going then." He said before taking Sherlock's hand with his free one.
"And giraffes are even taller than ponies." Sherlock said with a small smirk, still amused by their definitions of huge and small. "Do they have whales? Because they're really big! Like ships!" Rosie informed with a grin as they started to walk to the entrance.
"Well I'll doubt she'll be needing one of them anytime soon." Sherlock said with a chuckle as he followed John and Rosie, making sure to have an eye on Charlie, Mrs Hudson wouldn't get older after all. Well at least not physically.
"Hm, doesn't mean I can't cook for them." Sherlock said and chuckled as he stirred the tomato sauce, before he poured some of it into a separate pot. "And it's also easy for me to get some blood that way. I'll just say I'm allergic to something in the sauce, so I've made my own small portion of sauce without that ingredient. It's also red, which means I can put more blood into it than into something else without worrying about a suspicious colour." he said and chuckled as he grabbed a bottle of blood from the fridge with a frown, "You think I need to hide the blood bottles? Will they look into the fridge?"
"No, I wanna come in with you, maybe I find something too!" Rosie said and slipped into the room after Charlie, feeling really stealthy.
The week had passed without another hitch, which Sherlock was very thankful for. Four nights without bad dreams. Maybe talking about the most usual scenarios with John had helped with that and of course the fact that John seemed to text every hour whenever he was out. He still had the same fears nagging at him, but it was more bearable now that John knew. "You looked up psychology classes?" Sherlock called from the living room, where he was surfing a bit on the internet since John had decided to spend their free Friday studying. "What for.. they're not a requirement if you want to specialise in surgery.."
"Don't worry, dear. You'll be fine." Jane said and smiled, "Also no one would really take offence if you make a mistake or something like that with your age everyone will figure that it's your first real ball." she said and held her arm out to link it with Charlie's again.
John frowned, when the doorbell rang that soon again. Hadn't Sherlock taken his keys with him and Mrs. Hudson usually didn't ring... Reluctantly getting up and leaving behind his studies, he went out of their flat and down the stairs to the front door. His eyebrows darted up, when the sight of his aunt and her little daughters greeted him. "Hi Vanessa. Erm, what can I help you with?"
"Are we going to see a very special kind of bee?" Rosie asked and Sherlock chuckled, "Sort of. A very special kind of bee." he said and smirked, pulling up in front of the party location which was a very ordinary looking house on the outside.
"A little awkward.." Sherlock said and shuffled a little closer to Charlie on the bed, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder, "Are you feeling nauseous too?" he asked softly, finding Charlie a little more important than how his day went. "I've got something for that too, just say the word. I think you've suffered enough to understand that it was a very, very stupid idea to drink more wine than we told you was okay." he said, not sounding scolding, just.. calm.
Charlie beamed at the compliment (he was so sweet!), before quickly coming up with an excuse so neither he nor Rosie would question she liked tomato juice. "She does, but she's actually pretty specific about it; she'll only eat cakes made with Mrs. Turner's secret recipe." She said with a chuckle. "But what is your favourite cake? I really like anything with cinnamon in it."
Sherlock must've really been feeling awful, he thought, suppressing another chuckle. John came back to Sherlock side and covered him once more with the duvet, setting the additional blanket down on his feet. "Come on, you're sweaty; I don't want you to freeze. How about I'll call her at a less ungodly hour then?"
Sherlock chuckled too, "Certainly felt like it." he said and rolled his eyes. "It's nice that I can ask her to come over in the first place though."
John couldn't help chuckling at that; and she was supposed to feel like a princess so he didn't think to much of it. With a smile, he lifted her up and walked behind the table so that Sherlock could film the moment. "Ready?"
Sherlock smiled a little when the two started talking, before he walked over to Emma and Charlie, "You're a little show off, you know that?" Sherlock asked with a chuckle, shaking his head a little, "But she is really good, I've tried the guitar once, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it." Emma chuckled.
"Hm, if I'd have to pick my favourite surprise of the last three months, it'd probably be hearing that you took two little girls in." Emma said and looked at John, "Although I still haven't completely forgiven you for not telling us about it." she said, but then smiled again, "How's being dads going for you anyway? Any regrets already?" she asked.
"That's a nice change." John said, looking up from his notes. "Any news from the orphanage?" He asked, closing his notebook for now.
"I thought we'd settled that there aren't any actual adoptions going on there? And if there actually should be a legit one, it'd be incredibly unlikely they'd pick our girls, okay?" John said and raised an eyebrow. "The only other possible couple I could think of are Harry. and Clara."
"Hm... no, because your birthday is special already and your bedtimes are a more like guidelines on your birthdays, so you don't need it for those days." he said and chuckled, remembering their talk about Rosie's party. They really needed to start working on that.
John sighed and wrapped his arms around him in turn. "I suppose so. You know, when I think about the future, I almost wish Rosie could just stay five and wrinkle her nose at boys forever."
Sherlock said and chuckled, reaching out with one hand to take John's, "Glad it turned out like this though."
"It was mostly Emma." David commented as he closed the door, before beginning to walk into the living room. He'd made sure everything was tidy and where it was supposed to be; just like he always did when they were expecting guests. "Mother didn't quite like the new colour of the living room, but she got used to it with time."
The following morning Paul was on his way to his nephew and step-son's house. The phone called the'd had last night had left him concerned, especially since Amy had never shown symptoms like that, nor had any of the children in the orphanage according to Vanessa.. Well, at seven in the morning he rang their doorbell, since he still had to get the results into the lab by nine.
“Yes. I can’t really make out what the hell was on James Lloyd’s body, but Harry Watson had hers where your tattoo is.” Ignatius leaned up against the wall after he handed over his phone that had images of what Melody suspected was the side of Harry’s body. She flicked through a couple more of the pictures before handing the phone back.
‘I can follow behind directly, I was in one of the undercover cars today.” Melody nods and they make their way out of the building with Melody pulling a Pokeball off her belt and releasing a Shiny Porygon. It floated next to her for a few seconds before landing on her head.
“What is it Ig?” Melody leaves the one crutch leaned against the wall as she makes her way over to him.
“Hey, Lloyd, got something to tell you, but you're going to have to sit down first.” Melody shifts slightly so that more of her weight was resting on her crutch.
“Because they have before. Back right after my brother’s death, his whole team got Pokemon that knew teleport. I would have been allowed had I had a Pokemon of my own.” Melody stands and makes her way out of 221B. “Everyone be ready to leave in ten.”
“Good, Alita, you mind taking them to do that? I need to talk to Lloyd about the ceremony.”
“Not long if they have set the stage right. I’ll be the one presenting for most of it. There are two getting actual rewards, and you’ll hand those out, but otherwise, I’ll be doing most of it. You’ll be able to have Archer out though if you need him for support.”
When she got down there she found Lestrade standing in the middle of the room, his Houndoom alert beside him. She then looked over Lestrade again, he was standing still, the only movement was his chest heaving with deep breaths and probably could use the shock blanket that John and Sherlock had acquired at some point.
"I didn't think PIP medical guard got guns?" Lestrade looks between John and Melody with a confused look. Sherlock looked like he was finally reevaluating something.
When Alita and Ignatius arrived at Baker Street just as Melody was making her way to meet with Lestrade. Ignatius had deep black hair that had a slight curl to it and he was dressed in a black jacket and jeans with a gas mask hanging off it. Alita had on a gray canvas jacket and black jeans. She took one look at Ignatius and told him to follow her. He did so and Melody allowed Alita to head-on into the building.
Nicholas places the Pokeball on the scanner and sends the results to both his and Melody’s phones. He then goes and takes a skin sample. He places it in the device that he’d used at the last crime scene.
"It's in UK Zero. I can’t see which one it is though."
"I'd say that if there wasn't a time about two years ago when I was on a base where three people had Infernapes. Roy was out and never attacked a single one."
“Ignatius and I went and examined the bodies now that they have been put under better light, and Ignatius realized that there were markings left on the bodies.” Melody paused long enough to see the looks of shock on her team’s faces. “It is still Moran doing the killings and the marks are mockeries of the tattoos that John and I have.”
"Your, welcome." Melody hangs up the phone and puts it back in her pants pocket before taking her crutch. While she had been on the phone Lestrade and Sherlock had come over.
"Brigadier General, what brings you down to the restricted parking?" The Captain in charge of the gate asked.
Lloyd’s jaw dropped. “Mel, you sure?”
"I understand that I can't light anything on fire that isn't involved in a mission."
"Are you going to tell Lloyd?" John asks.
It's coming to an end, and yes I left it at a cliff hanger.
“Yes, but those who he’d killed in the past weeks were, in order, James Sykes, my ‘father’, Harriet Watson, John’s sister, and James Hall, Lloyd’s younger cousin. Though the only body that it was very obvious that he was trying to leave a message was the one on Sykes. On that matter, John, Sherlock, I’m sure you two have Lestrade’s number. Can you give it to Ignatius so that he can send the images to him?”
“What’s up, John?” Melody was quiet for several seconds. “I realized that Sherlock wouldn’t like the dress uniform, but he’s got to get over it. It’s for one night, and as long as he carries his badge on him when not in uniform, I won’t make him wear the rank pins. But the uniforms fit, right?”
“Because the ranking ceremony is the fifteenth. You’ll get your first rank. John may just get a promotion due to him having been a part of the military.” Melody looks at the two before continuing, “You won’t have to wear your uniform for anything other than official PIP functions and the like. At most you’ll have to wear the rank pin along with the PIP insignia like me and Nicholas do.”
John shook his head before answering, “They got into a fight about how Luxrays have a better move pool than Absols. I wanted to slap both of them, but before I could they almost started an actual battle.”
Melody’s phone went off and she saw that it was an email from Mycroft with Moran’s records. “Mycroft just emailed me Moran’s records. I’m going to go look through them. See what I can’t find.” Melody headed up to her room to dive into the records of one Sebastian Moran.
“This body has been here for less than a day, the perpetrator wants them found. He’s shooting them first before burning the bodies. I don’t think he wants them to be in pain when he burns them.” Sherlock stands from where he was crouched beside the body.
Melody answers back and relays the information to the other two.
"Appears so." Melody turns to Lestrade, "I know that this isn't what you'd want to do tonight, but I'm guessing NSY doesn't do rental Pokemon do they?"
"Body is James Hall the brother of Major General Lloyd Hall. The man that I'm almost certain that is doing it is Sebastian Moran. He was dishonorably discharged from the British Army in 2006. He tried to kill those under him, PIP and Army. Three died, some medically discharged, and over a dozen weapons missing from the base. Not a single Pokémon injured during the incident."
“Fair, by the point that we made it to the base hospital we were covered in cuts, nicks, and bruises more so than our uniforms.” John nodded in agreement with Melody. Both of them knew by the time they had made it back to a hospital away from the front lines they had assumed that all the major bone fragments had been removed.
Melody pulls out her phone after it goes off for the second time signaling that the DNA results had come in. She pulls it up to see UK00000059. She wasn’t familiar with it so she opened the file and scrolled down to the name, James Hall. She reads the rest of the file noticing that he’d had a Hydreigon and that his cousin was Lloyd Hall. “Shit.”
“That it was deliberately done. I can’t figure out exactly what the shape resembles, but it does continue to his back.”
"Moran killed James Hall."
Nicholas stands and the two walk down together, only stopping long enough for Melody to drop a crutch off in her room. When they got down there the only open seat was on the couch and Nicholas took it. Melody makes her way to stand in front of the mantel while muttering something like, “Yes, let’s leave the cripple to stand.”
Eventually, Melody’s phone went off. She picked it up to see a text from Lloyd. It read:
Lestrade nods. "Alright then, do you have a recent picture of him? We can distribute it to the rest of the officers so they can report in if they see him."
John nods and Ignatius hands over his phone. Nicholas looks up and says, “You know I don’t think I’ve ever seen the tattoo you are talking about.”
Melody nodded at Sherlock. "I'm positive that it was him. It was a Monferno when I was a kid that killed my brother and Moran has an Infernape."
“The only bit of unburnt skin on this body it kinda looks like your and John’s tattoos.” Ignatius points at the side of the body's rib cage. The shape was odd and somewhat resembled the silhouette of an Arcanine’s head and mane overlaid with something else. It ran around to his back.
Melody shook her head and leaned back. “Lestrade, come tell me what you think this looks like.”
“Why do we need our uniforms by the fifteenth?” Sherlock doesn’t seem disgusted by the prospect of having to wear the uniform.
Sherlock came back dressed in his normal suit. Melody spent the next five minutes going over why it was wrong to have done that before going to talk to Alita. She gave her the same conversation before sending them up to 221B to wait. She then went up to 221A and found Nicholas sitting with his Alolan  Ninetales.
Melody grabbed her other crutch before following Lestrade down the hall. Lestrade opened a door that had Dr. Molly Hooper on the placard. Melody had Lestrade close the blinds as she sat down in one of the chairs.
"John, you remember when we first met Moran right?"
"So, who exactly is the man that was burned, and who is the man doing this?" Lestrade asks.
“Lestrade, you are right. PIP medical guard isn’t given any guns. Seeing as our Pokémon are our weapons. I wasn’t a medical guard the entire time I was on a battlefield.” Melody takes a deep breath. “After, I was shot during my time as a medical guard PIP was officially on The British’s side during the subsequent battles. More and more medical guards were shot and after I recovered from being shot I was allowed on the battlefield. I had been attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers and from there I was a full soldier.”
Melody sees John flinch out of the corner of her eye. She knows that both Sherlock and Lestrade noticed it, but thankfully neither mentioned it in the middle of the street. She shouldn't have given that much detail out, but seeing as Lestrade was the investigator in charge and Sherlock almost definitely had the clearance for it, she let it slide.
Goodbye
“OH my love you should have said. I will be so very gentle. Can I show you baby? Can I make love to you?” Sherlock opened his dark eyes and stared up at john. Then slowly he nodded his head. His Sherlock. John let the knife clatter to the floor. His new mission was to make Sherlock first time one he would never forget.
Dear John Watson,
John writes a letter.
Yours sincerely
Yours
“I know. It took a while to figure that out. Longer to be OK with it, but I know.”
“Look John I know what you think of me.”
Wait what. That's not... Was Greg lying. He hadn't said that before. He had believed the lies. he had believed Moriarty. Hadn't he?
Yours Sincerely
“Shut your filthy mouth. I need to think.” John sat back in his chair pressing his face into his hands. The man that was not Sherlock knelt on the concrete in front of John. His  eyes were brown but the high cheekbones and long bow lips were so like the man he wanted them to be. So John made up his mind. John took the pale man’s face in his hands and pressed their lips together in a chaste kiss.
Sherlock the picture was from the night john had meet him. John was in a bar trying to drown in a pint. Then a bustling party rushed through the door. And there he was. John had spent the night following him. The party at the bar turned into drinks at his apartment and then there were only three. His Sherlock being pawed at by a large woman with breasts to fake to even believe, while another man sat on the couch and touched himself. The door opened for him, like a gift. They hadn't even locked it. It was a sign. Proof that it was meant to be. The fur coat he found in the closet was perfect and silenced his shot well. The couple on the bed never even heard their audience die. Then he took his time lining up the shot that splattered brains all over the bed spread. Sherlock never got to scream before there was a gun in his mouth. John had pulled him up and shoved him in the shower.
Soon they call Sherlock in and he and Kaimana walk in together. That is when all hell breaks loose. Suddenly a man was standing on the other end of the ballroom where there hadn’t been one before. The man was brandishing a handgun but had several more types of guns strapped to him. Beside him stood two Pokemon, an Abra, and an Infernape. He shot the gun twice into the ceiling and then pointed it at Melody.
“We can’t put out a bolo. He’ll just run and then we’ll be out a suspect again. I’ve followed him across the globe for years now. We do have PIP’s border guard watching for him though."
"My office. It's at the end of the hall." Melody nodded and headed towards where she’d left her other crutch.
"I want all of you to get a Pokemon that knows teleport. I'll clear it with Lloyd about Lestrade. If you have a Pokemon that can learn it from a technical machine I can get it from the desk. I would also feel more comfortable if Mrs. Hudson had one as well."
"Are we sure we're even going to be safe?" Ignatius asks.
There were three bodies on the three examination tables in the room each cover with a sheet, and while Melody could see a viewing window it was unlikely that anyone was up there at the moment. The smell of disinfectant almost overpowered the smell of burnt flesh.
John burst into laughter at the impersonation of his obnoxious cousin. "I'm pretty sure that's exactly what he'd say." He shook his head a little. "Anyway, we could start out by telling him you're not named after your grandfather."At least they had some time before it would become a problem not to tell him.
"No, that's all." Sherlock said and frowned, "Well except for one thing, can I tell her that if she has questions she'd rather ask a woman, that she can call you? Or come around?"
Sherlock chuckled and shot another photo of the twins with Rosie, all three grinning at the camera now. Putting his phone away with a smile, Sherlock got into the car and turned to look at the girls, "Alright, all of you into your seats and Rosie, do you think you can help Amy and Ally with their seatbelts?" he asked and Rosie nodded, "Yeah!" she said and began to fumble with the seatbelts, eventually figuring them out.
"I've never been very good at academics but you and your fiancé sound like quite the over-achievers." Viktor said. "I remember that Catherine studied three different school subjects at once for her degree and that had already been a lot for her. Hm, different times, different countries. What a difference that can make."
John makes sure his Sherlock will not forget his first time.
I am not the same man I was. I’m not sure I could ever look you in the eye. The last letter I wrote to you that will reach you only if I die was written in the in the middle of a wring of corpses. The screams and supplications still ringing off the walls. I never wanted too stain you with this. You told me I was extraordinary once. I hoped that when I came back you would still look at me that way. I am sorry. Lestrade held out hope for me once, I managed to disappoint him as well. I’m sorry to bring you into this long line of people that put their trust in me only to be disappointed. I may not be good for much else, but this I can do. I can finish what I started and make sure you are never under Moriarty’s power again. You will never have to know. Whats one more lie.
"What's going on in that big brain of yours love." John knew his sherlock was worried. He could see it in the mans every move.
“Oh you don’t want to know what I think about when I think about you.”

Dear john,
“Lick it clean for me.” John lowered the knife till breath was mixing with the blood.
“You ready my sweet.”
Sincerely
Please comment.
Sincerely,
Dear John,
"That's not what you said. If you believed in Sherlock you've believed in Moriarty as well."
the thirteenth letter
It was at that moment Johns phone started ringing. The caller ID said Lestrade. John growled. His Sherlock passed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Congratulations that is your job isn’t it.”
“Fuck.” John didn’t want to leave his new Sherlock. The sweet thing looked so very pretty in his bondage. He looked just ready for… John tears himself away. By the time he heads out he had sorted the two bag he had taken from the drug dealer and organized his haul. He also left a few gifts for his two play mates. His Sherlock was left with leather cuffs gold silk lining the inside, and a large red ball strapped into that mobile mouth. For the boy a stainless steel cage encased the soft hairless cock, and a spider gag holding the pink lips continually open. He smiled on the tube as he thinks about his Sherlock waking up to find he is not alone. The tube is crowded with people on their way to work and john knows he looks looks rough. The same clothes from two days ago and dark circles under his eyes. Most people on the tube see a man who does not want to be there, if they see him at all.
The end
“Good boy.” John stroked the dark curls away from the pale face. He smoothed away the tear tracks and warmed the trembling arms. John got the small bottle of lubricant john had stored in a set of drawers by the bed. John was just about to burst out of his pants. He cut sherlocks trousers to ribbons always making sure not to tear the precious flesh beneath the thin fabric. John lowered himself over the pale body laid bare beneath him. He took Sherlock’s legs under the shaking knees and pushed them up to meet his shoulders. He lowed himself down to where his cheek rested on the quivering thighs watching the soft cock between them twitch and jerk as john ran the blade of his knife from navel to balls. He caressed the sweet little cock with the flat of his blade. John dragged he sharp point lower and lower each time returning to torture the head of Sherlock’s cock with the dull edge. Finally after he had gotten bored with the terrified screams and agonized begging he let the blade rest on sherlock’s perfectly curved ass.
“John, I need your help.”
Dear John,
Yours sincerely
Survival is the best drug don’t you think. The blood rushing through your veins. The way you move and breath feels different. I have two broken ribs and dislocated arm, but all I want to do if find more trouble as Mrs. Hudson would call it. If this is what war was like I can understand your reluctance to let it go. I’ve been close to death on three occasions before this and they were all at my own hands. Having someone else hold your life in their hands is indeed terrifying, but there is nothing better than breaking their wrist to get your life back again. That analogy may have been a bit stretched. You will understand what I mean. You may be the only one who could. The only one who always understood what I meant. I’m alive. I wish you were here to celebrate that fact with me.
Oh he could see it now, the blood the screams the pain. Almost enough to… NO, never.

“They think she is purposefully hindering the investigation -GL
"His name is actually Keven. Keven McAlister, but yeah he's a dead ringer for Sherlock. "  Both molly and john turned to look at Greg. The blood had stopped dripping from his nose, but his face still looked horrible. He was using molly's freshly bloodstained lab coat to wipe away the worst of the mess.
I love you John, and maybe I can find some sort of peace without you.
I am sorry, but I can’t do it. Seeing you with her tears me apart. I want you to be happy. If you are happy with marry then I will not stand in the way of that. I thought I could return to not caring. I thought that I would be able to unlearn how to love you. There is a castle in my mind that is filled with your sent, your smile, and everything that reminded me why I loved you. While I was away I lived there. Visited it every time my eyes closed so I could see you. I cant do it anymore. I deleted it. I tried to delete it, but it didn’t work. Now and I cant do this anymore. One more case. One more adventure just for us and then I’ll leave. I survived this dark world before. I doubt without you to hold onto I will again, but I can not watch you love another while I am pulled out of the shadows when needed and forgotten about when of no use.
“Well if they’re missing heads I’d start with that, you never know someone really smart may come along and tell you the same thing.”
“well yeah.”
AAAAANNNNNDDDDD now you may scream.
I am in the south of France waiting for the drug addicted son of a wealthy weapons dealer. I believe he (The father not the son, obliviously. ) is where Moriarty obtained his explosives. You would have loved this chase. I actually had to dive into the seine two days ago. I nearly froze to death on my way to the safe house. You would have yelled at me for being so reckless. I am at a hotel bar posing as the new street competition for the sons drug of choice. I’m not using, you needn’t worry yourself. If all goes to plan ill be able to find his father and will have the first thread of Moriarty’s web in my hand within a week. I hope you are well. I know that you lost many friends during your time in afganastan. I hope you know I am loath to cause you any pain that is not absolutely necessary. I think we can both agree that without me you will be happier. You always said that I cock-blocked you from any women that might have been even passingly interested in you. It’s been a fortnight since I saw you at my grave. I want you to be happy. Please John for me, be happy.

the 15th letter
I am proud of this chapter. It took me ages to finish, but its done. I did it all in like 3-6 sentence bits between work and school.
There is so much I wish to say. So much I wish you could understand, but I have neither the words or the time. I’ll see you soon. For the last time john. I love you.
“It’s me Sherlock. Please...Please.” He was hesitant to beg but he did it so well John couldn’t bring himself to hurt his Sherlock. Not now, not again. “Take me to bed. Please.”
"Come on love. It's ok. Talk to me." John encouraged.
the 17th chapter
The big brown eyes looked up at him, so afraid so vulnerable so desperate to please, to not be hurt.
“Here.” John threw a blanket around the boys shoulders. “Stay here.” the boy just nodded and curled up blinking unseeingly at the gun in johns gloved hands. Then seemed to be falling into some sort of sleep. John watched for a moment then went to work. The needles were collected and wiped of prints. John found a large rucksack where he packed up the morphine and cocaine along with a few other goodies he found. The Viagra and lube found a place in the pack as well. John then went over the bedroom and collected his boys clothes. That was when he found that the bed itself had drawers and oh were they worth finding. Whips, paddles, handcuffs, gags, and blindfolds. John found several cock cages of different sizes and designs. Also a case that said sounds on the front, and once john had read the instructions on the inside smiled as his imagination ran wild. There were other things that he could only guess at and others that he had a vague idea about. He found a duffel bag in one corner and packed it all up anyway. John dressed the boy and all but carried him out of the building. No cameras or inquisitive neighbors no wonder Casanova lived there. John snagged a cab that got them close to the wear house, but still far enough away that john was sweating by the time he had doubled back and muddied their route that no one would be able to follow them,on foot or on CCTV.
