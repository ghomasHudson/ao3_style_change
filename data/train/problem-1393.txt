“Sherlock, would you mind playing something?” John asked, waving a hand towards the violin sitting in its case. Sherlock remained in his seat for a few moments more, confusion roaring through his head. John took no notice as he had already returned to his laptop and was reading. Sherlock realized, then, that John was doing more research. Sherlock had to remind himself that John was not gay. He had dated many women before he took up residence with Sherlock, and one kiss wasn’t going to instantly change him into something different.
With a sigh, John stood up and went to take the memory stick from the dresser in the corner where Sherlock had been keeping it. Sherlock watched him with apparent interest and so John explained it to him. “I’ll have to take her back.”
John’s face flushed at the frank way in which Sherlock had asked this. He ruffled his paper and brought it up to cover his face in an attempt to look as if he were really reading it. Sherlock watched John for a moment before realizing that he may have overstepped the boundaries a bit. Sliding from the sofa, Sherlock crept over to kneel in front of John and look up at him. John probably noticed the instant silence because he moved the paper a fraction, realized that Sherlock was not in his previous seat and looked down suddenly when he caught sight of Sherlock’s hair.
John finally got it, somehow he got it. He just didn’t want to have to admit it and thus admit that he needed to be loved by someone. But he *did* need to be loved by someone, and here he was lucky enough to be loved by two people at once. One of whom would give his life for him, the other who would carry his child for him.
Sherlock smiled ruefully. He always seemed to enjoy John’s praises and today was no exception. He lounged against the back of the sofa with one arm across the back of it and stared at John. John suddenly felt like a butterfly pinned to a display case. “So,” Sherlock drawled carelessly, “What do I win for this little game?”
Sherlock reached his hands up to cradle John’s face and gently leaned down to kiss his soft, firm lips. John didn’t pull away, yet neither did he push forward into the embrace. Instead he held very still and Sherlock reluctantly released him while he took a step back. He stared into John’s eyes, trying to read him, understand him, deduce him.
Sherlock sighed, stood up and walked over to the violin. Picking it up and tuning it quietly, he set bow to strings and began to play. It wasn’t anything that John would recognize, but it was similar to other pieces Sherlock had played before when John was reading research so Sherlock believed that it would be most welcome now. He glanced over at John from time to time as he played and noted when John looked up and smiled towards him. Sherlock smiled back and continued to play late into the night. It was… comforting.
John understood his sister more in that visit than he ever had. But it still only brought up more questions about himself than it answered. But he couldn’t let Sherlock get away with only half of the game. “And how do you know she’s cooking?”
Sherlock grinned with him before leaning forward and whispering in his ear, "It is no wonder that you are so warm then."
Sherlock’s face brightened as he gazed at John, perhaps attempting to find the correct beginning. John took several deep breaths and focused on Sherlock, no longer recounting the names of the bones and no longer fighting Sherlock in an order to retain his faculties. After a moment Sherlock began his campaign by taking John’s face in his hands and pressing a light kiss on John’s lips. John felt the most deeply warm feeling flutter into his stomach and his spine tingled from head to tailbone. The kiss was so gentle and soft that John began to tremble just a bit from the intense feelings it evoked in him. Sherlock eventually ended the kiss and pulled back gently, his hands still holding John’s face and staring him deeply in the eyes.
After some time in silence, John cleared his throat. “Erm, so, what part of Asexuals *do* you identify with?”
Whatever he was about to say was cut off by Sherlock’s lips on his. Soft, tender and warm, pressing against his own in such a chaste and loving manner. John gasped, the sound echoing in the silent room, and reached out his hands to steady Sherlock as he moved into the kiss. His eyes slipped shut and he simply let himself feel this before it had a chance to be taken away from him. He felt Sherlock’s right hand cup his cheek while his left hand clung to his shoulder.
“St. Bart’s was your next stop. The antiseptic scent on your jacket tells me that you never took it off so your visit… visits, plural, were brief yet still not what you were looking for.” Sherlock continued as if John’s whole focus should be on him alone. In actuality John was remembering his conversations with some of his colleagues at hospital, mostly of the psychology field. The told him a lot about schizoid personality disorders, Asperger’s, asexuality. But the one thing that they all agreed with was that there was no such diagnosis as sociopathic, high-functioning or otherwise. Hearing all of that caused John to feel both better and worse about his friend. But he chose not to allow himself to be dissuaded from a possible relationship with the man.
John’s mind raced with all the exquisite feelings that the kiss had woken in him and he blinked another couple of times before answering. “Perfectly. Shall we continue?”
Sherlock paused, his eyes boring straight into John’s soul, before dropping his gaze to the side and sighing briefly. He dragged his eyes back to John’s before answering. “Being, as you know, uninterested in sex from a young age I decided when I was on my own that I would see what all the fuss was about. I have had sex with exactly two people in my life, one female and one… male.”
“How do you do it?” Sherlock spoke slowly and deliberately, weighing and measuring each word before releasing them, almost as if it were a chore to speak.
Sherlock’s eye’s widened at this, but he said nothing. John went on, “And then, just as I’m getting to understand you, you jump from a rooftop, kill yourself and disappear, leaving me behind. And at first I was *so* angry with you. So angry that you had made this choice to die rather than trust me to help you. Then I was hurt that you had left me and I was in so much pain that it was easy for her to latch on to me, wasn’t it?”
John dropped his gaze for a moment before returning it to Sherlock’s. ”Besides the companionship and intimacy, there is the fact that it's extremely pleasurable."
Sherlock shrugged, not something he was wont to do unless he didn’t really want to ask a question. “The two individuals were very informative.”
John tried to hide his grin behind a tea cup. Harry had made a Quiché Lorraine and had brewed fresh coffee. She had taken up the class for two reasons; one to get closer to her wife Clara, and the second was that the concentration needed for cooking made her forget the drink. John thought that anything that made her life better was a good thing. In the end, though, he had to go find more answers and so his next stop was—
Sherlock nodded once. Of course, John wasn’t gay. But then neither was Sherlock gay, or exactly straight for that matter. Really he didn’t know exactly what he was, and felt he should explain this to John. “Well I’m not exactly sure what I am.” He took another step back and shoved his fingers into his hair, wrenching it roughly in an attempt to control his torturous thoughts. He began to pace again, this time into the kitchen and then back to the sitting room, making a roundabout of the kitchen table before coming back towards the sofa.
Except that Sherlock didn't even try to get away, instead his dark unfathomable eyes locked with John's changeable ones and said, "There is a spectrum, shades of gray if you will, to asexuality. I didn't realize I wasn't anything other than Hyposexual, no one had ever tried to stay and make a go of being close to me before. Only Mycroft and he understandably doesn’t count.”
John had been home for approximately an hour, had taken his tea to his chair and was reading the daily news, when Sherlock marched into the sitting room from downstairs. The door slammed shut behind him and Sherlock marched over the sofa and flopped down on it. John glanced up from his paper and apparently noted Sherlock’s vacant stare to the ceiling and his pale cheeks which more than likely looked far deeper than he liked. Silence reigned in the flat for all of five minutes before John chanced to break it with actual conversation.
Sherlock stood with eyes glazed and mouth open just a bit. Then he suddenly refocused and smiled as he slipped his arm into the crook of John’s and they strode off together.
John smirked at the formal language that Sherlock had affected, as if he were an esteemed scientist asked to give a lecture at Oxford. On the whole, John felt that Sherlock was enjoying this conversation better than he had hoped.
John turned to check on his friend and found the other man awfully close to him, a hand still on his shoulder and slightly leaning on him for support. “Sherlock what—“
“Yes, you told me to eat and I decided it was a good idea for now.” Sherlock continued into the sitting room with his plate and cup and sat in the middle of the sofa. John smiled faintly before going to make his own cup of tea, but he couldn’t help feeling as if he were being stared at.
Sherlock paused and walked over to John’s laptop, typed a few words into the search engine and brought up a website. He waved a hand towards the computer and John slipped into his chair in order to read. Sherlock returned to his pacing and waited to hear what John thought about what he read. After what felt like hours, but was most likely only a few minutes, John turned in his seat and looked at Sherlock with a perplexed gaze. Sherlock stopped and stood waiting in the middle of the room.
“Are those the only places that I’ve been today?” John prodded. By Sherlock’s expression, John knew that he was enjoying this game immensely. Sherlock glanced down at John’s shoes before continuing his deduction.
And it wasn’t just his mouth that was engaged in this operation, Sherlock also employed his hands, fingers slipping down from his face to slide down his shoulders and hook John’s elbows up, encouraging John to wrap his arms around Sherlock’s neck as he brushed his fingertips down John’s sides. Reaching the hem of John’s jumper, he began to pull up on the wool, slipping it up and breaking the kiss only long enough to pull the clothing over John’s head and freeing him from the heat it was holding to him. John whimpered at the temporary loss and Sherlock moved quickly to close the distance between them again, reinitiating the kiss and lighting John on fire from within.
He felt John relax beside him, sinking into the sofa cushions and wrapping his other hand around Sherlock’s arm. “So you believe we have a connection that should take us to another level of our relationship?”
But he couldn’t, not with being married to her and getting her pregnant. John sighed and went to stare out the window at the swirling leaves that fell to the ground. He heard Sherlock moving behind him but didn’t acknowledge it. Not until he felt Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder. “You should be sitting down.” He chided.
John chuckled lightly and Sherlock gave him that favorite smirk that always had John smiling for hours afterwards. John stepped back to give Sherlock some room and Sherlock shivered at the loss of heat that John had been sharing with him. He hoped that John didn’t notice but from the strange glint in his eyes, Sherlock figured he had failed on that count. John took one of Sherlock’s hands in his own and drew him back to the sofa to sit with him. Sherlock didn’t argue, settling in close to John and just… existing with him.
“Desperation?” Sherlock scoffed before he turned and flopped on the bed. John moved the covers aside to let Sherlock actually climb into the bed, andthen began to tuck him in. He sat on the edge of the bed and looked at the floor as he tried to come to terms with it all.
And then there were the feelings that got involved in sex. Love, companionship, desire, heartbreak. It was all so useless.
Something that John found so easy to live with was something that Sherlock found rather fleeting. He understood love. His parents loved him. His brother, well one could say that his constant meddling was love in its own way. And John, John loved him. Didn’t he?
“Stop it, Sherlock, just stop! That woman is *not* my wife!” John was so agitated that he couldn’t sit still and he jumped up from his chair, the chair that Sherlock had brought back out of storage the moment he had suspected that this was how John would react. And why was Sherlock still trying to convince John to keep this woman if he had already prepared for John’s return to their flat?
Sherlock slipped his tongue out to press against the seam of John’s lips, asking for acceptance and entrance to John’s mouth. John gasped again, sucking in a sharp breath that simply allowed Sherlock to cant his head to the right just enough to allow them to fit snugly together, kissing softly, saying nothing aloud, yet saying everything with lips and tongue. John’s hands drifted seemingly of their own accord, gently caressing Sherlock’s arms, down his sides to his hips and waist, just carefully holding him.
“Sorry Sherlock, I can’t let you walk away from this. That kiss was important enough for you to share with me and I want to understand!” John bulled his way up to Sherlock, pressing him against the wall under the coat hooks and planting hands on either side of his shoulders, effectively pinning him to keep him from getting away.
“The hypothesis is can I be sexually attracted to you?” John delivered this line with as much courage as he could muster sober. Sherlock’s head came up instantly and his piercing gaze locked with John’s. John knew what those eyes would find. He was attempting to hold himself as still as possible and not thinking about anything to do with Sherlock and sex. What appeared to be working at the moment was reciting the various bones in the body from largest to smallest. So he was pleased to find that there were no signs of sexual attraction while Sherlock’s eyes roamed up and down his body and into his eyes.
Last night John had read as much on the internet as he could find that looked credible. Sherlock had dropped a bomb in his lap but John was nothing if not resourceful and determined. Sherlock was his best friend, sometimes his only friend. And John wanted to care for him the rest of his life. That much he knew as a certainty.
In the end Sherlock told him nothing that was on the stick, choosing instead to remind John of all the times she had told him that she loved him, how they were married, how she was carrying John’s child. And those were the things John didn’t want to hear.
The phrase was a signal between Sherlock and John. One where John told Sherlock that he had cocked it up again and an apology may or may not be in order. John straightened the paper he held and folded before laying it on the table next to his cup. He next picked up the cup of tea and took a sip of it, all the while Sherlock remained on his knees in front of him. Finally he returned his attention to Sherlock.
John let his head fall to the side a bit as he thought. Just how far was he willing to take this? When would he call a halt to the proceedings and declare an answer?
John glanced over at Sherlock again. “Well if I knew to which tediousness you were referring I could answer appropriately.”
Sherlock smiled and reached out a hand to brush across John’s cheek. “I know, and I am still sorry about that. But that is old news, and we are talking about Mary now.”
Sherlock nodded absently and waited for the verdict. John looked around and took notice of the time before turning his attention back to Sherlock who looked just as frazzled as himself. For a moment they sat together in silence, each unsure if the other was going to speak first. Finally John decided that it would have to be up to him to make the next move. He started by wrapping his arms back around Sherlock’s neck and slid off the sofa onto Sherlock’s thighs, thrusting up until his now very visible hard-on hit Sherlock’s own. Sherlock sucked in a startled breath as John tightened his grip on him. “Well, detective, I do believe that your experiment was a rousing success.”
They had been engaged for a case regarding someone that Sherlock would later only call ‘The Woman’ and who Mycroft would never forgive himself for dropping into Sherlock’s lap. John remembered the toss of conversation back and forth until Mycroft revealed that The Woman was a Dominatrix, which had caught Sherlock’s attention. Mycroft had dismissed Sherlock’s interest with, to John’s ear, a throw-away comment.
Sherlock opened his eyes and glanced over at John. “I don’t know. I only know that right now, this thing we are doing here? I have to tell you, John that I am very… aroused being next to you.”
“I propose an experiment.” John began. Sherlock may have managed to look bored, but John could see the excited glint in his storm grey eyes.
John blinked and then it seemed he couldn't help himself and he looked. Cue the blush as he didn’t miss that ‘Yep, Sherlock's trousers were rather strained and uncomfortable looking’. Of course he wasn’t going to draw too much attention to John’s little peek because he didn’t want to scare John away. John moved his gaze back to Sherlock’s and swallowed briefly. “Oh.”
John smiled warmly. That had been his most important stop. He'd never really talked with Harry about how she'd figured out her sexuality. He didn't realize that it was something that she'd struggled with as early as 12 years of age. Listening to her speak of knowing that she was attracted more to her own sex when discussing celebrities had been her first indication although back then she had mistakenly thought that her being attracted to the female pop stars/whatnot was just wanting to emulate them, it was only when she didn't notice the boys her peers found attractive …
When John felt he had done all he could to make Sherlock comfortable again, he sat on the floor by Sherlock’s head and gazed up at him. “Sherlock, how do I do this?”
John let him pace this time, not reaching out to stop his flat-mate but keeping a watchful eye on him all the same. After the third trip round the table, John spoke up and asked, “Have you researched it? Surely it was something you concerned yourself with when you were younger?”
John and Mary watched the jet touch down on the tarmac and taxi its way back to the cars that they stood next to. Mary held John’s hand and was smiling winningly every time John glanced her way. Just as the door opened and the stairway came down, Mary reached over and squeezed his arm. “I want to keep your name, but I’m taking the baby some place safe. I know you love Sherlock, you as much as told me so when you went back to live with him.”
John always touched him, had touched him from the beginning. It was a very John thing to do. And Sherlock remembered not too long ago when he didn’t like being touched in any sort of manner, but John’s touch was different. It was special, warm, caring, and desired. Sherlock wanted to have John’s hand there, holding his wrist, touching his arm, reaching up to his shoulder as he stood up next to Sherlock. His hand slid up to Sherlock’s shoulder, his neck and finally his cheek as John gently called his name.
Turning back to Sherlock he found himself under the laser sharp gaze of the detective’s cold steel grey eyes and knew he was being deduced. He shook it off and finished his tea before stepping back into the sitting room and into his chair. He took a few sips of his tea, watching Sherlock out of the corner of his eye as the other man slowly bit into his toast and chewed thoughtfully. Finally after he had finished the toast and set his cup down on the coffee table, Sherlock leaned back with his hands forming a steeple before his face.
“John, honestly, do we have to go through this? You are not gay.” Sherlock sat up carefully, slowly, and made as if to stand. John was there to hoist him up and wrapped an arm around his waist to help take some of his weight while walking him back towards his bedroom. All the way there, John muttered to himself.
After an indeterminable amount of time Sherlock stood up from the sofa and made his way over to John’s side, kneeling when he reached the armchair and meeting John eye-to-eye. John met his gaze frankly and waited for the man to make a move, any move, as long as he would just do something. Sherlock smiled faintly before he spoke.
John smiled back and then nodded for Sherlock to continue. Sherlock took the acknowledgement for them to proceed and leaned in to kiss John again, this time with a bit more pressure and a slow swipe of tongue to lip, as if asking permission from John to enter his mouth. John took only an instant to make a decision and then he was opening his mouth and flicking out his tongue to greet Sherlock’s and invite him in. Sherlock took the invitation and suddenly John was lost in feelings and sensations and desire as Sherlock probed and caressed every nook and cranny of his mouth. John’s eyes were closed now, he couldn’t look into those stormy eyes anymore and he couldn’t control the sudden urge to moan into Sherlock’s mouth.
Sherlock waved towards John and elaborated. “You have a coffee stain on your left cuff and there are crumbs of a sort of pastry on your jumper, near your… jeans.”
Sherlock fell silent as he processed this. It was a simple enough answer to a far more complex question but that was the way John normally thought. Simple and small compared to Sherlock’s complications. He wondered if John just didn’t understand what he was really asking. “Oh, is that why you go to all the trouble to find girlfriends and have sex with them? “
John trembled as the implications of what Mary was telling him began to settle in and Mary reached out and hugged him. He wrapped his arms around his wife and held her, gently rocking back and forth. “You know I do love you, after a strange fashion?” he asked.
His mind spun. Beyond spun, it raced and he felt the need to move. He smoothly surged to his feet and began to pace as he let his body be an outlet for the turmoil in his mind. John, simple yet complicated John. He seemed to have it so easy. Drop down to the pub for a pint and a game, wink at some useless twit of a girl and then it’s off to her place for touching and intimacy and… sex.
The seventeen steps up to their sitting room were taken lightly because he was in a good mood. He shucked off his coat as he stepped into the room, straightened it and then hung it on its usual peg and then closed the door before turning to the kitchen to find Sherlock; in his blue dressing gown, blue pin stripped pyjama bottoms and grey t-shirt, coming from the kitchen with a plate of toast and a freshly made cuppa. John smiled in his direction.
John smiled, releasing a soft sigh as he came to rest against Sherlock’s shoulder and whispered back, "Yes, your John and you are my Sherlock."
“Honestly, Sherlock, what the bloody hell are you doing down there?” He set the paper to the side to stare down at his flat-mate. Sherlock gazed back up at him.
John shook his head. “No, we are talking about all of this. My heart, Sherlock, belongs to you. It always has, ever since that first day, that first case. How can I give any of my love to Mary when I still love you? How can I live with someone I don’t love? And why *should* I love someone I don’t know when I have *you*?”
"Ah. Well, in future, please stick to the agreements. You can't simply use the church whenever you feel like it. That goes for everyone, including you." The monk's voice sounded much cooler now. He led them quickly and silently through the choir. They emerged into a narrow corridor with a wooden door, which he opened with an old-fashioned key sticking out of the lock on the inside. They were hit with a blast of cold night air.
"Yeah, that's true. But it's still just a hare-brained notion based on a random comment made by Professor Sheppard. We can't proceed on the basis of that. We need proof," Lestrade growled.
Sherlock focused his senses on the animal. Look closely. Differentiate. Eliminate. Categorise. Distinguish the features. Understand the context. Size: approx. 55 cm. Adult. Base feathers white, including the head. Grey wings with black tips that extend considerably past the white tail. Yellow eyes ringed with red. Yellow bill with large gonydeal spot, curved tip. Vivid yellow legs and feet, webbing between the three forward-facing toes. Order: Charadriformes. Family: Laridae. Western yellow-legged gull.
The phone fell silent. Sherlock blocked the bridge, greedy for chaos, leapt over it, shocked at the high-pitched lament of the instrument. A ghastly peeping and whining that hurt the ears and tore the heart bloody. Sherlock wielded the bow fast and breathless, reducing the pressure now, gradually, without losing any of his speed. The bow jumped. Sherlock let it jump, let the misery on the other side of the bridge trickle away in a wild staccato.
Sherlock remained silent, allowing the attentive grey eyes to examine him. John had doubts. Sherlock saw them. He saw the battle John was fighting. He saw his friend the soldier on one side. And he saw the terrible fear of a father for his small daughter. He saw all of the emotions and arguments struggling against each other.
Variation 4 was no problem, all he had to do was maintain the pace of the runs and changes in fingering positions. On the other hand, Variation 5 was challenging with the theme reduced to the bare minimum, yet still unpredictable, sending out queries into an unknown realm and demanding absolute tonal concentration. Sherlock knew he couldn't practise the aspects relating to the underlying meaning, and he didn't want to. Either the music spoke for itself, or it was hollow.
"Watson." I have stopped walking; our eyes meet. "Have I understood you correctly? You wish to engage in immoral acts as often as possible?"
Sherlock listened to the warm tones of his instrument. He added the second part in his head. He missed it, yearned for it, for its physical presence: the sonorous harmony of Eurus's violin. There was an unexpected magic when their instruments met, when their sounds found each other, accompanied and carried each other. He was addicted to it. To the intimate, wordless manner of communication. They were so similar, he and his sister, so closely related; so familiar. And yet he avoided Eurus when they played the Largo. He always closed his eyes, as he did now. The Largo belonged to him. Eurus accepted that.
"The freighter will have set course south along the European coast," he said. "Spain and Portugal would lend themselves perfectly to jumping ship."
John set the book aside and stared out the window. He inhaled deeply. His heart was pounding. Damn it! What lesson was Mycroft trying to teach him?
Magdalena paused there. The memories seemed to shake her previous calm. She covered her face with her hands. It was silent in the interrogation room for several long moments. Finally, she dug a handkerchief out of her habit, wiped her eyes and blew her nose. Then she sat up straight again on her chair.
Sherlock gurgled. His lips turned blue, his eyes bugged out, his hands slipped away from John's and fell to his sides. John loosened his grip and let him go. Sherlock sank to the floor. John went to the door of the flat, took the key out and put it into his trouser pocket. Then he washed Sherlock's blood from his hands at the faucet of the kitchen sink. The flat had only cold water.
"No, you could not have found me in any files. I live incognito, shall we say, and normally do not show my face, even with a mask on it." He laughed at his own joke. "But the affair with my brother did lure me out from underneath my rock, Mr Holmes. That was not very sporting of you at all. You were willing to betray your own brother for your friend. How perverse. Sacrificing brothers seems to run in your family. But please, not for a shabby little army doctor! Dear me, Mr Holmes."
"How about you, Dr Watson? How are you dealing with the fact that this was all just a set-up?" Dr Kenny asked, turning to John.
"The case was in a critical phase." Sherlock was ashamed as he heard himself say the words, even if they were true.
A profound silence descended on them. There was nothing more to say. They had arrived at a place that was both unknown and familiar. So incredibly familiar.
John smiled. "Of course! You gave them to me. I admit I'm a bit rusty. It's been a few years. But I've started lessons at the RCM. It feels really good to work with the instrument intensively again."
"That won't be possible, unfortunately. We need your shoes, and you're under arrest for the time being. The Yard will be here soon. Stay calm and pray." Sherlock smirked, then turned to John. "Stay here and make sure no one lets him out. I'll see where I can get reception and inform Lestrade."
It had been difficult for John to give up his practise. A young married couple, both doctors, had bought it from him; she was a GP, he was a homeopath. John used the money to renovate the cottage. The bathroom facilities needed updating, it was time for new wood floors in both upstairs rooms, and the windows were in need of better insulation. Sherlock had drawn up a plan of the house, but there was no discussion about who would get which room. Sherlock took the larger room in the upper storey, John the smaller one. They kept things exactly the same as on Baker Street: Sherlock's double bed was their shared sleeping space, while John's single served as a place to withdraw to. They put their old furniture into the generous living space and pretty soon it looked like their living room in London, just a little more rustic.
John reached for the bony fingers that lay restless in Sherlock's lap, took both hands between his, encircling them with his warmth and the peace that he felt, that seemed to be surrounding them like a blanket. A shell of darkness and comfort, of admissions and a new togetherness.
He had heard it, though. And it irritated him. It irritated him immensely that everyone, without exception, was sticking their nose into whatever was happening between himself and John. It wasn't anyone else's business. It irritated him that everyone thought they had to tell him that John loved him. Of course John loved him. There had been plenty of moments during their friendship when that had been made abundantly clear. And it was mutual. Of course it was. How else could they have taken so much from each other and alongside each other. Why did everyone think he and John didn't know that? They were neither naïve nor stupid. They both knew they loved each other. That wasn't the problem. That really wasn't the problem. The problem was that they didn't know how to deal with it.
Had he really seen enough? Sherlock wasn't sure. He didn't know what he was looking for. He couldn't make heads or tails of the body. He was unable to make any sense of the data points he'd collected. He lacked the mental acuity. He couldn't concentrate. He had a headache. And his thoughts were miles away. Scattered. Scattered by some emotional interference that flashed into his brain from somewhere deep down, flickering through it and making it impossible for him to focus. He needed John. Now. Here. John's professional analysis of the body, his remarks and assumptions – they would be irrelevant and misguided, naturally, but they would help Sherlock get onto the right track. Help him to exclude things, narrow down and pinpoint the facts. Help him draw the right conclusions. John was missing.
"No, of course not. There are particles of diamond dust in the clay I found at the first crime scene. The killer must have had it on his shoes. It matches the physical and chemical markers of the gems from the crown jewels."
"It was an option for me too," John finally said. "I would have gone for Martin, and gone gladly, if not for you. You were always there. In the background. In my thoughts. Not as my ex, but as a... possibility. I was fighting for it. It was harder than I'd thought."
There were signs of a struggle. The cantonal police had recovered a shoe from a rock outcropping at the top of the falls that was accessible by foot. It wasn't Sherlock's. On the other hand, the bloody fingerprints on the rocks were unmistakably identified as belonging to the younger Holmes. Just like the torn scrap of cloth from Sherlock's shirt, smeared with blood. Sherlock's blood.
"Secure the evidence from the room here," Sherlock said. "Get all the prints from the cot and the door. Put out an APW on Mary, Sophie and the woman. And on the black Ford with the number LD58 CFY."
Sherlock was already there. John went straight to the tall, slender figure leaning casually against the wall beneath the grinning Cupid. The flashing neon letters lit up the drizzling rain and the angular face underneath the dark curls in blue, red, and yellow. Sherlock had his coat collar turned up, his hands buried in the pockets. He grabbed John by the arm as soon as he was within reach and dragged him through the small doorway into the hotel, all without saying a word.
John sent him a dark look. Phil smiled. Then he looked over at John, still smiling and calm, giving him all of his attention.
Dr Melicia Kenny burst out laughing. A strand of her kinky grey hair had fallen out of the band she'd used to tie it together at the nape of her neck. The loose hair dangled in her face. Her green-blue eyes sparkled with uninhibited amusement and numerous creases appeared around her eyes.
John took a look around. The chapel was otherwise empty. No bench, nothing. Just the crucifix. It was mounted on a simple sandstone base and attached to the wall at the back with a metal strut.
"He seemed to know something, but didn't want to talk about it. Then we fell in love with each other. We shared so much. Our faith, a fascination for the ancient fraternities and traditions, the Latin liturgy, myths and mysteries. I would have been willing to set aside my vow of chastity and leave the Order. Things were that serious between us. It was bad. A struggle with no way to win. Thomas hadn't taken a vow of chastity, but he confessed to me that he was bonded to someone else and unable to break the sacred bond. We were madly in love, confused and out of our heads with a passion we were unable to act on. It destroyed any sense of reason we might have had. We were on fire, and fell into a feverish kind of madness."
The wind blew in John's face, waking him. The first rays of dawn. A distant rustling and howling. Odd, glassy light. John sat in the open doorway, damp with tears, exhausted from the pain. A gust of wind reached into the water trough, spraying water. The shutters rattled in the draft. John was instantly alert. The wind was coming from the mountain. In strong, irregular gusts. Warm and ominous. The foehn. Sherlock. Sherlock was out there somewhere in this storm. Or maybe not. Maybe he was already in a safe location.
John sat on the bench of the departure terminal at the airport and brooded to himself. He hadn't looked at the flights. He couldn't leave. He couldn't leave because he couldn't leave Sherlock alone. That was the truth. His truth. He could hit him and choke him, but he couldn't leave him.
John marched out, not saying anything more. He still felt like he'd been deceived, couldn't just sweep the feeling under the rug. Here he was, sent to the front lines but left in the dark. He went into Phil's office, opened the drawer and put the key on top of the desk.
Sherlock didn't respond. John took his hands away from his face and said calmly, "We're going to focus on those six words for three hours, Sherlock. On what they mean to us. What they mean for you, and for me, and for the two of us. Do you want to end this now? Before we've even started?"
"What good does that do me? Look at me! Look at me, John! My limbic system is reacting to your pheromones. Do you see what it's doing, hm? Do you see what it's doing to me? And yes: I know we're not helpless and at the mercy of our hormones. But I'm tired of fighting it. Do you get it? I don't want to anymore. I don't want to!"
"Callum passed the office of Grand Master on to Martin," John said. "He asked me to be respectful toward Martin. He thought a lot of him. I can't imagine he knew anything about the attack and just let Martin walk into the knife."
The interviews with Ferdinand Cameron Magnussen didn't provide much information, or better, none. The Magnussen brother turned out to be brilliant but psychologically unstable and exhibited behaviours that tended to indicate a pathological disorder. He raged, screamed, laughed, mocked, and insulted the officers. He spat at Sherlock when he participated in the interrogation. It was impossible to get anything out of him. The only information they had on him came from Rose, and she only shared it with Sherlock, who had signed the nondisclosure agreement. The Canadian secret service decided what information to share with whom. Not Sherlock. He had agreed to it. He'd taken everything John had, including Mary's will. But he couldn't share anything with him.
The force of the cold tore the air out of John's lungs as he exited the airport terminal. He stopped short, overwhelmed by the painful bite of the frost. The digital readout over the door showed the local time in Yakutsk and a temperature of -34 degrees Celsius. John went back inside behind the glass door, wrapped his scarf around his neck and face, tugged the hood of his parka up, and pulled the zipper all the way up. Gloves. He didn't have much hand luggage, just slung the duffel bag over his shoulder and stepped outside again.
John looked at him, startled for a moment, before a faint smile flitted across his face too. It was the first time Sherlock had seen him smile since Mary's death.
"It could be anywhere along the coast," Lestrade remarked. "They could drop her off in a lifeboat at any point."
They'd taken showers, then John had got into the narrow clinic bed with Sherlock. They'd lain there a long time in each other's arms, in the light of the moon shining through the wide-open window.
John's prick is plainly engorged, standing at attention in the half-light of the room. I suppress the impulse to touch it. I take a step back and observe Watson, just as he observes me. Slow and greedy. It is the first time we have had the opportunity to do so. The first time we have had the time and the space. The safety. The certainty that we are allowed.
Sherlock fell silent. John watched him, snorting with rage, the way he sat there, his face buried in his hands again, sunk in on himself. Pale. The rough woollen pullover smeared with blood. The gold ring on his finger.
“Mycroft will place us somewhere safe. We will have a simple enough excuse. Perhaps I have ill health and need a change of atmosphere while I care for our child. Perhaps I was concerned for our child and wanted Mycroft to put us somewhere safe. That one is true, you know.” She grinned as she glanced over his shoulder. “Now, go over there and welcome our boy back home.”
“Your final stop was to the Uni’s library for a period of research, the smell of must still clings to your coat and there is mud on your boots consistent with walking across the quads on university grounds.”
John paid him no mind, continuing his rant to the rafters. “Why do I do this? Always, I look for danger and I *get* it! I want to be a doctor; I end up in a war. I want to find a place to call home; I end up with a High-Functioning Sociopath as a flat-mate. By the way, there is no such thing anymore, it’s actually an Antisocial Personality Disorder, and you have complete control over it, which makes you a bloody brilliant detective but a cock-up of a friend.”
She leaned in and held him close, whispering, “I know, John. You have a heart big enough to love more than one person; me, Sherlock, and our baby. We are all in your heart. You love me, though you may no longer be *in* love with me. And I can deal with that as long as you *love* me. I know you love Sherlock. Hell, I know that you are *in* love with Sherlock and that doesn’t hurt me in the least. I also know you are totally and completely devoted to our child, I have no fear that you will be there for the both of us.”
Sherlock made as if to say something but instead held his tongue. They had gone over this the night Sherlock and Mary had told John about the massive lie and cover-up that had been perpetrated. No need to go over it all again. Besides, John didn’t think he would want to talk about it anyway. He’d had enough of it all, had enough of Mary and her evil past. All he wanted was to forget it had all happened.
John grimaced at the reminder but Sherlock’s hand grabbed John’s and squeezed to get his attention. “John, Mary does love you. She practically begged me not to tell you about her, but I know how you detest liars so I had to find a way for her to tell you herself. And you have to admit, you still love her just a little bit.”
John nodded at this. It made sense that Sherlock would test the boundaries of himself to see just how far he was willing to go. And knowing just how much Sherlock often retained in one meeting, only one of each gender would suffice for his experiments. “So you know something about what you are doing?”
. You're the most amazing mother I've ever had. Come along, John," Sherlock says as commandingly as ever, but instead of John having to rush after the swinging skirt of Sherlock's coat, it's Sherlock's hand at the small of John's back pressing him forward, towards the navy-blue carpeted stars. As they climb each step, John can feel the wool cloaked front of Sherlock's chest brushing against his back. An erotic thrill shivers through John's body at the thought of Sherlock crowded up against him like that. Sherlock's hand never leaves the small of John's back, not as they follow the plush navy carpet down a dark paneled hallway, nor as they enter a set of double doors that opens onto a small sitting room. In fact, Sherlock doesn't step away from John until there's a knock at the open door and Sherlock greets the young woman (presumably Jenny) who pushes in a cart laden with an impressive tea service. John's stomach growls.
, though, where he would see how very little John had accomplished in those thirty-eight years made him feel pathetic.
John picked up again with deeper, but slower thrusts, ones that didn't press directly on Andrew's prostate. He'd achieved a humming state of pleasure, and he felt like he could go all night. "How many times can you come like that?"
"It's bloody cold in here! Why've you got the curtains open? You're just letting all that cold seep into the room. And it wouldn't kill you to turn the gas on in the fireplace. It's not like you've got to build it up with logs the old-fashioned way or anything. It'd be nice to come in out of the freezing cold, and find a warm flat waiting for me."
After I delivered on my guarantee as to the quality of John's orgasm, and I had emptied my own balls deep inside his battered arse, we lay side by side, catching our breath. We were crowded together on one side of the bed to avoid the cum John had spewed all over the sheets. John was lying on his stomach, his arms along his body and his face turned towards me. I was on my back my hands gripping part of the iron railing of the headboard.
rather than just the desire to pleasure my partner. (Could it be related to breastfeeding in infancy? Scratch that. Not pillow talk, that.)
After that momentary brightness, listlessness settled over Sherlock again, and he found himself dropping into one of the table chairs, crossing his arms on the table top, and laying his head on them. He allowed his eyes to drift shut, the puttering sound of John in the kitchen at 221B again, a solacing background noise. He must have dozed off because the next thing he knew, John's fingers were browsing through his greasy hair.
When I was done, he looked up at me, vulnerable and trusting, I leaned down to kiss him. His tongue darted into my mouth and I hummed in pleasure. There was a sudden tension in his body that was probably a result of him attempting to touch me while we kissed and then being forcefully reminded his hands were no longer in his control. I smiled against his lips. When I pulled away, he was slightly breathless, his eyelids heavy.
With no other direction for how to proceed from this point, Sherlock did what he'd already planned to do after Audrey left, but before John got home—change the sheets, shower, and take everything that smelled like her down to the utility room across from 221C, where the washer and dryer were.
"Of course it mattered!" John yelled, leaning forward with the force of his sudden rage. "There is no
She lifts her eyes heavenward. "For God's sake, John, you work with a detective, so this should be an easy exercise for you. Think about it—what reasons do people have for keeping secrets?"
By early August, Sherlock said he felt well enough to start taking cases again, but John vetoed it, saying Sherlock should wait until he didn't tire so easily. They argued over what the phrase
"Sherlock," I chide. Then, without my eyes leaving Sherlock's, I say, "Thank you for the biscuits, Mrs. Hudson. They're lovely."
"Let me explain, please," Sherlock murmurs mournfully, crossing the few feet between them before John can react. John tries to take a step back, but Sherlock gets a hand around the back of John's neck and pulls him in. John has less than a second to think
"Oh, so that's all you want from me? My medical expertise and experience running a sheep farm on the off chance it'll come in handy?"
his grinned widened, and he tilted his chin down as he laughed, revealing multiple chins. After a moment, John grinned back. They stayed that way for a long, heady moment until Sherlock's grin faded, face growing solemn. He sat up, pulling his shoulders back and John braced himself for the incoming rejection.
"Right, right. That's—good. So, why all—" he gestures around us, then looks back at me with both brows raised.
." Sherlock makes a moue of disgust at the name. "You know, it never even occurred to me that there might be a time when we weren't together. He was supposed to be mine for the rest of our lives." Sherlock clasps his hands tightly and lets out a heavy sigh. "He destroyed me that day. He broke my heart, but not just that—I had never asked Victor to verify that we were together, like, like—
"Now I want you to undress completely, and then kneel right here." I pointed between my feet. I could see him start to work himself up to objecting and I rushed to stop him in his tracks. "Don't think about

But when he gets three fingers in me, I realize with frustration that I won't even last through his preparation. "Shit, fuck, John, hurry
Therefore, it was an unhappy surprise to discover, as he led John from the sitting room to his bedroom, that he felt uncertain, perhaps even
"Already experimenting with people at age six," John quipped, and Sherlock stared up at the ceiling and sighed with exasperation. "Sorry," John said, not sounding very sorry at all. "Continue."
exhausted. He'd worked hard to protect the integrity of his and John's relationship, to keep balance between his life with Audrey and Louisa, and his life with John, without either of them encroaching on the other. And now, here Audrey was—
"Single, lives alone, didn't show up to work yesterday," Greg said, consulting his Moleskin. "Her best friend hadn't been able to get ahold of her all weekend, so she came 'round and when the victim didn't answer the door, she tried the knob, found it open, came in, saw the body, phoned the police. The victim—name's, uh, Shelly Cleary—died sometime between late Friday night and early Saturday morning."
The woman stopped in front of them. As one, he and Sherlock moved away from the door to allow her access.
At midnight, John found himself in an alley behind a skip, bent over the body of a willing twenty something kid with the most luscious arse John had ever had the pleasure of sticking his dick in. The kid was quiet, but his enthusiasm was not in question, as he propped his hands against the dirty stone wall, and pushed back on John's cock, pulling him in with one slow glide. John hadn't had his dick in anyone's arse in a few years—he couldn't even remember the last bloke he'd fucked. Sherlock, unfortunately, didn't bottom —his prostate was too sensitive, and the only time they'd tried had been a disaster, leaving John equal parts peeved and guilty, and Sherlock almost obsequious in his apologies. As a doctor, John knew it wasn't Sherlock's fault—some men really did feel uncomfortably overstimulated when their prostate was touched. Sherlock didn't even like having it touched from the
That just made it that much more pleasurable to be pushing himself inside the beautiful arsehole of a kid probably fifteen years younger than him (and wasn't
"Come on, let's move on to the next gift or this is going to take all day," Sherlock says, talking over everyone else. He gives Sherrinford a pointed look using his hands to motion
This time Sherlock can't hide his reaction. His eyes widen and his lips part. His chest expands with a huge breath and he struggles momentarily to speak. John smiles wickedly, feeling as though he's scored a major point in their game of Q & A.
"Ugh," she replied, waving her hand in disgust. "I'm not stupid, you know. It's about you and Mum. She told me you were here, but then acted all quiet and serious like."
everyone else. I did not think I could take it ANY LONGER because all Dad's cousins and Uncle Mycroft and Aunt Caroline and all of my cousins and Grandad were there and it was just TOO MANY
Sherlock watched John's eyes close. His lips trembled and his brow was furrowed, but there was a brief few seconds during which Sherlock thought he'd gotten himself under control before John's face crumpled entirely and he put his face in his hands and wept. He was almost silent, his shoulders heaving. Sherlock was crying in sympathy, but he was much more vocal about it, could feel keening sounds that he hated hearing himself make.

Almost a year after I rescued my damsel in distress, I pack the Wagon with all my earthly possessions and stay one night in the Inveraray Inn. The next morning, I begin the eight-hour journey by car to London.
, you know what I mean? You can't have Geoff here on the side just in case. It's not fair to anyone. So. I laid the groundwork.
"Will you sit next to me in the front pew?" Sherlock asked, his beautiful, deep voice hoarse from crying.
Sherrinford and Will laugh, Sherlock snorts, and Charysa raises her voice and asks, "What's so funny? Why are you guys laughing?"
Eurus, on the other hand, says, "You don't have to be such an arsehole," to Sherlock before grabbing her sister and dragging her away.
Sherlock was late for the class, though not late enough to miss anything important. The seven other people in the hall were each standing up to give their names, their job description, and the name and breed of the dog who would help them fulfill that job. It was the kind of socializing that Sherlock hated most—stilted, embarrassing, and completely lacking in information that was actually helpful. Having gathered everything he wanted to know about his classmates, which was almost nothing, Sherlock turned his attention to the instructor.
It takes a little over two hours to get from Baker Street to the tiny village of East Hoathly. Once they get off the M23, the rest of the drive is spent passing through one little village after another with miles and miles of farms and pastureland in between.
"I don't know," John said, doing that slow casual head shake again and still staring at the journals.
I'm sorry these chapters are so small but I'm trying to keep everything in my life manageable by committing to smaller commitments of my time and energy. My emotional and physical health has been sorely tried the past 5 months, but I really love writing these stories and sharing them with you. So, you are stuck with shorter chapters, but the trade off is that I'm less likely to rush the ending!
when he looked at Dr. Watson. It was like the gut feelings he got sometimes on cases. He never guessed, because he based his deductions on what he could actually
"Now, I believe I intended to snog you senseless," John said and used one hand to curl around the nape of Sherlock's neck and laid the other on the back of the couch to balance himself. Sherlock thought
"How did you—" John starts to ask and then shakes his head. "Never mind." He pokes his head in further to get a glimpse of Sherlock who's glaring at his older brother while slouching down in the chair with an air of boredom. John rolls his eyes. These two, he knows, love to fight with each other, no matter how bored they pretend to be.
"I love you, I love you," John breathes out, whispering the words into the skin at the side of Sherlock's neck.
A veritable treasure, indeed, and one he can enjoy without, as Sherlock wrote, dealing with a horde of Holmeses.
Sherlock picked out a suit, then a shirt, boxer briefs, black cashmere socks, Italian leather Oxfords and donned each item with precision and attention to detail. Every bit of lint or crease was removed or steamed out. Sherlock checked himself in the mirror, using his fingers to artfully arrange a few wayward curls. He looked the way he always did when he dressed like this—wealthy, well-bred, good-looking, and brilliant with the exception of one thing he'd never seen in this mirror before now—heartbroken.
"Oh, yes, you're Sherlock's John," Mr. Holmes said with an air of sincere, if muted, delight. "It's so lovely to finally meet you. I'm Will."
"No. I ended it Tuesday night, when I realized that my feelings for you could no longer be—contained."
I prompted myself. I looked helplessly at Oasis who was staring back at me with concern glimmering in her black eyes. She reached out and grabbed my hand, holding onto it and patting it despite my attempts to remove it from her grasp. I made a noise of disgust and slumped a little closer, allowing myself to accept a modicum of her comfort before shifting away again.
"Keep going, don't stop," John muttered breathlessly as I stood staring at him with every nerve alight.
"What—" John began before his throat closed up. He cleared it, looked at the woman again and understood now the pity he'd seen in her eyes early.
"Get down," Sherlock hissed, trying to get Toby under control before John could witness too much of his undisciplined behavior.
! The note I wrote inside the card was written from my heart, welcoming him to the family, and I wanted
They are my cheerleaders, my squealing chorus of "Yasssss ohmygod you totally have to write that!" My sounding boards. My marriage counselors. My friends. Recipients of rants on many, many subjects. My dictionaries/thesauruses/providers of "what's that word?" They proofread. Analyze style. Correct grammar. They're unapologetically honest with me when I'm not putting out my best work. They answer questions I've asked a dozen times before.
John, who had come here—perhaps to save him, perhaps to push him lower, or maybe just because he left his favorite pair of socks behind—reached out, and steadied him. Sherlock swore he could feel the potent power of John's hands already beginning to infuse him with that healing glow that only John could give.
"This is from me and Will," Violet says, handing him a gift basket tied up with cellophane wrap. He doesn't open it at first because he can see what's in there—apples from Will's orchard, four yellow ramekins, and a recipe card for
Sherlock sighed, sounding much like Toby when he was forced into behaving, and flopped back down on his back. "I was being an arrogant arsehole, which—according to Greg—was a symptom of loneliness."
, I guess is the word I'd use. It worried me just as much as her threatening to kick me frightened me. It was uncharacteristic, and I could only conclude that it was my fault she was acting strange, so I began to cry again, and apologizing over and over. I told her it wasn't her fault, that it was mine, and that I'd lied, I could read that book, but I'd just wanted to sit in her lap."
"Oh my God, I'm so glad you're here! Well, c'mon! Don't just sit there with your mouth hanging open! I'm Eurus by the way," she says and grabs John by the arm.
"I'm going to fuck you," Sherlock says, the softness of his voice a contrast to the harshly commanding vulgarity. His face seems to crumple on itself as though he might cry, and John raises a hand to his shoulder in comfort. "I want you
John obeys and finds a laptop box—a Macbook, to be precise. "Is it actually a Macbook?" John asks nervously.
Sherlock set the glass of water down on the dresser while John hovered in the doorway, waiting for Sherlock to turn on the light. The click of a lamp switch was immediately followed by the buttery glow of dim light. Sherlock watched John blink as his eyes adjusted and when those eyes landed on him, Sherlock felt it under his skin; a half-nervous, half-anticipatory itch. Sherlock's name left John's lips on a sigh and Sherlock, no longer hesitant, reached out and grabbed John by both elbows and propelled their bodies together.
John's other hand was fisted in the fabric of Sherlock's shirt at the small of his back. Sherlock's hips drew a lazy arc against John's and John made one of those small humming sounds of pleasure that Sherlock had longed to hear. They kissed, open mouths breathing humidity in and out, while their lips continued to sip at each other, and their tongues to drink deeper. John had set a languid pace, but after a few minutes, Sherlock grew greedy and took control of the kiss, one hand cupping the back of John's head, the other gripping his jaw.
"That won't be necessary. It's actually not as bad as it looked last night. The swelling has gone down."
"—could he know all the details!" Sherrinford finishes, laughing lightly, and nodding her head. Her laughter fades. "Apparently, Sherlock was high, malnourished, and had been kipping on the street. Lestrade realized he wasn't the suspect fairly quickly, but didn't release him. He's sharp, DI Lestrade—he didn't
John glanced down at himself, and said, "Oh, yeah. I brought a bag. Took a week off work. That's alright with you, yeah?"
"Are you going to be my therapist now as well as my doctor?" Sherlock asked, but there was no bite in his voice.
"You asked me why I kept having sex with you, John," Sherlock snapped impatiently. "Do you want to know the answer or not?"
* We are now officially out of the Heavy Angst tag! YAY! Despite my aversion to tagging, there have been some changes and additions if you care to check them.
John eagerly does his bidding thinking nothing sounds better right now than a glass of whiskey and a seat by the fire with Sherlock's father. The Holmeses are growing on him, despite their inconvenient habit of sticking their noses into his personal life and Will has, so far, been the least pushy of the Holmeses.

Sending good sheep off to slaughter was the second hardest letting go I've done so far. The hardest, though, is letting go of the land—not the land I own—but the highlands themselves. I may have grown up in London, but I spent school vacations here when my grandfather was still alive. He died when I was fourteen and my father's mismanagement of the finances meant we had to sell and then it was no longer our land to visit. Coming back four years ago, I found my love for the desolate moors to be as strong as ever.
John had folded his hands behind his head, letting the thoughts, doubts, and fears parade through it, observing them. It smelled of wood now, like an open fire, the snug warmth of the hearth spreading to the upper storey. Sherlock was rummaging around in the rooms. When he finally crawled into bed with John, he'd showered as well, taken the splint off his leg and wrapped it up. He was freshly shaved and smelled spicy, like the shower gel he used. He lay close to John so that they were touching, head to head.
Sherlock heard John set the shopping bags down on the table, place his key beside them, and take off his jacket. Then he came in to Sherlock. John ran his hand down Sherlock's back, and Sherlock turned around and hugged him. The way he often did these days, answering a spontaneous instinct, tender and needy. In need of warmth and affirmation.
"Of course. These men allow themselves to be subject to death. They die in Christ. They become the Lamb who bears the sins of the world. A mystery which only opens to those who walk the path of the brotherhood. We should be getting back, John. You'll be wanting to change and prepare for mass."
"The game's already been played, Sherlock. The case is solved and you have the information. All that's left is to decide on the price. But I'll be fair: the little Watson for a Holmes."
"Not really. Except the fact that we now need to assume everything was planned out in detail. It must be someone who knew you would be going out again with Rosie that night."
Two days later, shortly after 10 p.m., John returned home from his late shift at St Bartholomew's Hospital and heard the long, low, drawn-out tones of the violin as soon as he started up the stairs. Something must have happened. Sherlock only did that when something was really bothering him.
"Well." Eurus returned to the plate glass. Something flickered behind the blue in her eyes that sent a cold shiver down Sherlock's spine. "In the end, isn't everything we do a trade? We trade materials for other materials, information for a favour, a favour for sex, sex for love, love for a life."
Mycroft sat down across from John, steepled his fingers and simply observed him for a moment. Then he said, "Well. You won't be flying to London."
John spoke quietly, then turned around and left, walked back up the path to the main building and left Sherlock standing there. Changes were happening. Quietly, in the background. Dr Kenny had spoken to him in private.
Before Sherlock could react, John reached up into Sherlock's hair, pulled him close and kissed him. The gesture was rough and powerful, the kiss tender and filled with an intimacy that made Sherlock reel. Their gazes brushed over each other, their fingers, before John picked up his bag, left the building through the sliding glass door and climbed into the taxi.
"And a different meaning," Sherlock agreed. "The woman had a small spider hanging from a thread. The thread is the message. It's emerging from her hair."
He still felt confused and unsettled inside. The weakness was still there, along with a sense of having been emptied out. Sherlock couldn't explain what had happened at Ella's. Something in him had broken, and he didn't know what it meant. But John was still here, was with him. John was closer than ever. Sherlock felt him. Felt his strength, his presence, his attentiveness. John was with him a hundred percent, even when he was lost in thought as he walked at Sherlock's side. John was here. That was the most important thing.
John was confused. He didn't know. It was just that quivering feebleness that had made him sit. There was grief. And desperation. And fear. John was having trouble breathing. Something was choking him. He felt as if he'd been left behind.
The sleep had done him good. Sherlock stood at the open window, breathed in the night air. He felt warm, relaxed, soft around the edges. He sat down in the armchair with a sigh, opened the violin case. Took out the bow, removed the torn out hairs, re-tightened it, applied fresh rosin. Then he took out the instrument, used the microfibre cloth to clean the strings, the fingerboard, the tuning pegs, wiped his fingerprints off the body.
"Most of the doctors at St Anna's belong to the same club. An academic old boys social club. All three victims attended regularly. The lads in Bury have evidence that the culprits can be found there. They meet in an old manor house just outside of town called 'Lucifer's Gardens'. Doctors and chemists get together with scientists from the technical college and literature and philosophy dons from the nearby university. Kind of stuffy, I reckon, you know, the usual. Academic snobbery. Discussions, debates, explaining how the world works, drinking whiskey, reading, networking." Lestrade's tone made it more than clear what he thought of institutions like that.
Sherlock switched to six-eight time. Better. The chatter ordered itself, grouped itself into clear combinations, took on form, started to breathe in long, calm, agogic movements. Ribbons. Strings of beads. Water droplets. The current of the Thames. The rustling of the leaves in the trees of Regent's Park when the west wind blew through.
John soaps up my back, and this time nothing stands in the way of the soft washing-brush. I feel John's bare body against my back, a slippery film of soap between us, as the brush moves across my chest, chafing my nipples, scrubbing my navel, over my hip to the rear, spreading the soapy foam between my cheeks. Then the brush slides forward, massaging the inside of my thighs, slow and seductive. I hear John panting at my nape as he starts to wash my prick, which is already hard. John's rampant cockstand insinuates itself behind my nether cheeks, rubbing amidst the suds, as the bristles of the brush with their firm strokes and gentle coddling quickly stimulate me to the point of climax. I am paralysed with fear and arousal. We are out in the open, anyone might see us. The circumstances arouse me even further, and the unfamiliar amalgam of emotions overpowers me. I am lost. John bites my shoulder with a choked-off gasp as my seed mixes with the soapy suds. For a moment, I believe I have fainted from the pain of the bite and the power of the release.
"John. The West Suffolk Hospital just called. Martin's not doing well. We should go over there. It's urgent. I'll get a taxi and pick you up. I'll be there in fifteen minutes."
Half an hour later, when they'd finally forced themselves to end the call, sleep was the furthest thing from Sherlock's mind. He lay on the couch, staring at the ceiling, his eyes wide open. It felt as if he were in a trance and couldn't be sure of his own thoughts. Something huge had just happened. He and John had cracked open their friendship. What came next was the adventure of a lifetime. It was going to hurt, Sherlock knew that. But he was prepared to risk it. He was prepared to go through all the insecurity and pain, even if it frightened him.
Sherlock felt himself shaking inside. He stood by the table at the window and stared at Mycroft sitting in John's chair. And at the same time, he stared helpless and bewildered at his own unbridled fury roiling inside him. Ultrafine bolts of energy that flashed through his neural network, setting off reactions. A strong flight instinct. The urge to free himself. To pick up the empty coffee cup from the desk and smash it in Mycroft's face. Sherlock's hand tingled. But before he could grab the cup, the room flickered before his eyes. He felt faint. Startled, he reached for the back of the chair next to him, gripped it hard, and expelled the air from his lungs in short gasps. His heart was racing. Much too fast. He was breathing as hard as if he'd just run a sprint. He clenched his fingers around the varnished wood, close to panic, felt the weakness in his body and the shaky, uncontrolled energy in his hands.
John was overwhelmed by the surge of panic. He gasped for air. Stared at the whitewashed ceiling with wide-open eyes. Sherlock. Where was Sherlock? Was he alive? A hot, black wave rose up in John's body, burning his throat, triggering a moan, flooding his eyes with tears. They ran out of him, copious, fast, ran down his temples on the left and right only to be swallowed by the pillow. He was powerless, felt the weakness like lead in his body. He couldn't move.
"John was so out of control that the police placed him in a psychiatric crisis intervention facility for the time being," Greg Lestrade explained.
"I know there are private things we need to set straight between us," Sherlock said. "But now is definitely the wrong time for that. He's here, and he's dangerous. Could we forget everything for a couple of days and concentrate on staying alive?"
Sherlock slammed the journal shut, gasped for air. He was sitting on the couch, staring at nothing, his eyes stinging. Tears ran down his cheeks. John had gone up to his room, and Sherlock considered storming up there, falling into his arms and begging for forgiveness. But then he reminded himself that the entry was several weeks old, and all in the past. And he focused on the present, swearing into the silence of the living room that he was going to be mindful and never again allow John to suffer so egregiously because of him.
Sherlock waited. His sister had already registered his presence. But she took her time, made him wait. Was probably scanning him. It wasn't until several long seconds had passed that she went to her bed, laid the violin in its case, loosened the bow, and placed it alongside. No rush. Only once she'd done that did she turn around and approach the glass – lazy, provocatively slow.
Sherlock kept reaching across the table to touch John's hand, just for a few moments. It was torture. They chatted about unimportant matters without really talking. Their eyes and their body language spoke only of one thing. And yet another one managed to make itself heard too. At some point, Sherlock slid the leather-bound binder across the table to John.
John stopped where he was. Closed his eyes. Rain pounded down on him, enveloping him. He tried to sense Sherlock, to find him with the eyes of his heart. But his heart was murky and sore. He needed to endure the pain and the fear. There was no reasonable alternative. Nothing he could change now. John turned around and went back to the Baer.
The cabin was small and rustic. Water came from the water trough in front of the house. A kitchen with a wood-burning stove, table and two benches, behind that the pantry and a tiny workshed that was only accessible from outside. At the back a steep set of stairs up to the upper level, a corridor on the side facing the mountain and two low rooms facing outward. Two single beds stood in the larger room, the smaller one was being used for storage. There was no electricity.
"Hasn't reported in again. I assume something's happened in the infirmary to delay the plan. But I don't have any information."
Sherlock pulled himself across the dirty floor in the direction from which the crying came. Every movement was agony just this side of what he could bear. Fortunately, Rosie hadn't gone far. She sat forlornly two or three metres behind the next concrete pillar, bawling. Sherlock had no idea how long it took him to reach the pillar. An eternity. Eternities of struggle and pain. Panting from the exertion, he pulled himself up to the pillar like a drowning man reaching the shore with the last of his strength.
"We'll have to get a sample to Lestrade." Sherlock drew a small plastic baggie out of the pocket of his coat and carefully slipped the bits of clay inside.
John swallowed. He looked into those light eyes, which had now become more certain, warmer. Sherlock's words were so unaccustomed that John had no idea what he might say in return. And so he didn't say anything, instead meeting his friend's gaze, allowing him to see that the words touched him and made him happy.
"I've got myself all twisted up, Sherlock," he said without looking up, no strength left. "Help me, please. Help me to come closer to you." And he added hesitantly, "If you can."
"Our father and his brother built a farm with the help of our grandfather. Alistair and I were still quite small. But the property burnt down. Our mother was killed. Everything was destroyed, all of our possessions. Many of the animals died too. The fire was caused by the portable forge, whose flue hadn't been cleaned properly. Old Mr Waugh – James' father – had borrowed it and used it, then returned it to the barn without removing all of the embers. A spark set off the whole farm. We had no money. Father sold some land and was able to use the proceeds to purchase the old, run-down house we live in now. Waugh was acquitted, even though our father kept trying to have him charged. That lost us even more money and land."
He is standing in front of me, looking at my plate. I have not stirred anything in yet. He has seen it. Saw me sprinkling something over my food when he entered the kitchen.
"They might have been watching you. But they hired the car at 4 pm. How could they know you'd go out with Rosie that evening at 10?"
"We should probably get up anyway," John said. "And we should call Linda and let her know we'll come by later."
"John." His voice very low, soft as satin. "John. I honour you. Your spirit. Your soul. Your body. I will be attentive and respectful in each of my thoughts and actions. This I promise you."
An old woman who had come out of the clinic right behind him held an open bottle of vodka out under his nose. John took it and drank. Not just one sip, but several. The liquid burned and warmed him. John returned the bottle. He reached into his jacket, pulled out a bank note, but the old woman waved it off, murmured something, a cloud of steam in front of her face, and tottered off. John watched her go, a dark, bent figure, woollen blanket pulled over her head and shoulders, a slow, limping gait. She was swallowed up by the grim night.
"Yes, a facility in Gloucester produces them. Monasteries and churches buy them in bulk. We turned the entire facility upside-down. Nothing."
"You lied to me," John said, hurt. "Why? You said I was the only one who knew but the pie was already on the list."
. Would he have done that? Would he have written those words back to Sherlock if the conditions were different? In real life, no games? Yes, most likely. If Sherlock allowed such open communication, then he would too.
John felt the tingling in his body. A vibration that took hold of every fibre of his being, making him shudder. He stood there in front of Sherlock and pulled his jumper over his head. Sherlock's eyes fixed on his. He nodded mutely. John took off his shoes, then his socks and t-shirt. Sherlock watched, rapt. John undid his belt, took off his trousers, and tossed them aside. He saw his own erection distending his underwear. Sherlock's salacious expression, his parted lips. Sherlock nodded again and John stepped out of his pants, discarding them.
I wouldn't know what to do without him. He is the cornerstone of my life. The ground on which I walk. I should tell him, but words don't suffice. Words aren't enough. They can't express what I want to tell him.
When he opened his eyes again and set down the violin, the first movement over, Eurus stood directly in front of him, right behind the glass. Something flashed behind her blue eyes as she said:
Sherlock carefully cleaned his violin with the cloth. "It needs to be realistic," he said. "Otherwise we don't have a chance."
The taxi driver nodded when John held the piece of paper out to him and indicated he didn't understand a word of what was said. The taxi stank of alcohol and perspiration. John leaned back against the torn upholstery of the back seat and stared out at the surreal cityscape. Frozen to high heaven. Big, desolate, cold.
"And as long as there are hot coals in the stove, please don't leave the door open without keeping an eye on it. You'll burn the whole house down if the foehn comes up."
"What's missing, Linda?" he whispered, his brain already formulating and analysing the next thoughts as he spoke. His gaze landed on John's grey, wide-eyed look of concern. Then he turned back to meet Linda's eyes and said, bewildered and in a tone of astonishment: "The women. What do we know about them?"
Sherlock needed to talk to him, break through this silent grief. They needed to find their way back to each other. Find their way to each other through all the shards. If that was even still possible. Maybe he could convince John to work with him again. He needed to try. The way they were living now was unbearable. Amidst this all-consuming disorientation, fixated on work, each for himself. Parallel to each other.
"You're the victim," I tell her. "How much longer will you allow yourself to be subjected to this? You're carrying a child!"
We lived on the strength of our love. I was blissfully happy. Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson. John had taken over a small practise. We solved complicated cases. It was the best time of my life.
Sherlock was watching him from the couch, his laptop on his knees. John didn't read any of the letters. He did take some out of their envelope, unfolded them, skimmed them quickly, but then folded them up again and stuffed them back in. Next. He also didn't sort out the bills the way he usually did.
“Ten minutes for an experiment is a useless waste of time!” Sherlock groused as he stood and paced back and forth in front of the sofa. John frowned and ducked his head. Maybe this wasn’t going to go so well after all. Just as he was about to say something Sherlock turned back to him and stopped, crouching close to the chair and saying with the fervent intensity that he normally reserved for his 'work', “But I’ll take it on the agreement that clothing above the belt line may be removed, perhaps?”
for the password. He knew he didn't have any chance of finding the right one in just a few seconds. He decided against trying
"A spider," Sherlock mused, "sits motionless in the middle of its web, registering every vibration in it, no matter how small or far away. And if something flies or falls into the web, the spider immediately goes to it, wraps that thing up until it's an immobilised bundle, clips it out of the web and sticks it under a leaf somewhere so it can suck it dry or dispose of it later, depending on whether it's edible for the spider or not. Correct? The first thing it does then is clean the web. Immediately. Because any little speck that gets stuck in it can disturb its perception."
"Not yet," Molly replied, "but we're still working on it. The complete report will be delivered to Greg this afternoon. You can look it over there."
John nodded. "It's at the flat. I have to go back there to get her papers anyway. I'll bring it back with me."
"Making do. I have a babysitter for Rosie where I can leave her overnight if necessary. That's a big help."
"A bond between priests. The ribbon tied around the cross in the brotherhood's icon. Ethan says the deaths are rooted in it."
The hospital room was silent for several long moments. Then Sherlock said pensively, "The escape is quite complex, especially taking the child into account. It was professionally planned. There must be helpers available to infiltrate daycare facilities and manipulate children, and others to organise forged passports and other documents. Documents that identify Eleonore Beatty as Chen Mortimer's wife and Valerie as his child, for example. We can therefore conclude that Marsden wasn't acting on his own."
"What makes you think that?" he finally asked, clearing his throat, his voice hoarse from the shock.
"Stop it, Sherlock!" After a moment, once again neutral: "Why should gay priests form some kind of group? Why murder? I'd think it would be more in their interest to keep quiet."
John patted down the pockets of his coat, searching for another cigarette, which he then inserted between his lips with shaky fingers and struck a match. It was promptly extinguished by the light night breeze that blew through the park. I raised my hands and cupped them around his to create a space that was sheltered from the wind so he could strike a second match. He allowed me. His hands were warm and trembling. His gaze brushed mine. There was so much affection between us in that brief moment when our hands touched. John lit the cigarette and let his hands slowly fall away from mine. I sensed the effort it cost him. He hesitated. He also hesitated. What was between us was not over yet. And we were playing with fire.
"Ella said I should just do it whenever I feel the need to," he explained. The apologetic undertone made it clear how insecure he was. "She said you'd let me know if it wasn't okay with you."
The birds gather on the overhead power line in the cool of the morning. Bird after bird. The string of pearls has grown. There are hundreds now. They sit silent and frozen. An orderly, black row. Suddenly, excitement: as if a breeze touched them, setting off a wave of unrest. A fraction of a second. Upheaval. They fly up, a trigger passed along through the rows. A black cloud lifts into the morning sky with a roar of wings. Here and there a caw. The birds fall into formation while in flight, a spiral figure drawn as if by an invisible hand. They wheel around, climbing higher and higher. Then the sudden return. As if struck by paralysis, single birds sink down and the others follow, settling on the line overhead as they were before, bird after bird, hundreds of them. Cawing, a din. It fades away after a while. The birds align themselves. Silence falls. An even distance between them. A mute, black string of pearls in the cool of the autumn morning.
Callum shook his head. "No, John," he said slowly. "He uncovers painful dependencies and frees men from the wrong partners. And he brings those together who belong together."
John had closed his eyes in surprise, taken a deep breath, filled with warmth and emotion and bewilderment. Then he'd turned his head, slid his fingers into Sherlock's hair, had felt Sherlock's breath on his lips and looked into those pale eyes.
I looked into his eyes and knew that I could reach out again, more forcefully, break his resistance, which would now be greatly diminished. His passion would awake. As would mine. Immediate. Fierce. Uncontrollable. We would make love out here in the O'Gradys' snow-covered park, unrestrained, unable to master our own selves. We knew each other long enough and well enough. We were playing with fire in a quite irresponsible manner.
Several long, heavy breaths passed before Sherlock answered: "My body wants to be with you. It won't give me any peace. My head wants to be free of these... things, though. Clear."
Ethan nodded thoughtfully. "All right," he said quietly. Several long seconds passed before he began. "I met Thomas on the Way of St James. I walked it for several weeks, and our paths kept crossing. We ended up walking part of it together. We prayed the offices together in Latin. Other than that, we didn't talk. We'd both taken a vow to walk the road in silence. We didn't discover until we reached Santiago that we were both priests. And I discovered in Santiago how deeply that peacefulness of our time together on the journey had touched me, how connected I felt to him."
"Are you going to forbid me?" John asked tiredly, with an undertone of aggression and disappointment.
Sherlock thought about it for a moment. "We should warn him at any rate," he said. "I'll do that along with trying to find out where the celebration is being held. Maybe you can find out more about the Celtic Circle."
"We're retired, John. We have all the time in the world. I'll be back tomorrow evening at the latest."
John nodded. He would do that, and it wouldn't be difficult. He nodded, meeting Sherlock's eye, and the message was clear between them. Sherlock was part of this. He was strong. Emotionally strong. As solid as a rock where John was concerned. And their … love? Sherlock had accepted the label on his declaration of love, and even confirmed it. John admired Sherlock for that. Admired him for his courage, for his unexpected clarity on things that must be new to him. Or maybe not. John didn't know, and he realised how little he actually knew about Sherlock's past.
"The Lover is imprinted in early childhood," Martin explained. "He's the shield of primitive trust. The Warrior awakens as soon as the boy is weaned from his mother. He recognises his needs and achieves independence. The Magician is formed in early manhood. It's all about moving past your own limits. The King is the man in maturity. He unites heart and mind and stands at the peak of his strength. We carry all of these aspects inside us. We are infant, boy, young man, and adult in one. That is the systemic departure point. We are a system of the development of our souls. Is the theory clear?" Martin smiled.
Sherlock took a deep breath, in and out. Each and every fibre of his overworked body hurt. His heart was raw. Grit scratched in his eyes. Something had a chokehold on his throat. Loneliness. Emptiness. Bottomless exhaustion. Sherlock tried to relax. He had no strength left. Everything was off kilter. He had nothing to hold on to. He felt lost, alone, overwhelmed. Sherlock took the relief that offered itself: he cried. A hot, salty stream in his hands. He was shaken with misery and weakness. He tried to breathe calmly in between sobs. Waited until it passed.
He took a stand directly in front of Mycroft and said, "Sherlock has disappeared. He wanted to meet with Moriarty, and we're wasting time here with fairy tales. I demand to know the truth, Mycroft. Right now!"
Then I heard footsteps. I could scarcely believe my ears; I fairly swooned. HIS footsteps. He ascended the stairs – slowly – opened the door and then stopped short. I was frozen and did not move. He moved through the living room to the fireplace and said curtly, "You might at least have lit the fire."
But then John stops, shortly before we reach our climax. We are both panting uncontrollably from our tempestuous heat, and I want only one thing: everything, no holds barred. Watson holds me from behind, surrounding me, inveigles his tongue into my ear and moans: "Sherlock."
With his eyes closed the rest of his senses jumped to the fore in order to tell him exactly what Sherlock was doing. After the jumper was discarded Sherlock moved on to the front of John’s button up, slipping each button free deftly and without any serious sense of urgency to undress him. Reaching the final button before the belt line, as their agreement stipulated, Sherlock stopped briefly and pulled the sides of his shirt open, allowing his hands to reach John’s skin.
John stood up before Sherlock with a questioning gaze. “You are Asexual… That makes sense, in a way. So then what was that a few minutes ago? What was the kiss about, Sherlock?”
He’d already been caring for Sherlock in all the little ways he could since they had first met. He often made sure that Sherlock ate, slept and worked efficiently while remembering the social decorum’s that were needed in day to day life. In short, he helped Sherlock function as a human being, something that he was never very sure that Sherlock really appreciated.
Sherlock looked like he wanted to be sick. “As far as necessary. They put their skills to the test with me and I learned quite a bit.”
“Do what?” asked John. He took a sip of his tea and waited. Sherlock waved a hand absently before speaking.
Sherlock nodded, “Oh indeed.” He sat up a bit straighter and made as if to move away from John, but John seemed unwilling to release his arm and hand yet. He frowned a bit. “John, I think it would be better if we—.”
For instance, before John left for the day, he had checked the fridge and noted that there was milk and Sherlock’s favorite jam. He made sure that the sitting room was tidy and that the kettle was filled with water for tea. He then had left a note on Sherlock’s microscope which admonished him to eat something. He only hoped now that Sherlock had taken his advice.
The next morning John left early although he didn’t have a shift at the clinic. He did feel the need for research. And so after several hours and four different places John returned to Baker Street armed with what he hoped was enough information to come to a decision.
“Sherlock, what’s wrong? Did I say something to upset you?” John’s face, his eyes, stared up at Sherlock and seemed to ask a hundred questions at once. Sherlock swayed under the onslaught wave of feelings that John’s touch had elicited in him.
John was so taken aback by Sherlock’s sudden shift that he had to stop and think a moment before answering. “Well, I suppose that would be… acceptable. Yes, clothing above the belt line may be removed.”
He had lost count the number of times he had circled the room, his head spinning, his thoughts going round and round. On his last pass he paced very close to where John was sitting, so close that John reached out and took hold of his wrist lightly, pulling Sherlock to a stop. He stared down at the hand circling his wrist. A doctor’s hand, a surgeon’s hand. A soldier’s hand. The hand of one who liked him (loved him?). A hand that was attached to the man who looked very worried that Sherlock might have just lost his mind.
John pretended to ignore the fact that Sherlock had fairly jumped at the chance to use his skills. In fact he thought it was great fun to challenge the other man to see how well his movements of the morning could be tracked at a glance. And Sherlock had obviously been paying a lot of attention to John since the moment he had walked into the flat. That being said, Sherlock apparently decided to start from the top.
Sherlock’s eyes slipped shut. His breath came out stuttered and for a moment John thought he was having trouble breathing, but then he noticed the wetness seeping from Sherlock’s lashes. “Sherlock, what’s wrong?”
John jumped at the chill from Sherlock’s fingertips and Sherlock instantly pulled back, breaking the kiss and checking that John was alright by looking him in the eyes again. “Sorry.” He apologized.
Rather she was an assassin, an operative. Ultimately an unknown face attached to some unknown history that he would never know. Or that he was afraid to know really. After the first night back from Hospital with Sherlock, again, John had handed Sherlock the memory stick and told him to read it for him. He didn’t want to read it, didn’t want to be caught off guard. Sherlock could read it, assimilate the data and tell John what he wanted to know. What he *needed* to know. Sherlock had nodded before slipping it into his laptop and waving John away.
John watched with amusement as the man struggled not to say anything when he knew damned well that he wanted nothing but to launch into a long oration of John’s morning travels and stops. Finally he decided to give in and let the man do what he did best. Setting down his cup, he turned to face Sherlock, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees. With a hint of a smile he threw out the challenge to Sherlock, “Care to try and deduce what I have been up to this morning?"
“Good, you’re eating something.” He said. Sherlock looked at the toast on his plate and the cup of tea he had just made and rolled his eyes before answering.
Sherlock sat in his chair, hardly moving so as not to pop his stiches again. John had already threatened to tie him to the bed if he tried to move too much. It had garnered a smoldering glance his direction yet Sherlock *was* acting more careful than he usually did. Now he sat and watched John pace back and forth with that knowing gaze he often used on John when he was sizing him up for something.
He didn’t want to take her back. He’d said as much to Sherlock and got that look from the other man again. That look that said ‘Please don’t be ridiculous, John.’ But he wasn’t being ridiculous, the woman had *lied* to him! She wasn’t what he had married, dated, or even met in the first place!
“Professionals with some experience, yes. This was before the drugs and I had plenty of money. I hired the woman on one night and spent an entire evening with her, dinner and dancing and then a hotel room. Three nights later, the man was engaged, although we didn’t go anywhere near the same places as I took the woman.”
