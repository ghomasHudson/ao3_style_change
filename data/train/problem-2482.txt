"Now, soldier," Dean said, turning off Baby's engine, "your mission is to pick out as many goddamn plants and other shit you want. Succulents? Great. One of those freaky spider-looking things? Cool. Weird-shaped pots? Go for it, pal. Just remember we need fertilizer and seeds, okay?"
Moving to the Capital was the greatest thing that had ever happened to Sam. He passed his days in intellectual pursuits, trained to become a healer, spent his free moments walking arm in arm with Jessica and, by his measurement, had grown a few more inches over the last season. The incident with Walker over, Sam now had the means to defend himself due to his regular fighting lessons with Dean and he had been given more freedom, as he proved he could take care of himself as needed.
“Um, yes.” Castiel stared down at his hands, his fingers bunched up in the fabric of his pants. “I encountered them when I first came to the Realm. I healed their sick in thanks for taking me in. They thought I was Joshua in a new form. They refused to believe me when I said I was not.” Castiel picked at a loose thread near his knee. “I am not worthy of the title in the least.”
“You’re hurt.” Castiel sat on the floor. He reached out to the blonde woman but pulled back in response to both women’s reproachful glares. “I can help.”
Dean sagged against Ellen when she hugged him. At that moment, he let himself cling to her just like he had as a boy. Back then, the worst thing he had to deal with was skinned knees and a few black eyes. Now, there was so much more weighing on him. Dean buried his face into Ellen’s hair, smelled the familiar scent of the soap she used, and let his tears fall.
Bathed in the light of Heaven, Dean was radiant. It glimmered off the water in Dean's eyes. It almost looked like they were filled with tears.
“Oh, but I have. I’ve done a lot while you were running around in that forest.” The Metatron indicated the body he possessed. “Recently, I made a prophet.”
“I have reports about all our recruits.” The nearby bottle was empty, but the Captain shook it anyway. He sighed and set it back down. When he looked up, Dean’s eyes burned with an unspoken question. “I’ll admit. The name Winchester caught my eye.”
He yanked his hand away. The remaining light fell back down into the cage, scattering like snowflakes. Sam grabbed Dean's arm and pulled. Together, the brothers broke free.
Castiel could not run to Dean. All he could do was turn his head from one dying brother to the other.
“Do I-- Do I what?” Castiel narrowed his eyes and cocked his head to the side. Much to Dean’s annoyance-- or delight, he could not decide-- he found the expression adorable.
“There is no destiny, Balthazar. Only choices. This was the wrong one.” Castiel sat behind Sam and pressed a hand to his wound. Dean never looked up from where his face was buried in Sam’s shoulder. “Dean. Sam. You’re going to be okay.”
For someone who lived for an innumerable amount of years, Cas was one inpatient guy. He bucked his hips and, in the same motion, grabbed two generous handfuls of Dean’s ass and squeezed.
Castiel nodded and stood, eager to leave the room. As he opened the door, the Captain spoke to his retreating form.
Sure, Sparky is Dean’s new friend. It’s all warm and bouncy and tingly in a good way. However, the Empty houses all the dead demons and angels, some of whom should never awaken. Dean doesn’t want to think of names but he couldn’t stop the flash of milky white eyes in his mind.
“I don’t know if there’s rules or whatever against it but, once I’m outta here, you wanna go to dinner or something?”
Castiel returned with the emptied wheelbarrow, his eyes bright and cheeks red from exertion. His hair stood up every which way. Dean tried to push down the thought that popped into his mind when he saw Castiel like that. The thought was right, though. Castiel did look good.
It took hours and a giant pile of soiled cloths under the sink but Dean finally cleared away enough of the darkness to see the true colour of Cas's feathers underneath. In all his years of knowing Cas, Dean never thought to ask about the physical form of Cas's wings. Dean figured they were shadowy things, based on Cas showing them off in the barn back on the night they met.
“And I know you gotta go. I’m not trying to stop you. It’s just--” Jessica jumped to her feet and stood over Sam. She placed her hands over his own and leaned forward, catching his eyes. “It’s just that I’m worried. And, and, and, I only found out today. I mean, it’s sooner than we thought but I--”
“Come on, Grumpy,” Pamela said to Dean after their third round. “With a face like that, you must’ve left a few broken hearts back home.”
Kevin nodded, his forehead smacking against the metal. “Yes, yes. I see him sometimes. You too. They used to be just dreams but now it’s all the time.”
Even Aaron, as lazy as he could be, hit the bullseye with enough regularity that he was declared proficient. That was enough for him, so he skipped off to join Ash-- one of the healers-- for some 'herbal refreshments' hours ago.
Something stirred within Castiel's chest, something unfamiliar yet known, when he raised his gaze to Dean’s face. He did not put a name to it. He did not believe he should. All he knew was that Dean should wake up alone.
Castiel stood on the beach, Dean on one side of him and Sam on the other. A wall of opaque white fog obstructed his view of anything beyond arm's length. He heard the clash of swords, the snarl of Creatures, and fluttering wings.
“I know. I…” Castiel was trying to be a better ally. He was trying to share his knowledge. He was trying to no longer keep secrets. “I’m in need of some information. It may or may not pertain to the War. I’ll let you know once I find out.”
Dean sat at the temporary bar-- set up and ran by Jamie-- at the back of the ballroom far away from the dancefloor. He finished the one beer he allowed himself that evening and handed the empty glass to Jamie. He sought out the platform on the other side of the ballroom, watching the band.
After Dean finished giving orders to the guards, he planned to lead the new arrivals to the Captain’s office right away. Instead, he froze when he saw the blonde woman. She overwhelmed him with a sense of familiarity. Yet, at the same time, she felt like a stranger.
Sam worried. Sam worried about how the sanguis affected him on the metaphysical level. Sam worried that the dark part of him had festered, that ignoring it allowed it to rot him from the inside.
Sam and Dean stop at the same time and exchange glances. Yeah, Sam feels it, too. As one, Sam and Dean continue forward.
“When did you grow up?” Dean asked, his voice cracking. He pulled Sam in under his chin like he did when they were younger and tried to blink away the tears in his eyes. “Congratulations.”
“Yes.” The Mother ran her hand over her arm from shoulder to wrist. “You asked me why I chose this form. Well, that is how this whole story started: a woman died, spurring a bunch of men into action because of it. But, I ask you: Who was she? Who was Mary Winchester?”
“I gotta wonder,” Charlie said, “why they always give Dean a hard time. I mean, I don’t know a whole lot about what happened, but you were there too.”
Castiel, on the other hand, had never heard it before and was enraptured. He nodded and gasped at the proper times, bolstering Kurbrick’s storytelling to new heights.
A few moments later, Castiel lay in Dean’s bed with fresh, clean bandages wrapped around nearly all his torso. Dean did not know what else to do, so he tucked Castiel into bed, trying to keep him comfortable. Dean pushed back Castiel’s hair from his forehead, making sure his temperature was stable. Dean checked to make sure he was breathing. Dean checked to make sure he was alive.
“Cas is going with you?” When Dean nodded, tension melted off Sam's shoulders. “Oh, good. That makes me feel better.”
It’s overwhelming, even now. Dean doesn’t know how much time has actually passed since Cas’s declaration. It feels like a long time but a dream, even a poor one crafted by the Empty, can span a lifetime in a blink of an eye.
Jo rested her elbows on the bar, placed her chin in her hands, and smiled. “Glad you two managed to figure yourselves out.”
"Actually, um…" Dean rubbed the back of his neck. "You think you could call Jody to check it out? I kinda…"
“You--” Dean snorted. He saw the real concern on Castiel’s face and tried to hold back his laughter. It did not work. “You’re hungry.”
Dean lowered his voice, gruff like Castiel. “‘--Like you humans.’” Dean waved a dismissive hand and returned his voice to normal. “Whatever, dude. You were definitely sleeping back in my room at the tavern. I’m pretty sure that was the last time.”
Dean raised his sword and launched himself straight towards Castiel. It was the most obvious and rash form of attack. Castiel shook his head and took one step to the side. Dean barrelled past Castiel, nearly tripping over his feet in his attempt to stop.
“Hold up.” Sam stumbled over his words. “Hold up. You’re saying that and yet you’re mad people think you should ask him out?”
His head ached and the beam of light was not helping. Castiel grumbled, fighting the urge to sink back into the bed and squish the pillow against his eyes, and sat up.
Dean’s answering chuckle was short lived. A large, well-armed crowd gathered outside the castle gates. The guards on duty tried to push the crowd back, wary of their weapons. Everyone spoke at once. Arguments overlapped each other and no one could get their point across. Dean signalled for Charlie to keep her distance then carefully approached the gate.
One second, Dean stood staring at Castiel, trying to anticipate the next move. The next second, he lay staring at the clouds in the sky, trying to remember how his lungs worked.
Of course, at that very moment, the recruit turned around. Castiel stared and could not place him. It was understandable, really, that Castiel could not recognize Dean. They met once, years ago, and Dean was not the youth of his memories. Dean had grown into a man, his shoulders broad and his arms muscled from years of training with his father’s sword. Dean, on the other hand, recognized Castiel right away. It was hard to forget his first real crush. Not that Dean would admit that was the reason.
“I suppose not. I--” Castiel leaned forward, putting his head between his knees to alleviate his dizziness.
“It’s Sam.” He held up the knife and gestured toward Dean and Castiel. “And you better leave them alone.”
Castiel swallowed, his throat dry. The fire crackled, swaying in the light ocean breeze. As long as the ocean remained calm, Castiel could keep that fire, keep that light. He did not want to douse it. Not tonight.
Dean began to feel self-conscious about the blue shirt he chose. He hadn't purposely chosen something that matched Cas's eyes. It just happened.
Dean raised his sword. He knew he was outmatched. Balthazar was a full-powered Celestial. Dean was a human. It did not stop Dean from surging forward. Benny grabbed Dean’s shoulder to stop his charge.
The fever broke that night. In desperate need of a shower, Dean had to untangle from Cas before he could leave the room. Cas stirred when Dean left and reached out to hug Dean’s pillow to his chest.
Dean folded his hands in his lap and squeezed them together. He did not have the words for what he wanted to say. He needed to express the feeling, deep in his core that always guided him true, that something was wrong. Castiel left in the middle of the mission. No warrior did that lightly. There was also the fact that-- though Dean would never say it aloud-- Dean did not want to believe Castiel would leave him without saying something first.
“Probably sitting on the shore somewhere, staring off into the distance thinking deep thoughts.” Meg shrugged, appearing indifferent, but the corner of her mouth twitched upward. “He does that a lot.”
Cas’s wings flutter when he joins Dean. “You just have to remain until the last one is through.” Cas holds his fist out to Dean. “Someone wishes to see you.”
Months of instruction, including a session on the importance of courtly manners and how to address those above him in rank, and Dean never lost his casual attitude toward Castiel. Castiel never reprimanded him.
The vampires’ mouths shut. The heads rolled to the side, no longer held up by whatever magic the Metatron used. Castiel stared at the female vampire’s cold, dead eyes and, no matter how hard he tried, could not make the heads speak again.
Dean opened his eyes. A man leaned over Dean, a man with blue eyes, messy dark hair, and full lips. He wore a white doctor's coat and Dean turned his head to see the guy’s feet.
An hour later, the villagers began filtering in. Dean busied himself with serving drinks to everyone in the rapidly filling tavern, falling back into the familiar pattern of his youth. He laughed off Kurbrick’s comments, slipped Victor an extra shot of whiskey, and respected Robin’s decision to ignore him.
Not today. He may be confined to the castle, but that did not mean he could not use his sword. Castiel headed for the training grounds, expecting few people to be there so late in the day.
The walls Andrea’s Tavern echoed with the laughs of happy drunks and the music of a traveling bard. The patrons danced to the music and sang every drinking song they knew. Garth loved to dance. He was not particularly good at it but that did not matter once the drink started to flow. He attracted a crowd who tried to imitate his odd, jerking movements.
Once the door closed behind Sam and Jack, Dean pulled Castiel into a tight, desperate hug. Dean trembled. Castiel could feel it all through his body. Castiel rested his hands on Dean’s back and waited.
Captain Singer stepped forward and began the introductions. His words resounded over the crowd, full of life and hope and honour. The Captian had a lot of experience enrapturing a crowd and it showed in the people's faces. Unlike the weary old speech he used for the fresh recruits each year, Captain Singer's words were new and tempered with the steel of his conviction. He believed in his cause. The people could hear it.
Arms around each other’s shoulders, Sam and Dean walked out of the room. Dean stopped briefly to tell Pamela that they were headed home. Dean waved goodbye. He never looked at Castiel.
Behind Dean and Castiel, Charlie looked at Sam. Sam looked at Charlie. In unison, they stood and hurried from the room.
With a thoughtful finger against his lips, Castiel said, "Perhaps we should meet up after the noon bell."
Continuing his grumbling, Dean opened the door. When he saw Castiel sitting up in his bed under the blanket, Dean’s tension dissolved. He stopped and stood in the doorway, staring. Sam pushed Dean to move further into the room, then dragged the desk chair toward the bed. Dean sat on the foot of Castiel’s bed.
"You know, it's really hard to get anything done without a corporal body. I know, I know. The red tape-- it’ll drive you nuts.” The man who claimed to be John tapped his temple. “He’s still in here, you know. All that stuff we talked about? True.”
That made a teeny, tiny little smile appear on Baby Cas's lips. He ducked his head just like Grown-up Cas would. Baby Cas let go of Dean’s finger and settled back into Dean's chest.
The Captain closed his eyes and took a deep, visible breath. He shrugged off Sam’s hands, then continued down the hall at a calmer pace. Sam followed him. When they reached the doorway, the guards on duty resolutely stared at the stone above the Captain's head. They opened the door at the Captain’s command.
No. That did not matter. None of it mattered. He had no past, no future. He was of Purgatory. In Purgatory, the only thing that mattered was the present. The only thing that mattered was the mission.
“Exactly! ‘Cannot be reached.’ Not missing. Not dead.” The king closed in on Dean. “You were the one who saw him last. Therefore, you know where he is.”
“You,” Dean said, slapping a pungent smelling paste onto Castiel’s chest, “are really fucking stupid.”
“For calling me Cas,” Castiel said. He took another drink, the mug half empty when he set it down. “I haven’t been called that for a very long time.”
“Like,” Dean began, setting on his most familiar topic, “Sam. He’s a full-fledged healer these days. He does research too. I bet he’s going to read his way through the library soon.”
“If Sam keeps hanging out with the scholars is he also going to spring a bunch of deep philosophy on me out of nowhere? Because my head can only take so much.”
It was so easy to make Castiel smile. The silence stretched between them, but it was a comfortable sort of quiet, the kind of quiet that healed the soul.
"What are you--" Sam hunched over, trying to think over the ache in his head. "I never told you my name."
Every seed planted in the meadow bloomed in a matter of weeks. It didn't matter if it was out of season, normally took months to sprout, or was a finicky seed that needed special soil. All of them found life.
“Well, first of all, Joshua-- as he prefers to be called these days-- is the Son of God. The last known born Celestial. And, secondly, he’s an old man.”
“Do you think that’s true?” Lenore asked. “We Creatures were humans once. Did you ever stop to wonder how the first Creatures of the Night were made?” She raised her hand when Balthazar opened his mouth to answer. “The All-Father is not all that was and is not all that will ever be.”
The small group made good time. The Creature’s enhanced vision allowed them to march past nightfall. Sam did not let his human sensibilities slow him down but he still stumbled in the dark. He did not look at the indistinct shape which tripped him, choosing to believe it was a large piece of driftwood. A hand gripped his arm to keep him from falling, then hooked around his elbow. Andrea’s green eyes shone unnaturally in the darkness when Sam met them. He nodded his thanks and held onto her arm as they continued across the beach.
Dean awoke in the world's warmest and most comfortable bed, to the sound of the morning news. The perky news anchors chattered about an unexpected meteor last night. He opened his eyes in time to see blurry footage of a silvery blue streak of light falling from the night sky.
The troubadours must have been near out of breath with how slow the procession moved, forced to play the same shrill notes over and over again as they marched. The recruits watched the display. All this ceremony was for them, of course, to reassure them that they would fight for a great nation. King Adam glared when he saw Castiel. As the procession passed by, Castiel felt the king's anger at the standing Angel, refusing to wear the armour the servants left in his room.
Dean knew that someday everyone was going to leave him. Dean knew that he had finally reached that someday.
Sam took one last look down the route to Andrea's Tavern. He raised his eyes to the dark sky and sent out a thought for Dean. It was a hope for his safety and an apology.
is your fatal flaw now. You’re in love...” The Metatron lay a hand over Dean’s chest, right against his heart. “...with humanity. Much more poetic, don’t you think?”
Castiel sank to the floor, breaths heaving, and grabbed the vampire's face. The vampire did not fight him or hiss. Castiel's heart beat faster. It had to have worked. It had to.
Yet, he was not Celestial either. He could age. He had no wings. He was something else. Something in between. Something alone.
A task force: four names on a slip of paper, every one a fresh recruit. It was absurd. He led armies in service of the All-Father-- God-- for untold years and now, at the behest of a child, he had to try and turn four of the freshest recruits into something respectable. Castiel took a long pull from the bottle and considered taking up Benny’s offer.
Castiel stared out over the dance floor. He did not reply. Dean grinned and let up on the teasing. At least, for as long as it took him to check on the still sleeping Aaron. He ordered some water from Jamie. Aaron would need it.
Dean jerked back from Castiel, his feet skidding across the floor as he retreated to the table. “I-- I-- I should probably--” Dean jabbed a thumb in the direction of the door.
When he got back to his apartment, Castiel smoked, showered and changed, smoked again, and then went next door to ring Anna. He probably should have invested in a phone, but she was really the only one he ever called with any frequency. And even that was mostly just to tell her he was on his way to or from another place. They rarely had actual conversations over the phone, but it was just as likely that it was due to the fact that he didn’t have his own phone, and didn’t feel particularly comfortable sitting in his neighbor’s living room to have a chat.
Which, of course, had Castiel coming right behind him. He had to steady himself with the hand he’d been using to stroke Dean, and he thought vaguely that he had only just changed the sheets. Dean squeezed him physically, his hand, his waist, his cock—still buried deep inside his body—and it felt like he had somehow managed to squeeze his heart too. Castiel couldn’t think. He couldn’t think about anything except how right this felt. How much he loved the man under him. How he had never stopped loving him, even if he hadn’t shown it like he should have. He wanted this forever, for the rest of his life—however long or short it was—and he never ever wanted to know what it was like to live without Dean again.
“Dinner is served,” Dean announced as Sam took a seat at one end of the table in one of the chairs that matched. “We’ve got meat pie for a main course, and apple pie for dessert. Figured if I was making pie, I might as well keep with the theme.” He carried the meat pie over to the table, where he carefully placed a slice on each of their plates.
Dinner, in a similar fashion to the ride over, was a mostly silent affair. However, Castiel felt it was a more companionable silence than their previous one. He supposed sharing a meal had a way of easing tensions that riding in a car with someone you weren’t quite sure if you were allowed to kiss again didn’t. Dean seemed less tense after his shower, and Castiel wondered if he had managed to wash away anxiety along with filth. He thought that if Sam had been there, he would have filled up the silence between them with questions or comments, and Castiel would have forgotten most of his own anxiety as well. He didn’t think of himself as good at conversation, but by the end of dinner, he felt that he had wasted time he could have spent getting to know Dean a little better. He could afford to learn from Sam’s example. It was difficult enough to get time alone with Dean as it was—he needed to take advantage of it when he had it, to hell with uncertainty.
“Lebanon is her hometown, as much as it’s ours.” Cassie Robinson was a bitter subject for Dean, despite the fact it had been years since they had last seen each other, let alone date. “Awww, let me guess. You get an invite?”
Dean pulled Cas into his arms and hugged him tightly. “Just because you didn’t need to hear it? Doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to.” He pulled back enough to look Cas in the eyes and smiled when he found them looking for him. “I love you, Cas.”
Dean swallowed roughly, watching Cas struggle to keep the straw in his mouth, and again as Cas licked away the milkshake that dribbled from the corner of his mouth. He handed Cas a napkin and quickly took a drink of his own shake.
After getting his ass whooped by Sam, Dean noticed that Garth had arrived. He was chatting with the rest of the group over their drinks. Dean and Sam returned, taking their seats as Benny talked about the increase of business at the diner.
“Just a moment. That’s all I’m asking. And if you want to quit after what I have to show you, then I have the solution for you too!”
“I wasn’t afraid, Charlie!” Dean shook his head. “I mean, yeah, the thought that I could possibly like Cas in the way he liked me? Yeah, that unsettled me a bit. But I didn’t know there was such a thing as Bisexual. And I knew I wasn’t gay. I liked girls. I dated Cassie Richardson Freshman year.”
“Nah, can I actually get a pack of Nails too?” Dean reached up and grabbed the cigarettes that Alistair asked for. “So, visiting your boyfriend? That’s beautiful. You’re such a loyal person, Lisa. It’s incredible to see.”
“Those look like burnt baked potatoes.” The customer paled and looked at Dean and the cigarettes. “But I need my fix, man. I know they’re bad for me, but I can breathe just fine. My lungs don’t feel like… like that.”
"Maybe what?" Cas took off his trenchcoat and jacket, laying them on the back of a chair, as he crossed to the bed and sat down on his side. He bent over and untied his shoes, kicking them off to the corner of the room. "Dean?"
"Goddammit, Sam," Dean grumbled quietly under his breath. "I'm sorry, you shouldn't feel pressured–"
“Quiet, Dean.” Cas walked over to the coolers and grabbed a lemonade before walking back to the counter. He tossed a couple of bucks to Dean and returned to his loitering lean. “Anyway, I was browsing this internet this morning, and I came across an interesting post on the local news site.” Cas reached down and grabbed a copy of the morning paper. He flipped through a few pages and set it down in front of Dean. “Recognize anyone?”
“He’s not. Tested him with silver and bronze, but I appreciate you keepin’ an eye out for me.” Dean nodded his head at the booth closest to the pool table and took his cue back from Cas. “Grab a seat, let me win my money back, and then we can head home.”
“That was only meant as a backup plan if you didn’t get into college. You got in!” She shoved the test at him. “You’re trying to fail on purpose.”
"Nothing good about waking up ass-crack of dawn early. You're a freak of nature.* Dean watched the wince on Sam's face. "Sorry. Just need my caffeine."
Sam did not feel lucky. In fact, he felt sick. He leaned over the side of the platform just before his stomach decided to expel everything within it. Blood and bile. That was all he had.
Dean turned his gaze to the whisper’s table. When the boy and girl noticed him, they were shocked into silence. Dean waved, the smile on his face far from friendly. The girl and boy scurried from the dining hall, abandoning their unfinished meals. Dean helped himself to a piece of bread. He left with his head held high, knowing that Sam and Charlie watched him with worried eyes.
Castiel closed the book and set it aside. He stood and searched the shelves at the back of the room. He returned with a burlap sack full of something Dean could not see.
Castiel shook his head then sat straight backed in his chair, every inch the commander. "Go to bed, Dean. Sober up. Meet me at the training grounds at first light tomorrow. Bring your gear."
Pamela sighed. “I just bought these.” She turned to the nearest person and shoved both glasses into his hands. “Okay, let’s go.”
Cas meet Dean’s eyes, his face soft, vulnerable, filled with that one emotion Dean was too afraid to name.
"I guess—" Cas shrugged Dean's arm off his shoulders and rubbed the back of his neck. "I guess that is odd. I feel like I've known you for such a long time but you've only been around me for a little while and—"
Many years passed and more people arrived, all of them old and grey after long and happy lives. One of those years, Sam and Eileen walked through the Roadhouse doors together. Dean was the first to greet them.
Yeah, the Magic Fingers knocked Dean right out after a long hunt, too. Dean took the quarter from Cas's hand then wrestled the comforter out from under his body. Cas huffed and wrinkled his nose, but otherwise stayed asleep as Dean pulled the liberated comforter over his body. He tucked it under Cas's chin then turned off the light.
The Captain crossed his arms and watched Dean for a little longer, face impassive. In a split second, the Captain’s decision was made.
“We have upset you,” Dick said. “It was when we spoke of the humans. Why? They are nothing compared to the likes of you. To us.”
Sam hunched his shoulders. “I don’t know yet.” Charlie and Kevin gave Sam the same incredulous stare. Sam continued, “I
“You know: we’d talk over our issues, debate them, and then make a decision based on a vote.” The king bowed his head, staring at his hands. “I've been wondering if that is something that could be implemented on a larger scale-- maybe to the Realm,”
“Yeah.” Meg rolled her eyes. “Got a lot of experience patching up ungrateful morons who don’t know their limits.” She tipped her head back to see Castiel. “Don’t I, Clarence?”
“Cas.” Dean gripped Castiel’s hair, demanding attention. Dean gasped when Castiel released him with a pop. “Come here.”
But he was Dean’s little brother. He was Dean’s little brother, who could heal a soldier's wound, could research any problem, and could use his knife when he needed it. Dean looked at his little brother-- his little brother who was engaged-- and remembered he was not just his little brother. He was Sam.
“Finish that sentence, Dean, and I am going to say everything I’ve been thinking about you and…” Sam taps his chin, pretending to think about it. “Someone. All of it.
Castiel’s shoulders twitched. He squared his stance, facing Balthazar head on. “I will not allow you to harm Sam.”
After a month, Sam forces Dean out of bed and into the shower. Once that’s done, Sam makes Dean eat a proper meal.
Dean didn't have a body this time. There was nothing left when the Empty swallowed Cas whole. So, once they saved the world— again— Dean returned to the meadow and planted flowers in Cas's honour. It was the best Dean could do. It was the least he could do.
to fix it.” Cas lets go of Dean’s hands, cups the back of Dean’s neck, and presses their foreheads together. “I’ll return to you, I promise.”
The way Balthazar’s eyebrows knit together, along with the genuine concern in his voice, made Castiel sheathe his sword. Balthazar visibly relaxed but did not make any motion to move closer. Castiel turned his back to pick up the shirt he left by the pool. After he shrugged on his shirt, Catiel returned to Balthazar, who had a deep furrow in his brow.
Dean closed his eyes. Castiel lay Dean down gently on to the forest floor. He checked the wound, cursing Dean’s stubbornness one again when he saw the dark blood and purple bruises. Castiel reached out his hand and held it over the wound. He stared down at it for an endless moment. Another curse escaped Castiel’s lips before he pulled his hand away and reached into Dean’s pack. What a great time for Castiel to learn to heal wounds the human way.
There’s an awkward silence where Cas doesn’t answer, the wings don’t move, and Dean stares at his boots. Even Sparky is oddly dim.
No, it was that cross and those eyes. He’d seen the cross before, had held it in his mouth at one time, and he’d wanted to drown himself in those eyes. When he slept, sometimes he still did.
“Well, Cas, I’ve got about fifteen minutes before I’m off the clock here, but if you want to meet me outside,” he jerked his head in the direction of the hall, “I think I might be able to show you a good time.” His eyes briefly skittered the length of Castiel’s body. “If you’re interested, I mean. If you’d rather stay here, not drinking and looking like you’d rather be anywhere else, I’ll respect that too.”
“Sure,” Sam tucked his hair behind his ears, “We planned it. Well, I figured it was a good way to get you out of the house so I could set up for the party. He wanted to wait until he finished the work on it to give it to you, but it wasn’t going to be ready in time, and I could tell he was excited about giving it to you, so I made a suggestion.”
Castiel opened his eyes to find Jack standing across from him, bouncing on the balls of his feet with his hands clasped behind his back. He seemed kind of sweet and Castiel felt bad that he’d had even the slightest feeling of irritation toward him.  A moment later, he noticed the large, tarped object next to him. Castiel looked over his shoulder at Dean, who was grinning ear to ear.
His tone was teasing and light, and Castiel decided immediately that he definitely did want more dates. In absolutely any order. And if not dates, then he still wanted to know him. It was an opportunity he wasn’t willing to let slip away. Gentlemanly or not.
“It’s okay, Sammy.” Dean had apparently pulled himself together enough to make himself known, and he stood very close to Castiel, his hand placed casually at his waist.
Dean lifted his hand to stop him, “Let me finish. For a while after you left I was in and out of your apartment. I kept thinking I’d come in one day, and you’d be there, and of course, you never were. So I’d sit around, and feel sorry for myself, and sometimes Anna would show up.” He ran his hand over the back of his neck, “We kind of became friends, you know? Just because we had you in common, I guess. I thought maybe you’d contact her, and that she’d tell me if you had. She missed you, and… ah, I guess I’m just beating around the bush.” He lifted his hand to Castiel’s face, and stroked his cheek with his thumb. “I imagine we were using each other to remember you,” he parroted.
A sound, which Castiel might have passed off for a laugh, escaped him, and he wondered if this was what Hell would feel like when he made it there. Or maybe this was worse. Maybe this was purgatory, because, at the moment, he wasn’t sure he knew up from down. Flirting was not his strong suit. It wasn’t something that he typically attempted to do, and generally speaking, he wasn’t great at discerning when someone was flirting from when they were being overly friendly. But here he was, fairly certain that if Gabriel had been there, he would have taken it upon himself to inform Castiel that flirting was exactly what had been going on.
“You sure you don’t wanna ride with us?” Gabe asked as they punched out, one right after the other. “We were gonna meet up with Anna and Ingrid at the diner, maybe catch a flick or somethin’. You know Ingrid just got her jacket, so I’m guessin’ they wanna celebrate a little.”
Sam looked through the sketches as they walked, and Castiel refused to look at anything but the ground, which became intensely interesting once he had handed his sketches over to Sam.
The bathtub scene was actually requested for a high school AU that I had written for a friend many many moons ago, but could never really work into the story. I also never finished that fic (RIP), so I decided to put it in here. I like how it turned out. I think I mostly just like writing them being tender with one another.
Castiel pulled him close again, and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. If anyone saw them, he could pass it off as friendly if he had to. “You’re too perfect, Dean Winchester,” he whispered, “I love you so much.”
He smoked while he drove and told himself it was his fee for having to take care of Anna while she was drunk. It wasn’t quite the same as his bike, but there was something nice about driving through the early morning quiet with Anna soundly asleep in the seat next to him. It wasn’t the same level of freedom that he felt when he rode his bike, but it was almost comfortable in a simple sort of way.
Dean let his hand slide along Castiel’s bare torso, his fingers brushing over the bullet scar under his ribs before he pulled away enough to speak, “Lay back,” he instructed.
Dean must have caught the look of terror in his eyes when the lightning struck, because he moved closer to him and smoothed Castiel’s hair from his face, “Shhh, Cas,” gently, he brought him to his chest, “Come here.” He shifted, and situated Castiel’s legs so that they were facing one another, Castiel’s knees up by Dean’s hips. He hugged him, but kept their embrace loose enough that Castiel could easily pull away if he wanted.
So, Chapter title: We Belong Together- Ritchie Valens (1959) I actually had a really difficult time picking a title for this one, but this song just seemed to fit the best when I thought of it.
“Yes, I meant it,” he said as he held him tightly. “Of course, I meant it. I love you. I love you so much, Dean. I’m not- I won’t go anywhere. I promise. I swear.” His words really only seemed to make Dean cry harder, and he rocked him gently as he got it all out. If he had known it was going to be like this, that he was going to cause Dean so much pain, that it would feel so completely divine to be with him, then he never would have left. He would have figured out something better. He would have killed Kit and every one of her cronies if that had been what it took. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I’ll make it up to you, I swear I will. Every minute, I’ll make it all up to you. Sam too.”
“I don’t-” Dean tried and failed to express what all of this felt like to him, how broken open he felt, and how for a little while, Castiel had filled that space, and instead said, “You better not have given me beard burn, you dumbass. The last thing I need is to deal with that on my thighs while I’m trying to work.” Because he couldn’t process everything he was feeling, and he got prickly because he didn’t know how else to deal with it all.
“Didn’t you hear what I just said? Tomorrow,” Dean said firmly. “Unless you plan on staying here forever?” He looked around the room, “I guess it’s kind of homey, in a lonely-drifter sort of way.”
Castiel agreed and ruffled Sam’s hair as he gave him an affectionate shove toward the middle of the lake.
Castiel finally spared a glance in Dean’s direction. His expression was carefully blank, his eyes on the floor, and it broke Castiel’s heart just a little.
When at last the new slaves were bade to bathe and change to prepare for their welcome feast, Castiel finally caught the boy’s eye. It was unnerving, because unlike every other person who had set eyes on him since his birth, there was little change in his expression when he looked at Castiel. It was like he had glanced upon a mildly interesting insect rather than a lonely boy with freakishly colored eyes and knobby knees. Castiel lightly touched Arete in an effort to comfort himself, and she cooed in return. He had never been looked at that way before—a look that neither denoted anxiety or disgust. After a moment, the boy’s expression shuttered again, a return to perfect obstinance as he was led from the room by the hand of one of the women he had come with.
Dean flushed as Castiel made eye contact with him and worked his tongue along his pointer finger. It was also lucky that Castiel knew for a fact that Dean couldn’t think at all when it came to the mere suggestion of anything filthy if he wasn’t the one to suggest it. It was a weakness Castiel seldom exploited—it didn’t often occur to him to do so—but it never failed to amuse him when he did. Dean looked like he was going to melt.
Castiel opened his mouth and Dean placed the Lifesaver carefully on his tongue, which Castiel decided to exploit by closing his mouth around his fingers and sucking.
The voice that echoed Dean’s name through the house was gruff, a bit slurred, and slightly too loud for indoors.
Once he had scrubbed the sweat from his body, he dried himself, and shimmied into his jeans without bothering to do up the front since he hadn’t yet put on his shirt. He made the bed, and had just picked the paper back up when there was another knock at his door. He had never been so popular in his life. He sighed and set the paper back down on the bed. It was probably Harrold, back to insist he take the address for the VA hospital. He went to open the door, remembered he still had his jeans unzipped, and bent his head to remedy the problem as he opened it. “I just stepped out of the shower,” he said apologetically, as he tugged the zipper. “I should apologize for earlier. I didn’t mean to be rude, I’ve just had a rough…” he looked up and nearly blacked right out.
“It matches your eyes,” he’d said, his own eyes downcast and shadowed by his eyelashes. Dean’s voice was soft, weak from disuse, but Castiel had heard his words as clearly as if he had spoken them right next to his ear.
Dean’s tongue slid along his lower lip. “It’s... a surprise. Well, sort of. I mean, I’d just rather show you than tell you.” Dean caught his lip between his teeth and his eyes fell to Castiel’s mouth for the second time in thirty seconds.
“Why do you wanna know, Cas? What difference does it make? It was you I was with last night, you I woke up next to this morning, and you I made breakfast for, so what’s it matter?”
“If you kiss me just like that for the rest of my life, Castiel, I don’t think I’ll ever need to wish for anything else,” he said, the barest hint of a smile on his face.
Dean looks over at him, and though his heart is pounding, and every one of his internal alarm bells is ringing, he doesn’t look away. Up close, he can see the lines in Castiel’s face, the soft light of the lamps illuminating his age—still young, but already many years a man. There’s stubble at his jaw, and Dean wants to run his fingers through that thick, dark hair of his. “Hope,” he says, suddenly, his voice strained. He licks his lips and tries again, “The use of the circus is hope. I figure. Things are terrible for a lot of people right now, but you can make them forget, for just a little while, how bad things are.” Dean can feel the twists in his stomach, the desire and the danger there, and he knows that he should excuse himself and go back home. He should forget he’d ever set eyes on the man next to him. “You can make people remember that it might not be bad forever.” His knuckles are white on his cap, and the poor thing is never going to find its proper shape again.
Castiel sat down at the counter of the diner he had entered, and tried to shake off thoughts of life before Vietnam, and before Philly, by ordering coffee with eggs and toast. He'd just gotten off the train that morning, and riding cooped up in the train car all that time had done him exactly zero favors. He was a little scruffy and probably needed a shower, but he couldn't check into his room until three, and he had time to kill. Not to mention, he was stiff, and low on smokes. He’d picked up smoking again while he’d been overseas, and though he hadn’t touched a cigarette at that point since the god-awful one he’d smoked with Anna before he left town, he saw little point in resisting when practically every soldier he came into contact with smoked anyway. He smoked, and drank half a pot of coffee while he waited for his food. He’d gotten used to a regular diet of cigarettes and shitty coffee while he’d been away, and even when presented with perfectly edible food, he often found that it was easier to go on subsisting that way. He didn’t have to think about it.
Dean shifted a little on the bed and winced again, “Because I didn’t want him worrying over me. And if dad decides he wants to teach me another lesson, I don’t want him around. His friend lives in a nice place, and they’ll look out for him for a couple of days until things cool off. Besides, there’s barely enough room in here for you, let alone the both of us.” Slowly, he shifted again and swung his legs off the side of the bed. “I can stay at the shop until this blows over, and then we’ll go home, and everything’ll be fine. It’s not a big deal.”
Castiel thought he was teasing, but Dean looked genuinely embarrassed for a moment, and he wondered if there was any truth at all to Sam’s words.
The image of him in the sun the day they had gone swimming had fixed itself in his mind almost as soon as it had registered, and that was where he started. He drew everything he could remember about him, from the strong line of his jaw, to his delicate nose and lashes, to the freckles that had stood out on his face when the sun had fallen on him. To Castiel, he had appeared as one of those half-gods his teachers had gone on about in history, flawed and yet, endlessly beautiful. He softened a line in Dean’s neck with his thumb, and his already elevated heart rate spiked instantly when his head snapped up at the sound of a sudden knock at the door.
“You were fantastic,” he says in a rush. He can feel the flush in his face as he tries to avoid allowing his eyes to linger anywhere too long, but instead just ends up being pinned by that too-blue gaze.
He wasn’t, however, used to being pressed between Dean and Sam Winchester in a truck cab with the only noise being the wind rushing through the open windows and Sam’s questions.
It was wordless and intense, Dean’s fingers interlaced his as they moved against one another, his kisses swallowing any of the incomprehensible noises Castiel happened to make. He never felt as close to anyone as he did when Dean was like this with him, and he half believed that he’d never have to speak again because after this they’d be psychically linked, their minds melding together as their bodies had. Anything less than that seemed impossible.
“I just wondered how Sam convinced you to come here with him. Obviously, he didn’t tell you it was me he’d found.”
John looked him up and down, took another drink, and crossed his arms over his chest as he leaned against the counter, “You look like a delinquent. How do you know Dean?” he switched his attention back to Dean, “You had better stay out of trouble, you hear me?”
Dean’s brows lifted, and a slow smile started on his features as he shifted closer to him. “Are you a Brando fan?” he asked. His arms came up to drape around Castiel’s shoulders. “Did you see him in
“It’s not changing the subject. Do you regret it? If you’re asking something like that, doesn’t it make sense that you might have those thoughts yourself? You asked me if I wanted you, and I tried to give you an out. All you had to do was say the word, and I would have stopped.”
They had only been together again for about six months, but the fact that he got to share a bed with Dean without having to worry about who might find them, or the fact that Dean would eventually have to leave, was easily one of his favorite things about this new version of their relationship. He generally slept poorly, and so oftentimes, he could spend great stretches of time just getting to watch Dean sleep before either of them had  to be up for any reason. Some mornings, he was certain it was the most beautiful sight in the world.
“When we were younger, me and Sammy would eat on the living room floor or in one of our bedrooms on days we were on our own. If dad was gone, or Bobby had an early job or something. My mom would do it with us sometimes, after my dad shipped out, so I guess that’s why I kept up after… well,” he shrugged and gave Castiel a quick smile as he sat down.  “It’s just a way to make things kind of silly, I guess. We didn’t usually use the coffee table, but I thought I’d try and class it up for you a little.”
Dean looked like he wanted to say something, to continue his thought, or come up with a reason they should sit and talk about whatever it was that had just happened between them, but Castiel grabbed his cigarettes and was gone before he had the chance.
, but it seemed that most of the women called him by a diminutive—Dean—and Castiel felt it suited him more thoroughly. When he finally approached him after their evening meal, where he sat, almost sullen, next to a particularly lovely slave girl that Castiel had noticed one of his older brothers eyeing, he called him by name to get his attention. “I am Castiel,” he told him. Introducing himself seemed the right move. Important, since he didn’t think anyone else had bothered when they tried to deal with him. “Would you like to see a trick?” he’d asked carefully, his shoulders squared. He had spent the entire day prior coming up with a ruse to speak to him, and he’d kept his dice bag at his hip all day just in case the opportunity presented itself before he was ready. He hoped they could play after he had shown him his trick. Maybe he’d be curious enough to want to learn how it was done. His older brothers always wanted to know how things were done when they were shown something they didn’t immediately understand, though they were more inclined to beat and break things to get their answers. Castiel hoped that Dean did not share this inclination, as he had no desire to be hit or shouted at.
And because Sam trusted him, he did exactly that. Just flopped over and fell right back asleep. And Dean shoved all of his things under his bed, and cried himself to sleep that night. Because it was all too much, his heart was breaking, and he wanted, desperately, to be on a bus to anywhere but there with a blue-eyed boy’s arms around him. But he could never have really left Sam behind. Not really. Not like that.
“It is you!” A tall young man—taller than Castiel by at least four inches-—with long, almost shoulder-length hair that flipped out around his face, and broad shoulders approached him. Almost before Castiel knew what was going on, he had thrown his arms around him. “I don’t believe it! This is crazy!”
Castiel sighed, “I just wanted to let you know I wouldn’t be there tonight. It doesn’t have to be a fight every time I choose to go out with Dean.”
He felt Dean pull his mouth off of him after a few moments, “Look at me.” His breath was still hot against Castiel’s groin, but he wiped his eyes and did as Dean asked. “Are you all right?”
"He propositioned me not long after we met.” It was best to be straightforward about it. It wasn’t his proudest moment, but he thought he could hardly be faulted for wanting to feel something between all of his pining for Dean, and his exhaustion from trying to do a job he was never meant to be doing. "I'll spare you the details, but I didn't say no."
was the word that came to mind when he considered that she wasn’t with Dean now. She had apparently followed her father’s wishes. He wasn’t sure he would have done any differently—it wasn’t like wanting to be with a man was far off from wanting to be with someone who wasn’t your race, and if he’d had a father to tell him off, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to disobey—though having Dean in front of him now made him wonder. At the club, it didn’t matter as much, everyone was welcome given all of them were criminals in the eyes of the law, but he had seen conflicts arise because of that type of narrow mindedness.
Castiel wiped at his eyes and lay back against the chimney. The amused sparkle in his eyes remained when he held the bottle out to Dean. “Clearly, I do not need more of this.”
Sam waits by Baby. He watches Dean, his face sympathetic. Dean doesn’t want sympathy. Dean wants Cas.
So, maybe it wasn't a surprise. It still was a shock. The realization hit Dean like a tonne of bricks saying: "Guess what, Dean? You're in love with your best friend! You always have been and now you're realizing it by staring at his face while he sleeps because that's not creepy at all." Because bricks could talk. Hey, Dean had seen weirder.
"You are not the only ones who have been alive for a long time." Lenore did not break eye contact with Castiel. "And you are not the only one tired of all this."
The late king ordered John Winchester's discharge after he heard the story. The queen was struck with a grief so great when she heard the news she was sick for months. That moment solidified the rumour about young Adam's parentage among the nobility.
“Well, it makes sense,” Charlie said. “You trained, like, all of the army and, y’know, you can be charismatic when you want to.”
Sam reached into his pocket. He had been carrying an important item around every day now, just in case. Now he knew he did not have a lot of time to wait. He left his seat and knelt in front of Jessica.
“You okay? You smell like a tavern.” Charlie sniffed as Dean pushed his way past her. She wrinkled her nose. “And guy.”
Dean scurried up the cliff to join his brother. The portal sputtered, disappearing for a heart-stopping second before it appeared again. Dean did not care. He stared down the cliff, stared down as he saw Castiel reach the Leviathan army.
The healer’s camp expanded beyond the forest and into the beach. Healers walked up and down the lines of injured, making the most of their dwindling supplies. Rescue parties, led by Aaron and his troops, were sent out every day. Most of the time they returned with heavy hearts and little else. Sometimes, however, they found a survivor and that made the effort worth it.
“He’s the reason we made it this far. He sent us here to find you.” Castiel shifted his attention to the Mother. “And Lenore wanted me to find you.”
Castiel answered the Captain's call right away, even at such an early hour. The Captain opened the door to his office as soon as Castiel arrived. Castiel did not need to knock.
Every time Dean stopped by Castiel’s table, he checked in. Every time, Castiel seemed more than happy to listen to yet another villager's tale. Every time, the villagers were delighted to have a new audience for their old stories.
Dean, once again, grabbed the dirty dishes and added them to the pile. He stood with his hands on his hips and shook his head at the stacks upon stacks of dishes. Now, this right here was true despair. He should get a dishwasher.
Charlie, beer in one hand and Jo’s hair twisted around the fingers of the other, nodded from her place at the bar. Leaning over the bartop so she could be in Charlie's space, Jo winked when she saw Dean's questioning stare. Kevin sat at the corner table, eyes flitting from person to person, waiting for something, someone. Pamela’s distinctive laugh sounded from the dark backrooms, though Dean couldn’t see her. Ellen weaved expertly between the tables, dropping a drink at Bobby and Rufus’s table, shooting a stern glare in Charlie’s direction, and shouting at Ash as she made her way toward Dean and Cas.
“According to Kevin,” Sam answered, “his connection to Metatron is gone. Maybe he just wasn’t able to hear it.”
The woman shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m just the clerk.” She grabbed a key off the wall behind her and held it out to Castiel. “Now I can finally close up shop.”
“Oh c’mon. I was a kid.” Dean sauntered up to the bar, grinning when he saw Castiel. He took a seat next to Ellen. “Look at you, Cas. You a bartender now?”
Dean landed on the hard floor of the sea cave, his hip taking the brunt of the impact. He ignored the pain because he made it. Dean was back in Realm and he had Castiel beside him. With his arms still wrapped around Castiel, Dean scrambled into a seated position. He looked at Castiel then-- looked at his beard, the black ooze marking his skin, and his alert blue eyes-- and brought him in for another hug. Dean laughed, a happy sound of utter relief.
Castiel did not break his stare. Ellen squirmed under the scrutiny. Castiel scratched his beard then asked, “When did you first notice this?”
Sparky is on Cas’s shoulder. Dean can’t speak, not without calling attention to himself too soon. He yells Sparky’s name in his head, hoping like hell that it works.
At that moment, holding Castiel close while heedless of Meg and Balthazar’s stares, Dean almost believed he would be well.
Captain Singer’s office was small and well-used. Two chairs, separated by a desk covered in maps and handwritten reports, took up most of the space in the room. The top shelf behind the Captain's chair was filled with many different liquor bottles, in varying stages of mostly empty, and the rest with scrolls, books, and bits of old fighting equipment. The handmade rug at Dean’s feet had seen better days, with its many stains and frayed edges. Everyone knew not to touch that rug. It was the last thing made by Captain Singer’s wife.
Cas didn't change expression, didn't move at all, but Dean could feel the distance growing between them. The further Cas drifted away, the more Dean regretted the question.
The whole time, Dean had not worried about Castiel. He figured, out of everyone in the Capital, Castiel could take care of himself. Seeing the most capable fighter he knew brought down by a single blast brought him back to reality. He brought all these people-- his friends-- into the middle of a battlefield, on his personal, selfish task. When Balthazar faced Dean, he knew he was looking at a being of power.
The souls writhed within Castiel. They whispered their impatience, weary of all the waiting. Castiel reminded them of who brought them into being, who saved them from the prison known as Purgatory. He could keep the souls under control. The lesions on His vessel— hidden under his clothes— were just a test.
The sticky late fall snow clung to Dean’s boots as they walked. Jessica flashed a polite smile each time Dean glanced her way. She did not seem offended when Dean failed to continue the conversation.
The flap of Metatron’s wings pushed a current of wind through the throne room. The pages Metatron left on the throne flew away one by one, swirling all around the room. Castiel boots slid across the floor at the force of it. He shielded his face with his arms and planted his feet, leaning into the wind to stay upright. When the wind stilled, the pages dropped onto the floor among the crumpled up papers, forgotten and useless. Castiel saw the Metatron standing in front of the throne.
"Indeed I am," Cas said, eyes focused on the horizon, "because you need to rest. I knew you wouldn't relinquish control until you were too exhausted for full cognitive thought."
For one in his life, Sam was grateful for his small stature. He crouched low, circling behind Azazel, with Ruby’s knife in hand. He held his breath, placing his feet as carefully and silently as possible. Sneaking into the library’s restricted section for months taught him how to go unnoticed while being in plain sight. By the time Azazel felt Sam’s presence, it was too late.
“Yes, sir,” Dean said. That should have been the end of the conversation, but Dean paused and chose not to leave. “You have reports about me?”
Castiel ran his thumb across Dean’s cheek. It was like the room around Castiel faded away. All he saw was Dean.
After that, Sam’s free nights were no longer spent in the library. He walked through the gardens with Jessica. He read her stories while she worked. He brought her flowers he picked from the garden, up until he was caught by the groundskeeper. Sam and Jessica spent all their spare moments together. There was no time for him to continue his perusal of the book. But the book was still there, waiting in the back of Sam’s mind, waiting for him to be ready.
He knelt, touching the dry grass at the edge of the dead soil. Nothing grew in a square patch, the shape of it filled with soot and unchanged since the day the Winchester’s house burned.
“Nightmare,” Cas said, his voice muffled by Dean’s shirt. “Usually I can tell the difference but--” Cas squeezed Dean tighter.
The glass looked expensive, the bottle even more so. Castiel glanced up at the thump on the counter.
“You totally are.” Meg leaned forward, one eyebrow arched. “You’re especially puppy eyed around that human of yours. I mean, he’s not bad to look at but I know that doesn’t matter to you.”
“Cas,” Sam began. He waited for a hum of acknowledgment before continuing. “What you did. That-- It--”
The room was so quiet, the night so deep and silent, that the soft question shocked Castiel out of near-sleep. Castiel did not know he could sleep. Another sign of what happens when a Celestial lives among the humans.
Castiel eyed the knife Sam clutched close to his chest. Its jagged edges were hard to forget. “Where did you find that?”
“You will save us. Those like me.” Ruby raised her arms. Her eyes turned black. “By ending the humans.”
“It’s something Dean said when I asked why Sam and Jessica are in such a rush to bond after only a few months.”
Similarly subdued, Sam perched on the edge of the bed. After the announcement, he spent the rest of the day fielding an endless stream of new volunteers. The people were inspired. Young and old, trained and untrained, the citizens of the Capital wanted to help. By the time night fell, Sam was still trying to find places for everyone. He only stopped because Ash ordered him to rest. For once in his life, Sam did not argue.
Sparky leaps off Dean’s shoulder. Once it is halfway between Dean and Cas, it sends a shower of sparks down between them in a shining rainbow of colour. They fall through the air between Dean and Cas like shooting stars. The show ends when Sparky lands on Cas’s head.
Jim left Dean to his training, and Dean raised his bow once again. He pulled the string taut, took a deep stabilizing breath, eyed the target, and let fly. The arrow flew directly into a tree. Dean lowered his arms and stood there. He wanted to blame the bow, blame the arrow, blame the low light or blame the target itself but he knew that the only thing that could be blamed for his failures was Dean himself.
Dean did not look convinced. He was about to speak when Sam stood, a large stack of papers in his hands.
They had not talked about it-- about what Castiel said before being dragged away by the Empty-- and that was okay. Castiel never expected an answer from Dean. Castiel was content just existing in the same space as the man he loved. He really, truly, did not expect more. Sometimes though, when Dean’s hands lingered a little longer than before, when Dean’s smiles became wider and happier, when Dean’s eyes shone with hidden emotions, Castiel could not help but wonder what it meant. He dared not assume but he wondered.
Castiel did not know what Dean was thinking, only that he appeared tired and despondent, a far cry from the strange, easy-going human he spoke to last night. Then again, Castiel did not appear much better, with his shadowed eyes and pounding head.
They never had peace like this before but now, however, they had so many days like this ahead of them. Dean could scarcely believe it.
“If I said no, would that stop you?” Dean grinned up at Ellen. It wavered when he saw her serious expression. “What?”
No warning— not a shout, not a howl— came before something large with claws slammed into Dean's chest and knocked him into the dirt. The shotgun flew out of Dean’s hand. He lost grip on his flashlight. The monster snarled and hot spittle dripped onto Dean’s face.
Castiel shrugged and turned around, heading for the pile on the bathroom counter. He wiped away the steam on the mirror, then heard Dean gasp.
Cas covers Dean’s hands with his own before Dean can back away. “I wanted to hear you say that for so long. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I want to. I can’t.”
“Who are you?” Sam tried to sound bold and confident like the heroes he read about in books but, in reality, he was only a scared boy.
Using the table behind him to stabilize himself, Dean finally managed to look Castiel in the face. What he saw there was painful.
Sam stared into the dark pits that were Ruby’s eyes. Sam held her gaze and let her think she triumphed. She lowered her arm and leaned over Sam’s face. She moved closer and closer and Sam waited, waited until she was a breath away.
“You have a whole life ahead of you,” Castiel said. “You could find someone, raise a family with them, grow old with them.”
“Yeah. I don't care about the Angel stuff, not really, but it does mean he’s got enough problems and he's gonna get a bunch more soon." Dean turned his back to Ellen and rubbed his neck. “Cas doesn't need to add this to the list. It's not like he could--” He swallowed and dropped his hands to his sides. He twisted his body to look at Ellen. “Is it supposed to hurt this much?”
It was a fair question, one Dean was unsure he could answer. Charlie had not met him before his knighthood, before his trip to Hell, before he lost Castiel, and even she could tell he was failing to cope. Charlie did not push Dean to answer. She took his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze before she rolled over.
Before Charlie could speak, a new plate clattered against the table. Dean slipped into the seat opposite Sam. Sam jumped back from Charlie. In his haste, he slid off the bench. Dean’s blank expression never wavered as he watched Sam struggle back into his seat.
“Good for you,” Dean says without an ounce of enthusiasm. Something like that should make Dean happy. “Who’d you marry?”
"I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable, so I responded in the same way. Sweet peas are used to express gratitude." Cas inclined his head. "Thank you for saving me."
“Well, I could do that,” Jessica said, “but I think we have something more important to talk about.”
Castiel’s response came calm and even, “The people needed someone to rally behind. They will follow you.”
“There is one more topic I wish to discuss,” the king said. “Sam, would you like to hold your ceremony here?”
Benny never asked a lot of questions and neither did Castiel. Somehow, they managed to understand each other more than most. Perhaps they saw themselves in each other, recognizing that, in a vast land full of people, they were the only ones of their type. Both of them were alone in this city.
Once a year, every year, the Capital called for young men, women, and those in between from all across the Realm. The army wanted and needed the best and brightest. The most powerful and promising recruits could work their way up the ranks to earn a knighthood and nobility. All they had to do was survive their first years as a footsoldier in the Long War.
Dean climbed into Castiel's lap and left kisses on his forehead, the corners of his eyes, his lips. Dean did it to feel Castiel's warmth, his strength, his heart. Dean released a contented sigh when they wrapped their arms around each other. They fit into each other perfectly.
“That guy you were with tonight?” Charlie patted his arm. “Did he do anything to help? Has any of it helped lately?”
Dean knew he earned that glare. Had anyone else said something like that to Castiel, there would have been a lot more anger behind those eyes.
hand Kevin here over to the king but I don’t wanna do that. He claims he has information for me but I have to help him. I’m not the commander but I’m--”
"Does it matter? There are no titles here." Pamela looked up at Castiel, holding his gaze longer than most. "Or so I've been told."
Sam shrugged and sipped his coffee. Okay, yeah, Dean could be reading into things but that gesture was a little too casual.
Dean had not given the prophecy any more than a courtesy skim. Any time he tried to do more, his head felt like it would split open. He figured he would leave that work to Sam. He had no idea what Castiel referred to.
Regaining his balance, Dean turned just in time for Castiel to close the distance between them. Dean barely had time to raise his sword to block Castiel’s blow.
“You will?” Dick stepped forward, his teeth shining. “You are Celestial, the All-Father’s second choice. We are Leviathan. We are the first.”
The throne room rumbled. The walls shook. The ripped papers danced across the floor. Castiel did not move. He could not see. He could not think. To him, nothing mattered.
Dean waited for five whole, long seconds then knocked again. "I'm coming in." Dean turned the handle. "Like it or not."
Pure desperation and adrenaline carried Sam into the fray and pushed him past the front lines. He cut his way through the battlefield, dodging Celestial strikes and following his allies' hand signals. Benny’s group joined the battle, focusing their attack to try and provide a means of escape for the army. Sam paid it no mind. He needed to reach the Captain.
For a while, Castiel did not move. He watched Dean, his face slowly morphing from his usual carefully blank look to something more open and-- to Dean's surprise-- vulnerable. Castiel backed away from Dean and turned around, playing with the hair at the nape of his neck.
The mountain stronghold. Dean learned about it in a lesson. In fact, the books on Castiel’s desk talked about it. He stepped into the room and set the book about Celestials on the chair. He grabbed the topmost book from the closest stack on the desk and leafed through it, hoping to find the answer.
Castiel blinked and he was sitting on the cold, hard floor of the warehouse when it all began. He could not remember leaving Bobby's couch. The blood sigil which opened the door to Purgatory lay upon the wall, dried to the colour of rust. Castiel leaned against the table holding all the components to the spell: a jar of blood, a knife, the words of a spell written upon a scroll. The familiar voices of Sam and Bobby bounced around behind Castiel. He could not process the words.
it out." Cas winked at Dean. "A honey dipper, which is also what our shop is named after, is one of these." He pulled a glass honey dipper out of his pocket and showed it to Krissy and Kevin.
Dean shivered at the contact, then shivered harder when Cas pulled away and followed the team off the roof. He looked up at the sky and shook his head. “I’m not even supposed to be here today!”
“How do you think? Sam was worried sick about you. He told Jody, and I overheard.” Claire stared at him. “You didn’t deny it either.”
"All yours, Sir," Dean responded as Cas lined his cock up with Dean's hole. "Fuck, yes, please. Please?"
“I know.” Cas sped up his ministrations, hoping to bring Dean over the edge. “I don’t want you to hold back, Dean. Please. Come for me. Show me what I already know.” He pressed his lips against Dean’s, kissing him fiercely.
Castiel took a final drag from his cigarette, and then put it out on the bottom of his boot. He glanced across to the garage one more time, and noticed that Dean had turned the sign on the door from ‘OPEN’ to ‘CLOSED’ and was on his way out.
“I wanted to, but you beat me to it,” he responded, in reference to their night out the week before. He couldn’t make himself look at Dean head-on again, could hardly believe he had managed the comeback at all (was it even a good response?), but he heard that huff of air, almost like a sigh, that meant he had made Dean laugh again. It was a small mercy that Sam seemed so engrossed in his book that he had missed the entire exchange, because Castiel spent the rest of the trip with his hands pressed between his thighs, every nerve in his body bright and alive, sparking every time he even so much as brushed against Dean.
“I was looking for a job,” Sam said softly, his eyes on his knees. “That day those guys were giving me a hard time. That’s why I left school without waiting for Dean to pick me up.”
"We already spoke with Bobby. He agrees that you never do anything for yourself, so his birthday present is to let you leave early and still get your pay for those lessons." Eileen sat back and smiled smugly at Dean. "Do you honestly think we'd let you have an excuse not to do this?"
He shook his head. “She was coming here to meet me… I don’t know why she had… Why she did that….” Dean drew the phrases out, trying to connect the dots in his head as to why Cassie would fuck some random guy in the bathroom.
“Stop the sassin’. Your momma would be rollin’ in her grave right now if she heard the way you were speakin’.” Missouri leaned forward on her desk. “Hell, if she knew that you were turnin’ this down, she’d roll again.”
Cas raised his eyebrow and smirked. "And it had nothing to do with the idea that you weren't out of the closet yet?"
Dean spit out the water he had started to sip before staring at Garth in surprise. "I'm sorry. What did you just say?"
"That's not a bad thing, Dean." Cas laughed, the deep, throaty rumble causing Dean's belly to ignite. "It just so happens that we make glass sex toys here. Ace my class, and I'll be more than happy to make a
Lisa blushed before rushing her response. “It’s a cumplay thing. After coming, you kiss and push it into the mouth of the person who came. Alistair likes that, so Andrea gave him the nickname Snowball.”
“What? Why?” Dean watched in confusion as Cas turned around and headed to the front of the shop. “Cas?”
Dean would never admit how attractive he found Cas during a fight. One, because he would never hear the end of it from Sam; and two, he knew that his feelings towards the fallen angel were unrequited.
“Owns the Roadhouse. I’m well aware by this point, Dean.” Cas looked at his watch. “I guess it is getting kinda late.” He pulled out his cellphone and messed around on it for a couple of moments. “Alright. Just had to let my mom know I wasn’t going to be home in time for dinner. She’s not happy, but she’ll get over it.”
“DAD?” Dean’s jaw dropped in disbelief. “You ignored my call but answered a stranger’s? What the flying fuck?”
“Thank you, Regan of Mag Mell.” Kaia’s voice snapped him back to attention. “I promise we’ll find a way to get you home.”
Frank nodded. “Absolutely. The job ended up getting picked up by one of my competitors. Now, I don’t like seeing anything bad happening to anyone, but shortly after the job started? The Mathers family put a hit on Roman. Roman wasn’t there, but my competition was. He ended up in the crossfire and was shot and killed. They hadn’t even got the framing up for the addition.”
Dean swallowed as he thought over the day. While he wasn’t sure that Cas was trying to make a move, every little thing Cas did— even when they were fighting —was in Dean’s best interest. As Charlie had even pointed out, Cas had brought him lasagna. But there was no way that Cas knew that Dean was going to be in. Which meant that Cas had sacrificed his own lunch, knowing how much Dean loved his lasagna.
"I can read what's on my phone, Sam." Dean slides his phone up and down the screen. "Maintaining what we have is hard for him."
“Okay, okay. So even with all of these so-called ‘independent contractors’ working on the Death Star, it still needed to be destroyed, right?”
“Flatterer. You’re going to get me without pretty words.” Desiree placed her hand on Cas’ and continued pushing him backward. “You look absolutely delectable.” She leaned in for a kiss, only for Cas to deny her. “Fair enough. But I promise you that I kiss just as well as I suck.”
Charlie had left him a while ago when the girl she had crushed on back in high school - Gilda if he remembered correctly - arrived. The two had been hitting it off when he lost track of her. And the only reason that had happened at all was that he kept watching the gym entrance. Thirty minutes in, and there was still no sign of Cas. Maybe he had just donated and not actually bought a ticket.
Sam sat back on his own bed and watched as his best friend and brother fuss over each other. How neither of them realized the other was in love with them completely blew Sam’s mind. He rolled his eyes before clearing his throat. With their attention captured, Sam threw out a suggestion. “Can you two compromise? Small healing sessions from Cas, then both of you rest together? That way, if you get bad, Dean, Cas will be right there with you.”
"And it has nothing to do with Cas leaving this morning?" Sam turned on the blender to keep Dean from answering. He pulsed it several times, stopping long enough for Dean to start to answer before turning it back on again. "Sorry about that. Just needed to make sure this is all mixed." He grabbed a cup and poured the puke green mixture into it before taking a sip. "So, Cas left this morning?"
“Can’t wear you out yet.” Cas reached down between them and used a bit of grace to help prep and lube Dean. “I don’t think one round is going to sate me.”
Charlie’s laughter turned into a full-blown cackle. “Oh my God, and Ellen had to have thought it was a date. The only people you ever went to the Roadhouse with were me and Sam! She must have been thrilled that you brought someone new!”
So good, in fact, that it took Castiel much longer than it should have to realize that he had just hustled the guys they had been up against. It was the last thing he had expected from Dean, who seemed straightforward and, as far as he could tell, honest. And it made him want him that much more. Because if Dean could do that, could play the long game and pretend that he was average with him long enough to get the attention of those other guys, before eventually taking them for all they were worth, then there was more to him than Castiel had initially thought. Instead of wanting to distance himself like he had earlier, he wanted to know more. He wanted to know everything.
Castiel looked down at the ball he had been passing between his hands. He ran his thumb along one of the seams and shook his head. “Not really. You play on your school’s team or something?”
