Catching sight of him behind the glass, John grinned at him and started making his way across the room, dodging scientists and lab tables as he went. He had just covered about half the distance when one of the lab assistants, immersed in reading a report as he walked, completely neglected to watch where he was going and ran straight into John.
about it."
Against all the expectations set by crime shows on the telly, clandestinely researching someone without good reason is not actually easy. Or, strictly speaking, legal.
"I'm not cold this time," Sherlock informed him calmly, but didn't protest as John shuffled up a bit until he could rest his chin on Sherlock's abdomen.
John shook his head. "It's not good, either. I want you to be happy, Sherlock."
He gave her a look of utter disbelief, then shrugged. "You can certainly try. Do let me know when you have, so I'll know not to waste any mental energy on it."
"Do you know, I think I'm starting to understand that," he murmured, reaching out and grasping Sherlock's hand. "Though you've been doing your best to keep me in the dark."
"Cold?" John asked, apparently having picked up on it.
*****
*****
"Jessie," Emily called. "It's your choice."
He dashed up the stairs and got a towel, knowing both John and Mrs Hudson would have a lot to say about water droplets leading through the entire house.
"John" he finally got out and John made a noise that was truly indescribable before lunging for him.
*****
"Oh, that might have been me," Patrick Wiltshire said, ambling over to join them. "I went out for a smoke last night. Didn't mean to scare anyone."
"Ah. Of course." John rolled his eyes at himself and took a sip of his tea, almost scalding his tongue in the process. "Bloody hell, that's hot."
"Hello John," Molly greeted him. "How are you?"
"I'm afraid so. And it'll allow me to pick up the cheque, too,” John mused, suddenly recalling why he had agreed to accompany Sherlock on this case at all.
John sighed. "Yeah, I suppose that's fair. I really could have handled that better. But how was I supposed to know? He never once so much as suggested..." He broke off and shook his head. "Listen, when we met, he told me he was married to his work. So I left it at that and it was fine. He never indicated he felt ... anything, really. I knew he liked me and I knew I was important to him. We were friends, so that was sort of a given. I never thought to question it further. And then he died and that was ... well, you remember."
Sherlock frowned at her. "No, don't be silly. Johnny here is three years old, which means they got him a full two years before John and I met. Don't be preposterous." Turning toward Lestrade, he continued: "Can we get to work now or is me having a dog more important than another one of London's many inhabitants turning up dead?"
When he had finally coaxed the last of John’s shoulder muscles into submission, his hands were aching and John was swaying where he sat, his eyes closed and head drooping forward.
Swallowing back bile, John pressed his palm to Sherlock's back, slowly following the lines of the angry scars.
"Seriously, John, what-" Sherlock started, then trailed off, finally catching on. "John, are you
"I might be persuaded to be lenient if I get some form of insurance on your part that you will return. A token, if you will."
Sherlock nodded. "Yes. We have some other engagements today. Have a good day."
want, well ... you don't mess about."
*****
There was a second of confusion as the two robbers paused to look around for the source of the sound. A moment later, they got their answer when John lunged at them.
“You’ve been in love with him almost from the moment he first walked through that door,” she said, gesturing behind herself. “I may not have wanted to see it back then, but deep down I always knew. And now instead of getting married and being gone, he’s back at 221b and sleeping in your bed. You can’t claim that doesn’t affect you in some way.”
John tears his gaze away and resolutely turns back to the supplies Sherlock brought. There is enough to outfit a small clinic. With all the wipes Sherlock bought, John thinks he could literally wrap Rosie in cotton. If only that were enough to keep her safe and sound.
This was helped by the soreness of his muscles and the pleasant ache every time he shifted in his chair. It really had been a long time but he remembered this feeling and even his exceptional brain couldn't have made it up, so it must be real.
?" John didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the mental image.
He felt their gazes on him as he followed Sherlock to Lestrade's office and made a determined attempt to avoid them.
He stopped himself and shook his head, biting back the words he knew John wouldn't want to hear.
"Don't look at me," she said, raising her hands defensively. "I'm the last person who'll get in your way if you want to arrest people for littering. Have fun convincing the lawmakers to make it a capital offence, though."
Lestrade looked up. "You know her?"
He shook the thought off; it wasn't really relevant right now. Perhaps later there would be an opportunity to further examine this phenomenon, but right now he had a double murder to solve and a Detective Inspector to pester for more data.
"Yes," John echoed, hearing a bit of his tightly controlled anger creep into his voice. "
"Yes, but why?"
He barely listened to their explanation of what they were intending to do, too focused on trying to keep his breathing and heart rate at normal levels.
It was noon when he managed to shuffle outside under his own stream. John had a shift at the clinic and so he was alone when he climbed into the car Mycroft had sent. He slumped into the seat as the driver closed the door behind him, put his seatbelt on and dozed through the entire drive back to Baker Street, where the driver had to shake his shoulder to rouse him.
John gave a strangled laugh. "Guess we're both idiots, then. Could have had this ages ago."
John snorted. "I thought you were dead, Sherlock. Excuse me for not expecting you to show up in a fancy restaurant with a drawn-on mustache and a terrible French accent."
"Barely 9:30," she tells him. "You're a couple of terrible lightweights."
Sherlock relaxed. "Of course."
"What?"
"So you left the large, cold PsyNet for a small, emotional network made up of changeling minds," Sherlock observed. "And that was enough."
He turned and left, leaving John alone in the sitting room of 221b with lots of plans for his wedding and no best man to attend it.
Mrs Hudson thought about that for a moment and then smiled. “Overwhelmed, I suppose.”
Sherlock only waited long enough for Patrick to close the front door behind himself before stepping closer. "Well played, I don't think he realised what was really going on here. Did you find anything at the door?"
He was well aware of the desperation that had seeped into his voice towards the end of his little speech and could only hope that John wouldn't pick up on it or, if he did, that he would attribute it to the wrong reasons.
"Sherlock ..." John swallowed audibly. "You don't ... you don't really think that's what I think, do you?"
"I don't think he knows how barking works," the scientist chimed in. "The vocal cords would have been completely restructured, it will take some time to adjust to all the changes. I'm afraid this includes his senses and ability to move."
Maybe he should try to figure out why he keeps kissing Sherlock.
This prompted the others to share their holiday memories before the conversation turned back to the present.
“I know,” Sherlock murmured. “I’m sorry, John.”
After all, if he knew all about John's sex life with his girlfriends just from looking at him, then surely it was only fair that John would know this one thing about Sherlock himself, wasn't it?
Mycroft nodded at him. "And you, brother mine. I suggest you do something about your little problem, and soon. The tension in here is thick enough to choke on and I'm sure I do not wish to know what John's poor sensitive nose has to endure right now."
would not be. Even John in all his obliviousness was likely to notice if Sherlock developed an unwelcome erection at precisely the worst possible moment.
John had merely smiled fondly, too preoccupied with Sherlock's reasons for coming here.
Sherlock huffed but bent his mind back to the task.
And then he leans forward and kisses him.
John closed his eyes for a moment. "It shouldn't be like that. Your back looks like ..." He broke off, unable to even put it into words.
John forgot to breathe. He couldn't even think over the roaring in his ears as his horror mounted.
As it was, he was wondering with no little alarm if dogs ever got hard and if so, how much it took for that to happen. He rather hoped he would not have cause to find out.
Sherlock snorted. “I was paranoid about how you would react,” he admitted. “It wasn’t really a question of self-restraint but of self-doubt.”
John tried to think through his panic, through the roaring in his head as his cat, already several steps ahead of him in terms of planning his next move, yearned to tear the heads off anyone involved in this.
"Thank you for letting me do this," she says, watching Sherlock and John who are standing down the hallway, heads bent together as they talk in quiet voices. There's a tentative smile on John's face. He looks like someone who just woke up from a nightmare to find that reality is actually quite nice.
Then again, Sally can't even remember what 'normal' is supposed to look like. There was either the absurd normality of Holmes being present or the even more absurd normality of Holmes being dead.
He shifted his weight, a movement that could hardly escape John's notice this close to his legs, and John realized that the topic made his friend uncomfortable. Right. Moving on.
"All right, all right, but only because there is nothing left to do," Sherlock grumbled. "Always so bossy."
Less than ten seconds and he was already missing John so fiercely he thought it might burn a hole right through his chest, through his shirt, through his coat.
*****
Sherlock lay in his bed and stared at the ceiling, barely seeing it. He had no idea if he had slept or not and couldn't remember the last time he had been certain about the answer.
Four days after the final rehearsal, John had reached a new pinacle of jitteriness and had a hard time sitting still in his armchair in the sitting room of 221b. He was making an effort, though, because Sherlock looked ready to knock him out with a stack of wedding magazines.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, feeling the corner of his mouth curl up in a bitter smile. "Can't I? Tell me, John: if you didn't need this signature, if you hadn't found out about our marriage, would you have ever come here again?"
But even as he thought it, even as he tried to come up with more and more reasons to convince himself that this was the best course of action, he could feel the words in his chest, in his throat, choking him, piling up on his tongue.
But mostly it was just Sherlock.
"I think neither does Johnny," Lestrade added, grinning.
"Am I what?"
A moment later, his words confirmed it. "That's cruel, Mycroft. Even for you."
"Confiding in me."
John hummed and pressed another fierce kiss to Sherlock's shoulder, as if trying to brand him with his mouth. It felt like an apology and a promise all in one.
He closed his eyes and dove into his mind, finding the cracks in his conditioning and fixing them as best he could. With every tear he repaired, the dissonance faded a little. He kept going until it was gone, then re-examined his psychic shields protecting him from others in the Net. They were all unblemished. To everyone else on the Net, his mind shone with the icy sheen of perfect Silence - just as it should.
Sherlock pushed the key into the lock and twisted, shoving the door open with his arm and allowing John to precede him into the room.
Just then, his phone chimed with a text message. "There is a car waiting for us outside," he said. "My brother is surprisingly fast at times. Probably had a bloody Quick Reaction Force waiting around the corner the entire time I've been working here." He turned to Lestrade and pierced him with his glare. "You would know, of course. He sent you here to have an eye on me, after all."
Sally sighs, knowing there is no use arguing. "Fine. At least let me tidy up my desk, though. I don't want everyone knowing what I'm doing. You know how people in this place gossip."
"No, Mrs Hudson!" Sherlock called back. "John and I are going back to Baskerville. If all goes well, he'll be back in his real body in time for breakfast."
And that was that.
But of course Sherlock was not one to be content with staring when he could be touching instead, now that he was finally able to do so.
"What I should have said a long time ago. What I wanted to, always, and never have, because I didn't think you'd want to hear it. Shoved it all down and ignored it. I must have done a better job than I thought if I managed to fool even you. But I love you anyway."
"I certainly wouldn't try to play Big Brother with them," she says. "This may be news to you, but a relationship built on mutual trust and love would actually make him tell you things himself. If you're willing to do the same, which I doubt."
He bent down and carefully put his violin into the case, scooping the coins and bills he had earned into a pouch before closing the lid.
“I’m fine,” he said. “I was just ... thinking about holding your hand.”
"H.M.H.M.H.," he finally said. "Hurt me heal me hands."
"I might as well expect it to snow on the sun," Mrs Hudson says, stepping forward and kissing his cheek. "Now get out of that coat and take off your shoes, you're dragging mud all over the floor."
The little fantasy in Sherlock's head burst like a soap bubble and he hastily schooled his features into a neutral expression. "I'm always happy to surprise her."
She glances out of the tinted window. "Can you tell your driver to drop me off at ASDA? I need to buy some groceries."
They woke some time later and took a shower where Sherlock demonstrated that an entire pack of cigarettes was not the only thing that fit into his mouth and that yes, it was possible for him to deduce precisely when John would come.
"I wouldn't have let you," Sherlock whispered. "There is a limit to my self-control and I think that would have been it. I spent our entire stay there going back and forth between wanting to tell you and being terrified of it all falling apart the moment I did. I'd get ready to tell you and you'd make an off-handed remark about Mary and I'd remind myself that you loved her and didn't feel that way about me. And in the end I stayed silent. I thought if it was going to destroy me, at least I wouldn't drag you down as well."
John shook his head.
He managed to get on his feet and stood still for a bit, letting his body adjust. The dissonance was at its lowest level, easily disregarded. He didn't expect it to stop any time soon. So long as John was either here with him or on his mind, Sherlock knew the pain response would not stop. There was nothing he could do about that.
Trying and failing, because a moment later the laughter bursts through, right past John's fingers and into the darkness of their flat.
But of course Sherlock would never knock and so she finds herself alone with John Watson instead.
Mary knew something was wrong the moment John walked through the door.
"I was just about to start on the son's autopsy, if you'd like to watch," Molly offered. "We have been pretty swamped lately or I would've done it sooner."
John bounded up the stairs with a low bark, leaving Sherlock to close the door and follow him at a more sedate pace.
He noticed how Sherlock tensed at the word 'husband' and his stomach rolled.
Either way, here he was, conditioned to be Silent at the cost of every emotion. Every child learned that touching a hot stove resulted in pain. Psy children learned that the same thing was true for expressing or even feeling sentiment. They got to live a full life, safe from the madness that had haunted their ancestors, and the price for that was everything that made life worth living.
Sherlock held on tighter.
"But..."
He broke off and his eyes got that distant look in them that John had come to know well. "Yes?"
"When you moved in, you didn't even shake her hand. Now she initiates physical contact with you every chance she gets."
"Silence," Sherlock said calmly but decisively, "is paramount. I may not act the way you are used to from the Psy, but I wish you to be aware that I had to adapt my ways to better suit my clients, who are mostly humans and occasionally changelings. I may mimic their behaviour, but do not for one moment believe my Silence to be anything less than perfect in every aspect."
A sideboard held a number of tattered paperbacks and a pile of games. Sherlock grinned when he noticed the Cluedo.
John sighed and turned away to pace, needing some form of outlet for his agitation. "I'm sorry but there you have it. Don't ask me where that came from just now because I have no idea."
Personally, John wouldn't have cared if Sherlock had slaughtered an entire platoon. He had brought Rosie back. Nothing else mattered.
"Ha. Damn right. What's it like, living with his majesty?"
She arrives out of breath, strands of hair escaping from her braid, her cheeks flushed from running all the way from the tube. "Uh, why were Sherlock and John snoring on the stairs in the hallway?"
"Perhaps William here would oblige us," her husband suggested, winking at Sherlock.
"That is not even remotely reassuring, John," Sherlock said. "Here, let me see."
"I wasn't-" John started, but Sherlock continued talking as if he hadn't spoken at all.
Sally sighed. "Are you going to bitch about this for the rest of the week?"
John shook his head. "Mating ceremonies don't have to include rings, though some couples like to use them anyway."
That teased a weak chuckle out of him, warm puffs of air against Sherlock’s chest. He forced himself not to think about the sensation beyond registering it.
"Well, they are utterly delightful," their landlady said. "I'm glad you put them on the card, Sherlock!"
"Yes, I know." Sighing, John buried his face in his hands for a moment. "I just want all of this to be over. I want this killer to be caught and I want a solution for ... all this."
Not yet, not quite, though neither of them pretended to be unaffected.
She falls asleep quickly and he makes sure the baby monitor is switched on before returning downstairs to the sitting room.
"Fantastic," John echoed.
John hated being injured.
He lowered his gaze. "And I have to admit I never intended to sign. It felt like signing my soul away. I wanted you to stay so badly. I saw the way you looked at me at the function. I saw your jealousy when Alexander flirted with me. It gave me hope that maybe, if I played my cards right, you'd realise you didn't need her to make you happy. You spent so much of the past week complimenting me, I had started to think you were finally catching up. You can't imagine what it felt like when you asked me to sign again. I wanted to refuse, I really did. And then you said
Once their first hunger was sated, their conversation resumed and they talked about nothing and everything. They touched on old cases and people they had met on some of their more ridiculous adventures and what they might do with themselves once the case was wrapped up. That was as much as they were both willing to discuss regarding the serial murders - the time after they were stopped for good.
It was crazy. If his life had gone the way it had been supposed to go, he would be married and on his honeymoon right now, with his wife. Instead he was still a bachelor, his wife-to-be was a) dead and b) an assassin and he was
They keep Mary in jail while they prepare for the trial. Sally is absolutely sure that Mycroft Holmes is pulling certain strings in the background because the entire process happens much faster than it usually does.
Sherlock had stood precisely one and a half steps behind John and had found occasion to examine the window visible over his friend's shoulder in great detail as he fought not to react in any way. And if there was a look of mild disgust on his face, it could easily be explained away by his opinion of sentiment as a whole.
The hand on his back briefly tightened in his fur before returning to its gentle stroking. "You are not in a war zone anymore, John. If you need my scent to remind you of that, I'm right here."
again, and that wasn't ... it wasn't ...
Sally blinks. "I don't think they'd want me there."
"Well enough but he would prefer to be back in his own body," Sherlock translated. "Obviously."
"Ha. Point taken."
John barely managed to catch it with his right hand, then continued to drag Sherlock into the hall and past the bathroom door towards his bedroom.
Before he knew it, Sherlock found himself on his knees in front of his best friend, both hands on John’s upper arms, gaze fixed on his. “Breathe. That’s it. See? It’s okay. It’ll be okay.”
They continued working in silence, only stopping for bathroom breaks and more tea. At one point, Mrs Hudson brought them a plate full of sandwiches, which they finished almost without noticing.
*****
He stared at John, drinking him in. They were lying side by side in the warm grass, the sun shining down on them and glinting in John's grey hair. He looked so good it hurt and Sherlock's heart swooped, tittering dangerously between overwhelming joy at seeing him, gratefulness for his own subconsciousness, and yet more heartbreak.
They both wanted more than that, deserved more than that, really.
With Mrs Hudson gone and the door closed behind her, the flat was very quiet. The silence turned heavy as Sherlock and John both realised it was the first time they had been alone together since that morning.
"So he died after his father. Perhaps he killed him and returned home to find his own murderer already waiting for him."
Speaking of ... there was no food left in his bowl, either, unsurprisingly. His stomach growled.
"What makes you so certain?" Patrick Wiltshire asked, frowning.
Sherlock blinked and raised his head from his breakfast to glance across the room. "They're competing for the attention of Mr Marquis."
She stared down at Johnny, who had sat down next to Sherlock and was sniffing at his coat.
"That may be how he managed to go without a full shift for so long," Emily mused, turning her head to address Tyson. "What do you think?"
Sherlock grinned back. "I never guess."
"Nope."
"Was there anything else?" Sherlock asked warily.
John blinked at her. "Come again?"
Molly raises both eyebrows at her and Sally falls silent. "Fine. Maybe I am worrying. I've got a good reason, though."
Deniability was good. Deniability meant they could eventually run into each other on the street a couple of years from now and the words wouldn't hang between them, a painful reminder of what Sherlock wanted and John couldn't give, making everything awkward.
"Don't look at me like that," Sherlock had told him. "You'll be an uncle and Mummy and Father will finally have the grandchild they always wanted."
John shrugged ruefully. "Thought you might want to know."
The detective himself lingered, giving John a carefully questioning look.
"Me neither," John said, which made Small look at him in surprise. "You saved me from a terrible marriage to a killer. I'm not pissed about that, mate. I had no clue who she was or what she had done. And I'm sorry about your sister. This doesn't bring her back, but I understand why you did what you did." He shrugged. "Can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing, to be honest."
Now that, John decided, was definitely dismissive. He bared his teeth at the man, just a little, and gave a low growl.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sally has a pretty good idea of how that happened and while she isn't going to shed a tear for them, something inside her rankles at the idea of this man subverting the justice system.
"What's so special about him?" John asked, leaning over Sherlock's shoulder for a better view.
“Yeah, no, I get that. I just ... hate that this was the choice you had to make.”
"Uh..." John said, torn between thanking the man and informing him that actually he was getting married to his very female fiancee in a month.
? Really, John, what do you think of me?"
Sherlock quickly found the area that indeed showed less dust than the rest and started knocking on the boards until he found a place that sounded hollow.
But of course, that too is informative. She's dealing with a professional, someone who didn't just decide to go out and kill this particular woman on a whim.
3. Kill whoever had taken him.
"Lestrade would kick us out in a heartbeat," John told him, smirking. "And he'd probably ban you from crime scenes for the foreseeable future, too."
"My apologies. Would you be so kind as to lift your left front paw?"
He stood even as he spoke, then looked at John and corrected himself. “Actually, you should sit up.”
It took less than five minutes for the medication to kick in and he closed his eyes in relief as the pounding in his skull receded to a dull thrum that was easily ignored.
"Come on," Sherlock said, hopping out of the rental jeep and starting to unload their bags. "We've got a few hours of daylight left, might as well make use of them and explore the area."
Sherlock nodded and the gratitude on his face was another stab to John's heart.
He shook the thought off and moved to get up.
John's eyes widened a little and he nodded.
He sighed and stood. No point doing this sitting down. He knew he would run away again, could feel the tension building in his legs already.
Little did he know that he would not see Sherlock again for three long, bleak years.
John laughed. "It's not quite so fun when you have to constantly re-buy your clothes. Or when you accidentally wear your favourite t-shirt and don't bother to take it off before."
Sherlock felt himself tense and chanced a glance at John, who had plastered on his best polite smile. "Thank you. I think I know just the man for the job."
His heart beat hard in his chest and Sherlock let his hands stroke up and down John's jeans-clad thighs. "You know, I think I might rather enjoy that. Dates courtesy of the Yard? I'd love to see what they come up with."
John blinked and raised his head, then decided to wake up properly and sat up fully. "Really?"
John laughed. "That's fair. But we'll keep the long-term goals in mind here, yeah? Instant gratification will feel nice for the moment but we both deserve something better than that."
"Hmm, and there's no use in ruining a young life over something that should get him a medal, really." John made sure to keep his own face neutral as he spoke, not daring to turn his head and meet Sherlock's gaze. "The poor bastard is already suffering enough."
The fact of the matter was that it was his and Sherlock's fourth Christmas together and their previous Christmases had not been something to brag about - at least to normal people.
The words died in his throat, along with any breath left in his lungs.
"Are you ready now?," he mumbles. "'cause if you are I might hate you a little bit."
"Will-?" John began, before remembering Sherlock's name. "Oh. Did he indeed?" He grinned at Sherlock, who was suddenly very busy swirling the dregs of his tea around the bottom of his cup.
"I'm sure I would remember that," Sherlock said, stepping closer. "Come on, John, move aside, I can't see with you blocking the way."
There is nowhere for his body to go now, held between the proverbial rock and a hard place, only the hard place are the planes of John's chest and his strong thighs and Sherlock is trapped between John's body and the kitchen counter, both equally unyielding.
"Wait until I've had a good look around, then you can sniff anything you like," Sherlock told him. "Try to see if you can find that same smell you noticed in his parents' home."
"Everything," he gasped. "I want everything."
His Psy was staring down at their clasped hands as if he had never seen them before. His expression was calm enough, however, so John decided he could handle a bit more.
John opened his mouth to say that so did he, but thought better of it. Mrs Hudson was never going to agree to that, anyway.
Sherlock looked at him, a curiously soft expression on his face.
He made a low noise that sounded embarrassingly much like a whimper. "No."
The sound of sirens reached his ears. "Mycroft, the ambulance is here. I'm sure I won't need to tell you where they're taking him. Don't overdo it with the fretting, he will be fine. I've already taken measures to get the fever down, I just want a thorough check-up and some proper medication in him once we know what the issue is."
John shook his head, resisting the urge to just tell him. He couldn't do that. The moment he spoke the words out loud, their entire relationship (whatever the hell it was) would be irrevocably altered and there was a strong chance - a very strong one - that Sherlock would tell him it didn't mean anything and he was sorry and that was the exact thing John did not want to ever hear him say.
John flinched and Sherlock wanted to disappear.
"Your parents named their dog after your flatmate?"
Sherlock snarled wordlessly, which seemed quite sufficient to get his point across.
She shrugged. "It was nothing. He seems ... you seem close. I wouldn't want anything to happen to him."
"I never wanted nor needed an apology from you," Sherlock told him. "I can hardly claim to have gone about it in the best possible way. Now, why are you here, then?" He paused and something in his tone changed. "Are ... are you coming home?"
"Yeah, fine. Thanks. Just thinking. Should we go back? I can't leave Sherlock alone with paperwork for too long or he'll contrive a way to set it on fire or something."
dogs.
"It takes some time, adjusting to being here again," the older woman softly says. She doesn't sound convinced.
But no, he mustn't get ahead of himself. Perhaps he had read it all wrong and was jumping to conclusions. Just because Sherlock had basically stated he loved him, that didn't necessarily have to mean anything more than the 'I love yous' exchanged by friends and family. And up to now, there had never been any indication that he wanted ... wanted ... that he
Perhaps it was the way Sherlock flinched or the way he refused to meet John's gaze that finally made the full extend of what had happened sink in.
for me to love. Someone I could love and be sure to have it returned. I don't know why I thought Mary fit the bill, but there you have it. It never occurred to me that you did. Greg had to tell me to my face."
Groaning he reached for it and tried to focus his bleary eyes on the screen. It only took a moment for all traces of sleepiness to evaporate from his system.
"More like a cloying stink, but go on," Lestrade muttered, wrinkling his nose.
The moment that fact sank in, John felt his insides turn cold with fear and disappointment.
John, determined to further undermine the wobbly ground Sherlock stood on, rubbed his head against his friend's hipbone and stomach before returning his head to its previous position on his lap.
"I promise," he said, making sure to meet John's gaze this time. "I promise I won't ever deliberately put you through that pain again. We both know we can't help the dangers of the job but it's infinitely safer for me to have you there with me. I've gotten used to having back-up. They almost got the drop on me twice while I was away because I forgot you weren't there to watch my back. But I made it through. And I made it home. That's all that matters."
"Shit!" John exclaimed, his anger instantly forgotten and replaced with guilt. "Excuse me for a minute."
Sherlock, mildly surprised, reached out and shook it firmly before moving to scoop up John. "Come on, Johnny. Let's get you home. I'll have to tell Lestrade if he has a nice murder for us, he'll have to relocate the crime scene to the flat."
The simple statement kept echoing in John's mind. An admission, as if he had needed one, but also a damning piece of evidence of just how much he had misjudged his best friend.
"I think we can update that from suspect to culprit," Sherlock said. "I have absolutely no doubt that he killed his father in the heat of the moment. Most likely to prevent him from approaching me about the case, lest I stumble upon the fact that his son was hiding an illegitimate child from his very religious parents. People have killed for less."
"I was too busy trying to talk him into signing the divorce papers to think too much about why I needed them in the first place. I suppose I'll have to ask, eventually. Why on earth can't I remember?"
"I love you," he finally managed. "And I'll always be grateful that you found your way back home to me."
get better.
John grinned. "I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Why don't we discuss this over a drink?"
Mary smiled and if it was a bit shaky, he decided not to read too much into it. "See that you do. I called the florist yesterday to finalise the flower arrangements and we have our first rehearsal scheduled for next week."
John sighed. "Because you are my flatmate and even though you are a massive arse with no understanding of social interaction whatsoever, I do consider you my friend and I refuse to let you come to harm."
By the time he made it out of the shower and into dry clothes, he was wide awake and contemplating how long he would have to wait for Molly to arrive at the morgue so she could get back to him about Mr Forsythe's feet.
So ... wait until John was asleep. And then? He frowned. This was their second night at the hotel, meaning they had another four ahead of them - and he still had a case to solve, too. No, it wouldn't do to reach out now, to pull John close and whisper his name and destroy everything he held dear for one moment of selfishness. But perhaps... perhaps he could move, later, much later. If he managed to stay awake - he did a quick calculation: 17% chance of that happening - he might be able to shuffle a little closer in the early hours of the morning.
"Hmm? Oh, no. Just put them in a pile," he tells her distractedly.
Sally, her fork halfway to her mouth, frowns. Is this normal for him? She doesn't remember - his eating habits never used to be any concern of hers. Still aren't, actually. She makes a mental note to ask Mrs Hudson about it later.
"This isn't like that," he said firmly. "I'm here."
John shrugged. "What, do you think I'm angry with him for stopping me from making the biggest mistake of my life? No, thank you. I want to know why and I could have done without the horror of those first couple of days." He made a face at the memory of the nightmares, the guilt and the pain. "But in the end, it worked out all right, yeah? Imagine if I had actually married her and found out about it afterwards. That would have been one hell of a mess. If she didn't get fed up with me and kill me at some point, divorcing her would have been a nightmare, what with her not even having a real name that we know of. This was ... cleaner, I suppose."
sofa," Lestrade said.
Sherlock snorted. "That's one way of putting it, but I do agree that Sergeant Donovan has a good instinct for what is the truth and what is a lie, particularly when it comes to people faking emotions they don't have."
Sherlock looked up into his eyes and saw only honest determination and a quiet happiness. It was a shock to see all of it directed at him. He swallowed and smiled. "Yes. No more."
John wanted to kick himself for all the pain he had caused with his careless words and actions. An overwhelming wave of fondness for the man in his arms swept through him and he could feel his features soften in response.
Satisfied with this explanation, Sherlock decided to spend some more time focusing on the here and now.
True to the announcement on their website, there was no phone signal, no television and only one old radio behind the reception desk that was only turned on for the evening and morning news.
Mycroft smelled ... well, he smelled exactly as he looked - like someone who spent the great majority of his time in an expensively furnished office doing Very Important Things. That, and a strong whiff of authority and pastries. The latter made John hide his face in the arm of his chair in case his expression somehow betrayed him.
John frowned. "Is everything all right? You seem a bit..." He waved his hand helplessly, trying to encompass all of Sherlock.
Maybe when Rosie was older, he would see John again. Perhaps arrange for Rosie to visit for a week during the summer holidays or so. Show her the bees and let her swim in the sea. Maybe John would bring her, or collect her, or even just tag along.
"I ... Harrison?" she stammered. "Haven't you heard the news? My husband has unexpectedly passed away."
This was the area where dogs had to be kept on a lead. John was glad about it - part of him was itching to jump into the water and catch one of the ducks.
Not anymore, though.
"What?"
Now it was John's turn to be surprised. "Why the hell wouldn't I? I'm always nagging you to eat more, aren't I?"
Then he tilted his head and examined it. And then he went and dragged Sherlock off the couch and into the kitchen.
They’d been friends. John needed to remember that. Sherlock and Mary had been friends, had actively liked each other and enjoyed one another’s company. It was just another thing that made her so utterly perfect for John - as if she had been made to fit into the life he led, full of crime and adventure and a mad scientist.
"Hey Rosie," he rasped. "Let's go home to Daddy. I promise you can pet Redbeard, too."
"Why does it matter if she still has it?" Lestrade asked.
John thought, suddenly amazed by that fact.
A strong, happy marriage that had withstood many years and the loss of a considerable fortune and a close relative, perhaps a child. Yet the husband looked at his wife with undisguised affection and she didn't pay attention to the rich and reasonably attractive investment banker two tables over.
Sherlock gave him a look.
He merely shrugged instead.
John sighed and resigned himself to his fate. At least he would be clean.
John shrugged. "Well, there's nothing I can do, is there? They'll either get him or they won't. If they don't, they at least have a lead to follow now. And if they do, we will hear about it soon enough."
Oh no. Hurting John was not good, he hadn't meant to do that.
"The Lilly Bridge Depot in South Kensington," Sherlock said, shrugging. "She texted the address to John's phone. It wasn't exactly rocket science. Which reminds me..." He pulled the phone from his pocket and handed it back to John, along with the battery.
John shakes his head. "I'm done here. I don't care what else there is. It's already too much. I just want to put this all behind me as quickly as possible."
"What are they?" Sherlock asked instantly.
'-to ever have to hide that look on your face again.'
Sherlock managed to hide his wince at these words. They were too familiar, too much of a relationship thing. As much as he wanted to hear that, it wasn't the sort of thing Mary should witness.
Sherlock recalled the way John would sometimes reach out for him when he got frustrated by a case, when the tension rose and he hunched his shoulders without quite noticing. He recalled how, before their recent agreement, John had always snatched his hand away.
"Interesting thing, a tuxedo. It lends anonymity to waiters and distinction to old friends."
He closed his eyes, recalling the precise moment, and then opened them to look into John's eyes. "When I saw the bomb at the pool. I have never been more terrified in my life, John. It took me that long to understand it all - my attraction to you, my jealousy, my need to impress you in any way I could, to catch and keep your attention ... it crystallised right at that moment and from then on, I did everything I could to keep you safe."
His cheeks were flushed and hair tousled, his eyes bright. There was a smile on his face. John relaxed.
When Sherlock emerged from the bathroom, towel-drying his hair and still looking rather disgruntled, John didn't waste any time shoving his pajamas at him.
It's the closest they have ever gotten to talking about it, John thinks vaguely, but it doesn't really matter because a moment later he's reaching out, grasping Sherlock's collar with one hand and the back of his head with the other and pulling him down.
The very same coffee table on which they had earlier set their Christmas goose. The goose that was stuffed with firecrackers.
But none of them really focused on him, too distracted by the other occupant of the room.
John glanced at the clock. "Care for a walk through Regent's Park?"
The need won out, as it always did, and he strode down the hall and pushed the door open, trying to tell himself that Sherlock was fine.
The first brush of John's mouth against his made him freeze, the second made him gasp. By the third, he had managed to get a hold of John, both his hands bunched in the soft wool of his jumper, and was kissing him back rather desperately.
The look became a glare.
John gave him a long, blank look.
Sherlock allowed himself to be dragged to Regent's Park and didn't even try to protest when John very insistently demanded to be released by biting the lead.
That reckless, inexplicable urge to be closer, to press their mouths together and just fuse into one person.
Would he ever hold his daughter in his arms again and watch her play with any of them?
"I'll be getting in contact with my network then," Sherlock said, pocketing the prints. "Redbeard, heel."
Sherlock huffs and ducks his head under the guise of snatching one of the building blocks out from under John's chair. It doesn't quite prevent John from seeing that his cheekbones are tinged pink.
He had to duck out of the way to avoid getting hit in the face by a flying loaf of bread and turned to glare at his flatmate. "You did that on purpose."
"I haven't checked out here in a while," Sherlock said ambiguously and John nodded, remembering their earlier conversation in the bath. Best be careful then.
"Biscuits?" Donovan echoed as Lestrade grimaced.
Sherlock is pacing up and down the hallway and Sally's coffee is going cold. She takes an absent-minded sip and makes a face at it. She abandons the cup and watches Holmes pace, his hands in his hair. She wonders how much self-flaggelation he is subjecting himself to right now.
“I haven’t seen her in a couple of days,” Sherlock said. His voice sounded odd to his own ears. “And female physiology is hardly my speciality. Unless she was showing any clear signs, I would not have had any way to know.”
He smiled to himself, listening to the shower being turned on in the bathroom. He couldn’t wait.
"Pa?" her voice was sleepy, questioning, and the simple question made John's heart clench. When had his daughter learnt to love Sherlock? When had
Sherlock swallowed. "My apologies. How good of you to join us, John. Come, sit down. Mrs Hendriksen was just about to tell me all about Frederik. You know," he added innocently, "the bloke who got killed here."
Lestrade cursed. "Anything else?"
He shifted, tried to get his legs under him and push himself up with his arms - and failed.
Holmes launches into an explanation, something about a literal Underground network and a threat to the Houses of Parliament, CCTV footage of a man disappearing off a train in between two stations and, of course,
When she falls into her bed late that evening, she is tired to her bones but also strangely satisfied with her life. Sure, losing her flat like this is a blow, but it was just a flat and this ... this feels like home. Or it could do, if she finds a way not to let Sherlock Holmes get on her nerves until she's ready to commit bloody murder. His reaction may have been tame today, but she doesn't let that fool her for a minute.
John. John. John. John was here. Here, in France, sitting in the grass next to him as if he had just popped round for a cuppa, as if this was normal. Still holding his hand.
He does.
He glanced around, looked at the ground. "Unless you're trying to make money while also escaping the notice of any orderlies," he mused. "Doesn't look like this is a designated busking area."
Sherlock mutely shook his head.
Sherlock looked surprisingly satisfied at the question. "Oh yes. I killed four of them myself and Mycroft and his people took care of the others. We burned the entire place to the ground when we left."
“And Janine is...?”
Sherlock thought about that for a second but couldn't find anything obviously wrong with that statement. "And?"
“They are going to fade quite a bit,” he said. “Scar tissue usually does after a while. I’m sure they’re already a lot better than when you first came home.”
When it became clear that none would be forthcoming, John forced a half-smile and raised his hand, which held a brown paper bag. "Have you eaten? I brought croissants."
His left arm was numb because he had been lying on it for most of the night but he was warm and comfortable and could hear Sherlock’s steady heartbeat right beneath his ear. One of Sherlock’s arms was still loosely wrapped around his middle, holding him close, and the man himself was fast asleep.
They don't see either hide or hair from the inhabitants of 221b for two days. Mrs Hudson tells Sally she has heard people moving about so she's reasonably sure they are both still up there but she hasn't seen or spoken to either of them.
"I would have thought it was obvious," Sherlock said, not even bothering to look up. He was trying to stare John down, his grip on the towel unrelenting. "I'm trying to figure out for how long Johnny here can keep up a consistent pressure of his jaw. It might be useful in taking down a suspect and holding him in place until you lot arrive at the scene."
John noticed the change from past to present tense and frowned. Who did he know whom Sherlock might be interested in and who was so clearly unavailable that Sherlock had decided to give up on him?
Sherlock beamed at him. “Fantastic, John! Molly showed me the body of some idiot who got himself killed by a lion.”
John feels his lips tighten. "Still texting Irene?"
Even as he had said that he would have let John get married, his arms had tightened by the tiniest fraction and John was sure he hadn’t imagined the slight waver in Sherlock’s voice as he’d said
"I am so sorry, Mr Holmes. I don't usually blubber about like this, but the last few days have been an absolute nightmare."
"Uh ... there are a couple of cases I was hoping Sherlock could take a look at," Lestrade stammered. "But take your time."
"That's not all they did, though, is it?"
They all looked around. The table where Mr and Mrs Walczak had sat was glaringly empty.
"We can't all arrive in helicopters," Sherlock replied. "And I'm sure you've had one of your minions track our car's progress. Or did you actually do it yourself?"
particularly feverish, but John had seen him walk around with every appearance of good health mere minutes after being tasered by a killer with a cattle prod. There was no limit to Sherlock's acting skills when he didn't want someone to see behind his facade.
As if on cue, it started to hail.
"Wish it worked like that," Greg muttered. "You'll have to let him go eventually, Sherlock. It's clearly not working out. Do you really want to be with someone who wants to be elsewhere? That's not fair on any of you. And anyway, I thought he loved you? Sure sounded like it when I spoke to your nurse."
Again, John could only shake his head.
"Johnny," Donovan said and John promptly turned to look at her, ears perked like any dog would when hearing his name.
“A lion, John! Some British explorer or something. They found his body in the savanna and had him sent back home for a thorough examination because the local morgue wasn’t equipped to handle the case and she showed me clear teeth imprints. She promised to make a cast.”
"I'm sure you know better than I do," she says. "Our schedules mean our paths don't often cross in the house."
And he turned and walked straight back out the door.
"So you think Rosie is adorable?," John asks, his grin widening.
He waved his hand to his team and they opened the door, letting him enter first.
"You didn't stop me."
Breathing was surprisingly difficult around the sudden lump in his throat.
he thought again.
He sighed and tried to think about Mary. Holding her in his arms, kissing her. He wondered what it would be like, dancing with her. She was small, about the same height as him. He would not have to raise his hands quite so high, wouldn't have to bend his head back at all, wouldn't breathe in the scent of Sherlock's shampoo and the air just before a storm and something oddly thrilling that was all Sherlock.
The demonstration consisted of John proving that yes, he was indeed capable of throwing Sherlock onto the floor in two seconds flat. He did, however, make sure that the detective didn't hit his head on the way down.
"Got it."
John woke to a large, warm hand on his shoulder and Sherlock's hushed voice hissing in his ear.
"He's a cute dog, I'll give you that," Sally said as she handed the lead back to him. "How long is he staying with you?"
John refused to blush. He absolutely refused to.
John took a step forward, and another.
He would keep this in mind.
“Shhh,” John said again, softly, continuing the lazy movement of his hand across Sherlock’s chest. “It’s all right. I’ve got you. It’s okay.”
He let out a quiet sigh. It was pointless to speculate. John was unpredictable in all the wrong moments and this was sure to be one of them. So Sherlock would allow himself to hope for the best and brace himself for the worst and perhaps be pleasantly surprised for once.
But it was Sherlock’s turn to shake his head. “No. If our roles had been reversed, you would have made the same choice. Don’t pretend you wouldn’t have.”
His frustration was evident to John - and it was all the evidence he needed to know that Sherlock had already spent considerable time thinking about it. And if anyone was clever enough to find a loophole, surely it was Sherlock.
“Oh, god yes,” Sherlock gasped. “
"I'll just... say goodbye to her," he murmured. "Sit, Redbeard."
"We can't always go everywhere together," he said briskly. Suddenly, the morgue felt quite cold.
She sniffed and looked about to start crying again.
They came to a halt in front of the required address after nine and a half minutes and Sherlock made good on his word, throwing the money at the driver and telling him to keep the change as he pushed open the door and lifted John out of the cab.
John whuffed.
"Why I got drunk," Sherlock explained, not even exasperated by having to explain himself. Forming full sentences was still a bit of a struggle.
"The waiter," John prompted. "Are you going to take him up on his offer?"
“Hold still,” he ordered and Sherlock froze in position, bent backwards at an awkward 45 degree angle. If he was startled, he didn’t show it, his expression calm and trusting as he rolled his eyes back to watch John.
His Psy nodded. "Noted. I will take your words into consideration."
Harry Watson, 11:45
Sherlock jumped up as if he had only been waiting for John to ask. "Of course."
It's late when Sally returns home, past 9pm already. It's a cool night, a typical early London summer, and she's surprised to find Sherlock and John in the hallway.
After their gift exchange, John had decided to switch from punch to tea and was starting to feel less buzzed, which was why he didn't mind when Sherlock decided to play the violin a bit more. They had sat and talked about some of their past cases and then Sherlock had gotten his "I've got an idea!" look that he only got when he arrived at the solution of a particularly interesting case or when a new composition popped into his mind.
Her siblings all offer her a place, of course, but they live on the other side of London and Sally really doesn't want to have to commute to and from work for two hours each way, so she declines.
"Let me see that," John demanded, momentarily forgetting any hint of politeness.
"Yes, of course," John replied, sounding surprised. "I was just going to eat something first. It takes a while to get home on the tube and we haven't eaten since breakfast."
Another attempt was made and John seemed to at least manage to focus on Sherlock's instructions and tried to follow them. The stress about the entire situation still had him shaking from head to paw and he didn't dare move fast, but along with Lestrade's gentle encouragement as he kept several paces ahead of them, they finally made it all the way to the lift. Once inside, the doors closed and the cabin set in motion, promptly causing John to lose his balance again.
"Would you mind?"
They left.
Knowing the answer would not come to him from standing in the shower, no matter how much he wanted it to, John went about washing himself and finally stepped out of the shower, wrapping himself in a warm, fluffy towel. His cat luxuriated in the soft fabric and he let out an involuntary rumble, the closest he could get to a purr.
"One day," John said quietly, "I will have made it up to you. If you'll let me. I need you to know that you are my priority, too, even though I've been right shitty at showing it."
"Yes, I'm taking you to your Pa now," he promised. "That was quite enough adventuring for a day and it's way past your bedtime."
Sherlock grumbled but complied and John dragged himself out of bed with considerable effort.
The open hostility on the male's faces gave way to wary curiosity.
"I assumed you had people to hack my computer if you wished to find out what I'm doing."
"Conall, Amanda Conall," she introduced herself. "I've been working here for almost ten years."
"Of course you do. You always do." Sherlock smiled. "I felt that. And then... it was as if he couldn't reach me properly anymore. It was exhausting him. He kept demanding to know what I had done."
They separated after a long minute or two, both slightly out of breath but feeling happier now that they had agreed on this much at least.
"Can't really argue with that," Lestrade sighed. "Divorces are shitty, no matter what, and yours would have been even worse, given the circumstances. Well, come along then."
Behind him, Molly stated her name and all the other tedious data she needed to be recorded for her report before moving on to carefully describe the body and every article of clothing before and after removing and examining them before setting them aside for later. Then came the examination and description of the naked body, with every finding precisely dictated in Molly's clear voice.
He didn't have to wonder long. A moment later, John rose on his tiptoes and Sherlock found his mouth otherwise occupied with no room to spare for John's palm.
John sat in his chair and looked at him and the look on his face ... Sherlock lowered his gaze. "John..."
Two letters. One for Sherlock. One for ... one for ... everyone, probably. Himself. Mary. Mostly for himself, though. She wasn't going to read it, after all.
"Hm?"
His voice was matter-of-fact, a statement rather than a question. His hand continued stroking up and down John's back and neck.
Sherlock blinked, eyes wide. "John ... of course I want this. It's all I've
John stared at him, struck by the fierceness in Sherlock's voice, the conviction to his words. He looked tense and angry and worried all at the same time and looking at his face John found he could very easily believe that Sherlock would commit homicide for him.
It was difficult to remember that, however, with Sherlock's hands skating across his chest and a warm mouth pressed to his neck. John made a noise that sounded embarrassingly much like: "Gnnnuh."
Sherlock bit out a harsh laugh. "No." He swallowed. "Don't distress yourself. I haven't been all right in over two years. Perhaps I never will be."
The moment they both discovered that, everything stopped.
"What are you doing to me?" John asked. "What- what are you doing?"
*****
He didn't even make a noise, this time. He was reasonably sure there were no tears, either. He was all dried out, nothing left to give. There was only the distant knowledge of the hard floor beneath his knees, the unmistakable scent of John that clung to the chair, and the rough feeling of the worn material of the upholstery against his face.
"Must have been after his fake death, then," Sally said, shrugging. "You're just hurt because he didn't invite you to the wedding."
At some point around noon, Mrs Hudson came back up, ruffled Sherlock’s hair and pulled John into a tight hug, made awkward by the fact that he had his hands full of gruesome crime scene photographs and barely managed to hug her back properly.
"As I said," Sherlock said softly, not turning to look at him. "It has always been and always will be merely theoretical."
John ignored his gaze as best as he could, focusing on his food instead. It had been too long since he had last had a warm meal, and his growling stomach helped him keep his attention on the steaming chicken chow mein and satay skewers.
Sherlock shook his head. The idea of holding a hot liquid right now was worrying - he could feel himself start to tremble already. There was no getting out of this conversation. The least he could do was avoid second-degree burns.
"So they can kill us all in our beds, probably," Patricia said and the others, while laughing at her drama, nevertheless looked a bit worried.
"Still, there's no need to chance it."
John was proposing a holiday together. His wife - well, bride - had died less than a full week ago and John wanted to take Sherlock away to Edinburgh on a holiday. Just the two of them, and the Royal Botanic Gardens.
He kept forgetting and having to remind himself and every time it felt like a rock dropping into his stomach. For the first time in his life, Sherlock found himself fervently wishing he were anything other than Psy.
“Anything.”
Sherlock smiled at him. "All right, give me a minute and I'll open the back door for you."
He sighed. "I was investigating those serial robberies where all the victims suffered from memory loss. Do you remember?"
John tried to groan but it came out as more of a mix between a whimper and a growl, which wasn't very surprising, really. The sound of their neighbours going at it and enjoying themselves immensely by the sounds of it only served to remind him that he was certainly not going to get a leg over until this entire catastrophe was dealt with and he was back in his own body. He couldn't even get a wank in, for fuck's sake, because even if he found something convenient to rut against as he had seen some dogs do, there was simply no way he would manage to clean up the mess afterwards and he would never live it down if Sherlock found out.
The ocean settles, becomes still and quiet, glinting silver in the light of the sun. Sherlock stares and stares and stares and doesn't breathe.
He waited for Sherlock to give him a nod of confirmation, then started on his way through the flat, nose pressed to the ground as he followed various scent trails through the rooms to see which led where.
“No! I mean - yes, of course I want to come. I just wasn’t sure if-” John broke off and shook his head. “No, you’re right. I’m too preoccupied with what other people think. It’s not like their neat little idea of what my life is supposed to be like has ever matched the reality of it. Let me put on my shoes.”
Sherlock didn't say a word for the rest of the walk to the dining hall, biting his lip to keep the traitorous words from spilling out. John didn't comment on his silence, perhaps thinking he was already in his mind palace and walking on autopilot. It wouldn't be the first time John was wrong about what Sherlock thought.
The ride to the Yard passed in companionable silence. John saw Sherlock's lips twitch every now and then and wondered if he was also looking forward to seeing Lestrade's reaction. He felt his own lips curl upwards in response.
She threw her backpack at him and bolted.
So far, John's character was positively and absolutely his, though a part of him seemed to respond to stimuli dogs would experience in a similar manner. Sherlock supposed that could be expected and wasn't anything worth worrying about.
There was a pause as they continued with the dishes, finally clearing them all away and letting the water drain out of the sink.
“Mr Holmes. I asked where you were at the time of the incident.”
"But you can't be sure," Emily reminded him. "Have you talked to other changelings who had similar experiences?"
"Yes."
Instead, John's gaze fell on something else. Something lay by his foot, almost glowing in the dim light of the city filtering in through the window above him. It looked like a folded piece of paper.
John ordered himself.
"Do it," the mother said. "If you drop him, you're dead. If you save him, I'll give you whatever you want in return."
It was easier to say this now than it used to be. It had always been true, of course, but now there was a sort of satisfaction to it that had been lacking previously. Mary was gone, nothing more than a transitory stop in John's life. He, on the other hand, seemed to have been the final destination all along.
John chuckled and leaned down to kiss the surprise right out of his mouth. "Quite."
he told himself.
Reaching out with both hands, he took hold of the fabric on both of Sherlock's thighs and shoved it about an inch down before pulling along the rest of the trouser leg and finally the hem so the material wouldn't bunch up. The same process was repeated until he had worked the sogging trousers down to Sherlock's knees, all the while trying to stay focused on his task.
John's answer was entirely honest: "Absolutely perfect."
John groaned and arched against him.
Holmes waves a dismissive hand. "No, I knew you would suspect me. It was part of Moriarty's plan, sowing doubt in the minds of the police. Had you not acted on your suspicions, he would have found another, more cruel way of destroying my reputation. It all worked out surprisingly well in the end."
"Oh, thank god."
He flinches at that and she knows her words have hit home. She can only hope he will take them to heart and take better care of himself.
"And yet you eat Chinese food."
“And you did not have any contact with her or the bride until then?”
Stupid, stupid,
Thanks to their notable difference in size, Sherlock had actually managed to curl himself around John in such a manner that he formed a half-circle around him, the thin covers the only barrier between them.
The detective sniffed. "It's not my fault when you don't listen to me, John."
Earlier tonight, Sherlock had cured his psychosomatic limp with a healthy dose of adrenaline and then they had chased a cab on foot and Sherlock had gotten into a taxi with a serial killer and John had gotten to shoot someone.
"Yes of course," he said. "I have a hard time believing that not everyone does, in fact."
Finally, he pulled away, breathing heavily.
"But what possible motive could there be? Unless that person also helped with the disposal of the father's body."
"Lestrade-"
The very thought of such a thing happening, of him uttering a word - or even a sound - of protest, was more than enough to make his knees shake in panic. He didn't want this to happen. It was bad enough that all the important people in his and John's common group of acquaintances had already guessed, the last thing he wanted was for them to look at him with pity in their eyes.
“I ... that ... yes,” he stammered. “Let’s do that.”
A sudden thought occurring to him, John waited for Sherlock to leave the room before rearranging the tiles again. He only spelled out a single word, then formed some of the remaining tiles into a question mark behind it. Once done, he barked to get Sherlock's attention.
He groaned again and sat up. "God, you're a tease. I can't wait to pay you back for this tonight."
Sherlock gave a lazy hum and trapped one of John's legs between his, slowly rocking his hips against John's thigh.
Sherlock merely hummed and continued scrolling through his datapad "I am not surprised."
Sherlock shook his head. "I'm just scanning the information and filing it away in my mental safe. I only need to read through the list and memorise it."
The domesticity of it all was unbearable and Sherlock knew he wouldn't get it again - one afternoon, that was it. One single afternoon where he could act like the father Rosie mistakenly thought he was and let himself pretend that this was his life every day.
Being this close, hidden in the dimly and rather shakily lit broom closet, was intoxicating.
He allowed himself to just shake through it, tried to remove his conscious mind from what was happening and focused only on his breathing, on trying to get enough oxygen into his lungs.
"I'm sorry, I should have called sooner."
"We could ..." Sherlock paused and licked his lips, unable to take his eyes off John. "We could stay right here for half an hour while you explain to me why you aren't absolutely furious. That might do for you, but I can assure you it will do nothing for me. I'm afraid I'm never going to be presentable while you're anywhere in the vicinity."
"You never said," John murmured.
Suddenly, seeing Sherlock stretched out under him was unbearable for how fleeting these minutes of happiness had been. John shifted, trying to get up, and Sherlock groaned and hissed as he brushed against him. Hard and unyielding, right there for John to feel, and he wanted to so badly. Clearly, so did Sherlock. And yet...
Sherlock stared blankly at nothing and felt an age-old beast rear its ugly head in his chest. There really was no choice.
*****
"You going to catch a cab?" John asked as they stepped outside a while later.
Another idea occurred to him. "Come on, John, let's go visit the morgue!"
"Didn't you say it's always unlocked for the smokers?"
The silence took on a worried edge and he could hear his brother taking a breath, most likely to ask all sorts of inane questions - or worse, answer them without bothering to ask. Best stop that before it started.
"Well, he's got you at his mercy and won't let you go. How else would you describe that?"
"Or maybe not," Molly gasps. "Bright red isn't my colour."
Sherlock glanced up at him and then looked back down at his left hand, idly twirling the ring around his finger. "Thank you."
They shared a long look. Next to Sherlock, John gave a low whine and nudged at Sherlock's leg with his nose, his tail thumping against the upholstery. Apparently, he approved of the plan such as it was.
John started to shake.
Sherlock jerked as if he had been electrocuted.
There was a list of possible replies Sherlock could have made to deflect. Instead, John watched his eyes flick to the door.
And John, feeling the irony in every bone in his body, said: "I'm his husband."
Finally, he reached the car and stared into the dark interior, the scent of leather and diesel oil and expensive fabrics assaulting his nose, along with too many other scents he could not immediately name. All of them hinted at lots of money and power, however.
John snorted a laugh. "What, living with you? I don't think so. There's never been any peace and quiet in this flat and I wouldn't want there to be. I'd go spare within a week."
Sherlock’s chair scraped back and a moment later he had rounded the table and was standing next to John, carefully putting one hand on his shoulder. John took a deep, shuddering breath, twisted in his chair and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s middle, burying his face in his best friend’s stomach. Sherlock’s hand slid off his shoulder and around his back and a moment later Sherlock had both arms wrapped around him in return, holding him close.
*****
It is becoming increasingly obvious to John that he is even more oblivious than Sherlock always claims he is.
Then John's brain caught up to reality and he gasped, mouth moving involuntarily. Reacting, responding.
John hadn't stayed much longer after Sherlock had repeated his position. His departure hadn't been a surprise and Sherlock consoled himself with the knowledge that they had at least had a late breakfast together and had managed an entire conversation and John hadn't started shouting more than once.
Sherlock sat down in the Detective Inspector's chair, leaving John to hover over his shoulder. He didn't mind – it was amusing to see the other Yarders try and fail to understand how he could stand the close proximity to a Psy and his cat liked being close to his chosen packmate. He wondered what Sherlock would say if he knew that was how John thought of him. He wished he could reach out and touch him.
He had to bite his tongue to stop himself from asking that, but now the Psy had him absolutely intrigued.
He had never wanted this to happen.
But she doesn't stop. There is a wild zeal inside her now, a hunger for answers.
"Are you here for a specific reason or did you just come to criticise my living arrangements?" John asked.
John swallowed and thought of Sherlock and forbidden touches. Yes, the Psy Council, the closest thing they had to a global government, would definitely see that as an outright act of rebellion. Yet another reason to keep this under the lid. He would have liked to discuss it with someone but he'd rather rip out his own tongue than put Sherlock in that kind of danger.
*****
"Let them check," he said quietly. "John will not want you to see him weak and bare on the floor. Let them see if he is conscious and give him something to wear."
He looked up at John, his eyes big and pleading. "I spent years figuring out who executed the hit. Taught myself how to code and hacked my way through all sorts of secret agency databases until I found her. And then I just had to lie in wait for when she wouldn't suspect a thing. Sorry I ruined your wedding. But I'm not sorry I killed her."
Sherlock frowned. Clearly John was not convinced. This had to change. Sherlock had gone to great lengths to find something, anything, that would match John's expectations of a traditional Christmas and his own of an interesting case. If John wasn't convinced of the brilliance of his plan yet, clearly Sherlock needed to list all the advantages.
Sherlock shook his head and his entire body twitched, torn between his obvious thoughts of escaping and his desire to remain. "Don't do this to me. That's not fair."
To the casual viewer, it looked adorable, a dog and his owner cuddling together. Seen from the perspective of someone who knew that the dog was not usually a dog, it implied rather a lot.
"I have no idea. But I'm sure we'll find out in due time."
The plea was there in his eyes, too. John wondered what it was that Sherlock was so desperate for him to do. Vanish into thin air? Walk away? Pretend he had never come here? Pretend he hadn't seen and heard Sherlock so shattered?
She cooks a celebratory dinner for one while she listens to her sister gush about her honeymoon for the fifth time, smiling the entire time.
"Two things," he said. "First, I know you love Rosie and I understand and accept that you want her to be happy. She clearly loves you, too. So while I may not agree with you going behind my back, I understand why you did it and I don't mind if you continue to call her. She could do with some stability. But I need you to promise that you won't let yourself be distracted. I need to know that you will be there when she calls."
"You'll get used to the peace and quiet in no time," Sherlock promised.

"F-fair." Mary's voice, gurgling, gasping, forcing the words out. "You win."
He could do two more hours, Sherlock decided. Draw out the anticipation a bit, make himself really look forward to the simple pleasure of having a moment that was
"I guess you'd have to see it to believe it," John said, feeling a bit uncomfortable at the idea that anyone thought he adored Sherlock - mostly because it was true.
At least today he would not have to brush her off, would not have to tell her no, or make up an excuse, or flee to the sitting room, or go check on Rosie or whatever else he had done to send the clear message that sex would not be happening. The progress of her pregnancy had been a relief, quite frankly, providing him with the perfect excuse. And of course after the birth there were a blessed couple of weeks where it was not medically advisable. He had been dreading the end of those, quite frankly.
He considered this for another second. "So he can't be exceptionally good-looking. He'd likely be slightly above average, just another face in the crowd, no one to draw attention to himself. The perfect chameleon."
He lay curled up in his armchair where Sherlock had deposited him upon their return. The madman had absolutely refused to let John take so much as a single step unaided. And since there was no other way for Sherlock to aid him, that had resulted in him carrying John around like a sack of potatoes.
Her presence put a noticeable damper on the mood and Sherlock knew he wasn't alone in feeling that way. Whether she knew it or not, Mary wasn't merely intruding in his territory but also in a part of John's life that she wasn't supposed to venture into. From the stiff conversation and the long silences that followed, Sherlock could tell that John wasn't happy, which in turn made him feel rather better about the entire situation.
"I will be taking my leave now," Mycroft continued. "If you require anything, you can contact me via Sherlock's datapad. I believe he has saved me in his contacts under
He redoubled his efforts, almost sobbing with the desperate need for release, for John, for all the things he had denied himself for so long and would never have, regardless of what was happening right at this moment.
*****
The instant relief as his mind was wholly his own again was one of the best things he had ever felt and it got improved upon by the look of anger on Moriarty's face.
John smiled a wry little smile. "Well, you've never been good with sentiment, particularly that of other people towards you."
, John! All I need to do is take one look at his feet and I'll know for sure if he walked a lot and thus confirm the likelihood of his coming to us on foot. And then we can question his widow and close acquaintances to further confirm the habit."
"I passed out."
"Why wouldn't we? Is there anything we should know? There's no legionella in the water, is there?"
Sherock Holmes, 12:07
"Do you mind?," Sherlock asked softly.
"Uh ..." John hesitated. If asked for his honest opinion, he would have to say that Sherlock always looked drop-dead gorgeous. It didn't matter what colour shirt he wore. But of course he couldn't possibly say any such thing aloud. It would give too much away. And besides, it just wasn't done. "You do realise I don't have a clue about fashion, right? I mean, you complain about my jumpers often enough."
"Oh god
Still ... Sherlock deserved better. Better than handing John excuses and reasons. Better than having to listen to his denial and witness his fear. He deserved for John to make him his priority. Because he was, damn it, and John needed him to know that.
It was as if he just -
Sherlock let out a shuddering breath. "We made it," he said softly. "We really made it, John."
"Oh?"
John’s fingers closed around his wrist, an unbreakable tether between them. “Good.”
"You do realise you are covered in mud, do you?" Sherlock asked idly as they passed through the gates, nodding solemnly at the gatekeeper who was in the process of pulling the keys out of his pocket to lock the park for the night.
"Oh, and Sherlock?"
Sherlock crouched down in front of him and ruffled his fur one last time. "See you in a couple of minutes, John. If it helps, you have been a very good dog."
The soft clatter of porcelain on wood drew him from his thoughts as Mrs Hudson placed a steaming cup of tea in front of him. "There you go, my dear. Two sugars, just as you like it."
When she gets home several hours later, she spends the rest of the evening decorating her flat. There are fairy lights - the ones with the soft yellow light she prefers over the colourful or stark white lights that seem all the range these days.
He could hear quick steps approaching and turned his head to see a woman in her thirties jogging down the road towards the house opposite them.
"Really," he confirmed.
John waited.
"And then what?" Sherlock demanded. "At worst he'll walk away all over again and I won't even have this wreck of a friendship left. At best he'll try to let me down gently and superfluously and seeing him will be absolutely unbearable. I will have to sign the bloody papers and probably even attend his wedding because if I didn't, everyone would ask why his supposed best friend couldn't make it. Not that they'd have to wonder, because the number of people in this city who could possibly be left in any doubt whatsoever comes down to exactly one. And that's John himself."
"All right. I'm going to get dressed and then you can tell me what we're going to do next in this investigation. I feel like we haven't made any progress at all yet."
Ages seemed to pass, or perhaps he merely blinked, and then he was in bed, still shaking from head to toe, and those same hands were there and he buried his face against a surprisingly hard chest and breathed in the long-missed, half-forgotten scent of home while Sherlock whispered senseless words of comfort in his ear.
He drew back for a moment to draw in a harsh breath. Sherlock whimpered against him and dipped his head, trying to catch John's mouth with his own again.
But it wasn’t going to last, he knew that. It couldn’t possibly.
"No, but I do intend to have us both die
John froze, so close Sherlock could feel his breath on his mouth. He hadn't known it was possible to want to kiss someone that badly.
Sherlock held her gaze through the camera. "Yes. It is the only option I have. I have broken Silence in the most obvious way. But the Protocol still has me in its grip. The dissonance is still present and will likely set in again very quickly. I also believe that my continued presence in the Net is a security risk for myself and everyone around me. I need to get out."
Had he changed so much in the time Sherlock had been gone? No, that could not be right. Someone like John needed adventure and excitement and it was plain to see every time he accompanied Sherlock on cases these days. John came alive when they hunted criminals down dark alleys and across London's rooftops.
He opened his eyes, not the least bit surprised to find John looking at him. It was still a surprise to see a dog where he would expect his friend. Except that he would never have expected to see John's face upon waking in his bed. Hoped for, perhaps, in a rare moment of maudlin self-indulgence, but never expected.
"And do you usually bring a dog along for interviews?" she demanded, turning and leading the way towards her office, giving Sherlock no choice but to follow in her wake. He caught up to her with two steps and then had to shorten his strides so as not to overtake her.
“I’m almost glad it’s so hot,” Sherlock murmured against John’s clavicle. “Makes behaving myself just a little bit easier.”
John sensed rather than saw Sherlock tense beside him. He plastered on his best polite smile, hoping no one would look at his friend too closely just now. "Thank you. I think I know just the man for the job."
Sherlock nodded back. "Clever of you to spend some time here each year, creating the myth of a ghost haunting the attic to keep people away. It must have come as quite the shock to arrive here, ready to regain at least some of your wealth, only to find that poor Freddy had discovered your hiding place when he was replacing some old wires in the attic. As a general tip to anyone wishing to hide something of value: don't leave it in a place that may be accessed for maintenance work unless you can be certain you will have time to remove it beforehand. You accepted your bad luck and were ready to move on with your life."
John sighed. "That's what I thought you might say. People always assume we're a couple."
"He's gone," Sherlock concludes, voice completely void of emotion. "But it's clear from the route he took where he's headed." He pulls out his phone and texts Lestrade the address. "Come on. Let's go find a Chinese. I could do with a Dim Sum."
Normal is boring.
He bit his lip. He had never been able to deny John anything when he used that tone, when his voice was so full of concern and caring and worry for Sherlock, as if nothing else mattered in the whole wide world but his wellbeing. It was a lie, of course it was, because the wedding they were currently planning was the number one piece of evidence in the case of John Watson Loving Someone Else.
"Steal a- Sherlock, did you watch
Sherlock cleared his throat. "I ... yes. Yes."
*****
A massive thank you for your wonderful comments - you guys really made my week!
Sherlock stared at the cracked, aged leather of the sofa, remembering the many times he had seen John sit on it. "I don't know." He swallowed. "I agreed to do it. I told him I would. I won't break his trust again."
now. John, from his whiskers to the flicking tip of his tail, was no more human today than he had been at any other point in his life. He had made it seem so easy to look human, to act normal, to hide the predator prowling underneath his skin, he had even had Sherlock fooled, had made him forget about the lethal threat he lived with.
John sighed, knowing a lost argument when he saw one. Oh well, at least they wouldn't get bored.
There was a rustle at the other end of the line and then his mother was back. "All right, Sherlock, give me the numbers you want to run."
"And you are really going to put them up this year?"
"In ... but Sherlock, that's over
"Well, you clearly had time to pick up some food on the way," Mary said. "Good to know you're finding time to eat even though you can't text."
That was the only reason John was currently stopping himself from going after him. That, and the look in Sherlock's eyes. Clearly his friend had been dreading this moment, had probably hoped John would never find out, and just as clearly he didn't wish to talk about it.
And then he had been hopeless, once he had confronted the fact that he would never be allowed an outlet for his anger or any other sentiment strong enough to make it through the Silence and reach his consciousness.
John watched him in silence for a while.
"John!"
He kept a careful eye on Sherlock's face, ready to catch any change in expression that might tell him if the cook was right about him.
"Another one?" John asked, surprised. "That was quick."
And then he licked his lips.
He was halfway across the beach when John caught up with him, calling his name and grasping his wrist to pull him around. A moment later, Sherlock found his face framed by those achingly familiar hands and John was so close to him, staring him straight in the eyes.
Sherlock pretended to be very interested in watching some tourists pose for a picture with the London Eye in the background. "I have no idea what you're talking about."
"If you say so. I'm taking a shower. Again. I think I've got dust in places even a medical man wouldn't expect."
Sherlock does, though, and swiftly changes the topic to a fake Jack the Ripper case. Sally can't help but gasp when she learns that Anderson was the one who set it all up, trying to lure Sherlock out of hiding, still convinced he wasn't dead. It occurs to her that she hasn't spoken to Philip in a long time. He's back with his wife and since he quit his job they haven't really seen or heard from him. She wonders what he makes of Sherlock's return from the dead - if it helped him in some way. But she also knows she will never pick up the phone to ask.
"Yes," Sherlock said firmly. "He is."
Sherlock reacted the way he always did when he got overwhelmed by sentiment.
Sherlock swallowed. He knew she was right and he knew he likely wouldn't have any other choice anyway. Not now that he knew John had heard all that he had said to Rosie and to Mary. There was no coming back from that, no pretending it hadn't happened.
Finally, for the first time in over a year, John felt like himself again.
"No need to buy a ticket," Sherlock said casually. "I've got a membership. And it allows me to take a guest along to exhibitions."
John eyed the treat for a moment, sniffed at it and ate it off Sherlock's palm immediately. He wagged his tail in approval and Sherlock actually flinched as a wet tongue licked his hand in search for any morsels John might have missed.
"I'll do my best to keep everything intact," she said, giving him a glare. "But I would like to point out that I do in fact have a company to run and can't be expected to spend all day babysitting the accountants."
Sherlock grinned. "No, I think she really is."
"Perhaps I should tweet about this," Sherlock suggested as they passed the employee, clearly miffed. "
"What?" Sherlock demanded, now a little out of breath, possibly from the effort of not shouting.
What had he been thinking?
"My lips are sealed," Mr Hendriksen promised, and mimed locking his mouth and throwing away an imaginary key.
He knew the blatant claim spoke to John's tiger as much as the rest of him - he could feel John shiver in response and he heard it in the huskiness of his voice when he responded.
"You say that like you can schedule it," Sherlock mused. "That would be an extremely useful skill to have."
Which reminded him ... he glanced toward the Yarders. "Do you need to be here for this? I required you to make an introduction but this discussion is private. John would not appreciate your presence here."
"Not quite what I meant," John said pointedly. "You haven't slept at all since I was turned back, have you?"
Perhaps he would have been strong enough to attend the wedding, smile through it all and keep up the facade until after the whole thing was over and he could return to Baker Street and safely break down. But he didn't dare to risk it, not after the rehearsal and his sudden realisation that, given the opportunity to speak up or be forever silent, there was a good chance he would ruin it all at the last possible moment. He had never been good at keeping his mouth shut, after all.
"John... you can't ... you can't do this and then ... then... leave. Do you hear me? There's no going back. So if this is some kind of game, some sort of joke, we need to stop right now."
He returns her gaze steadily and finally says: "You have moved into 221c Baker Street."
"John!" Mrs Hudson exclaims, beaming. "You made it after all! How lovely! Hello, Mary."
"Ha. Good point," Sherlock conceded. "Not to worry, though. John will only turn lethal if anyone tries to do either of us harm."
Sherlock shrugged. “I ... don’t know.”
Mrs Hudson, in one of her usual emphatetic moments, hugged him.
"I thought you might throw a fit and demand a divorce for no reason other than that getting married
It doesn't matter. He plays beautifully and she feels stress seeping from her body, shivers running up and down her back as she finally relaxes into the sofa cushions and lets herself be swept away.
*****
And he would rather sew his own mouth shut than to tell John just why he would never ...
Sherlock made that noise again and abruptly turned around, burying his face in John's chest, his fingers letting go of the duvet to take hold of John's jumper instead.
"A lot of nonsense," Sherlock completed her sentence firmly. "What did you come up here for, anyway?"
Before his brother could formulate a response, the car rolled to a stop in front of the inn and their driver got out to open the door for Lestrade before moving around the car to load their luggage into the trunk. Sherlock had given the DI the keys to his and John's rooms with instructions to bring their belongings down. They had already packed this morning, anticipating to depart for London immediately after finishing up at Baskerville.
He leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Sherlock's throat, let his lips trail up and along his jawline, gently biting at any section of skin that caught his fancy.
He ran a hand through Redbeard's fur, trying to calm himself. It wasn't going to work, he knew. It had been three years since he and John had last been inside 221b together and there were too many unsaid things, too many painful memories clogging the air between them.
It was quite funny to see every head turn to Sherlock as he stepped out of the lift, and even funnier to see everyone's eyes move downwards to about dog-height before their expectation turned to badly concealed disappointment, quickly followed by surprise at the sight of John.
Sherlock felt his lips pull into a sympathetic smile and quickly wiped the expression off his face. John would mistake it for pity and hate it. He carefully set his mug down and leaned across the table to look John straight in the eye.
It clicked then, and John was quick to shake his hand. "Mike, of course! How are you doing?"
“A surprising turn of events,” Mycroft commented. “Poor John really can’t catch a break.”
He snorted and kissed her cheek. "No need to sound so surprised."
Sherlock had to look away before he replied, for fear that John would see more on his face than he wished him to. "Any time, John."
There was movement next to him that pulled him closer towards waking, increasing his awareness of his surroundings. Someone was there - someone warm and safe with sleep-loose limbs and hot breath ghosting across Sherlock's skin.
"No need to be a bully, John," Sherlock chided, turning his head to watch the soldiers run past.
He ignored the heads that turned in their direction as he and John exited the lift and marched to Lestrade's office - Perkins was scowling at his desk, clearly still miffed that John had not taken any orders from him. Sherlock considered giving John another treat for that one.
"If you manage to write it up properly for once," Sherlock said, forcing himself to keep his voice light and his expression pleasant even as everything in him screamed to get Mary out of the flat. This was nothing short of an intrusion in his territory and it made him bristle internally. He wanted her out.
"You look overwhelmed," Sasha noted and her voice was so warm, so full of compassion and kindness it sent a ripple through the room.
Something warm seemed to slide down John's throat and settle in his chest, a gentle glow. It would have been lovely if it hadn't tasted so sad with the taint of all that Sherlock very carefully hadn't said.
"Did you catch that?," Sally asks.
It wasn't said bitingly and he was correct, so Lestrade chose not to comment. "Got a bit of experience in trying to work things out, too," he said instead.
Of course not. John sighed, watching as Sherlock fumbled with the last remaining button.
"Oh, but you don't smell of anything, do you?"
"Not on purpose," Sherlock said. "But any strong emotion shakes my control over my telekinesis. Any larger emotional upset might cause a flare of my power and do untold damage. I cannot risk it and nor would many others."
"It appears to be both dead and featherless. It is also missing its head, which really wasn't conductive to experiments. And someone removed all the bones and inner organs and replaced them with ...stuff. It's an abomination, John! You should take it back to whomever you bought it from and make a complaint."
"You had that crease between your eyes that only appears when you had to deal with a bunch of patients who had no reason to be at the clinic in the first place," Sherlock said, carefully placing his violin back in its case.
“Do you want to go up?” John asked, nodding towards it.
He didn't much like being back at the Baskerville military facility, though. The scent of asphalt and uniforms, of oil and gunpowder and burlap, was associated with too many uncomfortable memories.
John turned to look at him. “You’ve got a favourite museum?”
*****
"Perhaps you should give it a try in a secure environment, then," Sherlock said. "We can frame it as an experiment."
Sherlock tilted his head and frowned at him. "I was not sure how you would take this, so I thought I would give you some time to adjust to living with a Psy before confronting you with-"
They sat next to each other at a small angle, looking in the same direction but turned towards one another all the same. One of them had been sipping his coffee while the other was engrossed in his phone. They had sat there for at least half an hour, not talking, just comfortable in each other's quiet company, and Sherlock had felt oddly reminded of himself and John for no discernable reason.
Sherlock averted his gaze and found himself studying the scratched surface of the table. “...he’s been sleeping in my bed,” he muttered, barely audible.
He glanced at his alarm. The glowing numbers proclaimed it was already gone two in the morning. He hadn't slept a wink. Great.
"Yes of course." Sherlock said calmly. "I've been told this is where wedding rings traditionally go. Where else would I put it?"
"Oh, I was just asking him if he liked breakfast," Mrs Hendriksen said, making a shooing motion. "Get going, the two of you, and thank you for your compliments, John."
The years and prolonged exposure to John have mellowed him. He finds himself playing childish games with Rosie, tucking away every laugh he startles out of her inside his mind palace where no one can ever take it from him.
They glared at one another across the sitting room.
"I'm right here," he assured him, patting his shoulder through the covers. "It's alright."
'," John quoted. "I have never heard you swear. Not once in all the years we've known each other. Not even when you stubbed your toe on the table in the sitting room."
Sherlock nodded. "That's why I insisted on false names. John is generic enough, but if Sherlock Holmes were to walk into this hotel, our killer would certainly realise I don't buy the police' explanation and am here to investigate. If he or she has any brains at all, they would make a run for it. Similarly, that they have not yet done so proves they are reasonably intelligent. Everyone accepted the hotel owner's generous offer, so if only one person were to leave, suspicion would immediately fall on them. Lying low is a far better option."
