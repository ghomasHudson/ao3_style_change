“Go inside and find Happy. He’ll take you home. I’ll figure out how to smooth things over with your aunt,” Tony said shooing Peter away.
Tony snorted while rolling his eyes to cover up the accuracy of that statement. “Like you would know how I conduct myself in business meetings.”
Tony’s fingers glided over the keys, creation filled the notes that drifted in the air. It was melancholy and sadness, but maybe that would answer Steve’s endless questions better than Tony was currently able to. When Tony listened he couldn’t help but wonder, what each note must be taking. What the price was in building up the melody for only his and Steve’s ears.
Tony was just within Steve’s striking distance when he stopped. Cocked his head to take in Steve’s stress free positioning. Steve had something on him. Correction, something more than the other night. Tony huffed out a breath. “Why are you here?” Tony asked more quietly, feeling more like he should have cleared out the entire state instead of half the compound.
He was still there. Wearing what looked too similar to the reconnaissance uniform Tony had made for Steve years ago, modified several times since then. All in black, he seemed to skulk within the shadows the city lights produced. He’d never seen Steve in here when the room was this dark. It would have been easy to chalk this up to imagination if it wouldn’t have been for the longer hair and beard going on. When Tony imagined Steve he was a clean cut thing of light.
The silence was deafening in its nature. Left Tony to interpret every thought Steve must be having of him. He wasn’t sure what Steve was after, but only a fool would believe that all was forgiven. That Steve had missed him as he said he would. Was here to bring him back to a team that was better served without him around.
Tony must be worse off for wear than he thought if Steve was now bartering with him about his sleep. He wasn’t the first to attempt it, but wearing what he was... It was too tempting an offer to refuse. “Yeah, alright. We can do that,” Tony agreed. “Stay in the tower in the meantime?”
“Hey, I’m just your neighborhood mechanic. Talks are for Captain America,” Tony said, with a sly smile. His fingers getting that itch in them again, but there was nothing to fiddle with.
“Sorry Mr. Stark. He snuck up on me.” Tony couldn’t imagine how Steve had snuck up on Peter who must have been slinging himself around different rooftops. Tony paused in his thought. Actually he could. He definitely could. It had probably not been when Peter was spying at all, but during reverse surveillance. After Steve had realize Spider-Man was keeping tabs on him, he’d waited until Peter had left, was less on his guard and caught him at another moment.
“We’ve got an Asgardian with abilities. Thor would tell us the abilities are based on science beyond our current tiny human mind’s comprehension. I’m going to call it like I see it and say it’s magic. The previous incident with the Asgardian resulted in what we’re going to refer to as an explosion, hitting about a sixteen-kilometer radius. The site remained active for twelve hours after the implosion. Anyone who entered the zone dead upon contact.”
Tony worked his jaw out of agitation. “He’s where?” The two words were ground out in a low sounding question. He’d thought he’d been on top of things these past few months, but was beginning to suspect his focus had been misguided. Tony wasn’t quite sure how he’d missed that. Had thought of Vision regularly leaving the compound as a sign of further growth. The evolution Vision had already undergone in such a short period of time were remarkable.
Steve groaned and put a hand to his head. “I think she’s given up hope. Rather... I hope she’s given up hope.”
“I think I just said that. The pleats, Cap, the pleats.” On anyone else those khakis would have been a complete disaster. Steve’s legs were nice enough that he could get away with it, barely… But when you looked as good as Steve you shouldn’t be barely getting away with anything.
“Can they clear the area before it reaches critical mass?” Tony could hear his blood rushing as his pulse picked up with the implications of what could happen, what would happen if he didn’t get there to stop it.
“They are continuing to clear civilians Boss. Officers have reported quadrants one, two, and three are clear. Quadrant four to the north is still in process of evacuation. Quadrant Five is mostly clear, they are waiting to hear back from a couple of their officers on final confirmation. Coast Guards have successfully cleared the area of all civilians on the waterfront. There are two unmanned boats in the area that were evacuated. There have been multiple reports from Coast Guards of a green glow emanating from the water.”
It was easy to think, but sometimes he could see Steve so clearly that it was as if he was in the room with him. Towering over him. That thick gaze of disapproval lighting into him like a match. He didn’t need to open his mouth to tell Tony that he should be doing more than drinking himself into an early grave.
Tony swallowed uneasily. Laid his hands, with all of their scars, callouses, and memories out in front of both of them. “She looked down at my hands told me they were made to create.” He could hear the words that had been uttered decades ago in his ear. The wonder there, the marvel in her voice that could turn Howard’s indifference into something almost obsolete.
Tony sighed heavily. Squeezed his eyes shut tighter. Helping Steve train the recruits? There wasn’t- He could do that. There wasn’t a lot that could go wrong there. He couldn’t forget about his goal when he started all of this. Redemption could take on many forms.
“Of course not,” Steve put in harshly while sidestepping Tony. Any chipperness gone. He smoothed out the lines of his bright blue shirt, a callback to the colors Steve had preferred when they all lived in the tower together.
Steve took in a shaky breath. Stared out at the landscape before nodding. “If that’s what you want.”
“If the patriotic frisbee wasn’t such a giveaway,” Tony continued, just wanting Steve to know that was the only reason. It didn’t matter what their personal feelings were, Tony would never have Steve in a disadvantage in a fight like this if it was avoidable.
Steve wasn’t interested in any dramatic build up most of the time. He didn’t see the world as a stage where you needed to have the audience wrapped around your finger before introducing the astonishing heartbreak of act two. Steve paired words while he unfurled his hands to showcase an item that said it all more clearly. Any words were drowned out in a rush with Tony only able to take in the colors swirling around his head. Red like… curtains, stoplights, suits or blood.
Peter looked pained at the idea of the impending doom that came along with breaking the terms of his grounding. That wouldn’t be a pretty conversation. Tony was sure to get another earful on top of it. A well deserved earful, but he couldn’t help but mimic Peter’s downcast face at his own near future.
“Our lack of mercy.” The green of her eyes seemed to shine brighter. “Amora, the Enchantress. I’m sure you’ve heard of me,” She said pushing her hair back, with more dramatic flair than was probably unnecessary. Still, Tony could appreciate the flair of it all.
“I want you. Fuck me. I’ll fuck you. I don’t give a fuck. I just want you.” Tony chuckled to himself. “Filthy? Give me half a chance and I’ll show you filthy.”
This is a much lighter chapter than the past couple as a break from the heaviness, but one of my favorite ones. We've got a bit of Irondad thrown in there too! Thank you to
Tony blinked up from what he had been soldering, not quite certain he’d heard that right. “Captain America, Captain Steven Rogers?” he asked for clarification while staring blankly at the tool in his hands.
“Tap another resource. This isn’t happening,” Tony said decisively, making it clear that Steve wasn’t going to be able to question this out of him. At least now he had a better understanding of why this was happening. For a moment Tony had allowed himself to believe this was all because of warped, misplaced jealousy. He should feel relief that it was an interrogation.
My biggest struggle with this chapter was the first part. I was afraid of things getting too campy with the past section, but I also felt that it was important. I think Christmas and just the month of December has a certain influence on Tony's psyche that was worth exploring a little. I hope you all agree!
“You shouldn’t be here.” He’d also communicated as much on the goddamn flip phone when FRIDAY alerted him to Steve approaching the premises. He’d had about fifteen minutes to clear any personnel from the less used back entrance. It wasn’t that Tony didn’t trust the SHIELD employees not to leak any of this back to the state government it was just- It was exactly that. If his time with Natasha had taught him anything spies were generally biding their time for a chance to stab you in the back.
“I don’t think I’m the crazy one here.” Steve had released Tony’s face only to trace his finger over where the blood was welling up. Tony jerked from the pain of it.
“I find that when people walk in with preconceived notions it’s helpful to know what they are. So why don’t you tell me, Rogers?”
for betaing this chapter. Seriously without betas all of my chapters would have 90% less commas. Thanks again for reading. Thanks also for all the kudos and comments.
“I always like to plan for any eventuality,” Steve responded conversationally. Drizzling the liquid onto his fingers. His other hand still working Tony over to the point that choked off moans were making their way from his chest. The thought of leaving quickly becoming a distant memory once again. The power Steve had over him was dangerous, now more than ever before.
"Hey Mr. Stark!” The back of Steve’s car popped open and out hopped Peter Parker. His excited expression turning nervous when he took in Tony pushing Captain America against the car. The only thing noteworthy about the car itself were the tinted windows that hadn’t allowed him to see Peter in the back to begin with.
The dread was relatively easy to push into the background; he had years of experience regarding prioritizing his emotions into the background. He did so while jogging to catch up with Steve. “Where do you think you’re going?” He questioned when he was within touching distance. He was feeling his age as the words came out with an utter lack of elasticity. It was his best command voice and still didn’t hold a candle to Cap’s.
“How did you know I’d be here?” It had been bothering Tony since the beginning. He’d not planned this ahead of time, in fact had decided on avoiding the place. He had Happy take care of every aspect of packing and moving so he wouldn’t have to think about it. The decision to come here had been impulsive.
If Peter was hurt what would he do? Don the suit and attempt to beat Steve into a bloody pulp? He’d travel to Africa this time and rethink every mistake that had led up to this moment? Even now he was making the mistake of trusting Steve to follow certain boundaries when he followed a completely different code than Tony did, one that allowed him to do whatever the fuck he wanted with his holier than thou brand of justification. Tony couldn’t believe the extent of this judgement of error he'd made. It had seemed like a good idea at the time.
Time to get this over with now that Tony had well verified that Peter was in one piece. No telling what happened prior to the assistance of rapid healing, but his high spirits made Tony come to the conclusion of not much. If anything, the kid probably found this to be one whole exciting adventure. Meanwhile, Tony was still recovering from what felt like could be a mini cardiac episode.
Only, Steve didn’t do empty words. No matter how cliched what came out of his mouth sounded, whatever Steve said he endorsed full heartedly. He was nothing like Tony who could come up with clever speeches that were designed to reach an end goal with perfect delivery. Steve didn’t have any goals when it was only the two of them down here in Tony’s lab talking where no one else could hear.
There wasn’t colder ice water in the world. They jumped apart like magnets of the same polarity. Steve had started for his clothes with quick military efficiency. Tony couldn’t help being thankful for the fact that he only needed to zip up his pants before running down the hall. His clothing was otherwise in a complete disarray, but that would hardly matter once he had his suit on over the ensemble.
“I’m sure not ruling it out,” Tony agreed, pointing at the screen now that Steve was standing next to him. Five of the humans were there, within five feet of the Asgardian. The other two were about ten to fifteen away. “What’s the word on the ground FRIDAY?”
“Oh what your spider senses didn’t-- What did you call it-  Tingle? By the way, we have to figure out a better word for that kid.”
Tony felt the edges of hysteria almost take hold of him when he saw the small compact bottle Steve pulled out. “You came here thinking you were going to get lucky?” he asked laughing even while the undercurrent of fury worked its way through him. Steve had brought lube to their first meeting after beating him to a pulp. Of course he had, this was par for the course wasn’t it? Tony felt the only real temptation to walk out of there since they’d started this.
“No reason.” Definitely not beard burns or rush of blood from the high you got over an idiotic decision.
“I’m not getting there until noon at the earliest Captain Rogers,” Tony responded back with a patented smirk. He’d be there after he consumed every hangover cure known to mankind.
It would have been more convincing if Steve hadn’t chosen that moment to come barreling down the hall, shirt in hand instead of covering the expanse of his chest. Face slightly flushed in a combination of annoyance and mild exertion. He pinned Tony down with a look that radiated disappointment, agitation and barely reigned in anger. Tony found his tongue tracing over his bottom lip reflexively.
It could be the beginnings of a panic attack. His anxiety making him hear phantoms of sound. When he looked up there would be nothing but the stranglehold on his throat left.
Tony snorted. “Cute.” He ignored the way his chest tightened when Steve zipped himself up. Turned on his heel. Prepared to walk away. The imagery wasn’t lost on Tony. Him on the ground. Broken. Steve walking away, acting like he was chased away. Like Tony actually had some kind of influence over his actions.
She gritted her teeth together, leveraging Tony with a calculating look. “Tell me do you settle, when you know you deserve more Mr. Stark?” Tony was starting to get where the name Enchantress was coming from. Her voice weaved around the openness of a beach, boxing everyone in. Tony could imagine falling into the trap, of feeling like he was the only person in the world and stepping closer and closer. “Women, money.” She eyed his suit, “Technology. I’ve been on this Earth long enough to find out what kind of man you are.”
“Information is limited, but patterns from the last occurrence suggests we have less than twenty minutes.”  He’d brought up the specs and had the same calculations before FRIDAY had a chance to speak them. That should be enough time for civilians to get clear of the area, if it weren’t for their penchant for stopping to gawk. Tony was rounding the corner while sending out a message to first responders in the area when he nearly ran into Rhodey.
“What way?” Tony asked biting, thinking. He’d still take a few hits if he called the suit before it got there. Worse case scenario would send him flying through the window, again. The suit should be able to catch him before he hit the ground. Tony doubted Steve was here to do something quite that homicidal, but he was not going to give him the benefit of the doubt either.
“I figured you’d say that,” she said, nodded her head. She turned to one of the humans, running a glowing green finger along his jawline. He leaned into the touch rather than away from her. “Jerry.” He nodded eagerly in recognition of his name. Tony prepared himself in case he’d wrongly assumed that the civilians were human. That had matched what he had seen on his monitor, but there was no telling if there were other humanoid creatures out in the galaxy with matching heat signatures. “Stab yourself.”
“Tell me to stop,” Steve challenged and waited, staring down at him. Tony felt more than a little awestruck at the crimson that proved Steve to be just as human as he was. Always felt that way upon seeing it, that, and a deep gut wrenching despair. Idols were not suppose to bleed. Were not supposed to fall. Were not suppose to hurt you.
“Stop.” Tony called out, the word echoing. Steve was more than halfway across the room. Tony’s sunglasses were just out of his reach. Just a slide of a hand and he’d be able to call a suit if needed. If Steve came any closer he could gain enough speed to crush Tony’s hand before he could do a thing. Uninstalling FRIDAY from the these floors of the tower had been undoubtedly premature. Not wearing a watch had been stupid. His phone was tucked in a jacket that had been cast aside onto a railing in the room. Too far to factor into any potential plans.
Tony actually laughed at that. At the idea that Steve even thought he could get past the encryption that could ground the planes for good. “I’d love to see you try.”
“Why spend four hours of your day driving for imaginary meetings when you could have a conference over the phone. Why don’t we get to what’s going on here Tony?” At least the softness was gone now, replaced with something… Less than steel, it was malleable but left Tony little room to slip away from.
That’s probably how he’d ended up in front of the piano. Growing up his mother had concerns for his well-roundness. The way he’d started to follow the employees of SI around like a well-trained dog on a scent that would take him many more years to learn was blood. It had always been blood and even when Tony thought he wasn’t following it anymore the trail still led to bodies. But before all of that, long before that, his mother had sat him down in front of a piano and drew shaky comparisons between music and science. How they had these blocks that you could build upon and if his hands could build missiles than why not symphonies?
Steve walked in looking, well only a way Steve could look. Helplessly suspended in time. Fashion choices seemed to be a jumble of different periods. Nothing was 1940s besides the hair, but Tony couldn’t be sure what was going on with the rest of him. He wanted to immediately tease Steve about it, but wasn’t sure how it would be taken. Sure, the guy had shook his hand upon leaving last time… But what else were you supposed to do after a teammate nearly died after falling from outer space?
On the third day Rhodey had joined him wordlessly. There had been no berating, punching, telling Tony how stupid he was or any of the negative reactions he'd been expecting. Just his best friend drinking with him until Tony figured out a way to live with himself. They would talk all about it in more detail. Later, Tony knew that, but for now having his friend there had felt like enough. This whole blocking-out-the-entire-world method never went particularly well for him: the current prime example being Steve in his driveway back dropped by a setting sun.
There was actually a lapse where neither Tony nor Rhodey said anything. Friends that knew each other for this long could communicate without a word. Tony hoped it would end there. That a look would be enough and that Rhodey wouldn’t actually put into speech what he was seeing.
“And you’ve checked in with FRIDAY this past week over my ‘health’ more times than Pepper and Rhodey combined. You don’t have anything to worry about Captain. This pseudo soldier is doing just fine.”
Both Peter and Steve glanced sharply at Tony. Peter struggling with an expression while Steve narrowed his eyes further. Tony shrugged, he called it like he saw it.
They didn’t need to be silent, but Tony didn’t turn to look and Steve didn’t say anything until he was close. He picked up the glass of white wine that Tony had put just out of his reach, leaning his hip against the side of the piano with a raised brow. “This doesn’t seem like your usual fair.”
Tony frowned. Not liking the confidence, slight lean inward or the downcast gaze from Steve. “Are you really flirting with me right now?”
The vibrations of a moan had Tony yanking his head back suddenly. It collided with the glass adding another low thrum into the mix of sensations forcing their way through his body. He looked up and all he could see was black in Steve’s eyes. Knew in that moment how doomed he was.
Tony couldn’t imagine a world without Steve in it. He couldn’t imagine leaving him frozen in the ice. Not looking for him harder. Or maybe the problem was that he could… In fact picture exactly that and couldn’t stand it.
“Honor to meet you. The strides you’ve made in science within your lifetime are truly inspiring. I’ve been reading up on it. I don’t understand most of it, yet, but from what I’ve gathered you have helped save a lot of lives. Your work with intellicrops alone is very impressive.”
“Mine is better,” Tony gasped. Wondering if T’challa had been the one to play dress up with Steve or someone else. “That is unnecessarily complicated.”
It was exactly what he wanted. “This is better than I’d ever imagined,” Steve growled, reading Tony’s thoughts allowed. His voice the cause of devastation.
“You have your mouth next to my dick. What else do you think I’m going to say?” Tony asked caustically with bated breath.
“I mean I didn’t start it. Howard did. Never mind this isn’t important,” Tony replied, quickly scrubbing his hands over his eyes to wipe away the tiredness. Steve’s expression had changed to that concerned one Tony was too use to. “What’s more important is your wardrobe Cap. What is happening there?”
“Rich in irony tonight I see. We didn’t need you. I didn’t need you, don’t. Get over yourself,” Tony responded looking away to the empty room again. The damage time could do was incomprehensible.
Tony had never become much of a composer when it came to the piano, but he was a good mimic. Not because he took any stock in his mother’s words about music and science… But he liked to see her smile. He liked that when his fingers pressed into the keys she’d sink into the armchair in the corner of the room. She’d sit down in the chair with a glass of wine, her eyes would close and she’d listen. Maria Stark would listen to him for hours playing other people’s masterpieces. How could he possibly resist the look of pride on her face when he couldn’t get Howard to sit and listen to him talk about his SI proposals for a single minute?
Amora’s smile turned into something sharper, the unease growing, and Tony kept himself on the edge of firing off. He could sense Steve getting just as tense beside him. “I was exiled from Asgard several of your lifetimes ago human. Watched it fall deeper and deeper into ruin under the old king’s rule. The king is gone to madness. The crowned prince is off gallivanting. The imposter can’t hold the throne… Not when I’m the one coming for it.”
“It’s not,” Tony said watching as Steve brought the glass to his mouth. “I wasn’t drinking it.” It’s annoying how much you could miss someone who wasn’t there. Sometimes he got out his mother’s classic hits, closed his eyes and the smell of her favorite vintage made him feel like she was in the room. Steve took a sip of it and immediately made a face that had Tony smiling despite himself. “Not your usual fair either?”
“Yes, really. Why are you here?” Tony said the words as firmly as he could. A voice he rarely broke out except in board meetings gone wild. Which let’s face it, if that were the case he was usually the cause.
Difficult to read him once again, but his hands were no longer in an open placating gesture. They were curled into fists that had the power of a wrecking ball behind it. Tony swallowed uneasily.
Tony was in therapy. Again. Hadn’t really left it but changed professionals a few times. Never really a right fit for his issues. How do you recover from falling out of a worm hole and not knowing how one would react if it happened again? How does one cope with being partially responsible for the many deaths of innocents? How do you handle Captain America exploiting your weaknesses, his shield crushing into your chest? How do you process him pretending to be your friend like so many others in a long line of traitors?
“What’s wrong with talking a lot?” Tony shot back. Less defensive and more spoiling for a pointless fight. Steve didn’t bring Peter all the way here just to say gotcha. That was an easy excuse and they were dancing around the real reason. Tony couldn’t tell yet if it was business, personal, or both.
“I’m scanning for heat signatures and it looks like the police did a decent job. Probably forty or so civilians within the perimeter, most are leaving in the correct directions. The majority of them would sustain little no impact from their current positioning. Blockades have successfully been set up. I’m only getting seven humans deep within the perimeter that would without a doubt result in fatalities…” Tony frowned, squinting at the screens he’d brought up. “They’re on the beach with the Asgardian.”
Tony found himself at the edge of gawking. Now Steve was complimenting him? Had he lost so much sleep that he was in a state of delusion? “Uh. Thank you,” Tony said while Steve gave him this big smile. “I uh-” Tony backed away from Steve, moving to another work area. “It’s uh-” He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this short on words.
Steve obliged him with a snort in return. “And here I thought I was about to see the man behind the mask.”
“Don’t go breaking commandments over me,” Tony muttered head bowed as he played back through the entire night and what led to here. He didn’t want to see what Steve looked like. How he was looking at him. Hadn’t even bothered to take off any of his stupidly designed clothes. “I need you to go.”
“Ha, bulky. There won’t be any restricted movement. The padding is frankly necessary with your inability to keep your feet on the ground. You’re lucky I’m not adding more padding to your ass as well,” Tony muttered to himself while taking a look at the arm’s section of the uniform.
Steve dragged a hand away from his hip, only needing one to keep up his punishing rhythm. Pulled at Tony’s curls hard instead. Tony responded by letting one of his hand trail underneath Steve’s shirt, what he could reach with the belted restrictions. Dragged his nails down as his palms felt the muscle. Hoped Steve would look at the quickly healing wounds and remember that Tony did this to him. Caused him to lose all control. Steve fucked into him hard enough that they reached a line where Tony wasn’t sure if he was more in pain or pleasure, just knew he loved every minute of it.
Tony gathered up all the access patience he had. “I think we went past flashy with the shield’s paint job Cap. It’s iconic, not flashy.” Tony pushed himself up to his feet, giving Steve another walk around to observe the changes he had made thus far.
for betaing this chapter and getting me back on track. Really, I’m not sure I would have been able to post this at all without their help.
“Thanks for offering. Again.” There was a teasing note there, an effort to lighten the conversation.
It took a moment for Tony to line that up, but he knew bait when he saw it. It didn’t stop him for walking right into Cap’s little trap. “Are you talking about my smoothies? You better not be. Those smoothies are great. Everyone loves them. You were the one that kept complaining about what I put in my mouth. You don’t get to complain after the fact too.”
“I didn’t grow up with my name in the media. I don’t expect everyone to know everything about me when I’m having a conversation with them.”
Tony was already blasting up from the sand, muttering a series of curses under his breath as he went. Steve running in the direction. “All five of you humans. It would please me greatly if you died right here on this very sand. Let’s call it a mark of your service to me. Get to it.” The first man was on his knees, the knife still embedded in his upper abdomen. The knife being held in place was the only thing keeping the blood from flooding out of the newly formed cavity. The pain of the first action slowed him down from yanking it back out.
“What happened wasn’t all on you. Whatever Maximoff made you see, you weren’t right after it. You still aren’t. I should have done something about it sooner.” It wasn’t true. The potential of what had happened had always laid there in wait. Tony didn’t know how to live life and not be a little reckless. His experiments were a run of trial and error. Rushed to perfection when the only one at risk was himself, only this time it went much further than himself.
“So that’s what you are here for, a fight? Going to make me get up from the ground and everything aren’t you? Put on the suit he tells me.” Tony mocked with a half grin on his face.
Tony could understand parts of it. He was never one for the present though. His mental faculties had trouble slowing down enough to appreciate a moment. It was always in the future. To what was next. To what was bigger and had to be better than the current reality they lived in.
The notions felt too romantic, when this was a far thing from that. This was a new form of war against each other. Tony could feel the tallies racking up when Steve slipped his fingers free. Let the air fill the spaces between their mouths once again. He felt so empty and had a preview of what it would be like when this was done. Wanted to chase that feeling away as quickly as he could with more. More of Steve.
“I appreciated all of your help this week,” Steve finally replied. It was a clear segue, so Tony continued to wait, see where Steve was planning on driving this conversation. He’d been waiting for months now. For Steve to lose it and layout all the blame for Sokovia squarely on his shoulders, where it belonged. It was already there, waiting to be pointed out.
Steve had stepped into Tony’s imaginary perimeter of too close for comfort. Tony didn’t hesitate on making a side dive to where his glasses lay. Using his right hand to fling the contents of the bottle in the direction he expected Steve to come at him from. None of his movements were nearly fast enough. He had a finger brushing against a frame when a hand curled around his wrist to slam it up against the glass window behind them. The other knocked the bottle so it spun across the floor spraying liquid everywhere it went.
Tony blamed his misstep on his alcohol to blood ratio. “So that’s what you want me for? To get to work in the kitchen? How forties of you Steve, I’m absolutely charmed.” Tony exaggerated with fluttering his eyelashes toward Steve while Steve rolled his eyes.
“We’re busy planning Tony’s coming out party,” Rhodey remarked.  Steve hadn’t slowed his pace to match theirs, just shook his head at them and kept walking. A loosening in the tension between his shoulders the only sign part of him was either amused or pleased by Rhodes comment.
“Shit,” Steve uttered and Tony didn’t even feel the need to mock chide him over the swearing. There was still the surprised thrill despite everything else. “I’m sorry Tony. I should have let Rhodes come here instead. I-” The number of aborted sentences that had gathered in this conversation were growing uncomfortably large. Steve didn’t try to say anything else to that, a silent agreement to let that line of conversation die.
“What did you do?” came out of his mouth. Halting on each word, dropping his voice to a menacing tone. Threatening and clenched teeth. Hand wound around the front of Steve’s shirt, pulling the stretchy material tighter. He didn’t know what he’d do if Steve had actually managed to hurt the kid, but he’d gotten close enough that the Spider-Man mask was wrapped around fingertips that were capable of ripping logs in half.
“Yes, however will he narrow it down with your first name and face?” Tony called back shaking his head and rubbing his fist against his eye. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”
and my dear friend Demiguise for betaing this. They are both absolutely wonderful! I hope you enjoy and comments are always appreciated.
Tony debated crawling across the room to figure out if there was anything left in the spilled whiskey bottle. Maybe lick it straight off the floor. “I don’t like you. You don’t like me. We had sex. Now we are not having sex. Conversation over.”
“I’d have destroyed the arctic, traveled the galaxy, gone to different dimensions, all to find you.” It was a confession, but Tony made it sound like a haughty declaration.
I wanted to end the year with a bang by posting a chapter of TSBU. I hope you all enjoy it. (I also promised myself I wouldn’t leave rambly paragraphs in the author’s note section, the restraint I’m showing in enormous.)
Steve extended his hand. Tony took it. “Take all the time you need, but don’t cut us out. We need you.” This time when Tony was pulled to his feet he found balance easier to keep. “Let’s get you to bed.”
Tony frowned behind his mask. “That does make the most sense.” And it did. Tony could remove people from the blast zone much more quickly than Steve would be able to. “Without your shield, I’m not sure if-”
“Hey, Tinkerbell. I’d say welcome, but I’d rather tell you to pack it back to Neverland.” Tony stepped onto the beach, aware of the figure trailing to his left like a particularly intimidating shadow.
“Romania. With Maximoff. They think they are flying under the radar, but-” Steve glanced over to Tony’s growing expression of annoyance. “Perhaps it isn’t as obvious to everyone else.”
Tony didn’t know what he was looking for at the bottom of these bottles, but he was going to keep drinking until he found it. Until all the pieces that made up the world made sense and he finally knew how to save it.
Tony shifted on his knees in front of Steve running a hand down his left leg in a soft, fleeting touch.
Tony shrugged like he didn’t care at all. That it didn’t matter that Steve was the first person who had known his father and hadn’t outlined all of their similarities and then the ways Tony was lacking. “You never talk about yours either. I mean never as in never. Not even in the passive aggressive way I bring up mine.”
“Think I said that Cap.” Tony tried to not let anything telling into his own voice. Trying not to show how shaken he was by hearing that voice. One that couldn’t seem to leave his thoughts or dreams. He should be attempting to determine the level of hostility present without riling Steve up. “Oh right, should probably figure out a new nickname. Not exactly Captain America anymore are you?”
“You always do it better, don’t you?” Steve whispered against Tony. Tony was fairly certain it wasn’t a compliment, but couldn't find it in himself to care. The parts of him that cared about what Steve thought of him had frozen themselves into nothingness in Siberia.
Tony nodded slowly, taking another sip of coffee before placing the mug at the edge of his desk. He never was really sure where there conversations would turn to. He felt torn between finishing the suit and listening to Steve talk about the good ole’ days. Tony did his best to multitask between the two.
“Oh, let him up then.” Tony put the tools down, wiped soot off his hands and gave himself a once over. It wasn’t great. He hadn’t slept in a couple days and he knew it had to be reflected in his hair and face. The shirt he was wearing had coffee stains and creases in odd places. Tony tried to smooth that and his hair out before Steve Rogers could arrive.
“Worth it,” Tony muttered, closing his eyes and reopening them. Expecting Steve to be gone, but he’d only moved closer. A dawning thought began to sink into him. “Oh, you’re real aren’t you?”
Steve audibly cleared his throat. “For what?” The words were unnaturally tight, but Tony was already elsewhere. Already concentrating on a different variety of tones.
“I tried to do more. I tried to do what you asked.” There was shame in having stepped away. He wasn’t giving up, but he was better suited behind the scenes than on the battlefield. Time had shown him that. How many times would he put the lives of the people he cared about on the line before he’d understood that the world was telling him the most he could do was stop pretending to be a savior and stay put in his lab?
Tony’s eyes cut sharply to the side. “Well, I just miss the one man act days so much,” he drawled, resuming his brisk pace down the hall. In reality, he wasn’t willing to risk SHIELD agents when the tech he’d come up with to combat the foreseen energy blast could only be fully tested out in said combat. He wasn’t willing to put someone’s life on the line for a test run. Vision would be the ideal one to send out for this fight, even if the counter energy shields Tony had come with failed, vibranium should be able to take the hit with minimal damage to his person. Only one problem, “I don’t know where Vision is.”
“You don’t want me to take this seriously because then I would be forced to do something about it.” Smile sliding off his face. Chin jutting out in defiance at this captain of his. Don’t make me do it running through his mind.
“I wouldn’t be asking if there was nothing to worry about.” Tony shrugged, not bothering with a reply. It was a few steps below an argument, but he knew that for every reply he gave Steve he’d come up with something else. Another reason.
“The beard is not a good look Rogers.” A lie. Look away and upon returning there would be nothing. Nothing but your memories left. “Didn’t you know I have the market on facial hair?”
“Which brings us back to why you are here and I know it wasn’t to bring Peter over so you could rub your knowledge of him monitoring you in my face. So let’s skip past that.”
She smiled. The woman had the Asgardian tone of superiority down pat. On Thor it was endearing, Loki exasperating, here… Something unnerving.  “Do you know the difference between a god and a goddess?” She questioned taking a step towards them. Tony didn’t hesitate in raising his arm, repulsor glowing with an unreleased charge.
“Start over?” Tony asked looking up into blue eyes that appeared as earnest as the sun was bright. He blamed his heart picking up on fear. It was the easiest emotion to own up to in that moment.
“I was under the impression that the alarm still meant we assemble,” Steve said giving them both one of his more sterner expressions. Tony was under the impression that clothing wasn’t an optional part of said assembly, looked like they would both be reeling from new found revelations.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut. When he pulled away his arm this time, Steve let him. It was infuriating that he only had control over his own body at the whims of another person. But, Tony had been afflicted with that problem long before Steve’s hands had gotten anywhere near touching him.
Tony’s original question had melted away back into the depths of his mind. Another one, an older one stood out in contrast in its stead. “I keep offering to help you find Barnes and you never let me. Why?” Tony pushed himself up to his elbows to watch Steve’s reaction. Steve was much closer than he’d originally thought. Their legs only an inch away from brushing.
Hi guys! I hope you enjoy this chapter, I promise much more Steve in the next one! I saw Avengers Infinity War (opening night >_<) and just wanted to restate that there will be no spoilers for that movie in this fic at any point. It in fact contradicts the movie at a certain point, but is canon compliant up until that movie. Thank you to the lovely and amazing betas who edited this chapter for me
“I wanted to see you.” Tony could feel himself working past fear and into the anger he saw in the face of an enemy. Let it grow in him, partially hoping it would swallow him whole.
Steve used his free hand to tug Tony’s head back, exposing his throat. He bit down on the sensitive skin there. Tony cried out when Steve continued lower. Mixing the sharpness of teeth with sucking bruises into his skin. Upon reaching the collar of Tony’s shirt Steve moved his hand there. Ripped it clean down the center.
This Steve hadn’t moved since he’d first said Tony’s name. Seemed stunned into silence. Was waiting for something.
“Yeah, getting unnecessarily tossed into a building will do that to a guy.” Despite Tony’s protest’s Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulders. Tony wasn’t going to thank him for the help he’d denied. Even if there was denting in his metal alloy that was digging uncomfortably at several spots in his body, his left ankle in particular. Nothing was broken. He’d just have more bruises to contend with than he’d like.
She stiffened before continuing “Well, Thor must have said something.” Her voice trailed over his name with a particularly strong focus.
“Thank you. I’m headed to Washington in a few weeks, but if I could stay here in the meantime that would be great.”
He could feel Steve’s ragged breaths turn into throaty sounds. Tony couldn’t clearly remember a time he'd seen Steve breathing this hard. Steve pulled himself out slowly, letting Tony feel every inch before thrusting back in. The strokes were tentative, testing. Too cautious for what Tony wanted, despite the relief of having Steve there. He didn’t want gentle with Steve mouthing kisses along his jugular. It left too much room for him to be overwhelmed with emotion. Left spaces for caring and sweet nothings to come fill.
“Hello mortals,” said the Asgardian in the middle. She’d immediately stood apart from the others, before figuratively, now literally as she broke rank and stepped past the humans she’d been using as a shield. “Iron Man,” the woman said in an additional greeting. “Now this is the kind of welcome I’ve been waiting for.” She had the otherworldly quality that Asgardians carried with them. Green silks and gold plating not of this world and also a little too sparse for the cooling weather. Even from across a field of sand Tony could pick up the green of her eyes, the hypnotic quality that had him wanting to step closer wasn’t natural, part of something more that was going on in this scene.
“Sure,” Tony said immediately, like he actually had a choice in the matter. It was a nice offer, though Tony had his doubts about how long they would stay cordial. He could honestly say that when he started today this had not be anywhere near his radar.
“I will always be there for the team. I will always be there to help them, I owe all of that to all of you. To the world. Everything else, I’m working on it, Steve. When I was feeling…” Guilty. Devastated. Suicidal. “This way. I’d get reckless. Reckless has only hurt more people. I’m not doing that anymore,” Tony took in another deep breath. “I’m going to work on it.” He was going to get better because that’s what he did.
“In all the wrong ways. What are you doing here Steve?” Tony couldn’t not grin in the face of this absurdity. A confused manic hysteria had it’s claws deeply embedded into his bones. It was disaster and end of days and he caused it all, he was humanity’s downfall. He had long since stopped being a merchant and was freely giving death away.
Tony turned quickly, repulsors first preparing for a strike. That wasn’t why Steve had asked Tony to look. The waves were lapping aggressively at the shore as the self-proclaimed Enchantress walked across the water top. A strengthening green aura pouring from her and into the water below, all of slinking towards a concentration of the same color farther out from shore.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked. Most likely not because of the words themselves, but because of how they had been said.
Tony could pretend he had. Fake drunkenness. Use it to his advantage when Steve let his guard down. “Just thinking about it. Have all these new responsibilities with you gone. Weird kid keeps hanging around. Good influence, you know the drill. Sorry, did know the drill.”
Steve held himself against Tony’s entrance. Tony swallowed uneasily. Yeah, he had done things like this before, but never anything quite that long or thick. Swallowed again because he didn’t want to drool over the image in front of him. “Is this okay?” Steve asked not moving.
“Only one way to find out Cap.” He picked up speed, giving Steve a quick head turn to confirm he had both Asgardians incapacitated before heading straight for Amora. She’d stopped her walking and had placed herself in the middle of a widening green circle. The energy levels he was picking up were climbing past what FRIDAY was comfortable with him being near, as she let him know with updated stats and a warning to clear the space.
“I’m not rejoining the team Rogers,” Tony ground out the words more clearly, stronger than he had previously. He could feel genuine annoyance starting to seep in.
“And you have a filthy mouth. Look where that lands us.” Steve had ducked his head but Tony knew he was smiling. Knew it and hated him for it. How was it that Steve could still smile and laugh with such ease while he sat there in a particular form of torture? He went back through his mind to the number of times he’d thought about painting Steve’s smile with his come. Came back with an astonishingly high number that had another addition to it.
Steve stopped walking and had to tighten his grip on Tony’s shoulder to keep him from falling into the wall. Tony was drowning under that gaze and stern expression. It said, you’re the genius isn’t it obvious? It said, he already knew the answer to his own question, but Tony was only drawing blanks.
Tony knew immediately that this was going to be quick and rough. All the way from the prep to the fucking. Couldn’t have asked for anything more. Dug the blunt curve of his nails into Steve’s bicep when he introduced the first finger. Drizzling lube over Tony’s hole as he pushed it in past the first ring of muscles. Steve was rubbing his clothed cock against Tony’s leg, the one that didn’t have fabric covering it anymore. The desperate rutting would have broken any illusions left. Tony pushed back against him, wanting Steve to push harder. One finger became two. There was still blood welling from Steve’s bottom lip.
This time when he pulled away Tony managed to find words. “You’re fucking crazy,” was all he could get out. Steve was still watching his mouth, now a mirror of each other.
“Oh? Better than the outside then?” Tony asked looking up and trying to inject humor. It fell short of the mark. Steve had insulted his tower their first go round, how gracious was Tony expected to be?
Natasha had her arms folded across her chest with an expression of intimidation that could put Steve’s to shame. “Having fun boys?”
And that was the problem. Thrill seeker he was. Always had been. Before Iron Man there had been extreme sports. During, villains... and now there was this. The challenge that he always wound himself up to meet.
“I wasn’t asking about me,” Tony said, still not putting his arm down. He was getting tempted to fire a blast off on principle. This wasn’t heading anywhere good. The two Asgardian men behind her had weapons at their sides, one a broadsword and the other a spear. You didn’t walk up on a beach packing that and expect to get out without a scuffle. He still would have a better idea of how to approach this if he knew what she was after. Amora was a talker, no harm in letting her talk.
Tony snorted. How much bravado can a Stark muster? A whole world’s worth. If you pretend not to be broken long enough reality will come to heel. Come to heal you into what you’ve convinced yourself to be. “Bigger monsters out there,” Tony lied. Not that it wasn’t true to the world, but it wasn’t true to him.
“FRIDAY, talk to me.” He debated having the suit come to him, but in the scheme of things it wouldn’t it wouldn’t make a big enough time difference. The short walk was needed to clear the remnants of stray thoughts he was experiencing.
“I know old fashion guys like you don’t move that fast,” Tony quipped dryly before he could help himself. “This device hasn’t been tested, but it should be tripped in reaction to the heat signature of the energy blast we are expecting to incur while in the field today.”
“I’m just about done with the suit if you want to take a look.” Tony said hurriedly pointing back to the projected image of it. Anything that would constitute as a distraction.
“Not an Avenger,” Tony muttered. “He’d get into more trouble if I wasn’t around. I think. We’ll see. Big fan of yours though,” Tony said as Steve walked back out of the light. Not closer, but edging around a perimeter Tony had made up in his mind. One that Steve appeared to be aware of.
“Spider-Man Steve. Man.” They both gave each other a look. Steve laughed. Tony would have three months ago. Worked to keep his mouth in an impassive line now.
Tony tried not to feel offended. “Yeah, okay. I’m not dressing you to look like me, don’t worry. You couldn’t pull it off. We’ll go all sporty or something. Uh we’ll see. Just not this.” Tony gestured at the shirt which appeared to be channeling the 70s. The worst parts of the 70s.
Tony looked over at Steve, trying to tamp down the urge to be haughty or defensive. “Well, all of your stories about Vision ignoring the idea of privacy and going through the walls has made the idea so tempting.”
Steve stuck his hand out. “I’m Steve Rogers. You may know me as Captain America.” A teasing nature to the words.
Perhaps the best thing Tony could do was what he’d already done: get the hell out of their way. He didn’t sell and trade in death anymore, but it still seemed to follow in his wake. He had a reaper on a weak chain, one where it slashed and cut at anything near. The only answer was that the remnants of the team needed to be well and far from him. Where his destruction couldn’t reach.
“I’m fine Mr. Stark. You don’t need to treat me like a kid, really.” Peter’s eyes ricocheted between the two of them, wide-eyed curiosity vibrating from every pore.
Tony had been told that he’d learned to invent before he’d learned to walk. He’d grown up in his father’s workshops and those of SI all throughout childhood. Tony may have some grievances for how his childhood went, but he could never completely begrudge the inanimate objects that had come to surround him like family. That had made him into who he was just as much as he had made them into what they were. Science, mechanics had become a safety net. A place to fall back to, a place that he could come out of with something bright and new that could impact the world in a different way than before.
“Then leave. You don’t belong here anymore. Moreover you aren’t welcome here anymore,” Tony replied indicating the door.
“Can I get what Steve just said put in my private servers. I’m going to need it to play back at him at every opportune moment.”
Tony put his hand over Steve’s mouth. Not wanting to hear another word of it, afraid of coming too quickly if he did. Steve brought a finger into his mouth, thrusting harder because of it. Tony gasped at the sensation of Steve’s tongue sliding over it as he pounded into him. Steve bit down. Tony cried out and retracted his hand quickly before more damage could be done. Before he wanted more damage done.
Footsteps echoed through the room. No more a stranger than they had been when they entered. Still, Tony pretended not to know the man, ignored the longing the sound caused in the cavity of his chest.
The laughter abruptly cut off. Steve reached for Tony’s arm before the suit could adhere to him. “No, you’re not.”
“What the hell is going on here?” Tony questioned more to himself, making his way over to the civilians.
Tony held his breath. It felt more intimate than sex, Steve’s hand on his armor. Steve looking into the slits of a metallic mask and seeing him in all of his entirety. Tony wondered what images where playing through Steve's mind. Tony wondered if he realized that this was proof that it didn’t matter if Steve broke him. Again and again and again. It didn’t matter because he could build himself back to this every time. No matter how many times, until his last breath he could build a better, stronger armor.
Steve surprised him by blushing. His cheeks highlighting in the low lights of his apartment. Tony turned away as well when he found his face getting a familiar heat behind it. He had nothing to be embarrassed about but found himself rambling anyway.
”It’ll produce a magnetic field that is- Think of a magnet of the same polarity and how they- It’s a forcefield,” Tony finally settled on. “When this lady sets off the big old green bomb, it should be able to take some of the hit. Enough that you’ll survive it.”
“Would I?” Tony turned to better face Steve, a challenge in his voice. Watching as Steve held himself taller, in that righteous way of his. The way of a man who knew without a doubt that he was right. How lucky would it be to be Steve Rogers? To get rid of all the doubt acting like an anchor on his insides.
Tony blinked away from the widening hole that was rippling out like a whirlpool in the water around them. “I tend to bring them with me,” he said. Firing off not only the repulsors in her direction but a series of compact missiles. A concentration of the green aura flared around her palms as she merely batted his attack with a simple movement. It was in that second Tony knew he was screwed and didn’t have enough time to unscrew himself from the situation.
“I think it’s cute.” Tony knew if he looked at Steve, he’d be smiling. He had enough restraint not to look, ignoring the pull in his stomach.
“Before that, but during as well. I made a lot of snap judgements about you and that was wrong of me. Given what I know now I’d take back various things I said if I could. Short of that I’d like to wipe the slate clean if you are open to it.” His voice was so official sounding. Tony wondered if he recited these things and practiced before coming up here or if the compelling delivery of the words was just something Steve did naturally with ease.
“You’ve got me Tony,” Steve managed with more deadpan Tony thought possible until that moment. It’d been weeks since a genuine smile had curled around his face. It took only a second for it to wipe back off. Happiness in any form it took wasn’t deserved. Didn’t feel right anymore.
Tony closed the distance between him and the two closest to him. They were tumbling at the ground, each trying to get their hands around the other’s throat in an unorganized heap of limbs. Tony picked them both up by the front of their skulls together hard enough that they instantly slumped in hands.
Tony did a slow smile and listened to the words. Maybe the problem had never been his recklessness, but the way he isolated himself. It was possible, but the idea of being around others in a more personal way than work, the idea of leaving himself open to their true thoughts. He was too open right now. He needed time to build a different variety of a shell around himself.
He did a slight hand motion toward the suit. Only the slightest change in the air an indication that it was seamlessly closing in around him. There were no metallic clicks, just the armor sliding into place along his body like it had always belonged there. It made a distant tower in a city full of them seem distant. This was coming home, this is what destiny and fate felt like. He curled and uncurled his fist, metal following along with the movement.
“Who is it? Who did you just think of?” Tony pressed when he felt Steve had been left alone with his thoughts long enough.
Steve laughed, but it was the scripted variety more for Tony’s benefit than anything genuine. “You should probably have a talk with him about that.”
He strode over to the next to the one on his way crawling to where a knife had ended up in the sand. He was making considerable progress given that the last man was biting at his ankle. Tony made a face at that. “If you two can’t play nice,” he chided, before sending them both into unconsciousness as well. He raised an arm, letting FRIDAY lock into his targets, effectively sending a repulsor blast at one of Steve’s opponents. The shot itself wasn’t high impact, but the moment it took the Asgardian to recover it was already over for him. A series of jabs and uppercuts from Steve that Tony knew from experience was going to hurt come morning.
If anything, Steve looked more uncomfortable than when Tony had first broached the subject of his love life. Tony knew better than to press like this. Steve got cagey when you talked about that or the past for too long. Now they were talking about a mixture of both. Still, every piece of new information he discovered felt like his first major scientific discovery.
The green had laced into the water itself, they weren’t too far from the shoreline, but the water was deeper than expected. Tony could only tell the depth from where the water appeared to be concaving on itself. A tunnel of empty space leading towards the embankment that should have been all rocks and sand. Instead, there were glowing patterns down there that reminded him of the kind Thor had a habit of leaving across his lawn.
Tony had been reaching for the remnants of coffee when he knocked the mug right off the table. He blinked, turning to Steve. Steve stared back with a concerned smile. Tony flushed, realizing he’d dumped coffee all over the floor. “Dum-E can you please?” Tony ran his hand through his hair glancing back at Steve. His heart was pounding and he knew Steve could hear it and wasn’t that worse somehow? That Steve knew his secret. That someone like Steve believing in someone like Tony meant everything to him. That it could cause his brain to short circuit because he’d never thought of that as a possibility. It felt a little bit like someone handing you the world and that was ridiculous. “You wouldn’t believe the amount of money SI spends on coffee mugs,” Tony joked, looking back to his work hurriedly.
He wasn’t attempting to be quiet, this intruder on Tony’s goodbye. He could be. When he wanted to. Turn all that weighted muscle into something silent. Something dangerous. It didn’t obey the laws of physics how he chose to move sometimes. No quiet now, wanting to be heard. Sure footsteps of a soldier. Radiated confidence and a stubborn nature Tony was too familiar with.
Steve’s mouth turned up and brows raised. The implications of the answer being obvious was portrayed. His amusement over what Tony had missed clear. “Odds were in my favor.” Tony rolled his eyes. “I think the real question is why you came knowing I’d be here looking for you.”
“What’s your answer Tony?” Steve’s arms were folded over his chest again, fingers digging into his own flesh instead of Tony’s. Which is how it should be. The domineering and threatening aura dripping from Steve like the arrogance Tony was constantly accused of. It was a perfect reminder of everything Tony hated about Steve and how he needed to be careful. Much more careful than he had been in the past week because Steve’s moods swung as easily as the weather. You thought you had your predictions down until a sunny day became a thunderstorm. Tony was never braced for lightning at the right times.
Steve was smiling and there was nothing warm about it. Still, Tony was drawn to it like there was fire not ice. Like if he touched Steve he’d be consumed by him. He hoped to be burned alive because then there would be no more tomorrow. Just this moment where nothing was more complicated than how quickly you could get skin back on skin.
Tony let go of Steve who was gazing down at him with a carefully constructed blank expression. Only a flash of faked anguish and confusion before it had been wrapped under hard unreadable layers.  “Are you hurt kid?” Tony asked tiredly, skipping past relief and right into bone tired exhaustion. Teenagers were more than what Tony’s psyche felt he could handle at the moment.
“What’s the difference between a day and a week for a man on the run? I don’t see any timer running Rogers.”
“I’ll be fine on my own.” Tony pushed open the door to outside. They were on a launch pad decorated with a few of their smaller aircrafts. The suit hovered enticingly in the air. The shining red and gold alloys its own kind of siren's call. It was only a matter of time before the two of them ended up broken apart on the rocks together. Tony had a gut feeling that today would not be that day.
“Because that went so well last time.” Steve was baiting him and Tony couldn’t help but take it. Part of him missed these moments while the rest loathed every minute of it.
“Always so adamant here Cap,” Tony turned his head away, studied the lack of patterns on a white wall. He couldn’t remember why he preferred muted tones anymore.
Tony wanted to lick it clean but wasn’t in the right position. Reclaimed his hands in Steve’s hair so he could do so. Kissed him until it was three fingers and not two. Every slide of the digits had nerve endings crackling, Tony scrambling closer, thrusting down for more. Tony had done this before, not with men, but before. Could measure Steve’s inexperience and how much it didn’t matter. His fingers reached places he was certain never existed until Steve had chosen to touch him. Perhaps had existed all along but had been waiting only for him.
Tony could do nothing but wrap his legs around Steve’s waist, feel the full impact of the cold glass against his back. The coolness drawing nothing from the intense heat of Steve’s body against him. He was practically fully clothed and how unfair was that? The pace Steve set had completely changed. His fingers were digging into Tony’s hip dragging him up his length before letting gravity take over. Letting Tony fall on Steve’s cock over and over again.
It’d use to be a place of comfort. Now the idea of fiddling at his workshop made him cagey. Where he’d been confident, he couldn’t help but second guess every decision. Tony entered his lab and some days he walked right back out. Other days, he stood in front of the tools that had made his Iron Man suits and felt an itch in his hands that he wouldn’t allow himself to scratch.
An ongoing problem as of late, he’d kept continuing his disappearing act. At this rate Tony was actually going to have to put surveillance on the guy. It felt like the board had been flipped around and Tony was in charge of keeping track of all the pieces. Right then, he would much rather be swiping them all onto the ground.
Steve Rogers was completely genuine when he said he believed in Tony Stark and Tony didn’t know how to cope with that kind of pressure. He only knew that it set his blood racing.
If he were just one tenth of a percentile less drunk than he was, this would be embarrassing, Humiliating, doubt provoking. That hardly mattered when he was this drunk. It gave him permission to say the words out loud he’d always been thinking. His thoughts were distorted and disconnected in the way everything that had ever bothered him was joined together.
Tony looked down at himself. At his scars and heaving chest. Back up to Steve who had straightened and was staring at him with the kind of reverence reserved for deities. Tony knew then that Steve would tear him apart searching for the answers only a body could give. Take him to pieces to figure out the truth of this. Tony would let him, help him, because he’d wanted this for as long as he could remember. Lied to himself about it into the ages. There was no more room for that, no more air left to breathe a single word of contradiction.
“Haven’t had time to send out invitations yet. Promise I’ll send you one,” Tony lied. “So no need to come hunt me down.” He plastered a media worthy smile on his face even as his legs trembled. Wouldn’t it be simpler if that were the extent of it? Steve condemning his and Pepper’s relationship. Tony could handle that. Couldn’t handle much more at this point.
“Hey,” Steve paused. “Mr. Stark,” he continued hesitatingly. The uncertainty would have relaxed Tony if he wasn’t wired with so much coffee. “I’m actually here to see you.”
“Stop saying my name.” Tony let his face rest in his hands. Tried to wipe away any emotion there before bringing his head back up.
“Never thought you would look at me that way.” Steve had come to an open abrupt stop. Body looking statuesque. The control he had over it was absolute.
“Funny, but incredibly reckless. It really works in our favor if the Secretary of State doesn’t know we are attempting to make backroom deals as conversing with you like this is currently very illegal. So I’m a little confused as to what you are doing here.”
Tony really should have expected it, but was still cursing at Steve when he decided to bypass the zipper. Instead, tearing one of his pant legs to get the fabric off of him and gain easy access. Tony hadn’t been wearing anything underneath, could see the approval on Steve’s face.
“My suit is designed to fly. There is a reason my feet aren’t on the ground,” Tony said automatically, really paying more attention to the work involved in creating Steve’s uniform over their back and forth exchanges.
, “- wont ask again.” He could already tell that he’d regret this conversation in the morning, but it was minuscule compared to everything else Tony wanted to take back. Steve wouldn’t hold tonight against him.
Instead, Steve sat down on the piano bench. Knees knocking into Tony’s with a playful cadence. “I thought you had your own quarters at the new facilities.”
A long pause on Steve’s part. Searching eye contact as he tried to come up with words. Whatever Steve saw caused him to look away once more. “You’re an idiot.”
“Why is your face all red? You seem out of breath are you feeling okay?” Rhodey asked, his face screwing up as he squinted at Tony’s facial hair. Tony brought his hand up to his face, less to figure out what was there and more to shield Rhodes from looking any closer. If he were about twenty-five years younger he’d be turning red. As it was instead, he shrugged.
Steve didn’t like Tony’s word choice. Easier to tell now that he’d been basked in the beams of other buildings. There are green in those eyes. Somewhere, despite their blue brightness. He was being careful not to spook. Holding his hands out like they weren’t weapons.
The dialogue had been born of repetition, words they’d said to each other a dozen times before. Now, it was comparable to having shrapnel in his chest all over again. Every extra beat it took was another second of borrowed time and agony. Tony could imagine the metal shard traveling deeper. Tearing his heart apart from this inside out.
It’s funny. How no matter how much time goes by what you can never forget. Your mother’s last words. Your father’s rare praise. A stranger’s footsteps.
He was failing at that. Maybe it was the rawness of their environment. That Tony had already been thinking of his parents. The way Steve looked at him. He couldn’t be sure, would have to analyze it later. Maybe talk it out with the new therapist.
“Harder,” the word came out as a harsh angry command even as his voice trembled, hitched, with the next thrust. He could come like that. Knew he could from the way his body was shaking with every move from Steve.
Now it was Tony’s turn to roll his eyes. “FRIDAY watches my vitals while I sleep. I’ll be fine.” Steve wasn’t moving, Tony could catch a shadow of him by the nightstand from his periphery.
Over the years Tony had been caught in a number of compromising positions before running into battle. A long list that involved crashing out the fiftieth floor of board meetings, jumping out of planes on their way to Japan, rushing out of the bathroom and more. What wasn’t on that list was being caught with his hands full of a war criminal super soldier with his pants figuratively around his ankles.
“Sure. Happy to host the living legend. Nothing to thank me about. Just doing my civic duty or something. Really it’s everyone’s tower now. Come over whenever you want. I’ll probably be back on the west coast full time again after the rebuilding of the city is done. So you don’t even have to run into me.”
Tony rolled his eyes. The things Steve faulted him for. “Fair enough,” Tony said choosing not to engage. He could see the straight path to them stupidly bickering if he did and where would that land either of them? The silence went on longer than both could take.
Steve managed a smile at that. He was quickly pushing past the blockade he’d thrown up. Settling back into his high-spirits and a far too comfortable posture for a place where he was unwanted. Tony preferred the Steve on his guard to the one with a small disarming smile on his face.
Steve was still looking down at him, amusement being overtaken by that concern. The disappointment that was so familiar to Tony, he’d grown up with it cloaked around him. For all the pain it caused him, it meant Steve was alive and not dead on some country road leading to nowhere. If he could feel sorry for Tony it meant that his heart was still beating.
“Not another step.” Her answering smile was all condescension and when she stopped it felt like she was merely humoring a benign request. “I have a feeling you’re about to tell me,” Tony prompted.
“But you’re not always there… There.” Tony laughed despite himself, getting ready to mock that particular sentence, but Steve cut him off with a look. “The team doesn’t need a genius. Or a ‘mechanic.’ It doesn’t need a billionaire.” Clearly, Steve didn’t realize how much Tony poured into the operations. “They need Tony Stark.”
Steve chuckled but continued to think the question over. “I’d like to think I’m someone who is always willing and ready to do what is right. No matter what the cost is. No matter what it takes.” It was such a Steve answer too, Tony was sure he’d heard variations of it over the years. It wasn’t that it was wrong, exactly, but…
Steve took a seat in the stool next to Tony. Had gone back to looking thoughtful rather than on guard. He surprised Tony by actually delving into it. “My father died in service, never got to know him. My mom was a nurse, died during a TB outbreak when I was young.”
“That’s why you are here?” Tony asked carefully and could feel his heart pounding in his chest. Last he’d officially checked Steve had been seen headed toward Wakanda. At which point Tony had claimed to have lost the ability to track him. Apparently news traveled fast. What would Tony say if Steve said yes?
“Come here,” Tony ordered lowly. Every time Steve pulled away gave him time to think. He didn’t want to go where thinking brought him. It was something only Steve seemed to be able to manage. Grounding him into the present where no ideas of the past or future could blink their distractions.
Tony turned his head away and stared at a distant tree. Concentrating hard on that while he got past the variety of emotions Steve expertly elicited. He took a few seconds to recollect himself. “I’m not doing this with you,” he breathed. “I’m not interested. The other night was a fluke. I’m engaged. Take your pick. Not doing this.” Maybe his last pick was currently a lie, but it would be weeks before the news got out and saying the word engaged did its job. Steve stiffened, his jaw clenching.
“Steve,” he responded, most likely out of politeness. A pointless answer to an implied demand for reciprocation. Steve had moved over to one of the other workbenches. Curiously reaching out to touch one of the many projects Tony had there.
“Okay, I know you can be a little slow on these things Cap, but when you bust your shield through a man’s armor you don’t get to do these drop-bys. When you’re a war criminal you don’t get to come up to an Avenger for a hang out. What did you want? For me to arrest you? I’m really not in the mood to get up, call the suit, and kick your ass.”
Tony tried his best to parse through it, but his general consensus was she wasn’t on Thor’s side if she was interested in taking over his planet. Whatever objects she was after, didn’t sound particularly great for either planet. Tony sighed, “Can’t let you do that, but if you want a souvenir from your trip we have these great bobble-heads. You’ll love it.” The only thing stopping Tony from firing was the knowledge that Asgardians were unnaturally fast and if she dodged the hit it could slam into one of the civilians behind her.
“It’s my battle to face. I need to do this my way,” Steve’s words were steady, insistent, deliberate. Meant to squash the inquiry for good this time.
Steve was looking at his face again. For a second features completely unguarded. Filled with the things Tony wasn’t allowed to think about. Tony resisted the urge to trail his hand along that jawline, over the crease of his brows. Whatever Steve saw reflected in Tony caused his expression to harden. He moved his hands under Tony, gripping his ass. Shocking Tony when he pulled himself up to a standing position, taking Tony with like he weighed nothing at all.
“I better add precognition to my resume,” Tony said dryly, dismissing the praise in any form. Flattery couldn’t get you everywhere… Well, Steve had already gotten into his pants twice, but off of different principals. The principal being Tony always had poor self-restraint and he’d never wanted anything the way he sometimes wanted Steve. It went past all logic. That he was thinking about this at all instead of battle defied all logic.
Rhodey was struggling to keep pace with him and despite the ticking hands of an invisible clock, Tony found himself slowing in his gait. He glanced over to Rhodes and wasn’t sure what he was expecting. Not the frustration that poured out of his best friend in steady waves. There was concern for Tony’s safety lurking in there, but more than anything else was Rhodey’s desire to be in his very own suit, having each others backs.
Steve opened the door to the bedroom and managed to maneuver them both through the doorway. Tony deposited himself to the edge of his bed, kicking off his socks as he went. He rubbed at his ankle before staring back to the ever expanding concern radiating off of Steve. Scorn, scorn would make this better.
Steve sighed and released Tony from his grip. Appeared to be preparing to back off and stand up. Possibly leave the building just like Tony had wanted to begin with. Wouldn’t that be great? Everyone walking away in one piece.
“I want you around. I don’t care if you never bring out Iron Man ever again, you’re still part of the team.” Steve took a deeper breath in an effort to stabilize what emotional state he was struggling with. “I thought you’d gone back to California. I just learned from Rhodey that you’ve been stuck up in this Tower for weeks. You are only a couple hours away-”
“-Having experienced it up close I can make adjustments. FRIDAY got a lot of reading that should be helpful.”
Steve’s eyes closed while he road out the rest of his climax. Opened excruciatingly long seconds later. They were staring wordlessly at each while lungs played catch up. Tony could feel every inhale Steve made. Couldn’t remember how to do it himself. Just held Steve to him for as long as he could.
That got Steve the rest of the way there. The kind of smile that started at the mouth, but lit up the eyes and had his entire body thrumming with a dangerously contagious energy. “I’ll be seeing you tomorrow Mr. Stark.”
“I’m sorry.” There weren’t any better words. Tony had known all of that of course, but hearing it from Steve was different. He didn’t look or sound emotionally affected, but Tony knew that those kind of feelings never went away. It just wormed its way deeper while you improved the mask you put with the pain.
Tony huffed. “You’re staying right here. I can’t have the public seeing us together before we get the Accords hammered out. It would be a nightmare and I’d lose leverage I need to get you back here legally.”
“He’s not very subtle,” Steve deadpanned while watching Peter make his way into the Avenger’s facility. “Nice kid though.”
Steve lightly shoved into his shoulder playfully. Tony looked down at his own arm with scrutiny. “It wasn’t really on me. I think I did everything possible to endanger my health, drove Ma and Bucky up the wall. I just got stuck in a mindset where any day could be my last, so I couldn’t let a day go by where I didn’t stand up for what I believe in. Do you know what I mean?”
“I can engage the enemy while you clear any remaining civilians from the perimeter,” Steve offered like it was a conversation among equals.
Steve took a deep breath while looking away before taking a couple long strides into Tony’s personal space. Surprised, Tony backpedaled into the bench. “That’s part of why I’m here. I’d like to start over Tony.”
Steve’s chuckle vibrated through him like a roll of thunder. More enthralling than a show of lighting. Tony was all but forced to cling to him. Force their mouths back together once, twice.
“I’ve never made a smarter move in my life.” Tony decided on, trying to work his face up into a glower. “So that’s not why you’re here?”
Tony could handle the humans, help Steve, and maybe still get to her in time. All of the civilians were out of range besides the ones directly in front of him. He couldn’t let them die when he could still do something to save them.
“It’s not what it looks like,” Tony tried. It may be a lost battle, but he wasn’t going down without a bit of a fight.
Which was exactly why Tony resolutely wasn’t watching Captain America get into the standard SHIELD stealth suit, he wasn’t. It wasn’t his fault that the helicarrier had reflective surfaces that were drawn to Steve like he was the only source of light in the room. That the way the suit clung to him made Tony feel like he standing next to a supernova. Steve pulled up the cloth that covered the lower half of his face, doing a good enough job of concealing his identity from the public eye. Most people weren’t Tony, they didn’t have the angle of his eyebrows memorized. They wouldn’t recognize the way his eyes narrowed, the way they did right now in Tony’s direction.
Steve had found his voice by clearing his throat. He pasted on an uneasy smile and placed his hand on Tony’s shoulder. It had nothing to do with steadying him this time. “You’ve helped me plenty. I don’t need your help here.” Despite Steve’s earlier words all Tony could hear was I don’t need you.
“I know he’s a nice kid,” Tony countered. Back to direct eye contact that had him wishing he knew how to look away. He needed to retrain his brain to be less destructive. To better understand every one of the dangers Steve represented. That he was susceptible to.
“And here I thought I was stating the obvious. Tell you what, you show me yours and I’ll show you mine.” Their legs were still pressed against each other. Tony ignored that and the obvious innuendo of what he’d just said.
He couldn’t help glancing over at Steve. At the way the tension had seeped out of him. Tony expected his eyes to be closed, face tilted up at the ceiling… But they weren’t, they were watching him instead. Steve’s facial expression serene and contemplative, but staring at Tony like he was still putting his soul out on display. As if, Tony really had given him the answers.
Steve started laughing, either at Tony’s tone or the question itself. The sound cut off as abruptly as it had started. “No, if I was flirting with you I’d say your lip is healing nicely,” Steve’s voice had drifted down several octaves. The blue in his eyes heating even as they were eclipsed. “That I haven’t stopped thinking about that night and it drives me crazy when you don’t answer my calls.”
