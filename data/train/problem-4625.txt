The furniture in the Angelus household was proportioned for Castiel, as the tallest and broadest resident of Willow River. Dean, being of a similar size, fit comfortably. Sam looked as though he sat in furniture proportional to children. Every time he moved, his knees banged against the underside of the library table. The third time the candles wobbled dangerously, Cas flicked his fingers and affixed the candlesticks to the table with a small charm. He also created a protective bubble around the flame.
It hit him, then, in perfect clarity what he had been avoiding fully acknowledging. He wanted Dean, in every way possible. Either one of them could have died. It was time to let go caution and reach for what he wanted.
“Our room is on the second floor,” Castiel said. The first floor was a tap room, nearly empty this time of day. A staircase nestled against one side of the room, and the Witch led them there, and up. The stairs creaked under the weight, but were sturdy enough.
It might almost be beautiful, if Dean were capable of looking at the scene without the overlay of corruption. There were areas of healthier ground where the trees grew tall and lush, creating islands of emerald green dotted along the cracked black and gray rock. Some grasses clung to the ground, spiraled out from the tree lines.
“You’ve been tracking, alone, a corrupted bear that dwarfs you in size.” Cas’ temper started to flare.
Dean hid his own grin, knowing that Cas wasn’t likely to take it well. He brushed the sides of his trousers with his thumbs. “Not that much about Willow River. We were mostly working on the bond.”
“I know that now, and I understand. You had to leave when you did, or you would have been broken. Those two years before you got me out, though, were difficult.”
“The bluebirds singing were cute,” Charlie mused. “Though I heard that the time a skunk sat back and blinked bashfully at him nearly gave him apoplexy.”
“Whatever you say, sweetheart. All the fresh caught fish you could want.” Dean pushed a lock of hair away from Cas’ forehead and placed a kiss there.
“Uh. Cas?” Dean asked. “That happen to be Charlie?”  They never did get around to talking about what form Charlie took, but Dean had the sudden suspicion that the answer was ‘fox’.”
“Not my name,” he said instead of directly responding. “Pink? This place looks like one of those peppermint sticks you can get at the general store.”
“I said fun, Cas. Not studying or doing research.” He walked over and tapped the book. “I swear, you remind me more of Sammy every day. Except he’s got Jess, and she makes him have fun.”
This was the opportunity Castiel had been waiting for. “My cousin Balthazar’s communique was frustratingly vague. He neglected to specify what form that would be.”
“Yes. She did. And carrots, as well as trail bread. I can cast a preservation spell on whatever we don’t eat today. There appears to be quite enough meat for a few meals,” Cas volunteered.
Castiel reviewed the list, then headed off to start with his purchases. He’d put off doing the shopping until after Dean arrived, mostly because he didn’t see a need to be storing the items himself. Security wouldn’t have been a problem; a simple spell protected his belongings from would-be thieves.
Cas regained consciousness in slow increments. His temple throbbed with pain, making it difficult to evaluate himself. He shifted in an instinctive effort to relieve the pressure, only to have his side flare up with an even more agonizing pain.
“I never asked, specifically, but I don’t believe either Nora or Charlie tracked that way.” Cas felt the usual melancholy when he thought of Nora. “Nora would fly overhead and look for areas of dead or sickly vegetation. You would have to ask Charlie but she likely does what you do, only on a more instinctual level.”
“I don’t mind either way,” Dean answered. “I thought Gabe here especially wouldn’t like it if there were chunks already missing. So stew?” he asks. “Ellen sent some potatoes with us too, right?”
“We have a few spices in the pack,” Cas volunteered. “If you like to season your meat. Thank you for providing fresh meat for dinner. Do you usually prefer to eat in human form or shifted? When you’re shifted, do you prefer raw or cooked?” He sounded genuinely curious.
“Cas.” Dean circled the table to stand right up in Cas’ space. “You would never let that happen. If this is what we need to do to stop the corruption here and now, this is what we
“Well that was the poorest attempt at a compliment I’ve ever received. I also have eyes? I’m all aflutter.”
When the group returned to the house, Dean was sitting in the front room, cupping a mug of coffee between his hands. He’d changed out of his trail clothes into a clean shirt and trousers, and had wiped down his boots. His hair was damp, which made it darker than its usual sandy blond.
Before the discussion continued down that vein, Donna stepped into the building followed closely after by Jody. “Castiel! Welcome back.” She went in for a hug before he could protest. Donna was a hugger, and always cheerful. Her demeanor meant that people who didn’t know her tended to underestimate her. Cas usually enjoyed watching her take down a corrupted creature with ruthless efficiency, faster and more deadly than most of their other scouts. “What can we help you carry back to the peppermint stick? I’ll come back around again tomorrow with some biscuits. You’ll be happy to know the bees are busy as ever and have plenty of honey to share, so the biscuits are extra delicious.”
“Cas.” Dean turned away from the tin the tea was stored in to face the Witch. “Everyone has their own reasons for coming out here. You said that yourself. If she didn’t know what she was getting into, she would have figured it out pretty quickly after arriving. She chose to stay. I… all right. I can’t actually speak for her. I can speak for myself, though. No matter what happens from here I don’t regret having met you.”
going. And those eyes. And the... shoulders. The thighs. You definitely don’t look anything like a booky Witch.”
Cas leaned down to kiss him, then sat up again. “Returning to the topic of my family, I would like to speak with them, I believe. If there is any chance to repair my relationship with them, I should make the attempt. With you by my side the risks would be much lower.”
Dean shifted his trunk slightly as he waited for Castiel to lead him from the stagecoach to their destination.
Dean hissed and snarled, but then collected his pack from Cas in his teeth before disappearing into a slight hollow and Shifting back to human form.
“Sammy!” He threw his arms around his brother in a firm embrace, unbidden tears pricking at the back of his eyes as his brother’s familiar scent hit him like a punch, warmth and cinnamon and
“What’s that?” Dean asked, reaching over to take one and examine it more closely. There was a tiny sigil etched into one surface, a simple one.
Still, the Angelus Witches had a reputation for a good reason. Without knowing the reasons that Castiel Angelus had chosen to come to the frontier rather than live a privileged life back on the east coast, Dean couldn’t know what he was letting himself in for.
“Since when do you care if people get uptight? Challenging people’s expectations and sensitivities is your favorite hobby.”
The summer sun was relentless. Dean ripped another weed out of the cornfield then sat back on his heels and wiped his brow. He needed to be out of the house right now. Watching Gabe fuss over Cas, acting more like brothers than they had since he’s been here, it made the homesickness hit particularly hard.
Dean was acutely aware that this set of skills was one he’d never learned. There was something fascinating about it. “Could you teach me to do this?” he asked abruptly. “Carpentry? Did you make the bookshelf inside, too? The one Cas keeps his personal collection on, the ones that aren’t magic?” Dean hadn’t seen where Cas kept the magic books, though he’d seen him with them now and then. He suspected he kept them in his room upstairs.
Activity at the platform picked up as the other people noticed the train arriving, a little after heightened Familiar senses had. Jess stepped away from Sam to take her turn hugging Dean and kissing him on the cheek.
“Thanks, Charlie.” Dean gave Cas a moment to lean in and give a pleased greeting to Smokey, before he guided Cas out of the stables and back towards the Peppermint House. “You had your own bath yet? You going to come join me, scrub my back maybe?”
Most creatures would turn away when they encountered wards, but corrupted creatures were different. They would obey the compulsion set on them until they were physically unable to. Cas had seen more than one mortally wounded creature continue the attack, ignoring injuries and missing limbs.
Cas was surprised. Very few Familiars had the control to perform a partial shift like that. Nora hadn’t. The only time she’d done so was when she was upset and feathers sprouted in her hair. In fact, Cas had never personally witnessed such a thing before. He calmly held out his knife to Dean, hilt first. Claws might do a good job, but a sharp knife was still better.
Cas stilled. He set his finger in place in the book he was reading and mostly closed it. “I believe it originally belonged to Nora’s mother.”
By the time the two of them were ready to head out, both trunks were emptied out and repacked into bags more suitable for pack animals. The trunks themselves were sold along with surprisingly little of Dean’s other belongings. Castiel did suggest he traded in some of his fancier eastern clothes for more roughspun, sturdier alternatives. Dean thought that was a smart move, though he retained one finer set of clothes. One never knew when there might be an occasion to look one's best.
“Yeah, I do. Can’t help out at the campsite as easy when I don’t have opposable thumbs.” He wiggled his fingers to demonstrate. “Let me take over the cooking. You can go wander around and set wards.”
Cas did feel better when he woke in the morning. He sat up and squinted at the sun. It had already cleared the trees, so well past dawn, then. Next he glanced around for Dean and spotted the cat sprawled out in the sunshine. His ear flicked back, indicating he was aware that Cas was awake, but otherwise did not move.
“Preaching to the choir, Dean-o,” Gabe interjected. “And highest bidder? If Samuel was pimping out his only unbonded direct blood-descendant Familiar, you can bet Mikey and Lucy would be in a bidding war. Or just decide to skip Samuel altogether and pursue the issue independently.”
As soon as he released her, John pulled him into a tight hug. “I’m proud of you, son,” he said. “I’m still not anywhere near happy about this, but that doesn’t mean I’m not proud of you and what you’ve become. You keep that charm on you, no matter your form.” He touched the protection amulet suspended on a leather thong around Dean’s neck. He and Mary had worked the original protections, and then Sam and Jess had enhanced it with their own unique strengths.
Turned out that Castiel was right. They barely made it half a block before being invited in to share lunch with news-starved townsfolk. Castiel had apparently spoken with these folk before, as he’d been in Rockville for some days before the stagecoach arrived.
Dean barked out a laugh. “You’re killing me with the dirty talk. Not necessarily. You aren’t going to know straight off that you are aiming for a permanent alliance, are you? That comes with time and compatibility. I could spook if you go in right away talking about raising kids and those other couple things.”
“On the bright side, seems more likely that Willow River really is being spared the attacks while they’re focusing on us. That is what we were planning on.”
Both Gabe and Charlie’s doors were securely closed, with no sound coming from behind them. Cas knew they were both up far longer than he was. With all of his focus on getting to Dean, he didn’t give more than a passing thought to his two housemates on his way out the door.
“I wasn’t too fond of the situation either,” Cas replied. He set the canteen down and took the opportunity to look around. Dean had found them a cave. He doubted he would be able to stand at full height, but there was enough space that he didn’t feel claustrophobic even with the two of them. He couldn’t see much out the entrance besides trees and brush, but the sound of rushing water made it obvious they weren’t far off from the river. The bluffs, then. Dean had somehow brought him so far as the bluffs and constructed a bed of grasses and foliage while he was passed out. The light was dim, but bright enough outside that he could see well enough.
Cas shrugged out of his coat, folded it neatly and set it down on a rock safely away from the perimeter of the corruption. He rolled up the cuffs of his sleeves and flexed his hands, then reached out to touch Dean through the connection between them. The link flared lightly, then settled into a steady flow. Cas could see it with his second sight, Dean’s green energy mixing clear and bright with his own blue-white aura.
“You keep whiskey in your room?” Dean arched a brow. “Wow, Cas, didn’t know you had it in you. I’m impressed.” He grinned a lazy grin. “I’d be honored.”
The two of them made sure Red and Pigeon were clipped securely to Castiel’s saddle, but Cas chose to walk along with Dean out of town rather than mounting right away. They walked for about a half hour before Dean ran out of patience with his human form.  They were far enough away, now, and plenty of scrub brush around.
“Might be is not something I prefer to deal in,” Cas answered. “How far out were the signs? We’re going to need to camp out in order to get there?”
He was considering if it would be worth it to pull Smoky to a halt and take the time to dunk his head in the cold stream they were running along the banks of, when the horse staggered to a halt on his own. Cas caught his balance and looked up to see Dean’s mountain lion sitting atop a boulder and staring at him with a steady green-eyed gaze.
“Right back at you.” He stepped back and efficiently stripped out of his clothing, folding it neatly and placing it into the satchel. He handed the package to Cas before he shifted, feeling the sparkle and shimmer, the pull and stretch and pop as his body quickly transitioned from one form to the other.
Castiel stepped up onto the front porch and stamped his feet to dislodge as much of the dirt and mud as he could from his boots. He set the trunk down and opened the door before picking it up again. “After you,” he said politely. Dean liked his voice. It was low and rough, though cultured and polite enough. Something about it made a little lick of heat curl low inside him.
“Jody has been telling me that her scouts are spread thin, what with Maggie recovering from that snake bite.” Thankfully she’d only taken a snake bite and nothing more sinister. “The four of us together?”
He squinted as he watched the horse and rider approach. Something wasn’t right. The rider wasn’t reacting at all to catching sight of the stockade. Usually there was an increase in pace, a wave, something. Some reaction that the end goal was in sight. Dean opened himself up a little more to the flow of magic.
There wasn’t supposed to be any corruption east of Willow River, either, so Dean understood he shouldn’t rely on that.
“I’ll keep that in mind next time I need to disappear,” Dean answered. “Not really sitting well with me to just let them do whatever, though.”
“He does this every time.” Charlie pushed into Cas’ room carrying a plate piled high with chicken and a glass of water. “I’ve got him from here, Dean. Why don’t you go get some sleep yourself? Don’t try to pretend you aren’t just as tired. I left you a plate of food down in the kitchen.”
“Mm,” Dean answered, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of anything more than that, but in the face of her relentless cheerfulness, he couldn’t help but smile and shrug one shoulder.
“I’ll show you how much every day. I promise. Every day.” He dipped down to press a soft kiss to Cas’ lips. “Every day.”
“Well, that might take a while to happen.” Charlie arched an eyebrow. “Gabe is not happy right now. You might want to sleep in the barn.”
He sat there now, face tilted up towards the sun, eyes closed. “You really are a cat,” his younger brother Sam commented, as he sat down next to Dean.
Dean nodded. “I guess I’ll see it for myself. Day after tomorrow will work just fine. I’ll write a letter to my family while I’m here, let them know I made it this far, at least.” It sounded like he might not be able to get another letter out for quite some time. They would want to know he was safe this far, and he would share his first impressions of Castiel Angelus as well. He knew his family worried that he’d made a poor decision. If he could give them some peace of mind, he would.
Dean felt a thrum of sadness through the bond. “Oh.” He slowed his movement, taking extra care with the cup as he set it down.
Once again he wished he could figure out a way to communicate over a distance with those he wasn’t bonded with, but even with Dean the communication link wasn’t reliable very far. As they’d worked together it had grown, and now they had a range of nearly two miles, but two miles wasn’t nearly near enough for their purposes.
Dean stood and walked over to look at the markers, running his fingers over the carvings. “These are beautiful.”
“Yeah, no. I’m not talking to Gabe. It’s fine. I’ll just… it’s fine.” He turned abruptly away from the window to pour himself another glass of the whiskey, and another for Cas as well. “So. Drunk?”
“And Samuel Campbell retains a portion of the contract fee, as the agent through which the contract is arranged. There have been… rumors.”
He faced everyone, taking a moment to gauge the mood. Everyone’s attention was locked on them. Some were curious, some apprehensive, and some irritable. Cas nodded, then began once again going over the events chasing after what got Rufus and Bobby up to returning back to Willow River. He strategically left out any details of what happened between Dean and himself in the cave. That was personal, and not relevant to the matter at hand.
“We can make a door, as well,” Cas said. “Gabe isn’t much of a carpenter. I’m surprised you managed to put together a room that appears solidly constructed.”
The first passengers handed down off of the coach Castiel dismissed. His Sight showed them to be neither Witch nor Familiar. He began to be concerned Mr. Winchester was not on this coach after all when the final passenger disembarked.
Cas watched Dean and Gabe bicker while Dean adeptly shifted the pronghorn around to expose the belly, popping out a single sharp claw and using it to slice open the carcass. “So you’re saying you use your magic skills to lord it over the others.”
“I’m all right.” Dean snorted. “I’m not the one that has been unconscious for near a full day.” Relief took over the worry in his expression. He tilted his head to press into Cas’ touch.
Then she grew more serious, reaching out to touch his arm. “That’s a good thing, right? I loved Nora, you know I did. She was kind and dedicated to our work, disciplined and smart. But… and I don’t mean this in any sort of a disparaging way… she wasn’t the best match for you. She was holding you back. You’re even more powerful as a Witch than Gabe is, and he’s one of the strongest I’ve ever met. Who knows what you’ll be capable of with a stronger Familiar to back you up?”
All right. Enough. Cas needed him, no time to waste in self-recrimination. Hopefully Smoky would make it safely back to Willow River, but there was nothing Dean could do about that right now. He took the time to check Cas over more thoroughly. He was breathing easily enough, and his side didn’t feel over warm. That had to be a good sign, right? Maybe it was just too soon for any sort of infection to hit. Still, a Witch with healing abilities could ward off infections, even cure them. He just had to recover enough to work those spells.
The Witch was still unconscious and bled sluggishly. “Cas. Cas, come on, buddy. Stay with me.” He tore the remains of Cas’ shirt and used it as a makeshift bandage around his thigh, and then used his own shirt, already shredded from the hasty shift, to wrap up his ribs. He pulled on what was left of his trousers, and his boots, then picked Cas up. He winced as his strained muscles complained.
They made it back to Willow River more swiftly than they’d made it out. Dean had rarely been so happy to see a place as he was to see the jagged skyline of the stockade. “A nice big glass of whiskey sounds awesome about now,” he murmured to himself.
There were two gates, Water and Land. They approached from the Water gate, close enough for boats to unload with convenience but far enough back that occasional flooding would not threaten the construction. There were a small number of boats pulled up onto the shore, clearly well-maintained and frequently used.
“No you weren’t, you were approaching spitting mad and arguing.” Pamela set the rifle down again and crossed her arms. “Now one of you might want to go chase down that horse. It has our mail on it.”
“I had to shift quickly, didn’t have time to make sure I didn’t bust right out of what I was wearing.” He paused long enough to accept the shirt and shrug it on with a small smile of thanks. “Would have lost the shirt anyhow. Bandages.”
Cas suppressed a sigh of relief. “Yes. Though in the end it’s more that he brought me back.” He shifted his weight from one foot to the other. The tainted bear had left enough of a mark that it still stung, when he moved the wrong way. “We found something concerning. A cave, with sigils all around.”
“The problem is that we don’t really know what the source of the corruption is. Without knowing the source, it is difficult to determine the cure.”
Castiel did not gain visual of Dean again until twilight, as he finished securing the animals for the night at their chosen campsite.
“So that’s what you -- we -- are doing. What do these pockets look like? And how do you cleanse them?”
Dean’s magic stuttered and pulled back involuntarily when it touched the oily edges of the corruption, its purity and brightness muddled. Dean himself growled and lashed his tail.
Dean did not even notice the small draw of magic. He was occupied watching his brother pull book after book out of his satchel until the entire table surface was covered in leather bound parchment. Jess sat beside him, perched on the edge of her chair, watching everything intently.
Cas’ fingers stilled for a moment before resuming their soothing massage of Dean’s scalp. “I confess I’ve not thought that far ahead. With you, everything is different. When the four of us first arrived here at the Frontier — Gabe, Charlie, Nora and I — we were content to have a place where we felt we could make a home and provide a much-needed service.”
Cas was getting good at interpreting Dean’s expressions, cat form or no. The emotional link from the bond certainly didn’t hurt.
“Fair. I try not to think about it too much, either. I think you’d find that’s true of most of us. People don’t usually come to the frontier because they’re leading an idyllic life back on the coast.” She tossed another pebble into the stream.
Sam sighed. “Yeah, okay. Here.” He held out his arm and used his strength to help Dean move from his bedding over to Cas’.
There was a clatter of silverware. Dean looked up to see Charlie sheepishly picking her knife back up. She cleared her throat. “That’s big news, though. Huge. What was it?” she asked.
Charlie watched him for a while, then picked up her own pebble and tossed it. She didn’t say anything, just kept him company.
“You do realize I’m getting your base emotions and nowhere do you feel actual disgust.” Cas refilled his glass. “Was Sam named for your grandfather? An interesting choice, given your mother’s history with Samuel Campbell.”
Once dinner was complete, Cas followed through on casting preservation spells on the leftovers while Gabe walked the perimeter setting up wards. Preservation spells hardly took any energy, so Cas didn’t need him and Dean took the opportunity to stretch and wash up at the small nearby stream.
“Mm, yeah, with the hard stuff. Bobby invited me for poker at the Saloon. I’m just gonna clean up a bit, then head on over. Wanna come?” Bobby said he never did, but it didn’t hurt to ask.
“Don’t be dramatic, Dean. It isn’t so bad.” Cas stepped forward, towards the dilapidated homestead on the peak of the next rise.
“Does this settlement we’re going to have a name?” Dean asked, piling his own plate full of food. “You aren’t the only one that your cousin failed to fill in details for.”
The whole town was unlike what he was accustomed to. New Avalon was all brick and stone and where there was wood, it was carefully planed to exact measurements, then painted or whitewashed. Windows were glassed in, and if there wasn’t glass, there were at least shutters, usually painted in a contrasting color. Here almost all of the buildings were some sort of plaster he was unfamiliar with, interspersed occasionally with rough wood construction.
“This is going to take me longer than it’s going to take you to get ready, but yes.” Dean leaned in to steal a kiss. “I want to be thorough.”
The Winchester town home sat on a quiet street outside the central ring of high society yet still a comfortable distance from the busy docks of New Avalon. Dean had been known to spend a lot of time in the dockside taverns amongst less genteel company. These last few days, though, found him more often in the small back garden.
“The details… perhaps I’ll share them someday, but with Gabe’s pointing me in the right direction, my eyes were opened. I… didn’t care for what I saw. I considered standing up and sharing my indignation, but then I remembered that our father had disappeared, and perhaps there was more to that than I realized as a young child. I chose not to do anything until I met with Gabriel — and when I met with him, I brought money and my most prized possessions. We left New Avalon that very night.”
“You good?” Sam asked, taking the blankets and arranging them over the two of them, gently tucking them in around their legs.
“Gabe and I just left, and we’ve been in view the entire time,” Charlie pointed out. “Relax.” She reached out and stroked his arm affectionately.
Perhaps he could sear it using magic. Now that he thought of it, that would likely not be too difficult. He’d just have to alter a fire spell slightly… He blinked and shook his head, focusing again.
Mary took a deep breath and closed her eyes for a long moment, centering herself. “You will do well,” she said. “As much as I will miss you, this is the right decision for you. You’re strong and well-trained as a Familiar, and your shift form is well-suited for the frontier. You have the skills, training, and instincts to not only survive, but to thrive. Just remember to be cautious, until you know the peculiarities of your new home. And remember that despite having signed a contract, if the Witch awaiting you is the wrong sort, you just turn yourself around and come back home, you hear?” She adjusted his collar, then patted his chest.
“Bobby made most of the markers. I think it’s a way for him to work through his guilt. He feels responsible, whether or not he actually was, for every loss.”
A cool cloth placed on his forehead, along with the soothing presence of his Familiar, eased the pain. His Familiar. “Dean!”
Cas nodded, drew energy from Dean, and sent a bolt through the wards to incinerate the creature where it stood. It howled and yipped in the instant before it turned to ash. Casting these spells was so easy, with Dean. None of this would have been possible with Nora. Not the strength of the wards, not the ease of the offensive spells. None of it. Now that he and Dean had accepted the most permanent form of bond, Cas was astounded by the breadth and depth of what he could do. It was intoxicating. Sometimes he felt as though there was nothing he couldn’t do.
“Not until dinner,” Castiel answered. “Hungry, are you? It is that time of day if we simply walk along we are sure to be invited for any number of meals with the only price being a bit of gossip. You will be particularly popular, having just arrived from the east.”
Dean’s heart stuttered when he heard Charlie say that. “Cas. Dump the buzz through the link,” he commanded. He had followed fairly close behind Cas down the stairs.
“Exactly,” Sam bobbed his head, and tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. “Familiars are a deeply ingrained part of the magic. They’re like… they’re like heddles on a loom. They keep the threads of magic from tangling as a Witch pulls on and uses it. That sigil wasn’t preventing Amara from using magic like those Witches who created it thought. It prevented her from channeling through a Familiar and therefore controlling what the magic actually did. My theory is that, unlike Cas, that didn’t prevent her from trying. She’s been out there, for centuries, warping the magic.”
Dean wasn’t too far away. They couldn’t afford to have much physical distance between them, for their own safety. He wasn't too far away, but currently out of sight. Cas pushed up a hill until he saw what Dean was looking at.
Rockville was small enough that he could easily guess which building was the boarding house. Even so, he allowed Castiel to pass in front of him and lead the way. The view was well worth it. The long coat he wore swung with every step he took, shifting around his long legs, moving around his rear to give tantalizing hints of its shape. His hat concealed most of his hair, though a few wayward dark tufts curled against the base of his neck.
Charlie took an extra half step and bumped up against him. “So… you and I are the only two Familiars here. Everyone’s used to Familiars, so you don’t have to worry about that part anyhow. They know the value we offer. I know back east sometimes people look at us sideways. Here you’ll just have to prove yourself as a person, not because of what you can do.”
Cas flopped over onto his back, lifting his hand to curl around the nape of Dean’s neck. “I’m sorry,” he murmured, softly enough that Gabe shouldn’t be able to hear. “He’s… insistent.”
By their very nature Witches tended to be more academically inclined than Familiars. Castiel’s greatest regret about relocating to the frontier was leaving behind the majority of his book collection. He found the differences in training methodology between the two endlessly fascinating. Perhaps at some point in the future Dean would indulge his curiosity, and talk about his experiences.
He held Cas’ gaze as long as he could. His eyes drifted closed just before his lips brushed against Cas’ in the lightest of kisses. When no protest of pain or even discomfort came, Dean allowed his weight to settle entirely. Dean slid his hand up along Cas’ rib cage with the intent of following a path all the way up to his shoulder and then down to link their fingers together.
“Mr. Winchester.” The gentleman behind the desk stood and extended his hand. His hands were smooth, clearly indicative of a life spent in intellectual rather than physical pursuits. He had an accent that suggested he’d either been born overseas in the old world or else thought it made him sound more cultured, and a thin, precisely groomed mustache. “Pleasure to make your acquaintance, sir. I understand you are inquiring about the advertisement for a Familiar in the frontier lands.”
Castiel scowled faintly to himself, then rapped on the flimsy door to the room before opening it and stepping inside, setting the sack of goods he’d purchased on the floor inside before looking for Dean. The rest of his purchases would be delivered later.
It seemed like hours but was probably only a handful of minutes before the lady returned. “Mr. Angelus will see you now. Please follow me.”
Dean followed Bobby into Peppermint House, carrying lengths of wood that he’d bee assured could make a door. Bobby brought them here for that purpose, so they must be able to. He wasn’t yet sure what kind of magic was going to transform them from uneven planks into a functional door.
“Dean, this is Ellen Harvelle,” Cas introduced her. “As you’ve no doubt surmised, she operates the saloon. She’s also our community healer.”
The connection between himself and Dean right now was slender, nothing more than a tendril of awareness. That was part of the plan, but despite it being a deliberate choice, Cas hated it. It hadn’t been long, really, but already he was accustomed to the richness and depth of the full partnership bond between the two of them. He was accustomed to the constant presence of Dean in his mind, even if most of the time it was a dormant presence. There, but not obtrusive. He fancifully likened it in his mind to the cat form of his mate’s shift curled up on the hearth, asleep. There, definitely noticeable, but possible to disregard until he woke up and took up the whole of Cas’ attention.
“I don’t think the wild frontier is ready for Sam and Jessica Winchester.” Dean knew he wasn’t ready for his brother and his bondmate to be anywhere near the dangers of the frontier.
Dean simply waited for him to continue, shifting closer until his knee pressed against Castiel’s thigh.
“Sammy,” Dean rumbled at his brother, a hint of a growl in his voice. “I know that face. That’s the ‘Sammy did something really smart and really stupid all at the same time’ face. What did you do?”
Ellen slammed a whiskey down in front of Dean, most of the contents sloshing over the side of the glass. “What hornets nest did you boys stir up without telling the rest of us?”
Cas nodded. He was reluctant, but agreed it was a good idea. He’d been noticing more and more of a tightness through their bond, and Dean’s temper seemed more strained. Sometimes he came back from a hunt more frustrated that he’d been before he left.
Word had gotten out that the source of the corruption had been cleared. Now that the winter storms were over, more people arrived at Willow River every day. They were going to have to either expand soon, or branch off to a new outpost. Whatever was decided, Dean wasn’t going to be here to take part. He was going back to New Avalon to introduce his Witch to his parents.
“Animals, mostly. Sometimes people, but there are so few people in these parts that it’s usually animals. If a pronghorn eats some grass that was tainted, or if an owl eats a mouse that ran through a patch of the corruption… whatever the cause, the effect is horrific.”
She shrieked as the magic penetrated her, her limbs all glowing. Then she fell back, dropped to the ground, aging before his eyes. Centuries, he remembered. She became an old woman, then an ancient one, then beyond ancient, until she shriveled, dried up, and crumbled into dust that blew away on the wind.
Cas let go of Dean’s hand only long enough to wrap his arm around him and guide him back from the edge of the bluff. Dean allowed it, grateful this once for Cas to override his stubborn side.
“You need to get out of here,” Gabriel told Cas with no lead-in at all. Cas was checking over one of the cows who seemed to be feeling off, but he wasn’t finding anything wrong. Dean was a short distance away, helping to muck out the barn. “School exercises are all well and good, but Dean’s not the type to do his best work with artificial challenges. You need to get him out of the encampment and into the wild.”
“I don’t know why you persist in believing I’m entirely ignorant of magic,” Dean commented. “Or you just want me to believe you’re so shitty at it you can’t manage simple exceptions?”
“Winchester.” Cas’ focus was absolute, He stared at Dean while small, disparate pieces of a puzzle clicked into place in his mind. “Samuel Campbell’s only daughter, Mary, broke from the tradition of the head of her family arranging her Witch partnership and instead entered into a bond of her own choosing. A Winchester Witch?”
Gabriel had moved to sit at the table, the roast on a platter in the middle. He sliced off generous servings and loaded them onto the plates as the others took their seats.
“Well.” Charlie’s nose scrunched up as she thought about it. “Max doesn’t seem to mind that his gun puffs out purple smoke every time he shoots it.”
“Yeah. You will be.” Sam clasped him on the shoulder, then quietly exited the tent, closing and fastening the tent flap behind himself.
“He is too far gone to be cured,” Cas said as he slumped just slightly against Dean, using his Familiar as support. Dean knew how much Cas hated not being able to save someone. He clasped Cas’ shoulder in silent support.
Gabe turned and threw the mug of tea into the back of the fireplace, where it shattered. The liquid immediately evaporated when it hit the embers.
Cas scowled, though he was, perhaps, amused. Perhaps. Very slightly. He brushed some detritus from his thigh.
Nora usually Shifted in her room, leaving her clothing there, and then flew out the window to join him. He kept a spare change of clothing for her in case she needed to shift back to human form while they were out, but that rarely happened. He had never been physically attracted to Nora anyhow. She was like a sister to him, or perhaps a close cousin. A very good friend, but not anyone he would ever consider a deep bond with, and he knew she felt the same. They worked well together, but that little extra that could take the relationship beyond the superficial level simply wasn’t there.
When he got up to make a quick trip to the outhouse, he saw a chalkboard near the door. There were some names and dates on it, along with a section with some sort of code he couldn’t decipher. “Hey, Cas. What’s this?”
“But still not to your liking, I am sure, if you were unable to find opportunity to shift.” Castiel had known Familiars all his life, some better than others. He knew that while a Familiar did not biologically
“Be right there!” Charlie called as well, sounding far more cheerful. She bounded down the stairs, coming over to wrap her arms around Cas in a hug. “You’re the best.”
It felt good to be a cat again. Dean stretched, spreading his paws and popping his claws out of their sheathes before retracting them again. He wound himself around Cas’ legs, head-butting him affectionately.
“What are your strengths, anyhow? What are we going to be practicing, when dinner is over. You aren’t half bad at the sigils.”
“Dean. Did you expect I would learn you left and simply let you go on your own?” His tone was sharper than intended, influenced by his own worry for the Familiar. Dean didn’t take offense, though. Their bond allowed him to feel that it was worry driving the words instead of true anger.
After some observation, Dean found that the best spot for him was underneath the cot. It allowed him to press up against Cas’ leg for physical contact while still being out of the way of the constant stream of people moving in and out at Ellen’s direction. Cas focused wholly on Bobby, holding nothing back in his efforts to heal the man.
Would it be worth it to ask Sam to send more of the stories with his next letter? Packages were a great deal more expensive and less reliable than letters to send. There were probably things more important than adventure books to send, but damn. Bobby would appreciate them so much.
overwhelming. I can handle it, just, if I stay out of cat form. I have more motivation to now.” He pointed out in front of them. “I want to go look there. I can’t exactly track anything, it’s too much of a jumbled mess of wrong. There is something extra wrong over there, though.”
“Call me Gabe,” Gabriel said. “Gabriel is too formal. I’m not big on formal, most of the time. Pleased to meet you. I hope we live up to your expectations. We’re rough on the outside, but there are good people here, doing important work.”
Despite his intentions to submit, he couldn’t stop himself from flinching when he felt the touch of her magic reaching into his and grabbing it. Rather than the gentle coaxing and invitation he’d grown accustomed to with Cas, she tore into his psyche with no regard for him, greedy and eager to taste the sheer power of a bond with a Familiar after… well. If Sam’s research was to be believed, after centuries of going without.
“One battle at a time” Cas suggested. “The corruption seems an easy problem to solve in comparison to my elder brothers. Help me here, and afterwards? Afterwards I will return to New Avalon and help you there.”
The urge to shift and go curl up on Cas’ bed with him was strong, but he resisted. Charlie was a Familiar. She’d know what to do. He forced himself to eat the chicken. She wasn’t wrong about that, either. He needed to replenish himself. His head was spinning, and if he was perfectly honest with himself, he wasn’t good for much of anything right now. What Cas had done… he’d never seen anything like that. Picking apart each individual tendril of corruption, teasing it into nothingness, unwinding it from where it coiled around Bobby’s essence… it was precise spellwork, intricate and complicated, requiring levels of concentration and finesse that Dean had never witnessed before.
Castiel sighed and pulled enough magical energy to close up Dean’s wounds. “She is very powerful, very skilled. She’s working spells we’ve either forgotten or never knew to begin with.”
“The goal has shifted from ‘a big glass of whiskey’ to getting drunk?” Cas asked in an attempt to deflect from his own thoughts. Dean had already mentioned the contract being a temporary one. It wouldn’t be smart to start allowing himself to hope for something more solid and permanent. Even if Dean was the most breathtaking Familiar he had ever come across. No, more than that. The most breathtaking man, be he Familiar or no.
“No, he wouldn’t be. He has Witch blood, but it did not manifest for him very powerfully. He chose to pursue a career in law instead. You are aware that the west was corrupted by a powerful arcane event, approximately three hundred years ago?”
Cas was close enough to hear him. “I have a bottle stashed in my room. I don’t know about you, but I am not quite ready for the Saloon. Come up and share it with me?”
“The same Bobby that built out my bedroom?” Dean asked as he offered a hand to shake before sitting down across from the older man.
“Thank you.” He looked around, spotting a finely carved bench across from her desk, and seated himself. The office was paneled with dark wood wainscoting, and the windows draped with dark red velvet edged with gold fringe. He realized he was tapping his heel against the floor and forced himself to stop. It wouldn’t do to show how nervous he was. At least it wasn’t the kind of nervous that made him feel threatened, so he wasn’t fighting to control an instinctual need to shift.
“Who’s Jody?” Dean asked, listening to the conversation but not really following it. He didn’t know the people, didn’t know the area. He did know, however, that Cas felt uneasy about whatever Gabe was saying. All of their school lessons meant that surface level emotions were easy to read across their bonding, as long as neither of them were trying to hide them.
To ask about anyone’s past was considered rude, but Dean had spoken of his family immediately, and with affection. There wasn’t any mental retreat from the topic, either, so Cas felt free to continue.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said. “I would like you to meet Jody Mills and Donna Hanscum. I mentioned Jody earlier – she’s Willow River’s Senior Scout, and coordinates the patrols around the territory. Donna is also a scout. In addition to her scout duties, she has a knack for finding beehives and their honey. Do you like honey?”
Cas sighed again. “In any event, I was bonded with a string of Familiars, all of whom had no fondness for me or for Witches in general. I didn’t understand why my experience with Familiars was so different from that of the tales I’d read and romanticized in my childhood. Mother told me they were fairytales written by the general public, those who had no idea how a Witch/Familiar bond was actually supposed to work.”
“Hey. Here, I bet you want something to drink.” He held a flask to Dean’s mouth, gently supporting his head, raising it enough to pour some blessedly cool water into his mouth. The water had a metallic tang to it from the flask, some mineral aftertaste, and was the best thing he’d ever drank.
No. He wouldn't let himself think that way. There. They'd left Smoky and the supplies just over that ridge. Once he got to their packs he could tend Cas' wounds better, make him comfortable, brew one of those teas and force Cas to drink it. All he had to do was make it a little farther. With a burst of energy, he made it that last distance to where they had left Smoky and their supplies.
“Agreed.” Cas rubbed his thumb lightly in the small of Dean’s back, the urge to comfort nearly overwhelming. He didn’t like the pale, drawn look of Dean’s expression. He felt terrible for placing it there. He knew this was important. Objectively, he knew that Dean needed to understand what they were up against. Even so, he didn’t have to like it. “Dean.” He stroked his palm up Dean’s spine. “I... I am sorry, for doing this to you.”
“Nah, I’ll shift again for night time. I’ll figure out more permanent options once we get where we’re going and I can see what the space is like.”
By the time the building was shored up and cleaned up as much as they reasonably could the sun had set. There had been one more attack while they were settling in, but nothing in the hours since their dinner break. Cas nodded towards the porch, lifting his brow in question. Dean nodded in agreement. They settled down on a stable corner of the porch, still inside the wards, and looked up at the vast expanse of star-spangled sky.
“No doubt it is a very nice door. Good.” She picked up a spare cloth and wiped her hands clean. “I’ve just finished mashing the grain for the next batch of whiskey. Why don’t you go on back and gather the draff to add to the cattle feed.”
Castiel chose not to feel rushed in finishing his own meal. It was, admittedly, much better than he was capable of throwing together himself and deserved to be enjoyed. It also provided a valid excuse to watch Dean prowl about the perimeter of the camp. He realized he was being influenced by now knowing what Dean’s Familiar form was, yet prowling did seem an apt description. Contained confidence in motion.
“Yes, all right,” Castiel agreed. “That is a good idea. And a good practice at working together.” He handed the skillet over to Dean and stood up. Temporary wards were something he could do with his own power; they were simple enough, the power coming mostly from the sigils themselves, but even so. That would not help with learning to work with Dean. So for the first sigil, he prepared exactly the same way he would were he still working with Nora, opening the link to its fullest and drawing power towards himself.
He looked out into the distance. The terrain was rising here, gradually climbing up to what he knew from prior trips would end in a bluff dropping suddenly down to the wide river below.
Gabe grinned at him. “Hey, what’s the point of having Witch abilities if you can’t have fun with them once in a while? This is home sweet home. Parlor and kitchen are on the main floor, bedrooms upstairs.”
Well. Somehow he’d never considered that his new Familiar would be astonishingly attractive. That could be a complication. Castiel swallowed as the man closed the distance between them and stopped an arm’s length away.
“Most,” Sam agreed. “I grew up with both my mom and my older brother being Familiars, I have Jess now. I haven’t had a lot of experience casting without. How did it feel to you, to try?”
Cas moved over to Gabe, giving his brother a brief hug and pat on the shoulders. “Has anything of note happened while I was gone?”
“We’ve no immediate plans to wade into the middle of it. No longer range plans to do so, either,” Cas assured him. “Let’s collect Gabe and Charlie and move away from here.”
“I trust that you would be able to tell.” Cas let go the charm and instead placed his hand over Dean’s on his cheek. Even so, he closed his eyes and looked inward. As had become the usual of late, Dean’s energy was there to supplement his own, a cool, bright balm.
Dean picked up his and Bobby’s drinks at the bar, giving Ellen his best charming smile. “Thank you, ma’am.”
He stayed silent through it all, because if he knew anything about Dean, it was this: when his chin was set like that, and his eyes were that hard and unyielding, there was no point in asking him a damn thing.
more—than average angels. They were made to help God to shape and form the universe. We were made eons later out of the scraps of energy that were left. We were just muscle, when you come right down to it. Jack brought me back because he needed help and guidance—”
Cas didn’t say anything as they pulled out of the garage into the gathering dark. He didn’t say anything as Dean circled the block and parked in a shaded spot just within sight of the shop. He didn’t say anything as the sun set, and they watched the mechanics begin to stream out of the building. As they watched Bill emerge from the shop, close and lock the sliding door behind him, climb onto a motorcycle and pull out of the parking lot.
A tiny moan escaped him, and he felt Dean smile against his lips. Dean turned and pressed Cas against Baby, his hands roaming beneath Cas’ trench coat and suit coat. He grasped Cas’ sides, fingers stroking where they touched, making Cas shudder. His thumbs slipped under Cas’ waist band.
“And the anti-possession tattoo. Most people lose their scars and tattoos the moment they transition into Heaven, but it’s usually all of them, not just some.”
The silence that preceded those lonely outbursts was like the steady gathering of pressure before a storm. It was electric and relentless, and the sheer energy coming off of Dean now pressed into Cas in much the same way he’d pressed Dean into a chair earlier that evening.
Dean sighed and squinted out at the bleeding sky and the sun sinking behind the mountains. He looked over at Cas, who was watching him again.
He opened his eyes to see Cas’ bright blue eyes, shining with welling tears, a smile on his face that looked almost holy. Dean had seen the smile before—the first time Cas had told him he loved him. The day he’d died. Then, he’d been plagued by confusion and self-loathing, knowing that a creature as good as Cas had no business loving someone like himself. Now, he just let the smile fill him, fuel him. Maybe he’d never really believe that he deserved it, but he wasn’t as foolish now as he’d been. If Cas was willing to put up with Dean, even for a day—willing to give him love and accept Dean’s—Dean wouldn’t waste a single goddamn second questioning it. He would just accept it. And be grateful for it.
Cas trailed behind, smiling, as Dean led the way to the back door. He opened it with a flourish, and waved Cas through to the back porch. He followed, feeling his heart go quiet and calm at the sight of what awaited them.
“You dropped a bomb on me, Cas. You dropped a bomb on me, and I didn’t know the first thing about how to handle it, and then you just
Cas shrugged. “Maybe, maybe not. The point is, I didn’t know. I didn’t know if, in becoming an archangel, I was going to lose everything I’d ever liked about myself.”
Sometimes he would catch himself staring at Dean more intently than he should—eyes narrowed, head cocked to the side—just praying that he’d have another flash of insight, so he could understand another tiny facet of this man.
This was how Cas had first seen him—knife in hand, looming over some poor soul. Back then, his eyes had been dead, despairing. Cruel in their emptiness.
Dean nodded again. “I just saw that ID badge and—those kids. There’s other ways, other things he could have done. Maybe he’d take the loss of his
He let out a little groan at the sheer size of him, and before he knew what he was doing, he’d sunk to his knees before him. He took the angel in his mouth, almost losing control at the taste of him. He heard Cas gasp, and looked up to see him leaning his hands against the counter, staring down at Dean, white-faced.
Dean sighed. He almost smiled. “Speaks well of you, I guess,” he said. “It means I found truckers who would give me money for…it means I let them have sex with me, Cas. And I did things to them, too. Whatever they wanted me to. For money.”
up. But I wouldn’t listen. Then I got here and within ten minutes I’d clocked him right in the jaw.”
Dean grinned, leaning back in the chair. “You seem like the same old Cas to me. Brave and weird and awkward and—”
Witch — was pure enchantment. He was getting as sappy as Sam inside his own mind, and he didn’t even care. Having Cas was everything.
about you!” Garth exclaimed, first in line to crush them in a surprisingly strong hug, considering how lean and gangly he was. “And look at you both, all… Bess, fetch a blanket? Or two?”
Cas nodded and reined in, silently signaling Gabe to do likewise. Charlie also jumped down out of her basket, whining unhappily.
He moved his paw, and she quickly rolled over and regained her feet. He wondered what her particular abilities were. Familiars weren’t limited just to what the natural abilities of their form were. Influenced, yes. Cougars were excellent stealth hunters, could remain still for hours, lying in wait for prey to appear. Their night vision was excellent. Colors were more muted when he was in his shift, but he could still tell them apart. Foxes… he didn’t know any fox Familiars, so he didn’t know what they could do, beyond the basics she’d taught him.
He stretched, reaching ahead with his large paws, then settling back, feeling his muscles lengthen, his joints pop. He flexed his claws, unsheathing them, letting them bite into the soil, releasing the rich loamy scent of the earth.
“Since it’s of no consequence, that is correct. It doesn’t hurt.” Cas had spent a lot of energy choosing not to notice just how attractive Dean Winchester was. The best approach was to focus on the other part of her question. “Yes, we’ve practiced. It only makes sense to do so. It feels like we’ve lost some ground against the corruption since we lost Nora. I didn’t want to delay. Besides, there’s little enough to do when traveling. It was a good opportunity to learn how to work together without the distractions of everyday life on the frontier.”
Cas took a breath and squared his shoulders. He’d never truly enjoyed being the center of attention, but there was no help for it tonight. He and Dean were the ones with the information, and Dean didn’t have a long enough history with the community to command the same authority that Cas and Gabe did. He’d quickly gained respect, but there was a difference.
She led him through the interior doorway to a short hallway to another door which opened into a handsomely appointed office.
Their fight brought them back to the entrance of the cave, snarling and rolling, both trying to get and keep control over the other. The woman in black shouted, her own rage mere background noise. Dean shifted to avoid another swipe of the bear's giant paw, twisting his muscles. He ignored the wrenching pull; there was no time to indulge strained muscles. The bear roared. Dean's ears were ringing, but under the ringing was a low, tortured, grinding sound. That... something was wrong about that. He looked up overhead just in time to see the rock of the cave's roof cracking, splitting, a fissure streaking through the stone like a bolt of lightning across the summer sky.
“We can’t lose communication entirely,” Dean protested. “I’ve written back home with information on what has been happening here, and what comes back might be useful.”
“Cas?” He started to wonder if the outpost was ready for Dean Winchester, and suspected the answer was no.
It was only then that Cas realized how close they were to each other, and how few clothes they each wore. That knowledge became more acute as he struggled to sit up and Dean reached an arm around him to offer assistance.
“Sharing a real room with just one other person sounds like luxury accommodations after being cooped in the stage for two weeks. The train before that was marginally better. At least I had room to stretch out my legs.”
He was horrified. Seeing Bobby like this… seeing Rufus like this… Dean didn’t know Rufus as well as he knew Bobby, but what he did know he liked.
sneeze with his human senses, it could be enough to knock Dean back on his ass. Cas knocked at the door. “Gabriel? I know you’re there.”
about her that made the hair on his tail stand on end. If he’d been a longer-haired cat it would look like Charlie’s brush tail.
“Yes. The corruption stopped actively spreading  about a hundred years after it struck, but its effects linger. Gradually the healthy lands to the east of the Great River have begun to reclaim the corrupted land, so now it is at least survivable. However, there are still virulent pockets that must be contained and then eliminated in order to truly make the frontier habitable again.”
Dean nodded in understanding. He wondered… was something like that possible for him and Cas? They fit together so easily that it was sometimes difficult to remember this was a temporary bond.
“We’re going to miss you, buddy,” Dean told the horse. “We’ve been through a lot together. You, me and Cas. We don’t have the funds to get a stock car for you on the train back to New Avalon. Besides, they need you more here, huh? Especially with all the new people flooding in.”
Cas stumbled out from under Dean and banged against the wall as he ran downstairs. His head was pounding, but he couldn’t worry about that now. “Who? Charlie. Who?”
He looked across to Dean. “In any event, that was the beginning of my experience with magic. I was immediately fascinated with it.”
Cas inhaled deeply and braced himself for what was to come. Besides brief periods of Charlie’s assistance, he had been cut off from the greater grid of power for months, compounding the grief of losing Nora.
Charlie put a placating hand on his shoulder and lightly squeezes. “You’re overly tired, Gabe. Go to sleep.”
Charlie got up, stretched, and licked Gabe’s hand briefly before finding her own pouch and disappearing briefly. When she returned she sat down cross-legged near the fire. “Thank you for providing,” she told Dean. “Antelope is good. I saw you take it down. Very efficient.”
“You haven’t talked a lot about what you left behind,” Charlie observed, quietly, in such a way that left it open for him to continue on the topic or not, as he preferred.
“Now Castiel,” Garth soothed. “Put away the lightning and eat a cookie. No one is going to give Dean to the bad lady.”
Cas rolled up his sleeves. “I’ll need some water,” he said, his voice gruff. “We need to clean him up, see what exactly we’re dealing with here. Dean… I apologize in advance. I may not be as controlled as I usually am when I am drawing strength from you.”
“Oh, hey, Cas.” Dean smiled at the Witch as he walked into the house, already starting to strip off his filthy shirt.
“I’d already left the city when I met Gabe,” she offered, speaking softly. “It was east of here, and south. Down in Sainte Mareille, near the Gulf. I… got in a bit of trouble, stuck in a situation where Familiars were considered an abomination, Witches not much better. Gabriel got me out. I could tell that he was a powerful Witch, but he didn’t ask anything of me despite the fact it was obvious he had no Familiar. For me… I could tell, you know? Something about him resonated with me. He was just going to get me to safety and then leave me on my own, but I told him I wanted to stay with him. He wouldn’t take more than a working relationship at first, but I wore him down.” She chuckled. “And now, here we are. I’m not
Guilt and worry poured through the bond before Dean was able to clamp down on it. Cas looked up sharply, his own worry pushed through to the forefront.
The small house was crowded. In addition to the three Witches and their Familiars, Bobby, Jody, and Ellen were also present.
“Your wards strong enough to rely on without anyone staying up to keep watch?” Dean asked, watching Gabe. He could feel a faint tingle of the other man’s magic at work. Nothing like what he felt when Cas worked magic, but he wasn’t attuned to Gabe the same way. Even after this short of a time, he knew when Cas was working magic. Even this preservation spell he could feel as a whisper against his skin, like a puff of breath at the sensitive spot right behind his ear.
Underneath it all, souring the view, was the same feel of rotting, stagnant swamp Dean had gotten from that first patch of corruption he had come across. Only this was magnified to a tremendous degree.
Cas almost said no, but then thought better of it. “Would you check the wall, see if any of the stones are loose?”
“I can tell you now, but I would prefer to wait until Dean is here. He had a closer look at them. Also, I’ve called a meeting at the Saloon. This is something everyone needs to know.”
“It will be.” Cas sank into Dean’s hold. “I am simply tired. Gabriel is slightly appeased, but he’s going to be snappish for some time. He doesn’t get over things quickly or easily. I told him about the sigils; he wants to know more. Come back, get your proper bath and dress in proper clothes and then we can give him a preview before the meeting.”
Despite their promising first time, Dean has put their sexual relationship on hold for the last few months. Feeling like the first time was spurred on by the heightened emotions from almost dying, Dean wants Castiel to approach him when he’s fully ready to bring their relationship to the next level. Instead, Dean focuses on other experiences and truly enjoys Castiel’s company. He takes Castiel to the movies, they snuggle late into the night, they go out to eat in Lawrence, they take long drives in the Impala, and other safe platonic activities. They exchange soft kisses through the day, full of fondness and adoration… and dare Dean admit it to himself, love.
“Relax, we have time,” Castiel soothes. With Dean washed, Castiel allows himself to become entranced with water droplets running over Dean’s freckles. Freckle to freckle, his fingers follow a path down over Dean’s shoulders to his hands. His mates’ freckles were one of the first things he noticed about him, that and the way the fall sun illuminated the starburst of gold that sparkled in the moss green of his eyes. The Omega had cornered him in the Quad during Valentine’s Day weekend. Castiel had been awestruck, definitely tongue-tied while Dean had been sure, so cocky.
“We missed you after the first round of karaoke, you just disappeared… so did that devilishly good-looking guy, Cas was it?”
Dean is seeing stars, and he reaches out grounding himself by grasping at his Mate’s hips, encouraging the Alpha to snap his hips harder as he rises up to meet each thrust.
“Love,” Castiel starts and puts a comforting hand on the back of his mate's neck, massaging a little at the tight muscles, “Why are you up? You should be sleeping.”
“Cas,” Dean whines, watching his mate's fingers disappear into his mouth, eyes fluttering closed around the taste of Dean.
Cas could not resent her for wanting a busier life with more company. He was often alone with only his books for company. As a freelance writer he spent much of his time in silence, crouched over his laptop tip tapping at the keys for hours on end.
Laying in the middle of the field, Castiel the man, groans when Dean sinks to his knees next to him. He’s cut up pretty badly, but a shining light from within glows and his flesh knits up slowly before Dean’s eyes.
“So I can stay?” he questions, almost placing a hand on Dean’s back but pulling it back, “I’d like to stay. My older brother, Gabriel, is the only one I’ve ever met that has had a guardian before. No one has been claimed since the Dark Ages.”
With a soft secretive smile, Castiel nods and pulls Dean up. Hauling Dean to his feet with an easy move of the wrist.
Dean cradles Cas’ head with both hands. His thumbs running gently across the young dragon’s cheekbones. “Cas, stop sweetheart. Let’s take this inside.”
“Want to fuck me?” Dean asks unashamed, knowing what he wants. He’s been sexually active since he was sixteen, but it’s been a while since he’s had an Alpha knot him.
means Dean is angrily jerking off his clothes and chucking them into the corner of their bedroom. His desire to rail against his mate, to fight, has been building up for months. The catalyst today, a plain nondescript Thursday after St. Patrick’s Day, is Dean's hangover and coming home to Cas's mess from a long and awful day of work. Dean wants to think his anger was triggered by seeing things just flung around carelessly, but really if he examines himself… his displeasure and ire have been slowly building ever since they moved to Florida for Cas’ graduate school.
Humming, Castiel fingers dip to focus on opening Dean up and then pauses. He stops, hastily popping off the bed and blindly grabbing for the lube from Dean’s dresser drawer. Letting out a small laugh, Dean stretches out sinking into the bed. He runs his hands down his legs and palms his dick, pumping it a few times. When Castiel settles between his legs, he runs his hands through his hair, down his neck, and then over Castiel’s shoulders.
Dean snorts and pushes back into Cas, eliciting a delicious groan from his mate. The air around them smells like sex and satisfied Alpha. He stills his movements though, because really he doesn’t want to be knotted forever pressed up against a puddle of his own cooling jizz against his beloved Impala.
Cas begins to thrust slowly, holding himself up by his arms so he can see where they join and enjoy the slick slide as he enters and retreats. Dean starts, the muscles in his thighs quivering as the head of Castiel’s cock knocks against his prostate.
One hand shoved in his pocket, Castiel greets everyone. Dean puts a calming hand in the middle of Castiel’s back when he hears the jingle of coins in Castiel’s pocket. Dean sees the rolling of Castiel’s wrist, knowing his dragon is taking comfort in his hoard.
Jo doesn’t quite kiss like what he’s always imagined… even as an Alpha, she’s a little submissive. He’s always thought his Alpha would be… well, he’d be a man. Big enough to push him around and really be able to dominate him. But, Dean can’t think too much about that, what’s important is that Jo is his Alpha and she wants to have sex with him right now.
The acrid smell of blood, piss, and mud fills Dean’s nostrils as he kneels before the Witch King. His knees sink into the cool muck as he holds his shoulders back, his hands tied behind him. The magical vines are pinching the thin skin of his wrists, cutting off circulation and making his fingertips tingle. He’s been stripped of his sword, his daggers, and his chain mail. The spring breeze cuts through his linen shirt and his leather jerkin. Sweat and blood from the battle cool on his skin, a trail of blood caresses down each vertebrae of his spine. The battlefield is silent, even the birds have stopped their twitter, instead the moans of dying men echo faintly across the landscape
Castiel starts to retort, to sooth Dean, to explain away the situation but Dean hushes him with a finger to Castiel’s lips. Dean lifts his chin and stares at Cas with defiance in his eyes, “You better believe that we are doing this, god damnit.”
“OH MY GOD!” a voice shrieks and then there is clattering of metal (shovels and rakes) that startles Dean and pulls him from the moment.
“Move, Cas, move Alpha, it gets better,” Dean commands, wrapping his legs around Cas’ bottom and drawing him even deeper. His Alpha pumps into him long, deep, thrusts and never quite works out a rhythm, but when his knot catches and pushes into Dean pleasure shoots through Dean so quickly that he orgasms again which causes Cas to spill deep within him. His Alpha moans and climaxes a few times, filling the condom until it slowly seeps out causing a mess between them.
“Stop moving,” Castiel warns, but his voice is also filled with laughter, “You are gonna make me come again and then we are gonna be tied forever out here in the garage.”
Castiel had slowly turned around showing his back with airy black wings and a tail. A tail? He had to get a closer look at this. Dean had stood up and studied Cas from every angle. He was beautiful. His wings were beautiful.
“Normally, the ceremony is in Enochian,” Castiel says holding on to the rope, fiddling with it lightly, “But I’d prefer English. So you can understand the vows we are speaking between us.”
Nothing else is said to Dean, but Castiel keeps one hand on him at all times. The low thrum of magic is buzzing in his ears, keeping the arousal swimming in his blood and pliant underneath Castiel’s hands. It is not until he’s following behind Impala once again, away from the large army and the other royalty, that his mind clears. Shaking his head to clear it , he stumbles and Castiel looks back. He halts the horse and pulls on the rope that is fastened around Dean’s neck. Steadying his feet, Dean passes his jailer unseeing but the thoughts are rushing through his head. Castiel tips his own water skin into Dean’s mouth, wiping away the water that escapes with a hand.
“Basically in the middle of campus, Dean,” Sam answers and then counters with a quick, “Wait! No, I’ll come with you,” when Dean starts blindly leaving Sam behind, “Lemme get my shoes and coat on, Dean! Damnit. Fuck. Of course, of course this happens on Valentine’s Day. It’s freezing.”
“Thanks,” Sam retorts, glad to be rid of those creepy Alphas, and pushes Dean to the C wing. They climb the third floor in pretty much silence, but his brother stops him at the top of the floor.
Dean shakes his head, the memories of last night causing him to chuckle to himself. The guy’s name had been Cas, the girls had got it right. In fact, Dean had left Cas curled up in his own bed, in his rectory, just down the road after he had extracted a promise that he would still be here when Dean got back.
Dean is rendered incoherent as he wraps his arms and one leg around his dragon in an effort to get even closer. Dean feels that if he were able to crawl inside this man he would still not be close enough.
“Yes,” Cas steps toward his Gram and rests his hands on the back of her chair. “I know, I was just coming to talk to her about her inappropriate use of such a vital service. Pamela, the Manager let me know yesterday that Gram had called you inadvertently several times. Please accept my apologies, we admire the Firefighters and would never knowingly stop you from your work..”
“Dean, our whole family have been guardians, Bobby’s family too. From the beginning of history up to your grandparents.” She looks around the table to catch Bobby’s eye. He gives a nod, and the set of his shoulders settle, as he gets up and darts into his mother’s office.
“Whatcha doing here?” Dean questions out loud to the slow blinking eyes of his new friend, “Not that I mind you visiting, but a man’s gotta have his coffee.”
“Do we need to leave? Or are you going to keep this PG?” Gabe asks, and Dean rips his eyes off of his mate to look at his brother. Sammy looks deeply uncomfortable and it makes Dean stop in his tracks, his pup, his brother is honestly worried.
Cas passes his Gram the pendant, and she takes it and loops the chain over her head, allowing the pendant to rest on the fuzzy wool of her pink pullover.
Castiel’s hands tease the back of Dean’s thighs and butt as he steadies him on the ladder. He’s supposed to be cleaning out the detritus in the gutters, instead Dean’s too busy cursing those damn squirrels for building a treasure trove of nuts in his gutter and telling Cas to cut it out. His little dragon is frisky. Long fingers playfully digging into the meat of his ass. It feels delicious, creating little sparks of arousal in his blood.
“That’s only the beginning, sunshine. If you want, there are many more things we can do when you’re ready,” Dean jokes. Spreading out on the blankets underneath him with Castiel on one elbow peering down at Dean.
Tears well in his eyes and Dean nods, a messy sob breaking from his chest. Dean cries, curling around Cas. He cries and Cas holds him, sniffling himself because he’s not immune to Dean’s distress.
“Heat leach,” teases Dean, but Cas just presses closer to him and hums a noncommittal noise. Dean sorts the clothing, smelling like cedar from the chest, between Castiel’s legs with Cas pressed up close to his back.
“Jesus,” Sam hisses between his teeth, “He lectured me before you drove out here, Dean. Told me to be a good Alpha, watch out for you. And now, now you think you’ve found your Alpha. God, he’s going to be so pissed.”
Dean leans against the sink, literally holding his sides as he laughs, his stomach muscles hurting and his cheeks aching. He cannot remember the last time he laughed with such absolute abandon, but this little dragon, Folgers, he reminds himself, takes the cake.
It’s a beautiful sunny day with a blue sky overhead as Cas and Dean leave the bunker in the Impala. Dean slots Metallica into the ancient tape player, as Cas leans back into his seat with a sigh.
His solemn eyes stare steadily at Dean, while the man dragon fiddles with the sheets and blankets in his hands, “My apologies, Dean. We may have had a misunderstanding. You had the symbol hanging outside your door welcoming dragons inside and I was looking for refuge. But… I’ll go.”
“Only a few months, right?” Cas asks, so quiet, so pathetic… that it makes Dean’s a few tears slip out from the corner of his eyes. He wipes them away quickly not wanting his Alpha to see.
“Cas, knock it off, the torque wrench doesn’t go there...You know that!” Dean can’t help but laugh at his dragon. Cas is in a particularly playful mood, and is enjoying pretending he doesn’t know where the tools go or what they’re for. Dragon and Keeper have descended into pointy finger rib jabs as they dance around each other playing keepings off with a pair of jumper cables.
“Yes, that is definitely not enough time for my knot to go down,” Cas whines as Dean unzips his pants and frees his erection.
“Of course, man. I’ll be back before you know it,” Dean tries to chirp out, trying but failing to keep up the mood. They haven’t exchanged numbers, so Dean takes the moment to exchange numbers right then and there. Dean tries his best to ignore Cas’s poor shaking hands. His Alpha’s fingers are so long, elegant, and tan. He kisses Cas and his poor little Alpha holds onto him so tightly, desperately.
They eat breakfast unhurriedly, bashful smiles are exchanged. Castiel’s hands wander teasingly across Dean’s shoulders and down the sensitive skin on his arms, and Dean leans into his touch. When the dregs of coffee are consumed from his second favorite mug, Dean’s favorite coffee mug still contains Castiel’s hoard, the men end up outside.
“Dean, stop.” Cas turns Dean and tucks blankets around them more firmly. Cas leans up on an elbow and looks down at Dean who is firmly tucked against his chest. His words soft, his voice deep and rumbly, “I don’t know what is going through your head but don’t pull away, you need to stay warm. And I’m sorry, but all my instincts are screaming at me to protect my new guardian, to comfort you, and to reassure us both that you are the most important thing in my life.”
“Officer Winchester, I apologise for my Grandmother’s behaviour, I am not sure what has gotten into her.”
Dean sets his booted foot on Cas’ scaly knee and looks to his dragon to see if he is doing the right thing. Cas huffs his approval, as his tail waves gently in the long grass causing it to ripple and sway. Cas lifts his knee and assists his keeper to climb up and settle himself between two neck ridges. Dean grasps at the spiny ridges to stay seated as the dragon gives a mighty heave and launches himself towards the sky.
Dean looks over at the dragon for confirmation to find that he has left the coffee cup and is exploring the countertop. Emptying out his pockets of his work overalls, Dean finds a handful of small change, lint, and a gas station receipt. Without thought, the coins go into a jar on the counter, and the lint and receipt are cast into the trash. The coins clank loudly into the glass, making his new friend stand on his back legs. With wide eyes, Folgers beelines for the coins. Dean laughs to himself and mutters, “Well, what d'you know.”
“I don’t know how to skate,” Castiel states, shyly but his eyes never quite waver from the kids zipping around the large pond shouting and giggling at each other.
“Yes, well, it was a long time ago. An arranged marriage by Michael, but Daphne and I were friends. She left a hole in my life regardless of the nature of our marriage. That is why I asked Michael for you, I was in want of a friend… a companion. We are similar in age and from the same sort of society, I hate court and my servants are too frightened to engage in lengthy conversations. Michael will not permit me to marry again until he has children of his own. And honestly… I am lonely, Dean.”
Someone in the back starts a slow clap that spreads to most of the other customers, Dean grins and makes his way back to his Mate in a swell of applause. High on endorphins and the satisfaction of putting an asshole in his place. He feels the heat on his face with so many people watching him now, but Castiel’s gaze anchors him.
They were all used to Nora flying scouting patterns. It was going to take some getting used to, figuring out new routines.
“Most of the buildings, too. It was mostly a collection of sod houses when I got here. They worked well enough for what they were, but there’s more trees around here than flat grassland. Made more sense to start going wood.”
Just as he stepped up onto the stoop, Cas sneezed as a pungent odor assailed his nostrils. Good thing Dean wasn’t with him. If it was strong enough to make
“Sam?” Mary Sandra Campbell Winchester’s voice floated down to them from the back of the house, shortly followed by the woman herself. “Have you seen your brother? Oh, there you are. Dean. I’ve gone and negotiated space for one more trunk for you. You’ll want some luxuries on top of the necessities. If you don’t go off and choose your own soap I’m packing for you. Apple blossom would be lovely. Maybe some lavender.”
Gabe grinned, his eyes sparkling with mischief. “That’s where you’re wrong. It’s always Cassie. But I was talking to your mail order Familiar here, not you.”
Dean frowned at that. “That seems backwards to me. Even if you don’t have a bond or a contract, there’s benefits to working with the same person until you get it figured out. A close friend is an excellent mentor. I worked with my father a lot, even though he was, of course, bonded to my mother. Once Sammy got old enough I started working mostly with him, under their guidance."
“You too, Charlie Bradbury.” He shook her hand. “I’m not much for canines, but already feeling myself make an exception for you.”
“You ready to try this out, then?” Dean asked as he moved back towards the fire, and Cas. “Keeping it simple rather than pushing ourselves, right? For now.”
“Good thought, Gabriel. Thank you.” Cas looked at his brother, then opened his arms. Gabe stepped into them, and they embraced. “You take care of yourself as well as Willow River. I expect to see you well when we return.”
Dean froze. Cas watched with infinite patience as he attempted to come up with alternate explanations for the steady hum of want that Cas projected through their bond. Finally Dean dragged his gaze away from his hand curled around Cas’ ribs to meet the Witch’s gaze.
Not half bad? That was a weak compliment, if it was even intended as a compliment. “I thought basic exercises, to become accustomed to working together. Small spells and incantations. Usually I frown on using magic to do the sorts of tasks that are as easily accomplished using hands and other physical means, but in this case there’s a purpose beyond what the magic is actually doing. So untangling Smoky’s mane and tail, working with the campfire, other such workings. Have you much experience partnering with a Witch?”
“Yeppers, I certainly do. I can take care of that. See you tonight at the Saloon? I know everyone wants to meet Dean. See what the cat drug in. Hah.” He laughed, amused by his own joke.
Cas’ hand dropped to rest on his head, lightly scratching at the base of his ears in the way he’d learned very early on Dean absolutely adored.
They’d already skipped ahead in some respects, while testing the communication limits, but resetting wasn’t a bad idea.
“People will come whether or not anyone formally allows it,” Cas spoke, his words weary. “There are always those who need a new start, those who hunger for opportunity, those who look westward with stars in their eyes and dreams of self-made wealth. Those who must escape an untenable situation.”
While clean magical energy felt crisp and clean like the first bite of winter in the high mountain air, the energies surrounding the ooze felt like rotting vegetation in stagnant swamp water.
Cas took a long drink from the glass Dean had poured. “Actually I may have misspoken,” he said, feeling warm from the alcohol. His head felt pleasantly muddled. He was home, he was safe. He could let his guard down, at least a little. “I have felt attraction, just not the desire to do anything about it immediately. The risk of rejection and the attendant humiliation have always been too high.”
Sam smacked him. Dean smacked him back, and soon they were rolling on the ground wrestling. Mary rolled her eyes and went back inside.
It was. They both knew it. But Dean still nodded in agreement, pushing down the sudden ache of homesickness. He hadn’t even left yet. He had no business being homesick.
Gabe’s scrying revealed that a storm was due the next day, which left everyone hunkering down in the Saloon, keeping each other company with cards and tales, even some music when Max and Alicia brought out their instruments. The day after that was clear skies in every direction. The sun was barely peeking up over the horizon as Gabe, Charlie, Dean and Cas headed out of the gates towards the west.
They discovered that mental communication tapered off around a mile apart from each other, which was not bad range considering. As they worked more together, strengthened the link between them, that would only grow. And, if they ever chose a more permanent bonding, that range would increase exponentially.
not to go off half-cocked. Try telling me what you did wasn’t the same or worse than anything I’ve ever done. I dare you to try and justify yourself.”
“He will be. The spell he channeled through your bond was powerful, the most powerful spell I’ve ever seen, honestly. He pulled in so much energy that he was literally glowing. His eyes were shining. Then, when you opened the link and he pushed it through… he didn’t hold anything back. Nothing at all. He collapsed. He’s okay, though. Gabe checked him over, and so did I.”
Dean went to get it. “Come on, you can shift back at our place — and then you both can tell me what the hell you’re doing out here when you’re supposed to be back in New Avalon.”
“I have those dime novels for you, Bobby.” Cas told him. “I did not want to leave them in with the other supplies where they might get ripped or damaged in other ways. I couldn’t find any of the Doc Everston series but did find a tidy supply of Dangerous Desperados…” he finally trailed off when he caught that Bobby was trying to shush him.
Her gaze turned more assessing, then she nodded once, briskly, and stood up, her skirts rustling with the movement. “And your name?”
Cas made a small sound of understanding. There was a lot of history there. He wasn’t certain how much he was willing to share, quite yet.
“You’re starting to worry me, man. I would really appreciate it if you woke up right about now.” Dean finished cleaning the wounds and placed his palm on the center of Cas’ chest. “I’ve been trying hard not to notice, but you’re kind of beautiful, you know.” He huffed a laugh, his thumb lightly stroking warm skin. He found the cleanest parts of cloth to rewrap the bandage, then settled in to try and get a little rest. They needed food, but that could come later. He was exhausted.
The next instant, Castiel found himself sitting on his ass in the dirt, blinking away the spots in his vision. Dean laughed in the background. That was more power than he expected.
“Then I think you’ll like my honey apple pie,” Donna said. “I made some this morning. We figured you’d be arriving today, or maybe tomorrow. It’ll keep one day, as long as I can keep the grubby paws of Willow River’s residents out of my kitchen. Meaning no offense, of course. I’m sure your paws aren’t grubby.”
He made Dean sit on a fallen tree trunk while he tended to the wounds on his arm. “Evidence would suggest that it is indeed you that she’s targeting,” he commented as he dabbed at the deep bite marks. Dean winced. “I’m not sure how she’s tracking you.”
“A crude method of communication that Gabriel and I developed some time ago,” Cas replied. “Gabriel holds a matching set. Each stone is paired with one of Gabe’s.”
“I’m writing to Sam. I’m going to send him a copy of the sigils we found, see what he can make of them.” Dean shuffled some papers and handed the sketches over for Cas to look at.
“Makes sense. Did it feel like you can work together well?” Charlie had been Gabe’s partner for going on three years now. They’d gotten together before making the decision to come to the frontier, forming the permanent bond after a mere six months. They worked very well together, complementing each other, their thought processes surprisingly similar.
. He hadn’t known the man long, but he already felt like family, more than anyone other than Cas himself. Maybe Charlie. Possibly, remotely possibly, Gabe. But definitely family.
By the time Cas made it up to join him on the tower, the rider was close enough it was clear what was wrong with him even to the naked eye. Black veins crawled up his neck, across his cheeks, up into his hairline.
Existing in a sort of haze, time passed as Cas methodically unwound and burned out every tangled, oily thread of corruption twining through Bobby’s body, until Cas stumbled upright and backed away from the cot. “That’s all I can do for him,” he said, his voice low and grumbly. “It’s up to him now.” He took a deep breath and turned towards Rufus. He set himself, and walked forward. Dean could feel the determination in his Witch, the steel backbone.
He didn’t jump back quickly enough. He twisted just enough that claws raked across his ribs rather than gouging into the soft flesh of his stomach. A second swipe as he fell backwards caught his thigh. Pain seared through him. He fought to stay aware, but the charm meant to stave off corruption relied on his own life force. Dean’s answering roar was the last thing he heard before he dropped into unconsciousness.
“Nora, yes. We weren’t together like that, though. Friends.” She sighed, looked out over the river. Her normally cheerful demeanor turned sad, wistful. “Her Shift form was a crow. Having a flying Familiar has some advantages. She was able to scout from the air, see the places where the vegetation was dead or dying, then direct Cas or Gabe to the spot so they could purify the area.”
“Probably not,” Dean agreed easily. “But neither is staying here. We still have patrols to run. You and Gabe haven’t stopped going out on your patrols.”
“Surrender the Familiar!” An unnaturally loud and distinctly feminine voice boomed from the rider. “This is your one warning.”
Ahead, a swath of death consumed a patch of the forest floor. There was no other word for it. A foul-smelling ooze leaked from multiple wounds in a mound on the forest floor, killing everything around it. The normal healthy green of trees and grasses was eradicated, replaced with dead brownish-purple vegetation.
Gabe narrowed his gaze. Cas agreeing with him made it impossible to argue, which in turn frustrated him — but at the same time, made him calm down. Slowly, Cas had to admit, but it did work. Eventually.
“You should rest some more,” Dean suggested. He began to pull away. Cas gripped Dean’s hand and guided it to once more lay flat against his skin. Away was the last thing that Cas wanted.
“Then I will bring my own travel desk down and copy these drawings for our library.” He brushed Dean’s hair back from his forehead and leaned in for one more small kiss. “I will be back.”
“You’re really settling my worry over him blaming me for everything there, Cas.” Dean let go of Cas’ hand just in time to catch Charlie as she leapt up into his arms. She chirruped and whined in distress even as she nipped and licked at Dean’s face, her ears flattened to her head and her tail puffed out.
Dean handed the saw over. “Charlie says you were one of the first people to settle here,” he commented. He figured that was a safe question to ask. It didn’t touch on why he was here. Just that he’d been here for a while. “Were you involved in building the stockade, then?”
Gabe looked at him sharply, then scanned him top to toe once more. “You’re damned lucky you’re more or less functional right now. All right. We’ll wait for Dean.”  The sparks eased back, but Gabe’s regard focused in a different, more acute way. “Something else has changed, too.”
Cas couldn’t quite stifle the satisfaction at knowing he had won. So easily, too. The ‘eyebrow thing’ definitely worked. Gabe called it his smug bastard face.
“The unwritten rule is that so long as you don’t cause problems here, what you did before you got here is your own business,” Gabe said. “Don’t ask. If someone wants you to know, they’ll tell you.”
“I came with two horses. One for each of us and also a mule as a pack animal. The pathway doesn’t easily accommodate a wagon with any sort of speed,” Castiel replied.
“It was damned stupid!” Gabe snapped, the ends of his hair swirling in a frenzy. “You’d drained yourself past the point of caution, as you always do. You need to have a care for yourself, too. You use yourself up and you’re no good to anyone!”
He was quick and sure with the measurements he made, moving without hesitation to cutting the wood into appropriate lengths.
As soon as they were out of the door, Gabe joined them, reaching up to squeeze Cas’ shoulder. He looked down at Dean. “He needs to sleep,” Gabe said. “He’s not going to want to, but he needs to. I’ll take care of… the rest of what needs taking care of.” His eyes glinted with a hardness Dean had never seen there before. It made him shiver. Suddenly he understood on a visceral level what Cas had always told him. Gabe was a force to be reckoned with underneath the joking exterior.
Dean came further into the room, blinking owlishly. “Not bad,” he said, voice rough with disuse. “Better than sleeping on the ground like we did on the way in, at least in human form. Do I smell coffee?”
Charlie’s tinkling laughter always brought a smile to Cas’ face, and was the reason he didn’t really mind sharing his embarrassment with her.
“I hear ya,” Gabe said. “It’s not a quick and easy task. West of the river… that’s something we’ll have to nibble at once we get the eastern side clear. It’s been there for centuries. It ain’t going away in a year. Or even a decade. But it won’t happen at all if we don’t start.”
The description he had received of Dean Winchester was frustratingly brief. Mid-twenties, fit, shifter form suitable for frontier work. It was barely more information than that yes, he meets criteria stated in the ‘Wanted’ advertisement. The length of time it took correspondence to make a round trip, however, would mean that the Familiar himself would arrive before Balthazar’s reply to a demand for more information. He suspected his cousin believed himself to be amusing with the brevity of information provided. Though he did not expect a reply in a timely manner, he spent a good hour of his time here at the settlement penning a response that was in turns grateful for conducting the interviewing and scathing for the dearth of detail in the report of hire.
Dean snorted at that one. “Figures. Hey, that’s slightly better than ‘Outpost Three,’ I will give you that. I would have gone with a portmanteau. Wiver, maybe. Rivows. Rivollow.”
“You’ll be able to conceal yourselves better if you head off on foot,” Gabe suggested. He brought his hand up to cup the back of Charlie’s neck, a gesture of support and comfort.
Cas just shakes his head as he searches for words. “I don’t know. Not really. It affects you worse than it does me, doesn’t it.” That wasn’t a question. He could feel that Dean was barely holding on. “The energy you’re feeding me... it’s still clean, but I can tell that’s because you’re forcing it to be. We don’t need to stay here. You’ve seen it. We can leave now.”
Cas suppressed a groan. By sitting right away, Gabe was clearly leaving the floor to Cas, and any hope he had that his brother would lead this discussion vanished.
Cas nodded towards Dean in thanks, silently impressed with his adaptability. He took another breath, re-centering himself, then began to shape their magic. He worked it along the edges of the corruption, cleansing it. He chose a starting point, then gradually worked in a tightening spiral until he reached the point where it bubbled to the surface,
“No, Dean. We both know I can draw more from you when you are shifted, and the energy is purer. I need that.”
“He told me then that everything I’d been taught about Witches and Familiars was wrong. Well, not everything. Just the important parts about how the relationship between them was supposed to work. He told me Otto was dead, and forced me to really think. He left again, but told me where I could find him in one week’s time. He told me to really look and listen.”
Fuck! He leapt off of the bear and sprang backwards, away from the cave, just as the rock crumbled and collapsed. The bear wasn't so fortunate. It roared in agony as it was crushed beneath the rocks, the sound echoing back and forth in the cave before it abruptly silenced. When the dust settled he could see that the cave was mostly blocked, now. He could still see the woman through gaps, her arm raised, fingers clenched in a fist that sparked.
She thought about that for a moment. “There is a bit of a backlog on charms. No one really trusts the ‘extra features’ Gabe adds to  his.”
Broad shoulders filled out his dark red work shirt, and his arms were muscular without having the bulges of a blacksmith. His waist and hips were narrow, his legs slightly bowed. But the truly breathtaking aspect was his face, perfectly proportioned. His hair was overly long, a middling brown with golden sun streaks.
The other residents of the house were currently out. Dean was used to taking time on his own, so living in close quarters with three other people was an adjustment. This was nice, to have the afternoon here with Bobby the only other one around.
Dean rolled his shoulders. “Probably not, but let’s do this anyhow. Lead the way.” He glanced at Charlie and thought about how the touch of his Witch was a very good idea right now. He followed through on that idea by reaching out to clasp his hand with Cas’.
“Aren’t we always.” Dean brought the food over to a fallen log and began to unwrap it. He broke a pocket pie in half, took a sniff. “Venison and carrot. Nice.”
“You might not want to hear this, Charlie,” he flicked his eyes in her direction, then went back to carefully brushing the dust out of the horse’s coat, “but I’m not actually sorry I went. I could have handled it better, no lie. Even so.”
“No,” Cas stated firmly. “No. We are not turning Dean into the final battlefield. It could kill him.”
“I don’t want to rest anymore,” Cas told him, voice low and husky with want. It was easy to be confident when he could feel Dean’s answering desire just under a thin veneer of uncertainty.
She laughed and hugged him, pressing a kiss against his cheek. “Happy for you,” she murmured. “So happy.”
Cas glanced over at Dean, quickly, with affection. The bond was new enough that even under these circumstances, he couldn’t help but react with pleasure when it was mentioned.
“We first met about a year before coming to Willow River. Charlie introduced us, in Sainte Mareille. So that would make it a little over two years, in total, between the time we first met and the time she died.” The sorrow was tinged with regret, now. “She may have been better served had she never met me.”
“He passed out afterwards,” Gabe volunteered. “Slept for a day and a night. Freaked Dad out, though Mom just shrugged and said he’d wake up when he was ready to.”
Rufus shrugged his shoulder. “This is good, honest work. Hard work. But good. And nowhere else to be, really.” He smiled, then, his eyes crinkling at the corners with amusement. “Definitely interesting. You see things here you’d never see anywhere else, you know? The corruption, most of the time, its effects are creepy. Deer with glowing red eyes. The pulsing black vein thing. That’s the worst.”
Dean stood there, his long black-tipped tail slowly swishing from side to side, powerful haunches relaxed. He was magnificent, a large tawny-coated cougar with the same grass-green eyes as his human form. Muscles rippled under his short summer coat. “Oh. You are
Just then Cas arrived, his hair wet, his shirt still unbuttoned. Dean’s gaze skittered for a moment at the sight of all that bare skin. He swallowed. “Heya, Cas.”
“Yes ma’am.” Dean slid his hands into his pockets. “You’re going to have to tell me what draff is, first.”
High summer, the trips were more frequent now. Willow River was expecting a visit any day. Spending time in the gardens gave Dean the benefit of being near should they arrive, leaving Gabe and Cas to their quality time, and getting on Ellen’s good side. Weeding was an unpopular task, and always needed.
“These,” Gabe pointed out as his fingers tapped against the cover of one of the thicker volumes, “are not books that would have been left out where you could see them. Some of these are very old. They have been in the Angelus family for generations.”
“I’m here,” Dean agreed. He moved forward and brushed the softest of kisses against Cas’ brow, opening the link between them, flooding Cas with love and comfort. Cas sighed. It felt so good, so unbelievably good.
Dean nodded. If he weren’t feeling so overwhelmed he’d smile at that. No question about whose ideas were methodical and whose were fantastic.
Gabe considered that. Usually they didn’t do that; keeping their only two Witches together was risky. He nodded. “Yeah, we need to learn to work together before we face something where we
And Donna? Donna was cheerful, but in a different way from Charlie. She was dressed a bit more neatly, though still practical, with her long blonde hair twisted up and clipped with a hair comb that was decorated with realistic looking morning glories that were a little too perfect to be truly real.
Dean’s sudden predatory stillness pulled at Sam’s attention far more effectively than Cas’ tone. He finally paused to look up and meet Cas’ eyes.
“You didn’t. I can tell the difference between when you’re working quieter healing magics and when you’re fixing something that’s desperately wrong, or defending us. This… this was peaceful, you know? Wanted to see what you were up to.” He quirked a grin. “Besides, we talked about this yesterday. Thought you were going to bring me along.”
Cas nodded. “I have since come to learn that is the more commonly accepted method. However, that is not the way things were done in our household.”
Cas scowled at him. “This. This is why I don’t... why I haven’t... I am not good at it.” He slumped, discouraged.
Dean actually hadn’t been upstairs yet, which... he didn’t think he was forbidden, but he hadn’t been invited, either, and he knew better than to invade the privacy of Witches without an explicit invitation.
“Anyhow. I’ll leave you now. Get some more sleep. If you’re well enough we’re heading back to Willow River in the morning.”
“It is not generally I who makes the trip to town, no,” Castiel answered. “My talents are needed elsewhere, but if you enjoy it we can make a point of it on occasion.”
“Hello,” Bess said, her voice soft and quiet, her head demurely lowered. “Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Winchester.” She took control of Red, patting her nose affectionately and murmuring into her ear.
“The pleasure is mine. I cannot begin to express my gratitude at your willingness to come here to work with me. I look forward to learning how this partnership will manifest. Shall we collect your luggage? I have a room at the boarding house, if you are amenable to sharing.”
Dean shuddered. “So what’s the goal, here? To keep it from spreading? Or to open up the frontier for further settlement? I’d always heard the latter, but… fuck, man. I can’t see letting people live here. Way too dangerous.”
“Samuel is a frequent name in the Campbell history. It’s complicated. I know that much. She’s never really explained all of her reasoning. Their reasoning, because obviously my father went along with it. Where did Castiel come from? Never heard that one anywhere else.”
“Yes, Dean.” Castiel rolled his eyes. “Your apparent priorities are in line with the other residents.”
Cas and Dean headed back to the house. Cas led the way up the narrow staircase to the second floor. Dean looked around with unbridled curiosity. Cas tipped his head sideways. “Have you not been up here before?”
“Yes.” Cas waited for her, going down on one knee. She bounded into his arms, rubbing against him happily, yipping and nipping at his hair.
“She didn’t really have anywhere else to go.” He drew small patterns on the cover of his book with the tip of his index finger. “You know her shift form was a crow, right? She loved to fly, loved pretty things. Transporting that tea set out here was a challenge, but she couldn’t bear to part with it. It was her mother’s, and it was beautiful. Gabe and I made sure to protect it with magical cushioning. It was extra work, but worth it. She liked to wear pretty things, as well. In most ways life here in Willow River didn’t suit her. She would have fit in better back in New Avalon society. She liked to do embroidery, too. She did the needlework on the placemats.” They didn’t bring them out often, but Dean had seen them, with their delicate floral patterns. “And the tea towels.”
