Dean sits down and takes a bite of food before hitting the talk button and putting the phone against his ear as it rings. He’s pretty sure he hasn’t eaten anything since dinner last night, but he doubts he could stomach more than a few bites now. Ellen’s threats are the only thing that keep him bringing the food to his mouth, chewing, and swallowing.
Dean’s heart stops. Next to him, Lisa shifts, her smile fading into concern. “Dean?” she whispers, and he takes a breath, grinning at her.
Chicago is playing as Dean tugs at Castiel’s hand, leading him towards the table, which is now set with food and drinks. Jo sends Dean an irritated look as they sit down, and Dean tsks, waving a hand at her. “Fine, you can go.”
Dean’s hands are shaking. He licks his lips and takes a deep breath before reaching back into the hat and pulling out two more slips of paper. This time, he doesn’t even register which names are actually written down before he announces, “Jo and Charlie.” Another cheer goes up, but this one is less gloating at someone else’s bad luck, and more excitement at their own good luck. Two pretty girls, one of whom is the birthday girl, locking lips in front of a crowd of teenage boys can only get one reaction.
Victor mutters something about this just being a complicated version of Spin the Bottle, and Charlie informs him that plastic doesn’t spin well, and there was no way she was going to be able to get a glass bottle with her parents chaperoning; it was hard enough to get them to leave the basement alone for an hour. Dean’s actually pretty impressed with how well she’s covered this. She winks when she hands Dean the hat, little strips of paper piled inside, then reclaims her seat next to Jo.
It’s probably better this way. Everything between them is so fucked up and tainted at this point that it may never be repaired, and dragging it on for too much longer would just make everything worse somehow.
“You both need to meet a nice pair of scissors,” Jo says, but she holds her arms out and squeezes Castiel tight when he accepts her hug, chastising him: “Don’t you ever let Dean pull you away from a welcome party again.”
“It might’ve been better. I wouldn’t have messed up with this whole Aaron thing, if you lived in town. And it would’ve been nice to go to school together and all that.”
Dean’s jaw tightens. The brothers glare at each other for a long second, until John clears his throat.
“He’s splitting his summer,” she says, sounding annoyed. “He’s spending the first part in Malibu, but he’ll be here for Independence Day.”
But Dean isn’t sober. He’s stupid drunk too. And they’re still mostly dressed, hidden under a blanket in the bed of his truck but Dean can hear the laughter and jeers of the audience they’ve attracted, mainly because Lisa is finally relaxed and ready enough to come from Dean’s cock alone. And she didn’t make any secret of it, laughing and sighing and shouting with her nails digging into Dean’s back.
And it grows. The more Dean thinks about it, the more he wonders what he’s missed, whether or not Cas has lied to him about anything from his feelings for Bela to whether or not he really cares about Dean’s poverty. And the larger the rift grows, the angrier Dean becomes.
“Being a little chickenshit!” Meg supplies helpfully, laughing in the distance as Cas grunts, probably shoving her away.
He heads to his room, quickly changing into a t-shirt and running shorts. When he re-emerges, Michael and Naomi are having a quiet conversation on the couch, and Michael gives him a little wave as he passes them.
Then again, he’d been so horrified by their conditions that maybe that overrode the rest. Their fear had been more palpable than anything else, and it’s hard to be aroused when struck by that electric scent.
Dean blinks himself out of it and stares at Cas, who almost defiantly meets his gaze. There’s a hint of pink on Cas’s cheeks, but it’s nothing compared to the storm brewing in his eyes.
If Dean feels a hot bit of satisfaction at the hurt little look on Meg’s face, well, nobody needs to know.
"You fucking crossed the line last night," Dean spits, standing up. It's too fast, and his head hurts, but he can't show any weakness now. He's had enough confusion for one day - he can't let Cas get under his skin again, even though there's already pain in those blue eyes. "I can't believe you'd fucking tattle to my mom like that, Cas!"
And if Dean’s kind, noble nature is his best part, then this is his worst. That casual, easy acceptance of rejection, as if he doesn’t think he deserves any of Castiel’s attention. It’d be manipulative coming from anyone else, but Castiel knows that that’s not how Dean is, and that kind of innocent honesty just breaks his heart. This is what makes Dean so dangerous, and Castiel can’t stop himself from reaching over and taking Dean’s hand. The surprise that crosses Dean’s face just makes Castiel feel even worse.
Castiel kisses the smile off his face, picking up where they left off earlier. Their teeth click together, and Castiel moves his hands to Dean’s jaw, trying to control the direction of the kiss. Dean hums and submits, allowing Castiel to lick into his mouth as his own hands slide down Castiel’s sides, finally resting low on his hips.
“Are you sure you’re not drunk?” Cas says slowly, giving Dean a once-over before gripping his shoulder and leading him further down the hallway.
Bela bites her lip, then grins. "Alastair, Azazel, Lilith, they know I'm in town for the summer. Whenever they go out to the woods, I get a call to join them. I could take you with me, next time they call." She lifts a hand to brush through Castiel's already unruly hair. A little voice in his head is trying to tell him she's playing with him; if Dean is a toy, Castiel can be one too. But he can barely hear it over the rush of delight that comes from her attention. He shifts in his seat and smiles.
Before Dean can respond, Castiel’s hands are on his hips, lifting them up and almost bending him in half. Dean yelps in surprise, his legs in the air, as Castiel inhales deeply. The scent of aroused alpha spikes, now more musk than honey, and Dean revels in it shamelessly. He wants to roll around in that smell until it’s embedded in his pores, mixed with his own scent to create something new and whole. That’s a prelude to mating, and maybe there is still some heat running through Dean’s system, because he doesn’t care. Scenting, biting, knotting, he
“Castiel.” And his blood runs cold, because that is his mother’s voice, and she doesn’t sound happy. “We need to speak with you. Open the door.”
His words hang in the air for a long time. There’s no movement. Dean stays on the couch, safe in the dark, until he hears Cas take a little breath, followed by the sound of the front door opening and closing. Then the sound of a car starting outside.
Dean is just scum. So why not waste his time with more scum? Why not blow off some steam by getting in a few fist fights until his head clears?
An empty, gnawing feeling grows in Dean’s stomach, climbing up into his chest and out through his arms and shoulders. He’s a terrible friend, setting Jo up like that. He’s a worse boyfriend, kissing Cas all the time. He’s a shitty, untrained artist and a poor student and he didn’t even know his little brother had broken up with his first girlfriend. What good is he for other people? Even when he tries to help, tries to get better, he fucks everything up.
All of the Milton children are expected to contribute to one of the family businesses once they’re done with school, and Michael is just the first to achieve those expectations. He’s also the only one who never really had issue with them. Gabriel has been studying marketing, but behind closed doors, he often expresses his disgust with the subject (though, if he’s honest with himself, Castiel finds the psychology behind the subject fascinating, is intrigued by the idea that people could be so easily defined and made predictable by their purchases alone). Lucifer is expected to study accounting, of all things, and he’s never made a secret of how stifled he feels by this decision. He picks fights with Michael or his parents as often as he has the opportunity.
“Then trust me when I tell you that you did nothing wrong,” Dean manages to say. He nods once, then turns away, ducking under the water to try and wash his skin clean. Castiel watches him for a moment, then catches himself and sighs, trying to find something to distract himself with. There’s nothing but the wind moving through the grass on the edge of the stream, spring flowers starting to bloom at the base of the trees. The sun leaves dappled shadows on the rocky embankment, and Castiel pulls himself up there to start drying off.
“It shouldn’t,” Sam whispers. “He should be just as angry as me. Angrier, even, since Dad doesn’t fucking get that Dean’s not some jock superstar with chicks falling all over him.” When Castiel looks at him curiously, Sam sighs and explains, “He never wants to hear about Dean’s artwork, but he
Castiel sighs, burying his nose in Dean’s neck. “But I wanted to say it,” he says, clinging to Dean’s shirt. “Because I do.”
That’s when Dean hears the sirens. Cas curses in his ear and starts dragging him off again, and Dean is too stunned to struggle this time. Someone called the cops. Someone actually, finally called the cops on one of these shindigs, and from a distance, he can see Alastair realizing what’s happening, dropping the charm and turning to Mary with anger. He can’t hear the conversation anymore, but he can see the way Lisa clings to Mary’s legs as Mary shouts right back.
“So more sneaking around town with your poor friends. Got it.” Dean grins when Castiel rolls his eyes. The others laugh uncomfortably, and Dean is reminded of just how much happened without them last summer. Pam was never sneered at by Michael. Jo was never called out for the holes in her jeans by Naomi. Dean’s not even sure if Naomi and Michael know anyone’s name but his.
his relationship with Cas is. He doesn’t know what it means, that they kiss and touch the way they do, even though Dean has a girlfriend, and Cas has whatever it is he has with Bela. But that’s the way it is, and whether or not it makes sense, Dean’s not willing to give it up.
“It’s not important, Dean-” She reaches for the DVD, but Dean holds it up over his head, out of her reach. She sighs and rolls her eyes before meeting his gaze. “Read what it’s about.”
So maybe their family is a little messed up, but at least they’re not completely broken. At least they’re all still together. And if Castiel has to spend his nights locked away in his room to get away from the fighting, then maybe that’s a fair price to pay.
“I was a knight, in my youth,” Castiel starts, deciding to focus on the three unknowns at the table. “I fought in a war, and was given a special post with honors. Eventually, I…”
Dean clears his throat and turns his eyes to the wet sand at his feet. “I tried to help Mom. Told her I loved her as often as possible, spent all my time with her instead of making friends, but y’know, I was only six. What does a six year-old know?” Dean rolls his shoulders and rubs at his chin, still refusing to look at Castiel. “I was still up one night when Dad got home, and he and Mom started fighting, and he grabbed her and pushed her, so y’know, I tried to protect her and I just… got in the way, I guess.”
-ness of this little underground room, then takes a seat on the floor next to the record player. “Do you actually listen to these records?” he asks, brushing his fingertips over the albums in the milk crates in front of him.
“I’m not mad,” Dean says slowly, his voice gruff. “She knew Mom too. If she wants to come, she can come.”
“I happen to be out with Dean and a few other people right now,” Castiel says quickly, “so unless you’ve got--”
“Dean.” Charlie reaches across the table to take one of his hands, smiling when he looks up at her. “Do you want me to call him?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas responds. “I hadn’t heard from you since the party, so I wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Cas has already picked out a table by the time Dean’s finished ordering, and Dean finds himself smiling again as he takes a seat on the bench next to Cas, who’s tapping his foot and humming tunelessly with the song playing overhead.
“A haircut is an option,” Bela says innocently. “You look so much better with that neat, military cut.”
Charlie hides her face behind the book anyway, and Jo takes the opportunity to lean over and poke Dean in the ribs. “Hey. Dean. Big brother. Best friend since we were in diapers.”
“Where do you work, Mrs. Winchester?” Castiel asks to be polite, but he doesn’t miss Dean’s frantic glance in his direction. His mother just shrugs and gives Cas a gentle smile.
He trails off, thinking of Hannah. Of Anna, his sister that he hasn’t seen in years. He glances down at his hands, turned palms up on either side of his soup bowl, and what little hunger he felt before evaporates as he tries to water down that awful, horrific day into something his potential future in-laws will accept, without completely lying to them.
Dean didn’t have to do this. He had forgiven Castiel without even thinking about it, and Castiel was already on the path to forgiving him as well. This is just Dean being
Lucifer huffs, and hides a smile behind his hand. He’s seemed happier these last few days, and has been almost accommodating to Michael. In fact, when Gabriel suggested they head into Sileas for the annual Independence Day festival, Lucifer had been the one to invite Michael to join them. Michael had just stared at him, confused, before refusing the offer to do some work by the pool. Lucifer hadn’t even been offended.
“My mother knows about us,” Castiel says flatly. “She overheard me talking to Anna about our date, and she called Michael to deal with the issue.”
But then Dean and his friends were out of reach, and Castiel remembers what it was that made Bela pay attention to him in the first place: they both know Dean. Dean might be at this… get-together, for lack of a better word. Suddenly, Castiel is smiling, moving with a bit more purpose, making his decisions with a bit more care.
He likes working at Bobby’s. He doesn’t get to do much, since he’s only sixteen and there are laws about how long Bobby can work him, but routine things like tire and oil changes are easy and he makes six bucks an hour and he gets to let his mind wander while he’s there. He doesn’t have to worry about drunk kids or bruised knuckles, he doesn’t have to think about how much he needs Lisa and Cas to get along, and he doesn’t have to think about his fight with Charlie. He can just get his hands dirty and drift for a while.
“The new Supernatural series is pretty good too,” Sam pipes up, after Rudolph has led into Frosty the Snowman and their pizza has been changed out for mildly burnt popcorn. “The brothers are prettier than I expected them to be, but everything seems loyal to the book so far.”
“You punish them,” Castiel says when Dean falls silent. “It’s your job to teach them a lesson about debt.”
"Me?" Dean colors slightly, turning away from Castiel's gaze. "Comic books." He clears his throat, focusing on his latest marshmallow. "Now you, Cas."
Castiel blushes, even though Jess scowls and reminds Dean, “I wouldn’t be able to smell him anyway.”
A bark of a laugh escapes from Castiel’s lips before he can stop it, and Dean frowns outright. “No, no, I mean, Balthazar’s blond. And he likes skinny jeans. He’s nothing like you.”
“I failed to mention something the last time I was here,” Dean says slowly. Castiel doesn’t move and his expression doesn’t change, but Dean can feel Charlie and Benny’s disapproving frowns even when he’s not looking at them. “I’m actually… kind of, a little bit… nobility.”
The words are trapped in Castiel’s throat, choked by embarrassment, but pride comes forth at Dean’s suggestion that he’s not ready. Dean doesn’t get to decide that--
“You guys do this every year,” Jo continues, “and we’re kind of sick of it. You’re so happy and excited to see each other, only for shit to blow up and make you avoid each other, so all we ever hear about is your drama, and I’m just not going to have it this summer. Okay? It’s bad enough that all my friends are leaving me-”
Naomi’s descriptions of Dean are much kinder than they were a few years ago - she even uses the word ‘angelic’ at one point, which nearly sent Castiel into shock, much to Anna’s amusement. But she still doesn’t know how Dean broke Castiel’s heart back in 2006.
Something dark and green churns in Castiel’s gut, and he doesn’t want to know what this is all about.
“You really hurt him this time, Dean. He’s been weird all summer, and I don’t know what the hell you did, but I think you finally broke it. No. He’s not going to speak to you.” Gabe shuts the door in Dean’s face and yells through it, “End of story.”
“If you say so.” Cas takes a deep breath, then gives a short, awkward wave. “Enjoy your movie,” he says, turning to leave. Lisa calls a good-bye to his retreating back before quickly wrapping both arms around Dean’s chest and pulling him into a tight hug, her head buried in his shoulder. Dean laughs softly, running a hand through her hair.
Dean doesn't reach for Castiel's hand once they're in the car and back on the interstate. Castiel misses his touch, but says nothing of it, instead leaning his forehead against the window to watch the scenery go by.
If Dean were a more poetic person, he probably would have wooed a classy girl like Lisa Braeden a long time ago. Because he knows she’s beautiful, he finds new ways to appreciate it every day, but he’s never really been able to tell her how beautiful he thinks she is. Jo and Charlie had insisted on a Disney movie marathon after finals, and when Aladdin struggled to describe Jasmine’s beauty to the Genie, Dean had really felt for the guy. It’s tough, trying to explain how beautiful someone is when you’re struck dumb just thinking about them.
He hesitates again, as if debating whether or not to kiss or hug Castiel, but ultimately it seems he’s picked up on the theme for today, and settles for a pat on Castiel’s shoulder, a gentle shove towards their theater. It’s a little surprising, how perceptive Dean is and how he’s chosen not to pry, but Castiel appreciates the behavior too much to dwell on it.
It’s not quite midnight when they decide it’s time to pack it in. Dean decides to leave the fairy lights, but they tear down the crepe paper, take apart the shade and the table, and Dean protests when Castiel tries to help him carry everything back down to his car, but there’s no way Castiel is letting him clean up alone.
“I hope you’re not trying to impress anyone, because your hair is a wreck, darling,” Bela says when she pulls back, carefully adjusting the collar of his shirt. Now it’s Castiel’s turn to roll his eyes.
“I know, I’m sorry,” comes a voice through the fog, soaking into his skin in a way that makes Dean want to bare his belly and his neck, and now he can’t stop himself from doing so. The alpha’s breath hitches, and Dean preens under the sound, stretching his arms over his head.
cheating,” Dean snaps, though his grip on Castiel’s hand tightens. “You said yourself that we weren’t together.
“You didn’t seem freaked out by what we did last summer,” Castiel mutters. When Dean blinks, surprised, Castiel takes advantage of the moment and twists out of Dean’s grip, only to raise his hands up and grab at the collar of Dean’s shirt, pulling him close. “Did it ever occur to you that that’s what a relationship is
. An early one, before Kyriel was introduced, so Dean tunes it out and keeps playing with his food, only taking small bites whenever Sam turns to glare at him.
To his surprise, that’s when Cas groans and comes, dragging his mouth against Dean’s neck, and Dean loses his breath when wetness covers his fingers and he realizes
It’s not as if Meg hadn’t offered, once or twice. She is much more experienced than Cas in that area, probably even more than Dean, but Castiel had never been interested. It wasn’t panic or fear or nervousness, like when he was younger, when Bela and Pam liked to tease him. There was just a complete lack of physical response. He liked kissing Meg. He enjoyed making out with her and touching her and cuddling with her, but only ever in private, and it never went beyond that. Ever.
The baby is something to deal with a few months from now. Right now, Cas has to win over the royal family.
“What happened?” Dean asks, when Cas peers out the door, his eyes shadowed and skin blotchy, dressed only in an undershirt and a pair of jeans, with his hair an absolute wreck.
It’s Dean who decides that a late arrival is their best option. Castiel hadn’t received a text message from Jo about her birthday party, but Dean feels pretty confident that it’s been long enough now, and as long as they look happy, she’ll get over it… but allowing other people to arrive first so she’ll be distracted is probably a good idea too.
even faster this time! you guys should be proud of me! (if you're not angry about this ending, of course)
Dean nudges him with his shoulder. “Psst. She’s kidding. Charlie thinks that she can know everything she wants to know about a person based on their likes and dislikes." He brings out a bag of marshmallows, tearing at the plastic until it opens, and he can spear one with his stick. "She's not entirely off base with that, though."
Dean is grinning as he unfolds himself from the driver's seat, leaving the car idling as he walks around to join them. Bela's eyes dart from Dean to Castiel as a sly little smile appears on her face. She puts a hand on her hip and tosses her hair off her shoulder.
Okay, maybe he doesn’t want her like Cas as much as Jo and Charlie and Pam like Cas. But she should at least approve of him and want to be his friend, right? Shouldn’t a girl want to be friends with her boyfriend’s friends?
Naomi’s lips tighten as Michael takes a deep breath. “Mr. Winchester,” Michael says slowly. “What a surprise.”
Cas hesitates, then squints. “Dean, you’re…” He sighs, playing with the hem of his t-shirt. “You don’t have any idea what you mean to me. What happened last summer… it really hurt, but at the same time…” He stares resolutely at the floor, apparently unaware of the way Dean is holding his breath. “I can’t let you go. Even after that, you’re still the best friend I have.”
Dean is grinning, though, definitely excited, as they get out of the car, and as soon as Castiel is close enough, he immediately locks their hands together again. Castiel is unsurprised by this; he realized the first year he met this crew that they liked to touch, and later figured out that Dean was the most tactile of all. Besides, it’s not as though Castiel minds. Dean’s hands are strong and warm and rough, gently leading Castiel forward, and scared as he may be, Castiel would follow anywhere.
And it's a good point, all concerns about Dean's behavior aside. Castiel sighs, rubbing his eyes. "I'll try."
Dean?” Aaron’s smirk comes back easily, as if it had never left. “If he used me, then I used him. C’mon, have you
“I’ve read those!” says Ruby, which leads Castiel to look up. The other kids are appropriately impressed; even Alastair seems to be reappraising him, which makes Castiel wonder if his father’s books are reaching further than he thought. “I haven’t read the newest one,” Ruby continues, “haven’t had the time, but I thought they were pretty good.”
Dean blushes again, and awkwardly waves a hand in the air. "I like to read. Comics, how-to, classic lit, whatever."
Dean drops the phone back in its holder, then wanders out to the living room. The curtains on the bay window are drawn, allowing Sam to watch TV in total darkness. There’s a steaming bowl of baked macaroni and cheese cradled against his chest, and when Dean flops onto the couch next to him, Sam turns to him with narrowed eyes and a full mouth. He manages to swallow before asking, “Did you eat?”
“A friend,” Chuck repeats. “A friend who asks you to sneak out of the house late at night. To lie to your mother and siblings. Who sneaks into your home and inspires you to hurt your-” He cuts himself off when Castiel slams his bowl on the table.
“So you want to mate my son?” John says gruffly, still staring Castiel down. At this point, Castiel honestly doesn’t know what John is trying to protect. His family? His throne? His lineage? He doesn’t elaborate, so while Mary and Sam slip away to take their seats on the other side of the table, Castiel gathers his thoughts.
feel, hm?” For some reason, this is actually easier now that they’re looking at each other. Now that Dean can see Castiel’s face, and from his reactions, he can see how upset Castiel is about this discovery. “You tell me you have feelings for me, and I come back here to find out you spent months being with other people-”
But Dean’s not ready. If he actually thought that Castiel would ever be okay with his little experiments with Aaron, then there’s no way that Dean is ready for a relationship.
Dean doesn’t have to look at Sam to know that his brother’s eyes are on him until he closes the door to his room. He knows Sam is worried about him, which is unfair, because Dean has been trying to protect Sam from this as much as possible. Sam is only sixteen, he should be allowed to break down and cry and talk to his friends and get all these emotions out of him without worrying about things like whether to inter the urn, or keep it at the house.
movie to begin. As he surveys the theater, still filling up as the line slowly makes its way inside, Dean is grateful that his friends decided to get in line early. Their group is a little too large, and if they hadn’t been among the first ones inside, they might have had find separate seats.
Dean glances at him, chuckling softly. “You sound like you’re making an appointment,” he says, eyes aglow. Then, to Castiel’s surprise, Dean swings an arm around his shoulder, bringing him into an enthusiastic sideways hug. “Don’t ever change, Cas.”
“Too obvious.” Dean leans over to press a kiss to Castiel’s cheek. “Gee whiz, you sure know how to treat a fella, Cas.”
Sam rolls his eyes, shaking hair out of his face before slipping off his stool and gesturing for Jess and Castiel to follow.
That’s not unusual for the northwestern coast, but the storm is particularly bad today, and Castiel had had to do a lot of wheedling and lying to get Gabriel to take him out, and Michael to let them go. But while most days are spent out at the beach, or the park, playing games in the sun with the girls, this morning Dean had mentioned working on some sketches, and Castiel has been dying to finally see some of Dean’s completed work.
. Whatever Castiel said yesterday, about anger doing something for him, was stupid. Anger doesn’t do anything compared to Dean being all soft and domestic and caring about Castiel’s well-being.
, I-” He stops walking, so Castiel does too. His body is practically thrumming with frustration, and he sways back and forth on his feet, hands crossed over his chest, as Dean continues, “I could come to you if I wanted to talk about something, right? If I wanted to start drinking again, or was fighting with Sam, or whatever?”
It’s still raining, but Castiel is too furious and hurt to care. He mindlessly does a few light stretches before jogging out into the parking lot, and isn’t at all surprised (hell, maybe he’s a little relieved) when he hears Dean calling his name.
“Look, it pains me to say this, but you look really good in blue and white.” Anna moves like she wants to shove him again, but stops herself, making a face as she finally realizes he’s only wearing a towel. “Just put it on, okay? I haven’t heard from anybody yet so they’re probably running late too, but hurry up anyway, all right?”
“Dean!” Castiel screams this time, but no one’s paying attention to him anymore. The circle draws in tighter, especially when Alastair and Azazel lift the boy up to give Dean a bigger space to choose from, arms and chest and stomach. The cheering is probably the only thing audible from the street, but Castiel can only hear the sound of knuckles and skin, the boy’s horrible groans, and Dean’s grunts of exertion. Castiel covers his ears, but that only seems to amplify the sound, sends it echoing in his head, until finally he can’t stand it anymore.
doesn’t want to take advantage of him. And, as Dean rolls around trying to take off his undershirt, he finds that the alpha makes a pretty good nest. The blankets are soft and warm and covered in that honey-rose smell, and Dean’s instincts are purring. He’s not sated, he hasn’t been knotted, but just the
All with the same electric blue eyes that don’t match Castiel’s at all, even if every other detail is correct.
But what can he say? Absolutely none of this is new or surprising information. Considering Dean has explicitly told him that he needs them to talk about their problems, Castiel has no excuse for his actions. There’s a choking sensation at the thought that he hurt Dean so badly, but all he can do is take a deep breath and turn to watch the tennis courts instead of Bela’s face. Michael is sending curious glances in their direction, so Bela’s body language must make it clear that an argument is going on.
Dean barely hears the words over the pounding of his heart, as Cas’s chest presses against his shoulder. “Yeah?” He croaks out, his cheeks flaming pink when Cas chuckles, still leaning in too close.
"Maybe I don't want your help," Dean hisses, shoving Cas back, knocking him off balance. "Maybe I'm fucked up and there is no fixing me."
Dean tilts his head up until he can meet Castiel’s gaze, and they smirk at one another, almost a challenge, as Dean pulls away and sits up, trying to work his pants open. Castiel has a flashback to the end of last summer, Dean writhing in his lap, watching their cocks slide together in Dean’s fist, and Castiel’s spent cock takes a renewed interest in trying that again. But why do the same thing all the time? He wants to taste Dean too, or maybe get really crazy and try-
. Usually it’s some porn star he snuck a glimpse of off the censored rack at 7-11, or it’s Lisa, hot and willing. But this time? It was Cas. Big blue eyes and soft pink lips, shiny and wet around his dick, and Dean runs a hand through his hair, sweat chilling on his skin.
, and the longer Dean keeps staring at him, green eyes flickering between confusion and hurt and guilt, the more outrage Castiel feels.
“Don’t.” Anna frowns, taking a few steps backwards. “Seriously. ‘Cause if you fuck up and hurt him again, it’ll be my fault, so please, don’t thank me for this.”
Dean blinks at him, then smiles slightly. Logical and honest, as ever. It fills his chest with butterflies, and Dean likes to think that he hates finding out all those cliches are true, but a very small and secret part of him loves the feeling.
Mary brings out their pizzas just then, giving Castiel a reprieve from his own thoughts. The girls break the tension with a spirited discussion about whether or not the late Heath Ledger will end up earning all the praise he’s gotten for the new Batman movie. Sam thinks it’s inappropriate to criticize the recently deceased, especially when the movie’s not even out yet, and Benny thinks a better topic of conversation is whether or not the world really needed Indiana Jones with aliens.
Lisa cuts herself off abruptly, chewing on her lower lip as she stares up at Dean. Her eyes are dark and furious, and she’s clearly struggling with something. But then she sighs, and all the tension in her body just falls away.
He glances at Bela and Charlie before leaning in to Pam’s shoulder and trying to keep up with their conversation. Pam gives him a little smile, and it’s enough to buoy him through listening to Meg’s story about something or other that happened to her dad on the set of some TV show he guested on. Jo is enthralled, her chin in her hands and stars in her eyes, but Dean is just waiting for Meg to stop talking.
“And you buy alcohol for all these underage kids?” Mary scoffs. “How am I supposed to trust you with my kids when I know you’re providing them with this shit?”
Dean grinds back against him, chasing the sensation and clawing at the grass in an attempt to keep himself grounded. He can’t stop the noises wrenching their way out of his throat, and pleasure coils low in Dean’s stomach, making him jolt when Castiel flicks his tongue inside.
Dean is lightning- hot, his skin sparking everywhere Castiel touches him, and Castiel is torn between tearing himself out of bed, away from temptation, and pulling Dean closer, rutting against him until they both come.
Dean’s not sure what she means by that, but he’ll take a little one-on-one time with Cas however he can get it.
Cas raises an eyebrow and turns back to Dean. “Well. I guess I have to meet her, after those rave reviews.”
“Wanted to see if you were bold enough to sneak away tonight, that’s all, Dean-o. You don’t have to be rude.”
“It’s Alastair,” he hisses when he notices Cas watching him curiously. Cas raises his eyebrows and shakes his head.
Jo tries very hard not to look disappointed, and fails. Castiel takes pity on her, and gestures for her to come inside.
But they don’t look away. Castiel lightly drags his fingers up Dean’s inner thigh, and a shiver works down Dean’s spine, but their eyes stay focused on each other.
Dean's cheeks turn rosy, his freckles rising to prominence. "That's... Well. You're welcome, I guess." They start walking again, Dean staring at his feet. "Does that mean we won't see you again? 'Cause Charlie and I were kinda serious about those movie marathons. Hate to let you go back into the world without seeing Lord of the Rings." When Castiel looks up at him, Dean is grinning again, though his cheeks are still pink.
Dean stares at his phone in confusion, at first trying to remember who Jo is in their little Star Trek crew, and then wondering what the hell the red alert is supposed to be.
“I’m in Portland, so no dice,” Dean manages to say. Cas closes his eyes, his lips in a tight line as he runs a hand through his hair.
He’s considering taking off at a run, but he’s not sure if Jody would chase him down or not, since it really kind of is her job to ensure that people in her jurisdiction are safe, and Dean has given her a reason to believe Castiel may not be. Too late, however; Dean is straddling his bike, leaning over the handlebars with a smug smile on his face as Jody gently ushers Cas towards the car.
Castiel had been too busy sulking to even think of that. He frowns, sullen, but says a quiet “Thank you,” as he opens his bag anyway. The smell is incredible: blueberries and butter and cinnamon, carried off by the ozone smell on the wind. He tears off bits and pieces, popping them into his mouth as he warily eyes Aaron from across the table. Aaron doesn’t seem to care, tucking into his croissant with gusto and lots of butter.
“I’m Naomi, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you ladies,” she says, a friendly note in her voice, and Castiel is reminded of attending large parties in fancy clothes, watching his mother laugh with strangers only for that joyful mask to fade as soon as they were safely in the limo, on their way home. Pam shakes the offered hand, as does Charlie and Jo, offering their own names as they do so, and Anna and Castiel exchange a look while their mother chatters on about nothing.
“Point.” Aaron sets his own bag and a cup of coffee down before reaching to open the parasol stuck in the center of the table. “This is probably a good idea in that case.”
In fact, for who knows how long, Dean doesn’t notice much of anything except Lisa’s body pressed up against his own, and the laughter of the people around him. Someone grabs his shoulder and yells his name, and at first he ignores it, brushes the hand away, but then there’s a set of arms wrapping around his chest, hauling him up, and now Dean flails in confusion, swearing, “What the fuck?”
Castiel stares at him. “You’re drunk,” he accuses, even though Dean’s words have struck a chord in him. It’s a nice thought, and though he keeps telling himself it’s not realistic, that’s not how it works, Dean’s rambling little apology settles in, wiggles around and makes itself at home.
The next thing Dean remembers is waking up in an unfamiliar bed, with blankets piled up around him like a nest. Did he do that? He’s never been prone to nesting during his heats, but who knows?
"Dean, stop it." Cas shakes Dean's shoulder, then shifts onto his knees, putting his other hand on Dean's other shoulder and pulling him closer. "Dean, that girl is just fine, and none of this is your fault."
Cas fumbles a little, his hands falling to Dean’s chest and gripping at his shirt, which makes Dean laugh, mouth moving to Cas’s chin, where there’s stubble dragging against his lips. It’s a weird, but not unpleasant sensation.
Cas draws back from Dean and reclaims his seat as Dean shrugs. “She said tonight should be about us.” He gestures around the table, Cas and Charlie on one side, and Jo, Pam, and Ash squeezed in on the other. “It’s not like she’ll never have another chance to meet him, right?” He glances at Cas, an eyebrow raised. “You are gonna be able to hang out more this summer, aren’t you?”
None of this is going the way Dean thought it would when he was little. Hell, it’s not going the way he thought it would back in March, when he finally worked up the courage to ask Lisa out.
They all get saddled up before heading west again, and Charlie and Benny are nice enough to ride ahead a little, giving Dean and Castiel some semblance of privacy. Castiel is seated just behind Dean, his chest pressed flush against Dean’s back and his hands resting around Dean’s waist. The proximity is making Dean a little giddy, honestly, but he’s surprised by how much better he feels now compared to the ride out. His stomach is calm and his heartbeat is steady… maybe there’s actually something to this stuff about the alpha making pregnancy easier. It’d be awesome if Dean could actually hold his meals down again.
“That was me,” Castiel says fiercely, his voice soft. “All of that, it was me, not Dean. I take full responsibility for everything I’ve done.” He takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself. “Well, he did sneak into the bungalow, but he was trying to make me feel better.”
Dean’s jaw drops at this outright lie, but luckily Jody is watching Castiel too intently to notice. “Where did you see this?”
“The big picture is made of tiny details,” Castiel says. “Sometimes I can’t make sense of the big picture, so I have to look closer to understand.”
Dean is looking at him questioningly too, so Castiel sighs. “I understand that you all want to protect Dean. And I understand that I’ve given no one any reason to trust me. But there is more to our relationship than what you all choose to see, and what we choose to show you.” He hesitates here, glancing at Dean, who is regarding him with interest. “Dean knows that I…” Castiel swallows, his throat suddenly dry, but pushes through it anyway, “He knows I love him. Right?”
Turns out, Dean didn’t have to be worried. Lisa and Cas take over the conversation for a while, but while Dean stays quiet, Lisa intertwines their fingers under the table and turns to smile at him on occasion, never forgetting his presence. Dean feels something settle inside him, knowing that Lisa and Cas get along, but not in a way that means they’ll be eloping to Vegas anytime soon.
Dean frowns and picks the kegs back up, dragging them over to the door to join the rest. He’s only thinking about Jo and the festival and carrying the stupid kegs around, which is probably half the reason he’s so shocked when he lifts his head and looks out the window.
The smile on Charlie’s face is blinding, and she rubs at her eyes before reaching out to slap Dean’s arm. “You have a girlfriend to cuddle with, what do you need me for, Winchester?”
“No!” Sam nearly knocks the bowl of popcorn over as he crawls up the bed to sit closer to Castiel. “Though that explains how he got his autographed first edition! He won’t let me borrow it, so I’m not totally caught up yet!”
Dean sighs again, now morosely resting his chin in his hand. “Y’know what the weirdest part is?” He says. Charlie doesn’t move, but Cas’s hand stills between his shoulders, and Jo politely leans closer over the table, the fading purple stripe of hair falling off her shoulder. “When I told her I’d kissed a guy, she thought it was hilarious. Saying she’d pay to see it.”
Dean blinks, then allows a small smile, a little, “Okay,” and “Be safe,” and “See you soon,” as he turns and heads back inside. For a second, Castiel understands what yearning is, as he watches through the big window, where Dean shakes the water off and rejoins his friends. They’re framed in warm, golden light, and Castiel is stupid enough to deny himself the same comfort, to stay out here in the wet and cold, because he can’t get over the fact that the boy he loves slept with someone else.
“Yeah! We won!" Sam cheers, and Castiel smiles, congratulating him. Dean's head pops out of the kitchen entryway, his face lighting up in a grin when he realizes who’s at the door. “Hey!” he yells, “We’re making celebratory sundaes, d’you want one?”
, which is also a great place to check for updates and teasers. It's gotten a lot more diverse lately, haha, so give it a look, if you're interested!
Dean blinks, then meets Cas’s gaze, something in his chest slowing his breath and making him dizzy. “You actually posted those up?”
Dean leads them off to the main staircase, and they’re only moments away from the dining hall now. They might even be on time, if they hurry, so Dean hastens his steps, only to be jerked back when Castiel suddenly stops walking.
Castiel pauses. He slowly, awkwardly, lifts his hand and drops it back into the water, but he doesn’t move too far away. Dean’s teasing, clearly, which says a lot about his state of mind, but now that they’re out of that intense, sexual moment, Castiel is starting to doubt his decision.
before you’d tell me?” Dean shoves Cas backwards, practically snarling. “What, are you in love with Lisa? Is that it? You want to steal her from me, and you and Bela laugh about it?”
Dean opts not to respond, and turns back to his current project. Sonny watches him for a moment more, then offers, “Maybe someday we can get together and talk about that mural. Figure out what you did wrong and what you did right, and how you can be better next time.”
“Aren’t you the one who told me that I don’t own you?” Dean says. When Cas turns to look at him, Dean smiles slightly, trying to convey that he’s only teasing, and Cas huffs.
They’re allowed only a few seconds like this before Castiel hears a click, and a door being opened. He lifts his head to see Anna inconspicuously peering at them and wrinkling her nose. When Dean turns to look at her, she finally says, “I was expecting to find one of you on your knees, but this is almost worse.”
Sam is beaming, and he looks ready to start another long speech about the bands that Jo got him into, how they’re all interconnected but all sound totally different even though Dean couldn’t tell the Fall Out Boys from the Discos to save his life. Dean steps in, whistling to get Sam’s attention. “You better go get some water in you before practice starts again, Sammy,” he suggests, laughing when Sam makes a face and runs away with a quick wave. “Sam loves you almost as much as the girls do, Cas.”
Dean smiles, reaching to cup Castiel’s face in his hands, pulling him in and leaving a kiss on his forehead. “Do you want to take the car?”
Sam glowers up at Dean, who marvels for the millionth time this year at just how big his baby brother is getting; there’s only about half a foot between them now, and Dean knows he’s done some growing himself in the past several months.
Since Mary knows, or thinks she knows, Castiel decides to return downstairs, instead of sleeping by himself on the uncomfortable pull-out bed. Dean is still dead to the world when Castiel arrives back in the bedroom, so Castiel tries his best not to jostle the bed as he climbs back in. As he turns, ready to lay back down behind Dean, a couple of objects on Dean’s bedside table catch his eye.
, dammit - she deserved that much - but especially once he and Dean were back in the same space, there was no hope for it. There was just fear and longing hidden behind simpering, saccharine sentiment, designed to push Dean away.
The alpha tilts his head in confusion, until Dean gestures at his trousers. “Ah. Well. It helps that deer aren’t very chatty. They’re actually kind of snobbish.”
Dean takes a deep breath, and turns away. Heat is crawling up his neck, but maybe he can write it off as nothing more than the wind. “Hey, Cas,” he murmurs, tucking his hands in his pockets.
“I should have asked you first.” Dean’s gaze darts around the restaurant, stubbornly refusing to meet Castiel’s eyes. “I’m sorry. This doesn’t have to be a date or anything, if you don't want it to. I just wanted to get to talk to you before everyone else started fighting for your attention."
“There are other options,” John answers thinly, pointedly staring at his plate. Mary makes a soft noise and turns her head away, lips pressed tight as if she’s a fairy’s breath away from spilling all her anger onto the table.
“Hey.” Fingertips press against Castiel’s chin, tilting his head up until he meets Dean’s eyes. “What are you thinking?”
,” says the voicemail, and Castiel takes a breath over the beep. He doesn’t speak for a few seconds, but eventually is unable to convince himself to hang up. Something has to give.
Nevertheless, when Dean gets home that night, he Googles the name ‘Andrew Wyeth,’ and suddenly the joke becomes clear. Two-hundred and four paintings of the same blonde girl does make Dean feel a little better… until he starts wondering if he’ll eventually beat that number.
Charlie’s eyes light up, now clearly full of inspiration for yet another wild pop culture ride with roles for all her friends, but before she can speak, Jo claps a hand over her mouth, keeping her silent.
Dean’s stomach lurches, and he has just enough time to reach the patch of bushes that Castiel emerged from, before he vomits his breakfast all over the grass.
And when he walks down the hallway to Cas’s suite, banging on the door. “Cas!” he yells, and his voice cracks, “I’ve made a huge mistake!”
Anna sits up straight, frowning hard, but Charlie laughs. “Look, I’m not gonna argue about Hermione being awesome as hell, but Ginny is pretty amazing too.” She runs a hand through Gilda’s hair, then presses a kiss to her shoulder. “Besides, who says Harry
“Yeah, okay, but,” and Jo rolls her eyes again but Dean plows forward, determined to have his say, “the Miltons are usually back in town by now, right? But nobody’s heard from Cas yet, so I was wondering-”
Benny is still staring at Castiel, who has to wonder what, exactly, he’s been told about Dean and Castiel’s relationship. Whatever he heard, it wasn’t good, because he still looks distrustful. Still, when Benny glances at Dean, and when Castiel realizes that Dean has situated himself much closer to Castiel than he was before, Benny finally drops his arms and rolls his eyes.
Castiel realizes how ridiculous this is as soon as the ringing starts. He wants to be with Dean, but he doesn’t. He misses Dean, but he was too proud to call. And yet he is so
“I can’t do that,” Castiel says quietly, squaring his shoulders and standing up straight. “I won’t do that. Bela doesn’t deserve it, and Dean doesn’t deserve it, so no.”
Cas wants to lift Dean up, and that’s terrifying. Lisa is happy with the way things are, and if Dean falls, maybe she’ll fall with him.
A smaller hand touches his arm, and Dean lifts his head to see Charlie’s stricken look. “I’m sorry,” she whispers. Dean takes a deep breath, and sits up before winking at her.
On the other hand, he’s sure Dean would appreciate the support. And he absolutely does not want to go an entire year without seeing Dean again.
“Like I’m stupid enough to get between a pregnant omega and his alpha.” Jess sighs and shakes her head. “
“You wouldn’t understand,” Dean says softly, turning back to Charlie and putting a hand on her shoulder. She quickly shrugs him off and gets to her feet, putting her hands on her hips. Dean is struck with the image of her as Wonder Woman, and he wishes he wouldn’t get all these great ideas at such terrible times.
He takes a few slow, deep breaths before lifting his head and staring out at the horizon. It’ll be difficult to distance himself from Naomi and Michael, the way he does with Dean. He can’t kick his mother out of a hotel room she’s paying for, and while he might get away with locking himself in that tiny bedroom, he won’t be able to do it for long. How is he supposed to-
Castiel frowns, a little disappointed that Alastair and Azazel were able to get away, but at least the boy was able to get some kind of help. He’s also a little disturbed that Bela doesn’t seem to care about the boy’s well-being, but he temporarily sets that aside to deal with her accusation. “I’m not gay.”
“Wow, way to be rude, Kirk.” There’s a commotion in the background, loud conversation and glasses clinking. “I only had amazing news for you, but maybe I won’t share it anymore.”
Charlie shakes her head like she wants no part of this conversation, but Gilda is sweet enough to attempt a smile as she says, “I’m as much of a nerd as Charlie. You do remember how we met, right?”
“Of course!” Jess waves at another servant who passes them with a look of surprise on his face. “He’ll pretend otherwise, but Dean knows all about the kingdom’s history and its laws. Beyond that, he’s kind, and he cares about his people. He’s the one who convinced his father to allow the refugees to work in the castle!”
Dean clutches his book tighter to his chest, trying to collect his thoughts. “My kiss. We’ve had at least one kiss every year, I think it’s pretty much part of our relationship standards by now, platonic or not, and I didn’t get one this year because of Meg. Well,” Dean shrugs, “Meg’s not around anymore. And you’re leaving. So I want my kiss.”
This is what was missing when he held hands with Meg; there’s a pleasantness that comes from being close to someone, from feeling fondness and affection… and then there’s fireworks and bubbles and the genuine contentment of knowing that someone knows you so well and still wants to be around you.
Dean’s lips chase Castiel’s as he leans back, and Dean teases, “Didn’t you say you weren’t gonna make any moves?”
It goes on like that for a while. Lisa sipping at her first cup, eyes on Dean as he downs drink after drink. The music only gets louder, the white noise of yelled conversations fading beneath a bass beat. A flurry of random faces, kids from school, recent graduates, not-so-recent graduates back for the summer, and at one point Dean recognizes Victor in the crowd, yells at him to come over. But Victor is closer to Lisa, who’s still sitting with her legs crossed and her arms tucked in and her cup half-full, and they’re both watching Dean with worried eyes.
“Ah!” She presses her thumb just under his own, bringing it closer to her face. “You’re very charismatic. People fall in love with you wherever you go.”
And even those who might forgive those indiscretions, because Dean is young and fertile and pretty, may not forgive him for bearing another alpha’s pups. There’s a good reason only mated or related alphas are allowed in the castle during Dean’s heats, and it’s certainly not for Dean’s comfort.
“No, that’s your decision.” Dean scoots across the dirt, until their knees are touching, leaning into Castiel’s face as if challenging him to move away. Castiel doesn’t budge. “I think that’s what I’m trying to say. You get to choose what’s meaningful enough to be remembered forever. Is it an accident with your best friend? Is it a rich girl you don’t even like? Or maybe it’s neither, and you’re gonna wait for the right girl. That’s okay too.”
It’s all that Castiel expected. In fact, he’s almost glad to see such a Dean-like response, all things considered.
“Hey, guys,” he says loudly, drawing their attention away from the painting. “Glad you could make it.”
. Castiel draws back in surprise; no omega in heat should be able to curse their alpha, let alone growl. Hell, it’s hard enough to believe that a perfectly lucid and healthy omega could do so. Despite his shock, something like desire rolls through Castiel’s chest, but it’s not quite physical. It’s not an urge to slip inside Dean and fuck him until he pops a knot (though that’s not to say that Castiel doesn’t want to do that too).
These are still common topics, as Missouri teaches Dean how to handle his feelings and helps him figure out his own worth. They especially talk about Cas, but the conversations always feel a little... Unfinished. Like Missouri thinks Dean is hiding something from her and is trying to prompt him into admitting it. But Dean has told her everything there is to tell. Except the dreams, of course. And the kisses. Those especially are something that Dean's not willing to discuss yet.
Jess’s eyebrows climb towards her hairline before she smiles and scoffs. “Oh, yeah, I know, you’ve probably heard all the bad things, but the refugees are all omegas. They’re great people. Oh!” Her attention turns towards someone standing behind Castiel, and he slowly turns to see who has joined them. “Like Hannah! She’s a refugee, and she’s working with Dean during the pregnancy, so you’ll really get to know how wonderful she is.”
Dean barks out a laugh, which makes Pam turn to them with a raised eyebrow, so he leans in and keeps his voice down when he responds, “What, she’s not woman enough for you?”
Cas peers over the boy's head at the crowd of kids around the bonfire. A skinny blonde girl is standing just outside the circle, watching them with her hands on her hips. "I'm not sure... How old are you?"
“You’re welcome,” he answers, quiet but just as honest, then continues, “Tell me about your day. Are you sick of being locked up yet?”
Dean closes his eyes and rubs a hand over his mouth as Alastair’s voice slithers through the phone and into his ear. He’d been afraid that the parties would pick up now that school’s out, and had considered himself lucky not to have been called about them yet. But Dean’s luck never lasts very long.
“You really know how to win a girl’s heart,” Bela drawls, putting a hand on her hip. “Whatever, I was just curious. I’ve given my apology, do you accept it?”
Because honestly, he’s thought about it. Now that he’s eighteen, he has access to his savings account through the right channels, and if he wanted to he could pull all that money out and run away. What he’d do with the money, who knows, but he does now exactly where he’d run to, and maybe that’s why he hasn’t done it - it’d be so easy to find him right here in Sileas, with Dean.
“Ginny is a whiny little baby, pining away for her childhood crush,” Meg scoffs. “Harry deserves better. At least Hermione is as smart as she is tough."
Aaron frowns slightly, but complies. “Since Dean and Charlie are both pretty open about the whole bi-lesbian thing, I let them know that I’d been checking out a few guys’ butts. Just out of curiosity, didn’t know if I swung one way, the other, or both. Next thing I know, Dean’s got me cornered and making a proposition.”
Dean hasn’t told anyone about what happened last night. He figured it might take attention away from Jo, since this weekend is supposed to be about her birthday. Lisa’s not even here; she’s spending several days in San Francisco with her mother, so it’s not like she can tell him not to talk. Still, he fidgets in his seat, unable to wipe the grin off his face, to the point that Cas keeps frowning at him and kicking him in the shins.
“You don’t have five-o-clock shadow yet, numbskull, you’re fine, and you’re late.” She grabs his wrist, tugging him across the hallway into the private bedroom, where a set of clothes is laid out across the bed. Castiel blinks, then turns to frown at Anna.
“Go home, nobody wants you here!” Lisa yells over her shoulder, as Dean leans up against her and they walk back down the stairs. Alastair has set up a little circle near the waves, with Ruby and Lilith and Azazel, and he gestures for Dean and Lisa to join them.
Dean rubs his hand over the back of his neck, his clothes suddenly itchy and suffocating. He came all the way out here to tell Castiel about the baby, about the opportunity to meet the king and the royal family, to possibly become part of it one day… but standing here in front of the alpha, he can’t find the words. His heart is stuttering in his chest, and he thinks that maybe, if he could just get a whiff of honey and roses, he might feel a little more confident.
Castiel laughs softly, covering his mouth with his hand. Lucifer tilts his head, smiling in that odd, patronizing way of his. “Pretty girl?”
On the other side is Dean, smiling shyly and fidgeting in his blazer. Castiel blinks, taking in the black dress pants and lavender tie, and maybe he is underdressed. Dean doesn’t seem to mind though, seeing as he visibly relaxes as his eyes wander down Castiel’s body.
The further Dean gets from that very dark time in his life, the more embarrassed he is by the mural. And it sucks, because whenever he goes to work, there it is, those big blue eyes staring at him until he’s safely in the office or the garage. Several times, he’s gone to Wal-Mart with the intention of buying white paint and destroying the damn thing, only to have Sam or Charlie or Mary talk him out of it. And Dean supposes it could be worthwhile to leave it up for the time being, until he’s honed his skills enough to replace it with something better.
With that, Dean mirrors Castiel, though he doesn’t even pause when he finds Castiel is still mostly soft. His easy acceptance of the situation fixes things about as well as his deft, clever fingers, and soon enough, they’re not so much kissing as they are gasping against each other’s mouths, wrists crossed between them.
Laughing, Dean shakes his head. “Nah. C’mon, they’re not gonna throw the future heir’s dad in a jail tower.” He’s joking, reaching out for the alpha, but now it’s Castiel who’s turning a little green.
He’s aware that this sort of thing is why Lisa was so angry. That by doing this, he might have already made his choice. But Dean doesn’t care. He’ll check up on Cas now, and try to figure out how smooth things over with Lisa later. It’s really all he can do.
“Not your fault,” he says. Charlie’s eyes dart towards Jo before she withdraws her hand, shoulders still stiff. Dean really doesn’t think of it as Charlie’s problem, since he was the one who led the conversation towards Cas, but he can’t bring that up here. Not with Jo and Cas sitting right there. “Seriously, Charlie,” Dean says with a sigh. “Don’t go around thinking it’s your fault.”
"Dammit, Cas, I appreciate the support," Dean laughs again, smiling crookedly. "But I don't really deserve it."
“No.” Mary nods as if convincing herself, and reaches out to grip Castiel’s hand in her’s. “Better late than never. He deserves a chance at his own life, and I’m gonna make sure he gets it, come hell or high water. He can have more time for his art, and he can have more time for you, and you can work on convincing him to move to Illinois and make a life out there.”
With that, she purses her lips and nods before turning on her heel and walking away without another word. Michael approaches as soon as she’s gone, nudging Castiel with an elbow.
“Well…” Castiel runs a hand through his hair, then returns to fiddling with his tie, staring intently at the pattern between his fingers. “It’s… I don’t know about
There’s an enclosed garden at the castle. It’s in full bloom right now, pinks and purples and blues, and plenty of bees. Castiel would probably like it. Maybe he could even build them a swing or a gazebo, like he built the cottage.
Castiel pointedly avoids catching his brother’s gaze, while Gabriel stays surprisingly quiet. Castiel pulls his phone out of his back pocket and twirls it in his palm, debating whether or not to text Bela, maybe call and invite Dean over, but then Gabriel reaches over and puts a hand on his shoulder, shaking him gently.
Castiel smiles as warmth starts to gather in his chest. Dean has been careful lately, respectful of Castiel’s supposed punishment; he probably wouldn’t have asked if Jo hadn’t suggested having Castiel there. And as much as Castiel adores Dean, as fond as he is of Dean’s friends, it’s nice to know that Dean’s friends like Castiel too.
“Hey!” And Castiel freezes, halfway out the door. Michael’s voice continues, “Where the hell do you think you’re going?”
, a refresher for those of you who don't feel like rereading the whole story again before you read the new chapter. I'll update it to have last chapter's information soon :)
“A piece of advice, from me to you? Secrets and mystery don’t go over well here. The royal family values trust and loyalty, and keeping things from them will just make His Majesty dislike you even more.”
“That won’t be necessary,” and if Castiel’s tone is a little colder than need be, he doesn’t care. “These guys aren’t like your usual crew.”
! This fic is slowly starting to figure itself out, but I don't have anything set in stone yet, so if there's anything you'd like to see, you can let me know that too!
Castiel glances down. Dean’s green eyes are looking up at him with concern, and Castiel loves him so much he can hardly bear it.
Because he did it. He finally cut ties with Alastair. And on the one hand, he’s relieved that he doesn’t have to play these violent games anymore, doesn’t have to risk becoming his father. On the other hand, how will this affect the people he loves?
“I’m not sure I could handle more than a mouthful,” Castiel admits. His honesty surprises Dean, and he’s almost ready to offer to guide Castiel through it, when Castiel’s grin stretches and turns mischievous. “But I can give you something else.”
"You were trying to protect your brother," Cas murmurs, shifting his hands, flattening his palms against Dean's back. "And your friends. You are noble and loyal and good, and someone took advantage of that, tried to twist it into something bad."
Castiel blinks, following her as she starts to climb the stairs. “Dean didn’t tell you where he found me?”
Alastair gives him the information, and luckily the party starts late enough that Dean can at least get through dinner before he has to leave. It works, because Mary only has an hour before she has to go to her shift at the Roadhouse, so she won’t ask questions. Lisa learned during the school year that Dean would occasionally have to skip out on plans at the last minute. As far as she knows, it’s a job, though Dean’s pretty sure that, if Lisa were to spend more time with his friends, she’d figure out he was ditching her for parties pretty quickly. A part of him wants to tell her, this is
“No, Cas. You know why I work with Alastair.” Dean forces himself to laugh, grinning easily, and really it’s no wonder he got this ‘promotion’ within Alastair’s crew. He’s so damn good at pretending to be happy, after all. “Besides, what’s the point of school anyway? Not like it’s gonna do me any good.”
Dean cards his fingers through Cas’s hair, whimpering softly as Cas nuzzles at him, but he tugs gently, drawing Cas’s attention towards his face instead. Cas gives him a small smile and crawls over his body, letting Dean’s hands explore the shape of his face as they lazily roll their hips together, cocks aligned but orgasm is no longer the point.
Cas doesn’t respond, even when Dean finally goes silent. He stares at Dean, eyes wide and searching, until the silence stretches too long, and Dean forces himself to let go and stand back, clearing his throat.
Sonny takes a seat next to Dean on the stool. “How about you just draw today?” he suggests. “Don’t worry about colors or planning anything out in advance. Just put a pencil to the canvas and see what comes out.”
“I still need to get into Sileas some day and see that mural you said you painted,” Missouri comments casually.
“Fine,” Castiel says, resting his chin on his knees. The horizon has disappeared, the ocean the same deep purple as the sky, and Castiel stares into the void, trying to pick up his train of thought one more time.
“Play your cards right, and you just might get lucky tonight, tiger,” she says after a moment, smiling when Castiel’s eyebrows raise. He starts to ask her what the hell that means, but before he gets the chance, she’s leading the way off the porch and out to the parking lot, where her father ordered a car to take them into town.
“Watch where you’re going, Napoleon!” she snaps, brushing invisible dust off the sleeves of her leather jacket. Dean frowns, fumbling to get the kegs back in a good grip. Who the hell wears a leather jacket in July anyway? Oregon ain’t exactly Arizona, but it’s still warm.
Dean takes a breath and says, “Maybe. I don’t know if I can get the time off if I’m going to be gone all summer, but we’ll see.”
Dean, however, looks annoyed, like he’s tired of explaining what’s happening over and over and over again. So while Bela, Charlie, and Victor wrestle in the sand, Castiel gets up and steps around them, taking Dean’s hand and asking, “When was the last time you danced with me?”
!” over the scattered applause. The bass player flips him off before the band heads into an off-tempo cover of “Blitzkrieg Bop.” Satisfied, Dean nudges Cas’s shoulder. “You’re coming to Jo’s party then?”
Castiel can’t remember seeing Dean wear either, though he supposes that Dean’s been wearing a lot of coats and long sleeves, so both could be hidden under his clothes at any time. In fact, the only times he’s seen Dean’s forearms or chest has been after they’ve gotten ready for bed, and it’s entirely plausible that he’s removed the jewelry before going to sleep. Even if he’s not wearing the chain all the time, he keeps it nearby, and isn’t that something?
Her blue eyes are genuinely hopeful, inferring other discussions she wishes to have. Castiel sighs. “Of course. I look forward to it.”
Lisa looks incredible in her new white dress, an orange scarf wrapped around her waist. The contrast against her tanned skin is setting off all kinds of alarms in Dean’s head, where he kind of wants to take her down to the beach and draw her as she dances in the sand, but he also kind of wants to get her in the bed of his truck and find out if her thighs are as tan as her shoulders.
Dean doesn’t seem to notice the pause, and lifts his hand to drop it in Castiel’s hair, gently massaging his scalp. They’re quiet for a moment, as Johnny tells Baby that he’s been fired anyway, but her efforts weren’t for nothing, because no one has ever done anything like that for him before. Castiel’s breath shakes again, and he buries his face in Dean’s neck when Dean laughs softly.
“Don’t,” Cas says shortly, turning a corner, dragging Dean behind him. “I’m on vacation, I can sleep when I want.”
They haven't kissed like this since that first date, before Castiel knew about Aaron, before everything got so tangled up. He finds a little comfort in that, which surprises him; they've gotten back to a place beyond hesitant presses of lips and awkward cuddles, and that's good to know. It’s good to know that Dean still wants that, and that he’s willing to go for it, and something settles in Castiel’s chest when he realizes that he wants this too.
If looks could kill, Castiel would be dropping dead right this second. Luckily, the anger has given him something to focus his nerves on, and he’s able to ignore Jo’s murderous glare as he grabs a small box of Trojans and a bottle of Astroglide and starts walking back towards the counter. Jo doesn’t follow. Good. Castiel isn’t sure how much longer he’s going to hold it together, and falling apart in front of her would be worse than falling apart in front of Dean.
Cas opens his eyes, and Dean has to blink a little to readjust to that astute gaze. “No,” Cas says slowly, thinking about it. “Not exactly. But, were I to find one, I can’t promise I could be as bold as you.”
When he’s able to lift his head again, he catches a glimpse of movement by the kitchen door. Sam is standing there, watching him with mournful eyes, but Dean quickly straightens up and clears his throat. Sam shouldn’t be worrying about him. Sam shouldn’t be worrying about anything - he’s got a few days off from school, Sarah, Andy, and Jess are coming over later, and all Sam needs to do is sit there and grieve and let his friends (and Dean) support him. Dean’s the adult. He’ll do the rest.
Dean can feel heat climbing up his neck and into his face, because he can remember too. That accidental kiss that maybe wasn’t so accidental, but Cas doesn’t know that and he doesn’t
“But it looks like I’m pushing you away,” Castiel protests. “I know I do that. I shouldn’t, but I do.”
As Dean sits on the couch after dark, watching Dr. Sexy re-runs with his phone on the cushion next to him, he has to laugh at himself. Of course he could never actually stay away from Cas. Not on his own. Look at what a wreck he is now.
When there’s a knock on the door just before 10pm, Michael’s head immediately swivels in Castiel’s direction. Which, frankly, is uncalled for, considering Castiel has tried to be good and still hasn’t gone to find his phone or attempt to contact his friends. So Castiel scowls right back at Michael, while Lucifer takes it upon himself to actually answer the door.
Castiel can’t help a little laugh. “Yeah, some of his old shows get recycled on certain channels. He’s my uncle.” Dean’s immediate disgusted reaction produces another laugh out of Castiel. “So my mother’s family has had money from his work for ages. Mother is Uncle Zach’s manager, and she’s trying to teach Michael how to take over for her so she can retire before Anna graduates college.”
Castiel isn’t great in the kitchen, but he has helped Dean with prep in the past, and it’s gone okay. However, once the batter is made, Dean cheerfully guides him to the stove and places a spatula in his hand. “I’ll dip,” Dean says, “you grill.”
Once they finally reach Castiel’s room, high in a tower, she pauses outside his door and turns to fix him with a curious stare. “Y’know,” she says, “even if you are from Cielo and being all mysterious and secretive about it, I think I see why Dean likes you so much.”
Because he’s not like that with Dean. He never really has been. They have always touched and kissed, and honestly, Castiel made Meg wait, but all Dean had to do was show him that specific, selfless form of kindness that is
Bela smiles at him, and while it’s still victorious, there’s nothing mean about it. Dean takes a deep breath.
“Hey, Dean, it’s Lisa.” Dean closes his eyes and relaxes back into the couch. He’d been hoping to hear from Lisa, but actually receiving a call from her just makes it clear that he wanted to hear from Charlie or Jo or Cas even more. “I guess you’re at work or something. I mean, I hope you’re not ignoring me? I just, um, just wanted to say that I’ve talked to Jo and Charlie for you. Charlie says you guys are good, and Jo’s still mad but I think she’ll come around. I’ll keep working on her. Um.” She takes a deep breath here, and when she speaks again, it’s soft: “I miss you. I hope you’re okay. Call me back. Okay? Bye.”
Naomi turns on her heel and walks away. All three boys wince when they hear a door slam down the hall. Michael stares at Castiel for a moment, looking unsettled, before he clears his throat. “Okay. Get ready, we have to leave in a half hour.” Then he disappears as well.
Lisa smiles again, but it’s sad, and she looks at Dean again as she says, “There are certain people in your life that I don’t stand a chance against. You keep telling me I don’t have to be jealous, but as long as those certain people are around, I absolutely do.”
But Sonny doesn’t comment on that. He doesn’t say anything for a few moments, just studying the sketch. He moves around Dean’s stool to the canvases leaning up against it, and picks up the unfinished painting of Cas in blues and greens. “Is this the same person?” Sonny asks.
Dean chuckles, turning away from her and taking his own cup, choosing straight whisky for himself. “Encourages it,” he answers with a sigh. “And he’s not exactly my boss, y’know? He’s just…” Dean pauses, struggling the find the right description for Alastair, something that won’t frighten Lisa. “Trying to turn a profit,” he settles on, before taking a long drink.
Finally, Sam snaps that he has to get to practice and hangs up the phone. Dean closes his eyes and lets out a long exhale.
Bela turns and stares at him before laughing aloud. “Are you joking?” When Dean just furrows his brow, she laughs again. “Please. We’re just friends.”
Castiel blushes slightly when she winks and turns to head back into the kitchen, just as the bell rings over the door again. A few seconds later, Aaron appears at his side, right on time.
Dean’s omega instincts perk up at the thought of helping Cas through a rut, but as he starts up the last staircase, he pushes those thoughts away. It’s impossible for Cas to be in a rut; he was totally placid and sweet just a few hours ago, and Dean has spent enough time surrounded by alphas to know how badly they behave when there’s a rut on the horizon. Tempers, possessiveness, snarling and growling, and lots of other things that are the exact opposite of how Cas was earlier.
Sam rolls his eyes and storms off without another word. Dean gives Castiel a helpless look, and Castiel pats his arm again.
He wants to see Cas one more time, before summer break ends. He wants to apologize and start making things right. To treat Cas a little better and make him smile again.
"What?" Dean prompts, taking a seat next to him. Cas laughs softly, finally turning his gaze to the paintings in his hands.
Dean shrugs. “I want to call her.” It’s easier to focus on his past sins, to want to make amends, then to have to face anything else to do with Mary’s death. He’s had enough of that for one evening.
With the evening’s traditions taken care of, everyone splits up to change into their new pajamas and get to bed. Tomorrow is a big day.
To his surprise, Aaron laughs. “Listen,” he says, when Castiel glares at him, “Jo and Charlie and those guys, I get what they were trying to do, but whatever they think they know about you and Dean and this
“You really do like this band, don’t you?” he teases. Cas turns to him, squinting, and when the song goes into a brief bass solo, Cas grins back and pushes away from the wall.
“Lisa told me, when we broke up, that she realized we weren’t any good together because she was an enabler.” Dean sits back, kneeling between Castiel’s legs, letting their hands rest in his lap. “She didn’t use that word, of course,” he chuckles, “I got that from Missouri. But that’s what Lisa was. She thought it’d make me happy if we had sex and she drank and went to parties with me.”
"Its the basis of our entire economy, Cas," Dean teases. "You sound like the rich little bastard you are."
“Seriously, Cas,” Dean barks, his hand moving to grip Castiel’s wrist. “Don’t ruin this by bringing up all that bullshit.”
Dean sighs. Well, if he can’t work up the nerve to watch gay porn, maybe some stupid gay movies with Charlie will help.
Dean hasn’t said another word, just made a few gentle noises and held tight around Castiel’s torso. He hasn’t asked Castiel to stop, or even tried to ask why. In his silence lies acceptance, to let Castiel’s waves of emotion beat against his rock and bear the weight until the storm calms itself. This, and the simple, easy way Dean saw Castiel’s trepidation and decided not to continue… it means so much. Last summer, Castiel had decided to try harder to let himself be vulnerable for Dean, to let Dean in, and here it is, the culmination of that decision. Taken out of Castiel’s hands, yes, but finally here nonetheless.
Dean hesitates. He’s still reeling from all the information he got from Missouri, still trying to familiarize himself with the terms she gave him. He spent a good chunk of this morning on MySpace, switching his Orientation between Straight and Bisexual, before eventually just deciding not to list it anymore. Then he used Google to see what kind of gay porn he could find, but freaked out before he could even decide if he enjoyed it, erasing the history before Mary or Sammy could see it.
It’s too much, this out-of-nowhere, overwhelming sense of disgust. Dean digs his nails into his forehead, then reaches for his phone. He’s never done this before. Usually, he waits for the jobs to come to him and does them reluctantly, but right now… he needs to drink until he doesn’t feel, and he needs to punch someone he doesn’t give a fuck about. He needs a release.
“Where are we going?” Dean asks quietly, finally lifting his head to squint up at the sky, shielding his eyes with one hand.
So although meeting the royal family of Winchester is nerve-wracking, to say the least, Castiel is enamored enough with Dean that he will try and brave this. Mary seems friendly enough, and though Sam is wary, he hasn’t done more than glance suspiciously at Castiel. This can’t go too badly. Right?
Everything is better if he just pretends that Dean never slept with Aaron, but after their conversation the other day, Castiel can’t let it go. He can’t shove it aside and lock it away anymore. Even with Aaron confirming the constant pattern of Dean’s infatuation, Castiel can’t understand how Dean can be so
So Castiel sees Dean’s point, wanting to get as many seconds as they can. If Dean insists on parking, Castiel will pretend to mind and make a fuss, but he’ll hold his hand until they get to security, and give him a good-bye kiss when they get there.
The conversation dies away, both of them waiting for the other one to make the first move. Dean’s skin is thrumming with anticipation, his cock starting to fill with blood just thinking about Castiel’s knot inside him. The only sounds are birds singing, and the wind moving through the leaves. Castiel shifts, staring at Dean’s thighs, and slowly lifts his hand… but leaves it dangling in the air, uncertain.
. That was such a stupid thing to do, but the urge to take care of a distraught and nervous omega had overwhelmed him. Granted, it’s better to give into those instincts than the other ones, but it’s still embarrassing.
Dean stares at the ceiling fan overhead, eyes following the blades as they spin. This is such a fucking mess. Leave it to Dean to develop a big, gay crush on the guy who not only has a girlfriend, but is keeping him at arm’s length for his own protection.
Dean blinks, then nods, affectionately dragging his knuckles over Castiel’s cheek. “Sure. Any requests?”
‘Preoccupied’ is a kind way to put it, as something wooden, a table or chair, clatters against the kitchen floor. Castiel bites his lower lip. “Where are you going to go?”
Sam wolfs his down before running upstairs to do whatever it is twelve year-olds do by themselves, and because Dean knows Sam will be hungry again in an hour, he quickly cleans the kitchen and puts the leftovers in a bowl in the fridge, just enough to keep Sam from tearing the pantry apart before dinner. Cas watches all of this with a little smile, and insists on cleaning his own bowl.
“Very good,” Castiel continues, and Dean is suddenly empty. Then, just as suddenly, he’s not. The head of Castiel’s cock slips inside, and when Castiel hesitates there, still worried about Dean’s comfort, Dean growls and uses his weight to push himself back, sheathing Castiel’s cock all the way to the hilt, like a sword in a stone.
, when Dean arrives at the park. It’s a pleasant morning, though the gray sky in the distance is warning them to stay inside after lunch. Sam jumps out of the bed of the truck and helps Sarah down before darting off to the grassy playing field. Sarah’s figured out how to keep up with Sam pretty well, and Dean’s wondering if she’ll join a girls’ soccer league soon. She’s good enough.
The words aren’t even totally out of Castiel’s mouth before a wide-eyed Dean is shoving a brightly-colored box in his direction, pointing at the tag. It simply reads: “To Dean, From Naomi.”
Meg straightens her back and shoves her hands in the pockets of her leather jacket. She glances at Dean, reassessing him with this new information. “Y’know,” she says in a low voice, leaning into Dean until he can feel her warmth against his side, “the more I learn about you, the more things start to make sense.”
“Don’t care,” Anna snaps. “You really fucked up this time, Dean. I don’t know what the hell you said to him, but you fucked him up bad.” She wraps her arms around herself, staring at the ground. “I’ve never seen him like this before.”
Castiel sighs and gestures for her to go on, but her glare only intensifies at his well-practiced nonchalance.
Dean drops his arms and purses his lips in thought. Castiel waits patiently through the silence, watching Dean’s expression change as he tries to decide where to go next, how to handle yet another apology.
That sets a rhythm. While they kiss, Dean rolls his hips into Cas's, can feel the hard line of Cas's cock against his legs. This isn’t particularly satisfying for either one of them, Dean’s sure of it, so he shifts against, trying to get his knees better placed so that he can sit up straight. A zing of pleasure runs down his spine when Cas whines, but then his hands slide around to rest on Dean’s hips, and for a moment, they just stare at each other, trying to catch their breath.
Dean blushes, taken aback by this admission. Sure, he’d dreamed about mating Castiel, but he hadn’t thought that the alpha would admit to doing the same. A quiet, “Aw,” reminds him that Charlie is still here, but apparently Castiel is winning her over already. Good. It’ll be nice to have someone else on their side when they get to the castle.
Oh, and for the record: this chapter is mostly fluff and porn :) It does deal with some of the grosser or more uncomfortable aspects of sex, but for the most part it should be pretty fun. I hope you all enjoy! Oh, and of course, Merry Christmas to those who celebrate!
And yes, the number of chapters has changed - I opted to do this because I ended up cutting this chapter short and I think re-organizing for slightly shorter chapters will help with both update times and my stress levels, lol. Don't worry, the chapters will still be a decent length, they'll just hopefully arrive a little faster this way.
Dean takes a few deep breaths before sitting up on his elbows. He’s still sweating, his body feeling oddly heavy as he pushes the blankets down to his knees. He didn’t come this time, and while it’s a relief that he doesn’t have to deal with come-stained boxers and blankets, there’s still the problem of his raging boner. His breath is coming slow and ragged, and those images won’t leave his mind: Cas spread out beneath him, Lisa straddling Cas’s face, and Dean swears, running a hand over his face.
Chuck smiles back, then leans into his chair, getting comfortable. “Your mother always seems to forget that I didn’t come from old money, like she did. Your grandfather worked very hard his entire life and his bookstore only started paying off when he started opening them up as a chain. I was a teenager by then. And even that was only enough to pay for college and help me start my life.” He pauses, taking a few bites of ice cream. “You know your mother only wants what’s best for you.” When Castiel frowns, Chuck holds up a hand, setting his bowl aside and facing his son. “She does. I mean that. She wants you to have opportunities and to know all the best people. But,” Chuck quickly adds, as Castiel opens his mouth, “But, she may not have realized that she was depriving you of the chance to decide what opportunities you want, and what people you think are the best.”
Cas’s smile widens slightly, but he quickly covers it up with a tilt of his head and a casual shrug. “Eh, I guess. I don’t want you to cry or anything.”
Castiel hesitates. It’s a stupid question, the more he thinks about it. It’s possessive and selfish, and he knows that there’s no answer Aaron can give that won’t end up with Castiel angry and hurt. But, considering Dean was Castiel’s first kiss, his first sexual experience, and that Castiel is still technically a virgin and can really only see sharing that with Dean… Well. He wants to know what’s left. If Dean can give him something in return. Maybe that makes him a romantic, or naive, or selfish, but Castiel doesn’t care.
