"Right, alright, right." He rubbed his free hand over his mouth. His eyes were stinging, and probably too wide. He knew he looked and sounded like a crazy man right now, but this was big.
They were all too tense to sleep and it was boring being cooped up. Natacha had found herself agreeing with James' frequent complaint that he wished Tony would come back (though of course he didn't have to make himself such a pill whining about it). All had been as calm as she could expect to hope for, and then father had come storming through the door of the room like someone possessed.
When he spoke again the captain’s eyes had darkened, his tone taken on a fierceness that Tony hadn’t heard since his first days at the villa, but it was his eyes, bare and full of pain that cut through Tony like a blade.
“Why are you here now?” Tony barked, because there was for sure a reason and it made his skin crawl with anxiety. The abbot was gone. The coup had failed. Stefen was in hot water with his superiors. Coulson wouldn’t risk coming here if it weren’t for something important.
What wasn’t to like? Adorable children, a singing monk. I thought it was very fun – but the play understood more of what it was like, to grow up at that time.
“What does it look like?” He snapped, in no mood or mindset for another fight. “The children will sleep with us tonight.”
“You’re not asking. I’m offering. Three minds are better than two and with my tools, you stand a better chance than if I don’t go, so I’m going. I’ll get you to Poland-” Péter turned to Natacha who was still gripping his arm tightly and laid his hand over hers. “And then I’ll turn around and get on the first train home. I’ll be back before you can even start to miss me.”
Ian glanced back at Da who was as still as a statue, but this time his gaze was on them again, on Ian. This time, for the first time, Ian could read the strange expression on his face and he felt the floor drop out from underneath him.
“Let me guess, drive the fever up? Not a bad idea, where bacterial infections are involved, but that man does not have scarlet fever! And without knowing the true cause for his symptoms, the only thing we’re for sure accomplishing here is dehydrating him at a critical hour.”
Artur grabbed his arm and began to tug. Steve thought he had a freakishly strong grip for a boy of seven.
Eventually they were invited to sit at the small conference table in the center of the room. As he sat, Tony flicked a curious glance at the man in the suit yet to be identified, who was now checking the time on a pocket watch. Stefen took the chair next to Tony and frowned at the stranger.
“It was good. I hope?” Stefen asked, a statement turning question somewhere in the middle and Tony laughed, feeling such a swell of fondness for him that he found himself moving up on his toes to kiss him without thinking. He aborted the movement with a sheepish smile. The captain looked confused by the odd motion.
James blinked up at him in surprise as Tony sat the roll back on Ian's plate without comment, making his way over to Maria who was dragging her elbow in her meat sauce.
So not getting caught by Pepper (or god forbid any of the other staff) was essential, because Stefen was hardly going to be impressed with Tony getting caught where he shouldn’t be like a naughty child.  He needed to do it during the day he decided, because even he wasn't slick enough to talk his way out of being found in the captain’s study after hours. Performing the search during the day when everyone was up and about meant he had to be quick and stealthy, which proposed a problem because there was still the matter of a locked door and nothing was more suspicious than trying to pick a lock in broad daylight.
“My grandmother’s heart broke to lose her only child that way.” Stefen went on. “She was always very sickly… I got that from her I think, but the heartsickness was worse after that. On her deathbed she begged my grandfather to go after my mother and take her
Ian suppressed a ping of guilt. He wasn't keeping his promise. He should have made sure James was getting ready too. James had been so stroppy, ever since father had left to be with the men before the big ceremony. His mood had gone south even more so yesterday morning when Uncle Bucky had swanned in at breakfast with his suitcase in toe.
Pietro talked more than his sister. He talked really fast actually when you got him going. He liked to tell wild stories and didn't seem to mind being badgered by the little ones constant questions or requests to play.
Tong gave her a couple of rapid instructions, pleased when she nodded and hurried off to see it done. He straightened up as Stefen leaned closer, catching Tony’s gaze and flicking his eyes poignantly toward the crowd.
Péter watched helplessly as Herr Stark shoved past their butler. He’d not waited for the door to completely open before he was rushing up the steps, leaving Péter and his siblings clustered in the entrance way.
But then again why would he? He was probably still just on edge after his talk with Hammer, Steve reasoned to himself. He could only imagine what Bucky might have had to say to the butler to assure the man kept what had happened with the flag to himself.
Péter leaned over and spit blood out of his mouth. Digging his fingers against the cold surface of the floor he pushed himself up, climbing shakily to his feet.
"How many were you expecting?" Bucky just heaved an aggravated breath and Tony shot him a look he hoped begged for the other man to just work with him on this, because Stefen was wound tightly and not in any place to think clearly. Stefen wanted to beat himself up, not Bucky, Tony knew that, but those two had the strangest sort of pact that they were free to knock each other over the head in substitute of punching bags; and there was no time for it now. Fighting over what they couldn't change wasn't going to help a damn thing.
When the morning of the twenty third arrived, Tony rose from his bed early, barely having slept and crept up to the attic to run one more test.
Scapa flow, home of the British Fleet, was a deep-water anchorage in the heart of the Orkney Islands. It was almost in the direct path of German naval traffic coming out of the North Sea, and while at first glance it looked impregnable, the first months of the war had proven it was anything but. Many new defense measures had been implemented since the attack in October that had sunk The Royal Oak battle cruiser, and the air raid that had followed it.
"The pleasure is mine,” she demurred. “We're so grateful you could arrange to come on such short notice. The Captain and I are a bit out of our depth. A propaganda tour, can you imagine? It’s wonderful that the children will get to see so much of the country and boost the spirits of our soldiers, but it’s quite the undertaking."
"Frau Hogan?" the baroness called to her, a hint of scold in her tone and the housekeeper shifted closer to the bed, as if she half expected the other woman to try and snatch at her.
“It’s not break time, pick it up!” one of the boys was ordering gruffly and the old man bent his crooked back slowly to comply, bones creaking.
“I’m peachy. Just grand!” He cut Stefen off, gasping through the hysteria fluttering through his chest. He caught Steve’s eye and gestured wildly between them. “But you and me, Stevie. We gotta have a talk.”
“The rumors are startling to be sure, but as a ruling force we have to maintain-” Zimmerman began to defend himself but Kroger scoffed and interrupted him.
James had returned only to confirm that the family doctor Erskine had been arrested two days prior. There was no more help to be had. There was nothing to do but tend to Stefen the best they could and hope that he pulled through.
Quietly, not trusting the bustle of the station to completely mask their conversation Steve whispered, “I can’t risk it. Give Falsworth my message and have him contact Frau D’anvers. Tell them I’ll get the letter to them as soon as I can.”
"If we can't risk using the port the twins will have to come here until we have another way to get them to safety."
"It will be alright pet. You'll see. Would it help to sing?" She murmured and Deiter looked over at her with surprise, unsure he'd heard her right. "Surely you've heard they sing Lieutenant?" Baroness Schrader asked with an amused lift of her brow and he returned his eyes to the road, a flush of red creeping up his neck.
“But horses get tired and that is a lot of land to cover.” Tony pointed out. “It seems Péter would need a steed capable of flight to be able to cover that much ground so quickly. Not to mention strong enough to carry him."
"How did they know?" Steve wondered aloud. They'd been so careful. The handoff had gone without a hitch. "Could someone on the crew be a spy?"
“Come on Natacha.” Péter prompted, nudging her side. “Unless you think I’ve gotten better at it than you.”
“Ian!” The boy called out with a terrified tremor just before Tony had reached him and then he slipped under the water.
Steve followed behind Tony as he moved to the next stall, this woman selling bobs and ends and bright bolts of fabric. There was a man standing too close on Tony’s right side. His gaze was focused on some fabric on display, but Steve thought rather too intently. Steve stepped around to the right, close enough that there would be no way the fellow couldn’t feel him looming there. The fellow cast a wary look over his shoulder before giving up interest in the cloth and moving away. Steve watched him disappear into the crowd.
“Ian, Sara, and her potter made the best of it, traveling from town to town always wondering where the next meal would come from, and it wasn’t helped any that her baby was small and sickly and could not be left alone.
Steve repressed a snarl as heads bobbed and voices nodded in agreement with the thought that the children detained indefinitely at the institution in Munster, many of them half
“Another family moved on this morning and three beds have opened up. You can stay the night but not beyond that. Many suffering families depend on this synagogue for charity, but if the authorities discover they are giving refuge to foreigners they will shut it down.”
And then, as if Steve weren’t knocked back enough a chorus of voices answered Tony, and if he weren’t staring at them lined up in front of the piano Steve would not have believed that
“Ciao?” she called into the silence when Tony still had not found the power of speech and he jumped like an engine kicking into life.
Harry had come to the park with Johann, who Péter learned would also be attending the academy that year. Péter didn’t know one of the girls with them but he recognized the pretty blond as one of his former classmates. Gwendolyn Staša had always been shy and sweet and popular with the other girls in the classroom as well as the boys. Harry used to tease her by pulling out her hair ribbons.
He was. But being alive could hold horrors not even death could match, and living with himself if he continued to do nothing was one of them.
Had he ever felt something so warm before? He thought not and recognized on some level that it was a sad thing not to remember. But he was just glad to lay at night listening to the stuttering snores and steady heartbeat of another being besides himself. He would burrow down with one hand on the goat, always, always, touching him in some way, and Patroche would let him. Gentle after all. A good boy.
“Get yourself a pair of shoes that fit and cut that hair.” Steve smiled wryly as the boy scowled placing a protective hand ontop his head of dark blond hair. He still snatched the bill from Steve’s hand readily enough, stuffing it quickly into his pocket and running off, likely so that Steve wouldn’t have time to change his mind about giving him such a large sum.
Peggy had been so frail at the end; a shell of the beautiful vivacious woman Charlotte had looked up to her whole life.
Stark went to kneel beside Steve, examining his injuries with his hands even as he kept a careful eye on Bucky with an accusatory glare. Bucky could hear the children behind them, likely gathered in the kitchen doorway watching the drama unfold with horrified expressions. He could hardly bring himself to care. What was the damn point anyway?
After the meal he’d made his way to the day room near his own quarters. He hadn’t written to either Farkas or Rogers yesterday, and he couldn’t put it off much longer.
He found he couldn’t quite think of it in terms of only Peggy's anymore. Now it belonged to Maria as she plinked out chords and made her way up and down the scales under Tony’s watchful eye. Now it belonged to Tony as he coached the children, or like now when he came to savor a rare moment of solitude, performing old songs from memory and getting lost in them.
Steve reached down and stroked the animal’s head, rubbing just behind the hinge of the jaw like the animal liked.
"He didn't give me a key! Not because he wouldn't trust me with one - don't glare at me Bakhuizen, I saw how quickly you assumed he must have! I wouldn’t hurt him and you damn well know it, but he thinks I'm the one who needs protecting while he takes all the risks."
No. That wasn’t quite right either. He didn’t just want to be Stefen’s lover. Tony’d had plenty of lovers over the years (four or five, which for a monk practically made him Casanova). He did not want to be someone whom Stefen bed and then set aside, or kept at arm-length from his troubles or his children. He wanted to share in every joy imaginable, yes, but more prevalent to their current situation Tony wanted to share in every burden just as staunchly.
“I think.” Tony began slowly, past the curious melting sensation in his chest, “That’s a very kind thought. But there’s only so much room in your bag.”
“We’ve all come here to put a good face on this ridiculous decision. The least you can do is show my daughter a little respect and dance with your fiancé.” Charlotte’s father the Count leaned close and hissed lowly at Stefen. He didn’t seem all that perturbed that Tony might hear, but that was the gentry for you. Tony could recite each of his father’s many long tirades against them verbatim. The worth and the meaning their titles might have dissolved along with the empire after the Great War, but their sort would go to their graves still holding their noses up.
“Why are you wearing that old skirt?” Steve heard Tony ask from a distance, like the monk was speaking at the other end of a long hall even though he’d only moved the skant feet between the bottom of the stairs and the arch leading into the kitchen. “It’s at least three inches too small now.”
"Oh excuse me - Captain! Merry Christmas!" Hogan called out brightly and he was quickly echoed by a chorus of voices wishing him a merry Christmas and offering him a seat at the table in turn.
Ian wanted to back up, but there was nowhere to go. And he wouldn’t, even if he could. He tried to keep himself perfectly straight as General Striker turned toward the audience, clasped his hands behind his back and declared that Germany’s future was secure with soldiers such as these to live and die for the good of the present and future of the German empire.
Their father hoisted Artur higher on his hip and turned back toward the house, gesturing for him and James to follow. “Come inside, boys. There is something important I have to tell you.”
Tony remembered with a pang in his chest, Maria and Artur hiding in the closet under the stairs to stop him leaving the villa. He smiled sadly.
A moment later however his nose twitched, the familiar scent of coffee wafting through the room and he kicked the covers off, blinking blearily through sleep gummed eyes, following his nose to where Bakhuizen was standing beside the bed sipping smugly from a tall mug.
He wasn’t just a stupid boy fighting off boredom in an old stable anymore. He was building a boat that Stefen and his friends would escape in. Risk their lives in. Fight the Reich in. Twice as fast as anything out there wasn’t good enough any longer.
And of course Péter nodded because like Tony he had been raised at mass like any good catholic boy; but even Hughard’s best attempts to control his home and put their best socially and politically aligned foot forward had been enough to completely silence Maria Carboni or her pride in her heritage.
“Promise me you’ll think about Péter? It’s a relief to know that you’ve decided to send them all away and I trust you know what you’re doing-” Tony began, and Steve was torn between frustration and admiration because
And then there was Bucky himself. He didn’t seem to be doing so well in the following rules department either.  Still, a fella could try.
“I was only a little younger myself when I realized. I had something of a crush on a boy who worked for us. His name was Rhodey.” Tony chuckled sadly. “I was so afraid my father would find out. It used to keep me up at night, imagining what he would have done to Rhodey if he knew.”
“Well then, you should know Father will expect you to organize our meals and see to the washing of our clothes. He had Frauline Glass giving him wake up calls so I imagine if you’d like to be half as impressive you’ll have to do that as well.” The advice was so blandly given, flung his way so carelessly, as if the girl were already bored with it and moving on to better thoughts, that had Tony truly had no prior experience with great houses like these he would have believed her. As it was he knew damn well that a house this size had servants and a housekeeper whom he’d only annoy and disrupt if he attempted to take over such household duties as the cooking and the cleaning; and he had no idea whatsoever why the Captain would have required a wakeup call from the ever more interesting Frauline Glass (though he could hazard a guess or two) but he very much doubted he’d welcome the same coming from Tony.
lion. I’m jeopardizing my cover to save your neck here and strangely I haven’t heard so much as a thank you.”
"I have no idea how your sister knows that but yes, and if your uncle is to believed then yes again."
Grig nodded his head toward Stefen, still doing pushups upon the ground entirely focused upon the task and nothing else. “ - inspires such friendship.”
Technically the house was his, held in trust along with Stark Industries until Tony’s death or the end of his voluntary confinement at the abbey, whichever came first; but like the company, Tony would have had to work within the law to claim it. Which meant that from the day Stanislov’s hired thugs had murdered Yinsen and chased Tony behind abbey walls, everything there had belonged to him.
No. Steve grit his teeth and pushed back the shame. The despair. No. Not his children. Not for Sara and Natacha. Not for Péter. Not for Ian, or any of them. Not for -
"Cameron's not sick," Sara interjected and Stefen fell silent, staring down at her curiously. "He's napping by the shed."
“It got you to stay.” Stefen shrugged, looking wholly unapologetic and Tony wanted to be more irritated than he was. But since he really just couldn’t be, he chuckled and leaned back over to kiss Stefen soundly. He shivered as Stefen took control of the kiss, his hands moving up to frame Tony’s face and hold him still as he deepened the kiss, tongue delving bolding inside Tony’s mouth.
Rain was a miserable business that Tony was going to do away with someday. Someday, when he was not running like a beaten dog with its tail tucked between its legs. Someday soon. Today it rained.  The sky had been dark and gray for two days straight, the rain coming down in steady torrents that showed no sign of letting up.
As they past shops, practices, parks, and places Steve had known since he was a very young soldier (places Sam had known since he was a boy) Sam pointed them out. He told Steve about the underground music clubs (a motley crew of musicians and other passionate fools playing with the jazz sound coming out of America to hear him tell it), the first shop he’d ever delivered to after he’d followed his father from the farm his family worked, the first place he'd ever taken a girl (Der Nachtfalter nightclub) and the alley behind a shop where he and his friends used to go for a haircut (a clerk named Einar would cut their hair for a krone each, one after the other after his shift).
Dinner that night was a quiet affair. The air of misery that had been hovering all afternoon had not dissipated, settling comfortably over the children's heads like the wettest of blankets. Even Sara seemed to know it was a night to be miserable. The only time any of them had spoken was when Natacha had asked if any word had come from their father.
“There is a ship waiting in Belgium to take the twins to England.” Tony blinked, startled at the bald honesty Stefen offered him so quietly. He looked up just as Stefen took another step toward him. “We found someone at the immigration office willing to forge their papers. I can’t tell you more than that, Tony. The less you know-”
Steve frowned disapprovingly at hearing the child once more be so familiar with an adult. He hadn’t felt right bringing it up before because he’d been riddled with guilt for practically maiming Stark, and he found he couldn’t bring himself to say anything now because his sullen James was bright eyed and ruddy cheeked and looked entirely too serious as he finished with, “good engineers always know there’s something to do better next time and they aren’t discouraged by that. Right Tony?”
“If you do, it will make people think twice before they believe these nasty rumors that are circulating.” Charlotte reminded her. “If you don’t, it will only further entrench their beliefs. And as you said, a rebel in the family is dangerous for everyone.”
"Frauline Werner could not find an envelope this afternoon and was forced to fetch one from your drawers. She was certain you would not mind."
Steve’s breath hitched and he gritted his teeth against the swell of pain in his chest. His leg throbbed underneath him and he eyed his desk chair consideringly.
He did. Well when it suited him. It suited him now to keep every promise he’d made to her, to each of them. Which might be why all the promises he’d made to them could be counted on one hand. Tony had learned long ago the delicate math of lowering the average of broken promises.
This kiss was not as seductive as the others. It was deep and tender, and if it lingered, it was only because he seemed desperate to savor it. That was a feeling Tony knew all too well, and Stefen was not the only one to blame for how slow their lips were to part this time or how close they remained when they paused for breath, just staring into one another’s eyes.
He looked at Ian, who was smiling and singing along with the others to lyrics he didn’t really know, and it was hard to breathe with the weight of his gratitude. That they are all here, having this moment, was a miracle of Tony’s influence. Every day was like waking up from a hundred years of sleep - and though his body still aches and his muscles are slack with atrophy Steve take another staggering step toward home every moment that he spends with them.
Red inched up Tony’s neck and he shifted. He had no doubt it was because Steve was staring but he couldn’t seem to stop. This man was… Steve struggled to find the words for it, but wonderful came to mind. Tony was wonderful.
“You couldn’t have warned me you were meeting with the Nazis this morning?” Tony shut the door of Nik’s office with a snap. He was still trembling from the encounter in the corridor but he tried desperately not to show it. Nik’s office was dark despite the time of day. Tony suspected Nik preferred it that way, like a bat or some other nocturnal creature. How else would he look mysterious and intimidating behind his oak desk shrouded in dark robes if not for the compliment of harsh shadows?
“Who hasn’t? You can’t work a ship that isn’t Stark made. Though it’s just not been the same since the old man died. He had the touch.”
There was no denying Rogers had a certain...presence. His command while uncommon for someone so, well, common, was the best Frank had ever been under but he was not the typical sort of commander by any stretch of the imagination. Rogers slept in the sparse company barracks with the non-commissioned officers and left piles of paperwork to be done (God knows when he found time to do it) on his desk. And because he was always with the men, it meant Becker was always with them as well.
Stark, whoever he was and whatever he was hiding, truly seemed to care for the children. Perhaps for now it was enough and between the two of them they could do a little damage in Steve's pristine little world. The closer he kept Stark the sooner he could figure out what he was about, and you know what they say, odd men must stick together.
, good for nothing but running his mouth and drinking his money and it wasn’t like we had any of that to spare.
Artur sent the whole boat rocking, which had Maria making small panicked noises and clinging desperately to the edge once more.
She knew it wasn’t that simple. Some people would never understand what kind of woman could do the things she knew she was capable of; but she could bear that, live with it, so long as he continued to see the best in her.
“What boys?” the captain, no fool, demanded to know and Tony quickly tried to diffuse the situation.
“How are your wounds?” Stefen asked gruffly, apropos of nothing and Tony shifted, turning to appraise him just as carefully as he found himself being appraised.
A shout of triumph from Ian pulled both their attention just in time to see him and James go toppling over into the water. They came back up again, James choking dramatically.
Tony chanced a look in the captain’s direction. Outwardly he appeared preoccupied watching the window as Artur pointed at something outside, but Tony could tell by the clench of his jaw that he had heard.
“Up to no good I tell you.” he barked in the direction of the officers who pointedly ignored him. “She never mentioned a sister to me.”
"And this one is an assfucker, so I guess I am just his type." Bucky retorted, shoving him back and Steve laughed, regretting it when his chest twinged in protest.
A bright, perfectly polished smile bloomed on Charlotte’s face that didn’t meet her eyes as she left Tony’s side and approached Stefen, hand out ready to take his arm.
If anything Steve liked it more. It made Tony seem partly undressed and Steve couldn’t help but imagine getting him the rest of the way there. He’d start with the jacket. Nice as it was, it would be nicer to let the thing slide to the floor of the car and run his hands over the silk shirt beneath, feel Tony’s strong shoulders and the fluttering pulse in his neck.
They sang as only the innocent can, and the crowd joined in with them. The children were loved, as Tony had known they would be. They had reminded all those gathered there that night the dreams that had once unified them all. For a precious moment in time, they were all of them allowed to be children again; easily believing that a great multitude could share a single heart. And for one night at least, they did.
“Yes, yes, calm down now. You’re shaking our small friend here.” Tony interrupted the brewing squabble to gingerly pry the jar from the boy’s hands and hold it up for all of them to see. “Okay, so James has caught what does indeed appear to be a Dusky Large Blue. But the question is, is our friend here male or female?”
“I know you can’t stall him for days, alright? But you can give us a day. I know how clever you are Natacha. If anyone can manage it, it’s you.” He wheedled, because Tony always said flattery never hurt when it came to persuasion. Squeezing her hand once more he pleaded as earnestly as he was able. “Please.”
"Shut up!" Tony hissed with his fists balled. The simmering rage inside of him threatened to boil. It was only Artur's tearful whimpers and the panicked breathing of his terrified siblings gathered outside the doors of their rooms that kept him from trying to pummel the man.
The rope. He could wrap the rope around her neck. He could wrap his bound arms around her and break it too with just the right angle. Where was she? Could he… God. He was thinking too slowly, giving her time to counter. Hell, she’d had enough time to pull out a pistol and shoot him by now.  Panicked at the thought he twisted his head, tears leaking from his eyes as they looked up and met hers. She was standing above him, looking as if she hadn't moved from her initial lunge. There was an old gnarled looking goat by her side, with a pair of shaved horns atop its head. She was holding it by one of its stumps, her lips pressed tight together in a disapproving scowl.
"Is that what you think this is about?" Stefen growled, the unforgivable edge of hurt underlining each word. Gesturing wildly toward the window he thundered, "You think I give a damn about those people?!"
If Stefen wasn't going to trust him with the details of his operation and its mission, he'd just have to go and get the details himself. Maybe if Tony had plucked up the courage to confront Farkas all those years ago about why his father had really sent him to the abbey, he would have learned of Stanislov’s possible involvement in their murders sooner, and maybe he could have done something worthwhile to avenge their deaths – his mother’s death – rather than sit on his ass all those years.
“Father wants us to be a proper, sensible, family. That means no nonsense James. Good families like ours don’t carry on like common gypsies.” She held her head up and if Tony hadn't been looking straight at her he might have believed her. He was looking at her however and could not miss the look she sent James way.
“Father, Tony- ” Péter blanched at the glower that Rogers sent in his direction and amended quickly. “Herr Stark took us into town and we were fine. Weren’t we?” He glanced around at his siblings who all nodded eagerly, continuing to plead silently with their eyes.
“Let me let you in on a secret bambino, all the screaming and fussing in the world won’t make them see you any better. They’ll just write you off all the quicker.”
“It was your mother’s. I had it taken to the tinker’s shop, so it should work.” Stefen explained from Péter’s right. Stefen was wearing the party well, with his twinkling eyes and wind tousled hair, but his nerves in that moment were betrayed in the tension of his shoulders. Tony had to look down to hide his smile.
“Well, aren’t you going to speak to him?” Sophie needled her, brown eyes doe like as she snuck another look over their shoulders at Emil. Tall Emil, whose new father was an S.S. officer because he’d turned his old one in for refusing to allow him to join the HJ. Handsome, fair, blue eyed Emil who said he didn’t mind that she was almost as tall as he was and that she still had a chest like a boy. Emil who swore up and down he was going to become second only to the Führer.
Maria clutched Tony tightly and he clutched her back, head swimming as he tried to process everything this meant.
“Ah, so it’s jewelry then. Great minds truly do think alike.” Tony chattered brightly as he walked around the bed to the nightstand and looked inside for the gift. He found it almost immediately as the little white box wasn’t wrapped and sat on top of the books inside the little drawer as if it had been set there at pride of place.
“It's nothing,” Steve hissed between his teeth, squeezing an arm around his middle. Bending double just increased the pain but his breath was hitching in his lungs and when he looked up into Virginia’s worried face it swam before him. He closed his eyes trying and failing to grasp a decent breath.
"I have nothing more to say on it Tony." Steve overrode his objection with a stern stare until the monk had closed his mouth again with a frustrated snap, understanding that the subject was closed. But of course, the monk wasn't finished. Tony never was.
With a sense of dread Steve sniped open the envelope, dreading its contents. It was the same as before. Steve flicked through the letter his stomach dropping with each line.
"Yes Baroness?" the maid panted as she rounded the corner at a near run, eyes darting franticly between Frau Hogan and her mistress as if she expected to catch the woman trying to strangle Charlotte with her bare hands. Charlotte's mouth tilted toward a smile. She'd miss Milthede most of all when she was gone.
"Indeed." the warden snarled. "You of course understand why we will need to search you before you come any further?"
“If you’re looking for a damn solution-” Steve started to snarl and Khammler’s head snapped up, his gaze hard with warning. Perhaps mercifully, Göring chose that moment to bluster loudly once more.
A hysterical giggle bubbled up inside of Steve and he just barely held it back. Hysterical. He couldn’t afford that either. He opened his mouth to… To what, threaten her?
There had been so much to love about Pola. The salt in the air, the sweet smell wafting up from the bakers stalls down in the market juxtaposed against the pungent smell of fish and port city life. In Pola there had been the Rhuza boy, who had come to work in their kitchen and whom Hughard had not tossed out on his head despite their fears (not at first anyway). Tony had called him Rhodey, on account of the island his father had been born on and the stories the older boy had recited to him as they’d strolled the beaches (imagine an island surrounded by flowers!).
“You took the twins to meet his ship in Belgium.” He recounted and Stefen nodded slightly in acknowledgment.
"He wouldn't do that. He's one of us. Aren't you Spider?" Péter fought the urge to blush as he nodded and answered.
A tiny sliver of possession curled inside of Tony. Irrational though it was, a small part of him couldn't help but feel Bucky was partially to blame Stefen’s current state. He should have been there. He’d had more freedom to move, and he should have hurried. He could have stopped this.
“Oh, it’s not your character.” Charlotte waved her hand as if to wave away his concern. “But your grief was so heavy, after poor Margit left us… She worries, that you will never love me as you loved her. Of course, I told her that was ridiculous. That neither one of us was silly enough to think that our union was based on love, or that it needs to be.”
Not appeased by any degree, Stefen made to get up again and Tony pushed him back once more, this time with more force. In another circumstance Tony might have found the kitten flailing Stefen was doing trying to bat his hands away cute. But now, it just served as a frightening reminder of how close he’d come to losing him, that Tony could manhandle him with one hand.
The children’s lessons had improved but there was no easy solution for the heat of the schoolroom, the length of the days, or the fact that with each day that passed the children missed their father more. Tony’s last letter from the Captain had been both surprising in its candidness and frustrating in the contradictions it continued to present him in regards to the captain’s character. He’d not expected Rogers to take his antics with such humor, nor to accept Tony’s thinly veiled criticism with such grace. He had definitely not expected Rogers to open up about anything personal. But for some inexplicable reason Stefen (Stefen Gavril Rogers) had seemed to find Tony’s rebellion funny (one might even have called his tone teasing in return) and for some reason even more inexplicable he’d chosen to share thoughts that Tony seriously doubted he’d shared with anyone else.
The smirk had returned to the boy’s face as he nodded, and Tony snorted shaking his head. Some people had some nerve. And he wasn’t grinning. His mouth had developed a tick that was all.
"My nephew. " Mueller explained, reading the question in Steve’s eyes. "My sister's son, but now I am proud to call him my own. "
It smacked him in the face on the way down, but Tony grabbed ahold of it gladly, using the secured rope to climb the rest of the way inside of the loft with ease.
They'd kept a low profile amid the crowd of fifty or so, and the authorities at both stations had barely even glanced at their documents before waving them on. Tony’s uncle was one of their escorts but that didn’t mean Steve had relaxed his guard any since they’d left Pola that morning.
"Herr. Stark" Lt. Stevens called at his back and Tony paused, debating for a moment whether or not to turn around. The lieutenant had not been a cruel jailor, but he was still standing between them and freedom. He'd still put those cuffs on Stefen and carted him away to torture and death. But there was a kind of pleading woven into the officer's tone, a 'beg pardon' that some dark curiosity in Tony couldn't ignore and when he turned around to look at the man once more the lieutenant had braced himself, with his hands behind his back like someone prepared for a blow.
“Ah but look at you.” Dr. Vonkov smiled across the table at Tony with all his teeth. “Here we are at the proudest moment in our history, ready to reclaim the glory that was once ours, and what have you contributed? Prayers.”
The captain and the baroness had returned late from whatever party they’d been schmoozing at and by then Tony was trapped in bed with the three youngest wrapped around him like octopi.
“Halt prisoner!” He heard Dvorak scream behind him, but he didn’t look back, running with every bit of strength left in him and praying that it would be enough.
That feeling of unease blossomed again in Dvorak's stomach, winding up his nerves like a mechanical toy. Dr. Fischer stepped toward the bed, his briefcase in hand and took control of the room with the firm measured bedside manner of a good physician.
It was so still and quiet up here on top of the mountain with nothing but the wind, the falling snow, and his imagination to fill in the gaps. He imagined frequently that he’d heard a branch snap or the crunch of footsteps as the hours of night crawled tortuously by. How could one sleep with all that gaping silence?
“I appreciate the advice, but I’m the adult, Ian” Tony replied. “I look after you, not the other way around.”
If Stark meant to attempt some sort of blackmail, he had another thing coming if he thought Bucky was going to play that game. He'd feared this might happen. Seen it happen to some of the other guys. Any display of weakness and the wolves come salivating to the door.
“Daniel Bohmer!” Nik interjected with a snap and Tony tensed. “Kristoff Hochberg, Rachel Schnieder-”
It was silent in the wake of Tony's words and Stefen wanted to scream at him, but he knew it was the shame that made him feel that way. The way Tony was looking at him struck a nerve deep inside him. It had the feeling of shame welling up like black oil seeping through his chest cavity, and along with it a rush of resentment.
When the operator, a politely bored sounding young woman, finally announced herself Tony gave her the number Stefen had left and drummed his fingers upon the table while he waited to be connected.
“I understood the risks well enough when I subscribed to the magazine Stefen. Nothing has changed.” She spoke with carefulness as she took the seat next to him on the worn couch. She primly smoothed the wrinkles of her apron before pinning him with a frank stare.
She’d eventually scuttled away from him to hide and peer at him from behind Starks legs. She’d ignored all of Bucky’s sweet pleading, clinging close too Stark and shooting him distrustful looks when she thought he wasn't looking.
There was so much ground we had to cover between Steve coming home and Steve leaving again that we've written A LOT and you'll be getting another chapter shortly. The bad news is this is long. Sorry?
"Would you care for a seat?" Stefen asked pointedly. He was clearly uncomfortable with being stared at and Tony wondered if it was because he wasn't as put together as he normally was. Even Tony wasn't vain enough to presume that it was because of his presence alone.
He still remembered the first time he’d held it. The way it had gleamed in the firelight. The impeccable craftsmanship, made by his grandfather’s withered but sure hands (hands that had taught a hundred others and been taught by similar hands). It was simple in design, but beautiful for that in Steve’s mind, built to withstand a lifetime of travels and hardship. Just like they were.
Tony grunted as the air punched out of his chest. The captain was angry, but he'd not been expecting to find the door slammed behind him and to be pressed up against it with two hundred pounds of muscle bearing down on him almost as soon as he crossed over the threshold, but there he was, nose to nose with the captain as he all but snarled, "Do you have any idea what you've done, Stark any idea!"
“I wish I could be more of a help to you.” He murmured helplessly. “But the last thing I want to do is promise something I can’t deliver. I’m not my father… Uncle Obie will tell you. I was always disappointing him. I wouldn’t want to disappoint the Führer that way.”
As the last notes of the song faded Bucky stood and clapped, the kids beaming up at him with joyfully smug expressions as he met their eager inquiries, assuring them that they’d been the very best he’d ever heard and that yes he thought their father would have loved it. Privately Bucky made a promise to himself that Steve would be with him next time even if he had to drag him by his hair.
Ian pushed past Dagmar and ran to hug Tony. Tony didn’t look startled to hear Ian call him that, just desperately relieved. He let out a ragged sort of cry as their bodies collided and held onto Ian so tight, he almost crushed him but Ian didn’t care. Tony was there and that meant Ian wasn’t alone anymore.
The guard began to unlock the short chain that was bolted into the wall, sparing him a contemptuous look as he did so.
Steve’s stomach twisted, imagining the close call but he simply nodded briskly opening the envelopes to examine the folded documents within. Immigration papers for Anya and Péter Maximoff, officially stamped and everything.
“Not stupid.” Tony blinked in surprise at the sound of Stefen’s voice and catching his breath at the earnest expression that met him. Stefen leaned closer, jaw working stubbornly as his hand reached to cover Tony’s, and it was only then that he realized he was pressing the pen so ardently to the paper he was in danger of breaking it.
Because something had changed with Stefen. Tony couldn’t say why it was, but the Stefen who had come through the door that afternoon was different from the man who had left them, who was even more different still from the cold man Tony had met that first day in the music room.
Finally, she furrowed her brow looking deep in thought before her blue eyes seemed to focus on him and really acknowledge him.
“Hasn’t anyone ever warned you about sour faces?” an upside down face appeared in Bucky’s vision as James snickered at him. The boy was stretched up on the tip of his toes leaning over the arm of the lounge chair that Bucky was laying on so that their noses were almost brushing.
But things were different now. Steve was a captain in the German army and definitely a traitor by anyone's standards. His superiors suspected it but couldn’t prove it.
My favorite were the dancing girls.” Bucky answered winking down at James who beamed up at him and went on a story about how Tony had said he’d designed their bosoms too big, but James thought they looked better that way; just like the women at the opera. Bucky laughed, and squeezed the boys shoulder.
Mittlestaedt was by no means as large as some of the printing houses in Vienna, Franz owning just the one press and employing only a few helpers, he was largely in the production of local magazines and bulletins, but it was probably better that way. There would be less scrutiny and fewer eyes watching.
And then Steve is in the middle of his morning run, running around and around the villa in an endless loop no end in sight, but then Tony yells out to him from the veranda and he slows to a stop. Their eyes connect, and he breathes in deep and slow, heart thudding loudly in his ears.
Tony had always known that there were things about his situation at the abbey that Niklas wasn’t sharing with him; he was clever after all. More than clever. Some would go so far as to call him a genius. He had built his first boat when he was four years old. Which just meant that it had taken him entirely too long to figure out that Obie had never just been talking about his mother’s Italian roots but her
James, the farthest away, gave Tony and Ian a salty look from his spot by the driveway before turning back to the business of kicking pebbles.
"Let's bring him in. The Abwehr is very interested in hearing from this witness." Agent Neuman was saying.
He had hoped to get a chance to speak to Stefen the night they arrived, but Tony had not been able to find a moment when either one of the children or the baroness was not at his side and then she and the captain had left for the night to attend some dinner.
She was staunchly ignoring Hammer’s pinched look. Tony could practically hear the butler’s internal screech, aghast at the impropriety. It was not at all the done thing.
“I had thought to share them with the maids but there wasn’t time,” he drawled in response and Steve gave him a stern look.
and known to play fast and loose with his vows of celibacy at that.  He wasn’t fit company for polite society let alone small impressionable children.
Tony’s thoughts kept orbiting the same grim thoughts, circling a wild but unfounded fear. What happens when they realize borders don’t work? What’s the solution then?
They made love that night, much slower than the first time. They’d stripped each other in the dark of the hotel suite and lain in the bed, pressed skin to skin. Steve had touched every inch of him, feeling strangely that he would never truly know Tony until he’d kissed every inch of his body and memorized every line and scar. And he had to memorize them. There was no telling when they’d be together again after this trip.
He knew the answer even though it sat heavy in his chest, at war with every instinct he possessed as a father.
“Wait, where are you going?” Grig called after him, jogging to keep pace. “Now isn’t really the time to be wandering about on your own.”
He sighed, rubbing Sara’s hand with the tips of his fingers. He’d find a way to make sure they’d be taken care of, and at least there was Stark. They’d be in good hands.
Stefen would hate this. The thought kept repeating itself over and over in Tony’s mind, cutting all the deeper with each go around. It made Tony positively sick to think of him coming home to see that
"You with me now Ginger?" he asked, stroking up and down her back the same way she'd seen someone rub a spooked horse.
“Then go. Now. Get her out of here.”  Steve waited only long enough to make sure the boy listened, melted into the night like a shadow with Emma in his arms. He hated to leave the man (her father?) but there was nothing he could do for him, not when he had to get to his own children. Steve turned and ran down the street.
That terror that he’d witnessed in Stefen’s eyes couldn’t be explained away by whatever rebellion he was involved in, because if that was the case he had only to stop. With what he had to lose Tony might not even have judged him too harshly. But Stefen did not behave like a man afraid of the consequences of his actions. He behaved like the hunted.
As it turned out, even surrounded by friends with the slow drag of alcohol swimming through his veins, he still couldn't shake the odd feeling of edginess creeping through him.
“Tony!” Maria, who was standing knee deep in snow with her hand tightly clutching Artur's turned and saw him first. Her voice carried, but it was nothing compared to the noise coming from the platform on the other side of the train. At least he hoped.  “Tony! Tony the police -” Péter immediately started in once he beat back the fear and saw that the man running toward them really
“Steve,” he pleaded, voice rasping, the coins clinking together as he shifted toward the captain, whose face lifted with surprise at the sound of his boyhood pet name on Tony’s lips. Tony surged toward him, claiming his mouth and Stefen melted against him.
More simply put, he did not see the point in starving ones self to receive words, boons, or earn mercy from a god who was not there.  And yet, here he was.
It had started to rain that evening, one of those late summer productions full of grumbling thunder that promised a sleepless night. But when it appeared that the children would keep to their beds and would not be showing up to provide distraction, eventually Tony decided to do as he always did when sleep avoided him which was to make his way to his work station.
"Our intelligence has reported some small success with narcotics and stimulants. Their research into genetic mutation has yielded little besides agonizing death for their test subjects." Tony could hear the but in his tone before he said it. "But there was a small breakthrough a few months back.  A pair of subjects who responded better than most, and survived the initial round of testing when no one had before... It's hard to even know what to tell you. The things we've heard defy all imagination. It's almost enough to make a man question where God is in any of it."
“Karachonya, Bucky,” Stefen murmured, like he’d been waiting for years to greet him just this way, the Romany sliding off his tongue warm and poignant like a declaration of love. It hit him like a punch to the throat. Bucky murmured something back, something intelligible he hoped, and shuffled to take an empty seat at the table.
They watched as he turned gracefully in the water and came back toward them, popping back up beside Ian who started, nearly tumbling.
“He wants to be ready next time.” Bucky looked down to find Natacha bobbing near his feet, red braids turned almost brown by the water.
“He’s going to perform!” Tony heard a woman murmur excitedly as people took note of what he was carrying. The children’s reputation as performers was spreading throughout Austria and Germany. But Stefen’s face said he knew what Péter was about to ask because he’d gone perfectly still, his gaze locked on the mandolin in Péter’s hands as if he’d seen a ghost. In a very real way, perhaps he had Tony thought, heart beating heavily within his chest as Péter approached the captain.
“I need to speak with you Captain. It’s about the children.” Tony got straight to the point and Stefen’s brow furrowed in concern, eyes darting anxiously into the hallway beyond.
Searching for Charlotte in the crush of bodies Steve’ started in surprise as Duchess Siv appeared beside him looking unbothered at all by the heavy rain. He held his umbrella out for her and she smiled gratefully at him, her red mouth a stark contrast to her pale skin, the sight hitting him rather viciously in the gut.
“Don’t fret Antony,” Nonno consoled, squeezing Tony’s shoulder with one wrinkled hand. “I will come back tomorrow without you and try again.”
The children snickered, muffling the sounds of their mirth with spoonful’s of under their father’s reproachful gaze.
It took Steve’s sluggish brain a moment after Artur had clamped on to his middle to realize that he was really hearing the word come out of Artur’s mouth.
James had already disappeared from the parlor room window, the curtains pulled tight in an unmistakable rejection, and still it took all of Tony's effort to drag his eyes away and look at the man who had spoken to him. Lt. Stevens stood rigidly at his side, his expression deepening the somber lines that had begun to set permanently around his mouth despite being in what some would call the prime of his life. Tony swallowed and looked away. It wasn't the superficial resemblance to Stefen, with the fair hair and the light eyes, that made it so painful to look at the man. It was the way he carried himself - like someone who had planted themselves in the ground under the weight of a burden far bigger than themselves; who had already made their peace with being crushed by it.
“What do you dream about?” Tony asked, the fingers of his hand running gently over the slope of a protruding pelvic bone. Stefen froze, his breathing held tight as he decided whether or not to answer the unexpected question. Tony waited patiently (or as patiently as he was capable anyway) for him to speak.
"Only the children? You know Cap there were a few moments there, you almost convinced me you were enjoying yourself too." Tony quipped and the captain’s mouth twitched again. He crossed his arms behind his back in a distinctly military fashion and turned to face the path ahead of them once more.
“It’s good to see you Sir.” Péter sounded unsure, and Steve could only hope it was because of the way they’d parted. He squeezed Péter’s shoulders.
Father made short work of the buttons with the needle and thread. Ian knew boys that would be embarrassed by their fathers knowing anything about sowing (woman's work) but Ian didn't find it so worrisome.
Herschel opened his mouth, trying to catch the spray of droplets on his tongue, head tilted back like a baby bird. Steve ducked his head and let the spray pound over him. Herschel continued to stand; face turned up. Steve grabbed at him, fingers slipping on the thin rubbery skin of Herschel's arm.
“If Austria had any idea what I want to do to you right now, in the light of day, the public would probably die of shock Tony and I’m fine with that.”
"You know what they say. The clothes make the man" the spry young woman replied with a wink. And then her expression sobered and she leaned closer. "We've got three volunteers along with James. It's not enough to spring the kids by force."
Tony sighed, deliberating for a moment before crossing the room to open the door for him. Péter quickly stepped inside, so geared up to say something that at first he didn’t appear to notice the workshop at all.
Something twitched on Susann’s face and Stefen’s eyes caught the barely perceptible tightening of her lips. Her smile was strained when she answered.
“I’m Herr Stark, the children’s teacher.” Tony explained, finishing his decent down the stairs. Gesturing to the books in his arms he continued, “I’ve just been fetching some more material for the children’s lessons. Is everything alright? Why have the police come?”
Tony could hang the man with a phone call. For a dark moment he wondered if he shouldn’t worry about the gun he knew Stefen carried. His mouth twisted in a bitter smile. Wouldn’t that just be ironic? Losing his life to a jumpy rebel too morally upright to just tell his children too quiet down now and go to sleep.
“Perhaps he is devout?” Natacha suggested the obvious and Frauline Werner’s lips curled in a grin very close to a sneer.
“Why were you yelling?” Maria asked tentatively from beneath Natacha’s arm and father didn’t answer, just ducked his head to press it against Sara’s.
With a clunk of notes Tony dropped his hands and turned in his seat. His expression was blank but for his eyes. Steve had seen that look before in Pietro, Sam, and countless others. More recently he’d seen it in the mirror. It was the look of the hunted, equal parts fear and defiance.
“He is an organizer in the rebel movement and a very dangerous man.” Neuman warned in a low dangerous tone as he straightened up. “If anyone is to try and help the major subvert justice it is him, and he is not above killing statesmen like you and I. You are still a son of the Reich are you not? I would hate to think you and I weren’t on the same side.”
Despite Steve’s agitation Kurt’s grin didn't waver. He waved a hand dismissively prattling, “That’s lovely. Gets you out of being shot at, doesn’t it. I should to have had seven myself.”
But she had always been a practical woman and there were other things besides pride to consider in the matter of what to do about Stefen Rogers.
“When you’re far away, dreaming on the horizon and the words are missing. Know you’re here with me, building bridges over land and sea. You’re with me, my moon, my sun. You’re with me.”
After breakfast was consumed and their bellies could not possibly hold any more, the children ran to get bundled up in their coats. In Artur's case he dogged along at Steve's heals while he fetched his, chattering a mile a minute about what type of tree they had to find.
She didn’t seem to notice the tense feeling of the room or the fact that at least two of its occupants had pulled guns on her. Her eyes fixed immediately on Cameron and he was her sole focus. They all realized why when she breathlessly announced that the captain was back, and a moment later Stefen stepped into view. He wasn’t alone either.
Sometime between then and now he'd gone disturbingly numb. The room danced a little as he refocused his attention on Virginia. She was muttering to herself.
“You'll do it with or without me and someone’s gotta teach you how to be covert.” Bucky answered; frowning down at his cup he muttered, “I think this calls for stronger stuff.”
Steve frowned, his head beginning to ache now more from confusion than pain. Why was she playing this game? No one could be so naive. Or had she truly not realized who he was?  Maybe not. Maybe there really was hope.
Soon he was bed ridden, his cheeks flushed with fever and though the herbal remedy provided some relief Tony knew it wasn’t enough.
“I thought I’d have to leave when Annett Greer started getting misty eyed at the Führer’s promises to start awarding women for having children.” She reminisced with a small naughty grin that made her look like the young girl Steve had met all those years ago, who used to hang on her older cousins every word. “I hear they are to start receiving medals and preferential treatment at stores.”
A match had been struck and all of Salzburg was holding its breath again, to see if this time the flame would catch.
“As a matter of fact, Natacha. I’m not meeting the baroness. I’m taking Wiess to the Vienna station in the morning. I'll be back by-”
“That’s great. I’m not keen on being a tutor anyway,” Tony replied, nodding to Péter as the boy fell back into line. “I prefer friends.” If he’d hoped for some sort of confirmation from Péter his sister didn’t give it a chance as she was already marching her way forward to begin her own introduction.
“Are you sure about this?” Tony asked as he climbed back aboard, so to speak, underthings discarded.
“Flighty as ever. Worse even, if you can imagine it, now that there is so much pressure to enlist. Of course, all Jonny wants to do is race.”
Stefen had Natacha’s foot resting in his lap. He’d removed her shoes and stockings and was cradling her swollen ankle gently between his palms.
Stefen’s voice broke, tapering off into silence and Tony’s heart cracked in his chest. For a bare moment he was alone out there, stripped bare and vulnerable before the crowd, but Tony was at his side an instant later, and Bucky’s violin picked up the slow sad melody and made it soar.
“What were you reading?” the boy asked once he’d taken a few bites of soup, curious blue eyes seeking Tony’s once more.
“Not since half past one. The operators found it necessary to be at home if you can believe that. What do you think, was it the lateness of the hour or the smoke outside the window that did it?”
The staff were digging into their meal when Steve walked into the kitchens. Their conversation immediately stopped and Herr Hammer jumped to attention, clearing his throat loudly.
"Pull the other one. Himmler himself doesn't have a piece this slick." Bucky said, pulling the headset off of Steve's head without so much as asking and placed the speaker to his ear. His eyes went round and remembering the voice speaking in English Steve tensed.
As she sat, a magazine slipped out from under her arm and onto the floor. Tony managed to catch a glimpse of the title, La Femme, and the picture of a poised woman on the cover before she snatched it back up with a distinctive curse under her breath.
“Because there’s a pretty little thing at the bar looking for a good time and you’re still sitting here putting up with me. What’s the matter Buck, can’t get up for it? Cause if that’s the case I’m always willing to assist.”
, which look like little worms.” Tony wiggled his fingers in the girls face and she giggled, ducking behind her sister. “The females drop their eggs close to where the ants build their nests. Who remembers why?”
The abbot paid no attention to him, entering his bedroom in a swirl of dark robes and ushering Tony inside. He crossed the stone floor without lingering and opened a drawered in the wardrobe in the corner.  Tony followed, peering over his shoulder curiously as Farkas sorted through a pile of boring folded clothing, but his mouth fell open in surprise when the abbot withdrew a pair of brilliant scarlet robes, unmistakably the dress of a cardinal.
With their driver taking the country roads at top speed they’d managed to make good time, arriving in the crush of state cars and gleaming automobiles that were trickling through the gates of the magnificent lodge.
Tony stared, flabbergasted in a way that he was neither used to nor particularly fond of. They were so maddening! If Tony hadn’t witnessed it with his own eyes, he’d never believe that Bucky hadn’t tried to kill Steve that very morning. Now he just walked back in and they shook hands as if nothing had ever happened?
“He was a bright little thing. Hugh had high hopes he’d grow into the business but we had a lot of trouble with discipline, didn’t we?”
His tone had gone placating and quiet as if he expected Steve or one of the others to punch him or worse.
“I’ll think on it, Tony.” Steve replied and Tony squeezed his arm once more before pulling away, to get the next vendors attention. Mindful this time, Steve stood back a little to give him space, but not so far that he couldn’t get there quickly if he saw something.
That...made no sense. The parades had been pageantry at best. Only one tank had crossed the streets and that had been in town. There were plenty of other routes, less convenient but still available.
They had to get someone close to him, that voice whispered again in the back of his mind, his heart twisting painfully in his chest in realization.
It was a surprise to Tony that she’d ever been married in the first place. There was a sadness in Janneke’s dark eyes despite the bravery in the bright smile she maintained that told Tony what the outcome of her ‘marriage counseling’ had been.
Tony had watched the lone soldier out of the corner of his eye for any sign of movement while trying to figure out the best escape route if it came down to making a run for it. It was hard to figure out over the pounding of his heart whether he feared more for himself or for Bruce, who had gone to face the emissaries from the camp head on.  Despite knowing that the Nazis could not afford the risk of harming Bruce before he could give his report to the Vatican, Tony wasn't certain that it would be enough to protect his friend if the S.S. were to decide that they’d rather act first and worry about consequences later. The Nazis had dared worse before. What was the hasty execution of one man?
“Children, get ready for dinner,” Tony instructed them firmly, sparing them a brief nod. Dinner wasn't for another two hours but no one argued.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about,” Steve grunted, tensing up once more at the bold statement. They had no proof to send him to a sanitorium. He’d not messed up that badly. Had he? Steve eyed the captain and khalmmer stared back confidently.
"Your father is right." Tony said, over the children's protests, and the table fell quiet once more. Steve blinked at him, surprised to find Tony of all people in his corner.
And as kind hearted as ever, Tony thought with a wistful pang, and as Péter launched into a story about a toy he’d made for Artur, only to give it away.
First was Péter, the oldest judging by height: a tall skinny brunette wearing spectacles. Then came Natacha: too pretty for her own good, too old in her eyes. Ian: stiff spine, serious mouth, eerily reminiscent of his father despite the lack of obvious resemblance. James: clearly trouble. Artur: could have been his father’s twin aged down, but fidgety and desperately curious about the stranger in their midst. Maria: sweet, shy, a dark haired beauty, too reminiscent of home.
“The last time we were on a train I was ten. We were with our Baka.” Péter said unexpectedly and Tony blinked at him, wondering at the sadness that had crept into the boy’s voice. Péter was looking at Ian though, who had lifted his head up just enough to give away the close attention he was paying to the conversation.
Nik, damn his hide, was of course correct. If Obadiah had played a hand in his father’s death as Nik seemed to be implying then the only thing that had saved Tony was his escape to St. Péter’s. As far as he knew Obadiah had never made any attempt to get at him there but now that Nik had raised the suspicions in his mind Tony could not forget how he and Yinsen been chased by armed officers all the way to Salzberg. When they had finally caught up with them Yinsen had told Tony to run for the Abbey, and not to turn back no matter what he heard. But Tony had never been good at doing what he was told and he had seen and heard plenty from his hiding place in the woods. They had called Jacob a filthy Jew and beat him bloody, all the while demanding to know where he was hiding Tony.
“Mio Dio.” Tony barely recognized the strangled voice in his ears as his own. His knees felt like jelly and he took a staggering step forward, bracing himself on the rail at the foot of the bed.
“They hide in the ant nest, pretending to be one of them so that the ants will feed them; but it’s very dangerous because if they don’t do all the right things, then the ants know that they’ve been tricked, and then they eat the caterpillars.”
“No Captain, bodily they’re fine.” Tony amended, wishing to maintain the sense of gravity but not wishing to draw out the man’s worry that something terrible had befallen one of the children.
"I don't like the fact that this plan endangers innocents. The Brothers, and your friend Bruce…” Stefen’s eyes met his gravely. “Tony, if anything went wrong they'd be killed just as readily as Bucky and any of the resistance."
“I think you outta shut up.” Bucky groaned, but couldn't help the smile tugging at his mouth. He outta sock the man in the mouth for torturing him like this but love made him stupid. Clearly.
Natacha might have saved them all, pinching his arm the way she did and gesturing franticly in another direction, mouthing for him to come on. Tony wasn’t surprised to see for himself that Natacha knew every hallway and corridor of the villa by heart, but it was still startling somehow to watch her scurry and dip through the narrow hallways designated for servant use with such practiced ease.
“And you should always slurp your soup! Father loves that,” Artur helpfully (and far less artfully than his sister) chimed in, and on his back James tried to convince Tony that the Captain appreciated his employees telling him to mind his own business. Natacha rolled her eyes ceiling ward and Tony laughed.
The goats in the yard bleated loudly as he walked to the front door, no doubt alerting the people inside to his approach. Ian had barely finished knocking before there was a rustle of falling snow, and a voice called down from up above.
“Things are changing Péter,” Harry warned with a dire tone as he lit the cigarette between his teeth. “This is not the time for the captain to hang on to petty grudges.”
“You’re a good man, and now you feel obligated to protect me. But I don’t want that. I never wanted that – yes, alright, maybe at first that was my intent, damn it. But things have changed! I won’t endanger you or your children anymore because you feel a duty. You’ll get hurt. You’ll all get-” Tony’s voice broke and a sob tore out of his mouth, pulled from deep within his chest. His hands darted out to catch Steve’s shirt as he swayed, holding on, holding himself up, holding tight even as he twisted his upper body away from him. Wrong. It was all wrong.
Cold fear began to creep through Steve’s chest as the words sank in, his hands tightening into fists at his sides. He tried to deflect, though he didn’t think it would do much good.
She had always liked working with her hands. She could still recall the way her mother's hands used to feel. Soft. So different from her baka, whose hands had been worn and leathery, but similarly strong and clever. Her mother's hands had rarely been idle. Even after the war they'd stayed busy. Natacha had long suspected that her volunteer work as a secretary at the War Office involved more than just typing.
“I wouldn’t change it.” Stefen growled defensively, arms tightening around Tony as if Tony had suggested they take it back.
This at least explained why Nik was watching the Captain so closely. Rogers was a powerful man with many connections. He could be a powerful ally.
"Steve asked me to make sure you make it back, and that’s what I’m gonna do. Understand? Now quit stalling. Tell me the plan." he demanded and Tony sighed, expression stating that he rested his case.
. No singing in public. Dr. Erskine’s fishy diagnosis. Samuel and the staff were family. Sam was gone: shipped to safety. Lukas Deurr had been arrested in Munich and had left behind a wife and daughter and Stefen cared enough not to wish him executed.
“Gone to visit her sister I hear,” a slurred voice answered from behind Tony and he grit his teeth in irritation. Hammer was standing in the serving doorway between the dining room and the kitchen hallway, a bottle of the house larger sloshing loudly as he raised it to his lips with a sneer.
Tony reached without thinking, yanking James and Ian down with him and covering them with his body as the cabin filled with screams around him. Something struck Tont against the shoulder and rolled down his back but he didn’t dare lift his head to see what it was. His heart was slamming so loudly in his ear drums, the wailing cry of the nameless child fighting for supremacy, that it took a long moment for Tony to realize when the gunfire had stopped and to recognize the sound of the aircraft engine was receding.
Bucky went still, the sudden silence in the hall as deafening as the roaring it had replaced in his ears.
Stefen looked to Péter first and then Ian almost unable to bear to do it, but he’d hurt them too much already by not being strong enough to do the things he should do. The least he could do was not hide from an apology. Péter didn’t say anything but Ian crawled out from under his covers to kneel in front of Steve on the bed like a child preparing to say his prayers.
It wasn’t her fault that when he pictured his family it included a fast-talking eccentric monk and not her fair face.
“I’ll go,” Péter volunteered once he and Tony had compiled a complete list and Tony frowned shaking his head in firm denial. The trek down the mountain to the nearest farm would be dangerous, and no telling what sort of trouble he’d meet when he got there.
“So that’s it huh? That’s why you’ve been so different lately.” Bucky laughed and it was an ugly sound. “You’re still just going to throw away your life and force us to watch? Jesus Christ Stefen you’re a selfish bastard.”
Maria gasped and Natacha glowered and leaned over to whisper in James’ ear. What the devil was going on at his table?
Becker had enough presence of mind to keep the men moving, barking orders until all of their gear had been unloaded from the truck and the men were in formation. Steve tugged the bill of his cap down further over his face and snapped the shoulder strap of his weapon over his shoulder. It had the desired effect of keeping the officer on sentry in his line of sight. If anything had gone wrong with the plan they’d have to be ready to defend themselves, but they must give the appearance that they expected no trouble.
Natacha nodded wordlessly, and Tony could not tell by her expression whether it was a simple truth or the baldest of lies. No matter. Werner blinked slowly and the moment passed, her expression chilly once more as her gaze turned to the only unfamiliar face in the lineup.
But besides sending word down the network, there was nothing he could do. It was well and truly out of his hands. Steve balled up the comforter between his fists and forced himself to keep his breathes even.
Their leader made a speech to his followers, of which the following quotations are of interest: “Always remember that no human beings are here, only swine.”—“Whoever does not wish to see blood may go home immediately.”—“No one who does harm to a prisoner need fear reprimand.”—“The more you shoot, the fewer we must feed.” – First Report of Dachau Concentration Camp, THE NEW REPUBLIC STAFF August 7, 1934
Steve tried to stand and bumped his thigh against his desk sending a jolt of white hot pain through his injured leg. He collapsed back into his chair with a stifled grunt.
There was a metaphorical release of breath when the officer, apparently placated by the word trickling down from command, nodded apologetically to Becker and wished God to be with them in their efforts to protect the Führer.
Except Stefen’s hands were on his shoulders and then there was pressure on his chest and he was being pushed away. And then it was Stefen standing between him and Bucky, staring the other man down with an expression made of stone.
"The whole city smells like smoke." Bucky grunted in answer and Natacha flinched. Bucky swiveled his hand to grasp her wrist, gentle but firm.
"Stevie he’s too dangerous to keep around and you know I’m right.” Bucky tried once more, lighting up his second cigarette. “I've never seen you throw away logic like you do when it comes to him.”
Steve shifted, SS Captain Khalmmer’s hand sliding off his shoulder for the second time in minutes. The captain had been glued to Steve’s side all evening. Khalmmer was a tall man with light hair a shade too dark to truly be called blond, who exuded the easy sort of charm that the Führer liked to cultivate in his followers, pleasant company if Charlotte’s gay smiles and easy laughter was anything to go by. He had a surprisingly gentle touch for a soldier, but his presence was unwanted all the same. Steve was in the last place he wanted to be, surrounded by the most dangerous people in the world.
“I’m not sure.” She sniffed. “But it was a good thing Bobby and Johann were there to... keep things in order. Who knows what could have happened. The children could have been hurt.”
Natacha was still fuming from her team’s loss. Steve could tell, though she kept her expression neutral enough as she insisted to the girls cloistered around her that she had purposefully allowed her brother to win because it was his birthday.
“Alright, we’ll meet you downstairs,” Péter said, before trotting off toward the last place they’d seen Artur. For a brief moment Ian wanted to call him back, but he straightened his spine and told himself just to get on with it. It was Christmas after all. A good time to give up a grudge. And maybe if he did, it would be good enough to make uncle Bucky come back.
None of it made sense. Stefen Rogers, a homosexual? No. Surely not! Stark she’d had pegged for that sort right away. The man didn’t do much to hide his eccentricities and Charlotte was a patron of the arts. She wasn’t naive. Some men were that way. In a strange way, perhaps it even helped them to be better artists – art after all, was an expression of pain and what more painful existence than the life of a homosexual?
When he rounded the corner into the sitting room Natacha saw him first, she stood up from where she was sitting next to Bucky on the couch her eyes going bright and soft as a barely contained grin split her face as she greeted him.
Tony sighed. He didn't have the heart to explain that his textbook took up twice the space of any stuffed toy or box of building blocks.
“May I see?” Steve gestured to the kit hopefully. He could fix that, if Tony would let him. These were wounds he could dress. Something he knew well how to do.
Bucky lunged and Steve didn’t even flinch. He’d long since stopped fighting back. He just lay there, ready to let Bucky bury him and that was worse than anything else he might have said or done.
"Wanda?" He whispered, and the girl’s shoulders tensed. Her whole body went so still Péter thought she might have stopped breathing. "Is that really your name?"
, the one who would just walk along behind him cleaning things up and taking care where he refused to take it and saying, yes Captain, he had another think coming!
“Natacha!” the boys clamored from behind them, demanding to know where she’d been, and why she’d left, their voices all pounding at his head like hammers.
Ian wasn't sure what had set him off this morning. Tony had only told him once more that he had to get ready for the parade.
“All the more reason to do it.” Tony pointed out as he finished stepping into his pants. “The German’s want Austrians to think nothing has changed, that maybe things are even better. Well your children are very proud of their heritage and would never dream of missing such a celebrated Viennese tradition.”
Jann was ferrying information back and forth between headquarters and their informant in the office of the Wehrmacht.  She was overdue by a couple of days, and they were all beginning to worry.
“I need cover!” Bucky shouted before taking off, trusting Harrison and the girl to cover his back as he ran after the departing vehicle.
Péter had papers for travel and money. They could come up with a story for Cameron and Daniel, or simply claim theirs to be lost. People were more likely to accept a bribe from a good German boy with the right kind of papers than not.
Glancing at Artur Tony caught the boys eye and nodded towards the door, a silent instruction for him to follow after his sister and Artur nodded, carefully putting Mon Amie’s cage back on his dresser before stepping over James and darting out the door.
“Of course you want me to spy on him,” Tony said, rolling his eyes heavenward. “What happened to keeping my head down?”
“I’ll definitely need that antenna, but I’ll get it working Captain.” Tony promised. He couldn’t say that he wasn’t afraid. There was a part of him that very much was. But if Stefen was working directly with British intelligence something very big must be going on. He must feel they had a genuine chance of avoiding war and for that Tony was glad to take the risk.
“He’s really going to play!” Tony heard Ian gasp and a moment later, as if drawn like moths to a flame, the rest of the Rogers children had emerged from the crowd to collect around their father and their uncle. James handed Bucky his violin and Bucky winked at him, his smile just as big and bright with anticipation as the little boys.
“Why would you be scared of us? If you are a good German girl then of course you have nothing to fear” the man said, and Maria shrank back into her chair. “You are good German children, aren’t you?”
Not that any of that made Tony safe. With a single phone call Stanislov could have both Italian and German Authorities descending upon the city in a horde, and they both knew it. But Tony had one golden card to play.
“Sir.” Steve greeted him, not advancing out of respect. They were comrades, but Philips was a friend first. Phillips had fought his battles and served his time. Steve would never presume to place him in any more danger than he volunteered for.
Perhaps to be encouraging Tony had asked the children to each write a letter to their father detailing their day when he’d sent his last correspondence, hoping it would prevail upon Stefen if not to come home where he was sorely missed, then to at least open the lines of communication between him and the children.
Something passed between father and Tony, their eyes speaking without words as they so often did. It was yet another look Ian couldn't decipher, though he always tried his hardest. Then father was nodding and handing Sara down into Natacha’s arms.
Silence descended again for a few painful breaths, and just when Deiter had decided to reach and snap the radio on one of the little girls began to sing. It was the dark one with the large doe eyes. The one who never talked.
The little boy sighed heavily, his mouth turning in a deeply contemplative frown, as if he were considering matters of unimaginable importance.
He’d not hoped for too much, but he’d never expected this short dismissive little letter begging him to play nice with Nazis. It felt like a blow, though he felt silly for even acknowledging the strange feeling of disappointment in his chest.
Rogers jerked as if slapped and looked over his shoulder, the movement slow and careful, as if his skeleton was made of glass. His pale lips twisted into grimace at the sight of Dvorak and Fischer standing in the doorway, eyes that were sunk in purple bruises narrowing first on Dvorak and then his companion. With a groan, Rogers pushed himself up until he was leaning against the headboard. The muscles in his arms shook with the effort it took to lift himself. Poor bastard, Dvorak thought with a twinge of sympathy.
He grit his teeth, trying not to let the thought bother him. He was so tired of trying to figure out what to do in order to make his father happy. He said he wanted them to study and take advantage of their education but hated it that Péter was ‘too smart’. He said he loved them but Tony always had to bug him to spend time with them. He hated the Nazis and the things they stood for and yet he wore their uniform and one day soon they were’ going to call him and he’d go and fight for them.
Ian had started eating again and practiced his letters with Mama diligently every day, content with the unspoken promise in his hands. He’d still miss him, but Da always kept his word. He would be back, and when he was Ian would be ready to read to him. From then on, whenever Da left with the troops he’d send Ian a new book. Ian thought he’d forgotten the tradition after mama died.
Steve would have applauded her for the choice if it didn’t frustrate his desire to keep his children far away from his enemies. As person after person approached the family, Steve steered them around the room and away from the likes of Schmidt, Striker and Göring. An impossible task one might say and yet he attempted it.  There was no avoiding their host no matter what he did, and the Führer had been delighted to speak to them. He’d even presented Steve and Charlotte with an engagement gift in front of everyone to show his favor, even though they’d yet to officially announce it.
Peter looked up at Tony from where he had his hands clenched in his lap. They were clammy he noticed belatedly and grimaced, wiping them on the leg of his pants.
Bruce’s mouth tightened. It was far from the first time Tony had challenged his belief or asked after his reasons for committing himself to the life of a monk. He was a scientist for Christ’s sake!
“There always has to be such pomp and parade for celebrities. I’m sure a physician of your caliber has more important things to do.” Dvorak prompted.
With the Prince’s departure looming the much anticipated trip to the park finally occurred near the end of that week. Stefen, Tony, and the children set out early (outfitted in their brand new play clothes) and in good spirits. They took a carriage to the station instead of a cab because Maria wanted to see the horses again. During the ride Tony taught them an old song about a man and the mule who had pulled his cart and they’d gleefully sung it the rest of the way.
His mother’s voice drifted out to him where he stood, low and sweet, and he shifted his eyes to the windows just to the right of the oak doors. Behind shifting gauzy drapes, he could see her sat at the piano in the front parlor. She’d had it moved there so he could always see her while he played in the garden. If he picked her a bouquet of flowers and ran up to the window, she’d accept them with a smile and say,
.”  As Stefen spoke Tony’s eyes flew back to the beautiful woman in the picture he held. His mother. Sara’s namesake. Not old by anyone’s standards but weathered by years of hardship and labor. And yet the kindness in her eyes defied it all.
Truth was it didn’t make much sense and he knew that. He just didn’t know what it meant that he was alright with Tony doing what he himself found unfathomable.
"Not going after your brother is a mistake I'll live with for the rest of my life. I won’t make it twice." He said, voice too soft for such a raw admission and she shuddered. Péter was her fault, they both knew that. She'd had no right to use him like a weapon.
Was there time to get someone else? He needed someone he could trust, someone who would take the nature of his situation seriously. Not some silly, prattling, not to mention stubborn, fool who was likely to insist the sky was green just to be contrary. Schmidt would laugh himself sick before the ink dried on the children’s registration papers.
They’d eaten together at the breakfast nook, or rather Tony had guzzled coffee while Stefen mostly read the letters Péter had written from school, while accepting bites of Tony’s food. When the captain had finally read and reread all of them he’d tucked them away in his trunks and asked how Tony had decided they should spend their free day.
“Captain Rogers. How good to see you again.” Frauline Van Dyne greeted him fondly, presenting her hand and Stefen kissed it clinically but there was a certain fondness in his expression as he greeted her and turned to introduce his party.
“Is that so hard for you? It’s all that I ask.” Stefen snapped and Tony immediately snapped back, his temper fraying in the face of Stefen’s continued coldness.
“It’s in the math Pete. The fission of one atom of uranium two-thirty-five would generate how much energy?”
Patrols were everywhere. Traveling even with the right paperwork was dangerous. It was all ‘who are you and where are you going’ and the Stark name was too well known not to garner attention. Maybe he could feel a bit of sympathy for Rogers after all. He wasn’t the only symbol the Nazis would be interested in using for their own purposes.
Steve’s shoulders sagged with relief, and he was glad Tony couldn’t see his face. He was ruining this. He didn’t want to ruin it.
She squeezed his arm in a friendly fashion, leaving him with a wink to turn her attention to a well-dressed couple who had come to say their farewells and congratulate her on a wonderful evening. Tony stood frozen where she left him, her words reverberating through his head like a gun shot.
Smiling to himself Tony flipped the dial on the radio, static fuzzing in and out until he found a new channel, still relishing the fact that he could. Radio’s had been banned at the abbey as Niklas had felt the brothers stood a better chance of staying out of German prison camps if they were left somewhat ignorant to the outside world (and of his own political activities no doubt). But of course none of them were stupid men, and news reached the abbey through the mouths of strangers and visitors passing through or the occasionally smuggled newspaper.
Hammer closed his mouth with a snap, grimacing with distaste at the mention of the gardener and Tony scowled, bracing himself for the usual drivel people spouted about the supposed inferiority of people like Sam (people like him).
’, but the people resisted Nazi extremism. In the Italian fashion, with a wink and a smile as they carried on with life. The Italian spirit was more on display now than it had ever been, or perhaps would be again.
“I mean somewhere else. I need-” Steve grimaced in frustration. He wasn't cut out to be a spy, had never been trained in this sort of warfare. He felt as obvious as an elephant in the parlor. To add to his embarrassment he could feel his cheeks starting to burn, as if he were a child caught in a lie. His gaze drifted to Kurt who had gone back to his position up from but was clearly still watching them.
“He’s all right. He just had too much to drink last night. It can make your head hurt. Right, Buck?” Stefen explained to them cheerfully. And loudly. The stupid fuck, Bucky thought fondly as he continued to hide his face, slowly and carefully nodding his head in agreement.
Tony patted his arm and they did not linger any longer in the cold. They entered the door into the living room, greeted by calls of welcome. The air was thick with the scent of spices and fried dough, and the room filled with unfamiliar faces. They spilled from the kitchen into the living room, the extra table that had been set up there, groaning with food. Their family was blessed to have more than others, and so they celebrated with a few of those who had less.
Mother had warned her and Péter. They’d been cuddled together on their parent's bed, upset that their grandmother was too ill to see them. Péter had questioned why, when mother always said that medicine was good for them, and their mother had answered that medicine would make you sick when you weren't sick but was good for you when you were.
Tony merely glanced into the nursery where the little girls still slept. It was distressingly free of children. If the ring leaders were gone then there was barely any point in looking for the others in their rooms, Tony was thinking to himself as he turned his thoughts toward the outside and searching the house grounds.
When the door had clicked shut behind him Tony sighed and sank down onto the floor beside James, sure that it was going to be a minute or two before he was ready to get up. For a time the two just sat in silence, Tony stroking the boy’s damp hair back from his eyes as James’ sobs quieted to wet sniffles. Tony wasn’t sure how much time had passed when James rolled closer to Tony’s side so that his head was resting against the older man’s thigh and finally looked up at him with watery blue eyes. He didn’t say anything, but Tony could see the misery writ there and hear his unspoken question.
“Ah, Antony, good.” Brother Filip smiled blandly as he sipped from his cup of coffee. He set the cup down gently on the saucer her held in his hand and said almost cheerfully, “We were waiting for you.”
The dark wish that the roof would come down on them before the party passed through Natacha’s mind and her chest ached tight. It would be better for Maria to die here in the house their father had belt for their mother, surrounded by loved ones, than to face what lay ahead for all of them.
something. Something other than surviving Steve supposed. He’d snapped something churlish and harsh when Steve finally had enough and demanded he stay put. The fight that followed was loud and heated, like it always was between them, only this time it was different too. Harsher. More teeth. Distance between them that left Steve feeling cold and urgent in a way there was no recourse for but to keep shouting and pushing himself into Tony’s space.
But Tony thought about it the rest of the afternoon. He was still thinking about it as he gathered up sheet music from the music room. Stefen did work entirely too much. It was better now that he was making such an obvious point to spend more time with the children but the kids couldn’t be his only resource for relaxation.
“Yes but to arm children-” Steve began but Olasz cut him off, with a wave of his hand, disgust playing across his face.
Three hours later Major Rogers stomped through the door. He went straight away to his desk, barley stopping to acknowledge Dvořák all together. Christ. Rogers was in a foul mood. Dvořák was tempted to call attention to his rude behavior. Perhaps he thought that meant he no longer had to pay the proper respect, they may both be the same rank now but Dvořák still had seniority.
But there were only burlap wrappings for their hands and their fingers weren’t the only bits and pieces of their bodies left vulnerable to the winter elements. And always, just as pressing as the fear of frostbite, was the fear that sound echoed. While the sound of a falling tree wasn't unusual in a mountain wood there was always the chance of it drawing unwanted attention.
Tony took a seat at an empty table, near the boy and his grandmother and signaled for the host when he’d settled to order a coffee. He was content at first to open one of the books he’d brought for just this sort of lull in activity, but he found it difficult to keep his attention on the pages. His thoughts strayed often back to the Villa, wondering on the children and how Pepper was faring with them. Wondering on Peter and how the first few weeks of term were going, and of course, there was the counting down of minutes he couldn’t seem to deter. His agile mind keeping track of the passing of minutes like the most steadfast of clocks, all of it winding down to when the train would reach the station in Berlin and he would find Stefen waiting for him there.
“Major.” Steve cut in angrily. “That is my rank, kindly use it. I don’t see how It’s any of the Reichjugendfuhrer’s business what I decide is best for my son. Or any of my children.”
“In the front hall. The Captain is trying to hold them off but they’re determined. The twins are in the music room with the girls. We must get them out.”
Steve looked away. He didn't like leaving the letter around where anyone could find it but he did not wish to be unfair to the children either. He had only just returned after all.
Despite himself Bucky found himself smiling along with Charlotte who chuckled gaily as the children fumbled their way through the performance. Steve was quieter but he was beaming as he watched the puppets dance and listened to the beautiful sound the children were making with their voices. He had a talented bunch, that was for sure. That look of barely contained amazement he couldn’t quite wipe off his face was well earned. Even though Bucky knew part of it was for Stark – for the way that he had of bringing everything alive, and pulling out the best from the kids – Bucky couldn’t resent it. He wished Steve could have more moments like this, moments that made him light up.
“You really ought to get better locks,” Tony exclaimed in a rush, already dropping Maria into the backseat of the car. He didn’t know how he’d done it, or how it was possible, but in that moment a breathless laugh punched out of Steve’s chest. He was next to Tony a moment later, to help him load the other children – ignoring the furious protests of the driver.
He'd warned him plenty however, about how he likely wouldn't even make it past training camp and how the other men would wipe the floor with him.
“Alright but go straight home this evening. I don’t want you on the street after dark.” Tony didn’t say anything about what their father’s reaction would be should they not be safe indoors before the lights came on, but neither boy really needed him to. Neither did Péter, who strolled out a few minutes later. Tony waited by the door after he had gone for Natacha to appear for another twenty minutes. When there was still no sign of her, he began to worry. He debated on going inside to look, concerned that she might be on her way out right that moment.  He could easily miss her in the large hotel.
A new scar forming over his freshly shaven jaw.. A permanent mark. If he’d had the strength, Steve would have frowned. He’d liked Tony's face the way it had been… but then Tony smiled and Steve supposed he liked his face this way too.
He met up with Scott at the inn in Ingolstadt, a public enough place not to cause undue suspicion. Steve spotted Scotts dark head at the bar almost immediately, eyebrows raising at the sight of the crooked fedora he wore. He didn't approach him on the off chance that Schmidt had set someone to watch his movements at the Berghof.
He lay the book in Stefen’s hands and the captain paused, staring at it with an unreadable expression before he took a breath and lifted the cover. Tony and Bucky wasted no time moving in close to read over his shoulder.
It shouldn’t have caught Steve by surprise but it did a little. Schmidt was nothing if not an excellent chess player.
They’d touted Rogers and his family out to every parade and festival for months, Dvorak couldn’t go anywhere without hearing where ‘The Lion of Austria’ and his little cubs had been – which only made their sudden disappearance from public all the more noticeable. People were talking, and that was dangerous. Odd behaviors that had escaped scrutiny once before were now being brought back and examined in the light.
He would never. He couldn’t do that to Charlotte, was abhorred by the very idea of it. The feeling of sickness churning in his gut was shadowed by the image of Tony in his mind. God, Stefen would lose him, he was sure of it, and he wouldn’t blame Tony for getting as far away from all this, from
The laugh broke free and he slumped back to the ground, his face smearing in the mud and straw that covered the floor of the pen. A goat pen, Steve realized with a burst of fresh mirth, giggling like a lunatic. Not sleeping next to his wife, but a damn goat. He had a vague memory of passing out in the snow outside of a fence and waking up, desperate for food and warmth.
He caught himself puzzling over the contradictions that the captain presented and snorted derisively at himself. So the man wasn’t big on reading. It was hardly indicative of good character. If the penmanship in his letters was anything to go by reading and writing had come to Rogers late in life and probably reluctantly at that. Nothing more to it.
And there was the baroness now, weaving through the crowd to reach him, unhurried and outwardly unworried but for a small crease that spoke of concern on her forehead. Still, he couldn’t say way, but it didn't feel right.
They did not always see eye to eye he and Hammer, but Steve tried to keep in mind that the world wasn’t split between people you enjoyed and bad people.
“Say no more Captain,” Susann said, taking pity on him. She seemed to remember her customer then because she hastily steered them over to a section filled with children’s sized clothing and saying, “Just let me finish up with Frau Neumann and I’ll be right over to help with measurements.”
Steve pushed himself up onto his feet, his muscles tightening in agonizing protest that drove a gasp past his lips. Strangely he floated above the pain, stumbling on leaden feet fully into the room. They had to be here; his brain kept insisting in a disconnected way. Rejecting reality, the way a drowning body might. He could feel the water creeping up over his neck, filling his mouth, burning in his lungs, and yet his mind clung to thought that he couldn’t die. Not this way. Tony and the children couldn’t be gone. Not for good.
"Please. I just need to know if - " he began, but Coulson's eyes narrowed on him and is voice was hard and brooked no room for argument as he spoke over him.
"It gets worse," Stefen grunted. "We've been invited to join Schmidt for a party at the Berghof the following week. Schmidt has many stops planned along the route."
“We don’t know that for sure.” Stefen insisted, but Tony could see it on his face. He’d already thought the same thing. Hammer’s name hovered on the edge of Tony’s tongue but he hesitated. What proof did he have, besides a bad feeling? Hammer might be an oily weasel but he’d been with the Rogers family for a lot longer than Tony had.
Tony spent a very cold (very undignified) couple of hours with the sheep. The familiar monk's habit was thick, but no match for the winter chill even so. Despite the discomfort, he was thankful that the bitter weather provided him a ready excuse for keeping his hood up and his body hunched over when a soldier stepped out of the barn for a smoke. Even from a distance he could feel the man's eyes on him, and he did his best to keep his face shielded but not look like he was hiding. Thankfully the soldier with the cigarette didn't prove curious enough to trek through the snow to question the miserable little man who'd obviously gotten the unluckiest task on the abbey chore list.
almost made him look like a stranger but the lazy smirk and the indolent wave he tossed Péter’s way when he turned and noticed him was all Harry. Péter’s face broke into a grin as he ran to meet his friend. Harry’s grin was equally big as they hugged, wrestling for a moment as they tried to mess up the others hair.
“Péter…” His name cracked from Tony’s throat and Péter was suddenly, undeniably afraid.  “It’s enough.”
Either way the people did not look. They hurried by, eyes downcast, like mice scurrying back into their holes.
“Morning starts after the stroke of midnight.” Steve returned the expected pass phrase as Lt. Becker gestured for the men to fall out of line. Three of them formed an assembly line. Steve jumped back into the van and handed out the gear that would have raised the policeman’s suspicions, as it was unmistakably more fit for full assault than it was a reinforcement of guards.
There was so much he wanted to say. Needed to say, Tony thought as he took a deep shaky breath in and let it out slowly.
"The Kindertransport!" Deiter realized with sudden certainty. He pointed franticly toward the train, which was still blowing, moments away from exiting the station. "Herr Captain, the train!"
Death smelled like leaves fallen from their branches, rotting upon the soil; and it smelled like unwashed bodies congesting the square, as displaced people from the regions of Bohemia and Moravia, sought refuge from German occupation on Italian shores.
Looking up to face the music he found that indeed Stefen had made his way down to the bank. He was standing there next to Ian with arms crossed imposingly, but to Tony’s surprise he didn’t seem all that concerned with Tony and James.
Tony finished wiping Maria's arm off and looked over his miserable little crew. It was time to fix this.
He paused for a moment, eyes catching on one painting in particular. The painting was of a trader ship in port, and it was the hull of said ship that held his interest. Yes. Yes, that was a Stark ship alright. The black and bold design of it was unmistakably Hughard’s craftsmanship. She was being held in port, sailors in still motion on her deck and docks, her sails raised catching the wind but unable to move. The artist had depicted her moments away from disaster. Tony could practically hear the groaning of the wood, the panicked shouts and lap of water clawing at her stern. For all that it was a quiet painting there was an underscore of painful aggression. Of chaos barely contained.
“You feel, alright don’t you? You didn’t eat something bad?!” James asked again, his gaze swiveling from his da to Bucky and back again in increasing concern. Stark had explained to the younger ones as best he could that their da had eaten something that disagreed with him and gotten very sick, in the hopes that the fear of germs or his having a relapse wouldn’t hang over their heads, but it had created other worries. James refused to eat now until someone assured him the food was good.
One glance down at the rifle sitting between them on the bed told Tony all that he needed to know and his frown intensified. Péter saw where Tony’s eyes had gone and for a split second, he looked guilty, before he set his jaw and picked up the rifle, meeting Tony’s gaze as he whispered, “there’s only two of them and they aren’t armed. I figured I could take them if they broke through the door, while the others escaped out the window.”
Steve’s eyes burned with unshed tears, a horrible itching sensation trickling down his throat like acid.
So that was the way it was to be, the whole family on parade.  Stefen had to be livid, but Tony couldn’t be anything but relieved. He’d see Stefen soon and the children would be reunited with their father.
Steve stood staring at the big clock in the center of the station, watching the minutes tick down toward ten in the evening. The arrival of the orient line was delayed by an hour. He’d stopped agonizing on why that could be, pushing everything but the cold hard facts of the matter away. Tony would come or he wouldn’t.
It was becoming clear what he must do. Steve would never like it, but he didn’t have to.  He must offer Tony some way to engage his mind and his courage that wouldn’t put him in immediate danger, or he was going to lose him long before he was ready to.
There was a belief among many religions that fasting helped to bring one’s mind closer to God’s. Indeed, it was a distressingly popular notion that only by forgoing all distractions of the flesh was it possible for a man to reach enlightenment. Tony was willing to grant the idea a nod. After all, he used to forget meals entirely while tinkering away in his workshop at the abbey; but he’d emerged from the workshop at Bruce’s insistence often enough only for Farkas to turn around and declare a fast, that Tony hadn’t really bothered too hard to observe them in the past.
The little ones pealed with laughter as Tony danced about, singing and yodeling, shrieking with laughter as they avoided his feet. Tony sang about the folks in a remote town hearing the song of the goatherd and jumped off the bed with another yodel. He was gratified when James and Artur scrambled after him with jubilant whoops and did their best approximation of a yodel. He’d have to work on their form, but both of them definitely had fine lungs. Tony grabbed Sara and began to dance her about as he continued the game.
Stefen stared at him for a long moment, eyes searching Tony’s face carefully before he nodded shortly.
The girl went suddenly silent and limp as if someone had cut her strings and Tony blinked down at her in shock.
Bucky hadn’t gone to her. Hadn’t made sure she was safe. He’d gone with Stark instead. For Steve. Always for Steve.
The captain recovered first, rolling over onto his side and drawing Tony with him, cradling him close despite the cooling mess on their skin. It would be uncomfortable to clean latter but in that moment Tony couldn’t bring himself to care. He let Stefen wrap an arm around him and tuck him firmly against his side and they lay together, relearning how to breathe.
And yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming. It was like a breath on his neck. A silent warning of an approaching threat that he couldn't see, but he could feel with every raised hair on his body.
“There’s a man in a fancy suit meeting with the captain,” Willamina informed them almost as soon as they entered the kitchen. Tony’s heart began to pound as Harold went to offer the man a heat lamp and to see what more he could glean through friendly conversation.
“The sun is rising,” Stefen disputed not looking up from his work and Bucky glanced out over the lake taking in the pink and gold splash on the water and sighing.
“I don’t intend for my post to last very long. I never got into this thinking I was going to survive it Bucky, that was you.” Steve turned away from the wounded look in Bucky’s eyes because he didn’t think he could handle that particular look of betrayal on his face right now. He’d never lied to Bucky about the stakes or his intentions. Bucky was the one who’d fooled himself into believing this could end any other way but one.
Tony. The man’s face flashed through Stefen’s mind and his chest tightened with fear and longing. What would Tony do if Steve was arrested? Go back to the abbey he supposed… but it was such a waste. Somehow the thought of their vivacious little monk cloistered behind thick stone walls made him angry. Surely the Abbot wouldn’t allow him to chatter through breakfast, running commentary on all the mornings news. Silent meals seamed more in keeping with what monks got up to but Steve just couldn’t imagine Tony living that way. Didn’t want to. It upset him to think of Tony alone, with no one to listen to his ever-growing list of things that needed inventing: tubs that washed the clothing for you, soap that didn’t scald the hands, stoves you could carry with you, a way to harness nuclear energy and turn it into electricity, a way to keep ice that didn’t involve wielding a chisel. Tony was so full of life, full of heat and spark and smoke and flash. He just didn’t belong in a damn abbey!
Charlotte would very much like to know that for herself, but she wasn’t about to ask again. It mattered very little in the long run whether Stark liked her or not.
“Come on bambina. There you go, just...” An arm thwacked him and her head ducked underwater momentarily. When Tony lifted her up a quick moment later she spluttered and clutched at him, kicking her legs wildly.
"Stefen! If you're in trouble let me help you." She implored him, putting a hand on his elbow as if the gentle gesture would be enough to make him stop. She didn’t know father well enough to know there was little stopping him when he got like this. Few people could. Somehow, she hadn’t learned from earlier. She wasn’t one of them.
“Seven children!” Tony gaped. “His poor wife. What desperate state must she be in? No one thought to stage a rescue?”
How Tony Stark fell for the Rogers children (just the children mind you) and how they found a friend in an unexpected place.
“Perhaps he is just eccentric. And that, my dear, is dangerous. There are many men who are crying their devotion to the will of God even as they betray the Führer, His chosen leader. The Führer is forced to weed them out of the church, revealing them for the charlatans and traitors that they really are. It’s a terrible business.”
"We're all very tired. I think it would be better to rest some don't you?" Charlotte suggested, but even Sara who was little more than a baby knew it wasn't really a suggestion.
“I need you.” Stefen admitted baldly, the words soft as a whisper, but holding so much weight Tony’s knees felt like they might buckle in that moment. “Don’t go away.”
"How?" His voice cracked on the question and he had to swallow. "Father won't even agree to let me go to public school here in Salzburg. He isn't going to let me go to school in Switzerland Tony."
He didn’t know Agent Coulson, but he remembered Brother Filip, and what he remembered of the unflappable monk who’d ran the abbey alongside Farkas with a cool competent hand, led him to believe he was almost capable of accomplishing such a thing. He’d certainly never lie about it if he hadn’t.
“There was an uprising. A group of insurgents infiltrated the prison and tried to free some prisoners. There have been complaints from the village. A few public demonstrations, but nothing to be overly worried about.” He continued with a worried frown as if he were repeating a speech he’d made many times, which Steve had the sinking suspicion that he was. “They want better security. After the wreckage from the explosion people are afraid.”
City by city, they round up the caravans and take them away." Wanda answered hollowly and Péter nodded slowly, shame pooling low in his stomach.
It was not his first time on a train but such was the life of a monk that it had been some time since Tony had traveled first class on one. He was gratified that Stefen’s unnecessary efforts to woo him had continued in this area. He’d never been so thankful to see plush cushions on the seats and a pastry trolley making the rounds. It was not such a long journey between Austria and Germany but several hours in a thunderbox could be a test on the nerves when one was packed in like a sardine on a hard seat.
Natacha had explained in a low whisper as they'd gathered around her in the music room that night, Péter playing the piano to drown out the sound of their voices. Artur had shivered with fear, because they all knew what happened to bad Germans.
Another photo caught his eye. That of a woman he could only assume was the late Mrs. Rogers. She’d been a beauty that much was for sure. With her wide dark mouth, sharp eyes and dark waves of hair she could have passed for any silver screen siren. She reminded him a bit of his own mother. Alive, even in a picture.
“What’s this? My crusted roast won six times at the Spring festival!” she huffed and Ian bit back a laugh.
“The general has made himself clear. Bring proof and we’ll look into your claims. Until then don’t come back here.” The officer warned lowly. “You’re dismissed.”
He used to sing to him too. Little diddies remembered from boyhood. Songs in the language of his people and songs picked up in the language of the Croats, the Polish, the Germans, songs he hardly knew the meaning of but understood to be gifts when they’d been imparted with him.
People were really getting into the spirit of things now. They paired off quickly and the grounds were soon full of dancers. Tony reached for Sara and took her by both hands, dancing her in a circle until she was breathless with delighted giggles.
Péter approached her hesitantly, not wishing to startle her, but also eager to take the chance to speak with her in a rare moment when her twin was occupied and not glued to her side.
“Course he did.” Bucky replied with a grunt, making it sound like he thought Tony was stupid for asking. Maybe he was.
He lay there, his heart thundering, eyes squeezed closed until it finally sank in that he’d stopped moving and that he was alive. Tony would probably have yelled something about how he nearly fell off the side of a mountain but well, he hadn’t.
Perhaps just mercy Tony decided, his chest tightening with pity he knew better than to let Stefen see.
Steve lingered longer than he had any right to in the bath. The heated water felt like bliss as it sank into his skin to sooth his sore muscles. He eventually had to make himself abandon the tub and face the day. It was Christmas Eve and he was determined that it would be good for the children. He couldn’t promise them much else right now, but he could give them that. Steve dried off and dressed without any help for the first time in weeks, and then made it down stairs to the kitchen where Willamina had served up breakfast.
Charlotte's heart sank. She should have expected this. She did not want to burden the children more than they had to, but it was better in the long run not to give them false hope.
Knowing him, he’d probably want to call a halt to the whole trip and if Stefen thought Tony was going to let a minor incident like a child getting himself into a bit of hot water – it was
Steve jerked in surprise as the animal at her side bleated loudly, hoofing at the ground in irritation as if it intended to ram him with its horns.
“I don’t like this,” he ground out. Charlotte let out a breath and loaded her spoon again as calm as ever.
“Let me go and get James.” He suggested, coming to a decision and Péter smiled, nodding in understanding.
He’d held off, mindful of the duties he absolutely could not shirk at the prince’s arrival, but there was no point in distance now. He would send for Tony and the children and make good of what time he had left by spending every moment he could with them.
“Alright then come along, we’d better round up the others. It won’t do for all of us to sit around the house crying and wondering about the state of the others.”
"-And I wouldn't need it seeing as I have never needed it and am now employed by your master, so if you’ll kindly step aside!" Tony ground out, shoving the door aside with one last grunt. The butler paused at his words, hand curling on the door, crinkles of disgust forming at the corners of his eyes. For a moment Tony almost believed he would close the door and actually leave him outside in the dusk.
He didn't know where to look and feeling unbalanced he looked up at Stark once more, willing him wordlessly to take over.
“Ah Captain. At last. We may begin to address this troubling letter I received from Miss Van Dyne.” Waving toward the many open seats in the comfortably appointed room he beseeched them. “Please be seated. You are among friends here.”
He was irritated by her request. She could tell even though he continued to smile and babble at the children in a mix between German and Italian that they seemed to understand without trouble.
Steve had to get up. He twisted, swinging blindly at Schmidt, a cry torn from his lips as his vision swam double. It seemed to him that his moans bounced off the walls of his cell, taunting him with the emptiness of the space and the unsoundness of his own mind. He could not tell what was real and what was not. From the fire in his veins to the hands gripping at his throat, yanking at his hair, and the voice of his enemy snarling hotly in his ear.
The morning of his departure from St. Péter’s Abbey Tony packed a small bag full of what meager possessions he owned, said goodbye to Bruce in the infirmary (the only man at the monastery who came even close to being called a friend) and went to his workshop to close it up in that order. He’d dismantled what inventions he’d stored there for fear of them getting into other hands and being reverse engineered. Tony’d had more than twenty long years at the abbey and no ships to occupy him so he had let his curiosity take him anywhere and everywhere that feasibly gotten materials would allow, including weaponry. He did not trust his work not to eventually fall into Nazi hands and he wasn’t sure he trusted it in Father Niklas’ hands either. He was far too fond of his little war games.
The dream that had chased him out of bed so damn early still lingered in the back of his mind, casting a dark shadow on his mood. His sister Rachol, laughing in his face as she pushed him over and pulled him back up again in a circle of sisterly torment. She’d leaned over him, her pin straight black hair whirling like a nest of feathers around his head, like the bird of death, her mouth smiling wide.
Péter was just finishing opening the last of his presents, the gift table littered with boxes, ribbons and paper.  Though Péter was very grown up with his thank yous and his handshakes, Tony was having a great time watching his face for the boyish delight he couldn’t quite hide as he opened each one. He’d saved his father’s gift for the very last, and Tony had a front row seat for the shock on Péter ’s face when he opened the box to find an old Kodak inside.
Prince Thorson waved his attendants words aside like they were a bad smell and turned an impressively wide beaming smile on them.
The sled moved fast and it was harder to steer while on top of it than he’d anticipated. He sped down the side of the slope at breakneck speed, snow churning up behind him, his heart beating wildly in his chest. Ian let out a whoop as the wind whipped through his hair, stinging at his cheeks and eyes, picking up more and more speed the further he went.
Movement from the master bedroom pulled at his attention and he glanced up as Stefen slipped from the room, quietly shutting the bedroom door behind himself. He didn’t seem surprised to see Tony curled up on the couch, but then again there were few places he could be this early in the morning.
“Thank God!” Bucky’s smile turned into a wince as the cook kissed his cheeks, jostling his arm in her enthusiasm. “No one would tell us a thing! But the captain has been so worried -”
“Britain has an army, and a lot of allies. If they know what’s going on here, they could help. They could force the Führer to step down.” He finally said, with a decisive little nod. “It’s worth it. Even if the Germans hear.”
Steve clenched his teeth until they ached, forcing the visions back, and pushing down the swell of grief the memories had brought with them. Those boys were dead. They didn’t matter right now. Nothing mattered except saving what was left.  That was the mission, and he couldn’t do it alone.
“Happy Birthday, Tony,” Stefen whispered, breath tickling Tony’s ear and he sniffed back the tears that threatened to make a mess of him. He laughed again, the first genuinely joyous one he’d felt in a very long while.
At least at first. For Steve the liquor had not soothed, the sweet sting of bile sour in his mouth reminding him too much of his father. It felt like a defeat drinking his nights away in such a way and he’d found better solace in his artwork; and it had the added bonus of bringing in more coin to send home to his mother. He’d sketched the entire district at one point. He’d been awestruck by the staggering height of the churches, the access to paint, music and food at every turn. It was a kind of paradise in its own way, a land of freedom and plenty, and for the first time he had felt pride in all that he had done. He’d fought for this, all of it, and it had been good.
“Harold said he was in need of you.” Frau Hogan interrupted with another snap. “And while you are on your way, please alert the baroness of our guest. As I’m sure you were just about to do.”
Tony wasn’t stupid. Getting caught in the rain was one thing but it had been raining for some time since supper and if Péter had been outside all this time it had to be for a purpose. Péter looked suddenly nervous, his eyes darting about in search of an escape route and now Tony was sure of it.  Rogers’ eldest boy had been meeting someone, but given his age and that rising flush in his cheeks Tony could hazard a guess or two that didn’t involve political intrigue.
The sound pouring out of those doors was not that of his lovely wife, singing softly to amuse their children but it was no less stunning for that. He didn’t know why it struck him so dumb to learn that Stark could sing, he was a monk after all, but the rich sound of his voice stopped Steve in his tracks, his ears craning for every last word, his heart pounding wildly within his chest caught between the flush of fury that had carried him there and the strange yearning now holding him still.
"Let Pepper see to that cut on your cheek. She's not any more likely to believe you ran into the garden gate than I am, but she'll worry less."
Stefen however, did not appear to even need to think about it, responding with a dry drawl and a mischievous twinkle in his eye that Tony was suddenly aching to see more of, and despairing over the loss (it wasn’t to be).
He couldn't help himself. He was so out of sorts. What was wrong with him? It was just a boat ride and yet he felt too large for the vessel, swollen and stiff.
To Péter’s horror he felt the prick of tears and he ducked his head to hide the sight of them. But Harry must have seen because he sighed and pulled Péter in tight to his chest and clucked his tongue at him.
He stopped in front of the girl who’d arrived late and gazed down at her quietly. She stared back  with eyes wide and neck craned up to look at her father. The captain held out his hand. She hesitated and then pulled out a small book from under her dress, placing it in his outstretched palm. Without waiting for another word she turned around and bent at the waist. Rogers swatted her lightly with her book and turned back to Tony.
He arrived at the hotel just after two thirty, anxiously handing the keys to the valet who rushed out the glass doors to meet him. He’d left instructions with the concierge when he’d requested an upgraded suite, to be on the watch for his families’ arrival and to see them settled but he’d still have liked to be there to greet them.
But neither she nor Harry seemed willing to curb Johann’s behavior, and Péter couldn’t help but think back to the old Jew they’d watched get beaten in Salzburg, and that story their father had told him.
“Stefen? Are you alright, what's wrong, can you breathe?” Tony asked in a tumble of words that Steve’s sluggish brain hardly understood. Before Steve could stop him, Tony had pushed himself up off the bed and left him.
“I’m having a hard time deciding...” Steve glanced down to find Janneke Van Dyne’s brown eyes glinting up at him with unhidden mirth and his back went possibly even stiffer than it had already been. He supposed some men would be happy to find themselves in the arms of a beautiful flower like Jan, but Steve was too aware of the heat of her body pressed close to his as they stumbled through the waltz and the sticky sweet smell of her perfume in his nose made his stomach churn.
Stefen placed a hand firmly over Tony’s mouth and Tony jerked to a halt, surprised at the touch. He heard James snicker but he couldn’t take his eyes off of Stefen whose palm was a warm, barely there pressure against his mouth, but Tony was so aware of it he swore he could feel every hair on his body rise.
