“Well, in that case.  Yes.  I’d be quite willing to practice dating with you.”
Castiel woke with a start as Gabriel’s cellphone buzzed off the nightstand and landed on the floor with a clatter.
“Water?” Dean asked, pointing to it on the list.
“I don’t know,” Sam shrugged.  “Guess I could ask Sully.”  He stared at the dark house across the street, wondering how the daughter, Kat, was doing.
Cas huffed.  “I will remain silent.”
Dean took a drink, licking his lips as he settled a little closer to Sam, going on so softly Sam strained to hear him.  “We melted the bones in whatever acid Cas bought at a warehouse store.  Melted them to nothing, dumped that in one of the bags of dirt to soak it all up, then dumped said bag in White River.  As we headed south through Arkansas, we dumped all the bags in White River, until the bags were gone.  We melted and burned the bags, melted and burned the shovels.”  Dean met his eyes with absolute seriousness.  “There is not a speck of Bobby’s dad anywhere.”
“Yeah,” he said softly, sitting his bulging bag on the foot of the bed.  He unzipped it, beaming as he pulled the top most item out.  “Dude.  I took the strawberry pie.”
“We escalate!” The pair finished together, laughing.
“What about Wendy Goodson?” Sam asked.  “Did you kill her too?  For the house or...did she know something?”
Saturday morning broke bright and early.  The Talley wedding guests were gone, their rooms being cleaned.  Cas crossed the foyer, having checked the delivery to the kitchens from the local butcher.  Gabe came running through the front door.
“What the hell?” Gabe muttered.  “I swear this town gets weirder by the day.”
“Sup?  Can I pee?”
“All I got is water, coffee, and beer.”
“You think Dean took Cas somewhere?” Gabe asked.
“Hm,” Dean grinned.
“You say Wayne and Mahoney had Cas in the office and were yelling at him?”
“Apparently there is a neighborhood barbecue being held in our honor on Saturday afternoon.”
Sam sighed.  “Oh God.”
He looked back up at Dean.  Dean was sprawled out, chest still puffing, and eyes closed.
“I’m sorry, Castiel,” Chuck sighed.  “I gotta stop doing this.  I drink and... I just go overboard.”
Cas was eating little pastries and nodding along to whatever the over-dressed couple he was standing with were talking about.  The man was wearing a suit and the woman was wearing a red dress that looked like something you wore to a fancy cocktail party.  The woman rolled her eyes and walked away, another woman joining her as they went off to the side.
Dean grabbed three beers from the fridge, handing them each one.
“Hey, Cas!” Sam greeted, shoving a bag into the backseat, sliding in.
“We gotta get outta here,” he muttered bitterly.
“You are a good man,” Cas rumbled low, just loud enough over the dryer for Dean to hear.  He kissed him on the temple and rubbed a calming hand up and down his back.
Gabe lifted both hands in surrender as he stepped back, letting Dean out of the small bathroom.  “Alright.  Don’t break anything.  You two aren’t spring chickens anymore.”
Cas, after drinking several long swallows of coffee, grinned boyishly.  “I don’t even know where we were!  A park...a Walmart...then we came back here.”
Cindy nodded excitedly, making Sam want to hurl.
Melanie stepped a little closer.  “Actually, I’ve been trying to get ahold of Dean today.  I called him twice but haven’t gotten an answer.  Is he here?”
“But I AM angry,” Cas frowned.
“Yeah,” Castiel said in a breathy huff, staring at Dean’s mouth.
“It’s Bobby,” Cas said in way of an explanation that there must be good reasoning behind all this.
“I know!” Cas laughed, feeling invigorated by the grip of Dean’s hand in his and the opportunities that awaited them yet tonight.  “Sorry about all that.”
“I believe this is Crooks,” Cas added, unable to stop himself from correcting Bobby.
“I don’t cheat,” Dean grinned.
Dean stepped closer, his fingers trailing his lapel and his tie.  “I seem to remember you owning a trench coat.”
“Winker,” he chuckled, lips looser than he meant them to be.
Dean laughed a little harder.
“Huh,” Cas grinned a little at that.
Gabriel shrugged.  “What?”
“Yeah!” Both kids said excitedly.
“Actually,” Sam said, fighting hard to keep his temper, “studies have shown that having an imaginary friend is a sign of high intelligence and encourages communication skills, along with boosting self-esteem.”
Marion popped out of her doorway, heading for Gabe.
“Mr. Stevens,” Dean clarified, the kid nodding adamantly.  “And his heart...exploded?”
Castiel stepped out of his arms, turning to avoid the kiss.  “I gotta go.”
Dean collapsed, arms shaking.  “My God.  Cas.  Shit.”
Castiel shrugged.  “I... just wondered.  I appreciate the help.  The other day, I mean.”
Cas got a rueful smile at that.  “Dean and I ate there, last weekend.”
Castiel’s insides froze.  This was one of those dumb moments where Dean said something mundane and Castiel wanted to build a fucking rom-com out of it.  “Yeah.”
Castiel kissed back but could only hold on and ride out the twenty seconds of Hurricane Dean.
“I know,” Dean grinned.  “And you were uptight as hell.  All serious and nerdy.  Uptight.”
“Sparkle?” Cas grinned.
“God, you’re perfect.”  Gabe deflated back to the floor.  “Is it bedtime yet?”
Dean and Cas exchanged slightly guilty looks.
“I fixed it a week ago,” Dean butt in.  “The day you mentioned it.”
Lee stood up, shaking his hand with a grin.  “Hey, Cas.”
“Yeah?” Bobby challenged.
Gabe squinted, watching Mrs. Frieling’s slim figure pass under the streetlight.  She was on a mission.  She passed the creepy-Christmas-Carrigan’s house, passed the nosy-Nellie lady’s house, and much like her husband’s visitor, snuck along the next house and into the back yard, disappearing.
Dean grinned.  He was so friggin’ cute.  “I keep my promises,” he said quieter.  “I’m not that drunk.  We’re going to dinner.  Just me and you.”  His thick, lazy tongue licked his lips in slow motion.  “Just me and you.”
“Yeah.  I went running over there.  He looked terrified.”
“He’s...” Gabe trailed off, not sure what to say for his boss.
“I think we got lucky, considering our odds.”  Dean nodded toward a table where Sam and Gabe were eating with Ms. Dowling, Ed, Madge, Justin, and Cindy.
She gave Castiel a once-over look, smirking.  She had been in his gym class all year and always seemed to find a way to taunt him.  Nothing nasty, more flirty than anything.
Dean’s serious face made Castiel worry.  But before he could pull away in defeat, Dean reached up, brushing a lock of hair back from his forehead.  Castiel leaned down, kissing him slowly.
“That was pathetic,” Rufus blurted.
“Is it fast?” Castiel asked, stepping closer to talk more quietly and keep it between them.  “I felt like it was too much, too fast.  But I thought I was just being...stupid.”
His hands were shaking, and he was pretty sure he was going to puke.  He managed to get out of the car, leaning against it.  He wanted to disappear as Dean rounded the hood and came toward him, concern etched heavily.
“I knew the Leprechaun was no good,” Gabe swore.
“I am,” he said matter-of-factly.  “Both of them.  And a Castiel Novak.”
“Sioux Falls, here we come!”
“Just sayin’,” Dean smirked.
Dean got up, sending Lily running.  Worry crept into his chest at how defeated Cas looked, standing there with slumped shoulders and sorrow etched into his brow.  “Is the place that bad?  Don’t work there if it’s terrible!” He hugged Cas to him, wanting to erase anything that made him sad.  Cas laid his head heavily on Dean’s shoulder, hugging him back.  Dean rubbed a hand up and down his back slowly.  “I’m sorry you had such a bad day.  I have dinner in the oven.  Melanie left us some -”
Bobby cleared his throat.  “I know I’m not a house owner here, but there’s a lot of work to taking on a kid like this.  What if she kills someone in town? Or one of us?”
“I really wanted to do this when I met you.  And at the wedding,” Cas murmured, taking in every detail of Dean’s face.  Their bodies were so close now that Cas’ foot was between Dean’s and only a hair’s width separated them from chest to thighs.
It was a silent ride home.  His mother never handled him getting in trouble very well.  She took it as a personal assault on her mothering skills when her boys got in trouble.
“I was being bad cop,” Cas explained.
“You guys live around here?” Sam asked.
“Come on over to my place.  I got some books.  Some pictures and evidence that’ll prove I’m not losin’ my marbles,” Bobby said, getting to his feet.  “You got the spirit.  You’re smart.  We need people like you.”
Gabe:  I’m freaking out.  Please text me.
“We need to figure out what happened to Gary,” Sam said, the three of them refocusing.
“Then I’ll buy you a pair,” Dean frowned.  “Don’t go lookin’ for kinky shit, Cas.  You...you aren’t ready.  Trust me.”
Cas tossed their pillows onto ‘the pie’, which is what they all started calling it when it arrived and Dean announced it felt like heaven when he sprawled out on it.  He said that it might be better than pie.
“Holy mackerel!” Garth gasped.
“Here.” Sam handed Dean his phone, turning the flashlight on.
“Anyway,” Sam went on, “Mahoney keeps getting deposits from that pawn shop up the road.  AND the Smiths are getting deposits too.”
“No one is touching this ass but me,” he muttered, slapping a hand on his bare skin.
“Hello Crazytown, but okay,” Dean smirked.
Dean’s attention snapped down to Cas’ hand, which he and Gabe had splinted with cardboard and string.
“So, the new sheriff is actually with the FBI?” Sam clarified.
“Uuuhhhggg!”  Dean pulled a chair out and sat down.  “It has nothing to do with Aaron.  Aaron and I were over months ago.  This is different!  This is...Cas!”
Dean left for ‘Brooke’s’ the night they got home and didn’t come home for two days.  Castiel knew he was working and helping his dad, but Sam just rolled his eyes about Dean being so gone on Brooke.
“Morning, Jody,” Cas said, sorry it was so early but knowing time of day didn’t matter to her.
“From whom?” Sam asked.
“Most are real secretive.  They’re damn hard to find.  But there’s enough out there that we keep up the good fight to get rid of them all.”
“You’d pass up free dinner every night?” Cas asked sarcastically.
What if Cas didn’t come back?
“You’re a very confused young man,” Justin asserted, Cindy nodding with doe eyes and a pouty lip.
Gabe hugged her tight, letting her cry on his shoulder as Sam was sure he whispered reassuring things to her.  She nodded before letting him go, her sorrowful face turning up to him.
“Sheriff Jody Mills, this is Dean, Sam, Gabe, and Cas.  I just got ‘em here.  Quit tryin’ ta run ‘em off,” Bobby frowned.
Dean took Castiel’s other hand, holding it between them.
Castiel nodded.  He knew Dean’s availability was only temporary.  Choosing to lock that away for later, Castiel cleared his throat.  “Let’s get rock star Chuckie downstairs before some cop rolls by.”
“Dean fell for my shy little brother,” Gabe snickered.
Chuck’s dad was a writer.  But for the most part, he just drank and collected disability for debilitating migraines.  They never went to Chuck’s house.  His dad seemed nice, but you always had to be extremely quiet.  It was like walking on eggshells just to be there.
“If you affirmate my boyfriend, I’m gonna punch you in the face,” Dean snapped.
“Fucking illegal as shit!” Dean finished.
Castiel nodded.  “Better us get him than the police.”
“Oh...my mind gets fuzzy sometimes,” she admitted.  “Oh, Charles.  You always were so beautiful.  I’m sorry I left you penniless.  You always were such a bounder.  I hope you understand I had to hide my diamonds.”
“Gravy?” Cas offered with all the innocence of a hopeful child, which Dean saw through in a flat second.
Dean nodded, sliding his milkshake to himself, stabbing it with the straw.  “I hope.  I hope she’s different than the others.  But I gotta say, Cas, it could all be her feeling you out.”
“I was thinking we could go to the beach this summer,” his mom said, out of the blue.
“Bye,” they all said, waving.  They watched as the pair walked down Lily Dale toward Sue’s house.
“You better be.  Trains leaving with or without you in five,” Castiel grinned.
“So, Mahoney just...sucks?”
“It’s over, Dean.  You can’t be here.  Is he the one that hit you?”
“Back at my own porch, preferably,” Rufus said under his breath.
“Well, thank you!  You and your brother have such nice manners.  Good manners are important,” she said pointedly at Cas.
Chuck blushed.  “Quit it!”  He pulled his arm away, looking back at the TV.
“Wish I could predict that kind of shit,” she said with a look of regret.  “Anyway, see you guys around.”  She waved, heading back toward her car.
“No,” Dean said hastily.  “You can live with me.”
“Who is Dean Winchester to you?” She asked, what seemed more like curiosity than procedure.
“Nosy,” Gabe chipped in.
They caught sight of each other, Dean blushing as he realized he had been watching him.  But honestly, he could just watch Dean do anything.  Trying not to show his amusement, he bit back his harder grin and crossed the bedroom area, taking Dean by the hand.
“Yeah, me too, Buddy.”
“Let me know.  When school starts, I’ll be sure to look out for him.” Sully sighed.  “Well, I should go.”
Gabe and Cas nodded.
“First of all, better clothes to play in.  You like Star Wars?”  He handed him a pair of cotton shorts and matching Star Wars t-shirt.
“I’m gonna fuck you until you come,” Dean growled.  He clung to Cas’ shoulders, pounding hard and fast as his hungry mouth found his neck.
Castiel slid his hand from Dean’s neck, down his chest and took the bottle.  He studied the label, Dean, attempting to gain some composure.
It was all baffling.
“Cas and Dean are moving here too,” Sam grinned, unable to not tease his brother a little.
“Naoki and Olivia’s little girl.  Kat.  She just got taken outta here in an ambulance.  It must be pretty serious.  Olivia said she’s been sick and today she had a seizure and now she’s unconscious.”
“You boys are playing awfully rough,” Naomi warned from her chair under the umbrella.
“Your mouth is getting braver, but you’re still shakin’ like a leaf,” Dean said in more of a normal voice.
Castiel’s heart skipped more than a beat.  He swore it swelled up like a Bugs Bunny Cartoon character.
Sam and Dean exchanged baffled looks.  He regretted not listening more closely to Gabe’s silver swans.  Turns out the crazy fairy lady, Marion, might have been smarter than all of them.  Wayne was the evil one.
“It’s nice up here,” Castiel said quietly.
Dean rolled his head, giving Castiel a smirk.  “You don’t make me uncomfortable, Cas.  I’ve known you too long for any shit like that.”  Their eyes were locked into a stare again and Castiel’s mouth dropped slightly when Dean’s hand went back to his knee.  “See?”
Sam shrugged.  “Never thought too much about it.  Our dad had a friend like that.  Missouri Mosley.  She was the real deal too.”
“Yep.  Nice ladies, great kid.”
“How about we get carry-out,” Mary offered, “and bring dinner back here?”
“Douchebags,” Sam swore, staring at the door hatefully.
Gabe scrambled after it, sliding his thumb across the screen as he hung precariously out of bed.
Arguments broke out around the room, the air filling with accusations and excuses.
“We do!” Sam nodded, following them out to the porch.  “You don’t have to go to all that trouble though.”
Dean’s hand crept up the inside of his forearm, making Castiel’s breath catch.  His fingers crooked and slid down to his wrist, raking his skin softly.
As far as the neighborhood kids?  He wasn’t sure how to fix things on that front.  All he could do was be an ear to listen and a shoulder to lean on.
“Sounds like a good idea,” Luc said, surprising him.
“Dean,” Cas said softly.
Bobby nodded, taking a long draw of whiskey.  He sat the empty glass on his desk with a hard plunk.  “I was a kid.  I didn’t know shit about shit.  My mother screamed at me.  Screamed...” he swallowed hard, looking down at his glass.  “She told me ta fix it.”
“Did he...” Gabe started to ask but just couldn’t seem to finish the question.
“She loved that you traveled!” Camille insisted.
“So, you’re really doing it?  No more Deadliest Catch for you?”
“Oh, you gotta be kidding me,” Dean spouted off immediately.  “Lucky Charms is the boss?”
“In my personal space,” Gabe smirked.  “You’ve been in my space since you were born.  All up in my business.”
“Alaska.  I was working on a crabbing boat.”
He didn’t hear anything they said as he went inside and shut himself in the bedroom.  He paced in front of the door, glaring at the bed he had shared with Dean.  He started packing his bag.  They were leaving in the morning, he should have packed it sooner anyway.  Now he crammed everything in.
“Want me to lay down?” He muttered quiet enough that only Dean could hear.  Castiel’s eyes dropped to Dean’s lap.
“You can call me Pops, everybody does,” the man grinned, reaching to shake Dean’s hand.
“Will you drop me off?  Gabe and Fletcher wanna stay longer but I’m ready to be home now that you’re back.
It warmed Sam’s heart that everything was coming up roses for Garth and Bess.  He hoped all of Lily Dale was as genuine as them.
One year later
“But -” Chip stammered.
Just one kiss...oh...it seemed entirely more powerful than just one kiss.  Dean’s grin softened and he looked away, going back to trying his milkshake.  The look of joy as he sucked on the red and white swirled straw was really trying Cas’ ability to stay socially appropriate.
He inched closer.
Dean headed to the second floor kitchen in hopes of finding something to eat.  In a house with eight refrigerators, there was always bound to be a snack of some sort.  He opened the first fridge, pulling out leftover beef roast.  He went to work making sandwiches.
************************************
Gabe nodded.  “Yeah.  Hella-creepy.  Somber as Cassie and stern as an iron pole.  Guy creeps me the fuck out.  I won’t be hangin’ around long.”
“What?  That she’s a robot?” Dean smirked.
“I just started working at Charming High,” Sam said, cutting off any chance Gabe had of making a comment about the night-time affairs.  “And Gabe is working at Sunset Fields.  What do you two do?”
“Well, that was a bust,” Dean sighed, sitting at Sam’s kitchen table in defeat.
His brain completely stalled.  Whatever suave persona he had planned on attempting was completely blown.
“What the hell was that?” The woman asked, looking worried.
Cas and Dean waved.  “And here she comes,” Dean muttered under his breath.  Nellie came down her porch steps, empty watering can in hand.
Sam’s smile widened.  “You’re amazing.”
“Is he doing the sock puppet thing?”
“Thought he was gonna kiss me,” Dean chuckled.  His thoughts danced merrily for several seconds.  Cheerful little thoughts of sweet kisses and warm hands and sparkling blue eyes.
“Is it a big secret?   He doesn’t want to get caught?”
She frowned at the dog and crossed her arms over her chest.
“Guess I was about nine.  I spilled something at dinner.  Milk, maybe.  Made a mess.  My father got angry.”  Bobby sighed.  “He was a mean son of a bitch.  Started hitting my mom and...”
Dean stammered into a hard laugh, Gabe joining him.
“They were black and satiny,” Chuck went on, worry or booze making his voice tremble a little.  “She kept rubbing my ass!”
“Hills Have Eyes?” Gabe offered.
Wayne rocked back on his heels a bit, his eyes shifting back and forth.  “Weeeell...I’m pretty sure it was aliens.”
Bobby studied them both, his eyes narrowing beneath the bill of his cap.  “Anybody that owns as much as that man, is dirty somehow.”
She sat up, going back to a conversation with Bobby about the wiring for his and Cas’ kitchen.  He stabbed some chicken, putting it on his plate, catching Jody’s eye.  He shook his head ‘no’ subtly.  No luck finding a cure.  She gave him a small resigned smile.
“You better be icing cookies with that knife, Krampus!” Dean yelled, both he and Sam edging away as far as the restraints would allow them.
******************************************************************
“You sure about this?” Sam asked.
“You look scared out of your mind,” Luc grinned with a slightly predatory glint.
“Yeah, you can be quite a dick.”
“Why are you riding home with Luc?” Kevin asked.
“You did?” Dean grinned, the nervousness settling to something more like pleasant surprise.  Yes, that was better.
He ran his fingers through his hair and heard the doorbell ring again.  “Son of a bitch.”  He went downstairs, but no one was around.  He opened the door, surprised to see a delivery man standing there.
Castiel’s eyes opened.  He tipped his chin up to look at Dean.
“Right?” Dean laughed.  “Dude at the register seriously needed a shower.”
Dean was leaned against the counter, sipping a coffee with a grin.
“I was single on plenty of those long outings to sea,” Dean blushed, sitting back.  “People have needs.”
All three men arched a brow at that.
“I wouldn’t go up there yet,” Cas cautioned.  “Gabe and Sam went up there not too long ago and they had that...look.”
Finally coming up for air, the pair laughed, both of them wiping their mouths and teary eyes.
“I hope she stays gone and forgets about Dean.  She really did a number on him.  I was never so happy when he dumped her for good after graduation.”
“Weeell!” The man said boisterously, “Chip Harrington!  Most people just call me Pops.”  He shook their hands firmly.  “Welcome to Charming Acres!  Safest town in the USA!”
He leaned over, kissing him chastely.  His serious mood spread instantly to Cas.
Before Castiel could decide to hit Dirk or move out of the way, Sam clocked him a solid punch to the side of his fat head.  Dirk hollered, stepping back.
“I’m gonna play WITH you,” Castiel grinned, blushing.
One of Dean’s hands slid up Castiel’s thigh, under his shorts to the juncture where his ass met his leg.
Dean frowned up to the bursts of red and gold fireworks above them.  “That’s not what life is for you, Cas.  Quit listening to people that put you in a box.  You can do whatever you want.”
“She steals the sugar packets from her table at lunch every day.  It drives the nurses nuts.”  Gabe chuckled.  “I brought her a pack of Pixy Stix and now she calls me ‘Sugar’.”
“Hey gang,” Bobby interrupted. “There’s a police officer at the door asking to speak with Cas.”
Dean turned incredulous, wide eyes to her.  “Back off, crazy-eyes.  You don’t get a vote.”
Castiel could hear his mom giggle from her bedroom.  It was good Gabriel was here with them.  Otherwise, him and his mom could fade into a quiet existence.  He was good for the both of them.
“Let’s see how she likes this.”
Sam covered his face with both hands, pacing away again.
“I’ll let you know if I hear anything,” Sam said, wiping his face before kissing him goodbye.
Bobby rolled his eyes, all of them heading toward Bobby’s place.
“Is he bein’ a dick?” Bobby asked.  “Ru -, dammit! Hunter!  Quit bein’ a dick!”
Gabe goes to work.
“Very good!” They both mumbled back, mouths full.
“Monsters are real,” he swore.  “Werewolves.  Vampires.  Ghosts.  Wendigo.  Djinn.  Bad creatures that kill humans.”
“Ease up, the pair of ya,” Bobby groused.  “Sam and Gabe are married.  To each other.  And Dean and Cas are -”
“Yes!” Kevin added.
Dean pulled into one of the furthest spots, Sam pulling up next to them.  Bobby came toward them from the front door with a big grin and hands stuffed deep into his coat pockets.  Dean couldn’t help but grin at Bobby, who looked pretty damn happy for once!
Castiel’s initial shock was quickly replaced with a happy realization and the fact that he was allowed to have this little moment of uncensored time with Dean.
Sam moved over, hugging him to his side.  “It could be the violence.  Some parents try to curb that at such a young age.”
Castiel took his ground, staring at Dean.  “Somebody’s goin’ down,” Castiel smirked.
“1985.” The man declared.  “Worst year of my life.”
Dean adjusted beneath his touch, moving just a little closer.  Castiel was glad he was laying down.  He was glad his eyes were shut.  He was glad no one was watching.  He shivered a breath out slowly as his hand glided down Dean’s side, feeling the muscles beneath.  Dean gripped his side a little more firmly.  His hand slid down, resting on Castiel’s hip.
“What’s the plan?” Gabe asked.  “You talk to pops?”
Castiel didn’t want Dean to see him that way.  “Well, don’t tell her, because she’d be sad to know that I hold hands better than her.”
“See,” Claire said dryly, “they think this is nuts too.”
Castiel’s eyebrows shot up.  “You bought lube.”
“I don’t need the smutty details, thanks.”
Dean nodded, his jaw still clenched tight.
Sam nodded.  “Nice!”
Cas narrowed his eyes and looked at his watch.  Gabe moved on, heading to the next room to repair a bed that he had already repaired once before.  He stopped in the doorway as a police officer stepped out of Goldy’s old room across the hall.
“I’m sure he’ll be fine,” Sam added.  “You think the Smiths are in on this jewelry thing?”
“I’ll kill ‘em,” Gabe snarled.
His hormones were racing like bumper cars, crashing and deflecting.  He had no idea how to keep up at this game.
“Oh my God,” Gabe groaned, leaning forward to put his head in his hands.
“Let’s watch a less scary movie,” Charlie suggested.
“Unbelievable!” Cas scoffed quietly.  Something about the entire exchange made Dean finally friggin relax.  Cas looked so put-out, that Dean’s nerves relented, and he had to laugh.
Castiel had completely forgotten.  The conversations they had last week seemed like an eternity ago.  He had fallen hard for Dean and packed it all away again in the span of three days.
“Guys!” Dean said, staring at a white, wood door next to the refrigerator.  Sam and Cas crowded behind him.
He held his hands out with a questioning grin.
“Shh!” Dean warned.
Dean’s face sobered a bit.  “Sleeping spot.”
Sam laughed.  “He stormed right up to Dean’s open car window and said, ‘Look here, chisel chest’.”
“Like a noose,” Dean muttered just out of Garth’s earshot, making Sam wince and Gabe smirk.
“Goodnight, Dean.”
Sam nodded, backing away.  “He’s a really good kid, Mr. Smith.  I hope he doesn’t get punished too harshly for just being a kid.”  Knowing he was pushing the situation, because no parent wanted to be told how to parent, he gave Justin a forced grin and walked out of the yard, heading back home.  Cindy may think twice next time, knowing at least one neighbor was keeping an eye out for Fletcher.
Sam whacked his arm, smiling at Sheila and Marion apologetically.
“It means she was taking a medication that often causes confusion as a side effect.”
Leads are falling into place.  More investigating is done and more secrets are revealed.  What exactly are they getting in the middle of?
Dean sighed, turning the radio on.  It wasn’t enough to nudge him out of the way and Castiel grinned a little harder.
“Stay in the car,” Castiel said quietly, getting out.
“A Stepford mayor to control the Stepford inhabitants?  No, not fishy at all,” Gabe shook his head, gathering cards and shuffling.
Camille glanced around, pulling out of Sam’s grasp as Melanie ran a soothing hand up and down her back.  Cindy Smith went out the door, likely to collect Fletcher, with a painted-on grin and endlessly perked eyebrows.
“Well lookie there!” Ed chuckled, finding them in the crowd. “I see we picked up another passenger!”
Castiel noticed abruptly that they were the only ones in the room.  Sam, Chuck, Kevin, and Jo had all been here before he dozed off.  “Where’d everybody go?”
Wayne looked easily outmatched as he grimaced and took a step back, brushing against the tree, making palm tree and flamingo ornaments swing precariously.
“No more undercover gigs that last so long!” Cas frowned, letting her go.  “It hasn’t been the same without you around.”
Dean shut the lid to the grill, gathering his brushes to rinse them with the hose before taking them in.
“Hey,” Sam, now that he’d diffused the situation, wasn’t quite sure what to say or do with it.  “Would you happen to have a nail?  I was working in my shed and...I...can’t seem to find any nails.”
Mary shook her head with frustration.  “I don’t know.  Ground them all until they’re thirty.”
Dean waited, letting him adjust to the sudden, tight fullness.  Cas took several deep breaths, shifting his hips.  He lowered his chin, staring into Dean’s eyes with a challenge.
“That was oddly specific,” Gabe deadpanned.
“I am,” Dean said back, trying to embrace an air of nonchalance.
Cas gasped, rocking his hips to seek more.  By the time Cas was ready, his legs trembled with anticipation.  His eyes flew open when Dean was suddenly gone from him.
Cas shook his head, grinning.  He hadn’t asked last night when Dean came to bed, wanting to make love rather than anything friskier.  And he didn’t ask now.  Gabe was happy.  Dean was happy.  And he hadn’t seen Sam yet today, but he was pretty sure, wherever he was, he was happy.
He gave her a pat on the arm.  Both Sheila and Goldy could get confused from time to time, but it still bothered him that Goldy had reacted that way.  He would never steal from these people.  Anyone, for that matter.  “See you later, Marion, duty calls.  Sheila, no flirting with Mr. Jones over there.”  Sheila laughed, waving him off.
Castiel shook his head no.  If Sam blew this, he’d miss Dean’s graduation.  Over Dirk the jerk and his need for constant negative attention.
“Lemme guess.  Is it Rosy Palm and her,” Gabe counted each finger up, “five sisters?”  He made a lewd masturbation movement with his hand.
Castiel didn’t really want to go home.  The Sub was a sandwich and pizza shop downtown that most kids from their school went to.  The thought of being alone at Luc’s house honestly made him a little nervous.  “The Sub is good.”
Dean’s edgy demeanor relaxed.  “Yeah?”
His eyes flew open again as Dean let go of his hand.  His hand appeared from the blankets like a ghost.  Dean looked worried.  “I think I better go upstairs.”  His thumb gripped Castiel’s chin as soft as a whisper.
Cas pressed his mouth together, unsure what to say to her.  She was so young.  And yet, knew about so much already.
“She is not a wolf yet,” Cas defended.  “She may never be.  And I would argue that we are a sanctuary.  The girl is 17 with no family.”
“Did you think I was gonna be freaked out, Cas?” Sam asked, looking worried again.
“Are you gonna even give me a chance to talk?” Dean barked in a whispered yell.
“Alright,” Bobby glared.  “Simmer down.  We’ll...we’ll get back in there.”
He put their clean-up gear on the floor and the blankets on the pie.  “But...how did you know we would be in here?”
Castiel nodded.  He took the baby from Luc and took the simple kiss that came with it.
Gabe nodded.  “I’ll keep my ears open and eyes peeled.  I’ll let ya know if I see anything.  I knew those Smiths were shady.”
He grabbed his wallet and decided he was taking his husband to Harrington’s for one of the milkshakes he kept hearing good things about.  Just as he turned to shout up the stairs, there was a knock on the door.  “Son of a bitch,” he muttered.
“Yeah!” Zoe nodded, coming closer.  “You just have to keep the ladder out of the pool, bring her fresh flowers once a day, and she LOVES goldfish crackers.”
“I...I’m just the janitor.  You should talk to this guy,” he pointed at Cas.  “He’s the nurse.”
“When I got here.  Came over to get the hell outta that circus Cas started.  Blew up at dad.  Told him...God.  I blabbed about everything.”
Gabe nodded.  “She mighta just lost her temper, sounding worse than what you’re imagining.”
“Don’t get burnt,” Sam warned.
“Something like that,” Dean grinned.
“That’s it!  Doc Mahoney and the coroner were talking about it.  Said his heart was, and I quote, like mush.”
“Dinner will be ready in half an hour or so,” Sam said softly.
Castiel flushed with embarrassment but nodded.  “Okay.”
“Sammy!” Dean hollered, stepping into a bare living room with hardwood floors, a fireplace with a real mantle, and built-in shelves on either side that his nerdy brother would surely have packed with books by the end of the week.
“Why’d you kill your husband?”
*****************************************
“I like everything!” Dean gasped.  “And that!”
“Hey!” Luc waved, watching a group of guys walk by.
Castiel blew out a breath when the timed run was up.  He had a pretty high score.  He looked over at Dean’s, grinning.
“Wayne’s a fairy?” Bobby asked, looking lost.
And then small things became big things.  That was how life generally worked.  Small things were small when people were happy.  But after two years...his mother was no longer happy.  Gabriel’s dad was rarely home and he drank a lot.  He always had headaches and he never wanted the boys around.
He crossed the room, hugging Charlie next.  “Thank you.”
“What?” Dean asked, all humor gone.  “Gary?”
Cas glanced over his shoulder and around them on all sides as he leaned forward.  “It went well.”
“Hey.”
Dean reached up, running his hand down Castiel’s upper arm.  Castiel fought the gasp in his throat and the urge to lean forward and kiss him.  He was also able to maintain eye contact.  “See, you’re getting better all the time.  Won’t be long until some guy is glaring at me to stay away from you.”
She sat back, pinching the bridge of her nose.
He hesitated at the foot of the stairs.  He spent a lot of time in their basement, but he rarely went upstairs.  Even most of their sleepovers were down in the basement.  Sam just kept going, disappearing into his room.  Dean had his own room.  The door was shut with a poster of AC/DC on the outside of it.
Cas had come untouched three times in his entire life.  All of those times with Dean.  He could feel him petting a hand down his side.  “I feel you squeezing, shaking, baby.  But I’m not gonna touch that fat, hard dick until you start coming.”
Finally reaching her, Cas slowed to a walk, mopping his forehead with the front of his t-shirt.  “Hello.  Can I help you?”
Dean knelt down, kissing Cas, who chuckled into it.  When he stood back up, Cas handed him one of the bowls, Rum following him two steps to finish it.
Dean shook his head.  “I dunno why he likes me, but I might as well enjoy it while it lasts.”
Fred waved as Bobby took his seat.  Cas returned the laptop to the nurse’s station and told the unit clerk he was taking his break.  He headed down the hall, surprised when Sam came around the corner looking extremely lost and hesitant.
They turned around, heading toward Singer Lane, hoping to avoid Nellie’s watchful eye.
Donna grinned back at Gabe, making him gulp.  “Cops make ya nervous?” She asked understandingly.
“Better break out that bottle a Jonnie,” Rufus said darkly.
Castiel checked on Mrs. O’Malley, one of the three other residents besides Fred on Tolteridine.  Unlike the others, she actually had Parkinson’s Disease and the medication seemed to be an apt prescription for her and benefiting her.
Sam blew out a breath.  “The Starks.  Both of them, which is like six accounts.  And the Carrigans.  I also got past accounts for Imelda and Goldy.  And Melanie.  And I checked into Fred Jones too.”
“Just ask Sully if you want the real breakdown on that one.”
“Better start charging rent,” she added.  She was younger than some of the older, more frail residents, but a mild stroke had left her disabled enough that she needed care while she went through therapy, hoping to return home in a few weeks.
Dean took the sheets and headed to the house.  Against his better judgement, he smelled them.  The kid was no novice at hiding the habit of peeing in the bed.  They smelled clean.  He tossed a dryer sheet in with them and started them on high heat to hurry up the process.  When he turned to walk out of the laundry room, he gasped, seeing Cas leaning in the doorway, blocking his way out of the tiny room.
“The Gas-n-Sip they put in that old place?” She asked, her perceptive blue eyes on him.
Dean grinned wide.  He knew way too much and was going to walk out of this one of two ways.  Either he was gonna get a lot of people arrested, or he was gonna end up dead of ‘heart issues’.
“So,” Cas clarified, “you think Maggie killed Wendy out of anger?”
Gabe stopped, staring at the man.  “Yeah.  What exactly happened to him?”
“You kids have fun now,” Gabe insisted with a huge grin as they stepped down the porch steps.
“Ugh!” Gabe turned, slipping his hand into Sam’s.
He looked down at Buddy, who was nervously standing next to him through the whole ordeal.  “Your daddy is a jailbird.  How you feel about that?”
“Where is he?” Gabe asked, his voice shaking.  “Where is he right now?”
“Keep what?  Messing around?  I mean, at this point you’re tutoring me as much as I’m tutoring you.”
“Thanks,” Gabe and Sam said.
“Any clean-up I need to do?” Jody asked.
“Did I miss something?” Gabe asked, looking around at the three of them.
“Jerk,” Sam grinned.
“Shit, that was fast,” Sam frowned.  He turned back to Castiel with a worried look.  “It’s a bad idea, isn’t it?”
“Buncha clean kitchen freaks,” Sam added, disgusted already.
Castiel came to find that he did not like, nor trust, Dr. Mahoney.  In the week he’d been employed at Sunset Fields, he made it a point to check every resident’s chart for Tolteridine.  There were four more residents taking this particular medication, which in high doses or with the right person, caused serious confusion and even hallucinations.  He studied Fred Jones, one of the four on Tolteridine, as he sat at the next table in the day room, staring blankly at the television.
“Fine,” Cas relented, “this is a hippie restaurant.  But there is nothing wrong with sourcing foods locally and praising your patrons to improve their day.”
Dean squeezed his hand back.  “I’ll have to remember that.”
Cas and Dean meet for the first time in several years.  We learn a little more about the neighbors.
“No.  This town appears more worried about its reputation than the truth,” Sam stated bitterly.  “I called Sully today and he said the local coroner is a friend of the father of one of his students, or something like that, and yesterday he was upset because he’d never seen anything like what happened to Gary.  He said his heart was a pile of mush.”
“Shove it,” Dean panted, “shove it in deep.”
Gabe, Sam, and Bobby’s faces took on a guarded look.  Maddie, who never missed anything, turned to look up at them.  “Kat’s mommy is sick now too.”
“Nice!”  Sam stood up, stretching as Gabe walked in from work on his hour lunch break, looking adorable in his blue uniform.  “Hey!”
“Ew,” Dean stated.
Gabe’s arms squeezed Sam around the middle.  Bobby glanced at him with shock.
“It was soooo obvious they were fucking,” Gabe went on.  “And Deb was kinda snotty introducing PJ’s wife, Linda, and their KID.”
She straightened, her hand lowering back to her side as Fletcher turned toward him, tucking his hand away, sniffling.
Completely overwhelmed by how bizarre she was acting, Dean backed away as far as the chair would allow.  “I’ll try and remember that.”
“I’ve never been able to actually sit so close to someone while they were driving,” Cas grinned at him.  He had slid over and they were now shoulder to shoulder along the bench seat.
Past Harrington’s, there was a strip of small shops.  Jack’s Grocery was first.  A tiny grocery store that had a little of everything, plus a bakery and deli.
Dean sighed.  They got out of the car, Bobby heading toward them with Ellen.
“What?”
“Don’t get your panties in a twist.  The picture...the, the, the picture from your wedding!  You, me, Gabe, Cas.  It’s one of my favorites,” he finished quietly.
Cas looked at him and sat up a little straighter in the chair.  “The company, for one.  Tonight was fun.  I like being able to hang out with you guys.”
They left the room to answer the door and Dean sagged against his ropes.  His head jerked up again when he felt Sam sawing away at his rope.  He forced the washcloth out, smacking his dry tongue and lips a few times.  “What are ya doin?”
“She does this sometimes,” Marion assured him, watching her table mate.  “She has a touch of the shining, if you know what I mean.”
“I’m tellin’ ya,” Dean said under his breath, “the misses probably caught sight of Gary’s car parked outside that by-the-hour, fleabag motel with the neighbor and it somehow got him in the ticker.”
“Naomi, I’m so sorry to intrude, but I need to tell you what happened.”
The aide nodded.  “Happens fast sometimes.  She had a heart attack, they said.”
Fletcher dashed into the bathroom while Gabe brought the bags to the kitchen table.
Gabe watched the pair leave the dining hall, wondering what had just happened.  It bothered him that she thought he would ever steal from her.  He looked back at Marion with a nervous grin.  “Guess she really thought I’d take her waffle.”
“See?”  Dean squeezed his hand gently.  “Still alive.”
“Chicken,” Cas teased, making Dean snap-to.
He jogged down the steps and walked quickly the whole way home.  He yelled a quick hello to his mom, bypassing her completely to head up the steps and shut himself in the bathroom.
Sonny gave it a thoughtful ponder, her empty tray turning to lay against one hip.  “Yeah, well, he’s as shady as they get.”
Dean and Sam exchanged the briefest look and Cas assumed they were excited to have gained entry.  Don led the way through a foyer lined with expensive paintings, marble floors, and a chandelier.  The house was beautiful from the outside, but on the inside, it was the nicest house Castiel had ever set foot in.  Unfortunately for his curiosity, Don’s office was just off the foyer, so they did not get to see more of the house.
Brandy looked at her carefully, stepping closer to Dean as she snuck into the room.  “You’re the hunter.”
“Me?” Dean barked.  “Ellen and Bobby are way crabbier than me!”
“Hey there, Mr. Stark,” Dean grinned, his hands sliding into his pockets.  “We were wondering if we could have just a few minutes of your time.”
“Should I spin you three times?” Cas chuckled into his ear, making Dean grin and tuck his chin a little.
Bobby shoved his hat off, scratching his head with a sigh.  “It ain’t that simple.”  He sighed again in exhaustion, the years of the burden weighing in the creases by his eyes and circles beneath them.
Dean snickered.  “Extremely.”
Gabe shrugged.  “Not sure on that one.  She can be so uptight.  But...she loves you.”
“I said I was bi!” Gabe added, waggling his eyebrows.
“Yeah,” Castiel said quietly, feeling like a neon sign above him said ‘I’m washing your brother’s cum out in the sink right now’.
Dean released his wrists, pressing him flat to the bed again.  “See ya tonight.”  Dean got up, grabbed a pair of shorts and left.
So far, it was an unsatisfying, lonely zone.
Dean scoffed.  “I did one better.  I got us invited.”
“Dude,” Dean frowned, his tart prepping freezing in place.  “You hacked into a bank?”
“What?” Castiel demanded.  He had been crushing on an unavailable Dean for so long that he was sick of waiting around for the world to change.  Luc was available.  And interested.  And Dean had ruined it.
“You want me to turn around and head south down I-29?” Dean grinned in the rearview mirror, Sam smirking back at him.  “Get you a milkshake and a smile?”
“Dean,” Sam scoffed.
“No doubt,” Castiel admitted.  “Gotta say I’m kinda curious.”
Dean nodded, still grinning.
“What?” Cas asked in an adorably, rumbly little voice, already grinning hard.
Castiel grinned.  Tessa’s father really was a macabre man.  It was as if he carried a cloud of death with him.
“What, are you five?”  Gabe scoffed.  “Who is it?”  His grin was getting more eager.
Noises from the house quieted and the next time Cas looked out the rain-beveled windows, he knew the power was out.  The only sound now was pelting rain and rumble of thunder with flashes of lightening.
“You want me to leave you alone?” Dean grinned.
“You can, uh, wait in the kitchen.”
“I just wanted to thank you for last night,” Sam said quietly.
“I’m hurling, FYI,” Gabe said.
“So, you ran out of work to save Sam?” Dean smirked, babying his own throbbing finger.  “Where’s my knight in shining armor?”
“Told ya, you passed that test.  You’re still jumpy as hell getting touched.”
“The Carrigans know we know,” Sam yelled, all of them breaking into a run.
Castiel’s smile widened.  “And you wanna live with me?”
“No.  Not at all,” Sam chuckled.  “I just, I was acting like a dick and then the present came and then the neighbor’s little girl...”  He shook his head, struggling to rein in his feelings.
“So...let me start by saying...Crooks is a great little town.”
Her eyes narrowing slightly, Jody grinned tightly.  “Please.  I have enough on you to have you shot.”
No one was budging.
“Oh yeah.  Part man, part unicorn.  Manicorn,” Dean explained with some sort of pride, perhaps in creating the word manicorn.
Sam spent his morning working-out in the backyard, listening for any sign of the Smiths or Fletcher.  The house was quiet so far.  He finally went inside, getting a drink from the fridge as Cas came down the stairs.
Castiel shook his head.  “I couldn’t say anything because Dean asked me to keep it secret.  He’s been staying at your dad’s.”
“You won’t be alone,” Dean said softly, looking like he meant it.
Sam stuck his head out the window of Bobby’s car.  “Dean!  What do I do?”
“Not mine,” Fletcher said flatly.
Castiel’s face flushed.  He gripped Dean’s waist.  He had thought it a million times, that he loved Dean.  But to hear such words come to him from Dean’s mouth, with sincere warmth in his green eyes, with his whole body so fucking deliciously close to his own... “I love you.  I can tell you the minute it happened.  It was here, in the storage room when you came and found us.”
Cas got up from the table, approaching Dean again.  He hated when Dean was mad.  They had never gone to bed without apologizing before.  Not since they had been married over six months ago.
“Said she had been in contact with something recently, but she was human.”
“Better watch where you’re puttin’ that thing, Gabe.”
“I don’t know,” Gabe groaned.  “Dude has a problem.”
The End   <3
“Oh, you’re not getting in this,” Dean said pointedly to his brother.  “In fact, you stay as far away from this as possible.”
“Who cares,” Gabe laughed.  “If it gets the job done - ooh!”  He was cut off by a thudding blow to the face with a fairly solid pillow shot from Jo.
Jo was usually always at the Winchester’s, since her mom, Ellen, ran a bar and restaurant a few blocks over.  Charlie was often there too, but at a year older than the rest of them, she often hung out with Dean and Benny as well.  She liked working on cars with the guys.
Castiel loved the ocean.  The vastness of it.  The ebb and flow.  The secrets it held.  The mysteries.  He stood there in wonder for a few minutes, feeling the warm water rush over his feet, making him sink into the sand.
“Fine.” He understood where Sam was coming from, but these kinds of situations weren’t always easy.  “Then be smart.”
Dean groaned, taking his hand off.  He pulled his cum-slicked hand back, jacking himself against Castiel’s ass.
“One of the residents died today,” he said quietly.
Fletcher grinned like he’d just won a prize.  “We’re having French toast.”
“Wait...is Maggie staying at Sue’s house?” Dean asked, seeing the same thing he was.
Chuck’s words were slurred and there was a familiar lilt to his voice that he got when he was drunk.  “Chuck, where are you?”
“Where are we delivering him?” Castiel asked, “ya know what, never mind.  We’re taking him to Sam’s.  Looked like they were already having a party.  What’s one more drunken lush.”
Dean turned to him.  “Stark’s here?”
Oh very, Dean thought, sipping his whiskey, and keeping his wandering eyes on the ice that clinked in the glass.  “So...you like the Dowling House?”
“I’m okay,” he said quietly, looking at his hands, fidgeting with the wet sheet.  Dean gave Sam a look, he knew by the look on his face that Sam was thinking what he was thinking.  There was only one reason a little boy would be out late at night hanging wet sheets on the clothesline.  He must have wet the bed.  He had done it for Sam several times so their dad didn’t know.
Castiel nodded.  All he wanted was this.  Dean wanting him as bad as he wanted Dean.  “I guess we’ll make ‘sneaking around’ a new game.”
“Never said I was bringin’ you any prospects, Pamela,” Bobby grinned.
“I’m gonna go see the lion!”  Claire’s face lit up.  It was hard to crack that sullen exterior most of the time, so Dean was glad to see her get excited.  She went out the back door without another word.
“Sam!” Fletcher exclaimed, weaving through until he landed on him with thunk and a solid hug.
They sat quietly for some time.  Eventually, Gabe had him relaxed.  “I was just reading about Mayor Chip in the paper.  Apparently, this town is on the brink of winning the ‘US safest and friendliest city’ award for the sixteenth year in a row.”
Sam smiled at her again.  “You...know that?”
Gabe laughed, taking his husband by the hand.  They walked to Harrington’s, noticing Dean’s car was gone from where it had been parked.
“What are you doing here?”
Dean smirked.  What a nerd.  ‘As am I.’ Who says that?  Teal’c from Stargate came to mind.  Data from Star Trek.  Someone sophisticated.  Not someone like him.  He glanced at his fiancé and still couldn’t believe he felt the way he did.
Sam watched as another man came behind him carrying a small cooler.
“No, Gabriel.”
“He’s stealing!”  She protested.
Dean laughed.  “Sorry.  It’s no damn wonder you get hit on all the time.  But the rest of the world can fuck off.  You’re all mine.”
“What?” Garth asked in shock.  “No!  Dudes, he retired!”
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, letting go of his hand and getting up.
Sam pulled his phone out.  “Saw this really funny vine the other day.”  He scrolled, showing Cas a clip of a girl.  He grinned at the video.  Sam scrolled to another one.  They passed the time easily and Castiel knew he just needed to talk to his friends.  Why was this so damn hard?
“Warm me up?” Cas grinned harder, petting through Dean’s damp hair, watching every second of how his body arched, his hands gripped his hips, and his eyes shut, lashes long and pretty against his freckled cheeks, until his mouth stretched open, swallowing him into a sinful pocket of wet heat.  He continued to pet through Dean’s hair, seeing his ass sway gently with the encouragement.
“Hey!” Sam grinned, always glad when Gabe got home.
“Was he alone?” Charlie asked.
Dean licked his lips, his grip tightening just slightly.  “For you, I’ll take a kiss.”
“And Donna can figure out the rest,” Sam added.
He kissed Dean’s fingers again, praying he had not just ruined one of the hottest, most soul-soothing moments of his life.
“Well, it’ll look weird sitting on the curb.  The neighbors might bitch.”
“Yeah,” Dean said entirely too dreamily.  “And!” Oh, he needed a fucking cork to stuff in his mouth!  “And, you said I was gorgeous.”  Oh fuck.  He had the whiskey babbles.
“Oh shit,” he muttered, putting a hand to his mouth.  He thought back on what the two had said.  What had exactly provoked that?
Cindy put a hand on her hip, looking as scolding as a Barbie doll could pull off.  “Now, it’s no trouble!  It wouldn’t be Charming Acres without a great big neighborly welcome!”
Already in the thick of the crowd, he decided to go to the bathroom before the fireworks started.  The line for the men’s room was long.  He waited what seemed like forever.  When he came out, the fireworks were already going.
Luc knocked on the door and Castiel worried he might be in over his head.
Sam didn’t answer, but looked away with guilty worry.
Castiel sat there.  He wanted to tell Sam.  Sam was his best friend.  He should know.  He wanted him to know.  So why was it so damn hard to say?
Gabe leaned over to Sam, explaining their friend’s meaning.  “Charles,” Gabe pointed at Cas, was Sheila’s third husband.  Richie,” he pointed at himself, “was her second.”
“Did you get pictures?” Dean asked.
“Well, I’ll let you two get back to your Sunday evening,” Sully smiled, inching toward the living room.
At twelve, Gabriel was not having it.  His own mother never took him for his weekends with her.  Castiel could see how angry it made him.  How hurt he was.  But Gabe just covered his anger and hurt with mischief.
He liked Sunset Fields.  It was sunny and charming in the big day rooms.  The halls were clean, and the dining rooms were nice.  His own office was a handed-down helter-skelter of racks with everything and anything crammed into boxes and crowded in teetering piles, but he was learning where everything was.  At least it didn’t smell like the housekeepers office, which he swore could make you high off chemical fumes.
He took a deep breath.  Maybe Dean was waiting for him.  His face flushed just at the thought of it.  He got up, pulling his t-shirt off.  He paced a circle, then opened the door quietly.  Gabe and Sam were huddled together on the sofa, reading a comic together.
“Good luck with that,” Ellen muttered.
“Affirmative,” came Bobby’s voice.  “Found an extra walkie so Curbside quits crying’.”
“Yeah.  I’ve had him all summer.  Who knew the best birth control was to have a baby.”
Castiel dodged through the crowd, arriving after two hits had already been thrown.  Sam had ducked the first, but got caught by the second.  The crowd around them ooohhed.
It was dark and plenty of people were out walking, most of them seeming to be heading home.  They went into Harrington’s, noting it only had a few patrons.
“If you mean it, it’s fine,” Jo shrugged.  “I thought you were just being a pig earlier.”
Castiel grinned a shy smile at him, getting a nervous one back from Dean.
“That’s biking,” Sam corrected.
Bobby looked scared for the first time as his eyes went wide.  “You mean you were a doc at an insane asylum and checked those two out?”
“He’s like a celebrity,” Dean murmured.
Rufus pursed his lips, nodding admission.
Gabe looked up at him with some surprise.  “You think Wayne’s gonna fire you?”
Inias, the florist the couple had chosen cleared his throat from the open front door.  “Morning, Cas.”  He grinned, probably having witnessed that entire little Gabe tornado.
“Am I right?” Cas asked, staring at Bobby.
“He’s a hugger,” Sam grinned nervously.  “Dean, Cas, this is Sully,” Sam made the introductions.  “He’s my mentor at work.  Or will be when school starts.”
That was not the impression he had from Gabe.  Dean was mouthy and instigated all sorts of shit.  He was a deckhand on a crabbing boat, doing one of the world’s deadliest jobs.  He was a badass.  And all that may be correct too.  But watching him now, seeing how caught off guard he was...well...things were making sense.  Perhaps Dean’s quietness was shyness.  Particularly around him.  If that were the truth, he really had a new avenue to explore.  A spark of curious hope kindled within him.  He turned back to his work at the counter as Dean moved around him quickly to get a glass, ice, and then water.
After a brief huddle with the head housekeeper, he made his rounds to the two nursing stations and then joined Sheila, Marion, and Goldy for breakfast, eating his last granola bar between cutting up Goldy’s waffle and slipping her and Marion more Pixy Stix.
“Nooo, the creepy kid!” Charlie shivered.  Jo laughed, putting an arm around her.
“Whatever I want?” Cas laughed.  “You have no idea what I want.  This is all...hopeless.  I’m hopeless.”
“They were shouting at him,” Marion went on, her voice shaking.  “I called the police and now Castiel is in trouble!”  She covered her mouth with her hand.
“That a mob boss? Or does he mean the town?” Gabe asked Sam.
Castiel, riveted by the look in Bobby’s wounded soul, could not look away from him.
Bobby chewed his lip in thought.  “Maybe it’s been Mahoney all along.”
“I couldn’t help but notice things are kinda ‘cordial’ between you and your assistant,” Dean went on, smirking.   Don laughed as if that were ridiculous.  “Pretty good with the ladies there, Mr. Stark?  It’s a blessing and a curse,” Dean nodded as if he shared the same troubles, earning him a scathing look from Cas.
“Jeez,” Castiel went to walk away, but stopped at the solid, open palm to his chest from Dean, who pushed him back against the house gently.
“Hold on, hold on!” Dean cut in, both hands held in surrender.  “I’ll go with you.  Everybody relax!”
Dean groaned, pushing Gabe over toward Castiel more.  “Whadda ya want?” Dean groaned into his pillow.  Luckily Dean had rolled over during the night and had not been spooning him.
Gabe’s head dropped before he got to his feet.  “I miss Austin.  Nobody gave a shit who you were or why you were there.  You wave ‘howdy’ and keep moving.  These people are invasive!”
Dean lifted his hands, letting Cas wipe him clean.  He’d learned that this was Cas’ way of taking care of him and he was learning to like it.
“I don’t know!  I mean, you always caught a lot of crap for not sticking around through a relationship...but...I’m just as bad.  I don’t know how to do this, Dean.  What happens after we get married?  What if he gets tired of me?  I mean...I’m kinda boring!”
Sam was only halfway up the driveway when he saw Naoki’s front door open.  He stopped, watching as a paramedic backed out of the door with a stretcher.  He was stunned to see the tiny form of what must be their daughter bundled up and strapped in.  As they loaded Kat into the ambulance, Naoki hovered at the back door of it, calling assurances to her.  The doors shut and Naoki backed onto the grass to let them go.  She stood there doing nothing for so long that Sam was worried something was terribly wrong.  He left the grill and jogged over to her.
“Boo!” Dean laughed.
Dean was gone when Castiel woke the next morning.  A large part of him was relieved.  He could think straight and breathe normally.  He felt satisfied in a way that was new.  Like he had accomplished a goal for himself.  This is what Dean had been talking about.  He felt braver and a little more sure of himself.
“Feels good.  Too good,” he said quietly, letting his head drop.
Dean looked down at him, glancing around.  “You’re playin’ a dangerous game.”
Dean came down the steps, laying the doorstop on the porch.  “Alright.  You?”
“Ooohh,” Dean chuckled, seeing Sam through the windshield, still sitting in the back.  Hopefully, he’d aggravate Doug so much he’d forget about arresting Sam.  “You coulda at least kept it goin’ by callin’ me Bo.  Or Luke.  Either one works.”
“And Sam has been researching all day,” Cas added, pulling cups of fries and onion rings out of another bag.
Cas chuckled, turning Sam, and joining him as they walked back the way he had come.  “We are having tea with Marion and Sheila.  Your husband has become quite attached to these two ladies.  And Fred Jones, but Bobby is already visiting him, and I don’t think either of them would care to come to tea.”
“Which party?” Castiel asked, licking his lips and turning from watching him so intently.
Psychic.  She must be like her granddaughter, Melanie.  Cas had told him she read his aura or some shit like that.
Sam laughed as he heard Dean’s feet squeaking on the tub, crowding into a corner to avoid the scalding or freezing shower spray.
“I know.”  Sam stared at the side door, worrying.  “And poor Gary!  What the hell would do that?”
“Bobby,” Rufus said softly, a small warning in the warmth of his voice.
“This yer new crew, Bobby?” She asked, eyeing all of them with a grin.
Cas laughed, nodding along.  “I’m so behind from being in Japan.”
“What?” Dean scoffed.
“If I’m stuck going, so are you!” Dean glared.
Gabe followed him down the steps.  “And how exactly did being asexual come up in your orientation meeting?  Was it the word ‘orientation?’”
Dean turned the frisbee in his hands, his eyes lowering to Castiel.  “I don’t go down.”
“Yeah,” Castiel laughed nervously.  “It’s helping though.  I’m already doing better.”
“Right,” Bobby deadpanned.
“We’ll use Fletcher!” Wayne said excitedly.  “If any word of this gets out, the boy dies.”
As the end of the day bell rang, he left all his books in his locker except his Science book and notebook.  That was his first final next week.
“No,” Bobby shook his head, making something inside Cas relax.  “I touched him and Mahoney with iron.  Neither one of them burned.”
“It’s Fletcher,” Sam whispered.
“What if the basement door was at someone else’s house?  Or at the pawn shop!” Cas asked, his face lighting up.  “Doesn’t Fletcher stay at the Carrigans an evening a week?”
“It looks like Sedona, Arizona, crapped in here,” Sam said, still horrified at the clutter.
“Heard there’s a honey-hole at Weasel’s Bar.  You gotta pay like $30 to go in to the ‘private bathroom’,” Gabe laughed.
Fletcher nodded his head yes vigorously, looking quite excited about it.
“Busy.  Working.  How about you?”  Castiel only felt a faint flush creep into his cheeks.
Jody’s eyes went from Brandy to Dean and back to Brandy.  “I got in touch with another contact of mine.”  She flicked a gaze to Dean with a guilty shrug.  “I...I know another wolf pack out there that play it straight.  They stay to themselves and never hunt.  They said they would be willing to meet with you.”
“Needham?” Sam asked.
“No,” Castiel blushed.
Sam put an arm around him, kissing the top of Gabe’s head and looking relieved.  “That sounds good.”
“And mine,” Dean growled.  “And my own two lawyers.”
Dean nodded, glancing at Cas, who was staring down into his last few bites of ice cream with a grin a mile wide.
Dean smiled.  “Yeah...”
“Creeps,” Dean winced.
“Stopstopstop.  Fuuuck,” he panted.
Cas sat back with an odd look on his face that Dean didn’t follow.
“Call an ambulance, she needs -”
“I came to tell you that I withdrew my charges.  I’m not going through with it.  It was my...lack of judgement that got us here in the first place.”
Sam pulled back, leaning onto one elbow.  “You sure?  I can let you go to sleep.”
Dean came in as he was pulling his jacket on.  “The Wilson’s are here.  I saw their minivan pull up.”
Castiel’s face burned with a crimson blush.  “What?” It came out strangled.
“I’m in.” Dean slid one poker chip to the center.  “Raise you five dollars.”  He slid another chip into the center of the kitchen table.  His brother was always in for a gamble.  Even when he didn’t have anything to play.
“Let’s go.”  He took Cas’ hand, and the pair waved their goodbyes as everyone gave them a wave or a holler.
“Alright,” Bobby said, not really seeming alright.  His eyes traveled over the front of Sam’s house before he schooled his face into something more neutral.
He looked over at Cas, wanting to ask, but not sure he wanted to hear the answer to his question.  “Hey, Cas?”
“Okay!” Gabriel held both hands up in surrender.  “I promise.”
Cas returned to perching on his shoulder and smiling down on him.  “I wouldn’t say that.”
Cas rolled his eyes.  How the hell had he ended up like this.  Again.  Fucking Gabriel.
Gabe tossed the cover back, staring blankly at the blank walls of his and Sam’s new bedroom.  He groaned at the knots in his back and the dull ache in his hips.  Whose idea had it been that this would be romantic?  He was 29, not 12!  Seven years ago; maybe.  Three even.  But right now, all he could do was wonder why he and Sam didn’t have better sense than to sleep on the bedroom floor their first night in their new house.  Some of his more internal dull aches reminded him why.  Okay, new house sex was fun.
Gabe sat back.  “Shit.  I got all excited for nothing?”
“I’ll have the same,” Castiel said, trying to keep the man’s presence at their table to a minimum, for Dean’s sake.
At the wedding, he had been nervous, finding Dean very grounding and once again preoccupied with Sam.  They had more time to interact, but they were only alone once, in the waiting room while Sam finished getting ready for the ceremony.  Honestly, he barely remembered the entire weekend.  His and Gabe’s family had been a nightmare about the wedding and Cas was doing his damnedest to shelter Gabe (and Sam and Dean) from all of it.  Gabe’s decision to include their family had been kindhearted and ill-timed.  Needless to say, he’d been so distracted and worried, he had little more than passing fancies of Dean as they went through the events of the weekend.  Most memorable had been the wedding party dance.  He had danced with Dean.  While he had easily taken the lead, it was Dean who initiated conversation.  It had been very brief and neither of them seemed to have a lot of words, but it had dramatically improved Cas’ outlook.  With the simplest smile, those warm hands, and his gentle ‘Don’t let your parents ruin the day.  Our brothers are meant to be.  Look at those two.  They’re so freakin’ happy, they’re oblivious’, said just for him alone, Dean’s breath tickling his ear...Well, it had been enough to pull him from his frustration and remember to enjoy the day.  Though he would have pursued more from Dean, he knew he was leaving the next day and so was Dean.  Again, he wasn’t hooking up with Dean.  They were family now.
His face fell slightly.  “Sure.  Real go-getter.  She was a realtor.  I remember seeing her picture on benches downtown.  She died, right?  Some crazy accident at a spa.”
“We’re gonna give this town a fair try!” Cas grinned, pressing Bobby’s name on his phone screen and putting it on speaker.
“Anything new on Gary?” Dean asked, hoping to change the subject.
“I love you!” Gabe laughed, pinching Dean’s cheek and running for Cas again.  “And I love you!!”
“I can’t believe you even tried them!” Sam laughed.
Dean flipped the lights on in the billiard room and Cas went to the cabinet they kept their special floor plans in.  Cas grinned at the little pin holes that pricked the smooth surface of the papers and the silky, black tie that kept them tied together.
After the picnic they all crashed for a nap.  Eventually they collected around the kitchen table, sipping coffee and catching up.  Sam was amused with his brother.  Dean had finally confessed to him yesterday that he was shy around Cas.  That he had the hots for the guy.  He was starting to loosen up around him, which made all of them more comfortable.  Dean asked him to keep it a secret and Sam agreed.  Gabe could make it torturously awkward if he knew Dean had a crush on his brother.  They were better off figuring it out on their own.  And by the looks Cas kept giving Dean, Cas already had things figured out.  What was more amusing, was watching his badass brother squirm with shyness.  So, he let the events between the two unfold on their own.  Watching them navigate around each other was way more entertaining than anything he’d seen at the picnic.
“Otherwise known as Wayne Whittaker and his wife...shit.  I forget her name.  Frizzy red hair.  But they live across the street next to the crazy sweater people.”
Gabe:  where are you?
What’s next for Pb?  I think it’s time, folks.  It’s time to head back to Kripke Manor.  I’ve left the next installment waiting far too long.  Ya’ll know I’m slow at writing, so don’t expect anything until June.  And if you haven’t read Family Business, go read it!
“We gotta do something,” Sam argued.
“Turns out Mork from Ork has game!”  Dean chuckled as he looked back at his phone as angry little dings kept dinging as Gabe kept sending texts.  “Gabe is PISSED.  He says Sully was hitting on Sam the whole time and Sam was just too dumb to see it.”
“You are about the sweetest fucking thing I have ever seen.”
“Nothin’ to it,” Dean assured him, fist-bumping him.
Cas grinned.  He loved Krissy.  She was feisty and sweet.  He looked up at Dean, who was standing in the doorway listening.
Dean wondered what those hands might feel like.  He’d shaken his hand before.  He could recall the warm, firm grasp from the wedding weekend.  His eyes drifted up from Cas’ hand, finding him staring right back at him with a quirking grin.
This was true, making Cas chuckle.  Dean had an incredible accuracy for throwing darts.  The blindfold did not seem to hinder him at all.  This had been evidenced by his last dart, where he told Cas exactly what he was going to do to him and where, before he loosed the dart with pinpoint accuracy.
“You did,” Cas whispered.  “You tell me all the time in the little sweet things you do for me.  I’m not rushing you.  I’m just much more verbal than you.”
He cleared his throat, turning back to the counter.
Dean hugged him, sad to see his curls mostly cut off from a fresh haircut.  He looked so much older.  “I was only gone a few days!”
“Aw.  They’re great.”
“Big day!” Gabe grinned, pouring coffee, which Dean neatly stole.  “Hey!  That’s for your brother!”
“You want me to stop?” Dean muttered against his jaw.
“Why?” Bobby couldn’t stop himself from asking.
Classmates were often surprised when he first started hanging out with Sam and Dean.  They were known for fighting.  Dean much more so than Sam.  But he had been there for many of those fights since.  Knew why they happened.  Knew that bullies were often just kids acting like assholes because that was all they knew.
Dean looked at the bear.  “Apparently I do.”
“Maybe,” Dean grinned.  “We would need to know more about the plan.  And who else is involved.”
“We did!” Madge grinned adoringly.
Dean didn’t like it.  Not one bit.  There was something wrong here.  It seemed like there was something wrong in every nook and cranny of this freaking town.  And he had a real short fuse for asshole parents, which Cindy and Justin Smith must be.
He’d never had so much fun in his life.  Cas would tell him a story about Africa, and he’d share about the night The Mark damn near went down in a hurricane.  Cas told him enough about Japan that he was sure he wanted to visit.  Cas said he wanted to see Alaska, but Dean was fine with never getting back up there, though there were plenty of places in Canada he wanted to visit with him.
“More like angry beavers.”
Dean sat up a bit.  He could hear the others above them in the kitchen.
“Look,” Dean pointed, air puffing from the simple word and floated off into the night.
Castiel laughed, holding his hand back much quicker.
Gabe put his arm around Cas’ shoulders, pulling him into his side, resting his chin in his brother’s thick hair.  “I’m proud of you.”
Castiel shrugged.  “One of the boxes had all homemade mixes.  Things like Nellie’s mix, Madge’s Morning something, I don’t really remember.  But the tea is loose in little compartments and there is a set of empty tea bags, a tiny scoop, and a crimper that seals it.  You can even add a string and that tag on it.”  He pointed at the little paper square barely visible in Mahoney’s hand.  “It has a red W on it.  I figured it was just a hobby.”
“You know what,” Cas chuckled, his voice cracking as he stirred his own shake idly.
“Ewww,” Castiel and Gabe groaned, putting windows down.
“Which he is,” Dean added.
“I’m gonna need you two for some questioning,” Donna half yelled.
“Sorry,” Castiel whispered.
“The roast?”
Cas leaned over, kissing him.  Even though Dean was quite a bit more familiar with Cas and his lips and kisses, it was still quite novel.  He grinned, but it faded quickly.
“Mush,” Cas supplied, earning another wide-eyed stare from Dean and Sam.
Madge and Nellie exchanged a look before Madge smiled overly friendly.  “I believe that’s her friend and co-worker.  They travel a lot.”
“Okay, so after dinner, we’ll go for milkshakes.”
Jody nodded.  “Bess thinks Garth is a friend of mine.  That we met through you guys.  Which is true enough.  She has no idea this is a hunter safe house.  And I didn’t bring her here.  Ellen did.”
Gabe saw to it that Jake and his friends kept to a different section of the house than the bride and bride’s maids, keeping in tradition of not seeing the bride.
“Let’s see, first we find out just how much you Hardy Boys know.”
“I’m not thinking anything,” Dean huffed defensively.
“Touché!” Cas laughed, turning to look right at him, even though he was leaned in close, putting their faces so close he could see every striation of gray in the dazzling depth of Cas’ blue eyes.
“Brandy is moving in with Garth.”
“Cas!” Dean rocked, overwhelmed with the blowjob.
“Why do they all have imaginary friends?” Sam asked.  “It’s really not all that common.  And three out of the four kids that live here have them.”
“It was...good,” Castiel managed.
“I did.  I read his palm.”
“I would never count you out of anything.  Even the stupid things,” Sam teased, snorting a laugh at his own joke before he was laying on the floor, his hair fanning out and eyes going shut.
Castiel frowned.  The thought of walking next door alone did not appeal to him at the moment.
Castiel slid his hand over to Dean’s.  Dean took it easily under the covers.
“Damn right!” Bobby agreed.  “That police station ain’t safe if Donna isn’t right with him!”
All Cas could do was stare as Dean flipped the faucet on and began washing away the grime.  The muscles in his back flexed and his ass wiggled with how vigorously he washed his hands and forearms.  He could drink him in like smooth whiskey.
“Yeah.  They’re weird.  They give me the creeps,” Dean said quietly.  “This whole town gives me the creeps.”
Sam rolled his eyes, hearing the tease in his voice.  “Yeah?  Bite me.”
Gabe rolled his eyes, then winced.
“What’s up, Samshine?”
“Gabe heard they’re splitting up.  A trial separation or something.”
“Nice ta meet ya,” Bobby said, shaking his hand.
“The moving truck will be here in an hour or so.  I think Gabe has some breakfast ready.”
“Mom never looks in there!  She thinks it’s cute I still have toys!”  The pair laughed.
“Hi,” PJ said, shaking their hands with a half-interested grin.  “I live across the street, down by the Stark’s.”
“I-I bought you something,” Dean gasped.
“Suppose you heard about our neighbor.”
Luc closed the door, grinning.  “What brings you here?”
Dean’s watch went off when he was working on the trim realigning in what would be their open kitchen and dining room.  He left the boards where they were, Buddy joining him as he made his way downstairs to the back door.
Castiel shrugged.  “Sure.  Who is it?”
“So,” Castiel said, going up on his elbow again, his hand landing lightly on Dean’s chest.  “We...mess around here and when we get home, we go back to what we used to be.”
“Oh, Charles,” Sheila beamed.
Cas leaned forward, glancing down at Dean’s feet.  “That’s a party foul, Dean.”
It was different than when they were at the lake.  He just willingly took his shirt off and got in bed with him.
“Right,” Cas nodded, totally confused.  “What about gentleman callers?”
“And Imelda,” Marion smiled fondly.
The sound must have shocked Dean just as much.  His mouth paused, his whole body going still. Dean’s eyes opened, going wide.
Sam came out the front door, grinning at them as the pair laughed, nudging each other hard enough to make the swing jerk back and forth.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Dean demanded, stepping forward, quickly held fast by Benny.
“I doubt they’re talkin’,” Dean said just above a whisper.
Gabe frowned at him.  “What?”
“Stop answering the door!” Mahoney snapped.
“Huh,” Sam grinned.
He bucked against the invasion, reaching his hand around to squeeze Dean’s thigh that was now over him.
“I assure you; it is not.  I want to know,” Cas pressed gently.  “I would very much like to be.”
“Guess it’s time to go to sleep,” Sam yawned, cuddling down into the couch.
“The stern guy and his super nosy wife,” Dean answered, scooping out his second helping from the pan.
Cas retrieved his bag from the bench in the foyer, trying not to be annoyed.
Sam stared as the officer (Doug, Chip’s nephew and also the one engaged to Sheriff Dona Hanscum, who was faking her seat as ‘sheriff’ since she was actually an FBI agent) got into the cruiser, Chip following suit.
“Dean,” Cas managed.  “Shut up.”
Dean slapped against his hole several more times before stopping to lube.
“What did you say?” Dean asked.
“Hello, Gabe!” Wayne Whittaker said as the two couples joined him and Gabe.  Cas had slipped away from them.  Sam couldn’t help hoping he and Dean ended up getting cornered since they deserted him and Gabe so quickly.
Cas chuckled, kicking Dean’s ankle lightly at his teasing.
Dean’s grin sobered a little.  “Fair enough.  No mouth.  You passed that test anyway.  It’s your general proximity tests you’re failing left and right.”
“Goldy,” Cas said more firmly, taking her hand and getting eye contact, “what’s going on?”
“Deal.”
Mahoney glared at her; Cindy smiled anew but quit talking.
“We should do that,” Cas interpreted.
It took three full days of summer break to go by before Castiel worked up the nerve to go back to Sam and Dean’s house.
“Isn’t he just a kick in the pants?!” Ed laughed, pulling his pipe out of his mouth.  “You’re snoops is what you are.”
Both of them chuckled before dropping off to sleep.
Cas nodded, looking at Dean.  “I am.  Now that Gabe and Sam are settling down, I would like to be...close.”
“The Carrigans,” Bobby said low and with some shock.  “I know they’re weird but...thieves?  Seems kinda off.”
Dean sighed.  “Dorothy want you to come with her?”
“This is the Himura’s house,” Dean said quietly as they passed the narrow parking lot to Sunset Fields and walked by the small, tan-sided house.  It was two stories tall with no garage.  Though it wasn’t the smallest house on Lily Dale Lane, it always had a gloomy look to it, making it look less inviting than the others.  “Naoki and Olivia are together, but not married.  And Kat is Naoki’s daughter.”
“I’d be glad to help if Dean can’t,” Sam assured her.  “Anytime.”
Castiel grinned, moving back to his seat.  It was an unexpected conversation with unexpected responses.  He glanced back at Luc, wondering if maybe there was a lot more to Luc than he had thought.
“Hey, Justin,” Gabe relented.
Dean closed the door when he came back with a warm, wet cloth.
“We gotta go bail him out!” Dean snapped.
And what were those flashing police lights at the Frieling house?
“I don’t want you to move either.  But I understand if you go.”
“Huh,” Sam mused.  “I didn’t know you could compete at that age.”
Dean put them on under the covers slowly, watching the open door like a hawk.
Castiel pressed his head deeper into his pillow, crossing the divide of space between them, his hand gliding softly onto Dean’s side.
“I promised you I would make Sam a happy man.”
HE intended on being Dean’s first date in Charming Acres.
“They were the ones that got poisoned,” Garth said quietly.
“You have?”
“Well hey there, Mr. Winchesters!”
Tensions are mounting.
Dean gave him a curious look.
“What the fuck?” Dean whispered, looking so confused.
“He’s not at Benny’s.  I went to my Uncle Bobby’s garage.”  Sam’s voice trembled.  “He hasn’t been to work all week.  Called off sick Monday morning and hasn’t been heard from since.”
Gabe leaned forward from his spot on the swing and angrily whispered, “What did you just do?!”
“A mishap with her blow dryer,” Don said quietly.
Hello my friends!  You might want to settle in for this chapter.  Everything that is wrong on Lily Dale Lane is about to unfold!  Our boys have made enough of a raucous that there is no turning back now.
“Well, lookie here comin’,” Bobby grinned.  “The whole Lily Dale squad.”
Gabe turned his worried eyes on to him.  “No...”
He followed them down a hall, through a kitchen and into a family room where a huge TV played music.  There were more people outside on a patio and Castiel could just make out a pool in the yard.
He busied himself organizing his tools while the brothers cleaned the table and set it quickly for lunch.
Sam looked at him.
“Yeah, and according to the kid at the store, Carl’s heart exploded.”
“Bye!” Sam waved, chuckling.
“That’s a low bar, Dean.”
Gabriel, in true Gabriel style, shrugged, totally indifferent.  “I suppose.”  He thought about it a moment.  “Yeah.  Guess I would.”  His cheeks colored only the faintest, but per usual, Castiel took him for his word.
Dean gave him a perceptive look.  “It’ll get better.”
“Wait, wait,” Castiel managed, still laughing.  He felt around on the floor, finding someone’s shorts.  He slid them to Dean under the covers.
Castiel looked at the floor, too ashamed to meet Dean’s eye.  He flinched when Dean stepped over and put a hand on his shoulder.
Dean looked up at him.  “Should I?”
“I’m surprised Gabriel didn’t have a fit.  Honestly, I was expecting some brother shit.”
“I’m gonna go get a shower,” he heard Dean mumble.  His chair slid out and suddenly the kitchen was ten degrees colder and so, so lonely.
“Ohh,” Bobby grinned.  “Nihon wa ikagadeshita ka?”
Dean sighed, shrugging off the peaceful air around them, like it might stain his attire.  “Fine.”
A chill ran down Gabe’s body.  “And Imelda?”
“Mmmfuck,” Cas ground out.
“Yeah,” Castiel answered somewhat breathless.
Final chapter for this short story.
Dean laughed, adjusting his tie.
The waiter turned to Dean with the same endearing smile.
Dean laughed, squeezing Castiel’s hand softly.  “I’ll be sure not to tell her.”
“That’s not what I asked,” Gabe stated simply, still watching him.
Gabe shook his head no.  “She bragged about how well-traveled you were!  Every story started with, ‘when my Melanie was in ‘wherever’, she met Jeff Goldblum, or some other crazy thing you did!”
Sam, entirely finished with Madge’s quirks, glared at her.  He snatched the jar, shocked at how empty it was.  He pulled the lid off, snorting with disgust at a pair of nickels sliding around in what would otherwise be empty.
Gabe shrugged.  “Because they’re about to be voted the safest place in the country for like the sixteenth time and don’t want to ruin their reputation?”
“There’s nooo need to be rude about this,” she added.
“Not all monsters are cut and dry killers, Dean,” Lee said gently.
Sam glanced at Dean and Cas.  It couldn’t be coincidence that the woman Don was having an affair with was killed in Maggie’s shop.  “Was an investigation done?”
A look of understanding passed between them.  Castiel huffed a bitter laugh, dropping to his back.  “I’ll figure something out.”
Garth joined them this morning, as well as Charlie and Dorothy.  Dean leaned back in his chair (assigned by Gabe) and slouched to listen to the morning update.
Dean grinned.  Cas was in.  It seemed you didn’t just get handed a beer from these two.  No.  They had to accept you first.  And Cas was in.
One of the nurse’s aides came over, glancing at Goldy.  “Mrs. Golden, let’s get you settled in your room.”  He unlocked her brakes and pulled her away from the table and Gabe’s hand.
All the way to school, they talked about how great a trip to the beach would be.  What they could do there, what they should take, and (important to Gabe) what they would eat.
“You coming with us Cassie?” Gabe asked, turning to him.  “California!” He waggled his eyebrows.
“In a minute,” he grumbled, glaring at Dean.
Cas turned away, grinning hard at the dryer.  As he noted the crinkles at the corner of Cas’ eyes, he took off, taking the steps two or three at a time.  He pulled out one of his duffle bags and began shoving in everything they would need.  Everything that he’d had tucked under the bed in case they had sex, but he’d never gotten to use.  Clothes were shoved in next, and as he headed out of the room, Cas went in, still grinning.  “I’ll be ready shortly,” he said, winking.
Dean had to grin.  There was something so fun about shocking people that he was gay.  It was her own fault for ignoring his wedding ring.
Dean hissed at the water.
Sam Winchester was quite proud of his most recent accomplishment.  He had bought a house.  And while that might seem like a mere milestone to some, for Sam it was a marvel that was a long time in the process of coming to fruition.
Maddie shook her head no.  “Grown-ups act one way, but when they’re in the shower, they cry.”
“What?” Dean asked in shock, habitually oblivious to just how shitty their pasts actually were.  “Why?  We had some great Christmases.”
Dean blushed, staring at him in shock.
Castiel went down the basement steps.  “It’s me,” he called, knowing everyone was a little on edge.
“Cupcakes shouldn’t make you feel violent,” Gabe growled.
All the sitting and talking led to munching, which led to poker.  Poker led to whiskey.  And now they were all half drunk and had been playing for three hours.
“Sit down and shut up,” Mahoney barked, Dean returning to the couch, Cas protectively parking an arm on Dean’s thigh.
“Everyone good here?” One of the nurses’ aides asked, checking in on the table.
“You might have saved him then.”
Castiel’s elation drained.  “No... I’m not...I...”
“Charming Acres didn’t have any supernatural activity.  I even checked Kat’s house for her.  I’m pretty sure it was just her moms sneaking around at night that had her thinking there was a ghost in the house.”
Sam nodded, sitting back to try and look relaxed as Gabe clutched his hand.
As Gabe unlocked the door, Sam turned to him with a grin.  “Guess if you would have been there, you coulda defended yourself.”
Dean was sexually available at a moment’s notice.  Always.  At least, that was Castiel’s experience so far.  He liked quickies.  He liked blow jobs.  He like giving blow jobs.  He liked getting handsy.  And he liked it fun and serious.  Slow and hard.  He had never dreamed of being so well matched with someone.  “Two minutes,” he panted, wanting way more than shower blow jobs tonight.
They walked the few blocks home.  It was raining and a rumble could be heard far off in the distance.  They huddled together under umbrellas, the rain sobering them all quickly.
“Hello, Sonny.”
Without a thought, Castiel moved his head back, into the touch.  He exhaled and closed his eyes.  For quite some time, Dean’s hand slid across every inch of his back and neck.  It was hypnotic.  His entire body relaxed.
Sam rolled his eyes, focusing his attention back on Castiel and Gabe.
“I’ll head down.  The florist already delivered and the staff was decorating.”  He stopped in front of Dean.  “Steer clear of Brandy.  She already has a crush on you.”
“Thank you, again, for the cupcakes!” Sam rushed in.
“Sorry I was so stubborn about it before,” Sam grinned, reaching across the table to take his hand this time.
Dean took a huge photo of an aerial shot with lines drawn to show a large building and a surrounding parking lot.  “We knew they wanted to build a strip mall.  I guess we never really thought about where they wanted to put it.  The only thing this plan leaves in place is their house, the Whittaker’s, and the Burman’s.  And Sunset Fields.  Bobby, Rufus, and the Himura’s houses are all wiped out.”
take money from old folks?  And then what?  You just sit back and watch while others kill your residents?”  He turned to Wayne next.  “And you cover it up with all that crazy abduction crap?  Which you encourage.”
“We painted both bathrooms and the kitchen last week,” Sam went on as Dean followed him on his tour of the house.  “I’m not bothering with the office.  I’ll just be working in there when I need to.  And Gabe swears he won’t ever bring work home.”
Bobby frowned in thought.  “Yeah.  She shut the place down immediately after Wendy died there.  Guess killing your clients ain’t good fer business.”
“Now there’s a friendship I never would have pegged,” Sam chuckled, watching them leave.
*******************************************
“Absolutely,” he said just as easily.
“I did,” Cas sighed.  “Thank you.”
“What do you mean?” Melanie asked.
Castiel grinned crookedly.  “I don’t kiss and tell.  Well, I guess I did, didn’t I?”
“And talking shit about his marriage!”
A warm, low giggle erupted in his ear.
He could feel Dean’s back and shoulders through his shirt.  He was a little taller than him.  And broader.
Dean popped his ass again several times.  “What a little smart ass.  But just so you know, these hickeys will be around for days.”
“What happened?” Gabe asked.
“Camille,” Cas said gently, “what do you think Fletcher knows?”
“Indeed, it is,” came Dean’s suave voice.  “Vidal, report to the front porch, pronto.  I repeat, Lurky is on deck, report or die a slow painful death.”
“Dean,” Cas growled.
“And you didn’t tell me?” Melanie laughed.
“Yes,” Cas grinned, shoving back onto Dean’s thumb, feeling it swirl inside him with delicious pleasure.  “Dean, please, fuck me!”
Dean bit his tongue, smiling despite himself.  “Absolutely.”
“It isn’t just drugs,” Gabriel added.  “I heard he was involved in a robbery last year.”
Sam and Gabe dissolved into giggles, Sam shoving Gabe.
“Dean!  What happened?”
Gabe rested his head against Sam’s shoulder.  “Justin stopped by in a full suit and said the neighborhood is throwin’ together a shindig for us on Saturday.”
The front door banged shut and rushing footsteps brought Dean into the kitchen looking quite excited.  “Cas!  Did ya get the job?”
“I know,” Gabe grinned, wrapping an arm around his sleepy, sniffly friend.  “I love you too, you pain in the ass.”
“I do!” Dean panted, grinding down onto his fingers with a whine.  He was already shaking, and Cas hadn’t even gotten inside him.
“Well,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck.  “Good news is, Cas got out with no charges.  Gabe, not so much.  Charlie either.”
“I think he found out his business partners were dirty,” Sam countered.  “I read it on a note in the basement.”
Sam shoved him off, still laughing.  “Keep it in your pants, Gabe.”
“No!” Fletcher laughed.
Cas grinned with wry mirth.  “Alright.  Break her already broken heart then.”
“Ew!” Krissy scowled..
He grabbed his backpack from the car as Dean got in his.
“I won’t.  I couldn’t sleep at Tessa’s house anyway.  Not with Captain Death in charge.”
“I’m not sure!  I mean, he’s on that same medicine Goldy was, but so are three other residents, and other than their names and a rough history, there was no more mention of them!”
As he sat up, Dean’s hand cupped his ass cheek then slid over his bare hip, his thumb pressing into pubic hair zone.
“Uh.  No!  That would go over real well.  Hey Brooke, I know you don’t know me that well, but, I have this gay friend who’s paaaaainfully shy.  Mind if we hold hands from time to time?”
Castiel woke the next morning with a smile on his face.  It would have lasted longer if Gabe wouldn’t have bounded into the bed forgetting he wasn’t five and he wasn’t 40 pounds anymore.
Bobby glanced up at his mantle before turning to the group again.  “This is a long story.”
Dean had to grin at that.  “I don’t think they’re my kinda crowd.  But thanks.”
Cindy turned to Fletcher with an ice-cold glare.  “Fletcher.”
Castiel knew he was gripping his hand tightly.  His heart raced, and he knew he would never get to sleep.  He listened as the movie moved from a comical scene among friends to some sort of amped up situation.  Light played quickly across Dean’s face, adding to Castiel’s thumping heart.
“Not yet.  But my meeting was not with him.”  He glanced around again, leaning in closer, Dean leaning in as well.  “My meeting was with the new sheriff.  It was very...interesting.”
Cas, sitting between the two, rolled his head toward Gabe.  “Are we pulling a Florida here?”
“We picked up lunch, brainiac,” Dean smirked, both men setting down bags and cups from Fat Mack’s Barbecue Rib Shack.
“Love you, Mom.”
“Sorry, Mom.”
Castiel ran his hands up Dean’s arms, pulling him down.
Dean made a maybe face.  “I know how to relax better than you.”
Oh, fucking shit on a stick twice roasted!  Dean damn near gasped as his stomach dropped.  Cas had heard him!  SO not how he wanted this evening to start!
“Fred eventually moved in with me here, took custody of me.  Sold his place to Rufus’ family.”  His eyes moved back and forth more quickly now, his thumb still tapping.  “Time went by.  My mother never came back.  Never turned me in.  Just...disappeared.  Life went on.”  He sighed heavily.  “Me and Fred were...happy.  We were a family.  But guilt weighs heavy.”  He cleared his throat.  “When I was sixteen, I decided I needed to confess.  Well, Fred wasn’t havin’ it.  He said if I confessed, he’d say he did it.  We lived in a kinda stalemate for a while.  Then he sent me away to live with some of his family is South Dakota.  I guess the space did me good, cause I let it go.  Best I could, anyway.  Graduated high school up there.  Had a life.”
