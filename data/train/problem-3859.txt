, Cas, aren’t you
He tugs Cas close with whatever strength he can muster, fingers struggling for purchase in his t-shirt, and because sometimes, life isn’t shitty — sometimes, life gets distracted by something shiny in the distance and for once, you actually get what you need — Cas quickly scrambles to cooperate, gently maneuvering Dean back to safety before tucking into him, warm and solid and just —
feeling and atmosphere, and there’s very little direct translation. You have to fully connect with the author to be able to reliably translate their work; if I weren’t her friend, I would have refused. It’s more than just translating words, even more so than novels. And you have to capture the same impact, somehow, and . . . I don’t know. It’s — it’s hard, especially for me, to translate someone else’s feelings. Honestly, I sometimes struggle to enjoy poetry on its own, because I so often don’t understand what’s being said. Even if, in theory, the information is all there, I just . . . can’t. I can’t see what it means.”
“Leave?” he echos, adrenaline still coursing through him. “What do you mean?”
Sam reddens.
“We were
“Sorry. That’s actually not really sexy, is it? I just – I don’t know, it – it seemed like a good idea. Probably should have saved it for another time, huh?”
“It’s covered in scars.” He glances over the rest of the council. “And I don’t mean tiny scratches. His father
Charlie beams, squeezing Cas’s knee.
Sam doesn’t think so, and after a moment, neither does Charlie, and even if Dean sulks for a few minutes afterward—
“I’ll put my nightgown on,” he answers quietly, though he’s already following lonely thoughts into the next day, and the day after, and so on, to waking up and coming home and having no choice but to wait.
Well, Cas scent-bonded to

“Yeah. A lot.”

“I know that wasn’t his fault. He didn’t know how I felt.”
This? This is definitely awkward.
“Well, what’s to stop me from doing nothing and collecting from Crowley?”
Once they’ve mounted and Dean’s affixed the basket to the saddle as best he can, he leads them well past their usual practice ground, up the sloping hill toward the mouth of the woods. The path forks, and they take a left, heading for a cool place to the West with a sort of partial cliff that has a great view of the city and the horizon.
“Uh. No one. I just mean — hypothetically. I don’t think my dad or the council would let me, but — if they did. Do you think I would be?”
follow you.”
“No, but that’s not that weird. Dean doesn’t talk about things he has—" Sam airquotes “’feelings’ about. But I can tell.”
Dean laughs, ducking his head to kiss him.
“Yes,” he murmurs. “I am your lover.”
Eventually, Cas pushes up on one elbow, turning to look at him with raised brows.
It feels rather awkward.
“Oh. Uh – yeah. That – that, too.”
sure he’s not allowed to kiss Dean, but over the next several weeks, Cas begins to think about kissing Dean twenty or thirty times a day.
“Good,” he lies, toeing the line of tile grout in front of him. “Yours?”
“Oh.”
“Would you like some tea?” Cas continues, gesturing vaguely toward the door. “Though — you’ll have to wait, while I make it — assuming you don’t need to leave right away—”
“It’s not about that,” Dean says carefully. “We talked about this, Cas. Your feelings are all tangled up in — in all the other stuff.”
“Uh-huh. What about everyone else?”
“Yeah, I did,” Dean says easily. “I’m, uh, not a fan of dock grime.”
He contents himself with admiring what’s on Dean’s plate; the lattice crust with the leaf cutouts Dean laid out last night baked beautifully.
“How old are you?” she asks, curious, then adds, wry, “How bad should I feel right now?”
Cas pulls back at that, frowning heavily.

“It might kill
“Dear Castiel, who art about to be in Heaven,” he starts, uncapping the bottle with a wink. “Hallowed be thy name . . .”
Dean’s usually hormonal enough on his rut; the last thing he wants is to spend several days holed up in a room having someone stare at him with their dead, emotionless eyes until he starts crying.
Cas tightens his grip, staring hard.
“It will be an

Cas just rolls his eyes.
She stops, staring.

Cas nods.
“So . . . we should keep it to your room.”
He doesn’t.
“Um.”
They watch the sharks for a full twenty-five minutes, and Cas doesn’t let go of his arm once, as if that’s the only thing keeping him from crawling into the tank to join them.
“You’re not seriously
Cas smiles down at the reins.
“Ah.” He takes the opportunity to finish his beer in a few big, desperate gulps.
“And maybe you are, but you’re kind of starting to sound a teeny bit, uh . . .”
“What was Rachel talking about, anyway? Speaking of history.”
(Unlike Anna, Cas already knows where he stands, and he knows that Dean is potentially in the capital as they speak, working to give him what he’s able. Cas isn’t going to shame those efforts by asking for more.)
“You cause a fuss
And certainly, it’s true that Dean should probably devote himself to more productive pastimes, but still; Cas didn’t need to tell him everything
He squints. Ever since he started work at the river docks, people at both Mills Park and outside it seem to have taken it as their cue to begin speaking to him; if he spoke about it to as many people as seem to want to

Did he? Clearly, it’s a serious problem — was he really so cavalier about it?
“You make it sound like we’re a lawless wasteland. Yes, there are violations, but they’re going to happen regardless of what we do, and we have much bigger priorities. Reasonable protections have been put into the laws, and it’s the duty of local enforcement to uphold them. They may not always succeed, but that is beyond their control.”
After a moment’s pause, Dean sidesteps him to pull a glass out of the cupboard.
“Yeah, well, you’re still young.”
Cas has learned to like surprises, but he also loves knowing what’s going to happen, especially when what’s going to happen is so very, very
They sit in silence for several moments, Cas trying to process the presence of his worst nightmare in the parlor downstairs, wanting to take heart in her supposed disinterest but not foolish enough to imagine it really matters any more than Dean’s, and more than ever, he wishes Max was right, for both their sake’s.
“How?” he asks, gruff voice suddenly soft, and Dean’s stomach flips over.

can’t get in trouble just for suggestion
Regrettably, Cas is forced to ruin it.
If Dean were still a nerdy fifteen-year-old, he’d probably bring Cas to The Rookery, but Eileen’s comic-shop/cafe/lounge (technically half-owned by Charlie) would probably be at best
Balthazar is warm and smiling and smells faintly of spiced vanilla, a scent artificial enough that Cas decides he must wear perfume like the Lettrans, and it’s not as unpleasant as Cas was expecting. He startles a little when Balthazar smoothes a hand across his hair before gently tilting Cas’s head, tongue flicking out against his lips, but it’s not invasive, like it was with April. It’s dissimilar from what April did entirely, to Cas’s relief, and some of the tension leaves him as he tries to mirror the movements, parting his lips the way he’s pretty sure he’s supposed to and tentatively licking forward.
Dean. As you said, it’s — it’s fine, it doesn’t matter, you made your choice—”
“Of course.” Sam hesitates. “And you? How are you holding up?”
“My sister. My
As it is, he wakes early, anticipation instant and nearly overwhelming, and he startles Lucy very badly when he immediately heads downstairs to prepare his coffee. She’s feeding Katherine, wet food on the tip of her finger and a lone candle flickering a few feet away in its holder, and she nearly knocks it over when he bids her good morning.
Surprisingly, Cas doesn’t say a word. In fact, when Dean gives in and meets his eyes as he puts the plate back down, Cas is giving him this soft, vaguely hopeful look, mouth upturned slightly.
You’re the one who—”
There’s unison swearing.
“Oh? Do you still do that?”
“I met Castiel when he saved my sister.” He pauses, then lifts his chin. “And I saw his true value as a

“Of course I do,” Cas snaps, cheeks hot. “In a perfect world Claire would divide the next three days between my mother’s and her friends’ so I could go through several
none of them are all that crappy.”
Still, Cas keeps catching his thoughts drifting to Dean’s mouth as he makes his way up the stairs. How it looks in a frown, like earlier, how much he loves it in a smile. How it catches between his teeth sometimes, when he’s thinking, or how he wets it when it’s dry, tongue sweeping across the soft-looking skin.
“I — I guess, but I’m not sure—“
“Jo,” Dean starts. “Have you ever . . . uh. Dated someone? That you wanted to throw down with but didn’t wanna throw down with you?”
” Bobby continued emphatically. “Remember what I said. It don’t change anything, and it don’t mean you two can’t still be friends.”
“Just — just — what the

Dean hasn’t texted Cas in three days, even though he’s spent exactly that much time
Dean turns, frowning.
“Yeah. It, uh. Remember — I made that bracelet? And I gave it to you?”
“Sorry, sorry, you’re right. Thank you for, uh, not doing that. Here, I’ll help you get dressed.”
He frowns. She has a point. And it’s not like it was a
Cas does his best to swallow his disappointment.
“I guess I won’t know until I’m — what did you say? Done here.”
Baffled and more than a little apprehensive, he approaches it, and after a quick disturbance of the pillows turns up nothing, he realizes where it must then be originating. With a frown, he lowers himself, sitting back on his haunches and lifting the bedskirt, light from the room flooding the space underneath.

“He could hurt one of them!”
“I . . . don’t want to bother you.”
Dean. If you — if you do that to me, I swear to God, I’ll—"
Cas handles his business as quickly as possible, for once grateful to be a man. It’s hard to imagine feeling
. . .
“Please? I – I have food.”
“I forgot socks.”
It’s said quietly, subdued, and it leaves a foul taste in Dean’s mouth.
“Uh. Yes. That’s . . . also correct.”
“Yes. I would never make you kiss me. Though — even if you wanted ten years to decide, Dean — I’ll always want to kiss you.”
“Full of shit?” Dean supplies. “That a family trait, then?”

“You said ‘cool.’ I was agreeing.”
“Indeed,” he mutters. The sick feeling from last night has lessened somewhat, but it still hasn’t gone away, and every time he thinks of the proclamations, it just gets worse again.
Dean huffs and lunges forward to grab his shoulder.
Dean’s not really sure why he thought it made him special.
He’s almost disappointed when his scrutiny is interrupted by Cas pulling on pajamas, but then he reminds himself to be grateful Cas has decided to
“Yeah, well, too bad you’re not the heir, Sam.”
Because Cas is here, is well-fed and getting plenty of sleep, and that distance isn’t actually twenty miles, and someday, somehow, things will surely go back to some kind of normal.
his hands, flexing beneath his grip with every sharp thrust forward, Cas frantically pulling Dean into him in an effort to make him do it harder,
“What?”
Dean licks his lips, shifting a little further up Cas’s back, and spreads his fingers slightly, tentatively stretching.
“I don’t think you want to know, Anna.”
“You’re not hiding anything, are you, Cas? Such as, perhaps, that he already rejected you?”
“Fine, compromise. I’ll take fries and onion rings. Vegetables, right, Clarence?” she teases, and he doesn’t bother arguing, since he knows it’s a joke.
“Hey — try not to worry?”
“Mm, and you know, you’d be right — except you’re forgetting that
But eventually, someone did.
Cas grits his teeth, shoving off the blanket and shifting toward the edge of the bed.
Cas’s fault. Maybe there’s something he’s doing, or failing to do, that’s causing Claire to have problems. Maybe he deserves to have someone yell at him, to demand better from him.
She cocks her head.

He doesn’t know what it means, knows it probably doesn’t mean
It’s peculiar, Cas thinks, speechless. There’s rage, distinct and plenty, though that is hardly a surprise (mostly, it’s Dean’s

Cas swallows.
you to kiss him! How can any man with a conscience decline at least that much, under the circumstances?”
“I lost an afternoon of study time.”
Cas throws his hands up.
“Are you okay with that?”
“Yeah. But — I thought maybe I’d read for a little bit.”
But Dean did come back. Cas was too busy chasing the finish line, frustratingly close to the edge but still bogged down by jittery nerves he couldn’t even begin to explain, and didn’t hear the sound of keys in the lock.
He understands, though. Cas is at that age, and even if he knows he’s not ready, there’s a part of him that’ll still want to get out there and fight the way he’s always wanted to.
Charlie sighs.
Which is a shame, because they both do such wonderful work on beha—"
“Why would I not want to?”
to contemplate, given Dean’s reluctance to go to a store or order anything off the internet, but then Dean’s hand pushes at his thigh, prompting him to spread his legs a little wider as Dean lowers himself forward, pressing along Cas’s back, and
“Yes.” Cas smiles. “She ended up back here, too, though.”
No matter how lonely he was — not once did he think of mates.
“Of course, we already established that I like looking at you,” Dean continues, cupping the back of Cas’s knee as he moves the cloth over his calf. “And that I think your scent is fucking
All penises are not the same, Cas has learned. He would have assumed they didn’t vary much, but overheard conversations in the barracks and bath house would suggest they absolutely do, and that variety is a point of contention among his fellows.
stamina. Anyway, you seemed fine.”
“Hey.” Dean’s hand is back on his face, gentle on his cheek. “I know that – it’s hard to change the way you think, once somebody’s got you convinced. I don’t expect you to be able to do it overnight. But I mean it, Cas. You’ve got nothing but good things to offer somebody, and whether you find your footing with the whole kissing thing or not, you’re gonna be irresistible.”
“No,” he says slowly. “I’m going home after school.”
“When Anna went abroad.” Dean’s eyes are still trained on the TV, arms folded, though Cas can tell he’s not really seeing it. “When you said she was the only person who loved you.”
“The fuck? What are you — dude, what the hell have people been feeding you?”
“I don’t know. I still think you were too easy on him,” Anna interjects, then adds under her breath, “But then, you always were too quick to forgive.”
Of course, as tends to be his luck, the bath buckets are missing.
Cas squints.
Chapter warnings: discussion of past overdose, unhealthy coping mechanisms (alcohol), dubiously consensual kissing, discussions of how feelings factor into sex (details in the end notes), Cas disliking yellow beetles. Please let me know if I missed anything.
“But your rut—"
Cas likes how that looks on him.
to hurry, so … you must, uh. Must really like to take your time, huh?”
“Such things are no laughing matter, Walker.”
“Morning, Cas,” he says, letting his fingers rest. “Happy Birthday.”
Cas wants to argue, but Dean’s already upset this morning, which doesn’t bode well for his joke, so he reluctantly cleans his plate, wincing every time he bites into a carrot.
Dean shudders, head dropping, and after a moment, during which Cas worries he needs
“They were delicious,” Max sighs. “I tried my father’s whiskey once when I was younger, and it was
Yes, you
Ellen’s looking at him.
The moment returns, with unwelcome clarity, and Cas can’t stop his face from heating.
” Cas snaps, and
Cas nods.
“What?” he finally asks, wary, and Dean’s face softens.
Dean stares, dumbfounded. It’s not that he doesn’t like that idea – on the fucking contrary – but that seems way too skewed in his favor. Not only does he get to have Cas squirming on his fingers, Cas is proposing he gets Cas’s mouth on his dick, too, and that’s just -
trying to make him feel good, not at all. No, Dean was just being a fucking
There’s no resistance, though Cas breathes in deeply, eyes falling shut; he simply lies there and lets Dean move him as he pleases, and good God, but Dean is pleased. He can’t help but tighten his grip on Cas’s legs a little, push them apart just that tiny bit more, leaving Cas utterly exposed to him and one of the most beautiful things Dean has ever had the privilege of witnessing.
He watches Cas carefully, and though Cas is busy wrestling the lid off the snapware, he must sense Dean’s eyes on him.
She’s silent for a long, long moment, just looking at him.
Cas sighs, resisting the urge to reach for himself.
“Uh. Yef?” she says, and then swallows.
“As if your honor could be threatened by him,” Cas scoffs. “But he wanted you to — the idea is
“You’re thinking very loudly,” Cas mumbles, shifting more snugly against Dean’s side as he props his chin on Dean’s chest, squinting sleepily. “Would you like me to distract you?”
“Still.” Cas takes a deep breath. “That’s what I’d think about it. When I was lying there, alone. Feeling — separate, somehow. Wishing I could . . . wishing I had what my brother had. I thought about you.”
He nods, relieved, though he still feels bad.
“Dude, I don’t hook up with parents. Or guardians.”
just excuses.
Sam shrugs, and they step apart.
“If she killed him, there’d be no deal with Lawrence.”
Cas sinks forward a little, hand circling as he hollows his cheeks and tilts his head, lets Dean’s cock push against the soft, wet inside of his cheek, and against his arms, he feels Dean’s thighs quiver.
Mr. Wilkins just laughs harder, and Cas reluctantly smiles.
Anyway, Cas clearly has zero fucking clue about what constitutes ‘good manners’ in a relationship, and after sliding his stupid warm hands all over Dean’s body to check for tender spots and kissing halfway down it in pursuit of the same, he evidently decides that’s enough torture for one night and pulls away.
“She’s — you call her the Dungeon Master?”
He clears his throat, palms clammy where they rest atop his knees as Cas slows down, approaching him with dark eyes.
If a piece of meat were that noisy, you’d still be hunting it.
Dean stumbles out of bed and dresses as quietly as possible, thoughts racing with all the horrifying possibilities of what he might have done — might have
“That’s a good idea,” he makes himself say. “Have you been in contact with him?”
“This is a little different, man. King’s orders. Nobody’s coming up with me, except a small guard.”
“I’m not gonna apologize for being friendly with a stranger.”
Which, even if Cas is pissed, he’s technically let Dean get away with all kinds of bullshit, in terms of hand-washing and frozen books and delivery-acceptance-prevention, but this is – like – come
Cas met the woman once, but he’s so upset right now he experiences a stab of resentment that someone as undeserving as Dean has such easy access to her company. He stalks back to his horse without responding, swinging himself up with so much force he nearly goes right over, and behind him, he swears he hears Dean snort. Cas resists the impulse to turn around and glare at him.
Cas tries not to cling harder.
he sees there, and tries to convey just how badly he doesn’t want things to be like this. “So just — come with me? And then — and then we can figure it out there.”
“Morning,” he says shortly, closing his eyes as he sips from the mug. When he opens them again, he holds it out to Dean. “Coffee?”
John nods.
Dean huffed.
“If I’m going to be sleeping next to you, I can,” he shoots back, and Cas blinks.
But take it back, I wanna do the rest.”
“Treat you like what, now?”
But if he’s being honest, Cas hasn’t had a night out in more like
Claire frowns.
“I’m not kidding, man. Door. Now.”
“Fuck, fuck,
Cas groans, hand tightening around Dean’s as he tugs him forward.
“She was giving up, when we moved here,” Cas presses. “I didn’t — I had no idea how to help her. But you did. And last week — what she said to me last week — she — she’s
“Uh. Thank you.”
He pauses, and Cas snorts.
So wonder he does, from the time he gets home at seven and fixes dinner he’s pretty sure only he’ll be eating, and straight through the agonizing minutes of three episodes of some mediocre SyFy original, pretty sure he’s wondering for nothing, because let’s be real; the
“Sure, um, knock yourself out.”
this is like, the greatest thi-heyyy, wait a minute.” He turns toward the living room, frowning. Cas’s pencil has stopped moving. “No, it isn’t.”
“A lot of these were for actual clothing,” she explains, “But I thought you might want to treat yourself to some new drawers, so a few of them might work well for nightgowns. Bring that eggshell cotton, Dean,” she instructs, and Dean gives the pile on the floor a helpless look.
excited; to the best of his knowledge, even Sam had not been allowed this honor, because this was Dean’s special, personal space, made just for him, and that standard had been sternly maintained without exception. But for the first time, someone who was not Dean — someone who was as undistinguished and surely unworthy as
like the first time, giddiness and high hopes eclipsing nearly everything else, but — it’s still remarkable. and he clears his throat when he’s carefully arranged the skirts, nervously awaiting judgment.
Dean burrows back in, brain lazily soaking in all kinds of
“Is that a problem?”
how it was.
“That’s not — we didn’t — damn it, Cas, say something!” After all, Cas certainly had plenty to say the one time
“Mm.” She grins. “Feels good, too.”
True to his word, Dean doesn’t hold Cas’s hand or kiss him again, but Cas finds he very much enjoys the day, anyway. He’d enjoyed coming through town with Sam and Charlie the first time, and with Dean in tow, today is even better.
“Fine,” he mutters tersely. “Knock yourself out, if you think it’ll help.”
She smells like strawberries, which is not unpleasant, but she’s also several inches shorter than him, and he decides he definitely doesn’t love the gap. When he kisses Dean, he just has to tilt his head (and maybe push up on his toes a fraction, if he feels inclined), and Dean meets him halfway.
Dean blows out a breath, brow creasing.
He can see how, after some dinner and a nap, Cas is in the just-kind-of-sad place, where a little self-love might give him another boost.
By the time Dean’s worked across his shoulders, dipping along the blades and down over his lats, Cas is utterly boneless, torn between drifting away on a cloud of bliss and feeling trapped in a special hell tailored just for him. Every time Dean’s hands perform some magical combination of movement and pressure, Cas can feel one kind of tension loosening and another kind building to an alarming degree, hot and demanding and so very aware of the way Dean’s skin feels against his, that thin, slippery layer of oil the only barrier between them.
“Dude, I just did darks,” Dean grouses, pointing to Cas’s pajamas. “I could have put those in with the rest.”
“You see? I think you’re the only person to ever feel that way about me, undeserved though it may have been.”
“You’re being singularly unhelpful,” Cas says reproachfully, and she grins.
” he says. “We’re — shit, boyfriends or whatever, right? ‘Cause listen, I’ve learned my lesson, and I
“Alright, that should be good,” Dean mumbles, shifting a little behind Cas, and Cas bites back a whimper as he pushes forward, sliding up Cas just enough to turn on the tap. “Rinse.”
“Jo.”
“We did. And then — I don’t know. I just — I just don’t want him to feel sorry for me. That’s a shitty reason to — do stuff. And when that’s the reason, you’re going to get tired of doing it, aren’t you? And then you’ll want out.”
“I had to
Cas frowns.
Cas shudders, hips twitching up as he throbs around Dean, desperate for a return to movement.
“Cas-”
At least, that’s how he is when Dean wakes up. Dean watches him for a moment, blinking sleepily at the soft rise and fall of his back and vaguely marveling at the fact that he’s still asleep. Despite the weirdly relaxed atmosphere before bed — probably explained by the whole hey-we’re-not-gonna-have-dubiously-consensual-sex-tonight-after-all thing — Dean expected to lie there in awkward silence for a while before anyone actually managed sleep.
Cas frowns.
He can’t, so he stays quiet.
Obviously, if Dad says no, he says no, but — it feels like it’s been a hundred fucking years since he saw Cas.
And this time he’s not being sarcastic, and Dean’s suddenly
, so — so Cas came down, and I left with him the next morning and we just . . . hung out. It was nice.”
Dean crowds in a little closer, touch firming, thumb stroking across the soft skin beneath Cas’s eye, and Cas leans into him, deeply comforted.
She could have abandoned him
Which is a whole
It’s not funny, damn it. Cas is going
He sniffs and hugs her tighter, too overwhelmed to form the words.
Everyone stops what they’re doing to look at him.
“First of all, Cas is like my brother. We talk, obviously. Second of all, you’re clearly upset about this. Why
trying, Cas. And that makes it a lot less terrifying, for me.” Dean shuffles a little closer, watching him carefully. “Since we met - every single time I wasn’t enough, Cas — you stepped in. And I made it through. And I know — I don’t expect it to be the same for you, but — I
“I think?”
“One of them.” Lucy shifts, settling criss-cross with a sigh, her eyes returning to Katherine. “There’s another in a few days, though.”
“Um. Yes. Yes, everything is good, Dean.”
“Jesus Christ,” Dean breathes out, chest heaving, and Cas ignores the little thrill that courses through him at the utterance.
Cas closes his eyes, telling himself he’s relieved.
“Actually, we bring him here at Castiel’s request.”
“Yeah, uh, you didn’t hear me knock,” he lies.
Claire lets out a loud sniff, pressing her sleeve to her eyes, and darts out of the room before Cas can ask her to elaborate on
he, Dean? What if he
He cannot even begin to fathom what Dean needs, even though it’s abundantly clear to Cas that he’s failing to provide it. It’s been that way for years, and while Cas would be eternally grateful to Pamela if Dean somehow learns to just
And then he suddenly reaches out, gripping the front of Cas’s waistcoat, and presses in for a hard, thorough kiss that has Cas’s entire body lighting up with pleasure.
“Okay. Then . . . I’m gonna.”
Cas is willing to wait, apparently, and Dean sighs, selfishly glad Cas can’t see his face.
you.”
Cas waits as long as he feels is reasonable before he gives into Sam’s worried looks and prepares his own plate, deciding he’ll have to find Dean after he eats.
“Still, I know I’ve been – I’ve had a difficult time, recently, and you – you’ve been trying to take care of me, but – what we’ve been doing is – it’s asking a lot from you.”
You think we can be
Daphne hesitates, then finally meets his eye.
“No. No, I — I appreciate that you thought you wanted to court me. That was flattering. I’m — well, I’m hardly a very appealing omega, and apparently I’m grumpy, and as we’ve discussed, I turned out to be very shameless.”
which — it makes Cas feel
“I tell awesome jokes, too.”
“How could he

Cas lifts his brows, tilting his head.

“So . . . you haven’t been with anyone in . . .”
Strangely, Claire looks away, fidgeting with the comforter a little.
Dean lifts a brow, though actually, Cas does look kind of relieved
Dean huffs and kisses him, the sort of kiss that simultaneously appeases and incites the itch beneath his skin, and to Cas’s disappointment, remains firm on his stance of ‘no sex in a moving carriage.’
“So he acknowledged I may not enjoy it.”
“Right. Yeah, that’s — that’s why.” He clears his throat. “You must miss Dean, too, then.”
in tow, you have no room to talk, Dean.”
Cas cants his head.
Dean swallows, and this time, simply nods.

“Sometime in high school, maybe.” Definitely in high school. Cas can narrow it down to a pivotal moment at a birthday party toward the end of senior year, a deeply painful moment Dean probably barely even remembers but dictated the course of Cas’s personal growth from there on out.
“It’s fine,” he says lightly. “Honestly, that wasn’t an excuse, either way.”
And yet, that was a lot of judgment, and — and
Oh, God. He was — he was an
Cas’s chewing slows, granola instantly less dense in his stomach.
“It’s not like
the last time you bedded someone?”
“I—" Cas hesitates, unsure. “I don’t give either much thought.”
“I don’t
“I don’t.”
The pair of them settle down, eventually, trailing off into snickers before going quiet.
Cas is silent, breathing against him, but doesn’t move.
Cas knew, even before the ensuing conversation confirmed it, that she was talking about Dean.
She looks unimpressed.
He laughs, because there’s never a point to withholding his laughter from Claire, even if she doesn’t feel the same.
“That’s terrible.”
, doesn’t seem to remember what’s happened every other time they’ve been in this position — doesn’t give Cas’s dick a second glance as he drags the pair free, its Arbor Day print’s suggestive puns promptly balled into unrecognizable nonsense as Dean casts them aside.

Dean nods.
“Right.” Dean sniffs. “He just . . . look, he
Smth? And of
“Hell if I know.”
“Sex,” Cas repeats, pointedly wriggling against his finger. “I want your body to stimulate mine until I come.”
“Yeah, buddy, ‘cause instead of eating what’s on my plate, I kinda wanna throw you on the bed, roll you over, and eat
He’s not sure how he answers, but the next thing he knows, Meg has a hold of his hand and is guiding him to a bedroom. Cas is worried for a moment, because he knows what happens in spare rooms at parties, and he tries to find the right words to explain what he doesn’t want.
“Oh, for God’s sake,” she mutters. “You’re as much trouble as she said. We need to leave Lawrence, Castiel. I will be happy to tell you more once we are on our way, but for right now, I would very much appreciate it if you
take Dean in any further, the pressure as he wiggles up against him turns out to be
“I got up too fast,” Dean mutters. “I guess I wanted to hurry up and get it over with before somebody insisted on holding my goddamn hand while I tried to take a shit.”
After his overdose, Cas made some new rules for himself.
“Yes. Damn it, yes, you
“About
“Whoever’s closest,” Dean answers honestly, since that’s how it always is. It’s been years since he’s had anything like a steady partner, and the New Year’s kisses are fun
The car lurches back in motion, Dean smoothly rejoining traffic.
Dean rides too fast today, leading them up to the forest and winding recklessly through the trees. Cas only barely manages to keep up, and when Dean stops to rest his horse next to an unfamiliar stream, Cas gathers his nerve. The only thing he can do, he’s decided, is
this. For everyone.”
“Or that you wanted me to take him out for some exercise, because you
Dean’s jaw goes slack, and he stares.
Dean’s face is turning red, whether from the cold or embarrassment, Cas can’t be sure.
Bela shrugs.
Impossibly, Dean thinks he might feel even worse than he did the first time, when the haze of rut had cleared and he woke to an empty bed and panicked so badly he went straight to work and didn’t come back until Cas had already gone to sleep.

“Why didn’t anyone tell me?” Cas demands, and Dean shrugs, scratching his head.
Cas, for his part, has been standing by himself for just as long, contemplating his ignorance of what the phrase ‘can’t wait’ means; the fact that Dean has yet to so much as make eye contact suggests he does not, in fact, know.
of it. Really, it’s all Cas’s fault for just assuming Dean knew what was going on and — and . . .
him in that moment.
Snagging a towel off the rack, Dean starts drying himself off as best he can and shoves open the door to escape before Cas can try to talk him into anything stupid.
Dean nods.
A moment later, the other edge lifts, Dean ducking down to look at him.
Dean stops trying to scramble to the other side of the bed, the mattress stilling.
Dean feels sick.
But wait, a sliver of a thought protests weakly. Dean doesn’t remember taking anyone back to his room. Cas was supposed to stay in here last night.
Claire just — stares.
“What?”
of arousal, Dean’s and his both, and unlike the other day, Dean can scent
“No, no, I mean — I like to bed women.”
“Well, eat up.”
Cas instinctively opens his arms.
Cas nodded, glancing away with a huff of laughter.
“Can you—" he pants, forcefully tugging them to his head. “Do you mind—"

“Oh. Okay.” She glances down, and then quickly leans back. “Sorry, Mr. W.”
“Has he?” he asks them, which is just
“I take back what I said about missing you.”
“Dude,” Dean splutters. “I’m
Dean almost feels like he’s fourteen and newly-presented again, suddenly aware that hormones are a thing and high-key panicking over it.
“You can’t
” he says again. Still, Sam frowns, opening his mouth.
He feels Dean nod.
“Ah. I’m really sorry to hear that,” he says quietly, eyes sad, and Cas can tell he means it. “How long were you together? Or, uh, maybe not — ‘cause Claire said — but, uh, obviously, you . . .”
Even if Cas
Adam makes a humming noise.
“I think that’s easier said than done,” Cas answers honestly, and Dean gives him a frustrated look.
“Not necessarily. He could be somewhere on the spectrum. He just — doesn’t trust my motives.”
think this has anything to do with you?”
Dean swallow behind him.
“Hey - you okay?” he asks, and since it sounds like a normal, friendly question and not an accusation of disease, Cas appreciates his concern.
Dean’s bright red now, not making eye contact with anybody, but Cas thinks he looks — pleased.
He’s tried to shake it off, tell himself that his thing with Cas is nobody’s business but his own, that Sam’s a big boy who can handle himself, and Cas’ll take care of Claire.
“Uh, yeah?” He hears Dean sniff. “Usually does.”
of them. I don’t think anyone would.”
Sam coughs, ears a little red, and Cas looks down, inspecting his plate.
Garth gives them both a hug on their way out, and doesn’t seem to notice that Dean doesn’t hug back.
“How was the sleepover?” he asks her, once they’ve said goodbye to Patience and Mr. Turner and left.
“Thank you, Dean,” he says warmly, torn between pity and perverse pleasure at Dean’s discomfort, and neatly takes the spot, pressing right up against Dean and leaving a good four inches on the end of the bench.
It’s a couple of minutes before Dean replies, and Cas realizes belatedly that that sounded like flirting. Which wasn’t his intention, of course, because even if Dean wants to be his friend, he doesn’t want to see him like
“California,” he scoffed, shaking his head. “Kid always thought he was better than us.”
. That thing that he had? That awesome, wonderful, perfect, sometimes-a-dick-but-mostly-just-sweet, way-better-than-pie thing he had?
“Hellenia.”
“Oh, please, like you don’t know. Could listen to you talk all day.” Dean suddenly goes still. “I mean, if you weren’t – you know, you. And I weren’t - me. You know?”
Dean’s had a decade of very thorough practice, and he
“You didn’t initiate.”
Valencia pulls a letter out of her pocket and smiles.
Cas turns to the woman who just sat down next to him, startled.
Cas thinks his eyes look a little red.
“Ooh, I think she likes it!”
“Well, she didn’t want to interrupt!”
“Sure,” Cas says. He doesn’t
“Right, which is exactly why I spent months figuring out how to steal that bloody painting. You’re clearly not as clever as I gave you credit for, if you think Hess thought running away to
And then he narrows his eyes.
He waits until he hears Cas get in the water, taking a deep breath before he turns.
“Ten minutes,” Cas mumbles, nosing behind Dean’s ear. He has on some kind of unexpectedly appealing cologne, and Cas discreetly breathes it in, an odd but not unpleasant combination of comforted and turned on. “She was very nice about it, though.”

“We don’t have to go to the store,” he says carefully. “We can have our groceries delivered. The dried goods can just sit by the door, and we can wipe down anything that needs to go in the fridge or the freezer.”
“Of course.”
“So you think Cas and I aren’t gonna make it.”
“Why do you keep trying to second-guess this?”
“How about later?” Dean suggests, and he has the nerve to sound
This is no way to make anyone fall in love with you, that’s for fucking sure.
“No,” Dean repeats, horrified, and Cas falters.
So he assures himself it’ll be

When he turns back to Dean, he looks strangely defeated.

“Okay, well, when you put it like
“Oh. Thank you, Dean.” Cas blows his nose loudly, and it’s a struggle for Dean not to inch away.
Cas feels much, much worse than he did last night — and judging by the queasiness in Sam’s face and his bloodshot eyes, he’s in the same boat — but a part of him still thinks it would be fun to do it again sometime.
“But it
Cas frowns.
“Stop this. Now,” he commands, and she narrows her eyes.
what’s what!”
Cas swallows, eyes wide and hat askew.
He keeps his eyes on the road, but he can tell by the slight shift in his peripheral that Cas is giving him the sad eyes. Thank God he’s driving, because Cas’s are almost as bad as Sammy’s.
He shuts the door behind them, locking it, and when he turns around again, Dean is just looking at him, eyes soft and sad and somehow too much for Cas’s heart to take.
They all gasp, a small chorus of ‘ooh’s following, and Mr. W turns scarlet, eyes wide.
“What? Why? Do you need different bedding?”
Dean swallows.
He sighs.
It’s not until he’s nearing the end that he realizes his mistake, Michael’s boring recounting of some stupid office story beginning to muddle in his ears as Dean blinks suddenly blurred vision.
Cas nods, still unsure.
In some ways, the partial fullness is
Dean drank himself into a cognitive wasteland and, body reflexive and indiscriminate, tried to kiss Cas.
Cas stubbornly remains still.
‘Weird’ is the last word he’d use to describe it.
“This is super fucking weird,” Dean remarks after a moment, and Cas sighs.
“Yeah, Tara, thanks for asking. How ‘bout you?”
(Not that he doesn’t think about Baby’s backseat sometimes. Just occasionally. But that’s
Dean huffs, angrily turning the laminated page.
“Like that.”
“Anyway,” he says, pushing away the weird, irrational anger. He can tell Sam is working up to a Lecture. “What was up with you at dinner?”
What the hell is he going to do?
“Cas?”
“Alright.”
“We didn’t. We probably should have — I should have done this a long time ago — but, uh. I went to see him for lunch, and he was just — gone.”

“You’re right,” Pamela says, and he looks back at her, dismayed. She holds his gaze. “He does have needs. We

Samandriel blinks.
Dean laughs.
a risk, then how did Dean figure it out with his other partners? And either way, those other partners are miles and miles away, and Cas is really Dean’s only option, and Cas can’t imagine Dean could be
“Like the last night,” he says slowly. “In Lawrence.”
Cas shakes his head.
“Sh, Cas,” an achingly familiar voice says, and Cas sucks in a breath, jerking his head to the side.
“Punk?” Cas asks, amused, although he’s surprised by Dean’s answer, too.
In fact, it’s
Of course, Dean knows Garth isn’t the problem.
Dean blinks, caught off guard by the transition.
“Yeah, he is.”
to do with it. She did tell me, however, to stop thinking about the things I was afraid of and think about the things I’d be giving up.” Cas reaches out, fingers loosely pinching Sam’s tunic sleeve. “You are one of those things, Sam. And I would rather not give you up.”
The walk to the bedroom feels like miles.
And since Dean asked for
“Which one?” he hedges.
Nothing.
“Yeah, he used to do that with me, too. But
She waves him off and answers her call.
Again, Max pauses, uncertain, and Cas clears his throat.
Wasteful, perhaps.
“It might not be him,” he tries, at which point Charlie pokes her head in from the kitchen.

He’s hoping he can talk Dean into more kisses.
“Alright. We’ll take ya to Dean’s room. Let’s get on with it, then.”
Dean swallows.
She’s angry, of course. She hasn’t stopped being angry, not since Lucifer surprised Michael with a rebellion and pride ultimately killed them both, and certainly not since she found out what Bela had done to Cas.

He hustles off with his dish before Cas has to say anything.
Cas looks at it.

Chapter warnings: discussion of various positions/locations for sex, explicit sexual content (scenes marked *** at the beginning and end – it’s kind of the tail end of one scene followed immediately by another scene, sorry - see notes for summary), please let me know if I missed anything.
Cas had mostly settled down from his wreck of a freshman year at college, but with sobriety came a certain awareness of his surroundings, and it did not escape his notice when he started seeing Lisa Braeden around campus.
Dean quickly shakes away thoughts of tiny print on screens, glancing down to find Cas frowning at the television, and he follows his gaze, trying to figure out what he missed. As far as he can tell, a bunch of the main characters are just gossiping at the bar table in what is
Even his mouth, grim and angry, is stealing Cas’s breath.

“What is it?”
“No kidding, Kate. We’re lucky I was wearing layers, that shit’s still
Cas tries not to look too relieved.
Cas thinks, eyes pricking with tears.
But Charlie is already gone.
to, at any rate, because then Dean is leaning back in, hands slipping down to Cas’s shoulders to pull at him, and Cas awkwardly scrambles forward on the bed to bring himself closer.
“You sure? You seemed a little tense, this morning.”
“Uh.”
“You do,” Kevin says, then hastily adds, “But if you don’t want to talk about it, that’s okay.”
“How is an — ass — extremely appealing? It’s just — well, it’s a butt, Meg.”
And even if that all adds up to
After all, Dean’s pretty much the same way.
They’re quiet for another moment, and then they head for the dining room.
“Yeah, well no one’s dying right now and it’s not stopping you from saying what’s on your mind. Which is it, Castiel?” he asks, mocking. “Are you a shy, scared little omega or can you hold your own just fucking fine?”
“So, what are you working on in your classes?”
“You slept late? You’re usually up way before me. And besides — you look less tired.”
people, in bed or out of it, and given that he is neither a vampire or a zombie or even just a possessive, territorial sort of lover, why
“Yeah?”
Dean frowns at him.
Bela pauses, and then glances toward Cas with a savage smile.
Cas cocks his head.
“Perfect,” he confirms. “Can I?”
The round goes to a duly smug Krissy, and Kate sets down her cards with a hum.
“Well, I wouldn’t worry about that, but wherever you’re most comfortable is good with us, Cas.”
Dean wishes him happy times and then practically destroys the phone trying to get a text off to Cas.
“That seems like a cheap justification,” he says honestly, and then he can’t help but think of Anna’s letter. “You make it sound like Winchester was morally in the right, but — the girls you take are as innocent as the ones you supposedly wanted to defend. I don’t — I don’t understand how they thought that could fix anything.”
“Because you
She glares.
She sobers.
“How is everybody?”
It’s then that Cas realizes, despite Dean’s proximity and wandering hands, the morning situation is completely gone.
“I’m not enough,” Dean insists, and even he looks hurt. “I — I wish I could be, but I’m not, and even if I were, that’s not the life you deserve. If I thought that would be fair to you, trust me, we’d have a lot more options, but that — locking you away, with nothing else but me — that’s not right. And as hard as it will be, if the only way we get to be together is if I marry the princess — we can make that work, if you still want it. But you getting stuck with me, at the Gardens or a cabin in the woods or wherever, without anyone or anything else — that won’t work. It just won’t.”
“But I might go sit in the living room, if that’s okay with your Aunt,” he offers. Said Aunt is drinking her coffee and focused on a laptop while Valencia and an only-slightly-more-normal Sam prepare breakfast, but Claire nods eagerly.
Cas narrows his eyes.
Cas stares, stunned.
“It’s a mixtape?” he asks, staring at it.
Dean blinks.
Anna doesn’t look at him.
“You — when you—"
But then he remembers Cas is perfectly capable of kicking asses on his own, and yeah, it’s probably — somehow — something Dean did.
Dean followed a moment later, standing awkwardly beside him. When he reached to rub the back of his neck, his elbow bumped the ceiling.
and Cas has missed him like a primary limb.
“Good. Let’s read for a bit, okay?”
He doesn’t like the answer he comes up with.
Susan practically trips over the step, crowding in close.
Dean stares.
A chill goes down Dean’s spine as he takes it in, and he stays perfectly still, waiting, but Cas doesn’t move. Whole minutes pass, and Dean would almost swear he wasn’t breathing, even though he knows he’s too far away to tell.
And then she crumples the note up and hurls it into the fire.
“’Dean isn’t the type,’” he muses. “Interesting.”
“Good
Claire looks skeptical.
Cas. His bluntness is kind of a double-edged sword.
He’s just pulling out a clean pair of pajamas when the door opens, and Bela quickly slips into the room, noiselessly shutting the door behind her.
“I can’t
Dean nods.
Dean will really move on. It’s not like he doesn’t want to; it’s not even like he hasn’t
“You’d quarantine with me at your parents’ house?”
“I’ll take whatever you decide to give me, though,” he adds as he passes, and after a moment, Dean follows.
“Maybe I would, but I’m
“Anyway, you didn’t know fuck-all about any of it, since you weren’t allowed in the kitchen when it wasn’t dinner time.”
Dean has a lot of
“I mean
“Is it an apple?” someone asks, and something about the voice gives him pause. “Oh. It looks like an apple. What does it taste like, then?”
Sam stares at the letter Valencia just threw on his empty plate, clearly dismayed.
“Really?” He can hear Dean’s frown. “’Cause I’m gonna try, everything I can, and I’ll be honest, man. I’m gonna be kinda pissed if all we get is a weekend here and there.”
Cas deflates, sniffing at his shoulder.
“Dean. You just said you wanted to marry me.”
weakness.
“I brought him too many honeycakes, maybe, but it’s nothing
Cas glances up, eyeing Dean through his lashes.
“Sure. But that doesn’t really change how she feels about it, does it?” He shakes his head. “I just — I don’t know, man.”
“Likewise,” Cas returns, turning into it, just barely able to catch Dean’s mouth against his own. The angle is terrible, though, and since he’s exhausted, anyway, he resolves to save the making out for later.
He shakes the thought away; he’s sure that, like with training, he will eventually become accustomed to that and think nothing of it at all. Besides, if that is what it takes to grant the young lady asylum — well, then Cas will address Dean while he's in the bath, after all.
Dean just laughs.
At last, Dean looks up, eyes pleading.
“Uh, except you’re telling it
Ellen told him what his body wanted during a heat, gave him that stupid thing that’s still sitting in the corner of the room where it hit the ground, and also told him that when the time came to produce heirs, he would need to do the real thing.
Sam sighs.

” Cas insists. “I can’t — I
“You love me.”
“Anyway, it’s neither here nor there, hon. I’m gonna send for a bath, and then you’re gonna come out to the field, alright?”
“Well, then you’re takin’ a nap after we get you a snack, but — shit. Man, I’m glad to see you.”
Dean grimaces, ducking his chin, hands folding in his lap.
“As were you. You’re a good girl, Max,” he adds quietly. “It was an honor to be brave for you.”
“Your dress looks great,” he says abruptly, and Cas looks shocked. “I — I mean — I — you know, definitely, uh, get the blue one, ‘cause — well, you know, we talked about that, but — this one’s good, too. They’re, uh. They’re all good. ‘Cause - ‘cause they’re on you. And you’re — you know. Good-looking, or whatever.”
I would carry you.”
“It happens,” she says blandly. “You better go change, though.”
“Oh, my,” he says, raising his brows. “Never say you’re already

you?” he breathes, wanting to be sure.
“I like everything you make, Dean,” he says, not a hint of mockery in his words, and Dean swallows hard, because he was trying to dispel the discomfort of the atmosphere, not add a weird charge to it.
Cas hesitates.
He swoops in, an abundance of disconcertingly silky hair brushing against Cas’s face, and hugs him tight.
There’s a small frown, at that, and he blinks back innocently, until finally, she purses her lips.
Part of that potential is the way it
Dean coughs, giving his hand a squeeze and glancing back with a smile.
The guy is an omega — only the second male one Dean’s ever met — and apparently, he’s going to provide Dean’s heirs.
with him?
“Someone else would have had to take my place.”
Sam sighs, launches into a lengthy complaint about his asshole of a boss, whom he tolerates because it’s good experience and also one of the few internships that’s paid, and Dean listens, genuinely sympathetic, because he hates his little brother being so far away and he hates that some douchebag is bossing him around and honestly, it’s just nice to hear his voice and know he’s okay.
“Right. Thanks.”
, than I had imagined.” Her lips quirk up at one corner. “It’s a pleasure, Castiel. And congratulations on your liberation.”
Dean winks, leaning in closer so he can slip an arm around Cas as he retrieves his phone from the bath mat.
He sounds almost — nervous. Cas can’t fathom why.

It sounds — well. Unacceptable, if he’s being honest.
Charlie sighs.
“Finish your bath, Dean.”
Cas just stands there, almost frozen, tips of his fingers pressed to his lips, chasing the memory of something so fleeting he almost wonders if it actually happened. Half of him thinks Dean might come back again, and it’s several minutes before he can bring himself to go back inside.
Dean draws his head back a little, startled by Cas’s sudden vehemence.
Unfortunately, or fortunately, he doesn’t have work the next day, and after lying in bed for some time trying to think of all the

Cas almost drops the plate he’s holding.

“Yeah, Linda — Linda’s cool,” Dean agrees, angling his head slightly, and Cas dips down, Dean’s skin smooth and warm beneath his lips.
Dean doesn’t even remember closing his eyes.
” She slaps a palm across her face. “Ugh, I can’t believe you. I can’t believe
In answer, all Cas can do is nod, and nothing more is said.
“Look, it’s — when you’re young, and you maybe don’t think a lot of yourself, if somebody’s giving you the time of day . . . you kinda think maybe you should just run with it. You, uh, you get too fixated on second-guessing yourself to second-guess

There’s a ghost of a smile on her lips before she turns away.

She smiles.

He looks down again.
Dean gives him a suspicious look. An hour ago, the answer would have been a very firm no, but Dean has literally nothing to do and no one to talk to, and since it seems like Cas’s scent has permeated the whole damn room, anyway—
Dean blinks.
“Oh.”
“I shouldn’t care,” he mumbles, and Dean’s never seen him look so tired.
“Like, ‘don’t beat your wives’ is a pretty good talking point, a lot of guys who don’t beat their wives’ll be happy to throw themselves behind that, but even if the change you’re making is ‘if you’re shitty, you lose privileges,’ sometimes people who aren’t shitty still feel threatened by it. You get a . . .” Dean waves a hand. “’Well, now

“I don’t think so,” she says, quiet. “You better, though.”
“Hers.”
“Ready?” he prompts, and Cas nods.
(Dean used to like that, too, although not as much as he seemed to enjoy doing it to Cas.)
A few minutes later, he feels the bed dip as Cas gets in. There’s a rustle of movement, warmth at his back, and then two fingers touch his cheek.
“I hope so. We don’t do bedroom things and we’re not in love, but I
“Huh. Well. Have you tried looking around? See where he might have stashed the drugs?”
Cas frowns.
For the first time since he got here, he thinks he might have something to look forward to.
Cas tilts his head, puzzled.
“He’ll be twenty in May,” John says tiredly, when Dean tries to argue. “You started riding out pretty much the second you turned fifteen, and you did fine.”
“I don’t-”
Cas scowls.
Which — Dean’s surprised how often he forgets, given that Sam kept pointing it out in his letters. Apparently Dean told Cas a dirty joke that embarrassed Cas so much he wouldn’t even ask what it meant — and if Cas isn’t asking hilariously blunt questions, you
Dean relaxes a little.
“Can I do anything? To make you feel better?” Dean eventually asks, and it’s a totally selfish request, but whatever. Cas’ll understand.
He doesn’t get any kind of answer at all, because Cas has apparently had enough of his bullshit and storms out.
by Dean’s persistent interest in him trying to enforce his opinions about what they do, but he supposes if it makes him happy . . .
And that has never been a thing Cas could bear to ask for — it was difficult enough for him to
“Sorry,” he pauses to say, anyway — perhaps wanting a moment to admire them, as well — and she smiles back.
And then she does explain, answers all the questions he’s been trying to ask everyone else and a lot more questions he didn’t even know to ask.
“Huh,” is all Dean says, however, before he abruptly pivots. “Welp, let’s go.”
“That’s not
It was nothing, compared to this.
“Sure, but he can’t talk to her all
“Don’t get me wrong, your church idea might still end up costing less, but even if we offer to update or repair someone’s secondary estate, I’m guessing that’ll be our best bet for a safe-house candidate.”
“I know. I’m sorry.”
“Don’t let the water run,” she snaps, and he nods dumbly. “Alright. Well, come join us when you’re done with those.”
I’ll — I’ll tell you all about it later!”
“Yeah, yeah. I will.”
Dean pulls back way too soon, and Cas tries to follow, chasing his mouth.
Of course, as soon as the words are out of his mouth, Dean is suddenly strongly put in mind of the scene in
“Good man. Say hi to your sister, for me.”
He can’t read a fucking map to save his life — in his defense, Dean figures Cas maybe hasn’t

Dean nods.

And I was trying to keep track of everything she said, so even though you’d heard it like, five minutes ago, I’d keep turnin' to you and explaining the steps, and you’d listen, all patient, like it was important.” He laughs. “Like I totally knew what I was talking about.”
do something about it — even if he pisses off the whole damn council in the process — it’ll be too late.
“Well — I think you should ask him again.”
The boy bites his lip, at once curious and pained.
“So you’ve said.” He gives her a pointed look. “Anna.”

He vaguely recalls Cas shifting closer, followed by an overwhelming wave of tiredness, but then — nothing.
“Cas. What — what do you think is going to change, if we’re not married?”
because maybe all those creepy randos propositioning him in bars were
He scrambled up the last few rungs of the ladder, and with a reverential awe, began committing every single detail of the cozy space and various knicknacks to memory.
picture it, Cas scaling the six-drawer-high chest and kneeling on the top like a large, sexy cat peering out over its domain from above, but the dresser’s actually kind of short, front to back, and Dean’s pretty sure his knees would go right over — unless he turned sideways, but then the mirror wouldn’t help him, and—
Implied homophobic John: In a flashback, John visits for Dean's 16th birthday. While Dean is off getting pie, he addresses Cas, saying, "I know your type," and indicating that he understands exactly how Cas feels and he disapproves.
Cas wets his lips again.
“I didn’t know there was a greenhouse.”
“Alright. Will someone bring me books, at least?”
He’s just not sure how.
Dean’s expression hardens.
“Please do. Are you re—”
“I thought so, too. You know, the artist — she chooses not to come back. She’s afraid she’ll see them — she’ll
But he
“I guess you’re right.” He glances toward the gate, pensive. “I guess we’re both just . . . stuck here. Waiting.”
“Won’t stop you from trying,” he mutters, finally pulling out a juice box. Why the hell do his sister and best friend stock their fridge and pantry with food designed for
Upon finding out Cas has not actually seen any of the Harry Potter movies — none of his friends are that into the series, and he had to read the books at the library, lest his parents call a priest — Sam insists on watching the first one with him. Using an impressive amount of force for an eleven-year-old, he plants Cas in the center of the sofa while Dean looks on doubtfully from the kitchen.
“Why not?”
He shuffles to the door in silence, and with one last sigh, opens it and steps into the hall, shutting it behind him.
Jesus, all the travel is getting to him.
Dean frowns.
he’ll probably feel differently.
Dean honest-to-God
“Yeah, well, I forgot.”
Cas wouldn’t have said it was clean, at all — he’s starting to think the ‘missing scenes’ are, in fact, scenes of
“Fine. Maybe I am. Cas and I come from a place where ‘fun’ was barely in the lexicon, and certainly not for either one of us. All I know how to
“The, uh. The other bath’s not full, yet.”
Surprisingly, Cas looks down, almost — guilty.
Dean gives the sleeping man a sidelong look, thoughtful. Man or not, it’s kind of hard to believe there was anyone more beautiful than Castiel in the town, even though beauty is one of the things New Eden omegas are known for. In fact, as many people as Dean’s met in his lifetime, Castiel is probably one of the most beautiful among them; if someone tried to say he
All Cas can do is try.
Dean grimaces.
“No, like this,” he told him, voice thin and watery, and there on the shabby little neighborhood playground, seven-year-old Sam Winchester taught Cas how to hug.
Dean looks some terrible combination of furious and devastated.
And suddenly – Dean feels like an
“I am not! I even had a talk with him about how the porn and the heat aid and stuff was all normal and fine and he shouldn’t be embarrassed,” he says, defensive, and Charlie gives him a weird look.
and refusing to answer is in some ways almost as embarrassing as the truth. “I don’t know, our habits were gettin’ more and more different and, uh, last semester before graduation was gonna be stressful for me, so — I just thought it’d be better to get my own place.”
“What’s that mean?”
Cas scowls, but to Dean’s surprise, he quickly plucks it out of the box and thrusts it toward him.
“But . . .”
The words are right, and Claire is halfway through a recoil before she realizes that pretty much nothing else is. Cas seems tired and worn out, and not in a good kind of way — not to mention he’s about fifty times less cheerful than he was last night when he was getting ready.
but he never held any real hope.
Cas absentmindedly locates his own hands on Dean’s shoulders and gently slides them to the back of his neck with a sigh.
“What do you mean by wei—” Cas winces as Dean squeezes his shoulders, stepping closer. “Alright.”
he does know that if he accepts the bond or whatever, he’s going to be sure he means it.
“So. What did you want to talk about?”
Cas doesn’t really know where to begin; it’s hard to figure it out, with the end looming over them like it is.
Cas tenses, suddenly guilty.
“No. And I think you’re lying. I think this is what you
“I — am I not allowed?”
is he going to fix this?
“Oh.” Cas nods slightly, nose brushing Dean’s. “That’s true. I did tell you.”
“Really, man? We’re havin’ a heart to heart and you’re thinkin’ about how ugly that car is?”
Still — in the interests of winning that bet, he convinces himself — he asks Dean about her.
Dean hesitates.
He sinks completely into despair, a numb sort of terror weighting his body down into the reluctantly sympathetic embrace of the sofa cushions, because
in Cas rails against that, at the idea that someone else might have stolen Cas’s place here.
“First of all, Castiel, I may be new to the custom, but I imagine it ceases to be tradition around the time
he’d tried to ask. He’d tried to tell her that it
Dean doesn’t know how to answer that, how to make it better, how to fix it — so he just holds Cas a little tighter and pretends he doesn’t know what choice that leaves him with.
“And d’you think he’d let you sleep in there if he were here right now?”
Cas shrugs, though Bal can’t see him, embarrassment swarming hotly over his skin, his chest tight with disappointment.
you that if Dean doesn’t say he’s in love with you by graduation, you’re out of luck. And unless you changed your mind about sleeping with him, I’m not sure what
“Maybe. But whether you’re twenty-two or fifty, I’m going to be your mother, and just like your hurts are always going to feel like mine — a lot of your mistakes are going to feel like mine, too.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, why
“Exercise would help.”
“You know,” she starts, clearly oblivious to his upset. “You’re just as effective as I was hoping you’d be. But not in the way I thought.”
Cas relaxes, nodding.
And Dean probably
Miss Talbot just crosses her arms and gives her an expectant look, though personally, Cas think she looks a little
” he groans, shutting his eyes again. “Fuck.
“It is. I wouldn’t hate being able to turn into a dragon.”
And then he smiles for some reason.
“Wait — no, that’s not what I—"
“Maybe,” Sam says quickly. “Can you tell me more?”
Cas’s heart faces the very real threat of implosion.
And yet, when he’s saying good night to Cas and Cas is looking at him, eyes full of hunger and expectation and other things that make Dean’s spine tingle and his stomach draw tight? There’s not a damn thing in the world that seems like a good enough reason not to follow Cas inside and spend the rest of the night relearning how he kisses.
Which is weird. Anna calls him cute all the time, and he doesn’t think too much of it.
“Miss Maxwell?”
“Oh.” Cas’s stomach flips pleasantly, pulse stammering in his chest. “Thank you. You, um. You’re beautiful, too. Especially — your freckles stand out, when your cheeks color. It — it’s very becoming, Dean.”
“I’m almost thirty, Dean. And I’ve read about that many pregnancy books. I think it’s unnecessary.”
