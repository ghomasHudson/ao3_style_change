Dean looked down at the bear.
He listened to Cas’ breathing even out, the warm weight of him slowly growing heavier as he sank into sleep.
Dean cleared his throat and discarded all of the snarky responses that had immediately clamored into his brain when Cas had finished speaking. (Seriously, having sarcasm as a reflexive defense mechanism when conversations turned emotional was a royal pain in the ass.)
Dean seemed to take Castiel’s silence as an affirmative answer and reached out to grab some of the offending beef.
Or offered.
They broke apart again several minutes later when the acrid smell of smoke broke through their love-clouded daze.
Castiel used to be a Warrior of Heaven. Demons had trembled in terror at the sound of his name. He had flown into battle on wings of righteous fury and laid waste to heaven’s enemies. He had laid siege to hell itself and had been the only one of his brothers and sisters to reach, and save, the righteous man.
Then Cas let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob and launched himself at Dean, wrapping his arms tightly around Dean’s waist and burying his head in Dean’s neck.
The hunt had gone without a hitch.
Okay, yeah, Cas and Jack had only been back for a few weeks and Jack's new angelic humanity system had taken a bit of getting used to.
He was drowning!
The shaky dregs of adrenaline that were left in Dean’s system oozed into his bloodstream, pushing his weary muscles to tighten and his hands to shake.
Then, Dean had smelled the heavenly aroma of fried food wafting out from the center of the crowd and had insisted on getting Cas an elephant ear.
“…she said it was the prize for one of the games, and I just had to try and get it,” Cas said, positively vibrating with excitement.
Hands that had once cradled the most precious thing in all the multiverse—Dean Winchester’s soul—as Castiel had torn through innumerable squadrons of demons to fight his way out of hell. Hands that had woven and stitched the very molecules of Dean’s body back together before delicately suspending his soul safely within once more.
From the sound of Dean's breathing, he wasn't asleep yet.
He refused to think about how much easier it would be to fall asleep if his angel were here with him, and when exactly had he started thinking of Cas as
~~~~~~~~~~~
Jack's not answering
Don’t get me wrong, Sam tries sometimes
Cas nodded expectantly and settled back against the headboard, seeming content to wait for Dean to put his thoughts in order.
Instead, Dean felt warm arms hold him tight, grounding his leftover nervous energy and soothing the ache in his muscles.
We “buried” you yesterday
He stopped throwing punches, but he still wasn't breathing.
Dean grumbled under his breath, the fog of sleep-deprivation clouding his thoughts and making his movements sluggish as he tried to remember why the hell he was here again.
“I love you,” Dean blurted out suddenly, all the pressure he had put on himself to just say it already finally bursting from him with all the grace and finesse of a shotgun blast.
Dean felt ridiculous.
Castiel felt delight stretch his mouth into a wide grin as he looked up at Dean and said, “I did it!”
And you still…
As long as I can remember, I’ve been taking care of everybody else
Cas seemed to deflate a bit at that and his face fell slightly as he fiddled with the edge of his own mug of coffee.
Castiel frowned down at the phone in his hands.
Cas closed his eyes and focused on slowing his breathing enough to match Dean's as he slept and settled into the familiar, quiet peace that accompanied this ritual.
He and Dean couldn't have stayed like that forever, no matter how tempting that was.
Dean stood looking down at Castiel from the doorway, his slight smile not enough to distract from the lines of tension creasing his face. He looked nervous.
“Anyway, it doesn’t matter,” Cas said, his confidence rising once again, “Because I did it, I won,” Cas announced proudly, his thousand-watt smile turning Dean’s knees to jelly.
It was… confusing.
good. Dean could count the number of people in his life that had ever had that kind of faith in him on one hand and there were even fewer that he had trusted just as much in return.
Castiel froze, unsure what to expect from Dean when the hunter saw that Castiel had made no progress whatsoever.
__________
Dean should get up.
Everything would be okay.
__________
The two of them sat in comfortable silence as the sky slowly brightened.
It’s been playing over and over in my mind on a loop ever since you said it
It shouldn’t even be that big a deal; Cas had already done the hard part and told Dean how he felt. All Dean had to do was find some way to let the guy know that he felt the same.
Cas could get sunburn now, Sam.
He should stop whining like a baby and accept the fact that Cas was a busy guy and wouldn't be able to stay with Dean whenever Dean wanted him to.
Cas wasn’t helpless. A little bit naive in places, even though he was older than Dean could really wrap his mind around and also happened to be a bad-ass warrior of heaven who could—and did, once upon a time—kick the living crap out of Dean without so much as breaking a sweat.
Leave it to Cas to offer to help the very people working to con him out of his hard-earned cash.
Every time I thought they were asking too much, you just kept choosing me
Cas nodded again, biting at his lower lip as he waited for Dean to continue.
He had assumed that Dean would be shocked and maybe even upset at the position he had assumed while sleeping. He had thought Dean might even be a little angry with Cas for letting him do it.
Jack's not coming back and neither are you
Dean decided that he felt more at peace than he had in ages and he didn't want to let Cas go.
He was surprised when Dean chuckled and shook his head at the mess in the bowl.
He would definitely
Cas started out of the daze he had fallen into.
Things between them had just been a bit… strained.
Suddenly his lungs cleared.
Dean calmed slightly with every word.
Cas sat up and swung his legs off the side of the bed and started putting his shoes back on.
And he felt something that was undeniably
He felt warm lips pressed to his, a connection that seemed to pulse steadily with every bit of love and devotion the two of them had felt for each other over the past decade.
Castiel sighed heavily and knelt down to look for the errant sock under the bed.
Several hours, a long conversation, and many, many kisses later, Dean helped Castiel find his missing sock.
Cas had gently moved his arm around Dean and the hunter had immediately snuggled in closer and had rested his head on the angel's shoulder.
Before Castiel could finish his question, Dean had crossed the distance between them in two long strides, gripped Castiel’s face in his hands, and plastered his lips to Castiel’s.
That’s my fault
Dean inhaled sharply through his nose in surprise, before melting into the kiss with the most wonderful moan of satisfaction that Castiel had ever heard.
The anger in Dean’s messages left Castiel’s chest aching with sympathy as he sank down onto the edge of the bed.
Dean had just enough time to sag in relief and gather his breath for an angry tirade about the stupidity of wandering off and leaving Dean standing there all alone and
Just as Dean was about to throw something in frustration at not being able to sleep, he heard a knock on his door.
But Castiel cut him off impatiently by crossing the room in two quick strides and slamming his mouth over Dean’s.
That was… odd.
I mean, I half raised the guy, it just seems weird, you know?
A few hours of messy cleanup and one giant bonfire later, the four of them had packed their aching bodies into the Impala and headed for the nearest motel.
How could you do this again?
But there was nothing he could do now, this Dean was months in the past.
The concert had been a bit much for Cas, who was still not used to loud sounds that weren't related to battle. When Sam had decided that Jack's concert experience wouldn't be complete without joining the mosh pit, Dean had taken pity on the overwhelmed angel and pulled the ripcord, telling Sam that he and Cas would meet them by the main entrance after the concert was over.
Cas was still standing across from Dean in the little pocket of calm they had found, and he was looking more and more worried the longer Dean just stood there thinking furiously and staring silently at him like a moron.
Together.
Dean spun in a slow circle and scanned the crowd yet again for any sign of Cas, or of what could have lured his attention away from the little pocket of calm that Dean had left him in.
I know I hurt you
Dean chuckled and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand as he said, “Yeah, everything’s fine.”
A small part of him had felt a little bit of hope when Dean had made the offer. Maybe Dean was finally ready to let their relationship go back to normal.
stay locked in the bathroom all night like a scared little kid.
Dean stood across from him and cradled Castiel’s hands in his own as he began to guide them through the process of forming the hamburger patty and Castiel tried to set aside his shock.
He felt the sweet relief of his lungs finally filling with air.
Cas couldn't stand out here all night, however. There were many more people in the bunker now and one of them was bound to wander down this hall eventually and see him lurking outside Dean's door.
Confidence looked damn good on Cas.
Dean leaned across the few inches in between them to press his lips to Cas’ own.
Dean was standing in the middle of his room, looking at Castiel with a nervous wince that looked like it could have been a smile if he were more relaxed.
I’m nothing special
Half-formed thoughts fired randomly in his mind. What was— Why would he— How did—
He couldn't stay, though.
Dean jumped across to turn off the stove and move the blackened burger pan to the sink. He turned back toward Castiel with a sheepish grin on face but then looked down and burst out laughing.
I drink too much
We buried some shit to “represent” you
You're not supposed to die. Dammit, Cas
“Hey, Cas. Lose something?” Dean asked, his tone making Castiel look up from his search.
He couldn't sleep.
Cas had found he quite liked this new arrangement.
__________
He was a bad parent.
He was, in short, a dick.
He helped Dean clean up and, before Dean could suggest they try another batch, he pulled Dean in close enough to kiss once more.
__________
He would play it suave.
Maybe it'll stop buzzing around my head if I tell you this way
But Dean found he didn't want to move.
Not too badly, but still.
Cas trudged down the hallway, feet dragging. Between the hunters coming back wounded and Jack getting injured while training, Cas had been healing a lot of injuries over the past few days.
He had been back from the Empty and human again for a little over a week and he had somehow already managed to start losing what few possessions he had.
But for some reason the words wouldn’t come.
seep into his skin like sunshine on a cold winter’s morning, flowing down inside and twining itself around his heart. A gentle stillness that settled something deep inside Dean, and he wondered if this was what true peace felt like.
He pelted down the hallway, barely registering the cold bunker floor on his one bare foot.
We're gonna find a way to bring you home.
Castiel wound his arms around Dean and was thrilled to feel Dean’s arms wind around him in return.
And then you’d leave
No matter how much or how little you had, you always tried to help people
And, with that, Dean bolted out of Castiel’s room like a scared rabbit.
Some of that anger must have shown on Dean’s face because Cas’ frown deepened and he started to apologize, “Sorry, I know this is the bed you chose. I didn’t mean to invade your space—”
To help me
I can't get a hold of Jack
But no matter what happens, I just needed to tell you
Dean grinned into the darkness.
Dean's breath came in pants as he shuddered and shook. Slowly, Dean's breathing evened out, returning to a more regular rhythm.
Sam was going on about “closure” or some bullshit
He would give anything; beg, borrow, or steal; ransack heaven and hell and any realm in between to find some way to let this past-Dean know that he would be back.
The angel, who was normally even more of a grump in the mornings than Dean was now that he actually slept on a regular basis, had woken Dean up half an hour ago and dragged him out here because… Dean couldn’t remember why. Something about the scenery.
It was quite possibly the sexiest thing Dean had ever seen.
“I had a lot of time to think, while you were… gone,” Dean said to his own lap. “Hell, I must have replayed what you said at least a thousand times.”
For such a new sensation, he felt strangely lost without it.
You dragged me outta hell
He had apparently managed to agree to this hunt, pack the necessary gear, and drive the four of them all the way to Nevada with his head too full of inner turmoil about the talk he needed to have with Cas to do the math on this trip and realize that two plus two meant that he and the angel would be sharing a motel room.
The chaos around them was suddenly too much for Dean to process and he yanked Cas toward the first quiet spot he could see.
But Dean wasn’t worried.
If Dean wasn’t so sure that Chuck was out of the picture, he would swear someone was messing with them.
“I would like that very much,” Cas said, with another fond smile.
Cas had declined trying any of the carnival games or rides and had seemed perfectly content to walk along quietly observing humanity.
…Because fried food is delicious, not because Dean would secretly do just about anything to keep Cas smiling and happy like that… Shut up.
Castiel glanced down in confusion to find that his hands were coated in raw beef, having subconsciously crushed the hamburger while he was focused on… other things.
That I wasn’t anything special
Castiel, former Angel of the Lord, absolutely
Movement caught his eye and he glanced over to see Cas sitting next to him. Oh, right.
Castiel scooped up some of the ground beef hesitantly and began slowly and carefully patting it into shape.
Michael killing.
Cas sat on the edge of the bed and grabbed Dean by the shoulders.
The very first day that they had been back, Cas had chugged a cup of coffee that was way too hot and burned his damn tongue.
Nausea rolled through Dean’s stomach as his brain replayed Cas’ speech, and the horror that had followed it, yet again.
Well, maybe Sam can make the deal, I kinda killed the first Death and Billie, so maybe they won't wanna talk to me, but we'll figure something out.
It’s been weeks and you’re still not back
Castiel was broken out of his thoughts when Dean turned away from the stove top to check on his progress.
Dean froze for a moment, then seemed to come to a decision.
Dean rolled on to his side and stared at the pillow that Cas had used last night, a slight smile playing on his lips when he remembered the warm safety he had felt that morning, waking up in the crook of Cas' arm.
He had just had the best night's sleep he had had in...well, in years.
Cas didn’t seem to think so, though. He looked up at Dean and beamed a smile at him that a thousand sunrises couldn’t hope to outshine.
to take all of your belongings with you.
Dean was in trouble.
You were right, Cas
Cas gasped in a breath, tears welling in his eyes. Silence hung over the room for a momentary eternity as Dean tried not to fidget.
There was a knock at his door and he let out a frustrated, “Come in.”
Dean knew that Sam had a point.
The two of them hadn’t discussed Castiel’s dying confession since his return, and he felt sure that Dean was trying to find a way to let him down easy.
He scrolled down to find another string of messages, dated a few days later.
Dean had called him that before, of course, but usually only in the context of a morning greeting. Why on earth was Dean calling him that now?
How in holy heaven had Dean made this look so easy?
All those nights during heaven's war, when the sights and sounds of his brothers and sisters dying had become too much, he'd been desperate to find something, anything, to forget the horror for a little while.
They wandered farther through the crowds, the deafening noise and chaotic sights fading into the background as Dean’s focus narrowed down to the hand clutched tightly, possessively in his… and his own internal panic.
But you never did
Dean’s mind blanked out. He was suddenly completely unable to process anything that wasn’t Cas’ face.
His smile—which was normally small and quiet and rare—was wider and more carefree than Dean had ever seen it.
Dean was just about ready to find an employee and have them page Cas like some lost child, when the angel in question came walking out of the sea of humanity surging around him like Moses parting the Red Sea.
The ones that die
I’ve always thought the same thing about you
Maybe he should just give up and admit that
Dean’s entire capacity for speech seemed to dry up in an instant, and he could do nothing but heave an exasperated sigh at his own inability to communicate how he felt.
Dean tried to shake him off.
Anyone except Cas.
And it was also odd that he had been scanning the crowd waiting for Cas to come back for—he threw the cold and soggy elephant ear in the trash and checked his watch—twenty minutes now.
Cas touched Dean's forehead to scan for injury.
Castiel scoffed lightly at that before leaning in for another kiss.
But Dean was totally and completely not worried…
Now Cas was the one grounding and calming Dean.
He dropped his head back down on Cas' shoulder, snuggled back into his side and said, "Mornin' Cas."
Yeah, he was doing
To bust you out of the empty
Castiel loved watching over Dean while he slept. Just being in the same room, listening to him breathe, it grounded and calmed Cas the way nothing else could.
You’re not supposed to leave
"Dean, calm down." Cas shook Dean's arm gently.
Cas paused for a second before realizing he was too worn out to worry about whether Dean was awake enough to realize what he was saying.
Dean wasn't sure what he found more surprising when he woke the next morning, the fact that Cas had stayed with him all night, or the fact that Dean, at some point during the night, had turned onto his side and snuggled up to the angel, throwing an arm over his middle and resting his head on Cas’ shoulder.
Dean braced his hands on the sink and told himself that they were just words. Just three little words were all that stood between Dean and Cas being together after all these years. And yet, the idea of actually saying those words out loud left Dean in a cold sweat.
When the angel had asked him how many of those nightmares Dean had had while Cas was gone, he had looked away and growled, "Enough."
Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed as he opened his messaging app and saw that all of the text messages came from Dean.
When they finally pulled away to breathe, Cas looked as stunned as Dean felt, his eyes staying closed for a moment longer than necessary before blinking slowly open.
So, with the sort of courage that only comes when you find yourself anonymously blending into a crowd large enough to get lost in, Dean reached out and grabbed Cas’ hand again.
He's probably just busy
He had to stop Michael.
He was breathing.
He had found Dean.
He stopped and listened outside the door to check that Dean was asleep and slipped into the room. Cas sank gratefully into the chair by Dean's bed and took a deep breath. He felt some of the tension release its grip on the muscles in his shoulders.
He made a mental note to apologize to Jack on Dean's behalf for the barrage of prayers the hunter had undoubtedly sent Jack's way.
Sam and me went on a hunt yesterday
Dean got up and started grabbing clean clothes.
Michael using Dean's body to build an army.
Dean's lungs were locked up. He was unable to breathe.
After that, the tone of the messages shifted.
Dean cleared his throat and turned back around with a grin that looked a little forced, staying where he was on the other side of the room as he suggested, “Now you try one.”
Cas was watching television.
Messages detailing attempts to breach the Empty… and failures.
And if Sam or Jack noticed their clasped hands—or the little stuffed bear that rode home perched between Dean and Cas on baby’s bench seat, and later found its way to sit in pride-of-place on the shelves in Dean’s room—they were smart enough not to mention it.
“NO!” Dean blurted out, accidentally shouting it way too loudly for the small room, as he raised a hand to stop Cas, who had started to stand up.
He didn't want to.
The nest had been no match for four hunters. Well, more like three hunters and one fully-powered angel.
They were currently perched on a slope behind their motel high in the mountains, looking out over the misty trees that fell away before them, in the gray light of predawn.
He was huddled beneath a blanket sitting in a lawn chair, in a field, at the crack of way-too-freaking-early-in-the-morning, and he needed his damn coffee.
That there was a reason to keep fighting.
I have no idea what to do with that
Dean knew he should move.
They were forced to pull apart for air after a few moments and Dean tightened his arms around Cas once more, unwilling to let him go now that they had finally found each other.
That was way too soft and sappy, wasn’t it?
Cas who slipped in through the door and stood awkwardly silent on the other side of it.
And if Dean reached over and held Cas’ hand as the sun finally crested the horizon in a burst of scarlet flame, well, that was nobody’s damn business but theirs.
He shuffled awkwardly from foot to foot for a moment, before giving into the demand of his aching muscles and sitting on the other side of his bed, pulling his legs up so he could turn and face Cas.
Even when you were dangerously low on power, you’d use anything you had to help others
Cas was there.
I think he’s worried about me
He gasped a breath.
Panic clawed at his mind.
He flailed and clawed at what seemed to be an infinite amount of water.
Dean was instantly more awake than he had ever been in his life.
Dean told the voice that it could take everything it had to say, bundle it up into a nice tight ball, and shove it.
We didn't even have your damn coat this time
Until Castiel’s brain jump-started again and he realized he didn’t actually care.
The next cluster of messages was dated a few weeks later.
In fact, Cas
Now, here, with his angel, he was safe.
After all, if you’re moving into a new room, you should at least
But then he hesitated. Dean had gone to all the trouble to set up this new phone with his old number. He had seemed to want Castiel to understand what that meant, emphasizing it until he was sure that Castiel had understood, even though he had clearly been uncomfortable talking about it.
The sights and sounds of the carnival came crashing back into Dean’s awareness as a surge of adrenaline shot through him. His hands went clammy and, if it hadn’t meant letting go of Cas or dropping his bear, he would have wiped the dampness of them off on his jeans.
While reclining against the headboard.
Drowning!
Not that Dean had asked.
I’m sending this to you so you can remind me to rub Sammy’s nose in this when we get you back
I couldn't ever find a way to say this to you while you were here
He focused on the way Dean’s calloused hands pushed and pulled with just enough force to guide his own through the process of making a perfectly-formed hamburger.
Cas started to protest, “Dean, you don’t have to. I know that you don’t—”
There was a strange tension in the air now that Castiel couldn’t quite place. Was Dean angry with him for some reason?
Which really should have been Dean’s first clue that fate was waiting just around the corner to smack him upside the head with a two-by-four.
Dean was in
Wearing nothing but a pair of boxers and one of Dean’s old Zeppelin T-shirts.
After all, Castiel thought, pizza would do just as well for dinner.
Dean was losing the fight against his own heavy eyelids when he heard Cas whisper, “Good night, Dean. I love you.”
He had been up for nearly 48 hours, helping Sam deal with all the insanity that had come into their lives lately, trying to relieve his brother of some of his burden, trying to force Sam to take it easier and get some rest himself.
Michael torturing.
Castiel blinked.
He and Cas had only been dating a short while, Dean only having worked up the courage to admit how much he cared for the angel recently.
Then the tone of the messages changed again.
Cas smiled over at him and gestured expansively in a way that seemed to indicate everything from here to the horizon as he said, “I wanted you to see this.”
I had kind of a close call
Dean grinned wide into the darkness of the room and said, “Good night, Cas. I love you, too.”
Sam had thrown his hands up into the air in exasperation and turned back to packing his own bag, muttering something under his breath which sounded suspiciously like “Mother hen” that Dean had chosen to ignore.
Castiel stood in his new room in the bunker clad in an old T-shirt and jeans that Dean had lent him… and one sock.
So Dean had rolled his eyes and grunted in a way that could have been agreement and gone right back to double- and triple-checking the contents of Cas’ bag.
Castiel may have been incapable of forming hamburger patties to save his life, but one thing he had always been good at was paying attention to Dean.
At first, everything had been fine. Dean and Cas had wandered the fair, sticking mainly to the edges, where the deafening wall of sound generated by the rides and games trickled off to a dull roar.
Dean had chuckled, shook his head lightly, and told Cas to wait on a bench behind a cotton candy vendor where it was relatively quiet and he could people-watch in peace.
I've been praying for days and he’s not answering
Regardless of when Dean had started to be okay with Cas watching over him as he slept, he definitely didn't have a problem with it after Cas had come back from the empty. Dean had had more than one nightmare about Lucifer stabbing Cas to death since he'd been back.
Dean’s head swam as he poured a decade’s worth of love and longing, every impossible, awe-inspiring thing that he had ever felt for Cas, into the kiss.
No fireworks went off in Dean’s head.
confused head tilt and asked Dean why he was offering to scalp a pachyderm.
He tried to pat the burgers into shape like Dean had shown him, but he always seemed to use either too much force—which caused the raw meat to ooze out between his fingers—or too little—which left the meat in a shapeless lump totally unsuitable for frying.
and casually said, "You're late."
His search for the missing sock temporarily abandoned, Castiel opened his phone to find that he had dozens of unread messages.
Alone.
Just as Cas started to stand and go back to his chair, Dean stirred and grabbed his arm.
And every time something dragged you away, you always came back
“You were wrong,” Dean blurted out.
He gasped again.
He had to get back control of his body.
He wasn’t accomplishing much more than making a mess by staying here and he had no idea why Dean had asked for his ‘help’ in the first place.
He should jump away and do his best 'no homo' dance.
Cas had felt calmer than he had in ages and had closed his eyes, a slight smile playing on his face as he had once more slowed his breathing to match Dean's.
After countless sleepless nights spent searching his soul, trying to figure out exactly how he felt about the angel, and countless days spent trying to work up the courage to tell him.
No, instead of watching where they going or observing the people around them as he had been doing with such fascination since they had arrived here, Cas was staring down at where his hand was nestled safely in Dean’s with the softest smile Dean had ever seen on his face.
That I was just one messed up guy in a world full of ‘em
You gave up an army of angels… a freakin’ army, man
Castiel briefly considered deleting the messages without reading them. If Dean found them embarrassing, they could just pretend they never existed.
“Come on,” Dean said, cradling the little bear to his chest with one hand and grabbing Cas’ hand with the other. “I’m going to get you that elephant ear,” and he yanked Cas into the crowd.
Castiel felt his grin slip a notch as he asked, “Dean, are you—”
The hopeful tone sent another aching spasm through Castiel, even as his heart warmed at the fierce determination evident in Dean's messages.
And Castiel knew, if another apocalypse came knocking right that second and he had to choose between saving the world and staying locked forever in Dean’s arms, he would let the world burn.
He wasn't drowning anymore.
After all, Cas could take care of himself. If he found himself in any real danger, his mojo would kick in and he would fight his way out of it. Nothing could stop Cas when he was fighting.
Cas had flowed through the nest like warm honey, gliding gracefully, lethally along, taking down vampire after vampire.
“Go on, try it,” Dean wheedled, before teasing, “I’m not trying to poison you.”
Dean had taken pity on Castiel and formed the first batch of burgers himself, and was now standing across the room frying them, humming absently, as Castiel tried to form the next batch.
Dean was practically dead on his feet, yet here he lay, in the dark, staring up at the ceiling, waiting for the blessed peace of sleep to come claim him. And sleep was being a bitch.
So Dean breathed out, “Screw it,” dropped Cas’ hand to grab him by the lapel instead, and hauled the angel in for a kiss.
"Dean, you're not going to be able to breathe until you calm down," Cas said sternly, his fear for the hunter growing every second he wasn’t able to draw breath.
Cas therefore had two options. He could give up on getting any actual rest with Dean and go back to his own room to overanalyze the situation all night, or he could pluck up the courage to face Dean and the possibly extremely awkward conversation waiting on the other side of this door.
Okay, I've got it figured out. I'm going to call Jack and we're going to find a way to bust me into the empty and I'm gonna pull you outta there, Cas.
“It reminded me of you,” Cas said quietly as his smile softened.
“Been meanin’ to talk to you about what you said before the Empty… you know,” Dean said.
You can say what you like about Chuck.
Dean’s entire body sagged in relief as he gathered Cas up in his arms and pulled him in close. He let out an unsteady huff of air and turned his head to place a quick kiss on Cas’ hair, at which Cas honest-to-god giggled.
The task that Dean had seemed to find so easy appeared to be completely beyond Castiel’s ability to accomplish.
Why in the hell do you keep leaving?
Dean stared, eyes watering as his lungs burned.
Or talked to him about it at all.
But, if there was one thing that Castiel had learned after a decade of following the Winchesters around, it was that no power in heaven or on earth could make Dean talk about his feelings before he was damn good and ready.
Like ripping off a bandage.
Which was how Dean found himself standing in a quiet pocket on the Kansas State Fairgrounds watching the tide of humanity pass him by in a deafening roar of laughter, happy screams, and more bells and whistles than he had ever heard in one place, all highlighted by flashing, brightly colored lights that lit up the night sky like it was broad daylight. Without Castiel.
Castiel smiled down at the screen, they must have been so excited, the day that they had defeated Chuck. He felt a slight pang that he hadn’t been there to share it with them.
Castiel sat at the edge of his bed, phone clutched tightly in his hand as tears welled in his eyes and pain burst in his chest.
Cas wasn’t even looking where he was going, instead trusting that Dean would lead him safely through the throngs of people and rides, and damn if that didn’t make Dean stand a little taller.
Dean threw his arms around Cas and clung to him like a lifeline, afraid that if he let go, the panic would drown him again.
“Dean! I did it!” Cas proclaimed loudly as soon as he was close enough to be heard over the roaring crowds around them.
Dean gave himself a stern look in the mirror and told himself to march right out into the room and just fucking say it already.
Then, the phone slipped from his hand.
Castiel had to pause to draw a shaky breath and wipe the tears out of his eyes before he could continue reading.
“Do you want to walk around a bit? Maybe do some more people-watching?” Dean asked once they had finished eating.
Not that Cas had been able watch over Dean as much since the fall had damaged his wings. Now he could only indulge himself when he happened to be in close proximity to the hunter when he fell asleep.
He was the most beautiful thing Castiel had ever seen.
The frown disappeared from Cas’ face, his eyes darting over Dean’s face.
__________
That’s on me
He wasn't being ridiculous, no matter what Sam said.
You’re a fucking angel of the lord
"Stay," Dean mumbled, his eyes still closed.
Not the “Somebody help me, a monster’s trying to eat my face” kind of trouble. After a lifetime of hunting, that kind of trouble was pretty much just background noise.
“It was quite difficult to shoot the ducks in the little booth,” Cas said, before leaning closer to Dean conspiratorially—which made Dean hope that his face didn’t look as dazed as he felt—and confided, “I don’t think these people know very much about guns, Dean. The sights on all of the weapons they have are completely off true.”
anyway.
Dean peered blearily out at the amazing, awe-inspiring view that would definitely still be there when it was not so stupidly early in the morning and groused, “Okay, so I’ve seen it. Can I go back to bed now?”
Warmth curled through Dean’s chest and sent a pleasant tingle shooting out through his body.
Dean took a deep breath and felt his jaw clench.
Anyway, I don’t know if what you said is true
Billie sent Jack there before, we just gotta figure out how. Maybe we can make some kinda deal with the new Death.
Cas chuckled and rolled his eyes a little, like Dean doing anything to hurt him was the most ridiculous thing he had ever heard of, which was… good. It was
Dean took a careful sip of his coffee and let the blessed liquid slide down his throat and curl warmth through his body from the inside.
He was a bad writer.
His eyes flew open as Dean reached across him to the bedside table and slapped the offending alarm off none too gently.
Relief flooded Cas.
Still, Castiel would be lying if he said he had never been tempted. Castiel knew well enough that his own people skills were not the best and it was just so difficult to tell what Dean was thinking sometimes…
You turned your back on heaven
He sat in shock for a handful of heartbeats.
Dean mentally rolled his eyes at the sappy turn his own thoughts had taken even as he felt a warmth that had nothing to do with coffee curl in his chest and wind its way around his heart.
How in the hell was he supposed to deal with it while trapped with Cas in a tiny motel room?
You wouldn't be there, though
__________
But it seems like I’m kinda hard-wired to not let him do it
As he rounded a corner in the hallway, he spotted the door to Dean's room.
But, say what you will, the guy had a hell of a good idea when he invented coffee.
"Good. That's good, Dean. Just breathe."
The bright lights and smiling crowds had seemed to fascinate Cas, and Dean had been reminded that the angel hadn't had much experience with large crowds before. Hunting was lonely work and the types of monsters that they usually went after tended to avoid cities.
But, it wasn't like Dean's fears were completely unfounded.
And then, a few days later.
They found an unoccupied cafe table under a tent near the elephant ear vendor and settled in across from each other to eat.
He was so screwed.
Cause I never had the guts to do what you did
I visited your ‘grave’ yesterday
Dean scolded himself.
That I was the most selfless, loving human being that you would ever know…
Cas turned toward him, concern wrinkling his brow as he asked cautiously, “Dean?”
That was before Michael. Now Dean was having nightmares with almost the same frequency and intensity as he had when he had gotten back from Hell.
Almost from the first day we met, you were the first person who gave a crap about me
He had felt the weight of Dean's arm across his stomach, the way the hunter was warm and relaxed, breathing calmly at his side.
Of all the stupid people on this planet…
Hands that were apparently incapable of forming a god-forsaken hamburger patty.
Cas pushed all of the questions about what this meant and if things would be awkward in the morning from his exhausted brain. He kicked off his shoes and climbed onto the covers next to Dean, fully clothed, never breaking Dean's grip on his arm.
Anyway, here you come along, a freakin’ angel of the lord and you just keep choosing to help me no matter what
There were a thousand things that could hurt the angel now and he didn't know how to avoid the majority of them.
Dean glanced back at Cas after about a dozen yards to make sure that the angel wasn’t getting overwhelmed by the crowds, only to find that Cas wasn’t people watching this time.
Cas sprang forward and grabbed Dean's arm.
It was only once Sam had returned with the room keys that Dean realized his critical mistake.
Things had been slow since that vamp nest in Florida, and when Sam had seen that some band that he and Jack had been fangirling over was set to play the state fair, he had all but thrown everyone into the car and demanded that Dean break ten speeding laws to get them there in time.
“There, see? Not that hard…” Dean’s voice came out rough and stilted as he took the hamburger from Castiel and turned to place it with the others by the stove.
Well, someone like Cas.
Instead, Dean took a deep breath and went for something a little more honest. “I would love to watch the sunrise with you, Cas.”
Castiel took a few deep breaths and reminded himself that Dean was alright, he had made it through, he had kept fighting and was now just a few doors down the hall.
I’m a complete train wreck most days, man
Dean cradled the warm mug closer to him as he waited for the heavenly elixir to cool enough that he could take a sip without burning his tongue.
It was bad enough that his brain had been yelling at him twenty-four seven that he and Cas needed to sit down and have a long talk—a long, chick-flick type talk about
I love you, too
“Been meanin’ to talk to you about something,” Dean muttered, rubbing the back of his neck again.
He was megalomaniac who destroyed entire universes because they weren’t entertaining enough.
Dean was breathing.
We've been trying to find a way to bust into the empty for weeks now
He also wasn't sure exactly when Dean had become okay with it. When he had stopped jolting awake, reaching for his gun, before realizing it was Cas and telling him to stop staring at him while he slept because it was creepy.
Dean thrashed and sat bolt upright in bed, choking.
“So, anyway,” Dean said as he backed toward the door. “Have a good time!”
__________
It was soft and cuddly.
Here in this moment everything that he'd done, everything that Michael had done, seemed like a bad dream.
But he didn't right now.
Castiel was about to ask why he would need to know what calls he had missed while he was essentially dead, but Dean cut him off with a nervous chuckle before he could get the words out.
Damn.
Dean almost always preferred to be alone when he was cooking, often shooing everyone else out of the kitchen so that he could work in peace.
Dean stood across from Castiel, hands now unclenched from the counter and dangling limply at his sides as he stared mutely at Castiel’s face.
Dean moved over to wash his hands at the sink and Castiel took the opportunity to really look at him.
Cas was pleased that Dean didn't seem to be upset at where he found himself and instead had returned comfortably to his side.
He and Cas were essentially on a date.
Castiel was across the room and out the door before the device had time to hit the floor.
Dean stood frozen for a long moment as he desperately tried to remember how to breathe.
Cas had looked at him with his
Was that why Dean had seemed so nervous? Was he embarrassed by the fact that he had been sending Castiel messages long after he was no longer able to receive them?
Right. Fine.
Then, breaking through the wordless static that his brain had become, came one thought, one possible course of action, shining like a beacon in a snowstorm.
Dean brushed his knuckles down Castiel’s cheek and said, simply, “Wanted to do that for a long time. Never thought I could.”
trouble.
He wished, as he always did, that there was some way he could reach out to Dean. Some way to soothe his anger, as well as the pain and fear that so often hid behind it.
I could never figure out why
Cas had no idea how long they stayed like that, holding each other together in the dark. Finally, Dean's grip started to loosen, and Cas realized that Dean had drifted off to sleep again. Cas shifted slightly and gently laid Dean back on the bed, pulling his blankets up to cover his chest.
Tears streamed freely down his face.
Castiel pulled himself together and saw that what appeared to be the final cluster of messages was dated just two weeks before he and Jack had returned.
The sight of Dean drew him up short.
Castiel looked from his own messy hands to the pan smoking and sizzling quietly in the sink and couldn’t help joining in with Dean’s infectious laughter.
Dean couldn’t help shaking his head and chuckling fondly at that.
"Dean," Cas tried calling to him again as he dodged Dean's blows, "I'm here. You're in the bunker. You're safe. Everyone's safe. It's okay."
That was new.
His eyes shone with confidence, flashing in the brightly-colored lights and reminding Dean of a night so many years ago in a dusty, warded barn when this impossible, beautiful being had strolled right into his life and upended everything he had ever known.
Rowena was keeping hell and its demons on a tight leash, heaven was mostly quiet since Jack had left a few of the more trustworthy angels in charge, and even the monsters on earth were less likely to try and massacre entire towns than they had been in years. Now that Chuck was no longer chumming the waters and driving the vampires, werewolves, and assorted other nasties into a feeding frenzy, there weren't actually as many of the damn things as there had seemed to be before.
Later, when when Sam and Jack were buzzing with excitement in the back seat, ecstatically reliving their favorite moments from the concert, Dean drove home with his hand firmly held by one blissfully happy former Angel of the Lord.
He had looked at Dean in surprise and had seen that the hunter was still sound asleep. Dean had looked so peaceful, and Cas had thought he was sleeping better than he usually did, so Cas had decided not to wake him up.
Nothing's working
All of the angel’s attention was immediately laser-focused on the sweet treat in front of him as he practically devoured it. Dean was already making a mental note to start shopping for a deep-fryer for the bunker’s kitchen.
Cas stiffened briefly in surprise before melting into Dean with a contented hum.
Oh shit, Cas was saying something wasn’t he?
You can say all of this and more about the creator of the multiverse and Dean will agree with you one hundred percent.
Cas himself was still getting used to having powers one minute and having none the next. The only time he really had them now was when they were hunting, and hunts had been few and far between lately.
“Dean, are you alright?” Cas asked, his brow furrowing as he clicked off the TV and sat up to get a better look at him.
I must have pushed you away a thousand times
At this, Castiel felt a pang of a different kind. He had been gone for many months before he and Jack had finally made it back. Dean sounded as though he had been so sure that Castiel would be back soon. It must have been difficult for him to realize that that wasn’t the case.
Cas was somewhat surprised.
Sam freaked out
It was a child’s toy.
An army of monsters.
Dean slid sideways enough to give Cas room as he settled his weight on the bed.
Dean clutched Cas' arm, finally seeming to realize he was there.
Every time somebody made you choose between anything else and me, you chose me
In the end, it was the easiest thing in the world for the two of them to slip under the covers, to tangle their arms and legs together until Cas wound up with his head pillowed on Dean’s chest.
Dean sleepily ran his fingers through Cas’ hair and tried to keep his eyes open, not wanting to miss a single second of their time together.
Then Cas looked over at Dean with a warm, easy smile and Dean changed his mind;
The bear had vibrant green eyes and was wearing a tiny little faux-leather jacket with a matching goddamn green heart embroidered on the back.
Dean looked at himself in the bathroom mirror, rolled his eyes, and sighed heavily.
Cas wasn't sure what was going on with him and Dean, but he felt sure that Dean wouldn't want everyone in the bunker to know about it.
To say it out loud
Nobody’s ever really taken care of me
They pulled away to breathe some minutes later, staying close enough to share each other’s breath, Dean seeming as reluctant as Castiel to lose this new-found closeness.
Cas held Dean as tightly as he could without hurting him and rode out the storm.
Not to mention, Cas seemed to be okay with their current position. His breathing was deep and even, and Dean could hear his heart beating calmly in his chest. If Dean hadn't known better, he would have said that Cas was asleep.
Dean heard and saw it all.
A voice in the back of Dean’s mind tried to argue that it was embarrassing, that Dean should scoff and tell Cas exactly why it wasn’t something that he should give to Dean. That it just wasn’t something that ‘real men’ should do.
When we get you back you’re gonna be so proud…
It wasn’t something anyone would think was appropriate to give a grown man.
…And if he kept telling himself that, maybe the knot of unease in his gut would get with the program and loosen the hell up already.
Sam had been running himself ragged, keeping their new band of hunters safe, looking for ways to stop Michael. Dean couldn't abandon his brother to do all the work alone, no matter how much he longed to hold his angel close and just tell the world to go to hell.
He reached over, pulled the covers down on what he had already subconsciously started to think of as
There were moments when Castiel could feel Dean’s gaze on him from across the room and could swear that he felt echoes of longing emanating from Dean’s direction even in his current powered-down state.
Castiel opened their conversation and saw that the first unread messages were sent just a few days after he had been taken by the empty.
Would it be so bad? Dying?
At least then, this would all be over
Cas froze and blinked at Dean in surprise.
Dean gestured vaguely before shoving his hands in his pockets.
That he hadn’t been abandoned.
And maybe fact that Jack and Cas—and any other angels who happened to be on earth—were effectively human, unless they needed their angel mojo to protect themselves or others, had thrown Dean for a bit of a loop at first.
“Just, surprise. I’m breathing your breath,” Castiel said. “We’re breathing together.” He filled his lungs with a strange and ragged sound. Dean felt his heart clunk. “I don’t have any control over this feeling of wanting to be closer to you all the time.”
“That’s right, you goddamned nosy freak! Get the fuck out of my Castiel’s body! you don’t live here anymore.” He started to pronounce an exorcism and boom, Jimmy let go of the rope, and Castiel was back in control. Dean threw himself on him to prevent him from leaving before speaking, and the second he did that Castiel’s wings extended -BAM!- into the middle of the room and the wall over the desk and there was a second or two of carnage as he knocked over a lamp before he got his wings squared away.
“You forget your name.”
They both woke up when Sam banged on the door wondering if Dean had plans for supper.
Dean had a funny expression on his face. “First off, the guy who first named ‘alpha males’ renounced his research.”
Castiel said, with what he believed to be saintly patience, “Dean, you’ve heard about my two sisters and five brothers and my hellish childhood and my abusive caregivers and my distant parents and
“Okay. Tell me what you can, Dean.”
Dean made a hiccuping noise, pulled back and said, “I bet you think I’m a big baby.”
“I didn’t think I was a top,” Castiel said. ‘Taking care of Dean’ had been the most life-affirming, ecstatic, soul-shattering experience of his life. It was all a little startling.
Dean laughed a little. “It doesn’t matter. So, cup of cocoa and then bed-time?”
For everything else, it galled Dean to the centre point of his gall-bladder how much more loveable the old Cas was, but how much more useful and easy to talk to
Dean bristled. “I was concerned, not scared, and we dealt with it.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Dean said. “Maybe I’m having a little nervous breakdown.”
“All the ways in which I am really
The porch swing was in perfect shape, so he made use of it, and then wondered if Dean was going to ghost him. It just didn’t seem like Dean, though; and there was always the fact that he had to come home eventually. Then Castiel began thinking that he was sitting on a total stranger’s front porch, and he began to sweat a little.
“But they wouldn’t be you,” Dean said, as if he couldn’t help himself.
“WINCHESTER,
Dean occasionally teared up over sentimental items, but this was Niagara Falls in comparison. Castiel became very uneasy, and wondered what he should do, so he approached Dean gingerly and patted him lightly on the arm. Dean’s reaction to the shoulder pat was to literally turn into Castiel’s arms and cry onto his shoulder.
Castiel finished his bowl of chili in silence. Behind him in the living room, Dean got the movie set up.
“See you in the morning,” Castiel responded, and he heard Dean start a shower. Castiel shifted so he could peek around the back of the sofa through the ‘hallway’ of boxes to see Dean come out of the shower. He was rewarded with a brief and entrancing view of Dean, a towel fastened around his waist, his hair in dark, wet spikes, and just the faintest line over the towel showing the point at the top of his pubic hair.
He felt himself melt into the bed at the recollection of Dean’s hands on him, how his mouth was like a drug. They had taken turns jerking each other off while kissing, which didn’t sound like much, Castiel thought, when it had been such an incredible maelstrom of smooth and harsh and velvety and strong. Dean hadn’t said a word, but his tender caresses and mind-melting kisses and amazing hand job had done all the communicating that was necessary.
I don’t ask you what you do with Gilda.
The honesty of the man just killed Dean.
He lay back, allowing himself to luxuriate in sheets that smelled emphatically of sex, and Dean. He rolled over and smelled Dean’s pillow.
And it was nice to have a seraph around for healing, although being told endlessly about your liver damage was not fun.
“Is it likely to happen again?” he said. If it was only going to happen once he needed to know now.
The house was painted a soft yellow, with cream trim. There was a sycamore tree in the corner of the front yard across from the driveway, and a dilapidated garage leaned into the side of the house. The lawn was weedy and overgrown and the flower beds looked sad.
“I don’t mind.”
“See you in the morning,” Dean said.
Maybe Dean would be okay to sell them on Ebay, seeing as how that was likely where most of this stuff had likely emanated from in the first place.
Cas was practically growling now. “If you must know, I was thinking about kissing you.”
“I had to move before the inspector came. Gabe sent me a text last night. I thought I’d get here after you went to work. Do you want me to return the key and leave, or do you want me to work, or what?”
“Musta been a Boy Scout,” Dean said.
“I don’t hate myself,” Dean said. “Not for that,” he amended. “For pretending I didn’t care about it the next day.” Dean blew his nose. “So what are you doing here?”
“Yes,” Castiel said around a mouthful of cornbread.
“It’s better if you don’t know,” Castiel mumbled.
Castiel thought, and then felt himself flush.
“I think Naomi is an older-than-dirt schemer, and she’s been grooming Jimmy to take over Castiel’s body for her own purposes, and then Jimmy screwed everything up by ignoring his mission and telling me and Castiel to love each other and be happy.”
“So what was all that about, and tell me
Pouting, Dean picked up his phone from the coffee table and looked at the time.
Then, Dean started packing him lunches. It was better than the peanut butter and jelly he’d be bringing from home, so he ate the lunches. Every night he’d offer Castiel a ride home, and every night Castiel would refuse.
Suddenly the door to the bunker opened and a surprised Sam stuck his head outside. - "Here you are," Sam said, almost relieved, and took a few steps toward him. But there was no answer from Castiel. And because Sam has always been better at such things than his brother and especially Cas himself, he immediately noticed that something was different. He had the feeling that something important had happened that none of them understood yet. - After Sam still didn't get an answer, he carefully, so as not to startle the angel, put a hand on his shoulder. - "Dean has already asked three times where you are. I quickly left with the excuse of having forgotten something in the Impala" - As if to emphasize his words, Sam held up the car keys which made them jingle much too loudly in the silence. But Castiel had finally responded, tilting his head slightly in Sam's direction and just looking at him. - "What are you doing here?" - Sam lowered his hand and continued to face Cas. Tried to read anything in his gaze, to discern what was bothering his friend. But there was nothing but the same, confused expression on his face. - "Getting some fresh air" - Sam raised his eyebrow skeptically. That lie was so bad, even Castiel would have recognized it if it wasn't his own. - "When you disappeared, it sounded like something more serious" - Because now Cas also realized that his fib had been blown, he cleared his throat slightly embarrassed. - "Yes, I thought we were being followed. But I was wrong" - And although this excuse wasn't much better, Sam left it at that. He didn't want to probe further about it even if he knew there was something much more important, something bigger behind it. - "All right. Let's get inside before Dean puts out another APB on you" - To speed the whole thing up a bit, Sam put both hands on his friend's shoulders and gently but firmly pushed him towards the bunker. Because if he came back without Castiel, he would probably have to shoot himself. Because Dean's chatter about where he was now, he could truly no longer listen to. And like a bloodhound, he immediately raised his head when the door to the bunker opened and two figures came down the stairs. Dean hadn't left his place at the table and was still busy maltreating the laptop, if not quite too brainily anymore. He was probably surfing sites with pornographic content again, whose cast consisted mainly of busty Asian girls, Castiel thought to himself. But he said nothing. He just continued down the stairs and slowly circled the table.
A sigh from Castiel. - "Dean, please. I don't have time for this. I get what you were trying to tell me. I'm like a brother to you" - Dean could see Castiel hesitate. Almost as if he was waiting for objections. But he continued to speak. - "And to me, you are as much like a brother. Almost more than my true siblings could ever be" - Dean knew that was wrong. He should have said something in reply. He should have insisted that Castiel listen to what he had to say, so that this painful feeling would finally subside, the feeling as if a chain was wrapped around his chest, pulling it tighter and tighter. But Dean only nodded. He put on a grin, not even trying to make it look real. Because Castiel wouldn't notice or even understand anyway. - "Then it's all good. Sometimes I just get the feeling you claim to understand something you don't. Or misinterprets it" - For heaven's sake! Was he really babbling right now? Now it was completely over with him. He was clearly losing his mind! And it was only this angel's fault! This impudent angel who was now still staring at him with a smirk on his face. - "Don't worry. I am meanwhile a little more knowledgeable about the behavior of people and their feelings" - Not knowledgeable enough, as Dean thought to himself. But he did not speak it. He said nothing - although he damn well should! He merely lowered his head, smiled to himself, and turned himself into an idiot. - Damn it, say something!, he shouted at himself. But nothing would leave his mouth. The chain that had wrapped his chest in a tight grip spread to his neck and took away his breath. Even worse. It seemed to push back each of the words that tried with all their might to fight their way up. With every link of this chain, trying to make sure that nothing of Dean's inner self got out. None of it should reach Castiel.
Cupid kept moving toward the shadow, obviously leaving. But there was one thing that castiel kept on his mind. He needed answers. - So, "wait," Castiel held Cupid back, which immediately stopped. Almost as if he expected to be stopped by Castiel. So he turned to him again to hear the question he already expected. - "If you have the power to unite a man and an angel, then so can -- I mean --" - How could Castiel possibly phrase the question that was burning so hard on his soul That prevented him from seeing anything else that Cupid was sure was hidden inside of him? - "What about my immortality? Once someone is marked by a Cupid, there is only that one person and it is irreversible. His life-- it's like the blink of an eye. Not even a fraction of my existence" - castiel was silent. It was difficult for him to ask this question. After all, it would only confirm what Cupid had been talking about all along. That Castiel had feelings for Dean that went far beyond the platonic aspect. But Cupid was also silent, waiting for Castiel to finally ask the decisive question. - "What will I do when he's gone?" - Cupid sighed deeply. For even though he knew the question was coming, he still hoped it would not come to him. - "This is something beyond my control. It is entirely up to you" - "What is up to me? The decision whether I suffer the rest of my existence after his death or dagger myself right away?" - Castiel seemed displeased with that vague answer. And Cupid understood. He knew how Castiel felt. After all, he had had this discussion hundreds of times before. and he knew that castiel was simply terrified, even if the angels would never admit it. But he was afraid of losing this person who meant so much to him. Because Castiel was right. Unlike the lifespan of an angel, a human being's was almost insignificant. Like a breeze moving as fast as he came. And he was sure this must feel unbearable.
This thing with Castiel and Balthazar gave him no peace. Above all, the thought of the 50,000 people who were now all not born, as Castiel had said, did not let him go. They had not 'died' in the actual sense. But much worse about it was that this was not even true. It was something they liked to tell themselves. But people had very well died in the process. Like Ellen and Jo. And Dean didn't want to think about how many more of them there were. People who lived normal lives. They died because their time had simply come and this cursed ship made it dependent on when this time was. Because with the decision to let the Titianic sink, he had killed Ellen and Jo. This thought made anger rise in him and full of rage, he called Castiel's name. Called him to him without really knowing why. What should he say once this angel was in front of him? Should he blame him for it? Dean didn't know. But it was clear that Dean had to vent his anger somehow. And then there was Castiel. His usual monotonous expression on his face, he greeted him.
"How can you act as if nothing has happened? You just killed thousands of people! These people you're supposed to be protecting!" Dean spoke when he noticed that Castiel was as clueless as ever. And he turned back to him. Still with the same pain in his eyes, which Dean usually tried to hide and yet put Castiel into turmoil again every time - only on the inside, of course. On the outside, he watched him calmly and with an expressionless look on his face. He tried to analyze the feelings Dean was having. And how could it have been otherwise than that it was about the people of the Titanic? Already when Castiel explained the situation to them, he had seen exactly that pain in his eyes that told him that he was blaming himself for something again. That he felt responsible for what had happened. And that was the very last thing Castiel wanted. And he wanted many things. He wanted to end this terrible war between the angels. He wanted his father back who told him what to do and so much more. But hurting Dean - That was the last thing Castiel had intended.
So Castiel's worst fear had come true. He could no longer deny it or tell himself it wasn't true, because he had now heard it from Dean's mouth. And the pain he felt at that made him lower his eyelids and turn his gaze toward the ground.  He still kept his head up, too proud to show his pain too obviously, and still didn't manage to keep looking at Dean. But in spite of everything, Dean walked up to him, not the slightest idea of the chaos that was going on inside this angel, who usually seemed so controlled and composed, and put his hands on his shoulders. Made Castiel look at him again, although everything inside him resisted. Nevertheless, he looked at those green, unfathomable eyes, which looked at him with a warmth that Castiel had not understood long ago. But now he knew what they meant. And though it was not what he had longed for, he appreciated it. Because it was more than he had ever dared to dream. And Castiel nodded, the hint of a smile on his face.
"So you noticed," Castiel heard a strange voice from the darkness without seeing anyone. He placed himself under the only cone of light there was in the immediate vicinity and looked around again, searching. He could sense it, but could not make out from which direction it came. He could only hope that the angel would show himself. - "You didn't try hard to hide either," Castiel replied as he continued to look around. - "Why are you following me? What do you want?" - Castiel's voice was calm and deep. It was all you could hear in that remote place. Not even the sound of a cricket daring to interrupt the tangible tension that had built up around Castiel. And then the stranger emerged from the darkness. He was tall, with greying hair and a suit like the Winchesters used to wear when they would pretend to be FBI agents. - "The question is rather what you want," he heard a second time the stranger's voice, who now stepped into the beam of light and smiled friendly. Much too friendly for a situation like this, as Cas thought. And almost as if to greet him, the stranger now reached out his hand to him, but revealed the palm of his hand instead, thus making Castiel understand why he was really here. And Cas understood.
It was deepest night when the door to the bunker slowly swung open with a squeaking sound. Castiel stepped out into the cool night air. All alone, he stood outside the bunker as the door closed again. Concentrated, he looked around. Not that he could really see anything in this darkness. Only a single lantern shone on the dirt road he was standing on. A single spot of lit earth surrounded by total darkness. For long, Castiel had felt persecuted. Ever since he helped Dean on his last assignment and then rode here with him in the Impala. And there was something troubling him. Not even really the fact that someone or something was after them, much more the fact that he could clearly feel its presence. The presence of an angel.
"Do you ever have a different record on?" it came out pressed between Dean's lips and he had to turn away from Castiel for a moment. He couldn't look at him any longer. It hurt far too much to know what that damn angel would do for him. Even though Dean was sure that he himself wasn't even worth all that. What was so much more significant about his life than anyone else's. Ellen's and Jo's? - Agonized, he closed his eyes, escaping the questioning look Castiel gave him. - "How can you be like this, Cas?" - Dean's voice sounded pained. As pained as he felt right now. There wasn't an ounce of anger left in his voice, and yet Castiel suspected that it was still simmering very close to the surface. And although Castiel was aware of all this, he did not know what it all meant. What gave Dean reason to be so agitated and angry? Castiel just tilted his head, as he always did when he couldn't follow what his counterpart was saying. With the slight fear of saying something wrong in the background. He knew how energetic Dean was about things he said or did. And he didn't want to do anything right now that could further his negative feelings.
Again Cupid had read his thoughts and so had taken the burden of the words from him. These many words that wanted to come out, tried to form questions and in the end disappeared again in the depths of his thoughts. And Cupid looked at him with a steady gaze, taking in every tiny emotion that Castiel even thought to show. And it was there. The big knot in Castiel's stomach that hurt so much and made him feel sick. That lay so heavy, on all the sensations that were still far too much for an angel. - "But what if I can't go back?" - Was it despair? In his rough voice, the deep furrows between his eyebrows and in that glassy blue? Cupid could not remember ever observing such a look in an angel. - "As I said, it's all up to you. It is your responsibility to make a decision" - Cupid turned away from Castiel again. Moved again further towards the shadows which he came closer and closer and very slowly seemed to swallow the black of his suit more and more to finally become one with the Cupid. - "But much more important is the question: what is this between the two of you? Because who knows? Maybe all this thinking is just a waste of time. Maybe Dean will fall in love with a beautiful woman, put a whole soccer team into the world and then die happily and contentedly at ninety of old age" - With a smile which he threw to Castiel over his shoulder he disappeared into the darkness, giving the angel no more chance to answer his question. And so Castiel now stood alone in front of the bunker with all his confused thoughts. He stood rigidly there, not moving a millimeter and still looking at the point where Cupid had been standing just a blink of an eye ago.
"And that is why God sent me. Castiel, God wants to give you a gift. Something that only man can have. Something to help you find your true place in this universe. Because he sees how lost you are. How much self-doubt you have inside of you. He wants to give you a home" - Cupid had done it again. He'd been snooping around in his mind, seeing Castiel's greatest fear. the fear of being alone one day. Because without the Winchesters, where did he belong? and he wasn't at home on Earth. He was lost between all those dimensions. And God saw that. God had sent Cupid to finally give him a place where he belonged.
"Thank you, Dean. I'm glad to know that I'm not alone in this feeling, when it's so strange for me to feel this way about someone other than my true siblings" - And Castiel meant it as he said it, even if it was hard for him to keep the smile he gave Dean. But he did it to keep him from worrying. Dean should never worry about him. - "Family doesn't stop at blood," Dean quoted, Bobby proudly, patting Castiel on the shoulder again and then taking a few steps away from him. He knew all this was far from over. The sinking of the Titanic and what Castiel had done still stuck deep in his bones, but he couldn't help but have some sympathy for Castiel. Because if he was honest with himself, he would not have acted differently if it had been about Sam - which it had indirectly - or about Castiel. And Dean had to admit to himself that maybe he wasn't necessarily in the position to blame Castiel for that. Even if he still needed the time to let it all sink in. - "I've got to go now. I picked up something on the angel radio" - And without another word he was gone. Castiel had rudely snapped Dean out of his thoughts and hadn't even waited for an answer before disappearing with a fluttering sound. Everything as always, Dean realized morosely. - "We really need to discuss the way he says goodbye again," Dean muttered to himself and made his way back to the house. Always haunted by the feeling that something hadn't gone the way it was supposed to. Castiel was weird. Weirder than usual. And Dean wondered if maybe he had said something wrong.
Restlessly, Dean paced back and forth. After Sam and he had made sure Bobby was okay and couldn't remember any of the things that had happened that were still more than present in their own minds, he had gone back outside. Had left Sam alone in the kitchen to get some fresh air. It had taken some time for the whole extent of this situation to fully sink in, and it had nearly knocked him off his feet. And now he found himself here. At the entrance to Bobby's house, in front of which he was pacing like a tiger, agitated.
Sam closed the laptop, which pulled Dean out of his thoughts and brought him uncomfortably back to the present. He met his brother's gaze, which seemed to have been staring at him for quite some time. - "The real question is, what haven't you done wrong?" - Sam paused for a moment that Dean was sure was merely for dramatic purposes. If this situation weren't obscure enough, he might have laughed at his brother's constant clichéd manner. But no sound would leave his throat. Maybe because he was just too exhausted for that? Because all he could do was frown again and give Sam a skeptical look before he started talking. - "First you harassed him, then you didn't let him finish, and last but not least, you really hurt him" - Their eye contact didn't break. Although Dean had never felt more uncomfortable with it than he did right now. Because he had done what he always tried to avoid. And yet he was the same idiot with the same mistakes every time. He hurt Castiel over and over again every time. - "Hurt? With what?" - And yet he couldn't turn this rotten feeling he had to the outside. Never would he openly show his brother that it weighed like a heavy stone on his chest that Sam had now stated the obvious. - "Dude, you friend zoned him"- Dean shook his head slightly. - "Friend- what?" - "Friend zoned. Are you really that stupid or don't you get it?" - Of course he didn't understand. He never understood anything related to Castiel before. Whenever it was about this angel he was paralyzed. His brain could not make clear connections. Maybe that was exactly why he was such a complete idiot around him every time. - "Man, Cas was trying to confess his feelings to you" - Sam had always suspected something and still held back. His brother should figure out for himself that Castiel was more to him than a brother, just like he had said himself. Because Sam was sure that there was more to it even if Dean didn't admit it. But he was the one with eyes open, after all. He could see how they looked at each other, even if the other didn't see it. And how they treated each other. No brothers behaved like that. But when would Dean finally understand that? At the time when Sam broke his rule not to tell Dean about it, he should understand what it was between them. At least Sam hoped so. - "What do you mean by feelings? You don't mean-" - And yet Dean questioned his words. Almost as if he didn't want to admit it. But Sam was sure it caused his brother's heart to pound. He shifted slightly uneasily in his chair. Sam was sure they were words of insecurity. - " Yes, Dean, exactly that! And I can assure you that it has nothing at all to do with brotherly love" - Quite closely he watched his brother, who again rubbed his face in a nervous manner. - "Oh shit" - Was that despair? Rejection? Or the much longed for realization Sam heard out of it? But he couldn't get through to Dean. He didn't know what he was thinking or what he was thinking of doing about it now. And he didn't know that Dean had no idea either. He stared into space, past his brother, trying to process somehow that Castiel - his favorite angel - was probably really in love with him. And Dean couldn't deny that he also had special feelings for Castiel. But could this already be called love? If in Castiel's presence his pulse sped up immediately? Or when his stomach turned when he saw Castiel getting into fights again, whether he got hurt or not? Or that he couldn't help touching him? That whenever he came in contact with that cursed angel, it was like a burning trail across his skin? Dean didn't know. But what was certain was that the fact that Castiel probably liked him more than a brother scared him off less than it should.
Thoughtfully, he walked into the kitchen, where he found Sam remarkably more focused, staring at his laptop. His gaze grew more sullen and he looked at his brother, who still didn't turn his head toward him. Although he noticed quite clearly that Dean had entered the room. - "You were eavesdropping" - Sam squinted over at him. - "I don't know what you're talking about" - "Don't pretend. You were eavesdropping on my conversation with Cas at the door. You're still breathing unevenly from your run from the door to here" - Sam laughed playfully, visibly caught, and leaned back in his chair, now fully facing his brother. - "Pff! As if I- Why would I-" - Dean practically stabbed him with his gaze. His brow furrowed deeply, and from every pore he radiated that he wasn't buying this for a second from Sam. And Sam knew there was no way he could deny it. He had always been a miserable liar. - "All right. Maybe I've got a thing or two coming," he admitted now, watching his brother's every move, who was now sighing in his direction before dropping heavily into the chair. - "Go on! Speak up. What did I do wrong again?" - Tired, Dean rubbed his face. This had clearly been far too long a day and he prayed it would end soon. Actually, he hadn't had the strength to stay on his feet for a while. But Castiel was weird and Dean knew that he was somehow partly to blame. He couldn't and wouldn't put it off. A bad feeling told him that this could have serious consequences. But maybe he was wrong and this feeling only arose in him because he had never been able to stand it when there was such a thick air between him and Castiel. He hated the crackling in the air between them when they stared each other down, because each of them hoped that the other would finally give in. And that queasy feeling in his stomach when he saw that disappointed and hurt look in his eyes that told him every time that this was all his fault. It caused something in him that was very close to the feeling of nausea. But openly, of course, Dean would never admit that.
For some time he stood helplessly in front of the house entrance. He tried to muster up all his remaining courage and finally dared to open his mouth. Hoping that not too much bullshit left his throat, he began to talk. - "Um- Hey, Cas. I think our conversation didn't go the way it was supposed to. That's why I'd like to talk to you again. So that- You know- Everything-" Dean spoke into the void until just then when he suddenly became aware of the familiar fluttering sound of wings. He stopped and turned in the direction he thought Castiel was heading. - "Hello, Dean" - Still it was like every other conversation they had. It was always the same. He called him, Castiel came, had that hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth, and then looked at him, waiting. With a piercing look that made Dean feel naked every time. Sometimes he really believed Castiel could see inside him with those deep blue eyes. Right into his black and torn soul. - "Hey, Cas" - And yet, something was different this time. Maybe the knowledge that everything between them would change with this conversation? Dean thought about it intensely. Because what exactly would really change between them? - "You wanted to talk?" - Shaking off his thoughts that had kept him from speaking for far too long, Dean cleared his throat in a quick breath. He took another step toward Castiel - "Um, yeah" - Another brief silence. Dean eyed Castiel, trying to read some emotion from his facial expressions. Some feeling of pain or longing. Just something. But he was, as always, a closed book. Still, Dean felt confirmed in what he was doing when he looked into those incredible blue eyes and noticed that twinkle he wasn't sure what it was. But it encouraged him to keep talking. - "I had a feeling somehow that there was something that was left unsaid" - Castiel didn't seem to understand. He frowned and tilted his head a little to the side. - "I just had a conversation with Sam. It was about our conversation, and in it he made it clear to me that I had wronged you. I wanted to tell you-" - Yeah, what did he want to tell him, anyway? - "You-" - Dean faltered. Should he really be doing this? And while this question shot through his head like a mantra, all at once all his courage left him. The man who had defied the devil, prevented the apocalypse, and fearlessly fought even dragons, was suddenly afraid to stand by his feelings? Had he landed in an alternative world again? Was this another one of those terribly twisted dreams? - "Cas, what I feel for you-" - Dean had to break off. Because he didn't know himself what he was trying to say. After all, he didn't know what he felt either. Was it deep friendship? Commitment to him? Was it a simple crush? Or could he claim to really love Castiel? Not just a little bit. Not just halfway. But sincerely and with everything he had. Because he could never call anything else love. Because love was nothing else.
"Cas! Where have you been?" - Sam could only roll his eyes at the question. Sometimes his older brother really did act like a twelve-year-old when it came to Castiel. Or worse, a controlling wife. But secretly Sam grinned to himself, also sat down at the table to devote himself to his book again and listened to the conversation unnoticed. - "Outside. Get some air" - That Castiel tried the same trick on Dean surprised Sam a bit. He had actually thought Cas would learn. After all, it had not worked with him, so he could have come up with something better for Dean. But Castiel had also realized his mistake at that very moment when he saw the wrinkles on Dean's forehead, which were slowly getting deeper and deeper. - "When you disappeared, it sounded like something more serious" - Now it was Castiel who looked questioningly. There was no denying that the two were brothers through and through. They had the same way of thinking and that had already brought Castiel in the one or other trouble, but also often enough the brothers themselves. But not to worry Dean further, he didn't go into it this time and rather sat down with the Winchesters as well. Surprisingly, Dean seemed to be satisfied with the outcome of this conversation. Now there was silence in the whole bunker, which Castiel didn't know exactly what to do with. Should he break it and say something? Was it okay to just sit here and be silent? As he had so often lately, Castiel cursed himself and his shortcomings. He would never admit it, but these situations triggered something in him that humans would probably call nervousness. What it really was, however, Castiel couldn't say. So he just sat there, trying not to stare too obviously in Dean's direction. For some reason, Castiel felt like he was really looking at Dean for the very first time. That dark blond hair that had grown a little longer in the last few years. That deep green of his eyes and its lids that stared squinted at the screen. The three-day beard that made Dean look a little bolder than he already was in combination with the three flannel shirts he always wore. In all that time, Dean hadn't changed a bit. When Castiel looked at him, he still saw this 29-year-old hunter in front of him. In his worn leather jacket and the much too self-convinced grin. But today, of all days, Dean seemed like a completely different person to him. With his late thirties, the even more striking facial features, the voice that sounded from time to time deeper and rougher, that Castiel almost got goose bumps from it. The slight wrinkles around his eyes that became more and more visible. Castiel knew that people aged and he also knew that it would be no different with the Winchesters. But now that he looked at Dean like this, he almost felt sick at the thought that Dean had already lived much of his life. And with their life style, no one knew how much they actually had left. Castiel felt like he was running out of time. As fast as sand through his fingers into nothingness.
"All right," the words suddenly echo through the bunker, followed by a dull thud that jolted Castiel out of his thoughts. - "I'll hit the hay" - Sam had stood up, his folded up book tucked under his arm and moved his chair neatly back to the table. - "What hay?", Castiel could only ask in irritation, because once again he didn't understand this reference. Why should one hit some hay? Was this some kind of game again? And most importantly, where did all the hay come from? But he didn't get an answer to that.  Just an amused shaking head before Sam wished them a good night and then disappeared towards the bedrooms. - "Night Sammy," Dean called after him, without taking his eyes off his laptop or even looking at the confused Castiel, who wondered what was wrong with his question. But silence continued. None of them said anything until Dean risked a little glance and looked at Castiel from the side. He didn't seem to notice, because he still looked stubbornly - almost strained - straight ahead and didn't move a muscle. He did not even blink and that made Dean once again clear that it wasn't even necessary. Because Castiel was an angel. All the things he did himself, the things he had to do, were nothing more than dispensable for Cas.  And yet Dean thought he saw something like exhaustion in Castiel. - "You look pretty beat. Is everything all right?" - Castiel didn't seem to have expected to be addressed, because he took a moment too long to answer, in Dean's opinion. Almost as if he had to think about what to say. - "Yeah, the last few days have just been pretty restless. I'm enjoying the quiet. Who knows how long it will last"- Knowing their luck, Dean was sure it wouldn't last very long. But he was glad for the answer. So Castiel could find peace here. That made Dean almost a little proud. And happy. But he would never admit that. - "Would you like- well you're welcome to rest in my room. Another bed isn't made up right now, I'm afraid, but you're welcome to take a nap in mine" - Castiel eyed Dean for a moment. Maybe he had just imagined it, but he just thought he heard something like embarrassment in his voice. But he didn't know for what reason that should have been, so he immediately dismissed that thought. But still there was something in Dean's looks, even if it only streaked him. Something he could not define. Something he wondered if it had always been there. - "Angels don't sleep, Dean" - And there it was again. Castiel's inability to simply accept a well-intentioned gesture without constantly speaking his rational thoughts out loud. - "Ah, yeah, sure. I just thought you'd like to get some rest, but you don't even feel exhaustion. Angles, huh?" - Dean seemed embarrassed but also a bit contrite. As if it became clear to him for the very first time that Castiel wasn't human. Or maybe again? - "Besides, where are you sleeping then?" - Dean seemed surprised by this question, and if he was honest with himself, he hadn't thought about it when he offered Castiel his bed. Maybe the whole thing was a little too thoughtless after all. - "I- um- wanted to stay up for a while. Look for a new case. And anyway, I'm not tired at all. So if you'd like-" - Dean left the sentence unfinished, thinking he had saved the conversation yet, and then saw Castiel shaking his head. - "No thanks. But I am very grateful that you are so concerned about my well-being" - Castiel smiled. But not that put-on smile. It was sincere, it was gentle. And it made Dean look away immediately, bashfully, as he noticed his ears starting to get hot. Which was definitely not Castiel's fault! Quickly he cleared his throat - "Of course I care, we are a family" - Dean looked again strained at his laptop while Castiel smiled into himself. Because finally he understood. All the times they had saved each other, healed their wounds and stood by each other. All the time they spent together in the forever shabby motels or inside the Impala, in that bunker. And all the looks they shared whenever they happened to meet and more. - "Why are you laughing?" - "Because I am happy to share with you such a special kind of bond" - Castiel had spoken without thinking about how his words probably sounded. But he didn't need to, because this was Dean. He could be honest with him, even if he had already missed those opportunities often enough. But this one was going to be different. This was something Castiel didn't want to miss. - "Cas, that sounds pretty-" Dean seemed momentarily at a loss for words. He just looked Castiel in the face while searching for the right adjective. - "Gay" - And he' d probably found it. - "Is that bad?" - Castiel didn't really understand what to make of that statement, maybe Dean wouldn't even explain it to him. - "No, but-" - Dean seemed to be searching for words again, not quite sure how to explain it to Castiel in a way that made sense. - "We're men. This between us is a manly thing. Manly men don't say things like that" - For Castiel's taste, this explanation was a bit too- manly? It seemed like Dean was talking out of his mind and didn't quite know what he was trying to say.
"He wants to give you someone who loves you. And not in the way that your brothers and sisters should love you, or people's idea of angels. Not even the way God loves you. He wants to give you one of His children who loves you because you are the way you are. Because you make him laugh and because you make him cry. Who loves you more than anything and who is behind you no matter what decision you make. Who loves you more than God." - That was his definition of home? To give him a human being as you gave a slave? Castiel could not allow that. Never let a person be struck by Cupid's arrow because God wanted to do him a favor. It wouldn't be the same as actually loving someone. - "But it wouldn't be real" - "Why? If you're soul mates" - "Then it's still wrong I know enough about people now to know that the most important thing for them is freedom It would be like cheating, no, even forcing, if I said yes If this person really exists, he will find me of his own accord and not because you made him so" - There was silence between them. And while Cupid looked at the angel before him with an almost analytical look, Castiel did not break off either. He stubbornly looked him in the eye, making clear the seriousness of his words and the fact that he could never change his mind. Because he said everything exactly the way he meant it. He could never forgive himself if he allowed a person to be deprived of his freedom in this way. The freedom to love whoever they wanted.
"Then why? What is your purpose?" - The mistrust in Castiel grew immeasurably. He wouldn't call it fear, but he couldn't deny it troubled him. He worried about what was coming. What God had chosen him for. - "For once, this is completely unselfish" - Confused, Castiel blinked. he wasn't sure if what cupid said was right, though he didn't understand it yet. He didn't understand what Cupid was trying to say as his brow furrowed. He was getting tired of this conversation going on and on without getting close to the real reason for his appearance.
He didn't know how to deal with this new or not-so-new situation, but he knew Castiel felt the same way. Neither of them had ever been good at this, and yet something had happened between them that neither of them had seen coming. And unable to say anything, Dean just nodded. For the final confirmation Castiel had been needing, Dean merely held the door open for him in the direction of the corridor that ultimately led to his bedroom. And Castiel started walking. He led the way, knowing where Dean's bedroom was, which should make Dean feel uncomfortable. Because Castiel really seemed to know absolutely everything about him, and he had also allowed him to watch him sleep through the night. But that was not the case, it was that fact that really scared him. Not because he was afraid of Castiel. Dean felt deep inside that something just changed between them, something big, something important. And knowing that neither Castiel nor himself could stop it made him nervous. Because what could he do? All he could really do was let it come to him, however crazy that was going to be. And the moment he entered his bedroom after Castiel and closed the door behind him, his fate was finally sealed. He was here alone with this angel that he didn't know if he was really even more angel than human. But it made Dean smile. Because no matter what he was, he was still Cas. And therefore this thought also drove away any worry about what was still to come. Because he felt again this security, this safety, which Castiel's aura brought with itself. But maybe it only had an effect on him. Maybe this aura existed only for Dean. He had to admit to himself, it was a nice thought. All those nice thoughts broke off, however, when Dean watched Castiel sit down purposefully on the armchair next to the bed, which made Dean stand in the room indecisively for another moment. There was something so strange about this situation - as familiar as it was - that it made him nervous all over again. And even though Castiel had already been at his bedside in countless motels, Dean in particular didn't know what to do with himself right now. So he tried to maintain his routine as best he could. He went into the adjoining bathroom, got ready for bed - for a longer time than he actually needed for it - and then went back to the bedroom. Cursing himself more and more for his nervousness, he walked towards his bed, knowing full well that there was nothing to be afraid of. That there in his bedroom was just Cas. His best friend. The most important being in his life. There was never going to be a time when he was afraid of anything in Castiel's presence, with him by his side. Because Castiel was with him. He always had been. He would always remain so.
"I have to go now" - Dean nodded. - "If there's anything, just call for me" - "I thought you were busy?" - Castiel seemed embarrassed by this remark, because he tilted his head briefly. But then thought better of it and looked Dean firmly in the eyes again. - "By now it should be clear what my priorities are" - Suddenly there was a crackle in the air that Dean was sure Castiel didn't notice. But he did notice it. He knew it was the opportunity. Now he just had to tell Castiel what he felt. Even if he wasn't so sure about it himself yet. Dean felt the need to reach for his neck, hoping to break the chain that held him captive. That prevented him from doing what was right. From telling Castiel how he felt. How he felt about him. That he shouldn't leave. That he should never leave Dean again. That it hurt when he wasn't there. That it burned inside Dean and those flames just wouldn't stop destroying him from the inside out when Castiel wasn't there. When he was angry at him. When he punished him with a look that radiated disappointment. When he looked at him as if he were a nobody, a stranger. When he didn't look at him with those bright eyes that flashed the affection that only Dean could see, because it was only there when he looked at Dean. That Castiel was everything to him. That he was crazy, a complete idiot for not realizing all this much sooner. That he hated himself for letting so much time pass without perceiving Castiel. Perceived him as he really was. The way he was just for Dean with everything he had. With everything he was, he wanted him. And he wanted Castiel to want him too. Like he had never wanted anything before. And he was finally going to say all of that. In a fit of madness and fear he should throw these words at Castiel's head so that he finally understood that everything he said before was complete bullshit. Because he was a good-for-nothing idiot. Because he was afraid of all what was, what is and what could be between them. He should finally open his mouth! Because if he didn't now, then- - "Okay" - And with that, Castiel was gone again. The chain around his body gave way, collapsing link by link, falling silently to the dust-covered floor, visible to no one but Dean. Dean had lost his chance. He had the chance to come clean with Castiel. To take away his insecurity, his disappointment. But he did nothing. He had kept all this to himself because he was too cowardly to admit it. Because he was afraid that this could be real between them. Because Dean didn't know how to deal with the feeling of affection and fear - even the fear for Castiel - once it was there. If he let it all happen, nothing would ever be the same again. There was no turning back. If he let Castiel get to him then he was lost. - Dean only hoped that Sam was not right and Castiel did something stupid.
“I want to lie down on the bed with our clothes on and hold you in my arms — but I must tell you I’ve no desire for sex. I hope you’re okay with that,” Castiel said. “I’m sorry I scared you with my grace.”
“I’d like you to think about your masculinity in something other than societal terms,” Castiel said painfully.
“Relax,” Dean said. “You’re hired.” He sat at the other end of the couch from Castiel as they watched and Castiel, who’d been hoping to at least sit next to Dean, was a little disappointed.
“Dean,” Castiel whispered.
The top floor of the house, except for pathways cleared between the bathroom and bedrooms, and the main floor except for pathways cleared between, kitchen, sofa and front door, were both entirely stuffed with boxes, storage containers, furniture and an assortment of stacked and random items which would usually be characterized as ‘useless junk’.
“So,” Dean said.
“Dean, trust me, I’m not asexual,” Castiel ground out. He rolled his eyes. There was no profit to be had in telling Dean what he would want to do with him if they were ever — miracle of miracles — in the same bed together.
Dean sighed heavily. “It involves my mental health.”
subject the English language to.”
“Like what?”
The dark haired man said nothing, merely looked beseechingly at Pam. She was pale under her makeup, and seemed shaky.
Castiel had thought at the time, amused how Dean’s presence drove off his misgivings and his way of riding superstitious spirals of speculation into emotionally dark places. “Not deep enough for stitches, but you’re going to have to knock it off for a couple of days. Check it out! it’s Friday night, so that works.”
“It’s a bug. I can’t believe it, an electronic bug, nothing magical or enchanted or — it’s just a bug.”
“I dunno. You’re showing that you trust me. And you trust me enough to kiss me in front of a live studio audience FUCK YOU NAOMI! and — confidential to Jimmy Novak! — FUCK YOU TOO!”
“You’re fired.”
The man stared at Dean for almost the whole elevator ride.
“It totally is,” Castiel said. Being confident with a sexual partner — who knew?
“Can I start calling you Dean?”
Sam’s voice got noticeably louder and squeakier. “Dean, if angels other than Castiel are trying to break through into the bunker we have a serious problem.”
“Winchester, for the love of all that’s—“
“No,” Dean said. He didn’t sound mad any more. He sounded bored. That made Castiel’s mind up. “Oh, I think perhaps you think I was a little more than disrespectful.” He stood.
“I was trying to be funny,” Castiel said in a very stiff voice, very unlike how he’d sounded earlier. “If I accepted that you calling me pompous was gentle teasing, then I thought I could respond in kind.”
“Undesirable.”
“The job will be done in the next couple of weeks, Dean, I don’t want to get used to being driven around in style when I’m going to be taking transit wherever I end up working.”
“To know that for sure I’d have to put my tongue in your mouth,” Castiel said.
He did seem nice. Well-spoken and now that he was sitting closer, very attractive. He made eye contact, which instead of being irritating or scary, as it usually felt, it was — Castiel tried to think of the word. Friendly. And compelling, somehow, without being overwhelming. That felt weird in and of itself.
“I have no idea what to watch. I only watch cooking shows, the news and documentaries on cable,” Castiel said. “And I only got cable because Gabe said he’d never visit me if I didn’t get it.”
“Can I see?” Castiel said. He was texting Charlie.
Cas’s eyebrows continued the upward momentum. “Really.”
He’d been kind. He’d offered him a job. Castiel then overthought that. Maybe the job was something disgusting, like ripping up flooring. Maybe Dean was just trying to get him over there to assault and murder him.
“Kissing you isn’t unpleasant, it’s just not what I expected to be doing this morning!” Dean, trying to fly the conversation casual-like.
well now you know
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel said. He didn’t sound disgusted; he sounded really sad. He turned to him. “When did it start?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean said.
“Dean,” he said soothingly. “It will get better. Maybe you can tell me what about this makes you so upset.”
you doing about that other thing? You’re forty, right? My bro was always going on about time’s wingèd chariot and, man, it’s gaining on you.”
Leaving it affectionate but non-sexual was manageable. The second Dean kissed him he’d be screwed, although maybe not literally. He now suspected that Castiel’s loyalty would take shape, if they ever got naked, as a rather spectacular form of sexual pliancy. It was easy to imagine he’d do anything Dean asked him to, such was his guilt over not being able to save his One True Dean over in the other universe. That made the ‘if’ of getting naked a damned big if, and damned scary if, and a damned compelling if.
“Sorry,” Castiel said. The wings, black as space with a metallic blue shine when the light caught them just so, were gone. The tears were gone. He seemed to be having no emotions at all. Or words, for that matter.
easy. “Not if Naomi is watching. Not if anybody is watching, to tell ya the truth.”
“Your intergenerational trauma is your problem.”
“No. No, I
Dean was trying very hard not to laugh at Castiel’s exasperation. “What, no goats, no giant dildos, no watersports?”
“Poorer relations?” Dean asked, unerringly picking out the sorest point of that description.
“I got that you think I’m a coward. Do I have to put a label on myself?”
Now both of the brothers were laughing, but it was fine. Castiel smiled at them both; Dean would explain the joke later, after they found and destroyed Heaven’s little electronic spies.
Dean humphed. “You’ve been busy.”
Castiel thanked God most sincerely that his back was currently to Dean. “If you mean have I been indulging in lots of consequence-free sex, I’m going to have to remind you that I’m still your employee.”
It’s always something. Absolute best is jacking it outside, leaving my troubles behind so to speak.”
, and he would have said so aloud, but that was just picking a fight with a hurting angel, not a good plan.
“Because it was fuckin’ hi
The lube was cold, and Dean shivered. Castiel ran a pacifying hand down Dean’s flank. He pushed a finger into Dean’s ass and Dean moaned.
for it. Words can’t express how much I loathed it.”
“No,” Castiel said. “Nor would you abandon me without fighting with all you had.”
Dean shrugged. “At the very least, but I bet they're everywhere. Hope they enjoyed my lotion choices.”
Castiel said, “I am so sorry. I only like one of my siblings, but at least I know where even the ones I hate are.”
“Okay,” Castiel said. He was folding Dean’s business card over and over in his hands.
“It’s Castiel.”
“Dean, I’m serious.”
“What the hell are you doing wearing your body again?”
“Dean, what’s wrong.”
He sounded beseeching. “Why? Why the fuck would you do this?”
“For social anxiety,” Dean scoffed.
“Naomi must be thrilled when you make it so easy for her,” Castiel remarked.
“Okay,” Castiel said. He sat and ate in silence as he’d been commanded.
“Okay,” he finally said in a shy voice, nothing like how he’d sounded with Dr. Barnes.
“I was scared,” he said finally.
Dean often texted him while he was waiting at the bus stop, so he turned his phone off. When he remembered to turn it back on the next morning at six, to his horror there was a text from Gabe, saying simply CHEESE IT THE COPS and that meant the inspector was coming and he had to get out of his ‘under renovation’ condo. There were a bunch of texts from Dean, but he ignored them.
“Hope they were worth it, and everything came out okay,” Dean said before he could stop himself. He chuckled at his own coarseness.
“After your dad went to jail, and Bobby and Mary started living together.”
Remembering how lack of lube had made his first time memorably ugly, Castiel didn’t skimp, and he took care to make sure Dean was feeling okay with another finger before he added any more.
“No, it sure’s shit isn’t. Are you looking for work?”
“You just blushed, I wonder what the hell you’re thinking about,” Dean teased.
“Thank you.”
“I knew I could trust you to find my tiny act of vengeance against my family ‘a sweet gig’, Castiel said, rolling his eyes a little. “Anyway, I’ve got a piece of paper signed by my mother saying I can live there, and that little bit of chicanery was also arranged by Gabe, so if you set aside that the signature was illegally obtained, which my mother likely wouldn’t corroborate in public anyway, it’s all perfectly legal.”
The man nodded.
“No. I had no role models! I had no way to shape my behaviour. I very rarely met someone new that I could share my feelings with. I was bitterly criticized for being anything but decisive and emotionless. I couldn’t read anything or watch anything that hadn’t been approved by my mother or my oldest brother Michael.”
“You know how to drive and you never got a license.”
“What? You’ll do it?”
Over the next year, things got more and more tense, and finally he reached the age of majority, eighteen in Missouri, and he left without saying goodbye or letting us know where he was going.”
“Ha. You’ll see.” Dean gave his address on Genesee, and Castiel figured out how to get there by bus from his apartment on Harrison, and arrived half an hour early. It was only 45 minutes, and Google Maps said it was a 75 minute walk, so if he was feeling ambitious, and if Dean actually hired him, it was all quite manageable.
“No porn in the shower… no automatic cleanup on aisle three in bed.
“Okay,” Dean acknowledged.
“What’s to talk about?”
Dean put their noses together and said quietly, “Not so great?”
The daily reunion had been quite amazing for him. It was okay to feel this way. It was important that he not reveal his feelings or he’d be out of a job, but that was okay in its way too. He was enjoying his own feelings enough that he didn’t even feel it necessary to be unhappy that Dean wouldn’t return them — if he ever knew about them.
“What’s Nutella?” Castiel asked. “Is it something good?”
The response to the question was almost a growl.
“I didn’t think I’d ever admit to being bi,” Dean countered.
“We can stop,” Dean said.
After he got off the phone, Dean joined him in the basement. The stairs were practically blocked, and apart from a path to the furnace and the hot water heater and the sump pump and the stacked washer/dryer, the basement was bung-full to the rafters. It was, candidly, almost scary.
“And? Anything else I should be aware of?” Sam said sarcastically.
“I’m up early,” Dean warned.
Dean hadn’t survived a trying and violent life by being unable to think both tactically and strategically. And wasn’t the War Against Heaven over? or was this yet another stupid angel ploy to try to get intel?
“A handkerchief may be used for many more things than tears.”
“Don’t worry, there are lots more where they came from. I’ll have to get a copy of Brokeback Mountain for you if you really want gay content.”
Castiel said, “Your Jimmy from this Heaven wants to control this vessel and speak to you.” He sat still, gasping a little.
“Closeted is a label,” Castiel said. “I’m sorry I was so judgmental. I’m sure there are lots of other closeted men who’d be thrilled to have sex with you from time to time.”
Castiel looked around. Dean hadn’t just lost his wife and child — he’d lost four family members in a single year. It was no longer a ‘mental health project’; it was something he could be proud to do.
“Yeah, ‘cause I’d do anything you asked of me and I didn’t want you gettin’ ideas.”
“So, I guess, there’s guilt,” the dark haired man said.
The two men rose and filed out of the room.
“Castiel, I am a total fucking perv. I’ve either done it or thought about it. I trust you, I trust us. You will not abandon me. You will be angry or hurt but you won’t abandon me.”
So he looked at his entertainment options and said
“No rimming? no face-fucking? no prostate play? Sheesh.”
“Whatever works,” Dean said dismissively. “C’mon, Cas, give with the details. I figure if you know all the anatomical details of bees, gay sex would be a snap.”
He let the unsaid words hang in the air between them for a minute, and then howled with laughter at his brother’s expression. Castiel poked his head into the library.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” Castiel said into his bowl. The smell wafting up from the chili was so good.
“I’d be dead without Charlie,” Dean said.
Castiel, sitting at Dean’s table and eating Dean’s food and on Dean’s payroll and on a Dean-managed schedule which was very much to his liking, felt his hungry stomach drop six inches.
“Speaking of which, I’ll take the boxes you packed up to the post office on Monday.”
“Yeah,” Dean breathed.
“My job here is nowhere close to done,” Castiel said gloomily.
“So…” Dean said, “No more Pam.”
Castiel choked down his breakfast and gathered his backpack and left while Dean was in the bathroom, carefully locking the door behind him. There was no point hanging around and being awkward — he could do that at home.
“I was also diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum this past year.”
“You must feel very strange and stressed, asking for help about this,” Castiel said, and then wished he hadn’t. Dean surprised him.
“WINCHESTER.”
“I’m not really, I’m just enough human soul floating on top of Castiel’s choppy grace to run this mouth, basically. I just wanted to tell you that whatever qualms you have about being affectionate with Castiel, please don’t have them on my account, or on Heaven’s account. I’m not speaking for Naomi.”
“So I guess a pity fuck is out of the question,” Dean said. His voice broke a little.
“Wife and daughter,” Dean said.
“Weeks, yeah, I know.”
“They didn’t sleep together,” Dean said. “They didn’t have that kind of friendship. A lot of people thought it was really weird. Anyway, my mom died about twenty years ago and Bobby went off the rails. He started getting into the occult and he kept trying — he kept trying to either bring Mary back or talk to her in Heaven, or wherever she was, and he kept trying to drag me and Sam into it.”
And now Dean was angry with him.
named this car.”
“Up to my ass in junk?”
“Wha-a—a—t?” Dean said, stretching the vowel out until it was ready to snap like a rubber band.
“Fuck! are we the new Roadhouse or what?” Dean grumbled. “And why the hell am I cooking?”
Dean shrugged. “You’ve had your grace all up in my everywhere. Am I supposed to worry about some spit? Or is there something else about angel sex I should be freaking about?”
“Free booze and everybody bringing us extra-sharp knives with wacky evil provenance? sounds like home!” Dean said. He was joking, and he wasn’t, like always. He’d argue it back and forth and about the time you thought you knew where he stood on anything, Castiel thought, he’d change the subject.
“It would also put all the hunters in the same place at the same time,” Castiel said. “SOP would be in tatters on the ground.”
“Well, it’s not like the requirement for those is going to go away anytime soon,” Dean said soothingly.
“Hunh. So that
“I thought being a top meant being the dominant personality,” Castiel said humbly. “It’s pretty obvious who the alpha male is.”
“Being unemployed is undesirable,” Castiel said firmly. “And you said you’d let me make the determination. Now I want to know.”
Dean shrugged again.
the hell was going on. “I don’t know how to answer that.”
Glenn was chasing him around the bed with his dick out. “I was almost finished.”
“So with Jimmy gone how’s the sexy feeling?”
“Wow,” Castiel said.
“Why the hell would he want to do that?” Dean said, genuinely surprised. “Why does he know or care about us? He got his, safe and sound!”
Dean fished Castiel’s contribution to his meal out of his bowl, setting it on a paper napkin without further comment, and the two of them commenced to eat.
Castiel went straight to him and sat down. “I know we didn’t part on the best of terms, but I wish you no ill will,” Castiel said.
of sexual desire, it’s like you and Enochian, you know what it’s good for, but you don’t necessarily know anything about it in practical terms.”
“Why don’t we just tell everyone we’re getting married?” Dean said, with glass-cut sarcasm. “Let’s leave the names as is, it’s easier for both of us if we’re real to each other, not standing in for who we knew first.”
too drunk for the job.
“It’s supposed to get easier, but I’m ….”
“Cas you can eat anything; okay, maybe not the emergency Nutella,” Dean said.
Dean thought about the kissing. He thought about what Castiel would say.
Castiel rested his hand lightly on Dean’s shoulder and looked right into his eyes. Dean was easier to look at than most people. He looked back with such interest.
“May I have seconds?” he asked, after Dean stopped laughing at him.
“My job here is
“Oh,” Dean said. “You could have said so. I’ve been offering rides and you’re saying, ‘no’, like I’m a creepy guy with a panel van.”
He fell into a new routine. Weekdays he worked to clear out Dean’s house. One or two nights on the weekend he’d go to Buddies or Sidekicks and try his luck at the bar, and he was handsome enough that he didn’t lack for partners. He quickly learned to ask if they liked kissing and preferred to take it slow, as that weeded out the ‘pump and grunt’ guys. Guys into kissing and taking it slow were often better conversationalists, too. It was hit or miss; some of his partners were more fun than a carnival ride and a couple of them were so focussed on getting their rocks off to the exclusion of everything else that he felt like he was just a convenient piece of meat.
“So they’ve been watching me jerk off for
“Was there a reason you never got a drivers’ license?” Dean asked after a while.
Cas, who was trying to sort out being flustered and annoyed and a little bit turned on by the conversation, reverted to type and told the truth. “I’m a virgin,” he said.
“Dean, car ownership and the ability to drive are not the be-all and end-all of masculine prowess. I didn’t have to drive because one of the family’s poorer relations drove us back and forth to work in a mini-bus. We were expected to work on the way to work and on the way back.”
“Oh.”
“What do you want me to do?” Castiel said helplessly.
Dean followed him, clearly intent on saying something.
“Bobby — you know Bobby was my stepdad after my dad — ”
In a serious, concerned voice, he said, “What, not coming on my face?”
The other man looked stricken.
“Your ability to deal with unpleasantness is unparalleled in human history,” Castiel said.
“You shook hands without actually telling me your name.” Dean said in his warm voice.
“What? They bugged your room?” Sam’s eyes were wide and his expression pissed.
“You make it sound like a science experiment,” Dean complained.
Dean seemed incapable of speech.
Dean felt like he was drowning in blue and then looked down at Castiel’s perfect mouth and started to imagine comparing another pink against that soft, soft mouth. Castiel muttered, before the gap between their mouths closed again, “I thought you’d enjoy more privacy.”
“What,” Castiel said.
“Yes,” Castiel said, nodding into Dean’s smirk. “The kind of style where grown men give their cars names.”
At least he didn’t have to work for another day. It was okay. It wasn’t anything serious. He looked it up on line; it was probably a fissure and if Glenn — that incompetent pig — had actually applied enough lube it wouldn’t have been an issue.
“Dean, has something changed between you and Castiel?”
There was a
Castiel frowned. “It is a science experiment. I don’t know if it will feel pleasant, I don’t know how to interpret it, is this pleasure, is this boredom, does the way the vessel reacts and the way I react, as Castiel, do they match? Am I imagining things? And all that’s before I start worrying what you’re feeling,” he concluded gloomily.
, and the illustrations were like an evil nightmare. He closed the book with a dusty thump. The rest of the items in the box, according to google, were run of the mill items used in divination, worship and ritual magic.
“Take a breath,” Dean advised.
“”Lo,” Dean said.
“No — I just envy you.”
Dean said, “Is there anything I can do?”
He lay down on the bed and held his arms up. Dean, with a soldier’s discipline, convinced his traitorous body that he needed to sleep, so he lay down next to him and, trembling a little, put his head on Castiel’s chest. He fell asleep with Castiel gently caressing his hair.
I hear you have a brother.”
“Nah, don’t bother. I’ll go get your bedding, now that you’ve cleared enough of my house out that I can get at the linen closet again.” He rose and returned with a duvet, a pillow and a sheet, and Castiel made himself a nest on the sofa.
“Bobby and Sam had a fight about the séance-y type stuff Bobby was doing, and I defended Bobby; I mean I figured it was harmless and Sam said it was pandering to our worst instincts and superstitious horseshit. He was sixteen and spitting fire, man, unbelievable.
I could have given you a ride
There were still boxes upstairs, but that was because Dean had made the decision that nothing was going to go back downstairs once it was brought up; it was simply too hard on the knees.
“You have no basis for liking me,” Castiel said. His eyebrows indicated mild disbelief.
“May I come look at the job?”
Castiel sat up. “Really?”
“Heaven was watching, and I got to see. And by Heaven I mean Naomi. She’s got a thing for the new Castiel. She always hated the old one, a little bit, because he was so good at defying her but — he always found a way to help; made her look bad. I don’t like her but I sure respect her.”
They looked at each other. Dean looked tired, and sad, and guilty… why would he look guilty?
“You’re hired,” Dean said, and the subject was dropped, and Dean wasn’t mad at him anymore, apparently, and then he was insisting that they watch a movie, and then tried to figure out what Castiel wanted to watch, since he had six hundred of the most popular movies of all time on a big and (‘shush!!’) illegal media server his friend Charlie had set up for him.
“What,” Castiel said, openly mocking, “You think you’d give up hunting to be a father? You’d find a surrogate.”
Dean sat up, almost panicking, and then remembered that Sam had had months to get used to Winchester+Angel rev 2.0, and that everybody knew that Castiel was asexual. A cuddler and sometimes as affectionate as a kitten but not really a sexual creature.
“Castiel, what’s goin’ on?”
At Dean’s expression, he said, “What if I shake hands too hard or too soft. What if the other person feels strange or I feel strange to them. What if I’m too quick or too slow to put my hand up. What if I forget my name.”
“Are you dragging on me for calling you boring the other day?”
“Well, now,” Castiel said. “That’s very flattering. I find you very attractive too, but I’d rather take my chances with someone who doesn’t hate himself for having sex with me.”
Castiel looked puzzled.
Resentfully, he thought that Dean would at least have used enough lube. Probably.
“Ha-ha!” It was a very childish laugh, and Dean was almost laughing too hard for intelligibility. “He caught you jerking off while thinking about me,” Dean crowed, relieved as hell the conversation wasn’t going the other way.
“Okay,” Castiel heard himself say.
“The condominium is ‘under renovation’. I’ll move to a different one when Gabe lets me know I need to change where I am. It’s not like I own anything. I’m on the other end of the spectrum to you.” He waved vaguely.
The first thing the police would figure out is that they had Dr. Barnes in common. Really, he was being a dolt.
“Social anxiety?” Dean said in a kindly way.
“So you’re voting that I punch you instead of kissing you?” Dean complained.
Dean looked stricken. The dark haired man said, in a calm and compelling voice, “I’m so sorry, Dr. Barnes.”
“You’re a grown man who cares about his mental health. Sounds likeable. You’re polite and well-spoken.”
Dean’s eyes narrowed. “I bet, but why lose any time keeping watch on Claire by watching us instead? I don’t imagine Heaven just put in a magic window in his room, ‘hey, go spy on those guys’.”
Castiel blinked. He probably should have read the texts.
“Huh! Jack’s all the nephilim I’ll ever need, and since I don’t have ovaries I wasn’t actually worried at all,” Dean said.
The first sets of boxes he opened were from stepfather Bobby’s estate. They were mostly books, boxes and boxes of hardcover thrillers and paperback westerns, and four hundred VHS movies with faded, curling cardboard sleeves. That all seemed very ordinary. He checked on-line to see if any of the books or VHS tapes which were in good shape were collectors’ items, and they were not. Then he opened a box that appeared to be full of satanic ritual items and Castiel, being alone, and having had his ears stuffed with every kind of wacky anti-idolatry nonsense his parents’ pastor could emit like a volcano of bilious piety every Sunday for two decades, was actively frightened by them and closed the box to bolt upstairs and fetch himself some equanimity along with his coffee.
