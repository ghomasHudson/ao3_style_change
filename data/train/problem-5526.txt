Frowning at his Daddy, Sam started to rip at the cardboard, he wanted to show Dean his new track now.
Next thing he knew he felt a sharp stab in his butt cheek. Opening his eyes fully, Dean let out a screeching howl.
What did he mean two more? One was enough. Pushing himself away from Daddy, Dean turned to look behind him. Standing with a syringe in her hand, Dr Bailey pricked him in his butt again.
Dean didn’t bother responding. He knew he couldn’t do anything to stop them, in the time he had on his own he just thought of his Daddy, trying to remember every detail of his face, his beautiful blue eyes, his loving smile, in a small hope he could remember him somehow.
“Shhh little angel, shh, it’s okay,” Michael whispered patting Dean’s clean diaper. Watching his brother, Castiel weakly smiled at hearing Michael use the old nickname he used for him with Dean.
Looking at both the men with puppy eyes, Sam shook his head before leaning into Michael’ side.
Seeing Lilith nodded her head, both the brothers walked away.
“Because when they look at you they’ll see my gorgeous baby boy, that’s why. And you’ll be with your Daddy, who will always keep you safe,” Castiel smiled. Holding Dean’s face in his hands he kisses his little boy’s forehead.
Hearing his Daddy Sam frowned when he saw the hurt look on the man’s face. “No Daddy,” he said pouting up at him. Why would Daddy ask him that? Sure, he had been embarrassed about Daddy talking about his diaper, but he was okay with that. Dean didn’t seem bothered so he knew it was fine.
“Best Daddy.”
Letting out a light sigh, Gabriel turned his attention back to his screen. “Right, Dean Winchester. Let’s get you officially adopted by that sappy little brother of mine,” Gabriel got to work filling in all the forms and information, he had done some research online to see if he could find anything about Dean, turned out there wasn’t much to find. He had found the boy’s birth certificate and the last school Dean was registered at on the government database, but other than that there was nada about the boy. Bring up Dean’s school records he found Dean had a hard time fitting in at school. Had left school at sixteen without graduating, after that Dean disappeared for a while till he got into trouble with the police a few times for robbery and breaking and entering.
Waking into the living room, Castiel found Michael staring at the wall in a weird looking trance.
“Winchester, Dean,” Gabriel watched eagerly as the man typed on his computer
“Do you not want to check what I've picked?” Gabriel held out his arms showing the clothes.
Castiel’s eyes widened. Did Dean just call him Daddy? That’s what it sounded like. Tears fell as he kissed his baby’s forehead.  “I love you baby, you make me so happy.”  Taking his boy’s hand he kissed each finger. “My beautiful baby.”
“Dean, baby look at me,” Dean shook his head. His mind was being so cruel, he thought he could hear Uncle Gabriel.
Following his boy’s hand Gabriel spotted what Sam was looking at. “That is Rosie, she’s Dean’s bee from his Daddy,” he explained as he picked Sam up into his arms. Walking over to the crib he picked the bee up and handed it to his boy.
Reluctantly, Castiel passed Dean over. Having Dean out of his arms he felt like grabbing him back, but he knew he’d have his boy back soon. Watching Gabriel walk down the hall, Castiel stood looking at the closed door for a while.
“Sammy, can you look at me please?” Waiting, he soon saw two big bright eyes looking up at him, “Baby, what your old Dad told you was wrong. Boys can like pink, pink is not just a girls colour, just like blue isn’t a boys colour. I know you like it, don’t you?” Seeing Sam nod shyly Gabriel decided to continue. “Well, then if you like this I will get it for you. I never want you to feel like you can’t have something just because others are to pig headed to let you. If you like something then nothing and no one can stop you from liking it, do you understand Baby?”
Hanging up the phone, Castiel rubbed his hand across his chin, he couldn’t believe it. Gabriel had adopted a Little, and not just any Little, Dean’s brother. Out of everything that had happened he didn’t see that coming. The poor boy was left all alone just like Dean had been. He knew Dean had a little brother, he just assumed he was with John Winchester, but it turned out that poor excuse of a father had abandoned all his children, the selfish asshole.
Hearing Dean let out a light snore Castiel came out of his thoughts. Smiling down at his boy, he carefully got up from his chair.
“Here baby, eat up,” Castiel held up a spoon-full to Dean. Dean turned his head away before it got to close. “Come on Dean, don’t you want to try it?”
“Michael, are you okay?”
Looking at the screen on the wall Dean looked up in amazement at a cartoon lion cub playing with another animal he didn’t know.
“Uncle Cas…” Hearing a small voice behind him, Castiel turned around to see Charlie walking up to him with her arms out for a hug.
He knew the reputation he had. People saw him as cold, distant and well, a bit of a Scrooge, but he didn’t really care. If people didn’t like him he wasn’t going and cry over it.
Laying his head onto Castiel shoulder, Dean hummed happily. He didn’t say anything, he felt like he didn’t need to, he knew Daddy knows how he felt.
Rubbing his hands over his face, Gabriel let out a small groan. “Okay baby, I can’t promise anything but! I will call Cas and see what he thinks.”
“Can we go to the toy store now?”
“Let’s get you changed and then you can help me with a surprise for you and Daddy.”
Seeing a pair of big green eyes look straight at him, Castiel let out a heartbreaking whimper.
Hearing a sigh, Gabriel listened nervously.
“I know. I heard it all,” Hannah said, sounding very unimpressed as she walked down the stairs. “Charlie could hear it to. She’s worried about her uncles, Gabriel. I don’t want my little girl upset.”
“I think so too. Could you get me his bottle? It’s in the warmer.”
Sitting in silence, Castiel cuddled his baby happily. His boy held on to his shirt tightly with his small hand. He could have stayed there holding his baby forever but he soon heard a knock on the door, taking him out of his trance. Standing up he walked to the stroller to lower his tired looking Dean into his chair. Hearing Dean groan he smiled. His boy didn’t want to stop their cuddle either.
“Let’s get you clean Deany.” Squeezing some shampoo into his hand Castiel got to work, rubbing it into Dean’s soft hair. Dean couldn’t say he didn’t enjoy his Daddy scrubbing at his head, it felt blissful having Castiel’s long, gentle fingers rubbing at his scalp.
Soon as Dean was cradled in his Daddy’s arms he sucked down the warm creamy milk. While Castiel held the bottle for him, Dean fiddled with his Daddy’s fingers as he watched his show. Even though he wasn’t being held by Daddy like he wanted to be, holding his hand in his was comfort enough; as long as he held onto his Daddy he was happy.
“Yes Gabriel?” Castiel said, in a way that he knew his name was a question.
“Hello, Dr Bailey. Yes, I just recently became Dean’s caregiver and I just want to make sure he’s all okay. Isn’t that right baby?” Castiel looked down at his hiding boy.
Gabriel couldn’t stop himself from laughing at Castiel’s bitch face. The poor man was clearly in the dog house.
Sitting in his carseat in the back of his new Daddy’s car, he watched the world go by, excited as they headed to Dean’s house.
“Daddy?”
“Home...” Sam grinned, he had a home and a Daddy. He was finally getting out of here and he was going to see his big brother again after such a long time. This was defiantly the best day of his life.
Closing his eyes, trying to stop them falling, Dean soon felt a warm hand stroking his belly. Opening his eyes he saw his Daddy standing over him. He blinked a few time to make sure he wasn’t imagining what he saw. “..Dad..ie..” he choked out, lifting his hands up.
“Uncle Cas!” Before she could get close to him and Dean, Hannah grabbed the girl under her arms lifting her up in the air.
“Are you excited Sammy?”
“Da..Da..” Dean said, frowning towards her. He didn’t care who she was, he just wanted Daddy.
With a bit of luck he found that Dean had written his name on his torn run down rain coat.
“What are you doing baby?” Castiel asked, only to be answered with a hum. Not sure of what Dean was trying to do he leaned forward so he was face to face with his determined little man.
Dean listen to his Daddy. Daddy wasn’t being mean, he couldn’t believe how he acted towards him.  Thinking about it, he had been really silly. Seeing Daddy smiling at him Dean snuggled into him. “Sorry.”
“..I...orry...ow..” Dean cried making his voice hitch. He wanted to say sorry, he really did feel bad, he just hoped Daddy didn’t hate him now.
“Hey sleepy head, did you have a good nap?” Castiel said, smiling when he sees his green eyed boy looking up at him.
“You’re right,” Michael said, letting go of Lilith’s chair. “I want you gone by the time I come back,”
Suddenly he felt strong arms lift him up.
“Here you go.” Coming out of his thoughts, Michael looked up at his brother, holding out a pair of jeans and t-shirt, Michael turned his nose up.
Dean’s eyes looked red with tears. what could have upset his boy so much? “Deany, baby, what’s wrong tell Daddy?”
Sam nodded, looking at the man nervously. He remembered him from last night, he was Gabriel’s brother Michael.
Dean whined. He didn’t want to go back out there! He was happy being held by his Daddy.
“Okay, we’ll head home then. Call me if you need anything, you hear me?” Hannah said, giving Castiel a stern look.
“That was a mean joke Gabriel, why would you do that?”
“What’s the matter?” he asked, nodding towards Sam.
Gabriel knew if Dean liked any of the cars he would have got it for him, even if his little brother was against the idea he would have done it anyway.
“He is cute,” Gabriel said once Dean was fully asleep.
“Pinks for girls,” Sam said looking down at his feet, he could feel his checks warm.
“Don’t encourage him Ca...Cas” Feeling both his brothers tackle into him, Michael let out a small yelp as they fall to the ground. Looking down seeing gold and blue eyes shining up at him, Michael couldn’t stop himself from laughing as he wrapped his arms around his little brothers. Remembering when they were little boys doing the same thing, they use to always cuddle him like this when they were younger.
“You two have been busy, but I had hoped to take my little man out to the mall and get some things,” Gabriel said. He didn’t want to just buy everything online like most people did, he wanted to take Sam out to pick his toys and clothes, like he did with Castiel and Dean.
“You ready to go Casey?” Gabriel said, coming from the hallway.
“Really Gabriel, should we not get clothes first?” Michael asked, shaking his head.
“Are you sure it’s wise for me to come along Gabriel?”
The last time he saw Sam he was ten years old. He went by the house to check on his little brother, but it didn’t end well because John spotted him and kick the shit out of him for trying to see Sam. When he tried again a year later he found that they had moved away.
Groaning as slowly awakened, Dean felt stinging in his eyes as they adjusted to the brightness of the lights above his head. Lifting his head, he tried to sit up, only to find that he couldn’t move his body. Moving his hands slightly he could feel something soft rub against his fingers and when he turned his head to the side Dean felt the same softness against his check.
“How was work?” Castiel asked, not taking his eyes off of his baby.
“He’s mad because he had to have his shots at the doctors, so his bum is a bit sore.”
Castiel looked at him confused. “I thought you cleaned him yesterday?”
“Hey….Hey baby,” Castiel smiled, feeling his throat tighten. Looking into Dean’s beautiful green eyes he could see his Dean was back. “I missed you my Bumblebee, you made Daddy worry so, so much.”
Nodding, Sam turned his arms to Michael, who quickly picked him up into his arms.
Gabriel looked at his boy then to Michael, he knew Sam was asking to see Dean today but he knew they couldn’t just yet. He hadn’t even spoken to Castiel since bring Dean home.
Walking closer, he could see that Michael was a little frustrated.
Nodding, Dean rested his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
“Wow Deany, look at your room. It’s wonderful! Look at the ceiling,” Castiel said, tilting his head up. Dean copied his Daddy, looking up he see stars covering every part of the ceiling. “I think they might glow when you go to bed. We’ll have to see later, won’t we?” Castiel grinned at his boy. His brother had chosen well the room was perfect for his baby.
Gabriel burst out laughing, making Dean and Castiel jump, “You’ve been a Daddy what, five minutes? And you’re already wrapped round his finger. The little bugger bit me when I tried changing his diaper.”
Lifting his head up to look over Gabriel’s shoulder, Dean thought he had seen his Daddy, only to realise it wasn’t him. The man standing his distance looked just like Castiel, but he was a lot taller and more smartly dressed in a suit and tie.
“Do you need to be changed?”
“I’m just going to get changed baby, you stay there.” Leaning over, Castiel places a kiss on Dean’s forehead before moving to his wardrobe.
“Gabe?” he asked.
Looking up from his baby, Castiel meet Gabriel’s grey eyes with his own. “Thank you,” He whispered, as his tears ran down his face.
Sam could not believe what was happening to him. Not only was he out of what he considered hell, but he had been adopted and he was going to see Dean again after such a long time. He was super excited to see his big brother, but a small part of him was questioning and making him worry. What if Dean didn’t want to see him and hated him? Dean would probably be mad at him for not stopping their Dad from beating and kicking Dean out of their home. At the time Sam was still a kid and his Dad scared him badly. He just hoped Dean wouldn’t blame him for everything.
“Let me just bring up your files. I think we’ll start with Dean first,” Dr Bailey said, bring up the files on her computer. “Dean Winchester Novak, it looks like he hasn’t had any appointments since he was four years old. I think we better update his file. Can you remove the baby’s clothes leaving just his diaper?”
“Do as you’re told Castiel, I’ll be in in a minute,” Gabriel walked passed him towards Dean’s room.
After rinsing out Dean’s hair Castiel moved to clean his body with a soft wash cloth. Dean looked up to his Daddy with half closed eyes. Seeing Dean close to sleep Castiel moved a bit faster to get him clean. Pulling the plug Castiel grabbed a large fluffy towel from the towel rack. Wrapping his boy up he walked into Dean’s room. He laid him down on the changing table, Castiel patted Dean’s skin dry. The towel was dropped to the floor as he grabbed a thick diaper, baby cream, and powder from under the table. Placing the diaper under his baby he placed some cream on the ends of his fingers and lifting Dean’s legs up to his chest Castiel rubbed the thick white cream around his baby’s hole and between his legs. Dean groaned at the feeling of his Daddy’s soft touch, Castiel was even more gentle than Gabriel’s first time putting cream on his bum. Feeling himself go a little stiff Dean tried to take his mind off of what was happening, hoping Castiel hadn’t noticed.
Sam pecked from his hiding stop, seeing the anger look on Meg’s face, he thought she was going to snatch him out of his new Daddy’s arm, but looking up at the said man and his Uncle they had scarier faces then she did.
Nodding his head, Sam hugged Michael around his neck. Startled at being hugged, Michael smiled, giving the boy light squeeze.
“..No..No.” Dean screamed in the man’s face looking angry. Castiel looked at his boy in shock. He hadn’t see his boy look so angry before, not even after waking up from being kidnapped.
“Cassie, is it okay if I use the changing table?”
“Cassy, I need you to listen and now. Michael had nothing to do with this, he helped me get Dean back.”
“Mike, I know right know you’re probably are not up for it, but I need your help.”
“Do I?” Castiel asked, looking confused. What was his brother up to.
Heading towards the kitchen, Sam startled when he found a man sitting at the table.
“Dean that’s enough, stop it. Daddy doesn’t want to drop you.”
“He’s been taken for treatment,”
Hearing Gabriel’s voice, Michael smiled when he saw his brother walk back in with Sam dressed in only his diaper.
Holding on to his Daddy, Sam looked on nervously. Why were they going into the kitchen? When they entered Sam’s eyes widened at what he saw. Swaying around the kitchen with big grins on their faces, Castiel was dancing with Dean on his hip making him giggle by blowing raspberries into his neck.
Dean looked at his little brother, seeing his face looking very pink he could tell Sam was feeling embarrassed at Gabriel making it obvious that Sam had used his diaper. Scoffing in his head at how silly the “adults” were, Dean just gave Sam a reassuring smile to show him it didn’t bother him.
Holding on to Castiel’s shirt Dean let out a loud cry, he didn’t want Daddy to leave him alone.
“Okay..Okay I’m coming,” Michael smiled letting the boy pull him along.
Dean jerked when he saw Gabriel come into view above the other man’s head.
Hearing Dean let out a groan from his knee, Michael carefully lifted him up to lay across his lap facing him. “Aww little angel, have you run out of tears hmm.”
“Ahh yes, he had a cheap looking gold 1970’s Lincoln Continental.” Hearing a giggle, both men saw Dean snickering behind his pacifier. “...Anyway, what I was getting at is, would you help Daddy find a car, bud? Maybe in a few days me and you can drag your Daddy car shopping, make him realise he has to drive his boy around in style not make you walk everywhere.”
Dean silently took in what his Daddy said. What did he mean Sam was there? He couldn’t have been there. Sam wasn’t a little, Sam was with John wasn’t he? That’s where he was meant to be. Sam was only fifteen, John was meant to be looking after him.
Looking down Castiel smiles seeing Dean playing with his hand. He was happy his boy wasn’t paying attention to the grown up talk. He didn’t want his baby have to worry about these things, he just wants Dean to be his happy little boy. Placing a kiss on the boy’s forehead, he soon saw those beautiful green eyes that he loved looking up at him. “Hey baby, you okay?”
Michael was loving watching his family. He was secretly looking forward to this shopping trip, it was nice to be away from the office, but he was mostly enjoying being able to spend time with his brother and new nephew.
Smiling, Sam snuggled into Michael. He hoped his Daddy was right, he couldn’t wait to show Dean the toy he got him, he hoped it helped to make Dean like him again.
Suddenly all of last night came back to him. He had adopted Sam, Dean’s little brother.
As they walked to the door Dean whimpered, pointing to his crib. “..Ros.ie..”
Squealing happily, Sam pulled on his Daddy’s hand making the man peek from behind his fingers.
Dean wasn’t sure where he was. He had been crying so hard, he didn’t really see anything till he was dumped in a dark room. Looking round with tears fallen from his eyes he noticed he had been put into a metal crib. The mattress was hard and plastic. It wasn’t nice like his crib in his nursery.
“..an..gry...”
“I think Dean is too tried to play today, baby girl. It’s nearly Dean’s bedtime and we need to get you home for your bedtime too.” Hannah said, picking Charlie up again.
“It’s okay Honey, Daddy will make it all better,” Castiel tried to hold in his anger. Whoever had hurt his baby would pay for this. Taking out some wipes he slowly cleaned Dean’s skin.
“Hey Cassie, how are you?”
“Yea we’re fine. Just needed to reassure my baby. He thought he couldn’t have anything pink coz John told him it was for girls.”
Going down the aisles Gabriel let Sam pick most of the clothes he liked. So far he had picked three body suits, two t-shirts and a pair of blue overalls, all with puppy designs over them. Seeing a pattern in what Sam was choosing he figured his baby must really like dogs. Letting Sam pick another t-shirt with a puppy on it, Gabriel started to grab though non-puppy clothes that he thought would be good.
hi, sorry for the wait ive been so busy, ive had no free time to write, finally got a chapter finished I hope you like it xxxx
“That’s good, it’s what I get for being clumsy,” Castiel shrugged, tightening his hold around Dean.
Nice try lady, he thought,  “..Da..Da..” he whimpered, holding out his free hand.
“You’re not buying two cars Casey, you’re buying the Q3,” Gabriel laughed, “No, I am buying the Impala.”
“Samuel, is everything alright?” Michael asked, lowering himself to Sam’s level.
Walking back into the store they found Gabriel standing by the door with the stroller.
“Okay, let’s go. Me and you have to stop Uncle Gabe from buying every flavour in the store,”
“Yea, Uncle Gabe found you didn’t he? He bought you back to me, just like he said he would.”
As they held their boys as they cuddled, Castiel glanced at the doorway to see Michael standing there looking sheepish. Seeing his oldest brother dressed in jeans and t-shirt Castiel smirked at how normal he looked apart from the sad pouting face. He really did look like a kicked puppy.
“He’s fine, he’s so lovely Cas. You’re going to love him, he’s really looking forward to seeing Dean,” Gabriel said, sounding hopeful.
Castiel made quick work of cleaning up Dean’s wet diaper. He just wanted to have his baby back in his arms. Picking Dean up, he was shocked when Dean tried to push him away. He went to sit on the bench in the corner. Cradling his boy Castiel watched his baby. He look so sad and tired. He thought Dean had started to warm to him, maybe he was just imaging it. He started to think maybe he should really explain to Dean why he had taken him. Taking a deep breath, Castiel nodded his head to himself.
“I’ll come and help you Gabriel. Castiel, everything you need for Dean is set up ready for you. I hope you like it. By the looks of things Gabriel went all out,” Hannah smiled before passing him.
“I know baby. I’ll be as quick as I can,” Castiel said, as he worked at getting his boy clean.
“Michael, we don’t hate you, we could never hate you. We don’t like some of the things you have done, things like the mind wiper. To me and Cas that is going to far, but we feel like we can’t voice our opinions because you don’t listen. But right now our little brother needs us. We need to get Dean back. If you saw Cas when they took him he broke down in my arms and Dean, Dean needs his Daddy. The poor boy is going to be so scared.”
Nodding, Michael watched as his little brother walked into the bathroom. Dumping his towel into a basket he picked up the bags. He pulled out trainers and socks, a navy onesie and cream overalls with a cartoon dog stitched on the pocket and he lay them neatly on the bed. Smiling to himself, Michael was rather proud of the clothes he had picked for his nephew. Though he had very little experience with children or Littles, he thought he had good taste in clothes for them.
Gabriel let of a sigh “It didn’t. Most all chose prison, so the head of the A.B office asked our company to come up with a better idea,” Gabriel stopped to pass Castiel the file. “And our beloved big brother Michael had decided to take the homeless.”
“Dean, listen to me.” Cupping Dean’s face in his hands, he waited to see Dean’s green eyes looking at him. “Baby, Sam is safe. Gabriel went back with Michael late night and he took Sam home with him.”
“Alright..alright silly boy we can get closer, but we can’t touch these cars okay?” Gabriel said moving up to the side of the car. “I don’t think Crowley would be best pleased if we touch his babies,” he added.
Both Castiel and Dean turned to see Gabriel still sitting where he was.
“Let’s get Deano comfy in his stroller and head in Cas. Just got a text from Hannah, the workers have started doing Dean’s room. They should be done after about lunch time,” Gabriel said as his put his phone in his pocket.
“You can trust me Casey. I didn’t think when those women came up to us. I got distracted…. and I am sorry. I would never do anything to put Dean in danger, you know that. Please, I am sorry.” Gabriel looked like he might have started to cry, but Castiel knew his brother wasn’t about to. But he did look sorry.
Dean gasped when Daddy opened the door. The room was amazing. The walls were painted a light, pale blue with a white wood panel border. In the corner close to the large bay window was a beautiful dark grey crib with blue and white stars covering the bedding. Above the crib hung a mobile with shiny three dimensional stars and moons.
“Sammy, this is your Uncle Cassie. Can you say hi Baba?”
“Baby, it’s okay, you did so well. You’re such a good boy, Daddy’s going to get you all cleaned up.”
“No I Don’t” Michael got up quickly holding his arms up.
Hearing Dean let out a whimpering sound Gabriel felt a knot in his stomach. He just wished he could take back everything he said and done.
Dean hiccupped as he listened Castiel sing to him. The man’s voice was gruff but soft at the same time, he actually found it soothing. Looking up, Dean leaned into the man’s hand as he thumbed his brow. He knew he shouldn’t give in but he was so tried he just wanted to sleep. And though he would never admit it, this was the most comfortable he had been in a good while. Closing his eyes, Dean drifted into sleep listening to Castiel sing.
Tightening his hold around the boy’s back Castiel tried to walk into the kitchen while Dean screamed and wiggled frantically.
“You go to sleep now Dean. I’m very upset you made Daddy hurt himself, that was very bad. Hopefully when you wake up you’ll be ready to say sorry to Daddy.”
“Its for you De!” Sam yelled, pulling the box from Michael’s hand Sam stumbled dropping the box at his Daddy’s feet.
“That’s not your job to decide. Your job is to answer phone and get me coffee that’s all you’re really good for,” Gabriel watched on as Michael leaned over the blond women, his face was pure anger. He’s never seen Michael so angry before. It was kind of scary, but he wasn’t going to stop him. “And now because of your stupidity my little brother is distraught from having his baby taken. I might be, as you all say, a cold hearted asshole, but no one messes with my family. Do you understand? No One!” he yelled, making Lilith jump in her skin.
Finally being able to see his body, Dean noticed he was naked apart from something white below his belly. Moving his leg against it Dean heard it crinkle lightly. It didn’t feel uncomfortable, if anything it felt soft and slightly warm. Coming out of his thoughts Dean watched Gabriel move down to his lower half.
“Da….John” Sam mumbled, “Boys don’t wear pink.”
Dean smiled up at his Daddy. He like that tattoo even more now he knew what it meant. Holding his arms up, Dean waited for Daddy to pick him up. he just wanted to cuddle the man forever, for being so lovely.
Walking in they were stopped by an old man sitting behind a desk. “Can I help you gentlemen?” he asked.
“Anyway, while I was talking to Gabriel he said that Sam really wants to see you, would you like that?”
“This John Winchester sounds like a prat,” Michael stated putting the boxes down with the clothes.
Humming, Dean held out his hand towards Michael. Seeing the man properly, it still made him slightly uncomfortable at how much Michael looked like his Daddy. Apart from the eyes, frown and longer legs he would have thought he was Daddy’s twin. But thankfully to Dean, Michael’s face wasn’t as soft and loving as Castiel’s. Lest that was something that was just all his Daddy’s.
Nodding his head again still with his attention on the bear.
Dean was in hysterics watching his Daddy. The look on his face when he ran to the sink was the funniest thing Dean had ever seen. Feeling his sides starting to hurt Dean leaned back in his high-chair, giggling as he started to calm down.
Heading home Dean kept trying to look out the window to see if he could see Daddy. They had decided to leave Dean’s car-seat in Gabriel’s car till they got home to save time on fiddling with it to get it in Castiel’s car. Dean wasn’t too happy not being with his Daddy, but he didn’t say anything encase he upset them and they took his new car away.
Castiel tightened his hold on his boy when he felt Dean wriggling. Shushing him quietly, he gently bounced his baby while turning his attention to the women.  “Hello Hannah, how are you?”
“Right. First off Mr Novak, you are the spit of health. I checked your arm and the cuts seem to be healing nicely,” Dean winced at hearing about Daddy’s arm. He was surprised Daddy hadn’t mentioned it before.
“Sorry Daddy.” Sam said, wiggling out of Gabriel’s hold. Picking the box up again he drag it closer to Castiel so Dean could see, “Look De, it a race track.”
“No...Da..diee..no!” Castiel sighed at hearing Dean call him Daddy, his little boy had called him Dada and he loved it, but Dean had only called him Daddy one. Hearing it again made him want to do cartwheels. He just hoped Dean wouldn’t figure out that calling him Daddy was Castiel’s now greatest weakness.
“Really?” Castiel raised an eyebrow in disbelief.
Moving closer Castiel and Gabriel smiled as Dean wrapped his arms around Sam neck.
Looking up confused, Dean snuggled into his Daddy’s chest. He didn’t realise he had fallen asleep.
Dean looked over at Michael pouting, he looked just like his Daddy which didn’t help with the fact that he wasn’t him. He need his Daddy, he missed his Daddy.
At hearing Castiel’s question Dean felt his stomach rumble. Castiel must have heard it too when Dean hears him laugh. Without even thinking, Dean nodded his head. He couldn’t remember the last time he ate.
“No, by the looks of it you’ve done good and besides, I have no fashion sense remember?”
“I’m going to take Dean to change him.” Without hearing his brother out, Castiel grabbed the stroller with one hand and headed to the nearest changing room.
“Please Castiel, I can explain..” Michael said, walking in closer to his family, but Castiel backed from him holding Dean tighter.
-----------------------------------
Walking down the hall to the kitchen, Gabriel stopped in the doorway in shock at what he saw.
Scrunching his brows, Sam frowned. Why was Dean saying sorry? Dean was right, he was being mean towards his Daddy. “No De..De right I sorry.”
“Well Cas is more mature than you clearly.”
“Well, Sam...What happened?” Gabriel asked again.
Groaning, Dean wiggled under Castiel's hand. He really did need to pee, but he was using all his willpower to hold it in. Sucking on the pacifier, Dean tried not to think about it. He didn’t care what Gabriel said about having no control, there was no way he was pissing himself in public.
Once Dean was dressed again, he had stopped crying to the point that he was only whimpering into his Daddy’s shirt. Castiel gave him his pacifier, hoping it would help his boy.
“You’ll be fine. If you want we’ll go sit in the living room, it’ll be more comfortable.”
“Yes, you do” Gabriel said grinned before turning to Crowley, “Crowley we will take the Q3 and the Impala.”
Sighing, Michael took the clothes and headed to the bathroom. Just as he was about to close the door he heard the doorbell. “That’ll be Sam’s clothes.”
Breathing in Dean opened his eyes when he took in a bad smell. Moving his legs again he soon realised that he had a messy diaper.
Feeling Daddy smother his face in kisses Dean cried loudly. He was going to get lots and lots of ice cream after Daddy made him go through this.
Turning back to the house he ran in only to find Castiel laying on the floor where one of the bouncers had left him.
Once Gabriel had got all he needed for the company’s storage rooms, both he and Castiel drove down to the church in Gabriel’s landrover.
Walking in, Castiel locked the door to the private toilet with a changing table. Placing Dean down he grabbed the diaper bag he started to unsnap Deans overalls.
“Oh. I got Dean something from the toy store,” Gabriel said, looking over his shoulder. “I got him a toy car. I was going to give it to him and ask if he wanted to go out and look for a car for you after lunch. I forgot all about it when I came in.”
Hearing Dean mumble, both Castiel and Michael looked at each other as the baby held their hands.
“Dean’s brother?”
“I’m sorry Gabe, just hearing you in Daddy mode is funny, I just never thought I would see the day.”
Humming again, Dean pulled Michael’s hand closer to where Castiel’s hand was resting on Dean’s belly. Placing the men’s hands together Dean put his on top so they stayed in place.
Looking up he could see his boy trying to break out of the bigger man’s hold with Gabriel right behind him screaming for the man to let him go. He didn’t know what happened but after seeing Dean’s scared little face, but he suddenly couldn’t hear anything. It was like someone had pushed the mute button in his mind, his baby’s face at that moment will forever be engraved into his heart. And the only thing he could think was that its was all his fault. “..D..Dean..”
Hey All, I'm still here, I lost this chapter to technical problems and two-year writer's block, so that sucked, I've actually able to get something out and I've finally got some ideas  I'm just sorry it's not as long as I would have liked. let me know what you think. Thank you for all the kudos still even after so long xxxxxxxxx
“Hello Crowley,” Castiel said, holding out his hand.
“It’ll soon be just us baby, and we’ll go cuddle like I promised, but first let’s change that diaper and get you dressed for bed,” Castiel said, patting Dean’s diaper.
“He does, but he needs time Michael,” Seeing his big brother nod, Gabriel smiled with a sigh when he sees Michael smile to himself. He knew his family was hurting, but they’ll be back to normal soon, maybe even better than before.
Castiel grinned, leaning down closer to his boy, “I am so hungry Deany, I could eat a scabby horse,” Dean giggled his Daddy. “Are you laughing at your Daddy again?”
“..No..Dada..” Dean shook his head, Daddy can’t expect him to do it here.
----------------------------------------------------------------
“Yes...Yes please” Sam cried into Gabriel’s shirt, “Please…”
“I’m going to change him, I’ll be right back.”
“You changed his diaper?” Gabriel asked in disbelief.
Opening his eyes, Castiel stretched out, feeling parts of body pop. Looking round he saw light coming through the window. He was in Gabriel’s living room. Taking a moment, he started to remember the night before. Castiel sat up quickly in a panic. “Dean?”
“Shall we bring her down for Dean, I know he’ll be happy to have her.”
“Stop moaning you baby, I’m nearly done,” Gabriel said, pulling out the last bit of glass. “Can’t believe this happened, that boy need a serious spanking.”
“Okay baby, let’s get you a bottle for now,” Castiel said as he stood up. “Gabe would you like one for Sammy?”
Letting Meg change his wet diaper, Dean drops into his head trying to ignore the horrible feeling of a stranger touching him. He tried thinking of his Daddy and Uncle Gabe. He just wished he could see them, even if it was just for a moment, he really missed them.
“Shh…it’s okay baby. These are just to stop the diaper leaking.” Not bothering with a sleeper, Castiel picked his baby up and placed him on his hip.
Moving quick to get out of his clothes, Castiel slipped into a pair of sweat pants. Not bothering with a shirt he climbed into his side of the bed. Moving Dean on top of him with his baby’s back on his chest, he picked up the bottle and held it to Dean’s lips.
Getting up from his chair he grabbed his jacket before picking up the files, including Dean’s, on his desk. Heading to his door Michael followed behind. “I’ll see you later Mickey.”
“..Come...please.” Hearing Sam, Michael and Gabriel looked at the boy.
Waiting for the others to leave, Gabriel moved to sit in front of Sam. Picking up a doll he pretended to make it walk around. “Sammy, do you remember anything form before coming here?”
Castiel let out a heart-breaking sigh when he looked up at the screen. “See Uncle Cassy, I said it would be okay,” Charlie grinned tapping her small fingers on Castiel’s stubbly cheek.
Sensing a change Gabriel started to walk over to where the pink body suit was. Seeing it, he picked out one he knew would fit Sam, “Would you like this sweetpea?”
Once Gabriel was ready, they headed out leaving the decorators to finish Sam’s nursery in peace.
Hearing a crash behind them, Castiel turned to see Gabriel dumping their shopping bags on the floor. “Gabriel is here, thanks for asking. Oh, thanks for the help with the bags baby bro,” Gabriel said, making it sound like he was out of breath.
“I’m so, so sad. What can I do to make my baby forgive me?” Turning to look back at Castiel, Dean sees him peek one eye up at him before hiding again, pretending to cry.
“No,” Castiel sighed, turning away from the window. “I’m not mad with you Gabe, I just panicked when I saw my baby so upset….it’s just...Christ Gabriel, Dean hasn’t been a baby a whole day yet and you used him to flirt with women…. I trusted you with him..if I can’t trust you who can I trust?”
“Right this minute I’m going to forget you said that, but if I find out that you’ve hurt my nephew more then you say, we’re,” he stopped glaring at her, pointing between himself and Meg, “We’re going to have problems. Do you understand?”
“Who’s Rosie?” Gabe looked at him, confused.
“It will be okay Uncle Cas. I’ll look after you,” Charlie whispered hugging her uncle tightly.
Walking into the living room Castiel sat in his recliner, placing Dean on his lap. Making sure they were both comfortable, he pressed the side button, lifting their legs up. Picking up the remote Castiel turned on the tv, putting on Disney junior.
Dean jumped in Gabriel’s arms at the new voice. As Gabriel turned around they came face to face with a short, bearded man in a black suit.
As he added a bit of pressure, Dean groaned as he finished filling his diaper, crying quietly. He felt so embarrassed.
“We’re nearly there Bud.”
“It’s okay Deany, I’m right here. I’m not going anywhere baby. Daddy’s just going to make you something to eat,” Castiel tried to de-tangle Dean’s fingers, but the little boy had a death grip on his shirt.
“Can you take the girls to bed?,” Michael asked the staff that was in the room. Seeing them look to Meg, they waited for her to nod her head to do as they were asked.
“What! I never authorized that. I saw you and Cas in the high street that’s how I found out. I was going to talk to Cas about his adoption that you two did behind my back, but I promise I was only going to talk. I wouldn’t have sent the bouncers on Castiel, he’s my little brother. Gabriel I could never do that to him.”
“Dean also needs his boosters, so can you make him as comfortable while I get them?” Dr Bailey said, standing to go to her cabinet.
Nodding, Dean snuggled into his Daddy. He was just glad Sam and Gabriel were okay.
“Sammy, Cas is going to love you,” Gabriel said, trying to sound reassuring. His little ‘nerves had clearly been making him overthink.
“Alright then, let’s get going. Say goodbye to everyone, honey.”
“What’s the matter Deany?” Castiel asked.
“Mama?” Coming out of her thoughts Hannah looked up to see Charlie walk up to them, rubbing one of her eyes with her fingers.
“Ohh, my baby. My Deany,” hugging Dean, Castiel kissed every part of Dean’s face. “My baby...I’m so so sorry.”
Getting up, Castiel walked into the kitchen, finding the red car on top of a few files on the table. Picking up everything he came back, handing Gabriel the toy. Sitting back on the sofa Castiel opened the file with Dean’s name on it. Flicking through Castiel was shocked at how little info there was on his baby.
“You are a big boy sweetpea, but it’s okay if you’re a bit overwhelmed with the crowed. It doesn’t stop you being my big brave boy.” Gabriel watched at Sam thought it over before nodding.
Gabriel didn’t think so, “Deany, Daddy’s not very good at picking cars. The last one he got was crappy...oh what was it?”
Clipping the straps together, Castiel placed Dean’s blue blanket over him. Taking hold of the handlebar he turned the stroller to head towards the front entrance.
Hannah looked down at Dean, who had his eyes on his Daddy. “Bye bye Dean, we’ll see you soon.” Rubbing her hand across Dean’s soft brown hair she placed a kiss on his crown. Dean scrunch up his nose. Everyone was kissing him. He wasn’t sure he liked that, he didn’t mind Castiel doing it but it felt different when Daddy kissed him.
“Yes, very yucky. Never again.” Castiel shook his head, remembering the horrid taste, and threw the jars in the bin. Dean smiled, glad Daddy thought the same as him.
“Na, don’t get mushy with me Cassie,” Gabriel pulled out of the hug. “Oh, by the way, your baby smells.”
“I am fine, thank you Castiel. I was a bit shocked to get a call from your brother this morning, asking me to come to your house to let decorators in to set up a nursery,” her eyes turn to Dean. Dean buried his head into his Daddy’s neck so he couldn’t see her.
“What?” Gabriel said seeing his brothers look.
After paying for half the store, Michael tipped a worker to take the bags to the car.
“Yeah...I’m fine. Just need coffee and a large bowl of candy. I talked to Cas.”
Soon as everyone was cleaned and ready Gabriel left theml to go put the stroller and diaper bag in the car. Castiel sat on the sofa with Dean feeding him a bottle. The bottle only had orange juice inside, Castiel didn’t want to give Dean formula yet after eating a big breakfast.
“Well don’t work too hard love,” Betty smiled to him before heading on her rounds.
“Is there a reason you’re bothering me, big bro?” Gabriel asked, putting on one of his fake smiles.
Lilith looked at her boss in shock. She had never seen him look so conflicted. She could see he was struggling to do what need to be done. “I’ll call him sir, and have him come here.” Seeing Michael nodded weakly, she turned to leave.
He was happy they made up but they didn’t need to squish him.
“I..orry..Dean..I...”
“Your Uncle can be a bit of an asshole sometimes, but he can be fun,” Castiel said, placing another kiss on Dean’s cheek. Hearing Dean scoff, Castiel lay him down on his back before tickling his babies belly, “Do you agree with Daddy hmm? You think it’s funny don’t ya?”
Tickling Dean’s sides Gabriel beamed hearing his nephew laughing, he could tell Dean was a car lover, he had been watching him since they entered the building, the boy was trying to look at every car frantically so he didn’t miss any.
Feeling a small bit of courage Dean hugged his arms around Castiel neck before placing a small kiss onto the man’s cheek.
“Hey Honey,” he smiled, picking the small girl up into a big hug. “Thank you for giving me the best cuddles, I feel a lot better. Are you going back to bed?”
“Hey there baby, I’m sorry. Someone else wants to come in. We need to get going.”
“Cas, I am so sorry for what happened...”
“Why De?” Sam asked. He couldn’t understand, why was Dean mad at him? He wanted to make his big brother happy. But his gift wasn’t working.
While they waited Michael and Gabriel stood in the waiting area, Gabriel was starting to feel rather nervous.
“I’ll be fine Gabe, I can do it myself,” Castiel turned to face his brother holding his baby. Seeing the tears silently falling down Dean’s cheek he just wanted to pluck his boy up into a hug, he could tell Dean wasn’t crying because of his tantrum any more, his boy was upset and afraid.
“Dean’s here?” Sam asked hopeful.
Gulping the lump in his throat, Dean shook his head.
Dean sighed. He wished they could hurry up. He just wanted to get back to Castiel and get out of here now.
Sighing, Castiel looked over to Dr Bailey. Seeing her smile with sympathy she turned to her computer to bring up Castiel’s file.
“Alright Deano you’re coming with me. We’re doing to go look at the cooler toys while Daddy looks around at the boring stuff,” Gabriel said, winking to his brother.
“Dean..Baby, it’s time to wake up.”
Opening his mouth Dean sucked on the nipple. Closing his eyes, Dean let out a hum as the warm liquid filled his belly.
Castiel sighed. He really didn’t want to be talking about this, just thinking about having Dean taken away from him made his whole body cringe. He just hoped Gabriel would be able to sort everything out with no trouble.
Feeling Meg touch his leg Dean started to scream. Kicking his legs he pushed her away, there was no way she was going anywhere near him or his diaper.
“No you’re not, big bro,” Gabriel laughed, turning away from Michael as fast as he could. He loved his big brother but he wasn’t exactly the easiest to be around. Heading to the elevator, Gabriel waited for the doors to close to let out a long sigh. He looked down at the files in his hand, enjoying the silence. He tried to clear his mind, he couldn’t wait to tell Castiel that Dean was his baby. He knew Cas wouldn’t really care; Dean was his baby with or without the legal stuff, but it was good to have so no one could take Dean away.
“Sammy!” Handing Dean over to Castiel, Gabriel stood to pick up his fallen baby. “You need to be more careful.”
“Hey..hey it’s okay Cassie,” turning his head Castiel sees Gabriel sitting in his recliner watching the TV.
Dean looked into Gabriel’s eyes. He really looked angry with him. He could understand why, he had hurt Daddy, Gabriel’s brother, all because he wanted to watch the tv. It was a stupid reason to have a fit, the man kindly let him do what he wanted and he threw it back in his face like a jackass.
“I guess he has to use it up, what is he up to to take a whole month off?”
“Okay baby, shall we go call Gabriel? He being waiting for us to call.” Standing up with Dean in his arms, Castiel made his way towards the door.
“I think our baby boy likes his toy car and is excited Uncle Gabe, we had better get there soon.” Castiel smiled as he turned back to face the front.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Turning his nose up, Gabriel pretended to be offended.
“I think someone is ready for bed,” he said to Castiel, nodding at the baby.
“Mr Novak, I never thought I’d see the main bosses down here, it is a pleasure,” the man said, looked at Michael in amazement he held out his hand.
“Gabe, he’s prefect, my beautiful baby boy.”
Seeing his boy so worked up Castiel hugged his baby close. He knew what Dean wanted, he wanted to go save Sam. Even after being away from his brother for so long Dean still wanted to protect his little brother. He was sure if he was in Dean’s shoes he would be the same.
Walking across the hall into his room, Castiel pulled back the bed covers and lay Dean down on one side of his bed.
Dean giggled at Gabriel. He didn’t disagree. Castiel might be a nice guy but he really hoped the man didn’t pick anything else like that jumper.
“No we’re all fine, thank you Gabriel,” Castiel smiled up to his brother.
“Probably not, but I’d do anything for my little bro and new nephew,” Gabriel smiled, looking back at Dean dozing in his arms. Seeing Dean still sucking on the nipple Gabriel removed it, replacing it with a pacifier Castiel had at hand.
“And just so you know, If I wanted a baby girl I would have had one. But I wanted you and you’ll always be my baby boy.”
“Of course it’s okay baby. Dean is going to love it, not because its cars but because his cute little brother got it for him.”
Leaning his back into Castiel’s chest Dean relaxed into his Daddy’s hold, it helped him forget about the awful time at the doctors. He knew deep down that Daddy only took him because he cared and wanted to make sure he was healthy. He still didn’t like that he had to go and that Daddy didn’t tell him. But it was over with and Daddy kept his promise and he was going to have ice cream for the first time in ages.
“..No!…” Dean whined, pulling at him.
Michael looks on as his brother comforted the young boy in his arms. Though Dean looked red and a mess as he cried, Michael could see that the boy was very beautiful, he could see why Castiel had chosen him as his baby. He felt so bad for what had happened, he just hoped his family would forgive him and that he would be allowed to get to know his littlest brother’s baby.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you so scary Gabriel,” Michael grinned to his brother.
“Sorry baby, he’s back with his Daddy,” Gabriel nearly felt like crying when he saw Sam’s face fall, he didn’t want to upset him. He couldn’t imagine how Sam was feeling, he knew if he had been away from his brothers for so long he would be devastated not to see them. “Would you like to see him?”
“Okay Sweets, come sit on the recliner for me, I’m going to put Dean next to you.”
Dean wasn’t fully asleep yet, he was happily dozing listening to his Daddy’s heartbeat. He couldn’t believe how much has happened in such a short length of time, it wasn’t even really a day since he was cold and homeless, now he was safe and warm. Dean wouldn’t say he was completely happy with what has happened, he got kidnapped for god sake! He never dreamed he would be laying on another man’s lap drinking from bottles, wearing diapers and sucking pacifiers. But even though Castiel had gone about getting him in the wrong way, he has been nothing but kind and caring towards him, the man had be more loving to him in one day than anyone has his whole life.
While Gabriel was grabbing a pair of elasticated jeans, he noticed his boy looking over at the girls cloths will a small pout.
Standing up, Castiel heard Dean let out an unhappy groan. Pushing the stroller with one hand, they walked into the doctor’s office. Dean held onto his Daddy’s shirt for dear life when he saw a lady smiling up at them from her chair.
“But...but I a big boy Daddy.” Sam said, looking at him unsure.
“Hmm, na, I think Granddaddy suits you, doesn’t it Deanie, is Mickey your Granddaddy now.” smiled Castiel tickling at Dean’s belly making his baby giggle.
“What makes you think you can just take him. He has not been though the mind treatment and you haven’t been through the right channels for adoption.”
Once he was on his own, Gabriel realized how he acted was wrong. Dean couldn’t physically hurt Cas, he was just a baby. Castiel was right, it was an accident, thinking of what he said about spanking Dean if he was his Daddy made Gabriel wince. Rubbing his fingers across his forehead Gabriel couldn’t believe he had been so stupid. He was glad he wasn’t anyone’s Daddy, he wouldn’t be a good one.
Laying Sam down on the bed, Gabriel made quick work getting his boy dressed. Putting on the last trainer, Gabriel stood admiring how cute Sam looked. “My handsome little man, you could break girl’s hearts being so cute.”
Walking into the nursery, Castiel walked up to the crib. Smiling down at his boy, Castiel gently stroked the back of his fingers along Dean’s warm check.
“Gabe!” he cried, holding his arms up.
Sighing in anger Gabriel walked into Michael’s office, giving Lilith a glare as he walked in.
Picking the bottle up, Gabriel looked up at him confused. Smirking back Castiel turned to his baby. “Okay baby, Uncle Gabe is going to give you your bottle.”
“Dean, please baby, you need to calm down your going to make yourself sick.”
“Sammy thought you might like to have Rosie, Deano,” Gabriel explained as he lay Sam to be cradled in his arm. Seeing Sam cuddle the bee close Gabriel wondered if he was going to give Dean his stuffy. “Sammy, can you pass Dean his bee please?”
Just as they were about to move Dean, the door to the waiting room burst open.
Dean looked on from his high-chair. What has he done? He hurt Daddy! He was going to be in so much trouble. Dean jumped when he heard the front door slam open.
Once Dean had calmed down, Castiel walked into the kitchen to grab one of the ready made bottles in the fridge and placed it into the warmer. As he waited he checked his phone to find no messages from Gabriel.
“Please baby, you can tell me,” Castiel said, rubbing his finger along Dean’s small arm.
“I...I...” she mumbled looking terrified.
Castiel turned to look at his boy. Dean looked a bit uneasy sitting in his car-seat. He didn’t bother asking Gabriel where he got it from, he just guessed it was from the warehouse.
Dean’s body shook listening to every word Meg had said. They were going to make him forget, forget Daddy and Gabriel and maybe even forget himself. They can’t do that, he didn’t want to forget his Daddy. Daddy was the best thing that had ever happened to him. It was only till now he fully realised it, Daddy was kind and loving and gave the best cuddles. Castiel had been more of a father to him in the shortest of time than his real one. Castiel really did love him, and he really loved his Daddy.
“Hello Dean, I’m your new Daddy.”
“I swear, I don’t know what you’re talking about. What has happened?”
“We’ll be fine. I think with some sleep and a very very long cuddle, myself and my Bumblebee will be back to normal, wont we baby?” Castiel said towards Dean, asleep in his arms. Dean had slept the whole car ride home. His little boy looked exhausted from the moment Gabriel handed him over. Castiel couldn’t help but think he looked almost as bad as the day he first saw Dean laying in the church archway.
“You ready Baba?” Gabriel asked. Picking his boy up into his arms, Gabriel gently bounced his shy little boy.
“I’m sorry baby, I thought you might like to play now. We can keep the tv on.” Castiel said as he sat them down on the floor. Sitting, Dean in his crossed legs, Castiel pulled over the bag of blocks they had bought yesterday. “Do you want to help Daddy build a tower, baby boy?”
“I don’t mind give you lifts Cas but you can’t depend on your big brother forever. Plus you’re a Daddy now. You can’t be walking Dean everywhere, he’s just a baby. Can you really see yourself carrying bags of heavy shopping and pushing a stroller?” Gabriel looked to Castiel again he could see the wheels in his head turning. His little brother knew how to drive, Gabriel just didn’t understand why he chose not to. Looking in his rear view mirror Gabriel sees Dean staring out the car window. “Dean, do you think Daddy should get a car?”
Feeling his belly become very full, Dean turned his head away from Daddy, there was only a small amount left but he couldn’t stomach eating any more.
Grabbing the bottle, Castiel moved to the living room to making themselves comfortable.
Taking a seat Castiel watched his brother linger next to the table. It was clear from Gabriel’s glum face that he was feeling bad. Castiel couldn’t help but scoff at seeing his brother, but looking down at Dean, who was staring at Gabriel rather warily, he could see the tension between his baby and brother. He could tell that he was going to have to do something to make things better between the two.
Parking up close to the mall, Gabriel quickly jumped out of the car exited to get his boy.
“God knows, knowing Cas he’ll probably sit in front of his TV watching Netflix the whole time. I might have to go check if he’s still alive before he is due to come back.”
Sighing, Gabriel tried to hide the disappointment on his face. Picking the boy up he walked over to on to the benches near the shoe area. Placing the boy on his lap he watched Sam stare down at his feet like they were the most interesting thing in the world.
“Not really...just got to finish this last bit of work then I’m off to see Cas.” Nodding to his computer Gabriel sat back in his chair, holding his cup close to his chest. He always liked the feel of the cup’s heat warm up his skin.
Gabriel felt his heart sink, he couldn’t believe Sam just did that. Looking to his brothers he could see they were just as surprised. He really didn’t know what to do, he didn’t want to tell Sam off. He didn’t want his baby to hate him after only one day, but if he didn’t Sam wouldn’t learn how he was behaving was very rude.
Taking his last picture, Castiel jumped when he heard a loud knocking on the front door. Moving quickly he ran down the stairs. As he walked to the door he could see the shadows of two tall bulky men through the frosted glass of the door.
“Deany, you don’t need to be big, Sam knows you’re a little,” Castiel told him, understanding what Dean meant. “He’s looking forward to playing with you.”
“What’s wrong Sammy?” Hearing Gabriel’s voice, Sam looked into the man’s grey eyes, looking unsure.
Nodding weakly, Dean choked back his tears, he really wanted Daddy to come save him now.
Recognizing Castiel place his lips on his forehead, Dean smiled behind his pacifier. Daddy’s lips were softer and warmer, making Dean feel tingly inside.
“Sam Little?” Dean asked, still confused. Sam as never a little before.
“They will be going soon,” Meg said. “One of the girls was being inspected for adoption so we put others in with her to make her comfortable, the people that came to see her just left.”
“I love you too baby,” Castiel whispered, hugging his boy. He was just so glad Dean still wanted to be his baby, he didn’t know what he would have done.
anyway thank you again to those who do like my story I hope you like this chapter :-)
Hearing his Daddy, Sam nodded with a small smile. “Yea Daddy. Can I get it? I really like it,” he asked, sounding a bit more confident in himself.
There's so much you have to know.”
“Uncle Cas is upset Baby, he’s hurt his head and he’s missing Dean,” Surprising Hannah, Charlie didn’t ask any more questions. She just looked at her Uncle with a small sad frown. Watching her girl nervously, Hannah looked on as Charlie climbed onto Castiel’s lap.
Meg looked at him with pity. She knew this was going to be hard for the poor boy to adjust, but he was going to have to if he was to be re-homed.
“I know baby, I’m nearly done.” Wiping his hand on the towel Castiel lifted the front up.
“Its all over baby. I forgive you, I love you Dean I always will.”
Let me know what you think, I will start the next chapter soon xx
Looking down at the box Dean smiled clapping his hands, it was awesome and it was from his Sammy.
“Alright Dean, it’s time for your treatments.”
“I don’t think so Castiel, he can call me Uncle or Michael,” Michael said hopefully.
“Yes little one. I wound never lie to you.” Hearing Sam sigh happily, Michael glanced to his brother to see him smiling towards him with such trusting eyes.
“...At..” Dean pointed to bag of colourful balls.
“Maybe, bye Gabe.”
“Baba, has Daddy done something wrong?”
On the other side of the room Dean saw the changing table and wardrobe. The table was the same colour as the crib, with a light blue mattress on the top. The table was fully stocked, with diaper and changing surplus. At the other side of the window was a soft, sofa-rocking chair. It looked big enough for two to sit in and be comfortable. Hugging his bee close Dean felt tears in his eyes. This was his room. He had his own room! He knew having a crib for a bed was part of being a baby, but he didn’t mind that. Anything was better than the cold concrete floor he had slept on for the past three years.
Gabriel looked at his brother in shock, he couldn’t believe Michael had done this for him. “I don’t know what to say, thank you Mikey.”
Standing up, Gabriel picked Dean up into his arms to have him sitting with them on the sofa.
“Goodnight baby, have sweet dreams.” Leaning in, he kissed Dean’s brow.
Meg looked down at the quiet boy, he looked miserable and broken, she had never seen any of the others look so mournful. For the first time in her time working, she actually felt sorry for one of the poor souls they were about to change.
So why could he still remember? Why can he still hear his Daddy’s gruff loving voice in his head? Letting out a sob, Dean couldn’t stop himself from crying loudly.
“Do you want to go play baby?” Castiel asked, smiling at him.
A diaper! Dean froze after hearing that. He was in a diaper...a diaper! And a wet one at that. He didn’t understand. Why was this happening to him. Feeling an outburst of energy Dean started to scream, and as his eyes started to water Dean felt himself being lifted up.
“By whom? You’re not taking my son,” Castiel screamed as he tried to close the door. But the men were stronger than him and storm into his house. “NO!! you can’t take him….Gabriel!!” as he screamed up the stairs, the next thing he knew he was hit the ground. Hitting his head all he could just see drips of blood falling above his eyebrow. His body numb, he didn’t feel a weight sitting on top of him. With blurred vision, Castiel watched as one of the men ran up the stairs. Trying with all his strength to move, the weight on top of him was so heavy. He had to stop them, he needed to get to Dean, he had to get to his baby. The next thing he heard makes his heartbreak, he could hear his Dean cry loudly for his Daddy as they came down the stairs.
“..ank..ou.” he whispered. He wanted to say so much more to the man that had done so much for him, he had given him the best Daddy and saved him from the hell hospital and now Gabriel had saved his little brother. He truly was a good man.
Nodding his head Dean, turned to look out the window. They were going through a town. He wondered where they were going. Turning back, Dean looked to his Daddy, confused.
The only people he cared about were his brothers, which was why he was confused. If Lilith came back with that either Castiel or Gabriel have adopted a Little then they went behind his back to do it.
Dean smirked, before holding his arms out to his Daddy, “..Da..ddie.”
Michael let out a light huff, that was the closest thing to laughing Gabriel ever sees from his older brother. Gabriel kept his eyes locked onto his brother’s. Michael had this strange power of knowing when someone is lying to him, but Gabriel was an old hand at getting past his brother, he wouldn’t have been on so many “business trips” to Vegas if he didn’t know how to lie so well.
Bring it down closer to his lips, he lightly kisses the back of his Daddy’s fingers before placing two of the fingers into his mouth.
Dean tilted his head trying to look around his Daddy but he couldn’t see with the man standing so close to him. “..No!..Dada..” he pouted, looking up with big green eyes.
“Gabe, what is going on with you?” Castiel interrupted sounding annoyed.
“What?”
“Cassy please,” Michael tried, but his little brother walked away into the kitchen, taking Dean with him.
“Gabe..Sam?”
Turning on the bottle warmer, Castiel picked up the plate. Moving over to the table he sat down with Dean in his lap. “Here you go baby,”  Castiel said, holding up the folk to Dean’s lips.
“..Da..ddie..” Dean howled wrapping his arms around his Daddy’s neck tightly.
Dean let out a small whine, he could feel his skin starting to itch. He couldn’t remember using his diaper. Out of everything, Dean really didn’t like having to wear the diapers. It made him feel icky knowing he was sitting in his own pee and poop.
Picking the box up, Gabriel smiled up at his boy, “You want it for Dean, Baby?”
Being with his brother and nephew made him feel less stressful and more relaxed, he didn’t need to worry about anything when he was with them.
“Shh..shh..I’m just going to change, Deany. I’ll be right here, then we can cuddle hmm...I’m not going anywhere I promise.”
Dean’s bright green eye’s meet with his, looking confused after hearing Gabriel talk. It was obvious that Dean wasn’t listening. Castiel chuckled, his baby was very cute in his chair with his pacifier bobbing under his nose.
Castiel looked to Gabriel confused, Dean had never called him Dad, he always said Dada or Daddy. Unless it wasn’t him Dean meant. Castiel never really gave Dean’s first family much thought, he just figured they were dead or just didn’t care that their son was living on the street. If they did care they would have tried to find Dean. Castiel knew if Dean ever went missing, he would move heaven and earth to find his baby.
“I think that sound prefect, what do you think Baba?”
“You have a bad habit of laughing at your Daddy, baby boy?” Castiel grinned, once the doctor was done.
“I’ll see you soon Castiel. You take care of that cutie and don’t worry about work, I’ll cover for you. I’ll arrange for you to be on holiday, god knows you are due one,” Hannah said, picking up her bag.
“It’ll be fine, if you’re worried about people looking at you or judging you, you don’t have to be...do you want to know why?”
After an a few hours of non-stop cartoons, Castiel looked down to see his baby lightly dozing agent his chest. Checking his phone again, Gabriel still had not called or text him. He thought his brother would have called by now.
“Okay, baby. I know you need to go and it is just me here.”
“What are you doing up so early?” Michael asked. Standing from his chair he picked up his cup to get himself another coffee. Looking the young boy up and down he noticed Sam’s diaper.
Dean nodded his head, feeling his cheeks blush. He really wanted to stay here with Daddy but he had been so naughty.
Castiel watched his baby relax under his touch. He was glad Dean was enjoying his bath, this was the one thing he had hoped Dean would like, manly because he enjoyed it too. He had always liked the idea of being able to pamper his baby when he finally had one, now that he had Dean he was going to enjoy ever minute of making his baby feel good.
Michael had been bombarding him with contracts and files on the AB program deals with the neighbouring state for the past few days. After reading numerous files on different candidates, Gabriel got half way through them before giving up for the day. He was starting to wish he could just be on holiday with Castiel. As soon as the meeting was over he legged it out of the office as fast as his legs would go, missing the unimpressed look Michael was giving him. He just wanted to be out of there and with his favourite family members.
Walking into the kitchen Castiel stood in front of the high-chair. “In you go baby boy, Daddy’s going to make you breakfast.”
“Dean doesn’t like it, so I put it back,” he said, shaking his head at the pair of them. He really didn’t see anything wrong with it.
“Okay, baby, stay as still as you can.”
After giving Dean his pacifier, Castiel stepped out of Dean’s nursery. Castiel opened the door to his room. Dean looked around his Daddy’s room. This was the first time he had seen where his Daddy slept. The room was a pale pastel green with a grey wardrobe filling one of the walls. The main thing Dean noticed was Castiel’s bed. It filled most of the room, it was big enough to fit more than two people comfortably and the covers looked soft and warm.
Rolling his eyes, Michael rubbed his hand over his chin. He knew very well the lengths Gabriel will go to keep his family safe.
“Daddy hurt himself Dean. Yes, you did drop your bowl on the floor because you were angry and that was bad, but Daddy didn’t look where he was going, and fell over. Daddy doesn't blame you.”
Feeling his Daddy’s voice vibrate, Dean turned around to placed his ear over Castiel’s heart. Dropping his bottle, he lay his arms around the sides of his Daddy’s torso, hugging the man close.
“..C..car..Da..ds” he tried pointing to the Impala.
It was by accident that Michael discovered he was the only one Castiel would listen to. Castiel must have been 8 months old and the nannies had left the poor baby crying in the crib for hours. Michael had been trying to get his homework done but with all the noise he just couldn’t concentrate. Stomping his way into the nursery, Michael found his little brother alone crying his eyes out. Feeling sorry for the poor thing he picked him up only to be met with silence, looking down at his baby brother Michael felt something in his heart lift when he saw two big blue orbs staring up at him. So much love and trust were in Castiel’s little face, seeing so much of his mother Michael just couldn’t leave him. So Michael made up his mind that Castiel was his from that day on.
Michael moved to sit next to Gabriel on the floor, “Do you really think that low of me Gabriel? I might want our company to be the best and I know I’ve been putting work first for a very...very long time, but I’m still your big brother and I’m always your brother before I’m anything else. And I know what people think of me and I don’t care really, but I never thought you and Cas would think of we like they do. I never wanted my brothers to hate me so much.”
“Don’t worry baby, Daddy has you.” Castiel smiled down at his boy before heading out to the car.
Turning round Castiel spotted Dean’s bumblebee. “Aww baby, you named your bee Rosie?”
Holding the spoon up Castiel tried again, only for Dean to turn away. “Please Dean, can you try for Daddy?”
Sam had always wanted a stuffy but the caretakers wouldn’t let him have one.
With Deans birth certificate he used it to find out about Dean’s parents. Dean’s mom had died when he was very young and his dad was registered in a neighbouring state with his other son. Looking at the police reports it kinda showed John Winchester wasn’t a good man to be around.
“I’m sure you’re not too busy to talk to your boss, surely?” a hard, gruff voice said above his head.
A short while later, Gabriel pulled up into a show rooms car park.
“No Daddy,” Sam whispered, he really did want it, but what would Dean think.
He really like Gabriel. He was funny, and always smelled like candyfloss. But a small part of him was still worried that this was too good to be true and it would all end when they went to see Dean.
“I know. Thank you for apologising to Dean, Gabe.”
Dean looked to Castiel. The man still had one of his hands stroking his cheek, his blue eyes shining with tears close to falling. This man really did care about him, wanted him, and maybe loved him.
Gabriel scoffed to himself. It was funny hearing his brother, he was starting to sound like a proper Daddy now.
Opening his eyes slowly, he soon noticed the were no bars surrounding him. Sitting up he found himself in a large, king size bed.
“We’ll leave Cas out of it for now, I’ll just go tell him that I’m taking you home.” Nodding in agreement Michael left to get back into the car.
Dean looked over to Daddy. He was leaning up against the work-surface watching them with a smile.
Gabriel rolled his eyes, “It was a last minute thing Michael. You know what Casey is like, he never thinks ahead before doing anything, and besides, our little brother needs a break and he hasn’t used any of his holiday time.”
“No, I stood behind a bush close by,” Castiel felt his cheeks redden with embarrassment.
Giggling Dean noticed Sam and Michael walk back in holding a large box.
Castiel shook his head. His poor baby. “I’m going to have to take him to the doctor for a check up. It doesn’t even look like he’s had any of his shots done since birth.”
Losing the warmth of his Daddy, Dean let out a loud whine; he didn’t want Daddy to leave him.
As he got closer to Michael’s office he found his big brother standing, reading papers in his hand. Seeing the man’s perfect face Gabriel could feel anger fill his body.
“Gabe?” Dean interrupted, he had been wanting to see his uncle, he really wanted to thank him for saving him.
“I’m not sure myself yet, Michael and I need to check up on something. Could you take Cassy and Dean home for me? He doesn’t want to be near Michael right now.”
“That is just gross, Cas” Gabriel said, turning up his nose.
“You’re all ganging up on me, you’re making my baby laugh at me,” Gabriel said, playfully pouting at his family.
“Look who’s having a cuddle with his second favourite uncle?” Gabriel said, smirking when Michael glared at him.
Castiel didn’t look to happy though. He didn’t want his baby to just be looking at a screen all day. That not what a good parent did. But the look on Dean’s face looked so happy that he didn’t want to upset him on his second day. “Okay Dean, you can watch, but at lunch we’re turning the tv off, understand?”
“I’m glad. I don’t like my favourite bro and nephew mad at me,” Gabriel said, pouting down at Dean making him giggle around the folk in his mouth.
“Do you remember having a big brother?”
“Bet he wasn’t happy with that.”
Sorry for the delay, had a to work overtime to get Christmas ready of all things lol
“You should have seen him, Gabriel. He is gorgeous and he sounded so ill. I wish I had done more.”
Gabriel sighed to himself, he couldn’t really ask Castiel to help. He needed to be with Dean and Gabriel didn’t want Dean to know what he was up to until he was sure if what he was thinking was true.
Letting Sam get comfortable against him, he gave the young boy a reassuring hug.
“Don’t be silly, just borrow some of my clothes. I’m sure I have stuff that will fit you,” Gabriel said, standing with Sam in his arms. Walking back through the hall to his room, Gabriel lay Sam down on his bed. Following behind him, Michael sat down next to the boy. As they watching Gabriel dig through his wardrobe, Michael felt something grab at his hand. Looking down he saw Sam playing with his fingers. Waving his fingers, he smiled when Sam giggled behind his pacifier. He had to admit the boy was very cute. It felt nice knowing Sam like him, he just hoped Dean would be the same.
“Dean’s bee, didn’t you give it to him?” Castiel didn’t wait for an answer when he saw Rosie sitting in Dean’s swing. Picking it up Castiel rubbed the bee’s fur between his fingers. “I’m just going to go give this to him.” Not bothering to hear Gabriel’s opinion Castiel, he heard him say something about him being soft on Dean, so what if he was his baby was upset and needed him, he headed back up the stairs. Opening the door he was shocked to find Dean wide awake.
Jumping at the loud bang of his front door, Castiel held Dean closer. Hearing Dean let out a whine he shushed his baby while rocking him gently.
Sam sucked on his pacifier faster, he didn’t really want to remember about his life before, he had been through some things he would rather forget, but he didn’t want to make this man mad. If he made Meg do as she was told, Sam felt he wasn’t someone to mess around with.
That was because he was busy looking around his big brothers nursery, it looked amazing compared to the horrible rooms the hospital keep him in. But the one thing he noticed was a fat stuffed bee sitting on the pillow in the crib.
“Charlie..this Dean he’s Uncle Cas’s baby. Do you want to say hi? Now, you have to be gentle because Dean is a little baby.”
Gabriel smiled seeing his brother in daddy mode, the man was truly in love with his baby. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Gabriel came up behind his brother looking at Dean’s sad, combing his hand through Dean’s blonde hair he kissed his nephew's forehead.
“You’re wrong there, Daddy,” Dean thought. smiling behind his pacifier. Shaking his head, Dean giggled. wiggling himself more into the man’s body.
Dean shook his head before dropping his pacifier out of his mouth, “..hun..ry..”
“Thank you Gabriel, for everything,” Castiel was truly thankful to his brother, if he hadn’t helped him he wouldn’t have his baby, and Dean was everything to him. “Really Gabriel thank you,” Castiel sat in the free chair closer to his brother, setting Dean on his lap.
Cas looked to Gabriel and Hannah with pleading eyes. He really didn’t know what to do without making Dean have a tantrum.
“Okay Sammy, would you like me to carry you or would you like to walk?” Hearing his brother, Michael come out of his thought’s to hear Sam say he would walk.
“He...my...”Dean choked back his tears. He was suppose to be Sam’s big brother and he wasn’t there to protect him.
Gabriel let out a sigh before putting his spoon down. “Michael’s scientist have made a new serum. It’s called a mind wipe, it was made to clear a person’s mind, making them mindless, they forget who they are...they forget everything. It would be like they were newborns.”
Hearing Gabriel, Dean tried to relax, knowing he would be back with his Daddy soon. But he couldn’t stop a question going around and around in his mind. Why was he taken away from his Daddy? He knew now that it hadn’t anything to do with Castiel. His Daddy would have stopped the men if they hadn’t hurt him and held him down. If his daddy could have stopped them then Dean wouldn’t have been taken to that hell.
“..No!!!”
“Thank Gabe, I couldn’t do this without you.”
“There we go, all clean,” Castiel said, patting his hand on the front of Dean’s diaper. “Right, what shall we dress you in today baby?”
Dean smiled, nodding. Splashing the water Dean giggled, doing it again getting it onto Daddy’s shirt.
“I’m nearly finished Dean, just one more,” Dr Bailey said as she rubbed her free hand across his back.
“Please Gabriel, think about it. I know Dean will be okay with you being here.” Looking down at his sleeping baby he removed the bottle, replacing it with Dean’s pacifier.  “And I want you here,” he added.
Gripping his Daddy’s shirt Dean hid his eyes into Castiel’s shoulder. He didn’t want Daddy to think he was rude, but Dean still didn’t feel comfortable around new people. Feeling a soft pat on his diaper bum, Dean peaked up at his Daddy, hoping he wasn’t mad.
Castiel grinned at his boy. “Alright then, if it makes my Deany happy I’ll get a car,” he said, glaring back to Gabriel.
Nodding his head, Sam watched his Daddy leave the room. Hearing the shower start up, he tried to relax. He knew Daddy was coming back, wasn’t he?  He didn’t like being on his own. Feeling anxious, he started to feel tears run down his cheeks.
“Really?” Michael said sounding hopeful.
“..You were...were gone Daddy?” Sam hiccupped into his Daddy’s shoulder as he grabbed at his shirt.
Opening his mouth, Dean let his Daddy put the nipple in. If Daddy said it was good then he would give it a try. Feeling the warm liquid hit his tongue Dean hummed happily. It tasted of vanilla and coconut and was one of the best thing he had ever tasted next to Gabriel’s pancakes, of course. Sucking on the nipple he drank his bottle quickly. Enjoying the feel of his belly being warm and full, Dean closed his eyes.
“Are you excited Baby?” Gabriel asked, looking back at his boy.
Dean’s eyes followed as his Daddy walked over the wardrobe, picking out a blue and white striped romper suit and a pair of white booties and mittens with a matching stripy hat. Dean pulled a face looking at the clothes Daddy had picked. They looked like something a newborn would wear, he was starting to wonder if that was the age Castiel was wanting him to be. Guess he kinda was considering this was only his second day at being Castiel’s baby and he had the mobility of an infant. It didn’t bother him much, but he did hope he wasn’t going to be this helpless for the rest of his life.
Dean sucked away, drinking down the cool juice. When Castiel showed him the bottle he wasn’t so keen to try it, but surprisingly when he sees Castiel frown a little he lets the man put the nipple in his mouth. He didn’t know why it bothered him but he didn’t like seeing the man upset.
Castiel frowned at the apologies. Lifting Dean’s head off his shoulder Castiel waited till his baby was looking at him before speaking “Shh..shh its okay baby, I know you are. Daddy is not mad with you, you don’t need to keep saying sorry.” Slowly bouncing his baby Castiel walked over to the rocking chair. Lying Dean across his lap Castiel started to rock as Dean sank into his hold.
“I’m coming to look at Dean’s nursery I didn’t get a proper look then I got the blankets,” he explained as they walked into the room.
“Right, where shall we go first?” Gabriel asked, walking next to Castiel.
Wondering down the ales he soon found Michael and a crying Sam sitting in a rocking chair in the baby play area.
Dean wasn’t sure how he felt about being kissed by his kidnapper, he should be screaming and fighting back, but when Castiel talked to him he felt kinda relaxed and calm. Maybe Gabriel gave him something else to make him that way.
“Oh yeah, I bumped into Mr. Happy Cappy upstairs. Why are you doing all this Michael?”
Dean looked along the row. Two of them were mid 90’s Ford Mustangs, another was a 70’s Cadillac Eldorado, there was two new cars one was a Ford SUV and the other was an Audi Q3.
Gabriel stood behind, watching his little brother. He really couldn’t understand why it was difficult for him to just pick. Looking down at Dean, he saw the boy watching Castiel too. The boy hadn’t taken his eyes off the man the whole time, the baby must be warming up to him. Suddenly, an idea popped in his head.
“...ye..” Dean nodded his head. If Daddy said it was okay he might eat it.
“Sammy, please give Dean his bee now,” Gabriel said sternly.
“Sorry baby. I said when lunch was ready it was time to turn the tv off,” Castiel said as he undid Dean’s straps.
“Really how?”
Hearing the small noise Cas slowly rocked his baby. “Hey...baby you’re okay. You are Daddy’s special little man,” Castiel continued to rock. Hearing the boy let out a sigh, he lifted his baby up. Castiel gently placed a kiss on Deans crease brow.
“Deany, would it be okay to give Sammy your present for him?”
“I want to go back and check something, will you come with me?” Gabriel asked, Michael looked into his brother’s grey eyes, unsure.
“Na, he’s fine where he is,” Gabriel looked up at his little brother, smiling. “I like this,” he added before turning his gaze back to the baby.
“Why can’t I come?”
“Yeah Uncle Mickey, you family too,” Sam said, copying his Daddy.
“Silly,” Dean mumbled looking up at Gabriel.
“Did my baby miss me?” Castiel smiled, picking him up into his arms. Nodding Dean cuddled into Castiel’s shirt. “My special boy,” Castiel murmured, kissing Dean’s hair.
Castiel looked at his brother worryingly, it didn’t normally take such short time to get the new babies ready. “How are they ready? it takes three to four weeks for them to be ready, they need time to get settled in their new lives before going to any family.”
“Let’s go have a look at your room, Deany,” Castiel whispered, looking down at Dean, who was now looking round from Cas’ neck.
Dean looked at his Daddy, unsure. What was he doing to do?
“It’s okay honey, just try and remember in future. Now Becky, you can head home we’ll see you tomorrow.” Seeing her babysitter nod before leaving the room, Hannah kissed Charlie’s cheek before turning to Castiel. “I’m sorry Castiel, I wasn’t sure how long you were going to be so I asked Becky to pick Charlie up from daycare and bring her here. I hope it’s not too much trouble.”
“Okay then, let’s get going. I think we’ll order takeaway tonight celebrating Dean getting his first car, what do you think Daddy?” Gabriel asked, tickling Dean under his chin.
Dean let out a small whimper, his bladder twinged as Castiel lowered him into the soft seat.
Walking onto the office floor, he ignored all the onlookers and whispers around him. There was only one person he was here to see.
Gabriel couldn’t take his eyes off the young boy, he was very cute with his long brown hair.
“Alright you two, that’s enough now. Come on baby girl, we need to get going home.” Hannah held out her hands to a pouting Charlie, who wrapped her arms around Gabriel’s neck. Rolling her eyes Hannah went to pick up her child. “We’ll come back soon honey, we can even get Dean a present for next time.”
“Really? No wonder you’re giddy like a school girl,” Gabriel laughed.
Dean wasn’t aware of what was going on around him, he was feeling so relaxed cuddling into his Daddy. He like feeling Castiel’s skin against his own, it felt nice being this close to his Daddy.
“We have been shopping, haven’t we Samuel?” Michael said towards the young boy on his brother’s lap, “I’m sure you noticed the nursery arrived.”
“Well I’m glad you were there to sort them out, Munchkin.” Gabe said, kissing his nephew’s cheek.
“I’ll do this quick,” she said, with a sympathetic smile. Seeing the boy look so calm, she wasn’t looking forward to making him upset.
“You going to hear from my bosses about this,” Meg growled stepping out of the way.
“Let’s go shopping Sammy,” Gabriel sang, opening the back door.
Dean was still laughing while Castiel cleaned his face. Even though these men had taken him against his will he hadn’t felt this happy in years. Having a laugh was something he had always thought was what families did, but he never experienced it for himself until now. It felt good, so good that Dean even starting to think he liked his new life.
“But he hurt you,” Gabriel said, pointing to Castiel now badged arm.
Watching Michael leave, Gabriel turned to go into the kitchen.
Squealing loudly, Dean grinned in shock into Castiel’s shoulder. He really thought he had upset his Daddy. Castiel repeatedly kissed his face, making his baby giggle. His boys laugh sounded so little and cheerful, he was overjoyed to see his baby so happy.
“Are you going to dress that boy Cassie or is he going to be living in diapers all day?”
“Trust me, Gabriel, John Eric Winchester will soon be getting what is coming to him,” Michael smirked drinking his coffee.
Nodding, Dean sighed heavily. This was a lot to take in, he couldn’t believe what had happened to Sam. How could John do that to him? If only he had known, he could have done something.
“I called the bouncers,” she said looking away from her boss. “I was just doing what I thought you would want.”
“Whatever your planning in that scary mind of your Michael, please be sure the boys never find out what you are up to,” Castiel said knowing if their older brother already knew that little bit of information, Michael had a plan for John Winchester and it wasn’t going to be good.
“It’s quarter past eleven Gabriel.” Michael stated, raising his eyebrow at his little brother.
As Castiel walked into the kitchen he found Gabriel and Hannah sitting at his table drinking coffee.
“Doggy..Daddy!” Sam said, holding it up towards his Daddy.
“Don’t play stupid, you self centred prick, Where is Dean?”
After what felt like an hour of non-stop cuddles, Castiel decided it was time to move. Though he would have loved stay there all day, his arms were starting to hurt.
Michael sighed looking up from his computer. “I wanted to surprise you, so I ordered the best toddler set that we make and Samuel has been my little helper and picked out what he wanted.”
“Come on baby Dean. I think you might like it...come on open wide.” Gabriel rubbed the nipple along Deans lip consigning them to open, but Dean was having none of it. Giving up Gabriel placed his finger and thumb over Deans nose, causing the boy to open his mouth to breathe. Taking a breath, Dean suddenly felt the large rubber nipple. Pushing it with his tongue he tried to push it out, but Gabriel had a good hold on the other end.
“I didn’t meet him once. I happened to have walked the long way here and checked to see if he was okay. He was awake with a hot drink when I passed. He has amazing green eye’s, Gabe.”
“Your bouncers came and took Dean from Cas. They came in knocked Cas to the ground, held him down and took Dean,” Gabriel could feel the tears in his eyes again but he wasn’t going to let his so talked big brother see him cry.
“Gabe?” Dean mumbled into his Daddy’s shirt. He wanted to see his Uncle, he needed to see him.
“Hey my Bumblebee, did you have a good nap?” Picking his boy up, Castiel checked Dean’s diaper to find it still dry. Sitting down in the rocking chair, they sat quietly letting Dean wake more.
“You all done baby?” Nodding, Dean wiggled trying to make himself more comfortable, he knew he needed to pee and maybe poop, but he was trying so hard to hold it. He really didn’t want to use his diaper in public.
“We had better get downstairs before Uncle Gabe eats all the food.”
“Hey Cassy, how are you?”
“In restless dreams I walked alone, Narrow streets of cobblestone, Neath the halo of the street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp.”
Stiring his sleep, Dean slowly opened his eyes when he heard his Daddy humming. He had missed hearing his Daddy’s voice, he had missed everything about the man he truly cared for more than anything.
Dean snuggled into Castiel’s shirt breathing in his scent, he was just so happy to be back with his Daddy. “..Miss...uw..”
“Hey..hey little man, why are you crying?” Placing the bags down on the bed, Gabriel lifted Sam up into his arm, “Baby, what’s that matter?”
Dean felt surprising warm. He normally wasn’t when he woke. Feeling something pulling at him he stretched out. It must be PC Bill trying to move him again, he thought. “I’m up Bill, I’ll start moving in a bit,” Dean groaned, starting to wake up. Hearing mumbling, Dean opened his eyes, expecting to see a stone wall. Instead he saw a pair of black shoes near to his head. Looking up, he saw Gabriel sitting in a chair, staring down at him. Suddenly he remembered he wasn’t at the church. He had been kidnapped.
Shaking his head Dean looked up with teary green eyes. Sighing to himself Gabriel put the fork back on the plate.
“..Lov..uw..Dada..”
“Gabe,” Castiel stood shocked, his brother has done so much for him. Walking up to Gabriel, Castiel pulled him into a hug. “Thank you.”
“Where did you get this? I thought you were just going to get diapers.”
Laying Dean in his crib, Castiel brought the blankets up over his baby.
Crying harder Sam pushed himself into his brother. Hearing Dean was he still love him was all he needed.
His Daddy!
Walking up the stairs, Castiel walked into the bathroom. Sitting on the edge of the tub with Dean on his lap he put in the plug. Turning on the water he added a small bit of lavender bubble bath, knowing it would help his boy relax and get sleepy. Turning to Dean, Castiel lowered him down onto the floor. Laying Dean down he started to remove his baby’s overalls and onesie, seeing Dean in just his diaper made him look so vulnerable and cute. Removing Dean’s wet diaper Castiel lifted him up and placed him in the warm water.
“Sammy, why don’t you and Uncle Mickey go and get the present you got for Deany?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Castiel chuckled to himself. He did love how bold Charlie was. The girl might be a “little” but she was an old head on young shoulders.
Dean opened his eyes to see what was going on, he had never seen people act the way this family did. Seeing everyone acting so happy and loving, it did make him wonder why his real family wasn’t the same. He had only a hand full of happy memories, all involving his mom before she died, everything after was just...well, he didn’t really like to think about it.
Why did Daddy want him to stay still? Peeking through his lashes he could see Daddy looking down at him, his bright eyes looked down at him with so much love.
Gabriel picked up his remote to turn the TV off. “I did. I wanted to get you something so I popped into the company’s warehouse, Michael gave me a key,” he smiled. “While I was there I went on the computer and made an order for your nursery to be set up while we’re out shopping today. It should be all ready for your boy when you get home. I also called Hannah to be at your’s to let the decorators in to your house.”
Gabriel smirked to himself, he was so glad his nephew’s pout didn’t work on him. “We can play more after your nap buddy.”
Glancing from his bottle Dean smiled when he sees Gabriel walking past with Sam...and Rosie? Why did Sam have his bee?
Dean looked up at jumper the man held up. It was bright yellow with a brown teddy bear on the front. Was Castiel serious? That thing was ugly. He really hoped the man was messing with him.
Dean wasn’t happy with how Sam was acting. The Sam he remembered wasn’t ever rude like that. Sam was always polite and kind. Even with a father like John, Sam knew his manners, mainly because Dean made sure he did. He knew their Mom would be ashamed if her boys were rude towards people.
Sitting up, Castiel picked up the cloths from the floor. Unfolding the onesie, Castiel sat Dean up to pop his head and arms through the neck and arm holes before laying him down on his back.
Michael watched the interactions between his brother and Sam. It was nice to see his brother so happy and content. Growing up with his brother he always thought Gabriel was a bit of a lose canon, he could be reckless, but to see him playing with his new son, it was good to see the responsible side to his middle brother.
“Yes Samuel?” said Michael when he heard his nephew.
Feeling a hand take a hold of his, Dean looked down at Hannah, “Daddy will be back in just a minute Dean, you didn’t tell me what your bee’s name is.” Dean pulled his hand away, he wanted his Daddy not Hannah, why was she getting in the way. Letting tears fall he started to cry, he was tired and hungry, he just wanted to cuddle like Daddy said they would.
Castiel sighed happily, leaning into Gabriel. It was good to know his baby was really happy and settled. Looking down at his sleeping boy, Castiel could feel a weight being lifted. He didn’t think his day could be ruined by anything, knowing that his baby loved him.
Watching Castiel and Dean go into the kitchen, Gabriel moved Sam to be cradled in his arm. “Are you doing okay Sammy?” he asked as he rubbed his finger along Sam’s warm cheek.
Dean smiled, he really did have the best family. Wrapping his arms around Castiel’s belly, Dean rubbed his face into his Daddy’s shirt. “Love...ou.”
“Yes Mama,” Castiel smirked. Seeing Hannah give him another look, he waved his friend off.
“Boring. Michael has me going through the names of the new candidates he has come by, he’s been driving me mad Cassie,” Gabriel groaned.
Raising an eyebrow Michael nodded before heading up the stairs doing as he was asked.
“Hmm? What’s wrong my Deany?” Taking the bottle away Castiel helped his boy up and started to rub his baby’s back. Maybe he needed burping early.
Leaning into his touch, Sam lay his head onto the man’s shoulder. Breathing in Gabriel’s scent of candy and coffee he started to feel calmer. He didn’t know why, but he liked being close to him.
“Daddy?”
“I don’t always depend on you. I told you I’m happy walking or even taking a bus,” Dean crinkles his nose at hearing his Daddy. He hoped his Daddy wasn’t changing his mind. Dean didn’t like the idea of being on a crowded bus full of people staring at him. Shaking at the thought Dean pulled on Castiel’s shirt. “..no..Dada..no”
“I try Daddy..no one came..” Sam mumbled wiping his nose into Gabriel’s shirt. “I sorry, I not mean to hurt De.”
“Deany, I promise this will be nice. Look, I’ll even try it.” Putting the nipple in his mouth and drinking a small bit, Castiel let out a hum. “Ohh, it is very nice.”
“Dean had to use his diaper, he was a little bit embarrassed,” Castiel said, grinning foolishly.
Hearing her phone go off, Hannah picked it up to see she had a massage from Gabriel.
Gabriel sighed, leaning against the wall he slid down till he was sat on the floor. “I’m sorry Michael. Castiel found Dean himself. I just wanted to help him, so I convinced him to have Dean become his little and because of your rule on couples only, we were worried you would think Castiel cheated you of profit.”
“Fine, only coz you asked so nicely,” Gabriel said sarcastically, getting up from his chair Gabriel headed to the kitchen.
“You talk to him this time?” Gabriel asked, raising his eyebrow.
“Okay, baby, it’s your turn. It will only take a few minutes, then we can go get ice-cream with Uncle Gabe.”
“Sure, I’ll get us a beer while I’m at it,” he said, walking into the kitchen. After a minute or two Gabriel walked back in with a warm bottle and two cold beers.
Stepping into the room, Sam look up at him with the biggest smile. Seeing Sam jump off of Michael’s lap his new little boy ran toward him wearing one of his old shirts and diaper.
Dean was feeling pretty awful, he was tired and hungry. His eyes were stinging from all the crying he was doing. He was alone just like before. Even though he was comfortable in his soft blankets he was wishing he was cuddled up with his Daddy, but he guessed that wasn’t going to happen anymore. They were probably arranging to have Dean taken away because he was so bad. Feeling his eyes start to water Dean groaned. He didn’t think he had any tears left but just thinking of leaving made him feel even worse.
Dean looked up at Gabriel he didn’t want to go with him he would rather stay with Castiel. “...nu...” he whined, shaking his head.
“I’m sorry baby, I’ll try and do it quickly.” Going quicker, Castiel moved on to the diaper cream.
Hearing a sniffle, Gabriel saw his baby start to calm, rubbing his eyes into Michaels shirt.
“God, the boy weighs nothing Cas,” Gabriel said pushing Dean’s limp body into the car. Pulling Dean in under his arms, Castiel placed the brown haired boy’s head into his lap as Gabriel places his legs in and shuts the door. Dean looked peaceful as he slept. Castiel smiled as he combed his hand though Dean’s greasy hair. Feeling the car start, Castiel didn’t take his eyes off his boy as they drove to Gabriel’s house.
Glancing over Castiel saw Hannah was looking away from them, clearly trying not to laugh. His baby on the other hand looked at him nervously.
A short while later Sam came back smiling, with arms full of different clothes. “Daddy...Daddy can we get these?”
“Yes Uncle Gabe, Deany is in big trouble. He laughed at his Daddy,” Castiel said, acting shocked.
“You’re getting a small rash baby, we’ll put some cream on after your bath.”
Crushing the dog into his cheek Sam grinned, “Thank you De.”
“They’re fine, we’ve left them snuggled up together on the recliner.” taking a seat Castiel picked up one of the cups. Seeing his brothers do the same Castiel smiled into his cup, it had been a very long time since the three of them had been at a table together that didn’t involve work.
Dean looked down at the colourful bricks Daddy held in his hand, they did look fun but he wanted to watch his show. He was really enjoying watching this cartoon Daddy had put on.
“Did your first Dad have that car?” Dean nodded, happy his Daddy understood him. Feeling Daddy hug him close Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel neck hugging him back.
Dean felt his heart stop. What did this Gabriel mean by new daddy?
“Anyway... on a different subject, how’s Dean?” Gabriel asked giving his older brother a worrying glance before looking towards Castiel.
“I can’t say no to the prince and his jester, we’ll take both.”
Sound asleep in his bed he found his brother with his arm protectively around his baby. They looked so beautiful he couldn’t stop himself from taking out his phone to take a few pictures of his precious family.
Without saying a word Gabriel walked out of the room followed by Michael, not caring for anyone around them. He was taking his nephew home and he pitted any fool that tried to stop him.
“Yeah, yeah!” Charlie clapped her hands. Smiling, she turned her head to face Dean.
“Long night dear?” she asked, placing a hot cup on Gabriel’s desk.
“Right, where shall we go first?” He heard Michael ask.
Michael glanced up to his brother, looking confused. “What do you need?” he said wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. He would do anything for his brothers right now, just to make things right.
“What is it Baby?” Seeing Sam glance up, Gabriel just smiled at his boy, “You can ask me anything.”
“And I have missed you, you will always be my baby.” Michael beamed seeing Castiel turning red.
Hi all, sorry it took so long to post, its been a hard and stressful week, but its finally ready.
Feeling his cheeks warm at Daddy’s nickname for him, Dean glanced to Sam to see him watching him. “..Hun..gry..”
A short while later they arrived at the local mall. Parking up close to the entrance, Gabriel opened the bout getting the stroller out.
Grinning widely Sam nodded before jumping off his Daddy’s lap. Letting Sam wonder off, Gabriel watched his baby pick up a purple onesie with white puppies all over it. Seeing the boy hold it up towards him with wanting eyes, Gabriel nodded making Sam bounce happily.
Nodding, Dean gave a weak smile before closing his eyes again.
Whining Sam snuggled into his Daddy’s chest, he didn’t realise he had used his diaper. “Sorry Daddy.”
“Come on buddy, you can talk to me.” Gabriel smiled at him, tickling Sam under his chin.
Michael had thought he had been seeing things, that he was just tired from work and imagined seeing his brothers walking down the street with a stroller in hand. But he had seen them, he even made his driver turn around to pass them again to make sure. After he walked back into his office, Michael ordered his receptionist Lilith to bring him any recent files that involved Castiel’s or Gabriel’s names in an adoption.
“When you looked up the name we gave you, you said the was two Winchesters, who was the other one?” Gabriel asked.
Dean ignored him. Feeling Gabriel’s fingers run across his sensitive skin covered him in goosebumps.  For someone who had kidnapped him, Gabriel was surprisingly gentle as he worked.
