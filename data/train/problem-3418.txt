And the more he thinks about it, the more he realizes that’s been true for a long time. Years. As a matter of fact, Dean can’t remember a time where Cas wasn’t just
“Now, Bass I could see bending over, but you?” Lee shook his head before pinning Dean with a knowing look. “You, Dean. What would your daddy say if he knew…?”
And this – Dean’s hands sneaking under his shirt, seeking bare skin; breath hot in his ear as Dean does his best to keep control of himself – makes Castiel push against his physical boundaries, endless, timeless,
Dean can hear his precious coffee dripping onto the kitchen floor, though he probably won’t need any now that he’s had his daily dose of adrenaline,
“Iced coffee?” Castiel asks, and Dean nods, already reaching for his wallet and pulling out a few bills. Dean pays for his coffee, and Castiel and Charlie seamlessly switch places so Castiel can take care of Dean’s order.
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel murmurs back, trying to calm his suddenly racing heart, butterflies let loose in his stomach. He’s spent twelve years thinking about every possible reason not to, but…
“I feel like such an idiot,” he muttered, pressing his forehead into the shower tiles and rolling it back and forth.
“Yeah, Sammy. It is.” Dean is glad they’re on the phone and not face-to-face for this. “I get it, man. You really like her. Can’t blame you. She’s great.”
Sam gave him a wry look. “As sure as I ever am about anything,” he answers, grinding a pestle into their old stone mortar like it had harmed him personally. His hair falls in his face as he works, obscuring his expression, but Dean can hear the tightness in his brother’s voice. Good to know they’re both freaking out, then.
Castiel looks at Dean with a wary expression, and an unexpected pang in his chest has Dean tightening his grip on Cas as he says in a muted voice, “Don’t look at me like that, man. We just got you back. Right now all I care about is getting you safe, okay?” He draws back far enough to press his palm to Cas’ chest and thinks he’s never been more grateful to feel someone’s heart beating beneath his hands.
Dean can hear the smile in Sam’s voice when he says, “Of course, Dean. And, seriously, I’m happy for you. I haven’t heard you sound so excited about something in a long time.”
Cas paused, then nodded slowly, his expression softening a little. The hand on Dean's hip traveled forward, resting against Dean's stomach, the angel's finger's bending a little, the tips brushing against the hunter's skin in a light caress. "It does not, indeed."
“Come in,” he whispered, stepping aside, and John all but dragged himself inside the house. He didn’t even wait for Bobby to close the door before he vanished into the living room, and the older hunter followed him shortly after, knowing exactly where he would find the other man.
His eyelids slipped shut eventually, but he didn’t fall asleep. He felt light, floating weightlessly, like he was stuck in that weird limbo before you actually fall asleep.
Ellen raised her bottle in the air, and when she spoke again, her voice was trembling audibly, a shaky, watery smile curling her lips.
So naturally, Dean didn’t dare to send even a single glance over at him before he nodded, squaring his shoulders a little. “Okay,” he said. “So, what’s the game plan here? You sneak me in there, and then… what? How am I supposed to find Cas? You said the place’s pretty big.” Maybe they
to open up about it. He was sure that Cas would be okay with waiting a bit to tell everyone, that the angel would understand. Hell, Cas might even suggest it before Dean could bring it up himself, because the angel was just that good at reading him, at guessing exactly what the hunter was thinking.
Dean couldn’t for the life of him find his voice to reply. Cas’ hand was working him so expertly, so
Right. So the damn hex bag had been cause of that weird fogginess in their bond, and it had probably also been the cause of that odd pressure in his sternum, Dean realized.
Clearly, six feet deep in the earth just wasn’t enough for a hybrid not to be able to smell anything.
“I mean, haven’t we gone over this already? This game is already getting pretty old, don’t you think? Three times for you, Dean, and once for you, Cassie.”
Castiel pressed his lips together, feeling a painful tug at his heart at the mention of Dean. So Benjamin didn’t know yet.
Unsurprisingly, Cas had still seemed hesitant to go to bed and sleep, mostly because he was afraid something would happen to Dean while he was unconscious and he wouldn't be able to do anything. It took fifteen minute of Dean telling him that he would be fine and reminding the angel that he needed to rest properly to until Cas finally relented, but with one condition.
He would be lying if he said he didn’t feel the weight of Sam’s eyes on him, following him all the way to his car.
“Why are you awake?” Cas’ question was low, the words dragging on his tongue. He was clearly still half-asleep.
There was just something about Sam’s tone that rang a weird note in Dean’s ear, and he got even more intrigued, frowning a little as curiosity sparked to life in his chest.
Cas’ nod was slow, like he wasn’t sure where Charlie was trying to get with that. “Yes, I most likely would. I cannot think of a warding strong enough to prevent that.”
He changed the damp cloth once more, as well as exchanged the bandage on Cas’ arm for a clean one, before walking back out to the living room. The couch wasn’t a pull-out, so the cushions would obviously be a tight fit for Dean, but he knew he could manage. He couldn’t bring himself to even consider sleeping in the bed with Cas, even if the mattress was easily big enough for the two of them. He knew he would feel better if he spent the night close to the angel to keep an eye on him, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. It felt
Well, Dean had no idea where this was going, but he had to admit he was a little intrigued. He and Cas had been wondering about what Gabriel might be planning for a while now, but they'd never gotten anywhere close to figuring it out. This, however, might be a start. “Meaning?” he asked.
Charlie let out a breath at that, her eyes almost sympathetic. “Sam, you know Dean. He’s terrible at, well, actually talking about things.” Sam let out a low, agreeing huff at that, because yeah, understatement of the century. “But he’ll open up eventually. He actually came around and told you about Cas, didn’t he?”
And yet, Cas had still rejected him, had still run away like Dean had the fucking plague or something, which meant that the problem
That one was going to take a while to get used to. “Fergus, darling, I told you I would be going out for a few nights.”
He crouched beside Dean, before offering his brother the glass, the gesture a clear repeat of what had happened in this very bathroom the day before. “Thought you might want this,” Sam said.
The Mark was all but howling at this point, loud and overjoyed, but Castiel found that he no longer had the energy to push it away.
Tossing the bottle aside, Dean got himself ready, leaning over Cas with one leg on each side of the angel, looming with his ass just over Cas’ cock, lowering himself just enough that the tip of it was pressing against his entrance.
And the worst part of it? It wasn’t that all crazy, wasn't completely impossible, as his mind had been screaming at him earlier back at the cabin. A guy getting pregnant was nowhere near the craziest he and Sam had seen over the years, it was actually pretty chill in comparison to most of the crap they had dealt with. Hell, compared to everything he and his brother had gone through, that was almost
And it wasn’t like Dean could throw this on Matt either, because that just wouldn’t be fair at all. Sure, Dean didn’t like the guy, but he shouldn’t try to turn Ben against him. That would be too low, not to mention petty, and Dean just wasn’t that person, so he couldn’t tell Ben that he wasn’t going on the trip because Matt wouldn’t want him there or because Dean didn’t like the guy. He wouldn’t do that, as unhappy as Dean was about this whole thing, because he just wasn’t that person.
Dean clenched his jaw, using his fork to move his pie around on his plate. His shoulders rose and fell in a small, halfhearted shrug. “Yeah, well, that’s still better than him being dead. It’s better than the first plan we had.” If they’d actually followed through with that one, if they’d simply let Jack go full-supernova and ice both Chuck and Amara, then Billie would have taken over. Jack would be dead, and Billie would have claimed the mantle of God for herself and ‘set everything in order’, ‘put everything back where it should be and reset the order of things’, which meant that all the people who'd crossed over from other worlds would be sent away, back to worlds that didn't exist anymore, and anyone who'd died and had been brought back to life at some point would be dead again. Hell, even Sam and Dean wouldn’t be alive right now, and neither would—
“Dean, I... I think Cas is right.” Turning his head, Dean fixed his brother a glare, which Sam promptly ignored. “I mean, I don't like this either, but... we’re not looking for a fight. He’ll just try to talk to Cain.”
Castiel saw the exact moment when Dean and Sam seemed to put the pieces together, when they finally seemed to realize what exactly the message the angels (and Dean) had received had been about. Sam tensed up visibly, his knuckles turning white around the handle of his blade, though he did not glance down at Castiel to confirm his thoughts on the matter, to find out if his guess was in fact correct. Dean, however, did turn his head to look at Castiel, and the seraph hesitated for a moment, feeling the strong wave of fear and panic that flowed into the bond coming from the human. For a few seconds, Castiel attempted to steady himself at least a little bit by taking in a slow, deep breath, before finally turning his own head to meet the hunter's inquiring gaze.
Jacques? What if this whole thing was nothing more than one of Speight’s famous, ridiculously elaborate pranks?
“Damn it, Crowley,” he whispered, shaking his head and slowly getting back up to his feet. Part of him was still just a tiny bit hopeful that maybe Crowley would lend them another hellhound, as farfetched (and maybe a little delusional) as that sounded, because that would certainly make things a lot easier for them while they looked for Cas’ Grace here in this town, but apparently that wouldn’t happen. They really were alone on this one, it seemed.
, and he wasn’t sure where Tom was anymore, but he still tried to get back to his feet, still tried to put up a fight. However, a hand curled itself around his throat before Castiel could actually get back to his feet, and suddenly he was standing again, but his back was being pressed forcefully against the wall right behind him, an iron fist wrapped around his throat, easily holding him in place while also trying to suffocate him.
Gabriel straightened up in his cell, and his expression shifted, features suddenly a lot darker than they’d been before, more somber. Even his voice sounded lower when he pointed out, “It sounds like you’re talking from experience.”
“I’m pretty sure you mean bad month,” she quipped back as shrugged off her stained jumpsuit, which she quickly tossed inside her locker, leaving her in the old, worn clothes she had been wearing underneath her work ones—a pair of jeans torn at the knee and a shirt that had definitely seen better days, which all basically screamed, ‘I’m being worn right now because it really doesn’t matter if I get stained in grease and motor oil.’ There was a small smear of grease on her cheek, and Dean hoped she was going to stop at home and take a shower before her classes, but considering the state of her clothes, he assumed she probably would, so he didn’t comment on it.
us to think we have no other options, because that way she can get us to do her dirty bidding—like killing her freaking
Where the fuck was Crowley, though? Dean’s finger was itching on the trigger of his gun. He really wanted to just try and take a shot at that bitch right now, since her back was turned to him and no one had noticed him yet, so he might have a clear shot.
That was enough to get Miracle moving, and the dog let out a tiny little excited bark as it shot up from the floor and darted across the room, launching himself up in the air as he jumped up onto the bed. Dean couldn’t help but smile at the display, hands instantly moving to pet him. He knew he’d been neglecting the poor puppy these past couple days, and he was very intent on making up for it now.
“And these last few weeks, whenever I looked at Dean, whenever I tried to talk to him… I saw it happening all over again. The lost, hopeless look in his eyes, the way he just… doesn’t care, about anything. He’s not eating right, and he’s probably not sleeping too—I mean, we’ve both heard him, wandering about late at night, and I can see the bags forming under his eyes. I’m pretty sure he's lost some weight, too. And the drinking—don’t even get me
But so far, Dean hadn't yet managed to figure out which side was currently winning. He’d stayed up all night battling with himself, trying to decide what the fuck he should do here, and when morning finally came, it found him wide awake and terribly tired, not to mention incredibly nauseous again, even if there certainly wasn’t anything left in his stomach for him to puke out. Actually, his stomach was very much hurting now, aching nonstop, the pain sharp and pretty damn difficult to ignore, but Dean had no other choice but to try to do just that.
The angel’s arms slid over the hunter's skin again, though this time they were retreating, releasing Dean’s body as the angel pulled them back, and Dean immediately missed the contact, feeling his damp skin far too cold without the angel’s strong arms wrapped around him.
He'd only seen it after he'd thrown up. He'd figured he should take a shower before going back to bed since he was awake again and already in the bathroom, suddenly feeling bothered and dirty in his own skin, in
was the one in the wrong here. “You know, I bet you’re not even doing any schoolwork on there. You’re just acting like an asshole because you want to screw me over.”
Dean wasn’t sure what he meant by that, but he looked serious, so in the end, the hunter simply shrugged, pocketing the hex bag without further questioning. He didn’t feel any different, but he figured the magic must be working already.
Sam’s reaction, but he definitely heard the small, frustrated sigh that his brother let out, because of course he did. Sam could be one annoying, grumpy little bitch sometimes.
A gunshot rang through the air, so loud and sudden that Castiel actually jumped, and in the next second, the pressure in his chest disappeared—all of a sudden, it was just
The only part he couldn’t quite figure out was the third line. ‘A memory frozen in time, only a few months of peace remain.’ What could that be alluding to? What was Dean supposed to understand from it? It must have something to do with how Cas had torn the Novak family apart, of course, as that seemed to be the common theme here, but what did that mean, exactly? How exactly could this—
“Anything you need,” she whispered into his ear, her voice trembling a little, sounding hoarse and a little choked up, “Any questions you have—just pick up your phone and call me, okay? Don’t forget I was a mother once. I did the whole pregnancy thing—the morning sickness, the mood swings, the revoltingly impatient bladder. I’m here, for whatever you need, okay?”
Dean could only nod numbly in response, finding no point in arguing, because Cas' words did made sense, as unhappy as the hunter may be about it. Gabriel had zapped them to this house, anyway, so there was no way that anyone could have followed them here, and the archangel was (supposedly) distracting Heaven and keeping an eye on the Stynes, so they should have at least a few more days of calm before sticking around in the same place for too long actually became a problem.
“When Jess died, I was… lost. It just happened so fast. I mean, for four years I was studying and working on my future, and I was just
The gate was closed, locked for the night, but jumping over the brick wall right beside it was as easy as walking to him now, and Dean landed easily on his feet, barely making any sound as his boots connected with the soft grass on the other side.
Benny was either completely oblivious to how utterly uncomfortable Naomi looked, though, or maybe he was just choosing to ignore it. If Dean had to take a guess, he’d choose the latter.
" Dean begged, cutting Cas off before the angel could finish that sentence, "Just... just go. Please, I don't... I really can't do this. I can't deal with this right now."
He strayed clear of the alcohol section, though. He wasn’t sure if he would be able to control himself if he looked at a bottle of Bourbon right now. He had been itching for a drink for
But Dean didn’t laugh, because how the hell had he not seen this before? How had he not realized it? He was eating a lot lately—the days he didn’t feel sick all the time, that was—and a lot of weird stuff too. He seemed to have taken a liking to cream cheese and pickles especially, and
The main reason why Dean had so vehemently refused to make a move at first was because Cas was a hybrid, which sounded pretty ridiculous now, over three months later. He remembered thinking that he couldn’t
But before he said anything, he needed to know what exactly Sam knew. “What did Crowley tell you?” He didn’t want to overshare over the phone. And it would also be good to know just exactly what he would be walking into once he and Cas got to the Batcave. He had to know just how much Sam knew beforehand so he could figure out how exactly he was going to tell his brother the rest of the story. "I just want to know we’re on the same page,” he added, hoping Sam would buy the explanation without questioning it.
hated that guy, and he’d been so relieved when Mary had broken things off with him after that piece of dirt cheated on her, and then so absolutely freaking
The first thing that came to mind was to ask her why she hadn’t told him sooner, but he held that question back before it could actually slip from his lips, because he knew that wasn’t what Charlie wanted to hear right now. She was upset, and very much so, but she had every right to be—Charlie and Gilda had been together for what, four years now? That was a long time, so of course this wasn’t easy. Dean had been sure they would be getting married soon, but apparently that wasn't going to happen now.
echoing over and over again inside his head, but things were surely bound to change when the life of his child was also on the line, so of course his protective instincts would kick in now.
As soon as Cas’ deep azure eyes focused on him, the angel’s face fell, the anger that had been so clear on his features quickly replaced by a mixture of guilt and concern. The seraph’s wings drooped behind him, and the thunderstorm of emotions that had up until then been pouring into the bond nonstop faded in just a second, the connection growing duller, quieter as the angel most likely tried to reel it all in, that familiar wall suddenly going up, blocking their connection—although none of that really helped all that much. The Mark was already awake, and Dean had a feeling that wouldn’t change anytime soon, even if Cas actually managed to calm down. It just wasn’t that easy.
Cas before it’d taken him away, and for a second, he couldn’t help but imagine the same thing happening to
Those words were definitely not what Bobby had been expecting to hear—really, they weren’t, but regardless of that, they were still enough to have a wave of relief washing over his entire body like a tidal wave. He let out a breath he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding, shaking his head as he took off his cap and ran his hand through the handful of thin, short hairs that covered the top of his head.
Dean turned his laptop around so that Cas could see the news article displayed on the screen. “Three bodies completely drained of blood. All of them were found in the woods, and there are two people still missing. Probably just an average vampire case, if you ask me, but I still think it’s worth checking out.”
As surprising as it may be, this was actually the first time Dean was having sex here in his room, on his own bed. Every single one night stand he'd had ever since he and Sam had moved into the Bunker had taken place at a motel, at his partner-for-the-night's residence or in the backseat of the Impala, even the ones from nearby, because of course he couldn't bring anyone to their secret lair. That would be incredibly stupid, not to mention dangerous.
of yours. I would very much like to test it out, in fact, so I can decide if it’s effective or not.”
And when all that started to happen too much, and Dean knew Cas was getting close to the edge, he would pull back, going back to delivering soft, short licks to the angel’s cock instead, once in a while letting his tongue circle the head or follow the pulsating vein on the underside, sometimes even dipping his tongue into the slit at the tip, before he was sure he’d staved off Cas’ orgasm enough that he could wrap his mouth around that gorgeous dick again without ending the party too soon.
Dean held back a wince at those words, though he only managed it because he had already thought about this before, so he hadn’t exactly been caught off guard. Still, it was freaking
But he couldn’t think of the alternative, either. He couldn’t even consider it. Cursing Sam, making his little brother go through the literal
been keeping an eye on things, so they were definitely bound to stumble upon a case eventually, and Dean had been very well aware of that.
Maybe something happened? Sometime between the time Sam and Dean had left last night, and the time he and Cas had arrived here today? Maybe something had finally changed her mind? Dean wasn’t sure what could have caused this clear improvement in her attitude—he couldn’t even imagine it, really—but regardless, he was pretty relieved.
It wasn’t exactly cold outside, which disappointed Sam a little. He really wished it was colder, that he could feel the sharp, stinging bite of the cool wind against his skin, burning when he pulled it into his lungs. At least that way, he would be able to feel
Crowley turned his head, raising an eyebrow in question, a silent request in his eyes for Sam to elaborate.
For the millionth time, Dean cursed the Mark in his head. His hatred for it seemed to grow stronger every day. It wasn’t just affecting him now; it was also trying to kill Cas, and that just seemed so much worse in his mind. Still, Dean failed to see the point Cas was trying to make here. He still didn’t get the bad side of Cas’ Grace taking longer to burn out than it would without the bond. “But Cas, if we’re buying you more time…”
And as that thought registered in his head, for a brief moment his mind traveled back to an issue that had been plaguing his thoughts quite a lot a few weeks back, but that had vanished from his mind in the past few days, for obvious reasons. But it was back now, and in that moment he couldn't quite push it away. The weight brought on by the doubt of where Cas was; the crippling fear that maybe he might actually lose Cas and the baby now settled over his heart again, and with it came the thought that he had once more been too much of a coward to just fucking open up, and maybe now he wouldn't have the chance to.
It was very hard to believe just how different things had been less than 4 months ago. That night in Montana, all Dean had been worried about was Cas’ well-being, the Mark and, well, where they had stood. He had been tiptoeing around Cas at the time, still unsure about why the angel had left him in Nebraska in the first place, terrified that Cas would just want for him to go away once he woke up because Cas
Dean closed his eyes, letting out a breath through his teeth as the very obvious meaning behind those words weighed down on his thoughts. Cas had a point, he knew that, but this whole thing was still a little too much for him to process. He was still having trouble with thinking that he wasn’t eating only for himself now. Still, yet again, he doubted arguing with the angel would get him anywhere, and anyway, Cas also had to eat. “Alright, we’ll pick up some breakfast on our way to the cabin, then.”
It was just his luck, really, that something like this would happen when Cas wasn’t around—when Dean couldn’t even reach the angel through the bond. That was just plain, patented Shitty Dean Winchester Luck.
"It's weird. The Mark has been bothering me for a while, ever since what happened back at the cabin," Dean commented, his voice low and weak, nothing more than a murmur, "And now it's just... completely quiet. It's not even burning or complaining at all. I mean, that's kinda weird, right?"
Letting out a breath, he opened his eyes again and adjusted himself on the grass, sitting down properly on the ground, not even caring that he was probably getting his pants all dirty. He rested his arms on his knees, making sure he was staring right at his mother’s name when he started talking again.
Dean closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath as he stood behind Cain, each word a punch to his chest. That hadn’t what he had wished to hear, although it certainly wasn’t unexpected.
Three shots later and he was already beginning to feel a little lighter, but it was only when one third of the bottle was gone that he actually felt his thoughts finally getting fuzzy and his pain starting to grow duller. Over half the bottle was gone less than an hour later, and by then, Dean was pleasantly unaware of pretty much anything going on both in his head and around him.
He saw the exact second Cas understood. The angel’s eyebrows shot up without a warning, undoing the confused frown that had been firmly placed there until then, and the next thing Dean felt was the angel applying a little more pressure to his stomach to feel the hardness better.
that he got whenever he lost Cas—or the fact that he’d been doing such a poor job of hiding his internal turmoil that apparently, Sam knew
“Pontiac Public Library,” Dean read, and of course that name put yet another confused frown in his brows. “Why would Gavreel give us the address to a public library?”
He was grabbing his car keys again a moment later, and soon enough he was driving around town until he finally found what he’d been looking for—a drugstore.
There was a heavy pause, during which Hannah seemed to once again contemplate his words, which at this point, considering everything that was happening around them, was a lot more than Castiel had expected of her. He wasn’t sure what to make of her expression, however; could not decide whether or not the fact that she was at least willing to allow him to explain himself could still be taken as a good sign. He wanted to believe it was, that it meant he still had a chance of convincing her that he was innocent, that he might still be able to sway Hannah's judgment somehow, but he found that he couldn’t make himself fully believe that, not when the look in her eyes had become so cold.
Sam's eyes snapped up, and he looked a bit surprised to hear his brother's sudden request, like he hadn't realized he was being so obvious. He cleared his throat only a moment later, though, quickly shaking off his surprise. He looked back down at his food, moving a small piece of yellow egg yolk around in his plate with his fork as he said, "Last night, Charlie and I came downstairs after you and Cas went to bed to take a last look at all the research. You know, to organize everything, see what we could save and all, and... well, we were a bit surprised with what we found."
But he felt like he needed this now. He wasn’t sure why—really, he had no way to explain this—but he just felt like he needed to come here. Maybe because his mother was the only member of his family that he could visit now, or maybe he just really needed to see his mom—or maybe both. He really had no idea.
A pair of hands grabbed his head at some point, and before he could fully process what was happening, before he could even
“Since you arrived in this town, you’ve only sought me out for one thing—to deliver bad news, and that normally includes another body showing up. Not to mention that it’s been a few hours since the last one.” Cas swallowed thickly, audibly, like there was a lump in his throat. He still refused to look at the hunter as he repeated, “So who was it?”
"It would explain a lot, honestly," the hunter agreed. "He's been helping us a lot, and he doesn't actually need to do that. He doesn't
He nodded against Jack’s hair, and his voice came out low, struggled, nothing more than a choked, trembling whisper when he replied, “It’s me. It’s me. I’m here. You’re okay now. You’re safe.”
But he’d wanted to. Fuck, the night Sam had left to go to Stanford, when his brother had simply stormed out of that motel room to go off and chase his dreams, Dean had had half a mind to go after him, to go
Sam didn’t sound frustrated or angry, which was a pretty big change from how he’d sounded last night. No, instead, he sounded… worn, tired, like he, too, didn’t actually want to be having this conversation right now, like this was all straining and exhausting for him too. Come to think of it, it probably was.
“We can do this, Dean,” she said, finally breaking the heavy silence floating over both of their heads, and from the corner of his eye, Dean could see the redhead turning her head so that she could look at him. He wasn’t sure what look he would find in her eyes if he turned his own head to look at her, but he didn’t move to find out, instead insisting on just staring ahead at the closed garage doors.
Another step back. Dean’s hand twitched, but he refrained from lifting it to his stomach and resting it protectively over his bump. This wasn’t even real, so it wouldn’t make sense for him to do that. They were in his head, and his baby was safe in his womb back in the real world, far, far away from here. Nothing that happened in this place could actually harm the nephilim.
Cas didn't respond right away. He glanced down at the two trays carefully cradled in his arms as soon as those questions were out in the open, for some reason refusing to look up at the hunter for a long, silent moment, during which Sam's questions floated in the air between them like a dark cloud, thick and heavy and completely unwanted. Sam knew that silence couldn't possibly mean anything good, and he felt his stomach sink to the floor at that thought, but he still remained silent, simply waiting for the angel to speak again.
“I asked—” Meg growled, leaning closer to Ava’s ear, her voice even sharper than before. She shook the girl a little too harshly, and Ava whimpered, even if she apparently couldn’t breathe. “Do you
He knew his best bet was to drop the wendigo to the ground, but that proved itself to be infuriatingly difficult when you literally had no freaking thumbs. He couldn’t get a good grip on the creature’s body, couldn’t grab it and throw it around—no, all that he managed to do with his paws was push and scratch, which clearly wouldn’t be enough to accomplish what he had to do, so he had to find another way.
exactly he was. All he knew was that he was covered in a thin layer of sweat and his lungs ached, struggling to pull in enough air. His body felt warm, making him uncomfortable as his entire body was filled with pure discomfort. He looked around, registering the room around him but not entirely recognizing it. It had wooden walls, he could tell that much, which were covered in symbols. It was dark, too, and through the window he could see forest. A cabin, then. But why…
However, the Mark hadn’t been helping at all, making what would already normally be something Dean would struggle with into something even more difficult for him to deal with. Ever since that moment back at the cabin, ever since Dean had first heard Cas’ confession, the thing had decided to make its opinion on the matter known whenever any thought about that subject as much as crossed the hunter’s mind, whispering venomous, hateful words into his ear, which of course did the very opposite of helping clear up his mind.
At that thought, the human turned a bit on his spot in the backseat of the Impala, throwing what he felt must be the hundredth glance over at where Sam and Charlie were still digging. It was nighttime now, and since they were literally parked in the middle of nowhere, with no streetlights to be seen for miles, all that surrounded the car was pitch black darkness, except for the two slivers of light provided by the Impala’s headlights. The front of the car was pointed right at where Sam and Charlie were working so that the pair could see what they were doing, which also allowed Dean to watch them dig, watch as they steadily removed shovel after shovel of dirt from the exact same spot where Dean himself had been buried years ago, but that now supposedly housed the one thing that could fix this entire situation, the one thing that could save Dean, Cas and the baby. He really wished he could help with the digging, though, because one more pair of hands would definitely make this go a lot faster, but he knew he couldn’t do that. He shouldn’t put his body through that kind of strain right now, especially not with Cas so weak. Something like that might actually only make things even worse, so Dean had no other choice but to just sit this one out, staying back in the car with Cas, trying to keep the angel calm and make sure that he made it through the next few minutes without any issues.
Dean knew there was nothing else Cas could say to him that would soothe his mind, so he just nodded, settling against the angel once more and deciding it was really best to just drop the subject for now. He was already feeling nervous about the actual birth, random yet very vivid flashes from all the movie scenes he'd seen in his life of women in labor deciding to make an appearance right then just to make him feel even more terrified, but he pushed it all away. He really didn't need that right now.
Dean had struggled a bit to sit up on the bed so that he could eat his meal, since the pain in his back and wings was clearly still very intense and bothersome, but once he was finally upright again, his discomfort seemed to lessen, or at least become a bit easier to endure, so Dean had proceeded to pretty much clean his plate in record time (and he'd seemed particularly pleased about the pickles and mayonnaise, just as the angel had hoped he would be). And for dessert, the hunter had happily eaten his two slices of strawberry pie, and it had warmed Castiel's heart to see the smile that had formed on Dean's lips while he'd enjoyed the treat, like something as simple as pie had suddenly made his day a thousand times better. Dean was obviously still in quite a bit of pain, though, grimaces and winces taking over his features every time the human as much as shifted on the bed, but the food did seem to cheer him up a little, and that was already enough to make Castiel feel a lot more hopeful about the human's recovery.
At that thought, Castiel spread his wings, ready to fly to Heaven and meet whatever fate awaited him there after everything he had done in Hell. Before he could actually take off, however, he glanced down for a brief moment, for no more than a second, and as he did it, he caught a glimpse of something lying on the grass by his feet. He frowned because of it, and actually had to do a quick double take, looking back down at the ground to make sure that he'd seen it right, that his vessel's eyes had not deceived him.
He frowned at that discovery, then blinked his eyes open slowly. His vision refused to focus properly at first, everything far too blurry and weird, but eventually, his eyes finally decided to cooperate, which allowed him to figure out the reason why he couldn't move—or, well, why he couldn't move his hands and feet, at least.
“Dean?” Charlie’s voice reached his ears, coming from a few feet behind him, but Dean didn’t trust his balance enough to turn back around and face her.
Castiel shrugged lightly. The blood bag in his hand was almost half-empty, but it still carried more blood than Dean's. "For doing this—coming to this town with me and helping me find Meg. I understand that this was a very difficult decision for you, and it is not my intention to belittle or dismiss your struggle with it in any way, so... thank you. I really appreciate all you've done to help so far."
But just like Charlie had pointed out, there really wasn’t anything he could do right now, so he just had to suck it up, swallow down the uneasiness he could feel bubbling up in his gut, and wait until Cas was finally ready to fill them in on his mysterious plan—which hopefully wouldn’t take
that was Cas’ mouth around him, pleasure shooting through his entire body in waves with every lick from Cas. Dean arched off the bed again, his hand shooting straight of Cas’ hair as the angel continue to have his way with him.
"Yeah, okay," he breathed out, voice sounding a bit hoarser than he'd intended. "I'll... I'll wait, then. Just... tell me if I can go up there after he eats. If he feels well enough for it, I mean."
Dean tried to shake the guy’s hand off of him, but Castiel didn’t even budge. Why the hell was everyone so much stronger than him? For fuck’s sake. This wasn’t fair. “Dude, you mind?”
“You know,” Sam started, though he had to pause when his voice failed, breaking at the end of the second word. He cleared his throat, which felt awfully dry all of a sudden, then swallowed, before trying again, “You know, I never… I never actually thanked you, Cas.”
Well, that made sense, Dean thought. That was basically how dark magic worked, after all—you got something from it, something that normal, clean magic couldn’t provide, but there was always a price to pay—usually, a pretty high one. Frankly, now that he thought about it, maybe they should have predicted that a sacrifice would probably be required for the spell.
At some point, Cas slid in a third finger of his own accord, without even needing to be told to do it. He was a fast learner, apparently, and Dean couldn’t be happier about that.
Cas didn’t ask any more questions, much to Dean’s relief, but the hunter could still feel Cas’ inquiring gaze on his back as they walked the small distance to room #17.
Some of that defiant spark vanished from Lily’s eyes as soon as she heard those words, but before she could say anything in response, Dean let go of her, moving his arm up as quickly as he could and without thinking about it at all. And before Lily could have a chance to react, he gripped his machete with both hands and pushed it forward, driving it into Lily's flesh easily, cutting the hybrid's head clean off, only stopping when the blade hit the wall right behind her.
Dean felt Cas let out a small breath as he shifted a little. The angel’s lips brushed briefly against Dean’s cheek. “I saw… flashes, of Hell, and of...” He swallowed, “Of you losing control.”
And as Dean let his eyes take in the sight of all those cells, he finally realized that he and Gabriel were not alone in that room. In fact, all the cells close to his own seemed to be occupied, and through several rows of thick, metal bars, Dean could see a few more pairs of eyes staring at him, displaying a wide range of emotions—from confusion to curiosity, mingled in with distrust and wariness.
And even though Dean’s warning did get the hound’s attention, even if Juliet moved a bit to the side in reflex, head snapping around so she could find whatever threat might be making its way toward her in that moment, the angel still managed to hit her, burying her blade right into Juliet’s side.
He lowered the phone and ended the call, staring down at it for a moment before he finally raised his head to look at Dean again. His eyes were… fuck, they were
Still, it wasn’t like this supposed meeting would happen tomorrow. They still had over two weeks until Ben got back from the ranch, over two weeks for Dean to try to get used to that idea, or to try to find a way to get out of it, if he changed his mind about this. So he ended up nodding in the end, letting out a low, “Yeah, sure.”
Something must have shown on his face, because Cas had quickly added, "There's no need to worry, Sam. I can keep Dean sustained for weeks. My Grace can handle it."
through it, more than once, though the last time he'd lost Cas had definitely been the worst one. Watching Cas die last year, kneeling beside the angel's unmoving corpse,
Charlie’s smile seemed a bit more genuine this time, but the sadness was still there, shining clearly from her eyes. The sight of it broke Dean’s heart a little, so he raised his arms and beckoned her forward with a small, whispered, “Oh, c’mere.”
“Thirty years, Dean. That’s your number.” Another laugh, this one just as throaty as his previous one, although somehow even uglier.
So, I could write a whole freaking book about everything I hated about that finale—well, about both 15x19
Again, he knew Cas wouldn't be happy about this, or at least he was pretty sure the angel might still not be totally on board with this idea, but if it became necessary, if it meant saving the lives of both Cas and the baby, then Dean would do it without a thought. They might no longer even have a choice on this, and that thought alone was enough to break Dean's resolve.
The next silence that filled the air was still a little heavy and tense, but not nearly as suffocating as all the previous ones. Claire’s shoulders were still a little stiff, but Dean really couldn’t sense any anger emanating from her, and that was progress, right? It had to be.
Still, at least when they finally got to the Bunker, maybe Cas would finally rest a little. Sure, the angel had gotten about three hours of sleep after Gabriel had been here, but that definitely wasn’t enough. And by the dark bags that were starting to form under the angel’s eyes, even those few hours hadn’t provided any rest.
With one last nod, Hannah turned around and left, walking quickly and leaving Castiel alone in that room for the first time.
how it works, the more easily I can find the right spell, and the faster I can act when we need it. It’s just… a necessary evil, but that’s it. I don’t actually
However, as he glanced at Cas again, a curious thought occurred to Dean. He had never wished to get caught up in the whole Apocalypse thing the way he had, nor had he wished to go to Hell, but if he could go back and somehow make things different, erase all those things from his past... he wouldn't. Because if there was anything,
When he got back to the parking lot, Castiel was waiting for him in the exact same spot where Dean had left him just a handful of minutes prior. The hunter waved the key to their room in the air as he approached him, and Castiel gave him a small, acknowledging nod before he stepped sideways, allowing Dean to open up the Impala's trunk so they could get their stuff. Dean grabbed his duffel bag, while Cas pulled both his bag and the damn cooler box out of the trunk, and once again Dean did his best not to think about the second one as he closed the trunk with a loud bang. He locked up the car quickly and started leading the way toward their room, and Castiel followed him without a word, carrying the freaking cooler calmly and without a care, like there was nothing wrong in the freaking world.
Dean let his eyes slip closed, letting out an annoyed sigh, which came out very similar to yet another huff. “Okay. Now what?”
Dean frowned, glancing briefly at Cas, who wasn’t looking at him anymore, but instead watching the floor like it held the answers to all of their problems. For some reason, Cas refused to look up, and Dean took that as a confirmation that Cas had indeed not told him everything there was for him to know about the soul bond.
“Just like deep down you know that this thing you have with… Castiel, is it? That poor excuse of an angel. Whatever that is, it’s not going to last.”
“Fuck,” Dean breathed out, chest heaving as he stared up at the ceiling, sagging completely against the sheets as he slowly came down from his high. His entire body felt loose and pliant, arms and legs feeling like jelly, wings hanging limply in the air underneath him as they phased through the bed, completely freaking useless. He twitched his fingers when he felt their tips tingling, until the feeling in them began to slowly return.
Sam held on to that last thought tightly, like his own life depended on it. He shook his head and let out a tired sigh, before typing out a reply.
“And that’s your body telling you that you’re not resting for only yourself anymore.” Dean swallowed, looking down at those words, the weight of them making it hard for him to look at the archangel in the eye as their meaning floated in the air around them. Gabriel then turned on his seat to look at Cas, “You too, little bro. You shouldn’t pull all-nighters very often. You need rest too, and don’t try to tell me otherwise. You're linked, Cassie, so whatever you do has an influence too, you know that.”
And everything about that story had led them to believe the previous owner of the truck, Billy’s brother Joey, had been the one to do it.
Castiel nodded, smiling at Dean in spite of his current preoccupations. He could certainly drink coffee at this moment; it usually helped him a lot. “Thank you.” He took the cup from Dean and raised it to his lips, taking a careful sip of the hot liquid. He had grown accustomed to drinking coffee even as an angel, a habit he had developed while human, but that had lingered, even after he’d regained his angel status.
Dean shook his head at her. He understood that they wanted to help, that they felt like they needed to do something more than just sit around and wait until the situation was handled—really, he did, and if he were in their place, he knew he would be making the exact same offer.
“I just ask that you don’t question the daughter any more, agents.” When Dean turned to glance at the guy, he was surprised at the sorrowful look in his eyes, an almost haunted expression taking over his features. “The kid is pretty shaken up. She doesn’t want to talk anymore, and I don’t think we should make her.”
Sam frowned, wondering who the hell that could be. He wasn’t expecting any visitors, and Jess was at the hospital—and even if she’d
“Not now,” Dean replied just as lowly, “We gotta make sure the Stynes aren’t following first. We can start working on the codex for now.”
before he decided to throw a tantrum and go against all of our Father’s plans. Honestly, though, I’m pretty sure the reason why Lucifer did everything he did to get cast out happened
"Juliet!" Dean's voice suddenly cut through the air, shouting out the hellhound's name so loudly, with so much panic coating that single word, that the sound managed to travel out of the cabin and reach Castiel's ears.
One question was still bouncing around inside his head, though, the doubts that accompanied it growing more difficult to ignore with every minute that passed. Dread had settled in Dean’s gut since the moment he’d first realized Eldon was a Styne, and now it was just sitting there in his stomach, heavy and uncomfortable like a block of freaking lead.
He couldn’t focus on anything else. All he could see was that blood—warm and fresh, a beautiful shade of red, dark and thick and
Cas was deliciously hard already, and Dean would have smirked if he wasn’t still busy sucking at the angel’s tongue. Instead he just let his palm grip Cas’ warm cock, swallowing the moan that brought out of the angel greedily before he began to carefully work his hand over the angel’s shaft, squeezing and tugging as slowly as he could manage right now, just to feel it harden and thicken in his hold, enjoying how Cas’ hands moved to his shoulders and would tighten in time with how Dean’s hand moved, loving the way the angel’s breath shook and low whines would escape Cas’ mouth in response, how his hips were starting to thrust up and into the hunter’s hand already, practically begging to Dean to pick up a faster pace.
Also, he had feeling that pain wouldn't fade as the minutes passed, that it wouldn't gradually grow weaker until he could at least try to ignore it, which meant that he definitely wouldn't be getting up from that floor anytime soon.
to take off the Mark. And when she’s done, after she gives us what we want, then… we deal with her, however we need to.”
And as soon as his cock was free, fully exposed to the cold air of the room, Cas’ eyes immediately moved down to stare at it. Dean’s dick twitched at the undeniably
Sam’s eyes softened a bit at his brother’s tone, turning almost sad. “Dean, I just… I want you to be happy, that’s all.”
There was a hidden meaning to Cas' words, that same dark, ugly one that Sam hadn't managed to say out loud earlier, and that the angel apparently didn't want to voice now either. But Cas didn't need to spell it out; Sam understood what he'd meant to say perfectly.
that he even had to explain this to Cas. “Azazel was the demon that killed my mother and pretty much destroyed my life, then got my father to kill himself and go to
Cas looked away this time, glancing back down at his hands to avoid Dean’s eyes, almost like he was ashamed, which Dean honestly couldn’t understand. Briefly, he wondered how to reach out to Cas with his mind and try to read what the angel was feeling through the bond, but he was pretty sure Cas might be blocking him right now, or at least he was just being careful not to project. Dean knew he would be doing the same thing if the roles were reversed. He couldn’t feel anything coming from Cas right now, and he didn’t even know what he was doing anyway, so he wasn’t sure how to reach out in the first place to find out if he was really being blocked. He wondered if he would learn how to do it at some point, or even if he could do that at all.
“No,” Dean let out, shaking his head, “Anything else. Anything. Just don’t…” He could feel the panic flooding his insides. He had never begged for anything in Hell, never, but this wasn’t about him. This was about his baby, and he wouldn’t let Alastair hurt his tiny ball of light. He struggled against his retrains, but that was useless, and all it truly did was hurt him even more. He ignored the pain, though, because that just
Sam pretended to dodge a few bread crumbs that flew his way, scrunching his face up even more in clear disapproval of his brother’s manners. Dean smirked at him in response, and only chewed even more enthusiastically with his mouth open.
making an effort to eat a little more healthily, but sometimes he just felt like he would die if he tried to swallow another fucking leaf.
“No, I didn’t find Cassie’s Grace there,” Gabriel said, and Dean’s hope immediately deflated a little. He felt his shoulders sag a bit as he let out a small, disappointed huff, though maybe he shouldn’t have allowed himself to grow so blindly hopeful to begin with. Gabriel wouldn’t be doing all this storytelling right now if he had already found Cas’ Grace. Dean should have seen that response coming, though his completely thoughtless reaction was only further proof of just how truly desperate he was at this point.
“And you didn’t even flirt back,” Charlie pointed out, her tone light and clealy joking, although Sam was pretty sure he could hear a hint of curiosity in her voice, “She looked pretty disappointed, you know. And she was pretty cute.”
Benjamin simply nodded, still staring at Castiel like he had just grown a second head right in front of his eyes.
“They wouldn’t have anyone to feed on, for one,” Cas pointed out, then shook his head. “No, I don’t think that’s it. But it does feel like they’re… preparing for something? I can’t imagine what it is, either, but I know we need to figure that out soon. It can’t
Carefully, Dean unzipped the bag, glancing into it, only to find himself staring down at the seven angel feathers they had that belonged to Cas—four black and three gray. He let out a small breath at the sight of them, reaching into the bag to pick one of them up and lifting it slowly, letting the black feather rest on his palm as he stared down at it, running his fingers gently over its soft surface, almost afraid that he might break or damage it somehow, even if he knew one of these feathers would be ruined to perform the spell.
"She does," Cas nodded again, "And I do not see why he would complain. It seems like you'd be doing him a favor, as this would be something he would have to take care of himself later on."
. He remembered nothing of what Michael had done while wearing his body, because the hunter been a little too busy for that—trapped inside his own mind, constantly drowning and fighting for air, thrashing in the deep, dark waters of his mind, clawing at invisible walls and metaphorically screaming himself hoarse, but he was never able to reach the surface, no matter how hard he tried. He was never able to break free, and he knew for a fact that he hadn't been the one to eject Michael, because apparently, he just couldn't
Gabriel’s eyes were closed in concentration, a crease visible between his browns. His lips moved quickly and with precision, pronouncing the words of the spell without pause. Both Charlie and Crowley also had their eyes closed, and briefly Sam wondered if Juliet was looking away as well, maybe even hiding behind the couch or something to try and block out the light somehow. He had no way to know.
And then there was an Angel Blade being plunged into his chest and he was dead, just a motionless body lying on the floor by his own feet. The place lit up a moment later, allowing him to see what he assumed to be hundreds of copies of himself, all dead, some apparently having been killed more violently than others, most of them lying each in a big pond of dark, crimson blood.
Meg smiled at the hunter once she was finally holding the clear plastic body of the syringe in her hand, that dangerous spark in her eyes even more obvious now, so much that it was actually unnerving. Dean felt his stomach sink down to his feet at the sight.
“Can I…?” Sam looked up at Dean, snapping him out of his thoughts, and Dean was surprised by the heaviness in his brother’s voice; by the way it actually trembled. He looked up and found that Sam’s eyes were actually glistening a little bit, which took Dean completely by surprise, so much that his mind failed to understand what exactly Sam was asking him right then.
Yeah, Bobby, I gotta agree with you. I also think that promise will come back to bite you in the ass someday... ;) ;)
He wasn’t sure where he was or how he had gotten there as he opened his eyes, all he knew was that he had just had one of the freakiest dreams of his entire life. He squinted against the brightness of the room around him, feeling the sunlight hitting his face and making his eyes burn with discomfort, forcing him to squeeze them closed once more. He felt tired, his muscles heavy and stiff, though the warmness that surrounded his entire being felt pretty good, engulfing him in some sort of cocoon.
They were up and preparing to travel as soon as they were done with lunch, as much as everyone wanted to just be lazy and rest after eating, they couldn’t, since they had to leave St. Louis now, before the Stynes found them.
Dean had never done anything like this, had never been so... comfortable with being this close to someone, not even with Lisa. It just had never felt so... right, for lack of a better word, an embrace so warm and comfortable his muscles all but gave up on working. He wasn't used to cuddling, and whenever anyone had tried it, he had fled soon after, as soon as they were asleep, because Dean Winchester just didn’t cuddle, and he definitely was never the little spoon in the few times he had cuddled. But this was
It burned—that was the first thing that registered in Dean’s mind. Whatever had been inside that syringe felt like freaking battery acid once it flowed into his body, forced into his bloodstream as soon as Meg pushed the small piston inside the syringe forward with her thumb. And it spread fast, too—it was only a matter of a few seconds until Dean felt his entire body burning up, like his blood had suddenly been replaced by hot, molten metal.
Castiel felt his stomach sink down to the floor, and he swallowed drily. “What bad news?” he somehow managed to ask.
Dean was aware that he might actually be bordering on actual paranoia at this point, but he was pretty sure he was entitled to.
However, Bobby knew that he had no way to know that for sure—not without seeing it with his own eyes, not without tracking Dean down and finding out the truth for himself.
Dean wouldn’t sleep, though, of course not. He’d been unconscious for over two damn weeks, so obviously he didn’t want to go back to that.
Dean walked out of the kitchen without another word, only to find that Juliet had relocated to the living room, where she was currently lying right in front of the fireplace, occupying the exact same spot she'd chosen when they'd first gotten to this cabin with Crowley. She perked up as soon as she saw him, though, and she was quick to get up, tail moving back and forth excitedly. She wasted no time to trot over to where Dean was, as well as to follow the human out of the living room and into the hallway, letting out a low, happy bark as she proceeded to sniff at him. And as they walked side by side down the hallway, Dean noticed it was almost as if she was escorting him somehow, a thought that had the human smiling down at the hound and placing a hand on her back. He didn't even need to lean to the side to do it because of her size, he noticed. She really was enormous, even for a hellhound.
a good idea (he and Dean had a lot of experience in that department), but the clock was ticking and their time was running out, so what was he supposed to do? He couldn’t possibly just sit around and wait for Dean to come back when he knew there was a chance that might not happen. Dean’s life was on the line, hanging by a thin and fragile thread, even if his brother refused to act like it.
With an annoyed huff, Dean shook his head at them and turned on his heels, finally losing his patience and deciding that he would just have to figure this one out on his own.
He frowned down confusedly at the bag, because that should be in the trunk. He remembered setting it down exactly there earlier, but he also knew that he had put all the bags back inside the trunk and that there hadn’t been any left as he’d closed it, or at least he thought there hadn’t been, anyway. Now that he thought about it, though, he didn’t remember picking that one up at all, either. He eyed it for a second, still unsure, but ended up brushing it off after a moment because maybe the loud music playing had distracted him and he hadn’t seen it there.
He remembered Crowley trying to tell him what to do, just as he remembered pushing the King of Hell to the floor and all but threatening him without a hint of hesitation or fear. He remembered killing Lester, too, just as he remembered beating up Cole Trenton to a pulp and then letting the guy go, just so he would suffer with the knowledge that he had been able to do nothing against the monster that had killed his father. The symmetry of that had been too precious for Dean to ignore it, and he had loved it at the time, found it amusing, brilliantly so.
No, as soon as the angel was gone, Dean's entire body collapsed, limbs simply giving out, crumbling under him as his hands and feet seemed to no longer be able to support his weight. He fell on his stomach, body hitting the cold floor with a low, muffled thud—so he really had fallen off the bed, then—gasping for breath, heart beating so loudly in his ears that he was sure everyone else in the Bunker could hear it, the erratic, frantic drumming of it seeming to be echoing off the walls all around him. His heartbeat didn't slow down as the seconds went by, though, and at some point, Dean wondered if he should be worried that he might actually be about to have a heart attack.
Cas looked like he wanted to say something, and he even opened his mouth for it, but then finally his eyes seemed to adjust to the lack of light in the room and he was able to take in the state of Dean’s face—eyes probably still red and filled with tears, skin wet with them in fact, as the trails on his cheeks were probably very visible. The angel’s expression shifted within seconds, changing from something heavily coated with sleepy confusion to full-on worry in record time.
Looking back up at Sam, Dean felt the words on the tip of his tongue, and it would be so easy to tell his brother that he had a reason to want to live now; two, really—Cas and their child, growing inside of him right in that moment. Their lives depended on him surviving this. But if there was such a thing as terrible timing it was that moment right then, so Dean held the words back before he could say them, settling instead for, “I have to do this, Sam, and I have to walk out of this fight. I have to. I just do.”
Dean hadn’t meant to yell like that, to proclaim that fact so loudly, but when he realized it, it was already done, and all he could do was grow quiet and glance back into Sam’s house, hoping that Jess hadn’t heard his little outburst.
Afriel's Grace did nothing for a moment. It simply... stayed there, inside of him, as though confused about its purpose inside his vessel, but once the spent Grace that still resided within Castiel reached out to the new source of energy, guiding it toward his soul, the new Grace followed willingly. The new power filled him, spreading into every single crevice of his being, blanketing him completely, light washing over everything around him as Afriel's Grace started to change, shifting into a copy of his own original Grace so it could merge with his soul.
He was exhausted, and he knew it must be showing. It would be pointless to try to argue with them about this.
He crossed the hallway and walked into the bathroom, where he threw some water on his face to try and hide the fact that he'd been crying, before making his way to the living room. And once he got there, he wasn't at all surprised to find Sam and Charlie sitting on the couch, working on what he assumed to be the codex, with countless books spread all over the coffee table, as well as endless piles of papers with either symbols drawn all over them or pictures of the Book of the Damned covering every single available surface there was around them. The codex was also there, but it was closed, resting on the table near one of its farthest corners, pretty much out of reach for both Sam and Charlie, so Dean assumed they weren't using it right now, instead apparently basing their work solely on all the notes they had already written down about it up until now.
He had no idea what time it was—how long had he been asleep for? He hadn’t even looked at a clock—but the streets were very much deserted, without a single living soul to be seen anywhere nearby, so he had a feeling it was way past midnight.
Just like last night, the first thing that snapped was his shoulder, cracking and spinning around its joint, finding a new position to settle in like it had a mind of its own. And once again, Dean wasn’t able to keep quiet while it happened, letting out a choked yell at the pain—or, well, what had been supposed to be a yell, but that came out like something far too close to an anguished howl.
At least no one had walked in on them yet, so Dean was really counting that as a win. But then again, they hadn’t gotten really adventurous, keeping their activities confined to Dean’s bedroom and the shower room, locking the door every time.
“Tell me… that I can stop, please.” The words were out before Dean could stop them, before he could even think about them, because they had been dangling on the tip of his tongue since the very beginning of his whole thing but only now did he allow them to jump out.
at Cas, and Dean could almost see the cogwheels turning inside her head. It was a long shot, of course, and Cas’ reasoning had way too many flaws, but Hannah wasn’t immediately calling him out on it, so maybe Cas’ confidence had sold his poor attempt at an explanation well enough that Hannah might actually fall for it.
“Don’t worry that big, hairy head of yours, Moose. You’ll know the rest of the story soon enough, trust me. All you need to know for now is that the Mark doesn’t like the soul bond, and it’s… fighting it, currently.
Meg scoffed, “Like I said, you worry too much.” She turned around and stretched her hand toward the man-creature, and for some reason, she just kept it there—hovering in the air between them, palm open and waiting. “Now stop whining about everything and give it to me. We gotta do this now if we really want to leave soon.”
She vanished into the kitchen, and Dean waited by the counter, leaning against it and staring out the window at the people walking outside. Five more people had arrived at the diner by the time the girl emerged from the inside, another waitress that came out of the back having already started taking their orders. The smell of the food being prepared for lunch was becoming strong in the air coming from the kitchen, and Dean instantly felt his stomach making a turn, a wave of nausea hitting him without warning. He swallowed, closing his eyes and breathing in and out slowly. He really didn’t want to throw up here, so he had to get his shit together.
He would have scrunched his nose up in disgust at that last thought, but honestly, he was in way too much pain to care about that right now.
But Cas wasn’t freaking out. He was still there, slowly swaying along with Dean, still holding him tightly and nuzzling at the hunter’s neck as if there was nothing wrong and that had to mean something, right?
That weird thrill from earlier was back, though it was even stronger now, and while Dean wasn't sure where the hell it was coming from—though he had a feeling it might have something to do with how the bond was still buzzing happily between them—he still allowed another smile to form on his lips.
Dean had to actually remind himself that punching an archangel wasn’t a good idea, although the last time he had done it had felt pretty good. All he did was roll his eyes and let out an annoyed huff, though, keeping the urge at bay, even if the Mark seemed to agree with it very loudly. “Why are you doing this?” he asked, deciding it was best for all the involved that he ignored the comment, along with the Mark’s chanting, “And I’m not picking up a fight, seriously, you know I’m not,” He shrugged weakly, shaking his head and keeping his voice low and steady, “Why are you helping us like this?”
“Dean, because you took on the Mark, you were able to stop Abaddon. Think of all the lives that would have been lost if she’d actually managed to claim Hell’s throne, all the pain and destruction that she would have caused had she actually become Queen. Not to mention that we wouldn’t have been able to stop Cain without the Mark, and I assume you remember his plan. He would have come for you at some point—for our
He didn’t even need to look at the boxes to know the results, but he still did, only to confirm what he already knew.
“Okay, so say you’re right about this,” Dean conceded, even if he didn’t truly believe that version of the story. He just wanted to get as much information as he could about all the possible scenarios, so he’d know exactly what he was working with here. “And that whoever ended the Grand Coven is really who started making hybrids, then what does all of this mean? Why are they doing this? You ever figure
A hand came to rest on the hunter's shoulder, and he lifted his head to look at Cas again, only to find the angel watching him with a pair of big worried eyes. “You should rest, Dean.”
to someone about this. This was the kind of stuff that Dean had never even told Sammy about, and Sam was the person Dean trusted the most in the entire freaking world. Throughout the past few years, Dean had done everything in his power to hide who he truly was from the rest of the world, and as much as it pained him, that included his little brother.
bark and no bite, aren’t you?” the same voice from before asked, and this time, it was followed by what sounded like a pained grunt. “Where’s all that bravado gone, huh, tough guy? You gonna fight back or are you just gonna lie there and take it like the fucking coward you really are?”
Alex nodded, finally placing some food in her mouth, which hopefully meant she’d be quiet for at least a handful of seconds while she chewed.
“What the hell happened?” Dean’s voice was raspy, weak and so clearly tired, even to his own ears. His throat hurt as he spoke, feeling unusually dry and sensitive, like he hadn’t spoken in freaking days, but he still forced the words out, even as that thought set a weight in his chest. He had no idea how long he had been out for and the doubt of it truly terrified him.
"The forming of a human soul happens alongside with their development. It blooms into existence just a few days after conception, and it only grows after that. It usually finishes being formed close to the time of birth."
Cas didn’t even need to respond for Dean to know the answer, but he still waited for the heavy nod that followed a moment later for confirmation.
Moving his hand up towards the tip of the angel’s cock, Dean let his thumb run over the tip, feeling the warm precome spreading around the head and clinging to his skin. He smiled at the feeling, repeating the motion twice more just to get a few more broken whimpers out of Cas, loving the whole body shudder the third time earned him. Cas’ cock was hardening even more and Dean could feel even more precome leaking out.
Dean swallowed drily, trying to organize his thoughts enough to talk. He was pretty much terrified of this conversation, of hearing Cas tell him he didn’t want anything more despite everything he had said to Dean back in Omaha and again back in the cabin, and then pull away because Dean had questioned him about it, of losing Cas yet again. But he knew he had to do this; he had to know where they stood, because the doubts were threatening to drive him insane with every passing day.
Slowly, as though he was afraid that if he moved too fast, his resolve might crumble, he gripped the hem of his hoodie in his trembling hands, took another moment to try and steady himself, and lifted it.
Sam swallowed, feeling a stab at his own heart at those words; at the way Dean didn’t seem able to even finish that sentence, instead letting his voice trail off and die at his throat because he just couldn’t possibly voice the rest. The panic in Dean’s voice was very obvious, so much that Sam could feel his own self start to panic just at the sound of it, because this was so very bad. Losing Cas would cripple Dean, Sam knew that, and they were connected anyway. If they lost Cas, Dean would die too.
Dean huffed in agreement, then nodded. “Yeah. I’m not really surprised that really got to him. I just… wish there was something I could do.”
All the lights inside the house were off, and the first floor seemed completely empty, not a single soul to be found anywhere, so when Dean came across a staircase that seemed to lead down to the basement, he decided they should definitely check out whatever was down there. That was probably where the hybrids were keeping their victims, and apparently, some of them were ‘still turning’, as Lily had pointed out earlier.
Dean just shook his head at that, not sure how to respond. He still didn’t know what to think of that, honestly. What was Cas playing at here? He had pretty much vanished in the thin air, cutting Dean off completely, but suddenly he was sending Hannah to save Dean because
Another pause followed, and for some reason this time the silence felt far too loud in Dean’s ears, like the foretelling of something terrible, of a heavy thunderstorm brewing in the distance. He shifted on his feet, uncomfortable, hating that he was here in this room and not out there, because he had no idea what they were dealing with, of exactly how many angels had come after them, but he knew going out there would be the stupidest idea he’d ever had in his life, so of course he forced himself to stay put and just listen.
wasn’t. He had a pretty bad feeling in his gut that it just wouldn’t be that easy, and that their double-crossing Rowena like this would definitely come to bite them in the ass sometime down the road, but now he realized that there was no point in arguing about this any longer. Sam really was right—they had no other option here, not when they were already running out of time. Rowena truly was their last resort, the last card they still had left to play.
No, his ears were ringing, his whirring thoughts suddenly far too loud for him to be able to pay attention to anything else.
“I got away somehow, but… hit my head. Everything’s kind of blurry.” Why did his head suddenly feel so heavy? And why was everything spinning like this? He hadn't been feeling like this before, so why
His voice failed then, breaking a little around those last few words, but Dean swallowed a couple times and forced himself to keep going, even if he could feel his head spinning and his hands shaking at having to relive those memories. His heart felt tight and heavy, painfully so, much like it had that day—only this time, he couldn’t blame Billie for it.
And then Cas kissed him, as if he could swallow those words and somehow make them become true, letting his hands run all over the expanse of Dean’s body, like attempting to mold their bodies together permanently, his pace even hungrier, his grip almost pleading as he pulled Dean down and closer, the hunter fitting perfectly between Cas’ legs and pressing his body down against the angel’s.
If this continued, he’d call someone; he made a mental note to himself about it as he got into bed. But right now, he should probably get some sleep.
"Hey," Sam said, completely oblivious to the invisible hellhound watching his every movement with undivided attention, "Thought you might be hungry."
Fuck, how long had it even been since he’d been taken? He had no way to know how long he’d been unconscious for, but he had to guess it must have been at least a couple hours, right?
Everyone settled down to eat their lunch after that, though Cas only claimed the space beside Dean on the bed—being very careful not to sit on any part of the hunter's left wing, of course—after fetching Dean's prenatal vitamins from his duffel.
“Well, hello,” she said, and there it was again—the fake, forced smile she always wore like a freaking mask. It didn’t even look like she was bothering to put any effort into it whatsoever. It actually looked like she was having a stroke. “What can I do for you, sweetie?”
all those things in the first place. It was actually freaking him out a little, because how could he be peeking into the angel’s mind like that? Maybe Cas was projecting or something, and he had been close enough to pick up the signal? Did that even make sense? And why would he pick up the signal, anyway? Could a human even do that? And if that was the case, why had Dean been able to see all those other images in his head all the way back in the Bunker, as well as in his motel room in Colorado? How had
Dean pushed the map across the table and toward Cas, twisting it so that Cas wasn’t looking at it upside down. “I’ve been working on
So if he really didn’t want to involve his father in this, then his only other options were to stop at Bobby’s, or Jody’s, or the Roadhouse to try and figure this out, to find someone else to kill him, and
Gabriel shrugged. “Well, then I’m glad I don’t have to go up against you, because, ya know,” He gestured at Dean with his hands, “Unfortunately, I don’t look like a Greek god.”
The hunter nodded, dropping the hose onto the ground and walking over to where the blue-eyed hybrid was, stepping onto the grass and away from the pile of mud and ashes.
“Okay, that’s it,” Dean stopped making the small strips of pie dough that would go on top of the pie, raising his eyebrows at his brother, “You either leave, or I’m not making your damn carrot cake tomorrow.”
where Cassie's Grace is, even if I don’t know for sure if Gavreel actually left it at that house, I do know what town Metatron's little pawn went to with it, which just so happens to be where he hid it."
to let me in, but I understand why you did it. You needed time to think, to… work through an awful lot of guilt, and I knew there wasn’t anything I could do to make it better, so I tried to give you the space you needed.”
He still remained silent for a while after he placed his cap back on top of his head, fixing Sam with a pretty intense stare—measuring him, it seemed like, considering him carefully, like he was looking for something on Sam’s face. What exactly he was searching for, however, Sam had no idea.
His relief didn’t last long, however, because just as he was about to tell Cas that the angel could let go of him now, since he was pretty sure that he could sit on his own, the hunter shifted his weight on the bed—just a tiny,
"Before the vamp drains someone dry or the werewolf decides it wants a human heart for dinner, you mean?" Dean nodded, clenching his jaw a couple of times. "Yeah, I'm aware."
“He’s in pain,” the angel repeated, keeping his voice just as low as the human’s, just a careful whisper, “And I fear he’ll struggle quite a bit to adapt to all these changes. He isn't exactly… thrilled with this new development.”
Before Castiel could move, Hannah let out a weird sound behind him—it sounded like a huff, a rushed breath that was forcefully pushed out of her lungs way too quickly, as though she'd suddenly received a blow to her stomach. And then the loud, familiar crack of a bone breaking filled the air close to Castiel's head before, much to his surprise, Hannah's blade fell to the ground by his side.
“If I recall correctly, and I can assure you that I do, what I did say was that I would look for your brother,” Crowley spoke calmly, not even flinching as Sam raised his voice. If anything, he actually looked bored. “And I did find him. I just didn’t bring him here.”
But Cas made no comment on it. The angel simply shook his head, the movement slow and heavy, and his voice carried an obvious hint of sadness when he answered, "Not with them like this, no."
tiny little crisis was averted, Dean turned his wide, shocked eyes to Jo. He opened his mouth to speak, but all that he managed to let out was a weak, choked, “What?”
She waved her hand again, and this time, it produced a cut on his cheek. He hissed at the sting, feeling blood slipping out from the cut and rolling down his skin.
Dean tried not to shudder at the thought of it. True, it was good to know he wouldn't have to be cut open or anything, but fuck if the alternative scenario wasn't also mildly terrifying. But instead of pointing that out, he decided to ask, "And after?" For some reason, it bothered him a little to imagine the changes sticking around after the baby was born.
He’d never, ever get his life back. Meg had turned him into a monster, the very thing he’d spent his entire life hunting, that he’d spent actual
But he would also be lying if he said that he had expected to feel like this now. He had his Grace again—his
Just like Dean had been expecting—and pretty much dreading, really—that same awfully tense silence filled the car as soon as they were moving again, souring his mood even more, but he did exactly as Sam had advised, exactly as he’d already been doing before—he just kept quiet, giving Cas all the space—all the
look that took over the angel’s face then, and he actually let out a tiny, surprised gasp when the seraph actually
“Cas, please, don’t stop,” Dean whined when Cas pulled away to rest their foreheads together, swallowing each other’s labored breaths through the two inches that separated their parted lips. Dean gasped as Cas let the pad of his thumb slide over Dean’s slit, smearing pre-come all over the tip of his cock. Dean’s hips shuddered at the sensation, his hands dropping and clenching around the sheets as he tried to get a grip on his sanity. It wasn’t working well for him at all. “Just like that, Cas… just like that, oh god…”
But again, Dean had no time to dwell on any of that right now, so he pushed all those thoughts away, instead forcing himself to concentrate on what he had to do now.
Sam jumped on his seat, the book that had been sitting on his lap quickly falling to the floor by his feet with a thud. He reached to the side, grabbing the Angel Blade he had kept by the chair as a precaution and holding it up with a firm hand.
Dean pressed his lips together, swallowing again. He forced the corner of his lips to quirk up in what turned out to be a weak, unconvincing smile. “I’m too old for that shit, and you know that.” He’d tried for a joking tone, but it fell flat, his words sounding empty and dull.
story taking place during 14x03, has 46.7k words, and I'm super proud of it. So if you're interested, feel free to check it out! ;D
“Right,” he breathed out. That made sense, and it actually made him feel a lot better about this. He felt better about being in control. He felt... safer. He liked that.
And as soon as he was outside, Dean stepped down more eagerly onto the gas, practically flooring it as soon as he had an extension of dark, flat asphalt stretching out in front of him, filling the air with Baby’s loud, powerful roars as he put the Men of Letter’s Bunker in his rearview mirror.
Dean closed his eyes, taking in a deep breath and letting it out, forcing the Mark back as well as he could. He had to be more careful with this. It had been a while since the Mark had become loud like that, but it had also been a lot easier than it should for him to lose control just now.
Dean held himself back from huffing in annoyance, and instead simply shook his head. “A way?” he questioned, “A way to do what?”
After everything had been sorted out at the bakery, Dean and Jess met up with Sam to eat lunch at a little Italian place a few blocks away from the Sandover office building, and it was a really big surprise to Dean that Sam didn’t make even a single comment about how tired he looked at all throughout the entire meal, though the older Winchester was fairly certain that he could thank Jess for that, since he doubted she hadn’t filled Sam in on what they had talked about this morning at the bakery when Dean hadn’t been nearby. Well, either that or Sam was just way too tired for that conversation as well, and honestly, it certainly looked like that could very easily be the case. The bags under his little brother’s eyes were very hard to ignore, but of course Dean didn’t comment on them, because that might prompt Sam to inquire about Dean’s own obviously tired state and that just wasn’t something the older Winchester wanted to deal with right now, so he didn’t dare take that risk.
His confidence about leaving Cas alone melted away a lot faster than he'd imagined it would, though. He showered quickly, because the bond still felt worryingly numb, so Dean was overly aware of the fact that he might not feel it if Cas needed him. The Mark was also back to burning angrily on his arm, so that also couldn't possibly mean anything good. Every second he spent under the warm stream of water, completely oblivious to Cas’ current state, was actually maddening, so he found himself walking back into the bedroom not even fifteen minutes after he'd left it. He didn’t even shave in the end, even though he knew probably should have, but his beard wasn’t too long, just a little longer than what he usually allowed, and getting that taken care of right now would just take too long. He could do it tomorrow, he decided. It wasn't something strictly necessary; it could wait.

"Can we bring them here completely?" he asked, "To Earth's plane, I mean. For anyone to see them, and not just their shadows?"
should’ve made the connection right then and there, but somehow that went right over my head. They’re created when someone stays... isolated for a long period of time, normally out in the woods, and once they go on without food for long enough, they grow so desperate that... well, that they resort to cannibalism. That’s what triggers the change.”
Cas blinked, looking almost startled. Apparently his mind had been far away, as his thoughts seemed to have drifted from that kitchen at some point.
“We’d like to have a look around, if that’s possible,” Cas used his serious tone, the one where his voice got even lower than normal, which was often very compelling.
“You okay?” Charlie asked only a handful of seconds after Sam had let his body drop onto the seat right beside her, a worried frown quickly forming in her brows. However, there was a clear hint of apprehension in her eyes, an obvious spark of hesitation, like she already knew that she would probably not like what she would be hearing next.
had been a particularly horrible mistake that Dean would most likely regret for the rest of his freaking life. They were okay today, true, but things still got so damn awkward and weird whenever they were alone, Dean actually avoided going over to The Roadhouse sometimes, just because he didn’t feel like dealing with it.
. It was like the guy wasn’t even real; like he hadn't been here at all. It was like he had simply vanished in the thin air, like a fucking—
When Dean got home that evening, the sun was already dipping low in the horizon, painting the sky in countless hues of red and orange. Needless to say, he wasn't feeling any better by then, and once he was inside his apartment, he found himself pausing by the front door, simply standing there for almost a full minute, swallowing drily as he let his gaze scan the room around him, half-expecting to find the same trench-coat-wearing man from last night standing there in the corner with his wide, owl-like blue eyes, just staring right back at him, as if he'd spent the last few hours waiting for Dean to get home or something.
love." There was a small pause, but as much as Dean wanted to, he just couldn't bring himself to open his eyes and look at the angel. He
Dean shook his head, digging his fingers even deeper into the dirt, feeling some of it sliding under his fingernails.
worse during the car ride, so much he had been sure he wouldn’t make it to the bedroom before it got more violent, but the thought of getting his Baby covered in puke had been enough to keep his nausea at bay until he reached the motel.
“It wasn’t cheap, I’ll tell you that,” Sam replied. “But just imagining the look on Jess’ face when she sees it, just imagining her saying
The sound Cas made wasn’t normal. It was a broken, breathy sound that resembled a moan, but that wasn’t quite it. Enochian words began to jump right out of his mouth as Cas gasped, his back arching off the bed, and Dean was pretty sure he heard his name there somewhere, but he wasn’t sure. Dean reached out for Cas’ hand while he adjusted to the presence in his mouth, loving the weight of Cas’ dick on his tongue. He moved Cas’ hand over to his head, and Cas instantly grabbed his hair, tugging at it with every move of Dean tongue, every time the hunter slid his mouth up and down Cas’ length.
Dean scooted closer to Cas then, trying to push all of his own internal turmoil aside for the time being because Cas needed him not to freak out right now. So he swallowed the lump in his throat and lifted his hand to run it lightly over Cas’ hair. “Cas… You can’t blame yourself for this, man. You didn’t know.”
Sam looked relieved to hear that, as apparently he'd been expecting Dean to put up a little bit more of a fight about that one, but he was quick to cover it up and nod once at his brother in response. And once that matter was settled, Sam and Charlie started gathering the stuff they'd brought in with Dean's food, except for the glass that still had some water in it, instead leaving it on the nightstand. Dean felt bad as he watched them move around him, because they really shouldn't be doing everything for him. He wanted to help and he could clean up after himself, but he had a feeling arguing with them about this now would be pointless. He was too tired for it right now, anyway, so he decided to just deal with it later.
He spun around on his heels, ignoring the way he was still feeling a bit out of sorts, or the way his dizziness still didn’t seem willing to go away, because he really didn’t have time to deal with any of that right now. Cas, Charlie and the others needed him, and that was all that mattered. He needed to get moving, and he needed to do it
When Dean woke up the next morning, his email inbox was still pitifully empty—well, almost, anyway. He’d had a brief freak-out when his laptop beeped, signaling that he’d received a new email, but it was just that standard, automated message welcoming him to his new freaking account.
Castiel was careful as he drove the Impala to Lebanon. He knew how much Dean cared about his car, and the angel knew he had to be mindful of how he drove it—
Eventually the sound of Cas’ breathing became clearer and his coughing subsided completely, and at that point, Dean began running his fingers through the angel’s hair as he listened to the seraph’s still a little too heavy breathing, hoping it would help soothe him even more. Cas leaned into the touch, turning his head to tuck it under the human’s chin, and Dean felt the angel breathing in a little deeper quite a few times, as well as the eventual light brush of lips against the skin of his neck, and he let the feeling calm him a little, ground him.
At last, he reached Mary’s grave, pausing once he was standing right in front of it. Seeing as this particular stretch of ground hadn’t been dug into in over thirty years, the grass was fully grown—trimmed, too, tended to by the groundskeepers, but there was no discernible difference between the grass in front of her headstone and the patches around it, the earth completely untouched for over three decades now.
His mind was numb. He wasn't even thinking anymore, really; he wasn't even trying to figure out what he should do or say right then, because he just
Feeling the need to touch Cas’ skin as well, Dean let his own hands roam, sliding them over Cas’ deliciously bare torso, reveling in the feeling of all that warm, smooth skin, of all those firm, strong muscles under his palms. Dean took the time to enjoy it, to get lost in all those sensations, to let himself get his fill of Cas’ lips, of the taste of the angel’s mouth, the warmth of his skin, until the hunter remembered that this wasn’t just about himself.
Cas narrowed his eyes at him, tilting his head. He still looked offended, but there was a small spark of amusement in his eyes by then, and it really looked like he was holding himself back from smiling.
, though. Maybe Cas had gone off to work a hybrid case? But why leave in such a hurry, then? That just didn't make much sense. And anyway, Dean had been keeping an eye out for possible jobs, and he hadn’t come across anything that could possibly be a hybrid case since the one he and Cas had worked together in Tulsa, so that probably wasn’t it.
He couldn't help but smile fondly when he glanced over at the bed, finding that at some point Cas had curled up to a few pillows and buried himself even deeper under the duvet. Warmth flooded Dean's chest at the sight, and he couldn't resist the urge to walk over to the bed and place a light, gentle kiss to the angel's forehead, careful not to wake him.
“No,” Benny replied. “A nurse just came in to check on her a couple minutes ago. He said nothing’s changed—her vitals are steady, but no big signs of improvement from yesterday. She’s healing, but it’s going… slow.”
Dean huffed. “Don’t really have a choice.” He popped a handful of M&M’s into his mouth, chewing them for a bit before he asked, “Can’t sleep?”
Dean still remembered Cas’ words from almost a full decade ago very clearly, about how an archangel would normally leave its vessel an empty, broken shell when they left it. Sure, a True Vessel could contain an archangel without withering away, without rotting from the inside out, but that didn't mean that there were no consequences to the vessel once the archangel was gone. Dean remembered the state Raphael’s vessel had been in, practically vegetating in that hospital room, just staring blankly at the wall like the man wasn’t even
Of course, he knew those words were not true at all, but he figured there was no harm in lying to her about that, since he was here to
He walked into the room quickly at the sight, crossing the distance between the door and the bed in just a few strides.
I apologize for the unusual amount of typos in the last chapter, but I was extremely sleep deprived when I posted it and I still haven't had the time to come back and edit them. Now that I'm finally posting this I'll go back and finally fix the mistakes, but I wanted to get this chapter out first. I might even edit all the other chapters, too, because I know they probably have typos as well.
Doing his best to mask the pain, he raised a hand, pointing in the direction of the kitchen. “It’s right through that door.”
in here too. If you haven't seen it yet... well, don't. There's no need to put yourself through that kind of pain, really. Trust me. Pretend this is canon. This is what really happened, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. That's what
“How?” Castiel asked, because he’d already thought about that particular solution before, but he’d discarded it soon enough due to the difficulties in actually pursuing it. “The areas where hospitals keep their blood bags are closed off and monitored by cameras, not to mention that not everyone has access to it. How do you steal them?”
He concentrated on the bond instead, which still felt numb and weird, and he assumed the whole place was really heavily warded with some pretty powerful cloaking spell, because the buzzing was still way too weak now that he and Cas had switched places. He wondered how the hell the Stynes had figured out a way to do that, but then again, that family had at some point had the Book of the Damned in their possession, so maybe Dean shouldn’t be surprised that they would find a way to block the soul bond.
Lazily, Dean let his hands trail patterns on the skin of Cas’ back as they both allowed their bodies to calm down and their heartbeats to slow down. Cas began to nuzzle against the side of Dean’s neck at some point, laying light kisses here and there, which began to grow less frequent as the minutes passed.
“Listen, Father,” Dean started, sitting up straighter in his chair, even going so far as to square his shoulders. He leaned forward a bit, too, to make sure that he had the man’s full attention, holding the priest’s gaze unwaveringly. And yeah, okay, maybe his voice also came out a bit sharper than before, harder, just a tiny bit less friendly, but honestly? Dean really couldn’t find it in himself to care about that. Maybe intimidating the guy a little bit might actually help getting this thing done a little faster.
When Cas finally broke that silence, though, he did it to say something Dean was definitely not expecting to hear from him right now.
Cas buried his face in the spot where the hunter’s neck met his shoulder, causing the angel’s heavy, labored breathing to wash over Dean’s skin repeatedly, in even, steady intervals, sending a series of goosebumps running over the hunter’s entire body and making him shiver. Dean tightened his hands where they’d been clawing at the angel’s muscular back, burying his blunt fingernails into the seraph’s flesh. He liked the thought of them leaving marks.
“Cas?” Dean raps his knuckles on Cas’ door, holding onto the hot mug of peppermint tea he definitely didn’t make as an excuse to come check up on the angel. He and Sam stayed up into the early hours of the morning reading dusty old books, and Cas hasn’t made an appearance since Dean had gotten him settled in his room the night before. And, Dean reasons, if Cas is sleeping, he’ll probably need to eat and drink as well, and Dean dimly remembers Cas liking peppermint tea, the least molecule-flavored of all the teas, so it’s just a thoughtful, friendly gesture to bring him a cup.
Jack smiles again, bouncing a bit on the balls of his feet. “She’s with me. We’re in … harmony,” he assures them.
Wake up. Zombie-shuffle to kitchen. Flip on lights. Flip on coffee. Find small dragon creature lying curled up in coffee mug. Return small dragon creature to the wild. Repeat.
This chapter is a bit short and I suspect that we are all going to need a pick-me-up one way or another tonight, so I'll probably be posting chapter 4 this evening. After I'm done crying my eyeballs out.
“Tryin’ to fatten me up, Cas?” Dean murmurs, teasing, and Castiel laughs softly, relaxing into Dean’s arms. This close, Dean gets a good noseful of flour, but he notices that Cas also smells of powdered cocoa, rich and dark and inviting. He smells like a bakery and it
giving himself hell over wanting to give Cas the benefit of the doubt even after he betrayed them. How badly he had hurt Dean, and still Dean’s insides twisted sickeningly at the thought of Castiel’s face, bathed in firelight, eyes wide and piercing, begging for understanding. All the lying and miscommunication, the total inability to simply be upfront – on both sides – piled up so goddamn high over the years it threatened to topple and crush him, and all the while he
Struggling to will his hands to stillness, Dean grasps the vial in one hand and carefully presses the tip of the angel blade against the base of Castiel’s throat with the other. He takes in a long, slow breath and draws a short, shallow line across Castiel’s skin. The flesh parts and he bleeds blue, Grace swirling out into the space between them, aimless, eager to dissipate. Dean uncorks his vial and holds it out, doing what he can to coax Castiel’s Grace into it. It feels like it takes forever, and all the while Dean aches and aches and Castiel remains still and silent.
“You dork,” Dean says fondly, tipping Castiel’s face up and kissing him, slow and sweet, leaning back against the counter. He pulls back and Castiel whines, annoyed, but Dean drops a quick kiss on his nose and smiles. “C’mon, let’s get you back to bed,” he says. “You try to get some more sleep, and I’ll be back to pick you up around four-thirty, okay?” Castiel grumbles but complies, and together they get him settled under a mound of blankets before Dean goes back to the kitchen to finish his coffee.
Dean comes slowly to the tops of his knees, a barely noticeable pause making Castiel’s stomach twist pleasantly, charmed by how carefully Dean approaches him. He gives Castiel an unreadable look before he digs a hand into Castiel’s sweaty hair, plants the other on his thigh and kisses into him as though he’s done it a thousand times before and he knows exactly how much Cas will resist him, which is to say: not at all. Dean licks along Castiel’s lower lip, gets caught on the raw patch there, sucks it into his mouth and draws it between his teeth. He drags his hand from Castiel’s leg to his hip to his chest, lingering over Castiel’s runaway heartbeat, gliding it gingerly along his throat and into his hair. He bites down, careful, and pulls back, eyes open and on Castiel, sultry.
Maybe it can be blamed on the twelve-year itch under his skin that’s been steadily rising, bold and unencumbered, to the surface. Maybe he can blame it on his brother, who gives Dean these
“Don’t worry about Meg,” Anna said when Castiel was done, and he scoffed. “I’m serious, Cas, don’t worry about her for now. She’ll come around.”
Dean doesn’t know what to say, still astonished at Castiel’s willingness to rebel for him after all this time.“Cas —”
With his thoughts thus occupied, Castiel noticed the change in pressure around him: a silencing, abrupt, as though every tormented creature inside the Empty had suddenly become mute, or vanished from existence entirely. All that remained when Castiel opened his eyes was the disturbing roil of the oil-slick ground beneath his feet and the vanishing whispers of what sounded like his name.
Dean sits back against the wall, effectively shrugging Sam off. He tips his head back until he’s looking up blankly at the ceiling. He figures he can tell them what happened as long as he doesn’t have to look.

, and he’d buried them deep. There wasn’t time to sit and examine them, or at least that was what he told himself as they ran around putting out fire after fire to stop the apocalypse, though for all the good it did them they may as well have been plugging the cracks in a dam with their fingers. And besides, he was pretty sure angels just… didn’t feel things the same way people did. He could pine away for Castiel all he wanted, but the likelihood of Castiel returning his feelings, Dean knew, was basically non-existent.
A tiny kernel of disbelief whispers to Castiel, but he refuses to listen to it. He never expected to see Dean again after he summoned the Empty; coming back, seeing their friendship perhaps dinged but not damaged, watching Dean incrementally start to see himself as Castiel has always seen him – all of these things were so far above and beyond his expectations Castiel could only be profoundly grateful for every step forward.
ago, so there was just no way that they hadn’t figured out something fishy was going on here ever since they woke up in these cells, but Dean knew denial could be a pretty powerful thing, not to mention that they hadn’t gotten actual confirmation of what exactly had happened to them until now.
“Please, don’t be such a prude, Dean,” Crowley shook his head at him, his tone mocking and his eyes pretty much sparkling in delight, “Everyone knew where
Dean nodded, swallowing drily, then taking another sip from his beer. “That kind of shit happens when you walk out on the life. But if you’re still hunting, no one gets hurt—unless, of course, maybe you. But when you’re playing house and have people you actually care about—normal, innocent people who can’t really defend themselves against monsters they don’t even
A weird look passed over Sam’s eyes then—a pensive, contemplative look that had Dean shifting his weight on his feet, suddenly feeling uncomfortable. He wasn’t sure what exactly was going through Sam’s head in the moment, but he definitely didn’t like being on the receiving end of that look. It made him feel like he was stuck under a freaking microscope or something.
Now he realized maybe he should have seen it coming, too, after thinking it through, replaying some of the events of the past few years in his head; realized it had been right in front of his face for a while now. And the signs had not only come from Dean, either, Cas had given out plenty of them, even if neither of them knew about it, which he assumed they didn’t, or at least hadn't until now.
people, so Dean thought it was safe to say that he didn’t have much time to think about this. He had to act fast, but how the hell was he supposed to find this thing’s lair? Just wandering around in these woods looking for it would take freaking forever, and he definitely didn’t have that kind of time to spare.
Dean opened his mouth to respond, but no sound came out, so he just closed it again a couple of seconds later. Of all the things he had expected to hear,
There are no windows, just one door, and a whole bunch of junk by the walls. I’m pretty sure this is a basement.”
Cain tilted his head to the side, his eyes growing even sharper than before, heavier, more focused. “You have no idea what you’re truly asking for, Dean. And that makes me wonder…” A small, sick smile spread over the demon's lips, and it made a feeling of uneasiness settle in Dean's stomach yet again, “Perhaps it would be best if you succeeded.”
But this whole nightmare was still far too fresh in Castiel’s mind, and it still hurt too much to just think about it. He definitely wasn’t ready for that conversation—not yet.
Unless she’d simply known that that was the first place they’d look, so she’d taken a guess that Crowley might be headed there—if he hadn’t simply bailed on them, that was. And if that really was the case here, then the fact that she’d sent a couple of her lackeys to check the basement really didn’t mean much.
Dean’s immediate response to that was to roll his eyes with an annoyed huff, then turn his head so that he was once again staring out at the hospital parking lot. “No, we don’t.”
In the end, he decided on the former, though only because he actually needed to warn Cas about something.
Dean frowned at the man, hesitating for only a beat before answering, “Dean.” He figured there was no harm in giving this guy his real first name, considering he didn’t exactly have anything to lose anymore. His current situation couldn’t
“Not my last name, though. I’ve always been grateful that my mother never actually took my father’s last name when they got married, and that she chose to give us hers—probably because she’d always known Chuck wasn’t exactly… father material, I suppose. But there was one thing I wasn’t particularly fond of—her…
He swallowed drily at that thought, feeling a lump forming in his throat. His stomach sloshed unpleasantly, his chest growing tighter—uncomfortably so.
Dean opened his mouth to argue that Cas had been able to jump bodies his entire life so it was different, but he closed it a moment later, realizing that maybe this wasn’t the point Dean should be focusing on. He didn’t want Cas to leave Jimmy’s body anyway, and really, there was something else Dean realized right then that might deserve their attention more than that.
Charlie bit her lip, finally tossing her fry into her mouth. She shifted on her chair, pulling her bag to her lap as she began to chew. Castiel watched silently as she looked through the contents of it, pulling out a sheet of paper and sliding it over the table for Castiel to see.
