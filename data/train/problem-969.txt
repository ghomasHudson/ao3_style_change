“Was trying to be optimistic, Alexis.”
Chapter Thirty-nine
“OH FOR FUCK’S SAKE, WILL YOU CHANGE THAT?” Violet howled.
“Yeah, I lost my temper again,” John admitted, rubbing his left hand now. “I told her that I was the only thing standing between her and Mycroft and she fucking better believe me.”
“Oh,” Sherlock lifted his shaggy black brows. “Like how you told John to lie to me about Irene Adler also going into that Witness Protection Program in America? But I believe she had really got her head chopped off by some very unpleasant religious fanatics in the Middle East?”
,” Dupin turned the radio on. Quickly glancing at John out the corner of his eye, he observed how his hunched-up shoulders bowed forward and how tightly he crossed his arms across his chest. As if he was protecting his heart.
(while unnecessary,) is almost
Sherlock thought.
“What’s with Violet?” John risked a whisper but Sherlock shook his head, his quicksilver eyes darting all over the room. John picked up on the meaning at once.
“I… I… don’t know,” Sherlock had sounded astonished, as well as he should. As usual, his deduction skills had failed him regarding The Woman. As he had watched Irene and Dupin, all he saw was a cluster of
Sherlock didn’t fully explain his latest brilliant plan to John and Dupin until Dupin returned to their hotel with the requested stationery and pink ink pens. Once Sherlock enlightened Dupin and John, he threw John’s rucksack at him. As John puffed out a surprised “Oh!” when he caught the bag, Sherlock snatched up his laptop carry-on bag. The detective practically sang out “Come along, John,” as he breezed out the door.
Besides, he really did not need another premeditated murder charge on his record.
Violet could never completely explain away her emotional reactions to people. She didn’t believe in telepathy or any sort of stupid psychic phenomena. Often though, after observing someone, she could almost feel exactly the same emotions her mark was experiencing. Sometimes after a grueling interrogation she’d have to sneak off to one of the locker rooms at J. Edgar Hoover and shower, to literally scrub away the murderous feelings of disgust, humiliation and rage she had absorbed from her suspect.
Violet dashed into the shop and argued a bit with the clerk. The tie wasn’t for sale actually. It was part of the window dressing. Violet batted her eyelashes, cajoled and pleaded. When flirting failed, she offered the sales clerk fifty pounds for the damned thing. She ended up paying seventy for it. Well worth it, she thought as she imagined Mycroft’s mouth dropping open in horror while Sherlock laughed.
The flash of panic on Toller’s face had been delicious. Mary had made sure she kept her face sweet and innocent.
Victor shook his head and then actually checked the time. He hoped he would have time for a quick bite before getting on the train that would take him back to his tiresome wife. He had missed lunch while he had been signing some very important papers. Now he felt more than peckish, he was ravenous.
The frigid, one syllable word not only got his attention but sobered him up.
But a voice broke through the din of sirens and shouts and the awful ringing sensation in her ears. “Miss! Miss! Are you alright?”
“The former,” Violet dipped her head down, smiling shyly. “We haven’t gone public yet because… well, surely you must know firsthand how vicious the paparazzi can be, or at least by proxy, because of some of the clients you design for.”
“The Homeless Network is expensive,” Violet hated asking.
“He’s too good to leave a trace, Peters,” Mary whimpered, leaning against the refrigerator.
“Where?”
Gladstone had gotten his head stuck in the crisps bag.
“If you think I’m going to allow you to touch my brother ever again, you’re
“Need to file a complaint against Whitey.”

“I know, but you
“Stop wearing my clothes and stop using my razor.”
“I’m listed as his emergency contact,” John explained, his face scrunching up into a scowl, as it always did whenever he saw Mycroft.
“It’s about frickin’ time.”
Violet hoped Sherlock would be able to drug Rucastle and the Tollers as  he planned.
“Right, twenty-three.” Continuing to shine his light on the white bricked walls defaced with black, red and yellow graffiti, John jogged until he caught up with Sherlock. In a whisper so Honoré couldn’t overhear, John asked, “Will your mysterious source be joining us?”
will we know everything worked out, exactly?
She wished her husband wasn’t in LA on business.
Monday morning
She also acted like she was carved from a block of ice. That was probably the only reason why the world believed she was willingly dating and living with someone like Sherlock. With his cold logic, ruthless deductions and unyielding work ethic, he really did seem to be more machine than man sometimes.
job,” Lestrade added a bit forcefully. “But he does care about his well-being. He kept telling me to get out of the building because he didn’t want Henry growing up without a dad. Would someone who doesn’t care say something like that?”
“Helps me think.”

“Haven’t been able to work, so when both me and Jimsie’s out of work, it gets tense around here, even with my disability benefits. Jimsie always threatens to throw Susan out. I just… didn’t think he’d actually do it this time.” She mopped her eyes with the soggy tissue. “Sorry, I’m rude. Didn’t offer you a cuppa. I can put the kettle on, if you like.”
“That doesn’t seem…. right.” John sounded ill as he dragged his hand over his face. Then he wiped the sweaty hand on his jeans.
“If you ever tickle me, I’ll end you, I swear to G-” Sherlock swallowed his protest when John started taking him bit by bit into his mouth.
“Don’t make people into heroes, John. Heroes don’t exist, and if they did, I wouldn’t be one of them.”
Abruptly, Mary’s voice echoed in his ears:
She blinked back sudden tears,
at twelve-thi-”
“Walk with me,” Sherlock brusquely interrupted. “Act normal.”
“We are running very late,” the matron-of-honor said pointedly, as if it was all Violet’s fault. She then snapped at the flower girl, “Lily, what did I tell you about Molly’s dress? Come here at once before you get your grubby fingers all over it!”
… into a room that greatly resembled the old cinema in Winterbourne-on-Avon. It had been one of his favorite places to visit. It was always a treat when he got to go to the movies, oh, especially when Ford took him because he would buy him all the fizzy drinks and popcorn he wanted…

The girl nodded frantically, clinging to Wiggins, “Please don’t hurt me.”
She just didn’t fancy carrying all those boxes downstairs to the moving van she had rented for her trip back. Not her trip
“No!” the girl shook her head violently. Her eyes turned into saucers. “No cops. I’m OK. It was… a misunderstanding.”
animals.”
John shrugged, “Maybe. Maybe not. Dunno. But I love you,” he started mopping up Sherlock’s chest. “I don’t want to pretend anymore that I don’t.”
"Dear me, Miss Hunter, dear me..."
“But we don’t have it,” John squawked. “And we didn’t make the bet.”
Have a great week everyone! :^)
Moriarty had thanked Violet for her help then viciously stabbed Steven in the throat, leaving him to bleed out. He had then attacked her on all levels possible. Finally he had left her bleeding on the kitchen floor with a promise to “Pick up where we left off…”

Thank you for reading! Kudos/rec's/comments are appreciated and make me smile :^D
Neither did his paramour, Grace Dunbar**.
Sherlock shrugged, apparently not ruling it out.
“What do we know?” Mycroft purposely kept his voice soft and controlled.
He took care of morning business in the loo then poked his head into the nursery, expecting to find Molly. Instead, he found Mrs. Hooper, sleeping on a lilo she must have brought in there during the night. She slept in front of the baby cot, like a sentinel.
“Goddammit,” Violet Hunter said bitterly to Sherlock in the back seat of the black cab.
“Why on earth didn’t you report it?” Donovan held out her hands, as if she was going to embrace her. “We would have helped you.”
“Everything,” Wiggins beamed now, digging into his jeans pockets. “The booze, the cigs, the drugs, even fast food.” He produced a bronze coin and brandished it in front of Mary. “Six months, two weeks and three days. Even taking some night classes now. Computer sciences. But… Miss Smith said it was urgent Shezza meet me? He needed my help with something?”
Mycroft immediately crushed it.  “My superiors say no. I will ask again, but it looks bleak.”
Mycroft lifted his eyebrows. “One cannot force my brother to do anything,
“Got it,” Violet muttered as the board finally popped open. She blindly felt around until her fingertips felt something cool and metallic. She grasped it and awkwardly worked it out of its hidey-hole. “Gotcha,” she sat up and crossed her legs, studying the black metal box.
station. Once separated from the others, Sherlock started humming
After the speech he had just given Honoré, Sherlock’s response felt quite snippy to John. So, feeling more than a bit put out, John demanded in a cool, clipped voice, “And why not?”
Late Monday morning
Some of the bruises and scrapes came from fighting as well, Jack was no fool. Plus he was a little proud how his son always stood his ground. Johnny never started a fight. It wasn’t in his nature to razz anyone, to start anything.
Or fear.
“She was an astute business woman who knew her customers but unfortunately got in over her head,” Violet found herself giving Sherlock her profile on Irene. “Her narcissism and arrogance did her in. She wildly underestimated both you and Jim.” She carefully avoided using Jim’s last name.  “Irene thought she could play you both as she did other men.” Then she frowned, “Do you think she was working for Jim or for Richard?”
He spread his fingers out wide, studying his hands.
“That is what you remember?”
“You are risking your own life. I won’t have it. I will
“Um, how… how did you know about… what  happened?” John stammered just as a young, blonde man approached them. He had the good looks of a fashion model and the scruffy clothes of a university student who had just pulled an all-nighter. But he still had a smile on his handsome face. He carried John and Sherlock’s coats, as well as two large plastic baggies, containing their mobiles, passports and other personal items.
To hear someone call her
The picture of himself leaving the hospital with Molly and newborn Henry had caught Lestrade’s attention. “They’ve been watching us,” he whispered. “Ever since you came back from the dead, they’ve been watching.”
For him, flirting simply wasn’t fun. How could it be? Not when one could deduce in less than  three seconds if someone was married or a gold-digger or was still in the closet but still secretly wanted to throw a leg over a bloke or had truly disturbing sexual fetishes or would just be a lousy lay.
Whenever John saw those long scars, now faded into a tight, shiny peach-color, he always felt sick with shame.…
There was silence. “Good,” she finally said in a quavering voice. “Good…. And Sherlock?”
“Yes sir,” she held up his tie and jacket, like an altar boy offering robes to a priest.
#sorrynotsorry
Then as she had been bathing Lucy, John had made his stunning announcement.
“Brahms,” John’s voice shook while thinking
“Your job is to protect British citizens, yeah?”
“Be kind to your mother,” Mr. Holmes would rumble, squeezing Sherlock’s thin shoulder after they had rowed over the proper way to build a proper gingerbread house. Sherlock would huff and puff, but he did temper his astringent tongue after that.
Normally I rely on my own memory and re-watches when quoting the show, but this time Ariane DeVere's Sherlock transcripts saved my life (see below...)
A slow smile, a genuine smile spread across Chibs’ face, “Aye, we’re good.” He pulled out his old flip-phone (Chibs stoutly refused to upgrade to a Smartphone.) “Well, it’s already going to be a scorcher. We best shove off soon.”
“Ready when you are,” Sherlock started to pull himself up to his feet, but still had to steady himself against the town car. He kept his hand on the vehicle as he slowly walked around the car. He opened the car door, ordered Gladstone inside, then slipped in.
“And that her abduction could possibly be tied to the deaths of three other young women. I need to see if those girls worked here as well.”
“Pray, continue.”
“Yup,” Mary turned the ignition off.
“Could you really?” Sherlock’s face crinkled in confusion.
“Everything?” Lestrade said incredulously.
“She doesn’t love you, Sherlock,” Victor grabbed at Sherlock’s jacket. “Not like I do.”
“Well done, John. What else?”
than usual, as if he had dyed it even darker.
“Go change out of those damp clothes,” Violet retrieved Gladstone’s leash. “The last thing we need is for you to get sick again.”
“You’re Sherlock’s brother.”
the gesture seemed to say.
VH located.
He reminded himself of the first lesson he had been taught when he became “a minor government official.” He nodded. “I will,” he lied again.
25 November 2015
Then quickly stood up, snatched the book off Molly’s desk and left, leaving the door open.
Violet felt a heaviness lift from her shoulders as she saw Baker Street illuminated by the street lamps. Her hands stopped trembling. But her eyelids itched from sleep deprivation and her stomach hurt from the abuse it had taken these past few weeks, from the rich foods to the arsenic in her tea. A whopper of a headache threatened as well. She also felt terribly thirsty. All she wanted right now was a giant glass of ice water and some ibuprofen. Then her bed.
“Oh my God,” now Mary covered her mouth as she gripped John’s hand now for dear life.
“Let me,” Violet took off first the fleece parka then the cardigan followed by the scarf, handing them to Sherlock. Shivering in her short-sleeved jumper, she squeezed her thin arm between the door frame and the actual door. She grunted and cursed, when she wasn’t biting her lower lip in frustration. Finally she said, “
Violet held her hand out, “Come on, Sherlock. I’ll show you where the vending machines are.”
What if Sherlock
Sherlock had lifted her up off her back, pulling her towards him and John saw the exit wound.
Experimentally she wiggled her toes, pathetically grateful that she could wiggle her toes and it did not hurt to do so.
“See, would this bother me if I really was homophobic?” John quipped and felt gratified to hear Sherlock chuckle. Then he added, “Besides, this isn’t the first time you’ve nodded off on my shoulder, so relax,” John started rubbing his hand up and down Sherlock’s upper arm. John loathed himself for giving his best friend mixed signals but at the same time loved the weight of the thin man against him, the sensation of the inky curls tickling his stubbly chin and cheek. “You’ve dozed off on me loads of times on the cab rides back to 221B after saving The Met’s arse again. Plus, you know, when you were detoxing from whatever the fuck Jack Woodley shot you up with last April.”
Sherlock curled his long fingers around her small hand. “My condolences for the unlawful termination of your pregnancy. I regret deeply that Jim Moriarty went after you to damage me and John,” he told her in a low, gentle voice only John and Violet knew he possessed.
She wished she had time to do a mini “drugs bust.” Her gut told her Sherlock had morphine, possibly even cocaine tucked away in here, but she didn’t have time. Instead she went back into the tiny lounge, took the sandwiches, apples and bottles of fizzy drink out of the rucksack and into the refrigerator. She popped the rucksack into the cupboard under the sink. Then reached under the sink and found the prepaid mobile Sherlock had taped underneath there.
“But when he thought Moriarty was dead, he became very, very interested in merging with them,” Violet informed him. “Magnussen was a force to be reckoned with in London, but on a global scale, he was a small-time crook. Merging with the RHL, well, that would have been his coming out party. He dragged his feet about joining until two things happened. One,” Violet held up a finger, “Jim Moriarty was dead. And two,” she held up her second finger, “That you and Sherlock were either dead or contained somehow.”
about every move and countermove we make. Did it ever cross your mind-”
“In my handbag and I cannot think if it feels like my scalp is being slowly ripped off my head,” she snipped back as Sherlock seized her handbag. As he riffled through her bag, looking for the saline drops, Violet continued to moan, “I swear to God, Anthea told that bint to make the hair extensions too tight on purpose.”
“You have too many clothes on,” Sherlock huffed into John’s ear before giving the tender earlobe a mischievous nip. “Most inconvenient,” he started un-doing the buttons. He then realized, from the smoothness of the buttons and the texture of the material that the shirt John had put on was the one Sherlock had been wearing last night, the aubergine shirt the Internet had irritatingly dubbed: “The Purple Shirt of Sex.”
didn’t realize that Sherlock quite purposely had fallen off the media’s radar. He publically declined high-profile cases when the Met called him. The reality was that most of those cases he solved on the sly and emailed the results to Lestrade. He turned down the majority of the personal requests for his expertise, using John’s recuperation as an excuse. “I am simply lost without my blogger,” was the reason he gave for saying no when pressed.
The Royal Hospital of St Bartholomew
“Still my business to know the business of others,” Sherlock withdrew a paperback book, obviously second-hand, “Sign-language?”
He whipped his head around when he heard footsteps in the kitchen. He took a step forward, then another. His damaged wrist and fingers began to protest a bit from holding the gun, but the pain only made John feel more alert, more alive.
“Oh yes, we have a friend who is a detective-inspector. He called quite late last night. Apparently one of our neighbors reported a strange man entering our home. Dressed like a plumber,” she shook her head. “John told me to stay here. Apparently the place is a wreck,” and Mary even managed to produce tears. “I hope you don’t mind.”
“I’m on the East Coast,” she vaguely informed him.
“These are
John thought he might possibly shed a tear or two and Mary was definitely sniffling next to him. “Oh, look at the lot of us, being silly,” Mary burst out, smiling brightly while dabbing her eyes with her fingers. “It’s your wedding day, Molly. No more tears. Only smiles.” She held the bouquet out to Mrs. Hooper. Mother gave the flowers to daughter and then pulled the gauzy veil down over Molly’s face.
9:26 PM
As Mrs. Holmes fixed her smothering attention on Mary, John stood next to Sherlock. “How are you holding up?”
“Killing her is suicide!” Violet yelled back, but in Russian. “Her boss will come after us. There will be nothing John or Sherlock can do to stop him and neither one of us can leave the British Isles. Even if we could get out of England, our safety is not guaranteed in any other country.” She softened her voice but continued in Russian, “And you don’t want to leave England. You don’t want to leave John. He is your last chance for a normal life, especially if we find your daughter. But that means Anthea must live and the lies stop. We question her, we let her go and you go home to your husband and tell him what has been happening.” Violet switched back into English, but
“No. Just do your job and do it quickly. Don’t keep me waiting,” she warned him. She waved him off with her gun.
Mycroft, as usual, leaned on his infernal umbrella. He stood below one of the few overhead lights that still worked. He wore a heavy coat with a maroon scarf knotted around his skinny neck. “Well, two for one, how unexpected,” he drawled. “Agent Hunter,
Now “Grace” paused to pull off her knitted hat to massage her head.
“I was an Army doctor and I got shot, that’s all there is to Afghanistan,” John knew Sherlock was trying to goad him into some sort of confession. He fought the urge to throw his shaving kit and toiletries’ bag at Sherlock’s face all the same. “As for my childhood, well, it’s too boring for someone with your massive intellect and toff background to be interested in.”
guy.”
221B Baker Street
“Did he… hurt you?”
“’Course I am,” John said gruffly, pausing to kiss Mary’s temple. “Even though she’s undeniably useless, she’s still my sister, isn’t she?”
Violet faced him but she wasn’t looking at him, not at first. She was looking at something else, perhaps within her own Mind Palace, John wasn’t sure. But then the haze cleared from her eyes and she inhaled in that strange way of hers, a long inhalation through her nose followed by an even longer exhalation. John knew it was some sort of calming technique, possibly having to do with yoga breathing.
Sherlock and Violet shared another brief glance.
“Right now, you don’t have the money or the manpower to get rid of the Midnight Crew. They have burrowed themselves deep into this neighborhood like a tick on a dog’s skin,” Violet flatly informed them. “They are also guarding whatever is in that abandoned fire station, where Mitton is being held. Help
“This is
His mind drifted as two of his friends said their vows. He knew Violet had determined the paternity of Molly’s baby and had elected  mercifully to keep her mouth shut, for now. Sherlock believed that criminal profiling was a fuzzy, impractical skill set at best, dependant on emotional inductions rather than scientific deductions. But he also had to admit she could read most people quite accurately. Maybe she couldn’t tell if someone owned three Corgis or had a hot date lined up just by looking at their shoes. But she could tell if someone was lying, stalling, guilty or had murder in their hearts.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Mary…” John stuffed the cheque back into his jeans’ pocket then ran both hands over his face.
A faint smile appeared on John’s exhausted face. “OK,
Violet knew better. There would be no privacy.
He frowned. Her health was starting to concern him. First her shaking hands. Now that bout of vomiting last night at Greg and Molly’s, and she had looked dreadfully pale. Granted, finding an eviscerated cat in a baby’s crib was highly unpleasant. John had also felt queasy, but Violet had once described without batting an eyelash how finding decapitated bodies of drug lords was just a day on the job for her at the FBI. Something was definitely wrong with her now. He needed to nag her again to schedule a proper doctor’s appointment.
. I can’t spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder for him.”
His head aching, he stayed on his side. He now regretted that choice. He hadn’t been able to see where he was being taken. When the car stopped, John had no idea where he was. He felt short of breath as the car door opened and a new police officer told him in very broken English to get out of the car.
“Start a list of funerals we can rule out,” Sherlock sat up, pulling out his mobile. “I’ll start scanning obits online.”
“OK,” Evie nodded. “Yeah, we should. And I’ll find something, if you can help through this month,” Evie made herself look piteous again.
“The money was
,” Mrs. Hudson sighed, growing misty-eyed.
” Violet took a stumbling step back.
After Sherlock had loudly deduced at a different dinner party about how Stella had lied to Ted about how much she really spent at the shops, not to mention that she sent Ted’s shirts to be pressed and laundered instead of washing and ironing herself, she was rather not fond of him.
She sat very still and very quiet, clutching her cheap handbag. Her eyes were unreadable, staring off, looking at something other than the kindly Cuban doctor in the tiny office of the state-run hospital.
“Of course I don’t want to be an only child, don’t be stupid. Why would you even say that, that’s just simply...” Mycroft sucked in a horrified breath. “Did you try to kill William, actually kill him?”
“When we were there last summer, Violet and me, I found a locked metal box in a desk drawer, in the library. I thought maybe there might be a clue as to where Maisie is, but it only had pictures and documents for your family.”
Violet forced her eyes open again. Little by little, she lifted herself up off from the enormous pillows she had been propped up on. Her head throbbed dully. Feeling that dreadful pins-and-needles sensation running through her arm as she did so, Violet reached up and touched the left side of her head, feeling a lump underneath the silky curls.
Sherlock let loose a breath he hadn’t known he had been holding when he finished the last note of the song with a flourish. The hall was nearly empty now. Violet Smith looked up at him and said, “Well done, Mr. Holmes,” as she adjusted her hat.
Watching the paramedics work on John was worse than any pain or torture Sherlock had ever endured. He squeezed his eyes shut just as they started cutting John’s shirt and vest open so they could attach the AED pads to his chest. His treacherous memory recalled perfectly what he had shouted at John in the shadow
Rucastle didn’t know whether  to be grateful or terrified.
At his heart.
“One hundred percent,” he declared.
“I’m not condoning murder, mind you,” John whispered tersely. “But I would not be heartbroken if a lorry ran Mycroft over while he was crossing the street.” He paused. “And then reversed over him and ran him over again.”
They looked at each other, then their mobiles:
“I’ll ask Mary to try and get this stain out for you,” John mumbled, twisting the scarf.
“Violet? What’s the matter, dear?”
“Hello, Agent Hunter,” he purred.
“Dupin.”
Try not to come back to
“You believe Mary is still a threat to Sherlock.”
“The toilet bowl looked like a crime scene. Good thing Mycroft doesn’t have a nose like mine. He’s always suffered from allergies,” Sherlock purred. “Is everything on your end arranged?”
Sherlock took a step forward but then observed Violet stomping then grinding her pointed high heel into the top of his foot.
“Moriarty’s people were in the process of selling the baby.”
gowns. Some others only had scarves or strange looking necklaces draped around their skinny, swan-like necks. The other mannequins were completely naked, white and plastic.
Sherlock ignored him and stalked out of the morgue. John mouthed “Sorry,” to both Lestrade and Molly then bolted to follow Sherlock.
An exhausted looking young man with a massive case of bed-head looked up from a chart he was reading when she stood in front of his desk. “Oh,” he tried swallowing a yawn and failed. “Sorry, you must be Miss Smith, the Alsatian’s owner. The Watsons told me to expect you. My dad’s the vet, I help on the weekends and summers, when I’m home from uni.”
“He got himself hopelessly turned around and he can’t speak French for shit,” Honoré told Sherlock as he navigated through the evening traffic in Dupin’s Volvo. The windscreen wipers whipped back and forth as the mist turned into drizzle. “We thought we had lost him when he got a cab, but you were right. He went exactly where you said he would.”
“Sherlock?” he slurred, his eyes rheumy with pain and malnutrition.
Toller placed a ridiculous pair of pink spectacles into Rucastle’s hand. Violet was sure Elton John wouldn’t have even worn those glasses. And yet Rucastle slipped the reading glasses on then held the resume at a normal distance from his eyes.
Wednesday morning
“Did you two get high on the train coming here?”
Now Violet’s jaw dropped open.
Monday morning
“The wound became infected, even after receiving proper medical attention. Like you, like me, John was incapacitated for months after being shot. He told me stories about the physiotherapy he had to endure afterwards just to regain simple motion in his arm and hand, to pick up a cup, to button up a shirt.  He found the simplest tasks laborious and he was a surgeon.”
“John?” Sherlock eased him down to the floor as John’s legs turned into boiled noodles. He touched John’s cheek, shocked at how pale and clammy the skin felt. He searched for a pulse and sucked in a harsh breath when he couldn’t find one. When he observed how John’s chest didn’t move at all, not even in the slightest, he yelled over his shoulder, “
“Obviously, but why the bodies are being left there will remain unclear to me until I get more data. And I can’t get more data until I’m fully recovered from this blasted bronchitis,” Sherlock ruffled his hair in annoyance then let his arms droop down the sides of the chairs. “
“Yes,” Mary said faintly while thinking
Maddening…the entire situation was maddening.
“I…” Josie looked at Mary blankly. “I can’t afford a PI.”
Violet listened politely until they were less than a half block away from the clinic. Then she paused, fingering the scarf wrapped around her throat, inexplicably  nervous.
Sherlock scanned him again with his all-seeing eyes. “You want to…” he flapped his hand around. “Do the talking thing,” he mumbled.
,” Sherlock sneered.
, John. But when you’re not right, I’m utterly lost.”
“Oh God,” Irene wiped her bloody hands on her filthy jeans. “What about his fiancée?”
Slower than normal, John made his way up the staircase. The dog bite and sprain were healing quite nicely, despite the strain he had put on his ankle at The Copper Beaches. The doctor said in a fortnight he could probably start riding his bicycle to work again.
Violet let her head loll back as she closed her eyes. Of course.
“Oh,” the middle-aged man took off his tortoise-shelled glasses and tugged on his tie, loosening it. “Busy as ever.”
Violet shook her head at Sherlock’s idea of a Good Time. But then she dismally thought,
Molly realized she was crumpling the card in her hand. She unclenched her fists, blinked the tears away and waddled back to her desk. She put the card down on the desk and tried to smooth it back out.
. This was his miracle.
John, home from military service, called an ambulance since he never got around to learning how to drive. Then he called his sister, half-furious, half-terrified she had fallen off the bloody wagon again.
“After we solve the case and cash the check.”
“I told you,” Violet leaned against the counter as she glowered at Sherlock. “In a car accident, what the hell does that have to do with anything?”
“Well, he has one now apparently.”
Sherlock actually looked regretful. “I need more data, Greg.”
She didn’t know how long she sat there. But she jumped in shock when she felt a fluffy towel placed over her shoulders.
“Ah,” Mary cottoned on, “Of course, obvious. John’s nicer than Sherlock. She’ll feel more comfortable talking to John than Sherlock. Should I text him, John?”
“Yeah, he’s not exactly a poster child for healthy, committed relationships,” Violet dryly pointed out. “Besides, that’s not the only reason why I’m a little jealous.” Impishly she added, “It’s not even the biggest reason, to be completely honest.”
“What,” she sounded out of breath. “Did you say?”
“You may call me Violet, if you like,” Violet had said, friendly enough, “Since I’m part of The Family and all.”
And Bill was going to do just that. First order of business, getting the right hell out of here.
The first file was the report on Sherlock being shot in Charles Augustus Magnussen’s office.
The front door opened. Gladstone bounded in first, making a beeline for Sherlock, nuzzling his hand, demanding to be petted.
“He can piddle on the floor for all I care. Fuck it,” John joked but he sat up as well. “Alright, time to be responsible adults, I suppose. The rubbish needs to go out, I’ll tend to that. And there’s some charting I need to catch up on as well. Probably should check on emails, to see if Sherlock has any interesting cases. I’m sure he’s probably driving Violet mad by this point.”
Maybe it was good enough for her, but it wasn’t good enough for him anymore.
Violet’s frown was a foul and frightening thing.
“Listen you little dy-”
“That is classified,” Mycroft solemnly informed her.
“He was no toff uni lad dabbing with cocaine because he was bored with his studies and other First World Problems. He hit whatever was below rock bottom. See, I never put two and two together until now. His ID card said “William Holmes,” not “Sherlock.” After all, Sherlock’s a bit more of a memorable name than
“Then talk to your cronies in Congress and get us some more funding,” Melrose retorted. “We’ve got bigger fish to fry at the moment.”
… then a mean little voice in his head said,
“They were going to kill Violet and pin it on me? Why?”
“Don’t apologize,” Violet got up and looked around, searching the lounge for a box of tissues. Spying them on Sherlock’s desk, she went to get them then sat down next to Mary on the sofa. As Mary pulled tissues out of the box, Violet said, “I have a deal with Sherlock, you see. That I won’t pry into his private life until it directly involves me… and vice-versa, actually. Otherwise we’d drive each other mad. I… I know we both are hiding in plain sight and we both have very dark pasts we’re trying to outrun… but I can’t help you, unless you tell me honestly about anyone and everyone who may bear a grudge against you or John.”
Sherlock slipped his hand from out of Violet’s hold and bounded out the door. John, Mary and Violet followed suit.
“And thank you for bringing up the second point,” Gagnon leaned forward. “We do not require your help in this matter at this time but when we do, I will contact you. I don’t need the British interfering with a French affair.”
“Oh, yes, all the international law enforcement agencies only wanted the best for this case,” Mycroft ruthlessly played on Sherlock’s arrogance.
Canadian and he
He curled his fingers into hooks. He stomped over to the huge bed he occupied with Tristan. The only good thing she ever did was conceive and carry Edward. Beyond that, she was useless. She wasn’t even pretty anymore.
“Oh God,” Violet’s heart leapt into her throat. “I’m sorry.”
And then Sherlock fell.
Sherlock straightened up, his face mulish. Ignoring her second question, he reminded her, “This is my flat, if you recall. I can have what I want here.”
Perhaps sentiment is blinding me, he worried as the receptionist buzzed him.
Violet tried to pick up her chair but discovered she really couldn’t bend over in her dress. “Little help please, Sherlock,” she whispered but a server materialized out of thin air, put the chair to rights and pulled it out for her.
But actually… killing someone… instead of someone else taking care of it for him...
He felt the same claustrophobic sensation he had experienced in the stairwell of the holiday flats, when Sherlock had pressed his bony body flush against John’s… his breath warm on the outer shell of his ear as he huffed “
She shook that thought away as well. While Mycroft spoke quietly to his minions, Violet whispered to Sherlock, “Anything?”
was personal. She was the only woman to have defeated him. Silly, really, to be so misogynistic, but some men just won’t get with the times.” Politely, he added, “Would twenty-thousand pounds do for compensation?”
people react the way they do when they are thrust into various situations. You are so attuned to human emotion, sometimes you even experience the same sensations they are. You feel what they are feeling. You knew how to crack Julia Stoner because you knew she feared retribution from the Red-Headed League. You knew how to get Mary back on your side because you know her downfall is John Watson. You were able to break through John Watson’s considerable defenses because you emphathized with his PTSD but you never pitied him. You fainted the day Moriarty’s face was on every screen in England because you were feeding off the emotion of everyone in the street. Coupled with your own intense terror, it all overwhelmed you, but you didn’t fight it. You didn’t run from it. You just let it overtake you. You allowed yourself to drown in it. You aren’t like me and my brother, you aren’t
Violet swallowed hard and jerked open the passenger side door as Sherlock drove the bike, black as sin, around the road in a lazy loop then parked it right at the alleyway’s entrance. Taunting their predators, Violet realized with a shudder.
Violet ignored him. “Take the packages back to Baker Street, please!” she hastily instructed before slamming the car door shut.
“I did call a doctor! I called Dr. Ludlow. He gave me anti-anxiety meds, but I didn’t like how they made me feel. I didn’t like feeling sluggish, I wanted to feel… well, I complained so he gave me Oxy. That didn’t work, so we kept experimenting unt-”
Also, a cookie to anyone who noticed my little Iron Man 3 nod.
Gladstone whined. Violet shushed him. “I thought it was strange,” Violet told him in a cool, clipped voice, her Official Federal Agent Voice. “If Sherrinford Holmes wasn’t supposed to exist anymore, why would there still be photographs of him, papers for him? Mycroft’s too careful. He would have been sure to destroy them. Then I realized
“No,” Violet bit her lip again. Only this time she didn’t stop herself. “But the definition of a cult doesn’t always necessarily have religious connotations. It can define any social group with deviant beliefs and…” she paused. “And rituals.”
7:15 PM Paris time
“Mm.”
But all they had to do was look up and see headlights in the distance.
“What’s not real,” he moaned, still seeing stars.
“He must have stopped,” Sherlock started to take his hand away when he didn’t feel anything, but Molly pressed her free hand on top of his.
Violet Hunter fought not to smile.
But Mary did not get her command out on time. Susan flipped the lip of the cool box off.
Chapter Twenty:
“Never mind, it couldn’t be helped,” Mycroft had sighed, shaking his head. “Dr. Hoop- ah, I mean, Dr. Lestrade is far craftier than she was given credit for,” he reached for his mobile, appearing to lose interest in the agents. “After all, she was instrumental in the success of The Fall. Without her, my brother wouldn’t have had freedom of movement for two years, crippling Moriarty’s cult. Continue visual surveillance, maintain a reasonable distance. Dr. Lestrade is still a target as she is still considered a close confidant of my brother. When the Lestrades lower their guard, we’ll reinstall the cameras and bugs,” He nodded at the agents, a dismissal.
Violet told Gladstone to stay and she entered the room. Macpherson was photographing the room and two other forensics analysts were milling about, dusting for prints after Macpherson took his pictures of that part of the room.
“Are you and Mary going to be able to pull off the Happily Ever After act?”
“Shhh… it’s over and done with. I don’t want to dwell on it anymore, nor do I want you to.”
But instead of feeling elated, as he usually did when he cracked a case, he felt a bone-shattering sorrow compressing his chest.
8:45 AM
“He was a greedy pig,” Marie confirmed with a nod. “Glad he’s dead. He got my brother killed and hurt my friend. He would have been bad for business, bad for
“Sit the fuck down, Sherlock Holmes.”
Tuesday evening
She plopped down on the sofa next to Mary. The plastic cover again made a farting noise, louder than before. “Good thing Jimsie don’t check under the bed,” she chuckled after letting poor Pooh fall from her mouth and into her lap. “Pooh-bear was the first thing I hid,” she said proudly, petting the silly old bear on his head. Then she scowled, “And her precious iPhone. Probably could have gotten three-hundred quid for it, but…” she shoved the toy bear and the box towards Mary. “It’s in there along with some pictures and jewelry. Nothing fancy, just costume bits and bobs she picked up here and there. Her charger’s in there too…so…” she cleared her throat. “If you could tell her that we’ve got our phones turned back on again, so if she wanted to give her old Mumsie a call…” she folded her lips together.
Feeling the underlying, paralyzing fear trying to burst through the haze of apathy, she took a deep cleansing breath through her nose.  She turned away from Sherlock again. Told herself she felt
look like his da’, doesn’t he? Except his nose, he’s got your nose, doesn’t he? I always thought you had the cutest nose.” He tilted his head, as if really seeing her for the first time. His eyes dropped down to Molly’s bloody hands then languidly flicked back up to Molly’s tear-streaked face. “Oh, but I did underestimate you, didn’t I, Molly Hooper Lestrade.”
“She’s helping AGRA locate Marissa Watson.”
“John, they keep the victim alive for a month. The girl was taken two days ago. There was no sudden cancellation. There was no family emergency that caused Rucastle’s summer home to be open now. I did my research. The Copper Beaches has been sitting empty since June. It hasn’t been let out much because Rucastle charges an exorbitant amount of rent. And the people who can actually afford to pay hate him.”
And couldn’t.
He nearly forgot how he meant to pleasure John when he felt the sole of John’s foot rubbing his back up and down. Sherlock nearly started purring like a contented cat.
“It’s the PTSD,” Violet immediately went into psychologist-mode, “Sholto’s death triggered it and his horrible sister has made it worse. All these emotions he’s been suppressing for so long, years even, are finally bubbling up now, threatening to spill over. Sherlock, listen,” Violet clutched her mobile and dropped her voice to a whisper again. “I was wrong. John leaving the country was a terrible idea.”
Friday
Sherlock woodenly quoted the snippet of conversation he had overheard when John had confronted Violet about the same thing months ago verbatim: “’And you, you just sat by on the sidelines. He thought you were his friend.He killed himself for you. And you did nothing. Well, you can finally do something now even though it’s too little, too late…clear his damn name. He’s your friend. Dead or alive, he’s still your friend so you owe him at least that.’”
“It is,” Sherlock cautiously let her go. “Not sure what good it does anyone now, with the lot of them dead, Rucastle and the Tollers.”
“How is he not bursting into flames is what I want to know,” John sniggered.
“Excellent. You will help set up a false trail for both MI-6 and the Red-Headed League to follow. A wild goose chase, if you will. Who knows, you might even have a bit of fun while you’re gone.”
“Ah, excellent,” Sherlock said, reading a text from Lestrade’s colleague, Detective Inspector Montgomery. “They’ve decided to wake our friend Gordie up for a late-night chat, since a woman’s life is at stake and all. Shall we, John?”
“One can hope,” Mycroft agreed then lightly added, “Dismissed.”
she thought dimly as she tried to sit up.
This was the first time Lestrade had seen Sherlock since the wedding. He definitely had mixed-feelings about Sherlock sitting in his office, spewing his usual vitriol. But on the other side, his genius really couldn’t be denied.
The way Sherlock pulled his nose up at raisins always made John giggle.
4 July 2016
“THIS IS MY CASE!” he screeched like a banshee.
Under the soles of his good Italian shoes, bits of rubbish crinkled and squished. Sweet wrappers. Cigarette butts. Sticky condoms.
“That’s anti-climatic,” John quipped as Sherlock put the memory stick on the black duvet and snapped a photograph of them with his Smartphone.
“Stone, NO.”
Dupin
She had snapped the prepaid mobile shut, a flimsy flip-hone, and lay back down. Of course, it pinged again. “Have to have the last word, don’t you?” she mumbled with affection. She didn’t sit up this time, just flipped the mobile back open to read his message:

Happy Sunday!
say a lot of things,” Violet clasped her hands together, willed them not to spasm. Or worse, lock up and become immobile. Her body often rioted against her when she needed it to cooperate.
ears?”
, she begged as she spread her left fingers as wide as they could go, hoping she could hold herself steady just long enough to finish climbing onto the roof…
John risked a glance at Violet instead.
“Oh, I’ll pay for it tomorrow,” she yawned. She found his hand, splayed across her belly. She linked her fingers through his. “But that’s tomorrow.”
Sherlock lifted his head up and let his hands drop between his knees and thighs. Turning his head as the bed sheets behind him rustled, he whispered, “Did I wake you?”
“Shouldn’t the little FBI friend be included in this conversation?” a dry-as-dust feminine voice piped up behind him.
The plane leveled but only for a moment. Then it bounced up and down as if encountering a bad bout of turbulence.
He hadn’t moved, hadn’t opened his eyes.
“I see,” Janine gave Alby’s silky, mismatched ears (one brown, one black-and-white) one more good scratch. Then she stood up, “C’mon then.” When Donovan gave her a bemused look, she sighed, “As you said, it’s rude not to offer you a cuppa. I was on my way to do food shopping though. I don’t have a crumb of cake or bite of biscuit to offer you. I’m out of milk too.”
Sherlock tilted his head, his face rearranging itself back into its normal unemotional mask. “There’s no use feeling guilty for what just happened,” he droned, “so do stop your tedious mental self-flagellation.” Then he screwed his eyes shut and shook his head, as if mental admonishing himself for being Not Good. In a softened voice, he added, “I’m not the most human of humans, John. You are. You always have been, always will and while you’ll always be my,” here he smirked. “
Thanks always for reading. Happy Sunday! :^)
“Not,” Sherlock’s voice was clipped, “On me. Come, Lestrade.” He paused, placing his hand on the doorframe. “Actually, it may be better if you… you have Molly and, uh… well,” his eyes slid to the floor. “Henry shouldn’t have to grow up without a father so...you should go on down. Wait for the military and The Met to catch up.”
rather obvious.”
She splashed more cold water on her burning face…
“Uh… yeah, errr… um, the dog is watching.”
Sherlock’s hair was sinfully soft and thick. It reminded him of the fluffy Angora bunny his nursery school had as a class pet. Upon closer examination, however, John noticed, with a little glee, that his hair was not completely jet black as he always thought it to be. A few strands of silver glistened through the inky curls.
“You think your marriage will have no effect on John?” Mycroft narrowed his black eyes.
A vein popped out of Sherlock’s forehead when he admitted he couldn’t do something.
“In under thirty minutes? And where was the body?”
them.
“Because it’s a paper trail that leads from Jack Woodley to Violet Emilie Laura Smith, the office manager in charge of Billing and Accounts at Carruthers Brokerage Firm, which was where the dirty money for Moriarty’s clients was washed then hidden,” Marshall explained. “It wouldn’t take a genius to start putting two and two together and figure out that Violet Smith is the same person as Violet Hunter. All it would take really is a persistent rookie wanting to make their mark or a persistent reporter in pursuit of a Pulitzer.”
, John longed to scream at her. Instead he muttered, “’Course we are.”
“ALL THE FUN?” Violet had squawked at him once they were safely ensconced in the cab..."
Violet thought as the man came closer, smiling like he’d won the lottery.
“Yeah,” John couldn’t keep the envy out of his voice.
He laughed bitterly, silently to himself as he started to card his fingers through Sherlock’s curls.
“Lestrade’s fussy now about who’s on his team,” Alex informed everyone.
Sherlock could feel his fingers falling asleep because of this. But it was a small thing in the grand scheme of things. Hearing John groan with pleasure and feeling the tenseness of his body as he valiantly tried to be polite and not gag Sherlock by thrusting into his mouth outweighed the minor inconvenience of tingling fingers.
, Mary thought as she watched the YouTube video, grinding her teeth.
But Sherlock was faster. “He flicked you in the eye, Janine. He was grossly disrespectful of your personal space, and  he overworked you and underpaid you. Not to mention he was also verbally abusive as well. But you said nothing and did nothing because you knew he was the Napoleon of Blackmail. So you stayed, working for that vile man because you knew how he crushed other people and you were terrified he would do the same to you.”
“Ohhh,” Mycroft exhaled a plume of smoke then closed his eyes.
Violet now stood in front him, shoving the mobile in front of his face, trying to force him to
“What?” John nearly dropped his mug of tea.
“You know there’s a ton of shit on my conscience, so why don’t you give me a clue as to what
Latimer stared at Moser then back at Sherlock then back at Moser, “He… figured out I flunked out of college by looking at
. Not knowingly, anyway.
Mary, of course, always Mary attacking him…
Violet shrugged, taking a lady-like sip of her drink. John knew that along with tea, she did not like most ales or lagers. John had razzed her about it once, asking if she preferred the piss most Americans drink, that God-awful Budweiser shit. She had primly responded she was a Coors Light girl,
“What did you do?” John asked, seeing a twinkle in Sherlock’s eye now. “Sherlock, if you bought a spider monkey, Violet is going to wring your skinny neck.”
Be flexible, be
Whatever the reason, Violet was glad to be rid of the damn things and that she hadn’t been expected to bleach her hair as well. After years of dyeing her natural dishwater-blonde hair red, she wasn’t sure how her hair would have handled going blonde only to be immediately re-dyed chestnut again. She had a feeling it would have turned into the texture of straw, assuming it wouldn’t have fallen out completely.
“I don’t mind, that’s what Chapstick is for,” her eyes were hooded and her voice raspy with desire as she skimmed her hand up his throat to his face, ghosting her fingertips over his cheekbones. A delightful shiver coursed up his spine.
Mary closed her eyes. “I don’t want my daughter having the same life I had. And I don’t care if he’s your brother, Sherlock; if he continues to stand in-between me and my child, I will kill him.” Now she opened her eyes, the stony, cold look creeping back into her face.
,” he elbowed Sherlock good-naturedly.
Sherlock held the vial out to her. “Sample One.”
. I even handed you a glass of water because I knew you would be too nervous to imbibe tonight.” His eyes lowered. “You didn’t even notice, didn’t even see it was me.”
“Why do you keep calling me that?”
, Sherlock smiled at his naïve friend.
“Is it the boys?” Mary’s cornflower eyes became huge with anxiety.
The door scraped against the floor as Violet had swung it open. Her heart had started racing when she snaked her arm around the doorway, searching for the light switch. She half-expected Toller to grab her wrist and ask in his oily voice, “And what are you doing in here?”
“What?”
“Oh Mary, that’s so old-fashioned,” Susan scoffed, hugging her hold-all to her.
Instead of texting his wife, however, he reminded Dupin that he was left-handed and it was his right shoulder that had gotten bashed by the falling rocks in the Catacombs. Then he watched Sherlock create a replica of the damn Letter that caused all the fuss in the first place.
“Pardon?” Violet tilted her head in confusion.
Molly looked down, twisting the bed sheets with her hands. “I thought I was protecting you if you didn’t know,” she whispered. “I feel like I’ve made so many mistakes with the decisions I made.”
“Right,” Sherlock snarled then amended himself, “
“In exchange for her assistance, Doña Nalda will receive the money required to bribe the gaolers to release little Mirana.”
If John had known who Sherlock’s travel companion was, he would not have been pleased. When he had made Sherlock promise not to travel alone, he had expected Sherlock to bring someone like Dupin or Lestrade with him. Someone large, someone physically intimidating.
John looked into those guileless cornflower blue eyes. Wished for the millionth time that he didn’t know about the other side of her, the side of her that could kill for money, the side of her that had pulled the trigger instead of trusting Sherlock to help her.
“Wonderful,” John groaned as Sherlock tossed his coffee into the nearest bin. John took a swallow of his, grimaced after burning his tongue then threw his cup away as well.
“Alex, what’s up?” he asked as she sat primly down in the chair in front of his desk.
John let Gladstone off his leash as he opened the door. “Hey,” he called out as Gladstone bounded into the room. His nose wrinkled as he smelt cigarette smoke. He then spied the suitcases, hold-alls and laptop bags on his bed, all of luggage yawning open, waiting to be fed Dupin’s belongings.

Didn’t want to see how much bigger her baby bump had gotten.
Bill started shaking his head back and forth. “I dunno, mate. I mean, I look like a fool. I’m the bleeding silk purse made from a sow’s ear.”
She was, after all, supposed to be dead.
A sacrifice (usually of a pawn) used to gain an early advantage in space or time in the opening.
“Well, I’m not married and I don’t have kids. That’s why Dad wants me to come back. He thinks it’d be easier for me to come home since I don’t have a spouse and kiddies to contend with.”
Dupin frowned then tilted his head. “Is it really kinder for him to carry on with a dying woman?”
“You’re a former CIA operative; surely you’ve had some investigative training? I can’t pursue the case, obviously. I am literally in the middle of
“Yes,” Sherlock and Dupin chorused then Sherlock added, “Obviously,” just to have the last word, as usual.
Violet’s eyes flew open. “You… you would actually… have your own brother killed?” The pins-and-needles sensation crept back into her arms and legs.

here, not England.”
She wasn’t worried about Sherlock and Mary.
“Well, I’m right here,” Sherlock’s irritated voice jerked him back into the present. “You’ve seen me, so how about you do something productive? How is that woman,” Sherlock pointed again at the photograph of Margaux Vos, her MI-6 ID picture identifying her as “Agent Jensen”, “Connected to Jim Moriarty and more importantly,
“A bit before six, I dunno, I left my mobile in my coat pocket.”
. “I think so,” she said lightly. “I also have chamomile. Or peppermint. If your stomach is still off from all the boozing at Molly and Greg’s wedding.”
Sherlock gave John a look that clearly communicated his thoughts:

But Harry paid  no mind to the young girl’s flinching. “Although, it would be nice for someone else to take care of me for a change, it’d be nice not to be the breadwinner,” she shot Clara a nasty glance. “Enjoying your posh flat that I bought and paid for, hm?”
Saturday night
All the lights were off, except for one softly glowing lamp. She could see the back of Sherlock’s curly head.
Moments of weakness like that made him ache for John. Made him realize that’s what he longed for, craved for, a true partnership. Same beliefs, emotions and libido working together.
2:30 PM
“Something? Like what?”
23 November 2015
“But you’re not religious now? I mean, I never see you at chapel.”
“Hacked into MI-6, pulled his records, forwarded them to Noelie to give to Hollywood,” Lisbeth said blandly, still in English but reverting back to her Swedish accent. “MI-6 desperately needs a firewall upgrade. Wasn’t even a challenge,” she sniffed.
In his brusque, succinct manner, Sherlock gave Violet the pertinent details of the present situation. Violet responded in her usual dry manner, “Well, shit.”
Chapter Eight: Tallulah
“Oh, I didn’t know you shaved with diamond rings now,” Sherlock drew himself up to his full height, his face closed and his voice at his haughtiest.
London, England
Sudden Death
“A quarter to three.” Sherlock rumbled. John risked a glance at the detective and saw that he wore a fresh suit and a clean shirt (the powder blue one, the one Violet always complained made him look like a corpse.) His dark curls still looked a bit damp and his face looked smooth, newly shaven. In this light, his unblinking, analytical eyes appeared to be gunmetal blue.
. “And some Smartwatches have a pre-set that allows a distressed owner to send an SOS message if they are in trouble. Sally’s probably been trying to communicate with us all this time but the idiots at the Met didn’t take her messages seriously. Or they were routed to…. Cardiff,” he held his hands up. “Oh, of course, the SOS message would go to her work, at the private investigative company she worked at instead of in London because she doesn’t know anyone in London except the Masons.”
He rolled out of the stupid bed, bowing down so he didn’t hit his head… again. This boat was not built for anyone over five feet tall.
She dipped into her little nest egg, her savings from her dark, bloody days as an assassin and set up a double-hit. If Mary was assassinated or if anything should happen to her that would cause an unnatural, premature death, a hit would automatically go  out on Sherlock. The price tag on his curly, black head was five million euros.
“Those are whip marks,” she kept her palms on her thighs. His shoulders lowered but he didn’t turn around. “Someone wasn’t fucking around when they got their hands on you.”
good…
“Hey, what are you doing up here?”
There were three cups neatly placed in three saucers. Milk and sugar in their respective receptacles were also set out, along with lemon wedges in a crystal bowl. Scones and cucumber sandwiches were neatly laid out on matching platters. The scones were the stale orange-cranberry ones Mary was supposed to throw out and the cucumber sarnies were posh, no finger sandwiches made from mayo and white bread. Perfect round cucumber slices were placed in the dead center of the cream cheese coated square of rye, sprinkled with fresh herbs.
“When we moved him in here, he had been good, for the first month or so. But slowly, he started slipping back into his old habits. We’d try to stop him and he’d get back on track. Then, out of the blue, he stopped taking his anti-anxiety meds. Then he fired his therapist and everything went to shit,” Honoré smeared an antibiotic cream over the cut, pleasantly cool on John’s skin. “And I mean literally, to shit. That’s what made the maid quit. Between emptying the litter boxes and cleaning up after the cats who didn’t use the boxes then arguing with Dupin daily about what’s garbage and what’s not, she’d had enough. So, it’s just been me trying to keep the place livable.”
“What?”
Rat Boy duck-walked to the back of the van and threw the doors as Lisbeth fumbled for her laptop and smartphone. “Dammit,” she muttered, looking at her smashed laptop.
“Stop, don’t make me laugh,” Mary giggled as she put her hand on her abdomen.
To add insult to injury, three jewels had been removed from the crown. The docent, a very panicky man called Alexander Holder, told Lestrade that the diamonds and emeralds had been untouched. The missing gems, semi-precious stones called “beryls” had been the ones removed from the ruined coronet. As the diamonds and emeralds were far more valuable, this made no sense. However, the Louvre was up in arms about the ruined crown, threatening to make bad international relations between the EU and the UK even worse.
“A bit and it’s blowing back here.”
“I don’t want to be
But  that particular bolt-hole was clear across the city, not to mention too close to several popular tourist traps and Michelin starred restaurants. Violet wanted to avoid large crowds of people at all costs. So even though that meant nearly freezing to death as she navigated her Triumph through London traffic, Violet selected the other bolt-hole she knew about.
Then she slid off the sofa and knelt down to hug her dog for dear life. Sweetie whined helplessly when Mary started crying. Clinging to the dog, her shoulders shook from the force of her sobs as she thought in an endless, hellish loop:
“And lock the door,” Sherlock commanded.
Never had he felt the desire to use more than he did right now. What he wouldn’t give to feel the brief pain of the needle pricking his arm, and then the sweet rush of oblivion.

Now John shrugged. “Fine, I guess.”
“That’s what was weird though,” Josie said as she wiggled her fingers in her freshly bound hands. Realizing her hands would still work, she reached for her drink. Took another swallow then said, “It wasn’t a man who picked me up. It was a woman. She said she was picking me up to bring me to my… my, uh, you know. My client. I thought that was weird, but whatever.” She clutched her drink glass. “There was no warning. One minute we’re sitting there, nice as can be and the next moment she just started to

Sometimes he wished he could turn it on and off like a tap.
8 August 2015
. The sky was an impossibly bright blue that melded with the deep sapphire blue of Lake Geneva. In the distance, the purplish-grey Jura Mountains capped with blindingly white snow could be seen, surrounded by lush emerald-coloured meadows. Meanwhile, the city was a mix of modern chic and antique quaint. Starbucks and strudel. Apple stores and Olympic memorabilia.
, Violet ran a hand down her thigh as she recalled the nasty road burns she received when she purposely laid her bike down in order to shake MI-6’s tails last spring.
,” cool, comforting hands suddenly cradled his face. Someone started stroking his hair. “John, love,” a gentle, feminine voice crooned to him. “John, you’re having a panic attack, it’s alright, sweetheart, you’re safe, you’re safe, no one will hurt you again, I promise.”
And here she was, living to fight another day.
?” Archie’s eyes glowed.
Then he let John lead him to his own bedroom.
But she refrained. She didn’t know how much Mary knew about Sherlock, how much John had told her… and her intuition whispered to her not to completely trust Mary.
When the sun started to fade into the west, sometimes, again if she wasn’t too tired from the barrage of tests and he wasn’t too wiped out from thinking, he would come out from the galley of the boat dressed in swim trunks. They would float near the boat, letting the waves rock the concerns and care from their minds while caressing their bodies in watery graceful embrace.
“You’re lying,” Mycroft’s voice sounded more wondering than angry.
“Jesus Christ,” John moaned. Mary put her arms around John’s shoulder.
“I don’t know,” Victor sounded aggrieved for the first time. “Thought you might have wanted to talk to an old friend after all of that.”
“One more thing.”
She felt something twanging inside her, that strange sensation her former boss had always joked about, called her “spidey-sense.” Her grandmother had experienced the same feelings and had always said “Someone’s walking over my grave,” whenever she had her odd flashes of insight. Sherlock would have mocked her, of course.
“Ah, yes, dear
“Yeah, I think you really do,” Honoré said softly. John jerked his head up, glaring at young man. But he held his hands up, as if John pointed his gun at him. “Look, please don’t take this wrong. I don’t mean this in a gay way, but, you see, Marie just wasn’t his work colleague or his live-in girlfriend. She was his best friend. Marie and Dupin made sense together, like you and Mr. Holmes do. One wasn’t complete without the other.” Honoré rubbed his forehead then scrubbed his entire face. “OK, that sounded totally gay. I’m sorry, it’s just…”
“Once he takes the bait, once he believes that John and Dupin are really on Violet’s trail, he’ll want to oversee the operation personally.”
, Stone, I don’t want you to cut your paws.
As the three older women howled with laughter, Mrs. Holmes actually wiping tears of mirth out of her eyes, Violet’s mobile buzzed. She fished it out of her jeans pocket and read the Caller ID.
“Yes, yes, that… that stupid
He also saw Rat Boy and Lisbeth enter right on her heels. Lisbeth looked as she always did, which was mildly pissed off at the world. Rat Boy however appeared to have seen the Mother Mary and the Baby Jesus.
“No,” Sherlock said after a pained pause. “I suppose you didn’t. Mycroft planted the tip, to lure me back to England, well back to MI-6 really. He had planned on scooping me up when I arrived in Serbia but he hadn’t planned on me actually finding a Moriarty terror cell in Belgrade. He also didn’t plan on me being accosted by uncooperative Serbian soldiers, corrupted by Moriarty’s cult.” Using his thumbnail to dig under his pinkie nail for no reason other than he suddenly felt quite fidgety, he started to mumble “I was trapped in an unfamiliar forest, surrounded at gun point. I was brought to an interrogation center, where they started to ask me… questions… about who I was and why I was there.” He snorted silently with derisive laughter. “Mycroft learnt of my predicament. He disguised himself a soldier and infiltrated the center. Sat in a chair and watched them beat me to a pulp. Only when I deduced out loud that the wife of my torturer was having an affair and he stalked out in high dudgeon, then my brother announced his presence, only to let me know that he needed my help to uncover the terror cell that was planning on blowing up the Underground.”
“Even though you just stole evidence from a crime scene,” John reminded him as he brought out two mugs of strong, hot tea and a dog biscuit for Gladstone. “Plus an ashtray from Buckingham Palace, Lestrade’s badge and your brother’s credit cards.”
“Now,” Dr. Serena assured him as she waddled towards the desk. As she reached into her doctor’s bag, the tumbler in the door lock clicked. She jerked her head up then visibly relaxed as her father walked in, Paul following behind him. While the same height as his twin brother, he was considerably thinner and a bit more sophisticated and far more meticulous with his grooming, his hair always neatly styled and face clean-shaven. Now he wore an apron over the nice suit he always donned when working front of house as host. Trailing his portly father, he carefully carrying a covered tray.
“Correct,” Sherlock popped the “T” at the end of the word. “So, while it is not impossible, it is most unlikely she did him an injury then coerced him into suicide days later. But as I do not have access to the actual crime scene nor can I speak to the lady in question at this time, it is foolish to form any firm conclusions.”
He never said anything to Violet because someone like her didn’t have the luxury of creating permanent relationships. She might be here today, gone tomorrow. He didn’t need to add to her already considerable anxiety.
“He can because he has to,” Dupin informed Sherlock as he hopped onto the ladder. “You’ve been in worse predicaments, Dr. Watson.” With that encouragement, he skipped up the shaking ladder as quickly as he could.
Feeling Violet’s eyes on her, Mary shook her head.
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed noncommittally as he slit the envelope open with his thumbnail. He wandered back towards the coffee table as he read. Then he snorted and shook his shaggy black head. “Oh my,” he said with a touch of dry amusement in his voice. “My, my, my… the webs you weave, brother mine.”
Sherlock now rubbed his forehead with his fingertips. “Don’t
“At least I wear shoes on a consistent basis,” Sherlock sniped at John.
“You liked her.”
Mycroft smiled thinly. “I know, dearest
WTF is happening? – VT
Anna’s eyes watered and her chin wobbled. “You’re really the best of us all, you know that don’t you?” she brushed John’s hair back again. John tried to smile but there was something cold and hard in her voice that made John feel like she was condemning him instead of complimenting him. So he just dropped his eyes to his lap and studied his knees intently.
“We just had a case, yesterday, on his actual birthday,” Violet groused, using her shoulder to awkwardly push her fake glasses back up on her face with limited success. “I doubt we’ll get so lucky as to have two weird murders in one week. Especially since Sherlock solved the one yesterday so quickly.”
“OK,” John rubbed his mouth, wishing that he could have brought a cup of coffee into the library. While Sherlock claimed cigarettes were good for brainwork, John always preferred a hot drink when he had to do some serious thinking. “OK, Watson,” he flipped open his notebook. “What did you miss, what didn’t you see?”
“Violet wouldn’t risk assassinating the Senator, but she did contact him.”
“OK,” Molly looked like she was about to weep again, only out of relief this time. “But… does
Mycroft arched an eyebrow, “What does
But here he was, standing like a fool in his old bedroom, looking at all the things he had left behind. His old duvet and sheets. The lovely memory foam pillows he had abandoned in his haste to flee from the painful memories. All his remaining books plus the medals he had earned in Afghanistan. Stacks of old CDs. Photographs of his mother and old chums from the military. Ticket-stubs and postcards from friends stuck in the frame of the mirror hanging above the chest of drawers. Newspaper clippings of Sherlock’s exploits tacked up to a cheap bulletin board Mrs. Hudson had purchased for him at a jumble sale. The room was just as spick-and-span as he had kept it while he had lived here. It still smelled faintly like lemon polish and cedar wood. Masculine and clean.
“I’m sorry,” Violet wanted to get up and give him a hug.
“Because I want to view the pictures on a larger screen,” Sherlock murmured, “Obviously.” Then he stood there, humming while he waited for the download to complete. After an agonizingly long wait, Sherlock’s mobile pinged and Sherlock’s elegant fingers flew over the touch screen. Then he plucked the iStick out of his mobile and handed it to John.
But Rucastle must have told Sherlock to call him that because he mellowed slightly. “Shers, hey. Apologies… I didn’t… ARGGHHH!!!!” he ran his fat sausage fingers through his hair. “K-Mart backed out of the deal!” he wailed, like a little boy who had just been told Christmas was cancelled. “Those Yankee cocksuckers bloody reneged  on my clothing line!”
She shook her head and reached out to gently clasped his lower arm. “I don’t know,” she admitted as she pulled him to her.
“The dog, Susan?”
the ring tone Sherlock had programmed into John’s mobile for Mary. John hadn’t found it very amusing. Worse, Sherlock had done something to his mobile so John couldn’t change it.
“Open it,” Sherlock’s head popped up over a shelf. “Is there some sort of label or sticker identifying the owner?”
America Square Conference & Events Centre
It wasn’t just second cousins and spinster aunts who showed up at the church and, worse, the cemetery. The press and the paparazzi had shown up in full force as well. Harry’s murder was splashed out on every tabloid, despite the Met’s (and MI-6’s) best efforts to keep it quiet. But once word got out that the sister of Sherlock Holmes’ blogger was shot point-blank in the head in her fancy Mayfair flat, it spread like wildfire. The rags gleefully dug up all of Harry’s transgressions, her drinking, her gambling, her sex life and her ruined career.
5:47 AM
“Oh,” Sherlock rasped. “I’m counting on it.”
with my brother’s people.”
Dupin fell silent again as he patiently waited for John to start talking. John only started telling the story after the Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction” had ended. For the next three hours, with the combination of drawn-out silences and gently probing questions, Dupin drew the story out John, or as much of it as John was willing to tell. The story was only interrupted when they reached the Switzerland-Germany border and they had to produce their passports (and the “service animal” papers for Gladstone) for the border patrol’s inspection.
“Yes. I will not ask you to consult on future MI-6 cases. I do expect you to finish your current assignment with MI-6.”
“Wel-” Sherlock started but Violet reached up, grabbed one of his curls and pulled. Hard.
, Sherlock thought, his insides twisting with a pain he had never known before as he waited for Violet to break her silence.
“Pardon?”

“Mycroft, this should come from his
And Victor Trevor.
“Sherly?” a woman’s voice with a thick, Irish voice piped up behind them.
Wednesday morning
“That… makes no sense.”
“The information is unimportant,” Sherlock droned, “What is actually important is how it went missing in the first place and what led you lot of fools to believe it’s in France?”
“There’s still time, you know.”
The door was slightly open, so he used his hip to budge it open a bit more. “So, you were right about Dupin,” John started talking the minute he walked into the room. Shutting the door with his foot, he said, “Her name was Marie. Marie Row… Rue…. Rah… I don’t know. Can’t pronounce it correctly. Ruh-gay? I think? Dunno, anyway,” he dropped his wet and dirty clothes next to the pile of Sherlock’s wet and dirty clothes. “Honoré told me,” he turned to face Sherlock and fell silent. Then he smiled ruefully and shook his head.
“Fine, I’ll be ‘Mother’,” he relented through clenched teeth. Standing up, he leaned on his umbrella, as if it were a broad sword rather than an ordinary brolly. “Before I proceed, I insist you tell me what the merchandise was.”
“Look,” Dupin pointed by John’s foot. “Look and don’t move.”
, baby brother.”
“I trust this discovery of the Appledore vaults terminates any debt I owe you once and for all?” Sherlock arched an eyebrow as he stood in the doorway with his brother and John.
Mycroft closed his eyes and threw his head back in exasperation, listening to the cervical bones pop and click as he rotated his stiff neck.
“Do you really not want him at the funeral?”
John reached for Sherlock again. Feeling him shivering, John ran his hands up and down his arms, “What can Mary give me that you can’t?”
These two men were children when they started their careers as Consulting Criminals, or
“Of course you don’t,” Sherlock’s voice dropped in temperature. “You’re a family man, you have two children, girls. Mr. Latimer has two nephews. Neither one of you were assigned to the midnight shift because of your sentimentality towards
John read out loud:
Dupin had shrugged. “Oh yes. Descendants of Napoleon Bonaparte plus there are several pretenders as well. There are even those who claim they the rightful heirs to not only the French throne but also that of England, Scotland and Ireland.”
He dined alone, as was the norm. No one really ever ran to join the freak with the half-melted face at restaurants or bars at any rate. No one except the prostitutes and gold diggers, of course. Those disgusting sub-species of women knew the price of a good suit, a nice wristwatch and the latest smartphone.
Sherlock hummed but made no other response as he started laying out the pictures and documents in the order they appeared on the camera roll. Once everything was neatly laid out, Sherlock took a step back, drumming his fingertips against each other lightly.
, not a proper primary school,” Sherlock used the German term for nursery school. “You don’t remember your mother’s funeral?” When Violet shook her head, Sherlock informed her, “Because you didn’t attend it. You were in hospital for high fever and dehydration. You were too ill to go. You saw the snow falling from your hospital window.”
The Devil’s Foot Clubhouse
“I work, Alice.”
Sherlock jerked his head up, his eyes first widening then narrowed. “You picked me up at the hospital at the visitor’s entrance precisely forty-nine minutes ago, which is how I know you took the scenic route in order to inflate my fare. That being said, I had exactly sixty pounds in my wallet, two twenty pound notes, a ten pound note and two fives, which not only would have covered your fare (should you have chosen to be honest and taken the direct route to my home) but provided a more than adequate tip. Since you decided I really must have wanted to direct around Big Ben and Parliament as if I were some Yankee tourist, your tip is now quite miniscule but there is still enough there to cover the fare.”
She could not lay her finger on it, but Mary Morstan Watson was no sweet, mild-mannered nurse. When Sherlock had been abducted at the end of March, it had been Mary who figured out what Sherlock had deduced and what caused him to run straight into the lion’s den without bringing John or Violet or even Lestrade along for back up.
Everything had been going so smoothly. He had entered the United States with no problems. He had found his treacherous ex-wife and dealt with her with no fuss, no muss… OK a little muss… actually, a great big mess, but it was cathartic watching as her heart essentially exploded and then dismembering her.
John smiled, “Rwy'n dy garu  di.”

“How do you know? I haven’t seen you in

Heathcliff staggered backwards. He touched his lower lip, eyes widening when he saw blood on his hand. He licked his lip and gave Mycroft a savage smile.
“Hello John,” Miss Smith said warmly then leaned forward to kiss him. Formally, as she had on the stairs to 221B, but this time it was not nearly as frigid. And she breathed into his ear, as Violet Hunter, “I’m sorry I was such a bitch.”
Her eyes blazed, “I am
“Please tell me Annie at least had backups of her investigation.”
Violet wondered if he would ever get around to talking to her about his child.
John thought with a grin. “Sorry.”
“I said I was sorry,” Mycroft sulked like a child.
“Help you save your fiancée and your… friend?”
Since Mary was not a fan of crap telly, John had decided to read out loud to her instead to pass the time.
He hadn’t had to use it once. He was, however, quite aware that he was being followed wherever he went. Whether it was Mycroft or the Professor’s people tailing him, he wasn’t sure. He was damn glad that the dog was with him though. He had a feeling Gladstone’s presence ensured that whoever was following him, kept their distance.
“You can’t show them those pictures,” Mary hissed. “They’ll start asking questions, questions I can’t answer.” She closed her eyes again. “Last autumn, after the Sussex Vampire case and before you and John when to Paris to find that stupid Letter, you and Violet went to Boscombe Valley for three days to investigate the murder of Charles McCarthy without John, remember?”
Sherlock counted to ten. First
, she finally realized as Mary turned into the car park behind the block of flats.
“Yeah, there ain’t no coming back from that,” Rat Boy agreed.

Saturday evening
“Yes?”
Where on earth was he? Normally he glued himself to his brother’s side. Embarrassing, really, how he trailed after Sherlock. Like a moonstruck school boy. Like a loyal yet slightly brain-damaged lap dog, panting after his master, eager for praise.
Violet threw his book at him. He ducked. “John never had a problem with my experiments.” He ducked again as Violet lobbed his cup of cold tea at his head. “Now you are just being childish.”
And Harry showed up dead drunk to the funeral, with the back of her skirt tucked into the back of her tights. With her nearly-naked arse on full display, she shouted abuse to everyone on the Watson side of the family, until Clara finally led her away.
“Don’t know,” John muttered darkly.
Sherlock’s nostrils flared as she reached for a swath of filmy emerald material draped over the dainty chair in front of the vanity.
No thrilling chases down darkening alleys, no terse confrontations, no cracking of computer codes as the clock ticked down, no duel of wits. Just hours and hours of watching surveillance videos, reading hotel registers and making phone call after phone call, chores Sherlock usually let the peons at the Met handle.
Sherlock had whirled around, looking so ferocious, even John took a step back, and John was used to Sherlock’s mercurial mood swings. “Sherlock…” John had tried as usual to intervene.
“I’m sorry for your loss,” this time Sherlock was sincere.
“Oh, I’ve got instant cocoa if you don’t mind doing a pour-and-dunk with a tea bag,” Violet reached for the kettle, intending to fill it with water. “Or if you’d rather have coffee?”
From his vantage point on the sofa, Dupin observed and smiled..."
“Mm,” Sherlock looked up at the rooftop of the building, the building where it all began, where they became a team: he, John and Lestrade. The three of them together, creating the unholy trinity of Scotland Yard.  Sherlock tented his hands, lost in thought for a moment. Then he announced,“Going to have to improvise, I’m afraid.”

but she gritted her teeth and started slowly trying to work her hands free. Even as the plastic scraped the flesh away and blood beaded up, she continued to struggle against her bonds.
” John shouted, mangling the German.
Violet had vehemently balked at his “proposal” (for lack of a better word.) She had flat out told Mycroft his idea was “positively medieval.” But Mycroft had then explained (or rather, threatened her) that marriage was the only way he could ensure Violet would stay permanently shackled to Sherlock, to the Holmes family and to MI-6.
“Wrong question.”
“We’re not getting a monkey.”
“Safe and sound,” Sherlock assured her. “All of them. They are all en route back to London as we speak. I’ve been told her parents are elated,” he added the last bit in a confused voice, as if he couldn’t comprehend why her parents would be happy to be reunited with their daughter.
John had made unsolicited physical advances.
Mycroft nodded at one of his agents, “Get Jones.”
“I asked Wasp to vet her for me. Ironically the only skeleton Wasp was able to uncover is that Melrose turned out to be an old friend of my family.” His face darkened again, his eyes mostly grey and dark blue in their fury. “Closer than anyone ever imagined, ironically enough.” He paused for a beat then added in his usual sonorous yet clinical voice, “I had asked Wasp to do periodic sweeps of the Internet, the public Net that everyone uses as well as the Dark Net, to make sure your pictures didn’t crop up anywhere. Meanwhile, Melrose continued asking for proof of life. So far, I had resisted taken your photograph. I didn’t want your picture on my computer or my mobile, in case those items were compromised somehow. Plus, I never sent Melrose anything directly. I always sent everything to Wasp first then she worked her magic, created a convoluted digital trail so nothing gets traced back to me. Or you.”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft sounded regretful. “That’s out of my control.”

Friday night
Lord Trelawney-Hope had personally called Sherlock to thank him for his service to his country and invited him to a New Year’s party the prime minister was hosting. “Lord Bellinger also would like to thank you personally as well,” he regally informed Sherlock. “There’s been discussion about the knighthood .”
John tried to get up, but he had landed wrong when the big dog had landed on him. His ankle would not support his weight.
“When Violet moved in.”
But he also felt no attraction to Violet because he did indeed have a wife. He could never betray Mary like that… although, truth be told, he had fantasized about cheating on her during their estrangement last summer after he had learned she shot Sherlock. Not because he wanted sex, but because he

“I told you,” Sherlock thrust the bow into Violet’s face, nearly tapped her on the nose with it. “I was seeing a client for a private meeting at four o’clock today. I told you I needed the flat to myself.”
The cabbie (a squat fellow with jaundiced skin and huge ashy circles around his eyes wearing a grimy Mickey Mouse sweatshirt) didn’t make any conversation, just listened to NPR on the radio as he drove. He stopped in front of the stadium and told her the fare. She paid in cash and left him a large bonus, keeping her face hidden the best she could.
Meanwhile, as she watched the heartwarming scene, Anthea worried.
John felt a wave of hot jealous rage crash down him. Rucastle was a bastard but he got to keep his son. John always thought he was a good man and yet, his daughter got taken away from him.
“Which means,” John gave Gladstone a pat on his head, “It’s time for us to go to Baden-Baden. Mycroft will trail us like Hansel and Gretel following breadcrumbs to the gingerbread house.”
“Why didn’t you call the cops?”
“Trying to decide if I should make a pot of coffee or not. If you’re going to be awake for a while, I might as well.”
He frowned, pondering his instructions. On the surface, it was easy enough. The uniform would grant him access inside. All he had to do was solemnly recite his lines: “I apologize for the late hour, but I need to speak to you about your son,” and they would panic and let him in.
using.”
. And unstable, if someone blows that grotto up, the blast won’t be contained just in there. All of this could cave in!”
“She’s not lying,” Sherlock had said, although his toe was unconsciously tapping. He would have loved to gone out and cut a rug.
She turned slowly, facing Mycroft. She used the correct accent, the fake British one, “Coffee.”
So…Three possibilities… no... four…
As Dupin drove John to his secret little bistro back in Montmartre, Sherlock, after making a few astute deductions as to where this hotel might be, hailed a cab. His face matched the weather as the taxi zipped and zoomed through the congested traffic with ease. Once they reached the hotel, Sherlock vented his spleen on the cab driver by accusing him of taking him the longest way possible to his destination (he was right of course.) Just to be completely petty, he paid the cabbie in pounds with one euro wrapped around the fat wad of notes. He skipped out of the vehicle before the driver even realized what Sherlock had done.
She stood in the chilly sea for as long as she could bear it, admiring the variety of blues surrounding her, from the faintest almost arctic blue of the sky to the deep azure blue of the sea still untouched by the early morning light. She tilted her head back and breathed the salty tang of the sea into her lungs. Felt the warm kiss of spring sunlight on her face.
do anything else. He felt John shifting then resting his sandy-silvery head on his shoulder. Sherlock closed his eyes, rested his cheek against John’s still-slightly damp hair.
“I’m hardly a millionaire.”
“It’ll be fun,” Dupin clapped Sherlock on the back. Sherlock immediately stepped away from the French detective, his eyes blazing as he scoured Dupin head to toe, searching for a pressure point. John became more worried when he noticed Sherlock pressing his lips tightly together, his eyes slightly widened. John had only seen that particular look only once before but he recognized it, and didn’t like it. Not one bit.
The “new kid” was taking pictures as Sherlock led everyone into the nursery. John frowned at MacPherson. He looked like a ruddy hipster with his black spectacles and his long yet neatly trimmed beard. All that was missing was the testicle-crushing skinny jeans and the t-shirt with an ironic slogan across the chest. But the young man was wearing neatly pressed trousers and a proper dress shirt and plastic booties over his nice black loafers. Of course, the sleeves of that shirt were pushed up and all the tattoos covering his arms were clearly visible.
“Nope,” Lisbeth tapped her forehead again. “I saw the code.”

“Let’s get this over with,” Mary said in a strained voice.
John still smiled. “Not only will I kill you, but I’ll kill you
“Come on, let’s walk a bit ahead so we’re out of the other shoppers’ way,” Molly beckoned her mother, who pushed the pram, to follow her.
Muscle spasms
“Ah,” John put the pieces together. “This is your ‘in’ to Rucastle’s big party at The Copper Beaches. You think he’s going to try to  steal Violet from out underneath you in front of his celebrity friends.”
,” he dragged the word out into five syllables. “I thought he wanted me to beg off from the case because it was dangerous. Oh no. He just didn’t want a repeat of the Bond Air fiasco. Of course, I was high at the time, so my lapse of judgment is not without good cause.”
Sherlock nodded. “The mole’s right hand,” he snarled then slapped the memory stick out of John’s other hand and crushed it with the heel of his shoe. “Do not open that door,” he commanded as he snatched the iPad out of John’s hands. “But do not resist arrest when they enter.”  Sherlock shouted over his shoulder as he rushed to the lavatory with the iPad.
Meanwhile John kept raving, “And I don’t know how much longer I can keep her placated with threats and empty promises. We need to get Violet home. We need to get her proper medical care and we need her help ridding us of Professor Moriarty and his bloody Red-headed League once and for all, especially since that bastard is now targeting our kids.”
She hadn’t meant to doze off again. She had slept in late and even taken a short nap on the sofa in the afternoon. But she had still felt so run down, she couldn’t help it. She was just glad her nose no longer dripped like a leaky faucet. She knew Sherlock and John had talked long into the night after she had fallen asleep. Perhaps even into the dawn, she wasn’t sure. All she knew for certain that both men were dead asleep when she tiptoed into the lounge, wearing yoga pants, one of Sherlock’s ratty old T-shirts as well as his second-best dressing gown and a pair of electric blue socks.
“John should not have believed your lies and you completely misjudged the severity of his PTSD. Seeing how you so enjoy telling people about your expertise in reading people, you really should have known better than to approach him from behind. That was quite idiotic.”
As Edward screeched, she closed her eyes and pressed her lips shut. She could feel the boy’s spit in her face. She was glad she wore fake eyeglasses. She clenched her fists tightly together as the boy screamed in her face. But when he started hitting her, she did grab his wrists, holding him still.
“Thank you, doctor,” Mary whispered and Dr. Sodhi nodded and left them in peace.

, didn’t buy it. He started digging.
“Oh, I just don’t know,” Molly dithered, looking over her list. “I still can’t decide what to get Greg.”
Violet burst into laughter and John succumbed to giggles.
“Mm,” Sherlock popped tea bags into the ebony black mugs and poured the boiling water over them. “That’s one of the possibilities, yes.”
Violet closed her eyes, feeling tears threatening now. “You can’t do this. What about Sherlock? It’s his life too. He won’t want this. He won’t do this. This is… this is…” she covered her face with her hands like a child, “Mycroft,
“What just happened?” Violet had finally blurted out.
Violet of course hid these dark thoughts and had plastered a smile on her face while Molly flushed at Mrs. Hooper’s innocent comment.
“Can I bring Little Carlo?”
“My father built this for us, Mycroft and me,” Sherlock informed her, flipping open a lid of a shoebox he had found.  “All of the Holmes boys, even torpid Mycroft could sit up here, safe and sound. You did not observe the stay rods my father had installed to secure the house to the tree. He’s quite mechanically inclined, my father. Enjoys building things. He may subject you to looking at the things he had made in his spare time, for which I apologize for in advance, for it is quite dull. For a while he was obsessed with building ships-in-the-bottle. Then there was the painting miniature cars phase. He also likes to build model houses, built a few for charity for the church here in town, before we moved to London. Always said he wished he had a daughter so he could have built her a dollhou-”
Despite her blasé manner, Violet’s heart started to race. She clutched the Styrofoam cup so her traitorous tremulous hands wouldn’t betray her.

“You’re not being selfish,” John rushed to assure her. “Just… distracted, that’s all.”
She wasn’t as pure and clean as the freshly fallen snow, but god-dammit she was
“Bad people,” Mary snapped. “Very bad people.”
Sherlock knew what his Grand Gesture needed to be and it would kill two birds with one stone.
Sherlock slumped back into his chair. “Oh John…”
Sender Unknown.
“The things I do for you,” he breathed, dipping his head down, his lips millimeters from hers. He watched her pupils dilate. “Very well,” he purred as he ran the pad of his thumb over her lips. “Fireworks it is.”
Violet ran her hand down her face. “Oh my God,” she breathed, “How?”
“I always did want a pet monkey,” Sherlock said wistfully.
“He is your friend,” Violet’s voice was as faint as she felt. She wondered if she was about to have a heart attack or panic attack. Either way, she felt awful.
That’s just petty John – SH
“Thank God, Mrs. H is still in rehab, I’d hate to have to explain this to her.”
“It’s not?”
Mycroft scanned him from his bare toes up to his tousled blonde hair. Nervously Victor rubbed underneath his nose, as if he was wiping cocaine from the nostrils.
“I still maintain Mycroft cheated,” Sherlock said stiffly. “He always pilfers notes from the bank.”
“Wait,” John slithered out of Mary’s grip. “You know him?”
“No. Apologies. I had forgotten about him in light of tonight,” Sherlock immediately knew what Violet was doing. “Come along Violet. Let’s take care of the beast then call it a night. We will pick up where we left off when the sun is up.”
“We can’t sweep it under the rug because… well, of this morning.”
!” Violet snapped, sitting up now. Then she gave the kids a big smile and a wave because they had all stopped their game to stare at her. When the kids resumed their game, Violet hissed, “You can’t just plop a kid in Mary’s lap like she’s a stray kitten! Of course, Mary got attached and vice-versa, if the kid’s mother is terminal.”

“Uh,” Violet tightened her grip on the leash as Mrs. Toller extended her hand, expecting her to hand Gladstone over.
Molly brightened, “Oh, much better! I think he’s always going to be a handful but he slept four hours straight last night. That’s the first time he had done that ever.”
“Do you ever review what you’re about to say before the words leave your mouth?”
“Rucastle took Mary. He took her to the garage,” Sherlock pulled John away from the wall and started to help him walk towards the front door.
And the command to attack sat on the tip of her tongue in case Mycroft was retrieving something other than his umbrella.
John’s lips thinned.
“SHERLOCK...”
“Trouble overseas then?”
She continued glaring at him, her eyebrow cocked.
“Yeah, that martini Rucastle gave me is just coming back to haunt me,” Violet sipped the fizzy drink. Flicking her eyes at Sherlock quickly, registering his tired face, she looked back at John and said, “So, Dr. Evans?”
John considered this offer carefully then asked: “Can we go to The Tower of London, if it’s not too dear? I’d like to see the Fusiliers Museum and the ravens, plus we just got finished reading about Anne Boleyn in History so…” he licked his lips, an unconscious imitation of his father and looked up at Jack, expectantly, hopefully.
“Then if you’re not a fool, you should know that death is the greatest disguise of all.”
“Bless you Mrs. Hudson,” Violet breathed in relief. “And you too, Mary, thank you.”
Sherlock ignored John, as usual, “The messenger bag had been found on the bed,” Sherlock pointed to the neatly made bed. Again, this room was just as simple and modern as the rest of the flat and the color scheme again was creams, cocoas and coal-blacks. “Sara had put her messenger bag and her suitcase on top of the bed, intending to unpack. She must have been tipped off because when MI-6 raided the flat, only the suitcase and the messenger bag were left behind. The suitcase had been opened and some clothing had been taken out but not put into the chest of drawers and not hung up in the wardrobe.”
Violet put the tiny cup back on the tray next to her and was absurdly pleased she didn’t drop it. “Significantly diminished, I mean, I’m still slightly concerned about Moriarty’s people finding me and Mycroft going back on his word to clear my name once and for all and that I’m still legally dead as far as the United States is concerned, but other than that, I’m golden.”
… spark within her, tingling. Her “spidey sense.”The intuition Sherlock would have ridiculed if she had ever told him how much she relied on it.
Sherlock slowly doubled over until he rested his clammy cheek against the cool metal table. “I knew he was lying when he told me the wife took the kids on holiday to Ireland.”
But the aroma of blood and dog hair assaulted Sherlock’s nostrils, pushing John from his mind.
“Why me?” Violet burst out. “She has five outstanding warrants, two of them in the United States. All you have to do is arrest her and have her extradited. One of the warrants she has in the US is in Texas, which has the death penalty. Problem
“My television set is over seven years old,” Sherlock smoothly informed the bleeding thief. “Don’t watch much television, so I never saw the need for an upgrade. So I highly doubt you are here to purloin an out-of-date television set.”
… and eight year old Sherlock had started that fire, claiming he only wanted to scare Heathcliff into leaving him alone, to stop hurting him.
“I really do not appreciate you barging into my office,” Missy Stroper snapped.
about Mycroft?” Sherlock’s nostrils flared.
If circumstances had been different, it would have been funny.
“You think he would live long enough to make that run?”
John slammed the door in Mary’s face.
After her conversation with Green, Violet had crashed. But she woke up around nine-thirty, her body aching and her throat parched. After a glass of water and a cup of coffee (her stomach still felt off) Violet made a few calls to the bigger hospitals, faking an Australian accent the best of her ability, as it was not as similar to a British accent as she thought. She claimed to be his wife, so the admissions nurse could release information about him to her. Her attempts had been in vain. None of the hospitals she had called had admitted a man matching Peters’ description for a gunshot wound. That was not good. That meant she only winged him.
She had cocked her head, listening to Sherlock play a few full bars of whatever he had composed. Then she had shaken her head and said

At that time John had said he didn’t know. Now he did.
“I knew it,” Mary balled her fists. “I

He held his gun in his right hand. He wasn’t right-handed.
“Well, that just sounds ever so delightful, can’t wait,” Sherlock grumbled but he gratefully took the glass. The icy liquid felt wonderful on his aching throat.
Incredibly dull indeed.

hours of early morning, nothing was visible except for a stretch of slate gray in the skies, a stretch of inky black where a lake should be and pockets of light here and there from the homes and cars of night owls and vampires.
Lisbeth punched in
Sherlock slapped Dupin’s hand away then bolted from the car without another word.
He turned on the radio, twiddled with the old tuning dial. He grinned when he found a station playing Vivaldi’s
Mycroft had gritted his teeth, realizing that his dear old friend Heathcliff had sold them all out to Magnussen. Of all the people the Earl had to blab to, it had to be that bastard Magnussen.
Sherlock lowered the book and fixed his piercing eyes on Victor’s face. He lifted his black brows up high and gave Victor That Look.
, Violet wondered clinically,
He crept through the hallway on the balls of his feet, trying to make as little sound as possible while straining his ears. His heart was in his throat as he saw florescent light beaming from underneath the door at the end of the hall.
The dog whistle still hung around his neck on a fine chain. It was tempting … so tempting.
Intriguing.
Sunday afternoon
Mean, I know, but sadly Real Life is kidnapping me once again! But I'm going to be polishing up the last three chapters and cadogan is kicking ass and taking names while beta'ing so more story to come soon.
Sherlock snorted. “Oh, is that all? I’ll endeavor to do better.”
But when he asked, then demanded that a security guard accompany him, they flat out refused.
She turned to see him standing at the foot of the stairs. She opened to speak, then shook her head. She crooked her finger, signaling him to follow her up.
Violet had thought she wouldn’t be able to sleep in a stranger’s flat. After she had cleaned her teeth and peeled her dirty clothes off (except for her knickers and Sherlock’s good black dress shirt, which was now horribly crumpled,) she was out the minute her head hit Hugh Lestrade’s pillow. Then she woke up again when her prepaid mobile pinged.
She ordered herself.
Violet looked up, wide-eyed.
John’s heart had dropped, knowing damn well who the One Person was that Sherlock was talking about.
John blinked. All the rage drained away as his face slackened from shock. “What?”
Violet held up her mobile for Mary to read:
The morning guards, the young man with short black hair and beard as well as the young, tall and wide man were ruffians in their own rights. They were well-known members of the French organized criminal group, Milieu
Victor stared through him like he was scenery. A tree. A rock. Nothing important.
“Yes,” Violet massaged her forehead. “But I don’t have a lot to go on. I’m not Sherlock. I need more data to create a profile as well as a working hypothesis.”
She didn’t understand herself exactly why she lied. But her sharp survival instincts ordered her to keep quiet about how she knew about the Earl and what he had done to Sherlock. And Violet always followed her instincts.
Her left fingers felt cold and prickly, as if she had plunged her hand into a glass of ice water.
“Oh that would be wonderful if he did,” Greg sighed as he led Molly back to the sofa. They sank down on the sofa together. Greg turned the telly back off and Molly curled up in the crook of his arm, her arms protectively hugging her belly.
Sighing, he flipped his hand over and gingerly placed it in hers, palm facing up. But, when she started to gently massage his wrist and palm with her other hand, applying pressure with her thumb, he had to admit, it felt better.
“No,” he admitted, remembering Lestrade’s admonishments. “I had a bad night last night. Not a Danger Night,” he said quickly, “Just a bad night. But enough of that for now,” he put his arm back around Violet again. “It’s my turn to take care of you. I have not forgotten how you cared for me not just when I had bronchitis, but also while I was going through withdrawal after that hideous misadventure at the candy factory last spring.”
“It wasn’t.”
“It’s not nothing,” John said doggedly. “It’s not. Listen,” he took a step forward and removed the leaf from Sherlock’s hair. Twirled it in his hand for a moment as he gathered his thoughts, then he let the leaf go. The wind took it and both men watched the leaf spinning in the breeze as the wind pushed it through the London skies.
Thursday afternoon
But they were still in Suburbia and there were lights on in all the houses surrounding them. Nosy people with boring lives looked out of those open windows. Nosy people friendly with the Watsons, specifically with Mrs. Watson, John realized with a sinking chest.
“What?” she rasped.
“John, of course. And Marie, which means Peters knew. They used to be married.”
Clara gulped and looked at her expensive shoes.
Mary gave him a small smile and picked up the toxicology book she had been reading off and on since Sherlock returned from America and he from Germany. “While we were on a break, when you were with Dupin, I mean,” she added hastily, her cheeks reddening when she realized she needed to clarify
She hung up before she could say anything more.

really means.” Reluctantly she added, “I can stay through the night…”
“So, you had a glass of wine, on top of the drugs you already took,” Violet gently steered him back on track. “And you had lost count of how many pills you had already taken.”
“Here I thought you and Mrs. Watson are friends.”
”  The Midwestern girl snapped, heartily offended.
Violet’s brows knit together, trying to piece together why Lisbeth stared at her with such… pity.
“Everyone prefers the pretty lie to the ugly truth,” Dupin was unperturbed. “Do you think I enjoyed it when I was told I was ill and not physically but mentally? Sometimes I am still in denial about my hoarding, as you noticed with the soaps and shampoos. But the ugly truth is that I am a hoarder, Sherlock has untreated PTSD, Violet is dying, your wife is a murderer and you are in love with a man.”
Her handbag slipped from her fingers.
, which would have indicated which way the wind blew. “We confess to having grave concerns regarding your fitness to practice medicine, not only because of your lapse of judgment on the night of December 18, 2015 but also because of your hobby concerning the antics of one Mr. Sherlock Holmes, a self-described Consulting Detective who regularly risks his life as well the lives of others, including yourself, as evident during the day of January 13, 2016 when you were abducted and had been injured to the point where you required surgery and still are recovering physically.”
“Haven’t you been examining me all day?” Even though the linen nightgown was dreadfully priggish, neckline covering her collarbone, sleeves nearly to her wrists and the hem well below her knees, Violet felt more exposed than she would have if she had been starkers.
“Oh yes, I thought that much would have been obvious.”
“A murder already sanctioned by God and Country,” Sherlock refused to back down but he also knew he needed to confess. “And… my hand shook. I missed.”
He never in a million years thought he’d be quoting Sherlock.
Sherlock made sure to slam the door behind him.
“So you didn’t know that Dr. Watson had been abducted and brutally beaten, nearly died?”
“Christ, alright,” John snapped. His anger washed away from his face when he saw Violet. “Jesus, what the hell… OK, there’s too many people in here,” John tossed the cane out the door and awkwardly inched himself down onto the floor to examine Violet.
“Is that why she shot you in Magnussen’s office?”
Sherlock closed his eyes. The name had never been released to the media, for her protection, but Sherlock knew who she was before she identified herself.
But Mrs. Hudson still kept her chin stubbornly up. “Sherlock wouldn’t forgive me if anything happened to you. Go,” she tilted her head towards her door. “And I’ll see you Monday. We’re still going to your doctor’s appointment, young lady.”
Mary knew what desperate women were capable of doing.
John immediately texted back, which of course, set off the Sexy Moan Text Alert. As Violet picked up tea cups and grumbled obscenities under her breath, Sherlock read John’s reply:
Sherlock nodded his head, his lips a tight line. “I’m afraid so.”
“And you allow her to continue living here?”
John, like so many others, always underestimated Sherlock’s strength. However, John also knew the extent of Sherlock’s wounds after The Shooting and suspected many other injuries had taken their toll on the detective. He was rather surprised Sherlock’s strength had returned so relatively quickly. Or at least, Sherlock had regained strength enough to haul his sorry arse out of that bloody (literally bloody) warehouse and get them onto a main road.
“Frankie?”
Before John could protest further, Dupin said quietly to the young man, “Honoré, bring the car around, please.”
because they don’t have adequate protection.”
This subtle intimacy was
Sherlock had said when John had arrived at 221B with the stack of medical records for Lady Elise. John never really got a chance to grill Sherlock about what could be missing from these files. When Sherlock had gotten ill, John didn’t have the heart to ask. When Mary had started acting strangely, it had slipped John’s mind. Until Sherlock reminded him, advised him, actually. The night they had worked on repairing the air conditioner (which consisted of John watching Sherlock and handing him a tool when ordered to do so), Sherlock had recommended he read the files again at least as a distraction until Sherlock could speak to Violet about why she was helping Mary look for Maisie and get her to explain why they had been lying about that particular search.
“She also conned him into creating a trust fund for her niece, but yes, essentially.”
He felt quite proud of himself for finding his way back without getting lost. But the pride gave way to annoyance when he found that the argument between Sherlock and Gagnon still raged on… in French, of course.
Janine realized Miss Smith was right. She had allowed a fantasy ruin her life.
Of course the little psychopath had attached himself to Sherlock immediately.
“You would never allow Sherlock’s name to be sullied in a scandal like this. You’re too fond of him,” Mycroft found Violet’s pressure point and pushed back, just as hard.
“That is strange. Nobody talks to Mycroft. Not willingly.”
Just enough so her brain was a blank slate and she could start again from a fresh perspective…
“How’s John?” Mary clutched Sherlock’s damp suit jacket the minute she was alone with him.
?” he snapped as the green slush dribbled down his chin and throat as well as John’s arm.
I really do have the best readers and beta'ers ever! As usual, I'll respond to comments tomorrow.
“Your antibiotics, because of your spleen, or lack thereof.”
After Mary finished explaining exactly why she shot Sherlock, Violet had just sat stunned in the passenger seat of Mary’s car. “Jesus…” was all she had been able to manage. She blew out a long breath, her cheeks puffing out a bit as she did so. “Talk about a rock and a hard place.”
“No.”
But this man was
“Jesus, you really are vain, aren’t you?”
“That’s different,” she said immediately. “Of course I would respect that. After all, secrets and lies are the only things keeping me alive right now.”
not a permanent residence. There wasn’t even a proper bedroom. The bed, the chest of drawers, the sofa, the television, the computer desk, the kitchen table, the refrigerator, the oven and microwave were crammed into all in one square room. There wasn’t even a wardrobe, most of his clothes hung on a giant clothes rack at the end of the bed.
Violet picked up John’s pillow off the bed and screamed into it.
Nothing.
“Oh yeah, the more the merrier,” John groused. “And Sherlock would encourage her addictions, not dissuade her. I don’t think he’d be the best guest at an intervention.” He stood up and started clearing the table, “As if any of the interventions have ever worked.”
Sherlock decided to take the case. Decided to once again take on Moriarty’s network, better known as

“That won’t hold them off forever,” Mary whispered, clicking the light off again.
she thought as she applied mascara to her blonde eyelashes) and traveled the world. The usual spots a young woman would visit, South of France, Spain, Portugal, but then she went to Italy and the paper trail for Margaux Vos disappeared.
“I also think,” Mason looked around the pub before whispering to Donovan, “Based on what I’ve read and researched, I think you’re right about Miss Smith. She’s
“Worse than my brother?” Mycroft sneered. “There is no one worse than…” The cigarette fell out of Mycroft’s mouth. “Oh no. Not…”
As they say in America: shit just got real.
Finally, anything involving pain and bondage unsettled him. He could never bring himself to tie a woman up; especially after some of the more horrific cases he had worked on with Sherlock. He had also stubbornly refused to be the one bound. The idea of being rendered powerless like that threatened to trigger his post-traumatic stress disorder. Whenever fuzzy handcuffs or silken cords were introduced into the bedroom, he would go as limp as a wet dishrag.
He knew what was
“I should go with him,” John looked down the alley where Sherlock had stalked off.
But Josie continued to shake her head. “No… I just need to tell Stroper and she’ll put the client on the Black List so they won’t be allowed to do business with us anymore…” She made a move to slide out of the small booth she and Mary occupied.
Violet and John exchanged confused looks just as there was a tap on the door. “Yoo-hoo, Sherlock?”
“You do, Brother Mine.”
“Um… no.”
“Hey,” Mary kept her back to him as she pulled dirty clothes out of the hamper.
Carefully, as if it were made from crystal and glass instead of wood and wire, he lifted his glossy violin from its case. He swung it up and around resting it lightly on his shoulder, then lowered his chin to the black chin-rest. He took a breath then without another word, touched the bow to the strings.
“No, it is most emphatically not his wife,” Dupin chuckled. “Nor his feckless lover, Lord Alfred Douglas,” he paused to take off his sunglasses. Again, John was taken by how bright and green his eyes were. “But his best friend, Robbie Ross,” Dupin looked up at the monument. “Best friend and lover. Loyal to the end.”
“I can knock that pea-shooter out of your little hands,” he sneered.
“Wait, I-” Sherlock barely remembered to support the baby’s floppy head before Mrs. Holmes stood up. He could feel Molly’s eyes boring into him so he stammered, “Maybe Molly should...”
But the dark creatures always swam below the surface, didn’t they?
“Oh God,” Sherlock grumbled as Gladstone flopped his big furry head on his belly.
She kept her mind occupied with her work, her church, her dog and her hobbies, most of them centering on her cottage. Most of the work on her cottage she was proud to say she did herself. True, she had to hire out some of the bigger jobs to contractors, such as the roof and the kitchen floor. However, she sanded the shitty olive-green paint off the woodwork herself and planned to stain it a rich walnut colour once the sanding was done. She also mended and painted the white picket fence that followed the stone path to the sea. She did her own digging and weeding in her gardens. Her hands were rough and calloused now and she loved it. She never did her nails anymore.
The door was open. There was a dim light glowing from within.
“Shhh, not so loud!”
Lisbeth put her feet on the dash and took a pack of Marlboro Reds out of the pocket of her leather jacket. Violet opened her mouth to yell at her not to light it, but she merely drew out a cigarette and twirled it in her small fingers. Violet shut her mouth, drawing back, deducing that Lisbeth was just as nervous as she was.
Eight years ago, Violet would have never dreamt of taking a life unless she absolutely had no choice.
“You already are, Violet.”
“Asleep, at last,” she sighed. “Now I can get some work done.”
Until Christmas, the ultimate Christmas-from-Hell. The Christmas of The Second Shooting.
“Oh,” Georgina flustered as a natural blush appeared underneath her rouge. “Yes, I suppose I do have to disclose that… err, yes, well a man died here. Murdered, actually,” she finished in a small voice of a woman who had had to repeat those words with the same results afterwards: the loss of a tidy commission.
8 August 2015
He had grimaced then spit the liquid back into the dainty cup. “Happy Christmas,” he had smiled at Mycroft with unblinking eyes.
He felt an itchy, uncomfortable ache in his chest. Not heartburn (they had ordered Thai take-away for dinner and Sherlock liked
“The whole while, I played the devoted daughter. I acted like I idolized him. I acted like his designs were  the best in the world. Although as much as it pains me to admit it, without him, I would not have the career I have today, being a talent agent. I learned at my father’s knee how the fashion and acting industries really work, the ugly underbelly. As much as I hate him, he did show me how to make a living.”
“What about Watson?” James asked.
“I’m hardly a celebrity, Mrs. Fowler,” Sherlock demurred.
“Will, what’s with the baby talk?” Mycroft hated how William’s speech patterns had started regressing, when he actually spoke that was. Nowadays, he was so quiet around the adults, Mycroft wanted to scream at his parents to notice that something was terribly wrong with their youngest child. He resented taking on the role his parents should be playing. But his parents were too busy trying to rebuild and secure their financial future. If they were all thrown into the street, then there would be no way to help William at all.
“Not really. It makes Christmases easier to bear when I don’t have to tell Mummy that you are no longer amongst the land of the living.”
Chapter Twenty-two: Middlegame
“I bet you were really something when you were in your prime. A true beauty in your youth.”
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood made a shuddery exhalation of relief. Secretary Trelawney-Hope mopped his brow with a handkerchief. The other men and women in the room, all clad in dark suits, also acted profoundly relieved, as if a nuclear strike had been averted. “Thank God,” one man actually said aloud.
“Bad,” Alex never minced words and today was not the day she was about to start.
moved me truth be told. It is rather gratifying to have people actually being concerned about my welfare, even though Violet’s concern is tinged slightly with selfish reasons as I am her cover story while she remains in hiding in England. But you, uh,” Sherlock faltered. “Yes, err… you
Mycroft again emitted a dry chuckle. “Dr. Watson, you sound surprised. How many honest women do you actually know?”
John, recalling all the times Sherlock had to be fished out of the Thames plus all the other gruesome stains the Belstaff had acquired over the years, grumbled, “Coat’s been through worse than a bit of dirty water.”
“Already on it,” Sherlock fished out his mobile, “As I said, I haven’t cracked the code, not yet. I haven’t cracked it, because I have an expert working on it.”
When his mobile pinged across town, he and John were actually enjoying the breakfast buffet at their hotel. Dupin fished his prepaid mobile out of the pocket of his black jeans. His salt-and-pepper brows rose. Keeping his face impassive, he sent a terse text to Bill Wiggins and Trinity, warning them they were compromised.
Sherlock considered Lisbeth and Trinity his bishops. Just as bishops had no restrictions of distance on the chessboard, Lisbeth and Trinity knew no limitations on the Internet. They knew things about cyberspace that made even Sherlock’s head spin. With their laptops, they could travel to far-off destinations without ever leaving the sofa.
“Sherlock?”
“Do so. That’s why I’ve always gained a stone before you have a job interview or a final exam back when we were in uni.”
, Violet groaned to herself. After shooting the doctor another cagey glance, she quickly thumbed a response to Mary.
“Quite so,” Sherlock agreed amicably enough as he tented his fingers, tapping them together. “You don’t have a daily reminder that Jordan didn’t choose to abandon you and before you remind me that John thought I was dead, well… he hadn’t wed Mary yet when I returned from the Great Hiatus. Only when it’s too late, when I made the conscious choice to stop behaving like a complete moron and start living my life instead of existing in some sort of suspended animation, then he decides to come out of the closet.” Spying her shoulders starting to droop, he cautiously pressed his hand over her knee as she continued to hold her paper coffee cup in a death grip. “During your extensive research and during the months that you have lived with me, do I strike you as a man who is weak-willed and easily swayed?”
shut off.
“Why? Do you know how long it took me to perfect this voice?” Miss Smith carded her fingers through her hair. “Did you ever deduce who I modeled my Miss Smith voice after?”
But to be ordered to kill… well, it was unsettling.
, John remembered with a jolt.
Tears had been shed, of course. Mary had endured her ordeal stoically until John had tapped on her door and slipped into her room. Only  seeing his pale face and hearing him whisper, “Oh Mary, I’m so sorry,” could have made her fall completely apart. The tears, the pain she had been holding in were unleashed by the relief she felt for seeing that her husband was still alive and by the grief for the son and daughter they had lost.
“I don’t think it comes easy for either one of them,” Molly said. “You shouldn’t compare yourself to John and Greg, Sherlock. There’s no scientific formula for being a good person. We all just kind of fumble around, hoping that we’re getting it right,” she ran her hand down her belly again. “That doesn’t mean we don’t make the best choices all the time either.”
“A bullet through the chest would be far more merciful, trust me.”
Sherlock forced himself get up at a decent hour because he knew traffic would be shit as the fools would flock to churches, cemeteries and Whitehall to venerate the glorious dead.
“Please don’t do this,” Mary grabbed his shoulder, her fingers clawing the plaid fabric of his button-down in a death grip.
“Clever, marrying into the Holmes family, wealthy, aristocratic and powerful, not to mention famous,” the Professor nodded as if Violet hadn’t spoken. “Marrying for position has always been more practical than marrying for love. You just made one tiny mistake,” he held up his pointer finger then pointed it at her. “You married into the wrong family.”
“But why are they targeting Henry?” Mary screwed up her face in confusion.
in the crooks in his elbows. The need, the want…
As Violet sat down, Sherlock added “And whatever you and Mary are planning on doing this evening, please do not get caught.”
“I swear to God, I had nothing to do with any of that… that… stuff on my mobile. I knew Jimsie was bad, I didn’t know he was that bad, honest. Please believe me.”
Metal shelves and white boxes with small, colorful emblems. Sherlock bit the inside of his lip when he recognized the American “Hazardous Medical Waste” symbols.
“Here,” Mary quickly set down the mugs, not even bothering with coasters. “Let me.”
Sherlock and Violet exchanged a look and had a silent conversation only detectives could have.
“FINE,” Sherlock held the violin and bow at his sides. “I am to be polite no matter how annoying people are. I am to only indulge in one glass of champagne as it goes straight to my head. I need to call Lestrade
“Enjoy it, you deserve it,” John softly snickered as he reached into his coat pocket, cursing as he always did whenever he had to use his right hand. “Here,” he slipped a damp sponge underneath the covers. “Use a glass of water to re-wet it if necessary. But dab your face with it and your hands so it looks like you broke out in a sweat.”
Lucy laughed and started slapping the soapy water.
“But water can wear a rock down after enough time,” Violet bit her lip, looking into her mug. Then she cleared her throat. “Just so you know… if you and Victor… um, I just want you to know that I don’t want to be an obstacle if you and Victor find that you two still… that you two want to… try again. To be…” she shrugged. “I would just ask that you help me get back to America faster if you and Victor reunite, that’s all. Or, at the least, out of England, I can manage on my own if I could just get away from Mycroft.”
Suddenly, Dupin’s words echoed in John’s ears…
“That’s not Christianity,” John said quietly, “To beat your child almost to death.”
“Just as long as we’re on the same page,” Violet said lightly. “Speaking of prying into people’s private lives…”
“No. You’re not.”
“But she didn’t.”
A deeper and darker secret was that Sherlock had been one of the Earl’s first victims.
4:55 AM Paris time
Mycroft watched the bird fly around above them. “It was you,” he said softly. “You’re the one who’s been buggering those boys at school. You…” his voice trailed off but when he spoke again, there was a frost in his voice that had never been there before, “Bastard.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” John promised, awkwardly shoving his cup into the bin as well.
“John,” Sherlock sat at John’s feet, cross-legged. Staring up at him, Sherlock asked in a quiet, serious voice: “What can I do? What do you want?”
“It was awful, so awful,” he admitted, trying not to spill his coffee as he hugged her back. “The weather was terrible. It was freezing rain the entire time. None of his friends came and it was just so
As he stretched his back and viewed the Thames River glittering below him and the Tower Bridge just barely visible in the distance, he allowed himself a moment of weakness. He rested his arm high on the glass window then rested his forehead against his forearm. He let go of a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding until now.
… she flicked her eyes at Sherlock quickly before reverting all of her attention back to Josie, who was still talking:
John obeyed then let loose a shaky exhalation at Mary’s instruction. “Hurts…”
Violet unclasped the leash and Gladstone made a beeline for John, nuzzling his hand. “Hey, boy, how are you?” he ran his hand over the dog’s sleek head.
“Not who, what,” Honoré explained over the hum of the generator. “That’s the task force patrolling the catacombs and I’m not talking about cops. Didn’t you see the warning on the Croix station sign?”
“Why?”
Back and forth through my mind
She texted him back:
Meanwhile John spat out what he had just seen “There was a
Jack felt his chest expand with pride while his heart broke just a little at the same time. That inevitable surge of mixed emotions parents feel when they realize their child is in fact, growing up. So he smiled at his son and said quite seriously “If that’s what you prefer, we can call you that… John. And it doesn’t hurt our feelings a bit. It’s the name we picked out for you, innit? On your birth certificate, innit?”
“Dunno, c’mon, doc,” Wiggins started to say, but then John gasped when he heard Violet and Rucastle’s voices, then saw their outlines as Rucastle lead Violet into the boathouse. John swung around on his crutches, ignoring the ache in his upper arm where the bull mastiff had bitten him. But Wiggins grabbed him by the shoulders just as John was about to hobble down the hill. “Don’t man,” Wiggins put the gun down on one of the patio tables. He blocked John by grabbing him by the shoulders. “We’ve all got our jobs. Miss Smith seems like she can take care of herself. That girl, that Evie-girl? She’s who needs us. She’s barely a grown-up and she’s in the shit and she needs us. I know you’re worried about your mate’s bird, but we gotta go, doc. Before that tub of guts sees us, OK?” Panicked, Wiggins looked over his shoulder as Violet and Rucastle seemed to be in some sort of argument. “Doc, d’you hear me? Miss Smith’s got this, Shezza said she’s carrying, so
The Professor sighed, hiking up his trousers a bit before standing. He groaned a little as his back popped. “I’m not as young as I used to be.” He straightened fully. “I only kept Susan hostage in order to assure my safety. Once I am away, Susan and her little friend will no longer be in harm’s way. Oh, and I’ll send over one of my personal cleaners to handle, well…” he waved his hands towards the bloody wall and Peters’ corpse. “No matter what you decide, if you decide to join the winning team or if you decide to sink with the Titanic,” he signed mightily as he straightened his tie. “The only flaw you really have, John Watson, is your ridiculous loyalty.”
“I got better,” Violet had said blithely, trying not to gag. Mrs. Toller’s perfume was as cloying as ever. “Anyway,” Violet held the list up again, “The shopping.”
“We’re well aware of what kind of man we’re dealing with, Mr. Holmes,” Gregson said crisply. “You’re a civilian, so you stay put and don’t argue with me. I know who your brother is. He gave me express orders that you stay well away from Moriarty. As for you,” he gave Lestrade a pointed look, “Go help with crowd control.”
Honoré nodded and finally left John in peace.
she thought as she rubbed her belly again.
“No, we’re not married to each… that is, well, we’re partners but…
about it, of course.”
Voices, indecipherable to be sure, but definitely two voices echoing from the direction Honoré wanted to take them.
After he had announced that that they had to rescue Mitton tomorrow, Sherlock had gone back to Violet’s studio. Violet had argued to come with him but hadn’t really put much effort into her argument. However, when Sherlock informed her that the blond, muscled Bevington and the short, beefy Stirmon would be accompanying him back to her old studio, she had wearily relented. Her greatest concern had been Sherlock’s safety and the two bikers would be more than adequate bodyguards.
She dashed upstairs to change out of her scrubs into her AGRA clothes.
, he deduced.
John never told Mary his theory about Violet having ALS. Mostly because he was in denial, he
“Well,” she wheezed, the Scottish burr still faintly audible in her weak voice. “At least it’ll be quick. There’s that.” John felt his lower lip quiver and before he could hide it, his mother admonished him. “And there’ll be none of that. No tears. I won’t…” she closed her eyes, taking minute to catch her breath. “Waste what time God gave me on tears.” She reached up and patted her son on the cheek. “Do you hear me?” When John pressed his lips together and nodded, Anna smiled fondly at him, “That’s a good lad.” Her eyelids fluttered shut. The brief conversation had already worn her out. But she mumbled, “Go find your sister. I’m sure she’s carrying on like the bloody drama queen she is.”
“This,” Sherlock uncrossed his legs and all but vaulted off the bed, “Is
“Oh yes, I really was,” Edward beamed. “Daddy, Miss Smith said if it’s OK with you and if I continue being good, she could take me on an adventure Friday afternoon, oh Daddy, can I?”
“Why?” Sherlock turned around, his face confused.
PS: I don't HATE the now-canon name for Baby Watson... but I confess, I don't love it either :^/
“Ohhh, John,” Sherlock gasped in wonder. “John,
Dimmock did not know how correct he was. Violet, of course, was no ordinary woman.
John had dozed fitfully throughout the afternoon. It had been Wiggins who gently shook him awake so they could drink more water and gobble down a meager supper. They had turned on their mobiles. There had been no texts from Sherlock. Neither one of them had been able to decide if they were relieved or concerned, because “No news’ good news, right?” Wiggins had given John a toothy nervous smile.
John Watson cracked open an eye.
“Yes,” he nodded. “I think the time is right. He and Mary are in a good place right now. You have begun patching things up with Mary as well, so yes, I will tell John. I think he’ll be pleased, although I’ll have to endure a month of ‘I told you so’s’. He’s been accusing me of fancying you for ages now.”
After Violet informed Sherlock Molly would murder them for being late, he absently murmured as he thumbed through his Smartphone, looking for a particular app, “Do calm down, my dear Violet. Molly will not kill us both.”
, Sherlock’s shagged everyone from John to Magnussen’s PA to Violet’s
“… I told her not to open it, but I wasn’t fast enough. She opened the lid, screamed bloody murder. I looked into the cool box, saw what it was. Then I chivvied Susie out of the kitchen and rang John.” Bitterly she added, “Then you when he didn’t pick up.”
“Didn’t even have the good sense to blackmail them then?” Sherlock asked sweetly.
“I cannot deny you have valid points,” Mycroft grizzled. “I need time to think about it.”
His other eye was still swollen but he managed to open it to just a slit.
Mary felt a stinging pain in her belly.
“How many times do we need to see this? There’s another video to watch yet.”
But the trail of pink rose petals leading to a winding staircase was a helpful clue.
Flipping the memory stick over in his fingers, he realized he could save John if Mycroft took him. Might have to leave Mary behind to do so… but Mary would want him to save John even if it meant leaving her to die in a prison cell… or worse.
easy to manipulate once you find the pressure points. Loneliness. Boredom,” she gave John a pointed glare, “Rejection.”
She kept her back as close to the wall as possible as she wound her way up the twisting staircase, straining her ears to hear. Over and over, she told herself
“So, that nutter’s been put on the Black List and he’s not allowed to use their services anymore, right?” Evie pressed on.
“Of course we are. We’re legally her parents now. It would be no different if we had conceived Lucy and you had given birth and then we decided to move to Australia.” Seeing her doubt, he hastily added, “I’ll check with an attorney, naturally but Lucy is ours. If we choose to take her to Australia with us, we can.”
“Fuckin’ sucks,” Wiggins said as he extended an envelope of money under the table towards Collins. “Gonna to need to call my sponsor after this. Really wanna use right now, can’t fuckin’ lie,” he laughed weakly.
“Yes,” Sherlock gritted his teeth. It had been highly annoying not having John present for that case, although Violet had proved once again she was a capable investigator.
“Christ, what a cunt,” Victor said to the empty room.
“Short stories are still important stories,” Sherlock said gruffly. “And your story is not over. You still have chapters to go. Think about that when you can’t get out of bed.”
was just pissed ‘cause I had a job and he didn’t.” Her shoulders shook and her lips turned white with her efforts not to cry in a nice store. “The bugger probably sold it anyway.”
2:21 PM
“Wrong,” Sherlock droned and he quickly told her what John had discovered.
He knew how to please women… most of the time. He had no idea how to satisfy a man… especially a man like Sherlock Holmes… brilliant and damaged.
“Yes and in the leg too, how inconvenient at this very moment,” Sherlock grabbed her underneath her armpits and threw her over his shoulder like the proverbial sack of potatoes.
“Oh, yes, of course, how rude,” Dupin tucked the pack back into his coat. “Apologies, Dr. Watson. I don’t have many vices in life. Sadly, cigarettes are still one of them.” He put the van in gear and merged into traffic that made London rush hour feel like a nice Sunday drive in the country.
“You knew what Sherlock was planning that night,” John said slowly.
. The brother that went away and left Sherlock with the hateful brother who stayed.
“OK, I’m not, but he texted me. Told me to fetch you, said you’d be here.” A crooked smile appeared on his long face, “Said you ran away from home.”
John’s brow furrowed, “Safe against, what, exactly?”
Sherlock had then slipped back up her room, where police officers had already started cataloguing all the drugs, the legal prescription drugs and the illegal street drugs they found in her lavish and opulent bedroom.
“Yes.”
“How do we know you’re telling the truth?” Lestrade decided to continue acting like an idiot, apparently. “How do we know you’re not making this entire thing up?”
“Ah, that’s cheating,” John grinned.
Once John had shut the door, Lestrade put his hands on his hips and leaned towards Sherlock. “I know who the father is, Sherlock,” he said quietly. “Molly told me.”
Dazed, heart pounding, she sat up slowly. She swiveled her head around, taking in the faded velvet chairs and strange looking pieces of equipment, ancient scientific gear from the looks of it. The tables, bookshelves and chairs were all made from wood and all covered with dust. The bright reds and blues that had disorientated Violet came from the wallpaper. It was so gaudy, it made the garish wallpaper in 221B Baker Street look positively plain. Heavy chintz drapes covered the windows. In juxtaposition with the wooden furniture, thick metallic beams jutted out here and there from floor to ceiling, like support beams of a very old skyscraper.
“Hello, Harry,” Clara tried for a smile.
She studied the doctor, trying to focus. Her head still ached badly and her legs still felt unsteady, that awful prickly “fallen asleep” feeling. In spite of this, Violet stared at the physician, trying to gather as much information about him as her muddled brain would allow.
Mary had responded with a simple “OK” and “XOXO” then tossed her mobile back into her handbag. Then she had to scamper off to assist suturing up the forehead of a two-year-old who fell out of the cot she had been trying to climb out of in a poorly executed escape attempt.
Both he and John whipped their heads around as the growling got progressively louder.
“Knew what?”
“Hm?”
“Heavenly,” he thumbed the bit of cream off of her lip then bent down for a proper kiss. “Does it make me a bad friend to be glad pudding was interrupted so there’s more cake for me?”
“Yeah, that’d be him,” Lestrade sighed. “How many nurses did he make cry?”
Violet maneuvered through the foot traffic with a little more finesse than Moriarty. All the aches and pains and fatigue of the past few weeks evaporated as adrenaline flooded her body. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw an ambulance whizz past, the sirens at full volume, wailing.
“Mary?” John circled the bed, stood directly opposite of Violet and took Mary’s other hand.
His friend was up to something… kind.
do that again. But I also don’t want to live in a world where you’ve been hurt or damaged in any way because of me.”
Violet stared at him uncomprehendingly. Then she poured the rest of the whiskey in the tumbler.
Comments make me happy... thanks for reading! :^)
“Oh, well, I should have waited five more seconds then.”
So... I didn't conjure the son of Sherlock (or the nickname 'Raffles')  completely out of thin air... there's actual canon (albeit non-ACD) for the existence of this version of Sherlock Jr.:
“No, there’s a footpath that leads up to the deck and the pool. That’s how Sherlock and I got down here this morning. I’ll be fine,” John grumbled. Then he suddenly said “Bill,
But Rucastle applauded. “Wonderful. Wonderful. Although I would like to think I would spot a faked accent if I heard one.”
as well as for us, I’m afraid.”
Meanwhile Violet’s thoughts were a bit less elegant.
“And that is?” John found his patience thinning. He now wished Violet could be there now, to act as a buffer between him and Sherlock.
Wait for Mary to either kill Sherlock or get him killed?
25 April 2016
The Earl’s preference for young boys was a very deep and very dirty secret.
Both John and Sherlock hid their smirks. Finally Violet had a solid excuse to duck out of tea.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “Really? You honestly want to quibble about that now?”
“Most likely.”
“I’m supposed to trust you but you pounce on John the first chance you g-”
Even so, he took his time, looking left to right, making sure no nosy neighbors were up and about, looking out windows or taking their dogs out for a late night stroll. It was imperative there were no witnesses.
Even though Violet was supposed to take little Edward out for his “Morning Constitution”, Violet informed Mrs. Toller during breakfast it was already far too hot to take a little boy and a little dog out for a walk. Much better to stay indoors today.
“Shit, shit, shit!” Violet panted, feeling ocean water soaking the back of her legs.
her right hand
He silently asked her about her conversation with Mary.
between us,” she spat at him.
“Just bring the pup here, Mrs. Toller,” Rucastle said with an air of great weariness.
Before Molly could say anything more, Mrs. Holmes and Mrs. Hooper returned to the lounge. “Now,” Mrs. Holmes sat down on an armchair. “I want you ladies to tell me every embarrassing story about my boy that you know and I will tell you all the embarrassing stories about him when he was young.”
6:50 PM
“She was being blackmailed, just as John said,” Dupin took a swig of cold coffee then pulled a face of disgust.
Molly vainly tried to smooth things over, “Oh, Nat, Lily’s just fine, truly, I don’t mind. Uh… well, Violet, this is Natalie, we’ve been friends since primary school,” Molly made introductions. “Natalie, this is Violet, Sherlock’s girlfriend.”
“Are you sure you want to drive that long?” John immediately felt guilty for not being able to split up the driving duties.
“Clearly,” Mycroft’s voice now matched his face.
“Then we send out a mass text alert to your Militia,” Sherlock murmured. “Include a screenshot of the video, so they can see what they look like, what they are wearing. Have them follow.” Then an evil little smile crossed his face, “But that won’t be necessary. Walking out the front door, they are. And people say
“Yes,” Violet and Sherlock said in unison. Sherlock then sniffed, “Obviously” and Violet added, “Fits the profile. To him, people are tools, but in his mind, men are recyclable, women, disposable. Once he’s done with a female, he has no further use for her. Molly Hooper and Irene Adler are prime examples of his misogyny. Twins though, I missed that. I thought maybe he had split-personality or something…”
“Explain,” Sherlock looked more like a benevolent schoolmaster than an impatient detective.
“Noon,” Mycroft said silkily. “Oh, Sherlock, one more thing?”
After three nights in the cramped space, Greg and Molly decided it was time to go.
Monday morning
“Great to see you too, Hope,” Anthea said in a perfectly bland American accent. She took off the pink knitted cap off of the roly-poly girl’s head and fluffed the wispy blond curls. “Here she is.”
“Charming,” John grumbled, not sure if he liked “Marie” or not.
Papa Bella immediately waved that away. “No, you go home, you’ve done enough. We can find someone else to nurse the Reverend. You need rest up before my grandson is born.”
John risked a quick look at Violet again.
fucking
Violet couldn’t help but think.
And, God forbid, even if things with Mary still became a complete shambles, he wouldn’t hole himself up in 221B to wallow in self-pity. Guiltily, he realized he could have gone back to Mary about a month or so after Sherlock had been released from hospital after the First Shooting. He really hadn’t needed John to stay with him for those six months.

He knocked, expecting to hear Gladstone frantically barking… or snarling as the dog despised him. When there was no canine answer, he let himself in.
Three pairs of eyes locked onto Molly, who looked mortified.
“Try to impress on him how important it is for him to
Sherlock grabbed the car door. John barely got inside the idling vehicle before Sherlock slammed the door shut. “My contact will handle the issue of the pictures once the files have been received. Best you don’t know anything more regarding that. And won’t. The information will be sent directly to me via secure channels.”
“Christ, I don’t give a shit about being the bad guy or the bloody tabloids,” John groaned. “Listen to me, I meant every word I said to you at the pub after Harry’s funeral. I would
“Mary would probably like to see you,” there was ice in every single syllable of Sherlock’s sentence as he unrolled his shirt-sleeves. “I popped in on her before coming down here. She’s anxious to go home. The doctors are thinking about discharging her tomorrow.”
“We won’t rest until we bring her home,” Violet added, still not looking at Mary.
John decided that keeping his face neutral would be too much of a give-away so he allowed himself to get pissed off. “Of all the stupid things to say, Mycroft.”
“A personal mystery? A case of her own, how…how can you be sure?”
Her hands curled around the rails, the wind ruffling her curls. “It’s finally cooling off,” she tilted her head up towards the skies, still enraptured as lightening now properly streaked the sky in silver jagged lines, cutting through the black and amethyst night. “I bet the water feels amazing right now. Not going to lie, I wasn’t thrilled to be on a houseboat. Haven’t been a fan of water since Jack Woodley water-boarded me… but now… it just seems so…” She let go of the rails and leaned over as she stared off at the gathering storm. “Maybe drifting away in the midst of a squall would be less painful than suffocating on my own phlegm.”
“Very well, thank you,” Sherlock stood in front of the bar man, who was a half a foot taller than he and three times heavier, but had not an ounce of superfluous flesh. Abrahams was larger than even American footballers and  many of those brutes looked terrifying, even out of their ridiculous padding and helmets. He also had a variety of tattoos on his neck, face and knuckles, none of which indicated that he was a cheerful chap who liked kittens and warm hugs.
Everything had gone without a hitch ever since they had left Daytona Beach. Once they had arrived in Miami, they checked into a Best Western near the airport under yet another one of Lisbeth’s aliases. Then they went to a TGI Friday’s, where Mitton gorged himself on Loaded Potato Skins, Buffalo Wings, Chicken Tostada Nachos and a sundry of other greasy appetizers, washing it all down with Guinness.
. “What is it, Alby?” she crooned as she picked up her glass of chardonnay and hefted herself off her sofa. She padded over to the scrubbed table where her mobile lay next to paint cans and a bag of potting soil.
5:27 PM
Of course, the old duffers thought Two-for -One was just grand.
She felt like a trapped animal. A fox in a snare.
“Oh, my poor boy,” Mrs. Holmes tut-tutted. If her hands weren’t full, Sherlock knew she would have pressed her hand to his brow. “You work too hard,” she scolded him.
“Victor,” Sherlock broke away just as Victor’s lips found his again. Sherlock took two steps back, shaking his head, buttoning his shirt up again. Tucking the tails of his shirt in, he said “I will not permit you to use me to cheat on your wife.” He re-fastened his belt buckle, took another step away from Victor then lowered himself into his chair again, like a disapproving king.
“Don’t,” Mary continued to speak in Russian, “Don’t try to use my husband to manipulate me. This woman,” Mary took her gun out and pointed it at Anthea, who started struggling against her bonds, “Murdered that nurse in cold blood to cover up my daughter’s abduction. She had her phone lines tapped. She overheard her telephone conversation to Maggie Jenner that she had evidence to prove my daughter was abducted. The punch-line to this joke?” Mary lowered her gun. “The punch-line is there was no evidence. Jennifer was acting on a pure hunch. After Jennifer was killed, her good friend Maggie Jenner went to her flat to look for the proof.
Chapter Twenty-five:
She also hoped she was the only one smelling what could be described as turned meat.
“Feels a bit personal.”
She was also not British.
“Case, what case? Violet,” he grabbed her arm, raising his eyebrows. “
“I killed Sebastian Moran to save your ass,” she gritted her teeth. “Two were in self-defense. The others…”
“Anthea,” she corrected him.
“Oh, well, that’s no fun,” she grinned as she found herself back in his arms.
“I can’t stay here, I have to keep moving. Do you think I found all that out without pissing some people off? My life won’t be worth shit once
“I say, William Holmes, is that you?”
“What’s happening?” Wiggins asked warily as Mitty took a long drink of beer. “I keep hearing chatter but nobody can confirm shit.”
Meanwhile, Lisbeth had been passing out coffee. “We rescued you from an unsanctioned black site where psychotropic drugs were being tested on human subjects.”
“Thank God,” Sherlock turning away from Victor.
Sherlock swallowed down how deeply that offhand comment cut him.
Holy Peters held up his Smartphone. “No point in threatening your wife, she’s out of commission.  Nobody can find your kid, so no point in threatening her. So we’ll just threaten
“She is a nice girl,” Sherlock agreed, “Not very bright, but pleasant.”
Happy post-Christmas!
“I thought John would keep Sherlock and Greg in line?” Molly scowled.
“I thought she was
Violet put her fork down. A smile turned up on her lips, one of her genuine smiles, one that transformed her ordinary prettiness into something akin to beauty.
Violet reminded herself as she opened the second text message.
“Right, OK, so my friends call me Bill. You must be Shezza’s bird, Viola.”
Camden Town
Or rather, he saw the back of her white T-shirt now completely drenched with blood. Sherlock realized this as well, removing his hand from her back, staring at the blood on his palm.
All he saw was the battlefields.
“My name is Detective-Inspector Lestrade,” Lestrade hastily produced his badge. “There’s nothing to worry about. We’re working on a tip regarding a missing person that led us out here. We’d just like to ask just a few questions and we’ll be on our way.”
“You didn’t check first  whether or not there was a GPS locator on this car?” Violet cried out, “Mary, what the literal hell?”
“Well, that’s not very cheerful,” Mary joked weakly.
…unless little Master Henry Lestrade shows promise later on down the road…
So, to avoid the nasty snowy weather of the East and Midwest, they took I-40 through Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and finally Nevada. Culture shock finally hit Violet when they drove through McDonalds or stopped at a truck stop. The portion sizes appalled her. After experiencing English chips, McDonald’s fries tasted over-salted and saturated in grease. At the same time, she remembered how much she had loved Southern sweet tea, fluffy buttermilk pancakes drowned in maple syrup and crispy hash browns smothered with cheese. She indulged when they stopped at a Waffle House in Oklahoma City.
“Have you been taking notes from John about how to puke out purple prose?” Violet dryly asked but she started to brush her hair again, more gently this time.
“You alright?” Alex asked.
“No! Of course, I don’t want to die! If I did, I would have let Jack Woodley kill me the way he killed the rest of my team! But I have always been
After Mary promised to come back tomorrow to help Sherlock mop up the blood, John and Mary took Lestrade home. Susan tried not to nod off in the back seat, still wrapped up in Sherlock’s dressing gown. But she fell asleep anyway, right on Lestrade’s shoulder.
“Mr. Trevor,” Violet inclined her head, like she had last night, only far more formally, not just a brief nod. As if she really was royalty, the bloody Queen of England herself.
John’s desertion was far, far more painful. He actually
“Obviously,” Sherlock huffed as he brushed his lips against John’s.
“Never mind,” John leaned his head against the wall as the lift doors.
John snorted then said, “Stop being a brat, Sherlock. Who knows? Maybe you can learn something from him.”
John opened his mouth to call Sherlock’s name again, but stopped. He frowned, taking in the scene. He knew when Sherlock sat still and silent like this, he was deep into his “Mind Palace” so John had a minute to observe the odd scene.
“But you did murder Jack Woodley. Were you planning on disclosing that when you turned state’s evidence? That you killed him in cold blood and not self-defense.”
“Violet Smith,” Donovan murmured, her finger pressed down on the old picture of Lestrade.
“And I’ll be driving you to your appointment Monday, I insist. Or rather, Sherlock insists.”
“And you couldn’t have known, what was going to happen that day,” Jack strove to reassure his son, to absolve him of any guilt he may have still felt. “No one can predict the future, yeah?”
Green crouched over Mitton, keeping an eye on him. “Told you that wasn’t a good idea,” he informed Trager.
Fowler & Fowler Talent Agency
“That’s not what I’m asking you to do, I…” Victor made a guttural sound of frustration and ran his fingers through his golden hair. “Sherlock,” he said slowly and calmly. “I don’t want to blackmail Patricia. But your mind works in ways I can’t even comprehend. Surely, you can figure out a way I can end this marriage without complete financial ruin or emotional damage done to my daughter. I don’t want this to get ugly and her parents would make sure it got ugly. They’re the ones who shoved that lawyer down our throats in the first place,” he added bitterly.
“Err, yes…but I didn’t mention
“Then that’s that. Sherlock’s decided he doesn’t want to prosecute her. It’s his choice, not yours. So you need to leave. My. Wife. Alone.” Every word of John’s had been clipped and cold.
“So what am I supposed to do? Just sit with my thumb up my arse?”
They would never be best friends. Probably wouldn’t even send each other Christmas cards.
“I’m not gay,” John responded automatically.
, he thought. As John struggled for a safe, banal topic to discuss but was saved by Mr. Holmes opening the door once more, admitting Lestrade and Molly… and Henry.
She arched her eyebrow at him “Profiler,” she reminded him as she left to answer the door.
“Do you think I would have made it this far if I wasn’t a good actress?” Violet still sounded bitter. “I should have realized that if Mycroft believed that I’d screw Sherlock over, then you would too,” But when John approached her to help her to her feet, she gave him a cold smile, “John, I know you’re sorry, but I really don’t want you touching me right now.”
You can tell me what happened to
Since she knew Toller was a suspected accomplice to the Burned Girls case, Violet worried about Toller abusing the boy if left alone with him. However, that didn’t fit Toller’s profile. He had no history of child abuse and also Edward was the apple of Rucastle’s eye. If Toller or anyone else had laid a finger on the child, Violet strongly suspected that individual would no longer be breathing…

“Yep.”
I guess that's why this fandom is amazing... we all really do look out for each other :^)
“Romantic?” now John sounded puzzled. Then stammered out: “Oh, no. No, no…Not partner like

They also didn’t speak Swedish or Norwegian, so Lisbeth was no help either.

And still, no babies.

“Thanks Alex,” Lestrade grinned but Alex was already out the door.
After Sherlock, Stirmon and Bevington had returned from Violet’s Chinatown studio, and everyone had stayed up late, strategizing. Then the Sons returned to their budget motel and the Devil’s Foot to their homes for some much-needed shut-eye, except for Bevington and Stirmon. Those two along with Sherlock and Lisbeth devised a watch schedule, generously allowing Violet to sleep.
In a flat voice, Violet told him. Sherlock listened intently but his eyes kept flicking back and forth between Violet and John, noting the distance between the normally affectionate friends, how Violet kept rubbing her upper arms and how John winced with every movement he made plus…
John hesitated then put his hand over it. “No… I’d rather not. But I will tell you, it’s a pros and cons list on whether or not I should stay married.
“Why?”
“Sherlock, we’ve been over this. There was no other way we could get to Moriarty,
“So he,” Dupin pointed a many ringed finger at Sherlock, “Can find out
Shaking uncontrollably, Violet tried to lift her head. She opened her mouth to speak but a streak of blood dribbled out instead.
They hadn’t had sex in nearly three weeks. They had barely even kissed.
“Noted,” Dr. Ferguson nodded. “No worries, I’ll treat him like any other toff who thinks he knows more than me because he read an article on WebMD.”
John startled a little at Mary’s voice. “Hey,” he dabbed at his eyes before turning around.
She snorted and texted back:
John wondered as he followed Anthea/Andrea and Sherlock out the door.
Then a strum of recorded guitar music filled the subway... followed by a violin’s wail.
Sherlock had talked Sholto out of dying at John’s wedding. But Sherlock lived in London and Sholto in Durham.
John said his hellos and with Mary’s assistance, helped shoo the women out of the room. Mary picked up Molly’s bouquet, a cheerful cluster of Gerber daisies in every color possible. She was about to hand it to her when there was a small cough behind them.
hacking program,” Mycroft informed John loftily. “It’s a master key, designed to unlock any security program.”
He then noticed Sherlock shooting him a very disgruntled look.
… stress caused by both had finally etched itself permanently on his previously ageless face.
“Then pay some lipstick lesbian to be your beard. You’ve done it before.”
The doorknob didn’t budge.
“Where do you wanna go?” Bill watched Violet heft the rucksack onto her back. “And you want me to carry that?”
“Only if you return Marissa to John then I’ll be happy to comply.”
No, Sherlock did not treat John like an invalid.
“My Violet, yes. Mrs. Holmes.”
“Yeah,” John pocketed his mobile and drew out his pen and paper again. “Exactly. That weird old lady, I want all the information you have on her. Now. I also need the name and contact information of the third-party accounting firm who handles payroll. And the name and contact information of the people who own this Not-A-Brothel.” He put the pen and paper on Missy’s desk and slid them both to her.
“Only a hundred shares, not that impressive or relevant to this situation,” Sherlock turned away from John but continued to shout instructions. “The camera would look fairly new. She would have just recently purchased it before her untimely but not wholly unwelcome demise.”
Sherlock’s throat tightened. He crossed his arms against his chest, fighting against his natural impulse to shut this conversation down. “Oh yes,” he finally whispered. “My old nanny, Rose called Ford right after the fire. She knew he and I were close.”
“I will most certainly not stay put,” Sherlock drew himself up to his full height.
Mycroft wasn’t watching the jet plane taxiing on the runway. He was typing out a text instead. “I’ll need your mobile, Sherlock,” he muttered as the jet plane started to speed up. “Althelney Jones is my top computer analyst. She thinks she can pinpoint a location where John may have been when that video was recorded.”

.  Lisbeth pouted and lowered her arm.
“Um…” John scrolled through the pages of pdf files, squinting at the screen.

done the same for me.” He cleared his throat, mechanically started to raise his left hand to scratch his nose, then switched and awkwardly rubbed his nose with his right hand. “What about Mary? How will we make sure she doesn’t do a bunk and go looking for Maisie while I’m gone?”
So John selected a snug in the back and waited for Violet to return. He had taken his good winter coat, gloves and suit jacket off when Violet returned, carrying not just two bitters but a basket of pork scratchings.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” Mycroft’s nostrils flared. “Explain yourself.”
Trager and Green were in the process of wheeling a motorcycle precariously down the ramp of the Penske moving van.
Violet wasn’t sure what Edward was supposed to do during his Leisure Time, so she chose a common sense option. She just let him play whatever he wanted in his giant playroom.
“Ahhhh…I see,” Sherlock steepled his fingers. He looking up at his ceiling as he thought, “That is why the CIA believes that the Senator was murdered, the missing devices.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he said, “What,” as a statement, not a question.
Her heart no longer jack-hammered, it whirred like a racecar speeding down the Indy 500.
“No, Sherlock didn’t tell me. Magnussen did. He paid me a visit right before Christmas. He told me everything that really happened in his office when Sherlock was shot and ordered me to put a muzzle on Sherlock.”
“No, but it might as well be.”
“Again, you’re doing that talking-thing,” Sherlock strode off, as if he wore one of his elegant suits and his Belstaff.
“I just want my kids to live in the right neighborhood,” Moser whined.
“Oh bloody hell, I forgot,” John ran his hand down his face.
But John saw it, that flash, that split-second of emotion. No one else would have spotted it, but John knew… knew
Jim crossed the lounge to sit next to his grandfather. “It’s not about the money and it’s not about revenge,” Jim told the old lion quietly, urgently. “Richie did something stupid, so bloody stupid. He gave both Holmes and Hunter something he never should have.”
“Sounds like something right up your alley,” Mary quipped. But her voice softened as she gazed fondly at John, “Oh love, do you think I don’t see what you’re doing? Trying to make up for the time when we were separated while I was carrying Maisie?” She shook her head. “I forgave you for that a long time ago, now shut up, I’m trying to say something meaningful and heartfelt,” she said sternly when John opened his mouth to protest. “I never married you to change you. Even if Sherlock hadn’t come back, well, I was a breath away of suggesting you go back being a private detective. You’re a great doctor, but your heart’s just not in it, love. Not like it was when you were a surgeon for the Army. Running about with Sherlock, solving crimes,” she shrugged. “It fills the hole left by the sniper.”
Violet fed Mary her carefully constructed lies, “Nothing yet, just building her trust. Creating a profile, so to speak as well as making sure she adores me. I can’t just be her daughter-in-law. I have to become her
