Three, four, five more thrusts and John was coming so hard that it actually painted Sherlock's chest a little. The sight of it sent Sherlock over the edge and he went stiff and cried out as he soaked his knickers. Finally, Sherlock craned his neck down for a kiss as he rode out his orgasm.
"Bullshit, of course you knew. A) he's a silver fox and EVERYBODY wants him, and B) of course you knew." Sherlock smirked. John kissed him softly. "Seriously, though. Why didn't you tell me you wanted a threesome?"
John took a deep breath and forced himself to look Sherlock in the eye. “Looks to me like you’ve already figured it out.”
John noticed, and his eyes widened. He pounced on Sherlock, toppling them both to the floor and biting at the long, creamy expanse of neck under him. "You will not go unsatisfied tonight," John growled. He rubbed his cock against the bulge in Sherlock's pants and they both moaned. "By the time I'm done with you, you'll be begging to come."
Sherlock felt the slight burn and then the give of his muscles around John's short, scissoring fingers. He nodded and John added a third. The burn was a little less this time, and then John brushed across his prostate and he cried out as sparks showered through his body.
Molly held on to the wall as she kicked off her heels. "Fuck off, Sherlock. It's nothing to do with you."
Sherlock winced. "Apologies. I'm not happy that your ex-commander is dead, just there’s a reasonable explanation."
And Sherlock rifled through the bag and came up with a blindfold. "Turn," he commanded. Molly did, and as Sherlock knotted the fabric behind her ears, he murmured, "You won't even know who's fucking you. Could be any of us. Perhaps I've invited someone new." Molly smiled faintly, and shifted her weight. Definitely affirmative. Sherlock led her across the room, pushing her shoulders and she was sitting on the couch. "Lie down." Molly stretched out like a cat and Sherlock traced a finger from her cheek, to her neck, in a straight line between her breasts, and circling her navel twice before disappearing.
After rubbing along John's soft cock a few times, and feeling it starting to firm, Sherlock turned, draping one arm over the back of John's chair and leaning to whisper in John's ear. Quietly, this time. "Think anyone would notice if I sucked you off?" He licked up the edge of his ear, then rubbed over it with his bottom lip.
Sherlock smiled a bit, allowing himself to imagine it, to step outside of himself and see it objectively. "You flirted."
Sherlock rolled his eyes derisively and propped his head up on a fist as he opened his mouth to retort, only to close it again when he saw the tears in John's eyes. He reached out with his other hand to rest on John's hip. "Are you asking if I have ever been raped?"
John's gaze followed to his swollen erection and he smiled sadly. "Well, most people are idiots. Yours is big in a way that scratches all the right itches. Mine is more fun to look at than to actually use, most of the time."
John glanced up, taking in Sherlock’s bitten lips and flushed skin and the tension in his shoulders, and understood what Sherlock needed in that magical way he always had done. “OK,” he said, with a reassuring smile, before closing his mouth around Sherlock, swirling his tongue around his length once before pushing forward to take the bulk of him in. He hollowed his cheeks as he lifted his head again, swirling his tongue around the head as he sucked.
John shrugged, rubbing a thumb over Sherlock's scars. "It makes me sad, I guess. Or angry, that you ever felt the need to go there. You deserved better, too."
John began undressing himself, unbuttoning his shirt efficiently and tossing it on the floor. Sherlock reached for his vest first, and John obliged, lifting his arms so Sherlock could all but tear it off of him. He watched as Sherlock stared greedily at his chest and chuckled. “You’ve seen it before,” he reasoned.
Sherlock ruffled his fingers through John’s sandy hair. “It’s not my fault you have such a tempting mouth.” The hot breath that huffed against his cock in response tickled, and he squirmed more. John swatted as his flank, but finally, mercifully, closed around him again. Sherlock rocked his hips up to meet him, letting John decide on the depth but helping to set the pace a bit. Desire spilled through his belly, hot and insistent, and spreading with every bob of John’s head.
Sherlock nodded, even though he was really sure. John pulled his fingers out carefully and Sherlock whined, feeling empty. After stuffing a pillow under Sherlock's bum, he drizzled more slick on his opening and the coated himself generously. "Tell me when to stop." John lined up and pushed.
and Sherlock remembered the shot of fear that ran through him before he broke the man's wrist and knocked out the friend who rushed to defend him. The rest of them seemed to decide to leave the
"Sexually?" John nodded. Sherlock tipped his head, considering. "Only when it was part of the arrangement, which was rare." He held John's gaze. "But that wasn't your question."
Sherlock managed a high, incoherent noise that John correctly interpreted as consent, and John yanked off his own jeans and pants, exhaling in relief when his cock was finally free.
Molly locked the deadbolt behind her, and stood in the kitchen uncertainly for a moment. She glanced, for the first time, at the living room. She thought about how Sally had marched right up to the apartment, not given her fear time to stop her.
John flinched; Sherlock held his gaze. “I don’t want to see you go to jail, John. So yes, I will help you. But this … I would not have thought you capable. I’ve never felt anything less than pride when someone has mistakenly thought we were a couple, because I’ve always known you to be a good man. You help people; you help me. I knew your father was an abusive arsehole, and I know many people have difficulty getting through that without making mistakes of their own. But
John nodded. "I understand, Molly. But you cannot stay here, either. We both love you and we will help you any other way we can. But you're leaving tomorrow."
. Liked to watch his face, to drive him to the edge, to see him unravel, with an expression that was tender, reverent … His eyes popped open again. “Oh,” he breathed. “Oh. You
Early the next morning, a weight on the bed woke her up. She opened a bleary eye to see Sherlock arching a tentatively amused eyebrow. "Whaa?" She groaned, squinting against the dull ache in her head. He flicked his eyes to her breasts, one of which was being lightly cupped by short, strong fingers. Slightly panicked, she followed the hand back to its source and then flopped back down.
Sherlock disentangled himself and scooted back to kneel, bum resting on John's knees. "I have a counter offer." He pulled his belt free of the loops and tossed it on the floor before opening his trousers and removing himself with a long stroke. "We haven't watched each other yet."
Sherlock broke the kiss after awhile, pressing his forehead to John's and continuing his unhurried thrusts. "God, I haven't done this since sixth form," he admitted as John pulled his legs tighter. "You're right, it's pleasant." He captured John's lips again and caressed his face tenderly as his hips moved in a smooth rhythm. He broke away for a moment, stroking over John's cheekbones and lips, tracing his strong jaw. "You're gorgeous," he murmured, before closing back down on John's mouth, licking against the roof of his mouth. He wanted more, wanted to curl up inside John and never leave.
John sucked in a breath. This was wrong, he should put a stop to it. Molly was his friend and he shouldn't be fantasizing about her body this way. It was an invasion of privacy to listen to Sherlock's ded--
The last word was drowned out by a gasp as Sherlock fluttered his tongue over her clit. He kept his licks light and teasing, goading her. She pulled on his collar, smashing his face against her cunt, but he didn't give her the suction she needed.
" He looked between them, eyes sweeping over Sherlock's suddenly defensive demeanor and John's guilty, apologetic expression. He looked back to Sherlock. "Ex?"
Sherlock chuckled, buzzing John's cock pleasantly. With one last swirl of his tongue, he lifted up. "You are usually so reserved," Sherlock explained. "I like seeing you lose control like that. Bring that fine arse of yours to the edge of the bed and roll over, will you? There you go. Tuck your knees under you. God, you're perfect." Sherlock teased the hole with feathery flicks to the edges while John panted above him.
Sherlock chuckled, the rumbling vibrations buzzing against John’s face. “Well, it was true with my other partners. I’m discovering that none of my prior experiences are of any use to me at all when it comes to you. It’s different.”
"Can' have you walkin' round' like that, can we?" The heat that flooded Sherlock's body had less to do with the hand on his cock than the fact that John had just honest-to-God teased him. He pulled John's boxer briefs down far enough to grasp his (mostly soft) prick. John squirmed a bit. "No, you don' need to. I can jus' bring you off, iss no big deal."
When crime scenes became needlessly tense again, and Lestrade began asking pointed questions about John's absence, Sherlock invited him on a few cases. Here, things were nearly normal again; they were stiff with each other at first, but Sherlock found himself getting lost in the cases and they fell into their familiar groove without really meaning to. Afterward, they would return to the flat, and Sherlock would work on experiments while John watched crap telly, and they mostly ignored each other, although Sherlock often felt John's gaze when he was bent over his microscope.
“I threatened him and beat him up. Called him words I would never use now, told him that he wasn’t welcome in the neighborhood anymore, and smashed his face in.” He forced himself to look up and see Sherlock’s reaction. The only word he could find to describe his face was
fine that he pushed forward. He rolled his eyes dismissively. "Yes, you've mentioned that, but you were probably high before."
He pumped his hips a few more times and then stilled, rolling off of John reluctantly as he gulped in deep lungfuls of air. He felt John cleaning himself with the towel before lifting his bum to toss it away. Then John's warm weight settled across his chest and his neck tickled with the nuzzling of John's prickly face. He wrapped his long arms around John and basked in the quiet, loose-limbed euphoria that nearly always followed sex with John.
Sherlock spat back, “And I thought it was all ‘fine’, regardless?” He glared down at John. “Don’t patronize me. I deserve an answer, even if I am a
is your other Valentine’s Day gift. I’ll let you open me up back at the flat.” John took a sip of his chianti, smirking over his glass and looking incredibly pleased with himself. Or at least, Sherlock was fairly certain that’s what happened; his brain had momentarily shut down. At any rate, when he rebooted, John was looking downright smug and nodding at his glass. “Why don’t you take a drink, love?” Sherlock emptied the last of his wine and Angelo brought over the bottle, asking if he wanted another glass.
She stepped into the too-hot spray and just let it scald her for a moment, relishing the bite on her skin, before she reached for John's bar of plain soap. She rubbed it over a flannel, then scrubbed herself everywhere. Scrubbed the makeup from her face, a stranger's sweat from her skin, and finally the stickiness from her legs, groin, and bum. She stood there, watching her filth swirl down the drain, then rinsed the flannel and repeated the whole process two more times, until parts of her skin were raw. She scrubbed her scalp under the cold water, shivering as she rinsed once, then twice, then a third time. She wanted to wash again but she could hear John tapping on the door. "Molly? You alright?"
ended up with an overseas account linked to him, despite the fact that the other two we nailed both claimed he wasn't involved. He's in lockup for another few years. Sherlock took one look at us and knew. That's why he called me to take your statement."
Reality struck Molly like a punch to the chest and she realized she was letting a complete stranger fuck her in front of an open door, and she suddenly hated it, wanted his pounding cock and his sweat-slicked chest and his stifling breath away from her. She tried not to think about how cheap she felt as he sought his pleasure without even looking at her, letting her mind go blank as she waited for him to finish. The room was quiet aside from Jack's panting and the slap of his bollocks, but even that sounded far away. Distantly, she realized that he was fucking her quite hard, but the sensation was dull. She came out of her reverie when he cursed and grunted in her ear, pouring inside of her.
"Better." Sherlock lowered his face to the top of John's head, dropping kisses there as he nosed through his hair. John tangled their feet together and returned his hand to his cock. Sherlock reached blindly behind him to find the lube on his bedside stand and passed it over.
John's voice turned. "Yes, there is. Molly can't see what's coming to tell us if she doesn't want it, and you can't read her face as well with it half-covered."
John startled; he hadn't know Sherlock had a case on, but here he was, clearly infiltrating a gay club. John took a sip of his drink and watched him, trying to pin down what about Sherlock was off. He held his weight just slightly more on one hip, and his posture was looser, his elbows moving more as he gestured. His smile was wide, generous, and he was laughing easily along with the others. He was animated. It was artfully done; he wasn't exactly "playing gay", but his mannerisms were subtly different in a way that said he belonged here.
Sherlock ignored that and openly studied him for the first time since their falling out. "You've been researching statutes of limitation and how to file formal complaints with the General Medical Counsel." John nodded his head once in affirmation and waited patiently. "You gave a statement to Lestrade accepting responsibility for the attack on Vincent Tucker. Why would you do that? You must know how likely it is that you'll lose your medical license."
!”  John rounded his lower back, attempting to hurry Sherlock’s thrusts, but Sherlock wasn’t having it.
John nodded and pushed Sherlock's knees back gently, accepting his hand up to standing. Both men abandoned their trousers and pants en route to Sherlock's room, shucking off their shirts once inside. Sherlock sat back against the headboard, stretching an inviting arm to John. Crawling in, John curled up against Sherlock, and nuzzled his head on the taller man's bony shoulder. John peeked up. "Better?"
John's breathing became ragged, irregular, and with one more swirl of Sherlock's thumb he stopped breathing entirely for several long seconds before groaning his release against Sherlock's shirt.
But John's cock was thickening rapidly in Sherlock's hand and he stroked it just as he'd stroked John's back, with long, sure movements, until he was fully hard. Then he let go, leaning forward to give John a deep, long kiss, and rolled his hips to rub their cocks together. "I missed you," he whispered in John's ear before dropping down to kiss at his neck. It was true; Sherlock hadn't realized how lonely and touch-starved he'd been.
Sherlock straightened up, a mischevious gleam in his eye. "Yesss," he hissed. He closed the distance between them, pulling John in for a long kiss before pulling away to shrug off his jacket. "Mycroft will see." He flung it on the floor and unbuttoned his shirt, eyes dancing. "He won't be able to resist the chance to analyze your body language but he'll be completely disturbed." John pulled back, raising an eyebrow and crossing his arms. Sherlock smirked at him and waved a finger at his body language. "Don't give me this. You
Molly's thong was ripped away from her body and her legs were lifted. Sally nudged her clit in her mouth and Molly sucked. "Do you want to know who's fucking you?" Molly shrugged a shoulder as a cock pushed into her. "Good. You're a right little slut, aren't you? You'll let anyone fuck you." Whoever was fucking her set a rhythm, but it wasn't enough. "Maybe next time we can just blindfold you and strip you and drape you over a table out in the lobby with a sign that says 'Free Fucks'. Would you like that?" Molly groaned into Sally's lap. Whoever was fucking her -- she suspected it was Greg -- seemed to like it, too. His strokes came a little faster and harder, finally. "The next day you'd get in the lift and not know who you'd fucked or who'd watched."
Wiping the bar in front of John, Chris cracked a big smile. "Nah. So long as the dancers are selling the lapdances, they don't much care what else goes on. You want another drink?" John nodded, no longer feeling any compunction about his level of inebriation. A few seconds later, the implication of what Chris had said smacked John in the face, so when he set another drink in front of him, he asked in as casual a voice as he could muster. "So the owners don't mind a little ... side business?"
Sherlock had a breakthrough. Her attacker had said "cell phone" and written "color" and "favor" in messages to the other victim. Given that, Sherlock had done searches on various dating sites using several bits of American phrasing and found someone who might be him.
And then suddenly, John forgot how to breathe, because Sherlock was dancing toward him, swinging his hips to the beat and holding intense eye contact as he freed the buttons at the top of the shirt.
Molly thought for a moment about something Sally wouldn't use against him. "Remember when the Baby Jesus went missing from the Trafalgar Square display?"
For an aching moment, Sherlock didn't think John would answer. Then a pleading whisper in his ear. "My arse," John admitted.
Sherlock didn't respond other than to loosen John's belt and trousers and slide a hand inside to palm his erection. "Rock hard, just imagining being watched. Naughty, naughty." He closed his hand around John and squeezed gently, eliciting a moan. "Shall we let her see what she's been turning away?" Sherlock pulled him in for a kiss, shifting their position so the camera caught their profile rather than his back, and pushed John's trousers and pants down his thighs. John's flushed cock jutted away from his body and Sherlock took a half-step back, running his fingers lightly over the shaft as John shivered. "She's watching closely now. So let's give her a good show, yeah?"
John flinched, adjusted his cane. "But do you see how it might be a bit difficult to see someone all the time when you've had a falling out?"
The taxi ride was far too short. When they pulled up, Sally was leaning against the doorway, holding a paper bag that Molly sincerely hoped contained something her queasy stomach would find palatable.
Sherlock tipped his head, considering. "I thought you'd get nervous and wouldn't enjoy it as much if you had too much time to think about it."
. After gently disengaging his cock, he crawled up Sherlock's body and rolled off to the side. Silently, he stroked Sherlock's cheekbones and jaw, and searched his eyes carefully.
John stood, pulled Sherlock up with him. Still hazy with euphoria, he tipped his head up for another kiss as he tugged at Sherlock's belt and shoved his trousers and pants down around his ankles before pushing him back into the chair. He knelt in front of Sherlock, and flicked his eyes up at him nervously. "This might not --"
They kissed and rubbed and ruffled and tugged until they were both dry, and Sherlock grabbed a dry towel from the hook on the door, abandoning the wet one on the tile floor. John had gone a bit giddy and was steering Sherlock to his old room as he pressed soft, giggly kisses to his mouth.
He winced. "That came out badly. Can we strike it from the record? What I meant to say is it's a 3-way tie between your cheekbones, your smile, and your legs."
Sherlock shook his head in exasperation. "You are unbelievable. NO, we are not going back to invite him."
They stole up the stairs, mindful not to wake Mrs. Hudson, and stripped off shoes and socks and jackets before turning to each other.
John didn’t answer right away. “Well, he certainly was ready to die at the wedding, wasn’t he? The last time we spoke he seemed a bit better than normal, but he’s been deeply unhappy for years. So, I suppose I didn’t have any indication that he was in any immediate danger, but it probably should not have been as shocking as it was.”
Sally rinsed her bowl in the sink. "Listen, you're a grown woman and you'll do what you think is best. But it's a hell of a lot easier to get through this with someone who knows what the fuck they're doing helping you."
Sally thought for a moment. "About 6 months, I guess? I tried to go off them after a month." She rolled her eyes, shaking her head at her own foolishness. "I hated having to take them, but it was just too soon. Couldn't focus on my studies at all, snd I started skipping class again. So I went back on them and told myself not to rush it. Tried again a few months later and had no problems."
The next day, Lestrade called with an urgent case: an apparent double murder-suicide, but Lestrade and Anderson both felt that the evidence didn’t add up. Sherlock had swished in, immediately insulting everybody in the room, including the octogenarian who had found the bodies, and cut John off in the middle of reporting an important fact about the victims. John had bristled, Anderson had coughed something about a lover’s quarrel, and Sherlock glanced over him for a half-second before retorting, “It’s been 5 weeks since you and your wife copulated, not that the act is biologically relevant given your sperm count.”  Anderson responded by calling Sherlock a queer, which led to Lestrade banishing him from the crime scene. After the roaring in John’s ears died down, he realized that Sherlock had goaded Anderson into saying what he had with the express purpose of getting rid of him.
, but mostly it was unintelligible. Then he heard footsteps inside the room, followed by the door opening, and then a very familiar voice.
," he said, and it was like a prayer. He closed the small distance between them and plundered his mouth again as he pushed more deeply between his thighs, entwining their fingers above John's head. Emotion consumed him, and suddenly he realized that despite their leisurely pace, he was close.
Sally nodded, her face coolly dispassionate but Sherlock could see her distress in the set of her jaw and the way she kept scratching at her cuticles. She asked a few questions, determining the timeline and reviewing details, seeming to want to give Molly a respite before talking about the worst of it. Finally, she nodded her head encouragingly at Molly. "You're doing great, Dr. Hooper. Whenever you're ready, go ahead and tell me about what happened next."
John laughed in horror at what rated as dramatic to Sherlock. "Secret's safe, love. Don't want anyone else seeing you anyway." John kissed him, squeezing his bum lightly.
Sherlock chuckled and slicked a finger, pushing it slowly into his now willing hole. "You'll come. Loudly, if I had to guess." He added a second finger. John sucked in a breath through his teeth, flinching a bit. "Relax," he crooned. He leaned down and licked around the hole as he slid one and then two fingers in and out, coming close to that one spot but not touching it until John began to pant and push back against him.  He added more lube, and a third finger, and started grazing his prostate lightly. John gripped the sheets, making a strangled cry and angling his hips for more. "That's it," Sherlock said, teasing his prostate. "That's how you like it. I could watch you like this for
Sherlock didn’t look at him, just kept pacing and occasionally squeezing his eyes shut. John swallowed and continued. “One day my Dad and I were out, and I was less spectacularly drunk than he was, so I drove us home. And I …” He swallowed again, took a big breath. “I swerved, hit someone. A homeless man. He
Watson." John grabbed her elbow as she walked away, and she spun back, eyes wild, and shoved in the chest so hard that he toppled backward, bouncing against the wall. He righted himself, holding his hands up in the same don't-shoot posture Mark had used earlier. Sherlock quickly stepped between them, steadying John’s shoulder and holding a gentling palm out to Molly, who was just realizing what she’d done. She clasped her hand to her mouth. "Shit, I'm sorry."
Molly burrowed into his warm skin as John yelped. He rubbed her bare back, and held her close, willing some of his body heat to travel to her. "What happened tonight?"
John started. "Do I?" He paused for a moment, and Sherlock let him consider it without interruption. "Christ, I guess I do. That's fucking lousy of me." Sherlock exhaled through his nose, and allowed one corner of his mouth to twitch up a bit.  John crossed his arms thoughtfully. "I don't always fight fair when I argue," he admitted reluctantly. "As much as I hate to admit this, a big part of it is probably that I know that it bothers you."
"You're perfect," Sherlock said firmly. "It's the long fingers; no one likes how small they look when I do this." John's shoulders were still stiff. Sherlock sighed his impatience. "You're a great size. I'm sure you fuck like a porn star."
"How about we move on to the part where you're too busy sucking Greg off to talk?" John said, in a tone that did not invite argument.
John swallowed guiltily. Of course he hadn't dreamed that Sherlock would fail to notice his wandering eyes, nor that he would fail to mention it, but he'd rather hoped Sherlock would wait until they were at home. "Do you think we could possibly discuss this later?"
They lay there, catching their breath for a long moment, and then John started giggling. “Are we mad?” he asked, after a long moment.
John rose to a kneeling position, pulling Sherlock in for a kiss, winding his fingers through his curls and tugging as he met tongue with tongue. Sherlock broke the kiss and moved to his ear, eliciting the same shivery giggle as before. John tugged away, swatting at Sherlock’s behind again. “Why don’t you lay back and let me do all the work, to start off?”
And the following day, better still. Her appetite started to return, and whether it was because of the food or the pills, she had more energy. She still felt angry quite often, but keeping it from bursting out of her was easier.
"Mmm, sorry, got a bit lost there for a moment." John rolled on his side to face Sherlock, pulling slowly on the his drawstring and waiting for Sherlock's nod of approval before slipping his hand inside. Sherlock tipped his head back, exposing that glorious neck with the faintest of marks still visible. John considered sucking another one, higher up where everyone could see, but decided that he wanted to watch all of Sherlock's reactions instead. He liked firmer pressure than John, but shorter strokes. His face was beautifully expressive when he was aroused, all bitten lips and rolled-back eyes and slack-jawed moans. John pulled his hand up to spit on it and Sherlock's sharp eyes and helpless whimper made John chuckle and hold the hand up to Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock's eyes narrowed in lust for a moment and he leaned forward a few centimeters to add his own saliva. John returned the hand to Sherlock and the man's eyes rolled back in his head as an open-throated moan seemed to be ripped from him. A few quick strokes later and he was crying out, spraying into John's hand before collapsing back on the mattress.
"As for any experimentation that went on," he continued, pressing up behind him and growling in his ear. "I rather think you were on the receiving end." He ran his nose along the edge of John's ear, eliciting a shiver. "It's really quite obvious."
Sherlock felt a bubble of revulsion twisting his stomach, and cursed the 3rd glass of whisky for the sentiment that was spilling out of him. “Meanwhile, Vincent, an actual human, has had to live with humiliation, fear, and uneven cheekbones for the last 15 years. All so you could live out your dream of being a bloody doctor and getting yourself blown up in Afghanistan.” Sherlock glared at him. “And that’s what you’ll do again, of course. Protect your career and your reputation.”
John looked scared all of a sudden; more scared than he had when Sherlock had been shouting at him. "What do you want from me, Sherlock?"
“Ssssh,” John whispered, pressing a finger to his lips. “Hush, gorgeous. Let’s see if I can’t distract you.” He pulled at Sherlock’s shirt buttons, pressing in for kisses now and then but mostly just letting Sherlock the desire in his eyes as more and more of Sherlock’s skin was revealed. He pushed the shirt over Sherlock’s shoulders and tugged it off his arms, discarding it onto the floor. Kissing Sherlock once more, he whispered, “Lie back,” as he pushed gently against his shoulders.
Molly smiled cheekily. "We'll just have to do our best to stay quiet then, yeah? I have two flatmates. At least one is wide awake and would interrogate you mercilessly."
Finally, a spasm Sherlock had been working on shuddered and released, simultaneously releasing other muscles down John's back, and his shoulder dropped a half-inch. Sherlock scooped a bit more oil, spreading it on both shoulders now with smooth, firm strokes. He leaned forward to kiss John's ear. "Better?" John hummed a yes, closing his eyes against the relaxing sensation of his battered muscles being soothed. "Let's move to the bed. I can do more on your shoulder if you're lying down and you'll be more comfortable when you pass out on me."
Of course, Sherlock could tell that John was seeing quite a lot of Ella again. Every Monday and Thursday, he left the flat looking vaguely uncomfortable and returned, 94 minutes later, looking a bit more relaxed, a bit drained. He spent a lot of time writing by hand in a journal. Apparently, John had given up on creating a satisfactory passcode and was sticking steadfastly to hard copies, which, to Sherlock's frustration, he seemed to keep on him at all times. He glared inwardly, reminding himself that the inner workings of John Watson's mind were no longer his mystery to solve.
Standing about 40 feet away, slightly obscured by a small tree and looking directly at Sherlock in such a way that any relief he might have felt  in seeing another person out here in the dark and dangerous woods where any number of huge animal could kill him, disappears, replaced by a heavy unsettling fear. The man isn’t lean but he looks gaunt, longish thick hair spilling across his bearded face. The man looks like he’s been on the run and hasn’t eaten a good meal in some time.
Another person comes crashing through the thicket. This one is wearing a uniform of some kind and carrying a rifle by his side.
“No, no, no! Mommy, big doggie!” He stomps his tiny foot. “I want a big dog. Like that one.” He points to an enormous mastiff and moves towards its cage.
Sherlock is going to die. He knows that now. In another second the wolf is going to reach him and rip him apart. He hopes it’s quick.
Shivering violently, he doesn’t dare look up, not even when the seconds tick by and he isn’t torn apart or eaten. He can sense the wolf is now circling around him, snapping and growling, no doubt waiting for the right angle to attack.
The morning is bright and clear, an azure sky so painfully beautiful the child has to spend several minutes on his back in the soft grasses next to the large mulberry bush just staring up at the wondrous vastness. He’s recently begun learning violin and he hums to himself an etude as he goes over in his head all that he needs to accomplish that morning.
“Please, don’t!” He screams, out loud this time, as he peers up at the wolf - more than a wolf. The enormous beast has now travelled more than three-fourths the distance towards him.
He tucks his forehead down against his tiny knees and covers himself as best his can with his skinny arms. In that very instant the creature is upon him; he feels its hot breath snorting across his exposed skin.
A lurch of defiant bitterness and anger swells up inside the boy. He grimaces up at the giant wolf, nearly upon him now, so close he catched the beetle black eyes of the beast; his mind screaming just one word over and over.
“No, no. He didn’t kidnap me. He was going to eat me! He’s a wolf,” He exclaims, pointing to the man, who, Sherlock notes with horror, has his pitch black eyes fixed directly on him and on no one else, not even the rifle still trained on his head.
Sherlock climbs out from the protective shelter of the roots and scrabbles around a thicket of brambles only to come to a gasping halt.
The Holmes family lives in a seaside cottage, with the beach a little less than half a mile eastward. The house itself is nestled by a sparse wood, but to the west the forest grows dense and dark and goes on for miles. These woods are the only place little Sherlock is forbidden to enter.
There’s an odd, far-away snuffling sound, and for a split second the boy thinks it’s one of Lawson’s dogs. He leaps up looks over in its direction. The sound changes immediately; no longer the sedate sniffing of before, what he hears now is a low, a very low, almost impossible to hear, rumble. Could that be Dougie? Surely it’s too low.
I shall be back to normal uploading for the week, but I will be preoccupied between the 15th-19th due to family events happening. So be wary of any delays during this time.
Irene’s thoughts took her focus, returning it just enough to realise the incoming swipe of The Man in Black’s foot. Apparently he had been watching and studying her moves too. It couldn't be said if Irene fell of her own accord or if she was truly bested. The Woman fell onto her back as The Man in Black’s sword tip was held to her throat. She slowly moved her knees. Her sword far from her hand in the dirt next to her, looking up at the man. His eyes seemingly in thought. She lost; but maybe someone else can live now. Irene was a woman of honor, she knew what her defeat meant. Her only regret was failing in avenging Kate. “If you are going to kill me, do it quickly.”
Hope didn’t seem to care. “Is the brute now complaining about being so? You were suppose to be this colossus. You were this great legendary thing. And. Yet. He. Gains.”
“That’s the rule with any new specimen.” he explained, giving Sherlock a smirk at the notion of him being nothing more than an experiment. “We like our subjects to be at prime health before breaking them, gives more accurate results that way.”
Things really began to change one winter when John Watson had spotted the young man on the roof of the barn. He had only noticed as he had nearly been a casualty, only missing being impaled by an icicle launched from his grip, aiming for a row of gourds he had nicked from the stores.
By the time he let Billy go, Count Charles stood at the gate, gesturing for John to follow. The boy ran back off to his mother and the people continued their praise.
At this, The Enforcer visibly retreated. Recognising the potential fatality to his words. “Of course not, sire. Forgive me...”
To his credit, the man only stumbled a bit over his words, at the mere thought of questioning a claim from his highness. Prince James would have respected such an action any other time. Well, at least a little bit. At present, the Prince’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you doubt the validity of your Prince’s word, Dimmock? I assure you that as Crown Prince, I would be privy to a great deal more information that you and your spy network would. I hope my faith hasn’t been misguided in entrusting you…”
“John, don't think I don't want to hear it or to say it. But you need to understand that it's taking every bit of my strength to be able to leave today - I fear if we start saying it, it will never stop and I won't go.” he explained, unable to meet John’s eye as he did so. Controlling his emotions in a way that still showed they were there without giving way to them. “And I have to go… John you deserve the best I can give you. Please, give me something to look forward to when I return”
“You idiot.” The next thing Sherlock knew was that he was suddenly pushed onto his back with a strength neither of them knew John currently possessed in his worn and battered state; and was kissed fiercely. Sherlock was taken by surprise; faltering for a second before he parted his lips to let John in...
Sherlock didn't respond. Instead he just turned back to his melons, motioning for John to stand back as he began to beat the skin of the fruit.
“It couldn't wait. It just couldn't wait till morning.” John panted, winded from the run still. “Sherlock I---” Now that he was in front of the man, John felt his certainty start to wain. What if he was wrong?
The Woman, Adler - lithe yet strong in stature. Now that she no longer wore a traveler's cloak, John could see that she was clearly the blade in their operations. Fine regal cutlass strapped to her side as long clean fingers tapped the handle in an almost subconscious motion every so often. Long dark hair swept up effortlessly on her head. She always seemed to wear an expression like she was thinking.
. Coincidences were not something he believed in, the universe was rarely that lazy. A sly grin spread across his face, remembering the words of the french woman, Irene Adler:
“Your mother, when she thought you dead, she would often call me in for tea and tell me stories about you.” John didn’t miss the uncomfortable shift the other man had at the mention of his mother.
“I don't have to throw this rock. We have to engage, there is no way around that; but we can be civilized.”
However, she wasn't ready to go back to the traitor just yet. Her eyes stung as everyone didn't see the obvious betrayal, her stomach churned along with it (but that was more likely to be the chickenpox). “No…” her voice was smaller, meeker than before as she tried to steady it. “No, daddy you were wrong! You aren't listening… ‘Sirlock’ loves you and you let him go… no….” She kept repeating that as John guided her back to the pillow and Molly tucked her in.
“I'm okay, I guess. Molly has been telling me stories and Sherlock has been keeping me company when I was sad.” Rosie reached out for his hand, having been without her dad for days and not wanting him to go anytime soon. “Does this mean you can stay with me now?”
. You had previously promised such a thing to me; what am I supposed to think? What am I to think of the value of your word?”
John listened intently, unable to help a twinge of jealousy towards the pirate whom Sherlock was describing a close friendship with. It felt hypocritical as John had been set to marry another in belief that Sherlock was dead - could he really be angry for him had he had a brief affair while gone. He hadn’t realised how visible these thoughts were on his face because when Sherlock paused to take his sword back, he let out a snigger. “Oh relax John, it wasn’t like that.” he assured. “You see, Roberts is far from the kind of person I would feel an attraction to in that sense. You’ll understand in a moment. For years, this was the cycle. I’d spend my working hours training, doing whatever tasks Roberts asked of me, then I’d retire and be Roberts friend, as opposed to the valet I was during the day before going off to my own quarters. I’d keep Roberts’ secret and Roberts let me live. Friendship happened somewhere in between that. That was when that opportunity I had been waiting for came up, or rather, Roberts came to to me about it. You see, Roberts had grown so rich that he wanted to retire and was looking for a successor. But it couldn’t just be anyone, it had to be someone clever and so far nobody had solved the greatest test. That was until I revealed what I had known since that first month. You see, Roberts was actually a Roberta.”
This time it wasn't Rosie who spoke but Sherlock, who held an expression that could only be described as reminding John of a particularly venomous scorpion he had once encountered in the deserts. “Apologise for
The young girl looked as if she hadn't considered this, certainly she did not want her dad to be unhappy. There was enough of that with her being sick already. Rosie thought for a second before replying. “Well… I guess it's okay…. But I still don't want to see the mushy stuff.” She said with a cheeky grimace.
this separation. At the moment, it had seemed to be what was right. It had been selfish of him, he knew that even then, but he had just had Sherlock back - he couldn’t stand to see his life taken from him once more. At least, he was alive. He was free, on his ship and likely sailing far away from John. He deserved it, John saw the look on his face when he had surrendered.
Lestrade scrunched his face in thought, “I had a rough idea, but like I said it got too dark and I lost him.”
Hope, whom John recognized as the aging man, walked with the spring of a much younger man. No quake or quiver in his step. Proving just how duped Prince John had been. He was a little man, almost seemingly unremarkable except for a look he held in his eye that always seemed to know more than you. Clearly, this was their leader - the one who wanted him dead and was willing to do the honours. Unlike Lestrade, Hope was entirely Grey and thinning. He wore round glasses that aged him further and had a funny look about him.
Molly clucked sympathetically. “I'm sorry John, here put this on. I left the medicine in Sherlock’s room, so just give me a moment.”
“Because your highness, I was always taught that marriage involves love and that is not an area I like treading. Especially, as you said, we hardly know one another.”
-And it had mattered. Even if it had been short lived. The brooch moved, off his day clothes and onto his night ones. The cool metal against his skin reminding him of why he did what he did. Isn’t that why he enlisted? Isn’t it why he was now marrying Prince James? To serve the kingdom, yes - but also to protect. Even now, the handsome brooch was proudly worn on his Princely attire, admittedly suiting it much better than the dirty farm rags it had once made it’s home against. It had become almost a part of him, refusing to replace it when offered offers. After his first week, it had just become accepted and no longer argued.
Thirty minutes later, they were naked and John was leading a master class on deepthroating in their bedroom. "When you're first learning, it's easiest to start in a 69 position." They all paused and watched Greg's cock twitch. "Which even I can tell Greg is not opposed to," John continued with a wry smile.
Sherlock reminded himself, although John’s eyes glinted mischeviously when Sherlock grasped him by the hair. He finally came up for a breath before sinking back down, keeping Sherlock’s eye contact all the while. Heat flooded through Sherlock and he gripped John’s hair more tightly, pulling him up a few inches. “If you don’t stop …”
Unfortunately, John opened his eyes as he was rolling and paused at the sight of Sherlock's tented pyjamas. "Ignore it," Sherlock insisted. "This isn't a sexy massage."
The “no one in this room except you and me” line was shamelessly stolen from Joss Whedon. I still haven’t recovered from Firefly being canceled.
John shoved him and couldn't keep from shouting. "You absolute WANKER. Listen to me. I put up with a hell of a lot for your bloody experiments, but I draw the line at ..." He trailed off, but Sherlock startled as though he had said it aloud. "I can't talk to you in here," John continued. "Go make some tea and I'll be there in a minute.  Sherlock looked for a long second like he might protest, but he flicked his eyes over John once more and seemed to think better of it.
He laughed, and Molly wanted to wrap herself up in his caramelly voice. "Doesn't sound like it was a very satisfying arrangement."
With a loud cry, John sprayed down Sherlock’s throat then pulled out, letting the rest of it splash over his face. “Oh,
"I could talk to one of the strippers," John suggested. He'd tried to play it cool, but Sherlock's sharp eyes bore right through him.
John considered his flatmate for a moment, eyes flicking up and down his begowned form a few times as he pulled his face into an a exaggerated grimace, tilting his head apologetically. "I have to admit, you're looking a bit rough at the moment."
Molly shoved her arms into the sleeves with rather more force than was necessary. "Thank you for your
Sherlock stepped back, one corner of his mouth lifted in a sly smile. "Mmm. You know I never guess." He raked his eyes over John, whose face warmed with the sudden attention. "You said you were ‘mostly straight', which typically implies just mutual masturbation and oral sex; however, your smug smile suggests you've had a more involved experience."
“Had his fucking hands all over you,” John muttered, hardly aware of what he was saying as he fucked into Sherlock’s mouth in long, hard strokes. Sherlock’s eyes were watering now. “Mine,” he growled, pushing in hard and holding there for a few seconds as though to underscore the word. He pulled out, rubbing himself on Sherlock’s lips, letting him catch his breath.
On Friday, Sally had texted her, and so that evening she refreshed her makeup and met her at a pub. They ordered sandwiches and pints and chit chatted about the stabbing case Molly had worked on.
The Man in Black spoke, abruptly dropping his hand. Steel coating over his eyes once more. “As I said, you are a labourer. No matter what member of the royal family has taken their fancy with you. Your promise means nothing.”
Sherlock ignored the sarcastic quip and continued. “What I told you on the hilltop was true too. The bit about the
He sighed deeply. “So I am to be tortured then?” The Man nodded, and Sherlock straightened himself out as much as possible. “I can cope with torture.” At this, the man laughed. Sherlock frowned, “Don’t believe me?”
A testament to her long developed resilient nature which had  been developed over the year out on her own, hunting The Six-Fingered Man across the globe. The roughest and most meager of conditions had become like a second home to her.  Even in the employment of Jefferson Hope, the luxury of comfort had been forsaken several time for the purpose of the job. Whenever luxury did befall them, it was only with arm twisting that prevented their leader from hoarding it for himself.  Most of the many moons spent in that band had been saved only by the companionship of Gregory Lestrade.
Sherlock Holmes was raised on an estate that was surrounded by acres of farmland in the country of Florin. His favourite past times were his studies, in which he partook in many and mostly of his own direction, and poking at the farm boy who served his family to go along with whatever he did. His name was John Watson, but Sherlock never called him that.
Sherlock smirked. “I think we still have some clothes of yours upstairs. Go get changed, put that lotion on and I will see if Molly can be persuaded to stay a bit longer.”
Prince John rose from his chair, turning towards where the Count sat and garnered his attention. “My friend, you returned this lad to his ship, correct?”
“I hate this. I’m itchy, I feel awful and I miss my da’.” Rosie pouted, puckering her lip out to prove a point.
Prince James held his arms out in accepted defeat, “Then we shall have to summon him… however, forgive me if this sounds cruel but are you certain that he still wants you, sir?” John’s face flashed with anger at the very thought before pausing as he thought. The Prince continued. “I only mean to say, it wasn’t he who left you at the Fire Swamp? He looked rather put out by the whole affair. Would you say that your love is a man of pride?”
“Your true love lives! And you marry another. True Love saved her in the fire swamp, and she treated it             like garbage. And that's what she is, the queen of refuse. So bow down to her if you want, bow to her.        Bow to the prince of slime, the prince of filth, the prince of putrescence! I am old and life means nothing to me, so I am the only person in all this crowd to dare to tell truth, and truth says bow to the Prince of Feculence if you want to, but not I! BOO! BOO!”
The Count led John to the parapet the Prince stood, and the two faced the crowd side by side for the first time as their future leaders. The Royal Couple. The sight of this prompted a reaction John should have expected but still was blown away by - the entire square bowed to them. To him. He was their Prince. Florin loved him; and for the first time since Sherlock the prospect of love didn't turn him away.
Molly chuckled, sitting next to her with a tablet and glass of water. “You fell asleep, it's alright though. You're sick.”
“I don't like that this is how we must fight. So uncivilized, I might just let you pass if you hadn't harmed my friend.”
There was no denying the puppy dog eyes of Rosie Watson, everyone in the room knew it. In resignation, she glanced around the room again. “Where is he going to sit? Greg, if he is joining us.”
“You are fast.” Lestrade grunted as he turned to face him. An impressed smirk on his face as he cornered the man.
It seemed very possible. “I went back for you, and I heard that you…” he looked as if the words pained him to even think of.
Aunt Molly just chuckled. “I heard, lucky for you I had the Chickenpox myself when I eight. I missed Chrissy Pyle’s birthday party too. I was devastated. Felt like the end of the world.” She took at seat at the foot of her bed, looking a slight bit discomforted by being in Sherlock’s room. Understandable as is wasn't a room people saw often. Rosie shifted, sitting up a bit as Aunt Molly placed a hand to her forehead, “Still a bit feverish I see.”
John waited only a second to see if it would stir once more before rushing over, the sword resting in the Rodents’ corpse, towards Sherlock. Prying his hands away from his wounded shoulder. “Shit. You don't think it was diseased do you?” John asked aloud, trying to gather a sense of the severity of the wound. It had punctured his skin, but hadn't broken the through the otherside. Sherlock was able to move it enough to erase the possibility of it reaching the bone.
“Yes… now settle down. It's time for you to relax.” Molly began, smoothing the blankets around Rosie before putting on her storytelling voice, calming and clear. “This is a tale of Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, True Love, miracles....”
John couldn't recall Sherlock ever saying those words before, let alone touching him, he faltered only for a moment before answering, “You're welcome, just never almost freeze to death or fall off a ladder in winter again, got it?”
“You… you should.” Lestrade gasped, starting to feel the struggle as The Man in Black choked him. “You know, I haven't fought just one person in such a long time. I'm a bit unprepared.”
Together they were perfectly balanced, had they been on the same side the two fighters would have been unstoppable. Instead, the two moved against each other. Hearts pounding and sweat dripping from their brows; trying their best to out move the other - yet both not wanting the adrenaline rush of their dance to end. Irene swept at his feet with her own, staggering him slightly but blocking the blade that came to pierce him. It was exhilarating. The Man in Black returned the gleeful smile she wore on her face, yet a voice in the back of her head began to whisper.
“Then why do you hesitate to accept?” Prince James countered. “I am your Prince and I am not so bad, why would you rather death then becoming my consort?”
Even in the distance, John and Prince James could hear the agony in his voice as he struggled until the guards closed in around him and the horse vanished from sight. Count Charles watched the scene play out with an serene amusement on his face, in his head, the Prince’s hushed orders echoed:
“John!?” Sherlock wheezed next to him, he couldn't move just yet but John could hear him wince as he moved over to him. John opened his eyes to find Sherlock Holmes leaning over him, having looked better but very much alive and very much concerned for John.  He didn't know if he wanted to punch him or kiss him. Maybe both. He was overjoyed he was alive, he couldn't wait to kill him. “John, are you okay?! Speak to me.”
He stood rigid in his stance, the perfect vision of a soldier and leader, but lost in his eyes was an unsettled fear that could not be missed by either man. “I merely wonder if any word from your ships had come in.”
“A countryman?” John heard himself ask before he could stop himself, not wishing to his his captor any satisfaction in his knowledge of him. “How do yo-”
“I know who you are.” The Prince muttered, pulling his wrists away. The thought of Sherlock’s killer touching him (
Roberts. Once the crew was broken in and believed me Roberts, she left with her fortune to make a new life in peace and have been Roberts ever since. However, now that we are together again. I believe it is time for me to retire the name and hand it over to someone else. I’ve amassed enough of a fortune that would rival many a nobleman, if you don’t mind the downgrade from royalty.” There is a teasing wink in his eye that prompted John to give him a nudge of the elbow, still taking all of this in.
“Alright you lot, you heard Count Magnussen. The Thieves Forest is spilling out with criminals and with everything going on, orders are coming directly from the crown for us to take care of em’. You’ll be granted barracks space for the time you serve as well as two meals a day. You’ll get your gear at dawn. Try not to get yourself killed, or you’ll be answerin’ to me. Understood?”
The Man in Black looked up, voice deep and coated in a french accent of his own. “Bonjour madame, there is not much to complain about.”
John looked apologetically to her, attempting to coax his daughter back to where she had been resting prior to the outburst. “My apologies, Molly. It must be the fever- Rosamund Watson calm down and apologies for shouting, please.”
Molly understood her meaning, remember how she too had also exclaimed in horror every time her parents had been ‘mushy’ too. “Alright. You're sick, so I’ll humour you.”
“Twelve years ago. After Kate died, there was nothing holding me to that town so I took the sword and went around the world. Training with anyone who would teach me; practicing for the day in which I would meet the man again.” Irene’s voice took a cool edge, “So when next we meet, I will not lose. I will look him in the eye and telling (?)  him:
. “You killed the man I-” The word he had been about to say caught in his throat. He had never been able to say it to Sherlock, he could still remember Sherlock begging him not to say it until he returned lest he wouldn't go. There was no way John was going to say those words that belonged to Sherlock to
Sherlock watched as the odd man, Culverton it seemed, pulled his hungry beady eyes away from himself and obeyed the Count’s request. Count Charles waltzed over towards the table that Sherlock was strapped down to. He gazed at him, his eyes devouring him in a way that made the younger man feel greatly exposed. “Beautiful, isn’t it? The machine?” His eyes never left Sherlock. “Took me half a lifetime to invent it. I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. At present, I'm writing the definitive work on the subject, so I want you to be totally honest with me on how The Machine makes you feel.”
; a game in which she would collapse to the floor at random and only awake until someone gave her a kiss on the cheek or forehead.
. It was as if John had betrayed him somehow. John couldn't look at him any longer without feeling shame and utter humiliation. He quickly turned toward the door and ran out as fast as he could. Caring very little if anyone heard him; his days working here were likely numbered now anyway.
Sherlock turned to look at him incredulously, they were in one of the most dangerous places in their immediate world and John was glancing around as if they were in a mildly amusing shop. John felt the judgemental gaze, rubbing the back of his neck as he quickly added, “I’m not saying that I’d want to build a summer home here, but the trees aren’t actually too bad to look at. They’d be lovely in fact in other circumstances.”
It had been far too long since she had faced a worthy combatant; which was why she felt herself getting restless and wanting him to reach the top alive. After an hour of patience, Irene crouched down near the top and called out. “Bonjour monsieur, fine day isn't it?”
“As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Gilder knows what we've done, and no one in Florin could've gotten here so fast.” Hope admonished, pausing slightly before a quiver of doubt crept into his voice. “ But out of curiosity, why do you ask?”
“I'm awake. Promise… its just…” Rosie sighed, swallowing the tablet and chasing it down with a gulp of water as Molly tilt her head curiously.
I wasn't sure if it was clear or not, but King James the First is meant to be James Sholto whereas Prince James the Second is meant to be Moriarty.
rippled through the throng. Nobody really noticing that a newcomer had joined their ranks. Nobody really caring as long as they got their dues.
Lestrade found that he wasn’t fond of being on his own rather quickly. It took some effort, but the brute had managed to secure passage on a trade ship into Florin in exchange for assisting with the delivery of the merchant’s goods for the royal wedding. Despite the fact that Hope had been so adamant about killing the little prince, Lestrade couldn’t help but feel a wave of relief at the news that John had found his way home safely. He had liked the guy, for as much as one could get to know the man they were contracted to kill. Not many of the crewmen would interact with him, other than to bark orders.
It had all just been a dream. One of the many that had begun to plague him ever since his return to the Castle.
It wasn't until they were about half way up (or so he hoped they were, John really didn't want to look up and down much to find out for sure) that someone broke the silence. It was Adler and her words brought shock to everyone. “Look, below!” She said, a mixture of wary and impressive admiration in her half accented voice.
From the balcony above, the King gestured for his guards to move. Quickly they bustled out after the Prince and stood around him in a defensive measures. It felt a bit needless, as he watched two storm over to the woman to carry her away before John shouted. “Wait! Bring her to me!” He pushed himself out from the barricade of steel that surrounded him to face the woman as she was brought to his feet.
Taking a deep breath, John helped Sherlock rise to his feet once more. Cautiously, they scanned the trees above for anymore sneak attacks. Once satisfied, Sherlock pulled his blade free from the corpse. John instinctively guided him from behind, helping him steady himself as they ducked and stepped over roots and vines. Eventually, the trees began to thin. Pools of Snow Sand became scarce and the popping sounds of the fire traps became dull and eventually nonexistent. Eventually John felt himself able to relax as finally the Fire Swamp became exactly what Sherlock had claimed it would be - a memory. “We did it.”
Rosie nodded with a frown that Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to fight with today. If he argued it, then the tension from before would surely follow and the last he needed was more witnesses to such things. For now, he would play nice. “Sit with us!”
Molly considered this, she couldn't say she didn't disagree. She had been young when she first read the story, never considered it this way. Nostalgia blindness attributing to this. “So what you're saying that you like the story, but you need it tweaked.” She asked, an idea brewing in her head. Molly shifted further onto the foot of the bed, tucking her feet under. “Alright, lucky for you I know this story backwards and forwards, I can retell it to you.”
The brute reached into his side pouch, withdrawing a blue strip of fabric hesitantly. “It's a bit warm for it…”
The Prince placed a hand on John’s shoulder, seeming to read the air around him. In a rare moment of sympathy and concern, he offered him a small smile. “Don’t look so despondent, how about this? You will write four copies of a letter. We will send one upon each of my four fastest ships, sailing in each direction to find him. If this pirate wants you, then bless you both.” Prince James’ hand moved from his shoulder to tilt John’s face upward - leveling his eye with his. “If not, will you at least consider myself a reasonable alternative to suicide?”
“I’ll take the Prince.” Hope jerked him from Lestrade’s grasp. “You stay here and finish him. None of Adler’s honorifics this time, the last time I rely on the French to do something without a big production… just kill him. I’ll be waiting for you further down the path.”
The couple shared another embrace, one that lasted until they both lost track of how long they had been there. When it was time to part, Sherlock held his wrists in his hands. Feeling John’s heartbeat, steadying his own rate down till they were in sync.
“Oh I don't think so.” Sherlock stood in the doorway, looking at the two Watsons’ with an arched eyebrow. “Neither of you are fit to walk, and you can't take a cab or tube because you are contagious. Come now John, aren't you suppose to be a doctor?”
Discarding the cloak, John took the blade from Sherlock to allow the man’s nerves to settle once again. It was only when he began slashing at the vines that John realised he hadn’t held a sword since his days on the kingsguard. It was also the first time he allowed himself to admit that he had missed the feeling of a sword in his hands. “Alright, so we have some time now… I have some questions.”
No sooner had the words left his lips before something giant, brown frenzied creature leaped the tree above, fangs bared as it tackled Sherlock onto the swamp floor. John leaped back, avoiding being dragged down with them, only to see a Rat the size of a Wolf and as wild as a rabid animal locked in a physical fight with Sherlock. It's jaws snapped as Sherlock tried to keep them pried open, while avoiding losing his hands in the process. He grunted as its claws dug into his flesh as he tried to throw it off of him.
“The Dread Pirate Roberts. That's you, isn't it?” John replied. Not phrasing it as a question; but an accusation and daring the pirate to say otherwise.
He had to wait a moment before he received a response, the man caught his breath from his laughter. Clearly, this was something he had heard before. “You survived the Fire Swamp, I hear. I’ll give you that, that’s no easy feat. You must be very brave, Mr. Holmes, but nobody can withstand the Machine.” Sherlock frowned, as menacing as he made the
Dropping the crates in hand, he moved closer. Listening to the Six-Fingered Man’s speech, upon approach realising that he wasn’t speaking to the crowd per say, but rather a scrawny nervous but proud fella in the royal crest. Another important looking guy, one who seemed to be the leader of the rabble. The Six-Fingered Man gave a slight brush off before marching back into the castle, Lestrade was tempted to march after him right then and there. Crush him for the Woman herself, in her honour. Yet the Second Man had called for attention in a voice that sounded much bigger than his body looked.
Billy nodded with hesitation, creeping forward towards John as he smiled encouragingly. Prince John placed a hand on his shoulder. “Billy, I get scared too. In fact, when I was up there I was terrified until you waved at me.” His eyes still didn't met the Prince's fully, darting back and forth between them and the Opal ring.
“It’s all good news for me, either way… i’ll have lots to do. Be it whatever you all round up tomorrow, a Guildian soldier… or that man you brought back. The pirate, whatever his name is.”
Sherlock didn't look as relieved as as John felt, but his words tried to hide this. For him, he wasn't home free till they were away at sea once more.  “Now, was that so terrible?”
Prince James sat in long silence, his fiancé standing by and ready to help him at a moment's notice. While the Prince knew his woes didn't stem entirely from mourning; there was something undeniably charming about his husband-to-be’s unwavering loyalty. As the heir, Prince James had numerous things to attend to, so whenever he was pulled from John’s side - he could be found in the company of Queen Janine. He knew first hand her loss, and she was heartbroken over her husband; even if she conceded that it was better this way, as his suffering was at an end now. The days passed, slowly and all too fast, and before John knew it the day Florin’s 500th anniversary was upon him and he was no longer just the Prince's fiancé but his husband and Consort.
Molly sipped at the water John had gotten her. "We went to dinner around 8. He seemed really nice, really charming and interested."
John shuffled a bag of eyeballs over to make room for the milk on a low shelf. "Gads, that's disgusting. Yes, I wake up about half the time if it's just me." He thought for a moment about the times it'd happened with partners or in the barracks. "And I usually wake up if I'm with someone. Or at least I assume I do, clearly I can't always tell. Probably more like a 75% wake up rate with partners. Usually I wake up as I'm nearing orgasm, or if something jolts me -- a loud sound, or an unexpected movement, or pain, something like that." A quizzical look passed over Sherlock's face but John kept going. "Now that I'm out of the Army it's
When Sherlock woke up, really woke up, John's head was on the bed near his thigh, his hand next to Sherlock's. Sherlock observed him for a moment, listening to his soft snores, before deciding that he should wake him before he got a crick in his neck. He reached down, running his fingers through the short, light hair. When John stirred, he sat up, wiping nonexistent drool from his face and stammering apologies before eyeing him carefully. "How are you feeling?"
Sherlock stilled for a moment, not breathing, and turned slowly to face him. His voice dropped. “You bloody well know why it matters to me. Why it’s personally relevant.” They had never discussed it openly, but John knew, and Sherlock knew he knew. Thought he hadn’t cared. Thought …
John brightened at that, being Sherlock's first anything. "I'd be up for replicating it," he offered. "For science, of course." Sherlock pulled back, and John realized he was probably horribly uncomfortable in his sticky satin underwear. "Take me to bed," he commanded, allowing Sherlock to pull him up to a standing position.
John raised an eyebrow and reached down to squeeze Sherlock’s length for a moment before his hand was swatted away.
As predicted, Sherlock had cracked the case wide open the following day and had been absolutely buoyant when the kidnapper was dragged off in handcuffs. He hailed a taxi and pulled John into it, shouting vague promises about paperwork to Lestrade over his shoulder. They tumbled inside, smiling giddily, and Sherlock leaned in, raising his eyebrows and waiting. John realized that he had stuffed them into the cab in order to satisfy John's rule about PDA in front of Lestrade et al. He nodded and Sherlock rushed in with a crush of teeth and lips. John opened his mouth to tease a lick inside Sherlock's mouth, and was rewarded with a quiet hiss of "yessss" and then they were overtly snogging in the back of a taxi. After a minute or two, John pulled back, a little winded and nodded his head toward the driver to remind Sherlock that they were not alone. Sherlock didn't look like he cared at all about public displays of affection but he settled for resting his hand just a little too high up on John's thigh, lightly rubbing with his long fingers and giving John significant looks. John had to laugh and looked out the window for the remainder of the drive home.
Sherlock and John collected their toys and brought her an ice pack and paracetamol. ("Doctor's orders," John said. "You'll thank me tomorrow.") Sally and Greg covered her with an afghan so she wouldn't have to get up to get under the covers. Each pressed soft kisses to her cheek or her hair and as they were walking away, Molly murmured her thanks and rolled over to fall into her first contented sleep in ages.
"No, god no, that's not what I mean," John said in a rush. "It's just, you know." Sherlock held his gaze questioningly, and John faltered. "You-you're my best friend, and that's important to me."
Sherlock’s face broke into a wide grin. “I love you, too. Always will.” He kissed John one more time, then laid on his chest, listening as John’s strong heart slowed and his breathing deepened. Closing his eyes, he stroked John’s chest hair and drifted off into a perfect, dreamless sleep.
"My God, can you at least let me get the door shut before you start?" He closed it quickly and carried the grocery bags to the kitchen table. "You know this is actually none of your business."
Sherlock nibbled on his ear. "Of course. It's the least messy option. And besides, I haven't gotten to do you yet."
Sherlock's eyes were unreadable, his voice quiet. "The lesbian bar is on the other side. Separate entrance."
John sat up a bit, setting down his glass. “Sherlock, listen to me. You are not, nor have you ever been, my back up or my second choice. My James, the one that was alive in Afghanistan, was perfect for the person I was then, but you are perfect for me now. Yes,” he continued, seeing Sherlock’s mouth opening to protest,” --
Vincent sat back. "So why are you covering for him, if you're not together?" Sherlock's mouth opened to retort when Vincent got a look of amusement on his face. "He's not gay, but you are. You're in love with him and you want to protect him." The air had been sucked out of the room; no one spoke or breathed for several long moments as all three men tried to think of a way to laugh this off, preserve Sherlock's dignity with a kind lie. Vincent didn't give them a chance. "I was wrong. He's not the self-loathing one; you are. You ought to be ashamed."
Leaning his head back, John rinsed. "I'm getting fat," he protested, reaching up for another kiss. "Too much of takeaway and Mrs. Hudson's scones."
Sherlock tugged, and pulled John tight to his chest, and for the first time in ages John melted into him. Sherlock kissed his head and traced his fingers over his scalp as he weighed what to say next. “Tell me about him?”
Sherlock huffed dramatically. “What, and all that dirt under his fingernails just appeared there on its own? There’s no possible correlation between what’s in that dirt and his death? The nails are ragged; he chews them. Since there’s no external wound, we can certainly not rule out the possibility that whatever killed him was ingested through the soil, nor can we not rule out the possibility that that soil is THIS soil until you pretend to be competent for once and go get the bloody evidence collection kits, which I see you have forgotten again.” Anderson reddened. “Well don’t rush, we all know that evidence is best collected as slowly as possible following a crime.”
John looked down to where his thumb was rubbing circles on the back of Sherlock’s hand. “I still haven’t …”
Sally set the paper bag on the table audibly, let her footsteps fa more loudly than normal as she approached Molly. She laid a gentle hand on her shoulder, squeezing firmly when her touch was not rejected, and letting it linger for a few moments before dropping it. "This part sucks," Sally said fervently. "It's OK to go ahead and replay it in your head. That actually helped me a lot. After I stopped fighting it, anyway." She looked around. "Christ, I can't imagine getting attacked in your own home. Fucking awful."
Definitely wet now. Probably touching herself." He leaned his head back against the wall. He could picture it so clearly. Anthea would have locked the door and pulled her skirt up to slide her fingers under her panties. Sherlock swirled his tongue around him, applying just the right amount of suction, and John resolved to pay attention to his lover. He lifted his head again, looking down at Sherlock bobbing up and down on his cock. "God, that's amazing." He ran his fingers through Sherlock's curls before tangling his fingers in them and thrusting slightly. Sherlock winked up at him and leaned into the thrusts, letting himself gag a bit. "
John’s eyes were wide, and a bit wetter than normal, and his hands were trembling slightly. He noticed and folded them together, cleared his throat. “Thank you, Sherlock.” Otherwise, the men sat in tense silence until they arrived at Baker St.
Alright, so he'd given some thought to John's sexual experiences. But this new data, the confidence and skill with which John had gone down on him, caused a shift in his calculations. Lust ripped through him. "You've done this before," Sherlock purred in his ear, unable to keep the surprise out of his voice. Erotic images flooded his brain and he sucked and nipped at the younger man’s neck just below his ear as he rutted his painfully hard erection against his leg.
"I don't think he's American. More likely, one or both of his parents are expatriates, and he was raised here."
, it seemed to say. “I was in Uni, drinking a lot myself; sometimes with my teammates, sometimes with Dad. I was just starting to realize that the shit he was spouting off was not normal. The rugby guys would sometimes tease about so-and-so being a poof or whatever, but not … not the kind of shit Dad would say.”
John nodded, his face losing its menace. "Darling, I think Lestrade needs a bit more to do while you're sucking him off. Why don't you let him return the favor?"
John felt the anxiety tightening his stomach and saw that Sherlock was clenching his jaw. They looked at each other and had the same thought.
Sally nodded as she unloaded soups, breadsticks, and a big salad onto the table. "Yeah, that's familiar. Really, it's not even been two weeks. Maybe talk to John, see if you need to tinker with your dosage? You're going through a lot."
." He licked a stripe up John's shaft and heard a groan come from the top of the bed. "Not that I'm complaining, mind. It was sexy. Captain Watson, taking command." He tongued John's slit, lapping up a bead of moisture there. "But I think a little exploration is valuable, too."
Everyone looked at John with curiosity. "That's not justice," Vincent countered after a long moment.
wrapped around my fingers. Love watching you tremble and writhe.” He brushed Sherlock’s prostate once again, for emphasis, and grinned at Sherlock’s needy whine and bucking hips.
It turned out that Sherlock had actually been researching that whole time. He'd found the most likely culprit (a new server who had a very sketchy private investigator Sherlock knew by reputation as a reference) and deduced the cause of death (bacteria on the knife, causing systemic infection and multiple organ failure). Lestrade and Donovan ran off in a flurry of activity, calling Molly to find out what type of bacteria it was and who was at risk for contracting it.
Sherlock kissed the words off his mouth, and John tensed slightly before relaxing with what seemed like deliberate effort. Sherlock pulled back, keeping his face playful. "When you're me, you learn that it's smart to build up credit with people you know you'll annoy later. Come. You might as well take a Flexaril and some ibuprofen while you're up."
Now that he’d started explaining, he seemed unable to stop; Sherlock thought that he’d probably never spoken of any of this to anyone. “So I did. I smashed in his shop window and spraypainted slurs on his door, but he didn’t leave. Actually, he ended up with more business because of the news coverage.” He smiled ruefully. “Dad wasn’t pleased, said I hadn’t done enough. So I …” He finally fell silent. “Well, you read the reports.”
Molly handed them over reluctantly. Honestly, she wanted to stand here and collect her thoughts a bit, but Sally was all business. She unlocked the front door efficiently and strode through it confidently. "Keep up, Hooper."
Finally, Sherlock stilled for a minute, allowing his body weight to push John as far into him as possible. Then he craned his neck down for a soft kiss before breaking away, pulling John forward a bit so he could wrap his arms around him, nuzzling the side of his sandy head, and whispering,
Exhaling her relief, Molly fixed a cup of tea and sipped it as she packed. She desperately wanted to stay. Being at Baker Street had meant safety and comfort and companionship. She couldn't bear the thought of going back to her lonely flat and facing it all again.
If you find the topic of suicide triggering, please don't read on. (I 100% guarantee John will live to the end of this.)
John smiled, holding the shot glass for a moment as he took in Sherlock's clear invitation. "Cheers," he said, clinking glasses before tossing back the shot. The sweet whiskey burned pleasantly down his throat and when he licked his lips, he saw Sherlock watching the movement.
Sherlock’s heart slowed, and his breath regulated, and John’s firm pressure was sliding away, and then he was empty. He shivered. “But you didn’t finish,” Sherlock protested sleepily. Suddenly, danger prickled at the edges of his brain.
His thoughts were impeded by the feeling of being pushed down, landing roughly on a rock. Confused before he heard The Man in Black’s baritone cut through the silence life a knife. “Catch your breath.” he demanded, not even giving the dignity to look at him as he did.
His blade work was precise, he must have been practicing since a young age. Moving with mostly muscle memory and less active thinking. His footwork was noted too, but perhaps less refined than his arms. As if they wanted to take off and run without the rest of him, anxious and itching to go. Irene’s feet were more controlled, more calculated yet what she made up for there was lost in the arm work. She had to still think, he had years of refinement where she did not. A touch too slow to actually hit him, yet watching him move was a great teacher.
Please note that while Molly is technically basing her version of the original book; it will flip back and forth a bit. Drawing inspiration from both variations of the story.
Hope wasted no time, the moment he was free from his harness he pulled a knife out of his pocket. Sawing the rope they had used off the makeshift anchor that John felt grateful in not knowing to just be another rock before reaching the top. Had he known fear of a rockslide as well of falling were in the cards, he might had passed right out. With a final
The world seemed to slow. He saw how close to the edge of a steep slope they had become. Intense fury towards the man in front of him spilled out. He had killed Sherlock  and then stood and mocked him for it.
She was already dueling this man so it seemed pointless to ask, and while his face was partially obscured he didn't look old enough for the character. However, habit dictated she asked him anyway. “I don't mean to pry, but do you happen to have six fingers on your right hand?”
The Man in Black listened, seemingly genuinely interested in this tale. “Did Kate not succeed?” he asked tentatively.
He continued, "Then Rosamund explained to me that it was the name that inspired the fear, it was the myth and the legend. Nobody would surrender to the Dread Pirate Sherlock, they’d laugh themselves to death. So after I accepted, we made for port and took on an entirely new crew. Rosamund, serving as my first mate under the name Mary, all the time calling
“Of course, I mean it would probably be best to avoid addressing me as such in front of my parents or other staff but…” Sherlock took a breath, his fingers pinching the bridge of his nose as headache began to stir. “...I really don't mind. You are my friend after all.”
Also you haven't seen the deleted scenes from HIS LAST VOW, then Sherlock and Magnussen's scene might feel strange to you without the context. I recommend checking it out on YouTube. It's all kinds of creepy and unsettling.
“I never said he was that.” John spoke harshly and immediately. Realising how terrible it must have sounded, but he saw no reason to lie to the pirate. Besides, something told John that the man would likely know if he did. “He’s not, my ‘dearest love’ that is, and yes he will come for me. That I know.”
The brunette gave the chief an undignified gesture in response, “SO DID HOPE,” her tone forceful, “He said go back to the beginning. So I have come back to the beginning. I am not moving! I am staying until L… Hope… Till Hope comes back.”
The man paused, angled his head toward John so that he could properly see his eyes. Those damn eyes that seemed to shift colours between blue, green and gold. His face, sharp and long, with cheekbones that were defined and almost feminine in shape.  It was in that moment John realised how beautiful he was. Lord, was he beautiful. He shouldn't be, but somehow he defied his features and was so anyway. It was almost too much to comprehend, John felt his stomach twist at the thought. It was as if he were a mere mortal witnessing a god.
The Man in Black jumped, turning towards the direction it was thrown from. From behind a formation, Lestrade walked out. Another small boulder in one hand, ready to throw. Within seconds, The Man in Black drew his sword and stood ready to move.
...coincidences were not something Lestrade believed in. No, no. He believed that everything happened for a reason. The Six-Fingered Man, Prince John… and, was he referring to the Man in Black? No. He could read the signs. Everything was coming together for a purpose. Perhaps it was influenced by the drink, but for the first time in awhile, Gregory Lestrade felt hopeful. Everything was coming to head, he just had to wait for Irene.
Hope growled. “It's no concern of ours!” Lestrade sighed and went to rejoin Adler on the upper deck. Hope settled on the ground next to John. Snide smirk on his lips. “I suppose you think that was very brave, don't ya?”
Adler gave him a smile of genuine amusement, before turning her head back to the horizon. John’s eyes instinctively followed her gaze where he could see that the ship she had spotted the night before was still in pursuit. “Greg, Hope - look, he is right on top of us!” She bellowed, startling John with the abruptness of her shout.
The sounds of cheer and laughter faded as the horn salute began cascading in the air, drawing the attention of the onlooking crowd to the parapets where King James II now stood in all his regal glory. He didn’t need to see him to know it was true.
The Square was bursting with life and excitement; the Reds and Golds of Florin hung on every banner and each flag that billowed in the breeze as the springtime sunshine shone over the Kingdom. Trumpets filled the air as up from his parapet, Prince James stood as regal as ever. King James and Queen Janine stood behind him. The Queen offering the ailing King as much support as she could muster; the man refusing to use the aide of a cane - the fear of looking weak to his people to great. Prince James was dressed in his finery, crown adorning his head as the colours of his Kingdom covered his body. This was the moment, the one they had been preparing for.
The Prince cleared his throat, turning his head to fully meet his captor's gaze for the first time. “Regardless of what you think, you will be caught and when you are you’ll all be hanged for treason, I’d reckon.”
“Yeah well, all things considered, can't complain much. Least I got my health.” Prince John smirked darkly.
The chief drew himself up higher, feeling suddenly vulnerable about his neck and it’s current placement on his shoulders. “Very well, take me to her. Move!”
They were toying with each other, testing the waters. Their blades flirting with each other, teasing as they clashed.  A worthy opponent - not something to be wasted. Irene had spent her days in recent years with low life's who couldn't tell which end of the sword was the pointed one. Yet now, she felt her heart speed up. Her attentions demanded in full, she inhaled sharp breaths as the dance continued - but was satisfied to see The Man in Black do the same.
The shouts could be heard even miles off from the woods; the thieves were furious. Swords clashing, an occasional gunshot and the whinnying of horses. The Brute Squad had arrived at the first break of dawn, and the thieves in question were far from pleased by it. It was well past noon by now, the wedding was hours from now at sundown, but Dimmock was beginning to worry about finishing up in time.
The Fire Swamp was a place of legend in both Guilder and Florin, it haunted the nightmares of every child who feared their parents sending them to such a nightmarish place if they misbehaved too greatly. Such sayings were commonplace in many households, wary threats when children toed bad behaviour. Even Lady Holmes had used such a phase on occasion when Sherlock and his brother had been younger - the prospect had unnerved Sherlock but he had remained stiff upper lipped on the subject to match the apathy his older brother had felt toward it.
A place this large and expensive, needed a lot of space. He could distinguish through sound alone that there were many floors to this place. Six if he had to guess, but he couldn’t be certain without further data. No building like this could be spotted on the surface of Florin, Sherlock would have noticed. Anyone with eyes would have noticed a mysterious six plus floored tower in the middle of the countryside.  The cool damp nature of this place left only one solution - he was underground.
“I will miss you too.” Sherlock pulled away, withdrawing from his fiancé’s embrace. Reaching to his lapel, Sherlock unpinned a small brooch, blue gemstone that reminded him of the ocean. “I don't have a ring, but I hoped this would serve as an acceptable substitute. The colour made me think of you.”
Prince James languished uninterested in all his plans, looking the part of the concerned husband-to-be, before looking up with perked interest by a knock at his door. The figure slender but obedient figure of Chief Enforcer Dimmock stood erect and not at all as desperate for approval as James knew him to be. An arm motioning for him to come join him, the picture of serious concern. Without hesitating, Dimmock took large strides over to the desk where His Highness sat and gave a gracious bow.
Lestrade smirked, “Ah, that explains it…” he answered with slight amusement, looking between him and Sherlock as if they were two children caught sneaking a peek at their Christmas presents. “I was wondering where you two buggered off to. You both vanished from the Crime Scene… not that it's uncommon but what was uncommon was the text that John sends to let me know you're both still alive never arrived.”
In truth, nothing but his anxieties about the unpleasant discussion coming up (if, Sherlock even allowed such a conversation to occur, as he seemed very keen on reaching his boat before he had a chance to even formally break it off - something John would have to talk to him about) gave John reason to believe the Prince held any true malice or would lash out violently upon the news.
: Sherlock could smell rotting flesh. The place reeked of death; based on what was in store for himself that didn’t seem too surprising. This ‘Zoo’ must have seen countless loss of life; not all human but animal too.
He tried hard to focus on his work, but the involuntary grunts Sherlock made as he whipped the riding crop against his inanimate victim kept drawing his attention. The nobleman had discarded of his jacket, his long angular frame struck out through the clothes that no matter how tailored always seemed too big for him. The sunlight that shone through the work shed, highlighted the pale and almost marble like quality of his skin. His hair, wild in dark curls on his scalp that bounced in every move he made.
Gathering his breath, the Man in Black tore off down the path once again --- hoping his next challenge would be less physical than the others.
Prince James watched as his betrothed paced in front of his desk; Count Charles sitting at a small table by the window, doing his best display of
He couldn't waste too much time, he doubted Hope would linger too long if he felt his co-workers this dispensable. The Man squeezed his eyes shut, before slowly sitting up once more. He turned to his side, reaching of Lestrade’s wrist; there was still a pulse but he doubted he would be awaking anytime soon.
The Woman rushed forward, the aging man hobbling slowly after her. “Oh monsieur, merci monsieur! We ‘ave been travelling such a long way. My père, he iz old and weary and we haff found ourselves lost!!” The woman explained, desperation clung to her every word.
Sherlock often made quite a show of ordering him about, getting him to do the strangest tasks for him as he did observed. Usually with little explanation before a luminous look filled his eyes as something John couldn't see clicked. It also never seemed to matter what tasks John was doing, he could be mucking stalls or polishing saddles, and Sherlock would flounce in as if unaware he had a job outside of serving him.
. He shot an almost intrigued look to Count Charles before both men’s eyes cast towards the food itself.  He could see the imprint of the mysterious fifth man on the ground opposite Hope. In the dirt discarded was an empty vial. Prince James withdrew his gloves and slid them on before picking it up. He brought it to his nose and took a slight sniff ---
“Rosie has a rule.” Molly explained, a humourous look passing between herself and the patient.  “Now, if I may without further interruption...”
Yet, John couldn’t help but wonder if sometimes they sounded closer rather than further. He debated bringing this up, but he wasn’t fully confident in his senses at the moment. Now that the immediate dangers had passed, he was beginning to feel his adrenaline drop and his weariness take over once again. It was possible that his mind was playing tricks on him. This theory was quickly disproven, only moments later, the gurgling pop sounded right next to him which was quickly followed by a tower of flame shooting up next to him. John lept back, but not in time to pull his cloak out of the literal line of fire in time. “Argh!” he exclaimed as Sherlock ripped the inflamed material from his back with a rip.
From behind the trees, the royal guard came into view, armed and surrounding them. A couple of horses came into view, Count Charles and Prince James rode into view. The Prince held a face of victory as he bore his gaze into Sherlock with a twisted venom. “SURRENDER!
Perhaps it was the saddened look on Lestrade’s face as he reached the same conclusion John had. Adler was out and the mysterious Man in Black gained.
name…. Holmes. Yes, he has been quite impressive… but then again, after the chase he gave us all for the Prince, is that really surprising? A shame his family’ll never know their youngest lived.”  The Count smirked before walking into the dark thickness of the tree cluster. The shadows concealing where they went, but Lestrade was certain he could hear the sound of something outside of nature moving.
he was about to add before feel the room grow uncomfortably silent. John felt the eyes of everyone in the room looking away.
” John’s heart winced, heartbroken at how easy it was to imagine Sherlock saying and thinking these things. Once again, he was reminded of his pleas to not say it. To make it possible for him to go, to give them a chance at a proper life together when he returned. His eyes cast down, letting them wash over him as Roberts continued.
His lips parted as if to object before the older Watson beat him to it. “Don’t be silly, Sherlock. It’s
John wasn't certain if he felt he should wait, not when he didn't know how long Sherlock would be gone for, but the desperation in his finacé’s voice convinced him not to push the matter. “But you do?”
Prince James smirked, but his face was cold and unattached. “Quite. You know, when I hired Hope and his troupe to kill him after allowing the kingdom to fall in love with him - I thought that was clever. However, imagine how much more
, that had not been a pleasant experience but he felt justified when he noticed his fiancé attempting to hide how stiff and sore he was becoming from this endeavour. John looked at Sherlock, wishing he had the time to patch them both up properly like when they had lived at Musgrave Hall. The two of the always getting into mischief of Sherlock’s design. On more than one occasion, John had made comment about how truly unfair it was that he often was injured just as much as he, when all he had wanted was to stop the lad from accidentally killing himself.
“Only Lestrade is strong enough to go our way.” Adler called back, for John’s benefit as he realised by her eyes meeting his as Hope hoisted him up to his feet, leading him over to the ropes. Her lips were freshly painted and hair still swept cleanly despite spending a night at sea. “The pursuer will have to sail a bit till he finds Harbour.”
John laughed. “I thought you had other plans for this evening, gorgeous. I was rather looking forward to them.”
"I know you're taking my pulse, Sherlock." John slid his tongue along Sherlock's lower lip. "Stop deducing me." Sherlock slid the hand back up John's thigh and let it rest there until he pulled it into his lap.
He propped himself up on his hands  to watch himself pushing into John's mouth, but it was hard to get leverage from this position. John, seeming to see the problem at the same time, pulled off and sat back on his heels so Sherlock could tuck his feet under him and pull himself up to a kneeling position. John got on all fours and opened his mouth, peering up at him impishly and waiting expectantly.
Sherlock downed half of his new glass with a series of quick sips. John smiled at him. “Do you ever get the feeling that Angelo understands us better than we do? He had us figured out the first time he laid eyes on me. It’s like he has some special John-and-Sherlock superpower.”
John eyed him shrewdly. "I think you want to see that you've tried them all. You're creating a menu." Sherlock opened his mouth indignantly, but John forestalled him. "Come here, you nutter," he said affectionately, pulling him closer and kissing him warmly.
John moaned, and stroked his tongue along Sherlock’s frenulum a few times, keeping his touches light and teasing. He traced a vein along his shaft, keeping it soft and sloppy, spreading saliva everywhere. After swirling around the head of his cock a few times, he sunk down to take Sherlock into his mouth. This elicited a hum, which buzzed just next to his opening, which made him moan around Sherlock’s cock, and the whole moaning cycle repeated itself.
to suck cocks. Her mouth is too small to take it very deep, but she uses her hands to work the shaft. At the end, she sucked on just the head while she stroked me off. Milked it right out of me and swallowed it with a grin. She had come dripping down her chin afterward."
Sherlock waved him off, pulling him up by his good arm. "I have. In the sewing kit in the closet." John sighed and shook his head but didn't argue with Sherlock about his ill-gotten prescription drugs.
The following day, she was pinching the bridge of her nose, squeezing her eyes shut against the light of the room. "I'll tell the others. Your flat, this evening."
John nudged him with his toes and smiled his sad, but-that’s-all-behind-us-now smile. “You couldn’t have known. It was eerily similar, though. I suppose I have a type.” He shook his head. “I always thought that when I got back to London, we’d be together, but he never even visited me in hospital when I first returned. He was notified, I know he was. I resented him a long time over that, but we started emailing and calling each other some when you were gone. He said he knew he was no good for me the way he was since returning, and that he couldn’t bear to have something and then lose it again. And I was scared of that, too. Nearly did me in the first time around. But I always hoped that he’d get help, get better, and things would be different.”
Heart thudding against her ribs, Molly slowly stepped in the door, jumping slightly at the sound of Sally closing and locking the door. She turned around, looking at the wall she could still feel herself getting pushed against. Remembered the feeling of his slimy tongue in her mouth. She held her arm, remembering how he had wrenched it behind her, ignoring her cries for him to stop.
