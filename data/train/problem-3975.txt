Nat manages a small smile. He says, “I brought Kelly a bottle of akvavit, because she may be the only person I know besides my sister who likes it.” He reaches into a canvas shopping bag and pulls it out.
“Yeah, that was too much money, shopping and wrapping,” says Sam. “I think a splurge this year was good, but we should cut back next year.”
Jack adds, “We haven’t met her yet, but she’s pre-law.” Sam makes a thumbs up and Eileen laughs at him, shaking her head.
Between the pledging process, school, and practice the boys were all very busy. Dean was starting to worry as they moved through February. Cas was seeming very stressed and tired. Any time Dean brought it up though Cas tried to brush it off. Dean didn’t know what to do, normally it was Cas helping him sort through things. He felt really shitty that he was at a loss.
As Dean made a second trip down Cas’s body, Cas whispered his name as he avoided his crotch once more.
Cas pulled out his tablet and opened up the web browser. They decided they wanted to join a Fraternity. They’d been approached by quite a few of them but Cas wanted to do research before they joined one.
A pillow suddenly came sailing from the bed at him. “Damn it sammy, too early for your yelling,” dean growled now half sitting.
“Right. So I’ve been working on figuring out what I want to do. I talked with my parents and the counselors. My parents just tell me do what makes me happy and the counselors seem to be trying to steer me toward sticking with football and making a career around that.” Dean sighed. Cas gently rubbed his back, he was well aware that Dean was weary about that route. There were so many if’s and Dean wasn’t sure if that life style would suit him. “So….I called your dad last night.”
Like his football playing boyfriend Castiel had also unknowingly left a few broken hearts in his wake.
“Dean,” Cas whispered as Dean’s hand slowly moved to the inside of his thigh. “I thought you wanted to watch this?” Dean had suggested a movie for one of their study breaks. Dean had made sure they were both taking breaks and staying as healthy as two teenage boys could be in college. He had to admit that Dean had really gone above and beyond for him.
Cas understood that, that's why his heart swelled with the same emotion as Dean. He didn't care that dean didn't use the word love, because he didn't need to understand human emotion or words for this. He didn't need to understand a single human emotion to know what he felt for Dean because what he felt was beyond that.
He could tell she was trying hard to stay calm for him. He nodded but soon realized she couldn’t see so he answered her. His dad was upstairs but he couldn’t waste anytime so he called him as he got into the car. He told his dad to stay home and he’d keep him updated. Bart had been reluctant but agreed in the end.
“Pssh, we don’t have embarrassing photos we have mushy ones.” Dean teased and yanked Cas back down to get another hour or two of sleep.
One more kiss before Dean helped Cas into his coat and took his hand as they left the room to head to the diner.
Castiel’s hands moved gently to Dean's sides. He felt the taunt muscle under the elder Winchester many layers. Castiel would like to grumble about too many layers but he wasn't much better. His hands slowly snaked around to dean's back. A soft moan left his mouth, he practically melted as he felt the hard toned muscles of Dean's back. He felt the twitch of a smile against his lips. Dean had liked that moan.
“Your parents are out getting food. Sam is at my house. My family is going to come visit later. I am going to text the guys and let them know you’re awake. Charlie isn’t back home yet but she’ll visit the second she’s in town.”
Cas held out for about an hour before even the noise canceling headphones Gabe bought him couldn’t drown out the loud arguing. Cas wasn’t quite sure what he ended up yelling at Alan, he was blinded by rage. It was loud and probably mean but Cas had had it. Normally he’d storm off to Dean’s but he wasn’t there and neither was Ash. Cas found himself sitting in the common room of their building and curled up on the couch. He carved out a corner for himself and got to work.
“No, you’re done for the night. I love you so don’t get mad when I say this but you’re a mess right now.” Cas frowned but he knew Dean was right. “We’re gonna pack up. Go to our 24hour diner, get some food and get you to eat a real meal. Don’t think I haven’t noticed how little you eat recently. Then we’re gonna get some paper and download one of those fancy apps for your phone and we’re gonna plan the heck out of the rest of the semester and the next.”
They then headed over to TΔK next. The second they stepped up to the building they were very impressed. Cas could see Dean was really liking what he saw. It seemed like the front facade had a colonial house style with a wide front porch. The building went much further back then they first realized.
A smirk appeared on Sam's lips. He peeked over the toast. “Boyfriend?” Another pillow flew at him. He dodged it and slammed the door shut. Through the door they heard him shout, “fucking called it.”
“I want to do this Dean,” Dean looked up at the ceiling as he collected his thoughts. His boyfriend was stubborn as fuck, and he knew he wouldn’t let this go.
Somehow that entire exchange was either ignored or unseen by the girls because once they joined everyone else a few girls came over and tried to flirt with them. They were doing their best to try and get them to stop but they weren’t being taken seriously. That is until a few of the guys walked over.
Dean surprised Cas first thing in the morning with a beautiful bouquet. Cas had to walk into his first class with it.  He was beaming in pride at all the envious looks he’d gotten. Dean had made a replica of the bouquet from last year and Cas was absolutely in love with it.
He was quickly introduced to Dean. As the name left Cas’s lips the man remembered all the times Cas had mentioned him. Thinking back over the conversations now he couldn’t believe how he’d missed all the signs. The affection in Castiel’s tone as he mentioned Dean not to mention how frequently he mentioned Dean. The signs were there he just hadn’t paid attention.
They hurried out and slipped on their swim trunks before the rest of the party goers came out. The other guys took their time, they didn’t mind the ogling. If Dean from a few years ago were here he’d probably be doing the same, but Dean now didn’t have eyes for anyone else but the guy standing in front of him. He chuckled as Cas dried off his hair only to leave it sticking up in all directions. Dean reached over and ran his fingers through the unruly locks getting them slightly under control.
“Mrs.Winchester?” He looked at the time, it was two am, Dean should have been home around twelve thirty.
Sorry I took so long to get this one up. It's been very hectic as of late. I am busier with normal. I think until I finish up with DCBB and probably retail holiday season there maybe a week or two where I have to take breaks. My main goal is to post weekly but occasional I may need to take a week off. ;-;
Cas closed his eyes and listened to the hunters soft breathing, his heart beat. He felt the rise and fall of his chest. It was relaxing, calming, practically meditative. It let his mind relax and for a few moments forget about the mess that was the outside world. It let him  for a little while, focus on the tiny world that was just him and Dean.
Oh Dean did not like this. Especially not when the guys next to Elliot looked like they were holding back smiles.
Thank you so much for sticking around guys, it means so much. I hope I can get to everyone's comments soon and get you guys some destiel fluff  ^-^ 💙💚
“Alright Cas why don’t you call Dean’s coach, he’s going to need to know.” Cas nodded, he was already thinking about that but didn’t know if he should call so early in the morning. But, the sooner the better.
“Mmmm,” cas nodded with a serious look on his face. That made sense. His barista friend had seemed very shy when he first met him, he stumbled over his words a bit the first time they spoke.
Been a little under the weather this week but I am getting stuff done. Drawings for DCBB and this chapter. Even got some writing on an idea I had for a different Destiel story.
“Hey brotha’,” Benny’s voice rumbled through the phone Dean held up to his ear. He was currently sitting at a table outside waiting for Cas to get out of class.
Cas felt his throat tighten up as they walked. He knew John had just said that so he could get through but it meant so much to him that he did that. He knew what a huge thing that was for John to do. They entered a small waiting room. Mary was in the corner speaking softly into her phone. Sam was curled up in a chair asleep. Cas stood near the entranced and dropped his head. He was so scared, he didn’t want to break down but he was so worried. A gentle hand dropped down on his shoulder. He looked up to see Mr.Winchester standing in front of him looking worried and understanding.
Hey guys hope you liked this chapter. This was supposed to go up last week but IRL stuff got crazy. Back in sept I believe my store got a new manager and it's been so stressful. it was getting very bad. Then two weeks ago she got moved to a new store and the new manager is great. She's so opposite the old one it's feeling like whiplash, but things are doing better. That last store manager almost had me going on my anxiety meds after not needing them for 2 years. I am feeling much more creative now and much less stressed. I even spoke with my district manager today about the issues me and my team had had.
“I love you too, so you better take care of yourself because I plan on keeping you for a very very long time.”
A girl in one of Dean’s classes had fallen for his general kindness and instinctual need to help people. It started when he helped her pick up her stuff when her bag fell and all it’s contents ended up all over the ground. She took a chance and sat next to him. Dean,the ever charismatic and friendly one, spoke to her and befriended her. To him that was all it was, friendship. At one point she mentioned needing help with a test and Dean said he knew the perfect person. Looking back she realized the misunderstanding was solely on her part. She read too much into something that wasn’t there.
“Dat’s good tah hear. I know his Daddy and siblin’s were pretty worried. Your Ma was pretty worried too.”
The phone call went better than he expected, Coach was a little grumpy but understanding. He grumbled and growled about stupid drivers and he hoped the guy got what he deserved. Coach told Cas to tell Dean not to worry about his spot on the team, just to recover and come back when he was cleared. Cas was so grateful, with so many players vying for the spot he was worried Dean would lose it. However, Dean had shown his skill on the field and that had secured him his spot.
I am glad I was finally able to get this specific chapter out. The hospital scene was actually part of the original plan for the story. it was a big scene for Cas and John and went through a few variations but at it's core stayed the same. Don't worry about Dean he'll be fine lol.
Dean was well aware of his good looks. However he wasn’t egotistical about it. He had his insecurities and was rather modest at his core. Castiel was less aware of his universally good looks. The only thing he knew about his looks were that his boyfriend thought he was the most amazing looking guy around, honestly it left him flustered and happy.
“I need to see Dean Winchester. He was brought in from a car accident.” Cas was doubly lucky to not have to wait in line.
“I know but… but now we can see an end. Before there was the chance of it never ending.” He sighed. “It’s gonna suck.”
Dean groaned in pain as he woke up. He felt like he’d been through hell, back and then some. He tried to open his eyes but everything was too bright.
“We could go as Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne.” Dean grinned knowing it wouldn’t be over the top and comfortable.
“God,” Cas whispered. Cas kept his eyes on the roof of the sorority house in front of them. Never in a million years would he have imagined himself standing naked next to his boyfriend in the backyard or a sorority house about to jump into a pool with his future fraternity brothers. He just knew that water was going to be cold. Not to mention why were they subjecting these women to this? He didn’t understand all these odd traditions.
Castiel saw the jaw tick. He didn't know what Dean was building up to, but he knew he was pulling something up from deep inside. Feelings were always a hard subject for the older Winchester. The words never flowed as freely as they did for Sam. But when they did, they truly meant something deep and lasting. So Cas stayed quiet and waited. Waited for Dean to find the words and take the time he needed to pull these feelings up. Feelings he'd trained himself his whole life to bottle up. Good and bad. He gave Deans forearm a gentle squeeze, a sign that he was here for him. Accepting, open and patient.
“I ain’t going anywhere anytime soon. Way too young and way too much to do.” He gave Cas’s had a squeeze. Cas gave him a teeny tiny smile, it was like the sun came out to Dean.
Cas nodded, that could work. He began scrolling through online stores for a pin. Etsy would probably be his best bet.
Thank you for being so patient with me so far. It's been a while since I've posted and I apologize for not getting to you guys sooner. I've been having trouble writing and drawing as of late. I am upset with myself, I love writing this story and I love drawing.I had so many art ideas and I have the entire story, part 3 and the spin off all planned out It's just fleshing it out the story that I have left. I've been trying to write it out but it seems more like I am taking steps back than taking any forward. So I am going to take a break and not force myself to write or draw anything. Just do things outside of writing and drawing and if the inspiration comes I'll create when I can but for now I am not going to make myself post something. I feel like I could be giving you much better chapters and I want to. So for now the story will be paused but hopefully be back soon. You guys are the best and you've been so supportive I hope I can be back soon with more for these boys. ^-^ If all goes well I hope to talk to you all very soon.
I wondering if I should change the schedule posting to Sunday 12pm or see how the next couple weeks go.
Hey guys hoped you like this chapter. I've had this idea in my head for a long time now and was looking for the right spot to put it in. It's much shorter that any other chapter i've written for this story but I had fun with it. Now if anyone didn't like it no worries, this was the only chapter I had in mind like this.
“Glad they could make it down.” Dean wrapped an arm around Cas’s shoulders. A few guys they knew from classes said hi to them as they made their way to the kitchen. Once they got there they saw Michael with a completely different girl. Gadreel still had the girl clinging off his arm but a guy was making moves on him.
“I do.” Dean grinned and pulled out some folders from his bag and placed them on the table. Cas leaned in and read the handwritten labels on them. Each one had a different major and inside had lots of information both written and printed.
“See yah Benny.” No way in hell either of them was gonna say they missed each other, because no chick flick shit here.
Dean took to making drinks for their group and company. Cas knew they should pace themselves better but he was in such a good mood having their friends here and it being their one year anniversary he couldn’t help but indulge a bit. At one point Michael got up on a table and made everyone take shots in celebration of Dean and Cas’s one year.
They boys had gotten pretty good at focusing in on work. Dean would get distracted or need to take breaks more often than Cas. It worked though. Cas kept Dean on task and Dean got Cas to remember to take time to step away.
“Okay, okay.” He got up and pulled Cas to his feet. He clicked the save button on Cas’s computer and closed it.
He had tests and assignments to get to. Probably more work than Dean realized. He sighed and typed away. He was about an hour into his work when his phone went off. It was a Dean. He smiled and answered the video call.
The second they walked through the doors Dean ordered two coffees and went and got them a corner booth. Cas didn’t start speaking in full sentences until he drank all of his coffee and made it halfway through a second.
I am back, sorry I was gone for so long. I didn't not plan on going this long without an update. Hope you guys like it ^-^
“I need to see him,” Cas was near tears, should he lie? How much trouble would he get into? Did it matter?
“You’ve been doing your research.” Cas felt a swell of pride for Dean. This was important to his boyfriend and he loved seeing him working hard towards his goal.
"Hmmm Michael just texted me." Cas said picking up his phone. "Oh he's making plans with Gad about Thanksgiving. " Cas paused as he read through the incoming messages. "He said if we were heading home maybe we could take the trip together. They could take the train down here and then drive with us there and back." Cas looked to Dean to see how he felt about it.
Now on the USC campus there are many students some more known than others and some more known than they realize. Dean and Cas aren’t the most well known students but people from different circles know of them. The two however don’t realize their own popularity. There is chatter in the sports circles about the surprisingly talented freshman players. A couple of Castiel’s professors speak of his promise, Dean has a professor sings his praises always happy that Dean speaks up more than any of his other students. And of course, both of them have caught more than one persons attention with their looks and personalities.
This chapter was actually supposed to go over finals and christmas but I could pass up some football. Not as detailed as usual but it was fun none the less. It was a lot of fun adding in new friends for the guys. I've been dying to add in Max for a while now.
“Oh and let us not forget moving into the house.” The three were moving in that week. Dean was ready to check that off the list.
Some of you might know I worked in retail for quite some time. I hit my 5year anniversary at my job in 2020. It was so stressful last year running a store during all of this. I did it and the store did well. I was up for promotion. All that was left was to check the boxes and send out the emails. But, at the last second they gave my store to someone else, told me to wait. (they'd made promises they couldn't keep and figured i would be the one to put up less of a fight) That was the final straw. So two weeks before black friday I put my two weeks in. It was the best decision ever. I've seen an uptick in my physical and mental health since i left. My new job makes me less money but I am in a much better place now. It's been rough but we've been making our way. I've started an online shop and taking time to do things I never had the time to do before.
“I know,” Cas ran his hand through Dean’s hair. “My uncle said he’d send you an advanced copy of the next book when he gets them.”
Cas yawned as he rested his head on Dean’s lap. He was looking at his tablet scrolling through amazon.
“That makes sense.” Cas gave his attention back to Dean. “So are you sure you don’t want to try and fly home for winter break?”
He watched as Cas stared at him and then his expression softened. It seemed like the tears were flowing free tonight. Those beautiful blue eyes were in tears again but these were different. Filled with so much affection and appreciation. It warmed Dean over knowing someone like Cas loved him.
“He’s going to be okay,” His voice had taken a fatherly tone Cas wasn’t sure he’d ever heard the man use. It was then that Cas couldn’t hold back the tears any more. He felt them roll down his cheeks and a sob slipped out.
“Dean this is childish and unnecessary. Utterly ridiculous.” Cas crossed his arms as he stood Next to Dean.
A male barista had found himself drawn in by the blue eyed baseball player that dropped by every Tuesday first thing before classes. He’d remembered Castiel’s drink and how to properly spell his name. Castiel was not a flirt in any definition of the word. The barista could tell that from his end Castiel was simply friendly and bright. However, he couldn’t help but hope that if he asked for a date he might get a yes.
“But it sounded like Donna is getting out of policing, and Jody is applying for something more administrative? And I don’t know what sketch things your mom and dads used to do,”at Jack’s shocked look Jeremy rolls his eyes, “but they all seem to be past it now, or about to be, so…”
Somewhere there’s a smell that’s telling Dean’s brain that he should wake up. Dean opens his eyes and sees a hand with take out coffee in front of him. He inhales what smells like a wonderful dark roast. He blinks a few times and sees Cas already dressed in a grey-blue sweater and jeans, and holding a take out coffee at arms length near his face.
Since becoming human, Cas is a lot more touchy, so he just says, “Hello Jeremy” and immediately moves in for quick hug. Fortunately Jeremy goes with it, and in fact seems more comfortable with the hug than the handshake. Or maybe it’s being more comfortable with Cas, considers Dean.
“Yes. There were no problems with negotiations. We should be able to trade some relatively harmless items from the bunker archive.”
“… very associated with Austin area. Even in California at Stanford, I remember one guy who was pretty intense about him. Raved about the Fourth of July concerts.” Sam shrugs and shifts his concentration to the veggies listed on the board.
It’s a logistical event getting everyone to the Convention Center, but they manage it. They all pose for a few pics with the Big Blue Bear on street level, but the bear is positioned so that he’s looking into the building, not facing out. To get it facing the camera means going into the Center. Dean and Charlie stay with Miracle to do some catching up, while Cas follows the boys inside.
Dean sighs. “I think we have a cuddle and massages as much as we have morning sex. Can you believe that our family thinks we have no self-control, and as punishment deprived us of mistletoe?”
Donna has snowboarded before. Dean’s not surprised to find that Sam has too, having gone on a trip with Jess and some friends of hers when at Stanford. He’s a little more surprised that Eileen can. Dean tells the experienced folks to head for the slopes, and he and Cas will take the group to meet the instructors. Claire takes to it quickly, and manages to guide Kaia. Jack and Alex don’t catch on immediately, but Patience does. Patience and Claire practice their technique and Jack and Alex have a surprisingly good time falling over. Jody also catches on quickly, but oddly doesn’t seem to enjoy it that much. Kelly practically quivers with concern, ready to heal broken bones at a moment’s notice if called for. When Cas proves to be very good at snowboarding, Dean announces, “It’s his thighs,” and derails the lesson.
“Jack, I wanted to show you something. I just started a new account. I guess it’s sort of a finsta…”
Jack says, “People in my family have been hurt helping or protecting others, so everyone is ok with the idea of taking risks for a higher purpose, but it makes accidents and near accidents feel a lot worse than they should.”
Kelly’s eyes twinkle, and she says, “I’m happy I could make you both laugh, but we should go in. You two must be getting cold.” She grabs Cas’ hand on one side and Jack’s on the other, and playfully tugs at them, but then drops their hands and lets Cas lead the way into the house, her wings tucked away.
“Ssshhhh. It’s ok. It’s ok,” says Dean as he puts his arms around Jack, and Jack wraps his around Dean.
The waitress comes by, quickly dropping off items, and retreating out of the way, as Charlie comes around to find Dean.
Jeremy says, “Claire was trying to get me to learn to block a punch, and I sort of tripped on her and knocked her down. I could have twisted her ankle falling on her like that.”
Changing the subject before Dean remembers Rowena’s distain for plaid flannel, Cas says, “Kelly, Dean’s made hot chocolate, if you’d like some,”and motions to the counter.
“You’re too hot already. How do I go to the farmer’s market with you in the spring if you keep at it, or worse, add running like Sam wants you to?
“Dude, if you and Cas weren’t already together, it could be a Hallmark movie about love, forgiveness, and helping a kid discover the true meaning of Christmas.”
“Nah, I mean taking a turn wearing out Miracle.” He hands him the tennis ball and says, “Just show him that and run around and he’ll go along with it.”
Team Free Will has a meeting after dinner with Jody and Donna about the family trust, and they in turn talk to Patience and Alex about their degree plans. Alex admits that it takes pressure off her knowing that Jody and Donna won’t have to help her financially. Patience’s feelings are more complex.
They go to the other side of the foyer which has a hallway next to stairs. “Let’s go to the basement first — thankfully,
“What are these?” Jeremy asks holding up a cookie that’s a blob of white frosting with white wings covered in rainbow sprinkles. There’s another one just like it except that the rainbow sprinkles are on black icing, and it has a lot of blue icing dots, too.
“Yeah, I like this one,” says Charlie. “Ok, handmaiden, time to earn your title.” Charlie gets Dean and Cas to help her do a handstand, and everyone does lots of jumping up and down. Miracle gets passed around a bit as a prop but he’s an oddly good natured dog, who seems incapable of getting stressed.
“All the ones with the freakin’ C names: Cara, Caitlyn, Carmen — wait was one of them Candy? Does our son hang out with someone named Candy a lot?”
“Dean Winchester, turn it down a notch,” says Jody, but with a smile and without any real irritation.
The waitress comes and asks if he’ll be wanting a buffet plate. Dean’s nodding a no and asking for just coffee when Jack interrupts. “Would you go ahead and bring one? Not for my dad — for someone else coming? And another coffee?”
“Don’t worry Jack, I guessed that much. We’ll still like your friend when he’s comfortable enough with us to be annoying. Anyway, it’s so weird having people think they need to be polite around us. We’re that old.”
No one can ever patch up Cas’ wings thinks Dean. Arlett seems amused by how Cas’ hair is sticking up and with a motherly hand tries without success to tap it down.
Claire gives him something halfway between a side hug and a slap on the back, and says to Jack, “You might need to keep J out of trouble, so keep an eye out for him when you both get back to KU.”
“It was the best mom. You’re here — I mean really here. You’re not just a presence in my head and heart, and all the Dads are here, and my cousins, and most of my aunts. And my best friend got to come, and I think he had fun even though he was feeling down. He didn’t take take out his ball to throw at the wall even once! And it can only get better when my uncles and Aunt Amara can come.”
“Hey, looks like you’ve all done some damage here,” says Dean walking in with Miracle on a leash for once.
“Just shortening your decision time to get you down here faster,” says Cas with an innocent look. “Plus, I was able to get the suitcase nearly packed for checkout.”
Jack find kilts, and a Macleod tartan vest. “I like it. It’s reminds me of bees,” Jack tells Rowena, holding the yellow and black plaid.
“Sam, I had no idea how much you’d come to mean to me, and how much I’d respect you. And now you found someone to share your life and I’m proud and happy. Eileen, you’re amazing. I know you have Sam’s back and he has yours. I love you both. You’re family. And now I’m going to have to think of something better to say at your wedding. To Sam and Eileen.”
“Hey, you guys look shiny!” yells Charlie. Donna has a headband on instead of her usual ponytail, and her hair is shining.
Dean lets out a sigh. Cas gives him a kiss on the cheek. “Talk to your Mom. I’ll check on the bees and the garden. Yell, or send Miracle out to get me when you’re done.” He looks at Dean and then gives him a soft kiss on the lips. He turns to Mary and says, “See you later,” before flapping outside.
“Those were the best games I’ve seen from Jack,” Jeremy says. “I’m embarrassed to admit I never realized that ’Them’s the breaks’ is about pool. It makes sense now.”
He blushes a little and gives Charlie a hug. He looks at Jack then tells Charlie, “I guess it was just lucky Jack has an amazing family.”
“I think living your life and being happy is the best reply to your dad. I haven’t figured out how to stop being angry all the time, but I know that I’m happier when I’m not.”
“They just startled each other,” says Kelly “but I pulled the mom card and made everyone come in. I mean with that fire pit and the bench seating, I thought they might hit something.”
“He’s just processing,” answers Cas. “That’s fine. We’ll go out for lunch in town and figure it out when you two get here. Just text us when you’re close.”
“Ugh, I don’t want to tag anybody, or have a lot of followers. I just wanted to have some pictures to remember, and not have them lost in my camera roll. I wasn’t including all the stuff that I’ve edited and given to people. I wanted some pics that weren’t perfect, so it’s more that I was there to see it and not how good it looks.”
Cas says, “Dean, I’m sure he and Mel discussed us heavily before we met, and then he only talked about his areas of expertise. I don’t think we’ve seen him interact casually yet, and certainly not around seventeen people at one time.”
She gives Jeremy a quick hug and starts hugging everyone else. Rowena is wearing rose gold heels, silk burgundy pants, a pink cashmere sweater, and a burgundy coat with plush collar. However nicely she may be dressed, Rowena doesn’t mind getting squished or rumpled, and accepts Miracle pawing at her pants without concern, giving him lots of cooing and pets. She finally gets to Kelly, who does not look pleased, but gives a hug nevertheless and simply says, “You’d better introduce him.”
All the younger set change into sleepwear. Given that it’s winter, the sleepwear is pretty close to their normal casual wear. The young women wear leggings and tanks with sweatshirts or flannel shirts pulled over. Jeremy’s sleepwear is much the same except his sleep pants are long and loose, like Dean’s hot dog pants. Jack is more unique wearing actual pajamas that button up and have a matching top and bottom.
Two vehicles pull up. One is a big black truck with a vanity license reading DTRAIN. The other is a small station wagon. Jeremy hangs back a little, and thinks maybe he’s seeing things as a girl with long blonde hair runs out of the station wagon, feins a hug with Jack and instead grabs him and twists him into a dangerous looking head lock. Jack pulls his head down. One hands comes up and taps the side of her head, then moves to the front her face, while the other gets under her thigh, he pushes enough that he has her tilted back in a move that looks like he could flip her over, but she lets go and he sets her back down. She looks pleased, and then starts to twist into another hold, when a woman with dark, short hair comes out of the truck and whistles to get their attention much like Rowena did.
Sam and Eileen get back. Alex and Jeremy are still hovering around the pool table, so Sam joins them, and they get the benefit of another Winchester pool lesson from Sam’s perspective. Jack jumps up to follow along, standing by Eileen.
“Yeah, but they’ll probably have another with her and Jody and Donna anyway. They’re meeting Charlie for brunch. There’s probably spa time involved.”
Rowena shakes her head a bit at Claire. “I imagine that you two will be moving on to the puffed cheese balls later,” she says with a smile.
Jack yells, “I love mine!” Jack holds up very busy Mandalorian sweater with Grogu in the middle on a background of Din helmets.
Sam takes a ring box out of his pocket, but instead of a ring inside, there’s a folded piece of paper. He pulls it out to unfold, and there’s a drawing of a ring from different angles, with runes over the band.
Sam taps the control area. “This is just the swim-treadmill version, but you can keep up your distance.”
Dean started laughing so hard he doubled-over. “Sam, it’s heaven and it’s Baby. I don’t think I’m going to get in an accident, but go ahead.”
Kelly and Jack go to the living room to look out the windows. Kelly says, “So Jack, did you have a good Christmas?”
Dean nods. Since he’s had time and freedom from Chuck’s influence to think over the past, he’s not open to any visits from Dad. Cas asks about Ellen and Jo. Mary goes along with the conversation change, so that means John was not intended to be the main topic. Dean finishes up the eggs and plates the food, a little less on edge, but still wary.
In the end it really came down to Tau Delta Kappa and Alpha Beta Omega. Both had great connections for all of them and were very accepting and inclusive. After ending their call with Charlie and Gad they scheduled some time with Ash to go check out the houses in person.
“Yeah, Michael and me were able to find some time. If you don’t mind us crashing your Halloween night we can definitely make the trip down.”
Dean tended to have a harder time getting Cas to step away from work. He did his best though. He didn't want him burning himself out. Cas so much ahead of him Dean didn't want anything to get in the way of that.
Dean chuckled and shook his head. “Guess sammy knows now….i think he approves.” He turned to smile at Cas.
The nurse typed into the computer and looked up the name. She looked up to Cas, “Are you family?” Cas hesitated, “Sorry only family is allowed.”
“Your dad recommended I add some extra skills in in case I want to one day. If I want to move up or move to different departments in the government I’d have the skills to do so.”
“No way, they came to me too.” Ash held up a pamphlet with the fraternity's logo on it. They all got into a discussion over the houses they were looking into. The trio wanted to try and stick together. Gad and Charlie worked their computer magic and looked more deeply into each house.
He looked up to Ash’s bed and had to suppress a laugh. Gad was fast asleep on his stomach and Michael had an arm around Gad with his  head resting on jis best friends shoulder blades.
Now not all of Dean and Cas’s interactions left people in heart break. Sometimes they led to the exact opposite. Dean and Cas were quite observant when it came to others, just not themselves. So when they noticed their friends were feeling a little lonely and looking for love they had the idea to see if maybe they could make a match.  This isn’t something they normally did but the puzzle pieces just seemed too right to pass up.
“I know,” new tears welled up. “But, I wanted to do this. I wanted to have a backup in case anything came up...I thought...I really thought I could do this. I was doing it. But, it’s slowly just started wearing on me.” He let out a shuddering breath and dean pulled him in.
Hey guys hope you liked the new chapter. I couldn't help but give you guys some more Luci screen time ^-^ not to mention big family gathering for these boys.
“Come one Cas we gotta.” Dean was reading something on his phone, his fingers dragging slowly through Cas’s hair.
Dean had to admit, they’d had to do some dumb shit but it wasn’t as bad as movies made it. Cas thought they were ‘childish and unnecessary.’ He did them though and if anything Dean was pretty sure the silly and outlandish ‘trials’ got Cas to relax and let loose a bit.
“As long as we don’t gotta hear you two getting it on we’re good.” Gad chuckled as he watched Michael grimace at the thought.
Thank you for sticking with me guys it really means so much, I hope you guys liked the chapter and I'll see you guys as soon ^-^
“I know, it’s not how you usually are but it happened. It’s completely human to lose your cool. Don’t worry, you’re still the level headed one in this relationship.”
Dean alternated between soft nuzzling and kisses, occasionally coming back for one of Cas’s weaknesses. Cas eventually gave up the movie and set aside the laptop and turned his head to capture Dean’s lips. He could feel Dean smile against his lips, he must have been aiming for a makeout session. Cas chuckled softly. His swiped his tongue against Dean’s lips, his boyfriend happily opened his mouth for him.
“Sam’s rented an enormous house for us outside of Denver. It’s a surprise. Dean thinks it’s going to be a couple of plain little cabins. He doesn’t know that we could fit like 20 people if we wanted, and there’s a big kitchen and a pool table.”
“Hey! J’s here!” yells Alex as they enter the rec room. She’s got two glasses in each hand. “Hug him quick and then grab a glass.”
“Uh, there’s a giant bear statue in Denver,” Jeremy pauses a bit hesitant, “It’s blue and you know — touristy?”
“Tea — whatever you usually make.” Despite a protest from Cas, Eileen gets back up to get some honey from a cabinet, so it’s not long before they all have a beverage.
“He was surprisingly aware of what was going on, even if he wasn’t looking. I saw him react to a couple things that you and Mel said,” says Kelly.
Charlie decides it’s not the time or place to dig any deeper, so she changes the subject. “So speaking of kids, adopting another one?”
“Of course it is,” teases Dean. “I mean it looks like a Borg cube, man. Hey, look, a built-in grill on the cooktop.”
Claire looks a little wistful, at Jack with both Cas and Kelly, so Cas pats the space next to him. “Claire, why don’t you and Kaia join us on the sofa.” Kelly and Jack scoot over. Claire looks to Kaia, who gives a smile, and they go over so Cas has Claire and Jack on either side.
“There aren’t that many cleared to come down yet. Inias would drive Dean crazy fawning over Cas. Balthazar and I might be a bit much together and there
“Good job, Jack,” Claire says, wiggling her own feet that have thick slipper socks. “Catch a donut hole!” She throws one at his face, and Jack twists to catch it in his mouth. “Whoo!” Claire says as it goes in.
“Jack, I always thought you looked like Cas, but seeing you two in a picture like this… Dean, they’re so much alike.”
Jeremy makes a big show of moving his head back and forth as if weighing what to say. He glances over at Jack looking at him expectantly. He finally gives Jack a small smile and says, “They’re cool and they’re funny. I like them.” Jack breaks into a beaming smile. Jeremy taps the music app on his screen and then opens the web player. “Here. I’ve got this open so you can pull up whatever you want to listen to.”
Rowena seems pleased enough, and smiles and says, “Well let’s not stick to formalities, hugs all around!”
Jeremy looks a little hesitant. “Look, if I ever want to just talk to a parent who’s not one of mine, do you mind if I call Dean or Cas?”
Talking. Kelly arrives. The pool noodle saga continues. Dean doesn't filter sometimes. Social media makes an appearance.
Cas looks like he’s ready to go, but then he turns around and with a soft smile says, “I love you, Dean.”
“Cas and I are old married guys. Sam and Eileen are changing the family business to something positive. Jack gets to be a kid — ok a college kid — but a kid with friends. You’re here. Jody and Donna and the girls are happy. Somehow Rowena manages to be Queen of Hell and still spoil Jack every time we turn our backs. I know Kevin and his mom are out there living their lives, even if they don’t check in that often. And everyone else I care about who isn’t here is in heaven or wherever of their own free will. It don’t get better than that.”
Cas takes one last step and wraps his arms around Dean so that they’re touching from legs to chest. Cas stares into Dean’s eyes. Dean thinks he’s going to give him a full-on Pizza Man fiery kiss, but instead Cas brushes his cheek against Dean’s. With his lips next to Dean’s ear, he whispers words from their wedding first in Enochian, and then in English. “We have chosen each other. I love you, my husband.”
Jack is pretty used to the door, so he has it unlocked with about the same speed as a key. “So what did you break this time?”
Rowena comes from the stairwell. “I hear you bellowing, Dean Winchester! Let me tell you that’s impossible. Miracle was spoiled before — just in different ways.”
Patience comes up and says, “Your being here was nice. It was fun to tell all those old team stories. I felt like a normal person.”
They decide not to force themselves to do everything, and settle on a few more: the coloring book area for Jack and a reluctant Jeremy; the happy face wall for Jack; the donut wall for Dean, Cas, Jack and Miracle; and the boys insist that Dean and Cas pose at the heart wall.
Claire passes the gifts out and instead of albums, they all get small digital picture frames. Claire turns hers on.“Hey, you got some pictures of when we made s’mores,” she says.
“As fun as that was, I think next year we should draw names,” says Dean. “I can’t believe that I’m saying this, but we all got too many gifts.”
They decide that five times is enough, and get some hot chocolate. All of them talk about what to do tomorrow, and decide to try either the alpine roller coaster or a snow shoe trail at Copper. Sam reminds them that more family will start coming in, probably Charlie and Rowena over the next two days, then the Sisters.
Jeremy says, “It’s really Jonathan, which is why I got a J name. Considering a lot of dad’s family are Danes, I’m lucky I didn’t get Jan or Jens or something. Not that Jeremy is that great a name.” Jack makes sound of protest.
Gadreel moves through the foyer, taking chairs to the dining room, while the others cluster in the living room.
“Yeah, I think we can be overwhelming sometimes. Oh, I remember, Charlie wasn’t going to bring her mom, because we were such a big group.”
Jeremy tries to take his tripod back, but Cas just gives him a pat on the back with his free hand and moves away.
Jack sits crossed-legged across from him, while Jeremy leans back into the small mountain of pillows in front of the headboard.
“No, I appreciate it. It was rude of me to come up here and invade your space the way I did. It’s just a lot easier talking to Jack and his family and friends instead of mine.”
Jeremy rolls his eyes and says, “The struggle is real.” Jack looks slightly displeased, but he quickly moves on. “I think it’s going to be nice.”
Kelly speaks up, “I get the impression that if he thinks you won’t be interested, he doesn’t say much. And he did listen to everyone talk about the tourist outings, and the holidays. He might talk to me about the tax code, but that’s ok.”
“Dean, when people lived in their memories — when I lived in my happiest memories here in heaven, I didn’t have to deal with regret. I had you and baby Sammy and the John I first met, and that was the ideal heaven. Now the ideal for heaven is time. Eternity to be around your loved ones, know they’re safe, and make things right. I should know that’s not always an easy process.” She gives a sad wry smile, “That’s why your dad is here, right? ”
In the restaurant, sitting at opposite ends of the table, and having different conversations, Mel and Nat didn’t seem very much like a couple. In a living room of new people, Mel takes Nat’s arm and also takes the lead for interaction. She skillfully runs interference for Nat, taking the spotlight when needed, so he can be comfortably quiet, yet keeping him part of the conversation. He can focus on her, but still be present. It’s a skillful dance that they have down to an art, and Cas and Sam glance at each other, perhaps thinking the same thing — they seem so attuned to each other, it’s hard to understand the divorce.
Dean resumes looking at a map on his phone and makes a decision. “I’ve been thinking that we don’t want to get to the cabins in the dark, so maybe we should stay in Denver overnight. Then it will be a short final trip — maybe a couple of hours.
For a quiet and reserved person, Nat doesn’t seem at all bothered by Mel’s announcement, and seems to accept it as a fact. Kelly decides to try a Bloody Viking, too, but everyone else keeps to water or soda, feeling the need to keep their wits or driving ability.
“You forgave me for other things. Not for the pain you went through when I died again, and the damage to your relationship with Jack.”
The eye roll Jack gives him shows that Jack doesn’t believe his answer, but he smiles anyway and says, “Good night,” turning away, holding Marvin.
Rowena get up and says,“Gadreel is somewhere around here. I’ll make him pop in, even though he won’t eat anything
The smile on Jeremy face falters, and so does Donna’s. He attempts recovery and smiles more energetically, saying how glad he is to meet her. Donna gives another smile and heads upstairs. Jeremey feels himself sag after.
Dean puts his arm around Cas and they stay close. Miracle lays down under their chairs. It takes some time, but the two of them shift into joining the conversations at the table.
Thirty minutes later everything translates to containers of Chinese take-out, wings, fries, and a cheese pizza on the coffee table. Another 30 minutes later and the fries are decimated, Jeremy’s finishing a plate of wings, Jack is eating out of Chinese take out cartons, and half the pizza has been declared breakfast food for tomorrow. Jeremy decides to ask a question.
“So this trauma anniversary thing… Our plan for a big heaven Game Night brought it all back to you, huh? That’s why you’re here. We did it.” Mary just shrugs.
Claire jumps to attention and rushes to get the ingredients and put them on a paper plate. Jody and Donna pass out the easier to handle hot dog roasters to Claire, Patience, Alex, and Jack while everyone else makes do with skewers created from wire hangers that Donna took wire cutters to. Since Jeremy is trying to take pictures, Jack promises to make him a s’more. He and Claire give the greatest concentration to their tasks and try not to burn the marshmallows to Alex and Charlie’s amusement. Sam holds Eileen’s hand, and they sit next to Jody and Donna and catch up on conversation.
Would I write in this weird little ‘verse I’ve made again? Probably. I have ideas, but if everybody is good with where we’ve left these characters, I won’t push it. If I get comments that somebody just has to know what happens at Sam’s wedding, or what happens in X number of years, then I might do timestamps to reflect a reader wishlist.
“Well, I don’t think Claire is going to try teaching me to fight again anytime soon. I haven’t figured out what I want to do either, but if it turns out to be accounting, the risk of injury is probably pretty low. And I promise to be careful in high-risk activities, like driving, or hanging out with Claire.” Jeremy smiles for effect, but Jack seems unamused.
There’s a gift marked “from Santa” for Dean and Cas that no one takes credit for, and they open it cautiously. Cas lifts out a t-shirt that reads, “Trophy husband.”
Dean gets a strange feeling of dread that he didn’t think would happen in heaven. “Sounds like we’ll need breakfast then.”
Gadreel pops in, and is immediately called on to rearrange and add furniture so everyone faces each other instead of the tv or pool table. Donna has surprised everyone with a large box of donut holes. Most people are still too full from breakfast, but Claire and Jack grab a few in paper cups. Kaia takes one end of a couch and an ottoman for her feet, and Claire leans on her with her legs out across the couch, taking up much of the room. Jack spots her, and takes the other end and sits with his back to the arm, laying his legs out next to hers. He raises an eyebrow at her, and she rolls her eyes.
“I understand if it’s too much, but you’d really like the Dads and my mom. Claire’s coming. She’s tough on the outside, but she’s cool. She’s like a sister, and her girlfriend Kaia is really sweet. If Claire gets to be too much, Kaia will take care of it.
A man who looks like he might be the girl’s father appears and calls the woman over. They say quick good-byes and walk on to the car. Kelly puts a hand on Jeremy’s arm.
“No problem. It’s not even really a hack. I’m just asking nicely for their system to let me buy a ticket.” She flexes her fingers,“And I’m very persuasive.”
“On the plus side, I think Jeremy’s won the right to ask for Jack’s hand in marriage now,” declares Alex with a smirk.
“Are you telling me that the archangel Michael took time from his heavenly duties to make sure we’d know that he’s taking my half-brother’s name?”
At the point where Kristin’s character gets framed for shoplifting, Jeremy becomes so agitated that Dean volunteers to teach him some pool shots to give him a break. Cas rolls his eyes at the pun as does Jody, but most of the room misses it. Dean and Jeremy go to the other side of the rec room. Kelly leaves her arm chair and joins Cas and Jack on the couch. Jack continues with the movie, but looks over to the pool table see how things are going from time to time. When it’s apparent that Kristen isn’t ditching her girlfriend for Aubry Plaza, despite great chemistry in a bar scene, Alex goes to join Jeremy and Dean for pool lessons.
Cas had in the past counted visible freckles on dean when he had slept from across the room. It had been a way to pass the time. Now he could count them and see them up close. He didn't need to count them to know the exact number of freckles and locations of all of them though. He knew each and everyone of them because he had placed them there when he'd rebuilt Dean's body after pulling the righteous man from hell. But, he counted them anyways because he enjoyed it.
“And I love you Castiel Novak,” Dean let Cas guide him in for another kiss. Dean honestly could never imagine himself being with someone and saying the words ‘i love you’ so easily. With Cas though, he couldn’t imagine not saying those words to him everyday.
“Sorry,” It was all slowly coming back. The late night drive, the green light, the headlights. Didn’t take much to put two and two together.
They left feeling really good about the house. They guys were great and the rooms were nice and they could imagine being apart of the fraternity.
The hunters hands moved to gently cup the back of Cas's head and card his fingers through the angels unruly, messy, sexy hair. Dean had always imagined Cas's hair to be soft but this was a whole other level of soft. He wanted to nuzzled against his hair and feel it against his skin. Woah woah woah, since when was nuzzling on the Winchester menu? As his fingers ran through the angels hair he started to think maybe it was time for a menu update.
“Oh my god….oh my….I knew this was going to freaking happen one day. Ugh,” he blocked his view with the half eaten piece of toast. “Not how I wanted to know I'd win the bet.”
They visited ABΩ first and were met with a warm welcome. Honestly they were waiting for that typical movie fraternity personality to pop up with their guide. The guy however was cool and laid back. Without even asking Dean and Cas were told they’d be more than okay letting them share a room. They hadn’t planned on asking to share since they didn’t want to seem like they wanted special accommodations because they were dating. They already went in ready to not share. The guys they met along the way were nice and pretty cool. Ash was really liking the building and apparently very pleased with the wifi network. The rooms would be very similar to what they were dealing with now, but they’d have the freedom to swap out furniture and decorate how they’d like...within reason.
Mary hung up her phone and looked over to see a crying Castiel. The poor thing. She went over so she could give him a hug but before she’d even taken a step John had to boy wrapped up in a hug. She ran a hand over her mouth, she was close to tears that her oldest was in the hospital and now tears were threatening to bubble up at the sight of John and Cas. She’d always hoped to see John finally accept him fully as one of their own, and here it was. Dean and Cas didn’t need to be married or anything to consider Cas part of the family, to the Winchesters he and his family were their family.
“If you think I am a workaholic that guys doesn’t do anything but go to class and work on personal projects. When I get the time I drag him out so he gets some sunlight.” Michael shook his head.
I know it's been a long time. I am sorry it's taken me this long to give you guys any sort of update. Needless to say this last year has been crazy. I wanted to give you guys a little life update and talk about what I have planned for this fic.
The first Friday night after spring break Dean made his way to Cas’s room. They’d be moving in fully into the Tau Delta Kappa house soon. For now they were in their rooms. He was about to knock when Cas’s roommate walked out.
“He’s my son, now do I have to get a superior out here or you gonna let him come?” John stared her down. The woman huffed and decided it was way too much to bother with and let Cas go with John.
Mary and John went to go grab coffee and some food for them, they were in one of the waiting rooms that allowed them food. Cas was grateful they’d thought to go get some. His mind was all over the place. He moved slowly to grab his phone, Sam had moved and was now sleeping with his head in Cas’s lap. Castiel didn’t want to wake the youngest Winchester so he kept his movements minimal.
The second Gadreel and Micheal were in their sights they made their way over to greet them. Cas made sure he hugged them both, Dean’s hugs were more reserved but they knew he was happy to see them.
The kisses were slow and long. There was no rush, there was no end goal they were just taking time to indulge in each other. Dean’s hands,  like usual, roamed over Cas’s body. Started by his cheek then slowly trailing down his chest and arm. He made his way over Cas’s taunt stomach and lower belly, purposely he avoided his groin and instead went to his thighs then trailed back up.
Their guide who introduced himself as Eliot Ness, he was a criminal justice major like Dean. He took them upstairs to where the apartments were. That’s what they dubbed them, apartments because they were more than rooms. As they walked by the doors they saw each one was creatively labeled. They had on average two to four names on them. They came up to a room with no names on them and waited for Eliot to open it up they walked in to see a good sized living room with a small kitchen. There was a large common kitchen downstairs but this gave them the privacy if they wanted it. There were two doors opposite of each other in the living room.
“Why don't you come and find out what else I've learned?” He smirked and with a sudden sound of fluttering wings he was gone. Where the hell had those words come from? He didn't know but he was so glad he said them as he heard Deans rushed steps headed to the room. The door swung open revealing Dean breathing heavily. “Dean maybe you should take up Sam's offer and run more.”
There were shouts and cheers all around. Cas knew none of them really knew them but he appreciated it anyways. At some point they lost track of Gad and his duo. When they did see him again he looked very very happy.
“I am enjoying it actually. Classes and training is hard but I know I chose the right path.” Michael looked over looking confident leaving no doubts in Cas’s mind that Michael was being truthful.
Since classes ended about ten days before Cas’s last game Dean went to every single game. The last three were away games up in Oregon. Dean drove up there and along the way picked up Gad and Michael who had some time to make it to watch Cas play.
“Don’t worry Dean I promise the guys are fine with any sexual orientation, it’s bad taste in movies and music where things start getting ugly.” Eliot grinned as they all laughed. “I will say you wouldn’t be our first gay or bi members but you would be the first couple to join together. “
Hey guys hope you enjoyed this weeks post. I really wanted to get this up last week x..x unfortunately the store I work had had a HUGE game release last week and it was just a crappy week overall. But here we have the boys moving forward. Thank you IceMan for the house recommendation. Probably not the route you expected me to take but it was very fun to use ^-^
Dean had to admit the building was impressive. He loved all the wood, lighting, and large windows. He could feel the history as he made his way through the building. It wasn’t as old as you would think but it’d seen a lot in its time.
Eventually a doctor came out and told them that Dean so far had some minor internal damage, a mild concussion, and a broken collar bone. They had to run some more tests before they knew if there was anything else.
“Are you two sure you don’t mind sleeping in our dorms?” Cas asked as they made their way back to the impala.
“Worth it though.” Eliot led the way to one of the rooms. “Now we can fit four to one of these apartments, two per room but are numbers are low enough right now that we can spread people out. So Cas if you and Dean want to share Ash can have a room to himself and you guys could have this one to yourselves.”
“I know,” Cas winked and sipped his tea. Dean sighed, he had a feeling this was going to be a reoccurring theme between them, him being unable to deny Cas. Funny how that didn’t bother him as much as one would think it would.
Dean shrugged, “Maybe not right away, he seems like a guy who’s gotta work up the courage to ask. He’s a bit on the shy side.”
“Seriously?” Ash walked in and plopped down next to them. Then for the next twenty minutes Ash gave them a run down of what ABO was. Michael noped out part way through while Charlie and Gad watched Dean and Cas eagerly.
“I am glad to hear it.” Cas stood and gave his cousin a shoulder squeeze before heading for the door.
“No,” Dean struggled to keep himself from laughing at Cas’s antics. But eventually Dean burst out into laughter and kissed the top of Cas’s head. “......let me….god I can’t believe I am saying this….let me think about it.”
These chapters will very in length, some short and some long. I hope you guys are enjoying the new format. I know it's quite different from part 1
The angel stared at him affectionately. “I liked the way you called me angel last night, but i think I like hearing the word boyfriend more.” The angel smiled. Dean chuckled and pulled him in for a kiss. “I'll keep that in mind. Now let's go get food. That was quite a work out last night i need to refuel.”
“Dean...hey...up I don’t think Cas is doing well.” He gestured over his shoulder. Dean sighed and nodded. He didn’t say anything as he walked in. The door quietly closed behind him.
Dean chuckled as he grabbed Cas's tie. “Hmmm I am not too sure. Maybe you can try answering again?” Cas raised a brow. He wasn't exactly an expert at flirting in any sense of the word, heck he could barely be called a noob. So when the next words left his mouth it left both him and dean surprised.
“Cas,” His name left dean's lips like a whisper, like a prayer. It was a prayer, he heard it echo faintly in his mind. “I am not going one more day without you.”
“Okay so…..back to our original discussion. That was one of the houses we were looking at.” Dean crossed his arms and leaned back.”
To everyone who's left comments thank you so much. I read every single one of them I just haven't been able to comment back ;-; I am going to try to get to them when I can 💙💚💙💚
Thank you so much for sticking with me this long guys. I love writing this story and I always feel bad when I can't post but you guys are always so amazing and supportive. Thank you <3 <3 <3 You are the best readers. I am going to aim to reply to comments this weekend if I get the chance. If you guys are reading DCBB2019 fics Two of the three I did artwork for are up. I have posts with my artwork up and links to the stories there ^-^ Thanks again guys and I'll hopefully see you next week <3 <3 <3
Cas had played beautifully as always, Dean as always was his number one fan followed close by their two friends. Dean sported a Novak baseball jersey, now he knew how Cas felt during football season. While the team didn’t make it to championships they had done amazingly and loved having Cas. He was already set to start the next season.
“Apparently we get to put trunks on and then pool party with the sister house.” Dean chuckled and gestured for Cas to follow him out of the pool. Luckily they’d both finished up all their assignments so they could spend at the party. If they were part of the house they’d also have to socialize.
The Angel stared at him for a moment longer before grabbing him by the collar of his flannel shirt and yanked him in for a deeper kiss. Dean hummed in delight. He had to admit he found aggressive Cas hot as hell. The angel’s tongue darted out and licked deans lip. The sensation ran straight to dean's lower half. He let out a groan. This time the Angel smiled as he pulled away. “I think you can guess my answer.”
So sorry the chapter came out late this week. it was a full week. Mom had knee surgery, bro had school registration, sister had a doctors appointment and like a million other things @-@ being the oldest I handled it all. But, in the end I was able to get this chapter out and I am happy I did <3
“I do,” Dean nuzzled against his cheek. His nose moved across Cas’s cheekbone, his lips ghosted against the shell of his ear. Cas could feel the warmth of his breath on his skin. He wasn’t going to be able to concentrate on this movie for much longer. Seconds after the thought entered his brain Dean’s lips wrapped around Cas’s earlobe and all other thoughts left Cas’s brain. It was a weak spot for him and Dean knew it.
He felt Cas’s warm hand on his, he smiled and opened his eyes to see Cas sitting next to him. He was fuzzy around the edges but his dark hair and blue eyes easily recognizable.
“They always go all out like this?” Michael sidestepped past an extremely drunk girl and her friend.
Deans jaw clenched. Cas knew him too well. So well Dean knew some questions he didn't need to answer. He knew him so well sometimes all it took was a look and they could both convey a full conversation without uttering a word.
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter I had a fun time writing it ^-^ the whole karaoke scene was so I could get Cas to sing Locked out of Heaven and to get Dean to carry him out of a bar. I ended up combining the two XD
Cas saw his phone near his pillow and slowly reached for it. This was great blackmail material and he refused to pass it up. Cas could tell they still had their pants on but their shirts were tossed off to the side.
“It was...scary. You’re parents were amazing though.” Cas then whispered, “You’re dad lied to the nurse and said I was his son so that I could go to the waiting room with them.” His dad had done that? Wow. “He also gave me a hug.”
“Fine, you win this one. Especially if that inebriated college guy could figure it out from that far away.”
“I don’t think you do. Cas you’re wearing yourself out. We’re all worried. We talked about this.” His tone still calm and reasonable.
“Don’t worry Dean we’ll get our chance one day.” Cas was actually really excited. Without needing to discuss things they three of them had decided that this was the house they wanted to pledge to.
“Busy as hell,” Dean had to admit Benny sounded tired. “But, I like what I am doing so I can’t complain.”
Cas nodded and looked to Dean. “I don’t even remember what I yelled at them. I was just so mad, tired and had so much to do.” Cas sighed knowing that was no excuse for his outburst.
“Explains the price.” Dean smiled goodheartedly. This wasn’t free but their scholarships would cover the housing fees. That didn’t mean they hadn’t taken a look.
“Not as much as some others. We’re a bit picky I guess you could say. Not in a mean way but while we like to have fun we do like to take our schooling seriously and we want brothers who feel the same.”
If anyone's interested I was feeling much more relaxed and inspired this week I even wrote a new Destiel Oneshot
“I know how hot you find it.” Dean winked at Cas only to then burst out into laughter as Cas rolled his eyes.
Cas sat in the living room watching a netflix original, it wasn’t too bad, as he waited for Dean to get home. He must have fallen asleep because the next thing he knew he was being woken up by his phone ringing. He shot up and grabbed it not looking at the name or time.
So just at the beginning I want to say that this is very very different from any other chapter I've posted for this series but something that's been on my mind for a while. I hope you guys enjoy it. Let me know what you thought of it in the comments.
“Thank you Dean.” Cas was exuding love and affection. Dean knew just how to get him to calm down. He still felt bad for yelling but he was okay admitting that Alan and his friends pushed him to that point.
Cas was happy the next football game was a home one. He’d made a couple of friends along the way and now had a group to sit with. The away games sucked since he couldn’t go with but he did watch it live. He usually had it on when he was taking a break or even when he was working on things.
“Sorry….it’s just,” Cas sighed. “Alan and the guys were arguing loudly and I kind of…” Cas covered his face with his free hand.
That long stare held even more this time. The gates had been opened and they're feelings were left bare for the other to see. A smile tugged at Dean's lips. “So tell me Cas, how do you feel about this?”
“Huh, I don’t know if we’ll have that pop up anytime soon but it’s something to think about.” The girl nodded thoughtfully and wandered off to go get a drink. That was way different than what Dean and Cas expected.
Sam yells, “That’s probably Rowena,” as Dean and Cas go to check. They find Gadreel and Rowena already inside. Rowena gives Miracle a pet and then waves him off, and he goes back to the rec room.
“When he stopped Nick from calling Lucifer, he didn’t just immobilize him or kill him quickly. He put Nick through pain, torture. I saw him do it. If it had been me, I admit I’d have been glad I killed him. But the pain wasn’t right — I knew who Jack was. I was with him in the Apocalypse world. I’d seen him kill to protect whole settlements and you hadn’t. I saw him when he was grim and determined. He was sometimes stubborn and too quick to make decisions, but killing Nick was different. Jack never desired to cause pain. I knew it was wrong for him.” Mary pauses and sets her mug on the coffee table. “I called Jack out on it, and he wanted me to say that it was ok. Frankly, I could have just lied. I’m a hunter. I know strategy. I could have told Jack that it was ok. We’d have all gone back to the bunker, and then I could have told you, Sam and Cas together in secret. Waiting for Castiel to get back would have made the most sense. We would have faced his soullessness together.”
Dean says, “Well, I think that’s enough of that,” and picks up the dog. Cas helps Jack up and dusts off his fashionable and now dirty sweater and fusses over his hair.
“Good. Have as many as you want. We’re supposed make more at the lodge anyway.” Jeremy tries several and finds that they are much better than the average sugar cookie. Some are buttery and others have a hint of almond.
Sam gives him a warning bitch face. Dean explains, “J, Sam is so tall he has been known to be called a moose.”
Mary smiles and says, “If it’s G-rated, it’s probably your wedding. Well, G-rated up to the reception. Maybe up to the kiss.”
“Thankfully most of them didn’t make it out of the Empty. Just Cain who’s with Collette, so he’s back to beekeeping. Dear Fergus is in group counseling right now. Gavin is helping him, but it may take years before he’s ready to talk to me or accept the new hell and heaven situation, and he’s one of the easier cases. I think I need a moment.”
I didn't really expect to add more to this, but I've been getting Jack feels, and I want to see him be a kid and make friends. Since he looks too old to fit in with normal 4-year-olds, and he drinks beer, college seems the appropriate place. He's a first year student at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. See notes for other background.
They’re parked in front of the diner when they see a Tesla pull up. The two young men get out. Jeremy is just a touch taller than Jack, with blond hair and a more stocky build. He has a handsome face, which puts Dean on self-centered, douche bag alert. Dean wonders if it’s stupid to breathe a sigh of relief when he notices that he’s wearing what looks like an extremely comfortable and completely unflattering lumpy sweater the color of wet cement under his open coat. He looks quiet, and not particularly demanding. Of the two, Jack looks the most outgoing, confident, and stylish — who knows where that sweater came from. Everyone in the family sends Jack care packages. Dean can’t help a proud smile as he gets out of the car. Cas is beaming with joy at seeing Jack, and Dean’s heart melts a little. While Cas is embracing Jack, Dean offers his hand. “Hey Jeremy, I’m Dean. ”
Cas is standing in deep concentration looking at the contents of the trunk. Dean walks out with the old green cooler, a duffle bag, and a couple of coats thrown over his shoulder.
Everyone laughs, including Kelly, but then Kelly suddenly stops, goes still and is gone with a whoosh, her mug suspended in air. Dean gingerly grabs it and puts it on the table remembering that case when cartoon rules were in effect. Outside they can hear Miracle barking up a storm, and then the sound stops.
Gadreel nods. He’s experienced enough of Old Heaven to understand that feeling. “I did see one piece of good news that I’d like to draw your attention to.” He folds over the paper to a story and passes it to Cas.
“It’s not your fault Dean. That man was under the influence and ran a red light. It was all on him. I am just grateful that you’re still here.”
“I do but we are talking about these.” Cas gently steered them back onto topic as he tapped the folders.
“Damn Cas where did you learn to talk like that? The Pizza Man?” He let out a breathless chuckle. He felt himself straining against his pants.
“Yeah,” Dean placed a kiss on his forehead before calling out to the person at the door, “Come on in.”
Jack takes it to mean that she didn’t want to add to his stress with her joking around, since Jeremy can be sensitive about her teasing. The groutfit text comes to mind. Jack just says, “That was nice of you,” which makes Canada laugh.
“She’s very frank about her opinions, and seems enthusiastic about becoming friends, yet I can’t say that know her well.”
Cas smiles at him, “Thank you Gadreel. You’ll have to forgive our rudeness. I hope you’ve had a good morning.”
Mary comes to it. “You know, we were going to have a Game Night with Jack and we got interrupted by that call from Donetello. It was after that things went bad — when Jack killed me.”
They watch the group walk off to Baby. Mel can’t help a smile and a head shake as Baby makes a ton of noise backing out. They wave as the car straightens out and passes, noting the group waving back.
“You betcha. I loved my job, and the plan was to apply for something in Sioux Falls law enforcement in January, but now I’m thinking of trying to find something different — something part time.
Miracle puts his ears up and makes a questioning whine. Dean just laughs, and takes a minute to put some water in his travel bowl and leaves it on the floor, since it seems as good a place as any.
Dean realizes that the yell came from the back, where he sees a couple of men who look to be in their 60s sitting at a small table.
“Cas and I have been talking about a lot of people and angels, and the last time they were all together was your wedding.”
The extended Winchester family becomes occupied with discussing the route back and traffic issues, while Jack and Jeremy say goodbye. Mel and Nat watch surreptitiously.
Jeremy says, “I get that things around here aren’t perfect, but they’re still good. It seems real — you all have a real family.”
“Yeah, saw that. I thought that I didn’t like seeing emotion from my parents, but now I get that we really don’t show emotions in the first place. No, that’s not exactly what I mean, but I can’t figure it out how to put it yet. It’s just not like how you guys show emotions.”
After the group of four gets back down to the main level, Dean says, “Screw the luggage for now. I need a beer, or at least a Diet Coke.”
Dean feels off somehow. Achy. Almost pained. The music seems to recede as Cas walks to the booth and slides in next to Dean.
“Maybe not the new album. It makes me sad.” At Jack’s surprised look he adds, “Hey, I don’t live under a rock, and I have feelings.”
“I’m named after my grandfather on mom’s side,” Jack says, but then pauses. “And if you ever have a problem my family can help with, you should call my mom. She’s the most likely to be available.”
“This is money that you and I should have had long ago, Dean. It’s something real that Henry Winchester thought he did for his family, and it got taken away without his even knowing, and that’s why it’s important to me. It’s Henry’s gift for his grandchildren. About $100,000 cash and that’s including about sixty years of interest. for you and me, plus a larger family trust fund. It’s something I’ve been working on with Charlie for months.”
“So you know the alliterative friend group?” Asks Dean as Cas makes a choking sound. Dean pats Cas’ back, with one hand and pushes some water over with the other.
Mel tells Nat, “He’s like you.” If Nat felt like responding, he’d ask her to clarify her sentence which is entirely lacking in clear antecedents. Instead he chooses a different response.
“Awww. Why’d you get so sleepy boy? You’re in the middle of everything.” Dean kneels and boops his nose. Miracle makes a whine full of grievance. “Come on, boy.” Miracle twists on his back a couple times and then rights himself. “Hey now, walk it out,” says Dean standing up and walking back to the dining room getting Miracle to follow, albeit slowly.
Rowena looks around. “There’s still an opportunity to get in on the ground floor as my favorite niece.”
“They’re in his theater appreciation class. They go to plays and performances together. The women may be in a sorority together, or maybe they just sat alphabetically by first name? I don’t know how he got an alliterative friend group.”
“You may not get bored anymore, but you still need some hobbies with human interaction,” says Cas. “Otherwise you’ll start to seem weird.”
Jody shakes her head, knowing there are mixed reactions to being called a kiddo in that group. Donna just winks, not worried.
“No, just what we’ve already talked about — normal life stuff. They’re actually more disorienting, but definitely less scary.”
“If we were with the family, that’s where you’d insert a wink or a flirty look to get them all groaning.”
Jimmy has taken to wearing a NOT CAS t-shirt when he runs in shared heavenly spaces. Huntercorp Dean is making his safe, sane, and consensual way through heaven’s non-soulmated population. The Bobbies aren’t close, but the Charlies consider themselves siblings, and both are coming tonight.
Sam starts. “Listen up everyone, Rowena will update us on Hell and Heaven — with some help from Gadreel and Kelly.
Mary shrugs indicting that it might not be all that fun. “It’s good to see him work on relationships. It’s been a very long time. He’s got a lot of people to try to make up with.”
Sam says, “Mel reminded me of mom with her hair and that jacket, but she doesn’t look anything like her really.”
“You guys are fun,” she says to Sam. “Don’t worry. And Nat can deal with some noise when he comes in.”
“I don’t know — ask me later,” says Jeremy. Noticing Jack has a bit of frown, Jeremy says, “It was good though. I wouldn’t mind going back to tackle the room with all the mirrors, or maybe some more touristy stuff that’s around town — street art, statues. But I’m looking forward to being in one place for a while.”
“You look nice,” says Cas with a smile. Dean’s in a simple solid green henley with a denim shirt on top and jeans that are darker and less worn than he normally wears.
Sam sighs, and says, “Yeah, actually I think you’re right. I had times like that at Stanford.” Sam nods, and then drops the topic. “Ok, so dinner’s about ready,” Sam turns around to Eileen, signing and saying “What’s left to do?”
Charlie looks at Dean and as she sits says, “Why is that polite young man hanging out with you guys?”
“C’mere boy. I’ll take that off for you.” He takes the bow off and Miracle gives a good shake. “I’m surprised someone didn’t magic this on you. You looked sharp most of the day, though.” Miracle gives him a lick and then lays down next to him on the couch.
“Rowena told me to say, ‘Auntie Rowena is going keep your Dads from wrecking your fashion sense with plaid at Christmas.’”
It’s a little longer than a minute to wind around the curving private road, but not much more. Dean’s ahead so, he gets to the driveway first. The house has a two story section of windows that makes it look like they have driven up to a small cathedral. The house faces the road but the drive curves around to the side and a three car garage, with a wide rectangle of concrete to park several additional cars.
“He’ll be along after the seating bustle is over,” says Mel, unworried. She sidles up to Cas and Kelly. She says in an atypically soft voice, “He probably caught the feels. That’s one reason I can’t take him to the movies. He cries at just about everything, and doesn’t like people to see.” She shakes her head like it’s a trial she’s suffered for years; although, she does it with a smile. “He just has to think about something else for a few minutes. I’ll save him a seat.”
Everyone sits on the barstools around the island as Sam sets a tall glass of water in front of Dean, and opens a beer bottle to slide over next to it. He says. “It’s close enough to dinner time. Just stay hydrated. Cas?”
“You know I wouldn’t have minded,” says Rowena with a wink, “but you wouldn’t want to embarrass the boys.”
“Your uncle, sorry, your other dad Sam went to a lot of trouble,” says Jeremy as they take a turn that’s well-marked with a ballon and sign showing an arrow and a picture of Dean’s Impala.
Jeremy wants to start several different lines of argument, including that safety aside, it’s just gross, but decides on a tactical retreat.
Kelly goes to reclaim and refreshen her mug of hot chocolate, and Cas gets two beers out of the fridge, looking atypically shaky and on the verge of tears.
Cas and Jack come out in much less time than Dean and Jack. Dean helps Jeremy up and gives him a pat on the back. Jack comes over and gives Jeremy a hug, which Jeremy wills himself not to break before Jack does. Being in team competitions, Jeremy’s had half a dozen guys throw themselves at him and squeeze him, while lifting him off the ground and jumping up and down, so hugs aren’t foreign or anything to freak out about. He doesn’t usually hug friends with quiet hugs like this, but apparently, Jack and Cas are determined to make him a hugger, so he’s going to just go with it.
Cas looks over to Kelly who agrees saying, “I haven’t noticed anything scary.” Dean hasn’t talked to her, so he just shrugs.
Jeremy is told that the plan for today is a family dinner, and a slumber party. The party consists of a lesbian holiday rom-com, maybe some holiday specials, s’mores around the fire, and back inside for what Dean called ‘girly stuff’ — which seems to be misnamed, since everyone, including Dean, seems to be taking part — and then the Mandalorian finale. Sam and Eileen have a date night, but they’ll be back in time for s’mores. Tomorrow he gets to sleep in and then meet his parents for late lunch. He’s feeling ok with it, but he’s thinks going to miss Jack’s family more than makes sense.
“Text or whatever for a while, and then lay down like you’re going to bed. I’ll lie down here and we’ll see how it goes.” He takes his shoes off and lies down and listens to Jack text for a bit. He considers that the effort to point out the downside of bunk beds may backfire, and he may wind up having to sleep here. It doesn’t sound like Jack is bumping his elbows on the rails, or twisting around to get comfortable, which is what would have happened if he were up there trying to text. These beds seem wider and longer than usual. Maybe he shouldn’t have made a fuss. There’s the typical creaking from the person on top shifting positions, but it’s not that bad.
The second game is a role reversal. Claire shoots efficiently and quickly without any unnecessary movement, and Jack shows off with his own double bank. Suddenly, Jack gets a look on his face that people rarely see. It’s purely mischevious.
“Come on y’all! It’s ready.” She sounds more like she’s welcoming them to family dinner than bringing food to a restaurant booth. Dean grabs Cas by the arm and pulls them back to their seats. Surprisingly, Sam’s vegetable plate is a complete misnomer. It’s taken
Jody is glowing. “Sometimes you don’t put two and two together as soon as you should, but I think some of us in the room know about that,”she smiles and looks pointedly at Dean and Cas.
Everyone in the car sighs, except Kelly who raises a perfectly arched eyebrow at him. Cas pats Dean on the thigh and says, “Thank you for asking, Dean.”
The Lance reference is to Lance Armstrong. Dean's not talking about performance enhancing drugs. He really means the win at any cost attitude.
“Could I have a beer?” asks Claire. There’s a general chorus of “No!” so Sam offers a root beer. Claire rolls her eyes and puts a hand out.
“He’s still in the boys’ room. I thought we’d leave him there until you finished eating. There’s a key card for their room on the dresser, but I can bring him over now.”
“Good thing you’re getting a University of South Dakota lil’ sis sweatshirt for Christmas,” says Alex with a smirk. “You’ll blend right in.”
Eileens smiles and says, “This is the last meal Sam and I plan on doing for the holidays. Dean can take over.”
Jack walks around the rec room and tells everyone to say hi. The sisters wave like crazy, except Alex who waves once, and then burrows back down into her blankets on the sofa. Canada asks how the Dads are doing, and Jack makes the mistake of taking the phone up to the kitchen to see if they’re there to say hi to Canada, and catches Dean and Cas in the middle of an actual brief, chaste, kiss, without excessive tension or flirting. Cas even holds a bee mug full of tea the entire time. Canada squeals loud enough to be heard and declares Jack’s dads cute af. Cas is hard to startle, so the mug stays in one piece, and there’s only a slight slosh. Dean turns red and leaves. Cas rolls his eyes, sets his mug down, and takes the phone, and he and Canada greet each other briefly, then he hands the phone back to Jack and goes in search of Dean. Jack slides onto a barstool.
“Whoa,” Dean says as they pass a large set of hot pink wings — apparently angel wings — on a white background.
They’ve reached a small lull in the larger talk. Donna goes to help Dean, and the rest of the group breaks into smaller conversations for a while. Nat has been looking fairly comfortable talking to Cas and Sam. Mel has meshed well with Jody, helped by an avoidance of mentioning guns, but after a bit Mel turns her attention to Kelly, and asks with a nudge, “Hey, do you really like akvavit?”
“I said, take a deep breath in slow, and then out, which you should do, too. Calm down, Dean,” Jeremy says in an even but hard voice.
“You’ll get there,” says Dean. “Jack has great timing — never burns anything. Just needs to master the flip without breaking the yolk.”
“Amen, brother,” says Dean from the kitchen. “It’s hard seeing the world as it is, but I still wouldn’t trade it for anything.”
“I don’t know if I’m safe to hold Marvin. I might throw him at the tv,” says Jeremy regretfully. He’s taken the treatment of Kristen’s character badly.
Cas and Jack take that opportunity to laugh and look knowingly at each other, and Dean even hears a snicker from behind the camera.
Also, if she can find someone willing to commit to working for her once they get a counseling degree, he might be able to help them with paying back loans. They promise to talk about the idea in January. Sam mentions that Patience might want to start talking to her, too. Mia sighs and says that she can try to work her into the schedule in late-January. Sam says it's an extra incentive for him to find her help, and he’ll get together with Charlie on it.
Bobby gave him a hard eye roll and put his hand to his heart. “Figure it out.” He turned back to Sam. “Eileen is back. She spent a long time with her parents, getting to know them. They’re here, too.” Tears started rolling down Sam’s face, but he had a big smile. He ran in.
It’s a rush of cold, cold, air. Gravity and uneven weight distribution makes them rotate and slide down at the same time. They get a roller coaster stomach drop effect over one of the big bumps. Jack and Kelly scream just for the fun of it, and then they’re already approaching the end. A big snowbank is meant to slow their momentum, and a tall, but soft plastic fence is behind it. As the tube slides to a stop it seems to climb up the bank pretty far.
“This says that a freak cold current refroze the meltwater in the holes this year, and that may substantially add to the time we have to combat global warming.”
“Hey, I’ve got some stranger’s kid driving and his electric car to charge. No way we’re going up a mountain in the dark. Ya gotta cut me some slack here.”
“My father thought that I couldn’t go to college if I tried to help people. I’m proving that I didn’t have to be perfect or go to an Ivy. The University of South Dakota may not be Harvard, but I’m learning what I need to know. Nothing has to hold me back. I’m sure I can get into medical school. I should be happy, but it all makes me so angry.”
“Yeah, no prob,”says Claire in a deadpan voice. “Wow. You guys are a college bookstore window, huh?” She points at the three of them. Jeremy washed his Rock Chalk sweatshirt and it’s making an appearance again. Jack looks down as if to remind himself what he’s wearing — it’s another of Rowena’s sweaters. Kaia slips a hand on Claire’s thigh as much as in warning as in affection. Cas shifts a little closer on Claire’s other side.
“I feel like Miracle is the dog version of Jack. He’s always smiling and calm,” confesses Charlie. “How do you manage it, Dean?”
Kelly sighs, and sees that Miracle is on one of the recliners, on his back, legs kicking occasionally, fast asleep. She leaves him there and decides, since she’s on a roll with doing things the fast way, she should just mojo the rec room neat.
They find the bunk bed room, and Jeremy goes to sit on the bottom bunk. “First thing, I’m really going want you to take your shoes off if you’re going to be stepping above me.” At Jack’s slight pout, Jeremy adds, “Please.”
Claire smiles. “That never stopped me, but since Dean’s cutting down, I figure I should cut down, too.”
It’s not just about you — it’s about me, too. And now crazy as it seems, that sweet kid isn’t a kid anymore. He’s God.” The both look down for a minute. Dean finally says, “Have you talked to Jack about this?”
They’re near the pink wings again, when Cas stops. “Jack, let’s go ahead and take a picture here. You and me.” Jeremy and Dean direct them to the middle of the wings and Jack stands in front of Cas. Cas lays his chin on Jack’s shoulder and they both smile for the camera. Then Jack decides to give Cas a hug so he turns a bit and they have a sideways hug with their heads close together. Cas gives him a kiss on the forehead and they declare themselves done. They move away so other people can take pictures at the wings, but they stop a few minutes to look the images on the cameras.
“Nope. We’re on our own. Don’t bother the dads tonight unless you want to be scarred for life — that’s what Sam says — but, Dean and Cas made us cookies earlier.”
Dean looks up. “I thought you weren’t coming? Didn’t want to overwhelm them with too many people and all?”
“Charlie would probably know what to do, too. She works with computer systems and she’s coming in a few days, so you’ll meet her.”
The waitress stops by and Dean regretfully passes on having the pie with lunch, as he doesn’t want to get to drowsy on more carbs and sugar. Cas gives him an approving look, and orders a couple of pecan pie slices to go, since they should keep in the cooler.
The conversation shifts to holiday plans, and Sam mentions the idea of skiing or snowboarding again, offering a family lesson session. Cas and Dean decline, and Jack looks at Jeremy, who turns it right back with, “What do you think?”
Jeremy gives a defeated groan and says, “You’re too young for this Dad thing you do. Why are you so extra?”
Jack spots something and motions them over. “Oh, this is cool. I saw this one online. The bed is attached to the wall so when you walk on the floor, you can look like you’re walking on the walls, or jump and look like you’re falling.”
After the table is cleared, Rowena reveals that she also brought holiday decorations, so the lack of a tree is solved. Gadreel sets up a very tall one in the living room by himself and Rowena has him stack ornament boxes ready for tree trimming when the sisters come. Everyone else grabs wreaths, bows, and swags to tie on doors, rails, and lay on tables. Presents get rearranged under the tree.
Jeremy finds himself learning that he needs to choose what to focus on with this trip, so he avoids asking about being scarred for life and asks, “Cookies?”
“Yeah, it’s like a deer on the highway,” sighs Charlie. “You don’t know if they’re going to run the right way, the wrong way, or stand still.”
“Babe, you were so stressed out at the beginning of this whole thing,” counters Dean. “We had a talk about it.”
“You have to have a hell of a lot of trust built up to tell a civilian that you’re going to fake punch them and here’s how to move. He doesn’t know Claire well enough,” says Dean with arms crossed.
Jack smiles, exceptionally pleased with himself, and runs through his group chats. Carmen says she won’t forgive him if he doesn’t send her pics of his Dads and the gifts she helped him to pick out. He shakes his head. He should also send Canada pics wearing his new sweaters. She says that she’s become invested in his Look and is determined to glow him up. She’s threatening to call his Aunt Rowena, which the Dads would definitely not like. He’s starting to get hungry and pulls a nougat bar out of his backpack. The rustle catches Jeremy’s attention and he surfaces from under the throw. “My aunt sent me a finals present. I’ve got paper in my wallet. Want to order food? It’ll be on me.”
They join everyone around the dining table, already chatting. Claire shifts to sit beside Cas. She says, “I sense a disturbance in the Force,” and lays her head on his shoulder. A tear rolls down his cheek, then Cas gives her a big hug and snuggles his head next to hers for a minute. He gives her a kiss on her head, strokes her hair, and says, “I love you, Claire.”
Jeremy hands Jack a wrapped box. “I guess this is from me and your mom, since she bought this when I asked her to. I didn’t have the time to get it.”
When Charlie and Gertie arrive, they bring presents, and everyone realizes that not having a tree may be awkward. They make a pile in the living room and Charlie introduces Gertie. Jeremy finds himself doing a Jack-like wave and blushes slightly at the imitation.The group goes to sit, and Gertie takes out some knitting needles and a project, which keeps her hands occupied and lets her eyes flit back and forth. Dean and
Cas is silent holding Dean’s hand as they go upstairs. He’s looking distracted and not at all present. Once they’re up, Cas pulls Dean to him, and then pushes him against the wall where he gives him a thorough kiss. Then he looks at Dean, and asks, “Still in your head.”
We have a priority for communities and individuals who have experienced trauma, so we can target places where there were cases — missing persons, murders, kidnappings. We’ll know that the causes were supernatural, but the civilian causes are good enough to meet our official grant priority criteria. A lot of hunter deaths wind up being counted as murders or missing persons, so we can fund mental health charities that support their families. As long as we grant a certain amount in trauma-related categories, we have some flexibility. Let’s say some hunters wanted to start their own version of AA where they could be honest about the reasons for their drinking in meetings, we could have them apply for a grant to do that. Or let's say that a pack of lycanthropes wanted to start a housing cooperative with child care, they could apply for a grant.
Dean looked at Cas who was filled with joy. There was just one thing left. Dean looked over to the jukebox and it starting playing Zeppelin.
He looked around, and then saw Castiel’s wings for the first time in his life. He gasped at the dark feathers as they caught the bright light from the sunset and exploded into iridescent rainbows. They spread out as he hovered for a moment and then pulled down as he stepped lightly on the ground in front of him. Dean launched himself at Cas, and would have tackled him to the ground if Cas’ wings hadn’t stretched out again to keep them upright.
They go park the cars then walk up. As they get closer, it’s clear that as far as features go, Jeremy looks just like his mom. There's something very strong about her, and it’s not just her jawline. Dean thinks of hunters like Tara, Ellen, and of course Mary. He gets Jeremy’s comment about his mom being nice until she isn’t.
“I knew you’d say that,” says Sam. Jeremy just shrugs. He imagines Huntercorp is probably a reference to the giant hunting and fishing stores that he sees every so often, like
“Oh is it? I’ll let Claire and Kaia know.” Dean looks over and sees Cas staring at him as if questioning his life choices.
Cas laughs with tears in his eyes, says, “Yes, we do. It wasn’t always that way. I’ll tell you what I’ve told Jack in the past. Dean feels things more acutely than any human I’ve ever known.”
“Stay here with me, then.” Cas gives him a softer kiss and says, “I love you, Dean. That doesn’t mean we won’t have to talk about it later, though. ”
Patience says, “We can stick it out with you,” looking at Jody and Donna who nod, “Then we watch Rudolf.”
This chapter's Important Issue: why the heck does Jack wear his shoes when he sits on his bed?! What is that?
Mel raises an eyebrow at the invitation to use his nickname, indicating that’s unusual. Dean steers Sam to Mel, wondering if maybe he got a little shaken from seeing her from behind, too, and needs a nudge. Dean lets Cas introduce him and Nat nods. Kelly easily greets Nat. He doesn’t seem like one inclined to small talk, but as he was the one who suggested Sam come, he initiates talking to Sam, saying, “Thank you for coming,” and making polite inquiries into his work preparations for the new year. Cas has already gotten Mel’s approval via many texts, phone calls, emails, and shared bee article links so he gets an enthusiastic air kiss, but rather than monopolize him, she seems to think she should spend more time talking to everyone she doesn’t know and chatters to Dean, Kelly and Jack, letting Nat talk to Sam and Cas. Her face, voice, and body language are nothing like Mary’s, and things seem back to normal.
Soon everyone is enjoying pancakes, bacon and scrambled eggs. Kelly causes a stir by drenching her pancakes in maple syrup, and using a fork to push her bacon and eggs around until they’re covered in syrup, too. As they finish up, Sam looks at Eileen and she nods.
“We’ve had our special moment. Just being with family and friends is what we want,” says Eileen. “So let’s go tubing. We can keep it quick and simple and go to the local hill in Frisco.”
“Mom, I love you. You sacrificed yourself for me. Not just when I was born, but giving up being human.”
The corners of Jeremy’s mouth tic up a little bit. Jeremy thinks about how when Jack texts his slang seems natural, but when he uses it while talking, it always sounds like he’s quoting someone else — not that he uses a ton of slang either. He thinks about how he and Jack are both only children, and probably grew up more used to talking to adults. That gets him thinking about his parents, and he shoves those thoughts down hard. He tries to refocus on Dean’s classic car up the road ahead of them.
“Look, I’m just teasing, but you have to admit that he didn’t seem shy or awkward at the the restaurant. You may be over-reacting,” says Dean defending himself.
Sam goes to bitch face, and Cas and Eileen give matching exasperated looks and crossed arms. Snickers and clicks of disapproval are heard.
“No, I can tell you some things. There’s not much I haven’t already said to Jack. I get angry at them, but I don’t hate them. I just don’t understand them. Dad’s been asking me to think about how I want to spend vacations, and they say they’re fine with us all being together for some of them. Then I wonder why get divorced if you like spending time together? I guess it comes down to both of them wanting to be out on their own. They tell me that… ” He looks at Jack, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t go on. I mean your mom was on her own for a while, and nothing seems weird about her being here with you and your dads now. And I can’t imagine Cas without Dean.”
Kelly looks up and sees the group approaching, so she gives Patience’s other hand a squeeze, then goes to meet Sam and they head over to Baby. Dean and Charlie come up with Jack and Jeremy.
“Executive Director — it would be to my advantage if he looked and found something wrong. Then I could fix things before we get going, but I don’t know if he’d want to take the time. There are rules about donating services if someone consults for charities, issues about valuation and hours, and on our side, we have to track in-kind donations… ”
“Nah, Spanish has a lab — it’s four credits instead of three. All those B’s put me just under 3.5, I’m sure, but I’ll work it out later.”
“That was my first thought, too. Especially since he’s specifically interested about the non-profit. He is a financial analyst, and from Charlie’s checking, a damn good one. He’s probably consults all around the Midwest.”
“Cas doesn’t like the angel cookie cutters. He chops off the body and smushes the head down. I think he needs better cookie cutter shapes. Hey, I should have thought of that for Christmas.”
“Hey Jack, now we know which row to try for on the way back,” says Jeremy giving Jack a nudge with his arm.
“I offered to pick them up if they wanted to return a rental car, and then not have two cars to take back. I think we might stay in Denver a day or two before going to St. Louis. I’ll check in with them again later.”
When everyone is resettled on the couch, Claire asks, “Soo, moving on to the elephant in the room, how are you and the ‘rents?” Kaia rolls her eyes.
The sisters walk down to the road and back in the cold air. Jack goes to get Marvin. Kelly selects photos for a new IG post and lingers over hot chocolate with whipped cream, and everyone else turns to Donna as she pours coffee to freshen up everyone’s mugs.
“Will you let me work up to talking to my parents in the morning? I know it would be better for you to call your dads tonight, but...,” he just shrugs. “I think my parents will be ok with it, but I’ll have to FaceTime them.”
When Jack texts that they’re about half an hour away Dean gets Baby running. The Impala has been sitting packed all morning, so there’s not much to grab. Cas gets settled as shotgun with Miracle in his lap, a wet nose pressed to Baby’s front passenger window. Dean called his go-to diner to make arrangements for Miracle earlier, so they’re all set.
“Hold on Dean give me one second.” Cas? He was sure that was his voice. He heard Cas get up and move around wherever they were. Sounded like linoleum flooring. Where were they? They weren’t at home. What happened? His brain felt fuzzy. He heard the pull of window shades and then Cas walking back. “You can open your eyes now, I pulled down the shades.”
Second week in a row this came out a bit later than I originally planned X...X there's a couple different reasons. One being work but me and my new boss changed up my schedule and I think things should go more smoothly now. The second reason was that I ended up rewriting this chapter. I hated the original idea and didn't like the flow. It felt forced and not natural. I am much happier with what I have now. It's been a bit of a struggle to figure out how far to skip forward and where to slow down. I have big events planned but it's the connecting scenes that require a bit more of my attention decided what to do with them. Here's looking to saturday's chapter, which part of was pulled from the original draft of this chapter. Thank you so much guys <3 <3 <3
I swear I went through sooooooo many different roommates for Cas everything from Donatello, Max banes, and a few others. Donatello and Max will show up later but they weren't quite what I was looking for. In the end it was a tough choice between Kelvin and Alan. Ghostfacer's won in the end XD. I think it'll add something special to the story lol
“I am sure my uncle will make the ending as best as he can for everyone.” Cas had gotten off the phone with his uncle. Chuck had given him permission to tell Dean that they’d decided on a book cut off number. It was still going to be a while before the series ended but his uncle said he needed to put a number on it or he’d never stop writing. He had other ideas and projects he wanted to work on.
He got the feeling Cas was just working along with his stuff going step at a time. Normally that would work for him but Dean figured with so many things going on at once the poor guy needed more structure, more guidelines to keep him on track. He hoped Cas wouldn’t get pissed.
“Sound like Andrea an’ my Ma.” He could hear Benny laughing on the other end. “Actually, I am all signed up tah get more trainin’. Gonna go get my Paramedic certification, maybe even fire science degree. Chief says I’ve got promise an’, well I can see myself doing dis for da long haul.”
“Cas it happens. It’s not like you didn’t talk to them before. They were being rude, Alan wasn’t being a good roommate. Yes, you got mad and lost your cool. But, it’s not something that happens normally and they pushed you to that point. Babe, it’s okay.” Dean gave him a loving smile, Cas could practically feel it through the phone.
“Ash is awesome and super laid back he was happy to offer.” Dean opened up the impala and slid into the driver seat.
He practically had to drag Cas along the sidewalk, while some people might be bothered by it Dean found it both hilarious and adorable. He wouldn’t give up grumpy pants for anything.
“It was nice of your roommate to spend the night with his girlfriend.” Michael had offered for them to get a hotel room but Ash offered up his spot when he overheard them talking.
Castiel followed closely behind. He cocked his head to the side. “What do you mean?” His deep voice only showing a hint of confusion. He wasn't quite sure what the hunter was angry about.
While Gad was off having fun the rest of them had been drinking. Cas and Michael at some point got into some sort of competition and were now leaning against each other and were very well into being drunk.
Cas had to remind himself of Mary’s words and drove carefully to the hospital. He was lucky enough to find a good parking spot, he sent Mary a text and hurried inside.
“You’re one to talk. Okay so tell me what’s the damage.” He hadn’t really moved much or even looked over himself this whole time. His focus all on Cas. Now that he looked over himself he saw that his left arm was in a sling.
“We can go out instead, or we could do both?” Dean nudged him. “Bit like Halloween last year. Party first then some alone time afterwards.”
Dean rolled his eyes, “shut up.” His tone playful. “I don't need running. I am about to show you just how fit I am. “ His voice had gone deeper, the words sent a pleasant warm shiver through Cas. Arousal? Yes, that is what it was. He liked it a lot. Next thing he knew Dean had pulled off his shirt and kicked the door closed behind him. “Come here Angel.” A sexy smirk on his lips as he made his way towards Cas.
