John answered the phone with a groan and a cough.
of a show off.” He stood back and looked as though he was admiring the picture that Sherlock and John presented and then he patted Moran twice on the arm. “Have at them, but be sure to tidy yourself up before leaving. No undue attention!”
John continued to click through the tabs and when he was finished, he set the laptop down on the table. “That’s an awful lot to be going on and if it’s true, he’s not only likely been cheating since the beginning of his career, he’s responsible for other deaths.”
In bright, bold white letters the subject reads,
; he kept shaving milliseconds off of his finishes with ease.
“It’s John Watson!” she shouts back and then cringes, her teeth a straight line in her mouth. “Your date is John Watson.”
It would be a different story altogether, Sherlock realized, if Moriarty were a better skier than he was, but he
,” Sherlock shoots back immediately, slightly taken aback at his own boldness.
The car arrived and they shuffled in; John waited for the door to close before he explained himself. “Because
“I do,” Sherlock said, his hands clasped behind his back.
They wandered through the lobby in silence and John slung an arm behind his back as he bowed forward to press the ‘up’ button for the elevator. “Tonight… you ah, you don’t do things like that often.”
John raises a brow, looks around the room and then types back a response.
Dehydrated, probably.
“Yeah,” John hides his full mouth with the back of his hand.
Sherlock’s hands, which had been on John’s face, moved to bracket John’s hips and then slipped down to cup his arse, pulling him open. Sherlock was lost to the sensation of John clenching around him, the delicious drag and pull of his body and the feeling of the muscles working beneath John’s skin.
he feels John’s eyes follow him out.
and how would he explain that in the seconds before the countdown beeps sounded he was thinking about every single moment of the rest of his life? How could he explain that he felt both larger than life and a single miniscule being that existed in the unfathomable cosmos? How could he explain, anything,
“Right, right,” Sherlock swallowed even as his mouth went dry. “Right.” Gaze darting around the room, he looked for somewhere they could hide and spotted a door in an alcove to the right of entertainment system. He was annoyed with himself for not spotting it as soon as they’d gotten inside but was grateful he’d noticed it now. “There, across the room.”
“Stop,” Sherlock says, sighs as he closes his eyes. “Just… let me.”
It’s a sunny, balmy late afternoon as they walk among the tourists in Regent’s Park, the dog keeping to Sherlock’s right, uninterested in the birds or the passersby who speak to him in disgusting childish voices. It seems as though Redbeard knows his owner needs him, and he keeps close by until Sherlock begins to speak.
and so
–that Guest had a very, very good reason for not showing up. He has to win John’s trust back, as both Guest and as Sherlock Holmes, has to earn John’s affection, his attention, his friendship.
John’s gaze darted between Molly and Mike, waiting for an explanation.
John flicked his gaze back and forth between the two men as he shifted nervously to the front of his seat, hands clasped tightly in front of his mouth.
a friend.
“That is of no consequence to me,” Sherlock said, eyes still on the skis.
John types it out, finger by finger, his stomach turning further and further in his body until it feels like it’s flipped clear over inside of him. He squints at the screen, frowns, shrugs, frowns
, Sherlock had been careless and stupid, and Mycroft’s voice flitted through his mind, chastising him.
Sherlock hunkered down, setting his gaze resolutely at a point on the wall, and started another set of reps, pressing down and back against the resistance, working his triceps.
John licked his lips and Sherlock’s eyes openly followed the trail of his tongue. “The rumors. Are they… true?”
John’s face is blank for a moment before he steps up, takes Sherlock’s face between his hands and kisses him softly, deeply, and it lasts for ages and ages. John finds himself overheated and shrugs out of his jacket before helping Sherlock push his own off of his shoulders. They stay like that, entwined in the greenhouse as the sun sets over the ocean, kissing.
“We are,” Sherlock states in the same moment John says, “Acquaintances at most.” It’s best, John thinks, to keep Sherlock at arm’s length; he hadn’t considered before that it might be the most pragmatic way to approach this situation.
“Yeah,” John growled, gritting his teeth for a brief moment before twisting his head and biting at Sherlock’s neck. “Yeah, do it.”
He’s tearing off his dressing gown and tossing it away, moving bare through the kitchen to his bedroom and pulling on the nearest serviceable suit. He’ll take his Belstaff to the cleaners, he’ll get a coffee, he’ll visit Molly and-
It’s all a bit baffling, dumbfounding, exhilarating and terrifying, but as Sherlock snuffles and wriggles back, John decides to make a concerted effort to let it go. A slow breath blown out and John closes his eyes.
John swallowed and tilted his chin in Greg’s direction. “On the plane actually, we both took a seat at the back of the plane-”
He feels Sherlock sigh against him, every trace of tension melting away. John realizes that it may take some time for Sherlock to fully understand the varying intricacies of his own heart, and that it’s best not to overwhelm him, especially after an evening of laden with emotional revelations. “Now, unless you fancy getting glued together by all of this spunk, I suggest we wash up.”
He clicks on it first, not bothering with the email to Scotland Yard.
“Mmm, sex coma, can’t talk,” John huffed quietly, face smooshed into the pillow.
And Sherlock is still and silent in the half-light; the small fixture above the sink in the loo is on, casting a sliver of yellow through the doorway and John just looks his fill. Sherlock swallows and John watches the movement of his Adam’s apple, can’t seem to tear his eyes away.
“Probably, yeah, a good idea. Think he broke a rib… or seven.” John’s eyes fell closed as he took a deep breath. He was bloodied and bruised but he wasn’t broken; he looked like a miracle to Sherlock. When his eyes peeled open, they settled, concerned, on Sherlock’s face. “Are you? Are you alright, Jesus, Sherlock...”
He swallows, prepares himself, reaches over to grab at his cane, like he already knows how Sherlock is going to respond. “Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime… far too much.”
“John,” Sherlock begins, voice low, words impeded somewhat by the duvet he has tucked up to just beneath his nose.
Sherlock hums, his right thumb tracing the entire curve of John’s ear. “I’m a genius, John.”
John’s brow furrows at that, and he rereads the last line of text. Could it be that Guest is a man? Could Guest be referring to the convention that “women are attracted to men with dogs”? John knows that this isn’t necessarily the case but he’s heard the line enough times to think that perhaps this is what Guest is referring to.
up to what we think he is…”
“It does wonders if you know what to do with it, it really does. But you have to
Molly’s eyes are very nearly slits. “For a case? You meet people all the time. Why are you-” and then her eyes widen and a cheeky grin slides up onto her face. “Oh! You mean!
“Do you remember,” John begins, voice low, “the day after we met. I came to the flat to give it a look and thought it was just, chaos.” He laughs to himself and runs his lips against Sherlock’s shoulder. “And all of a sudden, you were whirling around, tossing things in boxes, trying to tidy. I think that’s when I… when it all started.”
John takes a breath and steps forward, no hesitation, and enters the dimly-lit space; there’s not much room, but it’s not a bother, John sliding around Sherlock’s body to bump him out of the spray and Sherlock moves back, mock-indignant.
“That said,” John’s lips trailed from behind Sherlock’s ear before he sat back, bent and ran his upper teeth lightly over Sherlock’s Adam’s apple. “I’ve had you, isn’t time you have me?”
their items - they headed out of the Village and down the main thoroughfare.
“Ah,” John said, ducked his head and then grinned, turning the full force of his smile on Sherlock. “Well, good.”
Biting at his own bottom lip, Sherlock heaved in a large breath, gearing up for what he was about to say. “John you should know… I don’t do… this.”
He flung off his sweats and pulled on clean work out gear, knowing he would find at least a bit of solace in the gym. Slinging a bag with a towel and water bottle over his shoulder, Sherlock flung open the door and went to charge out of the room but was stopped by a large hand pressing forcefully into the front of his chest.
“Alright, how do you two know one another? Did he follow you home, because Sherlock doesn't have friends.” Greg asked mock-innocently, head ducked down towards the table, eyes angled up and glancing between Sherlock and John.
“Athletes being snarky with one another is hardly evidence to go on,” Sherlock frowned. “Though I think we’re all in agreement that he’s behind all of this…”
“Who said I was going to work with you?” John asks defiantly, his fingers digging into his biceps.
But he can’t. And so, he settles for a vaguely poetic truth.
“You’re no longer my coach,” Sherlock drawled, testily.
: Fuck it. I was invalided out of the army.
“Yes.” Sherlock breathes, and now he’s focused entirely on John’s mouth. There’s a space of silence that John’s body takes as a chance to light up every nerve within him, drag him to the edge of expectation. “Now, kiss me.”
Sherlock doesn’t take his eyes off of John, just smiles placidly and says, “Yes, I know.”
“Sorry,” John is confused, pressing his fore and middle finger to the center of his forehead and interjects. “Are you quoting
, he was
John opens his mouth to reply but by then Angelo has disappeared. “Guess that makes divvying up the check easier,” John jests and Sherlock gives him a shocked half smile. He would have expected John to make it plain that they’re not here on a date, but it seems that John is full of surprises.
“Oh, right.” John’s face flushes pink at the embarrassing oversight. He doesn’t want to concede anything to this very obviously haughty man; Sherlock’s entire bearing, from his posh clothes to his obvious public-school upbringing digs at the lower-class chip that John has on his shoulder.
“And you?”
“No,” Sherlock growls. “I’ve just come from seeing Molly Hooper.”
He regards himself in the mirror and then checks the time, gone just after six. He still has three hours until he meets with John5NF and he’s at a total and complete loss for how to fill it. Normally he’d begin an experiment or search for a lead in the case, but he doesn’t want to run the risk of getting too involved and missing the… meeting.
He’s not happy, he’s miles from normal, but when the coffee maker clicks off and he gets a waft of freshly brewed beans, he smiles and finds that he’s content for this very brief moment.
department, you’re not bad. And, and… I think… that you-”
His ankles twinged and his jaw hurt; he felt raw and beaten but not broken. He’d do his absolute best, that was all he could ask for himself. If he was going to go hard, put his body through the ringer, at least he wouldn’t have to worry about the long recuperation times before he could get back on the slopes again--he wouldn’t have to get back on the slopes again if he didn’t want to.
John chuckled and continued to glance around, touching things here and there until he turned towards the fireplace. Sherlock watched as his eyes settled on the mantle. “You put your medal in a shadowbox? How
Sherlock works a bit more with the tongues once he returns to Baker Street, but after an hour and a half of fidgeting with his microscope he feels restless and bored; it’s only half noon and he doesn’t have anything on for the remainder of the day, which is unacceptable. He putters about the flat, but It’s an hour before he finds himself at New Scotland Yard, gaining entry to the building with the pilfered ID card of one Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade.
“He’s not,” Sherlock said, gravely serious, but Greg just tipped his head and gazed at him for a long moment.
“Tell me, Mycroft,” Sherlock said, sparing one last glance at the scenery outside before sitting down on the bed. “Why were you always so
“Christ,” John laughed, “did you order the whole menu?”
He glances away, down at himself in the water. “Shit, these are see-through,” John has the presence of mind to say.
,” Sherlock growls, knowing full well they’d gotten both his face and his response on tape. Finally taking a cue, the man very nearly scampered away into the crowd.
A groan escaped him and Sherlock melted back into the couch, just catching the edge of a smug smile curling up on John’s face as his eyes slipped closed once more. For a long while there was nothing but the soft sounds John drew from him with his capable hands and the whisper of flesh on flesh.
She puts the bone saw down on the table and strips herself of the overlarge protective gloves she has on. She pushes the safety goggle back, up into her hair and she takes a step forward. “Usually, well… yes, actually.”
John left the restaurant before Sherlock, agreeing to go see what he could do about finding something to act as a pick. Sherlock meanwhile had to ensure that they wouldn’t be caught while inside the villa. He knew Moriarty favored lengthy workouts at the gym and could estimate that it would be another hour before he’d finish up. Still, that was cutting it close; a little extra assurance was in order.
! But another email follows closely on its heels.
John didn’t bother glancing at the clock. “So it is.”
“Dear god, Greg’s taste leaves something to be desired,” John said as Molly wiggled away and moved to get out of the booth.
“No, what did you study, come now. Wait, I’ll guess. Hm, from the papers and the articles you seem like a science buff. I’m going to guess you read physics. Or, no, that’s too… chemistry. You look like the type of bloke that would read chemistry.” There was a mischievous glint in his eye and Sherlock got caught up in it, lips curving into a grin as he looked down the line of his nose at John.
John’s face tilted up and their gazes locked, Sherlock’s expectant, John’s void of all emotion. Sherlock felt a curl of doubt unfurl in his stomach but he didn’t let it reach his eyes; he laid before John and waited.
Their breaths slow and even out, and they both find themselves on their backs, propped up by the abundant bedding. John’s hand slides over, and rests once more atop Sherlock’s thigh. They’re sticky and smell exceedingly of sex, but John doesn’t care; he feels as though he’s finally found rest after wandering aimlessly for years. The lethargy that sinks into his bones is so welcome that he finds himself drifting, Sherlock still and warm beside him.
John’s head lolled back on his shoulders as a quiet groan escaped him. “Just the truth.”
“Yeah, yeah, and he, well, he was impressive. He… yeah,” John said, gulped and turned his attention away, swallowing a few hearty pulls of his beer.
Sherlock sends the email with a stab of the trackpad and sits back, irrationally angry that John would think himself anything other than spectacular. But then, Sherlock knows how easy it is to be self-deprecating; he’s practically medalled in it. For all of his egotism, he’s aware that he’s socially awkward, very odd-looking, and caustic. But, if a man like John can find it in himself to be friendly–
Once he reached the threshold to his room, he drew to a stop, watching in silence as John shed his pants and placed them neatly on top of his other folded clothes on top of a chair. Sherlock’s heart lurched painfully as John turned slightly, fidgeted with his hands, took a step towards the bed and then away, as though trying to figure out what he should do with himself.
It’s incredible.
Moriarty’s voice slowly notched up in anger, the tone becoming shrill. “Because I hadn’t accounted for you!”
A light pressure, exquisite for both, before John backs off. “Hey, just in case it wasn’t clear, this is it for me, I’m gone on you.”
John sighed at the touch and leaned his head back to meet Sherlock’s gaze. “Bath, and then I’ll retape your ribs and then a nap and then…”
“I’m certain that we left no evidence of our presence; he’s likely just referring to what was printed in the papers about the two of us. He has no concrete proof,” Sherlock said reassuringly. Despite his words though, he kept finding his eyes straying to the doorway, caution winning out. No one had any real evidence that anything was going on between the two of them, but over the past day they really hadn’t done much to hide that they knew one another and in fact had grown very close. “Let’s go upstairs and talk about it, Lestrade should be there.”
They parted ways at the hospital, John being whisked off to a new hotel where the other ski team medics were staying. Sherlock agreed with him that it was probably for the best, being around other medical personnel while also providing some distance between them while the reporters were all champing at the bit for a morsel of a story.
“Here,” Sherlock says without preamble and thrusts out a twenty pound note, his elbow just brushing John’s shoulder.
years,” he says and clumsily toes off of his shoes as John works at the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt.
He’d have a shower, make his calls to John and Molly and set about drinking the entirely of the hotel’s supply of bottled water.
you’re good at what you do, anyone can read it all over your face. That… is how I know that you are more than just a suitable doctor, you’re a damn good one.”
“That John and I are?” he presses back, truly curious, now.
“I know the proprietor!” Sherlock blurts as he slides across from John at the table. Then, he remembers he’s still in his coat and can’t decide whether to just leave it on or get up and take it off; he doesn’t want to cause a scene.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock bent and accepted his medal, the synthetic lanyard falling heavy against his neck. His trailed his pointer and middle finger over the weight that rested against his chest. He glanced up and out at the all of the flags, at the people clapping and cheering for
“Why are you buying me coffee?” John lets that hang in the air between them for a moment. “Again.”
Sherlock very nearly felt John pulling away, the gentle camaraderie that they’d somehow managed to build over the past few days withering. It left a hollowness in the center of Sherlock’s chest, but he was rather used to that feeling. “There’s the work of course, and most people are tedious and trite. It’s an absolute nightmare just trying to have a conversation with anyone
John nods, presses his lips together and then leans over, dotting a quick kiss to Sherlock’s mouth. “Okay, goodnight.”
“I cannot believe this,” Sherlock says as he gusts through the door to his suite, the heavy mahogany meeting the jamb again in a loud slam.
“Better to go with someone you have a personal relationship with,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock had responded, feeling as though he’d been caught with his hand in the cookie jar, putting down the mobile phone on which was displayed the delivery number of his favorite Thai place.
He has no words; he wants to say something scathing, get her to leave, but he finds that he doesn’t want to be alone with his thought. How Molly knows this is entirely a mystery to him, but he finds himself walking towards her, the two of them rounding the corner in the direction of Baker Street.
: So, twenty days?
John chuckled without sound and uncrossed his arms, walking over to where Sherlock stood and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Alright, that’s enough, someone’s cranky after their nap,” he poked. “So that’s a yes? You’ll bring this to your contact?”
me, something is up,” Lestrade jests and falls back into his chair, rolls away from his desk a bit. “So, anything?”
. But what then?
Belatedly, he went back and read John’s, the mention of the “course medics” reminding him that he’d never actually read the whole of John’s messages.
Sherlock tossed his head back and barked out a laugh, his whole body shaking with the effort. A giddiness filled him and he found that he couldn’t stop smiling down at his phone as he thought of how to reply.
the seat wasn’t taken and yet he’d asked, obvious and tedious. Beneath his lids Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Things got in the way, yeah, a whole fuckload of things,” he mentions as he toes off his own shoes, stumbling and using Sherlock’s right shoulder for leverage. “But, interruptions and… displacement and…
you to,” he growled and then pressed himself back in so they were chest to chest. “I want you to fuck me.”
“That is mathematically a fact, yes,” Sherlock says gruffly as he hauls John up the last step into the flat.
John blinked up at him in shock, anger rimming his irises, before the look faded away into resignation and acceptance. There was no one else; John wasn’t the sort of man who let his guard down, but he’d done so in front of Sherlock. He’d chosen Sherlock. “...Sorry.”
Sherlock shot him a dazzling grin over his shoulder as he plucked a bottle of wine out of his modest rack. “Will this suit?” Holding the bottle up for John’s inspection, he stepped closer, wrapping a hand around John’s hip.
...” Sherlock whispered vehemently into the air between them.
Sherlock stands, checking his watch, and is shocked to find that it’s nearing quarter past eight. Hastily, he dons his jacket and follows Molly as she weaves through the people towards the door.
could find out was that Hanzu’s neck had broken clearly, he didn’t suffer, he was gone instantly. I asked after his gear, got some weird looks for it, but they said his ski team took it away, don’t know if it was looked at or not.”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed. “What rumors?”
Sherlock stared at John for a long beat and then took a single step forward. “Stay tonight. Please just… sleep here. With me.”
“What?” John inhaled again, deeply.
Sherlock’s chuckle rumbles through John’s bones. “I had to add an entire wing, constructing it was a monstrosity. Moving all of those ideas in there…”
John barks a laugh up towards the sky. “Well,” he says, looking back to Mike with a wide smile curving his lips. “At least it’s quiet?”
“They’re ready for you in exam room B,” she muttered and then walked away, both Sherlock and Greg watching as she went.
His feet bounced against the floor and he began tapping his phone case against his lips. Sherlock couldn’t just sit in his room and wallow; he could try to speak with the other skiers, somehow wrangle out of them any information they had. But they were surrounded by their teams, and he didn’t speak with any of them to begin with; that would be suspicious. He groaned and pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes, conceding that getting out of his room would at least be good for the cabin fever that was encroaching.
John’s not sure what it is, what it could possibly be, but, as he climbs the steps, he registers a heady floral note in the air. It’s not overwhelming, but it’s stark enough to notice a difference.
“How kind,” Sherlock breathes, humor sweet on the crests of his syllables. “But not tonight.”
: How large is the lceration?
, Sherlock,” John says and then presses in, centimeter by centimeter, eyes glued to Sherlock’s face, watching, caring.
It feels decidedly romantic, thinking about this anonymous person
“I wish we hadn’t John. Waited. But then. What would we have been- if that first evening, if at Angelo’s, I’d… taken you up on it. What would we have been?”
Sherlock considered, “After we eat, though we’ll have to do it quickly.”
The cursor blinks at him.
The one person he what?
, came the first warning.
Sherlock sends it, cringing down at his mobile even as he taps at the button. He’s given more of himself away in the email than he feels he ever has to anyone. It is—in turns—terrifying and gratifying, as though he can finally breathe deeply after years or taking mere sips of air.
“Brilliant!” Greg said and disappeared to the bar.
.” And despite the obviously come on, the rather salacious nature of it, Sherlock finds himself laughing.
The cacophony around him faded to white noise after a time and he got through the rest of the book and began surreptitiously sizing people up from behind the veil of his Ray-Bans. He was surrounded by athletes from Great Britain, Brazil, Macedonia, and Hungary; in the immediate surrounding area he found three alcoholics, two people with opiate addictions, one gambler, one overt sadist and seven adulterers. Overcome with boredom, Sherlock wondered if the latter number was high amongst his sample size and then realized that he didn’t much care about that at all. Allowing his head to loll back against the cool stone, he kicked one foot against the cement flooring, feeling the last of his patience begin to thrum tenuously.
And yet this entire situation was one of his own doing.
Sherlock had only just set the tricep machine at it’s proper resistance when his attention was stolen away. He saw him from across the room, could place him just from the back of his head; for a moment, Sherlock admired the way his hair grew to a little point on the nape of his neck, before tearing his eyes away. He was in the middle of a workout, damn it. He needed to
John’s movements were shallow and when he brought his mouth to Sherlock’s the angle was slightly off, making it a bit awkward. So too were Sherlock’s attempts to wrap a hand around John’s weeping prick, but they made it work, huffing out breathy laughter when their noses would knock, groaning when John tilted his pelvis just so and managed to sink down all the way.
John falls back against the bed with an “Oof!” when Sherlock gives him a little shove, and then Sherlock is advancing on him, scooting up the bed. John shifts back up the bed and is immediately blanketed. One large hand spreads across John’s right pec, and Sherlock makes no move, just stares down at John in something that John would consider unabashed awe if this wasn’t Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock stands, blinks at the wall, then at the window and then down at his dog who makes the dog equivalent of a shrug and then returns to nosing a his toy. Sherlock rereads John’s words twice more, finally coming to the very strange conclusion that his not understanding the situation, not understand
LONDON, England - Sherlock Holmes is not what one would call a homebody, though he’s often to be found at home. Sitting on a posh leather sofa and surrounded by precarious-looking chemistry equipment, he cuts a striking figure more likely to be seen on the catwalk than on the slopes.
Sherlock’s gaze followed John’s tongue as it peeked out to wet his lips. “So you’re not most people then?”
“Sorry,” John chuckles, raising his chin in greeting to someone across the room. “Best keep myself in line, yeah?”
Sherlock slashes in, “But. He’s not here.”
“He! Oh, well, John, I-”
Sherlock’s chin falls forward and he fights to swallow as the roaring in his ears becomes nearly deafening.
“Yeah, guess I do.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together tightly, wondering suddenly if this is where it would all go off of the rails for them. He’d been nothing but himself with John and it was rather surprising and confusing that John had put up with him for so long. It was a long, pregnant silence before Sherlock nodded his head once briskly, affirming his previous statement, and waited for John to decide if Sherlock liking him was a good thing or otherwise.
Turning onto his side, Sherlock levers himself up, resting his cheek on his palm. His upper hand reaches out and smooths over John’s prick where it rests against his belly. “Can we get it together, hmm?” Sherlock hums, and begins jerking John lazily.
. “And you’re drunk.”
“Greg plays for a club rugby team, might go and see a bout.”
Sherlock proceeded quietly. “All of the evidence he’s left, all of it… points to you.”
it reads.
Sherlock blinked, went back, and opened the next article. It was small, but it was there; a tiny little thread, linking dead skiers to Jim Moriarty.
“If you wanted to have a look at the course with me on Sunday I would be… amenable.”
She grinned, crossing her arms over her chest, and took a step back. “Right, go get ‘em, boss.”
“Most people are.” Sherlock’s gaze hold his and for a moment they’re in impasse, but then John laughs, tips his head back and barks out a single, incredulous guffaw. Sherlock doesn’t react, just tilts his head and watches.
“Might we get to hospital now? As you can see my colleague here is having quite some trouble keeping awake!” Olympic Village doctors had seen to the both of them, but it was still recommended that they get transported to the Village Hospital.
he thinks to himself and concedes the point, his face twisting in a half-grimace. His gaze is drawn back to his dog, who is now resting on his belly in the grass, nose to nose with a sparrow, either of them eyeing the other suspiciously.
“Hey, it’s alright. It’s, yeah, I feel… yeah.” John twists, rests down on his side, abreast of Sherlock. “Glad we finally. Yeah.”
John rockets himself off of the bench and strides forward on the pavement, in the direction of his flat; his fists pump back and forth at his sides. He simultaneously can’t believe he asked such a question and realizes that the question is entirely innocuous. He can’t help wanting to flesh out Guest a bit more in his imagination.
The woman interrupted him, pulling the microphone back to her lips; it picked at him, irritation flaring a bit. “It’s been said, or you’ve said in the past that you commit the course to memory, is that something that most skiers do?”
“Yes.”
“Shut. Up,” Sherlock said back, twisting to hiss it over his shoulder.
“No, stop,” Sherlock said, clipped. “Shut up, shut up.”
Sherlock took the opportunity to stretch lethargically, squirming in John’s arms, the sheet slipping low on his hips. “Mmm, alright.”
John sighed and pressed his fingertips to the corners of his closed eyes. “He might be an idiot but he’s
After settling on one button, Sherlock tidied the sitting room of his suite and then puttered around, his excess energy making it impossible for him to sit down. It was nearing eight and Sherlock took the opportunity to take one last look at himself in the mirror. He looked… good, if he did say so himself. His skin shone in contrast to his hair and the dark clothing he wore; he just hoped John would agree.
“A simple matter of observation, Doctor Watson.”
“I said shut up,” Sherlock very nearly shouted and John finally heeded his demand and they fell into silence.
thinking at all of John Watson.
and life affirming.
He wanted to prove with his hands and lips and tongue and cock how positively extraordinary he found John Watson. It was a strange feeling, though not unwelcome, wanting to be so close and intimate with someone whom he’d really only just met. But something in his core, something deep down in his gut evened out and settled at the thought of having John in his bed.
There, that should make matters quite plain. Sherlock doesn’t want to get any further into this.
Mike breaks into a bashful grin. “Yeah I thought, well John is recently back from abroad and is looking for something in the city.”
John just blinks at him, keeps on eating.
“I’m quite glad you weren’t put off by my behavior on the plane, when we first met.”
“We weren’t ready, we weren’t…no, we weren’t ready.” John sighs, turning his head a bit this way, a bit that, feels Sherlock respond, skin to skin. It’s quiet, it’s warm, it’s lovely and all a bit strange, just being this close, this together, in this flat. John savors it, pulls the scent of Sherlock deep into his lungs and doesn’t let go until he feels he might burst.
He’d expected a young athlete based on the light, unassuming tone, perhaps one of the jumpers that was new on the circuit, but instead Sherlock was met with the weathered face of a man perhaps a few years older than himself. He was short of stature and plain but pleasant looking, smoothing his own blanket across his lap before turning to meet Sherlock’s gaze. He blinked at Sherlock, obviously making his own assumptions before he offered his hand out. “John Watson.”
Their kissing slows, mouths meeting the edge of jaws, collarbones, cheeks. There’s a little laugh from Sherlock when John dips to nose along behind his ear before licking the lobe into his mouth.
“A waste of time,” Sherlock repeats.
Sherlock shook his head against the carpet. “No, I--no. For what?”
John pulls up short, hands pausing in adjustment of his lapel. “Oh, uh, hello.”
They fell into a companionable silence, the only sound the hiss and crackle of the fire in the hearth. Content for awhile to simply enjoy being close to one another, Sherlock slipped further over on the couch, his thigh pressing into John’s, and after only a moment’s hesitation, he draped his arm along the back, tucking John into his side.
about himself. And he
John eyes him with suspicion, takes another sip and lifts his face in an attempt at a smile. “Right. Ta, then.” With that, he sets his folder down, takes a seat on one of the stools, and effectively ignores the fact that Sherlock is in the room.
? You always know so-”
himself. Hates that John hadn’t been excited to see him. God, he’d been waiting for Guest and all he got was…
Sherlock’s pupils blew wide at the thought of John on top of him, around him, and he complied quickly which resulted in him maneuvering a bit awkwardly in long limbs. He tossed two pillows against the headboard and leaned back against them, splaying his thighs wide as his hand went to his cock again.
The intercom blared to life interrupting the tense silence that had fallen between them, announcing a temporary halt to the Group A run. “He’s out for you,” John murmured, allowing his hand to wrap around Sherlock’s elbow.
“You don’t usually go out to lunch, usually bring your own food from home, saves money. But you want to go to lunch today…” Sherlock’s eyes narrow.
“You want that,” John says, rather than asks. “Truly.”
John frowned but did as asked until Sherlock began babbling to himself, fingers to his temples and pressing in. “There has to be something,
,” he says, as though he and the dog have been having a conversation all the while. Sherlock screws his mouth into a thoughtful twist, lets Redbeard’s lead out a bit longer. “And then he takes my mobile number…assumes that he’ll…”
Once nude, Sherlock got into the bed, immediately draping himself over John’s body. John tipped his chin up, waiting, but Sherlock was content to look his fill, gaze skating up and down John’s torso leisurely. “You want my mouth?”
“Case?” he asks, only momentarily struck by the high color in Sherlock’s cheeks, the flakes that are melting in his hair, catching the light from the lamps. He looks like he’s got fairy lights in his hair and it’s quite…something.
, how did you
Sherlock sighs heavily through his nose, finally reaching across–John’s eyes carefully watching the movement–to cup John’s right knee with his palm. It’s the most forward, tactile act Sherlock has made since John’s breakdown in this very room. It’s causes a tsunami to well up within John, make him feel as though his body needs to crash into Sherlock’s, throw the together, meld them. “You speak as though any of that is unappealing. There’s little I don’t know about you John, and nothing I wouldn’t accept as simply a part of the man you are. I, on the other hand…” Sherlock folds his hands in his lap, oddly prim and proper.
. John feels the “yes” on his tongue but holds back.
“A bit,” the man conceded, but then grinned and clapped a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder. “But it’s brilliant. Congrats, mate. I’m going to grab the tram back down so I’ll… I’ll see you at the finish.”
“I can’t-”
: well with nothing else to go on I’d asay that the victim would have bled out in less than ten mintues..
Ski poles at his side, he dipped his body into a starting crouch. There was pressure at his temples, underneath his tongue, as though he should put voice to words he didn’t have. Sherlock had a startling thought in that moment, that he should remember what he was thinking as he was going down the slope. That someone was going to ask him what he’d been thinking just before the race. But he was thinking of nothing and
“Wait,
and the second
“How did you-”
meet someone! Like a, a date!”
“Right, right,” Lestrade passed a hand over his mouth. “Okay, well, let’s just try not to think about that now, wait until you’ve… until you’ve…” Lestrade caught Sherlock’s gaze briefly. “Really? With John?”
When he returns to the living room, Sherlock’s back is against the sofa where John had just been, one knee bent, as he flicks through photos taken at crime scenes over the years. “I must have wasted so much ink, printing these... “
They finish the bottle of wine, Sherlock pays the tab, and they exit the restaurant together into a chilly evening. The bed and breakfast is a bit of an amble away, and John feels anticipation in every step he takes.
It’s an easy trip from that realization to imagining long Sundays warm in bed with Rosie situated between them, dinners out that are fraught with tension and end in tender lovemaking, days spent marinating in the knowledge of their shared feelings, doing nothing at all in particular.
“No point,” Greg’s headed lolled back and forth against the wall; he peeled his eyes open. “You knew he was going to confess, you said as much. There’ve been no decisions made, but Moran’s going to confirm your story. Bit anticlimactic after that. Moriarty has been sanctioned by the IOC and won’t compete, there’ll be a trial, but all that’ll take ages.” Greg shrugged again, “Sorry, feeling a bit loopy from the meds they gave me, brilliant things. But, yes, nothing to worry about now, but… but skiing the final, yeah?”
Sherlock clears his throat and makes his observations. “You got in early today. Only time for a banana before things got busy,” he surmises, voice a bit far away, his eyes lingering on John’s shoulder.
By the time he makes it down to sub basement B, it’s nearing noon. Still, he’s unprepared for John Watson pushing his way through the door, shrugging on his coat.
Sherlock’s mouth curves up. “We solved it, and it’s Lagavulin.  It’s in the cupboard above the stove.” Sherlock shakes his head, “How do you forget a name like Maximillian Aurenthal Zephyr?”
He bobbled once, then again, and for a terrifying moment he thought he was going to crash out; he righted his left ski and pressed down hard, coming out of the final turn flying, but shaky, launching over the final jump and bursting across the finish line with a whoosh of released breath. Slamming his skis sidewards Sherlock slowed and swiveled around, coming to a stop facing the course.
“Jumper, you said?” he demands as he pushes through the door; to Molly’s credit, she doesn’t jump, but rounds on him slowly.
“That’s remarkably saccharine,” Sherlock mumbles to the top of John’s head.
Bottom lip between his teeth, John considered, keeping Sherlock on tenterhooks. “Fine, but on a few conditions,” he gave in, his face serious.
He turns the taps to his desired temperature and just watches the tub fill for a bit. When it’s mid calf, John tosses in the white ball and is shocked to see it start fizzing wildly. The scents release, invigorating and fresh; he’ll have to remember to thank Molly.
he pecks out, feeling foolish that he doesn’t have another designator for this person.
“And? And!?”
from John.
The announcement came first in Russian and then, “Ladies and gentleman, the bronze medallist, Bode Miller of the United States of America!” The crowd went wild and Miller ducked to accept the medal around his neck, punching the air when he straightened.
“I’m just… so happy!” Molly hiccoughed and Greg smoothed her hair back, settling her in the booth.
An unreal time on this course, he knew it.
Sherlock did want to, very much, but the obvious reasons he shouldn’t were remembered immediately. Not just the fact that Sherlock had made a promise to himself to try to
Sherlock set his mouth in a firm line; perhaps he shouldn’t have said a thing. He was so spectacularly
“Will you? They know that you were with me. There’s only so much dodging of rumors one is able to do before someone-”
He wanted John to be involved in
“Never,” Sherlock agreed.
“I, erm, here,” she shoved them towards him whilst biting her lip and Sherlock took them, frown turning even deeper.
“It’ll be fine; go to sleep.”
Sherlock isn't certain he’ll sleep, so he doesn't hesitate in brewing a strong cup of tea and reclining on the sofa, handle steepled beneath his chin; the dog settles on the floor beside him, gnawing contentedly on a large notch of bone. Sherlock is only supine for a few short minutes before he’s whirling back into his coat and heading out. It’s two in the morning by the time he returns back at Baker Street, pink suitcase in hand and a feeling of brazen accomplishment expanding in his chest. He could easily ride this high into the morning, stay up the rest of the night until the sun comes up, puzzling the case, but he knows that the dog will stay up with him and doesn't want to tire Redbeard out. Now that he’s getting older and isn't as spry as he used to be, the dog truly needs his rest. So, with a last glossing over of the details, he locks up his mind palace and sets about getting ready for bed.
“Student, employee, what’s the difference. You get paid now, I suppose, but it’s the same hoops you have to jump through.”
trick is quite… impressive.”
“Fine,” Molly scoffs, rounds the gurney and heads towards her office. “High praise coming from you!” she calls from inside, shucking her lab coat in order to pull on a fluffy cardigan.
His dressing gown flutters out angrily behind him as he stands from his laptop and spins. He has to get out, has to move, be free, break from the tethers that are binding him to this preposterous situation that… should be beneath him but…
Not for his
Sherlock faces back around, his gaze directed to the recently re-tiled fireplace. “Right?”
“Me,” Sherlock wheezes, tries for a laugh.
“And then he hit the snowbank and bloody well flew right into the river!” Greg sold the punchline by doubling over with laughter, his whole body shaking with it. Molly swung with him, her own sweet giggles pressed into his shoulder. John chuckled heartily, stumbling over a cobblestone as they made their way out onto the main thoroughfare; Sherlock found himself reaching out a hand and grabbing John’s bicep to stop him from falling.
Twenty days, that’s all that stands between him and the moment he reveals himself to John. Twenty days until he reveals himself to be Guest. Twenty days until this all changes, possibly, until it all disintegrates.
There’s a close-up of the body taken at the scene--none from the lab, and he can only assume the autopsy has yet to be done. Sherlock’s head twists as he gets closer to the glossy photograph, his magnifier hovering over the very-messy-indeed abdominal cavity. And there, amongst the guts and the gore, looks to be the tell tale signs of surgical staples. They’re covered in blood, and could absolutely be mistaken for discolored skin and the wound mistaken for a crudely performed murder.
Again, the dog doesn’t respond and Sherlock feels guilty that he doesn’t want to get up and take him out, but not guilty enough to actually follow through on that. He shoots off a quick text to his landlady Mrs. Hudson, hoping that she’ll take the dog to the shops with her; when she responds that she’d be happy to, Sherlock informs Redbeard of the good news.
“You’re telling me you can’t deduce it?”
Moran struck out again but Sherlock jerked hard, tilting his chair and toppling over hard onto his left bicep, avoiding the blow. It took the wind out of him, the impact jangling hard through his frame, his head bouncing off of the floor with a thud that rang around behind his eyes.
“Jesus,” John almost chokes on his own tongue. He holds the publication up in front of his face, and finds himself bursting into surprised laughter. “Oh my god, why on earth did you keep this?” He holds out the paper for Sherlock to see.
not to see it.” Sherlock ponders for a moment. “Or really just a normal human, you’d have to be a normal, common idiot not to see it.”
Sherlock bites his lip, tries,
“Like… an invalid.”
Sherlock Holmes. There’s just no time.
While the tub was filling he stripped and collected two large bottles of water from the minifridge, intending to get a jump on his hydration while relaxing. He didn’t have any oil or bubble bath so he poured a bit of his expensive shampoo beneath the running water and watched as it foamed up pleasantly. Snatching up his mobile from the bedroom, he stripped down and climbed into the pleasantly scalding water.
for it.
“What?”
“Come with me,” John says simply, slowly, like he knows Sherlock isn’t going to get it. To John’s credit, Sherlock really isn’t understanding it at all. “To lunch.”
The set is alive with activity, makeup artists dusting powder across cheeks and noses, grips checking lighting and a producer going over segment notes with the interviewer. The athletes are left to wait in the small green room until called to set.
The lift dinged for his floor and he heaved in a large sigh, resolving to deal with the intricacies of the John situation at a later time. Sherlock stepped off and made it to his room to discover that Lestrade had already gotten inside.
Or does any of it matter at all, because Sherlock is rather certain that this, this hopeless miasma of sickening, breath-taking emotion must be what people mean when they describe falling in love.
“Alright, you arse, what I’m saying is if they catch you with anyone else’s equipment you’re going to be tossed. And it’s your last Olympics. Is that something you’re willing to risk?”
Sherlock was shocked to find himself in a better than average mood, so much so that he wasn’t even a complete arse to Molly when she arrived and spilled some of her mojito on him.
Alone: it generally protects him, but now he feels unsettled and raw and just
They fall into a surprisingly companionable silence, just finishing off the bowl before their entrees arrive. Sherlock adds so much wasabi to his soy sauce that John comments on it and Sherlock sends him a scathing glare and a “Can’t stand the heat?” before plucking up a tempura eel roll and bringing it quickly to his mouth.
There’s comfortable silence, during which John picks up an olive and pops it into his mouth. When he’s finished chewing, he clears his throat and swirls the wine in his glass. “Do you see things about me?” John asks, his eyes bright and questioning.
“Could do with a hello,” she grumbles, and it’s so uncharacteristic of her that it gives Sherlock pause.
“Your favorite,” John suggests.
With that, he leaves Baker Street and hails a cab, eager to get to Soho, and realizes belatedly that he likely should have let John know that he’s acquaintances with the proprietor of the establishment.
With a mind swirling full of data, he set off in search of one of the many available cafeterias.
I can say to make you reconsider that, you utter madman?” John sounded reproachful, though he was smiling fondly.
Of course it had to be John Watson. It wasn’t a leap that Molly had made, as he’d been the only single person in the cafe at the time. But Sherlock hadn’t believed it until he saw John with his own eyes.
It’s gone half nine by the time he makes it down to the morgue, using a confiscated badge to gain entry to the room. Sherlock pushes through the door with his shoulder and is immediately assaulted by the pleasing sound of a bone saw doing its job.
Sherlock smiles placidly back, taking a dainty sip of his coffee. “Odd running into you here.”
They find nothing, as Sherlock was sure of, and they leave Scotland Yard a few minutes before noon. John doesn’t seem put out by the lack of new evidence, but then, it’s all part of the bigger puzzle, and that’s what has John fascinated, to be sure.
“What? I never lied.”
The response is almost immediate, and John finds himself wishing--for some reason--that he could chat with Guest, over an instant messaging program.
There’s a tic in Sherlock’s cheek, and then he’s smiling in such a bashful manner, it immediately renders in John the desire to gather him close and cuddle him up. Sherlock states plainly, as though he’s both caught in wonder and quite proud of himself, “Me.”
“You still can,” Sherlock adds, a teasing little smile touching the corner of his mouth.
Stepping back in, John leans the bottles carefully on the little ledge and takes Sherlock’s hips in his hands. “Alright?”
“Oi, who handled all that scheduling, you arse? You’re definitely buying tonight!” Greg flicked his sunglasses up off of his eyes, as the sun was fading.
“Oh?”
“Oh,” John said, clearing his throat primly. “And erm, just out of curiosity, how will you introduce me?”
His phone pings, just as he’s about to rest it on his bedside table for the evening.
There’s an audible swallow, not scotch, just Sherlock preparing. John is glad for the noise, for the intent of it, because it gives him a moment to prepare for whatever Sherlock is about to say. “Just, he was ABD, and was going back to finish up his PhD. He frequented the only club that I could get… well. He was there. I was there. We met.”
Sherlock takes a breath, forges on. “He was…trying to date me, or save me,” his lip catches between his teeth in a strange display of self-deprecation. “Both, come to think of it. I haven’t thought about him in…” Sherlock blinks, seemingly startled out of the memory he’d been wading into. “Sentiment.”
“Whatever you’re going to say… think on it and we’ll talk after we find out if I have internal bleeding, yeah?” It was a joke--a terrible one, but a joke still--and John cracked a smile at him.
“Why?”
Interesting.
race, his entire life. Now that it was upon him, it seemed almost impossible.
“Of course not,” John says, know he shouldn’t take the bait, but he’s so emotionally raw and quite upset and he wants to make Sherlock hurt. It’s vindictive, it’s cruel and childish, but he wants to get a rise out of the stoic machine Sherlock Holmes. “Because the man I’m meeting is nothing like you. He’s clever, and funny, he’s got a cracking sense of humor-”
, and it was slightly disconcerting, but the flow pulled him and he went with it, too carefree to give very much of a toss.
“I found solace in my routine,” Sherlock says. “Waxing, working with my techs. At the top of the slope, it’s easier to feel alone, and when I’m alone, I’m in my element.”
“I know,” Sherlock says, popping the cork. “Now, how do we do this? I’ve never bathed with someone before.”
Sherlock’s breath caught and his mouth parched; his heart racing out of control. He would swear that John could hear it from where he stood. “When all this is over, what?” Sherlock asked, voice still sleep-rough.
“Kill you? Oh no, I’d no intention of killing you, you weren’t important enough for that. No, I just wanted to  get you out of the way. Fractured femur would have been just fine with me!” Moriarty shrugged, hands in pockets and he rocked up onto the balls of his feet. “But you’ve been sticking that aristocratic nose where it doesn’t belong. You and your pet here and frankly… I’m over it.”
“Well,” she says, finally just putting the files down on the edge of a metal counter, “it wouldn’t be so bad if I had an assistant, but they all keep--oh wait, oh! Mike!”
“Outside of testing the chemical makeup, I suppose we start by showing it to Phillip and Molly, see if they can place it or find out if any other athletes are using it. See if they can get us samples of the waxes everyone else is using, or at least the brand. I can compare it with samples that I've collected over the years.” Ski techs had been known to sample the waxes of other athletes, though usually not at the Olympic level. Sherlock knew Molly was quite familiar with many of the other competitors’ tech teams; she could attempt to covertly determine what others were using.
“You like the danger,” Sherlock said, voice low and velvety, breath ghosting over the crest of John’s ear.
“Yes, well… friends think those things about their… friends,” she finished lamely.
Lips press, open and hot, against the back of his neck. “Love you,” John says, the words gusting over Sherlock’s skin in little puffs. “Fuck, love you so much.”
John cleared his throat and spoke quickly, “What Greg said, you don’t have… friends.”
Sherlock chuckles silently and writes another line of text. “Who you were with? You didn’t realize who you were with?”
He was the first to divert, licking his way across John’s stubbly jaw until his mouth was pressed at John’s neck; wet, open-mouthed kisses slipped up John’s skin until Sherlock’s lips teased behind his right ear, Sherlock noting the immediate and strong reaction it caused. John’s hips rolled up immediately, hardness flush with Sherlock’s as he groaned deeply in something like pleasure-pain.
The way Sherlock lights up, his whole body opening to accept John in his arms, is perhaps one of the very best things John has ever seen. “Take a bath with me.”
On the way in he treats himself to a medium latte and a scone and finds a bench a few blocks away from the hospital. He’s just laid out his breakfast treat when someone else comes and sits down next to him; it’s a rather large bench and so the proximity isn’t an issue but John looks over anyway, assesses the stranger. He’s tall, with artfully coiffed dark hair; he’s wearing a heavy-looking woolen coat although it’s spring and he’s so intensely focused on his mobile that John wonders if he even noticed someone sitting on the bench beside him.
The kiss slowed and petered out naturally, John peppering three kisses to Sherlock’s chin before leaning back and opening his eyes. Sherlock gazed down at him, pupils blown wide with arousal, and smiled.
, his conscious mind shouted at him and he narrowed his eyes, determining how much time he hand before he would reach the Bear’s Brow jump; the course prior to that point was where he knew he could pick up the most time.
They were left gazing at each other in the center of the sitting room, John smiling easily and Sherlock’s heart knocking about so viciously in his chest that he was certain it could be heard beating against his ribs. Sherlock was aware that he ought to say something, that as the seconds ticked by, the moment became more intimate and Sherlock was fast blanking on how to proceed.
“Not romantic,” John grumbles and takes a step into Sherlock’s personal space, chest to chest. “You know how I like to be... “ John takes a large inhale through his nose and then presses his mouth to Sherlock’s shoulder. “Romantic.”
Sherlock then delved for Hanzu’s times, wondering if he was somehow likely to podium, or to threaten Moriarty’s (and therefore his own) likelihood of medalling. There was nothing to suggest that the young man would even fall in the top of the B level competitors; that avenue of investigation was a dead end, then.
the help, mind, but… well, you’re an army doctor.”
It was shoved into her hand and she took it without thanks, firmly in the zone. She took the iron to the wax and set the base layer, scraping it off when she was happy with the coverage, taking with it any impurities and dirt that had been on the surface. By the time she was through there was a sheen of sweat on her brow and Sherlock watched on, nearly transfixed by her fluidity.
“Fine, yes, good.”
John’s tongue touches his upper lip for a moment and he’s completely still, taking a breath, allowing himself a moment to acknowledge that all of this will firmly be in the “before Sherlock and I made love” portion of his life. He watches Sherlock–-pink cheeked and adorably ruffled—watch him.
In an attempt to distract himself, Sherlock turns his attention out the window of the cab, but that too makes him think of John. There are couples on the pavement, waiting for the light to change. Three pairs, two holding hands, one laughing together.
“Oh Mike!” Molly says in delight, balancing a stack of files precariously in the crook of her arm as she exits the office. “Hi!”
Sherlock pursed his lips. “What difference does it make?”
Sherlock grinned, twisting his wrist as he settled his lips and nose against the side of John’s neck, working out what made John respond most forcefully. As it turned out, Sherlock found he was quite good at making John sigh and moan and grinned into the flesh at John’s sternum as he hid his face there and teased John’s fraenulum with his fingertips.
John’s eyes blinked closed and all of the hesitation drained from his bones. “Let me just go get my things and then we can order in some room service.”
“Would you like to come on another case with me?” Sherlock interrupts, and rather loudly too—several of the tables surrounding them turn to glance over.
Sherlock called his agent, Molly, and his parents in that order, making sure all of his bases were covered and leaving his agent and Molly to distribute the information about his condition to those that needed to know. Then he settled on his bed and dialed John.
“Not taking me to bed, then?” John laughed languidly, eyes slipping shut as he allowed Sherlock’s arms to wind around his back in a hug.
John bit his lip and turned to look out the window, then shifted to glance across the expanse of restaurant before finally turning his eyes back on Sherlock. “Kind of hard not to. You look like a dream out there.”
“Oi, none of that flirting,” Greg said and snatched his phone away, pocketing it. Sherlock let him take it, and leaned his head against the cool glass of the window, grinning.
It takes Sherlock a brief second to tear his attention away from the scene outside of the cab. John, as always, proves to be much more intuitive than anyone would imagine. Of course they won’t, they’ll find nothing, but that’s not the point. “Due diligence.”
By the time he makes it back to his bedsit it is dusk, and he’s contemplating whether or not he wants to bother eating dinner. He’s not hungry, hasn’t felt hungry in ages; he just feels tired, as though he’s living years within the space of a day. It’s another telltale sign of his depression, and he wonders how long he can possibly live while feeling like this. The sensation of being aloof and leaden at the same time confuses him, and he rests for a moment with his head hanging.
Sherlock opened a search page and slowly, reservedly, typed in ‘skiing deaths, past ten years.’ He’d heard of a few over the course of his career. Novice skiers thinking they could outsmart nature, taking turns too quickly, demoing skis that were wrong for the terrain. Speed demons, many of them, getting high from the rush, allowing the rush to kill them.
“They’re… they’re fucking sexy. They
“Oh yes,” John said, laughed and poured Sherlock a drink. “But back to the… whatever it is.” John grinned and sat up straighter in the booth and Sherlock felt a wave of relief. “All
have been you, if there’s--”
As a scientist, the losses baffled him; if he accurately calculated all of the available data, why wasn’t he making a
The pillow beneath John’s hips went flying off of the bed as he tossed it and turned, shimmying up onto his knees facing Sherlock. He leaned in, capturing Sherlock’s mouth with his own in a breathless, heated kiss. Their knees knocked and John’s hand flicked at Sherlock’s, batting it away in order to grip Sherlock’s cock. His fingers curled and slid, tickling along the underside before he ran his palm over the wetness at the tip, spreading it about. “On your back, wanna see you.”
now?”
Sherlock barked out a laugh and continue to stare at John, whose eyes were slowly fluttering closed. He looked entirely, completely
Sherlock’s eyes are on John as he very carefully pours out an adequate amount of lubricant and slicks himself up; John gives a few torturous tugs, just for the show of it and then walks on his knees between the vee of Sherlock’s legs. Just the head of his prick, dragging against Sherlock’s hole, just the head of it, back and forth, back and forth.
It’s John’s turn to use his elbows as support. He knows how his voice will sound before he even opens his mouth, “Sherlock.” Filled with awe, slightly choked, John can think of nothing else to say.
“Anyway,” John says, about to turn the conversation to safer topics, when the waitress comes with the edamame. “Feel free,” John says, gesturing at the bowl and then pops a pod into his mouth, sucking out the soybeans inside. He watches as Sherlock reaches forth and does the same, plump lips wrapping around a-
Sherlock finishes and taps his thumb over the “send” button without the slightest hesitation.
The group paused, just off to the center of the room as Moriarty glanced stoically around, and then out of nowhere broke into a grin and threw up his hands. “Well, don’t all go welcoming me at once.”
One-tenth of a second.
Snuggling down into his plush bedding he pouts into his duvet and closes his eyes.
John stood in front of him in a checked shirt and dark jeans, hair artfully tousled. He looked… delightful. Sherlock smile at him. “Good evening.”
,” he observed snidely, finally feeling back on even footing. “How positively barbaric, though appropriate as far as you’re concerned, I suppose, what with your military past.”
“Gonna come for me?” John growls and Sherlock finds he’s so tightly wound he can’t speak, very nearly can’t breathe. “Gonna come all over yourself for me?”
“Happy. Giddy, or something. Christ, haven’t got a
Their joined digits swing along between them, before Sherlock relaxes and leaves John’s hand to flutter happily back to his side.
Lestrade simply quirks a brow and inclines his head towards the stack in front of him. “Information on every suicide we’ve record of, over the past five years.”
“I beg to differ,” Sherlock says and steps away from John, smiling a bit bashfully. “Go.”
Sherlock exhaled harshly through his nose and settled the weights on the rack, fingers still curled around the handles. John turned and began walking away and Sherlock couldn’t stomach it, couldn’t
Sherlock’s face scrunched up and he bent woodenly, picked their clothes up from the floor and tossed them through the door towards the living area. “Sounds horrid.”
John’s good mood evaporates instantly upon spying a tall figure perched on a stool over a body. Molly is nowhere to be seen and so John tosses down his shoulder bag with a loud clang.
Moran did as bid, tipping John’s chair back and dragging him over to the center of the room where Sherlock was. Moriarty gave the rolling chair a little shove and sent Sherlock into John’s side, their biceps cushioning the blow against one another.
“Why would Molly give you something for me?”
Moriarty took a step towards Sherlock and bent down, at eye level with him. “No, no no no. Not just to win; the money of course has
John paused, turned and stood, a few scant feet between them; he said nothing, just gazed at Sherlock expectantly.
He perused the information carefully, jumping from site to site, lead to lead until he stumbled across something that made him pause and reread. Hanzu’s coach trained his athletes out of the same city as Moriarty; the odds were great that - as elite level skiers - they practiced on the same mountains as well. Sherlock himself happened to train alongside many elite athletes himself, no matter how hard he tried to avoid such situations.
“I’m not,” John says, blushing, “because you’re not sleeping.”
When Sherlock finally spoke, his voice was emphatic., “Nothing like the old days.”
is, to worry about hurting someone else. He doesn’t want to lie to him, either. He wants, truly, to go back and do it all over again, enter the coffee shop and sit down and just… just watch John’s reaction.
A little clamor of something stirred in Sherlock’s gut and he aimed for nonchalant when he asked, “You were watching me?”
John shrugs mentally and as he breaks off a piece of the scone, the man at his left scoffs, presumably at something he’s read. John doesn’t engage but does glance over using his peripheral vision and sees the man frowning, staring out at the traffic. He feels distinctly awkward and takes a sip of his coffee, willing the man silently to move along.
“But you had a good time.”
“Oh god,” his eyes screw up tightly, and he doesn’t know how to tell Sherlock everything that he feels in the moment, how completely large and beyond his body he is.
Sherlock smiles.
“Okay,” John gasped brokenly, turning his head as far as he was able, straining to see Sherlock. “Enough, I’m going to, god, enough, inside me,
“Love to,” Sherlock responded, his fingers passing over his pocket where the wax was sandwiched between his identification card and Barclaycard. He’d find out soon enough what exactly Moriarty was up to.
“I suppose,” he returned and stepped into the room, quietly shutting the door behind him. Sherlock toed off his shoes easily during the four steps it took to reach John. Once they were face to face Sherlock dipped pressing his lips beneath John’s left eye, fluttering a kiss there as his hands once more found the curve of John’s hips and held.
Sherlock nods his head once more in thanks and spins on his heels, his coat flaring in what John believes is a purposefully showy manner. God, what an entitled, abrasive prick. Between knowing exactly the effect he has on women and using it to his advantage (because it cannot possibly be just Molly who is infatuated with tall, dark, handsome, and mean), and his inability to
had worked in his favor.
He scissored his skis back and forth on the hard-packed snow, warming up his calves and thighs. It was bizarre, how completely numb he suddenly felt when just a moment before he’d had dozens of emotions warring within his chest; now he wasn’t nervous, wasn’t excited, wasn’t sad to be ending his professional skiing tenure. Sherlock had been preparing for this race,
“Like he’s a private detective?” John asks.
This feels... far too personal; it

: We’re both in London. :P
better. His official time of two minutes, 6.09 seconds startled him, however; to his knowledge, it was the fastest time that anyone had clocked on the training runs thus far.
“It’s going to be fine.”
They were both slick with sweat, desperate for release, and when John leaned forward and bit Sherlock’s ear, Sherlock’s couldn’t help but buck up and meet him, thrust for thrust. The sound of skin slapping against skin was loud and lewd in the relative quiet of the room and it only served to ramp up Sherlock’s arousal. God, this was brilliant, it was fantastic, it was
Now, they’re in the position of requesting a booking on-site, which John knows from the get-go won’t work in their favor when attempting to book two rooms. The sheer number of people that had been on hand when they arrived made the inn, which had been described on the chamber of commerce website as “a relaxing sojourn far from your troubles”, seem into something more like a carnival.
Sherlock watches his cursor flicker and disappear in the reply box a few times before he takes another breath. The bones of his fingers very nearly vibrate as he types his response.
It’s such a line, and John relaxes from the absurdity of it coming from Sherlock’s mouth, realizing belatedly that he’d been a touch nervous.
“‘Course,” John says seriously, holding Sherlock’s jaw in his palm. “Of course.” Their gazes hold and something quite tangible, thick and warm blankets over them. They’re the only two people in the galaxy, they really are. John smiles, Sherlock smiles back, larger.
“John?” his voice is so soft, as though the shadows are carrying it.
“It’s a cottage. A small, quaint, quiet cottage.”
John blots his mouth as he says, “Not nothing.” He takes a breath, places his napkin back in his lap and rests his hands on the table, as though preparing for battle. “You miss the competition.”
“Precisely.”
“Two twenty-one Baker Street,” John gave the address to the cabbie and grinned over at Sherlock, twining their fingers together on the bench seat of the taxi as they settled in. “Thank you,” John whispered across the short distance. “It’s been ages since I’ve had a proper date, been wined and dined like that.”
It was slow motion, leaving the gate. He shoved off so hard that he didn’t make contact with the snow for a second or two but when he did, something burst to life inside of him, suffusing his entire being with simultaneous riot and calm.
John’s lips twisted in apprehension; he sighed and reconsidered what he seemed to be about to say. After a brief pause, John bit at his bottom lip and pressed on, “You’re still in this, Sherlock. Is this going to distract you from training? Are you-”
It’s been a hell of a day, and a bath sounds so good that once he enters the flat, he beelines for the loo. He doesn’t prepare now, like he used to, just shucks his clothes and tosses them on the bed. Naked, he walks through to the bathroom and turns on the taps. The tub hasn’t been properly scrubbed in ages, but it’s just him and Mary using it.
each other?
“Yeah, I’ll let you know if it begins to hurt.”
“It’s the Olympics, John,” Sherlock murmured, dipping to speak right next to John’s ear. “You’re going to need to think bigger.”
Lifting the cover off of the plate he was greeted with a heaping pile of scrambled eggs, four pieces of toast, and a half of a grapefruit. Sherlock’s mind blanked out for a brief second; no one save for his trainers had ever provided him with breakfast before, and that had been because he’d been on a strict regime and had been told not to take supplements.
athletes for this piece?” Sherlock returns, holding out his hand for a shake.
and sips at his coffee.
“Sherlock, goodness! You’ve startled me half to death, and John here-”
John is drawn in instantly, settles his lips just under Sherlock’s ear and sucks gently. When Sherlock’s breath kicks out of him, John hums against his skin, “Mmmm, yeah?”
He abandons his phone and snatches up his laptop, logging on quickly and instead of responding to the email, opens a new chat box.
John looked so intent, as though he had something planned. Reaching forward, he plucked the glass from Sherlock and placed it alongside his on the coffee table, sidling right up to Sherlock immediately after, his nose trailing along behind Sherlock’s hairline. He heard John sigh and then suddenly, John was straddling Sherlock’s legs, his arse settling back on his knees.
Sherlock grunts, heaving another box on top of the two in front of him. “More newspapers,” he mumbles as he slides those three over to John as well.
“So.”
It guts him when he pulls himself from the sweetly deceptive thoughts.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, desperate, soppy words tearing up his throat, threatening to give it all away before he could even think about an actual solution. “I--”
“Shut up,” Sherlock says with a sad smile. “He bought me a drink. A drink I didn’t want. I wanted—was there for—something else. Wanted, ehm, a quick trip to the loo would be a way to put it without being crass,” and he smiles at that too, at withholding a deliberately obscene description.
His fingers drum just below the keyboard and John breaks into a grin, shakes his head and looks up at the ceiling, thrilled with his choice. He wonders how long he can wait before sending Molly a reply. Part of him doesn’t want to seem too eager, but the other part of him doesn’t give a toss and so he writes back that he can indeed start on Monday, and sends it off.
. Naturally, Redbeard is more than willing to lend an unjudging ear; he’s not human, but he’ll do.
Now, Sherlock raised a hand and hailed a cab, making sure John was tucked inside before climbing in himself.
“Christ.” John pulls away a bit, scrubs a hand over his face. “Christ, I’m, I’m… you make me... Sherlock.”
“Right, due respect Greg but I can take care of myself. I think I’ve made that rather clear, yeah?” John was standing now, arms crossed tightly over his chest. “I’m in this, and I want to be in this. Just so everything is plain.”
“You want to hear about them?”
They’re silent for most of the walk, but as they draw closer, Sherlock finds that his apprehension keeps notching up a level. They reach a crosswalk two blocks from Baker Street and Molly glances up at him. “Stop it.”
The shower he takes is of no use, and, when he dries and changes into his pajamas, John resigns himself to taking a shower in the morning as well. He can’t be seen at the surgery like this, can he?
Moran’s jaw set a bit more tightly and Sherlock continued on before Moran could think about their situation or gather any of his thoughts together.
He turned with a wink and sauntered off back towards the locker rooms and Sherlock released a huge gust of air he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
“We’re really doing this,” John whispers as he crawls atop Sherlock on the bed, nosing against Sherlock’s neck, behind his ear.
It was bizarre, being quite so overcome with emotion, but he managed it with grace, taking a deep breath before greeting each new interviewer.
John smiled, his voice dipping lower; he took the pause to settle his onto the heel of his palm atop the table, elbow propping his arm up. “So what will you do, then? Coach?”
It seemed that John might have had a similar idea in mind, allowing his hands only to wander as far as Sherlock’s waist, leaning on him fully but lightly. Sherlock’s hands roamed casually over John’s back, never deigning to slip beneath the fabric of his jumper. It was nice like this, the thrumming emotions somehow muted by the lethargy at which they moved; Sherlock was content to kiss behind John’s ear for some time, just lingering until John sighed happily and peeled himself back to sit up.
John struggles with words, because he doesn’t know how to ask for one thing out of the countless things that he wants from Sherlock. It’s all a bit surreal, truly, that they’re having this conversation to begin with, very reasonably, with no-holds-barred, and it’s all catching up with John, how wildly foal-legged he suddenly feels. The words are coming, choppily, slowly, but they’re coming, and it’s almost easy. And then too, with the ease, is a feeling as though the fluidity of their admissions, the way they’re simply coming out with it might negate all of the suffering they’ve weathered together.
since he’s been with
“Yes, thank you very much,” Sherlock said graciously and at a peal of John’s giddy laughter, leaned his head against the cool window with a groan.
Sherlock sighed and wiped at his face with a towel. “No, that won’t be necessary.”
“Do enjoy that, brother. I need to get to the gym unless you’ve more patronizing to do?”
“This is not your key,” she said again, this time having the decency to pull a strained expression. “We will find your key. Please give us a moment.” With that, she turned towards a coworker who had entered the reception area, talking in hushed tones over the card reader. Another moment passed and Sherlock was able to pick up a few scattered Russian words, none of which made any sense.
“I’m your only friend,” John says, still in awe, still in something like shock.
Sherlock sounds.
“I’d heard that, yeah. Hopefully that doesn’t mean more work for me.” John walked cautiously beside Sherlock, matching his slower pace.
“It really is fantastic what people could discern from the world if they simply observed.”
Sherlock moved then, pressing his mouth to John’s in a slow, tender kiss. “I’ve not wanted anyone like I want you.”
“But. One evening, not seven times but… five,” Sherlock finishes. “Thus…the article was a stretch, but not much of one.” That sad smile is back, Sherlock looking down into his lap, into the scant sip of alcohol left in his glass. “Then I went to Meadowview—dreadful name, dreadful place—and he went to America.”
John blinked, sucking a bit of cream off of the side of his pinky. ”Thought you said it was barbaric.”
A few long minutes of silence later, interspersed with the quiet noise of swallowing, Sherlock asks, “You think it’s too outlandish?”
of your work for you. However would you justify receiving a paycheck?”
he’d mentioned when they got back to the hotel…
“Should we…” John finds himself licking his lips and giving Sherlock a very slow once over, so that there’s no mistaking his intentions. He watches as Sherlock swallows, his mouth to peeking open, something like expectation lingering in the movement.
Sherlock groans. “Learn to bloody drive!” he growls at the driver and flops himself back against the seat, bringing a palm down over his face in defeat.
Still, if it kept him in London…
He can feel his face racing through different emotions, and he can’t stop it. Confusion, anger, sadness, disbelief, frustration, they all coalesce as he says, “Wait…with…no…”
“Good morning, John,” Sherlock says and takes a step towards him. John’s eyes drop, lingering on the swath of skin that Sherlock’s left revealed at his neck, and in the next moment, John’s eyes sweep his whole body. Ah, not entirely uninterested, then. Or, John can perhaps appreciate the male form. When their eyes meet again, John’s cheeks have gone the tiniest bit pink, his mouth slipping open a fraction.
But when Sherlock stills, John glances up at him, astonished and saddened to find apprehension in his gaze.
“I love you, John,” comes Sherlock’s admission, anguished this time. “I didn’t… know it would feel like this.”
Getting to his feet, Sherlock moved to the gate and readied himself, tugging at his gloves one last time before getting into starting position. He secured his goggles over his eyes and shifted his thighs and buttocks down and back.
Sherlock does much the same, just a short distance away.
He spends the next long moments absent-mindedly cleaning his body, while his mind is wrapped up in the intensity of the evening. Each and every feeling he’d experienced rushed back into the forefront of his mind, assailing his consciousness. He leans a forearm against the glass and sucks in a deep breath, keeping the panic at bay.
“Do not,” Sherlock growled, low and dangerous, straining forward and nearly tipping the chair, “touch him.”
John was making quiet little noises, mewls of approval and stuttered moans that were swallowed up when Sherlock ducked in for another kiss, a deeper kiss.
Leaning in, John licks up the side of Sherlock’s neck, hastens his strokes, angles so that their bodies are pressed more fully together. Sweat makes the movements easier, and John finds himself panting along with Sherlock, not from exertion, but from arousal.
It’s remarkable, to think he knows a city so well, and then to see it through another’s eyes.
Sherlock blinks, glances out the window and then back across the restaurant. He’s never felt so entirely out of his element . “Yes, well…” And then he’s at a complete and utter loss for words. This never happens to him and he begins to panic, throat seizing up, palms itching.
, his brother’s voice rings–while being Guest.
“No, but she’ll be pleased to find me here, I assure you.”
paranoid. As if this is born from some misguided attempt to keep him from medalling because he’s your biggest competition.” He shrugged, looking embarrassed. “You’re in your last Olympics and he’s your biggest rival and I-”
“Ahhh,” Sherlock said eventually in delight, landing on John’s area of expertise. “Why aren’t you sitting with the other physicians?”
“My brother he... there’s a photograph in a tabloid, the two of us…”
How childish. How
John eats and Sherlock picks; the food is delicious but he finds he’s not terribly hungry, just going through the motions of eating, picking at this and that. But it’s quite something, the tiny, hot thrill that runs through him every time John reaches across the small table to take something from a shared plate.
my bed, John.”
John’s response comes quickly.
“Listen, he’s already waist deep, it certainly can’t hurt, and since he already knows what’s going on he
on Guest?
Glancing up at the large board in the wall, he saw that he was sixth in the lineup. He’d have a bit of time to wait, but that was fine. Turning to his team, Sherlock motioned for them all to come over; they huddled around him, all in various stages of restrained excitement.
God, Sherlock hates emoticons generally, but in these emails, he doesn’t find them entirely off-putting. Another email pings in his inbox, right on the heels of the first one.
Greg smiled and pulled his face away from where he had nestled it into the curve of Molly’s neck. “Oi, John, you’re a good man and it was brilliant meeting you. Sure we’ll be seeing more of one another. And take care of that one, eh? He’s not as tough as he looks.”
She grinned at him and nodded, though something flashed in her eyes, silently demanding he elaborate. Damned media, if it bled, it led, but he wasn’t getting sucked into it, this drama. “I’m a little banged up but obviously fine.”
“No doubt,” John grumbled.
John chuckles, attempts to cover it with a cough, but fails. “Due diligence,” he says quietly, as Lestrade raises an amused brow.
real critiques for you at the moment.” Lestrade chuckled and they climbed into the tram that would take them to the Village. “I don’t know - you almost look like you’re having
John bit his bottom lip and considered. He looked unsure for a moment, put a little off-kilter by Sherlock’s scrutiny, but as the seconds ticked by his eyes and face cleared; John leveled his gaze across the sofa at Sherlock, resolute. “I don’t want to say that it’s a hunch because it makes me feel like I’m losing it but, his guy, the big one - Moran - was talking to his trainer yesterday and it just, it was odd. They stuck out, you know? Moran was speaking Japanese which struck me as strange. Big hulking idiot like that?” John mimicked Sherlock’s pose, slapping his palms down onto his legs.
His challenger came out of the gate explosively, body bent to perfection as he took on the first set of turns. Sherlock couldn’t rightly tell how well his skis were cutting into the snow due to the large pixels on the monitor and the sunlight that obstructed his view. He’d have to review tape of it later, when he was alone.
that Sherlock would ever admit that aloud.
John’s scowl is so fierce he can feel it in the bridge of his nose. “Right, yeah, well. You’re not staying, so, if you could. Thanks for being, you know, a dick. Thought that maybe after-”
“Get on with it, then, you deviant,” John says, smacking Sherlock’s chest lightly and takes Sherlock’s mouth again, is delighted when longer fingers curve around his arse. John’s fingers find the fine hair at Sherlock’s nape and stroke, ridges and whorls gliding over curls.
There are ellipses that appear and disappear several times; the anxiety in Sherlock’s stomach notches up another level with each appearance and disappearance.
He’s not sure why he says these things, half of the time. Sometimes, his mouth moves at the speed of his brain and he can’t edit the words that come out. Sometimes he thinks he means them and sometimes he doesn’t, but he never usually feels this positively
John falls back against the bed, Sherlock’s head now just within reach. It’s a moment before gentle fingers begin carding through the camera-ready gelled curls, peeling strands apart.
For a while, John zones out to The Clash, running and walking intermittently along the South Bank, casually taking in the sights. It’s only when he stops for a breath that he thinks about Guest, allows a dull, hollow sort of guilt to creep from his stomach to his throat.
“You can see him finding tuck right here and tucking all the way through; this next section is where I expect to see the aerodynamics. He’s so tight here, just a really capable athlete. We see him checking some speed at the bottom,” Bode says, note of awe in his voice.
The thing is, he can’t imagine saying no. The idea sends a wave of panic through him; he wishes he could pick that apart, the panic when thinking about cutting off ties with someone who is only an internet acquaintance. He can’t explain it at all, but Sherlock admits to himself that he looks forward to John5NF’s emails, that he
Hips are twisted at odd angles, and John is half on the bed and half off, but his mind whites out as his hands find themselves at Sherlock’s hips once more, trousers loose, but still he waits.
“The film,
open. It seemed his only likely option was to pick the lock on either the front or the back door. Whipping out his mobile, he took photographs of the back door and the windows that he could easily see, knowing he needed to make quick work of the rest of the home.
“Yeah, heh, Molly isn’t in, she’s out to lunch, won’t be back for another forty minutes,” John checks his watch. “I’m guessing.” He finishes smoothing down the canvas of his jacket and lets his hands fall to his sides, fingers curved slightly into a ball.
“Yeah?” Greg pulled back, laughing, and looked him in the eye.
“Oh,” Sherlock thinks for a moment. He can’t for the life of him remember why he’d brought John Watson up at all. “Nothing, actually.”
He feels himself flush hot and then cold and then, out of sheer disbelief, he glances around the flat to ensure that yes, he did indeed forget his cane back in Brixton. What in the world...
She blows a tuft of hair out of her eyes and gives John a sweet and apologetic smile. “Well as can be, I’ve been slammed through all morning. Haven’t even had the chance to grab lunch. It’s,” she sighs and glances around at the gurneys. “A lot.”
“Oh, oh my god, please, just-”
Sherlock nearly trips over Redbeard as he’s walking by, in his haste to get to the computer.
“Good, so do I,” John responded as his thumbs hovered over the screen patiently, waiting for Sherlock’s digits.
If he hurries, he supposes he could catch Molly-who is still up to her eyeballs with backlog- before she leaves for the day, perhaps get another look at that jumper, see if any new bruising or clotting has formed. It’s as good a plan as any, so once he ensures that he has his wallet, keys, and coat, he bounds down the steps and hails a cab.
“I know it is.”
“Oi!”
He waits and waits and six minutes and four seconds later, Molly emerges, a paper cup of coffee in her hand.
“It is,” comes the distracted reply, as he peels another water-warped cover off of a storage box. “And if you hadn’t noticed, you were never asked to pitch in for hydro or electric, or really any of the repairs, come to think of it.”
What would he want to read, what would he want to receive in response to being stood up by someone he’d been so hoping to meet?
Sherlock goggles at the text; tapas is a meal to
“But you didn’t, because race day is-” Sherlock managed to cut him off with a severe scowl and Lestrade’s mouth snapped shut almost comically. “Right, go on.”
“It’s all under investigation,” Lestrade murmured, eyes, still closed, cutting into their conversation. “But Moran came to shortly after you two arrived here, did a bit of talking,” he added, casually.
you. Want to get to know you more, want to… I don’t know, this all sounds rather exciting though. This investigating a murder business,” John finished with a flourish, cheeks flushed from his diatribe as he stopped and stood with his hands on his hips.
It sounds as though Sherlock’s mouth is pressed right to the door when he next speaks. “What if I need the toilet!?”
The grin that slid onto Sherlock’s face felt somehow foreign, it was so wide. “Yes, I did say that.”
“Yeah, well, they needed someone to mentor the first years and the next thing I know I’m teaching immunology. The pay is… fine. The administration leaves a lot to be desired, but I do get an office.”
“Yes, I am.” Sherlock replied with a chuckle. “How is the new hotel?”
“No,” was Sherlock’s immediate reply.
“Oh you’re a peach, you think I find you
There’s almost a smile in his voice, John swears he hears it when Sherlock hums, “Mmmm, no.”
His tongue is at the corner of his lips as he taps his answers out.
, he wonders?) there’s nothing to be done. He shouldn’t feel upset for being excited to see Sherlock again because Sherlock, at the very least, has shown up. John feels for a moment how entirely underwhelming that fact is, how depressing that showing up is the bar he’s set for himself.
for a very long time. The message disappears and reappears several times before his message appears.
this a date?
“John?” Sherlock asks awkwardly, shifting his weight quickly from one foot to the other.
“Yes. Thankfully, obviously. Just… play nice. And maybe smile. For the cameras, the ladies love your smile.”
When Sherlock comes, he very nearly sits up, abs contracting as his mouth pulls into a grimace, against John’s, sloppy kissing turning to simply smears of contact. With every pulse of his cock he moans, like he’s been punched, like he’s being bled dry, and all into John’s mouth. It takes long seconds for the spasms to stop, for Sherlock’s muscles to unclench, relax.
“This is all so fucking insane,” John had muttered once Sherlock had gotten around to describing Moran and Moriarty appearing at his hotel room door. Sherlock had nodded once down at John in agreement; it was fucking insane, but it was over.
Sherlock shoved his free hand underneath the pillow and punched the headboard in front of him three times in rapid succession. He didn’t abide Mycroft when he was wide awake, nevermind first thing in the morning; he could only speculate as to what utter nonsense he’d called about. “What do you
Sherlock jerked and groaned, flopping an arm out to his side, into which John crawled and laid himself out, happy and sated, judging by the coy little smile on his lips.
New jumper, newly polished shoes. Shirt not posh enough to try and make a first impression, but smart enough to still impress. You’re nervous, your hand keeps trembling and you keep bouncing your foot as though you’ve somewhere to be and you keep glancing off down the road towards your intended destination. It’s early, and you’re eating breakfast, not wanting to have to pause in what is sure to be a hectic day to find sustenance. And you’re enjoying your time outside; it’s windy and cool, not a day for sitting around, but you know you’ll be inside for a long while, possibly without natural light?”
When the next email comes his laptop wobbles and almost crashes to the floor due to his haste in wanting to open the message.
They awoke early the next day and John curled himself tightly around Sherlock’s body for long minutes. John pressed his lips to the back of Sherlock’s neck and inhaled, pulling away after leaving a kiss. “Time to get up.”
“Please!” Sherlock nods, furiously.
“Knew it,” John returns in triumph. “Tell me.”
Sherlock doesn’t know, he doesn’t know anything. He’s so totally at sea that he can’t think of a thing to write in return, other than,
Sherlock shook his head slowly and considered, wondering why he hadn’t immediately shrugged off John’s hands. The hard floor was doing nothing for the state of his back and it wouldn’t do him any good just lingering in the hallway on the verge of falling asleep. John was a doctor, prone to helping out the weak and in need. Sherlock was sure that as a doctor he also likely had some fantastic painkillers in his room, ones that would put his back and knees out of their misery. That was enough to make up Sherlock’s mind and he stood on stiff legs, dipping his head in a show of acceptance.
Sherlock made a few notes in his moleskine before replying. “British Ski and Snowboard, the BBC and NBC Sports. Still early, yet.”
“Hmmm,” Sherlock agrees, imagining John in a proper suit, ring on his finger.
“Yes. Can’t imagine.” With that, Sherlock gets up from the stool and turns. “And you’re an aging ex-military adrenaline junkie who can't even overcome his own psychosomatic symptoms, so it's no wonder they stuck you in the morgue with dead people as you'd be hopeless trying to help living ones.”
He blows out a breath through his nose. “Hiding? No. Avoiding, yes.”
“So?”
Sherlock blinked.
John walked into the room, paced between the window and the table of the living room and then stopped, hands balled into fists at his sides. “So.”
“Oh Sherlock,” Moriarty said wistfully, pushing himself off of the wall, “there’s no need to be so
John just hangs his head on a burst of laughter. “The tub. Clean it.”
Wednesday dawns rainy and bleak and Sherlock spends a few extra lingering in moments in bed, enjoying the warmth of the dog along his feet. It’s creeping towards nine o’clock and he stretches, reaches for his phone to be met by three texts from Molly.
“I’m simply ensuring that we won’t be plastered all over The Daily Mail tomorrow,” Sherlock said, and blinked at him as he turned to glance across the table. “I’d rather we both didn’t have to worry about our public image but, for the time being…”
. Strange, that this slightly supersedes the need he has to solve this case. That’s ever-present, but just the idea of John, constantly making itself known alongside these alluring suicides begs Sherlock’s attention.
“No,” Sherlock agreed, equally as quiet. “I can’t.”
the message reads and Sherlock finds himself falling back onto his bed in a fit of delight. Half-heartedly he rebukes himself to no avail, as a smile slides up onto his face. There’s no point in trying to halt the flood of emotions that chatting with John evokes in him.
, you said.”
“I believe you promised me some grinding in a dark corner,” Sherlock murmured from behind him, close to John’s ear.
“No, probably not, but…” Sherlock released him and helped him back down into the chair. A moment later Sherlock was down on his knees in front of John, his palms resting on John’s thighs. “Three broken ribs, another four likely bruised, a bit of this,” he gestured at his face. “The inside of my mouth is a mess, but. Could have been a lot worse.”
Sherlock’s answering laugh was disbelieving, “Oh is that so? How does one come by that skill?”
Notions of his hot bath swirled away as he groaned and trudged back to the elevator, taking it down to the lobby.
When Sherlock pulled back, the color was high on John’s cheeks, but he seemed content to just share in Sherlock’s space, not pushing for any further intimacy. There was trust there, in his gaze, a sort of solidified assuredness that Sherlock had seen from very few people in his life. He made up his mind about what he wanted to do instantly.
”No, Sherlock,” John climbs hastily onto the bed and shuffles over, tosses one knee over Sherlock so that he’s straddling Sherlock’s thighs. “Never. This has been... ” John sighs, palms pressed into Sherlock’s stomach, “God, you… I’ve wanted you so much. For so long. I…”
John laughs, a deep bark and grins at Sherlock, shakes his head, disbelieving. He sighs happily, shakes his head in wonder, “Didn’t think you’d be this playful.”
“Doctor John Watson,” Sherlock begins, his gaze remaining on John before he turns and addresses Lestrade. “Here to assist me in looking at the pertinent files.”
But then he realizes that they have time. They have all the time they want to suss all of this out. It doesn’t have to happen at once, doesn’t all have to be spoken of and absorbed tonight. It’s incredible, what that realization does to him; it feels like weight sloughing away, like he’s finally seeing the sun for the first time in months, finally breathing.
Bending to remove his skis, he caught sight of a small group of people gathered near the entrance towards the grandstands. They were all wearing team Britain jackets but Sherlock couldn’t recognize any of them at a distance.
“Biathlete turned doctor turned soldier turned ski team medic,” Sherlock mused, draining the dregs from his wine glass. “Quite the CV.”
“Evening,” he replied pleasantly, and held out the bottle of wine to him with one hand, “thought it would be appropriate.”
“Tonight?”
Then he’s moving with express purpose. John crosses to the bed and sits astride the edge, reaches for Sherlock just as Sherlock is reaching for him. It’s a fumble, a messy meeting of lips and John laughs into it, Sherlock’s tongue sweeping in, swiping at him. There is restraint vibrating between the two of them as they fall into a languid push and pull.
“Is it cliche to tell you I’ve thought about kissing you for positively ages?”
The first article in the list was NBC Sports and Sherlock clicked on it.
“About what?”
John’s palm presses into the naked skin over Sherlock’s heart, rests there. “It was a lot.”
“More than friend, John,” Sherlock says, and when John looks back on him, he’s looking at the floor. Perhaps Sherlock too feels like the packaging is still on their relationship. But he shouldn’t be meant to find any unsteady ground here.
John crouched down and got straight to it, and Sherlock was pleased to find that John trusted Sherlock; he didn’t check that the door wasn’t wired, or that they weren’t being surveilled. He obviously trusted Sherlock at his word.
here Lestrade, I couldn’t care less whether you think me an arsehole or not.”
The lodgings too were structured in a way to foster camaraderie amongst the attendees. The athletes were placed in dorms usually of two or more, unless a member wished to fund their own, individual room.
By the time he made it up to the top of the runs, the sun was high in the sky, so bright it nearly rendered Sherlock’s sunglasses moot. Still, he took it all in from the tram, his outer visage looking for all the world to be the uninterested, seasoned skier; inside, his organs were thrumming with the desire to get on the slopes. It was an addiction, and withdrawal was rearing its head rather spectacularly.
Redbeard walks on, paying Sherlock no mind, instead stopping to sniff at a small tree as he passes. “You know, I do feed and house you,” Sherlock grouses. “The least you could do is pretend to be interested.”
His email pings.
Sherlock blew out a breath and stood, knowing that he was on deck, watching as the top rated skier from Norway disappeared through the gate. It was silent in the tent for a moment and then an official was hurrying Sherlock to the starting line, as though he’d never done this before, as though this wasn’t all completely routine to him.
From his prone position on the floor, Sherlock could make out Moran’s manic expression, his harried, jerky movements as he took stock of the two of them on the floor. For him to pull this off--for him to

“Really, freak. With the visitor’s badge!” Sally says, vaguely alarmed and completely amused.
think something is up with today’s injury. We should get out in front of it, get him here before he comes to us.” John’s hands paused and then curled around Sherlock’s, lacing their fingers together.
Sherlock frowns, wonders what the etiquette is for a situation such as this. Should he get John’s attention? He doesn’t have to think on it further, as John glances down at either of his pockets and shuffles on his feet.
For a moment there is silence, Molly halting halfway across the room. Sherlock stares at John, looks his fill, from the tips of his shoes to the top of his head and John swears he sees a ghost of a smile flicker across Sherlock’s mouth. “Perhaps some other time. Molly has the samples I need and they’re quite time sensitive.”
? And early, too. Worried, are you?”
“I’m your coach,” Lestrade grinned at him and held up the coach credentials he’d held onto from years prior. “Walk with confidence and be charming and you can get whatever you want.”
of a second behind him.
With plans to meet John for lunch, Sherlock spent his afternoon pursuing a few avenues of investigation into Moriarty's possible involvement in Hanzu's death. At the gym, he dodged a flurry of media personnel who had spotted him and ducked into the building, his trademark sunglasses obscuring his eyes. Elite level athletes didn’t die while performing their sports, it just didn’t happen, and so it was no surprise that the amount of press waiting at the gym to get soundbites from the athletes was so large.
The cursor flickers at him once more, and before he can wonder if it’s still vogue to troll chat rooms for anonymous companionship, his fingers are taking to the keyboard. In his twenties he’d browsed chat rooms, sometimes just to feel alive vicariously through others’ experiences, other times for genuine companionship. Now, well, he doesn’t really know what he’s doing. But it’s something that he knows at least a bit about, or rather did, some fifteen years ago.
“Jesus-how.” John shakes his head, outraged. “You’re a piece of-How do you sleep at night?”
John lifted a single brow in Sherlock’s direction.
Sherlock gave a half-smile at that, the usage of
But Mike--dear Mike--just claps his palm down on his knee and says, “I’m still at Barts, you know. Pathetic, eh?”
“Well,” Sherlock said, staring at the wall in front of him. “They’ll have to hold the final or there will be an uproar on an international scale.”
God, even
“You can pay me back if it’s such strange behavior,” Sherlock shrugs, noting how John’s nostrils flare. It’s such a minute movement but Sherlock catches it and feels a thrill of
Sherlock secures his hands behind his back and for a moment, looks sheepish. “I didn’t necessarily procure the room for the bed, John.” John hums to himself and glances out the large window that overlooks the lake. “Though I’m sure we’ll enjoy that.”
“You want it?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed further. “Cody Jackson, the World Cup…”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed and he asked the question even though he knew the answer. “Me?”
John hums, and gathers Sherlock in close, wrapping his arms tightly around.
“Seriously, Sherlock,” John whispered, finding the fingers that were in his hair and twining their hands together almost too tightly. “Get out of your head. I know what you’re thinking, I know that you’re trying to talk yourself out of all of this because you’re a
“Right well, I’ll be there. I mean, I’ll be on hand to- if anyone needs attention… you know what I-”

“It has the distinct possibility of being what you might consider to be a ‘thing’, yes.”
easily.”
They’d been back in London for a month and a half, and Sherlock was just managing to take John out on a proper date.
The dialogue box reads
He was strong lines and graceful curves, his hips cutting to the left and right to steer his body. Powerful calves shifted and contracted, angling his skis. His lean muscles flexed beneath the lycra as he twisted around a sharp turn and thudded over a jump, his head down and eyes focused as he rocketed ahead.
. The man on the bench--William--had nearly been charming, in a mysterious, strange sort of way. The man in the morgue had been entirely off-putting and obviously out to undermine what little authority John had.
Sherlock feels seared by the kiss, by John’s mere presence–completely full of adoration for him. He feels full to bursting, and so present.
“If the rather fantastic dinner-”
Japan’s Yuruhu Hanzu tragically crashed out on the Russian Trampoline portion of the Rosa Khutor downhill course this morning. A novice skier in his first Olympics, he was seen bobbling into the Trampoline and landed a jump on one ski, causing him to crash into the guard fence. He was seen being treated by course medics but was pronounced dead at the scene.
“John was kind enough to house me for the evening after that deplorable hotel locked me out of my room,” Sherlock added.
“You’re looking for a tactful way to discern whether I prefer men over women.” Comes Sherlock’s bold statement, and when it hits John’s ears, he realizes how ludicrous it sounds.
“So?” Lestrade pressed, glancing around at the other athletes who were beginning to prepare.
This is his person.
But this is Sherlock Holmes.
for you if he’s making you do this, if he’s making certain that you’re the one guilty of murder?”
Sherlock’s hands fold primly on the table before him, and he clears his throat quiet daintily before speaking. “For instance, does one simply lay out the exact minutes, hours, days, since realizing one is so deeply in love with someone, right at the table?” Sherlock allows the words to land, allows John to hear them, leans in so that their heads are closer together, never breaks eye contact. They’re both breathless and stunned by the frank confessions that it feels like a blessing when Sherlock breaks the tension, “Does one wait to order wine to say all of that, or is that better confessed prior to?”
Sherlock’s phone pings with a new email.
“You know—” John waits while two new pints are placed before them, giving the bartender a smile in thanks before turn his attention wholly back to Sherlock. He turns his body, too, knees just centimeters away from Sherlock’s thigh. “You know everything. About me.”
He smeared each on the plexiglass that served as the room’s chair rail and took various measurements that he knew were likely wholly inaccurate, if only for something to
John purses his lips at that, moving the mouse around and clicking on various links. Though it’s an unverified health advice site, after awhile of perusal, John finds that many of the people spouting diagnostics and suggestions seem to be hitting the nail on the head. The layout of the site is sleek and uncomplicated, with a few ads in the sidebar, but nothing ostentatious.
At eleven, he rolls out of bed feeling like a
at this, at
Sherlock’s head falls to his hands, his elbows on his knees as it eats him up, from the inside out. How could he have possibly thought to do this? How could he have possibly thought that this was a good idea, that someone as good and true as John Watson would accept him after all of this? How could anyone trust someone after they’d been put through this. He’s cocked it all up, monumentally, from the outset. His need to be clever had overtaken rational thought and led him down this path.
of heavy metal losing momentum loud in the cavernous space--but doors finally swing shut. John sighs and wipes a palm over his face. “Well he’s…”
John smacks his arse lightly and steps over to the bathtub; the pipes give a delightful groan before water begins spilling into the basin. John sits for a while, watching as the water swirls, picks up refracted light, diffuses it. He can hear the breaking of the waves and the wind as it squeals through miniscule cracks in between the stone and the glass.
Molly tugged at Greg’s arm in warning and he stumbled forward, being led away from Sherlock and John, who watched them go with twin expressions of bewilderment. “What’s that mean?” John asked, glancing up briefly at Sherlock before turning in the direction of the Village and their hotel.
to correspond with him, look forward to speaking with him?
The room smelled of sweat and sex and underneath it, the new, rich scent of the man beside him. Sherlock’s eyelids slipped closed and he allowed himself a moment to drift, to allow the endorphins to finish sizzling through his veins and leave him completely wiped out and sated. He couldn’t imagine moving from the bed at the moment, but John had been right earlier when he’d mentioned that they should begin developing a plan in regard to Moriarty.
Sherlock almost smiles; he’s taking this John’s advice to help in a situation with another John. God, the whole of society really was so boring with it’s conventionally, bland names. Then again, perhaps John5NF had chosen that username because it afforded him even more anonymity. Just another John amongst a sea of Johns. Sherlock hopes-for some reason he cannot discern-that John5NF is that clever.
his mind circles back and instead of becoming stuck in a loop of circular logic, he flops onto his other side, presses a pillow atop his head and forces himself to recite the entire periodic table, including atomic weight and mass, u ntil he drops off into a fitful sleep.
Sherlock wonders for a moment, if John5NF has mulled over Sherlock’s proposition just as Sherlock had mulled over  it himself. If John5NF is apprehensive, conjuring up images of Sherlock in his mind. He wonders, for the umpteenth time, what John5NF looks like and why in the world that would matter.
It makes him emotional, and the insistent tug in the center of his chest threatens to derail the night’s proceeding. Sherlock senses it, and pulls away, his face still so close that warm breaths puff across John’s skin.
“And I thought all of your, your, what, deductions? I thought they were so brilliant. Really, truly brilliant and then ‘Oh, I’m William,’ and of
Making his way through the sliding glass doors, Sherlock resolved to wake early and make use of the gym, perhaps get in a good workout on the leg press machine. He had five days before his competition was slated to start, which meant he could continue his limited training regimen for a bit longer without risking harm to his body.
. I’ve no standing with the delegation, no official coach! This isn’t something I can just saunter in with!”
But John just moved to stand beside him, reached out the hand that held his pint and gestured towards a group of ice skaters.
For Sherlock’s insistence that food isn’t something that his body requires, John is aware that Sherlock actually loves fine food, so it’s not surprising when he tucks into his lamb without a word. John only picks at his salmon, too preoccupied with keeping his focus on Sherlock, the way his fingers hold his fork, the way he chews, dabs at his mouth with his napkin. He moves with the same mechanical precision as usual, but John watches for differences. Because everything is different now, isn’t it?
Those days away together, alone save for the case, were something John craved so viscerally that he was nearly embarrassed by it.
John had texted the night previous. Sherlock had snickered, googleing John’s name and easily finding photos of him online with captions such as “Sherlock Holmes’s longtime beau John Watson takes in biathlon.” He had texted all of them back.
“Sherlock,” John whispered once, low and then again louder when Sherlock didn’t budge. “Sherlock, we can move now.”
“And it’s terrible, I know, I’m just wondering if this wouldn’t be better left for after the downhill is over. If you find something,
Sherlock scowls down at the screen, prepared to send the drafted email into the trash, when the taxi swerves violently, the driver shouting out a curse. When Sherlock rights himself, he finds the email gone from the screen of his phone. There’s a different burning in his stomach now, as he immediately opens his sent messages folder to find the
“Fuck, that’s hot,” John manages, breathlessly, and pushing the mess back inside of him with two fingers.
Behind Greg, John stood with the rest of the ski medics who were celebrating audibly. John spared him a glance and in the space of a
It was a hunch but a good one, and Sherlock generally trusted his instincts when it came to skiing. Moriarty’s constant goading of him - while not strange - only helped to bolster Sherlock’s inner assertion that his suspicions were correct. But to prove it, to prove it he’d need time and access to Moriarty’s belongings; he’d need information.
“Well, it’s nice out. Could do with some nice, spring sunshine, yeah?” Sherlock watches as John shoves his hands into his pockets, his chest expanding just so. Sherlock notes the plane of John’s chest, stretching beneath the fine checked pattern of his shirt, notes the length of his nose and the way his hair sits.
a complete idiot. Sherlock twisted his empty fork against his plate and found himself wondering where John was right at that very moment; was he conversing with other athletes from the delegation, chatting with them just as amicably as he’d chatted with Sherlock? Getting to
It took awhile to get himself situated, but Phillip had him lock in and test the resistance, reset his boots and then try again. By the time he was set with poles in his hands, he was on deck. It hit him then, a fastball to the solar plexus, that this was it. This was
Sherlock’s mouth ticks up and his chest and neck flush just so. “I do know.”
it. Can’t quite say I’ve seen that look on you before.”
“God, it’s as if you’re on a loop!” Sherlock chuckles, patronizingly. “Your bearing, you’re in the army, or were, that much is obvious. The way you hold yourself, ramrod straight; your entire demeanor screams military. You’re used to giving people orders and having people follow them, so, a leadership position. Please, you’d have to be
He swallowed and blinked down at his lap. “And if Moriarty is responsible for this, these deaths, think about what danger you’re in Sherlock. He could target you, he could-”
He spent a considerable time in the shower, allowing the hot water to ease some of the regular tension in his muscles. Head towards the spray, he smiled into it, realizing how ridiculous he was being at allowing the spark of excitement about the course, about John, about it
But John would text him and then he’d have it. John would
“Aren’t you the least bit curious about Hanzu’s death?” Sherlock spat back, a tad viciously. He advanced on Lestrade a step and threw the full force of his gaze down his nose at the man. “Athletes of our caliber don’t die at events like this. It just. Doesn’t.
“Course not,” John returns, some of the rigidness going out of his form, “Making an observation. Kinda like he does, just-“
now too, then.”
: Victim?
John works his jaw from side to side. It seems as though Sherlock is willing to talk about it, but John doesn’t know how to ask. They’re one another’s closest and most intimate friend; they’re truly partners. But talking about sex, talking about love even, it’s never been something they’ve tread near.
them. That though they’ve only conversed online and only for a short time, that Sherlock feels some sort of undeniable pull towards him.
Sherlock’s heart plummeted instantaneously and he pushed his head firmly into the pillow before beating his face into it twice. Just as he’d feared, a member of the media had caught them at it. At
: you’re taught stiff upper lip and all that but yes it was hard. And talking to you, it’s made it so much easier, it really has.
After a moment, Sherlock presses his mouth into the duvet. “I hate the Olympics,” comes a lethargic little grouse.
With his greatcoat over his arm he hails a cab to St. Bart’s; he feels a bit lighter this morning. He realizes that it likely has to do with the email exchanges from John5NF and while yesterday he would have rebuked himself for indulging in such seemingly pointless correspondence, he finds that at the moment he’s not in the least perturbed by it.
interesting? “That’s actually rather brilliant. You got all of that from just looking at me?”
quick?”
to the grip of John’s fingers in his hair, Sherlock loved sucking John off. He was so delightfully responsive and never shy, never hesitated to pump his hips gently when he wanted more, never thought twice about coming all over Sherlock’s face. John Watson’s cock was such a gorgeous and responsive part of John’s body and Sherlock absolutely
“Yes, Molly. I know what Grindr- no. I, we met online. In another capacity.” With that he finishes his glass of wine.
topics.
It’s forecasted to be the first pleasant bank holiday of the year and the Welsh countryside is crawling with locals and tourists alike, just itching for a much-anticipated glimpse of spring sunlight. The land beginning to turn green—spring green—the sort of hue that makes your eyes squint as though they’re processing color for the very first time. Families with young children run roughshod over the fledgling, mossy spaces, and couples stroll along the recently-hewn asphalt pathways, dodging puddles.
happy, just from a dinner. Just from the prospect of dashing about London with Sherlock, adrenaline pumping through his veins. God, he
“Need?” Sherlock asks, innocently, pulling out his mobile and fiddling with it as a means of distraction. “Nothing.”
“Yeah you did! Surprised with an ego like yours you’re having this much trouble accepting it. Sherlock Holmes won the fucking gold medal!” Greg shouted and gently lifted Sherlock’s arms up in the air in celebration. The crowd around them cheered once more. “Alright mate, you need to go speak with the press before you actually get that hunk of metal around your neck, think you can handle it?”
using it; there would be more accidents, right? More deaths? Or… the obvious connection, blackmail.”
John pulls it all into his lungs and feels tenuously uplifted.
Sherlock came to and bolted upright. He didn’t recognize the room he was in but that was no surprise; he’d hardly had time to get to know his own accommodations before he’d gone rushing off for the slopes. It took him a moment to get his bearings and as he turned to the right to stretch out his aching back, he caught sight of Doctor Watson.
John!”
“That’s not what you meant,” Sherlock murmured, stepping up into John’s personal space, thrilled that he was allowed to be so bold.
“A waste of time,” Sherlock does his best to grouse, as he pulls his mobile from his coat pocket.
“It is inappropriate, yes,” Sherlock pauses, glances away and then back. John feels oddly like he wants to point out that it’s a bit pot calling the kettle black, saying that John is being inappropriate. “But it is nonetheless true,” he says, spine straightening in a manner that John catches it immediately and feels the need to assuage whatever thoughts are running through Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock shrugged him off, uncomfortable with the camaraderie, and barked at Phillip to bring his skis over. He was on deck for the event, and his people immediately surrounded him, fastening and refastening his boots and getting him into his skis. His helmet came down snugly over his head, the sounds of the hut nothing but muffled white noise.
The top of the mountain was swarming with people and the skiers had been urged not to make their way up to the starting area until the prior group had finished on the course. The earliest part of the morning had seen the weaker skiers racing the course for their qualifying times, and by the time Sherlock’s group had been allowed up the snow was severely carved up, patches of brown showing through in some areas.
It was just ajar when he heard, “Oh and Sherlock,”
Once the door closed, John immediately began to speak. “So what, what do we do? This is, Sherlock this is getting out of hand. He wanted to kill you, that could have been you! That
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock frowned. “Why would you possibly want to do that again?”
John swallowed, glanced down at his hands and then met Sherlock’s eyes with a look of conviction. “I think your guy Moriarty had something to do with this.”
“Well, yes,” John concedes. This is all still so new to him, so fresh. It’s like the packaging is still on their relationship. He still gets a thrill down his spine every time Sherlock decides to kiss him, he’s still caught completely off guard by the strength of the orgasms Sherlock wrings out of him, he still stares in wonder at Sherlock asleep, wondering how this all came to be, this incredible, incandescent love. “But if not for the bed, then what?”
in his stomach.
Molly pats his arm. “Just… wait here, I won’t be a tick.”
to the heavens for Mike Stamford and then goes on checking the rest of his inbox.
Silence fell on the line and Sherlock held his breath, lingering on John’s simple declaration. Eventually Sherlock’s lip turned up into a smile, then into a grin; he wiped at his mouth with his free hand, thumb and forefinger smearing against the corner of his lips. “Good. That’s good.”
There it is, John thinks. Feels like I’ve been waiting on this for ages, and there it is. John can smell Sherlock, the sweat, the underlying cologne, the ever present woolen smell that clings to him. And the heat from Sherlock’s body feels scorching against John’s skin; he feels as though he may just combust.
There was something off about the man, about that much Sherlock was sure. But what? It was likely that he was using equipment that wasn’t to IOC code, altering his skis in some way; it was the only rational way for him to pull such fast times when he hadn’t been training as he once had. While it was Moriarty’s fourth Olympics as well and he was a seasoned skier, something about his qualifying times didn’t make sense. They kept getting
With a certain amount of disdain, Sherlock flicked the card into the bin beneath the table, snatched up the hideous flowers and put them in the hallway where room service would, with any luck, dispose of them. Every last bit of delight drained from him, leaving him feeling like a hollow husk; Sherlock threw himself onto the bed, this time out of sheer rage.
“Goodnight John,” he replied softly, one hand pressed against the wall as the door drifted shut, keeping his eyes on John all the while.
The motion soothed him and Sherlock finally found his mind settling and clearing, his focus primed.
“Yeah, yep,” Greg rolled to the side and coming to his knees he pressed into the end table. The silence in the room was filled with Greg’s increasingly exasperated voice attempting to communicate to the authorities exactly what they needed and why.
Walking was slower with John, whose gait was smaller and who seemed genuinely interested in taking in his surroundings. This was his first Olympic Games after all; it only made sense. Sherlock did his best to mind his patience, wanting to linger alongside John for as long as he was able; it was rather a novel sensation when he didn’t immediately want to break for the hotel once it was in sight.
Sherlock did as told and had a large breakfast before setting out with his team for the peak of Rosa Khutor. There was a rather tense atmosphere in the tram on the way up the mountain, the conversation sparse and terse. Everyone was still feeling the effects of Hanzu’s death and wondering what had possibly gone wrong.
He’s interrupted by their beers being placed before them with a soft thuank of glass on wood. Sherlock doesn’t turn away from John, doesn’t acknowledge the bartender, just tilts his head and waits for John to continue. Instead, John reaches for his beer and takes a short pull on it; Sherlock blinks, his eyes briefly shading into something like disappointment, before he does the same.
Running his fingers gently beneath his eyes, his thoughts wandered to John and how he was faring today - if he was feeling as awful as Sherlock was, if he’d slept, taken his painkillers, told anyone about what had happened to them. Sherlock’s mobile was in the bedroom but he resolved to take a long, scalding shower before calling. He was greasy and gritty with dried blood and his skin felt as though it’d shrunk as he slept.
exactly Sherlock was still unsure, but they’re been caught at something. He could only imagine the rumors that were circulating. He wanted to remain aloof, uncaring of what the media said about him, but he was worried, anxiously so. While he couldn’t really afford the negative press at the moment, he was more concerned how John would react, and just what they would do to him. Would they dog him down, shove cameras in his face, air every last thing they knew about him to the public?
“Holmes,” Sherlock adds, voice holding a definite note of pride.
John harrumphs. “You mean the repairs on the damage that you incurred?”
“John, there’s nothing to be done for a broken neck.” He curled his fingers around John’s own neck and held him there against his chest, gentle enough that he could break away if needed.
“What shall I do if he chooses a ridiculous restaurant? What if he chooses someplace—no, he won’t. John will choose somewhere warm and comfortable, because he’s warm and—no he’s not, he’s strong and willful and—but why can’t he be both of those things?” For a moment, Sherlock doesn’t realize that Redbeard is attempting to tug him closer to a tree.
His fingers rest against the lip of his laptop and he feels suddenly, startlingly at ease, as though sharing his exact thoughts with John had alleviated some before-unknown part of him.
