“What data?” John asked, knowing at once that she had been treating the evolution of their relationship as a case from the start. It was totally endearing, right down to the experiments she’d been conducting with her footwear.
There was a loud thud that had John on his feet, and spinning around carefully so that he was on the defensive, ready to grab his gun, instinct and training coming to the fore. Two people, John gathered from the sounds coming down the hall. Someone, a male, was shouting for another person to stop. The second person was lighter, faster, but was moving with a slightly hesitant, pained, quality. There was a scuffle in the hallway.
“John, go and get MacPherson.” Sherlock sat down, “Mycroft, get out. You will face Mummy alone and face the consequences.”
He also knew that he was quite connected with a man named James Armitage, who was wanted for several violent crimes, drug-dealing, and being a general piece of garbage. He had no doubt that this James was Victor’s drug dealer, among other things. James was a bit of a ghost in the way that spoke to people being in his pocket, and John had decided to run several things by people he knew. He still had informants, contacts, as it were, that had nothing to do with Sherlock’s Network, but who were just as reliable in their own way. If James existed anywhere, they’d find him.
John followed along. It was clear that the man was missing a few things. Clearly, the victim had had a disease that had caused this bruising pattern to intensify. Maybe she was on blood thinners. John couldn’t say anything but his brain was screaming Coumadin, Coumadin, Coumadin. He considered coughing out an answer, but chose not to do so.
Two days before they were ready to leave, a shipment came down from Sherlock’s childhood home. The moving team trudged the crates upstairs, leaving John to open them.
John had forty minutes left to go before changing out, and the man in his Belstaff appeared. “You’re a doctor. A surgeon. Rigor can be manipulated, of course, but this bruising pattern...”
John found himself looking at the world in that way from time to time, and he credited that more to MacPherson than he did Ella or even to his own willpower.
Mummy had hauled her to Brussels for half-term, but it suited Sherlock just fine. Thereby, she packed her luggage, stowed her violin, and accompanied Mummy with only token protests regarding her holiday plans. Typically, Mummy had left her to her own devices for much of their stay, as she was attending a summit. Under no circumstances was Sherlock permitted to even know that this summit was taking place.
“Dr. Watson.” The man took a sip of his own tea. In the space of a moment, his phone buzzed four times, which the man ignored, “I’m prepared to offer you a job.”
John shook his head, “Actually, it’s time for MacPherson to have a bit of postprandial playtime.” He looked to the dog who was standing at attention at his left, “Say goodnight to Uncle Myc, MacPherson.”
“Molly says that I am too polite.” Sherlock dismissed that notion with her tone’s inflection, “It would be foolish to discontinue our discourses at this juncture. I made it clear that I was married to my Work, and he became less overt. He has a brilliant mind, even if it is used in less than rational pursuits.”
Sarah did not approach the dog, but she did give him a friendly smile. “He’s much, ah, bigger, in person.”
It was, he decided, simply that he should not be here. He should be with Sherlock, wherever she was inhaling secondhand smoke, and fussing in her brisk way over her Network. He should be there, just to be there. It had nothing to do with Sarah, and everything to do with Sherlock. If she’d not been with the Network tonight, he would have never found himself in this tumult of thoughts.
Sherlock huffed, “I do wish she would dispense with the floral arrangements. They just die.” She took a look at the riot of colors in the vase, and John, though he knew nothing of flowers, knew them to be rare blooms. “Of course, Mycroft insists, the odious man.”
A dark haired woman said something sharp, and John almost imperceptibly recoiled. Lucy was quite ready to give the woman a slice of her well honed vocabulary, but she didn’t want to miss the chance to see John in his element. John smiled, a cold, chilling smile, and dismissed the woman with one or two quiet words.
Others still, were excitable and polite. These made up the majority of the comments. Molly was always sweet about things.
He worried about her, thought about her when things got quiet or he got tired. He was worried he was falling for a figment of his imagination. He’d combed the books for some indicator, some name or number scribbled in the margins, but there was nothing save the occasional critical remark written in a legible code along the edge of the occasional page, as though she could not help herself. It had taken John six weeks to crack the code she used, and each time, he hoped it would lead to her name.
MacPherson went into Sherlock’s room only long enough to turn round and come right back. He paced this way for so long that John got up to close the door between their rooms. John knew it might seem cruel to block him off, but at least the dog would have no choice but to eventually settle, and John knew that MacPherson would be happier with Sherlock.
“Sherlock…”  His tone alerted her to danger, and Sherlock’s mind filled with thoughts of Grand-mère. She was not very far from Cannes, after all, and Grand-mère was presently at her villa, which although not in Cannes itself was close enough that going there was the most direct route to her side. Sherlock had just visited her last week and assisted Grand-mère in writing down some of her latest compositions for the piano.
“How pleased I am to see you!” She carried a small shopping bag, “I’ve ordered some things to arrive for MacPherson. I just thought you should know, so as not to worry about his belongings.”
Sherlock moved away from the shelves she had clearly been browsing, laying in wait for the fly to come to the spider. “This is your medical opinion, Doctor?”
She scoffed, “The lease. You’re family, John.” She passed him the basket she held. “After I take my soothers, he may bark as loudly as he likes. I have noticed you’re very careful to be quiet in the evenings, but I want you to feel as though Baker Street is your home. You may of course bring anyone you like into it.” She continued, “Even if it is that lady doctor friend of yours.”
Sherlock’s responses were more musical than he had ever dreamed, though he did his damnedest to swallow her cries with the firm press of his lips and tongue, simply because he wanted to make the absolute most of what they had in this moment. Their pulses thundered in tandem, and John grinned as he realized that they had likely instituted a post-case ritual far more satisfying than shooting the wall, screaming at one another in hushed voices so as not to upset MacPherson, and watching crap telly.
It was then that John saw, via the lantern light, the pitiful body she was cradling in her lap, above the water. He was a waterlogged mite of a dog, who moved pitifully toward the ink-stained fingers that were gently patting his matted coat, if his patches of fur could be considered a coat.
Sherlock snapped, already striding away from the ballroom towards the lift that would take her to her room to collect her passport from the safe. “I will go to Cannes. Have Mycroft send a plane. I will—”
“Sir, the parties are gathering this way, if you’d be so kind as to follow me.” Waller spoke, a tone that was all that was polite. John saw, though, that he was being told to do just as Waller demanded.
“Yes, there are variances from dog to dog, as there are from human to human.” John prayed for patience. “They know dogs, and they they know what they’re doing. This isn’t the Friday night I planned on having.”
John put the letter away, and finished his dinner, ignoring the good-natured inquires. His mates shut up when he told them it was his sister. They didn’t know she was struggling with alcoholism, but they did know that John loved his sister. He’d never said, but it was part of him.
“Because he hasn’t got one.” John inserted, feeling very much like he had woken up in an alternate reality wherein he was some kind of captain with seven children. There was, indeed, something very fearsome about that, in that John knew in the pit of his soul that he was as alone as alone could be.
“We can’t be involved in this case, Lestrade.” Sherlock primly picked her way out of the skip, “Prior cases prevent it.”
John opened his mouth, and closed it. What did Austria have to do with anything? He had never been to Austria. This girl was not safe. And yet, she talked about this like one might talk about nits, or a flu jab.
John finished buttoning his shirt just as Molly was heading off, needing to get to the lab. MacPherson looked none the worse for wear as he sniffed the great many new scents in his home. Then again, Molly was easily one of his favorite people, and Toby was his buddy.
“Dears!” A voice broke into John’s thoughts behind his dozing eyes, “I’ve only just heard from Mycroft. I’ve brought nibbles and dry clothes.”
John told her just what he had always told families in waiting rooms, “Best leave them to their work.”
He stilled when he heard a voice in the shadows. He paused, ready to defend himself, “I’d apologize for Mummy, but I make it a point never to acknowledge her foolishness.”
John felt instantly relived. He excused himself to the bathroom, and slipped into his bedroom thereafter to slide his Browning in the back of his trousers.
Sherlock gave her name as Sarah, knowing that there could be no trace of her here. After John roused, he would be told of his young wife, and Sherlock wanted to make sure that it sounded like a fairy story. She would no sooner trap John than she would spit on the hospitality the Americans were offering him.
John again cut through the bullshit, because really, this was more than anyone should be expected to endure. He figured they could have Victor in prison for murder within the hour if he would just get done with the meaningless rants and confess. “The reason she hates him, Sherlock, is because he’s a piece of shit, and everyone knows it.”
“You had chores well before you were twelve, dearheart, and your use of chemicals was entirely recreational, as you know we insist upon natural cleansers.” Father Holmes recalled, dabbing at his face with his napkin,“Do go along and get settled in, won’t you? When you’ve unpacked, please feel free to join us in the den.”
“This one’ll come early.” Laura insisted, as she sat up again and righted herself. “You just watch, Doc.”
MacPherson was with Molly, largely because Sherlock and John both knew they were in deep. MacPherson was not allowed within a mile of this case, and they were of the opinion that if anything happened, at least the dog would be safe. “Why would you bring a dog out in this, Greg?”
“Of course.” The Landstuhl chaplain’s phone buzzed, and he looked bereft for a second before he hid it, in service to what he considered his duty, “You will excuse me, for a moment?”
Mummy, of course, noticed this, though he think her aware of what Sherlock was doing behind her back. “Is your tea acceptable, John?”
“Because I’m the only one who can keep up with you intellectually, and I run faster.” Lucy quipped, unable to help the soft smile that covered her face, “Plus, Peter’s a brainless idiot. You know it, Johnny.”
John wanted to snigger like a twelve year old boy at the good natured joking, but he paused. The look of confusion on Sherlock’s face was clear for a moment, just before her brain put together the insinuation, and she primly fiddled with her eyepiece.
Pete let food fall off of his fork as he spoke, “There's this guy who came around, not sure what to do about warning the others. Any advice?”
And…he walked right by her, unseeing, not noticing her. That absolute prat! How could he care more about making polite chat with some American political blonde? How could he do this to her? Sherlock fumed as her guide escorted her to the lifts, only to find that the APB and John boarded the same lift.
“I’ll give you my kids if you get clucky, how’s that? They’d fix you right up.”  Mike offered as they headed to the lab.
Her phone buzzed. And just like that, John was no longer her focus. He missed the intensity of her gaze as she spoke into the phone,“What? No! I forbid it. ” She hung up, muttered, “Why do they never text?”
John inclined his head. How nice to have her blessing. Now he wouldn’t have to be the least bit sneaky about pulling his fingernails out of their beds.
When they were done with the meeting and the tour of the buildings that ended in Assembly Hall, she checked her watch, and headed to the toilets to bide her time. If she reapplied lip balm, and refreshed her hair, it was merely to have something to do whilst standing in the loos. Sherlock ran through several possible openings as she stared at herself in the mirror, watching her hands smooth and twist.
Greg grinned, “Well, she never did learn a new skill by half. And if she was going to learn to be social, she decided to learn from the best. She did make a few friends, but none eclipsed Molly.”
The majority of the doors to storage units had been removed. They fanned out to search them. It was Sherlock who made a small noise from where she was searching near a pile of crates. She crouched down, and by the time John and Mycroft had made it to her side, she was bagging a tuft of hair. It looked as though it had been ripped out by the roots. There was a roll of duct tape in the detritus. Sherlock bagged that, too.
“Tom.” John smiled, greeting the man as he came out of the barn, “I’ve made it clear, and so has Nan. The Watsons have no interest in selling off. You’re wasting your breath asking.”
By the time MacPherson had fetched John, Sherlock was just at the point of needing his medical expertise. John wondered if she’d trained the dog to evaluate gunshot wounds, and laughed at the idea as he patted the animal. MacPherson was a lover, not a fighter. He was lazy, lovable, and would sooner run and jump for food than to detain a criminal. God forbid, however, they ever chased a criminal that had some kind of chicken on their person.
John was absolutely gutted that she considered that night to be the worst of her life. He could not imagine what it had been like for her, not one little bit. Somehow, he pictured her sitting at his bedside, rattling off facts that would impress upon him that he had no choice but to survive. “I’d like to hear about it. Right now, though…”
There was one person who neither simple nor pedestrian, though he was confusing and annoying in his logical application of his own form of reasoning, which did not strike her as logical at all. Sherlock narrowed her awareness and felt a calm precision settle in her mind, a parameter of sorts that sought one thing and one thing only. She had no data leading her to this cafe. Deduction had told her that it was the sort of place a young British male would think he could best blend in this city of internationals. It was neither too French, nor too British, nor too Belgian. It was a cafe suited to catering to everyone by catering to exactly no one.
He was not surprised to see John, and sent away the staff. When the door shut, enclosing him, Lestrade, and Weston, in the room, John began, “You know why we’re here?”
They stopped for lunch and to let MacPherson refresh himself when his schedule demanded a stop. They were stared at quite openly in the restaurant. Two teenage girls came up to Sherlock, who dispatched the requested advice in only the way she could do. As usual, her fans were too in awe of her to be hurt that they had just been given bad news.  The first girl had been told that her boyfriend was cheating in very frank terms. The other girl even laughed when she was warned she was being framed for stealing from the till at the shop where she worked.
John, Sherlock, and a sleepy MacPherson spent the night discussing what they had found, for there was no need to manufacture a case, only to wait. Trevor was shady and slimy, and Mrs. Scott had disappeared. Her Facebook said she had gone on holiday to Australia, but it didn’t take Sherlock’s skills in linguistics to note that she hadn’t written those posts.
Tonight was his pub night with Greg. His mates had their own schedule, but he and Greg had found over time that they met once every other week, and it was a habit they had cultivated. John started their rounds off, as it was his turn, and ensconced himself in a corner with Greg, keeping an eye on the entrance as they talked about everything and nothing for a good while.
“You’re more ridiculous than Mycroft.” John retorted as he headed towards the dining room, following the sound of Sherlock admonishing her father for overfeeding MacPherson.
This story arc is gathering steam, though, so don't be surprised if I update sooner than two months from today.
“Murray, if you’re going to be ridiculous, at least let’s agree not to slut shame. I’ve also had sex on those continents, as well. I just don’t run my mouth about it.” John gave into temptation and tore into one of the chocolates as Murray laughed, knowing full well there was no real censure in John’s tone or Murray’s teasing.
Sherlock swallowed. Finally, Grosseman spoke again, “Lastly, we are agreed that this matter, upon the advice of those involved in his care, will not be brought to the attention of Dr. Watson. We ourselves have no desire to prolong this unfortunate episode nor to derail his progress.”
“I don’t want to fuck anything up for Sherlock.” Greg blinked steadily back at John, and John understood the glaringly obvious subtext easily. “You think you know, but you cannot possibly imagine how much she loves you. It would break you.”
By the time Sherlock returned from her deduction hour and afternoon run with MacPherson, John had unpacked a rather large set of vintage Globetrotter luggage. They were clearly items that had belonged to some member of the Holmes ancestry on one side or another. They were fashioned out of leather and straps, though they were entirely pristine and their patina was free of stickers or stamps.
In his head,  John eventually ran through every bone in the body and considered a blog post about a patient he’d once had who had exploded and bone shrapnel had...
Somehow knowing that Sherlock was mere feet away, actively trying to sleep shook him and kicked his mind and his observational skills into hyperdrive. In this place, it was a side of her he had never experienced. Still, John would rather his own private torment than MacPherson’s pain.
As though they were communicating, Sherlock pulled her requisite size from the rack and added it to the pile. He looked through the pile of dresses, and put money down on the pale silk dress. He thought it was a sort of purple-blue and that was all he was going to think about it. “I think you have enough to try on. You’re going to crowd your data set.”
John didn’t care. He knew how to fight dirty. He fought, and he won, and that was all that mattered.
Sherlock tuned out most of the meeting. Whatever she needed to know, she would deduce with ease when she was in her role, and she was assured she would have a capable assistant. Sherlock let her mind focus upon what she would need to pack for her time in the Middle East, though a permanent post had yet to be selected. She might do some shopping with Molly this afternoon.
John stiffened slightly. He wasn’t sure he wanted to go back there. Sherlock just squeezed his hand as the lift opened, and she led him onward, guiding them through the wide doors onto the pavement. There was a black car stopped by the entrance, its rear door open. Mycroft himself was climbing out as they approached, and John knew this was no accident. Sherlock had, after all, summoned him for Greg’s sake.
“I just watch ‘em.” The man with undiagnosed Type II diabetes blubbered, “You’re angry at Michael. I just watch the animals a bit on the trips.”
It was this pronouncement that sent agony ripping through her body. John loved the Army. They didn’t understand, they were all stupid. The Army was John’s whole world. He helped people. He was a good man, a good man, who made a difference. He used his pain to connect with others, not build walls of ice and intellect. He was a good man, so far beyond anything they could even begin to comprehend. She wished it had been her. She would give up science, give up deduction, if it meant that he could do that which he loved and make the world a better, happier, place, just by being alive in it.
And yet, here he was, in June, wearing his bloody dress uniform, at Trooping the Colour. John wasn’t a fool. When a box lands at your front door, with an engraved invitation from the Powers that Be, you dust off your medals and report for duty. It was the Queen’s official birthday, and if someone demanded on her behalf that John be there, he was not going to question it.
John bore the delay with little grace. He did not know who her relative Sherri was, nor at the moment did he care. The date had been miserable, and John was forced to face some realizations. He liked Sarah, but the conversation over spanakopita had been banal. Nobody could have faulted its pleasantness or the companionship therein, but John found himself missing looking down at his plate and finding that a person hadn’t picked at half of it. He found himself missing the bits of crime scenes on the table, and missed not having to worry about what he said or didn’t say. He had found himself missing Sherlock, and that wasn’t fair to anyone.
“I doubt he could snap anything with his bones, but it did, somehow,” John admitted, “seem fitting.”
He was hiding himself from everyone, except from the one person who saw the world as he saw it. He was hiding everything from everyone, except the one person who saw him in the sum totality of who he was, as a person, as the only other person in the entire world who was not simple and predictable. Stepping away from where she had been covertly observing John, she made a decision on the basis of her tea break deductions.
Thusly, she had been free from Mummy’s calculating gaze as she had read a brief this morning that had been delayed by Piecroft’s inefficacy. She had just had enough time to shove away her boiled egg, dash into the shower, and join the steady flow of traffic outside the hotel. Deduction had occupied her on her journey here, her eyes flitting from person to person and deducing them in a second before moving on to the next person. People were so simple, so pedestrian.
“We don’t need money.” Sherlock blinked, standing in the doorway, “Actually, I do. I find myself in need of some items, and my credit card isn’t in my wallet. Do see if you can find it. Or leave yours out, it hardly matters.” Sherlock tucked her phone in her back pocket, “You ought to come shopping, Sarah. It’s dull. You’d enjoy it.”
Sherlock fell into step beside him, and John had the mad urge to reach for her hand. “MacPherson, come, please!”
“John, do be serious.” Sherlock insisted, “I do wish you would not waste your time reading Heyer novels.”
Sherlock was shoved into her Mind Palace. She found herself reaching out in the lift, reaching and reaching and reaching, and unable to touch John. Sherlock felt her pulse begin to race as she moved away from the lifts that were before in reality and began to rocket up the stairs, her feet pounding, brushing past a girl arguing with her parents and a couple avoiding indiscreet rumors.
Carter considered this for a long moment. “You should call it ‘The Case of Cluck’ or ‘The Clucking Case.’”
Sherlock was tense, and stepped away to have a word with Mycroft. John had observed the flurry of messages and assumed that the older Holmes had a case for his sister. John hoped he knew that like the blogger, the dog was a package deal, and if he wanted Sherlock’s help it, he would take it the way she was comfortable offering it, or not at all.
Sherlock finished deducing the waitresses, and settled on the one who was certain to possess what she required, based solely on the stating on her fingertips and the organization of her apron pockets. That done, Sherlock sipped her tepid tea, looking for all the world a absurd middle-class tourist from Leeds. She had selected this outfit with care, though of course she dressed for the case, not for her own pleasure, or she wouldn’t be wearing bloody Topshop.
John didn’t know what he was supposed to do, so he simply let the aforementioned Marsh take his measure. The horse was a beauty, glossy and ethereal. However, John saw a vulnerability in his eyes, and simply stood there, preferring to allow the horse to make the choice in their interaction.
There was movement around them as the apartment was flooded with officers. John dropped his backup, and moved across the floor, stepping carefully across notes and theories to meet Sherlock, who had flipped off the cooker and launched herself gracefully away from Victor’s corpse, as the scent of burning flesh filled Baker Street.
They had long ago released a statement that they did not want pictures of MacPherson popping up on the web, or being sold to the press. MacPherson hadn’t chosen their path, and he would not suffer for it, not when people coming up to him made him anxious from time to time. Pasting a smile on as he freed MacPherson and used his body to ruin any photos of the dog, they three headed inside to go to see Mrs. Hudson. John was keen for a bit of assurance that she would be well in their absence. Mrs. Hudson was happy to have their farewells, but seemed fixated on the traffic in only the way that someone with no pressing schedule could go on about the potentialities of sitting on the motorway for ages. The prospect of a bored Sherlock in a car was horrifying, and John hoped the traffic reports held true.
She looked up, “Sally! I keep things that might be of interest to you under the sink.” She winked at John. John knew she rarely did that, for her face squished. It was utterly adorable and endearing.
“Pity.” The man retorted, setting the picture down, “I’d thought they’d be half the fun with her. As you see, Dr. Watson, I am capable of questioning my own assumptions.”
Sherlock had nodded off once more, and so John took a long moment to stop the car and simply stare at the house on the hill. The fields were being worked by a neighbor’s son, keen for a farm of his own. Ormond Farm was not for sale, and certainly not to Tom. His son was not half as bad as the father, but John saw them as a package deal.
“You’re jealous because I’m famous.” Sherlock taunted, driving a knife right into the heart of Victor’s insecurities, “I never wanted the fame. All I wanted was my work.”
Mycroft paused, a calm tower of suppressed rage in the hum of activity around him. John’s hands ached, but his heart was heavier. He knew that this web, this ring, would be extinguished only by going to the source. As vile as he was, Michael was merely a cog in the wheel of a much larger machine. His intel had kept pouring in, and it seemed that MacPherson’s kidnapping had helped several governments to put together the puzzle pieces. They were powerless, cut off at the knees.
The first days of their stay passed slowly. Sherlock was contented to ramble around the farm. She sunned herself like a cat in the sun drenched bed they shared at the back of the house. She took small cases by Skype and email. Her brilliant mind and laser focus seemed centered on the farm. Though he knew it was a temporary shift, it was amazing to watch her brilliance shine in a new setting, especially one that held as many conflicting feelings and memories as did Ormond Farm.
“I could have contrived it without my father highlight my comparative youth.” Sherlock spat, reaching for another case, “I fail to comprehend his aims.”
What Victor did not know was that he had played right into their hand, with his facade slipping so. His phone already out, Mycroft was no doubt in the process of ordering a watch on Mr. Trevor. That saved them the trouble, really. Sometimes, deduction and the prediction of people’s actions were dead useful.
Still holding her close, John joked, “I’ve set a rather high bar in terms of present giving, I think.”
John slid in, cane first, and shut the door. The driver ignored him. John knew he could overtake the car easily. There was only one man, and he had to drive. Dispatching him would be child’s play, as would taking over the driving. How shoddy was this operation? John wanted to laugh.
John rather hoped that the case would stretch onward. He really did not want to see Mycroft looking dubiously at MacPherson. If he did, however, John decided he would take the dog to Mycroft’s wardrobe and find Mycroft’s shoes and let MacPherson have at it. He’d take the dog into Mycroft’s study and let him loll on the settee. He was very nearly to explosion with the way the older Holmes treated his sister’s dog, largely because it hurt Sherlock deeply, each glance a blow and each word a taunt. Sherlock clammed up and MacPherson recoiled away from Mycroft like the other man reminded him of his past, neither of which John could easily observe.
Sherlock nodded, “I offered to give him a sterilized needle, but he said would keep his eye out for you.” She flopped down on the sofa, cuddling up to the dog, “Do you know what this means?”
John looked away from Sherlock and back at Greg. He knew what was coming, he just hadn’t expected it be coming in this moment. John thought Greg would give Sherlock some time to retreat into her Mind Palace, to process, to think, to analyze, to plan. She needed that space, but it was clear that Greg was not prepared to offer her any of it.
John had been planning to suss out Mycroft and tell him he wasn’t going to work for him, but he did need the money, and saying no might well risk the job.
Victor stood behind Sherlock, and moved his gun to her temple. The cold metal against her pale flesh brought out the blueness of her veins, even those that clasped a knife behind her back. John blinked out a bit of morse code, and began to count to thirty in his head as he heard boots coming up the stairs under Victor’s maniacal cackling, “Oh, she tried! She tried! In New York—”
“You pulled me out of a lot of gutters and wiped a lot of vomit off of my face, John.” Harry acknowledged, “Thank you for letting me be here with you.”
Next to him on the sofa, he heard a small sigh, and the television flashed as Sarah pushed pause. John couldn’t recall what they had been watching. The woman’s expression on the telly suggested she had been right in the middle of something hectic, though. He’d not seen a movie in months, and had no idea of who the actress even was, though Sherlock did occasionally binge reality TV.
John couldn’t help the challenge in his response, “He’s the world’s only consulting canine. He was last seen 82.7 minutes ago. There are sedan tyre marks in the drive. Whoever took him used falsified NSY identification and had fabricated text messages—”
The man in the jacket advanced upon them before John could offer an apology. Lucy took charge of the situation, knowing that loads of people were staring. “Sorry about that.”
A week after MacPherson came home, they had established something of a routine. Sherlock tended to him in between experiments and cases, though she eschewed meeting with clients and instead turned to Skype, though that would last only until MacPherson found his feet. John returned to the surgery a day after MacPherson’s arrival at Baker Street, and used his lunch break at the end of the day to take the dog on a leisurely stroll to the park and to play with him. John felt it important they bond as a dyad as well as within the household.
“For fuck’s sake, Johnny,” Weston taunted, “You act as though they have souls. They’re animals with a price on their heads. I merely facilitate the desires of humans. One tiger here, one elephant there, a dozen this or that along the way, all over the world. Dead or alive, it hardly matters to me.”
“Sure.” Murray agreed, “You shouldn’t look so horrified about the idea. They don’t call you Three Continents Watson because you fuck everything that moves, John. You’re the marrying type, you just don’t know it.”
“John lived!” Sherlock retorted, “He’s alive! What more proof do you require? The fact that he smiled last Tuesday or has begun to lead peer support groups on his ward? The fact that he talked to his sister? What do you want? A cake with your picture on it? The only person who deserves commendation for John’s recovery is John, for you were content to abandon him to the vagaries of a system not designed for exceptionalities.”
They went round and round in this fashion. Sherlock wanted to deduce them all to a pile of rubble, and perhaps she did, at least to Marshall and his cronies on this panel. It was only logical that those in this room who held them in esteem understood that they were the embodiment of the issues facing the NHS and their medical community in general.
John swore a blue streak as a case went skittering down the stairs. MacPherson jolted, and dashed to Sherlock’s side from where he had been sniffing at the base of the stairs, quite interested in John’s comings and goings. He was not quite so interested in allowing a suitcase to hit him. He put one of his great paws onto her lap, and she proceeded to hold his hand, a gesture their dog found comforting.
John looked to the man, and realized that he remembered him from about six years ago, perhaps a little less. They’d been roommates at Sandhurst for a little while. “James! How are you?”
“I am not typically forthcoming.” Sherlock replied, before catching MacPherson going after her markers sneakily, “MacPherson, markers are not a sound part of a canine diet. Cease in your quest to ingest plastics and ink.”
When he woke up, John found that he had been cleared for transfer and that the second set of scans had revealed no obvious brain damage. He accepted their 'wait and see' for memories that didn't exist and wouldn't resurface. The doctors had spoken to him, but he chose not to dwell on their words. He had a mystery to solve, and that mystery was the only thing keeping him from falling into a pit of pain, despair, and self-loathing.
“There are ghosts here, John.” Greg replied, “She’s facing them for you. Don’t let her face them alone, even if you can’t see them.”
He took it off and balled it up in his bag before he reached the end of the block. He was content to leave the sharp dressing to Sherlock, as he had neither her legs nor her gravitas.
John heard Sherlock’s phone buzz. Even though she was in the middle of a case, and badgering Molly, she glanced at it. She rolled her eyes, and went back to poor Molly without missing a beat. The phone rang this time.
However, one does as one must, and she tolerated the process that marked her as an official visitor. She had long ago discerned that it was time to introduce herself to John, and if that meant attending a meeting about what she herself might do on behalf on the United Nations, she was willing to do it. After all, if things went according to her present conjectures, there was every reason she should be based in the Middle East, and she might as well go with something worthwhile to do between cases. Damn Aunt Marian for insisting she learn how to be charitable. It was something she found she valued, though of course so long as it didn’t interfere with the Work.
Sherlock rarely wanted Greek. They almost never had it. John revealed this as he rifled through the menus, providing this information so as to promote conversation. He looked up, triumphant at having found the menu in the haphazardly arranged stack, and found that there was front in Sarah’s eyes.  Ah, well, he knew how to make up for whatever gaffe he’d committed.
“Pfft.”  The Holmes patriarch countered, “Mycroft may have access to the CCTV. However, I know my little girl. It’s a shade early for this, but has built you up in that big brain of hers since she found that damn file five years ago. Fifteen year old girls, especially brilliant and misunderstood ones, who dance to music no one else may hear will do that. I will not have my Sherly broken up no matter what Mummy says on the matter.”
John stowed his cane in the back and hop-stepped into the front of her sedan. John waited until Harry pulled out of the spot they’d be using before replying, “I had mates, there, once upon a time.”
She looked dubious as he navigated the electric doors with caution, so that the cane didn’t slide out from under him on the varying floor textures, “I still think you should come and live with Clara and me for a little while.”
Sherlock said nothing as she passed the bag to Mycroft. John’s rage made him languid as they followed impressions of muddy footprints to the fire exit. In a quick glance, he saw that it had been disabled. Mycroft stepped back to finish their search.
Lucy knew how things were. She knew. She and Molly, whom she’d met at John’s sham, fake wedding with that criminal, talked about it. She knew. How could she not have known, after even that sham wedding was little more than a ode to their love? She knew that her cousin was deeply in love with that madman even when she’d gotten that stupid wedding invitation, and Molly said they were all grins and smiles now.
John took stock of himself, and found that he could not move, nor do anything to sit up. He felt like he was going to vomit, and made that plain in the only way he knew how. “Basin—” he dry heaved, trying to keep everything that was welling up inside of him from coming forth until there was a basin underneath him.
“I should have worked as a lion tamer, that’s what I ought to have done.” John muttered, “A lion taming—” John dropped the case on his foot, and hoped Mycroft was enjoying the CCTV footage. “Fuck!”
John knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if Mycroft knew any of this, he would have made the bastard disappear. Even if his bloodlust had made him miss the mark as to his reactions, John knew that Victor Trevor wouldn’t be here if any of this truth had come to light.
He’d just been out, and probably wanted attention. John engaged the dog in happy chatter, and put chicken on to sear. Sherlock was, John realized, upon quick study, testing the various compounds in MacPherson’s vitamins, if her experiments were anything to go by in deduction. He was due for the vet in a week, likely she wanted to have her list of questions ready. The poor vet had learned the hard way to just clear his morning for the three of them.
Sherlock shook her head, and John saw a bruise blooming on the side of her face, a bruise that filled him with rage. Clearly, Victor had struggled getting her into the chair, and had used more than just his boiling pot of acid to compel her. Had he kidnapped her?  “What is your aim, Trevor?”
“That’s only because there’s no room in your trousers for pockets.” Sherlock stood on shaky feet, and pressed her hands to the cast iron sink after leaving the dining room behind.
They passed the evening in companionable silence. John took MacPherson for a run, blogged, and pretended not to watch the trashy show Sherlock was decidedly not watching. He considered it a win when the bowl of ice cream he’d pressed into her hands was mindlessly consumed before MacPherson sniffed at the dish.
He considered his ploy to get Sherlock to ditch smoking a morally grey action for good. A few well placed comments about skin, hair, and nails had done the trick, as had information about how smoking distorted and dulled the senses. Sherlock Holmes would never allow for her data collection processes to become permanently impaired. John chose to say nothing of the patches she kept in every room of the flat.
She would devote herself to her work, as John had devoted himself to his own undertakings. Sherlock knew that to say hello would be to drag him into a world of seedy criminals, grasping debutantes, and female geniuses carrying absurd torches for men who, while uniquely suited to her, wanted different things of life.
John realized that he had been blaming her, but really, none of this was any more her fault than it was his. It was simply a bad situation, and blaming each other didn’t really help. “I know.”
The sweat that poured off of him helped ground him to reality. He was not a child. He was not subject to the past here. He was not here to connect with the past, but to build the future. He held, as though with worn and bleeding fingertips, to that truth.
Sherlock retreated to her Mind Palace the second she was ushered onto the plane. She visited in her way with the Doctor Watson in her mind. As ever, he was full of vigor and sparkled with intelligence. He was forever after to eat more, to move more, to drink water, to go outside, to tell people what she thought, to sleep. This time, however, she found him standing in a operating theatre in her mind, explaining all of the things that could be wrong with him. This John in her mind couldn’t be worried, for he dealt in medical facts, in statistics. He didn’t understand her terror, her fear.
“Sherlock, I’m not kidding. Sterilizing for an experiment does not count as your share of the housework.” John looked around, and saw his laptop open and active on the coffee table. She was here, then. But where was she, anyway?
And there, he found the message that allowed him to settle and face his injuries. Whoever it was, well, she would be back, to end him or save him, he knew not. In the end, perhaps a death from an assassin with a penchant for romance and devotion would be the best thing coming his way.
His first patient blustered into his office just as John had shoved his phone back in his pocket. No, he did not support the idea of explosives in the flat, not even if Sherlock used the empty bedroom upstairs. If she blew a hole in the roof, John would consider them lucky. Sherlock was not one for safety protocols.
“Already done, Doc.” Mickey replied, “She’s sending Debbie, you know her? That woman with the six grandkids and the sparkly bag that has a schnauzer on it?”
“Is that why you bound up a defenseless animal?” Sherlock seethed, going back to working on her task. She lifted the latch, and reached in to undo the side of the crate to give their dog his stolen freedom. “Was his fear too dramatic for you?”
Sherlock looked his way, the rushing water almost drowning out her words. “You want a dog. He’s interesting.”
Sherlock was not particularly interested in athletics or fitness, though of course she was perfectly capable running about London in four inch heels. He’d known it had to come from somewhere, and had pegged for her a horse mad woman from twenty paces off. However, the pictures of her with tennis rackets, hockey sticks, and lacrosse sticks around the house threw him through a loop. When the slowed to a walk, he asked, “So, you did sports at school?”
John was drying himself off and throwing on the clothes that a sneaky Sherlock had left on the toilet lid when there came a knock on the door. John heard Molly’s happy farewell to MacPherson, and MacPherson’s nails skittering on the hardwood as he accosted Sherlock, happily woofing and jumping around.
Sherlock spoke anew of the notes he had sought. “He read excerpts of my deductions and projections, and then took great pains to tell me what he would do with the information I had given him.”
“Then, and then, we got a call that you had crashed in flight, and they were rerouting you to Germany.” Greg continued, “I was the one who called Sherlock and told her that...that...”
Sherlock pressed herself against him, the darkness heightening his awareness of her touch. “Ask Lestrade.”
John gripped his paper cup of tea, the too-hot water having cooled to be tepid and tangy with the undertones of London’s water. John steeled himself. He knew what was coming would not be pleasant, not when Sherlock visibly detached herself from the world around her in self-preservation.
Lucy edged her way closer to the barrier. She was going to slide under the tape, weave towards the scene, but the same woman stopped her, “This is a crime scene!”
He had his phone out, and was likely calling his people. According to Sherlock, his team was inept, but was the only one would could be forced to work with him. John knew that, despite what Sherlock said, the team was decent. Except for Anderson. Sally was a puzzle to John. She seemed to respect Sherlock, but she called him names. John had come to the conclusion that she was jealous.
“Gregory…” Mycroft came into the room, interrupting his husband in a pained voice, “I told you they shouldn’t have met until she was at least thirty-two. But you convinced me not to interfere, and now this is what you’ve done.”
John nodded, “He has what he needs, what he wants, and there’s where his contentment is rooted. We could go to China and he’d still be as at home as we are in Baker Street.”
They exited the interrogation room, and John knew at once who had turned up the heat. Sally lingered nearby, and just before Sherlock looked her way, John saw regret and pain flash across her expressive face. However, when she spoke, it was only in her typical greeting, “Freak.”
She did not need, nor should she want, an aging ex-army Captain who was depressed and dealing with PTSD, who couldn’t bring himself to call his fucking own twin after her wife had called to say Harry was back in AA.
Of course, the evening papers were filed with news of Victor’s duplicity and his death. John was almost certain his father would be bringing some kind of spurious suit, so he left a message for their much beleaguered legal professional, and tried to keep his head down in the London crowds. He was spotted twice on the tube, and accosted in the Tesco Express. John felt that he was rather aggressively hounded for getting the milk, boneless chicken breasts, and some garlic, but what did he know?
John understood where the kid was coming from, and sent him off to make tea just as the locals pulled up in their panda. He had done something thoughtless, but he likely wasn’t in league with anyone who wanted to hurt MacPherson or wished him ill.
She appeared to be suffering from shock. John tried to put this experience together for Sarah, “I think she likes you, Sarah.”
MacPherson gave a short, sharp, bark. John by now knew what that meant. Not only did Sherlock summon him, she’d also taught the dog to do it. She said it made MacPherson feel objectively useful, but John knew better. Asking the dog to summon the blogger saved Sherlock the trouble of having to stop making deductions.
“Dr. Watson!” A rough voice, though young, grabbed his attention just before he had thrown the person to the ground. “Dr. Watson, you’ve gotta--”
“Perhaps, but…” Victor smiled, and John knew that he had just painted himself to be another hapless victim of the cruel Sherlock Holmes. He hated being allied with Victor in his mind, but this would serve them well. “Perhaps not, my friend.”
This wasn’t fun and games any more. 24 hours was questionable, 48 was intriguing, 72 was old hat, but 96 hours of continual observation was just a waste of resources. There were pensions to be paid, and if they weren’t government spooks, John would eat his hat. They had followed him to rugby yesterday, to the chemist’s, and to see Ella. He’d lost them this morning, what with spending an extra hour navigating the Tube. They’d been long gone when he went into the shop, but now they were back.
Sherlock thought of a long speech that burned on the tip of her tongue. She wanted to snap, “I have the backing of no less than five governments to stand in this spot. My father is interested in advocacy and charity, not very political true, but my older brother, well, we call him The British Government. They call him The Ice Man in America, but then you are prone to drama as a people. We Brits, on the other hand, mean what we say. Your President Obama plays golf with my father and my brother. My mother is a mathematical genius, friends, you may be told with the German Chancellor. Now.” Sherlock fantasized about snarling, “Would you care to spark an international incident? Or would you like to check again?”
Lestrade hopped out of the car and came running. A man with an umbrella followed at a more sedate pace. Umbrella Man had been around barracks a lot lately. John had heard through the grapevine that he was conducting a security assessment. John called him Umbrella Man because he never went anywhere without that thing.
Satisfied, Sherlock began to pick her way up the embankment. John kept pace beside her as she spoke. “Not Scruffy or Fido. He must have a name with meaning.” Sherlock amended, “But yes, we are agreed. I won’t hear another word about giving him away to some banal couple with jobs in finance.”
“Did Hawker drop over this morning after I left?” John asked His gum had been in a bad way, and he couldn’t imagine him not coming over, not when he knew their door was always open.
Inside, John found a logbook of exacting detail. Today alone, she had filled a page, before leaving for the hospital to commandeer the small garden for interaction with the beast.
John was sitting in a cab next to Sherlock as he forced out the words, “Does your detail normally live nearby?”
In any case, once he got out of bed, he spoke to MacPherson, filed his water bowl if it was empty, showered, dressed, walked MacPherson, came inside, interacted in varying ways with the aforementioned consulting detective with whom he shared bed and board, attempted to read the paper while MacPherson cried out at the indignity of not being given his morning paper to roll around upon, and consumed some form of carb with some form of protein with tea. The tea was a fixture, as was tracking a grumpy or energized mad genius either who was either happy or exasperated, depending on the circumstances of the day.
“Take me to bed, John.” Sherlock declared, on her feet and kicking off her jeans before John could process that she was gone from his lap and her knickers were purple, as well as being tissue cotton against his fingers.
He didn’t get it. His schedule didn’t allow for it. He barely had time to shovel a plate of food into his face at lunch. By six o’clock, John had seen his patients, set a broken bone in an emergency, sewed up a cut, taken blood samples for STD testing, cuddled two babies, and helped two patients make initial contact with social services.
They didn’t talk for a time. The streets moved past their windows, John lost in thought and unseeing.
John turned to set the dress down, and found a rack there waiting. He did not know how long Sherlock had been here, but he saw a few garments on the rack that had clearly been sorted. He added the dresses to the rack, and noted something out of the corner of his eye. Sherlock was kicking off her shoes and making yet another deduction.
John said nothing beyond assuring MacPherson that he was home, and raised his eyebrows in silent question.
“No, it was completely unacceptable.” Sherlock agreed, “I am not a joke. I am not a mooning girl. I am not a silly child running after you in a desperate bid to earn your affections. Everything I’ve ever done, I did because it was the right thing to do.”
“Well, you know older brothers.” John interjected, very much interested in the confirmation that work wasn’t going quite so effortlessly. Then again, the tension in Trevor’s brow when he checked his phone had told them enough, “They never quite do what one expects.”
John eyes narrowed. The message was received. In being invited here, it was clear that he was being welcomed into the inner circle of Holmesian confidences. Thusly, it was clear that Sherlock was trying to protect him, trying to smooth the way. She was trying to make sure that no one tried to…to change him. “Jesus.”
“I begin to think you are not as dense as Sherlock contends in her fits of pique.” Mycroft answered, “No more than six to eight weeks. I will extract you personally if I must.”
Twitter was abuzz. People and TMZ had even picked up, somehow, their absence from London. The DM was utterly certain there was an engagement on the horizon. Sherlock scoffed at the idea, and muttered, “Mummy’s got operatives everywhere.”
He couldn’t quite settle into the movie. It was almost dark and the sky seemed to be getting blacker by the second. How long did it take for a bevy of people to smoke a few packs of cigarettes? A quick mathematical run down of the situation, coupled with the average burning time, told him that Sherlock should have been home just before they’d started this movie.
John understood that Sherlock was trying to help Greg. He was the sort that needed to talk things out over a pint, and John knew that Sherlock was giving him permission to do just that with her brother-in-law. “Right now, my primary concern is for you.”
John whirled, not bothering to ask the Holmes matriarch how she had done that to him. MI-6, indeed. “Hello, Violet.”
“No, oh no.” The shopgirl smiled, “I follow your blog, you know. I just wanted to say that I enjoy it. I hope you’ll keep writing about your new dog. He’s certainly stolen a lot of hearts.”
MacPherson entered 221B Baker Street under his own power, medicated and groggy, but aware all the same of the changes in his life. After weeks in hospital, he walked into his new home with something of a patchy grooming job, wearing a collar given to him by Sherlock’s father, fashioned by whomever made his saddles. John had to admit that the giant of a dog looked quite sporting.
John didn’t really want to make conversation with anyone else who came by his post. After another fifteen minutes, it was clear that the point of his being here wasn’t going to be found in this room. John wasn’t a sitting duck, even if he was lame.
“I’m Janet, then. The only one who calls me Mrs. Murphy is Mr. Murphy when he’s in a strop.” Janet replied, “Look, as far as I’m concerned, the whole medical side of things is in your hands. You’ll get a line in our budget outside of your salary, will be expected to manage your own budget and your own practice. I’ve enough to do and I need a self-starter on this, John. Still want the job?”
“Hey, Molls.” John replied as he slid into the driver’s seat, fully expecting their discourse to pick up again. It didn’t. Once again, conversation had died upon his arrival. John wasn’t stupid. He knew something was up. He hoped it wasn’t a weird specimen or a new dog.
“Oh, how could I have done?” Sherlock cried, impatient with Greg’s emotionalism and his inability to just know, just see what was readily evident to her. “Mycroft was consumed with the middle east, and you were on the edge of promotion.” Sherlock explained, “What could I do?”
“He stole your work and you didn’t involve Lestrade?” John asked, knowing at once that the contents would have to be such that she would not want Greg to see them, nor even know that they existed.
They made short work of setting the room to rights, finishing with his work twice as quickly because James had insisted on helping him. When they finished his tasks, they headed out to the lobby together. John tried not to notice how thoughtfully James shortened his stride to compensate for his old buddy with the limp.
Mycroft fell into step beside her, “Mummy said this infatuation would pass. I note that, despite no connection between you and Dr. Watson, that it has developed.”
Harry was trying out sobriety once again, motivated by guilt and duty. She wouldn’t be able to stay sober, not that he blamed her. She hadn’t found her own reasons to dry out, and she and Mum had always been close. He’d never had that closeness with Mum, largely because he’d always felt he had to take care of her, and he’d never felt right going to her with problems when Harry did that enough for the both of them.
“I haven’t antiquated notions, Sherlock.” John replied, wondering how on earth this woman, who was brilliance and light made flesh had ever decided that he was worthy of her, “I’m simply saying that there are factors at play here that need to be openly discussed.”
“Shut up.” John barked, totally done with give this lunatic the floor, “You’re angry with Sherlock because she is a better scientist than you. She didn't waste her intellect. She has so much of it that you were enraged she could focus on anything but the lab. You were incensed because even while she had a high output, still she had a life outside the lab, when you were barely scraping by, socially and academically. You could never get a girl to go out with you and you still can’t." John didn't get a rush from sharing what he knew, preferring  to keep it close to the vest and use it, but sometimes a bit of showing off reminded criminals just who they were dealing with beyond the doctor's touch and faded jeans, "It ate you up that Sherlock, someone you deemed below you because she had innately the qualities you seek to cultivate, had someone she loved. You’re deluded if you think Barten ever thought to provide you authorship. You were expelled due to academic theft and a drug habit. You stole her work in more ways than one. Tell me, who was it that went to the committee on you? I can’t deduce it.”
John did just that, and headed back to 221b Baker Street. He fired off a text as he crossed the road:
“You’re John Watson.” Sherlock nodded, as 221B came into view, “The only person you should ever go cap in hand to is unlikely to be ever found working in the medical arena.”
The floor was rotted out in places, the window locks, where they existed, were broken. John had bigger fish to fry than the assumption that there might have been a bomb in here. Clearly, it had gone off. This place was a death trap. There was at least one person operating a brothel here, and another two drug dealers on this floor alone.
“Mycroft Holmes is not a nice lad.” Sherlock disagreed, her tone chiding and shocked, “He’s the face of everything wrong in the United Kingdom, including the fact that nobody makes decent wellies anymore.”
John was determined not to let her suffer this alone. “Sherlock.” John made short work of putting the moose in her hands, “He’s not been gone for more than two hours. Ransoms rarely, if ever, hurt their captives.”
“She cried. She sobbed. I will never forget what she said that night.” Greg whispered, “She said that she wished it had been her, that you were the very best of men, that deduction was nothing in the face of what you did to make the world a better place.” Greg visibly shuddered, “And I held her as her knees gave out from under her on that hospital floor, and she sobbed like her soul had been ripped in half, because something you loved had been taken from you.”
“You know of my brother?” Victor glanced toward John with unhidden disgust in his eyes, “I gather Sherlock’s mentioned me. How nice. I knew you cared, Sherlock. Actions speak volumes, don’t they?”
“Wait, wait.” John looked at the waif, thin and bedraggled, like someone out of Charles Dickens, if Dickens had written young man with combat boots and piercings. “Breathe.”
“I will have you know I was the best of my set. It was an experiment and nothing more.” Sherlock asserted, “I won’t have it said otherwise.”
And so, separating with a nod from her guide, Sherlock watched Captain John Watson stride confidently into his future. If she kept her Oliver Peoples firmly on her face until she and Molly were ensconced at dinner, that was no one’s concern but her own. After all, she had learned the truth. There was never any pain in the truth.
I was thrown a shower for my dog, before I got him from his previous living situation. I find them more fun than bridal showers, honestly.
“Of course not!” Sherlock interjected, her voice plainly displaying what she thought of that statement, “MacPherson doesn’t need to be stuffed under some restaurant table after the taxation of his hydrotherapy. I’ll take him, and you two can go and eat subpar food.”
His mouth was very dry. He had a strong urge to go and tie one on, and resisted it. He felt as though he had fallen back in time, and found some aspect of himself that he had left here. It was strange to feel as though he was meeting himself once again, behind the trepidation and regret. Somewhere, there was a John Hamish Watson who had come to life here on this farm, and there was some part of his soul that had never left it.
John returned the sentiment, and watched as she swanned away. It was only then that he realized that his champagne flute had been held steady in his hand the entire time she’d been next to him. John knew it didn’t have anything to do with the cost of her suit.
Rain began to fall heavily around them, the first drops barely even a prelude to the force of the oncoming rain, so quickly did it start. The rain jumped up, making him feel wetter and more miserable.
Sherlock Holmes was, whether anyone knew it, a frequent visitor to John Watson’s medical records. She occasionally visited the physiotherapy rooms, occasionally noted that there was a blond man in the pool or standing in agony at the parallel bars. She was a ghost on the edge of his vision during the months of his stay, never noticed, but always near.
Mycroft  did not move for the paramedics, and John frowned at him. Mycroft took a step back. He still had it.
“People are interested in you, old man.” John patted the dog’s fluffy body, “You can’t blame us for being cautious.”
It seemed that John too was running out of patience, though he hid it so well that only Sherlock saw it. As ever, trying to soothe his sister, as though her sobriety was his responsibility. “Harry, please don’t make a fuss of this. We knew this would be my life when I joined up, and I’m glad I did. The Army suits me.”
John ended the recording, swiping his iPhone to upload the conversation to secure servers. Following that, he sent a single text to Sherlock, who by now was no doubt listening to what had happened. Ah, the wonders of technology.
And then, and then, Sherlock’s hand was on his elbow, a gesture of support she’d deduced he’d needed. It was welcome, largely because he felt he had been kicked in the gut. He’d been home since his discharge, but he hadn’t spent any significant time here for years. And yet, nothing had changed. The front room still had the same sofa, albeit with new slipcovers, and the pictures on the wall amplified the feeling of walking into his childhood.
She hopped off of her stool, and went to a crooked mirror, hanging partly off the wall, near her front door, swinging her arms as she did so.
Footsteps raced towards him. He saw Pete and Hampton. Two more guards were rushing from their places to help. Last time someone had pushed the button, some loon had tried to rip the gun off of someone’s shoulder and had ended up on their back.
“Great.” Greg replied, hopping up into the car that had appeared as though summoned. “See you, then.”
This was the lonely, misunderstood girl for whom Mike had a soft spot? John wanted to laugh, until he realized that, yes, there was more to Sherlock Holmes that smartness and steel. Anyone who didn’t see that was a fool.
Sherlock conceded, her grin lighting up her face as thunder boomed and a flash illuminated the world around them. “Only your very ugly jumpers.”
John continued tapping away on his computer. If he got caught phone tapping, at the very least Mycroft would bail him out. He didn’t trust a tap he didn’t have some hand in executing these days, not with his insights into the government over the last year. It was getting tougher these days with advances in technology, and his lack of organized training, but he kept his finger on the pulse of things. He only wished he wasn’t trying to hunt down whoever had done this to their dog.
He’d done his Army training at Bart’s, and they were glad to have him as volunteer, even though they couldn’t offer him a job on staff as a consultant. He was considering locum work, but the idea filled John with apathy. He was trying very hard to listen to his feelings.
Harry’s sobriety would not stick if she went it alone, again. Clara was not in a position to help her, as she enabled her in the way of a loved one in a dysfunctional dynamic. Sherlock quickly added variables to her projections, and selected a new course of action with ease. She wrote yet more information on the note, and concluded with a simple directive. Harry was to call this number, posthaste. In time, Harry would assume John had done this for her, and in essence, he did deserve the credit.
John stepped aside, and let her into the space by the wide window. “You’re also addicted to your mobile.”
This attempt was typically hindered by a consulting detective who, despite her supposed lack of need for sleep, was quite cuddly in the morning. There was considerable variance in his routine in that area. John sternly focused his mind during his commute. It was hellish, and the last thing he wanted was to get papped with a goofy look on his face.
John wished he could bring Victor back from the dead just to kill him once more, and this time, slowly and painfully. Sherlock was hyper-aware of medications, really anything that would alter her perceptions. John had accepted it as her usual modus operandi. After all, if she had determined that she was in possession of the perfectly ordered mind that saw everything and lost nothing, why would she want to alter it with chemicals synthesized by some robot or some pleb in an industrial lab? Now, however, John questioned her motivations.
John snuck a look towards his bearskin. This American tourist who was plastering herself to his side wasn’t doing anything but making him want to twitch. John fleetingly wondered if diagnosing her halitosis was worth his post.
Sherlock stood, “Well, then.” She tugged down her cotton sleeve, “Mycroft, work it out. Do whatever it is you do, and have my flat debugged. Those are my conditions for now.”
She rose regally to her feet, and relinquished John’s coat to him, though he would have let her keep it. John drew on his coat, and did up the zip and the buttons, just to give Sherlock a moment she desperately needed. He made a great process out of cleaning up his refuse and pushing in his chair, as well as Sherlock’s own.
Instead, he asked, “Would you care for a mini-quiche?’ The tray was headed their way, and John would willingly have crossed the room to fetch her one and end this line of inquiry. He needed a plan, and to observe her from a distance.
Sherlock glared, shoving past the barrier. She primly directed her conversation to the dog, “MacPherson, you see, some things are constant in crime solving, chief amongst them Anderson’s idiocy. You have my permission to chew on him if you require some chewing time. The world would hardly miss…” her voice was covered by the noise of the crime scene and the sound of pandas pulling up. Sherlock had trained MacPherson for this, stealing an actual siren and other items to simulate a crime scene for their attempts at desensitization and preparation for a scene like this one.
John took one look at the drainage pipe, and knew it was going to be a tight fit. He drew a breath, and put his hand on the inside wall, reaching around himself to make sure his gun was secure. He ignored the sign that read:
John reached out to the poor gibbon who was stuffed in a dog crate sitting on some boxes, “We’re going to get you out of here, and home.”
Vernet’s close cropped hair had thinned a little in the last few years, but he was still effortlessly correct and a total ball of empathy to those who knew him well enough to get past the staid exterior. “I think you might find that will change soon.”
“He wants what you want for MacPherson.” Sherlock returned, “It seems only MacPherson and I understand that he must stay at Baker Street.”
Continue onward if you like domestic, AU, fluff, cases, etc. etc. etc. There will be a sequel. Probably like, tomorrow, or the next day. I'll link it HERE when I name it.
John knew Sherlock well enough to know that every detail of MacPherson’s life had become an experiment, but not in the way he’d thought he’d expected. Sherlock had already begun datasets to track his progress, his weight gain, the thickness of his tufty hair, and any number of factors that related to the dog’s wellness. “Sherlock is a very focused person. If we survived the H1N1 research phase, we can handle a dog.”
It tore through John like a knife on the heels of his realization. John knew most everything he could gather about Sherlock, but Sherlock didn’t even know his name. “John, actually.”
“I hardly think you need to worry about money.” Sherlock replied, “You know most of your salary will go into outfitting and supporting the clinic.”
“Oh, you know...” John began, falling in love with a mad genius, feeling guilty because her brother pays me to protect her, we spent the whole night running around London, it was better than sex, mate, and I don’t feel dead anymore, the usual, “Just looking for a flat. I can’t imagine finding something decent, though, let alone someone willingly living with me.”
“Dr. Watson.” The other man broke first, and it was a thrill to John to know that the bullet and the pain hadn’t stolen quite all of his mettle.
John picked up his bag. It was the only thing that marked him as military, and Sherlock knew in her bones that much of what he was doing was a cover for something bigger in service to his country. It infuriated her. Why should John risk himself? Why, when he was unique amongst all people and there were hundreds of other idiots who were hopped up on patriotism? Why did they deserve the very best the world had to offer?
That was clearly not the thing to say to a young woman so convinced that she was right and everyone else was killing their earth with consumerist habits and carnivorous diets. Within weeks, she’d be paleo or Ducan. Sherlock had gone right for her jugular, and focused on the fears that had made her seek out a rigid way of being, so rigid that she refused to even see her family because they did not live a zero waste lifestyle.
“You’re admitting,” Greg spoke slowly, “to a member of New Scotland Yard, that you stole MacPherson with the intention of making him a show animal in America?”
The dream he’d been having was reality. He opened his eyes to find that the sun was peeking through the window, and that MacPherson was lounging on the sofa in the corner. For his part, John had his arms wrapped around Sherlock’s body, her slim frame pressed to his own. Carefully, hating himself, John extricated his hold, and freed his feet from the tangle of sheets and blankets. It took him a long moment, because he was loathe to interrupt her slumber, something she found so rarely. He was also, he knew, loathe to let go.
John finished up, and with a smile at Sarah, headed to 221B. He couldn’t get a taxi, and so he decided to, now that he could once again, make the walk home. The phone box near the Chicken Cottage rang.
“Could you spare a solider a bag or two?” Sherlock hated playing on people’s sentimental dehumanization of their armed forces, but for John she would stop at nothing to ease the pace of his thoughts and isolation.
“Hope is a thing with feathers.” James returned, “Bit of a daft thing to say, I know, but it comes in its own time. It’s not something to rush.”
“She retired, Sherlock. You grew up, went to Uni.” John realized that this man was none other than Gavin, Geoff, Greg Lestrade, partner of Mycroft Holmes. There was some soothing note in his voice that John understood. For all her bluster, Sherlock Holmes felt deeply. Those who knew her best seemed to be telling John that, from her mother, to her brother, to her brother’s husband.
He must have stood there like a gaping fish, until he heard Sherlock say, “John.” Her eyes were confused, until he blinked twice. Then she said, “Coffee.”
Sherlock had already shoved her phone in his face, knocking his own to the floor. “Was it this man?”
On the third day of such coverage, Sherlock created a remarkable blaze in the kitchen sink. John came into the main room to see flames popping in the sink, and cried out, “Jesus Christ, Sherlock!”
John was so tired. He just wanted to sleep but his head was pounding and he…something was wrong. Something was not right. John sucked in air, and the voice was again demanding, “Open your eyes, Captain. You’re in the hospital, you’re safe.”
John got out of the car as Sherlock opened her own door. Nan’s greetings were practical, but John saw the warmth in her eyes and felt it in her hug. She concluded her hellos and how are you’s with, “Well, that was a long drive, wasn’t it? Come along, then. I’ve put on tea.”
Silently, he took a set of keys out of his pocket. The locks at Baker Street had all been changed, though John knew he would be checking every window and and lock himself. “Do try not to destroy the stove this time. The restoration expert had to be brought around with smelling salts and a considerable bonus.”
Quickly, the nurse got about her business, helped him to raise the head of the bed enough to hand him a basin. John had nothing in his stomach, but the bile that arose from the pit of his system was disgusting. John knew he had been heavily medicated, simply from the scent of the bile, not that it took and MD and a PhD to figure out that the banged up guy in the hospital bed was on some shit.
The game was afoot, and rather than make one up, Victor Trevor had led them right to it. Whether or not they were playing into his hand was immaterial. In the end, Victor would be unmasked, Sherlock would have her Work, and John would have made plain to Victor that one did not harass uninterested women, let alone teenage girls. He would prove to Sherlock that she didn’t need to stand alone unless she chose, that she had her blogger by her side.
“Well, I was going to tell you about a List-Serv Molly was nattering on about earlier today, but now I’m just going to tell you that your fragile grasp of your own masculinity is not becoming.” Sherlock’s eyes glinted, and she looked every inch the warrior queen the press made her out to be when she shoved away so hard that John had to blink as she strode off, collected the dog, and threw the tennis ball at his head.
Sherlock read obsessively on her phone for good portions of the drive. He figured she was studying up on something relevant to a case, though of course Sherlock Holmes never studied. She researched. The distinction was large, and woe unto him should he forget it.
It was just that to Victor. He fired shots without thought and consideration, killed anything that moved. He’d unflinchingly pushed off illegal kills onto other hunters in the party. He moaned about ear protection, moaned about everything, really. John had observed an endorphin rush in him way outside of the range of normal responses to hunting. His instincts were confirmed. John wondered if he was overreacting when he decided he was staring at a killer. Mrs. Scott could well be alive, and so John withheld that conclusion.
“I wouldn’t risk you, either, Sherlock.” John affirmed, “Not you, not MacPherson, not the Work, not even the severed head in the fridge.”
“Holmeses do not frizz, John.” Sherlock sniffed, brushing her fingers against his own as she plucked the wooden bristled brush from his grasp. He imagined her lingering for a long second, as though she had just given him an opportunity to take her hand.
Sherlock’s teeth clenched together. “By my calculations, MacPherson will be released Saturday. It is Thursday. Preparations must be made, and as he cannot manage stairs, his recuperation space will be in my bedroom.” She sighed heavily, “One cannot have a medically fragile animal in anything less than pristine surroundings.”
John did not trust his rabbiting heart. He had thought of her quite a bit, and not just in a sexual way, which just told him that he needed to get out there and chat up a teacher or a fellow doctor or someone out for a bit of fun down the pub. He’d tried to text a friend or something, but it had been a pointless thought, one he’d lost as soon as her eyes had flashed over his mind. He was happier staying in, knowing his surveillance unit was sitting out in a car in the summer’s heat, wasting time and petrol, watching him do absolutely nothing.
Smiling tightly at Father Holmes, who had been endeavoring to discuss some sort of painting he was doing with John as the elderly man shared MacPherson’s attentions with his wife, Jon rose. MacPherson did not follow him as he moved closer to the corridor, and the closed door. The dog, ever a ham, soaked up the affection as his due, his massive tail thumping against the patterned rug with glee.
John could not place a Wilhelmina. She pronounced it in the German fashion, and nothing about the name jogged anything in John’s mind. He thought fleetingly of his friend who sent him books, but although this woman was fluent in German, it was not her native language. He rejected that possibility, knowing that his mind was focused thereon because he just wanted to go read her notes in the margins of
Sherlock breezed easily from the cafe to meet Mummy back at the hotel, wishing she could have stayed to see some of the tension bleed from John’s body as he sipped at that insipid, tasteless brew. She hoped her note brought him some solace. In her most nondescript hand, she had written:
He allowed Laura to listen for a long moment. She had found precious little joy in this pregnancy, and whatever he could do to help her connect with this baby was something he was prepared to facilitate. John had a lot of obstetric cases. Something about people wanting the best they could provide for their children had them stepping forward for help despite fear and pain.
John shook his head to chase away thoughts of Gramps. He had been the reason John had made peace with his choice to join up. He had served in WWII, and on his few visits home, Gramps had been the only one not to ask questions John could not answer. Often in those silences, Gramps had given him answers he’d never known he was seeking, just with the simple filling of a glass and a knowing glance.
Sherlock stared over the top of the insipid magazine that allowed her to look like a fellow traveler. John hadn’t wanted Harry to come along today, but she was trying out sobriety once again. It wouldn’t stick, Sherlock knew, but the deeper motivation here was clear to her, just as it was clear to John. Harriet didn’t feel that a solider should have no one to see them off, even if their mother had died, their Grandmother was aged, and their father had absconded.
This entire chapter is born out of one bit of dialogue in the first chapter. Father Holmes tells John...
John put away his phone. He was certain of what the incoming text said when it buzzed in his pocket. He waved at the CCTV camera, and went on his way.
“I just want to know what you care to tell me.” John refused her offer. Really, he didn’t feel any need to invade her privacy. She had grown, changed, and though he was glad to know anything she felt she wanted to share, it was important to him that it came from her.
Once back in the corridor, Sherlock found that the water on her hands refused to dry. Holmeses did not perspire. To suggest that her palms were slick or that her knees were knocking was the height of absurdity. It was the shoddy atmospheric conditions in this building, which was probably overpacked with gawking tourists bent on conspiracy theories that had no basis in rational truth.
Sherlock shook her head, “This is not a conflict of interest. As a professional, I am coming to you with observations regarding a patient in your care. I have reason to believe that John would benefit from an alternate modality of treatment. You fail to recognize that John is a caregiver, a protector, a man of his word. He feels that he is not a man, not a person, any longer. You must impress upon him that there is a world beyond what he knows, that there is a world waiting for him.”
John sighed as MacPherson corrected himself. This trip was off to a lovely start. MacPherson had left a hostess gift on his Nan’s shoes. John ate his cake.
Lies, all lies. However, it bought them time to get the whole story explained. John merely shrugged as best as he could, cuffed loosely as he was, “We’ve been working on a tangental case. Several parties have been interested in security at the bank where she worked. Her name came up.”
John watched emotions, sensations, dance across Sherlock’s expressive face. He wondered how he could have ever thought her dispassionate or closed off from the world. Her body was as warm and magical as her soul, and fought with his control to have this moment with her as she was, in her brilliance and wonder. She was electricity personified, even when she breathlessly scolded him for thinking too much. He had no way of telling her that the only thing he was thinking about was the way she wasn’t cataloging her physical and physiological responses to his touch, the way she had thrown herself fully into feeling and being entirely in this moment with him. He had no way of finding the words to describe to the textures of her skin against him.
John’s head swam with the image in his mind of someone who knew enough classical Greek to recite poetry from memory. He couldn’t put any of this together, and he was fighting to keep his eyes open as Chaplain Parker left the room. Soon he was out cold on another medicated sleep, list clutched in his hand, his palm itching like the morse code was still being tapped out there.
MacPherson cried, pitifully whining sounds that were pulled from the pit of his soul. It ripped John in half. The scant moments he stopped crying to pant nervously were hellish in their own way, because he was close enough to hear Sherlock shifting restlessly in her bed, close enough to hear her when she exhaled deeply. It did not take much to keep tempo with the pace of her breathing.
“When someone we love enters our lives, John, it can ask us to reflect upon them.” Mrs. Hudson sat down to her own repast, though far lighter than his own plate, “Why, just look at you and Sherlock.”
Mummy and MacPherson made their way into the parlor, and John considered calling him back to him as the pair ahead of him disappeared into the parlor. The dog was either with him or with Sherlock, universally. She did not let her Network watch him, and she refused to hire out so much as a dog walker. Rather than risk his head, John followed along, wondering where Sherlock had loped off to that she had not taken MacPherson.
John merely gestured forward as Sherlock shoved her way through the door. Greg was already coming up the side of the wide building in the fading light. Darkness was beginning to fall around them, and it stood to reason that MacPherson had been moved. John was not going to let his mind articulate what had been done with that tape.
John wanted to blink. He didn’t. That was rather new, but at least he had a name for The Man. John had long ago come to know that Sherlock only came when John was on guard duty, unless someone new was available to deduce. Now if he could only figure out Umbrella Man’s name, his curiosity would be at rest.
The beefy man, weak as a walrus, nodded as John drove him easily to his knees on the floor, “I don’t want no drama.”
John had spent time working with refugees and asylum seekers before, both here and in the Army. He knew what he was facing, and  was undaunted. John knew that a great many of his patients would come from word of mouth, once the Network spread the word.
“I’m not back in.” He dealt a swift blow to her hopes. “I need information.” John sipped his coffee from Speedy’s, looking for all the world as a normal Londoner.
“Dehydration promotes wrinkling, too.” John noted, “It’s why people who smoke and drink too much tea and coffee tend to have skin like leather.”
Finally, after another ten minutes, some tourist screamed, “Oi! Fucking get away from him, you tosser! He can’t talk!” The man’s broad country tones, deeply Lancastrian, made John want to smile.
John replied in the affirmative, and texted an old friend who was based in Glasgow. They’d keep an eye on things. John had no doubt they’d want a ransom. He was prepared for a phone call to that end. Sherlock, however, when he came into the room had left behind Carter as suitable prey and was rattling off deductions and statements in English, French, and interestingly, Farsi.
It seemed, somehow, that MacPherson knew he was home. John set down the leash on the table, clean for MacPherson’s homecoming but soon to be covered anew with experiments, and sat down on the couch with the dog, whose pleading gaze had settled on his face.
“In other words, naturally.” Greg admitted, “She said it behooved her to learn various soft skills for the Work, for cases, but it wasn’t hard to discern that she was taking a scientific approach towards learning to get out of her shell a bit.”
John paid for the milk and biscuits in cash, and headed home, avoiding eye contact with the Baker Street memorabilia now stocked in the shop.
“There’s that British humor.” The man snarked, as he turned and walked away, John watching his every move.
“The nurses told me later that her voice was magical.” Greg’s voice was clogged with tears, “And then when Mycroft tried, in his own way, to break the news that you would live, she said nothing. She simply refused to let you die. When he told her that you would be discharged, that you would never be a trauma surgeon again, she…”
Sherlock was not chastened, nor had the man’s tone intended to chastise her. He teased her with the ease of the man who had placed her on the back of her first pony, and helped her find her way in life in more ways than one. John thereby extended his hand, “John Watson.”
John could see the edges of a confused moue pulling at the corners of Sherlock’s mouth. “I wish to know how you arrived at that conclusion.”
He knew they were speaking in a code for which he did not have the cipher. Flying blind in yet another God damned mission, like within Africa, in the Balkans, in Ireland, and other continents, regions, and countries he’d been in and out so fast that the name hadn’t quite stuck.
“Bet that goes over well in the Officers Mess.” Sherlock twitched with pain, and his legs began to shake. Blood loss, then. Shit. Internal bleed. Fuck.
“Come on, mate.” John sat up again, his leg stuck under the weight of the dog, “You’ve got your moose, and your bed, and your blankets.”
“Sun care is—” John began, wishing anew that he could make her slather herself in 75 SPF and wear a hat at all times.
Sherlock hefted her box, and shoved it at her brother, who took it up with something of a shocked look on his face. He smoothed it away after a second. After all, his nanny had raised a gentleman. “I achieved my aims regarding this venture, and it drew to a close.”
“I can’t think why.” Sarah’s eyes sparkled, though she seemed uneasy. He supposed the fact that he found Sherlock’s gaze to be warm and curious, rather than cold and evaluative, spoke to his own penchants and his own bias towards his flatmate. He knew who she was, but somehow, Sarah’s body language in this moment was offensive to him on a deep level. There was no cause to recoil like that, imperceptible though it might appear to him. He knew Sherlock saw it.
Sherlock raced off on a tear around the unit, heading with unashamed haste to John’s psychologist. He was an idiot, but he could take action over time to actually help John. Pausing in front of the man’s office, Sherlock tucked her hair back, smoothed down her blazer, and knocked on the door.
Sherlock laughed all the harder, and John bit his lip, brushing away tears of laughter from her eyes,
“Oh, John.” Sherlock stated as she pinned up locks of hair that had fallen from her nape, “Do not pander to Giles’s delusions.”
John glanced at Mike as their fingers brushed, “Ah, Sherlock, this is John Watson, an old mate of mine. He was a doctor in the Army. I uh, told him you need a flat share.”
The nurse rose. “I’ll escort you back myself. He’s going for surgery soon.” Sherlock noted that she did not say that if he survived that one, that there would be several others when he went home. The object of Landstuhl was to stabilize John and ship him off with their good wishes.
Fifteen. Fifteen and five. What the everlasting hell? Sherlock was young enough to still be in Uni. What had happened? She was brilliant, with a mind made for deep thinking. A university might stifle her, but it was also a place he’d bet she’d love if left to explore her own mind rather than what some tutor told her she needed to know.
John chuckled. She’d made the deduction first because Mr. McGowan had allowed it. John blinked, “Where’s MacPherson?”
Sherlock reached over the seats to unbuckle MacPherson, and reminded him gently, “Be gentle with the terrier, MacPherson.”
“Mrs. H...” John looked over at Sherlock. Organizing her Mind Palace, no doubt building a doghouse out back for MacPherson.
Sherlock’s rare smile was crooked and unguarded as she put the napkin in her lap and caught a glimpse of MacPherson. John’s heart skipped a beat just as Mycroft choked on his wine.
“Tessa’s back from maternity leave, John.” Sarah reminded him, her resolve overriding her genuine concern for him, “When she’s settled, we’re going to have to evaluate the feasibility of keeping you on as often as you are now.”
“You’re not going to put him in dresses!” John spluttered, as Sherlock shoved a few hangers his way. He accepted the various garments with trepidation, noting that another shopper was staring blatantly, “Sherlock…”
“Doc, Timothy was last week.” Laura declared, wiping the gel off of her stomach as John continued on with her examination. She was coping with gestational diabetes, and so her pregnancy needed to be closely monitored. “I’m still trying out names for him. I’m thinking Marcus this week. What do you say?”
“Good!” Mike said, as he had for more than the fourteen years John had known him, “What are you up to?”
He wanted her be as free an unfettered to do as she wished as possible, within the the laws of the UK and the Geneva Convention, and he rather saw friendship as supporting that desire. He wanted for her to want what she wanted, and for himself, he wanted to support her goals if she, and only if she herself, asked.
“I do not care to discuss family matters in public.” Mycroft elaborated, clearly having already had Sherlock’s hacked medical file brought to his attention, “You and the canine will get in this vehicle, and you and I will be having a chat about my twenty-one year old sister’s whereabouts.”
The Granny in the waiting room was looking at him with wide eyes. John returned her stare boldly, even as he draped a warm jumper over Sherlock’s thin frame.
John made his way to work, ignoring the looks of the nurses, and the radio coverage he’d overhead that were going on about the sexual compatibility of a woman in her early twenties and a man in his thirties. John had pretended not to notice anything around him, and looked to Sarah, “Busy morning, I suspect.”
It was, to some small-minded pie-lovers, illogical to call a man she had never met her friend. And yet, she would now do so without a single doubt in her mind. She knew things about John Hamish Watson he did not know of himself, and she accepted them. She accepted them, and she accepted that solely his presence in their shared universe meant that they neither of them were alone. There was another person, out there, somewhere, who had a similar brain chemistry and structure. Though they each walked their own paths in terms of application, she deduced that he would understand her as she understood him.
“Mummy,” Father came into the room, clearly having been playing the host, overjoyed at having some of his children home once again, “I’ve just got off the phone with Martha.” Looking at John, he added, “She’s pleased to know you’ve arrived safely. I’ve invited her up, but she’s of a mind to have a holiday at home.”
The nurse nodded, but Sherlock didn’t see it. She simply stared at John, and began to tell him of his medical condition. She ran out of things to say there, and tried to think of something to say. She had nothing to say. She wanted to scream, to cry, to mourn this pain, but she owed John the strength he had shown at their last meeting.
“Sarah Watson.” Sherlock blurted, too rattled and too focused to school her voice in a flat American accent that sounded vaguely Northeastern, the nondescript toneless accent that was all over American television.
John did not ask how long, or what the man meant. He knew that the questions were visible no matter how hard he tried to hide it. “I am the second son of a minor member of the peerage.”
“If I wanted to barter you off, I would have compelled you to stay in Vienna, or perhaps New York.” Mycroft’s smooth tones did nothing to settle his sister. “I was merely getting to know Dr. Watson. You cannot blame me for it.”
Harry had counted on him to make all the arrangements, him to bury their mother and comfort Nan and Gramps, who’d just buried their only child. She’d let him settle Mum’s affairs, him be the one to decide to pull the plug on his own fucking mother. The goddamned nurse had called him doctor when he’d done what was required, when he’d just wanted to scream at his sister that Elspeth had been his mother, too. He still wanted curl up in a ball because he’d watched his mother die. Harry had been allowed to cry. John had held a fucking stethoscope in his hands, because it was easier for Harry, because she counted on him, not some stranger.
John wondered why on earth they were shopping when there was a case. Just like eating and sleeping, shopping took a back seat to the case. There had been a time in Blackpool that she’d purchased something, claiming it was for the case, even though John knew better. Such was the risk of having a thief in jewelry stores. “There was a case this morning, I thought.”
Sherlock submitted far too willingly to their detainment. Clearly, her protest had been for their observers. John yanked Greg close when he cuffed him, “Check for cameras around the body. Say nothing if you find them.”
“Nobody says that like you do, Lucy, with such vehemence.” John rocked back on his feet, preparing to grab the phone away. He was such a good soul, who needed to stop being so trusting. He trusted his sister, and she pawned her crappy old mobiles on him. He trusted a blonde criminal, and she fake married him and almost killed his lover. Thank God that wedding was never legal.
John glanced behind him and saw Sherlock sliding on a sweater. Modesty around Sarah confused him, but who was he to remark on something like that? “Sarah, what a surprise!”
Sherlock swanned out of the bathroom, muttering to herself about a lack of conditioners on offer in decontaminating showers. John called out, “Communication is very important, you know!”
“What?” Sherlock asked, distracted as her attention was on the dog, who was rummaging through his toy chest to put as many toys as he might into his large but finite mouth, “Cats are not liquid, John. Do be serious.”
“Basically.” Greg agreed, rising and adjusting his own coat and scarf, “He sent you that invitation to Trooping the Colour. Sherlock went ballistic. She said we were forcing you when you were vulnerable. She never once manipulated your free will, though I will admit she did…arrange a few things in your life to her satisfaction.”
It took John a minute to remember whereabouts he had been in that year in the autumn. He thought it the time he’d spent dashing around Iraq and Afghanistan on clandestine operations, sometimes sewing people up, sometimes doing the exact opposite.
Sherlock’s breath tickled John’s ear. “How is that any alteration from your normal orientation? I’m well, John.”
John thought as quickly as he could, though it took him a moment to get out the slurred words. “Was there anyone she did talk to that's here?”
Just as he was about to demand information, Waller took a step back, allowing John to take the lead, “Here we are, Captain. Please do make yourself comfortable, and if you should need anything, we’re happy to assist you.”
Greg never asked for Sherlock’s deductions in such a way, but he knew what he was on about, for it almost blindly clear that Victor Trevor had planted cameras in the area, like a murderer watching over his kill. Sherlock nodded, and met Greg’s eye. “The killer is James Armitage. The victim’s name is Gloria Scott. She discovered that he was engaged in shady money laundering practices, and he killed her. Would you like more? Even Anderson could find the killer with his name.”
He said the last like a proud schoolboy, shooting a look at John, obviously expecting fond praise. It warmed the cold recesses of her soul.
Sherlock read John in an instant, and made a decision. She grabbed his arm and hauled him off into the garden, gravel crunching beneath their shoes as John accepted his fate. It would be useless to splutter and protest, and even more asinine to ask where she was taking him. He’d scoped out the place, and he knew as well as she did that they were headed beyond the range of the surveillance system.
“I’d just popped by to see if you wanted to go to dinner, actually.” Sarah returned, “But I’d hate for you to waste your chicken. Some other time.”
She sailed to the door, as though a man had not been sprawled there a scant five moments before. She paused, after crossing the threshold, “John, are you coming, or are you going to stare at those biscuits all day?”
MacPherson placed his paws upon Sherlock’s knees, and she gently guided him off of her jeans, so that he was sitting next to her, his craggy head butting her hand for pets. John’s mouth dried as he considered the meanings of what she was saying.
“I’m just sorry he's a deal breaker for you.” John replied, knowing full well that this was not something Sarah wanted to work on with him. He said it plainly to spare her having to do so.
John eyed her skeptically. “If you go and try to kill yourself to avoid dealing with your apartment being searched, I’m dumping you at the A&E.”
John shoved his waffle container at the boy, who dropped it into the bin. He seemed to consider his words, as though he needed to explain himself, “But, but I swear I was only looking out for her. She’s been good to me. Never asks for anything finky.”
“Sherlock…” John winced, hoping against reality that the poor woman cleaning the walls and floors and windows of Sherlock’s bare room had not heard them despite Sherlock’s raised voice at salient moments, “It isn’t fair to call someone an imbecile because you’re…” John fumbled for a word that wouldn’t incite ire, “…massively keen.”
“Me!” Sherlock blurted, looking at him directly, “Have you lost your mind? I outed a spy, John, in a theatre of war! I calculated new projections every day that went by, projections that assured me I had been the author of your death.”
Sherlock insisted on staying on the boat with MacPherson. It was a close thing, but in the end her fierce desire to protect MacPherson won out over her desire for vengeance. Mycroft stayed behind to help the requisite authorities work out how to return stolen animals to their homes and habitats.
The flypast was over, the Royals had waved and looked suitably royal and commanding, and the whole thing was done. John had wasted his whole day. If Ella ever heard him say that, she would drop to the floor in a faint, but it was true. John wouldn’t work to rouse her, because she’d only want to explore his feelings.
“Oh, like you do.” The man was near to pissing himself in fear, but his loathing for woman rose to bolster him.
“Mycroft got a phone call when you were shot.” Greg revealed, “We waited. We were certain you were going to die, and Sherlock was in fucking Vienna. I had watched her grow into herself, grow more confident, grow into a young woman, and I knew that your loss would decimate her.”
Sherlock spun around in a wide circle, her arms thrown out to balance herself as her skirt twirled and the dog jumped around, as if to ask, “What’s to stop you from coming here?”
“Three continents in one day in some kind of life saving surgical record…” Murray omitted the details purposefully to try and rile John, stole a crossword book, and wandered jauntily towards the doorway that led into the surgery space, “Still think you shouldn’t have told me the truth. I liked you better when I thought you were a whore.”
“I have a case!” Sherlock drew her phone closer to her body,  “I cannot be bothered with something as banal as your desire for granite countertops and wainscoting.”
John rolled his eyes as the vet squeezed past him, a focused look in her eyes as she put her hands in place of his. The expression on the professional’s face was known to him, as it was the expression he’d seen too many times on his own face. She was thinking, “How do I tell these people that no matter what I do, their loved one will die?”
Sherlock knew that his injuries were significant if those overseeing his care decided to call upon Americans to provide him care until he was stable enough to go back to the UK. The time between this place in Germany and UK soil was small, but meaningful. It could mean his life. John would not want to die anywhere but her arms. He did not know this in his waking mind, but she was the world’s foremost expert in deduction, and she knew it enough for both of them.
texts. Instead of a dirty alleyway or a locked room, the cab dropped him off at Selfridges’ and he found Sherlock, not in the back working on some case, but on the second floor.
Sherlock downed a pint of water standing by the fridge, her slim ankles on display as they emerged from Sweaty Betty leggings and disappeared into trainers. MacPherson had already darted for a few laps from his own water bowl and begun to hop around the sitting room.
“Oh would you both—” Sherlock’s phone began to buzz, and she looked at it carefully before tilting the screen towards John before answering. It was Victor, calling again as he had done several times a day in the last several days.
His voice echoed as he continued onward, calling her name occasionally when he deemed it prudent, his body brushing against sediment that had built up along the narrow passage. The darkness almost helped, in that it hid just how small this space truly was in comparison to his body. He wondered how someone had dumped a body down one of these things.
She was happier than he had ever seen her. She had a continual source of change and an ever complex puzzle in the form of MacPherson, a puzzle and a changer that never seemed to bore her or annoy her in the way that people did on a regular basis. Everything MacPherson was scientific and wonderful, at least as best he could gather from Sherlock’s monologues about the dog.
Cup passibly consumed, John rose. Sherlock had long ago slipped away, and he was curious as to her whereabouts. Though he enjoyed visiting with Mummy and Father, he found it best to limit time spent in Mycroft’s company, if only to avoid getting drawn into sibling squabbles. “If you’ll excuse me…”
He glanced back at his flatmate. “It appears we’ve acquired a dog. I know the lease—” He didn’t know exactly how to approach this, because the fact that they lived at Baker Street and now had a dog were immutable facts to Sherlock. He didn’t fancy living on the street, or worse, in the Holmes house, after losing their flat. He somehow knew the flat would go before the dog.
Who had seen that he had gotten an invite? He’d been introduced to the Queen a time or two, but John doubted the woman remembered him. What was there to recall? The summons from the Lord Chamberlin set John on edge, and made him aware that there was more at play than he could presently observe.
Every once and a while, a new package would arrive. John got something of a reputation for his packages, and this one was slightly more accurate. People came to him for a bit of home, and John was pleased to offer what he might, knowing that it was a critical component of medical care. He did his best to thank his benefactor in various ways, but countless pleas for information and letters of introduction were never delivered, or answered.
John knew Debbie, but he did not want to get drawn into an hour’s worth of conversation with Mickey about everything under the sun. Mickey was one to talk, and talk, and talk. John had been tempted to thank Sherlock on the many occasions she’d told him in no uncertain terms to be quiet, but poor Mickey was a bit afraid of Sherlock. Well, that, or bowled over by her. John knew it to be both, and hardly blamed the kid. Sherlock would have terrified him at Mickey’s age.
Carol clearly considered this important. She sat down on the visitors’ chair in his room, and began to explain, “She introduced herself as Sarah Watson. She’s very pretty, in a striking sort of way.” Carol thought better of discussing her looks, likely assuming that like most people, John had a photograph of the person he was supposedly married to somewhere, “She’s got a voice like an angel. Sang to you, sat by your bedside, recited poetry in a very soft voice, but I can see why she captivated you. Mostly, she was just quiet. We gave her as much privacy as we could, but the ward had to be closed.”
Mycroft’s eyebrows rose, as he looked to John with something knowing and vaguely terrified in his eyes.
With a winning smile, Sherlock left John behind to her mother’s clutches as she swanned away. Mummy came to the doorway just as Father Holmes led him indoors, chatting on about the journey. John, quick to do as he was told, came out of the chill and removed his coat. Father Holmes himself took the coat, going on that Jane and Tom were away, regrettably.
John couldn’t possibly imagine those circumstances, not for a moment. It would probably be a hell unlike any other, to know that there were a million thoughts in her brain, but none were able to come out. He’d put patients on midazolam before surgery as a comfort measure, and they mostly blinked, leaned into comforting voices and touches. John had never spared a thought for their thoughts, beyond assuring them both that all would be well when they woke and they wouldn’t remember a thing. John couldn’t believe that he had ever thought that a comfort. Sure, it had wonderful uses for seizures, insomnia, and in end of life care, but it could also be used in executions.
Sherlock said nothing. She saw everything. She memorized every bruise, every scrape, every break, every swell. She considered getting as close as she could, but she thought that might be permission for him to go, and he had to stay. He had to stay, and they would fight this, everything, all of it, together. Any potentiality could be overcome, so long as he lived. So long as he lived, there was nothing he could not do.
John disagreed as they met on his side of the car, MacPherson sniffing with great whooshes of chilly country air, “I think he knows when you’re in the Mind Palace.”
Sherlock did not answer, as she was exiting the room. John decided that she had finally read her father’s text.
“Nor a cat.” John chortled, turning around to see MacPherson trying to tap dance his way into fitting into the open suitcase on the floor. It was a medium case, and nowhere large enough to allow the dog to lay down in it, though he was determined to try.
Sherlock rolled her eyes and put down the blue dress. “You picked the bittersweet dress, John. Must we review my post on the 600 basic colors and shades therein?”
“I was not the one in danger at the time, John.” Sherlock returned. Underneath their banter, John was quickly and carefully decoding what she was saying, though he was having very little luck in contextualizing it. He knew that she was referencing the danger of his work, and had one question he needed to put to rest. “Please tell me you weren’t in an active war zone.”
The voice on the other end of the line said, “Yes. Right then. Hello.” The voice was male. Harrow educated like Mycroft, unless John missed his guess. “You must be the security Sherlock’s been ranting about for days.”
John made his point quickly, knowing full well that she was a squadron leader if he ever saw one. “My name’s John Watson. I’m a GP. One of my patients needs care, can I borrow a burner to sterilize a few things?”
She had only just begun going on about -9.8m/s^2 when the silver frame hit the floor. Just like that, her ire was focused in a new direction and she came bolting out of the room as John picked up the photograph of a grinning Sherlock and Mycroft at some college do. “Must you be so clumsy?”
Sherlock felt that anyone working here had better things to do than tend to her. She was perfectly capable of finding her way to the Intensive Care and she told the chaplain as much in no uncertain terms. There had been so many people on that tarmac, that certainly, certainly, he had somewhere to be that did not include escorting her through the corridors.
John tried to shake his head. He wasn’t asking about himself. His concern was not for himself. He was concerned about Murray, and Escobar, and Pratt, and Jones. McGee, Chambal, Westlake, and Browne. The children. His patients. He wanted to know that the people he was responsible for were okay, that they hadn’t died or been injured because he had somehow failed.
“Well, now.” Victor declared, “Aren’t you going to warn me off? Despite Sherlock’s precious little schoolgirl crush, I can assure you, our bond runs deep.”
John heard a broken whimper, and watched as Sherlock began to shove aside a giant blue tarp. The material nearly weighed her down, and both Greg and John moved to help her quickly shove it back. There, underneath the tarp rested countless boxes of God knew what, which served as weights upon a metal dog crate. There, in a crate suited to a puppy half his size, rested a bound MacPherson. His muzzle and paws were bound with the tape. He had a laceration in his side running from his fourth rib to his hip. And yet, when he saw them struggling to open the crate, his tail wagged.
John shrugged. This was not tit for tat. This was the dynamics of war, a game both he and Mycroft knew well. He knew he was asking Mycroft to see to the deaths of some very powerful people. He would do what he had to do to end their brutality, even if it meant facilitating their ends himself.
When they came to a particularly location with spotty coverage, Sherlock sat down primly on a stone bench and settled her skirts around her. John very carefully looked away, and cleared his throat.
Sherlock’s splutter was amazing. He had jumped five steps ahead and four to the side of where she obviously had assumed this conversation was going. But he was a doctor, a soldier. He did not complain. He did not complain, especially, about the things he could work to change. “You would have me ask Mycroft for help?”
John was now in possession of a desk, a few chairs, a filing cabinet, and a locking case for supplies. His supplies included a box of cotton swabs, a few other random bits and bobs, and an a cupboard that he didn’t want to explore. The space was clean, but clearly disused but for some storage in the front waiting area.
John felt a cool hand within his own, but it was not the correct hand. He knew this instinctively. Whoever was holding his hand was a stranger to him, and for a split second he thought he felt someone tapping morse code along his palm. The sensation faded as pain bloomed.
“I stabbed him.” Sherlock declared, something bubbling in her eyes that had John reaching out to embrace her.
John laughed outright, liking the idea that staid James, unflappable James, had a sister devoted to pyrotechnics. “What did you do, mate, use her toaster and leave it on the wrong setting?”
MacPherson abandoned rolling around and growling at the newspaper that had so offended his mummy, and sniffed hopefully at John’s raisin bread and butter. John glared gently at the dog, who proceeded to take a running leap and slide into his paper horde, glasses firmly on his face. “When he chews that, I’m not cleaning up the messes.”
“Did you arrange it?” John asked, not fussed either way, placing the flannel that Hawker had been using as one of their own.
That was a smart opening. The girl at the desk was a former steak-loving recently impassioned vegan, had a dog, and had recently cleaned out both her kitchen and her closet. She could barely look at the leather shoes Mycroft wore, or Sherlock’s necklace. She had clearly just thrown away very beloved items in a sense of duty to her newfound path.
Molly giggled in the background. Of course, Sherlock berated her for it. At that, John left the room. She’d get her phone back when she got it back. If a text came, well, she’d just have to wait until he’d gotten back.
Once he was alone, John looked around at the stuff on his desk, and declared, low, under his breath, “It’s like Christmas…”
It did little but remind him that he was an alien, little but remind him that he wasn’t here on holiday. Vaguely, John wondered how he’d ever feel fully qualified, knowing as he did that his training was only one part of his life. People called him doctor, but he felt like he was playing make-believe sometimes, when someone was gushing blood and he was the only thing standing between that soldier and death.  He wished he were back in the tents sewing someone up. At least there he felt he was doing some good.
Jim’s phone buzzed rapidly as the door jingled. John sipped his beer as a shorter man of indeterminate age entered the bar and tried to discreetly approach James. “Sir, my apologies, but your sister has threatened to set fire to—”
Sherlock dragged the top sheet off of the bottom of the bed, and proceeded to use it like a toga as she moved off to the loo and started the shower before replying. Dropping the sheet, she climbed in and began to speak, “It hardly concerned me. Not only were you woefully sexually incompatible, you dated her largely because you felt you should do. It had far less to do with heteronormativity than you think. As I said, I found it reassuring.”
“It won’t.” Though she had no real way to make that promise, John believed her. Something blazed in Sherlock’s eyes. “It’s clear, despite my occasional musings to the contrary, that you need a post as a doctor.”
He would have rescheduled people, but there simply wasn’t time. Anyone he pushed back would have had a hell of time getting a new slot, and everyone deserved their care, irrespective of ceremonial activities. “I’m surprised you haven’t got the radio on.”
When he had a chance, he borrowed a laptop, ostensibly to email Harry that he was alright. Just before they loaded him on a plane, confined to a bed with others heading to the US in similar circumstances, John googled what little information he had on the list, barely able to concentrate on the borrowed screen.
“Well.” John took note of the fact that Sherlock was keeping data like this in her head, “I’d hate to skew your data.”
“Well, how do we know they’re experts on MacPherson's breed?” Sherlock began anew, “There are countless variances!” She peered at her phone, and scrolled downward, and began to rattle off information about dog breeds.
John went in for the kill. “Why don’t you spend some of Mycroft’s ill gotten gains and splash out on something with running water, heat, and locking windows?”
Sherlock’s voice dropped. “I could tell you more about your sexual habits or your propensity for danger and risk.”
John knew that he had inserted himself everywhere, and having met the man, John could just picture him sticking his nose into whatever anyone else was doing, so as to position himself to steal the credit. John could just see him rifling through people’s bags and violating basic lab etiquette to get ahead. He could also see a young Sherlock training herself to ignore him as she had long ago trained herself to ignore irrelevant annoyances, like a draft or a burnt out light bulb.
When John blinked, she was gone, in a swirl of dress. John knew it would haunt his dreams, if he slept.
“I’m sorry to bother you—” John began, but he was cut off quickly. She didn’t spare him so much as a glance as she continued on with her work.
“MacPherson’s been abducted.” John was already out the door doing a sweep. There were tyre tracks in the grass, as though his abductor had peeled out of there quickly. He berated himself for being so focused on Sherlock that he’d observed nothing of note on their journey home. John spotted something in the grass, and felt his gut clench. MacPherson’s moose was being pecked at by one of the more dotty chickens.
She sighed, “I’d saw my own leg off for some relief ‘fine’ or I could probably sleep alright ‘fine?’”
“You believe what you are saying.” Sherlock breathed the deduction, as though she herself did not believe this to be true, “And you weren’t lying about the lengths you would go to in order to keep him with us when you confronted Mycroft. It was not at all falsehood or adrenaline.”
When they got to the Port of Inverness, Sherlock wasted no time in bolting towards the storage areas. Mycroft reached out to grab her arm as her long stride wobbled when the flooring changed depths. John was shocked to see that level of reactivity from Mycroft, who would have clearly seen that she was well on her way to righting herself before John’s hand had even found her arm.
Sherlock thought that certainly she would be a better person to bid John farewell. Certainly his sister wasn’t making this parting any easier for him. Sherlock wasn’t going to have word of him for months, and she had skipped out of boring tutorials just to come and see John, not his sister. And still, Harry was still making this entire thing about her. This was not about Harriet. This moment was about John. Did no one in his blasted family understand that John was his own person, far their superior in ever way?
“Complaints, ma’am, do not come from your department.” Dr. Marshall boomed, “You have violated conduct guidelines, accessed sealed documentation, and stuck your sticky beak where it does not belong.”
She simply nodded, and strode off. As John predicted, she returned with someone who could only be the charge nurse. She had that look of competency and control about her. “Carol,” Jessica began, obviously rehashing their discussion to make it seem like they hadn’t discussed him privately, “Captain Watson doesn’t remember his wife.”
“Think, John, Think!” Sherlock demanded happily, patting the dog and putting her other hand beneath her chin, “Now hundreds more will have access to my services. Oh, think of the cases you’ve given me, you wonderful man.”
“Shit.” Greg breathed, turning to Sherlock and nodding once, before asking, “Sherlock, who do you think murdered this woman?”
John floundered, wondering if he should take the chair to wait until MacPherson fell asleep. In the slanted light spilling faintly into the window, John felt as though he were here on a hit. He’d sooner die than hurt Sherlock, but he knew that this moment, whatever it was, was changing him as war had changed him.
She simply nodded, and they set off, enjoying the cold air in their lungs and the crisp landscape around them. Father Holmes and Mycroft were holding a shooting weekend in the latter days of their stay, and though John had little interest in such pursuits, he had agreed to go along. He felt he had to put on a happy face about it, if only to be personable and to show that he wasn’t the one grumbling about them inviting people out for the weekend. Sherlock seemed to want to enjoy the outdoors when it was free of her relatives. John did not exactly blame her.
“Just meet her. Christ. I’m not asking you to marry her and have six unruly babies in the next ten years.” Stamford joked, “Though I do think it would suit you.”
“Of course it is.” Lucy agreed, as John tapped away at his phone, something about sheep’s blood versus human blood, and Mike sent him a fond look, “It’s all your doing, Mike, after all.”
Sherlock was beside him as she slipped through the door, deductions in her eyes. John moved systematically from the right, Sherlock took the left as Greg moved down the center of the cramped but large space. They worked hurriedly, knowing that Mycroft could only keep the camera system down for a short period of time. They had less than ninety seconds remaining.
It was in light of this truth that Mycroft began to speak, “They believe he has every possible chance of survival. There will be nerve damage. He will never hold a scalpel again.”
“She got me a new psychologist the day I’d decided to end it, and had the means to do it.” John told him, knowing that the time for secrets was past. “I’d written the note, everything. That same day, they hauled me down to the psych’s office, and I was given some vague explanation that I was now working with Dr. Phillips.”
When he said as much to the horse, Sherlock scoffed and retorted, "It is clear that Austen's best work was
Still, they had a plan. Sherlock’s brain had taken over, and her deductions had flown thick and fast. She was focused as a laser, and as deadly as a missile. What John knew now about Michael Weston was enough to make his blood boil. Government reports came through quickly when he had a name. Had he waited another twenty minutes, he would have had voice-matching evidence rendering a name unneeded, but time was of the essence.
John unfolded himself from his chair, pushed aside his thoughts and his hopes for clean laundry today, and accompanied woman and dog to the aforementioned crime scene. Anderson was at the barrier, and was their first obstacle as he had always been. This had not changed since MacPherson’s first case some weeks ago, “I won’t have a dog contaminating my crime scene.”
In a moment or two, the autumn sunlight illuminated the glass windows of a large, sandy-colored home, with vines climbing up the walls. Sherlock read the thoughts dancing across his face before they were smoothed away. John blamed his lack of a poker face on being distracted by the process of drawing up around the circle drive and parking the car in front, as it seemed the thing to do.
Sherlock roused, likely having perfectly perfected timing this drive from Baker Street, and ran her fingers along the bottom of her coil of hair, tucking a few loose curls away, as though she hadn’t been in her Mind Palace for the entire drive, “Make the next left.”
“We’re going to get you out, mate.” John promised, as Sherlock worked to pick the first lock on the crate while Greg texted. John dimmed his torch, knowing they were running out of time. “You’re going to be fine.”
“He stole your findings?” John asked, knowing university labs to be cutthroat places from time to time. There was no question in his mind that Victor had made Sherlock’s safe spaces at University an absolute hell.
After all, when battling addiction, it helped to ask the richest and poorest person one knew. While Sherlock only knew what she had read and deduced of poverty, she had quite a lot of money. Money, that was, that and Father and Mummy refused to let her properly invest, but that was a consideration for another matter. She simply knew a great many people who had gotten sober or clean, and had all contacted this same number.
Sherlock looked up then, and John saw that she had a smudge of dirt on the edge of her cheekbone. Frostily, Sherlock replied, “It will improve flock dynamics. If my hypothesis proves true as it did for my parents, then the hens will begin to adjust their patterns with an eye towards increased egg-laying. Gwen’s told me they have been irregular as of late and her dietary changes have not altered that trend.”
Sherlock spoke then, “Not a friend, then. Relative. Cousin. Maternal side. Two degrees. You’re a doctor. Same age as John. You like me.”
There was drool on his shirtfront. John quickly took stock of his person and his physiology, and jolted backwards, launching himself off of the bed and onto the hard wooden floor. Only his training kept from calling out as he jolted onto the floor. John stared up at the ceiling until a craggy head licked his face, and scrambled up. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sherlock’s hand reaching out to where his body had once been, and something within John clenched at the foolish dream that she was reaching out for him.
“Oh, John…” Sherlock smiled that smile, the crooked, endearing one, one only he ever saw as she clicked away on her iPhone. “What makes you think I hadn’t already said hello?”
After a few more moments of agonizing chatter, John escorted Sarah to the flat. He did not attempt to kiss her, and she did not say she would call him. She would not be going out with him on Monday, nor again, and he wouldn’t be asking. Before she headed out onto the pavement of Baker Street, Sarah smiled sadly, and noted, “I never took you for the kind of man that wanted a dog, John.”
Was a sappy git, though John would never reveal that knowledge to his husband, who clearly knew it well enough. “Decided enough was enough?”
Mike faltered, until a hesitant bit of a pleasant smile crossed his face, “Yes, well. That was a terrible bit of business, wasn’t it? All’s well, I suppose.”
