There’s no hiding the scars inside his thighs. Maybe, Steve had noticed before, and knowing less, thought they were interesting birthmarks. Most have faded, disappeared and healed away. The worst, where the ends were held longer against his skin to make him scream, are almost craterous, pockmarked – not noticeable, ignorable, if you’re not looking.
Tony nods, though. “Thank you,” he croaks. “That’s all I ask for. A little bit – a little bit of trust, you know? It helps.”
Tony feels bad for him, almost. He looks so out of place standing there, tuxedo too tight, glass in hand like it’s a lifeline. Tony figures, you can take the boy out of Brooklyn, but that’s about it, really.
After Steve had returned from Wakanda, they fell back into bed. Steve loved Tony, and for him it was as simple as that. It didn’t matter that Tony’s hair was going grey at the temples, or that there were days he would be home so late whole days had passed. Steve’s love for Tony had alway been uncomplicated: he liked that he was clever, that he was kind, that he was funny.
“Surgery.” Tony had explained. “Arc reactor. Other things, too. Best kind of therapy is to… face your fears.”
that you read those books to try and make up with me. And I really love that you care enough about me to bother.”
(It should be longer, it should be more. Steve doesn’t want to say goodbye like this, he needs more time, he needs to say more than just — )
Steve is eating the slick out of him, determined, very thorough. Precise, is the word Tony thinks haphazardly, moaning like a whore in heat, head tipped back. He wishes, they were in bed. He wishes, it hadn’t been seven months. He wishes, just once, that he had picked up the phone.
I don't know how much you are like me, Tony. I see your father in you, but... but maybe I'm there, too. Like I said, you are kind. Do not let that be dulled at the edges.
“I don’t mean – I don’t mean history, or anything like that. I tried calling you back. I couldn’t get through.”
Tony watches the back of Steve’s head. Each of the little blond hairs on his nape, the freckles on his shoulders. His hair is darker than it was when they first met. He pillows his head on his arm, traces out a figure of eight on his back. Gentle, like. Maybe, not eight – a snake eating itself. Or, infinity.
Delicately, he climbs his way over Steve’s tangled limbs, eases himself back down against his side. He’s all splayed out on his front, arm bereft on Tony’s side of the bed, back rising and falling.
*honestly this is the darkest chapter yet. I guess there needed to be more angst. Can’t have them getting too happy.*
“I didn’t want to leave,” Steve says quietly, pulling back the sheets. “You know I didn’t want to leave you, after. Had to, I guess, but – “ and he brushes his knuckles against Tony’s cheekbone, where there’s a neat thread of stitches. “I’ve made mistakes, Tony.”
“Oh,” Tony breathes, climbing down to his knees, shuffling closer, “shh,” he soothes him, “shh, Steve, it’s alright, isn’t it? Here,” he eases his head carefully into the join of shoulder and neck, strokes his hair again and again. “It’s going to be okay. Easy, big boy. You’re okay. I know you’re going to be okay.”
He coughs, bile and blood. “You don’t make this easy, hmm, Tony?” Pierce says quietly, dabbing at his chin with a napkin.
“That’s very kind of him. I always thought he would be the kind to stick to his guns on something like religion.”
"Is it?" Tony blurts "Is it really? You know how relationships work, right? I know you're worried about me and Steve, you're amazing. The way you handle me, the way you treat me when I'm under, it's better than anything I've ever had, anything. I know that you, you take care to not upset, to make sure I'm relaxed, but Steve it's a two way street. If you won't let me help -- "
it says. And he sets the coffee pot before he goes to bed, because he doesn’t think Nick will be sleeping tonight.
rough. like, really rough. like, bust out those warnings, hold onto ur hats. it's going to be really, really rough.
“No, I’m – “ Tony laughs. He hadn’t realised this meeting would be so – intimate. “Are we waiting for other guests?”
Tony hears himself make a huffing sound which might be a laugh. Nick smiles. “Ah-ha,” he says, leaning back in his chair, “so you
Tony flushes. Shuts his eyes to avert his gaze. “No,” Pierce orders, gently, “keep them open. Look at me.”
“The guy that works the security cameras is going to have a field day,” Tony croaks, swallowing hard against his bruised tonsils.
“Good luck getting her back stateside. And Tony can’t leave the country, what, ship him off and let Potts take care of him? You might as well put the knife in his hand.”
Steve is holding his throat. Squeezing. “Bad,” he grunts again, shaking him slightly. Tony shivers, gripped, vulnerable.
“Sure. You get here often?” The man smiles, genuine. His hands are in his pockets, the top two buttons of his shirt are undone. What is he, some kind of – male model? He’s American, but Tony has never heard of him. There aren’t many Americans here tonight, and Tony was sure he knew most of them.
“He — mentioned something like that,” Steve says carefully. “Only once. He said he was publishing a paper about the new normal. Western Theology post the Thor effect.”
He wasn’t invited. Steve probably doesn’t want him there. He’s maybe even got some pretty young thing, some omega, who goes to church and is blonde and helps out with the homeless. Tony builds
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tony says, as levelly as he can manage. This is the kicker – this is the reason Steve’s in charge: his wide, open wings are coming down to bracket him on either side. He’s held. Left, right, and centre. Only place is forward, now. To bend himself, subservient, baring the vulnerable soft middle of his shoulder-blades.
Steve sort of – ducks, catches Tony over the shoulders with his arm. “It’s fine,” he says, easily, kissing the crown of his head. “You want to go to bed?”
But at Christmas, Tony just sips dolefully from his wine. He’s barely touched dinner, and he’s feeding his lamb to Mosely. “You shouldn’t be here,” he mutters eventually. “I’m bringing you down.”
Tony doesn’t say anything. He smacks his lips, yawns. “I’m sorry, Steve,” he mumbles. And slips into sleep.
But the skin that was in the water has warmed itself. If he could bury himself in the lake, he would be warm forever. In utero. He could live at the bottom of the lake, grow moss from his beard and have stone for hands and be happy, and alone. Why doesn’t Steve see that, why can’t he see?
“It wasn’t like that,” he repeats, no longer sure. “I – this isn’t Killian. This isn’t like that, I was – I didn’t
He asks her if there are people hiding in the house and she tells him no. Tony doesn’t know if he can believe her, but he decides to take a chance.
Tony snuffles slightly in acknowledgement; his breath catches in his throat and it comes out like a snort. He can hear Steve's soft smile, and his thumb takes up it's position brushing over Tony's temple. "Maybe something for a headache." Steve murmurs "Something to cool him down."
Steve sighs, grabs his lapels, slams him into the wall. “No,” he explains, patiently, “you know who was there. I know you do. And, if you tell me now, this will be easier.”
“Small world,” Dalcher says, “Tony knows everyone. We really must have dinner,” she smiles. She still wears the same shade lip. “Catch up,” she adds, tapping Tony’s chest with her finger, nail neatly rounded.
“Tomorrow. Hold off on the walk and we’ll go together. Get to work on some of that ball throwing technique, hey?”
“Mmm,” Tony agrees. His eyes are tired. “Maybe – hey. Maybe I’ll sit the next one out, okay? After this. Promise.”
“It’s just…” Steve shrugs a shoulder. “I don’t know what I did to make you hate me so bad. Maybe I’ve just got one of those faces.”
“He might as well have,” Peter sneers. Steve doesn’t know him well, but he thinks it’s an ugly look on the boy’s face – too young to have seen this much, too young to own this much hate. Or – no. Not hate; camouflaged pain.
“I don’t want to brag,” he says, voice rough in a way that means he’s holding back a laugh, “but the girl at the coffee shop knows my order.
“There’s a difference,” Natasha notes. “And it’s companionship, anyway. What going’s to matter in twenty years time? That you’re desperately in love with her, or that she makes you happy, and you can sit together, and you care for her. I know what I would choose.”
“Because this is a hospital,” the doctor says calmly, kindly. “Because we think it’s better you don’t see Steve, for awhile. Can we talk about him, Tony? Can we talk about Steve, and your relationship?”
Tony’s hand is wedged beneath a pillow. He curls his fingers around the switchblade, testing, finding the release through touch.
“I don’t understand,” Tony hears himself say, voice slow, even. He rubs at his nose. “What was that?”
Strange leans forward. "You want to know, why it had to be him. You want to know, how do you avoid it."
Steve – hooks his arms underneath his legs, lifts him up bodily. He doesn’t even ask if Tony can walk. “Keep your eyes open for me,” he says. “Talk to me.”
“I think he wants to talk,” Pierce says, tapping the loudspeaker. “There, Tony, how about you say your piece before you blow a blood vessel.”
“I’ll stop it,” Tony tells him. “The sleeping around. If that’s what it takes to have you, I’ll stop it. I would rather have you. You are more important to me than – any of the protection, and any of the… material gain.”
And they would dance around each other for a few days, at least until Tony, sheepish, would ask Steve what time he wanted to do lunch. And then they would snap back into shape, and life would continue.
“For what it’s worth… you were acquitted. I mean – you know that, right? But no one holds you responsible, I don’t – “ I don’t hold you responsible, I never did. Why could you never fucking see that, why could you never understand I –
Steve shifts his grip so he’s supporting Tony’s lower back with one arm, spits on his hand. “Aww,” he simpers, “you’re a desperate little fella’, aren’t you?”
Steve shrugs. “We’ll be under, most of the time. I know it’s estimated three nights, but I’m thinking – maybe a week. Even two. Which is a long time…”
“Yes,” she says eventually, tipping back her head, dabbing at her eyes with a napkin, “yeah, no. It was true. I just wanted him to know,” she’s nodding. “To have that, you know? I didn’t want him to be – “ her throat seems to close around the word, “ – s-scared.”
“He was raiding a base,” Hill starts to fill him in, blisteringly efficient. “Turns out, they had human livestock – if you understand what I mean.”
you’re mine. I need everyone to know. So they think, that Rogers, he’s got the sweetest bitch around. What kind of alpha he must be. And so they think, shit, I can’t touch him. Not ever. Not when he’s got the Captain at his back.”
“I’ll be there,” Steve promises. “And if I’m not?” He leans close, gently kisses the shell of Tony’s ear. “You’ll just have to answer naked,” he murmurs.
He sees Steve shut his eyes, which means he’s won. “Fuck you,” he says again, hating himself. “Fuck you,” he says, because he knows what Steve said was true.
Steve offers to pay her, and she sounds mildly irritated. She takes a tone that reminds him of his mother: “No, thank you,” she says curtly, voice sharp. “I don’t need payment to give a friend a lift.”
“He was happy to let you languish in a hospital,” a new voice points out. “He was happy to commit you to the system. I’m not saying – that it’s right, I’m saying that the system isn’t so bad. He’ll get the help he needs, real help, not supersoldiers who think they’re therapists because they have a therapist.”
early update! uh, going through some stuff. don't know when i'll update again soon. your comments are appreciated.
“It’s been two weeks,” Natasha interrupts. “The team still needs to function. We can grieve on our own time. Meanwhile, you need to figure out who’s going to be the government liaison.”
“Yeah,” he says again, softly. “It’s me. I know I look different. I know I might… I might scent a bit different, too. But d’you know me, Steve? Captain?”
He hears Steve sigh, can imagine him kicking off his shoes, lying back on his couch. He wonders what kind of couch Steve has. He wonders if he even has a couch.
Steve does. The ground is hard, the soil cracked and thin. He tries not to think about the dust under his palms. “Hey,” he says, going for light, familiar, lightly ghosting his hand across Tony’s shoulder. “I never said – congratulations. On the engagement.”
A bus, passing by, honks it horn, loudly, aggressive. “What the fuck you doing?” The cab driver asks, hitting the break.
Tony catalogues. Bruce is in Taiwan, he’s sure of it – in fact, they spoke this morning, and he’d been talking about udon noodles. Nothing pressing, or military related. “What the fuck is this?” He asks
The alpha gets down on his knees. Tony holds out his hand, and lets him kiss it. “I’m sorry,” he grits out, “From Stark, I apologise for my comment. It was rude, and thoughtless.”
“Whatever you just said. All that, that’s my fantasy now.” He shivers, rubs himself against Steve’s body. “Arms,” he rasps, pulling Steve’s around him. “Just until the water gets cold.”
Anyway: the guests who get seats. T’challa, and an entourage, sitting at the front. Maria Hill, who is pretending not to cry, and Sharon, who rests her head on her shoulder, holds her hand, rubs her knee. General Ross (sorry, Mr Secretary of State), President Ellis, a few ambassadors, UN representatives. The entire board of Stark Industries, Tony’s acquaintances, what few, extended relatives he actually has (a cousin once removed, a great-aunt), and, shockingly, friends. Friends of Tony’s that Steve has never met, but men and women who are now crying, dabbing their eyes. People he grew up with, people he worked with, people that are part of a life Steve never really knew about. The life of a real person.
Tony digs the groove of his nails into the palm of his hands. It’s the one thing Steve forgets, he keeps forgetting to keep Tony’s nails short. It’s not like he can really do any damage, but it quiets Them, it just – focuses him, that short spurt of not even pain, just tingles. And hey, isn’t is good for him to practice clenching his hands like that? If anyone asks, he’ll just tell them he’s trying to strengthen his grip and can’t really feel his palms anymore anyway.
“Shut up,” Tony mutters, and he folds his sleeves down over his arms. It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t exist, it never happened. Focus on the forward. Focus on the forward, that’s what the therapist kept saying in the ward, focus on the forward, Tony, because you can’t change the past.
Steve’s gripping his jaw between his thumb and fingers. “Watch your mouth,” he says, watching Tony’s. Fixated with it, actually.
“It’s not – a conspiracy,” Steve manages, which is the wrong thing to say. It belittles Tony, and he can see it in his face. “I mean – the doctor isn’t purposefully trying to stop you from thinking, you just – you’re having a bad reaction. A bad reaction, or side-effect. But if – no you’re right. You’re right, Tony, tomorrow first thing we’ll drive down to the ward and demand answers, okay? We’ll sort you out, see if you can change your dosage, anything. Anything for you, Tony.”
It just makes colours spark behind his lids, the dark making way to more visceral twists of vision, greasy, uneasy tableaus that reek so sharply of distress and fear that he wants to gag. He wants to pull away, too; he wants to stop himself from indulging it, these awful fucking self-destructive desires to watch those parts of his history, third-person, the way he’s memorised and envisioned all these years.
“I didn’t say that,” Tony starts, choosing his words carefully. “I’m just saying, I like your whole – you know,” is he – is he fumbling for words? No, that’s not it, that can’t be it. “Uh,” he gestures with his hands, “this. Very alpha, very nice.”
He loses himself to it. The scratch of his pencil on the paper, the way Tony’s face takes shape. Beautiful, perfect.
“I guess — “ Tony’s stomach lurches; had he been hungry? How had he not noticed? “I guess I could take some cake.”
I don't know, Tony. You're my son. I love you. I love you because you're my son, and because you are my blood. And you look like your uncle. I love you because you're clever, and you're sharp. When I first had you I was terrified you would grow up to be your father. Irrational, because I do not despise Howard. But I couldn't bear the idea of a son. And I could not hold you.
Tony sighs. He rests his head on his hands, debates whether he should tell the guy to just stop or whether it’s worse to spare his feelings. “Uh,” he frowns, “oh, yeah. It feels good, sweetie.”
“They’re, uh.” Does Steve know the technical name of different cuts of underwear? “Low-slung,” he settles for, “on my hips. Silk. They have a white trim, lacey.”
Tony’s mouth runs dry. “Hello?” The voice says again, croaky, rough with disuse. “Tony? Is that you? Tones? Are you there?”
“Good boy,” he says, voice warm, as his fingers stretch into Tony’s mouth. “You thanked me well, Stark.”
“I do,” the man smiles, fishing it out of his pocket, clicking the end. Tony searches the floor for any other names to tick off his list – if everything goes well, he can be in his car in less than an hour. “Here – it’s one of my favourites.”
“Hmm,” Nick agrees, begrudgingly. He can mostly decipher Tony’s meaning. He’s good at reading people’s faces. And, he stops complaining about the stink of vinegar after he gets to eat food that tastes good off a plate not layered with scum.
“He does,” Tony confirms, careful not to give his mission away. “But I’m not Fury, and I’ve told you I’m fine with what happened. I care more about – the other things.”
“You’ll get him nice and fat with your pups,” Pierce says pleasantly, “he’ll be happy, that way, you know he would. A good position – high commander? General supreme? It’s up to you, Captain. It’s all at the tips of your fingers, if you want it.”
God, curse me and my stupid beta nose, hmm? Apologies, Captain – you know I wouldn’t. If I knew he was yours.” She’s so smooth, the apology so sincere. “Good to see you robbing the cradle, Stark, you deserve it. If you would excuse me, then.”
“Oh no,” Ty says, voice eminently reasonable, “no worries. I don’t like all that wind screwing with my hair, anyway.”
Tony shrugs, letting his head rest against the leather. He snuggles slightly, bringing his feet up onto the seat.
The pillows, the sheets, are somehow cloaked in his scent; he’s shivering, barely-there, letting Pierce move him, take off his shoes and his socks. His face is smushed into the pillow and he’s just huffing the scent buried there, eyes half-closed, drooling.
“When the scars heal over it’s beautiful,” she says, proudly “I’ve never managed to work on such a large scale before, humans usually die from the blood loss. But you? You’re a clean canvas.” She giggles, nudges him with her elbow as it they’re sharing a joke.
They both pause while a staffer walks by, tablet in hand, heels clicking against the marble floor. They wait for her to pass. Then:
Without much fuss, he pours the rest over Pierce’s face. Then, unstoppers another, this time pure vodka, and does the same. He shuffles around Pierce’s jacket, his rising and falling chest, to pick up his lighter.
“Shhh,” Killian is soothing again, holding his neutral hand over Tony’s lips. “That’s no good, Tony, I need time to explain. The other option, the
His lungs ache when he breathes, but it's good. Deep, and sturdy, it means he's alive. Matched with the heavy bass that Tony feels beating through his chest, his neck, down to the tips of his fingers and toes, it feels steady. Strong. The pillow beneath his cheek is a rough tether to the real world, and Steve's hand in his hair makes him float. Anchored, secure, and the aches begin to ease, bone deep and long suffering.
“You’ve left the grounds in the sink,” Steve says, disgusted. “What did he say about leaving coffee grounds in the sink?”
“No,” Steve says, and Tony can tell he’s choosing his next words very carefully. “But I was thinking, about all that stuff you said. Using your body for things, and I thought – well, maybe there are things you want from me. Not – not material things, not – that’s not what I mean. But you think if I’m on your side, you have a… that I’m on your side. Maybe, I don’t hurt you if I’m your side. I vouch for you with Fury. Things like that.”
This tugs something in Steve, reminds him. “I need you to fill his position,” he says. “Liaison with Ross.”
His nose is pressing into the soft spot behind Tony’s ear. “Sweet thing,” he murmurs, voice croaked and rasping, “you’re such a – such a sweet thing.”
Tony’s instinct is to cover his face and groan, but he can’t allow that. Fucking hell. This is worse than the time Howard sat him down to explain that he was going to be contracted and how
“Hey, birdbrain.” He croaks, and Clint crouches, checks his pupils, presses the comm in his ear. “Affirmative,” he says “we have Cap.” He pulls out water from his pack, glances briefly at Gus’ inert form. “Who is he?” He says after he tugs the bottle from Steve’s lips “Where’s Tony.”
Pierce wrinkles his nose. “Oh, Tony. Even if it did, I wouldn’t have blamed you, knowing what I know. It’s not the impulse that concerns me, it’s the fact he… it was a particularly bad business. A
“I’m telling you,” Steve murmurs, mouth by his ear, breath warm, “that your actions reflect badly on us.” His thumb digs into the pulse point on Tony’s wrist. “Do you understand?”
Steve used to be so jealous of Tony’s work, the way it commanded so much of Tony’s attention. If he could have kept him in that bed all the time, he would have. Cossetted him from the world, kept him safe. He didn’t want this to happen, please, please, please, this is never what he wanted.
“And that’s hard to change. Especially when you’re so… earnest. And you’ve taken good care of me. I know I don’t verbalise it, but I do appreciate you basically forcing me to breathe, and buying me a dog, and graciously letting me stay here in the headquarters I built and designed and paid for with my own money.”
“I assume he hasn’t told you anything about the risk?” Pierce continues. “He hasn’t told you what that drug does to an alpha, I presume. What happens when you throw in an O, leave them to be – Tony, if he was anyone else, and you were willing, I’d okay it. But he’s stronger than ten men. There’s every chance he’ll rip you apart.”
“You know,” Pierce sighs, crouching low, flicking ash, “the worst part is, there’ll be some warm sunshine this evening but cloud increasing overnight, with a few outbreaks of rain possible later in the night, minimum temperature 40.”
Mr Cain laughs, even though his face is all twisted, melted, bushy eyebrows and – blonde hair, although it had been white before. “I’d love to see you in red, Tony. Next time, when the HYDRA has existed for a long time, you just haven’t noticed. We’ve been inside those pretty department stores, Tony, where they sell the nice brassieres. Would you like a nice brassiere? I can tell Fury, but between you me, he won’t be around for much longer.”
Ugliest of all are the scars which reach up his forearm. Tony decides he will never wear a t-shirt again, not in Arizona in the heat of summer, not in the fucking desert. He never wants to see those marks again. He doesn’t need reminding of his utter lack of hope, and his complete failure to achieve even the most basic of things.
Steve is quiet. He rolls up the bandage, zips up the kit. “Please don’t – make yourself do those things. Don’t use yourself that way.”
I know it's rushed, I just figured it's better to upload something shorter than never upload anything? If you enjoyed it, thank you! If you're still reading this, thank you! If you have any comments on the ending, or if you enjoyed the story, please leave some below!!
“I don’t think you’re making the right decision,” Fury presses. “Jesus, Stark, do you think I want him to suffer? I’m telling you, this is too much risk. Stark. I don’t want you hurt.”
Tony wants him to say worse. He wants to hear Steve heap praise on his ability, call him out for being the dirty whore he really is, drooling around alpha dick in a stairwell, naked in public, hands and knees on the floor where he belongs. Maybe to alleviate the pain of Steve’s fingers in his hair, or just to touch him, any part of him, he reaches up his hands to curl around Steve’s fists, kneels there while he fucks his throat and just takes it, drooling with no protest.
What’s left, or what was. He’s the first person to even suggest it, while they stand there, ash in their hair, in their mouths, in their eyes.
Is Tony’s body in that coffin? It’s terrifying if it is. Did they stitch it back together with a needle and thread? Or did they just bundle him in, a collection of body parts? They should have had him cremated, why didn’t they do that? The idea of Tony, resting like that, not built the way he was born, it makes Steve want to vomit. They should have cremated him, flown his ashes out over the sea, over the sky, over space. Now he’s going to be grounded forever, a patchwork puzzle (there’s a reason it isn’t open casket) and stuck in the earth, buried. Jesus, that’s not right, that’s just not right, Tony needs to be in the air, somewhere he can hum, and fly —
“So responsive,” Pierce says, mostly to himself. He holds the bandage against Tony’s upper arm, starts to wrap around it carefully. His fingers brush Tony’s skin. “I was so glad,” he continues, “when I heard you’d used extremis. If anyone could make it work, it would be you.”
Barnes doesn’t even need two hands to hold him. He manages to drag him out only holding him to his chest, and then Tony’s screams alert the others. Steve, Natasha, Sam. Tony kicks, and spits, and tries to bite, but they push him to the ground. He screams, and screams, and screams.
Sam’s eyes are big and brown like saucers. He sees them expand, bigger and bigger, chocolate and melting, running down his face. Tony smiles, and nods. Sam smiles back, bigger. He picks apart the toast the Natasha lays in front of him, hands jittery.
He had thought, stupidly, that he could make it better. Just like that. That a bit of love, companionship, hope, that all of this could fix him, make him see just how much he had to live for. He viewed Tony’s attempt to take his own life as a fluke, a one off, he imagined that Tony regretted it to no end and he would come round with some work, that he would happily go back to work and maybe even one day, come back to Steve too.
He’s pacing across the floor, and Tony – scrambles away, or tries to. He digs his fingers into his upper arm, drags him up; it
Tony feels himself tighten, pushing up. The start of the nice mellow, relaxed sensation has gone, his back is up, his tips are bristling. ‘This’, i.e. my being here, taking your place, the place you’ve always occupied, the respect you were always shown. Used to be, people would stop and nod when Tony entered a room. Now, Steve goes before him, and anyone with any sense is careful to avoid meeting Tony’s eyes.
“I think about your body a lot, you know,” Steve says, casually, like that isn’t the hottest thing Tony’s ever heard. “You distract me even when you’re not here.”
Then, he says “Somewhere, behind these walls,” another rasping breath “are the elder vampires. Left, for, for thousands of years, to rot, and go insane with hunger.”
He’s going to tell Steve. He doesn’t know what he needs to tell him, he just knows he does. Explain something. Everything.
“No. I changed up the order first. Then, when we got on the helicopter, I could tell you were upset. I wouldn’t have done it if you hadn’t been upset. I don’t know,” Steve says, crawling to the end of the bed, sitting there. “Are you mad at me?”
“You,” Steve says dismissively, easily. Obviously, it will be Natasha. Why does she even want to have this discussion?
“Hmm,” Tony sighs, happily, snuggling closer. “That’s nice. I was so worried – “ he yawns “ – so worried they’d be mean…”
Clint, he thinks, understands now. Because he’s imprinted too. But the difference is, his lover is alive, and Steve is alone.
Steve shrugs, holds out his hand. “Okay,” he says, “if you insist. I’m sure I can find some other way of shutting you up.”
Sarah sighs. “Because I don’t know. Because I liked you. Because — isn’t it human nature to help other people who are suffering? And I needed a change, I hated New York. And you, you were — clever, and kind, even thought you couldn’t see it. I had lot’s of reasons. Not all entirely unselfish, I’ll admit — “
“Diana found Tony. Beat him. She was going to kill me, Gus pulled me down. Thought I was dead. They left. Took Tony with them.” Steve coughs, body jolting, and Natasha feeds him some more water. He licks his lips.
He can practically hear the furrow on Steve’s brow. “No,” he says, “it’s a gift. A Christmas present.”
“You? And not us? You don’t think I wouldn’t have Bucky telling me to get the fuck up off my ass and do something?” Steve smiles, sadly. “Or that Sam isn’t calling me an idiot?”
I didn’t, obviously. And as the years turned into decades I gave up trying to force myself to love you. Truth is, I haven’t loved anyone for a very long time. Your father, maybe, at the beginning. My brother. That first baby. I can count on one hand the people I can honestly say I love and I’m sorry that you are not on it.
Tony is about to launch into a tirade, but he catches himself. “You’re shitting me, right? That’s – that was a joke.”
“I – “ Tony goes quiet. Carefully, he pats Steve’s back. “It’s okay,” he tells him. “It’s fine. Nothing to thank me for, right? I’m alive. Takes more than a space whale and the unending void to beat a Stark.”
Pierce tsks. He gently scratches his fingers through the back of Tony’s hair, tips his head forward so it’s hanging against his chest.
“Captain,” Natasha says, seating herself next to him as Clint starts the jet “it’s… it’s good to see you.” And her voice is heavy with some sort of emotion that Steve doesn’t often get from her. “What, uh,” she clears her throat, tilts her head, starts again “where’s Tony?”
When he opens them again, it’s raining harder against the windows. The TV is on, CNN playing at a low volume. He frowns, muggy; Steve’s feet are on the coffee table, ankles crossed.
Tony says nothing. There’s an awkward silence. Bruce mumbles, “she was dusted,” and Thor says ‘oh’, uncomfortable. “Yes. Of course. Well – yes.”
Steve holds out his hands. Tony takes them, legs a little wobbly, pitching a little into his chest. He smells good. Tony could easily just rest against him, now. “Does that feel better?” Steve asks, kindly. “Did it take the edge off?”
“It’s not healing,” Gus breathes “I haven’t eaten, I haven’t — ah!” He jerks when Steve runs his fingers over the wound, when fresh blood runs down his ribs.
“When we were younger,” Rhodey says absently “Tony would — I always hated math. Wanted to be an engineer, wanted to fly a plane, but I hated it. I got into college by the skin of my teeth. I would have probably dropped out if Tony hadn’t done half it for me.”
And then he pulls away. Tony is gasping; he didn’t even realise. He slides to the floor, pants around his ankles, come and slick leaking down his legs. He watches Steve wash his hands at the bar, dry them, roll down his sleeves. “Are you going to stay there all night?” He asks.
You’re telling them too much, the first voice hisses. Stop this, they can use anything against you! Are you crazy? Weak little boy, be better!
There are razors. There’s bath to drown in. Sarah is shopping, and won’t be home for another hour. He could drink some bleach. He could jump out the window. Any option is open to him.
Tony looks at him. His eyes really are vacant; it’s terrifying, and bizarre, like someone has reached inside and scraped Tony’s soul from his body. “You trust in me?” He whispers. “Even after this? Even after I’ve failed so – monumentally?”
Tony’s eyes bloat. Everything ripples. He looks at his hand. The squirming lines are worms. He whimpers, tries to brush them off on Pierce’s arm. “What,” he snorts, blowing air through his nose, trying to clear his sinuses, “what is this?”
“It wasn’t you.” Tony mutters, wincing at the pain, still feeling jittery. “It was nothing you guys did, I just – ” Tony sighs. “Have you ever been scared of commitment?”
“But,” she says, standing “but, I have such a wonderful design for you.” And she strides to a table, her oak desk, and pulls out sheets of flimsy paper.
Pierce frowns at him, stuffs his panties back into his mouth. “I don’t care what you know,” he says, trailing his finger down the slope of Tony’s nose, “I just want to talk. Man to man, alpha to alpha. You might even like what I have to say, and then… well. You’ll get him back, safe and sound. Unhurt, I promise. Well. Alive, at least.”
I'M DETERMINED TO FINISH THIS STUPID FUCKING STORY IF IT'S LITERALLY THE LAST STUPID FUCKING THING I EVER FUCKING DO
Now, he’s thinking of that night in the rain, on the lonely road when they had barely even started. How Steve had frozen, watching Tony, and how Tony had tried his hardest to explain why Steve couldn’t love him, why Tony was going to drag him down.
Pierce grins. He blows smoke in his face. “That’s a good idea, Tony,” he tells him. “We will call Steve, as soon as he gets back. Or, well – maybe a bit after,” he considers. “I might give him a chance, first. And I wouldn’t want you to go to waste.”
“Where else is there?” Maria snaps. “God Clint, stop acting like there was any love between you after — “
Every part of him aches, though. He assumes the painkillers should have taken care of it, but in his loose state it occurs to him that it runs deeper. Months of never sitting still. Years of strained muscles and holding yourself so tight your joints go from bone to stone to iron. He's creaking, like rusty metal. He needs more, more, more softness. More gentle touches. Blunt nails, scraping over his scalp, easing the ache for touch alone.
And he trails off, already limp with sleep. Steve listens closely for any sign of agitation, but his breath is just so slow, so even. Steve feels his own breath regulate alongside it, soft and easy and steady. How lucky he is. How fucking lucky he is, for all of this – for the warm bed, and the apartment, and most of all for Tony, healthy and whole and all his. Steve thanks God before he drifts away, even though it’s been a long time since he’s sat in mass. Only a God could create this perfection, he thinks, this perfect life he has.
Thoughts are appreciated!! We're coming to the end now, plus an epilogue. My last exam is tomorrow morning and after that I have about twelve weeks off so expect a few faster updates.
He’s pleased to discover that his new sweater is Steve’s, too – again, he wonders how it got here, if Steve has had supplies holed up in this bunker, wherever it is. The pants are slightly too big, but keep him mostly decent. They don’t have a smell. Generic sweats, fresh from plastic packaging.
Steve talks to the driver, unfolds a thick wad of fifty-dollar bills. Bribe money, Christmas money. A thank you, for dealing with Tony’s bad behaviour. “I’m sorry,” Tony says, blinking snow out of his eyes while Steve tugs him away, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
“Not at all,” Tony lies, nodding and smiling at a passing General. “Just remind me – this is for – “
He pinches his ear lobe, pulls. It’s a sharp pain, grounding – Tony’s been punished like that before, pulled by his ear. It tugs on the gland, makes him whimper. Pierce’s lips are so close to his skin. “You’re going to listen to me,” he whispers, and gently kisses his cartilage. “Because you want to listen to me. I am going to tell you what to do. You will do it, because you want to do what I tell you.”
“I think, if anyone could control him, it would be you,” he says quietly. “But, the risk. You’re not capable of holding him off on your own on a good day, let alone when he’s like this.”
But if Steve lets him snooze, he’ll wake up in the early hours unable to get back to sleep. He knows this from experience. He softly sets the toast and coffee on the small table, sits himself on the couch. Maybe, he allows himself to quietly watch the rise and fall of Tony’s chest, the new, deeper lines around his eyes. He’s stopped dying his hair. It’s all grey through the roots. And he resists the urge to fetch a blanket and drape it over his legs and just let him rest.
Pierce snarls, reaches for it again, and this time Tony strikes him, slashing wildly, catching his cheek deep. Pierce stumbles back, Tony stands, and then they’re both there, opposites. A stand-off. One shaky, drugged omega with bruised ribs and a broken wrist. The head of HYDRA.
Steve takes the gag out of the brown bag. He fiddles with the platinum clasp. “Do you want to make it up to me?” He asks.
“I’m sorry I didn’t catch you yesterday,” she says, not meeting his eye. Her hair is tied back neatly in a ponytail, her shirt and skirt spotless. This woman is so flawless, he can understand what attracted Tony to her all those years ago. Just looking at her makes you feel like you have your life together, even though you can tell she’s been crying, and she keeps laughing at inopportune moments. “It was so busy, what with the traffic.”
“It’s fine,” Steve says, gently. “One of these days I’ll stop bugging you about it.” He tries to smile, but it’s not the same.
But he can’t remember standing on Pierce’s patio, with Steve near lifeless, bloody and beaten. He doesn’t remember shaking him until he woke, slowly, only to take Tony’s shoulders and squeeze him, and sob, even while the house smoked behind them. He doesn’t remember that. In Tony’s memory, what’s left of it, Steve shushes him gently and that’s that.
“M’ a Nazi.” Gus slurs. “M’ a, that’s my, I’m a Nazi. Or, that's what people call me. S'not true, though.”
Tony is scrubbing at his face. He knows not to verbalise when he wants to tell his brain to shut up; it scares people, makes them think he’s talking to himself. He’s not, he knows the voices aren’t real, but still, the urge is there. “Listen,” Tony says, this time quietly. “Tell me what it is you need, and I’ll see if I can help. I’m not making any promises but — just tell me.”
He doesn’t reply. She notes something on a clipboard, offers to give him a sedative. He refuses. She runs through the symptoms of shock, as if Steve didn’t already know.
“Favourite decade,” Tony asks him, smiling up from where he’s lying splayed out on the couch. “One two three go.”
“They can’t get out, don’t worry. We’re perfectly safe here.” And he smiles, as if the irony of the situation doesn’t escape him.
Steve claps him on the back, squeezes his shoulder. “Relax,” he smiles, all teeth. “Who’s go was it anyway?”
When they’re far enough away that no one can hear Peter’s curses, he loosens his grip, lets him pull away. “Bastard!” He screams again, bent double with it. No one hears it. “He
but he feels good in Steve’s arms. “Maybe a little,” he slurs, letting his head roll against his arms.
With this new medication, Tony’s moods oscillate wildly. God fucking forgive him, but even Steve’s fuse begins to grow short. One moment Tony is laughing, the next he’s sobbing, then ten minutes later he’s ripping out the pages from Steve’s books and using them to clog all the sinks he can find.
“Alright,” Fury pushes, “and, in your expert opinion, how could someone use this? What could they gain from using this on someone? On you, for instance?”
Now, Steve is driving through New York. What for? Something that doesn’t matter, a talk, or a seminar, he can’t even remember. He’s not feeling awful, which makes a pleasant change, and there’s the first bite of winter in the air.
“You do that,” Steve says, voice rough, warm. Tony puts down his cell and picks off the buttons of his shirt, kicks down his pants, squirms out of them and pushes everything down the bed. The air is warm, but his skin goose-pimples anyway.
Tony pulls at his tie, watches the screen that shows him the elevator rising to the penthouse. He has a migraine building at the back of his head, although he can’t tell if it’s from the talk with Fury, the thought of having to wrangle Steve – a person he somewhat respects and, dare he say,
“My turn,” says another, and they pull him off of the knee, sprawl him out on the couch. This one is old, and he is large. The weight of him crushes, when he covers him entirely, starts to kiss him. Tony’s hands are above his head, unbound and useless. His fingers barely twitch. His legs are spread, one wrapped around the man’s back, the other in the air. He moans. The man starts to suck lines into his throat and Tony acquiesces, makes soft little sex sounds. It feels good. Everything feels good.
“Honestly,” Steve says “they’ll find us here. God, okay, how long has it been since the plane was hijacked? Nearly a day? They’ll be here soon.”
Stop it, stop, enough. Pull yourself together, Tony, it wasn’t as bad as all that. It does no one any good to think about these things, and it’s no good telling tales, you just make it worse. Who is going to believe him when they see those pictures, the lines of coke, the stupid fucking crystal tumblers and the ashtrays? Worse than a laughing-stock – you think MIT are going want you – no, you think SHIELD is going to want this on their plate, it’s a disgrace, it’s –
"I didn't do it to be cruel," Strange says, and Steve meets his eyes; there's a hint of desperation, there. "I would have told him. I thought -- it may be kinder, to let him have those years."
there are photos? People are going to know. It’s just not going to work. I wash my hands of it all, Stark. You’re more trouble than your worth.
“It’s something I do effectively to the benefit of this team, that only I can do. It feels like a job.”
The comforter smells so well-worn, almost musty. Tony inhales deeply, feels dust tickle the back of his throat; snorts a little, buries his head back into all the sheets. There are parts of him that just hurt so
“And what? You want to dig him up, kick him out to sea and have me torch the motherfucker with an arrow? You think that’ll make this better?”
They patch him up, and Nebula tells them what went down. She tells them about Doctor Strange, and Peter Parker, and how both of them faded. Steve remembers the kid; he was what, fifteen? Sixteen? But he won’t be the only child dead, millions of them across the universe, many much younger than him.
Richards laughs. Pierce laughs. “He will be,” he says. “Go on,” he allows, indulgently. Tony sees him, sitting there, in his chair. He has one, clarifying thought: you will not win.
Giggling, he throws himself across the floor. Steve is still strong enough not to budge, not even an inch, when Tony launches himself into his arms, smiling into his neck, babbling, trying to tell him
He could let go of all that, if he just left, right now. He doesn’t think there would be any going back after this. He knows himself. And he’s been here before.
“Oh,” Tony jokes, distantly, not really hearing himself, “are we still talking about your science project or something else?”
“You wanted to save your friend. Barnes. I understand that, Steven. I — I sometimes think there isn’t much I wouldn’t have done to have saved my brother.”
Peter looks away. “Yeah,” he rasps, “he did. Wanted to say… I don’t know. Some stuff, about good fight and – whatever.”
"Sure," Steve says easily, pushing the button to the top floor "but not today. You're concussed, you know."
“Well okay then. What’s so bad that you can’t open the door, hmm? Because, I know you’re not on the toilet, and I can bust this down if I have to.”
“That would probably be your dream, huh?” Ty leans in against the wall, one arm bracketing Tony’s head. He’s safe, obviously. These are SHIELD’s New York headquarters. There are at least six security cameras in this hallway alone.
“There will be. I suppose I wanted to check in, now that we’re reacquainted.” Pierce fishes out a pack of cigarettes, holds it out. “You smoke?”
He’s shaken. “Yeah,” he agrees. “Pepper,” he says, and rests his hand against her back, as gentle as he can.
He waits for her to add something, to ask him how he slept, to just — to at least acknowledge the fact that Tony is no longer here and yesterday was his funeral. But she doesn’t. She just puts her plate in the sink, washes her hands briefly, and turns away.
“I’m not gonna beat you,” Steve tells him, like he’s discussing the weather. “Take off those shoes. Get those pants down from around your knees, too. If someone’s going to see you, they’re going to see you naked, like you deserve.”
Steve exhales. "'Hit' is putting it lightly." He scoffs. "You rammed into the pavement from an 30,000ft drop."
He scuffs his foot on the ground. “So, uh, we were going to get some lunch?” He asks, pointing back with his thumb, scratching his ear. “I don’t know if you’re up for it, I know I said – “
Steve swallows. It’s a need he understands. How many times, when he fought over enemy lines, did he dream about his body being left to rot in someone else's land? When he drove that plane into the ocean, he had thought about it, he had thought I’m going to die, and I won’t see my home one last time.
After, he feels like he was hit by a truck. He wakes up alone, bandages fresh, in clean sleep-clothes. There’s a tall glass of water and an aspirin by his bed. He frowns, groans – he’s told, it’s the 26
Two more orderlies. They’re both very kind. Tony explains he doesn’t like the way the doctor’s talking, and that he’s tired. He asks if he can go home. The doctor’s say he can go back to his room, and they’ll bring him dinner. He asks if he can see Steve. They tell him no.
Tony thinks he’s crying again. Eventually, he falls back into sleep. His cries become whimpers, which turn into breaths. Achingly, gently, Tony rolls him over, sets him back on his side of the bed. He drops his own head back down on the pillow.
“I do, actually,” Tony smiles, propping up his chin on his hands, twitching his toes in the air. “How was it? Any questions about your quick exit?”
“Well, nutrition, for starters. This place does food better than any restaurant I’ve been to, Tony. Look, there’s even chocolate cake.”
After, Tony would be apologetic. He would slide up to Steve, beg forgiveness, explain that everything was so stressful and it wasn’t Steve he was angry at. He would become tearful, he would tear at his hair. He would drink, and Steve would try to stop him, knowing full well that it would just make him worse if confronted.
Tony looks up. “For what it’s worth, I guess, I – wish things had turned out different. And don’t get me wrong, 90% -- no. No, maybe 95%. 96%. 96% of that was on you, your fault, you stubborn ass, but that 4%...”
Tony thinks. It’s slow going. “We will talk about this — somewhere private. I don’t want Sarah involved. You — “ he snaps his fingers “ — pass me that gown. No, that’s a blanket. Yeah the one on the door. Nice.”
“Yeah, I did.” Steve is characteristically brief. “You can take it. I’m always – it can be difficult. Because of how I am. Not every O can – take it.”
“Stew,” Bruce says kindly. “I didn’t want to impose any more. The Wakandans have enough to deal with, but – I think it’s pretty good.” He and Natasha have set up camp together; a hotplate, a large pot, glasses, mugs, strange tea sachets that Tony can’t recognise. Aren’t they lucky together.
“He wasn’t,” Steve assures her, quietly. “It was a bad way to go, but – surrounded by friends? Knowing you won the fight of your life?”
Tony feels the whole world spin again as Steve tugs him to his feet. They don't work, he feels himself stumbling, and the room lists to the side. "I'm gonna be sick." He says again.
“And while you’re at it, fix the sink. I’m going to be here long after you’re gone, the least you can do is make yourself damn useful.”
“Steve,” he exhales, grinding his hips back, making himself remain completely loose, submissive and pliant beneath him. “Oh, Steve.”
A golden field, an oak hall. Tony is smiling. Steve reaches out a hand, tries to grasp air in his fingers, but the mirage shimmers, dips out of his touch.
“Don’t cry,” Steve blurts, and he kneels down, rubs at Tony’s knees, tries to prise his hands from his face yet still avoid the scars. “Shit please, Tony, don’t cry. Don’t. I can’t make Bucky leave but – but we can. I swear, as soon as you’ve put on some weight, as soon as you feel better, we’ll go. We can go anywhere you want, just you and me, alone. Just us, Tony, sweetheart, it’ll just be us.”
Someone grips the back of his head. “Kiss him,” they hiss, and spit on his face. “Go on. Do our resident stud the honour, From Stark.”
“I was high,” Tony spits “I was – thinking, I don’t know, maybe it would be less busy, or – I’m not going in there. I’m not leaving the car.”
Steve pulls out, twists Tony’s hips, manhandles him onto his back. He pinches one of his cheeks, pats it lightly. “You’re all red,” he smirks.
"You know, you talk a lot about trust, Steve, I always have to trust you, but how do you think it makes me feel that you won't trust me?"
“Then I want you to do this for me,” Steve’s says warmly, voice a blanket. “Can you touch your neck for me, sweetheart? Behind your ears, the way I know you like.”
“Yes,” he groans, thrusting. He braces his hand on Tony’s back, as if building up to something big, and then just – pulls out, and back in. “You feel so good, baby. So good. Such a tight fucking hole – “
Steve shakes his head. “You can’t kill Gus,” he insists “you can’t, he’s the only one who knows where—”
“Stupid, desperate little bitch,” another alpha laughs. He takes Tony’s other leg, so they’re spread. He starts spiralling patterns with his finger. He unhooks the garter from the belt.
Steve cups his chin, rubs in a spot of dried come where it made it's way down his neck. "I bet you are." He hums "You were so perfect for me, you know. The most beautiful sub in the whole world."
“Hey, hey,” Steve chides, gripping Tony’s chin, lifting it while his eyes slide desperately to the peripherals, refuse to meet his gaze. “Feeling better? Got some of that energy out, huh?”
Tony groans, rolling onto his back. “You don’t even realise, when I saw you in that cell. You just wanted to keep me safe. You were so scared.”
They sip their drinks in companionable silence. Tony eats his toast, makes small-talk about what people wore, and who’s been fucking who, and where money changed hands. Steve is content to listen to him. He doesn’t know why, but recently he’s felt on borrowed time with Tony, like he needs to make every second count. Shut his eyes and remember exactly how he sounds, in these moments, when he’s just talking.
Tony’s playing one of Steve’s old favourites, something soft, The Ink Spots or Fitzgerald. He’s humming, quietly cleaning up what looks like the remains of another Incident. The suite is spotless though, and he’s laid out flowers on the coffee table, set Steve’s books neatly on the kitchenette’s island. “You shouldn’t strain yourself,” Steve says when he enters, hoping the comment will be well received and not taken as an insult, like so much of what he says is nowadays.
Natasha nods. “Yeah,” she nods, quiet, still. “I guess — I guess your getting kinda old for it now, anyway.”
“I’m sure,” Pierce says heavily, throwing him down onto a couch, “that those boys will work it out, hmm? Of course – you know the truth by now, I’m sure. Unless you don’t remember. You did look pretty,” Pierce comments, pouring himself a finger from a heavy glass decanter, “when he was kissing you. I think I’m going to have him breed you. Good genes.”
You idiot, the first voice sneers, you idiot, you idiot, you idiot, did you really think it would work? They won’t let you die they’ll never let you die this is your punishment, it’s your punishment and you have to take it like a man.
His throat hurts, the burn raw and pulsing. “I want a painkiller,” he chatters, numbly, “I’m tired. Give them to me.”
Tony looks in the mirror and wants to throw up. His ribs stick out of his skin, his eyes are rimmed by purpling shadows. He hasn’t shaved himself in weeks, and the result is a permanent fuzz over his jaw because no one will go near him with razors.
Pierce sighs. Folds his paper, fishes out – Tony’s cellphone. “You can tell him that,” he says. “He called me last night, you know. He finished his mission, couldn’t get a hold of you. Thought I might know where you’d gone.”
Steve smiles at that. There is an air of Thor around the dog, big and bulky with his long haired plume. He seems regal, loyal – like Thor, wherever he is.
“Well I think it’s admirable.” Tony says loudly, kicking Steve under the table. “Right, Nat?” He calls as she pushes open the door carrying something large, square, and steaming.
Tony clears his throat. He subtly tilts his head to the left, flicks his eyes to where Steve is standing. “Sure,” he says, pointedly, “
almost forms full-fledged in his brain. But he loses it quickly, and he doesn’t want to waste his sentences on stupid sentiments. Instead, he knocks his head against Steve’s, and then his nose against his nose.
In his dreams, this bunker is locked and buried. There are no friendly faces, or apple slices. There’s only Pierce.
“You had a bad dream,” Steve says, lowly. “You’re exhausted, you’re still wounded. Tensions are running high, Tony. You’re not crazy. I would worry if you didn’t have any emotion at all.”
He’s temped to throw it in the trash, but he wants to see it, like ripping off a band-aid. What’s the worst it could be? A framed photo, maybe, one of the awful ones Tony’s let him take of him drooling and bound with a tie, like he’s a puppy, a lamb for slaughter. He flips through, tries to find the lurid sketches of him, legs spread wide, or riding Steve’s cock, or lips spread obscenely with a gag.
He spends the day on the couch. He has it all set up – tablet, and TV, laptop, bottled water, three blankets. He doesn’t often leave the couch. It’s fine, he’s just tired. He’s eats bagged chips off his chest and snorts at clips of fat dogs on youtube. He must fall asleep like that, drifting in and out, because he pills make him drowsy. When he slides back into consciousness, it’s darker, his fingers are still covered in stale cheese, and someone is requesting access to his apartment.
“A few – a couple days, I guess.” Tony hasn’t left his bed in a while. Not since that night, with the drawings.
he thinks. And then, as he walks away, Peter Parker and Thor and Pepper and Rhodes leading the trail, he says, “I’m sorry.” And no one hears. But it’s all he can do.
But on the good nights? Tony would dance, and he would laugh, and Steve would laugh with him. He would swing Steve around the floor of his small apartment, clear out the couches and coffee table so they could dance. Tony would rifle through Steve’s records, bring his own, ones he bought as a teenager and out of sentimentality never threw away. He keeps them at Steve’s so they’re always ready to play.
He slips the kettle off the stove, pours it into the mug. It’s old, and whatever had been emblazoned on the side has worn off with age. He thinks one of Clint’s kids might have painted it for him, but he’s guilty to admit he can’t remember which one. He knows it had been a clumsy shield, with the words America No.1!, and for some reason he still uses it, all these years later.
Pierce eases his head back down onto his shoulder. “You are,” he says, succinctly. “You’re not like other omegas, are you Tony?”
he says, but warmly, full of familiarity. Stark and Rogers. “Bad dream,” he tells him, “just a bad dream.”
They travel in silence, and as the sky darkens it begins to rain, light at first, and then just heavy. Steve puts on the radio, asks Tony is there’s anything he would prefer, and when he gets no answer settles on an eighties music station that he knows Tony likes. The windscreen wipers push away rain from the window. Tony rests his head on the door and appears to fall asleep.
Tony pushes his good hand beneath him, against the table-top. Forces himself straight. Pierce is right. He won’t be able reach him, not in this state.
It’s rustic, Tony thinks to himself. Cells (cages) line the sandy coloured walls. The floor is cobbled stone. Braziers light the walls, throwing deep shadows and creating sharp contrasts. Turn the corner, and there is the place where the torture really happens. The room is L-shaped, so that Diana can keep her victims and the actual act separate.
“I think you’re human,” Tony says, quietly. “I’ve stopped putting anyone on a pedestal. Maybe you should, too.”
Thor turns away like he hasn’t heard. “Last time I was here, we parted as friends. What went wrong?”
He’s carrying him. To where? The car. They’ll go home in the car, he thinks. Steve hates the parties, he won’t make him. They’ll eat popcorn on the couch and watch TV. Steve will forget to take off his socks when they go to sleep.
“No,” Gus says “it’s not. Because, one night, Mother found me. Smuggling out two twins. Do you know what they did to — ” Gus cuts off.  “And I knew what she was. And she told me that she’d been watching my work. That she was interested in my theory. And that she could offer me so much more.”
And they give out, just about. Pierce wraps his arm around his waist, has Rumlow slide himself against his other side. Tony wants to recoil. “Is he going to be okay?” He asks, because he can still hear Steve roaring, the thumping vibrations of his body as he screams for Tony, throwing himself against the walls.
“I don’t – think he’s not good company. I think what you see of him, for an hour of each day, is not the Tony – he can be difficult,” Steve gets out, eventually. “I don’t mean this to patronise him or you, but especially with something like seeing the graves. He’ll be angry, and upset. He’s better, but his moods can still go south. Miss Donnelly, I’m just trying to give you some warning that you’ll be responsible for him and, God, look there’s a very real chance he might try to step in front of a car.”
I don’t have many happy memories. I remember once you shaking me, though, trying to wake me up. I batted you away, of course. But still, you covered me in a blanket.
The – man, on the line sighs. “Ross,” he says, and then, when he must realise that isn’t helpful: “General Ross. We met, a few years back. You bought a bar.”
Steve looks up. “I’ve been meaning to say,” he starts, “when he was – after he used the gauntlet. I know he wasn’t – that he wasn’t all there, but what you said to him? When you told him, that we would be okay, that he could rest?”
But then he’s wrapping his flamed hand around his neck, squeezing. And Tony’s – the skin of his throat catches fire while he chokes to death. He’s screaming in agony, but he can’t breathe. His hair is plastered to his head, his scent is raw fear, and Killian starts prepping the syringe with his teeth, splitting his fingers so he can place inject right into Tony’s throat.
“Alright,” Steve backs off, gives in easily. “I’ve just been doing a lot of reflection, is all. I’m glad to hear that you like it. Or that you liked it. That – it’s as good for you as it is for me.”
She sits him down in a living room and brings him coffee. It’s still cold outside, but someone has been by and already warmed the house for them. Tony doesn’t question how it came fully furnished with Tony’s favourite appliances, but later he will think Steve had something to do with it.
Tony wipes the back of his hand across his mouth. Maybe he hasn’t been eating so good, that’s true. The trip back with Nebula, all he had were the weird, green squids that turned his stomach. Here, all he’s had is soup. “I guess I could stand to eat,” he whispers.
Ty’s face falls. See, he always did have this – uncanny ability to make you feel like you were the centre of his world, the most important thing in existence, until you told him no. Tony has met toddlers who take being told no better than Ty.
Steve sucks on the skin apologetically, blows air over the likely forming bruise. He draws back. “Do you want me to continue?” He asks.
He doesn’t eat, or drink. When Steve snaps, breaks his promise, and tries to get him to take his pills he resolutely shuts his mouth, shuts his eyes, won’t listen to a thing Steve asks. He doesn’t leave the bed at all, not even for toilet breaks, and that’s when Steve finds himself dialling the clinic. Two days down, each spent in bed, Tony not responding to him, to Natasha, certainly not to anyone else, and there’s a doctor asking him calmly if it was too soon, and if Steve would prefer to have Tony committed once more.
A slight breeze lifts the hair on Tony's head, the back of his neck prickles; in that moment he feels something pass through him, over him. He thinks about death. He remembers the life after closing. And he smiles, because although some things fade away, no one is ever truly gone.
“I’m not attacking you,” Steve says, sounding strange. Gentle – that’s why, he sounds gentle. “I’m not accusing you of anything. I’m grateful. But I don’t want you hurt, not on my account, alright?”
he hisses, fierce. “And the way he was trying to get you into that room with Rogers, I knew he was. Figured maybe, he thought it was for the best but didn’t want to be obvious about, because of the risks. Course, now we know what he wanted. For Rogers to go hard on you, or worse. Figured, if he did that…”
Tony narrows his eyes. To see him? He tries to think what that could mean. “Clothes on,” he says, bluntly.
Tony shakes his head again. No. He can’t. You can’t understand the shame until you’ve lived it. He doesn’t want to see recrimination, or worse, pity, in Steve’s eyes.
“You must be hurting,” the voice says, careful and soothing “you must hurt so much. When I lost my maker, I cried for weeks, oh, it was awful. But to loose an imprint as well? Tragic. Your agony must be unbearable.”
“You’ve lost everything,” Pepper whispers, and the words curl over Tony’s mind, dissipate, he can’t think what they mean. There’s a fire, somewhere, he can feel the heat on one side of his body, not quite burning, but too hot to be comfortable. It’s okay, though. He can manage.
Tony taps the flat face of the device twice and it lights up with the Stark Industries logo. “Needs an update, but sure. Wasn’t he in prison or something?”
He blinks blurrily, lets Steve wrap him in a towel. He brushes some water away from his brow, stops it from running into his eye. “You want anything?” He murmurs.
Steve kisses him. Steve has never kissed him before, not like this – not outside of being rammed on his back, or dicked against a wall. His tongue does most of the work, his arm curling behind Tony’s waist, his teeth pulling at Tony’s lower lip. He feels exhausted, spent, and now this – it’s easy to relinquish. To let go, and lean into it.
He’s lying awake in bed, straining to hear the voices. Yeah, he hears them. He recognises Natasha straight away, and the thought of having to talk to her doesn’t panic him. There is another voice there, though. Lower, but somehow stranger, mumbled. Wanda? No, surely not. He hears Sarah tell them that he’s still asleep, that maybe they should have called ahead, but she’s sure Tony won’t mind. He hears her say that he’s feeling much better, that most days now you wouldn’t think there was anything wrong at all, and Natasha should relay the message to Steve and Tony’s friends.
He drains his drink. The main hall is thronging with people, and Tony is late. He finds Killian entertaining a crowd. He seems surprised to see him. “Could I have a word?” He asks, and makes sure his lips touch his ear when he speaks.
The house is detached, framed by a sizeable amount of land. A short driveway and double doors, four bedrooms, Tony’s scattered mind notes that there are too many bedrooms for just him and Sarah. Too many bedrooms. Should just be two, too much room is — places for people to hide. He doesn’t like it.
Days pass like this. Weeks. Tony, inevitably, puts on weight. His mind – while not shaking itself of lingering fears, paranoia, and crippling depression – starts to stitch itself back to together. The days have structure and clarity. He starts to read again. He starts to have higher thinking processes again. He starts walking, and is shocked to see that spring has been and gone, and the days are getting warmer, the sun longer, the flowers already bloomed.
“Even after everything? You would do that, for me.” And Tony sounds so disbelieving it hurts, it doubles Steve’s resolve.
Tony shrugs. “Tried to starve myself. Tried to… drown myself. Starve myself a bit more. Drink bleach. Bang my head against a wall. Starve myself, again.”
His voice isn’t that good, being honest. Not bad, but too low to hit notes right. It’s strong, though. Earthy. Like rock. Pure stone.
They sleep. Tony comes-to slowly, frowning, unsure – he’s warm, too warm. Steve’s arms are heavy, hot. And tightening. Tighter and tighter.
And then Tony starts rattling off a litany of conditions. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, angina, something about restricted lung capacity and a shoulder that is stiff no matter what Tony does. His back, he says, is fucked after ten years of having it screwed in his suit. He tells Steve that sometimes his heart beats so hard against his chest it feels like his ribs are going to snap. “I’m surprised you don’t hear it,” he says, as if that makes it any clearer. “Essentially, I’m crumbling, Steve.”
Steve slaps him, three fingers, once, twice, against his cheek. Tony’s prick is so fucking hard, he can feel the slick wet on his thighs, thick inside his hole, slipping out of him humiliatingly, dribbling onto the concrete. “You like that, yeah?” Steve says roughly, gripping his hair, shaking him. “You like it when I treat you like that, Stark?”
“Then I’m glad we could have this discussion.” The hands are pulled away. Steve briskly rubs at Tony’s back, brushing down any errant feathers. He doesn’t feel compelled to say any words of parting. But Tony lies there still, for some long minutes afterwards; the sun is slipping behind some building or other, but it’s warm on the back of his neck. Where Steve’s hand had been.
“I wasn’t tuning out anything,” Tony says heavily. “I was bored. Not bored, just – I wasn’t giving it my full attention, okay? And it has nothing to with anything that’s in my file, and I liked what happened afterwards, I give my full consent for you to spring all kinds of dirty shit on me whenever you like, and let’s leave it at that, okay?”
“If you can call it that,” Killian interrupts, standing. He brushes down his jacket, seemingly unnerved. “Captain,” he says, holding out his hand, “an honour, of course.”
Steve pulls at his bowtie, shrugs off his tux jacket. “You look so fucking sweet, and you have no idea.”
Diana hums, sits herself in a chair, that same chair Gus had sat in once upon a time. “Yes,” she says “I suppose he is. A pity. Death is too clean cut, I wanted to torture him. I wanted to make him suffer.”
so he makes this disturbing noise with the back of his throat instead. But that must not reassure Nick, because he tests the door, rattling it.
Diana smoothes his back with a soft hand. Pushes his cheek down onto the stone. “This might sting a little,” she says sweetly and then she gets to work.
Pierce smiles at him. “You do,” he agrees, nodding. “You certainly do. Here – sit, please. Can I get you anything else?”
Tony stumbles, going for the pilot's seat. Clint catches him, gently easing him back "Ah ah ah," he says "no, not you. You're sitting here today."
Steve steps closer into Tony’s personal space, between his legs. Looks down at him, sitting at the bar like he is. Any more, and their chests will touch. “Do you want something from me, Tony? Is that it?”
Bruce swallows. “I think – ” he looks at each of them meaningfully “what Steve means it thank you, for, for the effort.”
Tony quirks his lips. “Just consider that a gift, buddy. Don’t expect it again unless you do something really spectacular.”
Tony’s head falls forward, his brow against Steve’s, shivery, sweating, panting. “I don’t sleep well,” he blurts, “I don’t sleep well these days. That’s why I’ve been waiting up.”
That’s reassuring. Steve is stroking his skin. “I love having you like this,” Tony hears himself say, voice distant, slipping into sleep. “It’s all I want.”
Thor rounds on Clint. The air crackles, and almost bursts. Natasha’s hair is floating in air, standing on end, and Clint looks like he’s been electrocuted. “Don’t be simple,” he says heavily. “Where I come from, fighting side by side with a man is enough to bind you together for life.”
“Do not tell me,” Fury continues, pressing, “that having the Captain at your back isn’t its own reward. You know that it is.”
Steve’s hands pull away. “I shouldn’t do all the work,” he says, “after all, you’re the one wanting to make reparations.”
“Uh, Rhodey hold on. Just give me a sec, I’m handing you to Sarah.” She nearly snatches it from him, wrenching it desperately from his grip.
“Cute. I think I’d rather keep the dominance play to myself, thanks. Plus, there’s spunk in my eyelashes.”
to you, I will try. In return – I just need a little help with the Captain. Don’t you think, now of all times, having someone like him to guard your back is one of the best things?”
"Here." Steve says softly, fingers gently pressing against a wound at the front of Tony's head. "It's bad. They have you on painkillers, right? Christ, I'm going to kill them, where'd the nurse go?"
They follow the others out of the room, Ty watching Steve’s back down the hallway. And then he’s pulling him to the side, pushing him against the wall in a way that – it’s okay when Steve does it.
"I hope you're okay." She says again "You won't remember this, will you? Fine. But anyway. I hope you're not too scrambled."
Anyway. He drinks tea. He never much cared for coffee; it’s bitter, leaves a funny taste in your mouth he never accustomed to. Once, in cold camps, with damp clothes and 12-hour patrols, he’d probably needed it. But at some point he figured, hey, I don’t like coffee, I don’t need coffee, why bother?
The man is ducking through the crowd, past the bar, heading for the exit. With this in mind, Steve pushes out of the fire-escape; when the man comes, walking hurriedly down the alley-way, looking over his shoulder like a worried dog, Steve is already waiting.
Tony feels warm. “Yeah,” he says, answering the question. “She was. I could probably trace back to the Mayflower,” he laughs.
“He’ll have the suit,” Ross says, “we’ll make sure it’s in there, any funny business and it’ll knock him flat on his back, won’t it, Stark?”
He stubs his cigarette on the wall, flicks it into a puddle. “Richards,” he says, slowly. “What’s the matter? I didn’t say anything to offend you, did I?”
Secondly, Tony, I am concerned for you. From an objective point of view, you must think me hypocritical. Possibly negligent. However, from what I can see you drink too much. I fear you may be taking drugs. Please, Tony, you have to stop. I know that maybe you’re bored, or maybe there are other reasons, reasons that as your mother I should have addressed. I have not been a good mother, I am fully aware. Never let it be said that I am not achingly, acutely, aware of how I have failed my only son.
“Immanent,” Steve agrees, but his throat is croaky. He’s upset, Tony realises. “It’s like sometimes, I don’t know… I can see the line, and I know I shouldn’t cross the line, then one thing leads to another and – “
“I did,” Tony mutters, balling his hands into fists. “I did try. Almost had him. We almost had him, and the Quill fucked it up – “
Rubble is rubble. There’s barely anything left to salvage. Steve has most of his stuff at his apartment in the city, but all of Natasha’s clothes are gone, her possessions, anything even close to having something to remember her by. Still, on his bad days, he and Bucky pick through the mess, the scene of the war. They find some things: remarkably, some of Steve’s old pencils, muddied but intact. The remains of some jumpers that might have been Vision’s, the Banana Republic tag still visible. A lockbox, unmarred, made of solid vibranium.
"I think," Tony sighs as Steve works out a kink from his neck "I think it comes under objectification. Just -- there. Keep working that spot, would you?"
He rolls, curls gently on his side, arms loose and fingers lax, curled softly. The furs are soft against his cheek.
No no no, the second voice will say, you know Steve is damaged, Tony, you know that. You know he’s always been damaged, were you really surprised when he chose Barnes? All those nights he cried in your arms because of what he had lost, he’s just as damaged as you are, and he needs help, he needs your help, what you have is still so salvageable –
“It’s okay, Bucky, he’s right. We’re woefully unequipped to deal with this. Looking around – everything’s a danger. Knives, forks, scissors. The sink, he could try to drown himself in the sink, the bath. The windows need to be locked, Christ, even the sharp edge of a table would be enough.”
I love you. You are my only child. You are the only legacy I have left to give. And I should have chased you tonight. After Howard smashed that bottle on your head, I should have chased you down. Told you this in person. Maybe you won't read this for many, many years. Maybe after Howard dies we grow close. I would like that, Tony. To get to know you as a friend. God knows, I've failed you as a mother. I want to see the man you will grow to be.
He pokes the wet silk with his tongue, forces it out of his mouth, tasting of scotch. It falls into his lap. He picks up his head.
“To my apartment,” Steve corrects. “I would like my sheets to smell of you, Tony. I’d like to just – have you in my bed. In
Tony shrugs. "It's nice to know you're here for me. Not for... I don't know. Not for whatever reason vampires imprint."
Tony smiles and lets Sarah’s words smooth over him, mixing like thick syrup in a warm drink. She talks about her mother and father back home, she talks about her brother in Canada and her two nephews. She always steers clear of current events, something that marks her as far more astute than her ramblings would suggest, and can happily pass the hour while Tony squeezes his hands into fists and struggles to write his name.
“Here,” Rhodes is saying, gently, “you’re okay, buddy.” He closes Tony’s eyes. He holds his hand. “Cap,” he says, “I can’t carry him.”
Tony straightens, wipes the back of his hand across his mouth as if the repeated action will bring down his obviously swollen lips, his flushed cheeks, sweaty brow, submissive demeanour, like a bitch that just got their ass handed to them. “How do I look?”
It’s locked, but Tony panics, thinks he’ll manage to open it and see him, the stupid fucking mess he’s made. He grunts at him, like an animal, pushes back against the door, but in haste he catches his hand in the shower curtain, pulls too hard, brings the whole thing crashing down.
Tony thinks, with an omegan sense of smug satisfaction. See how good he is for his alpha? The best. “You said, before – something about me reminding you of someone? You stopped yourself.”
Tony nods, sleepily. He’s drooled on the glass counter-top, his head tucked into the crook of his arm. “Mmm hmm,” he agrees.
So, updating will be sporadic as this is the time of year that real life kinda catches up with me. But this is not abandoned, ever. If you ever wonder, just drop me a line asking and I'll make sure to fill you in with when it might be updating. Also, we're getting into the real plot here so please comment to tell me what you think!
"He's thrown up." Clint says, and Tony hears the smack of a metal bin opening and closing. "Clean him up."
“I was thinking, Tony,” Sam says, and Tony thinks he must be talking to him. “I could take you to see Rhodes, if you want. He’s unchanged, but… I don’t know. I like to think it would do him some good.”
Steve jumps, flips forward, rolls on automatic, braced for an attack and that’s when he sees Gus’ body, lying on the ground, limbs splayed and faced down. He lifts his head, blinks hard, squints.
Tony ducks his head, blushing, so fucking sweet when he's under like this. "D'you mean that?" He asks, resting his chin in Steve's hand.
It's a repetitive theme: Tony wants to have the right answer. He'll do whatever he thinks will please Steve best. Sometimes, it's led to issues. When Tony gets like this, and he's so eager to please, it's difficult for him to judge what he really wants.
He feeds his hands up Tony ribs beneath the shirt, holding him steady. The touch of him feels good – intimate, somehow, more intimate than being screwed on the floor was. Maybe it’s the close proximity, the fact he can see Steve eyes, smell his arousal.
He’s stupid, though. He doesn’t figure it out right away. It’s not until late evening that he’s letting himself into Steve’s apartment, trailing his way to the bedroom, scotch and tumbler in hand.
Tony's lips part without a thought. He stretches his mouth wide, waiting for whatever Steve wants. "Stick out your tongue."
He sighs. "There are lots of moving pieces," he starts. "For starters, most of it hinged on a rat pressing the right buttons with its fat ass. So, just to give you a sense of the scale, Tony Stark only got to even give his life because a rodent was looking for a snack."
Tony nods. His dreams were pleasantly without fear, and instead he’d dreamt of nothing at all. She sets a heavy plate in front of him, packed with bacon, fried eggs, waffles, syrup, blueberries. It’s obscene. There’s also a glass of orange juice in a clean cup. Tony swallows. He doesn’t know how he can eat all of this.
Steve won’t let himself waste away. Having witnessed Tony’s decline, he knows he can’t just spend the rest of his life in bed. It would be hypocritical. There are things he needs to do, people who deserve his help. But currently he’s stuck between feeling like the scummiest individual to have ever walked the planet, coupled by the fact that without Tony life feels very much empty, purposeless, and without meaning.
“Sam, then.” Sam is the obvious answer, the perfect answer, a spotless military record and a close friend.
“I – I didn’t really try,” Steve admits. “When I saw him, I knew what I had to do, and – and I don’t think they’ll want to have me back.”
It's so sweet, the way he trusts. Steve runs a hand through his hair, sighs. He wonders what goes through a subs mind when they're like this. He knows all the scientific literature, of course, certain states trigger hormones that send the sub under, but he can't imagine. A dom high and a sub dropped... those are two very different feelings.
before, hadn’t we? Just briefly. I felt like we had something, and I know I’m a… slow adjuster, I know…”
“I asked, are you okay? When was the last time you changed your dressing? Have you been taking your pills?”
“This must be so hard for you,” Pierce seems to smirk. “An alpha like you, sitting there, hands on your knees like a good boy. Biology seems to dictate that, at a certain point, an alpha like you would come to throw me down. But, here we are.”
He bends him over the railing, spanks him once, twice. “I’d put you over my knee if I had a chair,” he says casually, “act like a child, get treated like a child.”
Tony pitches forward, hands fisting in Steve’s shirt. “He’s in my head,” he hisses, “don’t you understand? He’s been in my head, all these years, ever since I sent that nuke into space and saw it all, that death, and the pain, and the sinking black holes of a collapsing star – “
“Absolutely.” Tony agrees, and he gives a shaky laugh. “But I mean, realistically. I was eating a sit-down dinner with Captain America. That’s, I mean, an assassin cooked my food, and a man who turns into a monster when he’s angry was sitting beside me. And it’s – you wanted to be there, you wanted – ”
When he doesn’t rouse, she kicks him, hard in the side. He chokes, gasps, clutches at his belly. Oh, he had been wounded. Of course, she remembers now. Maybe he’s still hurt, and that’s why he does not move. A better reason, than patheticness.
“Imagine. If only you had changed him when you had the chance,” she says, reaching for a blood filled goblet “then he could still be alive.”
He’s been working with SHIELD for some three months; as expected, it’s been better for him. He spends most of his time in New York, averages one mission a week – plenty of space to get out that energy, lead a team the way he’s bred to do, and still have time for Tony in-between.
Tony sits, and Steve stands, hands in his pants’ pockets, looking down. Judgement, which is what he deserves. “Can I get you anything?”
Tony regards him, eyes half-shut. “Hmm?” He says, rolling his head upright from where it had been heavy against his shoulder. “Oh, Cap. I must’ve… uh, must’ve just passed out.”
“There isn’t a cure,” Steve blurts “when we save Tony, he’s gonna run, he won’t, there isn’t a cure, there isn’t—”
You might want to watch out torture in this one. There's not buckets of blood, but still. Just in case.
“I’ll make it up to you,” he breathes, slightly dazed with the tight proximity, Steve’s crazy out-pour of pheromones intense enough to make a nun blush. “I deserve punishment, huh? I deserve – you to make me yours again – “
The skin of his palm is surprisingly smooth beneath Tony’s fingertip. No callouses, not even one. “And I guess, it showed I… wasn’t in control of that situation. If you understand what I mean.”
One day, Tony is distracted. He doesn’t touch the sashimi Steve knows he loves. He picks at ginger and doesn’t put it anywhere near his mouth, and so sensing that it might be one of those days, the days where Tony isn’t quite right, Steve talks more to compensate.
“I know,” Tony soothes, stroking his hair with both hands, holding him clasped against his chest, their bodies pressed together, legs intertwined. “I know you do, Steve. You will. You’re going to go home, and you’ll be – “ Tony’s throat is thick, he shuts his eyes. “You’ll be happy, I promise.”
I've been considering a sequel to this since I have plot bunnies that are just, ugh, not leaving my head but that I can't fit in here without an overkill. If you have any opinions, please leave them below!
would really like to know what people can tell about tony's history -- like, what was the picture, what do u think happened, etc. it helps me know if i'm showing enough without telling, if that makes sense
Tony looks mildly irritated, the way he always does when Steve launches into a monologue. “Sure,” he says. Steve doesn’t think he means it.
Tony slides down the wall, grips the bruise where Steve’s fingers had held him. “It’s okay, I’m fine, please don’t – “
He moves him, picks up his wrists to pull off his shirt, slides it out from under his shoulders. Tony’s arms fall limply back onto the bed when he’s done. He drags down Tony’s pants, inch by inch. Then there’s a hand in his hair:
And Steve is so relieved. “Natasha said she’ll take you shopping. To – you know, to get new stuff. You’ll need some shirts, jeans, shoes. We’ll get you a new suit. It’ll – “
Tony does feel tired. Very, very tired. Tired enough that it's a struggle to keep his eyes open. "Okay." He murmurs.
Tony does. He slices potatoes and cheese and kale and makes an omelette. He pours two mugs of coffee, and carries it to the bedroom, Mosely at his heels. “Knock knock,” he says.
“Honestly?” Tony throat is raw. “I kinda want to be remembered for something other than – being an omega. For doing something perfectly ordinary, something alphas and betas do every day, but doing it with – get this – a multi-purpose reproductive system.”
“Tortured,” Gus slurs, suddenly, “tortured and carved open and,” he sniffs, inhales deeply “you smell so good,” he whispers, and in the light Steve can see where Gus’ pupils fill with black. It’s macabre, especially with the way the scars run down his face.
“Just so I get this clear: you ask me a question you know I can’t answer because you want to give me a little monologue on your favourite decade?”
He just watches him, warily. Fury forces off another wedge, puts it in his mouth. Waves the orange in his hand, then pointedly, purposefully, leans across the table. Sets it at the end.
By the time he’s done, Tony’s a shivering wreck. Steve tucked his thumbs into places he rarely lets others go, has had his feathers smoothed, muscles dug into shape. His eyes are shut, he’s half-way gone. I hate you, he thinks drowsily, but he doesn’t mean it. He hates this, maybe. The circumstances. The arbitrariness of it all.
“A real promise. Now would you finish that cake please? Christ, I don’t know how you’ve managed to lose more weight since Christmas.”
“No,” Tony blurts, taking his hand. That’s too oblique for him. Rhodey has always done this, always told Tony straight, social conventions be damned. “No, that’s pointless. You were sick. Dying, actually, because of me. Because you took that fall — “
He scrambles from the bed, lunges for her in her chair, he is going to strangle her throat, tear her head from her neck and yet the fast movement leaves him gasping, reeling with pain. He clutches his stomach, cries out and collapses on the floor, on all fours with one hand pressed to his belly.
Good going, the first voice sneers. You couldn’t even ask her about her dad, you whiny little cunt. How can you ever expect her to –
Ouch. Steve’s nail is digging into Tony’s left nipple – his eyes fly open, he makes a noise of pain. It’s gone as soon as it comes; Steve lunges up to press a soft kiss against the skin, lingering.
They had posed for photographs but hadn’t spoken. Steve noted that Tony had lost weight. He thought that he looked more haggard than usual.
“Of course.” Pierce watches him carefully, maybe, or maybe just pausing for thought. “You want the best for him.”
“Are you okay? I got in yesterday and Jarvis said he hadn’t even heard from you, not in hours, and that you never came back from Pierce’s party. I worried, sorry, I worried, alright? You know how I get.”
“I don’t think it,” Tony answers, but his heart’s not really in it, not when Steve is dragging a nail across the sensitive join where wing-bone meets skin.
He tips his head forward, so their brows touch. Steve’s breathing is good and slow, and they’re in tandem. Almost as one. He can feel his breath against his lips. His heart under his hand. What does he choose, then?
Cold. He realises it’s cold, and that there’s snow in his hair, stuck in his shoes. He’s shivering, pushing through the line. He thinks this is the right place. The first one thought
He lips by his ear. “At night,” he’s saying, kissing the shell of his ear, punctuating his words. “You’ll sleep at my feet. It’s the safest you’ll ever feel. And you’ll love it.” He strokes his hand down Tony’s chest, releases his throat. “And that’s my fantasy,” he says, louder.
He figures, it’s Steve’s way of saying thanks. Which is sad, really. That neither of them have the words to say what they mean.
There’s a hand in his hair. “Just sleep,” the woman whispers, the new one “it’ll feel like falling asleep.”
Steve doesn’t answer. He crouches, peers through the history of Tony’s life. Old birthday cards, school reports. A bundle of photos, thick, wrapped with twine. The first is Tony, small, eyes like a deer in the headlights, holding a screwdriver; he has the same look Morgan had, when she’d fiddled with the Rubik’s cube. Steve chokes. “Oh,” he says, “I forgot he had these.”
The man opens his mouth as if to speak. Then laughs. “No reason,” he says, holding up his hands. “Apologies, Captain.”
"I'll be right as rain after breakfast." Tony says, trying for a smile. "Ah -- thank you. For this."
Tony finds himself responding. I don’t have so much more to do, he says, how can I do anything? I have no money, I’m hated. Everything I tried to fix I made worse, no one wants my help. I’m tired, I’m tired, why do you keep fighting with me I’m so tired.
“Nah, you didn’t,” Tony is panting, gasping when he seats himself slowly, inch by inch on Steve’s cock. “You’re so fucking
They’re in front of Killian’s door. He’s fumbling for his key. “Actually,” Tony says, shaking his head, “God. I’m sorry. I just have – the worst headache.”
“He’s paid for your treatment,” Sarah snaps. “He deserves to know. I thought you were with him. Where the hell were you? I was worried sick. You couldn’t have even left a note — “
Sarah’s sessions are the highlight of Tony’s day. An hour, no matter how brief, or taxing, spent away from the rest of them, without the weight of Steve’s desperate hope and everyone else’s judging stares. It’s just nice to talk to someone who isn’t a – superperson. Who isn’t wrapped up in the running of the world, but instead worries about what they’re going to have for dinner, and their father’s poor health, and what they should do for Christmas.
“Like, uh,” Tony smirks. He explains exactly how they tied him, and how it felt, and what they did to him after he was all dozy and hot and desperate.
Steve opens his eyes. Yes, from his angle his coat is bent over Tony’s chair, and clear as day, poking out the inside pocket, is his glock. “Well,” he says, carefully, “you told me the alpha’s could be mean.”
“Gone? Yeah, she’s gone. Happy’s alive, for whatever the fuck that’s worth. But she’s gone. Alone, at her desk, waiting for me to call and – “
“Oh,” Steve’s face clears, “well in that case, it’s good to meet you. I didn’t realise you knew each other.”
“Fine, okay, you weren’t there to convince him yourself. But there would have been a deal, right? You would have – slept with him, and in return…”
Tony slits open his eyes. He can see just a touch of the soldier’s skin. Stubble. When his eyes start playing tricks on him, and the stubble seems to grow flowers, he shuts them. There’s music. The soldier is – gentle. He shifts his grip. His fingers do not dig into Tony’s waist, but hold him. Careful. Precise.
Tony doesn’t know what to say. “You’re home,” he tries to soothe, reaching out to hold Steve’s face, stroke his hair. “Steve, you’re
Tony seems to accept this, solemn, quiet, lips pressed into a line. It’s his duty. Tony is man of duty, if nothing else.
He’s started waiting up for him. He’s not sure why. Maybe because he feels sorry for him, or he likes goading him, likes ruining that itchingly perfect façade. Maybe, it’s because he can’t sleep these days, and every night there’s a wormhole in the dark behind his eyelids, pulsing and growing and twisting bright blue and black.
“No, Tony,” Steve says, frustrated and showing it, “it’s not about who you want to – it’s not about who, it’s about why, and it’s the fact that after what I read I don’t know if you’ve ever been as in control as you say you are.”
“You’re probably wondering why I didn’t help you,” Pierce sighs, sorrowful, stroking Tony’s hair, petting him again and again like a dog on his lap. “The answer is, expediency. I knew, your father knew. Understand? He
Steve has to lever Tony into a wheelchair and settle him down, wrapped in a fluffy robe Clint had probably picked up from the quinjet supplies. "Where are we going?" He asks.
“I know it’s different for rich people. I mean – for people with money, and lineage, and empires. Tale as old as time. I know some people say, it’s kinder to bond you as soon as you have your first heat, but fifteen was young even by standards in my day – “
he doesn’t say. ‘Steve’, he hears in his head, Bucky’s stumbling, broken steps, before he crumbled and faded away.
Sure. Tony can do cards. He fishes out the pack from one of the kitchen drawers, throws it down onto the table.
“Knot you like you deserve, huh?” Steve is saying, pulling out, wet and sloppy, the air stinking of Tony’s scent, heavy with lust and something even worse – almost like a heat, the pheromones drawn out by Steve’s dominance play. “Use you.”
Gus sighs. “It was a town,” he says, tracing patterns in the stone “a village, basically. In, uh, Austria. I’m, I’m not German. I mean, my parents were. But I lived in Austria. I’m Austrian, really.”
Now, with his head slightly clearer, Tony is just puzzled. How can Sarah have this much patience for him? What has he got to offer her? He’s not rich, he has no power. He’s not charming anymore, nor is he good looking, not since the bags have taken permanent residence under his eyes and weight’s dropped off of him. What could she want? Why is she here?
And then, on any given morning, he suddenly can’t bring himself to leave his bed. Mosely wraps himself up across his legs, and Tony will stare vacantly at a wall. These episodes never last more than two days, but but every time they occur is a reminder that Tony is still ill, that there’s no quick cure, that this could go on for the rest of his life if unchecked.
Because you are my only child. Surreal to think about. There was a time all I wanted was a child of my own. And there were others; you know by now about the trees in my garden. You know why they were planted.
She’s lying, they both know it. But human decency stops her, even her, the assassin, from commenting on it.
And Tony jolts, back down to earth, into his body. He blinks, stares up at Sarah and – he can’t remember sitting down. “I’m sorry,” he says, trying to adjust. “I – what was the question?”
They fall back into silence. Tony thinks maybe Steve has gone to sleep – his own eyes feel heavy, contented. It’s such a fucking luxury to just be able to lie here this way.
There’s a thick thigh between his legs. His mouth droops open. He lifts his hands – and puts them on the shoulders in front of him. “Help me,” he tells him, and they twist their fingers in his hair, kiss him. It tastes like scotch, and southern fried chicken. When they pull away, Tony chases.
In lucid moments, Tony tries to think how exactly he got this bad. He tries to piece together his life. He thinks about his mom and dad, he thinks about Steve. He thinks about how not so long ago he was happy and full of hope.
And then the first voice. You don’t think that, it laughs, you don’t really think you’d be left alone? They’ll eat you alive. The press will be at your door every day, they’ll never, ever let you live alone. You will never have peace, or quiet, or a simple life, too late loser. There’s only one way you’re going to ever be alone, you know what to do, you know what to do, you know what to do –
Tony slides his hand past his cock, fingers gently rubbing slick around his rim. “I’m not very – vocal,” he admits.
Tony’s head is stuffed with clouds. Spirals behind his eyes. He groans, limbs solid rock, mouth slack.
Steve blinks. He fumbles for his cards, but his fingers are numb. They’re soaked through, and the ink has melted into the page. He squints, smooths them out, time ticks on.
