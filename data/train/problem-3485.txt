Without warning, the door swung open, and they all aimed their weapons at the sudden movement. In front of them stood an old man, maybe 80 or 90 years old with a white moustache that matched his duck-down head of hair.
“If we’re going to stay here another night, probably not.” Cas was adjusting his coat and started gathering up the few small things he’d brought inside to pack away safely in the cars.
He sunk back down, wrapping one hand around the base of Cas’ dick and moaning round his mouthful as Cas slowly pushed his hips forward again, holding Dean’s head in place. Dean flicked his eyes up to meet Cas’, gently nodding.
Suddenly, with one last drag of his palm, Cas let go and slid further down the bench. “I’ll let Bobby and Sam know,” he said, shuffling over to exit the other side.
“Any chance you could get us the rest of the way once we’re on empty? I don’t wanna use any of your mojo, but we might need a little help.”
“Hey,” he said, pulling back and holding the sides of his brother’s head, “Let’s get you cleaned up huh? I’ll be right back,” he said, jumping up to get his brother something to wipe the blood off of his face. He grabbed one of the clean rags soaking in the same bucket he’d passed to Bobby and rushed back inside. He found Sam pushing off the sheets and trying to sit up, his back to the door as Dean entered.
“This manifestation of my wings are more communicative than I would prefer them to be. They’ve been reacting to you, calling for you in ways my vessel does not.”
It punched the air right out of Dean’s lungs. He wanted to take a step back, needed to. It was a mistake, could be a disaster, but his legs were locked in place. So he just stood there and let his best friend run his hands over Dean’s jacket.
“I’ll make you something you’ll like,” Cas said, his eyebrows knitted together in a serious line. Dean paid—
They couldn’t sit on the tablet forever. Cas had a point—Afriel and Turiel, or someone else, maybe someone worse, would find them eventually. Dean still privately thought that they’d all be better off if they smashed the damn thing to pieces, but he didn’t mention it again because he didn’t want to stress out Cas.
Why was Cas making this so friggin’ complicated? He’d fucked up. He got it. Sam wasn’t letting him forget it. But if the guy would just answer him they could move on. He knew Cas was stubborn, but this was taking it too far. They were friends—hell, they were more than friends, they were brothers.
Sam’s hair was lank and greasy. It was longer than he normally kept it, which was no fault of his own—they were all in the same boat there—but even though Sam was a total nerd, Dean knew he still had a few vanities. He’d seen the tortoiseshell comb and the bottles of conditioner he’d pilfered from hotels in his bag. But this was a whole new look for Sam, one Dean didn’t like. His hair was pushed back to keep the stringy strands out of his face and the back of his head was dry and matted from twisting on his pillow. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d hosed off or changed his clothes.
“Get us as close as you can, and I’ll be able to get you home. With both of you and the supplies, but not the car,” Cas said, looking somewhat judgmentally at the cheap fabric upholstery.
I hope you all like this chapter. It's one of my all-time favourites in the fic and certainly one of the more personal things I've written. We so often see Dean Winchester drinking, and we so rarely get to see what the actual internal (and external) impact of alcohol abuse is—for Dean and for many other people. Although Dean's tried to put the case first, tried to put Cas first, he fell off the wagon a little bit here and he needs to face the consequences.
“As Sam said, my family is ‘busy upstairs’, and I doubt they are capable, or willing, to detract from the power of the host in their battle with Lucifer’s army.”
But before all of that, Cas and Sam had covered the trailer in sigils—Cas working from memory and Sam with his head half-buried in reference books. They also set up wards around the border of the park and Dean was pretty sure on any other surface they could find. If anything got to them here they’d have to be pretty damn powerful.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said quietly. He mimicked Dean’s pose against the car, close enough that their arms brushed the same way they had on the hood of the Honda his first night back. “I’m still trying to adjust to the way things are different. Here. With my vessel.”
“Oh, fuck, Cas, fuck me—” he choked out, digging his hands into Cas’ damp back as he shook with the heat of it, shooting streams of come across his stomach and chest.
Sam went quiet in the passenger’s seat. Not making any noise other than clearing his throat. He covered his face with the crook of his elbow to cough into it, only making things worse when he inhaled the fine dust that covered his jacket.
“Dean, I— can I—” the angel sounded pained, panting against his skin. When he looked up, only a small ring of blue was visible around blown-out irises.
“Well, hey there Captain Morgan, or whoever the captain of whiskey is,” she said, fresh as a goddamn daisy, as she handed him a hot cup of black coffee.
“We’re a little bit past halfway,” Cas said, Dundee-ing all over the place as he looked high up out of the car window to look at the sky after consulting his map.
—and Cas moved to the massive espresso machine to drag a damp cloth over the silver wand. He was still wearing his white dress shirt, but he’d rolled up the sleeves to keep them clean and Dean watched his forearms flex as he wiped away the drying foam.
“Your funeral,” Dean answered, clasping Cas on the shoulder as he walked past him. Inside, the house was dark. They tried to keep the lights out in the evening as often as possible to keep a low profile. Nothing attracted trouble faster than a lit-up house, and they’d learned that the hard way.
Cas kept his eyes locked on Henry until he returned to his chair and then turned his attention to the book in his lap.
“Dude, chill out.” Sam wrenched his brother back by the arm. Dean was pissed, but he was smarter than trying to fistfight a damn angel. He avoided looking at Cas’ face as he picked his chair up and sat back down, pushing away his embarrassment.
“I’m sorry, that took longer than I’d anticipated. I found more water.” He had a lap full of squeaking, plastic bottles and he was covered in dirt—different than the soot he’d already cleared away from the fire in the megastore. It was streaked along his jaw and his black hair was covered in a soft down of ash.
“There ain’t nothing for us here,” Bobby said. “We can’t even keep the damn door on that shack. This place was always going to be temporary, and this is as good a reason as any to leave.”
“Where’s the holy oil?” Sam asked, “I think there’s one more thing I can try, but I need the holy oil to finish the spell.”
“I’m just glad you shut the door this time,” Dean laughed, kissing Cas’ temple and breathing in his soft electric smell.
“His father, your grandfather, had some connection to the area. What it was, I don’t know,” Cas said with finality, leaning back and mirroring Dean’s pose.
It was an easy decision to spend another night in the Motel 6. It was cold, dark, and Dean didn’t imagine any of them could handle a night on the road. He knew he couldn’t.
“You good to move out?” Dean asked from the couch. The one good thing about this stinking trailer was that people were essentially never out of earshot. If you could consider that a good thing.
“Well, we need it.” He could tell Cas was pissed, but right now, Dean couldn’t bring himself to care. He loosened his tie and patted the empty stool next to him. “Take a load off, buddy.”
“Thank you. It’s good to see you too, Bobby,” Cas replied, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. They parted with Bobby giving Cas two familiar slaps on the back.
“Bad how?” Dean had been to hell. He’d faced Lucifer, and killed Death, and worked with his own dead father to end Azazel. He wasn’t worried about a binding spell. Not really.
It was still early in the day, but even this far from the coast the sky was still a deep, overcast grey. It was hard to see when everything blended together, the same muted tones, and Dean had to take it easy until he could get to open road he hoped was a few hundred feet on the other side. They crept slowly past makeshift shelters. No, not shelters, Dean realized. Piles of tires, stacked wood, and more sandbags piled high that were used for cover, to protect shooters. He bit the inside of his cheek and knew Sam was coming to the same realization. There were guns, empty, he assumed, dropped on the road, covered in the same dull residue that everything else was covered in, abandoned.
Dean shook the mostly-empty can when it was passed back to him, lifting it in a sarcastic cheers before draining the rest.
Dean’s dry eyes stung as he searched for something to say, but Sam spoke before he could. “If we stay, we face the real possibility of this happening again. And, Bobby, there’s something else.”
?” Dean spluttered. But on the white wrap-around porch, there they were. Two small wicker baskets filled with soft-looking, purple flowers, a burst of colour against the neutral tones of the home and the stark landscape it seemed almost painted into.
Dean wrapped one leg around Cas’ back, shaking at the low vibrations in his throat as the angel moaned around his dick.
“So, the Motel 6 it is,” Dean decided, ignoring the ache that was crawling from the back of his neck and tightening around his skull. “We can clear it when we get there. Don’t have too many other options right now.” He looked around at the dark windows that surrounded them. Any number of people have eyes on them. They had to make a move and make it quick.
As Dean straightened out, Sam kept his eyes on Cas for a moment longer, giving him a quick once-over before turning forward and sharing a look with his brother.
Dean was snapped out of sleep by a deep voice and a warm hand on his shoulder. His heart still sped up a little at the sudden movement, but he didn’t grab the gun from under his pillow like he used to.
“Hey, Bobby, where do you want this stuff?” Dean called from the kitchen. He stood shaking a bag of chips, framed by the entryway into the kitchen. The smile didn’t leave Cas’ face as he looked at Dean and followed Bobby to help.
But it was like someone pressed an eject button inside his head, and his mind went blank when Cas shoved an oil-slick hand into his boxers. He bit down harder on the flesh between his teeth, sure it would draw blood as Cas started running his clenched fist up and down his cock, taking time to squeeze the sensitive tip with every slow drag.
Sam looked uneasy. Dean wondered if he was about to argue, but instead, he kept his mouth shut and leaned against the car with bitter acceptance. “Jerk.”
“Fuck, Cas,” he moaned. “You feel so fucking good.” He reached down to dig his fingers into Cas’ wild hair, needing something to hold on to as Cas pulled him in again and again.
Around the fire was where they spent most of their evenings—it was their only source of real warmth. But every night it was too quiet, all of them eating automatically and lost in thoughts that didn’t need dwelling on.
He tapped his foot on the floor for a minute, feeling a little frantic, then rubbed tears out of his eyes with the ball of his hand.
Castiel moved on Turiel, grabbing him by the throat and lifting him until he was on his feet. The three hunters stood and moved back, but Dean knew each of them were formulating some sort of plan of attack in their heads.
“I’m sorry. Again. For last night. Kinda got a little crazy there.” Nerves were making his gut churn. He took a moment to lean against the closed door before pushing off of it to approach Cas slowly.
“I want the tablet. I know you have it, and I will personally tear the angel to pieces if you don’t give it to me.”
Cas didn’t seem to be aware of the spiral Dean was currently hurtling down and pointed to the date scratched into the paper beside the drawing.
Dean stopped and put his arm out to stop Cas from going any further. “See that? Tripwire. We’ve got them set up all along the edge of the property. If anyone comes through here, we’ll know. Sam connected them to an alarm inside.” It was rudimentary, sure, but they’d tested it and Dean knew he could trust his brother’s brainy ideas. Or most of them anyway.
Dean and Cas piled into the back seat as Bobby and Sam sat up front. Dean let his head roll against the back of the bench and lazily looked at Cas.
“I could find us some ping pong balls,” Cas went to stand but only made it about halfway before he fell backwards again.
Dean acknowledged him with a nod and sighed as he turned the key and felt the rumble of the V-8 under his legs.
“I belong to you, Dean. You don’t have to be afraid of letting me in.” Cas didn’t lean towards him, didn’t try to caress his face or press a kiss to his lips. He just stood up from the bed and moved the chair away from the door to pull it open. “Bobby and Sam are waiting, we should go,” he said, and disappeared into the cold light.
“Well, we did. A group of us got rid of them but they pop back up every so often. I guess people from Lawrence are the most delicious of the post-apocalyptic survivors. But the point is, I’ve seen some shit, and I’ve killed some shit, and honestly, your dream man being a dream angel isn’t really that crazy.” She leaned back in her chair with a shrug.
When they broke for lunch, Dean made a couple of packets of instant rice and chopped some Hot Rods into it, trying to hide the chemical taste of the meat by slathering it all with half a can of tomatoes. It looked disgusting, but no one complained as they ate it.
Taking another long drink of water, he turned his attention back to the road, driving past the cars that had been left behind—long-empty—resolutely avoiding looking too far beyond the shoulder.
Finally, they were in Missouri. They left the bridge behind and Dean pulled onto Route 61, which would keep them off the main highway but take them north through the state. Only a day’s drive away from Bobby’s, and Dean, not for the first time in the last few months, couldn’t wait to get off the road.
John’s journal was sitting on the table, on top of a stack of books that Sam had been reading through. Dean grabbed it and flipped to the page the star was scribbled on, and as he did, Cas moved around the semicircle to sit on Dean’s right.
“You do,” Sam said, turning away from him in frustration but whipping back around so quickly it almost made Dean dizzy. “But if anything happens that falls outside of your extremely specific expectations of him, you fly off the handle. What happened in there,” he continued, pointing up at the old house, “wasn’t his fault. But you treated him like a pariah.”
“But we know the last people who had it were the Men of Letters,” Afriel added. “A group of male humans who thought they were more important than everyone else on Earth because they solved mysteries other humans couldn’t. Magic. Cursed objects. Monsters. Angels,” she said, smiling with the half of her mouth that wasn’t stiff with scar tissue. “They even had their own little symbol.” She drew the Aquarian Star in the sugar that covered the table.
“What? With the sigil?” Playing dumb had gotten him out of a few difficult conversations in the past, and he was really hoping this could be one of those times.
“I still have considerable physical strength,” Cas reminded them. “The dust around the barricade doesn’t seem to be disturbed, which likely means there isn’t anything living in the area.”
“You know what? Fine. I’m sick of babysitting anyway. If you wanna go, go.” Cas’ rejection made the blood boil beneath Dean’s skin. He wiped the strange oil off on his shirt with a grimace as he turned to head out the door. But before he could take more than a step, a strong arm wrapped around his waist and pulled him back against a broad chest. Dean’s breath hitched as Cas’ face dropped into the curve of his neck.
Back on the road, it was quiet again in the Impala. The kind of quiet that feels intentional, unavoidable, and unwanted—like a bubble about to pop. Dean pushed eject on the deck, done with CCR, and grabbed whatever tape was closest to him without even looking at it. Before he could hit play, his hand was pushed away from the button.
But don't sweat it—this isn't one of those stories where OCs pull focus. We're still very much all about our boys in this fic.
“Well alright, let’s see what we can find,” Dean said. He tried to smile, but from the look on his brother’s face it was as casual as he’d hoped. It was a damn Walmart. He could handle a Walmart.
The wind picked up haggard hems the rags the two strange angels were wearing, just like Dean knew it would do to Cas’ coat.
“Music, yes I know,” Cas finished for him with a sigh. “But I need to apologize if anything I did crossed a line, or,” he paused, “wasn’t welcome.” Dean could hear how difficult it was for him to get those words out, and he hated himself for making Cas doubt himself like that.
“Damned, fucking, stupid music box ballerinas,” Bobby said, stamping on a few more pieces of the plastic carnage for good measure. “How many more of these rooms left?” he asked, red and out of breath.
He kissed along Cas’ shoulder, biting into the firm muscle and digging his fingers into the small of his back. His hands were sliding across slick skin like he was at a goddamn massage parlour.
“Fuck, Cas, please,” he moaned, he pled. He’d never felt so shameless, never so whole or so wanted. When Cas started slow and easy, Dean pulled him down so he could swallow the desperate, delicious noises he was making. And when that turned into something harder and hungrier, when Cas was fucking him so hard it was like getting hit by a goddamn tsunami, the fact Dean had ever thought something as small and powerless as a whirlpool could swallow him whole seemed impossible, like a bad joke.
“Then I suggest you bring a gun, Sam,” Dean said, pulling one out of his bag and tucking it behind him into his waistband. He grabbed a flashlight and turned it on to test that it worked. “Cas, you all powered up?”
“Like I said, it’s not me you should be apologizing to. Nut up, Winchester. Go fix things with Cas.”
Back into the cold air of the August afternoon, he bumped shoulders with Cas as they pushed to leave the diner at the same time. All he wanted to do was get his hands on him, find the heat he knew was under that trench coat, and press his lips to his ear and tell him how fucking much he believed in him.
Dean started laughing, and turned back at Charlie, who was looking a little more than a little surprised, her eyes darting between the two of them. “Maybe it’s time for bed, dude,” she said with a sympathetic smile.
“A bullet can’t take you out, Cas. Can't hurt you,” Dean whispered against the shell of his ear. He was trying to calm down, to stop his body from shaking so badly.
“Sorry. It was starting to get really gross. I don’t know how you humans do it,” she said. Dean finally winced at the scar tissue that pulled across her face when she talked.
When he flipped the switch there was a small spark, but he could still hear the telltale hum of generators turning over and the buzz of old, Edison light bulbs flickering to life. The second switch seemed to bring the place to full power, casting them all in the kind of bright electric light they hadn’t seen since the angels cornered them in the diner.
He heard the familiar grating of metal as Cas pushed the door of their trailer open, and a few moments passed as he made his way over to Dean, footsteps getting louder as he approached, which seemed even louder in the still, quiet of the air.
Cas pressed his lips together and gave Dean’s hand a squeeze before letting it go. Dean couldn’t move, held still by dread and the look in Cas’ eyes—eyes that managed to shine so brightly even without blue sparks flashing behind them.
He pushed the box into the centre of the table and Sam reached for it, sliding it open to reveal a pewter-coloured key.
Cas looked up from the carnage and his eyes immediately landed on Dean who was still clutching his side and trying to stand.
The rest of it, the sudden appearances and disappearances, the blinding blue light that shone from his eyes and under his skin, that stuff was just Cas and not that far removed from things he and Sammy considered all in a day’s work. Beyond the intimidating shadows he’d seen the night they’d first met, Dean was almost entirely in the dark about Cas’ other life.
“Cas please, please move.” Dean pulled him closer and dragged him down for a kiss, promising him without words that he was fine, that he needed it.
They set up a pretty good system that got them through most of the large room. Cas would scour the shelves, checking for anything actually dangerous, and Dean would follow him, taking a closer look at whatever Cas deemed safe enough to touch.
“Yeah. I mean Cas seems like he’s doing better, too. But we should wait until he gives us the green light. I don’t want to take any more out of him.” Dean could hear the remorse in Sam’s voice, which only piled on top of his own.
“In the shower, or, when I can… thought of you. I thought of you fucking me, just like this, I never thought—” Dean broke off with a breathy moan as Cas pulled slowly out of him and then back in, before adding a second finger to join the first.
“Can I help?” Dean asked. He was almost scared of the answer, even though he had no idea what it would be.
He grabbed whatever t-shirt was within reach, hoping it wasn’t the one he’d been wearing because it was one of his favourites, and wiped them both down.
“It took us too long to find vessels in stable enough condition to let us in. We must take care of them,” Turiel said, his voice harsh and frustrated. “Everything has been so much more difficult than they assured us it would be.”
Checking out the room, all of the disinterested eyes and filled glasses, Dean couldn’t help but crack a grin at the others and move through the small crowd to the bar. Why not lean into it a little—as far as he could tell, there was nothing to be afraid of.
Dean thought, but Sam interrupted with a yell from the other room, “Are you two going to help us out, here?”
“Don’t drink and fly, Cas,” Dean said as he reached for the bottle. He tossed it behind him when he realized it was empty. “I’ll get some more booze from the car, and when I come back, we’ll figure out how to play whiskey pong. Without the pong.” He looked in the direction of the car and it was pitch black.
“Look, if this is some play to steal our shit, you’re out of luck. There might only be four of us, but I guarantee you this will end bloodier for you.” Dean assumed she hadn’t come alone, and did a quick visual sweep of the open, tree-spotted land around them. There wasn’t much cover, but there were still enough places for people to hide.
“Nice hair, kid,” Bobby said to Cas, eyeing the tangled mess that was sticking out in more directions than usual.
But here we are! In the final stretch. Things are about to get a lot smuttier, a lot bloodier, and all those loose end are going to find themselves tied up in neat little knots.
There was no one in the house. He worked his way down the hall, holding on to the wall for a bit of support, and made his way downstairs. He struggled with the door until he realized the bolt was turned. Swearing under his breath he unlocked it and stumbled onto the porch where he could see tents he recognized from the night before.
He leaned into Cas’ touch, something under his ribs uncurling when Cas sighed and pressed his lips against flushed, freckled flesh to taste the light layer of oil streaked across Dean’s cheekbone.
Dean’s coffee was sitting beside his computer, still steaming. He lifted the cup, smelling it first—yep, definitely coffee—before lifting it slowly to his lips.
Dean woke up to an empty room. The bed that had been Sam’s was left with nothing more than an imprint where Cas had decided to sit for a minute or second or a few hours while Dean slept. The rumpled bedspread was the only clue that he’d even been there until he got to the coffee maker.
“That’s us,” she said, gesturing down the road with her head. “So, Sam, Dean, Cas, and Bobby. Come with me if you want to live.” She said it with lightness, but Dean saw something serious flash behind her eyes. With that, she picked up her gun and strapped it back in her holster.
As the three hunters watched him climb the stairs, Sam’s eyes darted to Dean. “Is he gonna be okay?”
As he moved away, pulling his arm slowly from beneath the sleeping man, Cas started to stir. Suddenly, blue eyes were looking into his own.
“Cas!” Dean yelled through the din as he took cover below the wood and plaster exploding above him. Light poured into the room as the boarding against the windows was blown away, and Dean could see Cas’ shadow blocking the ever-brightening light coming in from the open door. He held his gun to his chest and chanced a glance towards him from his position in front of the couch. He could see Cas’ hands raised, blue-white light pouring from them.
He wrote down the frequency where they could get in touch with the group in Falls City and ended the transmission.
“Hey, come on in,” Dean said. When he walked in, something burst inside of Dean—that little ache he got in his chest when he looked at Cas started to uncurl. Warm ribbons spread across his ribcage, wrapped around his shoulders, and twisted down into his stomach.
“Fuck you,” Dean spat, and stood in front of Cas without thinking. Cas grabbed his elbow and moved him to the side, a little more harshly than he normally would.
From his usual, uncomfortable seat, Dean watched the way Cas’ back moved as he lifted two heavy bags of wet grinds. He made his way out from behind the counter and headed towards the side door that led to the alleyway.
Stepping into his personal space, Dean wrapped his arms around Cas and pulled him close. He could feel Cas’ chin dig into his shoulder, and the warmth of skin against skin as Cas pressed his face into his neck. With a slap to the angel’s back, Dean finally dropped his arms and took a half step back.
Bobby didn’t race over to where he was sitting, didn’t push Dean away to deliver some miracle cure, which is what Dean had been hoping would happen—that he would come in here and
Dean turned off the main road, or what could constitute the main road in a village as small as this one, and found an open space between a few trees. It would provide enough coverage for the time they needed it.
It was too much, it was overwhelming. Heat calloused hands were skimming and digging into every soft piece of flesh they could find, sending shockwaves of bright lightning down his thighs and into the deepest part of him. As those hands pushed his legs back and apart, and as Cas slowly sunk in deeper and harder than he’d ever hoped, his back arched and he found himself praying again—maybe this time out loud.
“The one and only. And a few friends,” Rufus said, arms out to introduce his group. They were outnumbered. There were at least fifteen armed hunters, men and women that Sam had been talking to on the radio—that they’d worked with, that their dad had worked with.
He kept his eyes focused on the road in front of him. The dark asphalt was still wet with morning dew, flat and smooth—a stark contrast to the twisted, grey landscapes that lined the highway.
Sam had dug up all sorts of spells he thought might help translate the text. He figured if they could read it, they might get some kind of hint about whether or not it was safe to hand over. Cas sat solemnly as they worked, assuring them, before every incantation, that they were wasting their time.
Cas’ gaze could have melted glass, and Dean was surprised the mug didn’t turn to liquid in his hands as he focused on the slow pour of the espresso and seemed to count every second of every step of making Dean’s coffee.
Cas pulled the door firmly closed behind them. The wood of the porch groaned under their weight, and Dean took a moment to lean forward on the splintered railing. The palms of his hands dug into wood, and he closed his eyes to focus on the sharp, familiar sting. He breathed slowly, trying not to let himself care that he must look like a total wreck. But the moment was fleeting and he stood up straight, turning to see a pair of concerned eyes looking back into his own—which, frankly, was exactly what he didn’t need.
The other angel slapped the hand away from the wound. “That’s disgusting, Afriel. Stop picking at your vessel and focus.” Afriel stood, looking for something to do with the vessel’s small, female hands, but didn’t understand the concept of pocket stuffing or nail picking for distraction. So, she just turned without knowing what to do until settling back at the window.
As he watched, still sipping his coffee, he thought about how many roles Cas filled in Dean’s life. Important ones. And if they added another, the one Dean felt so guilty for wanting, it would be so easy to lose what they already had.
He jogged down the narrow path that led to the backyard. He sighed a breath of relief when he saw the five stalls lined up behind Charlie’s house. They were made out of pretty much the same material as the tents out front—tall, wooden stakes had been hammered into the ground with tarps fastened around them with staples and bungees. They had curtains on one side and a hose that hung over the top that was connected to a rain barrel that sat behind each stall.
Dean grimaced at his dinner—another can of tomato-y goop and some tuna. He put it on the nightstand, too tired to eat and still feeling bloated from the heavy burger and beers. Guess he wasn’t used to that anymore either.
“I’d like that very much,” he said when he pulled himself together. Cas’ wings retracted from where they’d been rolling like the ocean above him. Instead, they bent forward to fold around Dean, enveloping him in a cocoon he couldn’t ever imagine leaving. He gasped as they swept across his skin and then he broke completely when Cas dropped to pull down his boxers and sunk his mouth around Dean’s straining cock.
He poured them each a glass of water from a jug in the fridge and offered to make them tea. They all declined, probably because it was warm enough inside that Dean considered taking off his jacket.
“Of course he does,” Afriel said. “Who else would? Someone needs to. It’s not like Gabriel’s around. And Raphael is a complete… dick.” She seemed almost surprised at her choice of words. “No one would follow him.”
“Stay here, Cas.” Dean’s voice softened, “I need you to watch Baby. And you know I don’t even trust Sammy with that job.”
Dean was getting seriously sick of this shit. Even with the fuel they syphoned from the cars on the way into town, they didn’t have enough to get them through the six-hour drive to Lawrence.
She stuck out her lower lip and gave him puppy dog eyes. “Aww, baby gay,” she said, and reached over to pat his leg.
Sam opened the trunk of the Honda they’d found abandoned, adding the pitiful haul to their larger stash in the trunk, before ducking back into the station.
Dean closed his eyes and he must have dozed off because he came to at the sound of Sam slamming the broken door of their unit back into place.
“Boys?” Bobby called, and with a start, Dean shoved Cas away from him and pushed himself off the car. As Cas caught his balance, shame stabbed through Dean—hotter than the booze or Cas’ hands. He picked the flashlight up from where it had fallen in the grass, and his keys rattled as he scrambled to open the trunk.
Before he could even start undoing the buttons still maddeningly fastened on his shirt, Cas mojo’d the tattered cotton into whatever dimension he sent those things. Dean didn’t care where it went or that he hadn’t had the chance to undress Cas himself—
“Yes. I would bleed for this planet until my vessel was dry.” He unsheathed his angel blade. “As I would bleed anyone who tries to interfere. I am finished. We are finished.”
“I like you this way,” Cas said, pulling the jeans off completely and getting rid of his pants at the same time. He grabbed Dean’s leg to press a kiss to the inside of his thigh—and he did it like it was no big deal, like it wasn’t the end of the fucking world.
“This book,” Sam continued where Dean had interrupted him, “looks like the ledger where the Men of Letters logged all of the artifacts they kept here.”
His partner visibly cringed. “Come on, Turiel. I’ve only read eight human novels and I know that’s… a bit cliché,” she said.
“Come on, Dean. It’s been, what, two weeks? Are you sure you don’t want to get out of the house?” Sam was talking to him from the wide doorway that led to the kitchen, definitely one of Dean’s top five favourite doorways, holding a jacket in one hand and Baby’s keys in the other.
The sound Cas made as he swallowed him down made heat unfurl low in Dean’s stomach—made him feel like the most powerful person in the world. It was messy and imperfect, but the way Cas tightened his fist into Dean’s hair and panted above him made him feel hot and wanted and good.
Dean’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. He pressed his foot down on the accelerator and tried to keep his breathing even. “We were attacked. Me n’ Cas. Five on two. Thought it was only four.” He winced at the stupid move.
Abaddon rolled her eyes as she watched what was unfolding in Normal from a distance. Angels were usually so… predictable, she thought with a disgusted curl of her lip. These two though, they didn’t closely follow the Winchesters like she expected they would. They kept disappearing, fluttering off and leaving the humans completely unprotected.
The drive wasn’t very long, but the entire time Dean drifted in and out of sleep and shook with cold and something else. He was soaked with sweat and wanted to turn on the heat, but the idea of breathing in hot, dry air made his throat constrict. He did it anyway. Glancing over at Cas who was watching the road, hands diligently at ten and two, Dean reached under his seat for the emergency reserves he kept there.
“Get in here,” Dean said, sitting on the bed and moving over as an invitation. Cas pulled himself gracelessly through the door and the mattress shifted under his weight as he tried to get comfortable. Dean had to lean forward to make room for the wings—even tucked beneath him, they spanned the width of the narrow bed.
Sam had called him an asshole. And as the burn of his heightened feelings started to fade he was kind of starting to feel like one.
Dean half expected to find the other side of the room empty. But there he was, Cas, standing solemnly amongst the blood and destruction laid to waste around them. He was so clean and so untouched it made Dean’s stomach hurt. He wanted to reach out and leave a mark.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean turned, cheeks still tingling with embarrassed heat. He wouldn’t give Cas the satisfaction, he wouldn’t. It wasn’t fair how he slid into this place and started handing out coffee and smiles as if they came so easily. Like Dean had never had to work for those smiles, hadn’t half died to see them.
“We were hoping you could help us. We’re looking for a key that Henry hid the night Abaddon attacked you.”
Cas was looking through the short, six-drawer chest across from the beds. Based on the look on his face, Dean figured he didn’t find what he was looking for.
A sudden rap of knuckles against their door made Dean jump, dragging him back, staggering, into reality. He moved away from Cas to break their contact, like he was pulling his hand off of a hot stove.
Turiel looked at him with hard eyes, then suddenly appeared at his side and pressed two fingers to Dean’s temple. He would have shoved the angel away, but the cool buzz of grace wrapping his fractured ribs was too much of a relief.
Cas was quiet, like he was gathering courage or working up to something. Dean decided it was probably better to let the guy figure it out and keep his own mouth shut. He rolled his beer in his hands, only stopping to pick at the corner of the damp, silver label. It flaked under his fingers and he chanced another glance at Cas. He was flexing his hands into fists, but Dean couldn’t make out the look on his face.
The thought tugged something inside of him, something already stretched tension-tight, and when the wing under his hand rippled like it was reacting to his touch, that thing snapped.
This was beneath her, but Lucifer had trusted her with it and she would not disappoint Him. Once she could get her hands on one of the filthy hunters, she knew the demon tablet would be theirs. They were so pathetic they wouldn’t think twice before trading the tablet for one of their own—without any consideration of the power it possessed.
“Oh fuck,” Dean said, letting his head fall back and hit the wall. His legs were shaking. He tried to come back down to Earth. “Yes, yeah, definitely yeah,” he rushed when he noticed Cas was still waiting for an answer.
Dean didn’t flinch. “You’re supposed to be dead,” he spat, his mouth pulled into a line as hard as his shoulders.
“You didn’t consume any more than you normally would. Perhaps there’s another reason for your elevated heart rate,” he said, lips pressing against Dean’s neck.
“Shit,” Dean said. He felt foggy—is this how Cas felt on Earth? He turned his head to the side to ask, and when his half-closed eyes finally opened he realized how close he was to Cas’ mouth.
Dean watched Cas leave the kitchen and wander into the living room. He was looking at the phones that still hung along the wall, labelled with the names of the various agencies and intelligence offices. Dean followed him into the room.
“Me’n my brother, we’re hunters. Bobby, too.” He knew there was a reason why he clicked with Charlie so well. Outside of all the ‘she’s actually a really cool person’ stuff. There was a depth to her he found comforting. Familiar.
Hopefully they’d be cool enough that she wouldn’t have to kill them, she thought as she tied her hair back. That was always a total day-ruiner.
Sam turned his head at the sound coming from the small speaker. “What’s the occasion?” he asked. His cup was green, and in the light of the fire, the colour reflected on his face and made him look sallow.
It was a hell of a lot more grim this far east. They had to deal with a lot of the same shit even as far inland as South Dakota, but most of their problems came from people who were still up and walking, and usually, they could avoid them too.
“It sounded more like a prayer,” Cas said, holding Dean’s head in place when the hunter tried to look away. “But I need you to know, you didn’t take advantage of me. I know I said I was having difficulty controlling my emotions, and my… actions.”
In another L-shaped hallway, they found furnished bedrooms. They each shot-gunned their favourite—although it didn’t really matter, they all looked the same—like they were kids on a tear after moving into a new house.
They went to investigate the damage. The hinges had been pulled out of the frame, but it wasn’t anything that they couldn’t fix. It took a little more elbow grease without electric tools, but eventually, they got everything reattached and back in working order, or just about working. The squeak was worse than it had been, definitely, and because it was crooked they had to kick the bottom a bit to get it to close properly. But it wasn’t going to get much better.
“How far?” Dean grabbed one of the warm energy drinks from the back seat of the Impala, shaking off his hand as it foamed over his finger when he cracked it open.
Thank you, all of you, for taking this journey for me. It's been six months since I decided to write my first Supernatural fic, and I've loved every minute of writing it (okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration) and appreciated every reader, every comment, and every single kudos (very much not an exaggeration).
“Cas?” It was the only word that made sense at the time to say, and suddenly a shot rang out and wood beside Dean’s head exploded. The pain that had been building behind Dean’s eyes blinded him, and suddenly he felt himself being pushed back into the open door of the house as Cas moved in front of him.
Dean looked over to the cars. The others were pretty much done packing up, but he could see they were all looking at a map—probably plotting out a decent route to Lebanon. “Any chance I could get that shower you mentioned last night?”
Everything was black. The light from the doorway only lit up a small circle around them, and it looked like someone had built a barricade of shopping carts to block their path. Cas followed Dean as he pushed through the flimsy barrier and scanned the shelves nearby for anything salvageable.
He tensed as Cas gripped his sides tighter. Neither of them moved, except for Cas angling his head down to look at where his hands were touching Dean. And Dean, drunk on whiskey and the feeling of soft hair against his face, grabbed Cas’ hands and slid them down to his hips.
When he got himself together, he slid on his boots and went to go find Bobby and Cas, hoping neither of them had cursed themselves into oblivion.
He took a small sip and still managed to burn his tongue. But once the sting started to subside and he could actually start to taste it...
“You wouldn’t know him,” Dean said, anxious to get things moving. “What’s the deal, Henry. What is all this? Do you have the key or not?”
I might post two chapters on Thursday because chapters 11 and 12 are really companions in a way. They needed to be divided, but I think it makes sense to give everyone a chance to read them together.
A pile of animals—what was left of them—was stacked nearby, messily skinned with most of their flesh cut away.
Dean’s tongue was thick from the coffee he’d tossed back earlier. He opened his mouth to say the things he’d been playing over and over in his head for days—for years—but it was like trying to speak a language he’d never learned.
Dean summoned some courage before finishing his point. “What you are is Castiel,” he said, trying and failing to give weight to the name that spanned an endless number of lifetimes and had an immeasurable impact on Dean’s small existence. “And you are one of the only good things left in this entire goddamned world,” he said, feeling like he’d been flayed.
Dean didn’t believe him, and he knew it was written all over his face at the way his brother shook his head.
He adjusted Dean again, who was pliant and flush beneath him, grabbing his thighs to pull him up and forward.
“Sam, grab the cans. Cas,” Dean faltered, “stay here and keep an eye on things, but keep the two-way on.”
“I wouldn’t,” Abaddon said, sharp and tinny and stopping him in his tracks. “If I die, the angel dies. And his death will be much more,” she searched for the word, “
Cas smiled and ran his hand through Dean’s hair. “Not to any extent you should worry about. I just want to ensure that I have as much power as possible when we face them.”
“I said I’m good,” he said, and although he tried to muster the energy to sound pissed, it was impossible from his place on the couch.
They drove in silence for a while. Dean was drinking an energy drink he’d pilfered from the last gas station they’d hit, using it to wash down the dry protein bar Sam had tossed at him. He felt anxious, a feeling totally removed from the syrupy, green liquid he’d just ingested in what he was pretty sure was record time.
Dean swore under his breath, feeling his ribs twist again when he remembered he’d tossed them to Cas.
It was cold, but Dean didn’t feel it as he followed Cas outside. Heavy, slushy snow was falling from the sky, leaving soft splatters on the dark asphalt. If Cas knew Dean was there, he didn’t acknowledge him. He tossed the grinds into the compost bin, but didn’t turn around even after the lid slammed shut.
Back then, when Bobby’s house was still burning, the demon that had crawled outside of the warded gates of the yard was still re-settling into the meat suit. She shook out her arms and legs, rolling her shoulders as she regained control of the limbs that she abandoned when Castiel turned his power on them. It wasn’t her first time inhabiting a body, but she wished she still had the first one she had. It was smooth, beautiful—even for a human. But the Men of Letter had seen to that.
“Yes,” he choked out. “Yeah, Cas. It’s perfect.” Dean gasped as Cas maintained his pace. Heat pooled low in his stomach and he wanted to put his hands somewhere—get them back on warm skin—but the angle was too awkward.
Sam rolled his eyes but laughed into his cup as he took a sip. “I don’t even remember the last time I saw a cucumber.”
“Dean?!” Sam yelled, shortening the distance between them with long, rushed strides. Dean knew they both looked a hell of a lot worse than they had when they went in. Blood crusted Dean’s shirt, and Cas was covered in it, too. Soot stuck to their skin, streaking down Dean’s face where tears had displaced the grime.
“Chill out, Cas,” Dean said. He felt confident enough, just for a second, to kick his foot off of the ring where it had been resting to brush it against the length of Cas’ calf. “Just give us a minute.”
“This is where we ran into a few problems,” Dean said, putting his hands on his hips. The east side of the property, where the driveway met the dirt road, needed to be kept clear. They didn’t have enough fencing to build a gate, and they couldn’t set up tripwires or block the entrance they needed to use. “We’re wide open,” Dean explained. “So we gotta keep our eyes peeled.”
“You don’t know what you’re doing,” Cas said. It sounded like he was pushing his voice through broken glass. Dean was forced to stand as Cas grimaced and pushed himself up off the bed.
“Yeah, well, fighting’s all we got left,” Dean said quietly, eyes dropping away from the wall. “And we made sure that’s all that’s left for anybody.”
They’d tracked down the monster to her next victim’s home—fighting through plastic barriers and still-damp plastered drywall in the renovated house to gank the monster. Turns out she was a woodland spirit, one who didn’t take too well to her forest being ripped to pieces to get cut down into 2x4s for yuppy renos. The coffee shop had been a red herring. It turned out it was just a popular place.
A sharp, sudden hiss of steam pulled him back to the surface, out of the whirlpool that was doing its best to drown him. He cleared his throat and walked towards the open stretch of counter where he’d seen other people pick up their orders.
Outside, Cas seemed completely unphased as he explained their plan to Sam and Bobby, who both looked up when Dean approached the group. He’d spent a minute inside calming down, waiting for the flush to subside before gathering himself to face the others. He figured he looked totally casual, like he hadn’t just come all over himself after his best friend gave him the most frustrating hand job of all time.
“You idjits can’t get rid of me that easy.” There was a lightness to his voice that Dean hadn’t heard in a long time, and maybe it was just a trick of the light, but the deep lines etched into his face seemed to soften.
“Ain’t being alive enough of a reason?” Dean looked to where Cas was sitting beside him, one of those rare smiles on his face as he stared into the flames. He was close enough that he could nudge him with an elbow. “How ya feeling, buddy?”
“This goddamn thing,” Bobby said, opening and closing it, trying to figure out the source of the squeak. “Well, I think this is as good as we’re gonna get,” he said, taking off his hat to wipe his forehead with the back of his sleeve, leaving a smear of dirt in its wake. Dean thought it was probably time to figure out a way to clean their clothes a little more thoroughly, as he glanced down at the borderline rags he was wearing.
Unlike the gas station, the door of the Walmart hadn’t been smashed open. Or, it had, but it had been hastily repaired with sheets of particleboard. Electricity had been out in most of this part of the country since the blasts, and the automatic doors didn’t budge when Dean and Cas approached.
Charlie’s face twisted. “Rude,” She said. “I might be a chick but I could still shoot you in the face. The point is I
“Woulda been here sooner, but it took us a minute to figure out how to kill you,” Dean said with a curl of his lip.
“Yeah, you know. You get a ping pong ball and throw it into the other team’s cup and then you drink. Or… they do?” It was Dean’s turn to be confused. He’d never actually played the game—he’d only seen it in movies.
“Somethin’ got your feathers in a twist?” Dean asked with an easy smile as he popped the cap of the bottle off.
So he laid on the horn, too long and too loud, and as they pulled onto the street, Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
Finally able to take in the morning, he muttered, “Morning, Cas,” and untangled himself from the sheets. Years of habit got him up and moving towards the bathroom, but halfway there he stopped himself.
Poor Dean. Poor Cas. But we've got a turning point here and maybe—just maybe—Dean's getting ready to get his stupid head together.
Part of him knew this is where he belonged. This was the world he helped create, and it was all he deserved. He wished he didn’t have to bring the rest of the human race down with him. But what more could you expect from Dean fucking Winchester?
“All good?” he asked, handing his brother the cloth. He wasn’t going to go as far as wiping the kid’s face, although he had to pull back a little at the instinct. He hadn’t done that since Sammy was eight.
“Alright, alright. Calm down,” Dean said, raising his hands in mock defeat. “Here, let me—” He put the bottles down on the dresser to give him a second before figuring out what to do next. “Let’s get your jacket off, I guess.” He figured that was a good place to start. Probably. But he didn’t know how he was going to manage it—Dean wasn’t sure Cas had taken it off at all since the curse hit him.
At the crash, Sam burst out of his room with more energy than he’d had in days. Dean almost laughed when he saw the pistol in his hands. “It’s alright, Sammy,” Dean reassured him as he rushed into their small living room. “Just a… door.”
“Knock yourself out.” Dean tried not to wince when his palm was cut open, Cas turning his hand over to let his blood drip onto the flattened, dry gravel of the driveway. Cas spoke more commandingly this time, the unfamiliar Enochian syllables rolling off his tongue and right through Dean.
They followed the light, slowing as they got closer to the fires burning along the side of the road. Dean was surprised to see their group filled an entire cul-de-sac. It wasn’t somewhere they’d noticed on their way in, but the long stretch of road and the curve at the end of it was lit by bonfires—some in cans, some surrounded by stones, others in hollowed-out metal scrap.
“Can I help you?” Sam asked slowly. Dean hadn’t realized he was staring until he noticed Sam was staring right back.
When Cas finally met Dean’s eyes, something lurched inside him as he held the sides of Cas’ face and wiped his damp cheekbones with calloused thumbs. Grounding him.
“Thanks for the help tonight,” Dean said, lifting his hand in a half-wave, using that same hand to push himself away from the wall when he swayed too close to it. He turned to walk up the stairs to the room he knew would be empty since Sam always ended up passing out on the couch. He tripped again on the first step but caught himself on the railing. His feet were heavy the rest of the way up, but once he got to the bed he collapsed on the old quilt—boots still on and hanging off the end.
He wished the park were bigger, so he could walk farther without feeling like he was straying too far into dangerous territory. He thought back to a year ago when his biggest problem was hunting down the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse—when he could get a hot burger whenever he wanted. Go for drives, as long as he needed them to be. Blow off steam with whoever he felt like (if they felt like blowing off some steam, too). And now he was trapped in Concordia Estates, a Podunk trailer park in Hell’s half acre, without so much as a cold beer or a warm body—that wasn’t related to him or to be avoided at all costs.
He shoved his brother away, standing, maybe relying too much on the rear bumper of the car for balance. “Whatdwegot,” he asked quickly, the words blending together in his haste to move on.
Before Dean or Sam could get to her, she whispered something under her breath and Cas was surrounded by the dark, thickening smoke of a curse. Dean raced to reach her before she could finish the spell and managed to put her down with a blade that slipped easily between her ribs. He felt something like regret as he did it, but there wasn’t any time to worry about her when he heard Cas cry out and hit the floor the same time her body did.
“This has to be significant,” he said, without a single intonation that he was feeling anything close to what Dean was. In fact, he was acting like he was still invested in the case and not obsessing over his pinky finger casually resting against Dean’s leg or all of the ways Dean had let him down.
Dean looked at the small car they’d been driving. He wasn’t a truck guy, but he’d never wished more in his life that they had something with more horsepower. Something that could haul.
He curled into Cas, taking advantage of the arm draped across his back. He let himself sink into Cas’ neck, pressing his lips against whatever skin he found there, and let the rest of the world slip away. He heard voices and felt himself get dragged onto his feet, and then a strong arm grabbed him behind his knees to scoop him off the ground. He dug his face into the summery smell of Cas and passed out.
Dean bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to sting and mentally kicked himself. Goddamn it. Why did he have to open his stupid mouth?
?!” Turiel hissed at the other angel. “Our brothers and sisters are dying,” he grabbed the front of her shirt, his thin fingers tearing the threadbare fabric. “Time is different here, you know that. Every moment we spend on Earth, even more time has passed in Heaven.”
When they got back to the bunker, Cas was half-collapsed. Dean got him into the shower, disinfected his wounds, and gave him a pair of clean sweats before he laid him down in bed. He was out cold the second his head hit the pillow, and Dean left a bottle of water and two painkillers on his bedside table for when he came to. He’d barely moved as he slept, except to curl into Dean when he went down for the night.
Cas pulled back and then pushed himself carefully back inside, slow and breathless. Dean held his hips and choked at the slow drag of pressure. But as he relaxed around him, Cas started moving faster, pushing Dean’s legs up and grabbing the back of his knees to hold him in place, keeping him open and vulnerable as they found their rhythm and Cas thrust into him harder and faster.
“So what?” Dean said, keeping his hand where it was, thumb curling around his chin, leaning in closer. “You gonna say no?” he asked dangerously, Dean asked, biting his lip as he stared at Cas’ mouth.
Dean scoffed. “Cas, don’t.” He was still unsteady on his feet and walked with as little of a limp as he could to the closest seat to him, which was the bench that circled the low table near the kitchenette.
Dean felt dizzy with it; all he could see or taste or feel was Cas, and the electricity buzzing under his skin was building and making him feel frantic. Cas groaned and rolled his hips again as Dean dragged his blunt nails down Cas’ back, taking a moment to enjoy the curve of his ass until digging into the flesh to bring him closer.
Cas squeezed his fingers and lifted his other hand to cup Dean’s face, gently turning it towards his own. The touch melted the tension in Dean’s jaw, and his lips parted as he leaned into Cas’ warm palm. Cas didn’t move, waiting for permission, and as those blue eyes burned into his own, Dean gave a small nod, almost imperceptible, and leaned in to close the distance between them.
For all the shit Dean had been through, he’d never be able to understand what Cas was feeling. He didn’t ask, didn’t push beyond the small pieces of information Cas occasionally offered when they talked—that his senses weren’t as strong, or angel radio was tuning out, or he was complaining that he was hungry or tired but still unsure of what to do about it.
Dean sighed. He was glad they’d finally found it, sure, but he didn’t feel great about handing over the Word of God to two angels without knowing what they could do with it.
Cas had heavy shadows under his eyes as he got to the Impala and leaned against the passenger door, crossing his arms against the cold. “I truly hope you’re right, Sam.”
“No kidding. We need to search through the artifacts but I was hoping to find an inventory, or something. Larry said there was a thousand years of supernatural history kept here. And we don’t have that much time to find the tablet.”
When they got to the car, Dean grabbed Cas’ wrist so he could aim the flashlight at the trunk. He pulled the keys out of his pocket. “Come to papa,” he whispered.
“Sammy, we need somewhere to stay. Somewhere isolated until we can get our shit together. For now, this is our best bet. We can keep looking later if we need to.”
The hunters waited for Turiel to get to his point, and shifted where they stood, Sam still holding his gun pointed at the strangers, Bobby with his arms hanging at his side, and Dean with both hands on his hips and an annoyed look on his face. Cas stood to the right of Dean, his fist still clenched around the handle of his blade.
They were just crossing I-80 when they finally ran out of fuel. It wasn’t a good spot to be in, smack between Des Moines and Omaha, even though they had about seventy miles between them and each city, it was still too close for Dean’s liking, and they hadn’t put nearly enough distance between them and the last tent city they’d passed. Maybe twenty miles. Maybe less. It wouldn’t be safe to go looking for gas anywhere near here.
Cas had been gone for days, and the entire time Dean had been trying to forget why he’d left in the first place.
He reached down and wrapped his hand around Cas, stroking him until he melted into a puddle of shameless moans and gasps, muttering in a language Dean didn’t recognize. Cas’ hands ran down his back and dug his fingers into the flesh of Dean’s ass trying to pull him closer. Dean bent his head into the crook of Cas’ neck, tasting salt and pressing his lips against the low, rumbling vibration of his throat.
No one cared about cash except for those who couldn’t shake the habit. People needed to feed their families, so those in power put them to work and paid them in food. There were raids on those with stockpiles, under the precedent of taking from the rich to give to the poor, to spread what few resources there were left amongst the many, but most people never saw any of that—unless they volunteered to go work in the hot zones.
But—and Dean would rather go back to Hell than admit this to anybody—when he let himself remember the press of Cas’ hips against his, the drag of stubble across his skin, that feeling burned right through his guilt.
As the fabric fell away, Cas revealed a large, stone tablet covered in engravings the three humans couldn’t even begin to decipher.
Suddenly, he was gone. Sam jumped when Cas appeared beside him, grabbing the tablet out of his hands and smashing it to the ground.
As Dean watched her straddle the moped, he half expected that group of hidden snipers to reveal themselves, but none did. And then she turned the key and was off, puttering down the dark road barely lit by her weak headlight.
“Yeah, yeah I know,” Dean said, already chewing. He was living firmly in denial of ever running out of gas, of having to leave one or both of their cars behind. The thought made him sick—four grown men and all of their supplies wouldn’t fit in the Impala. “Let’s check ‘em out,” he said, pointing to the abandoned vehicles parked just behind them.
As the three humans at the table regained their sense of place, Castiel stood where he was trapped in the middle of the booth, and pushed the table hard enough that it crashed into the kitschy 1950s mirror that was hanging on the wall above the booth cross from them.
When he felt like it was safe to uncover his eyes, when the light beyond his forearm was faded enough that he could finally look to see what was happening, Afriel and Turiel were in the middle of the room, standing in their misshapen vessels and looking at the dead demons in front of them.
“Oh, come on Sam. Too easy.” Beside him, Bobby snorted, and Dean turned to him in surprise. “Well, whadya know. The old man lives!”
“What the hell just happened?” Dean asked, unsure of whether or not he was angry or worried. “And what the hell are those?” He gestured wildly to the two wings protruding from Cas’ raw-looking back.
“It isn’t late,” Cas looked to the sky as he said it, reminding Dean of Crocodile Dundee so much he couldn’t help but crack half a smile. He would have brought it up, but Cas probably wouldn’t have a clue what he was talking about—and it didn’t seem like the right time for a pop-culture lesson.
Dean stumbled over his words for a second, surprised at Bobby’s reaction, but stopped himself before he could say anything stupid.
It happened after Cas threw him on top of the cheap bedspread in the motel room, his grace sliding beneath Dean’s skin and lighting him up from the inside. Dean couldn’t stop the words.
Cas leaned back and put his hand on his shoulder, over the handprint he knew was still branded into Dean’s skin. “The Word of Dean Winchester,” he said with a small smile.
“Hey man, this isn’t my news to share. That’s all you,” She was still laughing as she dug crumbs out of a bag of chips. Dean didn’t know where she’d gotten it from, but he tasted sour cream and onion in his mouth, so at one point he must have had some. He washed the taste away with another swig of whatever liquor was in his hand.
Dean worked him, wrapping his lips around his teeth and hollowing his cheeks to get more of those desperate sounds out of Cas as he palmed his own dick. Cas’ hips jerked forward, pushing a little deeper into the back of Dean’s throat and he’d be goddamned if it didn’t set off sparks behind his eyes. He pulled off and looked up at Cas, trying to catch his breath.
Cas didn’t reply, he just stood and squared his shoulders, staring the other angels down with blue fire.
Two shabby angels materialized across from the group in the open space of the parking lot. They looked so unlike the crisp, uptight beings they were used to seeing they wouldn’t have been identifiable if it weren’t for their sudden appearance and blades hanging at their sides. The male vessel was pale and drawn, and the female was slight and covered in knotted scars. Dean noticed they were both wearing the tattered clothing of wanderers—ripped, rotting, and layered—which made the red berets they were wearing really stand out.
Turiel pushed air out of his nose, annoyed and trying to regain the attention of the group. “Listen. You need to find the key,” he said, folding his hands on the table in front of him.
Dean ignored the heat crawling up his neck and he ignored Bobby and Sam’s stupid smiles, and instead focused on shovelling as much food into his mouth as he could. But he did reach over to put his hand on Cas’ knee and give it a squeeze.
He pulled a little past a few that looked promising, checking for movement inside, and stopped the Impala without pulling onto the shoulder.
“Hey Cas, take a load off. You’re making me nervous.” The angel sat down wordlessly beside him and rested his hands on his knees. “Long day?” Dean asked.
They loaded the cans carefully into the trunk and packed them in with bags and boxes so they wouldn’t tip over.
“Can I take this?” he asked, pointing to the bucket Dean had boiled that morning, still murky from the man-made lake, but fine for washing.
He stopped and looked out into the thin line of trees at the border of the park. There were a few houses a couple of hundred yards away, and from here they looked almost habitable. But they’d gone scouting their first few days in the area and although they found a few things to eat, and a few things Dean and Bobby could drink, the shape of them was almost worse than the park. Looking down at his dirty jacket, Dean made a mental note that maybe they should go back over and see if they could find anything clean to wear.
“Where’re we headed?” Dean asked, groggy and still blinking away the smoke of the burning building they’d left behind.
That thought was enough to peel him off the flattened cushions he called a bed and get him into his boots. He blinked at the brightness of the morning and tried to focus his eyes, getting to the firepit more by memory than sight.
he thought as he almost fell off the back of it. Cas caught him and he laughed, his deep vibrato harmonizing Charlie’s higher-pitched giggles.
“Goddamn it, Cas!” He turned on the angel but stopped short, surprised at how close he still was. Dean could make out his face even in the surrounding darkness, and his anger skipped like one of the shitty CDs he’d stolen for the Honda.
“This was their nerve centre,” Sammy said beside him, stopping at the metal railing to try and take it all in. Their voices echoed, and even in the dark, Dean could sense how big it was inside.
“A ‘princess’?” Charlie asked laughing. “Nah. I’m a queen, bitch. And I have a consenting harem of sexy ladies to prove it.”
“No way,” Dean snapped. Cas looked up at Dean, surprised at his harsh outburst. “No way, Cas. It’s not like you can text us if something happens, and the radios don’t work beyond a few miles. I’m not going to let you go out there yourself. Not happening.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean said, uncomfortable discussing family at the best of times, let alone in a weird kitchen with some old stranger.
Dean woke up and took back every bad thing he’d thought or said about Sam’s mattress. At this point in their stay, he’d give anything for something comfortable to sleep on—even something with stiff springs and a dip in the middle. He didn’t know if he could last one more night on the couch. At least one night was all they had left. He’d made Bobby and Sam take the beds, refusing to share with either. There was just too much time they spent together these days. Dean’s nights on the couch might be uncomfortable, but they were his own.
They walked slowly to the front of the house, where the wind wasn’t obstructed by the piles of junk like it was in the backyard. Bobby’s place was surrounded by trees, but Dean cringed at the stink of rot the breeze carried past them. It wasn’t always like this, or he was just getting used to the smell, but when it hit, it hit hard.
Dean finally felt his nerves taking a backseat. “How about losing a couple layers, yourself?” he asked, running his hands over Cas’ clothed stomach.
Dean could feel the vibrations of Cas’ moan as he dragged his mouth along Dean’s length, his tongue leaving damp patches on the fabric. Dean almost choked when Cas flicked his eyes up to look at Dean through his lashes. This is the hottest fucking thing I’ve ever seen, he thought through the haze.
He smelled like spilled coffee and Dean couldn’t remember why he’d come outside, but he finally had rough stubble under his palms and his fingers buried in dark hair and he knew if he didn’t get to pull the bitter taste of espresso from that mouth into his own he’d suffocate.
Cas reached up and wrapped a hand around his cock with his face still buried between Dean’s thighs, and tears fell down the sides of Dean’s face as he struggled not to bite down on the powerful wing. He finally threw his head back, gasping for air and muttering a stream of words he never thought he’d have the chance to say as the heat in the base of his spine spread down his legs and up under his ribs. When Cas crooked his fingers inside of him one more time, Dean finally let go, shuddering as he covered his stomach and chest in come.
“It’s in the drawer.” Dean motioned bonelessly to the table on Cas’ side of the bed. Cas reached over and found the lube, sitting back to slick himself up and gently work some into Dean with his fingers.
As they backed carefully out of the cul de sac, Bobby honked goodbye. Cas looked at Dean with a line between his eyebrows. “Should I also honk?”
Sam took a deep breath and ran his hands through his flop of hair. “And what if we don’t? He keeps… waxing poetic about crown moulding?”
“Sooner would be better than later,” Bobby grumbled. He stood, stretching out his back before grabbing a few more sticks for the fire.
“Hey. What’s wrong?” Dean asked again, blinking as Cas turned the flashlight upwards so they could see each other.
“Yes, Rowena found a spell that will reverse the curse. It won’t be a quick process or an easy one. But it’s possible.”
Cas moved away, lavishing the inside of his thigh with hungry, open-mouthed kisses, and gently ran one slick finger—Dean wondered if Cas used grace it was so wet and warm—in small circles over the muscle where his tongue had just been.
“This is my Father’s language—the Word of God,” he said, sounding like he couldn’t believe his own words. “I’ve heard of the existence of these tablets, but it was assumed they’d been lost.”
“Hold… tighter—” He couldn’t say it, but put his hand over Cas’ where it had settled at the bend of his hip. “Yeah, like that,” he sighed as Cas gripped Dean tight enough to bruise.
Close to the bedrooms, they walked into a huge, industrial kitchen. The appliances were outdated but worked. Who knew when they’d be able to use it for anything other than cooking boxed macaroni or warming up cans of beans, but Dean didn’t care. Him and Sammy hadn’t ever had their own kitchen before.
Dean reached over to slam the door closed, making sure to twist the lock before he turned to look at the angel. They were alone, and all he wanted was Cas’ body pressed against him, to feel the burn in his scalp as Cas gripped his hair and pulled his head back to bare his throat. He wanted to be pushed to his knees and used any way Cas wanted.
“Goddamn it!” Bobby yelled, and Dean picked up his pace, running down the hallway into the room where the commotion was coming from.
With one more quick glance up, Cas pulled down the elastic waistband of Dean’s boxers, not giving him a second to catch his breath before pressing teasing kisses against the soft skin on the underside of his cock, making his way up until he was running his tongue along the frenulum and over the flushed, pink tip.
Henry smiled tightly. “No, not a time loop. When Abaddon was finally killed, I cast a spell, one that could only be activated when another member of our order, or a Legacy,” he added, gesturing to Sam and Dean, “entered the building.”
As Larry was busy at the fridge, Dean leaned over to whisper to Sammy, “It looks like Martha Stewart threw up in here.”
Cas just looked at him, head cocked and eyes crinkling at the corners. “I can think of more appropriate words to describe the last twenty-four hours.”
Dean took one last look at him. Castiel, standing in the middle of a quiet highway with his head tilted and arms hanging straight at his sides, wrapped in a trench coat. Dean remembered what his blood looked like streaked across the front of it, but now it was as if it had never been there at all.
Dean’s eyes rolled back when Cas’ tongue dragged over the fabric that covered his sensitive head. “Can I use my mouth?” Cas asked, his voice muffled from where his lips were still pressed against him.
“Hey, careful,” Sam said as he pushed his hands away. “These are old and we have no idea what they can do.”
Dean felt like he could spit sparks, and as Cas continued exploring with his lips and tongue, a throb of blood pooled low in his stomach. He fell back against the pillow and dug his fingers deeper into dark hair and forcibly held himself back from pushing the angel lower.
“I like it, Dean. It makes me stand out,” she said. She sounded tired of explaining it, and for some reason, Dean felt bad for asking.
Cas shifted. His hair was wild on top of his head, getting longer and left unkempt. Like his coat, it wasn’t as pristine as it used to be. But neither was Dean’s, if you could have ever called his look pristine.
“I ain’t gonna drop dead from the stuff?” He bit his lip, still chasing the honeyed richness before even getting an answer.
A few of the trespassers dropped their arms. Of course they’d heard of Castiel, the Winchester’s signature angel. And most of them knew what he and his kind were capable of. It was probably the worst-kept secret of the pre-apocalypse.
Dean leaned over his brother's arm to look at it. The mark looked like it had been etched in hastily, gone over again and again with a pen that was running out of ink. Beneath the star, marked in his father’s hasty handwriting,
They all climbed back in the car and started their slow drive over the bridge. It wasn’t far, but it was narrow, and whoever had built the barricade had left enough obstructions in the road that Dean couldn’t hit the gas like his gut was telling him to.
“You bet,” Dean said smiling, and went to grab his brother a cup of instant from the steaming pot beside the fire. Before Dean could head back in, Sam was pushing out of the trailer with his hip to join him and Bobby outside.
He swore under his breath, but he was too hungover to actually say anything out loud. He started kicking the back of his boot against the base of the bed frame in an attempt to loosen it. He got it half-way off then pried it the rest of the way off with his socked-foot. He wasn’t even able to enjoy the feeling of freedom before he peeled his sore, dry tongue off the roof of his mouth.
He turned around for the first time since he’d tried to leave the room, and his lungs compressed when he saw the way Cas was looking back at him. His eyes were blown wide and shining so brightly it almost hurt, full of quiet hope and a depth Dean couldn’t find the bottom of. But it didn’t last—his face shifted like he was making a decision or locking something away. The light faded as Cas drew his mouth into a controlled line and folded his wings tightly behind him.
They walked towards the far side of the property, weaving between rusted cars as they went. There was still enough light left to see, but Dean would need to grab a flashlight from inside soon.
Dean’s ears were ringing and he inhaled the familiar scent of gunpowder, but the shooting had stopped—there were no more bullets ripping through the back of the house.
They moved towards the exit. The Gas n’ Sip had been one of those fancier ones, where people who lived in the city would stop on the way to cottage country to load up on snacks and beer before spending a weekend on the lake. Most of the summer homes had long been abandoned because of their proximity to ground zero, with people moving further inland to escape the ash and fallout. The palm trees that had once lined the grander homes’ driveways were dried up and dead.
“That’s where you’ll find the key,” he said, sitting back down and settling back into the same position he’d been in the entire conversation. “It’s hidden in a Men of Letters safehouse. Very few members of our organization knew of its existence, and it’s been protected so the building will still be intact.”
Dean waited. He could handle this, he could. But he needed to know he wasn’t about to die from some sort of weird angel food poisoning. The oil was all over his face and he could still taste it from where he’d licked it off of Cas’ thumb.
He was exhausted, but even at the end of the world there was no time to just stop. He’d spent his entire life killing things and saving people. Now, he hunted for food and ammo and killed anyone who got in his way.
“What?” Cas looked wild. If he could stay focused on any one part of Dean’s face for longer than a second, his eyes might have burned a hole right through him.
Dean rolled his head towards Cas. “I’m gonna hit the hay.” As he laid down in the space Cas vacated, he winced when the rattle of Sam’s cough bounced through the trailer.
“Like,” Sam ran his finger along the page in front of him, “a ring that manifests its wearer’s deepest fears, tormenting him with bloody visions until he ends his own life.”
Dean threw his bag on the bed and stood with his hands on his hips taking it all in. His own damn room. He swallowed down the lump in his throat.
“Hey, Charlie,” he said. His voice sounded rough, and he hated the fact it was like an admission of how shitty he still felt. He looked at the coffee gratefully as he took a small sip.
“There’s something else,” Dean said, scratching the back of his neck. He led Cas back to the bedroom and hesitated before he opened the dresser drawer, like he was nervous about what he was going to find inside of it. “I got you some stuff to wear. I put it all in here for now, but I didn’t mean to— if you wanna put it in your room, I mean, I get it—”
Dean felt a little more of that wall inside his head crumbling, and he swore under his breath as he stood up to get ready for the day.
“Yeah, okay, we got it.” Dean stood and pushed his chair away with the back of his knees. “Write down the address you have, or the coordinates, or whatever, and we’ll figure it out.”
As he leaned again the wall and waited for his skin to stop buzzing, his mind was too foggy to even attempt to figure out what the fuck just happened. Or why he’d let it.
“You can call me Cas,” he continued hesitantly. Dean looked at him like he was crazy, but the angel just shrugged. Dean decided he’d have to knock some of his more irritating human habits right out of his head.
“Dean, you’ve died for your brother. You’ve been to hell. You’ve spent your entire life saving people. How are you not qualified to reflect on humanity? You’re one of my Father’s finest creations.”
He had about three seconds of morning peace before everything came crashing back to him. Today, he had to figure shit out with Cas. The angel stuff, or at least the angel fighting stuff. Fighting, he was good at. He hadn’t put up much of one the night before, but after living with his dad for so many years, he knew how to stand down and walk away almost as well.
“We’re not entirely sure,” Afriel said. “We were just sent here to collect it.” She looked thoughtful.
“Well, these two still seem pretty secure,” Sam said, almost suspiciously, standing back to consider his next move.
Dean looked at Cas, his eyes watering from the effort it was taking not to unhinge his jaw and eat the burger in one bite. Cas looked unwell.
“Dean, please—” Cas started, but the words were lost in a gasp when an uncontrolled jut of his hips slid the hardening line of his cock against Dean’s, who forgot the apron to slide his hands over the curve of Cas’ ass. He grabbed almost too hard, reaching down the back of Cas’ thighs to lift strong legs up around his waist.
“What we did, or what choices we thought we made, we still couldn’t win. And now everything Sammy and I have been through, every fight we’ve come out the other side of, it doesn’t matter, because we lost. It was all for nothing.”
“Oh man. We need to get you more stuff.” Dean got up and grabbed him a pair of sweats and an old Kansas t-shirt from the drawer. “Try these for now,” he said as he tossed them over to Cas, who took a moment to look at the clothes before standing to change.
“I’m fucking great,” he shot back. Bobby and Sam shared a look that Dean caught pass between them. “Would you two drop it? Say whatever you’re going to say or cut it the fuck out.”
Dean dragged him up by the shirt and pushed him back onto the bed. He hit the hard mattress and Dean was on him, tasting himself as he pushed his tongue into Cas’ mouth.
Charlie was planted in a chair, leaned-back with one ankle resting on her knee. He was huddled next to Cas, pushed closer together as a couple of Charlie’s friends joined the party. Dean was aware of every point of contact between them, and he may have, once or twice, given in and rested his hand on the angel’s knee, ignoring the fact his brother was sitting close to them at the far end of the bench.
Dean could feel fingers pressing firmly into his skin, Cas’ thumb moving across the joint of his jaw to rest behind his ear. He was too tired to push his hand away. Too angry. Too glad to have him back.
Long chapter. Lots happened. This was the chapter that made me realize how much I loved Afriel and Turiel, which made me sad that it was so close to the end.
“Good night?” he asked, watching Dean with an amused twitch of his mouth as he fired up the coffee maker.
They both stayed quiet as they calmed down and cleaned up, and when Dean’s heart rate had taken a step back from verging on full cardiac arrest, he curled into Cas as his wings wrapped around them.
The back of Dean’s throat was tightening at the smell. He would not puke in front of Cas. Not unless a crap ton of alcohol was involved, and definitely not over some rotten bread and vegetables. A memory tried to push its way into his consciousness, of John screaming at him for getting sick on the carpet of some cheap motel when he was ten. He’d had the flu, but he wasn’t sure if his fever or the shame of disappointing his dad burned hotter.
Days went on like this. Sam hunkered over the massive book in the library, working his way through years of paranormal inventory with bloodshot eyes. The others breathing in dust and getting the occasional ugly shock from some cursed object Cas missed and hunting for something they knew next to nothing about.
It was so easy to forget what the rest of the world looked like when you were holed up for so long. Dean and Sam had spent their entire childhoods—and most of their adulthoods—in small, sleepy towns, or locked away in hotel rooms, or driving down long, barely-used highways. They were used to being the centre of their own worlds, with maybe one or two monsters thrown in.
“The key,” Larry confirmed, nodding. “It opens the lock that protects every object, scroll, and spell the Men of Letters ever collected. A thousand years of history under one roof.”
“No, no, I’m good,” he said lamely, relaying the classic words of a weathered alcoholic trying to save face.
“Alright, let’s head back to the motel and check on the cars. And I need a minute to, I dunno, freshen up,” Dean said, looking for an excuse to step away from his uncle and brother for a second.
The sun set earlier these days, or at least, it got dark faster. The dim grey light made it hard to see, even the stationary trailer homes and tiny bungalows that peppered the side of the road were getting more difficult to make out in the gloom. They hadn’t slept the night before, opting instead to make one last long drive closer to the coast to see if they could find anything to bring back to Bobby’s. It had been a bust, and they were still at least a day away from Sioux Falls.
“Hands off, Cas,” he warned, pushing himself away from the dilapidated trailer wall to stand on his own shaky feet away from the angel.
Sam pointed to the symbol etched into the door—shallow grooves carved into the wood. The Aquarian Star. “Men of Letters,” he said simply.
“Sooner. Tonight. Sam said it’s, what, a nine-hour drive? Ten?” Dean looked to his brother for confirmation.
Breaking the red seal and pulling out the note, he squinted as he read the looping handwriting. He handed the note to Sam without a word.
“I wasn’t unfeeling when my connection to the Host was stronger, but everything was muted. And now I have to manage anger, hopelessness, guilt, d—” He stopped, cutting himself off to lean back and rub his hand over his face.
The angel pushed off the car and turned to pull Dean into a hug. He fell into it, turning his head to find that scent that was so uniquely Cas, but it was masked by the ashy smell of dust matted on his collar. He wrapped his arms around a firm waist and took a deep breath and allowed himself, for just a moment, to stop thinking so damn much.
He’d never get his fill of that mouth, but he pulled away, needing to know if Cas’ throat tasted as good as his mouth did. And once that skin was laid out in front of him he couldn’t keep his teeth or tongue off of it.
“However, I think because of the limited information available, our options are also limited,” Cas said, and pressed down again—his fingers dipping between Dean’s spread legs and then dragging back up over the hardening outline that curved towards his hip.
“Well it’s about friggin’ time,” Bobby said, greeting them in the hallway and dropping the shotgun to his side, “What’cha bring me?”
The rest of the day they spent in pairs, moving the corpses of people who they’d fought beside into a pile outside of the fence. They didn’t burn them. Sam was right, they didn’t have the fuel.
“I’m losing everything I am,” he said, small and unsure. He looked so goddamn it human it broke Dean’s heart.
He rolled over and focused on trying not to puke, but he knew from experience the liquor still in his system was holding back the worst of the hangover.
The next morning, Dean walked into the library wrapped in a blue robe he found hanging in the shower room.
As Bobby’s laughter faded, he pushed back his hat so Dean could see more of his face. “That house was my life. It’s where I lived with my wife. Where she… died. It’s where you and your brother would watch monster movies with me when your dad was out of town and eat so much damn popcorn you’d puke,” His face, that had been so full of manic joy just a moment ago, fell, and his mouth pulled in tight.
Another big thank you to the world's best Beta Tardimaid and to everyone who is reading and showing their love.
Afriel didn’t answer but made how she felt known by sitting down and resolutely not looking out of the window. Instead, she picked up a dusty copy of something called Us Weekly and read quietly.
He and Sam had been on a hunt. There was a witch in Charming Acres, Arkansas, who was going dark side and hurting people along the way. She’d told them her victims were grotesque abominations, that she could see the ugly, twisted faces they hid so easily behind their human masks. She said it was only a matter of time before they committed horrible acts of violence, or worse.
