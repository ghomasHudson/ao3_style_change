The second body was not in Whitechapel. It was, instead, abandoned in the docks
“Two,” said I. Match set. He surrendered, and did not inquire further.
“You didn’t think he’d kill him.”
“Please, sir,” said he, “I offer no resistance. I am no danger to you. There is no need for that.” My hand did not shake or waver.
“Even those killers you so love to capture?” Malcom asked. Another strike. I wished very desperately to split the skin of my knuckles over his teeth.
Within the seclusion of Baker Street, I had expected Holmes to let loose the torrent of anger I knew he was holding within himself. This outrage was a particular talent of his. He could call forth a great surge of emotion as soon as our door was latched, letting out strings of curses and foulness I will not record here. This anger was never turned on me nor a person of any decency. It was reserved for those men that he dedicated himself to hunting with the patience and passion of a hungry fox.
“It was the brother, George,” I said softly.
Instead, I made tea. It is a distinct skill of the British to be able to step around the terror in a room with routine. While my life with Holmes didn’t allow for much of that, tea was perhaps the only ritual that I would carry with me from cradle to grave. As the water heated over our fire, I sat quietly beside him in my own chair, pretending to find interest in a novel that had been tossed carelessly onto the floor from Holmes’ seat. Upon reading the title; A House of Pomegrantes; I set it aside and quelled the churning of my gut to continue the ritual.
The sea air did much to clear my senses as we walked across the dock, Lestrade hurrying our leasurly evening pace. We had gone on occasional walks such as this, when Holmes was kept awake deep into the evening by his constant train of manic thought. It hardly bothered me to accompany him, at first employing the excuse of offering protection to the dangerous district. It is embarrassing to admit now that I would use this even when the both of us knew that Holmes required no protection of any kind. For some time after meeting him, my companion had seemed to me very fragile. He ate infrequently and slept even less, and his tall, thin frame made him out to be an unstable structure, ready to fall in the wind. I learned over time, however, that there was strength hidden in his limbs. He was fast, cunning, and deadly in a fight. Although I had my military training and my gun at my disposal, I have not been disillusioned to believe that Sherlock Holmes requires my protection for a very long time.
The door was cracked open, and I could see a sliver of the study, lit only by the moon. And there, standing tall against the light was Holmes. He was unharmed, but his posture was tense and rippling, ready to pounce at any moment. I would have raced into the room the instant I saw him had his grey eyes not cut across the darkness and landed on mine for only a moment.
“He didn’t,” Percival shook his head slowly back and forth, his eyes still wide and filled with horror. “George did. Upon his order, of course but…”
“My dear, you forget that we have trespassed upon the most sacred places in England. Why, I’ve watched you pick locks to churches and cathedrals along with palaces and mansions. No, it does not trouble me.” He looked ever so slightly relieved. In Holmes’ work, the law was often broken. Even after all of these years, whenever criminal activity came into play, he would always allow me a manner of escape from the conversation, an amount of deniability. I had landed in a holding cell with Holmes before. I would gladly do it again. Even so, my heart warmed at his care.
“Come, Watson,” said he, “we shall see you to Baker Street and in front of the fire before the sun has risen.
“You were historically young when you first joined Parliament,” Holmes said. “Thirty years ago now, wasn’t it?”
“My boy,” said I, “tell me what has happened. Quickly, we haven’t much time.” He took only a moment to collect the breath he would need to speak.
Leaves in water, water through strainer, water in cup, cup served. Two sugars for him, none for me. It was as simple as walking, as bending my fingers into a fist.
Ernest Malcolm was an old man, nearly seventy years old, and thin as a sapling. He rose as we entered to greet us. Holmes’ face was pictured in the newspapers enough for recognition to cross his features.
In my few moments of life threatening danger, I could always find solace and joy in the little ways that Holmes reacted to it. Let it not be said that I enjoyed seeing my companion panic, much the opposite. It disturbed me to see a man so usually calm in the face of death and harm melted into a thing of worry and fear. It was perhaps a sick appreciation of the fact that he only acted this way for me. He certainly did and does care for those outside of our relationship, but he approaches their danger with the same cool indifference he carries about him at all times. He explained it to me once, as a form of protection.
“He and Charles Malcom,” said I, “they were…”
The smell of a morgue was one I knew well, but never quite grew accustomed to. Death had to it a strangely sweet smell, and it often stuck to Holmes’ clothes and hair. I rather preferred the scent of his favorite perfume, something with rose hips that he would spray upon occasion. Anything to cover the smell of decomposition that left me sleepless.
You will understand, then, my Holmes, that I was so enraptured by your sublimness that I was struck dumb for no more than a moment.
What would be a quiet, almost romantic backdrop to our walk was marred with muffled shouts in the distance. News had spread quickly of the young man in Whitechapel, and the fact of his persuasion was of chief importance in these whispers. It was no wonder that a crowd had gathered around a body killed in such a similar manner.
“Then yes, Watson, I intend to trespass. I’ll need your help with this, along with, perhaps Lestrade, although I would prefer not to involve him.” He took another moment to collect his wandering thoughts.
“Oh, Freddy, dear Freddy,” he pressed his face into his hands with a heave of great shame. It was clear to me that this boy was in the midst of grief, and that there had not been a soul for him to tell. I placed my revolver back into my pocket, and stepped back ever so slightly.
He did not touch his cup as I set it beside him and settled with my own. Instead, he studied the fire with some distant and ferocious focus.
“His eyes,” said I, clutching on to the collar of Holmes’s vest. “Like Malcom’s. They were green.” Confusion passed over his fine features for only a breath before it seemed to click into place in his mind.
I was not fooled by this pretense, but it was with a certain amount of glee that I noticed that this act could not continue in the case of my own injury. I had noted long ago the way his long hands flapped uselessly as he attempted to cure my ails with his nimble fingers alone. I have recorded his often vicious reactions upon my harm, his threats of murder, of torture, of dismemberment and experimentation and fates far worse than death. It was, perhaps the way that his eyes met mine. They were usually grey, cold, and steely. When they found mine in fear, however, his eyes were wet and his eyes were blue.
“Charles is-“ his face screwed up painfully “- was my brother. I had to see him. I had to see what I had brought upon him.”
Holmes’s beauty often struck me in the early hours of the morning, when his harsh features are softened by early sun. His sublimeness always comes to me in moments like this. My Holmes has the distinct talent of being sublime in ugly and terrible times. Drenched in blood, his blue eyes are sharp and cold. When covered in dirt and twisted with pain, his skin always appears to be porcelain, and able to cut like any broken glass. When bent out of shape, his hooked nose frames his face in such a startling fashion it feels an impossible feat to look away.
“He was by all indications the same age as Malcom. According to one of the dock workers, he was a ship hand named Fredrick. No surname. There were no rumors that he could be…”
“Had to?” I restrained myself from shouting, but only just. “You have never had to do anything, Sherlock, you have never allowed yourself to be told what to do, so please, do not insult me by pretending that this was anything besides your own choice.”
“Please, gentlemen,” He waved towards the fine armchairs set in front of his oak desk. I let Holmes move first and followed dutifully at his side.
Holmes’ eyes flicked to mine critically at the word. It had been decided long ago that we refer to bodies as what they were; bodies. My tendency to assign them title in conversations with Holmes was quickly addressed. It was no use to remind ourselves what they once were. The soul that had inhabited them was gone, and so the only thing we could do was bury them and give their families peace.
Holmes did not correct me then. He continued with caution, his voice level.
“I am hardly a detective. More of an enthusiast.” Parry.
“I am a man medicine,” I replied, “it is not within my oath to condone harm on any living thing.”
“And should I listen to you?” Malcolm spit. “A bugger in your own right? What man of moral standing fights for those so lowly?”
His short, measured footsteps crossed the small space between us quickly. I opened my eyes to Holmes knelt before of me. His face was twisted imperceptibly, and I worried for a heartbeat that I had offended him with my careless statement. His eyes, still blue, softened, and his warm hand rested upon my cheek.
“This is a matter I was hoping for your expertise in.” Holmes mused, spinning his pipe in his fingers although it was not lit. I nodded and indicated for him to continue. “The Malcolm estate is heavily staffed. I doubt that they’ll simply let us in without announcing it.”
The moment passed, as I moved, rushed into the room with my gun raised. I would not squander Holmes’ sacrifice by killing the man before me, no matter how I longed to. As soon as he heard the cock of my revolver, Malcolm blanched and dropped his cane, cowering back away from me. An instant later, Lestrade was bursting into the room with his men, overcoming old Malcolm and placing him in chains.
The clattering of a candle holder hitting the ground startled me from my slow approach to the second to last door. I spun around, my hand flying to the revolver in my pocket. There stood behind me the frightened face of the young man who had thrown me in the river, of Charles Malcolm’s brother. Those emerald eyes shone in the wavering candle light. He bent quickly to gather it before the flame could scorch the carpet, and by the time that he was righted again, the muzzle of my gun was pointed squarely at his chest. I jerked my head once towards the last room. A question. Yours? He nodded curtly once, and began to move slowly towards it. I followed, never lowering my hand, never losing my clear shot.
“I understand,” I said, placing a hand on his shoulder to help him regain his balance. “I feel quite the same. Let’s return home, then, yes?”
From there, Holmes, Lestrade, and I proceeded into the empty manor, making our way through the untouched rooms towards the study. I could see the slightest shake in Holmes’ hand. When we came upon the staircase leading up to the residential wing of the house, our party split. With one last glance at Holmes, I made my way up the large staircase. The rooms were large and spread apart. Most of the family had retired for the evening already, and I checked every room for its inhibitance before locking it with the keys given to me by the butler. I was almost done with this task when interrupted.
Holmes did not wake until the early afternoon, by which time I had managed to stitch the cut on his head and shoo away Mrs. Hudson from worrying over him. I couldn’t do that when she was in the room, so once she left, I took up her noble post. I was brushing back the long, delicate curls of his hair when his eyes cracked open, bluer than the ocean. He observed me for a moment, and must have read the quiet anger off of my features, for he immediately closed his eyes again.
I could not bear to look at him any longer, so I turned my attention to the crowd. It seemed to be mostly folk of the area, dressed in similar fashion to the young man. There were no kindred spirits that I could see this time. No carnation boys, no violet girls. I felt a very strange sense of isolation. Although Holmes was a few meters from me, I felt as though the only creature like me in any way was dead on the dock.
“I believe,” Holmes said, breaking our comfortable silence. “That we must pay Malcolm and his sons another visit.” I nodded, and although the thought of that large, empty house formed a pit in my stomach, I pushed the thoughts away. “You should sleep first,” Holmes said after a moment. My eyes flashed to his.
“I do not appreciate,” said I, “when you decide to throw yourself into danger without consulting me. You know this.” I tried very hard to keep my tone light and soothing, although it was difficult when looking down at the man I loved, injured of his own accord.
“Ah, but I am still cold,” said I, “I will require you to keep me warm.”
“And the other?”
“1861, yes.” Malcolm replied. “You, Detective, were hardly a babe.” Strike.
It was not a common occurrence that Sherlock Holmes shied away from his words.
“Given you placed what appears to be one of the remaining Malcom children at both scenes?” Holmes nodded solemnly.
“Sherlock,” said I, “how can we-“ the sound of our front door pouding open startled me away from him. I shot across the room as quickly as I had come, and tried to appear busy despite my shock. Only a moment later, Lestrade burst into our rooms.
“You foolish man.” Perhaps there was a moment of desperation or fear that cut across Malcolm’s face, for I saw the hint of a smile creep into Holmes’ features.
Holmes healed nicely, leaving only a fair scar just below his hairline. His curls would bounce and cover it most of the time, but as with most of his scars, he didn’t care to hide it away as a thing of shame. He was proud of that scar in particular. It was the one that had brought low the man who, in his opinion, was the most wretched of all. It was a scar of victory, and a scar of revenge for Charles, for Fredrick, for himself, for every carnation man and violet lady who walked the streets of London in fear. One less monster hid in the dark, hungry for their blood.
I tossed my hand high above my head and felt it break into the chilled air. A moment later, liquid warmth spread across the skin of my palm as Holmes’s hand slotted into mine so perfectly, as though it were the only place it could possibly fit.
That musical laugh lulled me away from the danger of the night before and into the safety and warmth of the new morning.
“Mr. Holmes,” said he, his voice as sharp and crude as a razor. “And…” he looked towards me. I nodded and replied.
“Young,” he said, “very young. No more than 20. Well to do, a fine family. A signet ring on the little finger of his left hand said as much. A fighter, if the blood and dents in it are any indication.”
“Alright,” said I, setting into my armchair across from his after my late lunch. “How will we proceed this evening?”
As I came upon him, my hands clamping down on his shoulders, he jumped from his shock into motion. In retrospect, I can only regard his next actions with the respect of a fighter. During my time at war, although a medic, I had still experienced a fair share of close combat. This only increased in frequency when I joined Holmes. So, I should have been prepared for the way that the young man shifted his weight so he might kick my legs out from under me and shove me the short distance between him and the dock.
Holmes and I slept through the morning in a quiet haze. I could feel him stir every once in a while, unable to stay calm and still when his mind had such a case to entertain. Even so, every time that I believed he would rise from bed and leave me to keep myself warm, he stayed, curling tighter around me. I had asked him directly, and so he would stay. By the time that I roused completely and was coaxed into dressing by Holmes, it was afternoon. Although I had been known to sleep late into the morning, I hadn’t laid in this late since my first days home from Afghanistan, which I spent tangled in bedsheets without rising for drink or food.
This plan was almost as clever as it was idiotic. Holmes would make a good witness, yes, but only if he survived to see the court.
“Dr. Watson.”
“Even them,” Holmes replied, unbothered. “If we kill the killers, we are no better men than they are.” A counter with a flourish of pride.
“You are far more likely to be punished for aiding in murder.” I replied. Perhaps I was too harsh on the boy. He looked to be suffering already, the ghosts of his brother and the man he loved tormenting him from beyond the grave. However, the persisting instinct to protect himself over one so vulnerable made my stomach turn. How many men like Percival did I know? How many men that I called brother would gladly turn their backs on me to save themselves?
The water hit me like a sheet of ice, curling through my layers of clothing and biting my skin in vicious strikes. The breath was shocked out of my lungs, and I dragged in one horrible mouthful of brackish, polluted water. I had the instinct to try and push myself up, although my limbs were numb and I had barely any sense to tell floor from surface. There was no light to give it away, and I couldn’t bear to open my eyes against the stinging cold, so I just swam. After a few excruciating moments in which I was certain I was only driving myself deeper into the depths, I broke through the surface. I hacked, spat out water, and I was dragged back down by the force of the current. I hadn’t the strength to wade in the water and try to climb out. In my short second above the water, though, I heard Holmes’ shrill, panicked voice call out;
“Out with it,” said I, “tell me what to do.”
“Holmes,” I said after an hour of such behavior, “Sherlock,” I said, since we had finally been left alone by Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson. “There is nothing to do but wait for me to warm up. Sit down.” He seemed begrudged to adhere to my request, but he did after a moment. He folded his long fingers together in his lap. “Tell me what you found out about the boy.”
“What good is killing them,” said he, “if everyone believes I haven’t a heart to care?”
“Are you fond of sodomites, Mr. Holmes?” Bait taken. Holmes’ face did not slip from his nonchalant mask, but I knew his eyes well enough to see them torn between disgust and excitement. He laughed easily.
“You, my dear doctor, would defy God and His law for me?” He laughed a soft, musical laugh. I responded with my own.
It was then that I realized; Holmes’ silence was not out of stoicism. It was out of horror, a state I so rarely saw in him that it stirred some great fear in myself.
“He was to meet a lover?” The word tasted sour in my mouth. Homes nodded, his eyes wearily tracking the dancing flames.
“I have no idea what you are implying, Inspector,” I said, guarding myself and Holmes carefully, “but if I did, I should say that I was rather grateful for your moral standings.”
There was strength in Holmes’ limbs, yes, but not nearly enough to drag me, soaking wet, up several meters to the dock alone. I was only lucky that Lestrade was quick to follow and hooked his arm under mine. Together they hauled me up onto the damp wood of the dock
Lestrade had seemed to earn a certain amount of respect, although Holmes would often rant and rave about his lack of mental capacity. After all of the years that Lestrade had accompanied us on our adventures, it was hard to believe that he hadn’t absorbed any of Holmes’ methods. Even so, he seemed hopelessly lost and set in the Scotland Yard ways.
Our trip to the morgue the following day was inevitable, but dreaded. We both took our time about it, stretching our morning as long as the hours would allow. On any other investigation, Holmes would be out of Baker Street by first light, dragging me along with him. Instead, we waited until mid morning before admitting there was very little else we could do to stall the visit.
His badge, however, was far more capable than he.
When we called upon the Malcolm estate late that evening, the butler answered our ring and was met by that very badge. Before he could call out for assistance, Lestrade was quietly instructing him to gather the servants below and to leave the house out of the kitchen door, where they would be collected and questioned by Scotland Yard officers. The poor man’s face was a mixture of pale white and sickly green, as though his body couldn’t decide whether to vomit or faint away.
“I would defy anything for you,” I insisted. I bent the short distance between us and kissed him deeply, allowing all of my fear and anger and hatred to fall away in that moment. When finally our lips parted, I rested my forehead against his. “Besides, what else have we been doing these few years besides defying God?”
Upon leaving the home of Ernest Malcolm, Holmes began to look pale and off balance. I longed to wrap an arm around his trim waist. Instead I steady him with a hand on his elbow and passed him the cane I carried with me. He smiled and accepted, leaning on it as we walked. We were only a few streets shy of Baker Street when he ducked into an alley very suddenly, emptying his stomach of our breakfast. I moved quickly to try and comfort him, but I hesitated. I could not rub my hand down his back as I wanted to. I could not smooth the hair from his forehead.
“Watson,” He breathed, dragging me to sit with his assistance. I still had in me a bit of water to cough up, and he was waited patiently for my response as he started to drag my sodden coat off of my shoulders, replacing it with his own. When I finally had breath in me again, I spoke.
“Watson-“ he began, his voice the same as it always was in these moments; tired, vulnerable, apologetic. Perhaps even sheepish, if Sherlock Holmes were capable of such a thing.
“Yesterday you had three.” Holmes had begun to look rather bored with the whole conversation. He was moving it along quickly now. “Or perhaps you miscounted. Either way, Charles is waiting in the St. James Morgue.”
Very little comfort could be given while the sun still shone, and Holmes had much to attend to. I left him to his notes and research, focusing on the report sent to me by Lestrade from the morgue. It was as gruesome as I had feared, and not a painless death.
The body of the young man was laid out and stripped of his fine suit, displaying the harsh bruises against his translucent skin. Under closer observation, the right side of his head was collapsed, the skin sagging around the displaced bone. His right eye was missing, although I could not be sure whether that was a result of the attack or the morgue. His left eye was green and clouded over, still open.
That respect only comes with retrospect, however. During the moment, I was horrified, cold, and angry.
“Well,” said I, “the Inspector will be interested in your testimony.” Percival looked up at me in surprise.
“I’m a young man,” Holmes replied, “I care nothing for politics. You did, however, when you were my age. 1861 was quite the exciting year in British law making.” Counterstrike.
“Holmes,” he said, “there has been another.”
“Why were you at both crime scenes?” I interrupted. He looked confused for a moment before answering.
“Watson,” said he, “his effects,” he waved towards a pile of clothing on a table across the room. I acquiesced and began to unfold his clothing in hopes of identifying the young man. His cost was charcoal and finely made, wool strong enough to keep out the winter cold. It was lined with green silk of the same quality as the figure who had fled the scene of his death. The details of that man came back to me in that moment, and as I turned to tell Holmes, he was already walking towards me.
“Where is Holmes? He will want to speak to the brothers.” I asked. Lestrade looked at me strangely, and my heart seemed to quicken in my chest.
“What did you hope I would bring to this?” He asked. “Quiet obedience? No. You have chosen the wrong victim for that.”
“He wasn’t with you?”
My blood still ran cold at the word. Sodom and Gomorrah had been leering over my shoulder since I had first set my eyes upon Sherlock Holmes. I knew, gazing upon him in bent over his cultures that day, that I was a creature of sin if there ever was one. I had given up thoughts of hell along with melancholy after the war, but every time I heard that word, it brought them to the front of my mind. My two responses were unbridled fear and uncontrollable rage. Instead of weeping or screaming or putting my fist through the wall, I instead moved forward to embrace Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes was and is not only beautiful. There belongs in that sentence a much stronger word. Sherlock Holmes was and is also sublime. I have read the writings of Edmund Berk, and over time observing the ways of my Holmes, I have come to subscribe to his philosophy full heartedly. Beauty is a word for soft, mild, and fair creatures. Sublime is a word for the kind of beautiful things that terrify. Think not of spring flowers or the wave of skirts in the wind. Think of the ocean. Indeed, it is a thing of comfort and coolness and salty reprieve from sickness and wound. Indeed, it is also the wicked churning that overturns ships and eats men whole. I have known many women to be beautiful, and only one to be sublime. I have known many men to be symmetrical, to be strong, and aesthetically pleasing. I have known very few to be beautiful. I know only one to be all at once.
“My dearest John,” said he, “I should sooner cast myself into the pits of hell than allow you, whether in life or death, to be treated in such a manner.” The severity in his voice ran a shiver up my spine that I would blame on the cold. He drew closer, and his lips brushed against mine in a chaste kiss.
When John walked into the room, there was a few moments awkwardness while they established sides of the bed and climbed in. It was more than a little different when they were both awake but they soon fell into a comfortable silence. John fell asleep first and Sherlock wasted no time curling up against him once he was sleeping. ‘This is better than any drug,’ was the last thought that crossed the detective’s mind before he fell asleep.
“Bit of time off, I’m filling in. Shall we?” The woman responded never looking up at Sherlock.
“Fine. It’s just Lestrade.”
Sherlock, at the same time, looked into the deep green of John’s eyes and finally clearly allowed himself to see what he had always dreamed was there. Sherlock could see the love and want in John’s eyes but he could also see the hesitation, the uncertainty. Sherlock knew he would do anything to make John know that the feelings were emphatically mutual. There was no need for doubt any longer.
“Yours. It’s got a bigger bed and nicer sheets. It would probably be better. Let me go see if I left any pajamas here.” He jogged upstairs and came down a few minutes later in an old pair of pajama bottoms and the same undershirt he had been wearing earlier.
John shook his head. Bloody Mycroft. "I have a lot to tell and I know you are going to have questions so bear with me, yeah?" Sherlock looked confused and intrigued, he offered a small nod even though he knew he would still interrupt with questions.
John’s brow furrowed as he took in this new information, his heart pounding so hard he thought for sure it would break through his ribs. “Sherlock, you are going to need to be really clear right now. Are you saying what I think you are saying?”
“Yes, Dr. Watson, a cuppa would be most agreeable. I’ve been waiting for you to wake up, I have something rather urgent to discuss with you.”
“Are-are you sure?”
“Something I’ve been composing for a while. Untitled thus far.”
“G’nght, Sh’lock,” came the groggy reply.
John in turn looked at Sherlock. The grey blue eyes that were normally shielded against scrutiny were open for John to read. He saw the sadness, hurt, concern, exhaustion, and something else. John couldn’t quite put his finger on the that last one. Had it been anyone else, he would have said love and longing but this was Sherlock and that didn’t make sense. John noticed that Sherlock’s already lanky frame had gotten smaller. The posh dress shirts that Sherlock usually wore hung loosely on him. John had always laughed to himself that one of those days they buttons were going to give up the struggle as they often were pulled taunt across Sherlock’s chest. This was no longer the case and this made John cringe. His cheekbones more pronounced and his eyes a bit more sunken in. His normally inky black curls had lost their luster. Where ever Sherlock had been, he had taken worse care of himself then he ever did before. John didn’t know Sherlock when he was addicted to drugs but suddenly he could imagine what he may have looked like.
“John, my John, I love you.” Sherlock whispered.
‘Being kidnapped as we speak. They want me to believe I’m going to see you. Not very smart, haven’t taken my phone away. Please track my phone and contact Lestrade and John with my location. –SH’
“Thank you. Shall we?”
“Morning. I don’t remember falling asleep. Hope I haven't kept you trapped here.”
The boys are getting ready for dinner. But is it a date?
“You can hardly blame him, John. You are one of the best. And of course you are still welcome. But for God’s sake, I don’t keep you around for your atrocious blog. You are my partner. You are as much as a consulting detective as I am. Even if my methods are superior.” Sherlock flopped himself down on the couch. “Tea, John.”
As Angelo walked back to the table carrying two delicious looking plates of food, John was saying, “To this day, I’m skeptical when you make the tea or coffee that there might be some hallucinogenic drug in there.” “It was just the once, John.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Once was enough!”
“Mycroft is arranging to have your belongings packed from your previous flat and he asked me if he should have them delivered here.”
The two men looked at each other and started laughing. The air around them had been so heavy, this felt right. Their normal bantering. They had both missed it immensely. Once they were able to stop laughing, they finished making tea and sat at the kitchen table. Ignoring the elephant in the room for now, they started talking: John catching Sherlock up on what had been happening with their group of friends over the past few years. Sherlock telling about the interesting people he met abroad during his mission and the insufferable things Mycroft had done while he was gone. As they passed the evening chatting away and getting their favorite take away, they decided to watch a few episodes of Dr. Who. It was the one show that kept Sherlock entertained enough to follow and not completely tear apart as they watched. He had missed quite a lot while he was away. It wasn’t until several episodes later, when Sherlock and John were dosing off on the couch, that Mary finally crossed John’s mind. As he felt Sherlock cover him with the throw from the couch, he decided he could call Mary tomorrow.
“I can’t get a human kidney at Tesco, Sherlock.”
Sherlock realized, he couldn’t delete John even if he tried, which he wasn’t wont to do. John brought him back to his humanity. A side he hadn’t seen in a very,very long time. He would deny it to everyone who asked, but he liked better the man he had become thanks to John. He smirked to himself as he realized he was just too selfish to ever let John go without a fight. He was Sherlock Holmes for God’s sake. Ultimately, he would do as John wished but he couldn’t let go without trying. He didn’t even know if John loved him back as he insisted to anyone who listened that he was not gay. But something about having John even in just close proximity, living at Baker Street with him would be enough. It would have to be. He needed John more than he was willing to admit. He knew it was wrong on some level to try to make John remain single just because he wanted him around but Sherlock didn’t care. He was more than willing to offer whatever physical assistance he could for John’s needs and companionship would not be a problem at all.
Sitting in his office trying to get the last bits of paperwork out of the way, John couldn’t help but wonder why Sherlock wanted to go out to dinner. Sherlock was not a big eater but then if he were to want to eat, of course it would be Angelo’s. If ever John couldn’t get Sherlock to eat for too long, he would get him a plate made especially by Angelo and Sherlock would eat a healthy portion. He long since gave up on trying to sort out Sherlock’s eating habits. He just encouraged him to eat as much as he could and hoped it was enough. He figured with no cases to keep him busy for the past few days, maybe Sherlock was feeling a bit cooped up. John checked the clock and saw it was 5pm. He went to the bathroom to freshen up a bit from the long day and then headed to get across London to meet Sherlock.
“I don’t need to know that. I’m sure it was very clever but that's not important. Why couldn’t you have told me? I would’ve gone with you and helped you. You get yourself into enough trouble here, I can’t imagine the danger you were in out there.”
“Mmmmm.” Came John’s sleepy reply. He stood, took the clothes Sherlock was holding out to him, and went to the bathroom.
John wandered into the living room. He wasn't sure what he was looking for but felt like he should be doing something. He looked at the photographs on the credenza. Something caught his eye. A picture of what was likely the whole family. He picked up the frame and walked back into the dining room. There were 6 people in the photo, but only 5 bodies.
Everything stopped for the men as realization dawned on both of them. Not a word was said but they read everything in each other's eyes and faces. One of John's hands reached up and gently, almost hesitatingly, cupped Sherlock's cheek, running a thumb along those ridiculous cheekbones. The detective leaned his head into the touch. At the same time, he ran his hand up John's back and rested just behind his neck while he adjusted his other arm to be properly wrapped around his waist, holding him as if he was the most precious thing in all the world. Finally, after years of denying their feelings, dying, coming back, escapades all over the world kept secret from each other, and their enemies finally slain, their lips met for the first time.
Sherlock POV
Two Days Later
Suddenly, a very angry DI burst through the door, making them both jump. "Goddamnit, Sherlock!! Stop avoiding my calls, I need you on this!" Lestrade came to a halt when he saw Sherlock kneeling between John's legs, he had clearly interrupted something.
“Molly, I find myself out of my depths and I need your advice on a rather personal matter.” Sherlock said cooly. At least he hoped he sounded slightly detached. This was difficult, opening himself up to Molly, even though she is who he turned to when he needed help with faking his suicide.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock's face fell. What had he done to the cuddly, jumper wearing doctor? His actions he knew would hurt the doctor but in the end it was to save him. Sherlock raised his steely
At Sherlock’s words, John was painfully aroused. Sherlock wanted him. He looked at John as if he was some precious treasure and John loved that. John was usually the one offering flattery and making the other person feel this way. He loved feeling it himself.
“Everything alright, Sherlock?” John looked concerned as now Sherlock’s phone was ringing and the detective appeared determined to ignore it.
Finally some action!
Before Sherlock could rip into his brother with his own deductions, John interrupted.
His voice dropped sounding deep and husky, “Make a deduction, John.”
“Should we tell Mrs. Hudson that we won’t be needing the second bedroom?” John laughed.
“I see we had a friend in common. Work for Jim for long?”
“The face you make when you talk to him is hardly a complicated deduction even for those of us who aren’t geniuses.”
The early morning hours found John Watson in the kitchen of 221B Baker Street making a cuppa. After a night of strange dreams, he had abandoned sleep. He couldn’t for the life of him figure out why he was having such vivid, romantic dreams about his flatmate. He is straight, as he often pointed out to those who assumed he and Sherlock Holmes were a couple. Wasn’t he? It hit him last night when they returned from a case that resulted in both of them taking a dip in the Thames. Sherlock in pursuit of the criminal, John to rescue Sherlock as the detective struggled with the criminal and almost went under. They arrived home and started to peel the layers of sopping wet clothing off themselves. John found breathing difficult when Sherlock deposited the Belstaff coat on a chair and his purple shirt was literally painted on to him. The buttons strained on a good day but they almost gave up the fight when wet and pulled tightly across his chest. John almost lost it when Sherlock started to remove the shirt and exposed his pale chest. He had gotten extremely turned on by this. He excused himself to the shower as quickly as possible to avoid any embarrassment if Sherlock noticed his, uhem, issue.
Sherlock, having heard his annoying brother, entered the kitchen. “Go away, brother mine. It’s far too early for your ‘matters of national importance.’”
Wow! Thank you all for reading and the kudos! I'm really enjoying writing this fiction.
Sherlock and John were once again alone in the flat. There was almost an awkward silence as each tried to figure out how to proceed. John quickly tidied up the kitchen table while Sherlock put the dishes in the sink.
Sherlock kissed John's forehead. "Are you sure?"
Sherlock was the first to break the silence. “John, I have to apologize for so much. I’m sorry first and foremost for putting you through all of that.  If I had any other choice that would have saved you and caused you less pain, believe me, I would have taken it. I’m so sorry for all the years your had to endure, defending a ghost. And I’m sorry for how I chose to tell you I was alive. In hindsight, it was extremely insensitive of me. I thought to try to make it a humorous surprise but I see that upon delivery, it was poorly thought out. I know it will take a lot of time, but I endeavor to make it all up to you. I hope someday you are able to forgive me.”
“I guess I’m up now.”
"I could be mistaken but there appears to be a family member missing. There are 6 people in this photo and only 5 bodies. It looks like there is a man missing from the dinner party."
‘About to find out. We’ve stopped. –SH’
After John left the flat, Sherlock couldn’t help but smirk. He didn’t know how to address the clear shift in their relationship or how to nudge it along the way he wanted but he could at least put forth some effort for his army doctor. He went to his room and stripped his bed and changed the sheets. It took a little convincing to get Mrs. Hudson to wash his duvet, but she eventually agreed. He ran the Hoover and did a quick wipe down of the dresser and nightstand, tossing a few samples that may have been laying about well past their prime. He opened the windows to air out the odor. It may not be as noticeable in the middle of the night but John would likely be offended by the smells when he was actually trying to fall asleep in the room. Might as well make his room as welcoming as possible. John appreciated a clean space. He knew John’s own bedroom was sparse but very clean and organized. Sherlock wanted to accept this change as something more than what it was, but he would have to be subtle to encourage this shift along. Being as considerate to John as he could without going completely overboard was the first step.
“We did it.”
“I did just ask, idiot.”
When they were finally at the top, John pushed Sherlock in to his room and closed the door; blocking out the world outside and planning to take his time to treasure everything he had.  Now this was what he called a Happy Christmas.
"Bloody hell, how could you possibly know that?  You're extraordinary, quite extraordinary."
“Yes, hello.  Pleased to meet you, Mrs Holmes.  Dad was unpacking so he said I could go and find the park and I met Sherlock and now we’re doing experiments.”
John blushed but smiled; always pleased when he got a compliment from Sherlock.
Sherlock joined in his laughter.  “I wasn’t imagining it would be so literal but, yes, I certainly do.  Are you offering?”
Sherlock blushed and took hold of John’s hand as he pulled him towards the bathroom.  They shed their clothes in the bedroom on the way past.  Sherlock turned the shower on to a pleasantly warm temperature and they got in.
Malcolm had his cane raised again, and must have mistaken Holmes’ hesitance for cowardice.
In that moment, though, I obeyed his silent order, as I almost always did. I crouched low by the door, my revolver steady, and listened. Malcolm was speaking with great anger
Instead of accompanying Malcolm and his sons to the police station, Lestrade traveled with me to assist in Holmes’ care however he might. After placing him in his bed and examining his wound carefully under the light, I was able to determine that it was far less devastating than I had feared. No fractures, no great swelling of the brain. His brow was scrunched in pain and I was sure he would bloom purple across his face come morning, but nothing that would threaten to take him away from me.
“What man of moral standing could kill his own child?” There, the slightest hint in his voice. His heart showed through, even as he scrambled to hide it away again. Malcolm took his chance. There was in his hand a thin, sturdy walking cane not unlike my own. He hefted it up, but underestimated Holme’s height. The strike that was surely meant to connect with his temple crushed instead into his shoulder. Holmes did not fall, nearly stumbled to the side and began to circle his opponent. Part of me wished to be comforted by this. Surely this stance was meant for protection. Surely this meant he would guard himself. I would not recognize until later the complacency in Holmes’ muscles. He was determined, he would later tell me, to create the image of a brutal attack. There was no room to explain away defensive wounds, to describe to the court why he, a healthy young man, would strike out at an old gentleman of the Parlement. Damn his stubborn mind, Holmes would not risk the conclusion of his case for something as simple as his health.
As it turned out, Lestrade was indeed needed for this endeavor, much to Holmes’ displeasure. While Sherlock Holmes was indeed a man of justice, he was not by any means a man of the law. If he could have conducted his work without ever speaking to another police officer, he would happily take the chance. The knowledge that the men he so often had to rely upon in his investigations would just as soon throw him into the jailhouse for his queerness was something that weighed heavily on Holmes, and he regarded most of the law men we worked with with a healthy amount of caution.
“There’s not a man alive who you wish dead?” Malcom asked. I kept my eyes level and answered honestly.
In my mournful glances around the crowd, I saw a familiar sight. A young man dressed finely, fair hair covered by a top hat. His eyes met mine for a moment, but in that moment, I could see that they were startlingly green. I began to run before I could process the familiarity in those eyes. It would only be later that I would recognize it was the same shade as the eyes of Charles Malcom, as the eyes of Ernest Malcom.
“Your name, please sir,” said I.
“Why then, if you are so enthusiastic,” Malcom said, “do you not join Scotland Yard?”
We carried on, as we always did. Holmes and Watson, men as close as brothers, who rooted out the seedy underbelly of our city. And, when no one was looking, men closer than anyone could imagine, delicate only to one another.
“And there he shall stay,” the words left Malcolm’s tongue as though he rehearsed them, as though disowning his son was a line he had memorized months ago. “He will not be claimed by this family.” Holmes’ eyes met his for a long, suffering moment. Ernest Malcolm had the same eyes as Charles Malcolm. The same, glassy green gaze stared out at Holmes, unseeing.
When the door was closed behind me, the young man seemed to let out a huff of relief.
I led Percival down to the servant’s exit and put him in the hands of an officer. Lestrade wasn’t far off, taking the testimony of the head maid. I caught his elbow in my hand and led him away.
“On your knees,” he said, spittle slipping through his teeth as he growled. Holmes kept his head high, meeting Malcom’s gaze with defiance.
“I’m afraid so,” said he, “but given the state of his clothing, he never made it.” I bowed my head, feeling for the first time in many years overcome by the tragedy of it all. I had given up melancholy after the war, but it crept into me as I thought about the poor boy who had been left waiting, and what he might have found when he finally stepped out of the bathhouse. My hand, hesitant and frightened, found Holmes’. There they sat, fingers tangled together, as morning stretched into afternoon.
True to his word, by the time that daylight broke through the cracks in our curtains, I was stripped, dried, and dressed before being swaddled in every blanket that Holmes could find and set in his chair before the fire. Holmes fluttered about me, adjusting blankets, fetching tea and brandy, pressing the back of his hand to my face to feel for returning warmth.
“Well… I don’t really know what to say to that.  I’ve been worrying about giving something away for so long now and then to find out that I actually told you without even realising is a bit of an anti-climax.”
“I don’t have a girlfriend.”
“I think ‘Be Prepared’ is the boy scouts motto, not the medical profession.”
John and Sherlock’s friendship built in strength from that first day onwards.  They explored the grounds, with Sherlock showing John all his secret places.  They played pirates by the lake and commandeered an old hut nearby as their hideout.  On one occasion, for Sherlock’s eighth birthday, John persuaded his dad to let him make a map to find buried treasure in a field which he had just turned over before it was re-planted.  John buried his present as the treasure and Sherlock was overjoyed to find a new pirate sword and a hoard of chocolate as his booty and they both decided that was the best day ever.
"Mummy!"
The only things that could have been doctored to target only one person were the plates or cups themselves, and after the party, they would have been put in the plastic recycling bins, so that was where Sherlock led them next.  They quickly found the plates and cups that had been used at the party.  Nothing else had been going on yesterday so there wasn’t anything that had been put in on top of them; luckily they hadn’t had anything messy or sticky to eat at the party, so they were all fairly clean.  Sherlock had brought a bag with him and he counted in all the plates and cups and, with a gleeful smile on his face, he turned to lead John over to the science labs.  This was one time that he was actually glad for something that Mycroft had done, as the special access pass he had to the labs would come in very handy.
John hoped his usual mild mannered appearance and previous friendship with Greg would stand him in good stead to help his friend out with his dilemma, even though he was now also part of the cause.  He held up a six pack of beer and a pizza which he’d brought as a peace offering.
“You expect me to have sex with you after that?  You really are crazy.  Get out of my way.  I need some air.”
John butted in, “Are you kidding, those bits were even more fun!”
“It doesn’t matter about that now.  Just come over here and hold John up as I pull out this bolt."
“It’ll be fun, you’ll see.”
"We don't usually have quite so many staff, don't let it overwhelm you.  Mummy always hires in extra help over Christmas, when we have the party and family staying over afterwards."
They exchanged parcels and grinned at each other as they both started in.  As Sherlock ripped the final bit of paper off and went to open the plain brown box inside, John paused in his own unwrapping as he wanted to watch Sherlock's face when he saw what it was.  Sherlock pushed the flaps aside and removed the crumpled tissue paper from off the top to see a hard, white circle surrounded by packing peanuts.  It looked like bone with the start of suture lines just visible on one edge where the packaging was lower.  Sherlock's eyes shot up to John's face, a questioning eyebrow rising almost to his hairline.  John grinned and nodded and Sherlock buried his fingers in the box to bring out its contents.  It was a genuine, perfectly preserved, human skull.
John ran over to Sherlock and bent down to look into his face.  He gently cupped Sherlock’s chin and tried to get his attention but he, too, had been caught in the blast of the stun grenade.
That night, Sherlock helped John to go through his lines.  They had been given a choice of four scenes and told to rehearse whichever scene featured the character they wanted to play.  John had decided he wanted to go for Major Metcalf and Sherlock told him that would be very good casting which gave John a boost of confidence.  Sherlock played the other part and by the end of the evening John was putting plenty of verve and energy into his characterisation.  Sherlock thought that barring any dramatic masterpieces from other students, John was a shoe-in.
“That is kind of the point.”
“Sorry, Sherlock.  You know I’m ticklish; I couldn’t help myself, it was just a reflex.”
Sherlock eventually dropped off for a slightly longer time after the thunder and lightning stopped.  He was lulled by the soft sound of the rain and pleasant thoughts of it washing away all trace of John’s girlfriends.
They manoeuvred John on to his bed and Sherlock stopped his hands as he did his best to start ripping off his clothes.  John grabbed on to Sherlock’s hands and held him there, pulling one hand up to his mouth and sloppily kissing it.  Sherlock looked helplessly at Greg who winked kindly at him and zipped his lips making Sherlock feel better.
“Was it that bad?”
“Okay, one drink, and then I’ll really have to go.”
Sherlock pulled back up slowly, cleaning the shaft as he went.  When he popped off the top he looked down at John with a satisfied look on his face.  John had collapsed back against the bed; body limp, eyes closed, mouth posed in a sated, dopey grin.  All-in-all, Sherlock decided John looked absolutely gorgeous in his post orgasmic haze and he couldn’t wait to get him in that state again.
The excitement and secrecy of it all meant that it didn't take either boy long to reach the edge.  Sherlock was the first to spill and he drew a drop of blood on his lip as he bit so hard as he climaxed.  John quickly followed as he tried to capture everything in the tissue he had ready to avoid a mess.  He ended up with his whole fist in his mouth, a single knuckle not being sufficient to cover the noise.
“Thank you, smart arse.  I think you know what I mean.”
"Hmm, I am starting to see the merit of your idea."
“Yes.  It just sprang into my head when I heard that music.  I couldn’t help myself.”
"So, you wouldn't be averse to me being in you, either?"
“That’s a great idea, John.  Let’s do that now before the bell goes for lunch.”
He didn’t know how long he just stood there watching in awe, but he didn’t move until one of the doors back down the corridor opened and the students within all piled out, laughing and joking.  He quickly stepped into the doorway opposite, pressing himself back against the door to remain hidden.  When they had gone he moved back to watch the violinist again, trying to pluck up the courage to push open the door and say hello.  As John neared the window panel, though, he saw him packing away the violin and preparing to leave.  He panicked.  He hadn’t managed to psych himself up enough to speak to him yet so he scarpered down the corridor, quickly leaving the building.
“Sorry, sorry.  I should have warned you to be careful, are you okay?”
“They said about the guy in the lab?”
20th January
“Oh, of course.  Daddy has the run of the company ski lodge.  It has a couple of cabins joined on to a main building so we tend to have big parties in the evenings.”  Jasmine looked up and saw Julian listening in to their conversation.  “We always have great fun, don’t we, Julian.”
“I hope so, I really do.  I will be monitoring the situation carefully as well as liaising with the people I’ve sent in to Budapest so hopefully we should have more information all round by the time you return.”
“What happened?”
Looking forward to seeing you – if you’re up for that, of course.
Sherlock looked up at him proudly and just a little bit smug.  He’d been worried that he wouldn’t know what to do but it seemed he couldn’t go wrong by trusting his instincts.  He went back to his tasting, licking one broad stripe from base to tip and enjoying the sound of John’s groan as he did so.  He licked around John’s balls and sucked one into his mouth, pulling on it lightly and pressing it against his tongue.  John definitely liked that if the hand griping his hair was any indication so he did the same on the other side too.
"Spoilsport," Sherlock pouted, "but okay; I suppose you have a point."
“I can’t agree to arbitrary things like that.  Cooking was quite fun, though – it’s all chemistry, of course.”
John had taken the final dressing off Sherlock’s leg that morning and checked the fractured ribs and broken fingers and declared them match fit.  Sherlock had also gained a satisfying amount of weight – nothing to put him over his own limits – but certainly enough to please John’s doctoring instincts of what was or wasn’t healthy.  All in all, he had decided that Sherlock had made enough progress that today was the day.
His brother had also texted him, accepting for once that there was no way that Sherlock would answer a call, to tell him that all would be well and to trust in his nature in knowing what to do.  Sherlock had merely snorted and ignored him.  He’d be telling him to trust in fairies and pixie dust next.  He did follow the other piece of advice that Mycroft had given him, however, and had a few packets of blood ready by the bed for when (not if – he wasn’t acknowledging ‘if’) John woke up.  Sherlock had never turned anyone himself but he knew that Mycroft had – that assistant of his being a prime example – so he was prepared to listen to him if it meant making things easier for  John.
"Did I mean what?"
Sherlock had laid some pillows and a blanket out in front of the fire which John hadn’t even noticed yet.  He leaned back and kissed John on the nose and smiled at him.  He handed him the cup of tea, which he knew was always a priority with John, and when John finished it in one go, it proved to him how desperate John had been.
“When was this?”
“Grab yourself a seat, Mr Holmes.  You’re in luck.  I decided to treat myself to a bottle of Talisker 25 and I would be very happy to share.”
John looked surprised, not knowing what she was trying to say.
Sherlock instantly took him up on it and pulled John towards him, laying his own trail along John’s neck.  He placed his own mark higher on John’s skin, not giving him any chance to hide it away with his collar.  He smirked, liking the feeling of knowing that everyone would see that John was his.
“You arse!  John groaned but got out his mobile and dialled all the same.
“Ok, thanks, sir.”
“Who’s gonna make us?”
“Well that rules out a theft from the Nurse’s Office then.”
“You’re welcome, brother mine.  My men are just approaching from the opposite direction to the Detective Inspector and will probably arrive together so look like you’re working on John until they can get him in to the ambulance and away.  Good luck, Sherlock.”
John’s eyebrows rose suggestively and he gave Sherlock a big, evil grin.  “Good.  Now arms up.”
“Yeah, will do, Doc.  Are you sure you want to do this, though, he made it seem like you weren’t supposed to be involved?”
They had been friends since the day they met.  Sherlock was six and John was nine and he’d arrived upon a scene in a nearby park where Sherlock was getting pushed around by three bigger boys.  Sherlock hadn’t seemed worried and, even at that age, he had been verbally eviscerating the bullies.  Unfortunately, all the taunts just made them want to hit him even more.  John boldly stepped in front of Sherlock and pushed the ring leader back.
“Thanks.”
Sherlock snorted then winced as it hurt his nose.  He peered up at John through the tiniest space in his eyelids.
“I’m happy with everything we have Sherlock and certainly wouldn’t do anything to risk that and I don’t feel that we are lacking anything.  But I have to admit that was also amazing and an occasional treat like that would be nothing but a bonus to our love.”  He reached over and touched Sherlock’s cheek, smiling at the look in Sherlock’s eyes.
“John, John, wait.  I’ll come if you do that.”
“You’ve never been at a disadvantage in your life.  Was it all some big joke?  See how long we can string out the stupid doctor and make him weep?”
Making The Best Of It
“Are you okay, Sherlock?”
“Someone’s stolen my buttons.  We should call the police.”
Sherlock and John took off after the van which had slowed down at the gates as the man tried to manoeuvre round the extra police cars which had pulled up after the van had driven in.  Sherlock jumped up into the back and extended his hand down to John and easily pulled him up beside him.  The driver turned round and saw them in the back.  He swerved hard to the right, trying to dislodge them.  Sherlock kept his balance but John banged against the side, knocking his head and stunning himself slightly.  Sherlock grabbed his arm to steady him and John shook his head to try to clear it.
"As our official business is concluded for the evening, shall we partake of some refreshments before I take you back out on to the dance floor, Gregory?"
“It is, indeed.”
“Do you want some back-up with whatever you’re planning?  There’s a few of us who’d be only too happy to help.  Sherlock, and you, have looked out for us enough times.”
"I..."
They went into the changing rooms and Sherlock found them a pair of trunks each and got out some fluffy towels.  They quickly got changed and were back by the side of the pool.  Sherlock did a stylish swan dive into the water and surfaced halfway across the width.
“Well, your articulation doesn’t seem to have improved with the morning.”
“I know, isn’t it brilliant.”
“If you look over there as we go round the bend and past those trees you should get your first sight of the house.”
“Umm,” John concentrated hard; trying to think, then he winced at the sensation of screwing his face up and concentrated a little less hard, as he once more tried to remember.
“Just because one hasn’t physically performed a task, doesn’t mean that one cannot understand the principles behind it and be able to successfully put those procedures into practise.”
“Your generosity overwhelms me.”
You’ll Surrender Your Heart
“I know, and nor would I knowingly risk your life in any way.”
“Well, we probably shouldn’t charge in to strenuous activities until your injuries have healed.”
“John!  John, you’re back.  You made it.  I knew you would; I knew you wouldn’t die on me.”
John’s head lolled to the right and he groaned as he was struck once more on the cheek.  That one had cut the inside skin against the side of his teeth and, as his head rolled back to the front, he spat the collected blood on the floor in front of him.  His head hung loosely forward, no longer having the strength to hold it up on his own.  His captor grabbed him by the hair and pulled his head up to look at his face.  His left eye was swollen shut and his face was already a mass of darkening bruises from the number of blows he had received.  His lip was split in two places and his head was ringing from when it had banged back against the floor when they hit him so hard his chair had toppled over backwards.
John had returned back to England after his first stage of recovery in the base hospital as the doctors had deemed that, with his injury, he would be unable to perform the delicate surgeries necessary on a military base.  Thus, he had been invalided out of the service and wound up where he found himself now, in a lonely, little bedsit in a block of army accommodation, pondering his future and staring at the invitation in his hand.
"No, John.  You've had four pints in under four minutes.  That's enough for now.  You need to get used to your limits.  You'll need more to start with but eventually you should be able to wean yourself down to just occasional bags like I do.
“We have much time to make up.  I propose we go back to the villa immediately and experiment properly.”
Anthea nodded and left, closing the door firmly behind her.
"Oops, sorry about that.  This is going to take a little getting used to."
“That was… amazing.  How did you do that thing…?  How did you even know what to do?  You said you hadn’t done anything before.”
“John, it’s okay.”
“I’ve tried him for the last three days on that other one but didn’t hear anything back so that’s when I tried the number he’d given me for emergencies.  So, do you think he’s in trouble then?”
“It’s fine, I’m fine.  Just a surprise that’s all.  Something I’d better get used to I suppose.”
“Fine, ok, right, yes.  Well, I don’t know if you’ve noticed…”
"He might as well stay until the boys go back and then they can travel together, if that would suit you?"
Sherlock retracted his fangs and licked over the marks he had made, closing them up quickly before pulling away and allowing John to sit up.
“If you find yourself in London then you should drop in at 221B Baker Street – I’m sure John would be delighted to meet a fan of his blog.”
He had planned to get everything organised; a job, a place to live in London and a successful army career behind him and then present himself to his best friend as someone worthy of consideration.  He’d show Mycroft Holmes that he was actually worth something; that Sherlock wouldn’t be throwing his life away on him.
“Yes, it is quite obvious that here is a person who is quite simply brilliant in every facet of his life; despite being clearly undervalued by his so-called family.  He manages to rise above that and share his talents with people who appreciate those gifts and see him for the genius he is.  As far as I can see, he has the wherewithal to spend his time in more esoteric pursuits with people of his own calibre, instead of having to waste his time on ignorant, dull-witted clots such as yourselves.  People who think that just because they’re going to inherit Daddy’s money, they have the right to bully anyone they see fit, just because that person doesn't fit into the right mould."
“As always, you see but you do not observe.  Lestrade has always poorly concealed an interest in me and since you arrived on the scene you have also been on his radar.  He has never acted on it; first because he was married, then he had the hassle of his divorce proceedings and then because you and I got together.  Believe me he won’t say no to an offer of having us both.”
"Well no, I don't actually.  I know you deduced I was bi but it was only a snatched kiss behind the gym, so this part is as new to me as it is to you; yours is the first cock I've ever touched aside from my own, of course."
Sherlock knocked his knee against John, excited that his plan was going well so far.  John grinned at him and, soon after, they left to head back to school, leaving his mum and sister to have a wander round the town before they came back later for the show.
John closed and locked the door and when he turned round he found himself encased in the circle of Sherlock’s arms and pinned to the door.  Sherlock leaned forward and captured John’s lips, enjoying the chance to take his time for a change.  He kissed down John’s neck, knowing that spot just behind John’s ear that made his knees go weak.  John moaned as he felt that touch and Sherlock quickly put his hand up to cover John’s mouth to keep him quiet.  John sucked the fingers into his mouth and laved them with his tongue, making Sherlock’s eyes roll back as he felt the hot warmth of John’s mouth.  He moved his lips back up to John’s, wanting to taste that warmth for himself.
John woke first to sunlight pouring into the room. He felt incredibly well rested for the first time in a long time. He felt Sherlock’s back pressed tightly against his, the violinist’s fingers resting lightly on his thigh almost as if he was checking to make sure he was still there. The doctor smiled. He realized they made it through the whole night without a bad dream between them. At least not one that woke anyone screaming. He stretched and reached to check his phone that was on the night table.
The man turned his head and pulled off his helmet, offering a well known crooked smile to the DI. "It's practically my job, Greg."
I am still alive. Despite all of my best intentions, my schedule is rarely consistent. I live in the consistently inconsistent. I thank you for your patience as I do my best to keep up.
A little case fic and then we will get back to the fluff. :-)
Sherlock ordered wine for them both and the waiter bowed and walked away.
“Sherlock! What are you doing here? I didn’t think I’d see you today. New experiment?” Molly asked.
John reached out to open the fridge to get the milk and paused. “Sherlock. I don’t know how long you were back in the flat before you told me you were alive. You didn’t restock on body parts did you?”
I swear this fic isn't abandoned, I'm just slow. Thanks for sticking with me!
“John.”
“I’ll get the waiter then and have the rest of the meal wrapped.” John started to stand.
Sherlock didn’t need to be told twice. They managed to move to the couch and spent the evening in, snogging like teenagers.
Thank you for the kudos and comments!
And we come to what happened with Moran.
“Sleep now, love. You must need some sleep after everything.”
“JOHN!!!! NO!! PLEASE!!!!”
Sherlock woke first the next morning as the sun started to stream through the windows in the sitting room. After blinking the sleep from his eyes, he looked down and saw his army doctor curled up on his chest. They must have shifted to lay down at some point during the night as the last he remembered they were sitting up. Sherlock smiled down at the grey/blonde head on his chest. He ever so gently pulled John closer to him with the arm still wrapped around him. Sherlock cringed a little when John stirred. He hadn't meant to wake him, he was just so happy to have John with him he couldn't help himself but to try to hug him closer.
Sherlock’s POV
“Please, John! I knew if there was any way Sherlock was alive, it would be you who had to bring him back. I’m not stupid. That fellow that would stay over sometimes who looked a lot like you, Mycroft popping round as often as he did. Give me some credit!”
“I didn’t suppose you were just going to take my word he had been taken care of without actually having to hear the whole story.” John chuckled darkly. Sherlock shook his head.
When they pulled up to the crime scene, Sherlock had to admit, it was a fascinating case. The whole family, sitting in what he presumed would be their usual seats, an elaborate meal in front of them. As Sherlock flitted around the table, John spoke with Lestrade. "Do we know the cause of death?"
Great. Meet you after work. Say 6? –JW
John stifled a giggle. Sherlock stood and offered Mrs. Hudson a kiss on the cheek. "No, Mrs. Hudson. Nothing we can't sort out later."
John was in shock for a moment. Was Sherlock actually suggesting they sleep together every night? Waking up this morning was lovely. Though it could cause issues down the line, given John’s feelings for Sherlock. Could he honestly be this greedy to take advantage of his friend’s needs for his own needs of being close to Sherlock? Apparently he had been quiet too long as Sherlock started speaking again.
"Sherlock, as much as I love kissing you, good God do I love it. We do actually need to figure out where we go from here."
“Sherlock, how do you feel about him?” Molly asked directly.
"I agree. In that regard, I saw last night that you had some hesitation, some doubt in your eyes." Sherlock didn't need to ask why, John knew what he was getting at.
Sherlock and John finally get back to the conversation they were having more they were so rudely interrupted.
John wasn’t the only resident at Baker Street finding it difficult to sleep. Sherlock was laying awake in his bed as well. He was going to get up and play his violin when he heard John come down the stairs and go to the kitchen. He heard the kettle boil and knew that John couldn’t sleep and therefore, he would be in the sitting room. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue for Sherlock, but he couldn’t handle confronting his friend like this. He felt raw, vulnerable, exposed, and he didn’t like it one bit. He has had strong feelings for John since that first night they met but he had always assumed John would tire of him as most did and be gone. He ignored the feelings he had building up, he reasoned if he didn’t allow them to be felt, then it wouldn’t hurt as much when John left. But then John did something extraordinary. He stayed. Sherlock knew that John was definitely “not gay” and would never consider these types of feelings for him. And he came to accept this as the way this would play out. Sherlock had decided that he would be happy with whatever type of relationship John would give him and if that was friendship only, than Sherlock would treasure it. But contrary to popular opinion, he was only human. Last night proved that with his desire almost too much to handle even with a strong control over his body.
He broke the kiss as his mind started whirling. He looked into John’s eyes, feeling vulnerable as he started to doubt himself again. John could see Sherlock’s face fall and he was alarmed.
"After everything that happened, I was calling round to see if you were in need of a pint but seems like you are handling everything just fine.” He gestured to John and Sherlock who were still in each other’s arms.
As if nothing had changed, Sherlock got the plates and started the kettle while John got the takeaway at the door. John laid out box after box of chinese food, having ordered all their favorites. They quickly filled their plates and sat at the table. They shared a smile, this felt right. Another of a thousand moments they took for granted for so long. Another moment they never thought they would have again.
It was easy enough to hack into the cameras that Mycroft Holmes had hidden in 221B Baker Street. Honestly, the British government should consider some type of security. She had a strong suspicion when John left the night Sherlock came back, he would find his way to Baker Street. She wasn’t surprised the next morning when she saw him on the CCTV cameras standing outside the door. The audio was crap inside the flat but she was able to read the body language, John and Sherlock were definitely more than just friends and flatmates, even if neither had admitted it yet. It would only be a matter of time before Mary was dismissed and those two got HER happy ever after story. By the time they had fallen asleep leaning on each other watching the Telly, she had a plan in mind to eliminate Sherlock for good this time.
"Jesus, Watson! Where have you been? I haven't seen you in months. I was worried Mycroft might have done you in."
Two years after faking his death to save those who mattered most to him, Sherlock Holmes stood in his brother’s office completely in denial of what was being said to him.
With barely a nod, Sherlock turned, and walked out into the streets of London.
“John, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t read Mary to know who she really was. You deserve someone who loves you and can cherish you. I’m indescribably sorry that I lied to you about being dead. If I could have told you and kept you safe, I would have. I knew when I left, you may hate me forever and never forgive me. John, I’ve never been one for emotions but as much as that hurt to know that I may have had to come back to a life where you hated me, I took comfort in knowing that you would be safe. It is not a life I want, but if that was what the result was, then so be it. I don’t want to cause you anymore pain, John. Please tell me what you need from me and I will make it so. If you need me to walk out of this flat and never come back for you to find happiness, consider me gone. I can’t bear causing you moments pain.”
When they got into the flat, Sherlock was practically vibrating with anticipation. He walked directly to his chair and sat, indicating to John he should do the same.  He needed to know what John was feeling and he needed to know NOW. He knew what he saw, but he needed to hear John say it. More importantly, he needed to know what was making John feel doubtful.
They arrived back at Baker Street later that morning and John went back to resume making the coffee that had been abandoned earlier. Sherlock strode over to his violin and started playing. John placed their coffees down and just listened to Sherlock play. The tune started out light and playful but slowly turned into a deeper melody sounding serious and almost sad. As John closed his eyes and was lost in the music, it abruptly stopped.
Sherlock’s face turned ashen when he saw John’s new scar. He reached out and gingerly touched the spot on his arm, he couldn’t stop himself. Tears began to well in his eyes as he looked back up at John’s face.
“Jesus Christ!” He exclaimed when he saw the time.
“Go get your own kidney if you need it that badly, I’ll get the rest. Bye, Sherlock.”
John blushed. "Sherlock, I love you. I just want to do this right. I want to make sure we want the same thing."
John took a deep breath. “Of course,” he said softly. He was running through his head trying to figure out what he had done that would have upset Sherlock so much. ‘Oh God, has he figured out I’m in love with him?’ John’s stomach dropped but he waited for Sherlock to speak.
Sherlock blushed slightly before giving John a genuine smile that seem to be reserved only for him. “Thank you, John. I will play it again, I’m sure.”
“Sherlock, did I do something wrong?”
“It has been quite a day. But, John, I do love you very much. We all do, just no one else more than me. At least I hope not.” Sherlock chuckled.
"I was overwhelmed with relief at seeing you, Sherlock. Mycroft told me you were alive but didn't say anything else. Just sent me off to the crime scene. I didn't know what condition you would be in. Alive is just breathing. You could have been missing a limb or something. I knew you would be tortured in Serbia, I just didn't know how. The relief on seeing you standing there as if you had never been gone was, quite frankly, shocking. And, of course, I've been protecting you from Moriarty's men for so long, I was afraid that someone may still be watching. I didn't know what reaction would set them off." John dropped his head and rubbed his hands over his face. "I know they are gone, but it's been years. Years, Sherlock, of making sure you would come back home, back to me. It's hard to believe that it's finally over."
John instinctively grabbed Sherlock's arm back. "I'm glad we can finally put that bastard Moriarty behind us. He's been hanging over our heads for far too long. We won though, in the end. We're back at Baker Street, where we belong. We can pick up life where we left off without having to worry that the next shoe is about to drop."
“Oh, Mary, how dull. You thought this all through with your heart and not your head, which is why you will be caught. You are supposed to be a bloody clever assassin.  First of all, my brother pulls this act of whisking someone away to Intimidate other people, not to me. Honestly, think it through. Why would Mycroft need to pull some intimidation tactic with his own brother? He hasn’t intimidated me since I’ve been out of nappies.  Secondly, Anthea having a bit of time off? You honestly think Mycroft gives that poor woman a holiday? And to that end, whoever your accomplice’s are need some serious guidance on how to perform a kidnapping. They left me with my mobile and didn’t even sit in the back with me to make sure I couldn’t use it. These are all beginner’s mistakes, Mary.”
Now that Sherlock was looking less peaky, John cleared his throat and looked at his friend with an odd intensity in his eyes. "Sherlock, did Mycroft tell you anything about why I was asked to work for MI6?"
"Oh, yes. It was his secretary. She was sleeping with him to get her boyfriend a promotion but he got passed over again. She drugged his coffee and brought him out here to kill him. You'll find the murder weapon in the back of the victim's car." Sherlock spoke quickly, clearly directed at the DI but eyes locked on John the whole time.
Around 7am Sherlock gave up hiding in his room. He needed a cup of coffee. For a man who rarely needed sleep, he was exhausted from being up most of the night thinking of John. When he walked into the kitchen, he could see John sitting in his chair. “Morning, John.” He said. When there was no response, Sherlock went to the front of the chair and found that John had fallen asleep sitting in his chair. He crouched down and took this opportunity to study his face. His blonde/grey hair was longer than he normally wore it, he had been forgetting to go to a barber. Sherlock loved the way the slightly longer wisps brushed against John’s forehead, making him look years younger; not that John was terribly old but between the grey in his hair and the worry around his eyes when he was awake made him seem much older. In his slumber, all his stresses had worn away. Sherlock smirked when he reached John’s full lips. How he wanted to wake him by just leaning forward and kissing him awake and then take him to bed properly. Suddenly, John jerked awake and pushed his arms out, hitting Sherlock who in turn stumbled back bouncing his back off his own chair before hitting the floor.
“Oh boys!! I’m so happy to have you both back home where you belong. I knew you’d bring him home, John.”
Sherlock mulled over John’s offer. The tension between them still lingered and they had done nothing to talk about it. He wondered if they ever would. It could mean trouble but Sherlock was never one to shy away from taking a risk, well unless it involved potentially losing John again. This was a very calculated risk as least. John suggested it so Sherlock can hardly be blamed if there were any ill feelings as a result. “I think that’s a valid solution. I wouldn’t be able to ignore you anyway. I propose my room as I have a larger bed. Two of us squeezing into your hobbit sized bed seems like it would be uncomfortable.”
“Sure. Where too? Angelo’s?”
“I knew a happy announcement would be coming. I use assumed it would be sooner than this.  I do hope there is cake?” Mycroft surprised them all by appearing suddenly in the doorway.
Sherlock hesitated a moment before starting to speak. “John, I have no idea what to say right now. I think this is first. So I’m just going to say it and hope that if you don’t agree, I can teach you how to delete a memory.” Sherlock bit his bottom lip and looked at John with wide eyes. “John, I’m rubbish at emotions and sentiment but I can’t keep ignoring what I am feeling. From the moment we met, I knew there was something different about you. You accepted me for who I am, even though I know I can be difficult. You are my conductor of light, when I'm lost, I know you will lead me home. John, you've made me reconsider my opinion about love being a chemical defect. So I guess I might as well just put it out there. John Watson, I love you.”
Sherlock looked briefly hurt before training his face to the blank mask he usually wore. “Ok, John. You can just ignore me and I will endeavor to not run to your side but I can’t promise.”
John reached into the back of the closet and his hand made contact with what he was looking for. It was a grey pinstripe suit that he hadn’t needed in years but always kept on hand just in case. He didn’t think his frumpy brown suit was going to fit the bill tonight. He went to the bathroom to take a quick shower praying the suit still fit.
Sherlock was not able to speak but nodded. He didn’t trust his voice not to break. He never meant for John to get hurt again. He was trying his best to make sure that John was safe. He knew that the army captain was right, a few more scars and they are finally as safe as they can be in the life they lead. The guilt weighed heavily on him regardless. He leaned back in his chair, took a large gulp of wine, and switched his focus to the fire. He just couldn’t look at his best friend right now. He was overcome with the emotions rolling over him and he didn’t know where to begin. The detective retreated into his mind palace to try to organize all the information that he had just taken in.
Your happiness matters to me, brother dear. –MH
John gave him a look with slight confusion but didn’t push it. The lack of follow up texts from Mycroft indicated that it wasn’t a “matter of national security” so he let it go. John didn’t get involved in the relationship between the Holmes brothers unless it was getting too heated. He couldn’t imagine them coming to blows but Sherlock definitely had the advantage in that case. John smiled and chuckled at the thought of Mycroft fending Sherlock’s blows with his umbrella.
Why does this matter to you? –SH
"Nah, he couldn't take me anyway. Been helping the British Government actually with a few things." John winked at Greg but offered no further information.
They both chuckled.
“Git. Never do that to a soldier, you’re lucky I wasn’t in my room. I’d have likely shot you. Shoot first, ask questions later.” John exclaimed as he reached a hand down to help Sherlock onto his feet. Both John and Sherlock felt electricity between their hands as they touched. When Sherlock was on his feet, neither man dropped the other’s hand nor could they find words to say; they both just stared at each other seemingly lost in the moment. The moment broken by the ping of Sherlock’s phone. Sherlock broke away first and grabbed the phone from his dressing gown pocket, desperate to look anywhere but at John. John coming to himself, shook his head, and went to the kitchen declaring the need to make coffee.
John looked puzzled for a moment and then a bright, mischevious smile took over his face and he sat back down. “Sherlock Holmes, the world’s only consulting detective, is willing to forgo a crime scene to have dinner with me? I couldn’t think of any other place I would want to be.”
“John, are you ok?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, Molly Hooper. As always, I knew I could count on you.” Sherlock leaned down and placed a kiss on her cheek.
Mary has a plan to get Sherlock out of the way and have John to herself but unfortunately for her, sentiment gets in the way.
As soon as they were in a cab, Sherlock grabbed John and kissed him deeply. He ignored the cabbie pounding on the ceiling to get them to stop. "That was absolutely brilliant, John! You solved that case in record time and before the Yard even knew what was happening." Sherlock kissed him again.
“Sherlock, what did I tell you about deducing me?”
Sherlock faced his closet, he knew he needed something that would peak John’s interest. He cursed the kidnapper who forced him into the Thames. His purple shirt that always seemed to make John’s eyes linger was likely destroyed. After flipping through the shirts, he settled on a smoky grey color with a black suit. The shirt brought out the grey flecks in his eyes he had been told. He hoped it appealed to his Dr. Watson.
“I’m not opposed to you being in a relationship, John. You haven’t found the right person yet.”
“I don’t suppose you are going to tell me what happened when you got to Moran?”
I'm not great at coming up with cases so I tapped into my love of Criminal Minds. I don't remember if I saw this case specifically or something similar or if I just put a whole bunch of random clips of episodes together.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He broke their kiss, “May I?” he indicated John’s shirt. John grinned, “If that’s what you want, love.” Sherlock pulled John up to a sitting position and pulled his jumper over his head and removed the button up shirt that was underneath. He leaned John back on to the bed. This was the first time Sherlock had ever seen John without a shirt. Sherlock looked down at him, taking in the view of John’s chest and stomach. He was more muscular than Sherlock had imagined. While he wasn’t as fit as he had been in the army, he certainly wasn’t slacking at all. Sherlock traced his fingers down the center of John’s chest and then leaned forward and starting peppering John with kisses down his jaw, his neck, and then eventually stopped at John’s shoulder. He saw the scar from the bullet John took in the war. It looked like a starburst. He tentatively touched it with his fingers and felt John tense beneath him. He knew John was self-conscious about the scar. Sherlock gently kissed the scar. “You’re amazing,” Sherlock murmured, “So strong.” He spent a few more moments tracing the lines of John’s scar with kisses before moving on and exploring the rest of John’s chest and torso. He could feel John relax. As he reached John’s trousers, he knew he needed to see and explore all of him. He wanted to taste, touch, feel every inch of John. Sherlock wanted to know what he liked and how to please him. He looked up at John, his eyes dark with lust, and gently tugged at his belt.
"John. I don't know how to begin. I don't know what Mycroft told you, as you didn't seem that shocked to find I was alive. I'm so sorry."
“As long as you are sure. You had me worried for a minute. I thought something that upset you. Well, beyond your stomach.”
Their foreheads pressed together, both panting, their lips swollen. John gazed into Sherlock’s eyes.
After returning his gun to it’s proper place in his nightstand drawer, John joined Sherlock downstairs where he had already turned the kettle on for tea. As promised, John made them a cup of tea and managed to find a rerun of Monty Python and the Holy Grail playing. As they mindlessly watched King Arthur’s crusade, they began to doze off again, leaning against each other on the couch.
*******************************
John felt very confused. Did Sherlock realize that Clos Maggiore was known to be one of the most romantic restaurants in London? Sherlock doesn’t usually know things like that. Maybe he just had a hankering for French food. Surely, that must be it. John cursed at himself; why hadn’t he been listening to Sherlock? ‘Bloody hell! He’s figured it out hasn’t he?’ John fretted to himself while he went up to his room to find something appropriate to wear.
You may be pleasantly surprised. –MH
John’s breath caught in his throat. He cheeks flushed slightly. He had imagined this moment with Sherlock a million times but never really thought it could happen. Sherlock didn’t feel things that way. At least until this very moment, John hadn’t thought that he did. The evidence was right in front of him: Sherlock's pupils blow wide open, a slight flush working it's way up his cheeks, a look of longing and lust painted on the detective's face.
“Oh, hello, Mycroft. I see you are bugging the flat again. Care for a cuppa?”
Sherlock gestured with an arm towards their chairs as an invitation to sit. Not that he wanted to rush the warm feelings in the flat but he knew it needed to happen. He had hope for the first time since he came back that things might work out and John might come home. For that to happen, they needed to get this over with. John turned to hang his coat on the hook by the door and Sherlock poured their tea and brought over the plate of biscuits to sit on the table by their chairs. As they sat down and got settled for what would surely be a difficult conversation, John couldn’t help but feeling like this felt right. He was still angry and hurt but at the same time, the hug, the doting by Mrs. Hudson, sitting across from Sherlock in their chairs as they had done so very many times before, it filled his heart with a sense of peace that he had been missing. Like he had finally come home after a war he didn’t know he was fighting.
“What does Mycroft want now? Doesn’t he know I’m busy?” Sherlock tried to sound annoyed.
“I hope you’ll play it again and finish it. It’s truly beautiful.”
John put his hand over Sherlock’s on his shoulder. “Don’t, Sherlock. This was nothing. The scar tissue from the old wound prevented this one from being any worse. We survived this whole ordeal with just a few more scars but we survived to come back to each other. That’s all that matters. Moriarty and Moran are gone for good. They can’t try to come between us anymore.”
John sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. How had his life come to this again? He seemed to be standing on the cusp of something and it was time once again to decide where he would go. Would he stay with Mary and forget all about his life of adventure with Sherlock? Or would he be once more pulled by the thrill of the chase and leave the life in suburbia before he even got there? He thought of Mary. Sweet, funny, kind Mary. She had brightened up his life  when he was caught in the depression of wishing Sherlock was alive but coming to terms with the fact he did actually die on the concrete in front of Bart’s. With Mary, he was starting to think of settling down, starting a family,maybe start up his own practice. To do the things that proper men do when they reach his age.It’s the life that Mary dreamed of and deserved.  Certainly chasing serial killers and thieves through the streets of London was not what a respectable retired army Doctor did.
“I told him,” he stepped back to sit upon his bed, his eyes haunted. “My father. I was… he knew, of course he did, but he needed proof. And I had it. And so he… he threatened to remove me from the will. To throw me from the house. I thought, surely, Charles would be disowned, but I could feed him money and he could live with Freddy as he wished to. I thought that perhaps it was for the best that Father knew…”
I had not given up my crusade to feed Holmes whenever humanly possible, so I pulled him from his work to eat. He still held that stoic silence, although I was beginning to believe that it was something more than that keeping him who was so ready to speak, quiet.
“Percival Malcolm. I was-“ something complicated cut across his fair features. “I must apologize, my good sir, for my actions last night. I hadn’t intended to throw you into the river, it just-“
I had made it clear to Holmes that, upon my death, I would be buried far away from London, lest I haunt him from beyond the grave like one of Dickens' specters.
“We’re alone,” I huffed. “For God’s sake, Sherlock, if you do not begin to take your own health into account, then I fear you will not return from one of your impossible cases.” It was a thought that often haunted me, a dream I had night after night. My Holmes, made into one of the pale and bloated bodies that we observed. He winced, not in pain but perhaps in pity or guilt.
“Dear God,” I replied, “you mean to say that it was his brother who did this?” Holmes shook his head minutely.
The cane swung clearly down upon Holmes’ head, crashed into his temple with a sickening crunch. Before I could move from my position, he was on the ground of the parlor, his crimson blood beginning to pool in the dip of his eye.
“What business would a man such as he have in Whitechapel?” I asked, knowing the answer.
Holmes’ stature always changed when we visited places such as this. I knew little of his familial history at this point in time, but I now know it to be a discomfort with the nature of his childhood and tension with his parents. His back was almost always twisted into a harsh slouch, a posture earned after years hunched over his reading for hours at a time. As we approached the house, his back straightened. He looked rather unnatural then, as though forced to embody a version of himself that no longer existed. I wished to carve the curve back into his spine.
“Inspector? Will I be punished for keeping Charles’ secret?”
“Then you will be glad to know,” said I, “that I would never allow such harm to befall you.” I said it as though I could guarantee this outcome, as though the world were not an incredibly cruel place for men such as us. Holmes smiled, a crooked, delicate thing.
“Dear God,” I closed my eyes and sunk myself further into the chair. It smelled of him, of his rose hips perfume, of tobacco and decay and warmth. “This could happen to any of us. To all of us.” I bit out a short laugh. “Do you think they’d keep our bodies together? Or would I be dumped upon the Tower and you at Scotland Yard?”
I came around a corner very fast, to find the young man standing still. He had finally turned down the wrong street and found himself stuck between myself and a tapered dock leading to the icy sea. I began to slow my pace, knowing that if I were to barrel into him, we would both tumble into the sea. He seemed shocked, and his green eyes were wide with fear.
I took in a deep breath, let it fill my lungs and replace that frustration with admiration and love for the man in front of me. I reached forward and captured his wayward tear along the pad of my thumb.
“Would that trouble you?” He looked at me with a certain amount of concern. I smiled warmly.
“Mr. Malcolm,” Holmes greeted, his voice pleasantly blank, “what an honor to meet you,” the flattery did not break Malcolm’s concentration. He stared intently at Holmes, as though trying to peer through him completely.
There came upon me a numb, quiet panic that rippled through my limbs. I did not answer him, merely turned on my heel and made my way back into the mansion. My feet were light and my revolver steady in my hand as I moved through the servant's entrances and towards the study that Holmes had disappeared into many minutes before.
“My brother, Charles.” His voice shook with fear and grief. “We were very close, you see, since we were children. I am only a year older than he, so it was only natural that we would confide in each other. I had known his love of men since we were very young. It was not until our adolescence that we discovered it’s strangeness. From that time, I had been sworn to secrecy, and I had kept that secret very well. When Charles and Freddy met, it was love, the kind of pure love that could not be a sin. I was the only one to know, the only one to meet him. I held the same brotherly love for Freddy as I did Charles, you see, and so I had to see them, I had to see what I had done.”
That evening, Holmes was not so gracious to my attempts to pamper. He poured over his work with barely a glance at the food and drink I brought. He smoked his pipe, read from tomes about parliament.
The cut across Holmes’ head, however, did not come for nothing. By positing a question to his capacity, the defense made him vulnerable to political attack. If it wasn’t bad enough that his son was a bugger, he himself was a fool. There passed barely a month before he was forced to resign his seat in Parliament.
Eventually practise finished and the boys all charged off back to the changing rooms to have a shower and head back to their halls to do homework and spend the rest of their evening in the common room.  Sherlock made his way closer and waited in a place where he could see everyone as they left.  When he thought they were all out he sneaked up to the entrance and made his way in.  At the last minute he heard someone shouting cheerio to John so he ducked behind the door before he could be seen and waiting for the other boy to leave before eventually heading through into the main changing area.
“Well, I shall observe your bruises for you then, and I can make notes without you having to worry about them.”
"I know that.  I was just thinking about... about the chance of being... in you.  If what we just did was even a small part of it, then I can't wait to try the real thing."
“He does have somewhat of a temper so I’m sure the first meeting will be a little volatile, but I’m hoping we can quickly overcome that aspect and move past it.”
Greg’s dad drove them back from the station and was obviously impressed with what he’d seen.
John heard the door go downstairs.  He took no notice, though; Mrs Hudson always dealt with that.  He had almost forgotten that he’d heard the doorbell - drifting back off into his own thoughts again – when there was a short knock on the door to his flat and it was pushed open.  It was obviously someone who knew him because if they stayed there to wait for him to answer it, they’d be waiting all day.  It was Mycroft – oh joy, his day was complete!
It didn't take Greg long to appear at 221B, both to take their statements and also to find out what the hell was going on.
“Of course, they would.  I’ll ring Mummy now and ask her and then you can ring your Mum, too.”
“I know what proper feelings are, John.”
“I guess.”
John beamed at him.  "Brilliant."
“We can certainly go and check.  Or maybe Mr Johnson would be a better person to ask.  He's more likely to have masking tape which is probably the best sort to use and we could also ask him about the wood we need to make the radio whilst we’re there."
"Yes, I said I would have to speak to you, as to whether you would want to be invaded, again, so soon after the last holiday."
They spent a relaxed hour and a half rehearsing before John, reluctantly, slid himself out from under Sherlock, and left him to get some sleep, while he went back to his own room to do the same.  He didn’t know when he’d been happier than he was now with Sherlock in his life.
My name is John Watson and I am a Lieutenant in the RAMC with the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.  I am 23 and I did my medical training at St Barts in London before joining the army so we may have trod some of the same earth.  I have been over here for eight months now and this is my first posting abroad so it has taken some getting used to.  The constant heat and sunshine were certainly somewhat of a shock after being used to England’s wet and grey weather.  I do at least have a healthy tan now and my hair is even more blonde with the bleaching from the sun.
When they arrived down on the beach John set up a blanket and parasol which they got from the small beach hut set back against the rock face.  When it was ready, he insisted that Sherlock lie down for a rest after such a long walk.  He was getting stronger every day but John didn’t want to cause a relapse after he had been recovering so well so he was very insistent.  After a bit of grumbling Sherlock settled down and did actually have a little nap which proved John’s assumptions correct much to Sherlock’s chagrin when he woke up again.
When John felt the renewed pressure of those lips around his shaft he knew he wouldn’t last much longer.  The hand surrounding him was providing strong and powerful strokes and as he pushed that head down one last time, he yelled out an instinctive name and had the most amazing orgasm of his life.  He shuddered as he continued to pulse out the after-shocks, enjoying the fact that Sherlock swallowed greedily, and then he collapsed back on to the bed, arms out to the side as he recovered his composure.
The mysterious boy had not been in any of the other rooms he’d passed so far.  There was only one left at the end so John crept nearer and peeked in.  Success!  There, facing out of the window, was the person he had been looking for.  He was playing the violin and, not only that, but he was playing it brilliantly.  He wasn’t reading the music, he obviously knew it by heart, and he was drawing such beautiful sounds from the instrument that John just stood in the shadow of the door, gaping.
"Shall we take this somewhere more comfortable?"
John blushed charmingly and started giggling.  The others all got up and paired off.  Most people were already sitting by their own friends so it wasn’t a problem finding a partner.  Anderson was the only one on his own for the first dance as there were an odd number of them, but on the next change Greg sat down and Sally took a spin round with Anderson, so he was quite happy to take turns.
“It wouldn’t kill you, John.  A vampire’s bite releases endorphins into your pleasure centres and can heighten sexual enjoyment a hundredfold.”
“Of course, I want you, John.  Why do you think I haven’t been with anyone else all this time?”
“Someone moving?”
They walked around back streets and alleys, Sherlock knowing exactly where they were at all times and showing John shortcuts he'd never noticed which would get him to places that he commonly visited in half the time.  As they strolled around Sherlock regaled John with interesting facts about their surroundings.  True, many of them were concerning crimes that had taken place in the vicinity, both in the long distant past and also more recently, but John found it all fascinating.
“You didn’t disturb me at all; I just said it was better.  Maybe you had the same feeling; you seemed to be quite comfortably asleep there.”
“You missed.”
”Really, John – beer and whisky?”
"Well, I think we'll need to get a proper electrician in to re-wire it; this cord has been spliced right through and it's not something we can fix ourselves.  I'll take it over to Mr Hobbs, the caretaker, and see if he can get it sorted for us."
“That was why I had to jump.  He’d ordered a hit on the three of you and, when he killed himself to make sure I couldn’t make him call it off, I had no other choice.”
“Are you kidding me – have you seen yourself?  I have been tempted by that tight, purple shirt since you walked out of the changing room door.  Those buttons have been screaming at me to pop them off.”
"Let me have a look.  Oh, that's not too bad at all; you'll soon be racing around the stage again."
“I have… thought of you, too, on occasion.”
John was just putting his guitar back in its case in readiness for leaving when he heard a scraping noise coming from the door.  He ducked behind the chimney, sure that he would get in trouble if the caretaker found him up here.  He heard footsteps walking across the roof towards the cushion which he hadn’t had time to hide before he’d dashed away.  He heard a deep baritone voice enunciate quite clearly.
“Sherlock was not prepared to allow any risks with regard to yourself and refused to reveal himself until he had removed the sniper targeting you.  It has proved a difficult task as he has not been able to do the searching in person, of course, as he is unable to reveal himself.  It seems that Moriarty sent his very best after you; his second in command – you should feel honoured.”
I’ve sent you a photo of me in return, well two actually, as you will have seen.  The first was taken back home, the week before I left (I’m the blond one in the middle with the moustache) and the other was taken last month when we had the weekend off duty and went to a watering hole which had been cleared and declared safe to use.  Do your worst and deduce what you can from those, I don’t think it will put me off so I think you’re safe.
“When I walked in and saw you sitting here all alone, I just thought to hell with it.  I didn’t want to be without you another moment and I don’t give a shit if he kicks me out.  That’s his issue, not mine.”
