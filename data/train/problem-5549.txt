The alpha sagged into the seat and scrubbed his hands over his face. “Yeah, no you’re right. Going slow slow is good. Slow is great actually, slow and steady wins the race right? Yeah…winning.”
The ginger snorts tersely and crosses his arms. “I’d not have to ask for that.”
He watched them from a distance, descending the steps all smiles and adoration. Barnes felt his mind shifting the image of the strong man in a black tuxedo to a thin kid in a secondhand sport coat and crooked tie.  The faded memory of big glistening blue eyes and kiss bitten lips.
Steve leaned against the car and waved, thankful when Barnes lifted the pup off the cat-like animal's back and set her down on the grass. Wendy broke out into a run nearly colliding with his legs in her excitement. Already rattling off about all the fun, she had as her Omega lifted her up to his hip.
“Whatever, I’m sexy…me and my fantastic chin are just gunna go back to sleep then.” Tony grumbled turning over and dramatically pulling the blanket over his head.
What little of his memory remains of their youth, he knows the younger man was never good at keeping the homes fire burning. Steve always wanted to be out in the thick of things. Always had and always will, even more so with all he has to protect these days. It wasn't as if James could blame him. If was standing in his friends shoes right now he doubted there would be anything that could hold him back. Maybe that's what made omegas so much stronger when you really thought about it. They were the ones that had to keep that brave face and hold down the fort while their fool alphas ran off into the wilderness and wars. Something had to be said for those left behind when the wolf was at the door. At the end of the day – when the front line fell – it was your last line of defense that needed to be the strongest.
Humble and Kind - Tim Mcgraw
In the mean time, the doctor had been pleased with Steve’s blood work and was hopeful that in six or so months when the second yearly heat rolled around that Steve would do fine on his own.
The alpha just nodded and smirked, “Then go the fuck to sleep and I won’t have to.”
“I..I’m just stayin here with you Bucky ain’t no body gunna see.”
Steve did as he was told and blushed as he felt the glide of lipstick on his mouth. This one was called Dubonnet - dark like blood and made his skin seem that much paler. When Bucky kissed him it smeared a little, but then that was part of it to because Bucky liked to leave him messy.
The Peter shape lamp quiverd slightly trying to sit up a bit straighter and keep still.
Just like that, she was breezing out of the workshop, the music volume raising and Tony just sat there listening. It felt like the universe was telling him what to do. Telling him what was right because he already knew it deep down.
Loki’s Pride makes him take the child. He does not want Thor to know how inept he was with Amora. “Has she named my son? Or shall I?” He asks simply, tossing the tattered yellow blanket away, some bit of sea trash Amora likely found among sunken wreckage. If she could play false mother than he could play doting father. At least then, he would have something to show for his troubles.
Loki went down the stairs to meet the mortal, his guise slipping on easily as always as he greeted with a condescending smile.
The only public tear Tony shed was at the graveside, during the 21-gun salute.  A single droplet reveling itself from under his dark frames.
“Tony…”
What was no secret, however, was Fury's open loathing for Loki.
The shower felt good, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and just held him under the spray for a long time. There was nothing particularly sexual about this. They just needed this closeness, it was reassuring and that’s what Tony really needed right now.
Captain America wasn’t pregnant. Steve Rogers was, some kid from Brooklyn that no one remembered.
Pretty much everyone in the tower realized this one right off. From the vent crawling to the "perching". That last one, Tony. Would later argue took years off his life.
Both men stopped and stared.
"Why did you do it...I thought you were ok, I thought we...were ok.." Steve shuffled through pictures trying to make sense of it all. Trying to look for some sign there in prints that would pin point the moment it all went wrong. Then again, maybe it had been wrong for so long that it meshed and melted with everyday. Every smile that did little to warm those brown eyes, every laugh that was a little forced. Looking back it all felt so different now. He questioned every conversation and tried to recall every single word they spoke in anger. "I should have seen it. You should have told me..." Then the darkness comes and he blames himself. "Would i have listened?"
“You have, we should have seen that a lot sooner. Nevertheless, I don't believe everything is fine, James doesn't think everything is fine but he doesn't want to push you. If can't tell him, maybe you can tell me.”
Entering a dark room wit floor to ceiling wood paneling and blazing amber colored lights. They stoop around what could have been a shrouded coffin. Stark took an edge of the red velvet and tugged it away.
“Damn it…” Tony cursed seeing the dark red stain on Steve’s left side. “How bad is it? Do you feel like you’re gonna pass out?” He asked concern coloring his voice now, the look of disappointment erased. This was no time to worry about how Steve may or may not feel about his old friend.
From the corner of his eye Loki caught a flash of red hair in Stark's office. Natasha was speaking in hurried tones over the communications link to the field team. His keen hearing picked up the alert from Coulson's team. Things where out of hand, more Hydra soldiers had arrived and Barton had joined the fray. More troublesome than that however, was that communications with Stark and James... were down.
Tony just glared and left the mansion. He did tell Peter before he left that he was angry at him just the situation.
“Steve!” Tony came barreling in the room “They said you were ok. God I was freaked out… You ought to know with your metabolism to eat when you get up in the morning, what if you had pulled that shit in the middle of a fight! Ya know how you’re always preaching to me about risks. Well…” Tony gestures wildly. It was somewhat cute to see him so worked up. “Risk Steve!” The alpha huffed out a few breathes before perching on the side of the bed and kissing his omegas forehead. “I’m serious…don’t do that, I have enough wrinkles these days sweetheart.”
Yep....time to go to bed.
The engineer had gotten pretty efficient at this, having babysat Wanda and Pietro when Clint was out on missions. Steve didn't put up nearly as much of a fuss, the blond was mostly still sucking his thumb through the whole ordeal. "Ok honey, your ready for your jammies."
Steve laughed and watched the kids make a run for their playroom. “That's just going to get worse the older they get ya know?”
They slowly made themselves out to be ‘the voice of the people’ when really they were gas lighting an entire country. ‘Trust me’ says the left hand of a right handed killer.
The heavy scent of the alpha doubled as the smaller man nearly growled in appreciation at the sight before him.
(you go Bruce. XD)
“I wouldn’t ask ya to Bruce, I’m just saying… mm…” Steve stopped to rub at a harsh kick under his rib cage. “Damn…”
Tony rolled his shoulders back as he feels a twinge in the center of his chest. It happened on occasion, his father told him it was because he was born small but that he was healthy. The young mer looked around noticing through the archways how the light above seemed to slowly grow dimmer. Was it that late already?
If only someone had told the alien prince that midgardian women don't really need nor want a dead bilgesnipe laid out on their doorstep.
AN: Ok so there is a lot of fake medical science, I did my best to try and make things sound plausible and did some research on different developmental conditions related to hormones as well as some research on reproductive health and certain conditions affected by the bodies chemistry. So hopefully it feels legit, if it doesn’t ..idk I gave it my best so don’t be dicks or armchair quarterbacks.
“I don’t wanna talk about it…I don’t wanna talk about anything…”
However, some knew better. The powers that be always had an odd habit of holding their tongues at the worst possible moments. Thy liked having their cards close and lurking in the shadows until the moment for maximum advantage showed its face. Then and only then would the knight advance the board and to the unknowing masses, somehow someone made it all better. As if the public was too stupid to handle the truth, even though the people lived that truth and then some every day.
Steve leaned forward and rested their foreheads together, and that just broke Tony’s heart being so close to this man. If this wasn’t Steve…if this was some kind of ploy to bring him in… there’s no way he could come back from this. From having these feeling so close and it just being a game.
Bruce thought back to simpler days, days before the gamma exposure, before villains and heroes. He wondered how different things would be and for not the first time Dr. Banner knew he wouldn't change a thing. Without that one choice he would have never been invited to join the Avenger initiative and would have never met Natasha or Pepper. His life would be resigned to a lab and his papers.
Steve shivered and looked at the clock, he didn’t have to be anywhere for hours. Part of him wondered though if Bucky would let him change out of everything. It wouldn’t be the first time he went to a meeting or charity event with a pair of nylons or lace underwear hidden beneath his clothing. Rogers still fretted over the possibility that one day he’d get a call to assemble and be injured on the field. The embarrassment of disrobing in the med bay and some nurse seeing him in a pair of satin panties.
Now I have to get through it. I just don't know if I'm strong eenough or I even deserve to be happy. I probably don't.
As it turned out, trying to find a comfortable position for Steve and his gravid 7-month belly, was easier said than done. The couple had been at this for quite a while and it seemed like just when any progress was happening things just grew uncomfortable for one or both of them.
Steve huffed and smiled against the alphas neck, “Only took what? 45 years?”
Loki didn't have to pretend to be the brother Thor remembered. The lie that made the alpha feel secure. He didn't have to constantly prove his intentions were not ill.
Anyone on Asgard would have criticized this technique, not seeing magic as a very masculine talent, but the agents of Shield moved aside in awe – if not a little bit of fear. Nonetheless, there was more to Loki's sudden aid – something dark that they could all feel. Something that could easily spin out of control and create an even larger problem than the one they were already facing.
“Cannons! They’re loading the cannons!” Someone shouted out the warning – hoping against hope one of his comrades could avoid the oncoming volley of iron and fire.
It wasn't easy for unbound omega, that's not to say it was impossible. There were plenty of single parent household in worlds and omegas that would tell you they could do just fine by themselves. That being said, considering how difficult things had been with the twins it made Tony worry. He didn't want Steve to do this alone or to feel so disconnected when he needed him the most.
In those by gone days, there was always a team of faithful servants skittering around to make the royal rooms run as smoothly as the rest of the palace halls. Smells of roasted meats wafting through the gilded corridors; the hushed conversation of Asgaurdian council members and well-to-do members of society. That last one was a memory Loki did not miss at all.
Widow shrugged, “Seemed like you would be an interested party who didn’t want to look like an interested party. Wouldn’t want to tarnish your street-cred of being a narcissistic bastard.”
It all happened so fast, one moment they were happy - just having a usual date night at Tony’s favorite Italian restaurant. They enjoyed the food, music and candle light. Just being able to unwind one night a week or at the very least one night a month, they always tried to save at least one night to be a ’normal’ couple. Trading off on who took out who, it was Tony’s night so of course that meant fine dining and taking a drive out to a secluded spot in one of the inventors expensive cars. They were just  leaving the restaurant, hand in hand  enjoying the city lights glow in the evening sky.
“Just thought it needed to be said.”
With the commotion and gunfire all around them, Coulson was surprised that he didn’t miss the subtle change in the atmosphere. An electric feeling that made the hairs on the back of your neck rise. Something he had felt only once before.
Their next date was that weekend, yet again Steve found a garment bag waiting for him when he returned home from the gym. This one held something a bit more casual -still too expensive when Steve noted the labels.  He humored the alpha got dressed in the slacks and sweater that was probably cashmere if the luxurious feel was anything to go by. When Steve opened his door to head to the elevator he spotted Tony waiting out side. The billionaire was leaning against the wall in a burgundy button up and matching shades. Steve had to take a moment to appreciate the view. He also noticed the long stem peach colored rose held in the inventor’s hand.
He had been bitten, stung, hit, squeezed, knocked out, and many other verbs that generally mean he fails at life and safety. Still, no one could say the mer was not tenacious. If anything could be said for Anthony Lokison, it was that he was going to do something great one day…or die horribly. It was really a toss up.
Loki scoffed and took another sip of his water. "Don't be foolish i do not perspire."
"Put you're back into pretty boy. I don't wanna walk right tomorrow."
Although, that’s what made Widow so deadly. Her stealth was unmatched. She could infiltrate a maximum-security base, download all of their Intel and sneak out before anyone even knew she was there. She could also distract one high-strung billionaire with sweets and caffeine to keep him from doing something stupid, all the while pretending like it was nothing more than lunch. Yeah, she was good.
It didn’t take much prompting for the twins to pull out the little masterpieces they had so carefully been working on that morning. Wendy with a colorful butterfly, and Peter a family of cats to represent Natasha and Pepper and there soon to be born baby. The pups took great pleasure in explaining their art and holding it out proudly.
Tony felt his eye twitch. Not now, he couldn’t do this right now.
Coulson and his team returned to SHIELD headquarters while Clint delivered Barnes and Stark to the tower. Some of the SHIELD personnel had attempted to pressure Barnes into staying there for medical treatment, instead, the soldier begged off stating he would be better off at the tower.
He promised, every time he left and suited up he always promised he'd do his best to come home. “M' sorry…m' so sorry.”
Dark tinctured windows oscillated with the bass beat as Dave Mustane's unmistakable voice screamed out “Peace sells but who's buyin?” over an aggressive guitar lick.
“Don’t get your briefs in a bunch honeypoo, daddy’s ok.”
It was difficult for the alpha to touch down in central part alone, knowing that for everything his omega had done, and he had commit even worse sins. The only difference that separated them was a mask. No one knew who the winter solider truly was. The public had seen grainy images from a distance and shaky cell phone footage of the street fight in Washington. Steve and his pack, the avengers, they made sure to keep Barnes name out of the papers.  Steve in his infinite protective nature.
Tony tipped his head in recognition, “oh yeah, how my babies doing. That was a nifty little build if I do say so myself. And I do say so; seriously I made wings, while not as cool as booster boots still pretty impressive.”
They might not make it out of here.
That last sentence hung in the air between them and Steve’s face grew red. “Keep me safe…Keep. Me. Safe?  What do you think I am some helpless little breeder you have to lock away so I don’t hurt myself?”
“I don't know what to do.” James’s words broke free in a in a shuttering exhale.  “ He hardly sleeps or eats, I'm scared to death to go home or even leave him alone. I keep seeing him laying there like he was before but...but gone. I can't lose anyone else. I'm losing my mind because I don't know how to I would ever cope without him.”
He jolted at the voice, rapidly blinking away the gossamer that tinted his brain. “Tony?”
The alien smiled hedging his legs around the muscular male’s hips and grinding into him. It was a dirty trick but enough to throw the mortals concentration enough to turn the tables. “My. We wouldn’t want that now would we?”
The siren shook her head and laughed, “Nah, I’m not getting anywhere near that shit show. Feel free to intervene on my behalf though.”
Waking up tied to a hospital bed isn't the best experience, then again neither is the look of sorrow and disappointment on his mothers face. The too bright shine in his father and brothers eyes. Even his aloof sister standing against the wall looking down on him with pity.
It wasn't long after waking up from their joint nap time that Bruce returned, with Stark who was eyeing him dubiously. Loki almost wanted to point out that he hadn't baked the child into a pie or fed him to a gorgon..whatever it was the mortal assumed he may do.  Yet alas, his dear little doctor would have frowned greatly upon that so Loki minded his manners - just this once.
Now Steve and Tony sat in the newly renovated med lab of Avengers tower, well… that’s not entirely accurate. Tony is sitting and grumbling over having to fill out paperwork - which he thinks is some archaic form of torture.
"Ok... by Tony. By peter.. it was great having him we should do this again.. but not too soon huh cause yeah we will have a lot on our hands in just about oooo three weeks left yea. Ok bye!!"Bruce rushed the pair out .Bless him
Steve knew this might be too soon, maybe he should wait and watch Tony a little more. Be sure of who he was sharing a home with...but then, then there was that smile against his skin and those hands sneaking under the back of his shirt just like they always do. Damn his weakness but he wanted this back so badly that it hurt. Maybe this wasn't the time for strategies when Tony needed him so much right now. When he needed his alpha just as badly. “Jarvis, will you send the kids up to Clint's floor for the night please?”
The group had been careful, not using any names or terms that might give them away, to switching cars every few days. Obviously, they were paranoid or had made some of the previous agents tailing them. Both of which made watching them for little crumbs of information – boring and difficult.
The omega huffed thinking about and tossed a dishrag onto the the drying rack. There was only so many times he could clean up the kitchen before he scrubbed the color off something. Was that even possible? Who knows. The point was Steve was bored with sitting at home in the penthouse while the team went out on missions.
“Were are you going with Tony…”
“Agent May, I’d like to see you in my office.”
Honestly, why did there need to be so many different choices of laundry detergent. “I don't wanna smell like’ a field of lavender or a mountain stream...where the hell is the soap smellin soap.” He muttered going down the isle until he finally spotted a boring looking bottle far cheaper than all the others that just said it cleaned.
They had made the call, everyone was coming to try and confront Tony. Some weird intervention, Bruce didn’t like the idea of cornering the billionaire when Tony was so clearly unstable. Nonetheless it was the best idea they had.
"Don't...just....don't."
He huffed out a sigh of pent-up frustration. Dr. Banner had said that it was likely he would not go into a full heat with all the recent stress. Chances were, he’d just feel uncomfortable while any active hormones fluctuated as his body returned to health. The order, while tentative was clear, Loki had to give himself a break. This was often easier said than done, but he was trying.
“They are all in their 90’s Stark! How does this help me?”
Song: I go through- O.A.R
On the way inside, she noticed the loading bay doors; they had been maintained and greased. Clearly lacking any substantial build up of rust on the tracks from lack of use. Someone had been coming and going regularly in a van - non descriptive most likely and an old model.
Green eyes crinkled with a smile at the little pup. “Of course darling.” Loki said, picking the boy up onto his hip. “What would I ever do without such a bright little helper by my side?”
As it seemed to Phil, Loki had been. The guy taught kids for goodnes’s sake! He hadn't so much as gotten a parking ticket! Not that he was sure Loki knew how to drive...that was beside the point. The point was, Loki was not a threat anymore. Somehow, Nick hadn't received the memo.
After the kitchen was cleaned and dishes put away Steve still had to go into town, the package left for him by the door with specific directions of the destination. A merchant’s hall near the castle, to a man named Gideon Malick.
He thought he was ready, not knowing how ready she was. The flowers in hand were meaningless next to her packed bags.
I decided then that I would never lose you again, no mater the lies i had to tell..if the old me had to die to be free. I would find you and keep you safe, because your last piece of light i have.
“We are all younger than you in that respect and yet...” Charles paused looking at the omegas youthful face. “Yet I think your heart is still very young. You're learning not only about this world but yourself. Learning is always a good thing.”
Fate was a cruel joke.
Tony's reason was sound and Steve agreed that it would be good for Peter, having at least one of them there all the time, With Steve's missions and the occasional business trips for Stark industries they were able to work out a plan. It wasn' t like Tony had given up everything. He still tinkered in his workshop as the Avengers tech support. Those years were so good, it seemed like for once everything was finally falling into place. That wonderful domestic routine that Tony never thought he would enjoy.
The alien omega wasn't the most sociable and honestly, that had been fine for most of them. However, the more she thought about the worse it sounded. Yes- Loki had tried to take over the world and kill a bunch of people – them included. So a little animosity was understandable. Having gotten the full story form Thor later about Loki being just another pawn in a bigger scheme had made a difference to some, to others it was merely a technicality.
“Something wrong with reindeer games. He seemed like he was fighting fit last time I saw him.” Tony realized then that the world goes on outside the tower. Here was a guy who, for all intensive purposes was part of his pack. Barnes looked like hell now that he really looked.
"He's Captain America Tony. Do you think he'd lie?" Natasha interjected kneeling down next to the child.
“Language Captain.” Jarvis commented, the phrase making both men smile and chuckle just a bit. At least the mood had been lightened.
There wasn't a dry eye in the tower as Steve knelt down and opened his arms. "Yeah, you're the best boy Tony. You're dad bragged so much about his smart little guy."
“That was before.” Howard muttered and snatched the diagrams from her grasp. “I’ll make one and drop it the oceans …kill all those damn monsters one of these days.”
The former director stood firm, his visible eye hard with resolve. “I made a call Captain, isn’t that what you do?” He said with a tilt of his head.
AN: I am not confident with fight scenes, but I did try my best so don’t ream me if its not up to snuff.
Rockwell smiled softly, “Yes well you might be right, but let me ask you this Mr. Stark. Having known the Captain would you say he is in fact though the shining example of Alpha superiority?”
The use of her first name sent Pepper back a step. “I have seen you Tony; I have been there for everything so just please, let me be there now. Please I’m begging you just don’t do this, there has to be another way.”
“Yeah fine, but Pepper’s…”
“Look at you.” The alpha purred, sitting back on his feet as he caressed his mates blushing thighs. He loved that about Steve, he was so pale that he seemed to blush everywhere. Silk creamy flesh adorned with blotches of red, it was a feast for the eyes. “This is just a preview sugar, just wait till I get you on your knees all wet and dripping for me.” He said taking the bottle and dripping a cool slick line over the Omega’s primary and secondary sex. “Won’t even need this, you’ll be all hot and ready for me won’t you?”
The chorus of “yes papa” seemed to be enough to get them off the hook for now.
“Nice try Jim. Shock tactics? To bad, I already know I’m a piece of shit. Peter is taken care of, he will be better off trust me. Now, you have two choices, 1 - you turn that old bucket around and let me work.  Or 2 - I kill you.”
“Steve!”
“He's 13 actually.”
“So, Mally dear,” Stark's voice echoed around the warehouse. His voice taking on a metallic edge that sharpened each phrase like a razor. “You wanna put your toys away like a good boy before I have put you in time out?”
another hit of that Omega Steve for you junkies
“He watched you while you were sleeping.”
Stark rolled his brilliant eyes and bounced the two giggling children. “That was one time Brucey Bun, and it was a mandatory restart. I'm good now.”
“I know, just trust me. I would never hurt you.”
“Little Tony?”
Could this man be any weirder? Steve asked himself that multiple times a day, even so, he wouldn't have it any other way. Not when he watched Tony with the kids, or the bots. Not when he looked to the sky’s for that familiar flash of hot rod red.
Jarvis’s voice filled the workroom as Tony stood back from the new armor.
Big brown eyes sparkled as they focused on blue. " I know you!!! My Daddy told me! we see'd you ! You're Cap'n America!!"  little Tony clapped his hands and ran to him clamoring and chatting animatedly about how much his daddy had told him about the great Captain America. "Daddy be so happy! He been lookin for you! Come on we gonna find him and then I'll be a good boy!"
“Tell me what I said..” he blurted out, “ If.. if you’re Steve, tell me what I said in your dressing room before we got married. Tell me exactly what I said to you.”
Things felt calm for a moment few as they began setting the table . Napkins folded and silver wear in place, bowls and highchair's for the little one. It was repetitive and Steve needed that sometimes. The order of domestic ritual calmed him down. Only this time it didn't last. That 'bad feeling' Steve had reference in the kitchen, bloomed into full blown panic.
Like after New York, sure they all tried going their separate ways but somehow they all gravitated back together. Watching out for each other, lending an ear for late night calls when nightmares came. They had formed this odd little group that somehow worked.
Everything about you drew me as a moth to flame, even when i knew your fire would extinguish far sooner than my own. Still... I could not back away from that cloying glow. I wanted you..even when it hurt.
ep1 : I know those feels
Steve wasn't that proud anymore... when you fight for something only to find out that its gone, that all you've sacrificed has been for nothing.
“She took him Pegs…you gotta believe me. She took my son.” Howard broke down falling at her feet. “She took him and drowned him, she killed my boy, that monster killed my boy.”
“An associate of mine procured this some time ago, from a village in the south seas. Apparently the carcass itself had been decade but the tribal people there kept this as a sort of shrine to the creatures. He was able to barter with their leaders of course. For the right amount of coin people will part with gods it seems.”
“Of course muffin, I’ll be a good boy and  get all the extra credit. Oh and Steve.” Tony pause at the edge of the balcony with the visor of the helmet flipped up. “You complete me!” He said with a grin dropping off the edge and darting up into the sky.
“Brother please, I know I have been less than willing to heed your speech in the past. That said, you must admit you have been deceptive before - which is why I ask you now to tell me the truth. Are you well?”
Loki's face twisted and crumbled. "He...he did this on purpose to  make a fool of me. I have done nothing but try my best to show that i am reformed and still still he plays such cruel jokes! If i wished to be made a jest of I would have remained on Asgard!"
Loki leaned into the embrace all but falling against his alpha, he should be honest he knew that. “Not …entirely.” Such a small admittance felt like breaking a chain around his neck. Maybe he couldn't say the words now but perhaps he could have this.
It was difficult for Bruce to hand the case over to someone else – but at this point Bruce was just spinning his wheels. He was having more luck on Extremis, and he couldn't devote time to both Tony and Loki. “Yeah, I know I just...”
Pork won me, it was over from the start.
Fury’s nostrils flared, lips pressing in a tin line. “If you do this, take out the headquarters now. All that’s going to do is give rise for the remaining smaller factions to rise up. It might take them years but they will rebuild, that’s not killing Hydra that’s just cutting off the biggest head. If you recall that doesn’t work.”
I know it's been a long time but yeah...bad things happened and ...well that is all. But here I am and here is a  new  chapter. I have no idea if I still have readers for this or if I deserve them but for anyone still wanting to read this - thanks for being here.
“Hey Loki, it's a nice morning.”  Not  the best of openers but it's something that at least prompts the slender man to look up in greeting.
“Jarvis gimme visual and audio, I want you to record riendeergames. Vitals, energy fluctuations, all sensors go! If Merlin sweats I wanna know the ph!”
As the mini sub sealed closed and lowered into the rough seas, Bucky did his best to keeps the ship level -he doesn’t like it but knows he would slow them down and he’s better aim with the ships artillery. If the looks of the dark pool were any indication, they might need him.

A large smile breaking across his face as he took a few hesitant steps toward the glittering mirage that slowly began to solidify. What a sight it was, all the glory or leather, green and gold. No one could say that his guy couldn't make a damn grand entrance.
The admittance made her cringe, “Tony, Steve isn’t me. What happened between us, just because I wasn’t strong enough  has no bearing on Steve.”
Apparently, for Pepper’s birthday Tony had set her up a private “dancing in heels” lesson with Yanis Marshall. The ceo decided to invite Natasha and Loki as she considered they would be the only other occupants of the house who might actually find it interesting.
One could hear the smile in archer’s voice, “No patriot pop on my radar, by the way anyone know where the can is? I have pee..”
The former Queen was directing mothers and their pups down through a hidden escape route beneath the thrones. She looked out to her people and her family and felt her heart break for them. “Jane, do as your husband and king command…please.” She called out to the young siren and beckoned the girl with her out stretched hand.
Barnes picked up his too light mate and carried him into the master bathroom. “Hey sweetheart, look at me. Loki?” Nothing. If he hadn't felt the ravenette's shallow breathing, he would have sworn he was dead. “Let’s get you cleaned up ok honey? Then maybe a little food in ya and I'll take care of you.”
Still, didn’t Steve deserve better? Tony wasn’t special, sure, he had his money and the suits but at the end of the day, he was a social embarrassment most of the time and emotionally stunted man-child with abandonment issues. Oh, god he was going to fuck this kid up beyond measure and Steve was going to hate him for it.
Add to that for the last few minuets Dr. Simmons had been standing in his room looking at a stack of paper work and at him as if she was figuring out how to break some terrible news.
Only now, that voice was darker and breathy from the life draining from it. “I didn’t do it for him.”
“Just think about it! With that kind of speed! Think how fast would the gathering season go! The hunting parties could be in the North Sea and back in no time, not to mention the fact that sharks are natural fish finders. I’m telling you this has so much potential, man I need to get back to the shop and start laying out schematics and …”
Fury says gesturing to a large screen behind him. Its a satellite image of a warehouse...no ...it's a slaughter house. Wonderful. “We believe that Mallen has taken his crew to this location to administer the bio-agent he is now in possession of. Moreover, we know now he's not alone, this isn’t some home grown anarchist skinhead fuckery ladies and gentleman.” Fury changes the images and they watch as the image enhances to show black SUV's and men in dark tactical gear bearing a familiar insignia.
While working with the mutant children Loki had come to see that even those that the public at large saw as 'cast offs', still had a community. Not all hope was lost because of the color of skin or designation. When doors closed because of the X-gene, windows opened in the form of fervent hope for a brighter tomorrow. Loki had helped a number of frighten children with talents similar to some of his own and felt...completed. When had he forgotten that?
Amora raged, “He’s ruined it that fool!” She shouted looking down at the powerful magic humming on the center of her chest.
“Brother, what ails young Anthony?”
Phil reached over and placed a hand on the captains shoulder, “I know where you’re coming from, I waited a long time because I grew up in a strict family. I had those same ideals and to be honest I was alright with that. My mother had a fit when I told her not only was I seeing a younger alpha but one who was divorced with several young pups. I knew what was right for me and that sometimes the values you have can change with understanding.”
Steve took a deep breath; he couldn’t worry about it right now. After Tony left he would look at his chart they left at the foot of the bed, make sure, it said what it needed to say and if it didn’t then he’d deal with it later.
Bruce offered to take first 'Loki watch', saint that he was.
Tony grinned back and pulled up a chair, “And here I am with out a set of dominos. That means having an actually conversation.”
Loki tugged off the over-sized sweatshirt he'd stolen from James. He felt warm and a bit disgusting, the idea of a long lazy shower sounding more and more pleasant.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t! If you kill him and we get nothing that’s our ass!”
Luckily, Steve adored house rules, he admired chore boards, gaga for grocery lists- he love any and all lists. Tony was pretty sure Steve and Phil had a little club where they hang out and talk in terms of bullet points.
A sliver of fear took route as he ran a hand over his wrapped stomach moving lower.  They wouldn’t have noticed would they?  It’s not that noticeable, not like it should be. Still, he couldn’t remember much about being brought in. He couldn’t remember anything beyond the familiar grip of the cold water biting his wounds and filling his lungs.
“I have you Loki. I would do anything to protect you as I always should have.”
“I wish it were that simple Tony, I really do. Extremis doesn't just enhance it hacks the body's repair center and rewrites it. In the first stage, the body is ravaged until its little more than a giant open wound. Extremis tricks the brain into thinking the host body is wrong. Then ...it rewrites everything. Normally this process is carried out with the test subject placed on life support in a containment chamber.”
“Sure did,” She smiled and gestured to the case “These are pretty popular in Japan so I thought why not give the customers something new to try out. Whichever flavor is most popular we will keep on the menu. The green one is Green tea, that kind of reddish one is Azuki bean, the pale pink is Cherry Blossom. Wanna try one?”
Bucky never thought he’d look at anyone the way he used to look at Steve, but then there was this smart-ass omega with all that sass and grace. All those cutting remarks that hid so much. He saw the pain they shared and knew that Loki had demons too.
With knowledge in hand Loki set off to the vast fields and forest of the realm to procure his first gift of courting.
Phil had been enjoying his first cup of coffee and going over a few reports when she'd walked in. “I know, Natasha will be performing a demonstration in the training room with Mac. I didn't think you'd want to unless of course you've changed your mind.”
“You can Steven; you are…a good man.”
Loki hadn't realized he had zoned out until he felt himself being led away by the arm.
After  all of the kids and one reluctant archer are freed with a clean bill of health, Loki is relaxed enough to allow Jarvis's scans and Bruce's Exam.
“Howard…put the gun down.”
Everything that Loki has been hiding finally hits him and he feels like a failure as an alpha. 'Christ almighty...' he thinks, watching the ravenette trembling in the door way clenching and clenching his fists. There's a faint scent of vomit and sweat handing just under the forceful tang of cinnamon chewing gum. 'He's worried himself sick again and he didn't want me to know.'
Steve smirked and got as comfortable as he could, “Nothing.”
Steve didn’t like the cold.
“Is...Is he ok?” Tony felt his heart breaking. Why hadn't he felt that sooner? The whole time he hadn't felt Steve at all. No pain, no fear...now that he thought about it. He didn't feel anything.
Pepper nodded and hugged him again, "I will if you want me to, or Bruce said he could. We'll do this however you want."
Barnes hummed and moved around a tight corner with his back to the wall. The way was clear, looking up the soldier spotted an opening in the grates above, leaping up pulling himself up onto a catwalk that meandered around the main operation floor. It was the perfect vantage point for the coming and goings. In a perfect scenario, Mallen would come out and James could snipe the man off from this distance. They could be home for dinner with minimal collateral damage. However, things never quite worked out so easily. “I don't have eyes on Mallen or the Madam yet. Looks like they might be hold up on a lower level. Schematics said this place had underground freezers right?”
Loki placed his palms on the desk and leaned in, a slight rose to his high cheekbones.
Tony wiped his eyes with rough hands, hands that worked just as hard as the father he barely knew. “I thought I’d never trust anyone, that I could never get past the disappointment in your eyes. I was so broken… but I’m not anymore. My alpha is so much better than you were to mom. Everything you said to me, all the conditions and unattainable goals that I had to surpass just to earn your love… I don’t have to do that with him. I made something of my self, people who matter are proud of me. He takes care of me because he loves me, just because no other reason.”  The words seemed to pour like the tears from the omegas dark eyes.
Stark was addicted from then on. Something about seeing Americas golden boy all, red-faced and spread out begging. It was the big boost to his already inflated ego. The sounds Steve made when he finally let go. How he’d take anything …anything, Tony was willing to give him and beg for more. Tony still gets chills every time he walks into his workshop. He can still see the hand shaped dents in the metal work table where he had Rogers bent over  panting and begging while he fingered him with the gauntlet on.
Tony curled his lip at the statement, “Look I don’t know about superior, he hasn’t seen Pulp Fiction yet so really the jury’s still out. But sure why not he’s as Alpha as they get for a guy who likes spandex.”
Steve inhaled deeply through his nose and closed his eyes, “Stark…you covered. My Shield. In Rhinestones…”
Even so. With all that he's lost, what's been gained had been immeasurable. The lives both he and the creature have saved, people who have left their mark on his life.
“Might be Phil’s  ...” Steve chimed in hiding his smile behind the morning paper.
Steve moved back allowing the brunette to get on his knees and work the buckles and zips on his uniform. He could have cried at the relief when his cock sprang out of its confines.
Tony grinned, “Then why are you so funny looking? Seriously you look like a matrix cosplayer who had a bad day at the optometrist.”
“I’m an engineer I should know the logistics of this!”  Tony groaned rolling over in the nesting room.
“I wanna have another baby.”
He was Howard’s business associate and by all standards the kind of man who would kill his own mother just to get ahead. Peggy knew why he was here and was furious as she stood at the door way and watched Stane pour Howard another glass of the firewater.
The mood of the room grew somber as the elder man spoke. “May I ask you Captain Rogers, do you have any children, a wife perhaps?”
The days he does not want to remember – there was work then too, every time he opened his eyes there was a mission waiting. These days it almost felt kindred with all the demand SHIELD had for him. He couldn't say he hated it and that was maybe the worst of it when he got right down to the old brass taxes. He was still a soldier looking for a war to fight and SHIELD had been happy enough to have the Winter Soldier on their side this time around.
Jane bit her lip. “Better than a week or so ago but... no I'm sorry. Would you like to visit him today or do you want to relax for a while and go tomorrow?”
“Oh god no…” Tony groaned and clung to Steve theatrically, “No mini agents, I know he’s already got Nathaniel watching supper nanny so we are doomed. Can you imagine? You probably already have the next generation of Captain America fan club getting ready to stare at you with googly eyes.”
“He’s not going to answer you Stark.” Natasha said holding her phone punching in some code as the Tower began to lock down. “You placed protocol remember, right after you adopted Peter. That if or Steve were ever compromised in any way Jarvis’s number one priority would be to protect Peter. That’s what he’s doing. He’s protecting him, because there’s a little boy down stairs who needs his father. You would know all about that wouldn’t you Stark?”
Meanwhile Tony was giggling in his lab, “Hey J have you told Steve that we are all robots yet? Can I come up and start beeping at him. Been working on my best lieutenant Data impression.”
Simmons did her best to be swift about the exam. It was mostly to check the size of the uterus, they already new Steve’s omega organs were slightly underdeveloped. Likely, they had been before the serum and the serum had originally been designed for an alpha. Therefore, the chemical alterations set out to perfect and personify Alpha-like traits only. Leaving his other internal organs alone having deemed them ‘unnecessary’. This also gave a great incite into how the serum worked.
Bucky laughed loud and long, “Oh yeah, I get my ass beat by a pregnant omega. That’s justice right?”
Peter and Wendy had been looking forward to this day for weeks. Every day closer had the pups nearly bouncing off the walls Tony was glad to have the little ones packed up and out the door for the day. He loved his kids, but he loved silence more, which in itself was funny considering a few years ago the alpha was all about noise and activity. However, he had since learned the value in peace and quiet.
Jane shook her head, eyes darting around between her mate and the now shambled hall. “Thor I can’t! I can’t just leave you here!”
Steve clenched his fist hearing the echoes of laughter from the dining room. Brock and Grant the spoiled idiots. He heard the crash of yet another teacup and knew that it most likely had been some of his mother’s china. There was only a few of them left at this point, so few things he had of her that were still in one piece… including him if he was being honest.
“Something’s are worth the risk.”
"Thank you."
War has a way of changing a man, if you asked Steve five years ago what he thought he was doing by enlisting- he would tell you he wanted to help. He would say it was the right thing- that if other guys were going out there to die then what right had he to sit at home while they did all the fighting. Maybe he’d lower his head in that shy way and say, “well…can’t let that jerk Bucky go alone now can I?”
Why did this kid have to be so beautiful.
Loki really should have taken the offer.
Steve charged up the stairs, it was on the second landing when shots rang out just over his head. Glancing to the twin bullet holes in the wall then back up at the sniper - the captain felt his heart sink. “Bucky…”
AN: Song featured Is No Bravery by - James Blunt I do not own it or the avengers this work is purely for fan enjoyment and I profit in no way.  Please support the official releases.
It wasn't.
“Sunrise.” Loki's voice is hallow but its a response nonetheless. Something that Steve can latch onto.
Steve was innocently looking for a place to sketch when he walked in on the three of them and the choreographer.
“Very well, I will not say goodbye. I shall be expecting you for dinner James. Don't be late.”
At first it was just little snippy comments here and there, followed by an oddly apologetic god of mischief. Then it got weird.
They continued through the facility Phil used his key card to slip through what he called ‘safe halls’ “Fury is pretty paranoid now considering what happened to HQ.  We can take some of the evac routes to the security entrance. There will be two guards inside and four outside. Once we make it outside you will see several ‘abandoned’ freight containers. That’s where our ride will be.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes. "Yeah but he made the mistake of marrying that idiot so we are." Snapping shut the face place and taking to the sky.
Bruce nodded and gestured for Tony to follow as they moved Steve into the jet. “Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out.”
Fury hasn't said anything on the matter and the black leather clad man has a look on his usually impassive face that makes James wonder if he knows more than anyone in this room. It wouldn't be the first time.
“Sweetie, I hate to break it to you but you can fix everything by sprinkling a little Captain America on it.” Tony huffed against his shoulder before wrapping his arms around his husbands waist. Feeling Steve in his arms was the best medicine he could ask for. “If you had been there....Steve if something had happened to you or the baby. I would have never forgiven myself.”
“No… we won’t”
Just when Tony thought he knew what it was to be happy, there goes this man proving that there's just a little bit more love to found in this world. Taking his omegas face in his hands, he captured those firm full lips and laughed into the kiss. “ I love you so much.”
“Pep…what’s wrong.”
Today had not been a good day, waking up felt like a chore and Loki lay in bed trembling uncontrollably as thoughts assaulted his mind. James embraced him whispering soft assurances in his ears, for some reason it hadn't felt like enough. The mere idea of setting his feet on the floor brought fear. All he could think of was how he wasn't ready, how must he look? What if he lost control. What if he frighten them? What if they could see the oppressive darkness in his heart. What if everyone could smell the terrible sickness on him?
She always said no. "You shouldn't catch a chill with your asthma." she always worried for him.
Driving back to the tower had been an ordeal as the traffic picked up around them. Barnes found himself wanting to roll down the window and scream. That wouldn't have been wise, as it seemed like every loud sound was making his omega that much worse. Every blare of a horn or sudden stop had Loki curling up more in the passenger seat. James was starting to wish he had taken Stark up on his offer to 'pimp' his ride. All of Tony's cars were equip with sound shielding and the very best interior sound systems available. Some soft music right about now might have help he thought. Hoping to mask the city noise outside the SUV. Plucking up some CD that Loki had left in the visor, some German folk rock thing that he could never understand but Loki seemed to always enjoy. Turning the music up to try and drown out the noise seemed like as good an idea as any.
“Our heir, reindeer games, and she's hungry.” Tony quipped as he dismantled a bacon cheese burger and flipped open a box of doughnuts.
Dressing was mechanical and routine, in a way – soothing. This could be enough, he thought, get through a few moments, then an hour, then day. Try harder and maybe, just maybe tomorrow won't feel like swallowing poison.
“The first thing I’m going to do after I get what I want is pass you off to a nurse. Noisy little pup, I have helped you and this is how you repay me? With this endless shrieking, you’re lucky I do not bash your skull against a coral bed.”
None was well and he knew his own words to be a lie, this horrible thing Amora had done. Thor realized then it had been some time since he’d last seen her in Loki’s company. Perhaps she had become heavy with child and hid away, still the infant was a tiny one, far smaller than it should be. Perhaps Loki’s son was born early. It made sense; Thor knew his brother had been quietly working to present a favor of courtship to Amora. Perhaps this child was why.
Loki doesn't speak and that's okay with Steve. Baby steps, he tells himself as he takes a seat beside the other omega. “How long have you been up?”
“I’m sure your very proud of yourself.” I mutter, he’s still smiling. How can he be so smug right now.
The ancient magical creatures that ruled the seas and mastered its creatures. Once they looked over man like gods. Now? Now they hid from the ignorant beasts above that saw them and the other beings of the ocean as little more than trophies creatures of fantasy.
“Easy.” Tony said One of the gantlets unfolding and now the alpha was touching him with his bare hand. Moving his face left and right before looking down to survey the damage.
“I know you don’t want to believe it Tony but its me! Fury lied!” Steve came out of the small cave holding the shield at the ready. He thought he timed it right, if this suit was like any of the older Ironman models that would be enough to take out at least one half of lower propulsion. Tony could still get of the ground but it would be unstable.  If Stark were looking for serious fight, he wouldn’t risk it.
A song came to the billionaire’s mind, one he had sung hundreds of times since that night months ago.  “Peter and Wendy.”
Steve was dog tiered when he came home from his last mission, falling into bed and dieing for the next 15 to 20 hours seemed like a good plan. Well…that is if you don’t live with Tony Stark.
Loki smirked over the lip of the cup and took a sip. The pleasant warmth spreading through his as much as the sincere compliment had. “Thank you, I feel good today.”
When Steve finial griped him pulling them back to chest Tony already knew before he felt the steady throb and rush inside him. They just breathed together fighting to stay vertical when everything in their brains was shouting to lie down and go to sleep.
Now they have a 4-year-old who's crying because he can't understand why his chest is glowing and just want's his nanny Anna and Jarvis.
“You don't have to do this alone Tony. I'm sorry if I made you feel like you had to.” Steve pushed back and looked in hi eyes. “I love you Tony, but I will protect our kids, even if it has to be from you. I need to know the truth, what has Extremis done? “
Barnes reached out and took his hand across the table. “Loki, you know I love you and...and if you wanna look into adopting a kid then we can do that, but don't feel like you failed me baby.”In truth James doesn't want to give up trying for a child. However, seeing how much pain lay in those forest green eyes he knew deep down how much this has hurt Loki. The soldier willing to do whatever he can do to protect his love. If that means that they take this road then so be it. “We can look into okay?”
This wasn't a joke.
The others joined in laughing leaving the ginger to brood a bit nursing his beer.
Thanks for Clarifying that Tony, altho Caps given that  (imma fuck you up so bad you will be seeing some gad damn stars and stripes in a min) face so ....
“Ja, it has come up. Unfortunately, my biology is very different due to my mutation.” Kurt said softly, his pointed tail wrapping around to rest in his lap. “I was once very troubled knowing that I would never carry a child. Then I realized that all of the children here I love so much, they have in a way become my family. Perhaps one day there will even be a child who comes here with no family and there will be something about them and I will know in my heart, that that child will need me as much as I need them.”
That's what would happen, that's what had to happen.
“But you don't like it, tell me.”
Natasha set her tea cup on the table and looked the man who was once her enemy in the eye. “Because like it or not, we worry about you. Steve, Bruce, Pepper. Me. James especially. People notice things Loki, just as if I'm noticing them right now. I'm telling you the truth because I think you're sharp enough to know I didn't come all this way to do paperwork and even if I had, I wouldn't have stopped here. I'm here because I needed to find the truth. Now, do want to tell me? Or are we still having our little tea party?”
“So...” Loki felt pressure climbing up his chest into his throat. “So it is my fault, my mind... that's what you're saying.”
“Right, ok that great that’s. …” Her words trailed off as Tony grabbed for her hand muttering nonsense. “Whoa, hey Tones it’s gonna be alright okay? Your Pops is here and he’s got the best mojo around!”
“Nonsense! J, send Pep a note that Steve’s here and staying on the common floor for now, but when she can, stop by with those catalogs.”
“Right away Dr. Banner”
“Oh sorry.. I'm still..I don't know adjusting. Bruce said it may take a while with the bond broken and since I just had my heat everything's out of wack at the moment.” Steve awkwardly tried to apologize. That was just like him to try and down play what he was feeling.
Title: Little high in the stride
“Maybe you should call me Steve seein’ as we just got pretty acquainted.”
Tony wanted to tell her it wasn't going to be fine. His chest felt like it was collapsing in on itself. “Darc..Darc I can't..”
“Can’t help it..” the cause of Steve’s torment commented from between the omegas’ splayed thighs. “God you’re so responsive… I love it.” Tony muttered before returning to laving his tongue up Steve’s straining cock. Pausing only momentarily before wrapping his lips around the flushed crown of his prize.
Finally, a Currier came with some clothes, jogging pants, sandals and a zip up hooded sweatshirt.
“Maybe we need to let it go…”
“I do not reside within the walls of your precious tower now do I?” his remark lacking the amount of fire he would have liked to levy behind it.
No… he was ….he was the human equivalent of the A-bomb. A wonder of science - built to destroy.
Then of course, he had a high-strung alpha pacing back and forth between the bedroom, nest, and kitchen.
Warnings: Abduction, Torture, blood, violence, and last but not least – them feels!
Steve walked along the path for what felt like hours, passing large monuments and carved stone angles that watched over the dead. The great obelisk and tombs, fields of simple crosses or flat markers. None of which bore the name he came here for, the sacred place were needed to make his penance.
Once Steve had, sealed a modest stack of envelops he went to check on the kids who both begged to put off their naps until after lunch. Steve decided to allow it slide this once.
Nothing was going to satisfy quite like revenge.
The woman smiled softly if a little sad, “The thing were he gets something good and then immediately thinks he doesn’t deserve it so he acts like an ass to prove he doesn’t deserve it. Believe me when I say this Steve, Tony’s worst enemy is Tony. That man can save the world and talk such a good game, but at the end of the day…he’s still thinking about everything he didn’t do.”
Tony looked back having over heard the conversation, “Try again Mini Me, more like 37...right about when I let you date.”
“Oh come on!” The billionaire chuckled and lent over to place a kiss on the apex of his omegas stomach, “Mommy is being a hypocrite because he thinks I didn’t hear him f-bomb earlier.”
"The blood of traitors boiled into wine?"  Loki mused flopping back on the sofa in a sprawl of long limbs.
Riding silently in the SUV on the way home, Loki keenly watched the scenery change and thought about this world he now called home. Earth, a not so special little dirtball in the vast reaches of the universe. Loki had seen many lands and many kinds of living, thinking, intelligent beings in his long life. He'd walked a line between one reality and the next and never once took notice for more than a fleeting moment. These where the follies of youth he suspected. Days long past where he had no concern for any but his own selfish Whimsey and fancies. Before his world narrowed down to single moments of pain and hurt that sunk in hooked gleaming fangs to demand his full attention.
“James.” Loki hindered him, sadness filling his eyes. “Please love, I can not endure this, as much as I wished to give you a child I can no longer endure the pain of failure.”
“I do not even know how to care for him. How to see past the memories of her.” Loki admitted as he shifted the little one in his arms. Tony had now claimed his finger and gummed at the digit passively.
Steve didn’t linger, he didn’t even look up before turning away and muttering a nearly inaudible ‘excuse me’ before leaving the table.
Tony ended up not quite scoring, but he did get much closer. The make out session on when they arrived home from there afternoon at the ballpark had ended with both men panting pressed up against each other on the penthouse sofa. Pants open and groping each other desperately. Who knew sporting events could cause such excitement.
Maybe she hadn't seen, what was there to see..he just liked to mess with Cap that's all. It was innocent really just a touch of a hand, a few well turned innuendo...a kiss. It wasn't anything so scandalous.
“Steve? Sugar?” Walking down toward the bedroom Tony wrinkled his nose as at an acrid tang in the air. “Honey?”
“And you think I’m the guy for that job?”
Finally, Just before Christmas Loki couldn't stand it and showed up himself. Natasha looked him up and down and let the suited man in, shes hadn't said anything other than to show him in.
Now, feeling human, Natasha nabbed a few goodies from the kitchen, “I almost wish Stark would go off on business meetings more often if we get muffins.”
“You’re anything but helpless Cap, but I promise.”
“J door now!”
It wasn't that Loki wanted to live a life a misery, the fact was...he already was. There was no one to blame for this failure but himself.
Pepper offered to find Steve a hospice nurse, hell she even offered to move in and take the duty of caring for Tony on herself. Steve couldn't do that, as kind as it was he felt like this was his job and to be honest the idea of anyone else caring for Tony when he was so vulnerable made his skin crawl. He trusted Pepper, he did - but Tony was his fiancé and there was no way he was going to back out of this just because times looked grim. He was going to marry this man and that meant for better or for worse, in sickness and in health.
However, even in the darkness there is light, and this light just so happened to be the Bitfrost.
“Ok, well have fun. I regrettably cannot stay and science with you Brucy bun. I promised spangles here some pop culture education. Did you know he doesn’t know who Spinal Tap was?”
Who could blame the Alpha; chances were that Tony had spent his whole life trying to avoid this sort of thing. How many money hungry omegas had already tried to sling a paternity suit at him? Surely, he didn’t think the same of Steve, but at the same time didn’t that make it worse? Because it wasn’t like Steve was lying for the hell of a payday. This was real and Steve didn’t want to be the man who ruined Tony Stark. “Just go home Stark.”
“As you know the Captain is alive and well.”
Through these infinite cycles of highs and lows our world and our perception of that world is perpetually changing. To one man, the hero may appear as a villain and the villain a hero. Perception is whatever we chose and in those choices we project onto the world around us.
It wasn’t so much what Loki had said during Bruce’s visit - but what he didn’t say.  Sometimes it’s the words left off that is so troubling. The way Loki didn’t ask about what was going to happen and didn’t seem to care much about talking about future plans.
By the end of the battle and clean up both men were so tired there was literally nothing sexy about staggering into the penthouse and peeling each other out of their clothes. The shared shower was more about comfort than anything else was, Steve kissed the bruising that Tony have from getting knocked around in the armor. In turn, the Alpha lovingly ran a soapy sponge over the soldiers face and chest to clear away the sweat and grime.
It was Barnes, super soldier hearing had its advantages. “I'll watch his back Stevie, I put that bitch down once. I could do it again.”
After that, it was all blaring sensors and flying ass over elbows until BLAMO! Right into the drink.
“Indeterminate... What the hell dose that even mean?”  Tony scoffed tossing the medical work ups to the side and reaching for a small leather bound journal that had been in the envelope as well. He knew immediately by the handwriting who had penned the notes before even reading the name.
Steve seemed to relax just a fraction so Tony scooted closer humming softly and rubbing a hand over the tight white cotton that was now ridding up over the baby bump.  Steve always slept better, when he sang to him, it was somewhat cute. Usually Tony would pick some old standard his mother used to play on the hi-fi when he was a kid.  Something else occurred to him tonight though, with a soft little thump against the palm of his hand.
The moon rose high over the waves, turning the black sea into silver with its opalescent glow. It would not be long now if the sailor’s maps were correct, and Howard hoped they were. He hadn’t had much time and was only able to find a small coal ship tied up on the docks, it wasn’t much but it had a cabin and the man who owned it was all too willing to take Howard’s money to rent the diminutive vessel for the night.
When she entered the workshop, she realized that someone with their dark intention and beady eyes was already there.
As Steve set the sandwiches out and Tony brought over the veggies and juice for the kids he observed Peter carefully holding a doll. “Whatcha got there Petey.”
Then again, it wasn’t just Widow that Tony blamed, he blamed himself to. So he made a choice, he was going to fix this, that’s what Tony Stark does right? He fixes, he repairs, and he builds.
Steve really had just steamrolled ahead and assumed the absolute worst of his alpha. “I guess not. He still left, still ran out of here like his britches were burning.”
_____________________________________________________
“I’m not asking for that, I know what I want or …at least I think I do. I just need to know where you stand. Where we stand.”
“Right, Loki. This isn't something you can assign blame to. Your feelings are valid and should be treated as such. You have undergone some very traumatic experiences in the last few years and are only now starting to find a place to feel safe in. I know you are feeling stress from trying to conceive but the most important thing right now is giving yourself time. I know hearing that might not seem helpful but from everything we've studied it may be the only answer.”
Phil countered away from the dark joke just enough to hopefully show he was ready for bygones to be bygones.
The mer leaned over the side balancing what would have been her hips on the port ledge as her fanning tail came into view behind her. “Silly mortal, nowhere in the shallow halls of your primitive mind could you conjure up anything even a fraction of what I am.”
“48 hours till wheels up.”
“He was having cramps, Jarvis said it was fine just a stress reaction but…Tony it worries me. I told him to lie down; Jarvis is reading to him and watching him. Just come home ok?”
“I came into this world alone... I fell alone, was lost alone and yet I live.” He growled defiantly as the water tinged his fair skin an angry red. “I will get through this alone.” Something in his head disagreed, sounding suspiciously like his mother.
“Yeah I am, although there is one thing.” Tony says, taking a serious note. “Do you want this? You don’t have to ya know. Things are different now and I would never force or guilt trips you, it’s your body and your choice.”
A swarm of snowmobiles and jeeps breached the hill; this was the largest installment of Hydra they had seen to date. The loud roar of the engines cut through the air sounding like a swarm about to descend. The team readied themselves for the assault, boots digging into the powdery snow.
That was the kick in the ass that Tony needed to finally get up on his hands and knees and force the suit up. “Cap was watching wasn’t he?”
Thor gave his brother a gentle shake. “How could she not? You captured Father's heart the moment he saw you, regardless of what you may naturally think of him. The Norns saw it fit to place you with us. Loki, I do not know what horrors you have seen or feel. But you are not unlovable. It matters not the color of your skin or the blood within you. It is your heart, your mind that is the measure of you. I am...”the Alpha choked up and blinked away the moister building his eyes.“ I am so proud of you. I look at you and I can see parts the brother I thought I lost forever.”
At least that brought a smile to Steve’s face as the blond huffed out a little laugh, trying to relax under the soothing touch.
Clint knew better than to come out for that one, Phil and his lying sweetness.
Steve sighed and ran a hand back through his sweat-slicked hair, “That’s really not necessary Jarvis.”
Laying under the gleaming lights of the med bay, James wishes this day would hurry up and end. He wants deep down it never started. Why did anyone have to go out and try and muck up the world? What purpose did something like that serve? Mallen turned himself into a monster, for what? Hydra? Anarchy?
This had to be the first time Tony was showing up voluntarily to anything, then again…nothing had ever mattered this much. A part of his brain wanted to chalk it up to instinct, sensing a member of his pack, an omega at that, was injured. More than that thought, something in his brain said he would be doing this even if he didn’t know Steve’s secret. Because they had gotten close, they were friends now and friends are there for each other. Maybe because they had gotten closer than Tony liked to admit, maybe because even before reading his fathers journal - Tony had thought about Steve, looked at him a little too long. When they were around each other Tony found any reason, he could just to touch him.
“Loki…Amora was here…she; this child is your son. I am sorry brother; I wish I had your words to put this delicately as you are surely blessed with such talents. The truth of it is your beloved Amora is a poisonous thing. In her madness I feared for your son and so I took him from her.”
“No. You won't.” Stark rose his palm and fired.
“Aye, it would be of considerable aid if the priestess would lend her extensive knowledge. However, I am afraid her request for such help was a price to heavy to bear.” Thor said shaking his head. “ My brother loathes what he is, even if he seems resigned to it now he will never respect the Frost giants or value their history. The lady Agrabota would only have agreed if Loki would return to their lands for teaching. She wishes him to take his place among their kind. In turn; I feel she may eventually request he finds a Joutnar to mate with and leave the Sargent behind.”
Warnings - blood, still birth, depression
“Good luck with that.” Bruce commented dryly handing a cookie to each pup before the twins ran off to terrorize Pepper and Natasha's other recent family member, a French bulldog named Butter.
Barnes laughed watching the display, “buddy, if your ma could see this.” The soldier chuckled and wiped his eye. “Ok, ok, time to go you little heathens. March!!”
“Damn …” The alpha hissed, finishing up in the restroom before washing his hands and splashing his face. “I didn’t think it would happen so soon. . .FUCK.. J put me on speaker.”
The alpha poked his head into the bedroom and watched as the omega turned from one side to the other and curled up around a pillow. Steve looked like he’d put on a bit more weight in the last couple of week when Tony was away. That was good; it meant the babies were healthy and if the side effect of filling out those all American thighs was a factor…well Merry Christmas Mr. Stark.  Tony watched a bit longer before slipping away to shower away the sweat that had no doubt left him a bit ripe even in the air circulated suit.
Amora’s eyes glowed white as she floated at the bow of a sunken battle ship, the skeletal remains of human technology looked over the edge of a deep-sea trench. Its bow pointed skyward as if a hand reaching up from its watery grave.
“Are you sure this is ok?” He’d asked her. Steve felt so guilty for putting so much on the woman even if Natasha seemed to take it all in stride.
“I’m with you Tony. Even now. If you’ll let me be.”
Steve seemed to acquiesces, walking into the room and gesturing to the sofa. “Alright, I'm listening.”
Obadiah Stane.
She loved that desperation, loved when they said ‘anything you want.’ “Bring him to me.”
That year was rough, Howard did not try again but he didn’t get better. If anything, he grew colder and had new hobbies, the inventor created more and more deadly implements and he had a habit of testing them out at sea.
“Agent Romanov is...there something you require.”
Oh great… she was coming on to him. “Ma’m I’m very flattered but.  …”
“No ones gunna make you do anything sweetie, come on now.” James held out his human hand in a peaceful gesture, “You trust me right?”
She sunk into the lush leather and let the tension leak out of her limbs. It was amazing to think that once upon a time Natasha could have never dreamed of a life like this. Home, Family, Friends, and Safety. All of that seemed like such a far away and childish dream.
They were as blue as sun drenched sea, so clear and sparkling with intelligence it took her breath for a moment. Those eyes…there color so strikingly similar to ones she knew well. “I will help him.”
There was no time for nostalgia and wishful thinking now though, he had things to do. There was a stack of notes he'd managed to jot down between meeting that held everything from jet upgrades, weapons upgrades to how to program the coffee maker in the common room to heat up formula and dispense bottles. Maybe a cleaning features too. Pepper would appreciate that.
Natasha stood and the thin knife slid away under her jacket sleeve, “I hear Australia nice.”
“No…I...I'd rather not.”
“Banner...may I ask one thing?” Loki curled up under the blankets, looking so broken.
By the time the group descends  on Shield Headquarters Barnes is already there stalking up and down in front of the satellite surveillance screens. “What the hell happened to intercepting them!” He scowls throwing his arms wide in irritation. He hasn't mentioned his conversation with Stark to anyone. In the back of his mind something tells him he should, knowing now that if whatever was taken from AIM was enough to make Stark nervous – they had a big problem. Even so, he’d given the pack Alpha his word and where James came from a man’s word meant something.
Yet now? Now they were clean slates, eerie in their perfection.
They went back up to the penthouse and it felt like a wash of emotions, Steve tried to close his eyes but when he did he could see it. Erksine, Schmitt, the train, the plane…the ice….the helicarrier…the water.
“Sir, pardon my interruption but I have Sergeant Barnes on the line for you. He has assured me that it is indeed urgent and provided the emergency password.”
“Taking everything into consideration, Living under Stark's roof has not been completely intolerable.” Loki said sipping his tea. His head ached slightly but it had on and off for days. “How is Kurt? He's phoned me a few times but...alas, I have been... detained.”
The snowmobiles close in opening fire as the team splits up to divide forces. Even with the months apart, they all work like a well-oiled machine. Directions flow over the coms as enemies are displaced one after another. Stark goes airborne and there’s no surprise when the familiar red and gold of the Mark 17 ‘heartbreaker’ with its blaring audio system.
Sudden realization flitted over the soldier's features. “But we just... I mean...it can't be that dangerous when we don't even know.” he spoke, voice quivering just slightly trying to convince himself.
It was then Stark turned to look at the row of his old armors, meaning to gaze on the past and onto better things, but that's not what he saw. Instead, the gold glare of blue glowing eyes ...his eyes.
“I see there’s a lot more bells and whistles” He commented following Stark into the elevator.
There was a slight a slight spark that dances up Loki's spine when the human took his hand. Something warm and cloying that curled up in the back of his brain. Something that whispered 'this is what you've been waiting for'. It was absurd to think the human would understand his actions or the repercussions he had just unleashed.
He hated having to do this to her, after hearing how bad off Steve was since the coms to Stark went down. He knew how much Natasha cared about her pack but that was exactly why she needed to stay there. “You and Banner need to stay there. You know I’m right.” It was beginning to look like Hydra had anticipated their arrival; if they had, they may also attempt to infiltrate the tower.
“Tony, have you two talked at all about this? You know I trust you but we both know that Steve is going to be in no state to consent to anything once we start, he may not even be now. If you go in there then chances are you could respond to him and trigger a rut. I need to know you can be in there with out causing a problem.”
James hung his head in defeat. “ Ya know how he feels about that stuff. He’s gonna say no.”
Once Stark was showered and redressed he slid under the sheets next to the omega, he frowned seeing the way Steve would flinch in dream and grip at the sheet.  “Shhh, your ok honey. Everything’s ok.” He said softly reaching out to caress the mound of life between them.
Tony cleared his throat for a moment then leaned forward in his chair wondering how it was that he got elected to lead this little ' come to Jesus meeting' “Look Buck, This whole situation...has frankly gone done the crapper for the last month nearly. For you..Probably a bit longer.”
“Scandalous.”
“Stark!” The soldier shouted before launching himself at their opponent’s back- this turned out to be a mistake as Mallen's body glowed and discharged a massive electrical jolt. Barnes found himself on the floor smelling of burnt leather and singed hair. His teeth ached and vision blurred, everything in him screaming to get up. He couldn't just lay here with Stark being pummeled; he had a promise to keep.
Walking back to the mansion felt like walking to the gallows, don’t get me wrong I like kids, I really do! Just…having one is somewhat inconvenient for me. Also, thinking about how ridiculous I was going to look waddling around in the uniform…
“No, I would never allow such harm to come to any man, no matter his past actions. I can not speak to a healer’s craft, but from what I have seen from my own brother - Lady Eir is efficient.”
So no, the glass could never be half-full for him. Not until he was unafraid of it being empty. To lose fear of loneliness meant freedom, it was a freedom he had lost the moment he placed his hands in those of James Buchanan Barnes. He handed over his heart that day and let a mortal man have the only thing with in worth having. He did all of this gladly and would do it a thousand times over. Loki was well and truly helpless to this man, he did the one thing he swore he wouldn't do and now he would fight tooth and nail to keep that love. If he had to lie – so be it, if he had to swallow down every ounce of poison his broken heart could provide – he would. He would do it because he Loved James Barnes ...more than he loved himself.
Barnes nodded along, sure, he might not get all the techno babble but it wasn't too difficult to get what Stark was laying down. “So she’s what...trying to build an army with this stuff?”
“Stark..”
Banner swallowed around the lump in his throat, eyes trailing over the misted flesh that almost glittered in the midday sun.
Tony hummed feeling the Captains heavy erection pressed into his lower back. “Maybe, seems like my nefarious plots worked, should I salute the flag?”
“Auntie Pepper!!!”
“Steve..” Tony crocked from down the table,
Thank god for Jarvis. “Sir, Captain Roger’s contractions have occurred this evening at 30 to 25 minuet intervals. This would suggest that they are not in fact Braxton Hicks.”
For now, there would be merriment and Joy throughout the kingdom as the much anticipated even was finally upon them.
Florescent lights are not flattering on anyone; the stark white light tends to wash everything in a sickly pallor. James had insisted that the old bulbs after getting tired of them flickering out far too often. He shouldn’t have sent the alpha out to replace the fixtures alone. In hindsight, he should have seen it coming. Now he’s left with this, the cold hue of white light making his pale skin look almost grayish yellow. On the other hand, maybe it was, maybe he was just ruined and the sickness was finally making itself visible under the utilitarian hum of the cylindrical bulb.
“I got it I  got it!” Peter said puffing out his little cheeks in concentration.
So yeah, Tony was right, he was stubborn. Stubborn was all he had for years, stubborn was what got him up every morning and kept him going on an empty stomach. Stubborn was what sent him to recruitment office after recruitment office. Damn right he was stubborn.
Steve couldn’t sleep; it was going to be hard enough to share a room with Tony considering the things they had said to each other lately. That wasn’t the only reason of course, there was more - more that the team didn’t yet know about. Truthfully he wasn’t so sure they really knew what was going on between them either. Such a fragile thing, unexpected but not entirely unwelcome as it turned out to both men’s surprise, had begun. Even so, Steve felt torn. Tony should have let him in - told him what he and Bruce were working on. Maybe if he had known…. No, no it wouldn’t have changed a thing and Steve knew that. There was nothing that could have changed things from culminating into the grand mess that they currently had on their hands.
I'm venting here cause I guess it feels safe. Any advice at all is appriciated.
Feels like Thor watched alot of CSI: Miami while he was visiting Jane....DArcy..we blame you for this.
Not happy, sorry. I will hurt you and you will be broken and soppy.
It seemed like too elegant of a term, it made him think of Natasha with her long slender limbs and deadly grace.
They had been wed for a little over three years when Sarah became ill.
“Well I’m an Omega just like Aunt Pepper, and Omegas have babies.”
“So, you two hanging out working on your needle point?” she said.
“I don't.” Bruce said moving to grip the taller man by his arms. “I thank God everyday that you're breathing and even if you don't want to hear me say I won't stop. We had something...we still can.”
“Aren’t you worried about…?” He gestured in front of himself with swishing hands.
As they stood in the now ruined snow field looking at the fallen troops (who were being assessed by Coulson’s team that arrived at the end of the battle) the team regroups with congratulations on their tongues.
The alphas face softened. “I don’t care about that ok? Why don’t we forget about that and chalk it up to it all being birdbrains fault in the cosmic scheme of things. I’m more than ok with that personally. You should have something other than chips though.”
He could feel all that and more now through testing his new limits with Extremis. Each time he uses it he feels euphoric. It's a high that he's never known before, better than any drink or drug that he's ever experimented with in his years of being a club kid and party boy. It's like sex, love, happiness and joy all experienced at once and when it's over...the world seems duller.
Tony ran the gin soaked remnants of that New Years over and over in his mind and with what bits he could string together – other than Maya being quite the athletic little thing in bed – which he didn't think had anything to do with a project, he was drawing a blank. “Little Foggy on that.”
“Trust me when I say I want to Steve. Not just for obvious reasons, you have no idea how difficult it is for me to have this conversation right now with out wanting to pin you down and lick fruit juice off ever inch of that hot Boy Scout body of yours until your toes curl.”
“Ok Loki, I want you to rest for now. If you need anything I won't be far, just let Jarvis know. Even if you just want to talk.”
“Tony…” Steve uttered an involuntary whimper of the name. That was all the AI needed.
“Tony…”
It was a difficult subject to broach but it needed to be done, so with a heavy heart Bruce sat down with Steve , Tony and Bucky. The former two there mostly for the benefit of the later. Natasha was currently with Loki and Pepper was with all of the kids with the help of Clint.
Aiden James Barnes was healthy and happy, and he had the biggest most beautiful green eyes his father had ever seen.
With a heavy sign, Barnes lifted his eyes to the horizon. If he made it back from this he'd do things right, he'd take the time and make sure everything was ok at home. Hell, he might even try that whole ' talking about your feelings ' thing the kids were so wild about these days.  See there, you can teach old dog new tricks.
His omega was leaning against the sink in the master bath, looking a little paler than usual. A distant voice wanted to point out how weak and pathetic this was, how could this be called 'Americas' first avenger'. Thankfully Tony trampled that down quickly. This was Steve not just anyone he could dismiss.
“Oh but he does Captain.” An accented voice called from about.
When thin little Steve stumbled out of the bathroom in that white satin slip his cheeks flushed from the booze and lips red with balm. The mumble of words in that little confession. “Please Bucky... I know I’m...I’m no dame but I... please Bucky...”  He should have said no but the whiskey said yes and then… well then he couldn’t stop because maybe he always wanted this. Maybe all those years he spent protecting Steve- all he really wanted was to pin the blonde down and take everything.
___________________________________
“What heat is sanitary? Come on cupcake, and look at this way maybe we can beat the enemy by using your intimidating crotch bulge. Cause I gatta say…. I’m feelin nervous and I like it.”  The visor snapped shut and he was gone.
“It’s been almost a year.” Bucky finally said walls crumbling. “Sometimes it’s like he’s there and other times he couldn’t be farther away. I wanna believe there‘s an end to this, one that wont.. Well, I know what everyone‘s worried about.”
When Tony watched a man die, he could feel it to. Part of him said ‘that will make it enough.’  ‘I will feel like I have done some justice.’ It did not do that at all.
When the eldest of Odin’s sons arrived, he was shocked to see his brother’s paramour in such a state. “Amora… what has happened? Whose child is this?”
“Language Steven,: Natasha snarked.
“I wouldn't be too offended buckaroo, Petey pie was super excited about watching the dogs poop at the park just last week so...” Tony quipped from where he was gathering up the kids backpacks.
For a split second, Tony thinks he's made a mistake, a single dreadful error and now this shit was going to kill him. Maybe his calculations had been wrong and holy hell if they were; he was beyond fucked. There was no way Barnes could fix this or even attempt to save him from the flood of nanotech rewriting his system.
Who is he now? What is he now?
From there things seemed to slow down, and for the first time in a long time Steve actually had time to just breath
“Maya how are you? I hope that this isn't about a 12-year-old who has my eyes. “ Tony joked.
“Just ask its fine. I know it's been a while that we've been together and a lot of couples don't wait more than a year if that.”
He did not though, because pride won over irritation. In some ways, he notices some softer looks from the lovely young mers at court. Not that he would ever fall for it again. His heart was empty, none of their kind words of encouragement meant a thing. He would give them a smile and move along. Loki kept away from the babe and lost himself traversing the corrals and trances. He could forget for hours at a time before having to return.
Tony looked up as the door cracked open the sound of the toilet flushing had been obnoxiously loud and Steve must have spent five minutes washing his hands. Tony figured he was stalling but chose not to say anything about it.
Time felt like it stood still at that one little utterance. "You forgive me? I killed you... Obviously not permanently yet even still, I have taken so much from you."
Tony did his best to shake off the hit. “Barnes? Where's he aAAAHH!” His words cut in half by a scream as searing pain tore through his right knee.
Maybe storming out of the main control deck was a bit much but honestly, he needed some air before he punched a hole through someone.
The alpha shrugged his shoulders and walked out of the hanger and into the small elevator that would lead up to the penthouse, Bruce following close behind. “I did what I had to do. Why are you disappointed?”
Next was the hyper behaviors, like when Loki cleaned the entire house with magic which would have been fine but then he worried about 'residual energy' and spend the hours then scrubbing with every cleaning product know to mankind. Bruce of course was then concerned about exposure to aforementioned chemicals. He shouldn't have said that out loud of course cause that opened a whole new can of worms. Loki was mid panic attack in a then frozen kitchen. Thankfully, Jane offered to come over and help comfort the poor man while Thor helped Bruce thaw out the counters and floors.
“He will be treated; if he can not be healed then the Lady Eir will find a way to ease his anger. Even if his mind is lost he need not be a danger.”
“Of course I know, that's why I'm here. Barnes...we talked and he pointed out a lot of shit to me that I should have been able to figure out in the first place.”
Bruce took off his specials rubbing at the lenses, “I suppose so, I have a few tests to run and documents to look over. Maybe tomorrow sometime before I have any definitive ideas on anything though.”
Peter lowered his head in shame. "I'm pregnant."
Jarvis said, flashing a hologram of the current date.
Loki leads the way to the sitting room, delicately placing the box of sweets on the coffee table. “Out doing some shopping.”
Tony rolled his eyes and clenched the gloves into the silty bottom. “How are we on power?”
“You’re doing splendid, already 7.5 centimeters”
Howard leaned forward watching the woman as she moved. He could appreciate beauty for what it was and it surprised him that a woman like her had been in such work. Then again, some of natures most deadly things were often the most beautiful. “I can tell you Miss Romanov, they are real. As real as you and me because I saw one. She saved my sons life only to drown him. She murdered my child like it was a a game for her. That is what beasts they are. No matter what you may have heard about me; I know they say I am mad, but it happened. I have spent 20 years of my life trying to find and destroy her.”
Today fortunately was not the later, the pair of young mako that the mer had snagged - were happier to chomp free of the ropes and escape than to turn on the would be sea bound rodeo wranglers. Perhaps it was because the sharks were small and still valued their own lives over teaching a lesson one of their older kind might impart.
“That's not what I want!” Tony found himself shouting at nothing. Screaming and pulling his hair. His panic somehow shaken by a sudden banging on the shop doors.
Maybe if the inventor had some sleepless nights this wouldn't have come as a shock. Maybe if he hadn't believed the lie he told to his son that morning when he said. "It's ok champ your pop will be back soon. He always comes back." Then this wouldn't ache the way it does now, it wouldn't dig and twist into his damaged heart and slowly ebb away the hope he had left in this world.
Darcy snorted. "Yeah whatever."
“An electro magnetic door lock doesn’t care if you call it a ‘dirty girl’ before you pop it!” Wilson said tossing a pillow at the giggling man-child across the room.
“They were worried about you, thought the serum might have gone ass over elbows cause I knocked you up.”
At this, the brutish sailor pounded his palm on the table with a brilliant laugh. “Ha! Can’t even get a half fish in bed with your empty pockets. That’s rich!”
Stark, years later say that that was the first night that opened the gate to the best sleep of his life. "Temprapedic doesn't have shit on a soldier sandwich." he'd laugh and watch his partners blush
She turned and for an instance a scowl sat her feature, quickly it was masked with a joyful grin. Loki felt his heart sink just a bit. Her smiles were never really for him. “Loki, how lovely to see you Darling.”
Wendy nodded and played with the zipper pull on her fathers sweatshirt.
The solider wasn’t listening and Tony could tell by the glassy look in the other man’s eyes. He knew because he knew how that felt. “J call out the correct date, send me mark 47 and mark 5 to come get this glass down now.”
It looked like everyone was still hunkered down post mission. The only greeting was from the towers AI as James was trying his best to carefully remove his mate from the car.
Somewhere long forgotten in Steve’s brain, purred at the direction. It always falls to him to lead, to be the mature one - The man with the plan. It was a chore, it wore on him constantly. That part of him that just wanted not to think, the part that clung to his orders as a soldier because it was the only shadow left of what he really needed. Yet even so, he never could let himself go…Steve was sure he had forgotten how. That if he ever was to hand over that control it would be the end of him. All of his life he spent trying to prove something. Just hearing those simple low words with in the inventor’s confident voice were a balm. They were an invitation with promise of safety, so much conveyed in such unassuming words.
“No, at least not that I recall and I think I would remember that.”
Steve sat in silence just staring at the old leather-bound journal, he remembered it. Maybe that made it worse because now he knew there was no way to deny its contents. Because he had seen this very book countless times before the ice.
“You thought there would be pretty nurses didn’t you?”
Then the sniffling started. Oh no…oh precious god of salted snacks no! Tony threw up his hands in surrender. “No… no it’s fine…Steve its fine.”
Tony sighed as he weaved through the skyscrapers on his way to the Tower. “Pep, we’ve been through this. I don’t take any risk I haven’t already thought out. True this was a minor miscalculation but I’m fine. The main question I have is how Steve is, and how far in the dog house am I with him?”
“Friend Steven! Hiemdall spoke of your return and my brother and I rushed to the aid of our Shield brothers!”
It was mission like any other, and maybe that is why it felt so shocking at first. On the other hand, maybe it was shocking because Tony Stark had a habit of always scraping by when he pulled something horribly reckless. The genius billionaire and his nine lives...finally ran out.
"Then what?"
They all knew this wasn’t looking good. Reinforcements had arrived in a flood as soon as the coms went down. Hydra had new cloaking tech and that was a huge oversight that they did not need right now. His team was doing their best to hold things down outside but it was clear the swarm of LMD and human agents was just a distraction from what was happening inside the warehouse. They didn't want the SHIELD team anywhere near the main attraction. Whether that was to tip the scales in their favor or not remained to be seen. Some how Phil didn't think so, Ada or 'Madam Hydra', was far too logical to think a few agents would make that much of a difference in aiding two Avengers. This felt less like a tactical decision and more like a scientific one.
After a spirited reading of  BINGO the dog, and watching a few episodes of Paw patrol with juice boxes and sandwiches, peter was ready for a nap...and so was Loki.  All in all he had to admit aside from the morning confusion the day had gone smoothly enough.  Peter was well behaved and didn't mind being left on the sofa for  moment or two during the omegas numerous bathroom breaks. Loki recalled ready quite a few parenting articles about small children following their parent or guardian everywhere. He pleased to be able to go to the lavatory in peace.
All the same, there was always that little voice in the back of their minds that recalled the mission reports from New Mexico. Loki wasn't some innocent little lamb. The omega had committed sins long before he fell into the hands of Thanos. How did any of them know what really went on in the fallen prince's head. Especially when he was so secretive?
The director stood pinching the bridge of his nose. "I don't know what daddy issues you need to work out or whatever this is, but trust me when I say there are other fish in the sea."
Thankfully, the nesting room on Steve’s floor had not been used for storage. It only took a few moments the get the room temperature right and bring in some blankets from the linen closet. Tony left the floor only once for a quick trip back up to the pent house for Steve’s favorite throw that was on his sofa. Most days the soldier would deny liking the plush grey blanket but there was no mistake in the way Steve would comb his fingertips ideally through the short fur when they watched a movie. Tony always found that cute.
It is these forgotten generations were evil men learn their trade and foster a future breed from fear. Walking husks of humanity, running on maliciousness. That was who Hydra was looking for, that is whom they found in Mallen. A hate-filled youth with an axe to grind after watching his parents die in a government shoot out over weapons violations.
Yet the Norns had other plans.
Pride was something all well and good when it's something you are raised with. When your heritage is something that is in your culture and woven into your daily life with traditions and stories. However, Loki had the opposite impression of his ancestry. Growing up sincerely believing he was just like the other Aesir, Loki was only exposed to a dark and tainted view point on a species that was far enough away to become something of a boogie man.
Seeing the one person in this world you love with every bit of yourself brought so low. Loki was huddled in the corner eyes glazed and covered in sweat and worse. It was as if he'd just...given up. Like something finally broke and he couldn't bear to put the pieces back together.
Natasha silently closed the file and neatly folded her hands atop the block lettering declaring TOP SECRET, “No I’m not, we still have a few weeks and everything is going well. I don’t have to watch her every hour of the day to make sure she’s fine.  She babysat Stark for years and managed not to die or be severely injured. I trust her and I trust the pack.”
Female Omega --- Lady parts !
“Miss Romanov gives her best, she is leaving now as she has a lunch date with Miss Potts, and Director Coulson has arrived with a clean up crew and is currently at the medical van with Mr. Barton.  Captain Rogers has not reported back.” The AI replied putting up a few surveillance images from various street and vest cameras of the team.
“I’m home!” Steve called cheerfully to what looked like an empty room. Though if one were to look closely they would see, it was not in fact empty.
So he looked.
“Yes Sir, I have also gone to the liberty to forward a video copy to Agent Coulson’s Mobile. He says thank you, and please suspend Agent Barton’s credit cards until his return.”
There was more to be said and yet, perhaps it was best unsaid. His father left alone to wring his hands and wonder where he’d gone wrong.
The Bones armor was blasting through the sky on the way back to the tower; Tony had gotten his systems back immediately and was already getting the run down from his AI.
Despite that, he also remembers the agreement they made when it came to the team, they would always consult each other like equals. No matter how much Tony liked to joke on the coms about Steve being 'the boss', If they ever had the luxury to brief before a mission they would both go over strategy and Steve always took what he had to say and considered his opinion. That was one thing that the alpha valued between them. Stark would have been more than happy to have that agreement when it came to everything but Steve was a traditionalist. His omega preferred to defer to him behind closed doors.
Peter lifted his head with a painfully serious and disappointed expression, “But I wanted a puppy.”
Steve finally gathered himself enough to dry off and return to bed calling “come in, loud enough for who ever may have been waiting outside.
“Aida.” Coulson said looking up as the play back fizzled out to static. “We need to tell Stark and Barnes what their up against.
This was going to take work, some days it would be all he could to pull himself up and keep going. The point was he could keep going, not for anyone else but himself. If he wanted to show who he was he could only do it himself. No one else was going to write his story.
"Lady Romanov...if i may."
Steve narrowed blue unamused eyes on the alpha, “No Tony, this is an optical illusion I’m not here at all. I’m on a mission punching robot Hitler in the nose.”
"pweety Lady." The child nuzzled his hair affectionately.
They had unchained him for a moment only to drag the broken solider to the center of the room only to be strung up like butchers meat. This interrogator wanted access to unmarred flesh and to try new toys. The latest had been some sort of electric prod with prongs on the end.  It made him jump and jolt with the voltage bit into his shredded flesh, lighting the frayed nerves on fire. At one point, the fiend had held the instrument in place until Steve was sure he could smell the flesh burning beneath the electrical impulse.
“I'm more worried about you right now Tones. What did you do?”
Loki thought of the happy child in the Polaroid that Kurt carried around. That little boy was different too and yet he was loved. Maybe, in Odin's round about way – him taking Loki from that frozen temple had been love too. He never had heard everything the All-father had to say about that, he'd only heard what he wanted to hear and held onto the rage. What if the way Kurt smiled and talked about his soon-to-be-son, was once how Odin had been? Loki closed his eyes to the passing trees giving way to buildings and signs; he thought back to the man he'd once called Father and was met with a distant image of being carried on the kings shoulders to the stables. Laughing and cheering as the usually stern man made faces at the horses and held him up with a treat to feed the great beasts.
Thank god, Agent hadn't showed Steve the resplendence of Power point. One can only imagine what post battle debriefs would be like then...something like a 8th grade book report presentation comes to mind and Tony will not be held responsible for his actions if that happens.
“Yeah…” Tony blew out a breath and took another sip of his coffee before speaking again. “The first time, we kept it quiet because they say you’re supposed to until well so many weeks or whatever.  It was 11 weeks before… we were still processing everything. The doc said that it just happens sometimes, there could have been something wrong and all that jargon about the body knowing what’s right. The second time it was only 9 and a half weeks, Steve just... He bottled it up and went back to work.  The third time …I’m shit with that emotional stuff, so I yeah I was fucking useless with what to say. We didn‘t really tell anyone, that last time. ”
“You what? No verbal knives left to throw at me before I go out there and risk my life? No more quipping little jabs to show how smart you are? Yeah, poor dumb James, poor dumb lab rat alpha who can't possibly grasp anything!” James snarled the bitter stink of aggression making his omega flinch and god that just made it worse.
“Tony…no.” Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “It’s not the babies; its…it’s me.”
Tony shrugged and rubbed his chin, his facial hair had gotten out of control.  “Just take it all off; it’ll be easier to start from scratch.”
The super soldier ran his fingers over the tan beaten surface, 70 years this book had survived. This book had seen more life than he had. Steve wondered if Howard knew about Bucky, if Peggy knew… then again Zola hadn’t come right out and said it but it was clear who was responsible for Howard and Maria’s deaths. Now here Steve sat in their son’s home thinking about their killer before reading about Howard’s concern for him.
“How can you touch me like this…? I am ruined…”
Steve knew what that was; the lobotomy was just coming in to practice when he was a teenager. “T-that’s not …What you mean is it?”
They all clapped like they were told. Clint leaning over to Barnes. "This is both stupid and awesome. Kinda wish I done this with my kids."
Of course this offer had been extended with all thoughts toward kindness and chivalry, it was however accepted as a direct challenge. He really should have seen that coming.
If Steve had to march through the mud and the mire of places like this, sleeping in fox holes while bombs whistled overhead.
He had always been a believer in the greater good, things like - don’t leave a man behind. He wasn’t going to leave Tony. Not again. Steve wasn’t going to watch another person he cared for fall and be forgotten. Left to become a monster.
“So you told me all this before that.. Sono.. …what ever you call it… cause what? So I wouldn’t be shocked if it was gone already?”  The words just spilled out and he was angry and now that they were out, he wanted to put them back. Wanted to just shut his mouth and take what they were saying at face value but he just couldn’t. The more it bounced around in his head the more agitated it made him. Steve Rogers had never given up in his life and it was down right offensive to think he would just bow out of something this important. This was a life, a living little person who didn’t even get to have a say in all this.
“Steve, honey…”
“Sir, it would appear that Captain Rogers Communication Link has been destroyed.” Jarvis informed as Iron man made his way through Hydras server room, tapping into the organizations files and downloading anything they could use.
Barton could have done this job, hell even Melinda or Daisy would have been qualified. Phil would be pushing it because while he was a great agent… James didn’t want to sit through more “look at these cute videos of the kids on my phone.”  For the next six days or be tricked into telling old war stories.
Suddenly, the younger man spoke up. “I may have some insight on that.” He said playing a clip of the woman calling herself Madam hydra. The digital memory played back the command memory.
Until they did, sitting in a room full of people all looking as lost as he was in their patient pajamas and slippers. Each set of wild eyes staring around at the others and thinking. 'you don't get it.'
His own voice from days long past echoes around in his shattered mind. “
Peggy tried to shush him and wound her armed around his shoulders, “If that’s what you saw…then I believe you.” It wasn’t exactly a lie, she believed Howard believed it. Maybe that was enough.
Stark jumped at the chance to rip Hydra a new one and not just in the way Iron Man always had before. This time it was personal and brutal, there wasn’t going to be any thing left.  Stark was a man on a mission, Pierce thought his Asset was ruthless? The Winter Solider had been little more than a drone; Fury had a one man kill squad - Iron Vengeance readily available.
A single chest buster to the back put Mallen on his knees.
Now he can't understand what took him so long, because this? This is perfection; this is that better living through science that his old man always talked about.
Tony had a knack for just ignoring things until the last moment or in the dead of night after a three or four day binge in the workshop. Looking back on questionable life choices when he physically hadn’t the strength to run away anymore. Nights spent laying on the ratty sofa in the corner while the bots milled around  trying to get his attention.
"I recognize it may not seem like much Bruce," Loki said with a shrug and soft smile as he showed the doctor out, "But what you have done means the world to me, to us. I thank you for that."
Even with that old fear clawing in his chest, Loki lifted his glistening green eyes to a man whom had always called him Brother. Even when Loki himself refused the honor.
Not that Tony would have cared much in the days that followed. Everything he loved was now resting six feet beneath the soil.
“Hey baby..I um..I don't think I'll be coming home anytime soon.”
Even after these last few years, Bucky still feels like a visitor in the halls of the tower. Still has that awkward stance when the team behaves like a family, as if he's almost intruding. There are times rare when his old friend becomes what he remembers, oddly enough, it's usually with Tony. It's funny how the quirky inventor can bring out that ease in everyone.
The next morning the gossip rags and internet feed were a buzz, “The return of Iron man?” “Has the Avenger come back for revenge?”
Barnes manages to drag himself against a wall of machinery and out of range of the superhuman war before him. Whatever Stark has done to himself has definitely leveled the playing field. Yet, James is worried if there won't be a bigger problem once the dusts settled. Extremis was something in a whole different ball park from the serum Erksine had created.
After all, love is a powerful motivator, and revenge. Well, that can keep a man awake for years.
That was enough, the sound of Steve breaking under his ministrations. That’s what Tony was looking for. He extended his tongue and began to encircle Steve’s length. Slithering his tongue down the underside of the shaft and worked his way back up to the head.  Tony looked up flattening his tongue and slowly bathing the hot flesh.
Yes, it was good to be away now. One day they would return and make better memories. Maybe they could redecorate and wash the slate clean?
Thor was the one who offered the best option. Steve didn’t want Bucky thrown in a prison or some mental ward, but it was clear he couldn’t just be let lose. There was some talk of cryostasis, seeing his friend frozen just sent Steve’s teeth on edge. He hated thinking of the cold.. Of freezing.
He issued and affirmative just a Loki’s hand darted out and grabbed his metal wrist.
“Steve…” Tony said pulling on his jeans and a shirt “would you …I mean I know you have your own floor but…would you want to stay here more?”
The mage laughed. “That's adorable. I'll be as kindly as possible dear. Not to worry.”
Tony stumbled back, the force of reality hitting him like a slap. “Christ...is that what I am...NO…I…” He was desperate to prove that Extremis was just a tool, just another upgrade. He was still himself. He was just the same as he always was only better; he was the man that Steve fell in love with. He was the man that carried around Peter and Wendy and tucked them in at night.
Quarantine mode on!
Tony acted to do this to Steve, knowing how this continued fight with the old adversary from his past constantly wore on Steve. “I get that but there's something you don't seem to get Steve.” He said moving forward, hands up in peace before pressing one of his palms to the omegas muscular abdomen. “This isn't just about hydra or your abilities Steve, there's a lot more at stake.”
Loki was usually so careful, so guarded about that sort of thing. Most of the staff here tried their best to do the same for the sake of not upsetting the children. Speaking of which, a pair of little alpha girls where looking up from their play and eyeing looking with concerned little faces.
When the dust settled, Sarah found herself a widow in the wake of war. Despite winning the war the lands of Marvellia had been ravaged by the conflict. With the country in the state as it was, Sarah retreated from the Duke’s estate to a small yet fine little farm house. Being a woman still in her youth it was expected for Sarah to take another husband, many of the men who served alongside Joseph had attempted to court her. However, Sarah had enough of soldiers and warfare. Mayhaps that pain would never leave her; even as she watched her baby sleep, she could see her fallen love yet live. There in the shape of Steven’s nose and the stormy blue of the child’s eyes. She quietly hoped and prayed that he would never take up a sword, as her heart could now bear to lose again.
One that wasn’t a battered old soldier who couldn’t even take a cold shower with out cringing. One that could give Tony all the things Steve couldn’t.
Tony wasn’t that lucky.
It was over, over and now there was this baby, Tony’s baby. Half way down the hall Stark fell against the wall and felt like he couldn’t breath. Steve was pregnant…with their child, a child he was probably never going to know. Because why on earth would anyone ever trust him with a child! Pepper wouldn’t even let him put a fish tank in the tower because she knew that she, or someone Tony hired, would end up caring for them.
He'd seen the numbers and done the research, if Killian was able to sort out Extremis even a 10
As much as he loved Steve he hd a long week and catching up on missed sleep with out tiny bodies sneaking into the covers at three am, sounded beautiful.
One could almost see the AI roll his electronic unseen eyes. “Shall I file it with your Sasha Grey collection Sir?”
Everyone watched as the next King and Queen sealed their vows. The ceremony of joining was not a long one, the coronation would follow and then the days of feasting.
So if this is a bad chapter..idk stop reading? I did what I could.
Tony was all right of course, he was sluggish and pitiful wanting his papa so baddy it matched the ache all over his small body. “It’s alright my little treasure. I am here…” Loki spoke softly holding the little pup as he told him stories and waited for the jellies poison to wear off.
“Sure, you can ask anything.”
The team always teased Cap on his eating habits, the man could put away enough for three people. Steve would always fluster and blame it on the serum. Bruce had once hypothesized that while the serum likely was the culprit for physical need for calories, more than likely the way Steve approached food had to do with how he grew up.
“She has a point,” Phil said as he joined them, “When Clint and I bonded…he already had a family, I was terrified but because those kids lost their mom and here I was so late in the game. Then I realized I had been ‘parenting’ all along. Every young agent that I ever handled even Tony back when the Starks died.  I know you think people won’t get it but if you think about you have been taking care of this team.”
All Barnes could do was hold on tighter and kiss away the tears. “ We'll figure it out baby, the Doc can help. I need you to take a breath for me baby. Just breath.” It worried him how frail Loki seemed, how he was shaking apart in his arms. “Let me carry it all baby, you've held on to this for to long.”
His whole world…was gone.
A long-range photo of the billionaire’s pain would later sell for 80grand. The paparazzi evidently never took a day off.
Tony rolled over and eyes his omega, he had been up way too long.  Long gone were the days of 72-hour invent-a-thons, now he was beat after your standard workday and chasing around two little ones. “Steve, if there’s a point to this I’d love to hear it babe. In 10 words or less if you can manage.”
Jane smiled thinking of how happy they must have been then.
Tony: What...no..um....its ..corse correction Jarvis!
“Almost but didn’t”
"We'll be home soon." he spoke softly but didn't dare get to close. Stark knew that would break what was left of the Captain's resolve.
Ringing out a washcloth and bathing the omegas brow once again, Bruce eyed the vital signs Jarvis had project for him. Loki wasn't well, it looked like this wasn't something as simple as heat sickness. This was something that had been going on under their nose for a while. The only stats he had on Loki where several years old, ones from just after the invasion. This information was doubtful at best to be seen as healthy, considering what Thor had told them. Even so, in comparison it was clear that Loki was worse off now than following the invasion.
The pair of them slipped into an empty lounge, Loki waved a hand at the door to ward anyone from entering. He had a feeling that this particular meeting might bring out emotions he would not care to display for just anyone.
“What is it?” Something didn’t sit right in Tony’s stomach all of a sudden. It was that feeling you get before you hear something you don’t want to. Or heard the phone ring in the middle of the night. That weird tingling sensation that makes you feel like you are going to vomit for no reason. A premonition, a sixth sense, if Tony wasn’t a man of science he would have believed in all those things. For now though, it was just ‘hinky’.
Somewhere in that awkward limbo of past and present he began to look at the one person who seemed to understand so keenly what it was like to have your head shaken and stirred. To become something so twisted you can’t even recognize yourself, to feel like its to late to be anything but the beast you’ve been molded to be.
When he came back up stairs, the omega was already napping lightly in the corner of the low ceiling room. Steve’s scent had mellowed and it made the alpha glow with pride. Tony slipped in and draped the throw over Steve’s exposed back, it was good he was resting now. When the first real heat wave hit it was likely to come on pretty strong.  Until then Tony had to calm himself down and wrap his head around this situation.
Loki felt his spine chill from the mention of the avenger, perhaps a lingering reminder of having it crack on the penthouse floor of Stark's Gilded Tower. “I see, how fortunate for your students.” he said turning away. “If you'll excuse me.”
“Never said you were now arms up or you walk out of here shirtless. I’m fine with option B.”  There wasn’t much room for argument and if Steve was being honest, he didn’t feel up to it right now.
