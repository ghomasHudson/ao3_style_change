“Sherlock and I had played deductions with the two of you after I returned from the Arena, after we all met. Sherlock had said she was one to get loud when she was angry, but I added when she’s livid she becomes dangerously quiet. Turns out that we were both correct.”
“Mister Watson; Mister Holmes! Good afternoon,” Snow called to them, and gestured to the two vacant seats in front of John and Mycroft – the only other chairs at the table. “Please, sit down.”
“They made it,” he sobbed into his boyfriend’s brother’s shoulder. “They fucking made it.”
He took a step forward, to check Sherlock’s temperature again, to kiss his forehead and place his hand on his cheek to remind him that he wasn’t leaving, but then Harry spoke.
Apparently, though, Gideon wasn’t quite done, turning around and sneering at Sherlock.
“Don’t think like that – just believe in Sherlock. He’s smart; he’ll get her out of this.”
“You know that you can still talk to me, right?” John asked, leaning to the side in order to get himself into Sherlock’s field of vision. “About anything.”
“What do you mean?” Sherlock asked.
The smoke rose around them, blocking their vision, but Mycroft kept Sherlock still until he believed the Peacekeepers couldn’t see them at all. Then, Mycroft pulled them to the right, and they raced out of the smoke cloud and down the hallway. As soon as they were out of the smoke, they let go of each other’s hands, both of them knowing how that could hinder their speeds.
In lieu of a reply, Sherlock fell backwards onto the nearest couch, placing his hands in front of his face, almost as if in prayer. But John knew Sherlock better than just about anyone – and it didn’t take a lot of knowledge about Sherlock to know that he definitely wasn’t praying. Sherlock was deep in thought, taking a trip to his mind palace.
He looked over at Sherlock to find him watching his shoes as they walked, obviously embarrassed, his now-empty hand twitching with the desire to hold John’s hand. John reached out and took it, and squeezed it reassuringly.
tomatoRenegade asks: [...] I was wondering if we’ll ever get to read anything from Mycroft’s time as [a] Tribute?
“But it’s true, though?” Mycroft asked, and John smiled.
“Tell me about it,” John agreed, and then he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned his head and found Mycroft. “Hey.”
Instead of thinking about it, he started sprinting.
“So...to say the least, I’m struggling. It feels like it happened years ago, but it feels like it’s still happening, now, too. And I’m struggling. I’m struggling to talk about it, and I’m struggling to move on...but I am. It’s hard, of course – it’s hard to look my boyfriend in the eye, sometimes...and sometimes when I kiss him, my mind slips back and I’m thinking of Magnussen and it hurts because Sherlock got out of the Arena and his brother had died and I need to be there for him but I can’t even handle my own problems so how am I supposed to help him past his?” He paused for a moment, and his need for air made him realize how he had just spoken so much and so quickly that he ran out of breath. He took a deep breath, and went on. “But...he stays with me. Even when it’s difficult, even when we have no idea what to say to each other, he stays with me. And, together, we’re moving on. We’re getting through it – through everything – the grief, the loss, both of our Games, the assault, the addiction, all of it – we’re getting through it and we’re moving on, together.
Dean then looked down at his shoes, and Sherlock knew that he was trying to figure out where to start. He stayed quiet for a long, long, time – for at least five minutes that felt like it had stretched into years – and then, finally, he spoke:
Remembering the constant ache in his shoulder for what it was, Sherlock stopped and nearly ripped the case apart, only to find….
There was a moment as Caesar tried to spin Louise’s answer into a positive. “Well, it’s a great honor, especially if –”
“There’s no need to rush this conversation – we have time,” Hannibal replied, stepping forward.  “Tell me, do they know of our little secret?”
“I don’t know – wherever Mycroft went, I suppose.”
“It’s good to have someone to sit next to,” Mycroft leaned over and muttered once everyone turned from him, and suddenly John thought back to what Sherlock had said the last time Mycroft said something was “good”:
And Sherlock knew exactly what that felt like. In fact, for a moment, he was brought back to that time – where, for almost eight years straight, Sherlock woke up every day and knew that his love for his best friend was unrequited, and would always be unrequited, because John would never be attracted to Sherlock. But Sherlock had been able to finally tell John – Dean would never be able to say the words.
This is VERY HEAVILY inspired by (and named after) the song "On The Floor" by Perfume Genius (please listen to it if you haven't heard of it); I heard it and instantly thought of Sherlock fighting his feelings for John, and I instantly created a scene around it. Of course, I was writing Advantage at this point, and I couldn't exactly put this sequence into it, at least not from Sherlock's point of view. So, I tweaked it a little bit, adding Mycroft to the scene (the exchange at the end of this you will recognize from the beginning of chapter 15 of Advantage (Affections)), but obviously Mycroft wouldn't know the context like Sherlock would.
“Serlock?” he asked, and Sherlock looked over at him.
And, all things considered he was, more or less, okay. The three of them – John, Sherlock, and Harry – were, at the very least, learning how to be okay. They all had their bad days – quiet days, where Harry would lock herself in her room, Sherlock would stare at one spot on the floor (or, when wintertime started, out the window at the snow) for hours on end, lost in a trance, and John would avoid moving about the house so he wouldn’t have to use his cane. There were times where they all jumped at the slightest noise or touch, there were foggy mornings where they all refused to leave the house, there were days where they cried for seemingly no reason at all, and there were always nights where they woke up shaking or screaming or sweating from nightmares, but they had found their routines, and they were living through them.
“It’s not my job to keep tabs on him,” Sherlock replied, though he’d be lying if he wasn’t a small bit worried about his brother, as well.
“Whose bright idea was it to do something as idiotic as
He stood in front of Sherlock, protecting him from the paparazzi’s words and eyes and cameras, and he began to yell at them.
“What I’m trying to get at is there have been some...” he looked around the room, searching for the words. John knew where this was going – the one place he didn’t really want the conversation going that night. “...extremely false rumors that have been going around –”
He was Sherlock Holmes, for fuck’s sake. This is what he had to do. He was a target, and targets walk face-first into danger and wait to be attacked – he
Music for this chapter:
– everyone will read it – everyone will have the thought in their head – the thought that Sherlock is –” he cut himself off, trying to remind himself that Sherlock was in the room, and he turned to Dean and Alexander again. “They’re not right – they’re
“Newspaper?” he repeated, accusing, and Dean shrugged.
think I’m weird?” Sherlock asked, despite himself.
“Tell me, William, did your heart race when you murdered Charles Augustus?” he asked in lieu of answering. “When you murdered my brother?” he went on, giving his identity away.
If Sherlock Holmes didn’t hate crows before, he certainly did now.
“Right, of course you did.” There was a silence as Sherlock stared at John, and John looked everywhere except for at Sherlock. “Thank you,” he said finally. “For telling him to come see me. I...couldn’t have done it without him.”
“Time,” John gasped, and then tried speaking conversationally – calmly, trying to deflect any of Snow’s suspicion. “I’ll do it. I just...need some time to think about this – to choose. Can you – could you give me time? Please?”
But, of course, that did not happen. The entire house stood still, apart from the five people who had just entered through the front door, just as it had for the last three weeks. No sound could be heard – no movement from upstairs, no water running in the kitchen, nothing – other than the sounds of their own breathing. Wait, that wasn’t all – there was the quiet sound of sniffling – someone was crying –
MYCROFT HOLMES was a very important man. He had a tower! And also ALL OF THE BRITISH GOVERMENT UNDER HIS PINKY FINGER
Sherlock, John, and Harry make a decision; Dean and Louise make their exit; Sherlock and John discuss Mycroft's relationship with Dean and their relationship with each other.
“Any ideas?” he asked as gently as he could, while still trying to make her aware of his need for her response to put them in the right direction.
“I feel betrayed,” John began, and Caesar’s face fell a fraction, as if to ask,
“Go on, Twelve,” she ordered, but Sherlock continued walking. When he was five steps away from Archie, he kneeled down, getting to his level like Mycroft used to do when he was a child.
“You’re lying. You know exactly where you are.”
going to talk about this.
“VICTORY TOUR!” she sang, and Sherlock had already decided that he had had enough peppiness for one day.
Sherlock obeyed, holding onto his free hand, and though Sherlock was itching to keep running – to run and find John and Harry – to run until the rebellion was over and then keep running after that – Mycroft kept him rooted to the spot.
Did he even want to tell him this? He could see himself doing it, like a third party watching from above, lying in the darkened bedroom in the late hours of the night, talking to his boyfriend about his dead brother and the sexual relationship he had with his best friend, and it all seemed so…final. Like if he kept from having the conversation from John there in that context, maybe it wouldn’t put the final nail into Mycroft’s coffin. Except it wouldn’t be the final nail – reading the letter from Mycroft would be.
“Mm-hm,” Harry replied, the spoon in her mouth as she reached beside her for a second one and extending it to him.
BYE <3
They wouldn’t –
“Mycroft no.” Sherlock agreed.
And now, almost exactly nine years from that day, Mycroft Holmes was dead.

he could never want Sherlock, so why did
“Ground me,” John pleaded. “I don’t know where I am, and I need you to ground me. Please, Sherlock.”
After an eternity, Dean took to the stage again, and the audience went silent.
They took a different way to get back to the staging area, and the only reason why Sherlock knew that was because and they didn’t encounter his brother’s body.
Worn Out Blues by Gotye
“Thank you,” Sherlock said quietly.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied immediately. “It’ll help, talking with people who have been through the same thing you have. I think it’ll help in ways that I can’t.”
“Sherlock –” Louise tried to argue, but Sherlock shook his head.
“Hey, Archie – can Harry hang out with us?”
“The way I feel about you has not changed, and I don’t think it ever will,” Sherlock said after a few moments.
“What?” he mumbled, turning his head Sherlock’s way, his voice slightly slurred by his body slowly shutting down to sleep just to be used again. “Who did what, now?”
“Oh. Can I go on your shoulders, Daddy?” Hamish asked, and Sherlock let go of his hand, only to scoop him up and set him upon his shoulders, putting him directly in front of the marble face of Mycroft Holmes. “Hi, Uncle Myc,” he said happily, and planted a kiss on the statue’s nose.
But this isn't the end! I'm writing a piece on Mycroft's Games and I have a SAD TIMES AU so it's not all over yet. I'll also be doing a bunch of behind the scenes stuff!
“The specifics of the rumors of her disappearance are all different, as the specifics of most stories are after they’ve been repeated various times through word of mouth, but they all shared the same similarity, and that consistency was where the finger was pointed. No matter who told the story, I was the person blamed for my sister’s disappearance. I asked for this audience so that I may, finally, address those rumors.”
“Now look at your watch. What time is it?” John asked, letting go of Sherlock’s face so he could move his head. He brought his wrist up to his face, letting his eyes finally adjust to the darkness as he consulted his watch.
“It’s great to finally meet you. Most of the newest victors feel comfortable talking to the previous year’s victor about mentoring duties and such; for you, that’s me. I know you’ve got Mycroft, but just in case you can’t find him, you know who to ask for.”
Sherlock gave Harry the closest thing he could to a chuckle he could manage: a sharp exhale through his nose as he swallowed down the lump growing in his throat.
He shook his head, trying to focus –
“Just – could you just – would you just say the word ‘Norbury’ to me, would you? Please?”
John.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry smirked, pushing Sherlock a bit – the first playful, Harry-like thing she had done since arriving in the Capitol. “I’m fine. Really. Thanks again, for getting me out of there.”
“He’s alive,” John whispered. “Oh my god he’s alive.”
And then, he could feel John’s hands on his body again. Soft but firm, reassuring, knowing what they were doing, able to name exactly what part of Sherlock’s body they were touching –
“Don’t leave me alone, Sherlock, please –”
As he said these last words, he glanced up at Sherlock, and it took everything within him to hold his gaze. The look in his eyes wasn’t accidental –
“Octavia, no,” the first woman – Venia – said. “It’s going.”
A wave of anxiety went through him, just like it had the night before the Games, backstage before the interviews.
Harry’s eyes softened, reaching out and holding Sherlock’s hand.
And Sherlock could tell simply by the man’s gait that he had no intention of going easy on John Watson.
Sherlock sat up, gasping, opening his eyes to find Harry Watson, Harriet Catherine Watson, his best friend, pulling her red bag around Magnussen’s neck, pulling it back like a noose.
He wandered into his room – it felt like wandering, even though he had been within these walls for almost two weeks straight – and was in no way surprised when he found a white box on his bed, marked MORPHLING in bold, black letters. In fact, he had asked for them, nearly ten minutes before.
“John –”
Closer - The Tiny (the song that Sherlock and John dance to)
John’s heart sank. It wasn’t just Johnlock – Harry was there, too. Everyone seemed to be forgetting that – Harry was there; she had been this whole time. Sure, Sherlock was the one they knew, and Sherlock was the one that they all assumed was having sex with John every night, but didn’t they know there were different kinds of love? Didn’t they know that John loved his sister as much as he did Sherlock, only in different ways?
, was published. Given who John was, Panem nearly devoured the book, and eagerly awaited for John H. Watson to write again. Of course, John did write again, showing up a few years later with
“You act like Harry and I haven’t been alone in this house together for more than a couple of nights while you and Mycroft were…out,” Sherlock cut him off, a sliver of a smile appearing on his face at the beginning of the sentence just for it to fade at the mention of his brother. “We can take care of ourselves,” he went on, tone completely serious. “Please, go to a meeting, just one. See what happens.”
“John...this is very important, and I need you to respond. You don’t need to go into detail; a simple yes or no will do.” He opened his eyes, and spoke so clearly it made John’s ears burn. “Did Charles Augustus Magnussen touch you inappropriately?” Mycroft asked, and John nodded.
“I’m glad you found me,” she said, instantly throwing her arms around Sherlock once he was close enough, and he returned the gesture. “I’ve been asking for you but no one’s been telling me anything,” she went on once they parted.
“Weird, isn’t it?” John asked, letting out a single breath of semi-laughter that made Sherlock’s throat close up. “Ten years. Being here.”
A hand grasped his shoulder, and John flinched, almost crying out, only to find that Mycroft was attached to the hand.
“So I did. John Watson would never sign the necessary papers. He would let me pass in my own time, wanting for me to wrongfully pay for what my brother did to him all those years ago. And I know that President Bainbridge, upon hearing of my request, would immediately run to you and John Watson, insisting upon making the subject of my death something to be voted upon amongst the three of you, giving each of you a chance to influence the others. Given how much you value your husband’s opinion, I imagine you would go along with his decision. But you, on your own…I can’t pin you down, Will. I would hope that you would show me mercy and sign the forms, but honestly I am unsure what your answer would be, without John Watson there to sway you. Either way, I wanted to speak to you one last time before I leave this world, Will. And, if you are willing to sign the consent form, I wanted to invite you to watch.”
John looked down at his hands in his lap. “I wish I could have met them.”
“Interesting,” Sherlock mused. “And the other question?”
St. Jude - Florence + the Machine, for Sherlock and Harry
“You heard him; he’s alive. Put him back – he’s still in the Games,” she ordered.
For some reason I always think of Uma Thurman by Fall Out Boy when Mycroft goes into National Importance Mode and it's been like that since......2013? 2014? One of those.
“Your incessant rambling, for one –” Mycroft replied.
“End of the line,” Seneca said, a smile in his voice, and Sherlock closed his eyes –
After John came back, the two were closer than they ever had been. In fact, since John had become Sherlock’s boyfriend, Harry seemed to fill John’s discarded role – the two of them became best friends. But being best friends with Harry was entirely different from being best friends with John. For one thing, Harry was much more physical in her affections, giving hugs and playfully punching Sherlock in the shoulder – Sherlock and John were never this touchy with each other; becoming boyfriends opened up that barrier between them. It must’ve been obvious that Sherlock wasn’t sure what to do with himself when it came to Harry’s displays of affection, and so she started the high-fives. Suddenly, it seemed like every time they walked by each other she’d put her hand out, and Sherlock’s hand would meet hers halfway. It became their secret way of saying that they saw and acknowledged each other, and now she expected one now, right in front of Hannibal Lecter Magnussen.
– everyone here had laid themselves out for everyone to see, and they all saw Sherlock as a person enough to support him as he did the same. Everyone in this room was human – so unbelievably human – that Sherlock couldn’t just ignore them like he could the people of the Capitol that normally watched him onstage.
Dean would’ve told him, right? He had to have told him –
“How did
“I couldn’t either; I kept thinking to myself, ‘
Even though Sherlock had found out what he had been thinking about that night specifically eight days later – in the Arena.
“TO JOHN WATSON”
“Shouldn’t you be in school?” Sherlock asked, his voice hoarse.
“There will probably be at least one guard on duty, if this is where they’re holding John,” Lavinia informed Mycroft, and he rolled up his sleeves.
“A moment,” he muttered in response, and exited the room. He strode down the now-empty cell-filled hallway, and back to the laboratory. He walked straight to the Peacekeeper, and crouched in front of him, grabbing him by the collar of his uniform, getting in his face.
“What was that?” he asked, even though John was sure he had spoken loud and clear. He moved around his desk, sitting John down in one of his chairs and crouching before him. “What did you say? Because if you said what I think you just said –”
And then the last piece of Snow’s final plan was put into place in John’s mind: that night, up upon Caesar’s stage, when John was given the ultimatum to choose between his sister and his boyfriend, if John had refused to choose, or if John had chosen to kill Harry and keep Sherlock alive, Snow would’ve killed both Harry and Sherlock. Not only that, but Claudius Templesmith would make the call to kill John’s parents, leaving John almost completely alone. But now John knew that, as an added bonus, the bread shop was to be bombed, as well, destroying the one place that meant more to the Johnlock story than even the iris meadow (seeing as the Capitol had already destroyed that place enough, in John’s mind). And so, when John failed to make a decision and Mycroft shot President Snow, Claudius made the call, ordering for not only the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Watson, but also to release the bomb to destroy the bakery.
“Yes you are,” Hannibal agreed, and they shook hands once more, and parted ways, Mycroft pulling John along with him.
Seeing the Morphling there, free for him to use, was like what he imagined seeing an ex-lover would be like; one that he no longer knew, or shared anything in common with, anymore, but he still kept coming back to, anyway.
“Mycroft!” Sherlock gasped, and took a step toward him –
Sherlock yelled upon seeing Jim Moriarty's face.
“I don’t think so,” Sherlock replied, and Mycroft nodded.
Suddenly, there was a knock on his door, and before Sherlock even had time to react, his door opened, revealing Mycroft, in his pajamas, holding a candle.
“Eight,” Sherlock confirmed, nodding.
– Mr. Lankford has been asking
Please don't be shy to follow or message me; I love hearing from you guys and thanks for coming with me on this journey (that never seems to end but is almost over!)
He ran down the steps of the porch, into the dark and the rain, and out of the Victor’s Village. He did not remember jumping District’s 12 fence, but he knew he had when the streets around him turned into the forest floor. He ran until he reached the bottom of a steep hill, and realized where he was. He was in the meadow –
“Mycroft! What’s happened?” she asked, signing as fast as she could.
“I haven’t stopped thinking about you since the Quell’s announcement,” Clara spoke quickly, taking a couple steps toward Harry. “I was a bitch.”
“He did
“Well, apparently he didn’t need to try to put anything in my drink – all he needed for me was a syringe.”
“I am, indeed.”
“You walk around in a
If you were looking to read other things by me, I just posted a whole bunch of fics (mostly crack fics) that I wrote when I was between the ages of 16 and 21. There are three in particular that have MULTIPLE CHAPTERS (all of them Harry Potter, 2/3 of which are crack fics) that I'm going to post like every other Saturday, so if you WANTED to read something of mine while you waited for me to get my Constantly shit together, you can read those fics and look at what went on in my mind between 7 and almost 3 years ago! Because, you know. That's always interesting. ESPECIALLY when its the crack fics....
And that’s when he saw the destroyed buildings. Luckily, it was only a few buildings – just a few shops nearby the Justice Building – a building that John had expected to be completely destroyed, but seemed to be completely untouched. But there was one building that was completely destroyed – one big gaping hole where a building used to stand, now completely reduced to rubble, while the ones surrounding it – the two on either side of the hole and the three behind those buildings – those were also partially ruined, with broken-down walls and fire marks climbing up the bricks.
He wasn’t breathing.
“Did Sherlock do that?” Octavia asked.
After the first month, sometime at the end of August, when the phone rang and Sherlock picked it up, thinking it was Dean, he ended up passing the phone to John.
“Sherlock –” Dean warned.
snapchat: saraherbie
“I’m going to be late,” he muttered, looking back at John, and he could see the disappointment in his husband’s eyes. “I won’t take long, I promise – Dean probably just wants to go over his address for tonight with me.”
Being there was really weird for John, too.

“I know you,” he breathed. “How? How do I know you?”
And so, they began to make their way through the crowd of people – the people they grew up with but never really knew – and began the trek back to the houses that were no longer homes, to the victor’s village.
As soon as they were out of sight, vanishing in the crowd of Capitol citizens who had also decided to make an appearance at the park that day, Sherlock turned around, looking up at the statue of Mycroft Holmes.
“It’s fine,” he mumbled, and John pursed his lips and let Sherlock pull him onto the elevator.
The teachers who had named Mycroft as their “best student;” the same ones who wrote notes to him and pinned them to Sherlock’s shirt when he had misbehaved in class, after “Mr. and Mrs. Holmes” and just “Mrs. Holmes” were no longer acceptable options to address the notes to.
“No,” Sherlock insisted. “Absolutely not.”
Sherlock’s heart was pounding in his ears as he watched her grab onto his name, pull her hand out of the bowl, and open the slip of paper.

me?” Sherlock asked.
“Yeah. I’m going to the fourth floor, right?”
his mind chanted.
“Sherlock will find his way back to you,” Mycroft spoke in a voice just above a whisper. “He’ll find his way to the both of us. You just have to believe in him, John. Right to the final second. Will you believe in Sherlock, John?” Mycroft asked, and John nodded, refusing to look away from Mycroft’s eyes.
He glanced through the audience – through the thirty-two past victors before him – wanting to scan through and deduce what each person would ask, but his mind was too preoccupied trying to keep himself from spilling his deepest secrets unprompted.
“Hannibal Magnussen’s Hunger Games. Come.” He patted the sofa cushion next to him. “Sit.”
The two Peacekeepers nodded, stepped aside, and opened the double doors, allowing for Mycroft and John to pass.
“We missed you last night,” Alexander added.
“What the hell –?!”
One president.
Kingdom of Welcome Addiction by IAMX (for Sherlock slowly becoming more and more addicted to morphling)
“What would they think about us?” John asked. “About me? About me and Sherlock?”
If John found out what he was doing, it would kill him, or
“You know this?” Harry asked.
“Errands,” Harry answered, and Sherlock immediately knew what she would say next: “John told me everything.”
“In your Hunger Games specifically, is there anyone who you killed that you feel guilty about, even now?”
“I was just thinking, back when I was little, our teachers would warns us about tracker jackers... They always warned us not to get caught in a swarm because we wouldn’t survive...”
Mycroft waved back, and then turned to Hannibal.
John nodded, glancing back and forth between his boyfriend and the meadow below them.
Sherlock turned nineteen in January (five months, twenty-three days, three hours, fifty-five minutes, and twenty-three seconds after Mycroft’s death), and John and Harry had gotten together with Dean to throw a small get-together for him to celebrate, inviting nearly all of the survivors of the from the Mockingjay Alliance that Sherlock knew, plus a few others like Mrs. Hudson, who had not been part of the Alliance but had consequently joined it the moment she fought against Peacekeepers during the Battle for Panem, and John’s old prep team (including Octavia, who took the time to formally apologize to Sherlock and John for making lewd comments about their sex lives this time last year).
“He didn’t do anything
“He won’t – at least, he won’t if he wants to win. If he goes after you first there’s a chance that I’ll swoop in and save you – if he kills me first it’ll make you an easy target – not because I don’t think you’re able to kick his ass but considering that you’re inhaling the fear gas and fighting him while you’re reacting to my death you’d be off your game. Now, if you see anything, don’t attack it – it could very easily be me or a Ravenstag and you won’t even know. If it’s not real, it can’t touch you, just remember that. But if something happens – if something goes wrong – if he finds you before I can find him, just scream – call my name, and I’ll come back.”
“Sherlock?” she called back, somewhere he couldn’t see. He quickly gathered his stuff and ran to the sound of her voice, finding her in a clearing just out of his line of vision.
“Yeah?”
“This ‘shaky hand’ as you so eloquently put it is just the tip of the iceberg, Will. This illness will take my body and mind more and more, until I am just a shell of the man I used to be, and when I am just a body, unable to move or speak or think, I will drown in my own saliva, covered in ulcers and laying in my own filth. Could you imagine that, Will? Someone like me reduced to something like that? I simply can’t have it, but the tremors started about two weeks ago, and my speech is already beginning to slur.”
The man nodded, taking the paper and reading it over.
involved, as well! They’re not just separating you and Sherlock for a televised reunion; they’re separating you and your sister for no reason – that’s not right.”
“You should get back; John and Harry are undoubtedly waiting for you. And I’ll see what I can do about the broadcast tomorrow.”
“Fetch John Watson from the mentors’ booth, straight away,” he ordered, and then turned back to Sherlock as the Avox walked away.
“And you think your brother will create that breeze?” John asked, and Hannibal chuckled.
Sherlock looked to John, as if he had the answers, and John looked to Antonia and replied for him.
Sherlock squeezed his hand in return, and they, followed by Antonia and Alexander, made their way to the reuniting girls, and it was only when they were close enough did John realize that Louise’s left eye was swollen shut.
“Well, we did.”
Hannibal Lecter Magnussen grinned widely, as if seeing an old friend.
“Any questions?” he asked, and there was a few, but Sherlock had checked out, no longer caring.
John then cut in front of Mycroft, turning and facing him, grabbing his arms.
So, despite John’s desire to spend the day at least twelve floors above the City Circle at all times, he got dressed and made the descent with Mycroft down to the Circle, where all of Mycroft's friends were waiting.
“Of course I am, Nana,” he said, smiling pleasantly down at her.
Laughter Lines - Bastille (for John and Harry's goodbyes)
Sherlock smiled up at John, tears springing to his eyes once more. He then glanced down at the letter and, before he could really think about it, offered it to John.
John glanced behind him, making sure Harry was still with them – in her dress that matched her hair, barefoot, and weeping quietly as she ran behind them.
“Me, too,” he replied, and then they began walking again, catching up to their friends.
“I’m sorry,” he signed.
known Sally and Philip. And, since he had allied himself with them, he had to say a few words to honor them. Yes, John thought as he was presented with a bouquet of flowers and a plaque for his victory, tomorrow was going to be significantly harder.
*If you haven't read Hungerlock yet, please stop reading. Just know this is an A+ prime time to read Hungerlock* ANYWAY.
As soon as they got onto the train, Sherlock’s façade went back down, realizing that he would be trapped on a train with the peppiest person in all of Panem, his older brother, six of the most annoying prep team members he’s ever met, and some unknown amount of Peacekeepers who he’d
So I've had a pretty rough couple of months - I lost my job in the first week of October; moved house, had one of our cats pass away, and lost practically all of my winter clothes in the first week of November, come to find out that all of our Christmas decorations (apart from a little tree and My Personal Ornaments that I kept separated from the rest of the Ornaments because they're MINE and I BOUGHT THEM with MY OWN MONEY or they were GIFTED TO ME and ME ALONE) were also lost in the move in December, and basically throw in some trouble with Feelings and unrequited shit and basically the last three months have put me in a really bad place, mentally.
So. Work's been difficult and it's going to be difficult for the next few weeks. So I'm posting this chapter, and then the next chapter will be arriving in about three weeks, when work will (hopefully) be less difficult.
“I’d rather not,” he said, and Sherlock rolled his eyes and crossed his arms – like a child in the beginning stages of a tantrum.
, Sherlock! We’re your
His name was Sherlock Holmes. He was eighteen years old.
“No one in the Arena had the last name of Packard.”
“Goodnight, Sherlock,” Mycroft said quietly, and Sherlock didn’t look up.
He had killed Robert – Clover’s brother – first – it was quick, for he was lying on top of the tracker jacker nest, and Sherlock knew that all he had to do was keep him from getting up, and the tracker jackers would do the rest.
“Please,” John begged.
There were no such things as ghosts –
“John?” Mycroft asked, gently. “What did he do?”
“Same here,” she agreed, and it was then Dean started calling everyone’s attention back to him from upon the stage – so the questioning of Hannibal Lecter Magnussen could begin.
“We’ll find it,” Sherlock corrected him as he sat on the bed.
“You’re going to have to learn to, either way,” Sherlock mumbled back, and yet he was the one who reached out and held John’s hand. “I’m sorry.”
“Come on,” she said, putting her hand out for him to take. “Let’s get out of this maze.”
“That fucker,” Harry muttered.
Kym Duval, 35, District 10.
“Well, there were still some people who wanted...relations with me. But to everyone’s shock and dismay, shortly after I was assigned to them, they’d go back to President Snow denying they had ever requested me.”
“I’ve never heard Mycroft raise his voice like that, before,” Harry said quietly, breaking the quiet.
There had been a night, in the penthouse, where Mycroft and John (Mentors through and through) stayed up late into the night watching the last Quarter Quell – Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s Games. Sherlock had woken up and made a trip to the bathroom while they were discussing how monstrous Hannibal and Charles Augustus were, which sparked Sherlock’s curiosity. The following night, after everyone had fallen asleep, Sherlock went and found the disc (which hadn’t been too hard to find) and he took the disc into his room, and watched the last Quarter Quell. He watched Will Graham die, watched Hannibal Magnussen eat his victims and win the Games –
“Thank you, congratulations to you, as well,” Mycroft replied, merely glancing at the screen as he spoke to check in on Harry – just in time to see her try to take an arrow to one of the crows, but it dodged out of the way.
“Gregory Lestrade came to me during our training sessions, and took me under his wing. He introduced me to Sally Donovan and Philip Lestrade –”
Though the day had been an eventful one, a lot of people – mentors, sponsors, and Capitol citizens alike – went home and went to bed, and soon John looked around to find that there was a sudden lack of crowds. Across the Circle, John could see a small building and three doors – one marked for women, one marked for men, and a third marked for the handicapped – and John realized how much he had gotten lost in the excitement of the day, and how much he needed to use the lavatories.
“I don’t. Like. Elevators. They make me sick,” he admitted, just a pinch louder.
“I was hurting –” Sherlock tried to explain, but Harry shouted over him, tears beginning to flow from her cheeks.
and all you would’ve needed to do was say a
They stood in silence for a moment, unable to resist the words from sinking in.
“Don’t ask me that.”
“Don’t talk to her like that; she’s as old as you are,” he said, and turned to Lavinia. “The truth is you’re not needed here, anymore. You were never needed here. The point of the Avoxes was just to keep everyone from rebelling against the Capitol. They never
“Apparently, Dean and Mycroft had sex,” Sherlock repeated, before finally turning his head to look at John’s shocked face in the dark. “One time, years ago. When I was about to turn twelve, actually.”
"That's probably why, then."
“You remember that girl from District Nine?” she asked, cutting him off. “The one Mycroft showed us, back when we didn’t know who was going in – not Louise Neal but the other one – Amanda Hawkins? Remember how her hair snarled in the branches and she almost got killed because of that? I don’t want to be that girl – if I’m going to lose, it’s not going to be because of my hair. Do you have anything to cut this with?” she asked, taking a lock of her hair between her two fingers and scrutinizing it.
This was brand new territory for Sherlock – the boy who had never been afraid, had never once panicked, the boy who always had a plan – they had all vanished from within him, leaving a stranger behind. He had met this stranger only once before, years and years ago, right before Sherlock’s twelfth birthday, back when he was afraid of getting reaped into the Hunger Games. But the fear was never this pronounced – back then, it was just a wave of anxiety that loomed over him. This fear felt as if the wave had finally crashed down upon him, and he was drowning in it.
“Didn’t want to be a burden,” Sherlock completed John’s sentence.
He imagined he was a little sloppy, and it probably definitely showed how much knowledge he lacked on the subject, but John didn’t seem to mind that, at all. Or, at the very least, he was just so focused on the fact that it was actually happening that he really didn’t care how bad Sherlock was at it, as long as Sherlock didn’t do something totally stupid, (like bite John, for instance; but Sherlock had the common sense to know not to do that). But Sherlock was intending upon improving – on learning what it was that John liked and making sure he did just that.
Despite the fact that Mycroft would've ensured that Charles Augustus Magnussen was killed before he would allow himself to die, there isn't much to say about this timeline:
Finn Jacobs, 29, District 4.
“I’ll see you at the interview, Mister Holmes!” Snow called out from behind him, and that only made Mycroft even more determined.
Next came Louise:
I could really use some friends lol
“I think he just convinced her to exchange those horses’ spots in the lineup,” Sherlock said.
Just like his tongue had invaded John’s mouth just days ago –
“My poker face.”
another year,” Sherlock corrected him. “We’ve still got about five and a half hours.”
As the team was driven (in one of the Capitol’s cars) to the train station, Sherlock held onto John’s gloved hand, looking out the window.
“Of course,” Mycroft replied, but John knew that he was far from it. That, just like when Harry told him of how kind Sherlock had been to Archie Neal in the training room, seeing how much hearing Mycroft call Sherlock’s name in agony affected his brother touched Mycroft’s once-frozen heart.
HELP HIM
“You didn’t have to!” Clover signed in reply, her face beet red as they both laughed.
In Magnussen’s original death scene, Sherlock cuts off Magnussen’s penis and shoves it in Magnussen’s mouth. (I guess I was really angry that day?). That will be published at some point.
“You don't have to – I
“Ugh. Sentiment,” he muttered, and John half smiled, chuckling despite how badly Sherlock knew he also wanted to cry.
And suddenly, Sherlock was at battle with himself – fighting the urge to rip open the envelope and devour every word that Mycroft had written to him with the desire to not read it now – not here, not in front of Dean –
“He has a tendency of finding us like that,” Sherlock muttered, and Harry chuckled.
“Hannibal,” he greeted him, and Hannibal took his hand.
Come Talk To Me by Bon Iver
Lavinia glanced between Harry and John, and then signed her thoughts to him:
“I believe that the Gamemakers are concerned that if they allowed for you and John to reunite before the final interview, Sherlock would find a way to see John, as well,” Mycroft explained, and Sherlock crossed his arms.
And seriously. Thanks <3
Mycroft had been right when he described him as a shark – he even looked like one, in person: flat faced, dead eyed – just like sharks in pictures he had seen at school back in District 12. Just looking at him made his stomach turn – but he would have to. He would have to look into that face – look into those dead eyes that were hiding so much but knew everything there was to know about everyone – and kill him to keep Harry safe.
Iscariot by WALK THE MOON
“No. I need to learn how to fall asleep without you, anyway,” John said, opening his bedroom door and slamming it behind him, shutting the rest of the world out.
John stared at the screen in despair. Within two minutes, Magnussen was able to dismantle an alliance and convince two tributes who had known each other for years to kill each other for no reason, just because he wanted to. Because he had that effect on people – he was able to make them do whatever he wanted them to do, or let him do whatever he wanted to them. He did this to John, the girls in his District, his fellow Careers now – everyone was under his thumb, and he liked it that way.
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said quietly, still avoiding his eyes. “No matter what he says to me, no matter what I want to say in reply, I’m not going to be clever. I’m just going to keep the whole conversation simple and brief.”
And then Clover Frankland joined the group, waving at Mycroft to get his attention and signing something quickly – something John hadn’t been taught, yet. Instead of translating for John, Mycroft signed a simple “thank you” and left it at that, much to John’s confusion, but he didn’t mention it.
He wanted to go to his mind palace – just for a second, just to calm down – to think of a plan – but he couldn’t. There was too much noise, too many people, too many people after him, and not enough places to hide.
Feeling victorious, Sherlock looked up at Atala, ready to smirk or do something twice as childish, but he found that she looked relieved to be rid of the youngest tribute to ever compete in the Hunger Games. Maybe she felt bad for him, too, but didn’t know how to help. He pressed his lips together in a tight smile and nodded to her, stood up, and led Archie away from her, and looked at their options.
John glanced over to see that Sherlock was staring up at the ceiling, and John’s eyes returned to watching the ceiling with him.
“I know,” Sherlock replied before he could think about it.
Yesterday was really rough for me - basically if anyone wants to be my friend that I can message whenever please let me know; I could use a couple friends. :\ But anyways, sorry - chapter time! :D
“Of course, Mr. Holmes,” the guard replied. “Although, he is not yet aware of Hannibal’s request for execution; we ourselves only found out this morning when he asked for the necessary papers…” he trailed off, he trailed off, flipping to said papers on his clipboard. “He’s already filled out his part of the forms, if you choose to fill out yours…”
The first week of Sherlock’s recovery was hell – even worse than his first detox when he was younger, but Sherlock knew that was only because he was feeling his brother’s death for the first time in full since the night it occurred. Feeling that – feeling the hole in his heart like a fresh wound covered with salt instead of a constant dull ache that he thought he could ignore and survive – on top of the vomiting and the fatigue that came with the withdrawal, made everything Sherlock did a struggle. There were times when he begged John to get him some Morphling – he even gave John the name, address, and physical description of the man he had been getting it from – but John refused every time (he did, however, find the man to threaten him just enough to ensure that he would never supply Sherlock with even a drop of Morphling ever again). He even asked Harry, once, but he immediately retracted the request upon seeing the look on her face.
Emmettson Blasscliffe’s wide eyes grew wider, surprised as he beamed at John.
I can assure you, Beatrice, and anyone reading this, of three things, right now:
“No, I haven’t been put through that. I was going to be, of course, but I was able to buy myself some time since Sherlock lacked a guardian. I made a deal with President Snow: I could stay in District Twelve with Sherlock until he was old enough to be reaped. The moment he turned twelve, they could do whatever they wanted with me. Naturally, he agreed. What he did not expect, of course, was that I would lose potential...let’s call them ‘clients’. I did everything I could think of to both prepare myself for what was to come and to keep it from happening. Within those three years, I lost some amount of attractiveness, and gained...a bit of a gut, for lack of a better term. It had to be enough to make myself unattractive to the Capitol, but I had to stay thin enough so everyone wouldn’t think I gained a food addiction after the Games. Surprisingly enough, you’re kind of disrespected among the Gamemakers and the Capitol if you’re too physically affected by the Games.”
Not her not Harry
It was then Sherlock Holmes lost his cool, lost everything, and ran at Charles Augustus Magnussen.
cking
“Shit – right,” Harry said, as if she was just remembering. “I always forget that – how she – why she –”
“Fuck you –”
“It’s all ready for you,” Alexander replied, handing Mycroft his umbrella.
“Shit, Sherlock,” he started, as if remembering something.
“Well, with an advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology the known dispositions of any given individual can reduce the number of variables, considerably,” Sherlock said, gaining speed as he went. “I myself know of at least fifty-eight techniques to refine this specific seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables –”
The siblings of the victors from each District – the victors’ siblings from District 12 –
There was silence as Sherlock filled his glass, and Mycroft began to speak again as the glass touched Sherlock’s lips.
John preferred it when Mycroft led the conversations of who John was talking to – it was like he was taking a load off of John’s shoulders that John didn’t even knew he had until now. Ever since the end of his Hunger Games, casual conversation was difficult – he didn’t know how to open, how to close without seeming rude – it was as if he was turning into Sherlock. Mycroft was good at conversation, though – he drifted in and out and on to other people as naturally as breathing. John wondered if he used to be like that, and if he could ever get back to a point where he could converse normally.
“It’s…it’s from Mycroft,” Sherlock replied, turning his attention back from it.
“I’m sure you’re all wondering how we’re going to go about this – how the true victor will be decided upon,” Caesar went on once the noise died down, speaking half to the audience, and half to Sherlock and Harry. “After a long discussion between President Snow, Seneca Crane, and the other Gamemakers that were involved in the making of this year’s Hunger Games, a conclusion that they feel will be in the best interest of everyone involved has been reached.” He reached into the inside pocket his stupid glittering, violet blazer and pulled out an envelope.
John sighed as he straightened himself up. “As I’ll ever be.”
And so they went to the zoo and saw Lions and Tigers and Bears – oh my-CROFT FLYING THROUGH THE SKY
“Yes it does – you told me my name matters, which means your does, too. Now, what is your name?”
And so, when John took Sherlock’s shirt and pulled it over his head, Sherlock returned the gesture and removed John’s shirt without a second thought, for their clothes were only serving as unnecessary barriers between them. Because, after everything, after everything the Capitol had done to them and all the walls they and the Games had put between them, a few layers of cotton seemed like nothing, now. Within just a few minutes, they had completely taken off each other’s clothes and discarded them on the floor.
He looked back at Mycroft, and for a moment Mycroft looked concerned.
Then he realized where he was – who he was.
“Sure,” he said. “I like your net-less.”
Sherlock and Harry’s hands found each other’s, as Sherlock internally groaned in anguish. His fate – both his and Harry’s fates – were once again held inside of a stupid envelope.
What they failed to notice, however, was the fact that Hannibal Lecter Magnussen was still in the room, walking their way, staring right at John.
As they ran, Alexander unclipped a portable phone (similar to the one he had seen Claudius Templesmith with before) from his Peacekeeper uniform’s belt and started speaking into it.
“Did you know that your brother was hurting all those girls in District One?”
“Why?” Sherlock asked the first time John made the offer.
This had to work – it had to – and if it didn’t –
“You can’t be in a walking coma for the sponsors – “
“What? No –” Sherlock started, trying to drag the drip’s pole away from Mycroft, but he also held onto the pole. “Get off – what are you doing?”
“You had no way of knowing he had gotten out too or that he was there –”
“Looking for inconsistencies?” John asked, nodding to the manifesto once Sherlock looked up. “Because there are a lot of inconsistencies.”
“Yeah, that’ll happen – especially considering what both of you have been through and how many times you’ve almost lost each other. He gets nervous when you’re not around, too,” she said.
“John –” Harry called from beside him, and it took Sherlock a moment to realize the shooting had stopped, just as John dove in between them, throwing his gun to the floor, moving Sherlock’s hand and pressing Mycroft’s open wound for himself.
He finally nodded.
The three kids exchanged looks, Sherlock smirking at John, Harry winking and sticking her tongue out at her brother, and John glaring at his boyfriend and his sister.
“Fantastic,” he muttered, irritated, panic flaring in his heart. He had no idea what would happen if he got the next three attempts wrong, and he hoped with all of his might he wouldn’t have to find out. His heart raced as the words he had spoken to John just a little more than a week ago arose in his memory.
– they just make me nauseous,” Sherlock tried to explain.
“John?” she asked, giving him John’s name sign in the process: she signed the letter “J”, and then brought her hand to her chest, tapping her heart with her pinky finger twice – J for John, and then his heart. “Yes,” she replied.
“M-Mycroft –”
“Yeah, but this is different – everyone was watching the Games, then. Now there’s no new footage to watch – now they’re just waiting.”
“Well, maybe you should.”
“I love you – I never said it enough but I do – I’ve always loved you – since the beginning – I fell in love with you within five minutes of meeting you –”
“Just walk us through this, Sherlock. Start at the beginning – he was in your
“Mycroft Holmes,” she said, looking up at him. “Would you mind dancing with me?” It struck John then how much Harry had grown. He remembered the last time she had done this: her face was almost as red as her hair, wringing her hands, and looking as if she was asking her toes to dance instead of Sherlock’s older brother.
Hello, here's a chapter! :D
“Sherlock?” the man repeated, confused.
He smiled down at John and patted his shoulder, and then he walked to the door that one of the two Peacekeepers was holding open for him. Just as he reached the doorway, he turned back to Snow.
lose you, for a few minutes there. But you came back – you came back
So, heeeeeeeeeeeere we go...
Of course he believed this was true, but there was also a small part of him that remembered what happened the last time Sherlock vanished off the face of the earth and John was one of the people in charge of finding him; his partner in the operation was the one who found Sherlock, and all John found was a whole new traumatizing experience.
Of course he did – just like Sherlock wanted John to know that he would die loved last year. But now that Sherlock knew that he was indeed loved, he wasn’t sure that he wanted to know it anymore.
“I don’t think I can do that –”
Sherlock saw it now – how could he have been so blind? Mycroft had believed – he had believed this whole time – that Sherlock would get both of them out of the Arena, alive.
“No one used to know anything, before,” Mycroft went on as if nothing had happened, tearing John from his thoughts. “We only get an idea of what’s to come now...” Mycroft trailed off, and John looked up to find him staring back at John intently.
Maybe he wasn’t doing this to them, again.
curriculum for history! I don’t
what I was expecting when I took the job, but I’m doing good with it. Good at it. And –”
“Me? No; I refused to let Magnussen ruin anything we were doing,” John said quietly. “The only thing I wanted was to for him not to ruin us.”
“Of course, Mr. Holmes; my apologies,” he replied, though he smiled as he spoke, obviously excited over the fact that
snap: saraherbie
Finally, Sherlock got up, shot up once again in the middle of the night, and resorted to pacing the length of his room, hands shaking at his sides, trying to exhaust himself just enough to pass out into a dreamless stupor.
“Call me Nana, dear; everyone does,” she said, and they shook hands. “Oh, dear – your heart is so big.” She looked up at him – directly into his face, despite the milky film over her blind eyes. “What are you doing here? How did you win with a heart so big?”
“I’m fine – bored as hell, but fine. You?” she asked, putting her tray back on its rolling table and pushing it away.
“Mentor me how?” John asked, taking a step away from Mycroft. Mycroft wasn’t his mentor, anymore – he was his own mentor, now. Unless –
Mycroft had told them, only yesterday, even though it seemed like it had been at a far more distant time.
“Mycroft Holmes and I met for the first time when he returned from his Hunger Games, when I was seven years old and he was sixteen...and honestly? He intimidated me. I had never met a victor of the Hunger Games before, and I had watched him kill people – and I was just a kid. He was bigger and stronger than me and even bigger and stronger than John and...I had no idea that who you are in the Arena is not who
The first few weeks, the day John was to leave for District 1, John would ask Sherlock if he wanted to come with him.
“But the damage has been done already!” John exclaimed.
The instant John Watson started to take off his clothes, Sherlock’s eyes engaged in a war between staring at his friend point-blank as he undressed and looking at everything except for the space John’s body occupied. Luckily, the latter side won out, and Sherlock found himself craning his neck to survey the position of the sun as he spoke.
Sherlock found that, on the days in which John was home and Harry was not, he was seeking out affection from John more than the days in which all three of them were in the house. In fact, it seemed like just about every kiss they shared – apart from the ones that John would give him on the forehead or cheek at random intervals – turned into a full-blown make out session, where it seemed like both of them were fighting against the urge to tear the other’s clothes off in order to get even closer than they already were.
“Probably.”
The first drawer contained ties and handkerchiefs and other accessories that one would add to their three-piece suit from the closet; the second held pairs of socks and underwear; the third drawer was for his Capitol-issued button-up pajamas - nothing that he could wear during the day without everyone knowing that they were, indeed, pajamas.
They were in the same colors that the Gamemakers had assigned to them when putting them into the Arena. Harry wore a puffy red dress that made her look older and younger than her age simultaneously, her butchered hair salvaged by Connie’s prep team by turning it into a beautifully fashioned asymmetrical pixie cut. Meanwhile, Sherlock donned a suit that was extremely similar to (if not exactly alike) the suit that John had worn during
It was something that the two had picked up within the last year – an inside joke of sorts. Since Sherlock was more or less living with the Watson’s after John’s win, Sherlock and Harry were more or less always together, but their dynamic had changed from the last time Sherlock had lived with the Watson’s. When they were kids, Sherlock had John, so he didn’t necessarily
Sherlock led John into the alley between two buildings, where no one would see them, and where no one would look for them. If it weren’t for the music or their nice clothes or the weird feeling in John’s stomach and all the other things that had changed between then and now, he might’ve drawn similarities between now and their first meeting.
“Dean wanted to talk to him,” Harry replied before John could.
Mycroft Holmes shrugged. “I believe in Sherlock Holmes.”
“And I don’t drink all that much in the first place,” John added.
“I think he was just bored, trying to avoid living out the rest of his sentence. Life in prison ends with death and all that…” the guard trailed off as Sherlock nodded. “He’s asked for you and Mr. Watson, on a few occasions.”
John, still stupidly frozen to the spot, watched the scene from the stage, and then made eye contact with someone in the first row of the audience – someone who, like him, was just standing there. It took a second for John to recognize him – it was Claudius Templesmith, the Hunger Game’s announcer. He stood, getting pushed around by the escaping Capitol bystanders, but he still managed to glare up at John despite that. He was talking into something like a handheld phone – John couldn’t make out the words he was speaking, but once they made eye contact, a small, sinister smile grew on Claudius’ face.
“And what is ‘this,’ exactly?” Sherlock asked.
So Sherlock pressed on, searching for John and for Harry – for Mycroft – he had to find them – they wouldn’t just abandon him –
“Ignorance is bliss,” Sherlock muttered.
Mycroft straightened up, now completely dressed in what the unconscious Peacekeeper had previously donned. “Do you trust me, John?” he asked.
“My reply will take all of two seconds, though he’ll probably spend the rest of the time trying to convince me to change my mind, with little-to-no success.”
Harry repeated.
“Thank you.”
“Harry Watson, do you trust me?” he asked again, and Harry took a shaky, slow breath in, and out.
But none of it felt real – not really, at least not for Sherlock. The park in place of the training center; the Watson’s house in District 12’s Victor’s Village that John and Harry had let Dean turn into a Mockingjay Rebellion museum while Mycroft’s room remained untouched next door; the ability to travel from District to District and the severe lack of starving families within each District; all of it seemed completely unreal – too good to be true, in Sherlock’s eyes. There were mornings where he’d be afraid to open his eyes, afraid that everything in the past eight years had been nothing but a dream and he was just going to wake up in District 12 on the morning of his reaping – or worse, John or Mycroft’s reapings. There were still times where the Capitol’s seal would appear on the television screen and Sherlock would expect to see President Snow making an announcement instead of Dean Bainbridge. But then he’d hear Hamish’s voice or Rosie’s babble or cry, or feel the touch of John’s hand, and he’d be back. And no matter what, the world never took Sherlock back in time, yanking this beautiful life he had built with John out from under his feet as if it was all one huge, cruel joke.
“He gutted him – sliced him right here; gave him a smile.” she explained, tracing the blade across her shirt as a demonstration, lightly, so she didn’t damage her shirt. “Hannibal knew exactly how to cut Will – it was surgical, according the Gamemakers. Hannibal wanted Will to live; to be conscious enough to watch him eat his heart before his brain completely shut down and he could eat that, too. He wanted Will to hear his own cannon and know that he was dead. Did you know the Gamemakers tried to kill Hannibal before he won? Once he started eating his victims in the Arena, they realized they didn’t really want a cannibal for a victor. They set up traps specifically for him, but he found his way out of every single one. He outsmarted the Capitol.” Antonia held the knife up, and John could see himself reflected in the blade. She stared at the knife for the moment, inspecting it, and then slid her eyes over to look at John. “If Hannibal shows up here, tonight, I think I’d like to give him a similar smile. Finally do what the Capitol wasn’t able to do. Wouldn’t you?”
“It’s William, though,” he reminded him, sneering. “Tell me: have you two said your goodbyes yet? Or are you waiting for the morning of for that final fuck?” he asked, his mouth wrapping around the words slowly, watching John all the while for a reaction.
“When you said that you believed in me, did you mean –?” he trailed off, unsure if he should say what he had in his head – completely aware that it was possible that someone could be listening in on their conversation.
“Oh, don’t,” Harry tried to laugh, but there were tears in her eyes all the same. She put her hand on her chest, over the locket John had given her.
“Norbury – what’s Norbury?” John asked, and Sherlock took a deep, shuddering breath to explain.
“No, this is what
And when John Watson stepped into Sherlock’s room, he found Sherlock Holmes, standing in his lilac swimsuit, tears rolling down his cheeks.
Mycroft then turned to Harry.
“Well, no offense meant, but...you’re a woman. Women don’t normally win these kinds of things; I’m sure you understand. Although, this could be an equal fight, seeing as the Sholto family has a history of losing these sort of things.”
consideration –”
“How could they do that?” John asked. “Manipulate things to recreate the past?”
he would not discuss this with anyone,
“To get in the water! Seriously, what is wrong with you, today?” he asked, and Sherlock truly didn’t know – it was like his brain short-circuited the second John took off his clothes, and now that he was naked in front of him…Sherlock had been more than distracted by it.
“Wouldn’t that have been a blessing to us all,” Mycroft replied with a subtle smile.
“Here!” John called out, and everyone whipped around to see them. “We’re here!”
“Morning,” John muttered, still not completely trustful of his Career District personality.
The last tier was, if one was proven to be a danger to others, or if they were believed to
Once they were far enough away from the train, John spoke of other things. “I know what you’re doing, by the way,” he said quietly.
“I think you know the answer to that,” Mycroft replied, not taking his eyes away from the space directly in front of him. “Let’s not focus on feelings and just do what we have to do, shall we?”
“Okay – just wait outside I’ll find you after the –” but before John could finish, Sherlock got up out of his seat and dashed out of the auditorium.
The amusement in Hannibal’s eyes seemed to brighten.
John smiled, and then let himself drop back into the straight-faced expression he normally wore, these days.
He wasn’t sure why he did it – he’d try to boil it down to just being sick and tired of being in the Capitol or the fact that there was
The day of the move snuck up on him, though, and he didn’t realize he had run out of time until he woke up the morning of, while John and Harry were still asleep. He had decided he would read it in his room, so that he didn’t disturb the two siblings, but when he sat down in his empty bedroom, letter in hand, it didn’t feel right. This wasn’t his home, anymore. But there was one place he could still go to – a place he hadn’t really been to in nearly a decade – that was still his home – would forever be his home – his first home, down in the Seam.
“The what?” John asked.
The moment the words were spoken, Sherlock put his brain into motion. If this forty-year-old man could convince a horse trainer to letting him do whatever he wanted, then so could they.
Mycroft sends John to stay with Dean and Alexander while Mycroft resumes his mentoring duties; John learns a little bit about life outside of District 12; John has an unexpected visitor.
“And?”
“What is it?” he asked.
John wanted to tell him that it was his pleasure, but a dull rush of panic fled through him at the thought that Sherlock seemed like he was just tucking John in – like he was going to leave.
“I fear that Hannibal Magnussen may not have given up on trying to have a private conversation with you, and I want you to be as safe as possible while I’m unable to be present,” Mycroft said in the elevator. “And I can assure you that you could not be safer with anyone but the District Four victors. I know you’ve had your reservations about Dean and Alexander in the past because of where they come from, but, if I’m correct, you do consider them your friends.”
It matched, alright. Two things were obvious – the first being everyone had matching jumpsuits, with one difference: where there was wasn’t black, there was a color reserved for each player. The second obvious thing was the fact that it was a jumpsuit – waterproof, skin tight – water was going to be unavoidable in this Arena. And if Sherlock hadn’t figured it out by the time he saw them, the goggles would have helped him in his deduction immensely.
“Not so fast,” Dean cut Sherlock off, placing his hand on the door to keep Sherlock from closing it. “He’s made some demands.”
“For this,” Mycroft said. “Maybe not for this moment in particular, but for this life. The East Wind was never a monster, not really – it was death itself. It was plans gone awry. It was having hopes and dreams and watching them fall apart right in front of you. It was the inevitable life that we would both soon be a part of. You see, I was old enough to understand that the Games were happening and what it meant for us when you still had no idea. I was petrified that if I told you straight off about what life had in store for you; for the both of us...”
It was as if Sherlock was waiting to get out of the rain to die. As soon as the clouds parted overhead, and the red rain stopped falling from the sky, the cannon burst. Harry, who had been talking to Sherlock on and off during their whole trip, trying to keep him awake and avoid tasting the metallic rain simultaneously, stopped dead in her tracks.
But even the Capitol couldn’t take away his beauty.
“I did say that.”
“Opal, Opal!” he called, and she turned around, a smile growing at the sound of her name.
“But I stole their children,” John whispered. “And I lived.”
But before they did, Sherlock had to take care of something – something he felt like he could only do in District Twelve: he had to read Mycroft’s letter.
Hooves of Doubt - Dry the River (for when Sherlock realizes that Magnussen's got Harry)
“Do they normally do this?” John asked, distracted, still watching the other victors watch him. “Just stare and whisper at each other?”
“But you don’t have to –”
John crossed the room and brought Sherlock into his arms, and Sherlock wept into John’s shoulder. After an eternity, Sherlock spoke, his voice contorted by his sobs.
“Alright, so John will be himself and I won’t, we get it.”
before tonight,” he had said when Sherlock and John woke up to find an empty breakfast table.
“Mycroft?” John asked, his voice slightly hoarse, probably from yelling for help through the sound-proof walls.
“But you know how my head works – my deductions – it’s like a reflex. I can’t stop it.”
“Shit – what did he say to you?” John asked, putting the eggs on the table as gently as he could stand, his heart sinking. He was doing it again – he was running away from home again – after everything – just when John thought he could trust him again –
with that final line. Like no epilogue, just cut off. Like Mycroft's life was.
“Yes,” John said quickly, pushing the thought from his head. He wasn’t going to let Magnussen ruin this for them – he wasn’t going to let the Hunger Games ruin this for them, either. The only things that would matter to John tonight were within these four walls – within this bed.
"But you have two more in the livingroom?"
“You’re lucky,” John half-chuckled, and then glanced at his paperwork. “Do I have papers to fill out, too? Since I’m a mentor?”
“Yeah, I think I knew. I think I knew the whole time.” John replied, and as soon as the words passed his lips, the glass barrier appeared between them. Sherlock pressed his hand against the barrier, and John put his hand against the barrier too, so there was nothing but the thick sheet of glass separating them.
This is so weird.
He thought of Sherlock, overdosed on his bedroom floor at the age of thirteen, eyes rolled back in his skull.
But he wasn’t in any of the places he looked.
“What are you doing?” he asked, but, upon hearing that his voice was slurred, tried again, tried to speak at least somewhat coherently.
And remember, my snapchat and kik are saraherbie and my instagram is also SaraHerbertWatson (u can see what the hell I do besides write!)
Hannibal’s eyes flickered with amusement in a way that was so eerily familiar to his brother that it made Sherlock’s stomach churn.
In chapter 13 (Help, or: the one where Mycroft sneaks to District Four to sleep with Dean once), Dean offers to call Sherlock so Mycroft knows that he's alright (since he can't because Mycroft's not supposed to be in District Four). We only get Dean's side of the conversation, but I wrote out the entire phone conversation:
“If you ever need to speak with me, feel free to seek me out. I could help you, if you ask me to,” Hannibal offered, speaking as if he had never touched Sherlock’s dog tags.
He held his hand over John’s dog tags for a moment, took a deep, shaky breath, and began his walk to his demise.
… I should’ve checked on you a long time ago. Maybe then I would’ve figured out a lot sooner that you keep getting high off your ass and letting
A cannon burst in the distance, and Sherlock and Harry looked to the skies, to find James Sholto’s face looking down at them.
Sending a silent apology Sherlock’s way, Harry took her hands from Sherlock’s chest, closed her eyes and fell, careful to conceal her unwounded arm and the dart itself, trying so hard to keep her body from shuddering – to stop herself from sobbing.
And then –
“Seeing as Mycroft was the person who did this – who started the rebellion, thought up the plan, killed President Snow, effectively saved Panem – I thought a separate memorial should be held for him, after the more generalized one. Those of us who knew him well would say a few words, and we’d give our final goodbyes to him. You, of course, are his brother, and the only member of the Holmes family left, so I wanted to ask you: Would you rather Mycroft’s memorial service not included in the broadcast, and just have it between the all of us, here?” he asked, gesturing to the door, and, by extension, the people who were beyond it. “There would be no paparazzi allowed, so there’s no way of anything getting out that way, in case you were worried about that. I also thought that –”
“Take your pick.”
He was just about to undo the rest of Harry’s straps so she could join him on his quest to search for their brothers when the door opened.
Despite the fact that John had no idea Sherlock had that in him, or that Harry had the heart to enjoy it, he couldn’t help but breathe easily, deep sighs of relief.
“What else is in there?” John asked, and Mycroft patted his breast pocket in response.
“You don’t have to read it now,” Dean said after a moment, ending the war that raged in Sherlock’s head, for now.
“None of your business,” Sherlock replied quickly, mouth full of food.
“There’s a number of possibilities,” Mycroft replied thoughtfully.
Thankfully, that was where the morphling came in handy, and Sherlock had access to the supply, thanks to a Capitol man (of whom Sherlock kept forgetting the name of) who had moved to District 12 after the rebellion. He had been in the audience, that night, and had been shot in the leg by a stray bullet in the commotion – Sherlock had deduced that the man was using morphling for the pain, so when Sherlock ran into the man one day while running errands, and the man told Sherlock that if he needed anything to let him know, Sherlock took advantage. The man never wanted anything in return – he was just thankful to be in the presence of Sherlock Holmes, if only for a few minutes.
“Yes.”
“Yes,” Dean replied, and John immediately stood up to go back to his seat, but stopped when Dean spoke again. “It’s Harry Watson’s turn, now.”
“But no one knows about...” Mycroft dropped his voice, eyes darting around the room, as if everyone wasn’t staring at them already. “...
didn’t want him to go. Which was stupid, it was
“This sucks.”
Sincerely,
Out of the corner of his eye, John saw Sherlock and Harry glance at each other in confusion from beside him, but it was obvious that they were the only two people who were confused. It seemed like almost everyone knew of the mystery surrounding the Magnussen sister, and it was obvious that mystery was about to be solved.
“It was nice to see you again, Sherlock – Mycroft,” Caesar lied, shaking their hands, and the rest of the tributes and their siblings joined the three of them on the stage. Sherlock, Mycroft, Harry, and John all joined hands for the sign off, and, looking around, Sherlock could see that quite a few of the sibling teams were doing the same. “And that’s all we have this year, folks! Who do
As soon as Mycroft’s name was mentioned, something in John went off – something happened, and he couldn’t keep his mouth shut.
Sherlock gritted his teeth harder, squeezing Harry’s hand beside him tighter as he raged in silence.
“Do you
If Mycroft had died five months, six days, eight hours, thirty-two minutes, and forty-three seconds ago, and Sherlock got high for the first time again five hours, eleven minutes, and forty-eight seconds after Mycroft died, then –
The Peacekeeper smirked. “I wanted to, but President Snow wouldn’t allow it. He said there wasn’t enough time for it to wear off before the interview – you and your brother would know he’d been tampered with – hey! What are you doing –”
One day, twenty-two hours, twenty-two minutes, twenty-four seconds.
John was confused.
“Is that him, Papa?” Hamish Victor Archibald Holmes-Watson asked, looking up at the statue before them, mouth agape. For a boy who was adopted only a few days after he was born, he was almost the spitting image of Sherlock: messy jet black hair topped his head, and his ice blue eyes were wide, taking everything in.
to get himself arrested?” Sherlock asked.
He missed it when the house belonged to him.
Abigail Reeves, 79, District 7.
Kacie Goodson, 37, District 5.
Three meters...
“And what would they do?” Sherlock asked, quietly enough so no one but John and Harry could hear. John looked up at him, and found his eyes alight with an excitement that he hadn’t seen since they had planned on escaping Panem. “What would they take from us they haven’t taken already?”
Just when Lavinia was beginning to sign the question of how Sherlock could’ve possibly known that she knew John (a question Sherlock gave John the answer to afterwards: she wouldn’t have went all the way to the penthouse specifically if she hadn’t known someone here at least somewhat personally. Also when she glanced at each face, seeing who was in the room, her eyes flicked from Louise’s to Harry’s to Sherlock’s to John’s and then lingered there, which clued Sherlock in that she found who she was looking for.), she caught sight of Harry, who had stood up to stand with Louise.
"I don't know how you managed to miss every note but you did," Jim informed his henchman.
“I…I, um…” Sherlock stuttered for a second, briefly considering which death of their friendship would be less embarrassing: giving the real reason as to why not, or just complying until his body showed John exactly what he was thinking. “…I just don’t want to!” he called, mentally kicking himself for not thinking of a legitimate reason. “You can stay in the water, though! I’ll stay here and –” Sherlock cut himself off before he made the mistake of saying ‘watch you,’ “– I’ll watch your clothes! Make sure nothing runs off with them.”
“Right,” John agreed, nodding. “I couldn’t – the Games were just a few days away – I didn’t want you going into the Arena worrying about me – worrying about what he’d do to me if he won.”
anyone else -" And that's when he can't speak anymore, and Mycroft reminds him that he didn't kill him, and John spits back: "You didn't, either."
Last year, he had been so prepared to go into the Arena as long as he kept John safe and alive. He was confident he would win – he always thought he would win any Hunger Games, and even now, he knew it was possible.
Louise, being most fluent in sign language thanks to her companionship with Clover Frankland, turned to John.
Before Harry could react, or Sherlock could ask for specifics, Caesar interrupted them, walking from the place he and Mycroft were standing at center of the stage to where the three kids were standing, and held out his microphone to John’s mouth.
He would exist in the Holmes household like a guest, not touching anything and, when he had to, leaving it exactly the way Sherlock and Mycroft had left it. He would claim the guest room as his own, unable to sleep in Sherlock's room like he had so many times before. He would, however, sometimes just sit in the middle of Sherlock's room on the floor. He would barely eat, even though not only everyone on the watch team but also everyone in District 12 provided John with meals once they heard that John Watson was living in the Victor's Village alone. He wouldn't sleep, refusing to until he ended up passing out in random places within the house, mostly on the floor of Sherlock's room. He grew angry at any sign of help, even though he was surrounded by it. He waited for death to take him.
“VICTORY TOUR!” [Mrs. Hudson] sang, and Sherlock had already decided that he had had enough peppiness for one day.
He was always rude and antisocial and moody and she, just like John, was always there – and she actually liked Sherlock, and wasn’t just dealing with him because he liked John, like mostly everyone else did.
“I was wrong this time – he didn’t make it out. That’s why I’m President of Panem; that’s why we’re all here today – because Mycroft is not. But I intend to make good on my promise.” He glanced at Sherlock, just for a second, his mouth twitching in smile that only Sherlock could see – an apology for his behavior earlier in the day, and Sherlock nodded in reply. “I know there are so many things that have changed since the first time he asked – for instance, Sherlock is eighteen now, not nine. And he has John Watson; he had him before, too, but we didn’t know that at the time. But I, like John Watson, was given one last thing to do in Mycroft’s name, and I plan to do everything in my power not to break that promise.
Lastly, this was all damage control. If they didn’t do this now and another rebellion was made, the people who fought against Snow and the Capitol would be in the same boat faster than they could even imagine.
At that moment, Sherlock’s paranoia hit him like a bullet through his chest – Lindsay Cairns, this woman – this
“I didn’t. Neither of us did. The only choice we made was the choice to survive.”
Lavinia had been correct; there was one Peacekeeper guarding the room. The moment the doors opened, he stood up from where he was sitting in a chair toward the center of the room, his helmet off, slacking on what he had to do.
And, until he was alone with John and Harry, that was the best he could do.
it.” She looked up at the ever-paling face of Sherlock Holmes. “Sherlock? You doing alright?”
The four arrive in the Capitol; John and Mycroft attend a mentor meeting; Sherlock is prepped for the Games; Mycroft holds a mentor meeting of his own.
After passing through about three different metal detectors, being buzzed into five different rooms, making three vague threats to expose anyone who stupidly decided to notify anyone that he was here, and seven autographs, Sherlock found himself walking alongside a guard as he spoke to him:
At his words, Mycroft slowly sighed, his shoulders sagging, as if he knew what Sherlock was going on about. Maybe he did, but Sherlock prayed that he didn’t – it was too embarrassing.
Sherlock, as if trying to defy her, tore his eyes from Mycroft’s name on the stone to look at Lindsay.
What It Means To Be Alone - The Dear Hunter (for Sherlock post-Bloodbath)
“Holmes,” Sherlock replied, despite himself. “We kept our own names.”
to ask?”
“I don’t want to think about it.”
Harry’s hand trembled as she held the knife against Sherlock’s neck, and Sherlock struggled to keep his own hand steady.
Before Magnussen –
Shield Your Eyes - Dry The River
going to sleep? For me?” he asked, and Sherlock quickly nodded, looking back up at his brother – anything to get Mycroft out of his room –
“Yeah – I had a not-so-secret crush on Daniel for years, and Mycroft knew that, and he knew that he had a crush on me, too. There was a day, after Mycroft came back from the Games, where he had come to pick you up after school and I was talking to Mycroft when Daniel walked by. And Mycroft, without a word, strode right up to him and told him – ordered him, really – to talk to me. And…the rest is history. We dated, we got married, he even took my last name… Mycroft actually officiated our wedding – he bought our rings, too,” she added, quietly, looking down at Mycroft’s grave.
It was in that moment that it hit Sherlock –
“Hm,” Sherlock murmured, and Harry wondered if what she had said had actually reached him.
When he got back to Harry and Magnussen, she was just finishing up her own line of questioning. She looked back up at Sherlock as he approached.
What was once Caesar Flickerman’s theater was now filled with people – not just members of the rebellion, but others, as well – completely making the room their own. When he had first entered the room with Sherlock, Harry, and Louise, John didn’t understand who they all were, until an older couple found Louise and took her into their arms, and then he understood: everyone’s family had taken the next train the Capitol once they had heard – they all came to say goodbye.
“And that is why I
So she got on her knees beside him, put her hands – her hands, which at the moment were missing their fingernails and had swelled to the size and color of tomatoes, although Harry had to assume that it was just a hallucination – onto his chest, and started pressing, trying to restart his heart – tears racing down her cheeks, one after another, screaming until her voice was hoarse and then some.
“I know –”
Victory Tours – I’ve never
And John learned this too, in time, with the help of his sister and his boyfriend. But John also began to take over the role that Mycroft and their parents had previously served, in the past: he became something of their guardian, making sure that Sherlock ate at least one meal a day and slept at least two hours a night, and making sure that Harry went to school each day, keeping in contact with her teachers to see how she was doing. He found that taking care of Sherlock and Harry kept his mind off of the Games and the assault, which is what he needed.
“More pissed than I’ve ever seen her before,” John replied. “Normally she’s loud when she’s mad but just now...”
“Thank them,” Mycroft said.
John’s stomach dropped.
So I wrote out Not Enough AU thinking that was the True and Only Sad AU for this story, but I've been considering other possibilities for Sad Endings (really they're all outcomes of changing the same four events) and I so cannot write them out I want to be ~done~ with this universe once I finish Advantage (Mycroft's story) so I thought I'd give you all a little look into what the other Sad AUs entail:
Harry opened the box, revealing a silver, ovular locket, the size of her thumb, engraved with the letter H.
“He always worries, you not showing up on time won’t stop him.”
Because, after all this time, John was in love with him – they were in love.
Perfect.
“Night, Dean,” John replied, and with that, he left the room, mentally preparing himself for a sleepless night, full of worrying about what tomorrow’s meeting with President Snow would bring.
“It’s a branding. He does it...with everyone he...” he drifted off, letting his tears fall. “You remember Helen Hewlett, from District One? He’s done this stuff to her since before she can remember –
“Yes.”
“Coward,” Sherlock muttered.
John chuckled, and he let Sherlock lead them. John was never one to dance when he was younger – he was far too clumsy for it. He only ever begrudgingly agreed to dance with Harry when they were kids; once he was older he stayed as far away as he could from anything that involved dancing. He had tried dancing with a girl once when he was fourteen, but they were both terrible, so it barely counted. Now, in probably the greatest and worst and most life-altering turn of events John had ever known, he was learning to dance in an alley with Sherlock Holmes.
“I know,” he whispered back. “We’ve just got to keep trying.”
“You didn’t know –”
At this, John immediately sat up, opening his eyes, his hand reaching out to feel the place on the bed where Sherlock should’ve been. It was still a little warm – he couldn’t have gone far –
There was a brief applause to celebrate the ex-Avoxes’ freedom before Dean continued.
“Where is John?” Sherlock asked, glancing around, as if expecting John to appear out of nowhere.
Sherlock followed John without a word, following John to a clearing, where he was faced with –
Sherlock just wished that he wasn’t. Not about this.
“Hey, Harry; hey, John – where’s Sherlock?” [Louise] asked, looking down the line of seats and finding the one next to John was empty.
“I told you it’s a Watson thing,” Harry replied, and tossed her second shoe.
“Oh,” John rubbed the thin beard on his face with his hand, making that skritchy-scratchy sound that Sherlock hated. “I haven’t shaved in a few weeks.”
“What are you going to ask him?” Sherlock asked, looking for inspiration.
They led Sherlock and Harry down a series of hallways, and then into a spare room, locking them inside. Sherlock specifically remembered the tributes being separated during this time, and it took him a second to realize why Sherlock and Harry were grouped together: all of the people who would be coming to say goodbye to the tributes this year would be visiting both of them. But this was the first time Sherlock and Harry had been alone together since the Quarter Quell’s announcement – ever since this mess began.
“You made it my business when you asked me where you could find condoms, Brother Mine,” Mycroft reminded him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Um...hullo,” he murmured, and remembered that his voice was hoarse. He cleared his throat and went on. “I know you don’t need to follow orders, anymore, since Snow is dead and no one I know would make you still have to follow orders, and I know I have no right to ask for this, but I was wondering if any of you could do me a huge favor, anyway?”
“Maybe it’s because I’m still trying to protect Harry,” Sherlock offered, which was partially true: he had been the one to try to talk the doctors in the hovercraft out of putting them under for surgery. “If I came back alone I would probably become a mute.”
“If you’d like,” Mycroft went on, slowly. “I can send a message along to them for you, seeing as you aren’t allowed to see them until tomorrow night.”
“It’s my pleasure. Are you on your way to see our newest victors?” he asked, beaming, and Mycroft nodded.
Sherlock had been dreading the recap ever since his prep team begun applying his makeup, feeling a pit in his stomach swell so a size so large it was crushing his lungs, but he wasn’t able to put his finger upon the reason why until he was sitting there on the plush sofa on Caesar Flickerman’s stage: Archie Neal.
Sherlock exclaimed in reply, and Mycroft waved him off.
“I’ll ask Hal,” Dean replied, and then noticed Sherlock’s apparent confusion. “Hal Packard, from District Three,” he clarified, and Sherlock guessed that that was one of the men who Dean put to operating the camera, since members of District 3 would know about those things the best.
“Oh, I’m sure you’ll find that’s not an option, Aurora...especially considering what I know about you...about both of you...”
John asked, being the first person to speak once Sherlock had finished his explanation. “Can’t he wait until
“So he’s somewhere in this building?” John asked, and Mycroft nodded.
“No,” Harry said from her place on the screen, in the middle of the fear fog, and John looked up, and felt like he himself had inhaled the fog’s gas, as well, as he saw who was silently walking toward her. “No – you’re not real –” she said, out loud, trying to convince herself that that the person approaching her didn’t exist.
Mycroft was dead, and Sherlock Holmes was falling apart. In fact, his brilliant mind seemed to go into a downward spiral with grief. As John and Alexander pulled him forward, with Harry behind them, he threw himself backwards, trying to break free from their grip, screaming all the way.
His lips –
“F-fantastic,” John lied, giving the best grin he could as he held on to Sherlock and Harry’s hands.
Sherlock shook his head.
“Now you’re just sounding like my sister,” John said, and Sherlock leaned away from John to see his boyfriend trying to smile.
“When Mycroft Holmes was reaped for his Hunger Games, he had no mentor. He was given a stack of disks and Mrs. Hudson to guide him through the next week of interviews and training and mental turmoil, just as every Tribute from District Twelve had been given for years and years before him. I had decided from the moment I realized he was without a mentor that I, fresh out of the Games as the victor of the year previous, would take it upon myself to mentor him and the other Tribute from District Twelve, Anthea McAllister, alongside my two tributes from District Four.
stupid – this is what was right, this is what he
“Oh – it’s fine. What were you trying to tell me, though?” John asked, Mycroft raised his chin, looking down at Seneca Crane.
“We can’t have that,” Mycroft said.
“After I, you know, died in the Arena and came back, when I woke up in the maze there was an arrow sticking out of the hedges, and you said you had seen something while under the influence of the tracker jacker venom. Can I ask what you saw?”
“I graduated,” Mycroft replied.
“We’re breaking up,” he decided, but it took a few seconds of horrified staring for Mrs. Hudson and the prep team to get that he wasn’t serious.
-high. I already gave all I had to John and he dumped it all. I’m done.”
His plan had worked –
“So, you think I should go?” John asked, snapping Sherlock back to the present.
And pretty pretty please stay safe out there. And, side note: if any of you reading this have children, you guys better thank your childcare workers or give them a gift basket when this is all over ESPECIALLY if they're still working right now (and since they are considered "essential" they just might be). Shit's crazy, and trust me, they WILL GREATLY APPRECIATE THE GIFT BASKET.
No, this was not normal, at all.
But this was not Sherlock Holmes, though, not really. This was not the brilliant man he had fallen in love with – this was not the young man who sent John the flower this time last year, or the man who danced with him on top of fish in the Capitol. This was a shell of Sherlock – the broken boy in the bread shop who John first felt inclined to talk to – the broken boy with needle marks in his arms whose life John had saved. But John could not save this broken boy anymore.
a badass.”
“Seven.” A cannon sounded in the distance. “Well, six, now.”
“John Watson’s prosthetic leg. Where is it?” he snapped, but the Peacekeeper continued to glare at him.
Sherlock would not be one of those people. If he could, he’d stay as close to the center of the Arena as he could. If he could, he’d take the Cornucopia, but that was a stupid thing to think – so stupid – if anyone took the Cornucopia, it would be the Career tributes, not him.

is winning!” Caesar exclaimed, and John looked away as the cameras gave the audience the gruesome details.
was being released on the eight-year anniversary of the Battle for Panem and Mycroft’s death, seeing as there were eight years between Mycroft’s Games and John’s Games, which Sherlock understood. He just also really hated the idea of having a whole party in the Capitol with people – not just people,
As the tributes and their siblings gathered in the backstage area to wait for their exclusive interviews with Caesar, Sherlock’s eyes were immediately drawn to the Magnussen brothers – to Charles Augustus Magnussen, specifically.
He stood up from the other side of the room, at the opposite end of a circular table, and he clasped his hands together and smiled, as if seeing old friends. He was wearing a white suit, as if he were trying to blend into the room. Next to him was a sort of a hand-held projector, some kind of Capitol television screen, and John saw Sherlock and Harry’s final moments in the Arena playing itself over and over again. His heart quickened, but he fought to act as if he hadn’t noticed.
Antonia’s eyes fell on them, and even though they had just won a war – and even though Sherlock’s brother had just died – John could see her challenging them to say something about what she knew they were both thinking.
But he couldn’t be so bad that he would be locked up
“You can always go back up and ride it down if you love it so much,” Sherlock offered, and Harry laughed, and it was almost like everything was the way it should’ve been.
“And she said I can call her Evvy –” John went on.
The entire time they were watching the Hunger Games play out before them, Sherlock and Harry were holding each other’s hands, and Mycroft placed his hands on each of their shoulders and gave a reassuring squeeze whenever a particularly gruesome or heartbreaking part occurred on the screen. Whenever John thought of the fact that he should be there, holding their hands and putting his hands on their shoulders, able to touch them and hug them and speak directly to them, he felt a pang of jealousy.
overdose.
“How did you know?” Sherlock asked, after a moment. “That I hadn’t been here, before?”
“No,” he protested, all the same.
John sighed again, finally looking at Emmettson Blasscliffe, seeing him for what he really was.
But then, Sherlock slowly let go of Harry, making sure she knew that he was letting her go, so she didn’t fall to her knees as soon as they separated. He then approached John, slowly, as if approaching a wounded animal he wanted to befriend – and maybe that’s all John was, now; a broken boy, far beyond repair.
“A lot of people here aren’t from District Twelve,” Dean whispered to him as loud as he dared. “A lot of people here didn’t know Mycroft. Do you want them to stay or would you like me to ask them to leave?”
It was a game – a real game, not like the Games they were all done playing.
“If…if I ever say too much, again…or if you ever think I’m becoming a bit...full of myself, cocky or…or over-confident…”
– in order to release the book. If he could miss it, he would.
“Why didn’t you kill your brother, then?” the following person asked, without ceremony or context.
“I’m sure Sherlock’s been doing quite a lot of filling in –” Octavia began.
“Yes,” James confirmed, his voice sounding like he was regretting this decision more and more with each passing second. “Like, we could all get together and just…talk about everything. Support each other, you know?”
That’s how Charles Augustus almost killed Harry and Sherlock.
“Can I write them a note? Two notes, I mean? One for each of them?” he asked, and Mycroft nodded.
“Yeah, she does that sometimes. She’s a big supporter of the idea of the sleep-snacking.”
“Alexander is going to guard you until you’re called out onto the stage while I change out of this and meet with the others,” Mycroft said, and then turned John around to face him, lifting the visor away from his face, taking away the barrier between them. “I need you to listen to me closely, John. Something is going to happen, here – right here, on that stage. From the moment you join us, it could be at any second. All I ask of you is to get control of the room and when you have it, don’t lose it. Stall for time. Can you do that?”
“Can we do this later we need to
“Was it quick?” Harry asked. “Did he feel anything?”
“Sorry – couldn’t exactly leave a note. I was just here,” she said, gesturing the clearing. “You nodded off – I figured it had something to do with the tracker jackers since you never sleep at home, so I let you get some rest.”
“You should learn to. Mind you, my brother was just murdered, at the hands of
“The Mockingjay Rebellion?” Harry repeated. “That’s what Mycroft called it – this whole thing?”
So he withdrew into himself – farther into himself than he knew possible – pushed people away who only wanted to help. Within a matter of months, he had driven everyone away, except for Harry Watson. She returned home from District 9 once every two weeks to catch up, but then the visits started to occur further and further apart, and then the visits were replaced entirely by the letters, and soon, there was nothing at all. Now no one came to visit him, and he didn’t want them to.
“Uncle Myc musta lost the hardest,” Hamish said, and Sherlock stared at his son, his breath catching in his throat.
“Stop talking,” John whispered, pressing his lips to Sherlock’s.
But his body was betraying him, just as it had last night with John. He was shaking, fighting back tears – he was afraid. He was always able to divorce himself from emotion – from feelings – but then there was John, and his feelings for John. And now there was him, staring into the face of death, and his fear.
“He does?”
Fear – definitely fear. Because those weren’t just Sherlock’s words, anymore; they were Jim Moriarty’s, too.
“I’m sorry, John, but we can’t, not yet – Dean said he needed to see you guys as soon as he could.”
John is forced to make his choice.
“Sherlock?” John asked, and, at the sound of John’s voice, Sherlock locked his jaw.
“Can’t do anything about it now,” Dean sighed, shrugging. “But for Christ’s sake, Sherlock, could you
The memorial service is held for the people who died in the Battle of Panem; Sherlock, John, and Harry receive an unexpected surprise.
He didn’t know Sherlock’s history – how could he? Sherlock’s addiction to morphling was kept so far under wraps that only three people in all of Panem knew apart from Sherlock himself, up until Charles Augustus Magnussen managed to deduce it six months ago – something that John, even in death, never managed to forgive him for. But this man – this bystander, really – had no idea that Sherlock was using him to fuel his addiction, that he had a history that hurt John so deep he was willing to sprain this man’s arm to keep him from supplying Sherlock with the stuff again. Of course, he should’ve asked the instant any sign of worry crossed his mind, but he was from the Capitol – mental and physical turmoil was more of a sport than a reason for concern.
“John?” Sherlock questioned, gently calling John back to the present, his mouth still so close to John’s skin that he could feel his breath on the head of his –
Quiet In My Town by Civil Twilight (for John's feelings of Mycroft)
“Harry,” Sherlock breathed, and pointed at the Jabberjay. “I know what I said – I know it’s not real – but please – kill it – please, kill it.”
"Whatever you say, boss..." Seb sighed, and began to sing:
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” she announced, and Sherlock could just barely hear the murmurs of confusion scatter through the crowd at the sound of his full name – a name that was uttered out loud so rarely that most people were not aware that it existed beyond “Sherlock Holmes”. His feeling of fear now had a decent amount of shame mixed in, feeling as if the Capitol was dragging his entire being through the dirt on its way to throwing him to the dogs. Yet he still kept his chin up as he made his way to the stage, his chest now hurting from the way his heart was pounding inside of him.
“Babies? I can imagine – the day I told him that he was going to be one of the first people to hold Mychael I swear to you, his face –”
“Look, not so long ago I was in a position that meant certain death –
“Don’t do this to me –” she begged, but it was too late.
“I...I want you to know that...after everything, if you happen to find someone else –”
John sat up, and caught the towel Sherlock tossed at him.
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Lavinia shaking.
have some blood on them from Mycroft's bullet wound(s), he knows that Mycroft not only died, but he probably died right in front of Sherlock. The moment he makes this connection, his breath hitches in his throat, and he nearly loses it right there, until he remembers what Mycroft told him the night before during their last conversation in Chapter 24 (Last):
“I have to keep it together,” John said through gritted teeth. “Because we represent them – and if we don’t have it together, they don’t have it together.”
John and Mycroft go to President Snow's mansion, where President Snow lays out an idea.
“No offence to Alexander, but people don’t listen to him the way they listen to Dean,” he replied.
Sherlock turned, holding John’s other hand. They faced each other, looking into each other’s eyes.
He also didn’t want to do a lot of things. He didn’t want to run laps around District 12 and lift heavy weights and practice hand-to-hand combat with his brother. He didn’t want to sit with his boyfriend, his brother, and the person who was like a sister to him and watch years and years of the Hunger Games play out in front of him, using past victors to predict what their siblings – Sherlock and Harry’s potential opponents – might be like. He didn’t want to hold hands with John under the kitchen table during meals just to feel John squeezing onto him for dear life. He didn’t want to kiss John until one of them started crying. He didn’t want to pretend he wasn’t being stared at by everyone in their school, teachers and students alike. He didn’t want to look at Harry Watson, and look at John looking at Harry Watson with a pain he had never seen before in John’s eyes. But he did all of those things. In fact, every day was a repeat of those things, in different orders.
“Yeah,” John agreed.
Hybrid - Elsiane (for Harry being livid over the reveal)
“They can’t. Know,” John said, his voice breaking. “No one can know. As far as anyone is concerned, everything is normal, and nothing happened in that stairwell. You can kill him if he comes back like you said you would, but right now I have to put on my big boy pants and face it, on my own. No body guards. No protection. Just. Me.”
It took nearly a week after they returned home (eleven days, fifteen hours, fifty-four minutes, and five seconds since that night) for Sherlock to touch the violin that had been gifted to him. Once he was finally able to, though, he began to teach himself how to play, practicing on days he was feeling up to it. It turned out that it was easy enough to do – it sounded beautiful when he got it right. Despite everything, it took about two months for Sherlock to perfect the art, though he knew that he would’ve learned within half the time if his brother was there to teach him. Out of the Watson siblings, Harry seemed to enjoy his music the most; granted, John loved it too, but John would merely tell him that, while Sherlock would catch Harry humming the melodies that Sherlock himself had created, which meant so much more to him.
“Unless?” John prompted.
John Hamish Watson was walking toward Sherlock, for the first time in years.
Mycroft stared straight ahead, at Hannibal’s grinning face during the victor’s interview, and he spoke so quietly John almost didn’t catch it at first, but then he did, and his heart hurt at the sound of it:
When comparing the two groups of Careers from this year and last year it wasn’t nearly as evenly-matched – the group from last year was far more skilled, in terms of the scores they received. They were amazed when Helen Hewlett, from District 1, was scored a seven for her efforts, and when William Wiggins, from District 7, received a ten.
During those months, it was extremely physically obvious just how much the Games and the death of his brother was taking a toll on Sherlock. His already slim body lost a lot of what little weight it had, causing for Sherlock’s spine and ribs to protrude from his skin, and his already prominent cheekbones now jutted out of his face. His sleep schedule (John was using the term loosely) was completely fucked – there were nights where he barely slept and days he slept almost entirely through, but they were lucky when it was even that consistent. There were times where Sherlock nodded off over dinner, or John would think that Sherlock was in his mind palace (a place he very rarely visited, nowadays) just to find out that he was asleep on the couch. He looked at the world with tired, sad, empty eyes, which were so different from the bright, alert, piercing eyes that John had fallen in love with. Before, it was so easy to tell that Sherlock was thinking – he was always thinking, his eyes always analyzing the world around him, but looking into his eyes was like looking through a window to his thoughts – there were times when John could watch Sherlock’s eyes and see a deduction being made, and John loved that – he loved seeing that process in his boyfriend’s eyes. But now, it was almost as if his eyes were clouded – John could no longer see the thoughts forming in Sherlock’s eyes, anymore, and that was probably the difference that scared John the most, more than the weight loss or nonexistent sleep schedule.
“Wait, so they were there this whole time and they just didn’t care that we were being punished for what
“In order to understand how I did it, you must know this: Mischa always loved plants; she dreamt of being an apothecary when she was older; she was fascinated with plants of all kinds and aspired to use said plants to help people. So, with that said, on the night before her twelfth birthday, I bought her a simple sycamore tree sapling – it was so young she had no idea it was nothing more than that – and I told her that it was a very rare tree that grew best when planted at night. That was all it took to lure her out of the District. We went beyond District One’s wall, walked for about two miles more, and then I decided we were far enough away, I let her go on ahead, put down the tree and the shovel, went up behind her, and I strangled her. I quickly removed the meat from her bones, buried her bones under the sycamore sapling, and left. My family assumed she ran away, and nobody asked how we suddenly had all the meat we had. Was that answer satisfactory?”
Not to mention the fact that it would be really dark to write. Like,
John released Mycroft and thought about it for only a second before nodding.
Both of the Watson siblings stared at Sherlock for a moment, slack jawed, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“I feel the same way,” he said, suddenly entirely focused by the food on his plate, idly touching the dog tags he still kept under the wetsuit the wanted nothing more than to take off. “And I’m sure Harry does too.”
His face –
Honestly, Sherlock did not expect anything less from the Capitol. But now he tried not to dwell on the idea of all of these people vomiting in the bathrooms not twenty feet from him.
“People love their Games,” Harry murmured, and Louise nodded in agreement.
He’d hurt John –
He was eighteen years old.
“We all look at him the same way.”
“Hell
“Remind me to send Seamus Ashton a card and flowers,” Mycroft said, as John entered the room.
“Come on –” Sherlock started, grabbing his brother and starting to pull him forward. “They only hit your arm we can keep going –”
“Got it.”
“I am in agony,” Mycroft said in lieu of an actual greeting. “Can I come in?”
“So...” John started, trailing off, unsure of what to say, and Sherlock found himself opening his mouth, starting to speak before he could stop himself.
Mycroft looked down at John, face bunched together, like he had just tasted something sour.
Sector Six: Crows.
“Are you okay, by the way?” Sherlock asked Harry. “Answer honestly – I know when you’re lying.”
“No we can’t just leave him!”
“Very rarely. Normally one doesn’t have to worry about that until after they win the Hunger Games.”
So Cold - Breaking Benjamin (for Magnussen)
And then, he looked at her face, and suddenly, Sherlock was amazed at how much she had grown, how much he hadn’t noticed. This was the same girl who was only seven years old when they met, with a tongue almost as quick and a mouth just as loud as his. This was the same girl who preferred her brother’s hand-me-downs but still enjoyed wearing dresses because she liked the way they flared up when she spun around. This was the same girl who was afraid of spiders but would never admit that to anyone. This was the same girl who used to stand on her toes when talking to her brother for years so she didn’t have to look up at him and still did it from time to time. This was the same girl who hid her girlfriends from her parents, but the moment her parents ganged up on Sherlock for liking their son she outed herself, knowing that they would attack her, too. This was the same girl who drank until she was wasted because the world was too big and scary for her, just like how Sherlock hid behind his drugs, but she never gave up. This was the same girl who was in the Hunger Games, who very probably knew by now that Sherlock planned to die for her, and yet she kept him alive because she loved him.
me,” Sherlock promised. “He...fuck –” He covered his eyes for a moment, leaning against the wall beside him.
“Right, of course,” John replied. “Good luck,” he murmured, giving Sherlock one last kiss before taking his son’s hand. “Come on, Hamish – I think I saw an ice cream store down the street –”
he repeated, fed up with the man’s inability to just answer his questions.
Sherlock then noticed the silence around them.
“Well, if memory serves me correctly, your brother, Cal, lost a game of chicken with Roger Stem; isn’t that true?” James glared at Magnussen, and Magnussen grinned. “I thought so.”
(See the end of the chapter for
With that, Sherlock knew it was the end of the moment, and Mycroft was fully prepared to turn away, finish his cigarette, and go back into the train.
“Where are we going?” Sherlock asked, and Mycroft shook his head, silencing him as he led him to the door to the backstage.
How Does It Feel? - Eskimo Joe
They were almost there, almost to him, when Harry let go of Sherlock’s hand. He looked back at her, and she nodded toward her brother, even though it looked like she was fighting against herself to hang back.
It took three tries for him to find her. He peeked through the window and found her, eating the breakfast that she was given – eating as if she hadn’t in days, which was mostly true – off the tray in her lap. He opened the door, and, when she looked up to see who the new visitor was, she lightened up immediately, a grin spreading across her face, despite her mouth being full.
In the face of learning that John was not only the sole survivor of The Four but also completely orphaned, there's two ways this could go:
"Evil?"
In lieu of a reply, Mycroft put his visor back down, and then he was gone, closing the door behind him.
“It’s nothing –” he said, quickly.
He glanced up at the boy’s podium in a lapse of judgement, and he met the man’s eyes – the eyes of Victor Trevor’s father – and could not become the stone he wanted so desperately to be. He couldn’t be anything – he just stopped everything and stared at him for a moment, his mind miles away from his body:
The day the three had decided to move themselves from District 12 to District 9 fell upon a Thursday, and so the original plan was for John to leave for his support group meeting that night and Sherlock and Harry leave for District 6 Friday morning as they usually would. The only difference would be afterwards, where, instead of all of them going back to District 12, they would instead go to District 9.
At one point, he had glanced up to find Hannibal Lecter Magnussen dancing with a member from District 1 on the dancefloor, but he was carefully watching Sherlock at every opportunity. It occurred to him then that Hannibal had probably been watching him all night, and instantly felt too close to him, even though they were nearly thirty feet away from each other.
And in that moment, everything came flooding back to him.
“We were hurting, too! John and I – we
Harry sighed from beside him, crossing her arms.
His back was to him, at first, but the moment the door closed behind him, the man turned around to see his guest.
“Good you found each other LET’S
And immediately, Mycroft made some excuse to Dean and the others, and walked with John to the training center, into the elevator, and into the penthouse. As soon as they entered, Mycroft left John in the dining room and checked all the rooms, making sure that they were, indeed, alone. He then turned the television on, playing the Hunger Games on a low volume, to keep an eye on their siblings, and then he turned to John.
“You’re going to give me all of it,” John ordered.
– LET ME
“Eurus. Of course, you don’t remember her – you were only a year old at the time, but I was eight – I remember everything about her. Unfortunately, though, she was born prematurely; she didn’t last the night. Do you happen to know what the name Eurus means?”
was the one the Capitol paid attention to and paraded around Panem like a banner.
Other than the doors to the elevator, there were two doors in the room: one on the left wall, where the Peacekeeper was restrained, and one on the right. Mycroft looked to Lavinia.
John grinned.
“Good,” John said, finally satisfied.
“Me too.”
As much as he wanted the water to be so hot it boiled his skin, he knew the steam left behind would bring him back to even more panic-inducing times. Instead, he turned the cold water on, and sat in the stream of water until his body was numb.
John was the first to speak:
But Philip had died, in the end, and Archie would too, especially with people like Magnussen in the Arena. If Archie survived the bloodbath, it would just be a matter of time until someone got to him.
the Hunger Games in play, they would be permanently incarcerated in a prison cell, with no hope of joining the rest of Panem.
“You were always just Sherlock Holmes,” John replied, and Sherlock chuckled again, rolling his eyes. They stood in the near-quiet of the night for another few moments. “I hate this,” John finally said.
Dr. Monroe’s son, Thomas Jr., was in Mycroft’s class, and used to beat Sherlock up after school with his friends. He remembered with a stab of regret that Mycroft had been the one to get Thomas to stop, coming to his house and confronting him the very next time Sherlock came home with bruises after Mycroft won the Hunger Games. In fact, the following day Thomas pulled Sherlock aside and apologized for being such an ass to him, and Sherlock could tell he was only saying that because Mycroft had put him up to it.
“I wouldn’t let him touch me in a million years.”
this; I had no idea I wouldn’t have any paperwork.”
Knowing that he wasn’t going to be able to avoid conversation, now – not without outright ignoring John – Sherlock rolled over to face him. As soon as he looked into John’s eyes, he knew what his boyfriend was going to ask: if Sherlock was okay. He knew that he only really had three ways to answer the question truthfully – if he just told John that he was fine, he wouldn’t believe him. Judging by the way he was feeling right now, once the question was asked, he would either end up sobbing because of the tragedy he had suffered, kissing John because he was happy they were both alive, or laughing uncontrollably because he was high on Morphling. Before he could sort through the pros and cons of these options in his head, the inevitable words passed John’s lips:
Now Sherlock didn’t know what to do.
It finally hit John full-on now, just like it was hitting Sherlock over and over again with each shuddering breath he took: Mycroft Holmes was dead.
after that – and I didn’t even
He sat like that for a long time – listening to his own breathing, the sounds of the world existing – the world continuing on despite the severe lack of his brother.
Stepping into President Snow’s mansion was like stepping into a pure white room. Everything in the front hall was a blinding white color, and John fought the urge to place his hand before his eyes to stop from squinting. For a moment, he wondered why he hadn’t noticed it before – he had been in this very hall twice in his life and distinctly remembered it being a warm yellow color instead of looking like someone had doused everything in snow.
His body decided that then would be the best time to puke, right on the floor beside him, trying to expel Magnussen’s spit from the inside of his mouth, but even the taste of stomach acid and that morning’s breakfast couldn’t mask the taste of Charles Augustus Magnussen.
That was, until now, Sherlock thought to himself, as he reached one of the closest entryways to the park, and waved down a taxi. When he was first making plans for the trip out, he considered catching a Capitol bus to deliver him where he needed to go, but then he thought of all the eyes of the other passengers, and he decided that the taxi would be much more private.
“Sherlock!” John called out, without meaning to, just as Caesar Flickerman spoke on the broadcast:
“Now we go up to the penthouse of the training center – I scheduled a little support group with the rest of the mentors in our situation.”
“I...I need a break,” he admitted finally, and Harry helped him sit down against the wall of the hedge.
So he watched as the cameras checked in on Sherlock and the careers and the rest of the tributes and finally, the cameras checked in on his sister. She was climbing a tree, trying to find a suitable place to sleep, when –
“Me too.”
It wasn’t a fire – it was Harry Watson –
of our time in idle conversation, can we?”
“I’ll be fine,” Sherlock muttered, just a pinch louder. “I just wish you were here. I still wish you were here,” he said, finally, and turned away, beginning his trek through the park, in the opposite direction his family had gone in.
And finally, near midnight (one day, three hours, fifty-one minutes, and fifty-eight seconds after his brother’s death), he was done.
The following day was the Tour’s stop in District Nine. John may have dozed for about an hour in all, and when he realized there was no more point in trying to sleep, he got up and discovered his hands were trembling with nerves. Sherlock noticed that immediately.
Nicole Down, 55, District 10.
As soon as their hands touched, Sherlock’s puffy red eyes flicked over to John’s person, and then away, again, even as he held onto John’s hand for dear life. He thought of how quickly Sherlock had jumped to John’s defense when Antonia simply grabbed his arm to keep him with the group, and knew exactly what he was afraid of.
Careful not to wake up Sherlock, he maneuvered himself into a sitting position and put on his prosthetic – an act that was now becoming as simple and automatic as breathing, and he hated himself for it. He felt like this was something he wouldn’t be able to get used to, like he wouldn’t forget what it was like to live with both legs intact, but he was, and surprisingly fast.
John’s Hunger Games lasted nine days.
If anyone found them, he had to protect her –
John also found himself remembering the words he had spoken to Caesar Flickerman last year, during his first interview:
“I thought I was supposed to be
add me and shoot me a message saying that you've read my fic! :D
“…Yes, I think I did. Thank you. Now, if you could please drive me to the bookstore on Eighth Street…” he started, and glanced back at the prison, one last time, knowing exactly what was going on within the walls at that moment. “…I have a family to go see.”
“Can I have one?” he asked, and Harry nodded, a small smile appearing on her face. “Awesome, you’re the best –”
Some of the characters (namely, the boys) aren't exactly the nicest, maybe I should have mentioned that in the contest itself but I didn't I'm so sorry - I'd like to especially apologize to lockedjawn221b; I hope you didn't suggest Gideon after someone special. 😅
“You put so little faith in me.”
“My name is John Watson, I’m from District Twelve, and my little sister Harry, and my boyfriend, Sherlock, are in the Games.”
He barely registered Sherlock letting go of his hand, or the microphone being clipped onto his chest, or doors opening before him –
There were nights that Harry woke up, screaming her brother’s name, just for John to rush into her room for her to start babbling about seeing Magnussen in the fog in her dreams. Once she realized who she was talking to, she would stop herself, because her brother’s nightmares contained almost the exact same thing, and start fumbling over apologies (“– fuck – I need to start calling Sherlock for this shit – I’m sorry – I keep forgetting –”). But, each time this happened, John would tuck her back into bed and stay with her until she was asleep again.
“So I imagine you wouldn’t want to pay Mr. Flickerman a visit today, as well?” the guard asked, and Sherlock scoffed.
But he obviously had.
on top of
But he didn’t sleep.
The Avox grabbed his hand, making a strangled sound, not so different from the one he had made moments before, but John knew she was trying to say his name, trying to call him back to the present.
“It’s okay to be scared. You told me last year – fear is wisdom in the face of danger, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. Right?”
After ten full seconds of shocked silence, Seneca Crane, Head Gamemaker, closed his dropped jaw, and called Sherlock’s bluff.
“GET THEM!” Caesar yelled from behind them, and then they saw Alexander Waters – who had lifted the visor of his helmet to ensure that the four would run to him and not another Peacekeeper – being grabbed by a real Peacekeeper in the wings.
sword?) he made a weak spot in the bark of the nearest tree, and then pushed the spile the rest of the way through. Almost immediately, water dripped out of the spile, and Sherlock filled up his canteen and removed the spile before finally moving on.
“Got it,” John said.
They glared at each other for a moment more, and then the Peacekeeper finally got up into a crouching position and raised his hands above his head, showing he was unarmed. With Mycroft keeping the gun trained on his head, he cautiously made his way to the pipe in question, and sat down.
Thus, this was born.
Sherlock was alive – he had come back from the dead –
And then Magnussen’s body fell forward, landing at Sherlock’s feet, his blood beginning to flow onto his boots
Harry was exceptionally talented in the obstacle course. As Archie climbed up and down the rope wall (the only thing he really enjoyed doing within the confines of the room), Sherlock kept an eye on Harry as she bounced from station to station, always finding her way back to the obstacle course. She continuously tore through it in the shortest amount of time, sometimes beating her score, sometimes not, but she was always above everyone else. The person in second place was Charles Augustus Magnussen, despite his old age, surprising even Sherlock. Sherlock would’ve been in third, or maybe even in second place, but he ran through it with Archie, which landed him in the five-minute area, as opposed to Harry’s under-a-minute.
Mycroft – natural leader that he was – was the first to stand up and speak.
Also!
“Neither of you will ever believe me –”
“Thank you,” Sherlock replied quietly.
will worry.”
“HARRY LOOK OUT!” Sherlock shouted at the top of his lungs, as he pulled out his sword.
But these weren’t normal crows, and Sherlock knew it. Crows were diurnal birds, not to mention
John glanced back to where he'd been watching Sherlock and his sister being led off by the Peacekeepers to go meet their prep teams, found that they were nowhere to be seen, and then looked back up at Mycroft.
Mrs. Hudson then started beatboxing the end.
“I tried to be brave – to tell him that I could tell someone – the Gamemakers – anyone – and then he kissed me – he kissed me and I hated it – it was wrong – it was wrong –”
“How much farther?” John asked, looking up at Alexander.
“He wouldn’t let me go if he knew –”
I Am Dust - Gary Numan
John nodded silently, and then he whispered the question: “How did you do it? Why?”
Eyes Wide Open - Gotye
“Which is why I immediately fired from the news team,” Dean finished.
“Of course you do!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed. “You’re a victor of the Hunger Games, after all – this banquet is for
“Is it true there will be no more Hunger Games?”
“You,” he started, pointing at Sherlock, and Sherlock looked up at him. “Out. Now.”
“He didn’t do anything
“And I don’t need to worry, do I?” John asked, but Sherlock could tell that his boyfriend was already worried.
His nose –
Speaking of Chapter 24 (Last), there's a sentence that Dean tries to start when Mycroft brings up the idea of giving up his place in the tunnel (and possibly his life) if the Battle for Panem turns into...well, a battle. Dean says: "But if you - I - Sherlock won't forgive you." Idk how obvious this was, but in case it wasn't, Dean was going to say "but if you die, I won't forgive you," but ultimately bailed on that sentence, only because he knew that his feelings wouldn't be enough for Mycroft to change his mind, but
After that, Mycroft went through extreme lengths to ensure that John steered clear of Hannibal. But Mycroft wasn’t there to protect him, anymore.
John wanted to – if only to just see the look on President Snow’s face – but Mycroft would kill them before anyone else could, and John knew that.
John, Sherlock, and Harry adjust to living after the Games and the Rebellion; Harry goes back to school; Sherlock continuously worries John; Sherlock surprises John.
“Mrs. Monroe,” she clarified.
“No, nobody gets to play the Hunger Games anymore.” Sherlock informed him, maybe too quickly, maybe reminded a little too much of the first and only three-year-old to play in the Hunger Games…
With great flourish, knowing that Sherlock and Harry’s entire lives were dependent on the contents of the envelope, Caesar opened the envelope, pulled out the card inside, and read it out loud, his voice booming in the now otherwise-silent room:
“If we do that, it’s easier for us to be seen by anyone who happens to be on shore,” Sherlock replied. “And, seeing that Aurora Blake has died, Magnussen might be making his way there to try and find us – he’ll be able to see practically all of the shore from there, so if we go to shore and he’s there he’ll see us, and he’ll go our way immediately. Right now he has no idea where we are –”
“Who do you think will be your biggest threat?”
“Frankly, I don’t even want to talk to him long enough
“Yes, it’s really me, and I’ll be willing to autograph whatever you want me to sign, but could you please refrain from making a fool of yourself and just take me to this address, first?” he asked, passing the driver a torn piece of an envelope.
“Yeah, it does.”
And John, Sherlock, and Harry stepped out of the train, and were greeted with a mix of applause, cries, and the salute that the members of District 12 had given to Sherlock and Harry during their reaping ceremony. Some people even ran up and hugged the three teenagers – some of them John could recognize, like Mrs. Monroe and the mayor’s daughter, Madge, and maybe a couple of John’s past teachers or classmates.
Instead, he looked to the screen above them, and tried to mentally prepare himself for the finale.
SEND ME UR QUESTIONS
And in that moment, John knew four things:
“We did. The remaining Peacekeepers surrendered about half an hour ago. We’ve been regrouping since then.”
“How long until they stop?” Sherlock asked quietly.
John, Harry, and Dean share their eulogies. Sherlock has a panic attack.
“Me too,” Sherlock said, and gave her his best half-smile. “How are you doing? Are you okay?”
“It’s too heavy,” Archie said as Sherlock pulled himself up onto the platform.
“Harry, shit –” he breathed – how could he have been so stupid? How could he have left her alone?!
“And you came anyway,” Magnussen said, stepping forward, and Sherlock glanced quickly at the ground, making sure he was behind the designated yellow line. “Are we no longer on a first-name basis?” he asked, changing the subject, slightly disappointed.
“YES,” he nearly shouted, which caused the audience to erupt into laughter, sounds of adoration, and cheers. Embarrassed by his sudden outburst, he shrunk back in his seat, and Mycroft, who was on his right side, placed his hand on his shoulder, and Harry, on his left, held tighter onto his hand than she had been already holding. Both of them smiled at him – Mycroft’s was a mess of emotion, happy for him and apologetic that it had taken this long and brotherly – and Harry’s seemed just as excited as he felt.
“Sorry; my name is James Hewlett, from District One. We haven’t met, but my sister, Helen, was in the Hunger Games with you. I was also part of the Mockingjay Alliance, I knew your –”
“Probably because he was too preoccupied to focus on that when he was trying to start living without half of a leg.”
“Okay.”
“It won’t –” John said.
“That’s
“Yeah,” Sherlock said, returning his gaze to John. “I’ll be fine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you quite sure?” Mycroft asked.
Ramona Andrews, 50, District 1.
He picked up the spear and stepped on her back, and Aurora Blake screamed as Magnussen plunged her own blood-soaked spear into her body, pushing it through the space between her ribs and through the other side, into the dirt and moss beneath her, pinning her to the ground.
Canvas - Imogen Heap
“You’re good,” he said. “He’s a
“Considering that you’re a cannibal, it’s hard to tell where exactly your morals lie.” Hannibal smirked in response, but Sherlock spoke again before he was able to open his mouth to reply. “You knew what your brother was doing, didn’t you? To the girls in District One?”
of something bad happening if John didn’t do what the Capitol told him to would scare him into submission. “I don’t want to find out.”
“He’s dead, Twelve!” the man shouted back at her, his white armored suit marked red from whatever the hell she was covered with. “He’s ours, now!”
“Where is he?” he nearly growled, and the two guards glanced at each other, both of them obviously hoping the other would know what exactly he meant. He then realized these two guards were not the same ones from that morning, and rephrased his question. “John Watson, victor of the Seventy-Fourth Hunger Games; I know you know who
“Do we get to go home if we lose?” he asked, very quietly, the innocence drained from his voice, and Sherlock, knowing that Archie was on his way to truly knowing the answer, told him the truth.
He watched as Hannibal took in the news of Sherlock’s betrayal, smirking at the way his face fell as he thought of a proper rebuttal.
In moments, someone was grabbing his arm, and John almost screamed and tried to fight them off as it took two Avoxes to hoist him to his feet. As they did, the redhead Avox signed to him:
When Sherlock had first arrived back home from the Games, devastated by the loss of his brother but still with John by his side, he had tried to be better – nicer. More social. He wanted to make Mycroft proud, despite still high on morphling most of the time.
It took all of the effort John had not to rip his hand out of hers.
“Nothing,” Sherlock deadpanned, not even looking up at Dean.
It didn’t make sense – he had seen dead bodies, before – it wasn’t like he didn’t watch people die every year for sport. He had even killed people, himself, creating dead bodies in the Arena. He had even seen Mycroft die.
“You’re done,” he guessed, and John shrugged.
“Not a word! I just forgot we live with Panem’s biggest Johnlock fan!”
“Hey,” John replied for the group. “What’s going on?”
At the sound of his name, Sherlock spun around to see who had called out to him, to find the woman from last night, Alma Coin, still dressed in a grey jumpsuit, her straight, grey hair still falling beyond her shoulders. This time, though, she was being flanked by two helmetless Peacekeepers – Sherlock had told Dean not to trust Coin, and Mycroft had too, based on the lack of surprise in Dean’s response; so the Peacekeepers must’ve been trustworthy enough to keep an eye on Coin.
The paparazzi collects statements on Sherlock's resurrection from Mycroft and John; John is threatened; John becomes angry with Mycroft.
It was funny – ever since the Quarter Quell had been announced, Sherlock was so worried about Mycroft – he had felt so bad that he was going to die in the Games and leave him to be the last living member of the Holmes family –
Thomas Rayne, 40, District 9.
“Actually, he’s been upgraded to one of our padded rooms,” the guard replied, and Sherlock couldn’t tell whether or not the guard found justice in the development. “He’s been placed under watch for about a two months, now.”
“Yeah – they kind of threw me off, too – I mean, they never made me sick, but...yeah.”
“For one, the cane is back,” Sherlock began. “Second off, Mycroft’s been watching you like a hawk ever since Harry and I got back. Thirdly, you barely ate anything during dinner, and that normally means –”
“You’re going to have to learn a better poker face, then – both of you,” Mycroft said. “As soon as sex is mentioned John’s face goes as red as a tomato while Sherlock looks positively terrified –”
This following bloop is from a plot point that I completely deleted, but I'm going to post everything I had written for it SOON:
“You should’ve found a new hiding place – the sock index was the first place I looked. I should’ve fucking known you were back to this shit when you started…” John trailed off, talking mostly to himself, but Sherlock knew exactly what he was referencing.
“Are we seriously having a standoff, here?!” Harry asked, complying to Alexander’s command as she spoke.
He suddenly felt extremely aware of the wetness of Magnussen’s saliva on his face, and he wiped it off, digging his nails into his skin, trying to get it off – get it out of his pores – get it away –
“Who said we were going to the dancefloor?”
“How?!” Jim yelled.
Not only did Sherlock keep an eye on Harry, but he also kept an eye out for Charles Augustus. He strode everywhere as if he owned the place, even though he was the furthest thing from a person who owned anything in the Capitol. He cut in front of people in line and made sure he touched everything he could – including people. He certainly found himself a fascination with twenty-five-year-old Helen Hewlett, but then again, they were neighbors for years, and tributes from the same District normally gravitated toward each other. That still didn’t mean Sherlock liked the way Charles looked at her, though – as if she was something to eat. In fact, he looked at everything like that, and apparently his brother did, as well, from the way John talked about him.
Harry immediately fell into a state of denial – asking Dean if he had checked – if he had made
“I think the only way it could be any
“I’m not
Sherlock Holmes was going to die in that Arena, just not yet.
“I can do that,” Clover replied, smiling, eager to help. If only she knew the context of
It was then his adrenaline stopped rushing through his ears, and he heard the crowd’s reaction, with Caesar Flickerman’s voice narrating their confusion:
“But, like, really
"TO TWO-HUNDRED-TWENTY-ONE-BEEEEEEEEEEEE~" Mycroft exclaimed, opening his umbrella and flying out of the room.
“I dunno, support?” John replied, shrugging. “There are a few people there who bring someone with them for that. Mothers, boyfriends, girlfriends…”
“I’m sorry, John –”
“John,” Sherlock said, silencing John immediately. “I want this.”
A few miles, a refused offer of payment, and one autograph later, Sherlock found himself at his destination: Panem Penitentiary. Standing outside the building, Sherlock could feel himself trembling, and he, operating by force of habit alone, reached up and grabbed the front of his shirt, as if John’s dog tags were still just under the layer of clothing. But they weren’t – they had been inside of a box under a thick layer of dirt for years. A lot of things had changed since the last time Sherlock had even thought about the people within the prison’s walls, Sherlock reminded himself, and then he made his way inside.
He didn’t see the point in it – the title of the article said it all: someone had seen him talking to Hannibal Lecter Magnussen, and they thought that meant that Sherlock was as much as a psychopath as Hannibal was. The fact that Kitty Riley wrote it solidified that theory for Sherlock, and made him not want to read it even more – she had always hated him, ever since he was a child. At this point, it didn’t matter to Sherlock what she, or what anyone else in the Capitol, thought of him. So what if she wrote the article? So what if everyone in the Capitol had read it? He was leaving the next day, anyway.
When they had first begun to do the packing, Sherlock had offered to pack up Mycroft’s room, until he got to his room with a box, and John supposed Sherlock realized at that point what packing up Mycroft’s room entailed: taking apart a room that Mycroft himself had set up specifically just to move it somewhere else. John wasn’t sure what would happen from that point; either his belongings would stay in boxes in the attic, or Sherlock would try to set up Mycroft’s room again in the spare bedroom, just to find that Sherlock would never be able to set it up in a way that his brother would approve of, because his brother could never approve or disapprove of anything Sherlock did ever again. All John had to do was glance at Sherlock, standing alone, frozen in Mycroft’s room, to know what was happening, and he immediately phoned Dean.
As he had gotten closer to them, they looked up at him, and Sherlock could tell that they all either knew him, or known of him, and now they all were curious as to what he could possibly want. He imagined he looked like a total mess – his eyes puffy and red, his hair matted to his forehead with sweat, his suit no longer flawless but instead covered in dirt and the blood he didn’t want to think about – but he didn’t care.
“You met with John?” Sherlock asked, his entire body straightening immediately, suddenly engrossed, anxious to get any information.
John’s head tilted slightly to the side before he could catch himself. Unfortunately, Snow picked up on it.
“You almost missed her,” another Peacekeeper – one from further away – noted.
“Not unless you and Mycroft drag me back to the Capitol,” Sherlock muttered.
What did he want to do in the future?
The three kids heal; Sherlock turns nineteen, John turns twenty, and Harry turns seventeen; Harry becomes part of a relationship; Sherlock finally asks for help; Sherlock and John's relationship improves drastically; Sherlock and John discuss the future.
“Of course – your brother and the closest thing you’ve got to a sister get out of the Hunger Games alive and you
They were silent for a few moments, listening to the sounds of celebration going on below. “It won’t matter after tomorrow, anyway,” Sherlock murmured. “That’s what I keep thinking – nothing’s going to matter after tomorrow. It’ll just be that Arena and Harry.”
Sherlock and John have a dispute over what happened the day before; Harry and Sherlock have their individual evaluations and are scored by the Gamemakers.
Oh! And Krh commented on my last update with "Dance," but they didn't put a number to it so I'm doing the third time it shows up because it's the cutest:
THERE'S ONLY THE TWO-PART EPILOGUE LEFT I'M SO CONCERNED
“I like your cooking too much,” Sherlock replied with a tight smile – one that didn’t quite meet his eyes.
There were three levels of living, when it came to the victors:
He slowly walked by the casket on his way to the stage, and found that he couldn’t pull his eyes away from his brother –
Sherlock had expected him to completely move on, but now that he had the proof – the proof that everything that he and John went through – everything he and John
Both of them.
“And I can tell that you’re angry –”
“Can you say Harry?” his sister asked.
“Your ego must be pretty small if you see a little bit of a shaky hand as indigent,” Sherlock muttered, and this brought a smile back to Hannibal’s face.
He then stepped forward, wrapped his hand around the back of her head, keeping it still, and pressed his forehead to hers.
The Bloodbath was over.
Sherlock wasn’t coming back –
He was eighteen years old.
“My name is Alan Patterson, I’m from District Ten, and my sister Margaret is in the Games.”
John!” he exclaimed, a huge grin spread across his face. “I didn’t know you had that in you!”
Again, he glanced, just for a moment, at Sherlock, but this time his eyes also dusted across Harry’s face, which caused her to stiffen in her seat beside him immediately. Hannibal had been confident that Charles Augustus was going to live, but he had died, thanks to two certain people who just happened to be sitting in that room.
“The Gamemakers probably just gave that part of the Arena Mycroft’s freezing temperatures, so the tributes wouldn’t just look at it and go in the opposite direction to avoid the whole thing.”
Magnussen grinned. “Not when I’m done with him,” he replied, winking.
“...Four...”
It was then they came to a stop at an intersection within the hallway – they could either go straight forward, to the left, or to the right. Going back the way they came was absolutely out of the question.
There are only a few more chapters left! I'm so weirded out by this I'm probably gonna cry at some point about it.
– because of me and Harry and the Games – but it was you all along. But how did you do it?” he asked, squinting at Magnussen, reading him. “He was suddenly
“It’s the memorial,” Sherlock replied before John could, and John eyed Sherlock wearily, as if he was asking him ‘are we actually going to have this conversation with him
“By the way – I’m impressed by your skill with a syringe back there in the Arena – it was amazing, honestly. It didn’t even bruise Sherlock or anything; for that being your first time even picking up a syringe that’s amazing.”
And, for a second, John found himself looking out through the crowd, trying to find the two people he wanted to see the most – the two people he would never be able to see again – his parents.
“Bracing herself? Really? We’re her two favorite people; she’s probably just as excited as I am.” He finished buttoning his shirt, looking at himself in the mirror in the room. John normally threw a sheet over the thing; he tried not to catch his own reflection, these days. “I don’t know why I’m doing this – we’re going to be shoved into monkey suits as soon as we get home.”
His brother was dead –
Then he had turned and Janine was already rushing to attack him – to kill him – but Sherlock was quick to defend himself – and attack her. She was able to block his blows a few times, but not enough – and soon Janine Hawkins – Amanda’s sister – soon she was bleeding on the ground, her stomach and intestines oozing out of her body –
Within fifteen minutes, Sherlock was able to wake up both Watson siblings (much to their distaste), insist that they needed to get dressed and that he’d explain what was going on once they were, and lock himself in his room long enough to shoot up, shower, and get dressed, himself.
– because he couldn’t be touched. And then...” He covered his eyes with his hand, and wrapped his other arm around his chest, as if holding himself together. “He felt me up through my pants,” he admitted, his voice wet with tears. “And he kissed me.”
Dance, Dance - Fall Out Boy (overall Johnlock feelings)
After a second, Louise looked down and realized that none of them had moved.
was the president, now.
John glanced at Alexander’s hands, which held the rolled-up version of what John assumed to be the newspaper in question, and then he looked to Dean.
“Oh my god,” she whispered.
In reply, he kissed John deeply, wordlessly promising him that he’d be back.
He looked up at his boyfriend to find him grinning like a child.
secrets,” he promised, and he heard the exhale of breath that was John’s laugh.
“No,” Sherlock insisted, inching forward.
“That’s how it normally is, isn’t it?” he asked. “Me, knowing everything I need to know almost immediately, then waiting for you to catch up?”
(I think I ended up taking this bit out but the Johncroft hashtags are my favorite running joke in the bloopers so it's staying)
“Well, keep in mind I know nothing and I’ve got a bad leg, would you?” John requested as they got into starting position: Sherlock’s hand on John’s waist, John’s hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, and their free hands holding the other’s.
Gasps and cries of horror flew through the crowd. John’s eyes snapped shut as he swallowed back the vomit that had suddenly risen in his throat, still unable to look at his boyfriend or his sister, even though he could feel their eyes on him. He had known this was coming – Snow had threatened him to make a choice mere hours ago – but that didn’t stop his knees from weakening, or his heart from trying to pound out of his chest as the need to be sick on stage worsened.
Ice Monster - Minus the Bear (for Sherlock's need to protect Harry)
All it took was John’s fallen expression for Sherlock to realize his body was betraying him; he was shaking so badly his teeth were chattering.
“You sure you’re okay?” she asked again, and Sherlock felt himself nodding.
Nine years. Three thousand, two hundred, eighty-seven days. So much has happened over those nine years in the world and for me personally, and this fic has been through it all with me, like a friend I always needed. I graduated college writing this; I started three different jobs writing this; I’ve moved and said goodbye to pets and said hello to new ones writing this; I’ve made friends and lost friends while writing this; I even went through my first emergency room visit while writing this (and even went to the emergency room
“We should not be forced to carry this weight,” he mumbled, and then looked at John, continuing on as if he hadn’t spoken. “When I was on my Victory Tour, the ‘Ice Man’ returned,” he revealed, swaying his head slightly to the side as he recited his title, as if mocking it. He inhaled again, and spoke as he breathed out, holding his breath in each pause that he made: “Become. A stone. John. It’s the only way I’ve found to survive this life.”
And then, a different snowball blew past Sherlock and knocked Mycroft’s hat right off of his head. Sherlock turned and found John already scooping up snow for the next attack.
Make You Better - The Decemberists (for Sherlock and John's reunion)
“YOU LEFT HIM! YOU LET HIM DIE!” he shouted, and Alexander tried to explain himself as John and Harry struggled to pull Sherlock off of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
After John returned from running errands, he called for a family meeting, where he laid out a plan that he and Alexander had come up with early that morning: there was a support group in District 6 for the surviving victors who had gotten themselves addicted to Morphling, and Sherlock was now expected to go to them. Sherlock didn’t argue, until John informed him that they were the same night as John’s support group meeting, and that, to ensure that Sherlock would go to his meetings, John would have to miss his to go to District 6 with Sherlock. The moment Sherlock opened his mouth, Harry opened hers, making the offer to take Sherlock to his meetings for John, so John could continue to get the help he needed, as well. John began to remind Harry that she had school to worry about, but she shrugged it off, promising to get the work she missed and to do it on the train – if she had any questions, she conveniently had a genius with her to ask for help (even if he didn’t know the earth revolved around the sun).
“There is a reason for holding a separate service for Mycroft, and it’s important that this reason is known: Mycroft Holmes was the leader of the Mockingjay Rebellion. He started everything nine years ago, after being declared the winner of the sixty-sixth Hunger Games. He planned everything out; he traveled to each District and made alliances, he did all of the work, and we wouldn’t be here – we wouldn’t be
“Like you and Jim Moriarty weren’t so different after all,” John guessed quietly, his voice a monotone, just barely realizing that he had said Moriarty’s name for the first time since he had returned home from
“No,” he replied.
And soon, the sound of those seventeen words were the only thing that filled the small space. His voice was hoarse, he was tired, but he kept going, kept repeating the words, afraid that if he stayed silent within that dark, cramped room, for even a moment, he’d go crazy.
For the first person, at least, the three kids only asked questions that they forgot as soon as they asked them, and marking down where he belonged with no reasons as to why written in the comment box, until Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s turn came around.
“Torn-a-kit,” he mumbled.
“I won’t,” Sherlock promised him, but Hannibal was approaching the door.
aren’t saying Mycroft’s name.”
“John!” Connie exclaimed, surprised.
“Nice job, Aurora.” Charles Augustus Magnussen said, and strode proudly over the corpse, undid his fly, took himself out, and took a piss on James’ body.
want to do this? Because if you don’t want to we don't have to –”
“Thank you, everyone,” Mycroft said, after a moment. “You may have noticed someone isn’t here.” He gesturing to the empty seat on the opposite side of the table. “I did not invite Hannibal Lecter Magnussen today, and the reason why is simple: I believe he is dangerous, and no matter what we do, his thinking cannot be modified. I do not believe he can understand the weight this bears on all of us, and so, for everyone’s safety, I made sure he had no idea we were going to meet. Also, in the interest of safety, if his brother, Charles Augustus, is killed, I ask that whoever’s sibling kills him comes to find me immediately; we all know that Hannibal will be seeking revenge.”
“Mycroft and I...we were...” he started, trying to figure out how to word it, and finally he sighed. “It’s complicated.”
He thought back, back to when Dean had given Sherlock Mycroft’s possessions – just yesterday, amazingly –
He scrubbed and scrubbed at his entire body, digging his finger nails into every inch of his skin until it hurt, until red and raw from the water became red and raw from scrubbing too hard.
“Do you really think that this is just wine?” he asked.
If he continued like this, he
“Just...let them think what they want to think?” Sherlock looked to John for confirmation, and John nodded, and together they looked back at Mycroft.
“I need to talk to you.”
John tried to sleep through Heath, the oldest victor in the group, as he got up and left his room, beginning his daily routine, but it only left him tossing and turning on the sitting room sofa, just as he had for the past five hours. He finally decided to give up on the idea of sleep two hours later, at eight in the morning, when a few of the other early risers got up. Alexander was the last one to get up, and once he left his room at about 9:30, breakfast was served by the Avoxes. It surprised John, however, when Mycroft arrived just as John had finished filling up his plate.
brother...it’s safe to say that I’ve never known a world without Mycroft Holmes.” Sherlock’s voice broke, and he hated how he was this choked up this early into the speech, but he pushed on. “Now, Mycroft – he had just turned seven years old when I was born; he could very easily live without me; honestly, I think he would’ve had a lot less anxiety in his life if he didn’t have me around – but, unfortunately, that’s not the way things worked out.
“I know you’re not the biggest fan of children but…I think you’d like them,” Sherlock said quietly, feeling silly for speaking out loud to the statue, but not necessarily minding – this was the closest he could ever get to speaking with his brother, again. “I miss you,” he added, even quieter. “I wish you were here. I
Idk about any of you, but my anxiety's WAY UP ON TOP OF THE ROOF AND IS ABOUT TO JUMP OFF SOMEBODY COME GET HER with this corona thing (aw look I just super dated the publishing of this fic) but hey! This chapter's cute and somewhat happy! So that's good and wasn't planned at all!
