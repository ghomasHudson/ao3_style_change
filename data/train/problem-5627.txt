And Steve, like I said, none of us knew this was gonna happen. Whether they had succeeded when we were away or not they would probably have gotten him somehow some other time.
By the end of Tony's story he was crying and shaking. Steve himself had tears running down his face and was holding Tony like his life depended on it until he heard Tony's broken voice.
!’ Was Bucky's first thought ‘
He looked the man who had hurt his sweetheart over and realized that this man was Tony's father.
Alright guys! Last chapter! This has been one hell of a ride and I want to thank you all for sharing this experience with me and I love each and every single one of you! Thank you all for the kudos and comments they have really motivated me to write and evolve my English vocabulary! <3
“Ouch Nat! What was that for!?”
The rest of his body wasn't faring any better, he wore a black T- shirt several sizes too big for him but it had torn so you could see his chest and a bit of his stomach. Cuts, bruises, burn marks covered the young man and there was a large wound in the middle of his chest that looked extremely painful and there was a start of an infection. He had some broken fingers on each hand and his left arm was twisted in an unnatural angle. There was a steadily bleeding bullet wound on one of his thighs and Natasha immediately removed her jacket and put pressure on it.
“Come on darling” he said while putting the food in the fridge “let's rest a bit until they get back. Everything will be just fine.” He grabbed her hand, placed a gentle kiss on it and led her to the living room.
The blonde grabbed his hand and they started to walk in comfortable silence. When they were about to step into the kitchen again Tony suddenly stopped. Steve looked at him with a frown.
He made it home in record time but stopped outside the apartment building. Three strange identical cars were parked outside next to Bruce's, Tony wondered who's it might be since there weren't many random people coming to these parts of town. And what was Bruce doing home?
Tony gasped and arched his back when he felt Steve's tongue lap across his hole and he was gripping the sheets tightly. His cock was hard and leaking pre-come onto his stomach while he squirmed.
“Jarvis, Ana.” Bruce spoke up softly “we need to tell you something, but you should probably sit down first.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the couple couldn't reach the team they unlocked the door with a spare key that Steve had provided for them in case anything were to happen. They reluctantly stepped into the empty mansion and dread spread through their bodies while they walked in since they knew that the mansion was never left unsupervised.
Steve didn't ask his friend how he was holding up, he already knew the answer to that.
“No, I'll tell you.
“Oh Tony” Howard tsk’d “Tony, Tony, Tony, whatever am I going to do with you?” The older Stark slowly stepped forward with every word with his hands clasped behind his back and a cruel smirk on his lips. He bent down so that he was right in front of the injured boy and lightly, almost caringly stroked the boys hair. Tony tried to flinch back but got dizzy in the process so he settled for putting all the heat he could into the glare he sent Howard and hoped that the older man would get blood hon his hand.
He just gave them a small smile and put his phone back in the pocket of his (Steve's) hoodie.
A large man leaned on the glass door next to the young genius and smirked down at him. Said genius didn't notice as he was putting the milk in his basket until the man spoke up.
Tony didn't notice how Tiberius shoulders and smile tensed even more, how his eyes hardened and how his jaw twitched.
He just hoped they weren't to late.
“That's tough man.”
The Avengers looked at each other uncomfortably. How could they have forgotten to tell the Jarvises that the boy they loved as a son had been kidnapped by his own father and past abuser and had God knows what done to him?
Despite the playful reply, Tony put on the much larger shirt and discreetly inhaled its scent, loving the fact that he could smell Steve all over it.
“Well he is right, thank you.” He took a small sip and let out a little moan at the taste. This was some of the best coffee he’s ever had. Steve licked his lips at the sound and trailed his eyes down Tony's throat and watches his Adam's apple bob with every swallow. The blue eyes trailed down the nicely toned chest and stopped at the hips. The sweatpants had gone down a bit, showing some of the deliciously tanned skin. Tony saw where Steve was staring and smirked behind the coffee cup.
He took a shuddering breath and was about to stand up to find a way out when a pling came from the door and it was slowly opening and there stood the three men that had managed to turn his life into a living hell.
Thank all of you who have stuck with me and reading this crap, it means so much to me you have no idea. I admit, I have been postponing finishing this chapter because I didn't really want it to end. I love all of you guys so much and I am so grateful for you all.
Figuring that we wouldn't be able to go back to sleep he stood up on shaking legs and slowly made his way to the bathroom and to take a shower, petting DUM-E comfortingly.
Tony snapped out of his thoughts when Steve sucked on a very sensitive spot below his jaw. He let out a loud moan and tugged on the blonde's shirt, trying to take it off. Steve let go of Tony's neck so that he could take off the shirt and went right back to sucking marks on the tanned flesh.
They all stopped what they were doing when Steve, who was currently sitting on the couch with his laptop on his lap, shot up from his seat while trying not to collapse from the lack of sleep and food.
“Thanks Buck, I know he should be able to make his own decisions, I know that! But I just have a bad feeling about this guy, you know?”
Stone looked down on him more like a disappointed parent who had caught their kid with a hand down the cookie jar rather than someone who was about to make his life a living hell.
He took a shuddering breath and felt his heart pounding in his chest. When he calmed down a bit be turned around and was met by probably the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.
Tony reached his hand out to cup the blonde's cheek and turned his face towards his so that they were forced to make eye contact.
Steve slowly got out of the bed without waking Tony and put on a pair of sweatpants he found on the floor. He pulled the covers of the bed so that they were covering the geniuses still naked body and went to the door. He opened it and saw the whole team standing there in a circle while Natasha was glaring at Clint who was rubbing the back of his head where she had smacked him.
“How is this your fault?”
Tony pulled away from Steve and the larger man looked down on him questioning.
“Fuck yes, Steve baby!”
Thor, Bucky and Bruce were sitting by the dining table and going through the security feeds from where Tony had been taken outside the cafe, trying to see if they had missed anything while passing around the pot of coffee between them and drinking straight from it (they had given up on using mugs after the fourth pot).
“Oh, Tony my darling! You have gotten too skinny. Those bastards! Thinking that they can get away with hurting my boy. I'll show them, you'll see, just wait until I get my hands on that Rumlow. I may be getting older but that doesn't mean I won't tear him to shreds when I see him.”
“Where the hell do you think you have been, you worthless piece of shit!? Huh!? Who do you think you are!? To run away from me! You are my property, you bastard! You are nothing but my punching bag! And who was that blonde lug you were all over!? And the rest of those parasites with him!? You're probably whoring yourself out to all of them! Are you that desperate!? You must be real cheap for them to be using somethings as fat and ugly as you! When we get back home you are gonna get a punishment unlike anything you have ever seen before, you worthless whore!”
They washed each other and with only a few make out sessions in between. They stepped out and dried themselves off and went to get dressed.
He turned his head back and saw the entire team standing a few feet back, looking at his friends suspiciously. Steve in particular was staring at the arm Rhodey had wrapped around his waist and clenched his fists.
The waiter, a fairly handsome man who looked like he was in his later twenties, took their orders and kept sending Tony small winks and smiles which caused Steve to tighten his hold on him and only relaxed when the man had left.
(And this is also my first time writing smut so reviews would be greatly appreciated! <3)
“Steve?”
“What? Can you blame me? I've been stuck with hospital food for a week! And this smells like heaven.”
Tony felt the pain in his ass more than the rest of his body and he could feel the blood slowly running down the crack.
“Oh Clint, we all know that Bruce's favorite is Tony. He has some weird, mystical power that makes him irresistible. Just look at Steve! Our brave and fearless leader turns into a gooey mess and I'm pretty sure that Natasha would stab everyone in here if something happened to her small person.”
Then I woke up in a room and these guys stepped  in, they said their names were Schmidt and Rumlow. Anyway, after they left some thugs came and dragged me to an empty room where I was locked in. Everyday Rumlow would come in and torture me. Every day he came up with something new, sometimes he beat me with his bare hands and sometimes he used tools like knives and fire. Some days it would be Schmidt who came in and tried to get me to talk, they wanted information about the Avengers. He wouldn't do anything but talk, those were the days where I could focus on healing and how to get out of there.
“Yeah babydoll, take it!”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated!
Tony let go of his two friends and headed over to his boyfriend who wrapped an arm around him immediately and used his free hand to cup his cheek. Steve's thumb wiped away the tears that were drying on his cheek and gave him a worried look.
“Goodbye Anthony” he huffed out “I'll see you soon and I expect you to be on your best behavior, oh, and do me a favor will you? Be nice to the boys, they're just doing me a favor after all.” And with that he shut the door, leaving Tony to the cold and his thoughts.
‘Perhaps the project mr Stark and his companions are working on is more sensitive then he mentioned?’ Jarvis thought. But that did little to subdue the growing feeling of unease that had taken place in his stomach, especially since mr Stark had only gone down once after the first day the men had entered his home.
“Oh friend Anthony! While your heart and attitude might be mighty, I must admit that your physical form is not one of a warrior, though not unappealing.” The gigantic blonde wiggled his eyebrows before a pair of familiar arms were wrapped around Tony and pulled him into a large chest. Steve started to kiss his neck while mumbling “mine”. Tony just chuckled while trying to contain a moan and fed Steve the last piece of his waffle. A loud groan was heard from Clint and then a cry of pain when Natasha smacked him.
“He's eighteen!?”
“You drugged me…”
He loved the Avengers dearly, they were his family, and he knew they loved him back just as much. Everything was great, especially things between him and Steve.
“Mama” Tony managed to croak out weakly as he buried his face in her neck and breathing in the comforting scent of her shampoo.
“Why not?”
“Clinton. Get over here. Now.”
After a few minutes Steve slowly nodded and backed away, never leaving the woman with his eyes and sat down and started to search for more HYDRA bases.
“It's okay bambino, it's okay, shhh, mama is here now, I've got you. And I promise that I'll never leave you again for as long as I live.” The words were followed by her gently stroking his hair and kissing the top of his head.
“Then there was the day when I escaped. Rumlow came into my room and beat me some before he stopped. Then he… He- he r-raped me. I- I managed to stab him in the neck with a shard of glass I had gotten the day before and that's when I left. And then I managed to get to the control room and contacted you guys. I found out that HYDRA had a room that contained their weapons and explosives. I managed to get there and hack their systems so that I could set them off after 10 minutes since that's how long it was supposed to take me to get into a safe distance. Unfortunately I got caught by some of the HYDRA agents but managed to escape before everything blew up. That's why I couldn't get into a safer distance.”
“Let me guess. You are thinking about how this is all your fault, aren't you?”
“I am sorry Steven, but Brock Rumlow has escaped.”
“Are you kidding me? This is amazing. I really don't mind.”
“That's Mr and Mrs Jarvis for you.”
When he felt sated he turned his head away from the glass and his mother helped him lay down again before tucking the blanket over him. His thoughts went back in time to when he was a little boy and had gotten sick and how his mama used to spend the whole time in his room with him, hovering and doting while Jarvis and Ana would come in and out with warm soups and tea, making sure they both had everything he needed or simply just to spend some time with him so that he wouldn't get bored and so that Maria could get a break from her constant worry.
“Well, according to Phil you didn't hit any major arteries so he couldn't bleed out, though he did faint so that's probably why you thought he was dead. He woke up a while after you left and tried to get away from the base, probably because Schmidt would have his head for losing you. Though he didn't make it very far because of the explosion, burned half his body, he was unconscious when Phil found him.”
“It's okay Honeybear, he's dead. Jack Rollins is dead.”
“Wait, wait wait. What about the team?” He said out of breath. Steve just kept kissing his neck, mumbling a quiet “they're out” and moved to suck at Tony's earlobe. Tony's breath hitched and he closed his eyes in bliss. Steve moved his hands under Tony's shirt and pulled it off the genius. Tony pushed Steve back on the couch so that his back was resting against the arm of the couch. Steve looked up on his boyfriend in surprise since it was mostly Steve who was the more dominant of the two. Tony just smirked at him and draped his leg over Steve so that he was straddling him. The brunette dove his head down and started to kiss and suck on Steve's neck while also grinding their cocks on each other. The blonde put his hands on the exposed waist and rubbed the hipbones with his thumbs.
“Shut up Barnes! Are you not the one that promised me that nothing would happen!?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He hadn't noticed the whole team looking at him and wait in for answers, to busy trying not to show his exhaustion.
“Doctor Banner called me when- when you were taken. He gave us the address to this house and we have been here since, waiting for you to come back. My goodness Anthony, do you have any idea how worried we have been? We didn't know where you were or what was happening to you. You would think that we would be used to you getting kidnapped but it scares us just as much every damn time!”
“Fuck!”
“Why have we not been informed about this until now!?” The tone in Ana’s voice had heightened as she waited for an answer from the man in front of her.
Then he headed back over to Steve's side and laced his fingers together with the blonde's and looked at his oldest friends.
Alright, this is just another short filler chapter and hopefully next one will be ready in a couple days.
Tony's arms were suddenly pinned beside his head that was dangling out of the mattress and he looked up to see Tiberius grinning down on him. He felt his breath quicken when he saw that the blonde was completely naked down the waist and that his cock was rock hard with precum dripping out of the slit. He proceeded to struggle even harder but he was still weak from the hit and his tormentors grips were solid.
The two men started to leave the room and before Tony could think he called out.
“It was Thor’s idea, he is very proud of it.”
“See anything you like?”
“I want this kitchen spotless and you all cleaned up and ready by the door when I come down. You are buying me pancakes.”
"Tony, are you up yet?" Came the familiar voice from behind the door.
“Rumlow, report.” The man brought his walkie talkie up to his mouth and reported.
Tony started to squirm around, trying to break loose but the blond just kept holding him close.
“Because he doesn't annoy me as much as you do.” Was Bruce's calm reply. The scientist hadn't even looked up from the stove when he answered and was unable to see Clint pouting and snuggling closer to Natasha.
He left and slammed the door behind him. Tony was still shaking and crying, trying to breathe through the pain which was hard considering that one of his broken ribs were poking at his right lung. He cried out while pulling himself up in a sitting position and leaned against the wall. He focused on his breathing and looked over his injuries. There was nothing that seemed fatal so he ignored it for now, they would only reopen again tomorrow if he tried to fix them up. He didn't need a mirror to know that he looked awful. His body was littered with dark bruises, cuts and burns, some were almost healed while many were brand new. He just prayed that it was Schmidt that would come tomorrow and not Brock, just so that he could have a day to heal a bit.
“Only for you, Doll.”
God why do I like to hurt this boy?
He looked through the blueprints and found his way to the weapons room which, luckily, was only a few door away from his current location.
“And you guys have been here the whole time?”
Howard stood up from the dirty floor and wiped his chin up flinched when he came in contact with the wound. He sent a nasty glare at Tony who just tried to suppress the smirk threatening to break out on his bloody lips. Howard's blood covered his lips and ran down his chin and dripped down on the floor beneath him. The young genius relished in the small feeling of vengeance and success, to be able to make Howard feel a fracture of the pain he had been feeling his whole life thanks his father.
Tony gave a tired smile to his lover. Seeing Ty again had brought back memories from the time he had run away. The feelings of betrayal, sadness, fear and hopelessness had all come crashing back along with them and it had left Tony feeling emotionally drained for the day. And the fact that he had to see Ty again in the afternoon the same day just left him feeling anxious and dreadful.
But instead of calling her out on her lie he offered something he knew she would enjoy.
Steve lied down on his and Tony's bed and clutched the brunettes pillow against his chest and inhaled the lingering scent. No matter how sad it sounded, he would clutch it to his chest every night, pretending like it was Tony, that he was safe here in his arms and that nobody would be able to harm him again.
By the end of his little speech both of the scientists had tears welling up in their eyes. Bruce dragged Tony into a hug and Tony had to contain a gasp. Bruce usually didn't like physical contact and for him to be the one reaching out was something Tony had almost never seen before and he wasn't about to waste the opportunity and hugged him back. They stayed like that for a few seconds before they both pulled away and wiped the unshed tears from their eyes. Bruce chuckled before starting the car up again and started to drive.
Meanwhile an unknown man stood and looked towards the apartment building that both geniuses lived with an evil smirk playing out on his face.
“Jesus Christ, Tony, don't do that again.”
Steve sped the car as fast as he could, not caring about anything else but to get to Tony. The rest of the team were squeezed in the car with him, shouting to each other but he couldn't hear anything but the blood rushing in his ears and his heart felt like it was about to leap out of his chest.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Oh thank God!” Clint exclaimed “does that mean that we can sleep now?”
Putting away the memory Tony quickened his pace to the kitchen and was met by a steaming mug of coffee on the table and Bruce standing next to it with a plate with small cake and a lit candle in it.
“Everything okay Doll?”
“Yeah. Anyway, we should probably go get our things, I want to be back before Tony wakes up.”
“Fine, let's get waffles.”
“God yes! Please everything you said. Please Steve please!”
When everyone had left, Bruce and Tony sat down on the couch in silence. The silence was eventually broken by Bruce.
“What.. I mean.. How…” Tony stuttered “How are you here? How did you know where I was?”
“She'll we go?” Tony suggested
“Y-you can move now.”
“Are you sure that you're okay?”
Not that he would need any of it.
The door suddenly opened and two men stepped in. The first man wore a big smile and started to talk.
Tony took deep breaths, this isn't the first time he had gotten kidnapped. It happened a few times when he still lived with Howard by people who wanted money. Of course Howard stopped paying after the first two times and the three times after that Tony had been forced to save himself.
"Good morning Nicky!" Tony singsonged on his way in.
Tony sighed with relief and slumped into Steve’s side. He was very grateful for the lack of great injuries. He threw the blanket off of him and saw that he was only in a hospital gown. He could practically feel Steve’s eyes trailing up his legs and the rest of his body and the brunette just gave him a small smirk.
Kudos and comments are always appreciated <3
“I’m so sorry my dear, but it is. But now we must find a way to save our boy.” The couple looked at each other and clutched their hands together in an attempt to comfort each other.
“Stop the car.”
“I was talking to Erik Lehnsherr, boss of the Brotherhood mob. He told us to meet him at the Hellfire club tomorrow afternoon before it opens to discuss what he can do to help us.”
“Crap crap crap crap…”
He asked with a raised eyebrow.
Il mio cuore- my heart
“Likewise Captain.” he said with a smile and got off Erik’s lap.
“I wanna go home.”
He also used it as a distraction from all the anger he was feeling. He had barely kept his emotions under control while Tony was in surgery and he felt like seconds away from exploding and hunting down every member of HYDRA when Cho had mentioned that he had been raped.
Tony blushed and hid his head behind his hands, Steve just put a hand on his knee and squeezed slightly and sent an unimpressed look to the team, though no one mentioned the slight blush on his cheeks.
Comments and kudos are always appreciated! <3
He was cut off by Tony's lips pressed against his own. He sighed and kissed back. When Tony broke the kiss he smiled warmly at the blonde and took his hand in his own much smaller one.
“Yeah?”
“Lactose free milk?”
Tony just closed his eyes and sighed. He felt Steve rubbing his back, trying to comfort him while feeling the tension build within himself.
“Yes, yes… Okay Aunty, thank you… Mmmhhh, really? Okay, well, tell Uncle Danny I said hi, okay, yeah, love you to, bye!”
Steve looked up at the genius with wide eyes. Tony usually wasn't this vocal during sex, he mostly let out beautiful moans and whimpers while Steve handled the dirty talk that caused them. Seeing Tony take control like this drove him wild and he felt pride swelling in his chest at the thought of Tony being so comfortable in their relationship that he was willing to take control for once. He couldn't help but to let out a loud “Fuck yes!” and silently thanked God that the team was out. If they saw him like this they'd never let either him or Tony live it down. Or maybe just him, since Natasha doesn't let anyone mess with Tony without severe consequences.
Tony couldn't care less and instead took lung filling breaths while attempting to ignore the other man who was currently violating him.
“It's okay Tony, I'll promise that we’ll visit and now we can call each other all the time. And remember, if you ever need anything, just call us and we’ll be there.”
“Please, she won't let anyone tease you and you know that you have to be really stupid or Clint to dare to go against her.”
I know, I know, please don't hate me. I've been really trying to write this but I have never been so stressed in my life like I am right now. I had two major tests to study for (and my asshole teachers decided to put them on the same day) and I have been focusing so much on them so I didn't have time to write this, but now the tests are over and I finally had some time to finish this chapter and it turned out pretty good if I get to say so myself and it's longer than my other ones.
“Yes, I want to do it, with you.”
He then went inside the elevator and pressed the button that would take him to the third floor where their apartment was. He walked out the elevator and dug up his keys and opened the door.
Steve kept pounding into him, seeking his own orgasm and when Tony's walls clenched around him he released deep into his ass, filling his lover up.
Everyone dropped the subject when Bruce put two plates filled with waffles on the table and started to dig in.
Bucky just smiled and clapped him again. He headed towards the entrance where Tony had left and grabbed his handgun on the way and then left to follow the young genius.
“Oh.”
Pepper looked close to tears and her hands were trembling. Rhodey didn't look any better himself. His jaw was clenched and it looked like he was trying to fight back tears.
“Hey baby.” Tony finally managed to open his eyes and after hey adjusted to the light they immediately went to the blonde figure sitting next to him with his hand in their grasp and smiling gently at him.
They made out for a few seconds before Steve pulled away and reached for the drawer to get the lube. When he got it he settled so that he was sitting in between Tony's legs and looking down on his panting lover.
Jarvis and Ana had to go back to the Stark mansion a couple days ago so that Howard wouldn't get suspicious. They still came over whenever they could though and called almost everyday.
Suddenly a large hand gripped his arm and turned him around, shoved him into the sink.
“He is right Tony. You are safer here since nobody knows about this location. And we will only be gone for a couple of hours and you will have Clint here with you.”
Bruce only lowered his eyes so that he wouldn't have to meet Tony's own. His shoulders slumped and he suddenly looked around ten years older than he actually was.
They showered together, trying to hurry and Steve helped Tony avoid getting much water on his face since it gave him panic attacks. Most of Tony's nightmares were about the waterboarding and he started shaking if he even thought about it too much.
Steve's eyes went wide and his mouth hung open. Seeing the nervousness on Tony's face snapped him out of it.
Tony looked around at his friends who were all staring at him, waiting for him to explain what had happened. Tony felt tears well up in his eyes and let out a choked sob. Large arms were wrapped protectively around him and he looked up to see Steve holding him while telling the team to step out for a moment. Everyone but Steve left while sending worried looks to the sobbing genius.
He rubbed his fingers together while lying down so that his face was directly in front of the hole, trying to warm the lube up before circling his index finger around Tony's entrance. He looked at Tony who nodded at him and he slowly pushed his finger inside. He stopped for a moment, letting Tony adjust before slowly moving it. Tony moaned from above him at the new sensation. After a while Steve had three fingers in Tony's ass and the teen was moaning and panting loud.
“Mom?” He coughed, his throat to dry to form any full sentences. Maria stood up and fetched the glass and pitcher of water on the table next to his hospital bed and poured him a glass. She helped him sit up and brought the glass to his lips with one hand as she held his head with the other and gently stroked his hair.
Tony burst out laughing and looked around at his team with a smile.
They fell asleep like that, Steve holding Tony close to his chest and their legs tangled together and perfectly happy.
“Listen, I don't know what this whore has told you or made you pay him for his… Services, but I'll pay you double up if you let me take him and you'll never be forced to see him again, I swear.”
“Where could they be?” She asked while biting her lip, a nervous habit of hers.
I really hope that you'll like this chapter even though it's basically just a filler and hopefully you'll still be here when the next chapter comes up (which hopefully is soon)!
“I love you too.”
(See the end of the chapter for
When Howard didn't move from his spot Natasha stepped forward and gripped his shoulder tightly before basically dragging him out of the cafe, screaming how “you aren't getting away with this” and “you will hear from my lawyers”. No one was concerned, the Avengers were very well known off and no lawyer would go against them unless they had a death wish.
Steve kept speeding, not caring about anything but to get to Tony, hoping it wasn't too late. He heard his teammate yelling Tony's name through the phone and running around the house without receiving any answers. Steve's heart kept pounding in his chest and he could feel the eyes of his teammates on the back of his neck.
you find him.” Raven, who had been silent the entire time, spoke up. “Because our tracker didn't only see the two of them, she followed them. To Stark mansion.”
Tony and Steve just stared at each other for a whole minute afterwards. Tony with embarrassment and Steve with fear. Suddenly Tony let out a bark of laughter and reached his hand out to Steve. The blonde did not hesitate to grab it and was next to his baby at an instant and helping Tony to sit up straight. After he made sure that he was comfortable he pulled the smaller man into a hug, basically pulling him into his lap.
"Yeah, Bruce. Just give me a minute and I'll be up" came Tony's groggy response.
“Then why the hell are you gonna see this douchebag?!” Clint cried out.
Tony looked around him, feeling helpless. He lowered his gun and one of the goons that had been flanking Schmidt stepped forward and reached for the weapon.
Steve wrapped his arms around the smaller man and kissed him on the forehead.
The woman, Natasha, didn't break her glare as she lowered her gun and stepped back to sit next to the injured man.
“God, Doll, you're so tight.”
After what felt like hours but was actually twenty minutes they reached the hospital and Steve immediately grabbed Tony and carried him bridal style into the main entrance, Bruce and Bucky hot on his heels.
“Thank you for meeting us mr Lehnsherr.” Steve said gratefully while settling down on the opposite side of the table from Erik. Natasha, Bruce, Clint, Bucky and Thor sat down on either side of him.
He dismissed them but before they left the room he said one final thing to Steve with a sweet smile on the whole time.
Jarvis slowly woke up at the sound of his name being called, the voice sounded like it was spoken through water. He blinked his heavy eyelids open and was met by a bright light shining directly into his eyes. He groaned and tried to roll away from it when a soft hand carded itself through his hair. Now he opened his eyes fully and turned his head to the owner of the hand. He saw his lovely wife smiling worriedly at him and he relaxed immediately. He sat up on the bed he had been placed on and grabbed Ana's hand.
Tony looked at the smirking archer and flipped him off and just as he opened his mouth to answer, a voice spoke up from the entrance of the room.
“You okay?”
“Thank god no.”
Tony's thoughts were brought back to the present when he felt his mothers hand gently stroke the hair on his head. He met her eyes, identical to his own, and could see the deep sorrow and love within them. He tore his gaze away to scan the rest of the room and found out that it was empty besides the two of them. He felt his heart break as thoughts of his friends and lover leaving him after everything they had gone through, after everything he had gone through. He tried to ignore Rumlow’s and Tiberius voices in his head, telling him how worthless he was, how stupid he'd been to actually think that they would still be with him after this whole ordeal. He was tainted now, dirty. Tears formed in his eyes and he tried to blink them away before his mother saw, but it was to late, Maria had already caught a glimpse of the pain and loss in her son's eyes and her heart broke for him.
Fury drove like a madman trying to get the kid to the mansion where most of the Avengers lived. He had barely parked the car before he ran out and around the car to get Tony out. He carried him bridal style to the door and kicked the door in with his leg.
Tony looked to his side and saw that it was Steve that had spoken up. Dang even his voice was sexy, Tony thought to himself.
“What are we Steve?”
And always remember! Comments and kudos are always treasured!
Steve started to pick up speed until he was basically pounding into the smaller man and changed his angle slightly which made Tony gasp loudly and arch his back from the bed and Steve knew that he had found his prostrate. He smiled and kept pounding into him while Tony basically screamed in pleasure.
Steve opened his mouth to reply but he didn't manage to get any words out. Shock and horror hit him like a wave at the newly acquired information. He was too lost in his thoughts that he wasn't able to answer Erik.
"Hey Bruce, we closed early today so I thought- WHAT THE FUCK!?!?"
Tiberius Stone that abandoned you when you needed him the most and the reason you ended up on the street?”
"So, if I've got this right." He said and looked up "You are a part of a mob, but you aren't really criminals, you only try to keep the city safe, but you are technically only their doctor and occasionally help out in fights..."
When they got out he spotted the team by the table and managed to muster out a little shout.
The doctor didn't reply to that, just smiled slightly and just kept attending to his wounds. It wasn't that bad really, the rest of the team had managed to block most of his hits so there was only a couple of bruises and a cut on his lip and cheek that didn't even need stitches.
Before he could protest he was pulled into Steve's chest and his lips were pressed on his own. He struggled a few seconds before slowly melting into the kiss. When they finally pulled away Tony's lips were red and a little swollen and his eyes were wide open. Steve took a hold of his chin and looked directly into his eyes.
I see that's it's been a while since the last update... Ops...
After about twenty minutes of Bruce talking Tony had his head in his hands.
“No, no, I'm fine. I just have a bad feeling, that's all. Like something is about to happen, something bad.”
“Do what?”
Tony had almost reached the table when Ty looked up and saw him. A large grin spread across his face and he motioned for the small brunette to take a seat. Tony sat down in front of him and kept silent, waiting for the blonde to speak up first, because after all, he is the one who wanted to meet up.
“What's wrong Tony, are you in pain? Tell me what's wrong.”
Tony shot straight up on his bed, covered in sweat  and barely contained a scream. His heart was beating fast and his breathing was heavy. He sat like that for a few minutes, not noticing DUM-E’s worried beeping by his side. When his heart and breathing had gone back to normal he swallowed thickly and rubbed his eyes, wiping away tears.
“WAKE UP!!!!!!!”
He looked around to see that he was in a plainly white room with no windows and a door on the wall in front of him. He was laying on a small bed and his shirt and shoes were gone, leaving him only in his jeans and socks. He remembered going to the grocery store and then… Nothing.
The whole team was staring now, waiting to see what happens next.
“Steve, come on, we gotta get him to a hospital.”
“I want you to come inside me.”
Tony woke up to his alarm clock going off at 6.30 a.m and DUM-E poking him to get him up, like most mornings. He groaned and started to reach his hand out to press the snooze button on his phone but caught himself and he turned it off instead. He sat up on his bed and dragged his fingers through his hair. His hand got stuck in the dark curls a couple of times and he just sat there and debated whether it was worth getting up and go to work or if he should just lay down and go back to sleep.
a single tear escape his eye because of you, should you ever hurt him… I swear I will hunt you down to the end of the world if I have to and I will not rest before I have killed you in the most painful way imaginable. Mark my words Captain, nobody will ever hurt my son again as long as I live and no one can stop me. Mob boss or not I will not hesitate to destroy you and anyone who tries to get in my way.” At the end of her threat she had inched closer and pulled him down to her level until they were almost nose to nose. Suddenly she let go of him with a sweet and charming smile.
“I know I haven't been the best mother during Anthony's life Captain Rogers.” she stated firmly “But know this; should anything happen to my boy thanks to you, should
“Because Bruce is doing the same thing, and so is Clint, and so is the rest of the team.”
Tony cut himself off with a sob and Steve ran his hand across his back, trying to soothe him. Tony swallowed and continued.
Tony broke eye contact with the woman to look over her shoulder to see Bruce sitting next to a man with sandy blonde hair and finishing putting bandages around his forearm.
“Oh, please just call me Charles, only my students call me professor Xavier and frankly it makes me feel old when I hear that.” He said with a small laugh in the end.
“And you must be Steve that we have heard so much about,” Tiberius smiled from the floor, blood dripping from his lips “you know, Tony never shut up about you. How you would come for him, save him and make us pay. Never shut up the little shit, well, until Rumlow or I shoved a cock in his mouth or up his ass. That's probably the only thing I'm gonna miss about him you know, that tight little-”
They both put on their jackets and went outside and stepped into one of the cars in the driveway. Steve drove them to a small cafe where they were led to a small booth in a secluded area. Tony slid in and was surprised when Steve sat next to him instead of in front of him. Steve slung an arm around Tony's shoulders and the smaller man leaned into his side.
"Oh, well, that makes sense I guess, somehow. I don't know."
He looked back at Natasha who wore a similar expression and asked her why that was, when all of this clearly was his fault. She just gave him a small smile.
All Tony could think while he tried to push him off was “No! No! NO!”. Brock only laughed while lowering his hands to squeeze Tony's right asscheek painfully hard and that's when the genius remembered the glass in his left back pocket. He reached his hand down and grabbed it without Rumlow noticing and clenched his hand around it even though it was cutting his palm. He knew he had to wait until Brock was close enough to attack.
They laid there for a few minutes, catching their breaths. Then Steve slowly pulled out of Tony who winced slightly at the feeling. The blonde pressed a kiss to his cheek before getting out from the bed and to the bathroom where he wetted a towel and returned. He cleaned them both up before laying back on the bed and pulling Tony close to his chest.
He didn't get the chance to finish his sentence until Bruce had him tackled and pinned beneath him, punching him and smashing his head against the floor like his life depended on it until his face was unrecognizable and blood pooled beneath him. Bucky went forward after a few minutes and gently pried his friend of off the now shaking man under him. He pulled a shaking Bruce up and they resumed their place at Steve's side. Knowing that Tiberius was done for the blonde leader moved to the other man instead.
"I, eh, what?" Tony replied with a confused expression. "How did you know it was my birthday?"
“I'm afraid that I don't have any condoms at the moment”
“Crap, crap, crap, he must have seen you guys come by the apartment yesterday.”
Doctors and nurses surrounded them immediately and they made Steve put Tony down on one of the stretchers and wheeled him to the direction of the operation rooms. Steve held his hand and tried to follow but two of the nurses stopped him and said that he couldn't go any further. His hand slipped out of Tony's and he watched helplessly as the doors shut behind him and he couldn't see his boyfriend anymore.
“Ah! I shall go and assemble one of the healers to aid you!”
Tony groaned when his back met the floor and he looked up at Rumlow who was walking towards him. He tried to cover himself with his arms to protect the most sensitive parts of his body but failed miserably.
“Because I don't have the right equipment for the amount of injuries you have and because you look two seconds away from passing out.” He deadpanned, however he could not conceal the concern he felt at the sight of his best friend.
This was not one of those nights.
“Oh, I- eh” he started nervously. Steve just gave him a concerned look and motioned for him to keep talking. “I met someone, that I used to know, date in fact. His name is Tiberius and we used to date back in college for almost two years until I ran away. I asked him for help, I had nowhere to go and nothing in my name and he just, slammed the door in my face. I haven't seen him since then, well, until now that is.”
Tony bit his lip before replying.
His face was bruised and covered in blood and there was a large cut on his forehead.
*slams door shut*
And always remember!! I'm a slut for kudos and reviews!! XD I love you all so so so much, never forget that!!!
Steve laid in the middle of his and Tony's bed, the scent of his lover had long since disappeared and had been replaced by his own causing Steve’s heart to ache in his chest. He sighed and put his arms behind his head and closed his eyes.
He took a moment to bask in the heat and tried to stop the shivering. It had been freezing outside.
“Well, at least you don't have to worry about him anymore” he said while caressing Tony's cheek with one hand and gripping him tighter with the other. Tony leaned into the touch and lightly kissed Steve's wrist. “He won't bother you anymore.”
Steve looked up from his phone and towards his team in silence. That silence probably would have continued of Bruce hadn't spoken up.
They drove the rest of the way in comfortable silence and when they reached the cafe where Tony and Steve had their first date they saw the blonde pacing backwards and forwards with a frown on his face while holding his phone to his ear. When he noticed their car pull up he let out a deep breath and his face showed relief.
“What? No, no, he- he can't be alive. I- I killed h-him.”
“This may be a bad timing but am I the only one who wonders how he managed to blow up an entire HYDRA facility all by himself. Like, I know he is quite badass but seriously?”
Blood covered Tony's face as he fell on the floor, forced down by the full weight of Howard Stark on his back. He quickly pushed off the now still body of his father from him and struggled up to his feet and turned around to get a look at his savior. Not in a million years would he ever have guessed who it was.
Tony rolled his eyes and leaned back in the couch while crossing his arms.
“After everything.”
“His dad was an abusive drunk and his mom was so jacked up on pills to even notice him.” Came Bruce's reply, venom basically dripping from his voice. No one questioned him, they all knew his own history of an abusive father and understood why he was so protective of the young genius.
He raised his gun and shot the man as soon as he rounded the corner. Tony kept his gun raised incase anyone else came. When he didn't hear anything he lowered the gun and went back to the lock. After a few minutes he managed to unlock it and quickly dragged the body in with him to hide it.
“We didn't want anyone to recognize him as Tony Stark. His dad might have found him and he really doesn't need that right now. And Rogers is a very common last name so we just went ahead with that. Plus, you are a possessive bastard, figured that you would prefer that.”
White letters started to appear on the screen.
(All mistakes are mine and all the characters belong to MARVEL studios)
“Yeah man, you just disappeared one day and it was just radio silence since that. We were about to report you missing when one of the professors told us that you had dropped out.”
Suddenly Natasha saw a very familiar form laying still on the ground around 15 meters away from them. Without alerting the others she ran forward, the team hot on her heels.
The team was watching the scientists with fond expressions before Steve spoke up.
Around 30 minutes after Tony fell asleep Clint poked his head through the door and asked if they could come in again. Steve gestured for them to get in but stay as quiet as possible. They all complied and sat down in their original spots around the bed. They all looked softly at the sleeping genius and wondered how he had managed to weasel his way into their hearts in such a short period of time.
His thoughts were interrupted by a chuckle and a small shove from Bucky.
Tony slowly got out of his bed and rubbed his eyes, damn his boss for making him work at 8 am.
“Oh baby…” Maria began, a small relieved smile forming on her lips “what are you talking about? They haven't left your side since we got here, the same with Mr and Mrs Jarvis. They are out at the moment to get everyone some new clothes and take some showers, Doctor Cho said that the stench they were oozing was going to kill everyone in the hospital and sent them all home to freshen up. They should be back any minute now. You should have seen them, arguing about who was gonna do what in order to get back as quickly as possible. I'm pretty sure that man of yours, Steve, threw his one armed friend across the corridor.” The last part was followed by a giggle from his mother.
“What basement?” Natasha asked her.
Right, Jarvis had come over for coffee and to check up on Tony, of course he would have told Bruce.
“He does not have feelings for me, and even if he did he knows that I'm with you now, it'll be okay.”
“When will he wake up?”
The last word was accompanied with a fist flying towards Tony's face and landed on the side of his head before he could even attempt to block it.
Well, it started when I went to the store close to the mansion because I was hungry and figured a twenty minute trip wouldn't hurt anyone so I went alone. And then there was the explosion and it felt like my chest was on fire, it hurt so bad.
“Banner!! You better get down here now!!” Shouted Nick on his way in. He would never admit it but seeing the usually energetic and sarcastic kid this still scared him.
“Yeah, now! We can go out for breakfast instead of cooking anything.”
“When did you make this?”
Tony looked up with betrayal in his eyes at the blonde.
“Uh, excuse me, I am doctor Cho, do any of you happen to be here for Tony Rogers
“Goodnight love.”
“They came to mine and Bruce's apartment about a year ago since Clint was injured and Bruce is the team doctor. I was supposed to be at work but since here was barely any customers I got to go home early. I walk into our living room where this group of ridiculously good looking people are gathered and Natasha is pointing a gun at my face. Bruce managed to calm everyone down and he explained everything. At first Steve was a bit cold and shit but then we had to move in with them since their rivals were after me and I was attacked by one of them. So, Steve and I got to know each other and well… Here we are.”
And just like that, Edwin Jarvis fainted.
WARNING!!! THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS SOME VIOLENCE, CHILD ABUSE AND MENTION/VAUGE THREAT OF RAPE
Steve came into the common room while putting his phone back into his pocket.
“You see him, take a good look. That is nothing compared to what we will do to you unless you tell me where Tony is.” Steve's voice was cool as ice when he spoke and Brock felt a shiver run up his spine. Not wanting to end up worse than his companion he spoke.
Tony couldn't hold back a scream as three large fingers were brutally pushed inside of him with only a bit of saliva as lubricant.
“No” Tony started while trying to crawl away from the approaching men “no no no no!”
“Great!” Ty exclaimed while feeling satisfaction spread inside of him “How about we meet at Starbucks around six this afternoon?”
“I was so scared baby doll” Steve mumbled into his hair “I was so scared that I had lost you forever. Please forgive me.”
The warm water immediately relaxed his tense muscles and he let out a slight moan.
The first man just smirked.
“They took him Steve! They took Tony!” Bucky cried out.
Meanwhile Tony stood still as his brain tried to process what exactly what was happening. The unexpected familiar feeling of his mom comforting him washed over his body and he felt himself slumping against his mother and he ignored the twinge of pain of his sore knees hitting the floor, instead letting the tears flow and allowing her to comfort him in a way that only she could. He wrapped his weak arms around her as tightly as he could muster while ugly sobs tore their way through his throat, completely forgetting and ignoring the people around them that were staring intensely at the scene.
He tried to guess where he was when suddenly the memories came rushing back to him, the fight with Steve and the team, storming out, meeting Ty, drinking the drugged coffee and being tossed in a van with Bucky screaming after him.
This is also like a little birthday present from me to... Well... Me! (Like a week late but oh well! B) ). That's right!! Your girl is 18 now!!
‘Soon baby’ he thought tiredly ‘soon I will have you back with me and I will never let you go.’
That was until the sound of someone clearing their throat was heard through the hall. Maria clutched her son tighter to her and her eyes snapped up, scanning for potential danger. However, all she found was Steve Rogers with his gang a bit behind him, all had by this point found their way back to their Captain and all were staring at the mother and son.
WARNINGS! SMUT! (If you don't want to read that it ends by the cut aka these ones ------- )
Black spots had started to appear in his vision when the kicks suddenly stopped when a gunshot rang out. Tony looked up to see his attacker slumped on the ground with his eyes wide open and a bullet hole in his forehead.
“Yeah, he is.”
“Tony.” He said with his ‘I'm disappointed in you’ stare. “Don't go with Tiberius.”
“Tony, Tony. Doll, come on, wake up. It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, you're safe.”
“After a quick stop to the hospital.” Bruce chimed in, the rest of the group and Maria nodding their heads in agreement.
WARNING! SMUT UNDER THE CUT! (This chapter is basically just porn)
The older pair just smiled softly, trying to hold back their own tears and failing, and held their boy close to them. Tony could feel Ana press little kisses all over his face while her husband strokes his hair. They stood like that for a while before Tony started to shift in discomfort as his leg started to ache. It didn't go unnoticed and the butler and his wife ushered him back to his wheelchair without letting him go. Ana was fretting and looking him over for injuries all while shooting him with questions about “what's hurting?” And “stupid boy, don't risk harming yourself further!”. Jarvis stood behind him and smiled warmly at his wife and the boy he had come to love like he was his own.
Steve let out a weak chuckle and shoved his friend lightly with his shoulder.
When Steve and Tony reached the mansion Bruce was standing by the front door.
“Steve” he started “I want you to fuck me.”
“Well” this time it was Bruce who had spoken up “we could begin with trying to figure out where in the mansion he is being kept to make it easier to rescue him.”
He had managed to sneak a shard of glass into his pocket when Brock had smashed it against his back the previous day before it was all removed. He was gonna try to use it to escape and he needed to do it really soon before one of his legs got broken or anything so that he wouldn't be able to walk.
“Lehnsherr” Howard sneered back “I see Rogers convinced you to join him in his quest to rescue his little damsel, why am I not surprised? I take it you're here to repay your debt, huh? You save his whore after he saved yours?” Howard let out an ugly laugh before jumping behind the wall next to him, leaving Brock and Tiberius to fight of Lehnsherr and his men. He dragged Tony down the corridor, leaving the sound of gunshots and flesh hitting flesh behind them.
“I don't think that you should go, I have a bad feeling about this Tony.”
I am so so so sorry for the delay but school is finally over (for this year, one more year to go!) so I haven't had time to writ anything. And also I have been fighting a serious case of writers block, but hey! Better late than never I guess?
“Is that so? Well, can't I still get you an apology coffee? Just like friends I promise, please?” The question came with a small, innocent smile. A smile that Tony had never been able to resist.
“Tony stop! It's just me kid!” Yelled a familiar voice.
When Tony stepped into the bathroom he caught himself in the mirror and gasped. His neck was a mess of purple hickeys and some bite marks. He stared at his reflection for a moment, a blush creeping up his neck. He turned around and removed his sweatpants and boxers before wetting a rag and cleaning up. He figured that he didn't need to shower again so soon. He went out to his room and put on a pair of clean underwear and some comfy jeans and stepped out where Steve who had also cleaned up was waiting for him.
“Hey, hey, it's ok now. He's dead, he can't hurt you, you will never see him again. Just take a deep breath, that's it Doll, come on.”
Anger and fear spread through Tony's body like a fire and he quickly ripped his arm from Brock's grasp and socked Tiberius in the face as hard as he could while attempting to kick Rumlow wherever he could reach which happened to be his crotch.
He hit his head very hard but we haven't been able to discover any permanent damages so far, we will be able to know more when he wakes up.-”
After about an hour Tony had grown both bored and hungry, the fun of beating Clint went over after the first five times.
I looooooooooove comments and kudos! ;)
Before Steve could ask again, Thor stepped forward.
“Bruce, did doctor Cho mention when we could take Tony home?”
Ana and Edwin Jarvis made their way to the Avengers mansion hand in hand with small smiles on their faces. They had missed their Tony so much and could not wait to see him and the rest of the team as well. They had grown very found of the mob after seeing how well they were treating Tony and how happy they made him.
WARNING!!
“Wait wait wait! Tony, are you sure about this? I don't want you to feel forced to do anything you aren't a 100% comfortable with. And besides, it hasn't been that long since, you know. And I don't want you to feel pressured.”
“He's not here, Cap!”
“Listen here you ungrateful little shit” he hissed out “I have done everything for you. I have fed you, I have clothed you, I have given you an education, I even let you keep that disappointment of a “robot” you made. How dare you do this to me. Running away from home and leaving MIT after everything I have done for you? Do you have any idea how humiliating that was!? No, of course you don't, all you care about is yourself! You have tarnished the Stark name. If you weren't my only heir I would have gotten rid of you a long time ago.” Howard inched his face closer at every insult until their noses almost bumped.
Even if Clint had gone with him he wouldn't have been able to stop a grenade and if he had managed to keep Tony back in the mansion they would just have struck another time.
Jarvis let go of his wife's hand in order to ring the doorbell since in his other hand there was a bag which held a container of goulash and a pie that Ana had made that morning. When nobody opened they rang again, certain that they had just missed it. By the third time they looked at each other with confused expressions before Ana pulled up her cellphone, another gift from Tony, and dialed his number. When the boy didn't answer she dialed Steve’s number instead and the rest of the team when he didn't answer either.
He sighed and gently cupped Tony's face and looked over it, seeing the tears and the bruise he felt a whole new wave of anger wash over him. He debated going after Howard when Tony put one of his hands over Steve's own and looked him in the eyes.
“Mama…” He began again.
“Steve. I never sent this email.”
Steve leaned down and whispered in his ear.
“I'm afraid it seems like your friend has gone through some sexual assault considering the circumstances and that there was some slight  tearing and blood there. We didn't find any traces of sperm though, only a bit of leftover saliva that I believe was used as lubricant.”
Ana glared at him for a minute longer before turning her glare to the rest of the team that were standing behind their captain with equally guilty expressions. A heavy silence hovered in the room, tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. In the end Ana sighed deeply and slumped down back on the couch, feeling decades older than she was. She rubbed her temple with her fingers while leaning into her husband's side. “What have you planned so far? Do you even know where he is?”
He pressed harder on the pedal and drove past the cars and ignored them honking and shouting at him.
Steve just chuckled and rolled his boyfriend out the door and to the car where the rest of the team were standing with stuffed animals, chocolate and balloons. They helped Tony into the car and packed away the wheelchair in the trunk of the car. The road home was filled with happy chatter and excitement, everyone was happy that Tony would be coming home and that they could finally leave that hospital. There was only so many preppy nurses and smell of death anyone could take.
Maria was the last to leave the room, but before she did, she grabbed Steve's arm and glared into his eyes.
“Calm down, you really think age matters in this whole thing? If you both like each other and are both consenting adults then I see no problem with this whole thing. But I promise you Steve, if you hurt that kid it's not just Bruce that you should be afraid of.” She said, her voice getting darker towards the end.
Steve and Tony fed each other pancakes and talked about all and everything.
Bruce stopped his attack and looked over to Tony, the boy looked scared and like he didn't quite know what to do. All his anger melted away and he looked down at Steve's face which was now bloody and bruised. He let go of the leader and stood up, slowly making his way towards Tony.
