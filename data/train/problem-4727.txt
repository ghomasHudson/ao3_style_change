“Hey, go easy on me, Spock, it’s been a good thirty years since I’ve set foot in the mansion,” Tony joked. 3490 Steve eyed him for a moment, in a way that didn’t make Tony feel entirely comfortable. It was like he knew something, or was guessing something, about Tony that Tony didn’t feel like Steve—3490 or not—had any right to know.
“Well, I mean, yeah, I guess it was nice not to tell Dad, because he probably would have freaked out and grounded you for the rest of your life—but that ended up happening anyway, didn’t it? And now it’s worse, because he’s upset with you
“And isolated. And seems to trust you,” Steve said, nodding. “That could work. Think you can get him to help you without him really

“Thanks,” he said. He sounded truly grateful as he sat up. Torrun sat on the bed next to him. She watched him carefully. He sighed. “You’re going to lecture me, aren’t you?”
“Goodbye, Agent Rogers,” Stark said, waving him off and never once turning back to look at him. He followed Tony down the hall anyway. He wanted to tell him that he hadn’t been judging him from afar—but hadn’t he? He knew the man well enough superficially, but what did he
“The pictures were beautiful,” he said quietly while her back was still turned. Tony felt a pang of sympathy for this Steve again. She wasn’t naïve enough to think that she was Steve’s One True Love, his only soul mate in this universe and every universe—hell, she

She was hundreds and hundreds of feet in the air in nothing but her gold undersuit and boots, and about to die.
“Clint!” she shouted so he’d see what she was doing. The more explosives, the merrier. She loosed her arrows and, as soon as they made contact with the stone and mortar above the great hall’s entrance, they exploded on impact in a great, fiery ball. The old stone cracked, and began to crumble. Clint added his own arrows to the fray, and with a great tremble, the stone collapsed and Hydra agents yelled as it began to come down on their heads. There were still many—Kate quickly counted twenty—that had been clear of the door and the area that collapsed. Some of them had the blue light weapons, but some didn’t.
“Two if we’re lucky. Six if we’re not,” she said. Steve resisted the urge to sigh heavily, settling for a slightly exasperated expression and a silent prayer of
They hadn’t talked much, though. That little bubble of what-now-anxiety still sat some with Steve. He didn’t know what the future had in store for them—but then again, that wasn’t any different than any other day, when he really thought about it. And it wasn’t as though they had
“WHAT DID YOU DO?” his father demanded of the other man. “WHY ARE THEY AFTER YOU? YOU TELL ME BEFORE YOU GET US ALL KILLED!”
“If that barrier comes down we all go down—this is suicide,” Natasha said. She could hear splashes—some of the soldiers were jumping into the river to swim away. She felt her every muscle tense. She could order her team to leave—Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye—and they would go. But if she did and that barrier came down, all of the children would die.
“Good,” she said, then turned on her heel and went back to Pepper and Happy. The party, which had gone a bit quiet as Tony yelled, picked back up again. Kate came over to him, excitement in her eyes.
“Well, it’s lucky to have a beautiful subject,” he said. “You were so wonderful that day. I’ve never seen a better ballet. I’m so proud of you Kate.” He took her hand and moved her so that she was standing to his side, so she could better see his face. He was very serious. “I know you’ve been having a hard time lately, Katie. I don’t know what’s going on, specifically, but you’re obviously struggling with something. And I
“I tried. To get completely drunk in here when they died, I tried. But Steve wouldn’t let me. I told him to fuck off, to let me do what I wanted, my parents were
He’d wanted them to both have a chance to experiment with other people because he felt what she felt too. That the two of them, that Francis-and-Kate, was a packaged deal. That they were forever. They were the Real Deal. They’d just found each other so early—he wanted to make sure that they were both
. You didn’t just want company, you didn’t want to be all alone in that big room. And finally it clicked.”
“She’ll be fine. I’ll let you all know if there’s a change for the worse, but she’ll be fine. She’s lucky she has super soldier genes. I’d appreciate it if you all left. Kate needs her rest now.” No one spoke or moved for a moment, but finally Clint—3490 Clint, Tony thought—broke the silence.
Steve had to admit that, well, maybe his response was the tiniest bit childish. Maybe they needed to clear the air a bit. Maybe Steve ought to apologize. Though not about the yelling about Tony flying into danger. That was mostly justified. But maybe for being a bit of an ass about it.
” his father finally barked, blood spewing from his mouth and onto the carpet. 525 Steve acted as if he had not heard.
“I didn’t vote for you because I thought you were an irresponsible, unreliable lout with questionable motives for running,” Steve said, irritated. “And I was a bit mad you’d

“Fourteen,” MJ Watson spoke up. She was a very outspoken redhead and also worked on the school paper—she was currently editor-in-chief.
“Then assist will be sent; I don’t want doombots running all over the city, we need to keep them contained or they’re going to be a much bigger problem for everyone. 3490 out.” The crackly static that indicated 3490 comms had merged with theirs cut off suddenly.
Tony didn’t even think about it. He walked out of the Commander’s room, made a few turns down into another hall, and opened up the door to Steve’s room. His Steve. He didn’t even knock. He barged in, but the room was empty. The door to the adjacent bathroom, however, was cracked, and Tony could hear the shower going. Tony knew he should leave. This was rude. This was crossing a boundary. This was crossing
“I don’t really think it would be that bad,” Peter said. “If someone starts talking to you about something you don’t understand, you just, you know, let them know you’re Alts. Boom, problem solved.” There was an awkward silence. “Or not, ok, whatever.” The Alts lapsed into a slightly more comfortable silence as Kate and Peter waited for the first batch of cookies to be finished and spoke about innocuous things. After waiting through the third and final batch of cookies, Peter and Kate piled them onto a pair of plates and headed up the stairs.
“You’ve got any ideas I’m sure the faculty and the rest of us will be open to hearing them,” he said. Francis and Kate walked into a new classroom, and Peter followed behind. There were different students in this one, though some of them were the same.“What’s this class?” Peter asked, still trying to process the information Francis had given him. He had never, in all his years talking with Kate about the Academy, happened upon this deep-seated rivalry. He guessed she’d talked around it on purpose, but he didn’t know why.
“Oh, no honey, they didn’t take the bracelet. Here it is, on the bedside table with your clothes. Here, why don’t you hold onto that. Go back to sleep, Kate, all right? We just want you better.”
A big, warm hand fell over hers, stilling her incessant tapping. The younger replica of her father looked at her with the same compassion her own father always did. His hand slid off of hers as she looked up into his face. He had a small half-grin playing on his lips.
“What, just? Are you guys from the nineties? Because you should really warn James Cameron against remaking Fern Gully and Pocahontas with computer generated blue people,” Peter insisted. “Oh, and there’s some stuff about terrorist attacks and things you should know, but mostly you need to sit down with James Cameron.”
have to be anxious about, Captain Obvious?” Tony grouched. Maybe he needed an extra pain killer. Everything coming out of his mouth seemed to be coming out before he had a chance to think about it. Steve’s mouth set in a hard line.
“I just,” Francis said before Kate could gather her thoughts enough to say something else, “if that Fury has found the Red Skull, then I’d guess we’re about to go into battle again. Like, probably the worst one yeah? Those guys always save all the worst shit for the end. And if that’s what we’re headed towards, I just—I don’t want anything left unsaid.”
against holographic dragons in a giant warehouse. If he could ever figure out how to get past security, he might just sneak in one day and program it in as an available scenario. His mother might kill him, but if he could fight dragons, it might be a worthy death.
“What lies are you telling my little brother?” Francis drawled as he came into the room. He picked Lewis up from James’ lap and set him on his own as he sat on the arm of the couch.
“How long have you been off the ice?” she asked. He looked surprised to be addressed about this topic. He shrugged.
“What do you mean, our designation?” This time it was Other Steve who spoke up. Tony turned her gaze to him. It was bizarre, seeing her husband but
. I don’t want to look at you. I don’t want to see your face right now. I just want you to go.” Francis looked gutted. He shrunk in on himself, his shoulders hunching over as he shoved his hands in his pockets.
“Yeah, ok,” he said, sliding off the countertop and walking to him. They headed down to the garage together.
. It will take everything with it. The infinity gauntlet is our best bet for repairing the damage quickly.”
“Sometimes the advances your mom has made—and you now, I guess—blow my mind a little, kid,” Tony admitted. Peter smiled, and Tony—feeling just a tad guilty and manipulative—decided this was the perfect opportunity to segue to his topic. “Particularly with the whole multi-verse travel thing. We didn’t even know there
Woops! There was a chapter posted out of order last update. Please go back and read chapter 65, 'Pedestal'!
. The skyline from this point was amazing, and one entire wall was made of glass. He gravitated towards it unconsciously.
“Probably the same thing it means in our universe,” the Commander said with a sigh. “Never really beat those bastards back entirely. They pop up every now and again. HYDRA’s name was apt, unfortunately. So. It isn’t AIM. It

?” Tony asked, though Steve guessed he was more asking the air than Steve. “Why don’t slightly confused tourists ever drop through?”
“Right. Of course. Good night,” Steve said. The others said their goodbyes, and then they were out the door. James, Kate, and Peter were alone with their father, their family feeling much smaller than it should. James could feel one single question that was pressing in on all of them. He could tell Kate and Peter wanted to ask, but they were deferring to him. He could tell his dad was bracing for the question. It was a question that James had avoided asking for thirteen years.
“Kid’s got guts and a temper,” Steve said, not fully disagreeing. “And some problems. Chip on his shoulder.”
“Thanks,” James said flatly, “but I didn’t ask for your advice. I just want to know if there are private rooms here.” Lizzie shrugged.
“Can’t leave you,” Peter said, shaking his head vigorously and biting back tears and emotion. The past few days had been emotionally exhausting, and Peter now found himself unable to contain it all.
And yeah, it was pretty damn obvious that Steve had noticed considering usually he was halfway through saying, “Hey, Tony, we should—“ Talk. Talk was the end of that sentence, Tony was 99.9% certain. But he never let Steve get to the end of that sentence. It was amazing how easy it was to avoid someone even within a single building. Tony glanced at Steve, who was busy taking down a much larger bot that was set to a much higher difficulty. It probably wasn’t fair of Tony to be doing the avoiding when it was Tony who had started the pursuing (or at least started the kissing) but hey. Tony had never claimed to be a completely fair guy. Sometimes he was even downright selfish. And he was going to continue to be downright selfish because
“Must be interesting, hopping through the multiverse as you all do,” she commented. 525 Tony’s smile turned a bit sour.
“If I had to guess, one of the dozens of scientists your mother employs could at least figure out whether or not your cells are still mutating or if you’ve stabilized,” Alt Tony pointed out. Peter shrugged obstinately. He was
“Steve! STEVE!” Tony cried out. She was halfway out of her armor, trying to get up. She started running towards the scene, dressed in nothing but her gold undersuit, still trying to shed her metal boots. Steve was overwhelmed. Others had joined 525 Steve and Natasha, and he was getting buried, beaten to a pulp. Tony’s heart raced in panic. She was weaponless, resourceless, and feet away from a giant fire fight. That was, until her armor started to come to life again, her boots firing up and dragging her into the sky. Disoriented and in terrible pain, Tony didn’t even have the wits about her to scream. She could see, through the spinning and spiraling upwards, another suit. It was 525 Tony, and he was playing puppet master with her armor. Whatever it was that let him control his armor, it was letting him control hers.
“No,” Pepper said softly, but her voice was steady and filled with courage. Steve had to admire her strength in the face of something that so clearly terrified her. After everything they had been through, Pepper Potts showed what she was really made of underneath it all: iron.
‘Rogers’ very well.” She gulped down the remainder of her coffee and put the mug on the table with a dull thunk. Tony felt like disagreeing with her. He’d known the guy for nearly two years. He had a stick permanently lodged up his ass, and he’d never seen anything to indicate otherwise. Antonella stood. “Well, this has been a lovely chat but I have a international security organization to run, so.” She picked her tablet up.
“Come to say goodbye to your old man?” he asked. Peter reached instead for an apple from the bowl of fruit on the counter.
“You know,” she said, “after most of the other Avengers moved out, we didn’t really keep this gym up to date. We’ve got
“We killed them. All of them. And we tossed their remains back into their own charred universe. It was brutal. Animal. I took off my own double’s head with my shield. Is that what you wanted to know? Is that what you wanted to hear?” 3490 Steve asked coldly. Steve felt a chill from his words go up his spine. Could he become this person that he saw before him? Was it possible? Would he inevitably become him? Or were they different people all together? He wished he knew. When Steve got his voice back he said,
“Happily married for ten years now,” 3490 Tony said proudly. She did seem quite proud about it, too. She boasted a bright smile and looked up adoringly at her handsome husband. It was all very strange. Tony couldn’t fathom being in the same situation—married, living in the mansion, having two kids… It was not something Tony had ever considered seriously.
Later, in the privacy of his own room, he alerted J to the situation. He already knew, of course, but it eased Tony’s mind. At least one member of this household was looking out for the scrawny little kid.
“What? Oh, sure,” female Tony said, as if only just realizing their presence. “They’re from Earth 199999. Names are the same. The guy who looks like a guy version of me is unsurprisingly a guy version of me. Look what a handsome couple they make!”
Thanks for sticking with me. I hope a few of you read and enjoyed this. I am at least personally enjoying the thought of roughly 200 people getting spammed all at once with 18 chapter updates on a story they subscribed to seven years ago, so there's that. Good for a giggle.

“Has it only been ten?” 3490 Steve said, his voice teasing. “Feels like ninety.” 3490 Tony swatted him on the arm. He turned to the ‘Alts’ as they had termed the 199999 Avengers and smiled warmly. “Can I get anyone some coffee? Peter should be back soon, the grocery store is just down the street.”
as such, to either of us, because she understood the position her double was in,” Steve said. “Seemed to work just fine.”
going on, with feelings and everything, I wouldn’t have made out with him,” Torrun said, matter-of-fact. “It was just a bit of fun—I didn’t think anyone was getting hurt.”
It wasn’t quiet. It was rarely quiet anymore. He knew Kate and Peter were probably still on their way back from school, so the noise came from the Alternates. James’ mouth curved down in distaste. He didn’t know why Tony or his dad had invited them into their
“Oh no, Captain,” he spoke. “I’m well aware that is a decoy. But to copy the power signature, you had to hide it close by, yes?” The space stone began to glow bright again, the air around it crackling and fizzling with that eerie blue, and then, to Steve’s horror, the gauntlet, the real one not the decoy, floated in the air before the Red Skull, contained in that eerie crackling blue. The stones were sparking too, flashes of purple and red and green, reacting, maybe, to the presence of the space stone. “And you! Captain! I shall keep you, to
“Well, I was pretty…not mean, but let’s say petty…with Steve at first,” Tony replied. “But eventually I took pity on him. He was living in this house, alone except for my parents—I was at MIT still—and he just…he was lonely. It was sad. I knew what it was to feel alone in this house. So I dragged him out to some parties. Introduced him to Rhodey so he’d have somebody in the military to talk to. Somewhere along the lines we became friends. He helped me through some tough shit. He got married, then divorced, and, well, after a near-death experience we both kind of realized that we’d been stupid for seven years. I had Peter and Kate in 2000, and we got married six years later.” Tony touched her tablet, moving to her pictures. She found the wedding quickly and handed it to Other Steve.
“Of course,” Steve replied, speaking for the team. He could tell that no one would protest—the 3490 Avengers could sleep, and the MCU Avengers could figure out their next steps in the mean time. 3490 Steve just nodded, and then disappeared down the hall. His team followed.
The dam burst, their dad chuckled, just the smallest bit, and he opened the door—keyed, of course, to biometrics. Tony had been allergic to keys.
“I’ll e-mail you some PDFs and links, too,” he said as he handed the stuff over. He looked innocently excited. “It’s a pretty awesome topic.”
Kate shifted backwards, making to slip out of his hand. Francis dropped it when he noticed, and it fell to his side like it was made of lead. His gaze dropped and his shoulders slumped, the change in him so sudden and so visible she froze again.
“Thor, Captain, you both stay here. If we make this a big operation with recognizable faces, it’ll get conspicuous. Romanov, Barton, you’re with me. Let’s head out—Tony, send me the address,” 3490 Steve said.
that she wasn’t. There was one woman that would always hold a place in his heart that she knew of for a fact. But she still felt sorry for this Steve, who had just lost one of his and had no idea if he would ever find another. “Thank you for sharing them with me.” Tony returned to the table. She put her hand on his, which visibly startled the man. She looked directly into his blue eyes, as she had done so many times before—and yet never before.

. His mother closed her eyes, pinched the bridge of her nose and took a deep breath before continuing.
“Banner was finishing an experiment but will be up shortly,” Maria reported, putting the red plastic briefcase on a nearby table for Tony to pick up. Maria wasn’t looking at Tony, however. Her eyes were locked on her white-faced double across the way.
James looked so fragile like this. It was difficult to ever think of him as fragile when for most of his life he’d been more than head and shoulders taller than his brother, when even now his impressive musculature would intimidate even the bulkiest of biker dudes. Steve had wanted to teach him not to be a bully. But now he wondered if he’d bullied him in the process.
“I am not certain I feel comfortable fighting against such young Midgardians,” Thor admitted, looking worried. “I am concerned about accidentally harming one of them.”
of our friends there.” Tony breathed out and relaxed further into the couch. “Is that enough elaboration for you?” Her double nodded mutely. He wasn’t silent for long, though.
“Great,” he said. “Just one more.” He took the shot, then lowered the camera. “Thanks Gw-ow!” He shook his hand quickly, only to see a red and blue spider fall off and scurry away quickly.
“Camp Lehigh?” Steve had asked, puzzled. It was a familiar place, one that Steve had not returned to since the 40s. It had been a very long time, indeed. “Why would our Fury be at Camp Lehigh? It’s not an operational military base.”
sick. His head spun. He was off the couch and running to the bathroom before he’d even realized what he was doing. He could hear the voices of his not-parents calling after him in alarm. The door to the bathroom was closed—the younger kids and Francis were waiting outside it.
“Ah, I’m sure you’ll figure it out in your own time,” 525 Tony said, sounding apologetic. “I’d give you a hint, but I don’t want to disturb the way of things here.” 3490 Tony rolled her eyes but didn’t argue.
. 525 had been planning something too. They all knew how that had ended. She hoped this time it wouldn’t come to that.
’. As she took a seat across from him, his face still red and his eyes refusing to meet hers, she figured that recovery might require a cold shower. She raised one delicate eyebrow.
“I will not violate my principles—agh!” female Tony started laughing hysterically, and the cause was apparent—mature Steve was tickling her. “Stop! St-stop!”
was the clue. Brazil meant coffee. The rest was to tell her to leave the party. So, explaining to her teammates she was going to get some air that didn’t smell like perfect cookies, Natasha left the tower and headed across the street to the nearest Starbucks. Coulson was waiting at a table, cold coffee sitting in front of him, when Natasha took a seat.
“Hey babe,” he said. “I see you finally put the tickets I gave you to use.” He nodded to James and Francis. “Who’re your friends?”
“In the flesh, Captain. I’m assuming you’re still Steve Rogers, yes?” Tony asked. Steve nodded in confirmation. He still looked like he was trying to solve a particularly difficult puzzle. There was a tiny crinkle on his forehead between his eyebrows, and his features were slightly pinched together in concentration. It was adorable and sexy and
There were still guards at the doors outside, though, which Peter had not entirely anticipated. They blocked his escape. Enough of those blue lasers would take him down. So Peter did the only thing he could think to do—he ran still downwards, into the basement, shutting the door behind him and spraying it with web. It wouldn’t hold for long, but as he ran down the stairs and reached the second door into the basement itself, merely a concrete holding for maintenance equipment and old, archived files, he could barricade that door with shelves and wait for back up to come. They could still track him down through his smart suit. He had been looking for air vents to crawl out of when suddenly the world had exploded and crashed down upon his head.
“We got married in a courthouse. There was no fanfare, no magical moment. The kids were all there, as were Natasha and Bucky as witnesses—the only witnesses. I didn’t wear a white dress—I think I was still in my skirt suit for work, actually. There’s only one picture—Bucky took it.”
“Yes, I do. You’re feeling sorry for yourself because you don’t have powers so you’re not ‘special’, boo hoo. And hey, go ahead, we all deserve to feel sorry for ourselves sometimes. God knows it’s practically all I do some days. But did you ever stop to consider that maybe what you thought made you
Tony Stark had never in his life been put through more paces and drilled harder in battle than he was by this single group of punk kids. Fielding taunts of “old man” and “rust bucket” when he slowed down only fueled his determination to keep going, but
“Then,” Natasha said, putting her elbow on the table and resting her face in her hand, “we’ll just have to make his job even harder. Hill put the wine glass to her lips.
And with that terrifying thought, Steve realized that, while his counterparts may have initially appeared to him to be more perfect versions of himself (and yes, of Tony, at first), there were plenty of things they’d done that he personally, he thought to himself, could never do.
“Oh, back to last names, are we?” Steve asked, the ghost of a smile playing at his lips. Tony quirked up an eyebrow.
“I think that would be best. Kids, swap teams—Billy, Teddy, Kate, Tommy, David—you’re up. Let’s see how the MCU does against a different skill set,” Mom said.
. Had she read the signals wrong? Was he just trying to let her down easy? Was all that talk of waiting until she was eighteen to revisit their relationship just his way of avoiding rejecting her? Was he being an asshole, leading her on, or was he only trying to spare her feelings, hoping that she would grow out of a crush on him? Kate didn’t know and it was driving her crazy and she couldn’t
. Tony couldn’t imagine having one, and yet, there he was, proof that in another universe Tony Stark had a family and, judging by their brief interaction, it was a perfectly functional relationship. Tony found himself wondering about this Peter child. Did he like technology? Did he hate it? What did he think of the Iron Man? Of Stark Industries? Who the hell was his
“MISSING IN ACTION: NO ONE CAN FIND PETER! I REPEAT, PETER ROGERS IS MIA DOES ANYONE HAVE A VISUAL?” it was her brother’s panicked voice.
“Whatever,” she replied, still obviously stung. “I’m going to find Francis.” She hurried off. Peter looked down at the little girl once more.
“You’ve got some extra strength, I guess,” he agreed. “That’s always helped you draw the bow. But you don’t need super human strength to draw a bow. And none of that helps you to shoot. Aim, Kate. Without the aim, strength is nothing. And the aim is all right
” 525 Steve boomed. “You will fail, and you will wrench apart your entire world. Everything will burn. Everyone will burn. Our earth? 525? It is nothing now. It is a charred wasteland devoid of life. The Avengers did that. Powered people did that. So we are going to
“Negative, Senator Stark. I receive my orders from Director Fury. I have been commanded to take the night shift,” Steve said. Senator Stark made a face and rolled his eyes.
James had no conscious idea that he was crying, had no idea that tears streaked down his angry face. But the fact certainly didn’t go unnoticed by anyone else in the room. Likewise, he didn’t notice that the arm which held his brother trembled, that his grip was more for his own support than for suppression.
“Well, actually, I’m signed on with the army, so, I kind of do,” he said. Kate felt hot, angry tears welling in her eyes.
“Sorry, ma’am,” he said. “I shouldn’t judge you by the Tony of my universe. I know that.” Tony arched an eyebrow.
Tony probably should have been paying more attention as Other Steve launched into his speech, but all she could think about were her husband’s hands resting lightly on her stomach.
“If you’d prefer a pyre and cremation,” Steve ground out as he absorbed three more blows with his shield, “we can arrange that.” He noticed, out of the corner of his eye, Iron Man bust into the hall through the window, swooping in to scoop up Clint and Kate with Natasha hopping on back, before flying back through it. Good—three less things to worry about.
bad with names,” Stark said. “Agent Rogers, Agent Romanov, this is Happy. Hogan.” Steve was dismayed to realize that his new nickname was likely a permanent development. He wondered how Hogan managed to stand his boss on a regular basis, but Hogan seemed to enjoy the eccentric Senator’s behavior. The feeling appeared to be mutual—Stark sat up front with his chauffeur, leaving the Agents the back of the stretch.
“Oh. I guess. Uh. Look—I had a talk with Antonella. The night before? And, uh, she said some things. Some things I think you should know, but I don’t know if you would want to hear,” Tony said. 3490 Steve looked like he was bracing himself. He had set his hand upon a desk. “I uh—I asked my St—my universe’s Steve about it and he said he would want to know in your shoes.” 3490 Steve just looked pained. It was an expression he seemed to carry often these days.
“Well…all right,” she agreed. “I am a bit tired. If you all need anything, I’m sure Steve will be around to help…but help yourselves to anything in the kitchen, and there’s a rec room Steve can show you. There’s a gym as well, complete with training simulations. You’re free to go anywhere in the house except James’, Peter’s, and Kate’s rooms, of course.” 3490 Tony headed out of the kitchen, yawning as she went. 3490 Steve smiled.
“I know. I know. God, do I know,” Dad sighed. “But Peter she would be so proud of you. I know—I know this has to have been hard and frightening and horrible for you, but you’ve done so well. You helped get all the kids here safely. I know it’s going to be hard, but I need you to keep going, Peter. I need you to keep your wits about you, keep it together. Just for now. Just until we fix this.”
“You know, I think we’ve got it all covered now. But thanks. You firing this thing up or what?” 3490 Tony laughed and then, switching no switch but using whatever tech she stored in her brain, she turned the portal on.
This chapter has held this title for seven years, so I didn't feel like changing it. In the original draft of the scene, which lived solely in my brain, it was a line Steve said somewhere in here. That the outcome, no matter what it was, felt like it wasn't worth it, because Tony was still gone. But the more I lived with this story, the more I realized that could never be true for this Steve Rogers, a Steve Rogers who very well may have, if necessary, given up his own son to save the world. No, I think what really wasn't worth it for Steve was all the fighting he did with Tony. It never really accomplished or resolved anything and in the end only took precious time away. So I've kept the title, with that in mind, even if in the scene it no longer crops up.
When she finished her meal, twice as quickly than everyone else, probably owing to the fact that she ate less than half as much, Tony excused herself to work in the lab again. The table remained silent after she left, until Kate spoke up in a small voice,
exactly they were going to do about their daughter’s drug use. She had been grounded until Kingdom Come, but beyond that Tony wasn’t certain, and it wasn’t like Steve was talking to her about
. Not yet. She shook her head. “You know, I’ve seen some crazy things, but the lateness of this grouping might be the craziest yet. It’s 2016 here. The Avengers have been operational as a cohesive, consistent task force for the past twenty years.”
“They thought I didn’t hear them,” Kate said quietly. “When we were at the hospital. I’ve never heard them fight like that before. It was—it was so
“And we can only work in the here and now,” Commander Rogers said firmly. “Which is why we have a plan of attack. You all need to stay protected and as hidden as possible. It was obvious they wanted your Rogers, which could mean that yes, he’s who they want, or that they were trying to distract us and get the real prize, whomever that might be.”
right,” Peter said, brows furrowed. “How can you—how can we—how is this just allowed to keep going?”
“It’ll get you drunk,” Tony clarified for him. “A little formula of mine. Made it with a chemist pal back at MIT. I couldn’t not see Steve drunk at least once in my life. You don’t have to drink it if you don’t want to, but I figured…”
wasn’t going to cut it. Just one wouldn’t even give her a buzz. She swiped four, popped them in her mouth, and swallowed before Tudo got back. They’d wait to feel the effects, and then Kate would go back down to the club and party a little harder. It was just a bit of fun.
It had to be weird, Peter reflected. For years and years he’d been off doing the super hero thing and now here he was, watching his kids all get ready to rush into danger instead. Peter knew that in his shoes, he’d definitely be feeling more than a little… unmoored. He supposed it was expected for his dad to look a little sad, with everyone rushing off without him. But what worried Peter was that he didn’t look sad. He looked—vacant.
The threat, when they’d arrived where it had manifested this time in Bryant Park, was oddly, almost comfortingly, familiar. Through the multiverse breach members of Hydra had come flooding. After having been surrounded by so much that was unfamiliar for so long, even just having familiar enemies was a bit of a relief. Even if the fact that they wielded the weapons that Steve recalled from the war was a little disconcerting. Though there were no people anywhere due to all the evacuation orders through the city, the Hydra agents ran roughshod over the annual winter village wheree the little glass market stalls had long since been abandoned. The breach had opened right in the center of the ice rink; if it weren’t such a serious situation, it would have been comical to watch the Hydra agents slipping on the ice and falling on their asses.
“Nice work everyone,” James said through the comms. “Hopefully we won’t have another breach open for at least—oh, ten minutes.”
It was probably a testament to 3490 Tony Stark’s composure that no one realized anything was wrong until dinner; though it could have also been a testament to just how long she’d spent in the lab that day, away from everyone. Nevertheless, Steve hadn’t suspected a thing was amiss with the 3490 family—aside from the obvious—until they all sat down at the table and his double was conspicuously absent.
. Unfortunately, they squeezed it one too many times that night and it ended up playing in an endless loop. Finally having gone mad from the song, Tony ended up stripping down to her bra and stomping the electronic music box into oblivion. It had taken some effort, and even after she put the sweater back on it had a tendency to randomly play the song, which now sounded low and demonic. She disposed of the sweater as soon as the party ended.
“Long story short they tried to kill us first. They made it very personal. They were a danger not just to this universe, but to all universes. We did not believe there was any prison that would hold them—thus, execution was the only option left,” 3490 Steve said. “That’s the abridged version, and that’s all you’re getting. James, go to bed. You need the sleep.” James arms slowly unfolded. With a last, lingering look at his father, he turned the corner into the hall to the bedrooms.
The Red Skull just laughed, and, yeah, Steve admitted to himself again, there really was no reasoning with crazy.
,” James said, laying on the sarcasm as thick as it could get. Peter’s hands balled into fists and he saw
Steve had never been inside 3490 Tony’s lab—he didn’t think any of the 199999 Avengers had (much to Tony’s consternation). But he gathered his courage and headed to the door that he knew led to the basement, reached out, and knocked.
“Ah—no. No. The leaks only make things worse,” Dr. Richards explained. “We have our Thor looking for a, uh, gauntlet. The infinity gauntlet—do you know it?”
“Christ, Peter, who pissed in your coffee?” Kate finally demanded. She entered his room, unwelcome, uninvited, and sat on his bed where Peter currently lay, throwing a ball up to the ceiling and then catching it on its way down. Lather, rinse, repeat.
Their universe was not a fluke. So Steve was far less pissed when he realized what a massive help 199999 was in the field—even with 3490’s far more extensive pool of superhumans, the Chitauri were causing massive damage. And conveniently 199999 knew exactly how to take them out.
“Kind of on a deadline here, Cap,” he said a bit more urgently, but then Steve slowly shook his head.
the name, and then she would have his balls for it. He thought of her that way anyway. Antonella sipped her coffee. “He does seem to be the biggest virgin to ever virgin. My Steve had…I won’t say extensive, but he certainly had enough experience with men, anyway, that even if he blushed a bit around women he wasn’t totally ignorant about sex. I can’t tell with your Steve.”
“NOTHING? NOTHING? WHAT’D YOU SLIP HER?” James kicked the guy in the ribs, and he groaned, falling flat to the ground.
“I’ll get Teddy, Kate,” James said quickly. “I’ll get him.” Kate regarded him and her wailing subsided a bit. Jane’s eyes got wider.
he was crouching over. He stormed over, Francis at his side, and when he could see them from the front, well—he lost it. His sister was unconscious below the mutant, who was shouting her name. He decked the guy, who fell off the couch.
“No, Kate, I do. It’s like Dad’s always saying, with great power comes—” he started, but Kate cut him off. She was sick of it. She was sick of hearing it.
to stay. Believe me, I’d rather be about anywhere else. You know, Agent Romanoff and I are not your parents. You do not have to sneak away from us while we’re distracted and slip off to have sex in a closet—which is ridiculous, by the way, you have like five bedrooms on the way here—if you want to refuse security detail, you’re welcome to it, but I have to say it’s highly unadvised,” Steve said. The blonde slinking away slowly did not escape his notice. Stark rolled his eyes and huffed.
worst case scenario, but he didn’t really think she was like that. He was so much older than her, surely, he was fun to flirt with but she wouldn’t take it any further. But then James’ stomach dropped out. Maybe
“I should have known better. How many people have I lost, with how many things unsaid? I’ve almost lost Tony so many times—and yet, I was horrible to her the week before. That’s time I’ll never get back. I know, logically, you can’t appreciate another person every second of every day no matter what—but I wish I had,” Steve said. He turned his head to stare up into those concerned brown eyes, and his whole being ached. “Do me a favor, Tony?”
“Ditto,” he replied, and returned to his meal. He watched Torrun out of the corner of his eye. She took a few bites, but ate slowly and not much. It really wasn’t like her. She usually had an appetite to rival James’. James put down his fork.
. It was his own death and yet it was not, it was part of him and yet had nothing to do with him, and Tony felt oddly, horribly disconnected.
it. Kate had her father’s genetics. Kate was ridiculously intelligent. But more importantly, Kate was selfish.
“Did you put coffee on? I’m stealing some,” Tony informed him before searching through the cabinets until he found a mug and pouring himself some. Steve sat down at the table with his toast and eggs. Tony, who Steve wasn’t paying any attention to at all, he was barely aware he was in the room, really, leaned against the counter, drinking his coffee.
“She wasn’t my biological mother. You’re right about that, Peter. She was my father’s wife, my brother’s mother, my
“So how are we going to get Widow and Hawkeye out of here?” Tony asked Steve. Currently the two in question were all over the place, and Tony had no doubt they soon would be as well.
The giants rained ice and snow down upon them. Torrun and Thunderstrike tried to get in the giants’ way with lightning as the others retreated, diving over and under waylaid cars and buses, debris that had been abandoned on the streets for weeks as the city essentially shut down in the emergency.
. Of course, how could she not? Tony just waved him off, screwdriver in hand, interrupting what he was going to say.
that it was true. So every time he walked into Tony’s mansion, he tensed a little, waiting for everything to go sour. It always did. He wasn’t free of blame, and he knew that. Sometimes when he got mad at his father, it was unjustified. But
Peter sat in a corner of the room on the floor. He wasn’t as catatonic as Kate had been. He looked up when he approached, flatness in his expression. James had been annoyed earlier. He was still a bit annoyed. But he probably shouldn’t have taken that jab at Peter that he did. James knelt down and held out the soup. Peter took it, then met his eyes.
“I love you too,” Kate told him and resisted the urge to giggle like the love stuck child she felt like again. She pulled him closer, leveraging their point of contact to do it, and put her left hand up around the back of his neck. “You know… we
“Yeah? Hopefully I’ve gotten the ‘saving our asses’ thing down, too!” Kate yelled. Francis gripped around her stomach tighter as she took a sharp turn. He hoped she had, too. At the very least, she’d bought them extra time. Francis just hoped it would be enough. It had to be.
“And say what? I got the crap scared out of me when I was nine? We’ve all had scares. We’ve all encountered some super charged villains,” he said. Kate glared. He knew exactly what she was saying.
her—which, of course, they didn’t. They knew another her, one that wasn’t even a her, and it irked Tony that these people were likely basing opinions of her on someone who she wasn’t, someone she couldn’t control. Nevertheless, she stood at the head of the dinner table, with both her family and the alternate avengers present, ready to deliver the bad news. She cleared her throat.
“I can’t do this,” Kate said, suddenly springing to her feet. “I can’t do this! We have to do something! We have to help!”
“Christ, Rogers, never say that again,” Tony said vehemently, his eyes flashing. Steve was a bit surprised by the violent reaction. “Harley’s an exception not a rule.”
“To gain our trust,” Steve said, nodding. “It’s pretty obvious. It might be naive but I don’t think they really wanted any of us not to see the light of day for a year. Partially that might be a safety precaution—if we’d managed to escape, none of us would have been happy about the situation, after all.”
.” Natasha’s gaze was intense and insistent. Steve knew she was right. She was right, but somehow he still trusted their counterparts, at least a little.
home. Back to the manor. Back to their family. Back to where they were—and, he thought, glancing just briefly at her swollen belly—moving forward.
Well, the superpowers might surprise her but the other part didn’t. Peter was Steve’s son, through and through, in ways that James wasn’t. Of course he would want to follow the legacy and be a superhero. She had worried that he would follow that path anyway—build his own suit if she refused to give him one, or invent something new and run into the field with it, wholly unprepared. Tony supposed that she should really be happy—at least this way he had a healing factor and superhuman strength. At least he wouldn’t go into battle with all the vulnerable points she had when she first started out. But still the thought of Peter in the field made her throat clench and her stomach churn. She could handle the idea of Kate out there. She hated it, but she could
“What? That’s it? I get conked on the head and you call everything off?” Tony demanded, feeling guilty. James just frowned.
. James smiled that way when he was ten and he got back from a full day of playing at the ball park with Steve, just the two of them. But it wasn’t a smile specific to the Rogers. Bruce knew that smile because Lyra wore it when she won her first science fair, because Brian wore it when he got his acceptance letter to MIT. And in that moment, with Peter grinning at him, happy to share this moment with them, Bruce felt an incredible pang of sadness. Because he doubted if his double would ever know what it was to recognize that smile in the face of your child.
But James didn’t know what to say. He’d never known what to say. He didn’t have the words. And his father had never helped him find them. He’d hugged him when he’d seen him next.
“There’s this great little place out in Brooklyn, open all night, it’s called Joe’s—very original name—it’s been around since the thirties or something and there are no better burgers anywhere,” Tony said. He clapped Steve on the shoulder as he pushed the button for the elevator. “You like burgers, right? Who doesn’t like burgers? That would be more than un-American, it’s inhuman.”
“Oh,” the tour guide said, counting the spiders herself and coming to the same conclusion. “They must have removed that one for research. All right, and over here we have
“So welcome to a not-exactly-typical-and-thank-God-for-that morning at the Stark Rogers household,” 3490 Tony said. “If you would like to leave your awkward excuses for how you were ‘totally not listening, didn’t hear any of it’ at the door, it would be appreciated. If everyone will finish up soon, I’ll show you to your rooms.” Leave it to Tony, in any verse, to break the tension of a moment. More relaxed and settled now, the Avengers and co of 199999 earnestly ate the remainder of their breakfasts. All but Steve, Tony noted, who sipped at his coffee and surreptitiously watched 3490 Tony, who was throwing dishes in the sink. Moments later, just as the Avengers were filling the alternate kitchen with their own boisterous conversations (Thor regaling Jane with tales of Asgard, Clint, Bruce and Natasha discussing the latest episode of
“Because we believe in what we’re doing Kate,” he said softly. “Because we’re stronger together. We all have families Kate. If it isn’t me, it’s Clint and Bobbie, or it’s Luke or it’s Sam or Rhodey—“ Kate knew this. Kate knew all of this before she had even asked her question. Kate was simply beyond caring.
Steve couldn’t think of any words that fit, and even if he could have thought of them, his throat was too tight to speak. A moment passed, and Tony averted his rather intense gaze, returning to the holograph. Steve could have left it there, but for some strange reason he was compelled not to. He felt like Tony had offered him something important, and he felt like he should do the same.
“We figured something like that,” Tony replied coolly. 3490 Steve’s eyes flicked only briefly to him.
“Prove it!” Lewis Barton, who was on the other couch with his brother Callum and Nathaniel Richards, practically bounced up and down in his seat. Lewis was only six, and Callum and Nathan, at 10 and 12 respectively, looked almost as enthusiastic.
“I’m sorry, are we talking about your father? Born-in-1918 Steven Grant Rogers? Still submits eighty percent of his SHIELD paperwork
“No, I don’t need you to come in, we’ve got it covered here. The kids will want to see you, I’m sure, and at least one of us should get a good night’s sleep,” Tony told Steve. She sat in what was essentially a break room, watching
“Oh, I wouldn’t say I’d do it for anyone,” Steve said. Stark stared at him. “I’d think twice about taking a bullet for Justin Hammer.” Stark laughed. Steve smiled.
“Pancaaaaaaakes,” and plopped himself violently in the open seat next to 199999 Steve, who looked surprised, though Tony didn’t know if that was because of the manner of his sitting or that he’d sat next to Steve. Steve, Tony noticed, hadn’t said a word all breakfast, despite having been spokesman for the group before they’d arrived at the mansion. He looked contemplative, now. Peter chowed down next to him, shoveling food in his mouth as teenage boys are wont to do. Steve was, it did not escape Tony’s notice, watching 3490 Tony, who was engaged in a lively conversation with Pepper about shoes.
“Sixty seconds!” James informed them. Sixty seconds was plenty of time. They fought their way to the rink, pushing back the agents until Steve felt his own shoes on the ice. “Fifteen seconds!” Most of the agents were either dead around them or through the breach. Iron Man suddenly landed next to him as Steve watched the Hulk scare the remainder of them straight through the hole in the multiverse.
. Tony was not, nor had she ever been, shy about anything. He hadn’t figured out what she was up to, though, until everyone had left the house.
, big guy,” Tony said. “That’s what I’m getting at. We can’t run—they’re tracking us. We can’t fight them—even if our team wasn’t
“He can be kind of slow, though. I don’t think he’s gotten the point,” Steve said, a small smile playing on his lips at Tony’s dumbstruck expression. Baffling a genius—now, that was an entertaining pastime Steve could get used to.
, everywhere. But it doesn’t seem painted on, it’s like it comes from Mom herself. And all she’s doing is smiling down at me, and I know it’s me because I had black hair as a baby and Peter didn’t have any. And sometimes I just wish like hell that she’d look at me the way she looked at me in that painting. Because God knows she never has.” She drew another hit.
“What moron authorized that assignment? They’re trying to get you killed! That’s the hottest zone in the war right now and they’re sending in a Captain still wet behind the ears who hasn’t ever seen combat? Have your troops even had a year of training? No, don’t answer that, I don’t want to know,” Steve said, standing up. “I’m not having you and the rest of those men and women be cannon fodder. I need to make a few calls. There is no—”
old base. World War II old. Piqued my curiosity. I went to check it out myself. Ended up getting caught and chased out and I’ve been running ever since.” Steve raised an eyebrow.
Tony had no idea if Steve was even still alive, but she would be damned if 525 touched a hair on her children’s heads.
“Let yourself be happy. Let yourself get hurt. Allow yourself to risk hurting someone else, if they’ve agreed to take on the risk of being hurt. And don’t wait. Don’t wait to say something, to show something, even if it doesn’t feel like the right time. Even if it’s awkward, or embarrassing, or the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Because if there’s one thing that I’ve learned the hard way, over and over again, it’s that there are no rewind buttons,” Steve finished.
“The Skull desires a much grander prize—with no insult meant, Steven,” the other Thor had spoken. He had set the gauntlet on the table before them all. Of course, if the Red Skull was going to attempt to make some kind of ‘new multiverse order’, he was going to need as much power as possible to do it. Although No one from the 3490 universe seemed at all convinced that a gauntlet could influence anything beyond its own universal borders.
Being stripped of command, Steve wondered, or the unraveling? Because, if he still had the capacity to really feel, he would probably be afraid that both of those things would be far less temporary than Bucky promised.
or any of that crap. Tony was still himself, under that kiss, and still vaguely terrified and uncertain. But there was Steve, warm against him, sweet and gentle and clearly wanting. Steve was the first to break apart even as Tony was gasping for air and drawing him back down.
, so that you could be responsible and understanding and loving with them when I couldn’t. It’s not just—it’s not just that
Kate grabbed a gun off the nearest assailant, kicking him to the curb, literally. There was a man in a window, high up, who had been shooting at her for too long now. The adults were preoccupied. It wasn’t a bow, but she’d trained with this weapon, too.
Someone hit a home run. Dad and Kate stood and cheered and hollered. Kate jumped up and down and waved her arms in excitement. It was a while before either of them sat down again. Neither Peter nor James had stood at all. Dad sighed suddenly, turning to James.
“Don’t look at me like that,” she said. Steve, thoroughly chastened by this simple request, looked away, his face turning red. 3490 Tony looked at the rest of the alts. “Are we done then? Good. I’ll show you to—” Tony was yet again interrupted by 3490 Steve’s appearance.
The first thing Steve was aware of was a dull ache in his gut. He grunted and opened his eyes to darkness. There was only a faint blue glow in the corner of the room. Steve squinted, it was the Senator, absorbed in his tablet.
to see their stunned expressions. His mother appeared in front of him so suddenly Peter nearly disengaged from the wall in surprise.
“There are more than 32,000 known species of spider in the world. They are in the order Aranae, which is divided into three sub-orders—Mesothelea, Orthognatha, and Labidognatha. All spiders are carnivorous, ravenous eaters who feed on massive quantities of protein, in liquid form, usually the juices of their prey. Arachnids from each of the three groups possess varying strengths which help them in their constant search for food,” the tour guide explained as she led them around the insect room. Peter took a few shots of some of the spiders—they were all wicked looking creatures, many with bright colors, not at all the kind of spider you saw in the cobwebs back home in the attic. Peter noticed a black widow and took a shot.
these?) and took down a bot (set to EASY mode) with his bare hands. That was the other thing he’d gained proficiency in over the past three days—hand to hand combat. He was suddenly grateful at all the one-on-one sessions he’d had with Steve before—Rogers was a hard drill sergeant but he looked like a fluffy puppy next to his offspring from another universe. Tony was convinced James just liked to hear “drop and give me twenty” for the effect. Tony, of course, had not ever dropped and given twenty. He could admit he was old when he wanted to get out of something.
,” Peter insisted. 3490 Steve couldn’t argue with that, so he took a bit of his pancake instead. A moment later, mother and daughter reappeared in the doorway, both looking infuriated.
“All right, Rogers,” Jeanne spoke, stopping a few feet from where Francis and Kate sat. “You called us all here. Talk.” Kate met her gaze and said nothing. She stood, and then she jumped from the stairs onto the wide concrete railing, standing on the end and gazing out at all her peers so everyone could see her face.
“Yeah. Yeah I’ve got that. Thanks Tony. Merry Christmas,” he said. He left the lab after that, breathing deeply and staving off the waves of emotion he was experiencing. This was no time to get weepy. Kate had cookies to bake. Christmas depended on it. With that ridiculous mission in mind, James headed to the kitchen. Better a ridiculous mission on his mind than everything else.
Steve put the headphones back on quickly, and looked back at his drawing. He felt himself turn a bit pink as he looked at it. It wasn’t that Steve had drawn anything dirty. He hadn’t drawn his charge in the nude, or anything, or on a bed, or in a compromising pose. He’d just drawn his face, with special attention to those eyes. But the drawing felt particularly intimate, almost more intimate than a nude picture would be, and
“I’m on duty,” Steve said flatly. It took every ounce of self-control he had not to rise to the challenge, not to knock that smirk off Stark’s face—but even if he wasn’t on duty, it wouldn’t be right. Stark might have been in good shape—
“What, Tony? What could you possibly have to say for yourself? What could you possibly have to say to me at this point? You know for all the things Bernie did I’ll say this for her—she has
be a branch of HYDRA. We’re exploring that possibility, but so far our spies with the organization are coming up dry on info. We’ll pursue Fury, but in the mean time we just need to keep track of and keep a handle on the leaks.”
Kate began a list that day, of all the things she had achieved without her abilities, without her parents, of all the traits she could claim as her own. The first, and only thing, on the list was ‘
“Well,” 3490 Tony said, deadpan, “if I must put it bluntly, you all interrupted my date night with my husband. I had not seen him in three weeks before you arrived, and before that we’d been criminally busy for a month. So today I’ve cleared both our schedules—a fact he should be discovering right around now—and I intend to fuck my husband until he screams. Preferably several times. Now, I personally don’t give a fuck what you all do or don’t know about our personal lives because really, you’re all up in them anyway. But I think that my husband’s delicate sensibilities would never allow him to look any of you in the eye again, were you still around. Capisci?” Steve had reddened to the point of being a tomato. Tony was impressed that none of the other Avengers seemed at all fazed, though Jane had a hint of a blush.
“I’m not the one who replaced every Metallica song on my iPod with Black Sabbath,” mature Steve pointed out.

him, I really can’t believe it. He knows if something happened we wouldn’t be able to trace his location,” Antonella said. They discussed the matter a bit more as the Alts in the living room decided to relocate to the kitchen; Pepper had suggested they get some ice cream to cheer everyone and no one had disagreed. Even Antonella and 3490 Steve followed, though they didn’t partake of the dessert. Fifteen minutes later, the kitchen door opened and Peter walked in. He looked both well rested and tired at the same time. He was sweaty, like he’d gone for a run and hadn’t had time to shower.

? Where’s my phone, I need to record this for posterity,” Steve continued rummaging dramatically through his pockets. Tony just rolled his eyes.
“It’s…complicated. I think we have the best chance of keeping an eye on them here. We’ve put precautions in place—you know about those. I’d rather them try to plan something under our noses than at the Triskelion or elsewhere. Better chance of catching them if they’re around all the time. Doesn’t mean I like it, James,” Tony said.
, amidst the Avengers missions and late night paperwork, Steve had forgotten which lesson was the most important. It wasn’t honesty or integrity or respect or duty or responsibility or anything like that. It was love. Teach love, and everything else would follow in time. Did James even know that Steve loved him? He could tell him until he was blue in the face, but did he
know the system isn’t fair. All of us. But none of us legacies have any more power to change things than you do. Until now. You
He wondered under what circumstances he would. Clearly, some version of himself had wanted those things. Clearly, some version of himself had wanted those things with
“Do you remember when we first moved you and Peter into separate rooms?” Tony asked. The ghost of a smile crossed Kate’s face.
“You can’t hide it from me, Stark,” Steve said, grinning behind the top of his pint, “I’m onto you. You love kids. I bet you love puppies and kittens too.”
“It’s not—it’s not that I don’t want…to know. I just—I kind of wanted to figure out what I can do before I tell anybody about it. I want it to be…I want it to be

was what Tony had meant. Trust him to make the right decisions and come out on the other side a better person for it. It was why Kate had ended up the way that she did, Tony’s laissez-faire parenting style and her own deep fear of parental rifts.
that. Banner as Hulk might be able to tear down this whole mansion, and Thor might be able to summon lightning to our aid, but how quickly do you think this team would have those threats neutralized? My guess is
After a shower and some food, Steve headed to the conference room for a debrief with Fury. He found Tony as he was headed down there, and he couldn’t help but frown at the other man a bit. He was always taking unnecessary risks and not following orders and
your fault, do you understand me? It’s between us. Don’t you worry about it. Everything’s going to be fine. You just get your rest, all right?”
They couldn’t decide on a new game of cards to play. They’d already run through poker and blackjack, had burned through Kemps and Euchre. Bruce had dryly suggested Go Fish, but no one wanted to put themselves through voluntary torture. They weren’t at that point just yet. So they were sitting in silence, trying to think of a new game to play, when Clint spoke up.
“STAY DOWN, PARKER,” Flash roared. “WHO’S NEXT? WHO ELSE WANTS A PIECE OF—” Before Flash could find another ‘volunteer’ for a beating, a pretty blonde girl interrupted him. She spoke with him briefly, catching him off guard, distracting him from Peter who was still lying on the ground, doubled over in pain. The bell rang and she steered him towards class, sparing a look behind her for the boy still on the ground. To add insult to injury, some kid casually kicked Peter’s camera as he passed. Tony’s blood boiled at that simple gesture. As the crowd cleared, even Thor, Jane, and Pepper got out of the car.
“I figured you just had a stick up your ass,” Tony continued, “But I was wrong. Rhodey lets me forget, sometimes. Because he’s always laughing, and even as serious as he can get, he can take a joke. So he lets me forget that soldiers don’t always laugh, and the ones that don’t have a good reason not to. I just hope you know that sometimes laughter can help.”
“I know you’ll tell me it’s just part of your job. I know it was nothing personal, for you, that you’d have done it for anyone you were protecting,” Stark said seriously, “but you saved my life. You took a bullet for me. I’m not going to forget that.”
,” Peter said. He lifted his brother’s shirt and put web around the bullet wound; it would have to do for now.
. That was the day he found out what had really happened to Sergeant James Barnes. But this, well, this was definitely him struggling to regain control of himself. “Tony, I don’t want to sleep in the art room.”
“Any idea what the hell this is?” James asked MCU Steve. The other man, tired and bleeding from several cuts and grazes, shook his head.
“Can’t understand you when you talk that fast,” Azari interjected. Tommy slowed down, working his jaw in slower, exaggerated motion.
His parents weren’t at the table—predictably, they’d been called in the middle of the night to solve some great crisis and were absent. The Alts were there—well, Tony, Clint, and Steve, anyway—but they didn’t count as parents. They didn’t seem the types to rat, anyway, and mostly seemed to ignore himself and his siblings. Peter figured they freaked them out, coming from a universe where their parents were both guys, and all. Peter shuddered at the thought of discovering a universe where—God forbid—
A bomb blew up the car Kate was crouched atop—she had to leap from it and roll to avoid the attack. Peter, dressed in a black suit SHIELD had made up for him specifically for agility and soaring through the air, had to avoid bright little bullets that looked like lasers. It looked like something out of
“The metal man and the Captain,” he said, seemingly incapable of voicing anything else. Tony reached for Pepper’s hand, scrabbling for...something, though Tony didn't even know what. Pepper seemed grateful for the contact.
“Accounted for,” 3490 Steve said shortly. “Thor, Jane—you’re being reassigned. We could use your expertise, Dr. Foster, and an extra protective unit for the scientific team can’t hurt. We’ll be moving

to the wall with ten tons hanging off of you, but at what point does your arm rip from your body?” male Tony mused at one point.
“Don’t go there Peter,” Steve replied. “This isn’t your fault. Besides, those AIM agents would have found that entrance eventually, and then who knows what would have happened to all of you? I can’t believe our security didn’t pick it up faster.” Pick it up it had, of course—the Avengers of 3490 had arrived to find the MCU Avengers and the kids fighting off a whole hoard of agents in the warehouse. When the 3490 Avengers arrived, they made quick work of them. Steve hadn’t been pleased that the bunker had been found, but he
Pepper Potts had been happy with her crazy life. She had been happy with what she had. She had never envisioned the possibility that she could have

what was happening, but Tony figured it would be an apt enough description for the layman. Tony heard a few more guns get loaded. The console began to shake, and small items to rattle—pens vibrated on desks, coffee mugs began to slosh their contents—and then a bright blue light broke through the ceiling of the helicarrier, going straight through the central console. Tony closed her eyes as the light got too bright, and then, when she could sense that it was darker, she opened them again.
“Beautiful weather today, right?” he asked. “The sun is shining, it’s pretty warm for January—it’d be perfect if it weren’t for the bad case of temporal displacement, you know?” Francis looked like this was all one giant party that had been assembled especially for him, and he was trying to get Kate in on the fun. He had always been like that, had always been that charming. She had always thought he’d saved a special smile for her, had held back jokes just for her entertainment. He had always made her feel so special—she just wished she’d realized earlier that it was all in her head.
. And not just Avengers. Anyone with powers. You know in every world we’ve been to, we’ve only ever seen the destruction wrought by our kind. So we’re doing what we do best. We’re eliminating the threat to humanity.”
“James,” Steve said, surprising Tony and apparently surprising James a bit too. His eyes flickered to the other man briefly. “Stand down, soldier. We are
Of course, he didn’t know how to talk to Tony. He had never begun a friendly conversation with the other man. They had nothing in common, nothing
“James just shut up ok? He’s got a point. We were being rude to our guests,” Kate said, placating. Defiance still flashed in their brother’s eyes. But he didn’t speak further. He just stood.
Steve knew exactly how many times he’d said those same words to a man who died minutes later. It was five.
Much of the dialogue Clint gives in this chapter is taken straight from the comics, mainly Young Avengers Presents #6, just FYI!
James wondered if his dad would move them now, when the manor was now so filled with ghosts. He wondered if his dad was laying awake in his bed, too. And then the more James thought about that last singular thing, the more he had an urge he couldn’t ignore. He threw off his covers and tip toed down the hall like he’d done so many times as a little boy. When he reached his dad’s room, he slowly cracked open the door and peeked inside.
“What can I do for you, Captain Rogers?” she asked. Steve walked over to her and set down the plate he carried on her workbench. 3490 Tony set down her project and looked up at him.
as Bruce had the results from his tests that proved that Peter was in perfect health and was (likely) going to stay that way that Peter would tell his parents. Bruce had gotten the results back that morning, and Tony had confronted him with a raised eyebrow and folded arms that afternoon when he got back from school. His parents had returned home in time for dinner—Peter didn’t tell them before, or during, and after dinner Tony gave him that
It only took Peter a second for the thought to occur and a decision to be made. He knelt down next to where Kate still sat cross legged on the floor.
“Jane told me it was custom to raise your hand in response to questions in a classroom setting,” Thor informed them, looking confused.
“Bucky. Got another name for us? Because that’s not much to go on. We’re thinking maybe it’s a nickname?” Stark said, his voice lilting upwards in a question as he looked, puzzled, at his tablet. Googling, Steve thought.
“You set a date and we’ll be there,” Steve said. “The sooner the better for all of us.” Commander Rogers smiled, and it took all of Steve’s strength to smile back and not punch the other man in the face.
heavy.” James just shook his head, and even that looked like it took effort. He moved his right hand to his abdomen.
“So this other universe,” Peter spoke suddenly, apparently addressing Steve, “do you still have pancakes?” Tony couldn’t tell whether or not he was joking.
James thought briefly about bringing the little box with him. Perhaps Dad had been right, perhaps they still had a little luck left in them—after all, they’d come with him out of the ice after being frozen for forty-five years. But no—he wouldn’t want to lose them. Nor would he want to, even for a second, be mistaken for his father on the battlefield. He put the tags back in the box, shut the lid and did up the latch. He returned it to its place on the shelf. He opened the drawer in his desk and took out the zip drive that had been his real purpose for coming upstairs, pocketed it, and headed back down towards the lab.

“Did you ever think about what I want?” Kate asked, somewhat hysterical. She knew her voice was high pitched and practically squeaky. “My mother is
“I heard about Tony. I’ll believe it when I see it. That woman has a way of appearing at the most inconvenient times just when you think she’s gone,” Fury said. Steve very near punched him. His hand
“I don’t know about you all, but I’m starving. Why don’t we get something to eat and then I’ll show you to the guest rooms?” 3490 Tony suggested. It was strange hearing her voice. It wasn’t low or high for a woman, just an average range, like Pepper. It was melodic, however, and smooth, like she had trained in classical singing before. Tony guessed she probably had, perhaps at mother’s insistence.
as strong as vibranium, but it’s light and it’ll fend off bullets, so it should do for you for now.” Tony beamed at him. “So, what do you think?”
He’d shared a look with Tony, right before they headed out. There was something silent there that they’d never really had before: understanding. Oh sure, they’d tried. Sometimes. But now, after these months in another universe, after spending far more time with Tony Stark than he’d ever thought he’d spend, Steve felt like he finally understood the other man. Maybe not all the way through. Maybe not one hundred percent—but they knew how the other ticked, now, not just how to tick each other off.
“Because I like playing cruel jokes on myself? Fuck, I don’t know,” Antonella said, taking the glass and the bottle with her and plopping in the armchair across from Tony. She turned it towards him and shook it slightly. It was, indeed, Welch’s sparkling grape juice. She set the bottle down on an end table and sipped at the glass, which bubbled appropriately. “No. I do know. I’ve gotten shit faced in here so many times this has become my have-a-breakdown spot. And if I can’t get drunk I’m going to get
something about his situation. It was wrong, he knew. It was wrong to want to snap somebody’s neck for everything that had happened. But he couldn’t help but feel it. He felt anger and resentment and grief. He did not feel guilt. Words, old words, rang in his ears, painful now for the truth he was dangerously teetering towards:
She had a book in her hand, and a mug of tea, but she’d put both of those down on an end table so that she could solemnly shake the hand of an insistent little red headed girl dressed as a princess who was probably no more than eight years old. She had a soft smile on her face as she did so, as she spoke with the little girl, and her older brother, who was likely twelve or thirteen. Eventually she stopped and conversed briefly with their parents, 3490 Pepper and 3490 Pepper’s husband, Happy. Tony could see the wistfulness in her eyes. He could see the longing and the soft jealousy as the little red head tugged at her mother’s dress and demanded they move on to other houses for trick-or-treating.
Of course she was here, for him. Of course. She was even sporting a baby bump, as if time had passed for her, too. She looked five, maybe six months along. Steve knew what he must look like, stuck up at the pulpit, unmoving and unspeaking, the story going unfinished as the crowd began to react, to gasp and murmur at why he’d stopped. Steve, for one, wasn’t entirely surprised he’d gone mad. If anything was ever going to drive him there, it was going to have been the last couple of months. He could weather anything with Tony by his side—without her, his ability was definitely in doubt. It made sense to him, that his mind had decided to just bring her back. Steve just opened his mouth, ready to finish the story, when his daughter stood up so fast she was nearly a blur and shrieked,

how do you not complain about that more often? How do you even keep moving after that? You baffle me, Rogers,” Tony said, shaking his head.
“I think…I think he’d rather hear it from you than anyone else, Tony,” Steve said. His thumb was moving in soothing circles again, and Tony never wanted him to stop.
“Well they’re not lying on that one,” Jane said. “I’ve been running the specs on my own. Their Doctor Richards gave me his numbers and they’re
“Well maybe if you’d let me in on your little plan instead of just letting me play Lookout I would have stayed put,” Tony snapped.

It was chaos, all around them. People shouting and running this way and that. The patterns weren’t predictable as Hydra agents made their way to various positions throughout the castle, ready to fend off the attackers out front. If even one agent spotted them, they would be swarmed. Overwhelmed almost instantly. Kate knew that, for all of her training, she wasn’t going to be able to fight off this many people at once. And it was made worse, she thought, by the fact that these were the same weapons, and the same type of people, who had haunted her father’s nightmares for decades. They were a fairy story. A bedtime cautionary tale. The red skull had never been real to her—not until they turned a corner into what was once the palace’s great hall and found him at the back and center, where one might have found a throne. There were no other agents to be seen. He was waiting for them. Clearly, obviously, waiting for them.

“I—I heard about your argument with Peter,” Steve said cautiously. James shifted, then winced. He looked like he didn’t know whether to be defensive or uncomfortable.
“We’re sorry for your loss,” Tony spoke from beside him. 3490 Steve just looked further wounded as he glanced up at Tony. He looked out at the other kids, then to James.

“Oh? Really? Well that’s—hey, I mean, congrats—” Steve pulled Tony close with one arm wrapped firmly around his waist.
for the little kids. Most of the younger kids laid on the floor in their pajamas with blankets and pillows. There weren’t enough bedrooms in the bunker, so Tony knew they would be sleeping there again that night. Francis, Torrun, James, and some of the older kids had been busy passing out bowls of soup in little plastic disposable bowls to the younger kids. Steve handed him a bowl. Tony took it and looked down at the contents of the bowl. “Something wrong?”
asked when Peter came in from school. Peter had lied, and his double had believed him. Peter didn’t, after all, seem like the type of kid to lie. Could he really hold a grudge against her for gullibility? For trusting? Tony didn’t know. He felt conflicted. There was a kid with a black and blue rib cage alone in his room and Tony felt like he had to blame
—” Peter kissed his mother on the cheek and then headed for the fridge. He opened it up and just dove right in. He pulled out a plate of leftover meatloaf from a few nights before—a truly horrendous meal, Tony had to admit—and started eating it cold.
“Then I dare you to go out on the balcony and climb over to us from outside,” Callum challenged. Peter looked out the window. It was, of course, free of any ledges; it was nothing but a sheet of wide glass, uninterrupted to allow for the best view. The balcony was on the other side of the penthouse, and they were 93 stories up—a thousand feet in the air. Peter had never been a fan of heights, but Callum had his arms crossed and an eyebrow arched and Peter had never felt a stronger desire to show up a ten year old.
“I believe their teacher complained to the school district about my language and behavior,” Tony said, rolling his eyes.

“No archery with Francis and Clint for two weeks,” 3490 Tony answered. “No training session at the Academy for the same amount of time. Grounded for a month, and no medication for her hangover today.” 3490 Tony sat with her newly filled coffee mug, still looking murderous.
“I don’t—I’m not really sure on the specifics,” Peter admitted finally. There was no point in hiding it when he’d been caught stuck to the ceiling. “But, short story, I got bit by a spider on my field trip.” Alt Tony raised both of his eyebrows practically into his hairline.

“That’s the thing, Cap,” Tony said, combing over bits of the jacket, “I didn’t bring my phone with me.” He grabbed his wallet and started emptying it. He grabbed the credit card 3490 Tony had issued each of them. He squinted at it. “Could be in here, but I don’t think so. I was paying at the bar with cash.”
That rang alarm bells in Steve’s head, but for the moment he was willing to believe their story—that they had dealt with this before. Fine. He could give them the benefit of the doubt for the time being. They
Since Steve was being so bullheaded about speaking with her—and she was not unfamiliar with Steve’s bullheadedness—Tony had resorted to slightly underhanded measures. She had sent out a text, copied to everyone on the invitation list for the Avenger’s Annual Christmas Eve party, telling them the party now began at four, two hours early. She had then immediately texted everyone
And that was when Peter’s heart really filled with dread. The building was collapsing. That was not a light roof over him—not to mention there was an entire
Breakfast with the Rogers brats without their parents was supremely strange, Tony thought the next morning. It was a Friday, and some of the Avengers decided to take a long weekend, sleeping in. So, at the breakfast table it was just Tony, Pepper, Natasha, Steve, and the teenagers. Peter had obviously just rolled out of bed. He was still rubbing sleep out of his eyes. His brown hair was sticking up in every direction and he was still in sweats and an overlarge t-shirt. Kate, by contrast, was already completely ready. Her make-up was done with obvious finesse, her shiny black hair was half-up and free of frizz, and her uniform was crisp and clean. Peter ate Cocoa Puffs, Kate ate a grapefruit and a croissant. They might have been twins, but you never would have known it by looking at them. They didn’t even go to the same schools, which Tony didn’t understand.
It wasn’t long before the static returned, and Captain Marvel and Falcon announced their arrival. Now that the aerial battle was evened out, some of the doombots were backed down to the ground, and the other Avengers returned to the fight. Fifteen minutes later, all of the doombots left made a concerted effort to retreat, fleeing in wild patterns. It didn’t take much longer until the Commander returned over the comms
“Clearly this guy didn’t hear my gun lecture,” Peter yelled to his brother as he approached, coming from another side to kick this asshole off the rafter with both feet. But Peter impacted into nothing to his surprise—he ended up swinging right past the rafter where the sniper had been standing and landed on the next beam over. The sniper guy had

much about science. He’d been a liberal arts kid. He knew the basics, and he knew anything that was practical to know—how to hot wire a car, for instance, or defuse a more simple bomb. But he wasn’t an expert in trans-multi-versal travel, or time travel (despite his own similar experience), or nanotech, or any of the other crazy things some of his teammates understood. However, despite Steve’s relatively limited understanding, he did understand three things: one, the space stone opened doors in or through space. Two, the universe around them was full of holes because of too much destructive travel through it. So, three—those two things together were

himself. But, as Steve Rogers are wont to do, his double appeared to be fast developing feelings for his wife. Steve wasn’t sure how to curb and discourage this behavior. After all, no amount of his own conscious telling him how bad an idea it was to fall in love with Tony had ever really stopped him, so what hope did Steve now have as an external, rather than internal, force have? None, he figured. Steve took another sip of his coffee before turning back to Tony. It probably couldn’t be helped. But it didn’t matter. It wasn’t like his younger double would act on it. It just meant that, as soon as he was back in his own universe, he’d have even more problems to deal with.
“What do you think?” she asked. “A thousand things, starting with Steve. He was thrilled and crushed in the span of about sixty seconds when I told him—thrilled I was pregnant, crushed that I was set on terminating the pregnancy. He tried not to show it. He tried to be supportive. He held me when I cried and assured me that I wasn’t an awful person.” She smiled at Tony, a bit wryly. “I know Steve, though. I knew how he felt about it. But nevertheless he came with me to the clinic and held my hand while we waited for the doctor to call me to the back while I was just hoping against hope that no one would recognize us and try to snap a picture—conveniently this was before cell phone cameras had really gotten off the ground, otherwise I’m sure someone would have.
“Marvelously Cinematic, huh?” Peter asked his brother as the alts gathered across from them, not looking particularly pleased. James just smirked.

to the younger kids (and secretly captivated adults) before they were sent to bed for the evening. Aside from that sacred tradition, she knew he would be there for Kate and Peter. They would never forgive him if he wasn’t, and Tony still believed that neither would he.
I found it difficult after I finished university to write fanfic. I felt like I needed to be productive all the time, because I hadn't hit any of my real life career goals. In fact, I was kind of floundering in that area for a long time. Fanfic was fun, and I shouldn't be wasting my time on it. And then when I inevitably wasted my time on other things, I felt bad that I wasn't wasting my time on fanfic, where people were waiting for updates on things. And so, caught in various guilt cycles, I didn't write any fanfic at all for a long time.
“If I’m an ass, what are you?” she asked simply. “The innocent victim of this circumstance? A normal girl, being put upon? A star pupil, who has risen through the ranks on all her own merits?”
It had been relatively easy the last time. She was thirty, pregnant with her boyfriend’s child (children), and terrified out of her fucking mind. They had only been officially dating for nine months, and she’d gone and fucked it all up. He had only gotten divorced two years earlier, and he already had a kid—one he was suing for full custody of. It was a sticky enough situation without Tony throwing a wrench in the works. She’d sunk to the bathroom floor and collapsed into tears, and that was where he’d found her fifteen minutes later, still clutching the test. It hadn’t been a great way for him to find out, but it had been
Steve wondered how much alike this Tony was to his wife. What had he gone through, alone? He had been standing by his wife’s side since she was twenty years old. He knew everything that he’d had to pull her out of, recalled vividly every time he’d had to help her keep standing on her own. This Tony had done it all by himself.
“Kid’s right, Steve,” MCU Tony said heavily. “Antonella’s armors were better than mine, but I got a few up close looks and—they still have their limits. They aren’t magic or Asgardian.” Peter zoned out from whatever else they had to say.

“Shut up, Kate,” Tony said affectionately, which earned her the smallest hint of an upward curl to Kate’s mouth, which was as close as Tony had managed to get her to a smile in months. Tony was content. The rest of the Other Avengers appeared to be as well, as best they
“I think my husband would say it’s adultery either way, so it doesn’t matter much,” she replied. Other Tony’s smile was wiped away in an instant, though Tony couldn’t determine why. Commitment issues, perhaps? She didn’t have time to speculate. She was distracted by the arrival of Maria Hill and the blood kit she had asked for. The Alts broke into their own conversations, to which Tony paid little attention. The other SHIELD agents would inform her if there was anything she needed to know about, and the general gist of what she half heard was simply along the lines of panicking over being in another universe (Pepper), calmly deciding that they should keep their cool and figure out what to do after having a better understanding of the situation (Steve and Coulson), and finding their doubles and having orgies (Clint and Other Tony). Jane and Thor were having a quiet conversation that Tony could not hear. Bruce and Fury were being relatively quiet, as was Natasha. Tony hated it when Natasha was quiet. It was never a good sign. She didn’t like it when Bruce was, either.
“Not quickly, no,” Steve replied, a hard expression on his face. “I think that kid broke a rib or two with the kick—Peter should have gotten up before now.” As they spoke, Peter slowly began to move; when his body contracted, moving his ribcage a bit much, the avengers heard a pained grunt. He scrabbled for his broken camera and sat there, examining the back of it briefly, checking to make sure none of the essential parts were broken. He closed the flap and started to stand—and as his eyes came up, they fell on the Avengers. He stood there, staring for a moment. Tony took the form from Jane.
. They had been staying at the mansion with the Stark Rogers family for seven weeks now, with no real word on when they would be leaving. That didn’t bother Steve as much as it should have. What bothered Steve was that he couldn’t seem to get her out of his head.
Steve turned off the water of the shower, wrapped a towel around his waist, and headed for his duffel filled with fresh clothes. Thor and Clint were already changing. Clint might be rather bruised as well, but Steve didn’t think Clint minded much. By the careful, deep breaths he took, Steve figured that it was the

“Yes, sweetheart, bad people,” Jane said hurriedly. They were almost out of the house. James walked quickly at the head of the pack; Jane was behind them all, keeping an eye out. Her eyes darted everywhere. James had never seen her scared before, but he could tell that she was now. James opened up the sliding glass door that led to the garden.

about being a mother—seeing that look on his face? It was so worth it. So very worth it.” Antonella grabbed her sparkling juice again and sipped at it.
Kate’s words rang in his ears, ominous. No, he hadn’t had a clue. But he was starting to get the picture.
“Nobody should have that kind of power,” Tony had said afterwards when Thor asked after it. He looked pale and a bit shaken. “I sent it off to the four winds, or whatever. It’s all over.”

Tony would have liked to have described the hum of the helicarrier as quiet and soothing as that was what she wished it was, but the hum of the helicarrier was actually quite loud when one stood on the top of the upper deck during take off. The propellers labored audibly, slicing through the air with a whistle and working to spray the water out of the works. Tony did not prefer to be on the ocean. Sure, the helicarrier was made for it, but she was
