Oh, obviously it was. He looked very different, with a face full of stubble and without the slicked back hair, but this was clearly the doctor who’d worked on Bucky’s arm before Tony did… the ‘leading neurologist’, with his patented wiring…
He sighed heavily, and turned to walk into the room. He knew that he should probably be doing his own reconnaissance right now, but he was still waiting for his head to click into gear. He hadn’t figured out which thoughts he was supposed to be ignoring and which he should be forcing himself to focus on… so, for a few moments, he just didn’t. He simply wandered through the suite, in a miserable sort of haze, and tried to take in his surroundings.
“He’s the central character in this showcase… but you don’t want him to speak?” Tony enquired, narrowing his eyes. The Rousseau looked back blankly,
But then, there were also times that he was very glad that he could be in someone else's company. Times when he wanted to avoid the quiet, or wanted someone to share it with. Times when he just liked to know that there was someone else in the house - even though, so far, Steve and Tony had made sure that one of them was always home.
Steve held still inside him the entire him, his fingers flexing gently against Tony’s him as he moaned and pleaded his way through his orgasm. Tony had no idea how long it was, before the intensity of it began to dissolve into shivers, and then simmer into a low, pulsing satisfaction.
Steve subconsciously rubbed his palms on the fabric of the couch – again. He could swear his hands weren’t this sweaty when they left the room… and he
And that, now that he thought of it, Steve quite often took little titbits out of Tony’s small talk… In just this way, actually…
Steve smiled a thank you, and allowed himself to like that thought for a couple of seconds… until his mind drifted into familiar territory.
When Steve broke away this time, Tony didn’t have the oxygen to protest. He could only gasp, and keep trying to writhe up against him, even as Steve sat up completely, kneeling between his legs and looking down over him… Tony felt his heart stall in his chest, even
When Tony let go, the whole world returned to Steve in a rush. They were already standing by another bar, a few feet away from the dark-haired woman.
“She was a nurse who worked with my mom – well, I think actually she was my mom’s boss… She was another Irish Immigrant.” Steve smiled fondly, as he moved the pan onto the range and put it on a low heat. “She used to cook this by the gallon, and just hand out bowls of it to people in the neighbourhood. This was back in the thirties, when basically everyone in the neighbourhood was starving…” He was glad that Tony’s eyes lit up at that, that Tony seemed genuinely touched by the idea. “And this was cheap to make, and easy to make in big quantities, and takes about ten minutes. And you could usually get the ingredients for it – well, she could. Her husband was… Chinese Mauritian, I think? But I remember that if anyone wanted to make this for themselves, they went to him to get soy sauce… and everyone went to Mrs Sastry for rice…”
...But the important part was that they weren’t going to get away with this. As it turned out, that mattered.
Steve could’ve swore he saw the slightest stutter in Adam’s performance, brief though it had been. That perhaps he’d been just a
Steve had been determined to protect Tony from the consequences of it, this time. So careful to make sure Tony wouldn’t be held responsible for any of it, that it wouldn’t cost him anything - that his feelings wouldn’t get hurt, this time…
The same strange square writing, like the author had been using graph paper as guidelines… Like an alien trying to make sense of all those erratic sweeps and loops and curves, he reasoned. Trying to make earth’s languages look more like their own.
sort of relationship with Steve… After all these years casually dismissing that perspective, as though it were
Tony was barely aware that his mind was working as efficiently as it ever had, that he was as focused and as capable as he’d ever been in his life.
“What if it just never occurred to you to wonder?” Adam huffed, impatiently. “Whatever revelations you’ve come to this week, whatever you’ve worked out about each other – whatever
“Hi guys!” Tony waved brightly. “Long story, and can’t explain it all now, but this is Zan – her family are involved in the shit-show happening here, and she asked for our help in stopping them. She has a recording of her own confession on UBS number one – I suggest you listen to that first, if you want some idea of what’s going on.”
“Ah, but you can explain it.” Tony found himself assuring, calmly. “They’re putting drugs in the water, we’ve just seen it with our own eyes. I’m not thinking of it as anything more than that.” Was a lie, obviously – but Steve seemed greatly reassured. And that gave Tony a warm, soft feeling he hadn’t had for a very long time…
“Yeah, sorry… calling Natasha,” Tony breathed. Gearing himself up. Telling himself that this was just one thing, and he could do this-
And now it looked as though they were going to spend the next ten days struggling to make eye contact.
“So, in conclusion,” Tony announced, theatrically. “Since you went on your last trip, I have fallen in love with a man I can never have, had sex with him knowing full well it can’t go anywhere, and I’m already doubting my ability to not lead him on. And I broke all the rules I’ve had for the last twenty years, and now I can’t remember why they were rules. And I’m not sure if I’m actually less of a monster than I thought I was, or way more of a monster than I ever imagined. And it’s possible I just wasted the last twenty years of my life, because I never needed to do any of this,
At once, he was possessed of an almost physical panic, as he realised that he didn’t have words to explain how much he wanted to - that there
was cut off by a cry, as Steve forced him back into the tight heat of his throat. The sensation was so intense that it bordered on pain, jolting up through that thick, throbbing pleasure, tensing every muscle in his body. He could feel every nerve screaming as Steve pulled back again, dragging those beautiful lips the length of his cock. And then he heard Steve groan – a low, wanton sound that was without question the hottest thing Tony had ever heard in his life. There was a sudden increase in the pressure in his hips, an obvious sharpening in the friction grinding through him-
himself to stay still. He’d given up on that after two and a half hours… and since then the concept of bedtime was just sort of… fading from his reality…
intense,” he conceded, “I don’t think they used those exact words at the time. But it still felt more like controlling the conditions for a chemical process than paining a picture. Like, when they explained how baking soda worked, or why pastry has to be rolled out on a cold surface, or why eggs curdle. And, I’m not saying there isn’t an art to baking – I’m not exactly great at that, either. But, I don’t know… it just always
He didn’t know how long, trying to think of how bad the worst-case scenario could possibly be – and really, what was the point of that?
“Yes,” Tony answered immediately, his voice still high and breathless. “Yes, I do. Just - just as soon as I’m sure my legs are working…”
Worrying that it meant he didn’t really know himself, that he might be fucking things up without even knowing it.
Bucky and Sam nodded and gathered themselves to leave, while at the other end of the table another waiter coaxed the same reaction out of Rhodey and Tony and Pepper.
But, in the meantime, I sincerely hope you enjoy this one! As ever, all feedback is gratefully received 💖
And then, just as he was beginning to ask himself what happened, he felt the slightest little shift on the mattress beside him - and he remembered.
Lovelier than he’d ever been, even in Steve’s imagination. His eyes shone even brighter than they usually did, and his lips were fuller, and his skin practically
, Zan bought it. She straightened slightly, and nodded, and took a chunky iron bar out of her pocket, about the size of a remote control. She walked over to Tony, and showed him the little screen on the front of it as she told him,
” Tony keened, breaking down into a howling moan as Steve sucked a deep, bruising kiss an inch above his waistband. His hips tried to jump upwards, but were pinned in place under the stoic strength of Steve’s palms-
“One verbal communication over a civilian phone line,” Nick sighed. “So, we can’t be sure they were free to talk… But, best we can guess, someone is using a kind-of illegal hotel as a base for a more illegal operation – we don’t know if the people at the hotel are involved, or even if they know…” And then he cleared his throat, which Steve knew was a bad sign… “And, unless it was meant to be a code for something, it seems like the place only accepts reservations from couples. Seeing as our agents didn’t know that before they arrived, that might be what got them caught.”
Although, not much of one, Tony realised with a sigh. Not if he still couldn’t know what he was even supposed to be protecting Steve
, not like I would anyone else – I’m sorry I haven’t done that a thousand other times that we’ll just have to get to when I’m not high”
“Uh, two pans and something to drain the rice,” Steve replied, because he’d momentarily forgotten the word for ‘colander’. But Tony seemed to know what he was talking about and went over to one of the cleverly concealed cabinets, which Steve took as an opportunity to have a better look around the kitchen.
“C’mere” He whispered, stroking his hand over Tony’s face and shifting his position, encouraging him,
sorry you were hurt. I was so sorry for all those things, and I just – didn’t think you’d want to hear any of it. I didn’t know whether to send that letter at all, and then I couldn’t think what I could possibly say, if I should try and explain it or if that would just come across as giving excuses, if I should just tell you that I’m an idiot and honestly, I don’t even
And then he might move on to practical concerns, perhaps. Remembering that it had now been nearly a week since he drank, and still he didn’t feel hungry… Remembering just how much he wanted to drink again anyway, simply because he wanted that taste, that
“But the Councilmen and the Government and the neighbours, they wouldn’t stop harassing him, and eventually he looked into what he could develop to
like he had a plan for world domination, if he tried to explain it like that. Which, as well as making him sound crazy, was also horribly misleading.
, or because he felt like Tony should, he couldn’t exactly say. But it was a jealous feeling, certainly.
And then Tony stepped away, and there was the soft sweeping sound as Tony slipped his jacket over his shoulders.
He almost laughed. Of course, he knew it defeated the object, to be so aware of a mantra like that… But it was still one step away from allowing himself to wonder if Steve really meant it, or what a life with Steve would look like, or if-
“Do you know what’s up there? What happens on the fourth floor?” Tony asked. Maribelle shook her head.
of something. He didn’t know what to call that feeling… Like everything, it just sort of washed over him, without any analysis… But unlike everything else, those memories got a reaction. They made his skin pleasantly warm. They made him smile, and unconsciously put his arms around himself. He could fall into those memories, for endless minutes at a time, before he snapped himself out of it and back into… nothing at all, really.
“…All of them, sir?” JARVIS enquired, sounding sceptical – but he’d barely finished the last word before Tony clarified, tetchily,
Wanda looked up, right at Steve, her jaw set in steely defiance. Steve felt a spike of adrenaline, a primal sort of temper that he hadn’t felt since he was scrapping in a schoolyard in Brooklyn.
As it turned out, anxiety and doubt and fears for the future were all just inventions of the reality he’d left behind. Time itself seemed to no longer apply. Steve had no idea how long it had been since Tony drifted into sleep, right there in his arms. How long Steve had been lying here, staring at that beautiful face, tracing gentle touches over Tony’s back. How many times he’d buried his head into Tony’s hair, and just breathed him in.
All of that was so immediately, emotionally overwhelming that it took Steve a few seconds to realise…
“I, uh, finally got my shit together and I told Steve I love him,” Tony confessed. The pleasant blush deepened as he saw Rhodey’s eyes flash with a childish excitement.
Everything about that image was familiar, from the little boys home-knitted cardigan, to the bulky hooded pram that the young woman was pushing… Even the tone of her voice as she yelled after him,
His desperation to see Tony grew ever sharper, as Steve struggled with the impossible fear of losing him.
“Hm,” Steve nodded - because, obviously, he already knew the answer to his own question. And then he took a breath, and made sure to look Tony right in the eye as he told him, very calmly, “well, I know you always want to gather as much detail as possible, whenever you do experiments. So, let me be very clear, just for the sake of your notes - you can be defensive if you want to be. You can be outright aggressive if you like. I’m still going to love you, and I’m still going to have your back, and I’m still going to be on your side, completely and without qualification. Even if you snap at me and mock me and challenge me… Even if you
“Meaning?” Tony asked, just slightly irritably. Steve looked up, and blinked, liked he was surprised to realise he’d said that out loud… He frowned, and gave his head a dismissive little shake.
“Is that their only listed office?” Pepper asked, “I mean, lots of companies list a small office in Manhattan for the zip code, and do their real business elsewhere-”
“Like whether slavery is legal and accepted on Anni Vara, or whether this is a super villain at work?” Steve sighed, rubbing his eyes.
“Do you, uh, want to sit down?” Tony suggested, because his legs still felt weak. And Steve exhaled, and nodded, and stepped back to sink into the couch. And Tony sat at the other end, leaving just enough distance – wanting to make sure he got this out properly before he gave into temptation and just crawled into Steve’s lap
He could only process how to protect Tony from it, so quickly and in such depth that it blotted everything else out-
An illicit thrill ran up Steve’s spine as he slid a hand under Tony’s shirt, stroking greedily over his bare skin. Steve couldn’t help biting his lip, trying to stay quiet even though he liked it every time he failed.
kind of interesting,” Steve confessed. “Although don’t tell Nat I said so, I’ll never hear the end of it.”
Steve had never been one to daydream about tropical beaches or exotic getaways. Not that he had anything
this right. If Tony woke up and told him that he was still mad at Bucky, that he’d assumed Steve’s apology included agreeing with him on that… Then there
My apologies that this update comes a little late in the day - the short explanation would be that rural broadband in the UK sucks. However, you do have a slightly longer update to compensate!
...And then he realised that he’d never seen Tony learn that Captain America was alive, the first time around.
“Okay, take a deep breath for me Wesley, you’re doing great,” Tony told him, cynically. But Wesley stopped and took a deep breath anyway. “How many times did this guy call you?”
He was suddenly very aware that forgiving Steve, and loving Steve, and actually having a life with Steve, were all very different things. That he had no idea what that life would even look like.
He was jealous of those women because they got to see Tony. But he was also jealous because they could let Tony see
- I would fight anyone, and risk anything, for the chance to see you, just for a night. I have missed you so, so much… But there is nothing that would make me jeopardize our future together. I
Perhaps that would’ve been a more confusing or disappointing thought, if he’d been more sober - but as it was, it came to him remarkably easily.
What Steve had already given him was powerful enough to overcome everything – even the absence of Steve.
On the largest of the couches, directly facing the door that the team had walked in through, two seemingly human men were perched, their hands on their knees, tensed with excitement.
“We need to ask you some questions, and I know it’s not going to make any sense why we’re asking, but this is going to be quicker if you just answer – and we really need to be quick here, okay?” He explained. And she nodded. “And we really need you to be honest with us right now. Even things that you’re sure don’t matter, you
All the air just evaporated out of Steve’s lungs. He found himself standing to attention, even though his knees suddenly felt dangerously weak-
For the first time ever, Steve was thinking about human nature as though he was a part of it - as though it was okay for him to have the same moral limits and human failings as anyone else.
There was a… quality, in Steve that night. Something Tony wanted to call possessive, even though that didn’t really fit. A
important – whatever Steve tried to tell himself. And he had tried. He’d given himself the stern talking to, and the motivational pep talk. He’d reminded himself of all the oaths he had taken and all the people who relied on him. He’d tried to warn himself about all the bad things that might happen if he didn’t concentrate,
Steve huffed again, pointedly pushing his food away from him. He knew that he was being childish and sulky… And he couldn’t tell if that
Steve just smiled at that, as he added a sprinkle of sugar and a dash of soy sauce. And then Tony carried on, thoughtfully,
still felt he needed to apologise for, even if Steve didn’t have anything else. And he knew, really, Steve must have other things… That there must’ve been things that’d gotten to Steve over the years, ways that Tony’s misconceptions had hurt him… things he just wasn’t thinking of right now…
Petulantly, Steve focused his vision on the page in front of him, and read the title for the third time today.
“Hey,” Tony greeted him with a sad smile, his body softened by that hopeless sort of kindness you see at funerals.
“Hey, hey, can you hear me?” Tony tried to keep his voice calm and level. The photographer simply groaned in response. “Hey, come on pal, I need you to answer me, can you hear me?” Tony spoke more sharply, leaning closer.
complicated, that no amount of ideological speeches would simplify it, that a complex solution was needed.
“I guess… I just couldn’t think of a reason it wasn’t?” He offered, nervously. “I mean, I did try to think of why it might be a bad idea… But, I don’t know, I figured if
And Tony just let himself get carried away with the melody of Steve’s voice, picturing his face, the exact way he’d be standing right now…
under him like that. It confused his brain right in the middle of taking the next step, so it just stopped taking it – and then Steve found himself falling onto his knees with a soft bump.
for once - and he didn’t even know what it was. Only that this was completely different to any of the looks he usually got when he tried to explain himself...
It wasn’t only the bruised ache around his eyes, or the thickness of his headache. It was the way his emotions weighed down on him like a cold blanket, the feeling of being entirely submerged in sadness and anxiety, from the moment he opened his eyes-
“Of course, I do,” Steve managed eventually. “Tony, that’s… I… I don’t know what to…” But Tony just shook his head, kindly.
“I love it,” Steve answered quickly. Just for once he wasn’t worried that he sounded every bit as awed as he was - he was glad, actually. He wanted Tony to know.
found the bad connection, then we’ve found it earlier than I was expecting,” Tony carried on, seemingly oblivious. “And that actually makes the rest of the treatment much easier – probably means you’ll be done with me sooner than you thought.”
And Tony could see a thoughtful… growing more emotional… expression on Steve face – and Dear Lord he hoped that was good amazed and not what-the-fuck amazed…
“But, yeah, I want to be your boyfriend. I want to wake up next to you every morning, and come home to you every day, and just be able to kiss you, and tell you I love you, and have fun with you like this. And if that’s what you want-”
Usually, there were all sorts of horrible consequences and compromises left in the wake of his worse experiences… But there was nothing left to panic about, this time. No reason to swallow down his emotions, no ongoing catastrophe he had to focus on. There had been no terrible consequences, no loss. There was nothing for him to sit there and grieve, no unanswerable questions of how he was going to carry on.
“You know, one of the things I’ve thought about all this is that… in some ways, it makes me more vulnerable,” he said, carefully. “There was a moment, back at that warehouse, when I was trying to think of ways to stop them from taking my blood… And I thought of the power they had over me now, that fear I have now that I didn’t have before. A way they had to hurt me, that wouldn’t have hurt me at all, a few weeks ago… And I think I actually like that,” he confessed, to himself as much as to Tony. “I don’t know, I think I figured out recently that ‘not having weaknesses’ really just means not caring about anything. Telling yourself you’ll survive any loss and get through every struggle, all on your own if you have to… it just means you don’t really have anything that matters that much. That… Actually, you have to like yourself, and think you matter as a person, to think your fears and priorities have a value, that they can be taken into account. And when you say they
He sighed and fell into the chair behind him, simply letting the page he was holding slip out of his grip and onto the floor.
And he was beyond processing it, obviously… but, maybe, as it turned out, there was just a little part of him that begrudged the fact that Tony had seen all of this for himself, so easily and so readily. That Tony had apologised before Steve could say any of this. Even if more of him was relieved and grateful for the understanding they had come to – maybe a very basic, primal little part of him had felt cheated of something…
So, we ARE back on schedule from here - and if the next update is late then I have no excuses (and that's back to Monday the 11th, so at least you don't have long to wait for it!)
“It looks more… like one group of Varians are letting these humans use their drugs against another group of Varians…” Tony narrated thoughtfully, eyes still locked on the screen. “…or, working
and which people didn’t… And, once we have access to their system, we’ll be able to find out where Bucky is. So,” and he let go of a heavy breath, his shoulders slumping resignedly as he concluded, “I know that still leaves a lot of specifics to iron out, and a lot of things to plan, but that’s basically the gist of it. Find a Hydra base, upload a specific type of virus, root out all the Hydra files - find out where Bucky is - and then basically delete their whole operation.”
Bucky physically shook Sam away from him, turning to Steve with a sharp intake of breath, like he was preparing himself to say something significant-
And he turned in time to see the same thought occur to Tony – a shared raising of eyebrows, the same sly little smile…
he’s coming,” Tony exhaled sadly. “I’ve been through all these readings twice, and with what you’ve said about the first time it happened… I’m pretty sure it was the
. Steve felt it pulling all the way along his arm, throbbing in his muscles – different to the little spark he always felt when Tony touched him. Deeper. More powerful.
He didn’t mean to. He didn’t even know he was doing it. It just felt so natural, all of a sudden - instinctive. He
“Yeah - there was a big… like a country estate, really near to where we landed, called Rossinhol - I remember thinking it was weird, because it sounded French rather than German…” And then Steve saw that Tony was still thinking about it, and raised an eyebrow in question.
And Steve heard his breathing crack painfully before he recognised that he was tearful – and then a sudden stab of panic as he realised that he wasn’t going to contain that sob-
So, because it was the only option left, Tony resigned himself to letting things float through his head…
The Red Skull smiled again - even more unsettling, now that there was just a hint of humanity in it. Steve thought of those magic eye puzzles that they used to print in the Sunday papers… He had the same feeling that he’d be able to find Johann Scmitt’s face staring back at him, if he squinted from just the right angle…
Steve pulled him closer then, breathing him in. Kissing Tony’s forehead so very tenderly that Tony had to pause for a second, just to let that shiver run through him…
He’d liked the idea of this one shining moment, this symbolic line between before and after, the thought that everything could be better now…
Whether he made every detail available to everyone, from the politicians to the warlords to the average person on every street…
Which meant he was free to remember the day he’d spent wrapped up in Steve’s arms, without having to temper his hopes or build up his defences.
“So…Do you still hate Bucky?” Steve asked – like it’d taken all of his courage to get the words out.
This particular revelation had come to him at some point in the previous evening, once the wall of panicked thoughts and constant effort of denial had finally worn him down. Exhausted, and miserable, and still suffering from the most intense post-orgasm shame in history, he’d finally accepted that he had to
Steve groaned softly and rubbed his eyes before he took a proper look around. There was a vague sense of relief when he spotted Bucky, curled up in an oversized armchair in the corner of the room, and Sam, passed out on the other couch.
Steve felt the significance ripple through the room. He guessed it was because the hotel was so overpriced… but he didn’t actually know. The relative value of the dollar was one of those things he still had to manually translate in his head, and even that didn’t help him navigate the different things that people valued, these days. Things that would’ve been considered the height of luxury in the forties were now considered disposable, things that he took for granted as a kid were now rare and sought after and expensive. Knowing what something would’ve cost in forties currency didn’t always help him understand what it was
, here. So. It might happen again.” And then Tony swallowed, and closed his eyes, and added “It might not…stop…there, next time.”
He kept thinking back to various points in that awful, awkward appointment. The meaningless comments he’d made, because he couldn’t mention what he was so anxious about… growing ever more anxious, the longer it went unsaid.
That was a romantic conundrum as old as the ages… and it was only too easy to think where it was going to end up.
Steve kiss him. Bucky had kissed him back every bit as hungrily, grabbing him almost violently and pulling him into the room.
And then Tony moved his hands so that he could lean over Steve, shifting just enough that he could thrust into him more sharply and still hit that same place.
Tony huffed a frustrated breath and set the data case down on the coffee table. He did his best to ignore the prickle of apprehension that rushed over his skin, as he reached into his pocket and curled his fingers around the weight at the bottom of it.
“They didn’t really tell me anything when I first took the serum, and I probably didn’t ask enough questions, and to be honest, I don’t think they really knew themselves… and I’m… I’m just sorry that I didn’t tell you this sooner,” he assured, a pleading edge on his voice, “I just… Didn’t really know what to tell you. And I thought maybe if I looked into it first, it would be easier. I finally asked to see all the files, because I wanted to read them before I told you any of this… Not that there was really much in there, but I just thought…” Steve stopped himself with an impatient sigh. And then he gathered himself, bravely, squaring his shoulders before he went for the big finish, “but the truth is that I still don’t really know what I am, and I don’t know how it could affect you, or…
All the air left Tony’s lungs in a rush. A treacherous heat flooded his face, and for a second he had to divert all of his focus into not bursting into tears-
And the room fell quiet for a few moments, as Tony flicked through thousands of screen shots and scanned over hundreds of files… and Steve just fell into a quiet lull, watching him…
There was a raw, dragging burn across the back of Steve’s neck, as Tony pulled the fabric of his T-Shirt over his skin. The low, purring sound of the material being stretched to its limits, tearing. Steve knew Tony would literally rip it off of him before too long, and part of him wanted to wait for that – but he was completely beyond patience for anything. He managed to wriggle his arms free of the sleeves, inefficient and graceless, before he felt Tony yank the shirt over his head in a single fierce motion.
him yet… but he was much more aware of it than he had been, and pleased he didn’t have to spend any time fumbling with the handle.
Tony felt an ache in his entire body, and had no idea what to call it. He’d been replaying that moment, over and over, all night. Always with a flinching pain in this stomach, and a general feeling of shame… But this time it felt different.
“No, it didn’t, actually,” he corrected, without malice. “No, that whole time he just stood there being… calm, and polite, and reasonable… and it’s stupid to be mad at him for that… And, you know what, I’m not,” he finished with a shrug.
Of all the many moments Steve had dreamed of doing over, his first meeting with Tony was the one he went back to most often. It might not have been the thing he most regretted - that would always be the secret he kept about the death of Tony’s parents, and the stupid decisions he made because of it. But, when it got to four in the morning and Steve still couldn’t sleep, it would always be those first few hours with Tony that he went over again...and again... Clenching his jaw as he remembered every exchange… Sighing wistfully as he thought of all the things he wished he’d said instead....
been taking his aggression out on the punching bags that SHIELD now supplied by the truckload, but eventually he’d grown numb to the sensation. Not that it really mattered
Tony dropped his head into his hands – fuck it, why not? Why bother pretending this was anything less than agonisingly,
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, averting his eyes. He heard Steve take a small, trembling breath, and his stomach clenched. A little voice whispered,
Steve might’ve stopped then to ask himself why Scmitt was asking, what point he was trying to make… except that he might already have made it. Or, maybe, Steve had discovered this blinding sense of clarity all on his own… Whichever it was, Steve was far too concerned with this revelation to worry where it had come from. “And that seemed like a
Super villains the world over had worked out that no one could outsmart the Avengers, or out run them, or out Hulk them – but it was surprisingly easy to make them fight each other. Loki had tried to turn them on each other, and damn near managed it. Wanda had used their personal demons and interpersonal problems as a distraction, and that was how ULTRON had gotten as far as Sokovia. Zemo hadn’t even
good a man as this Nazi icon, if you tried a little harder. You just have to think of something positive to leave behind, after your Hydra overlords have used your work to kill millions of people-”
Casually, Tony swept his gaze over Wesley’s living room, not bothering to hide that he was doing it. The inside of the house was every bit as tired and neglected as the exterior, with threadbare carpeting and ugly duct-taped repairs to most of the furniture. The couch had a visible sag in the middle where the foundations had collapsed. The yellowed paint on the walls was flaking in the corners, stained with layers of watermarks… and without any sort of decoration. In fact, there were no photographs, no paintings or mirrors, no keep-sakes or trophies, anywhere in the house…
“Ahreddan was a code word for Operation Rebirth?” Tony clarified, a different kind of curiosity flickering behind his eyes. “...But that’s got to be a coincidence, right?” He murmured, almost to himself. And then he looked back at Steve, and asked more directly, “
as he arched his back, rocking his shoulder up to Steve’s mouth, rutting at what little friction Steve’s grip afforded him-
The same irrational, emotional terror that had overwhelmed him when his parents died. When he’d tried to picture running that
“And, please tell me if I’m wrong, but it seems that you are both – like so many people who come here – a bit cautious, about letting some of your social assumptions go? Would it be fair to say, instinctively, you still feel that was is going on here is
“Human beings enslaved millions of their own people for sugar and tobacco” Tony reminded him “Hangover free alcohol would probably be as valuable, in today’s economy.”
Steve wasn’t sure how much of his story Tony had believed - but he knew for sure that Tony had been intrigued by it. Steve had seen his determination to define the problem, his impatience to understand it, his frustration of not being able to find the questions quick enough to keep up with his theories-
So, Steve let himself sit back into the couch, and rubbed his eyes, and let them stay closed for half a minute. When he started scanning the room again it was more casually…leaving some of his attention free to consider other things, while he looked for Maribelle…
“She keeps talking to that blonde guy.” Tony whispered “Maybe we should speak to him. We’ll have more luck with him than with his boss”
This whole exercise would’ve felt far less arduous if he hadn’t had to deal with actual, physical papers.
It took a lot of effort not to literally cringe, Steve was so uncomfortable saying that out loud. Immediately, he braced for a barrage of difficult questions or uncomfortable accusations… or, worst of all, for Tony to look at him like he was a would-be supervillain, or something.
Then Steve looked up again, and for a second it was just bright lights and shadows and the sound of his own heart pounding in his ears. And then slowly, his vision cleared.
Steve’s entire body was pulled taut with need by now, every inch of him pulsing with that urgent pleasure, pushing up against the very limits of him-
The Facility was eerily quiet now. Empty, and still – and properly lit, which was strangely grating. There was a disorientating feeling of being somewhere they shouldn’t be, like being at a nightclub after daybreak or sneaking into his high school over the summer.
After a while, Steve had started to recognise just how many little interactions they’d shared each day - that even the ‘insignificant’ ones started to feel significant when they were missing. This past week had made Steve realise that Tony made him smile far more often than he made him grit his teeth… far more than anything else did. God help him, Steve even missed the relentless over analysis of every little gesture…
And Steve let his eyes run over Tony’s body… the marks he’d left on Tony’s neck, the fingertip bruises on Tony’s chest – which Steve could only see because he’d torn so many of the buttons from the front of Tony’s shirt…
Tony had to pinch back a little smile. There was something surreal about that, something fundamentally
Steve was so distracted by how good Tony looked in it that he didn’t even notice the large gym bag he had slung over his shoulder, until Tony had shrugged his way free of it and tossed it carelessly onto the couch. Steve raised his eyebrows, questioning, but Tony only smiled in response and then sat down next to it.
. Tony couldn’t even bring himself to wonder what Rhodey’s reaction would be. He couldn’t bear to picture Rhodey’s face, or guess what thoughts might run though his head… Tony couldn’t stand the idea of crushing Rhodey’s faith in him like that.
going to swallow him up, then he was going to have to look at Steve at some point... Try as he might, he couldn’t think of any reason to stay staring at this wall for the next eight days.
And Tony genuinely didn’t know which part of that he felt bad for. Only that he found himself in the middle of an uncomfortable personal crisis, on top of everything else…
“Oh, I don’t deny, I’ve taken a particular interest in you both, since you arrived.” Adam answered, taking a lazy step into the room. “For all sorts of reasons. There is a great potential in you two – really, that’s why I allowed you to come in the first place. I knew your referral was false, obviously … and, of course, it occurred to me that you might therefore have nefarious reasons for being here. Or, maybe you were just curious. Maybe you wanted to see this place, and couldn’t get a referral… you see, I didn’t
sure isn’t… Because when I say, ‘I’m sure’, what I mean is, ‘I know I want to’. I really want to. And… I can’t hurt you, or not bother to think about whether I’m hurting you, just because I really want to…”
He didn’t like the thought of sending Tony into such an unknown and potentially dangerous situation.
The numerous people he’d met in person, and managed to subtly intimidate, or quietly impress, or harmlessly intrigue - whatever would be most useful to them, when it came to exerting influence later.
An elated, disorientating lightness rolled through Steve’s head, as he recognised the deeper truths in what Tony was saying to him-
half a mile in diameter. At the front, directly ahead of where they’d come in, was a curved silver stage, framed on each side by ornate columns the size of skyscrapers. The stadium-style seating around the edge of the room towered so high that Tony had to strain his neck to see the top of it - and when he looked up, he saw that the ceiling was dotted with millions of brightly sparkling lights, in thousands of different colours, every bit as vast and humbling as the night sky…
“No,” Tony answered, easily. “But, I suppose I might’ve done, if things had worked out differently - and, like I say, it’s not like I gave a lot of thought to how things were going to work out from there, so I suppose it was mostly luck… But then, on the other hand… I never really think about what life would be like if I had to have a
He wondered if he’d be able to explain to Tony how much he appreciated the thought he’d put into it - how perfect every detail of this house was… how clear it was that Tony had listened to him, now that he thought about it.
The point was, Steve was barely talking to Tony as it was, so he could hardly strike up a conversation about sex, of all things. And he couldn’t exactly start a serious conversation about anything else, while they were both trying to pretend that they weren’t at an orgy.
write one myself, I actually find myself thinking that it doesn’t sound right – like, trying to write in the Tony Stark voice that people know…” He knew he
And then, right when he was about to drift away from the page entirely, Steve’s eyes snagged on the title of the next page-
So, overwhelmed by bloodlust though he undeniably was, Tony sucked Steve’s fingers very gently, letting one hand come to rest softly against Steve’s ribs. He could feel Steve’s determination to stay still, the way his torso trembled under Tony’s palm, the way his muscles tensed into him. And then Tony ran the tip of his tongue directly over the cut, letting the last of that taste spread slowly through his mouth, waiting until the latest wave of euphoria had rolled through his head before he finally relaxed his lips and moved Steve’s hand away.
with Steve, including all the parts that required planning and commitment and communication - and everything that traditionally scared him
“The central system used to be controlled from the top floor, and there’s no reason they’d have changed that,” Tony carried on talking to Natasha. “But they’re almost certainly holding Steve and Bucky in the basement, so, I’m going down to get them before I go up to let you in,” and Tony’s tone made clear that he wouldn’t be taking criticism on his plan.
“So, we turn them over to the authorities here, if there are any…” Tony spoke like he was thinking aloud…
He should’ve said something, he should’ve told his ‘boyfriend’ that he had a strange feeling about it and asked to speak to him in private – asked if Tony was sure he was ready to go back into
“Okay, well, I think that’s as much as I can do on guess work” Tony exhaled, eventually, throwing his pen down with a flourish. “And it’s probably about that time….”
Steve felt his mind snap back into focus. An immediate shift from all those huge, life-long ideas, back to this one moment. He stopped trying to comprehend how wonderful and unlikely it was that Tony wanted to kiss him, and got to thinking that-
thinking about whether he wanted to. Weighing up the idea of another setting, against the effort of actually moving – that was all.
Wanda literally tried to kill him, and then two minutes later he’s redesigning a whole floor of the compound just so that her room will be close to everyone else's. You turn up, new to the 21st century, and it’s all calm reassurances and ‘
Steve didn’t even hear her speak, he was so shocked and appalled - his ears were literally ringing. A cushion of dazed numbness swelled up in his head, like an airbag. And then he remembered a throw away comment that Tony had once made about nightmares…
Something shiny, sitting on the counter to the right of him, briefly caught by the change in the light when Tony moved.
He turned in time to see Tony emerge from the bedroom, barefooted, last night's clothes now endearingly creased…
“Jesus Tony, you have no idea how hot you are right now,” Steve breathed, running his eyes over Tony’s body, his chest still rising and falling, hard and fast. And Tony felt a sudden thrill of excitement, a rush of gratification, even smugness-
from behind the chair, and Zan turned to see Tony typing the co-ordinates into the portal-device again.
That was all he was thinking about, all he was feeling, everything that he wanted, or needed, or that mattered in the world… Everything.
You may be pleased to hear that, as of the next update, we are at last getting into the Bucky section of the fic 😀
He’d never considered that someone might want to take on all the chaos of his life, and not see it as a burden. He’d certainly never considered that they’d be delighted to do it. He’d never once thought that someone might try to save him from everything
And Pepper had never tried to control him, or speak for him, through all those wild and reckless years that she’d been his close friend. She
meet Tony Stark?” Sam burst in excitedly, ignoring the look Nat shot him for ruining her run up. Steve felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Immediately, knew that he didn’t want to talk about it. That he wished they hadn’t asked.
He must’ve gleefully relived every moment of yesterday at least a hundred times - the moment that Tony said ‘I love you’ more than any of them.
conversations like this weren’t his strong suit any more than they were Bucky’s. And Bucky had to admit, he liked being around someone who was better at this than he was.
things we would’ve liked to say about that. Things he would’ve liked to scream at the top of his lungs.
had you forgotten that story?” Tony asked with mock incredulity. “I laughed for about an hour when Steve first told me that story. I’m literally never going to let him forget it.”
, and who had a mindset and a moral code and an ever developing set of personal principles. He remembered questioning the labels and rules his
“He didn’t say anything - he barely said anything throughout the whole mission,” Nat informed him, with an unimpressed look on her face.
And Tony soon worked out that, wherever this diary had been since 1992, it could stay there one more night-
And then he felt his body reaching out automatically, a physical reaction to that increasing, wordless longing… one arm stretching across the sheets… searching…
The awkwardness curled in Bucky’s stomach, the blush glowing hotter as he recognised what Tony meant…
to happen. He hadn’t bothered to glance up at the palace in hours, he hadn’t been listening out for anything-
The panic gripped him tighter, as he recognised that he should’ve panicked sooner. He went back over his train of thought, growing increasingly anxious as he realised how slowly everything was filtering through, how strangely he was looking at everything…
“I’ve missed you,” Tony whispered, as he looked up at Steve. Steve’s heart clenched in the most wonderful way, and he barely managed a mumbled
… And there was a shimmering haze suspended in the air above it, that Steve immediately recognised as a cloud of pollen.
“I was thinking… So, you said you read everything SHIELD had about Operation Rebirth?” He asked, in an interested tone.
And Tony knew he should be trying to get out of this conversation. He knew this was the place to nod, and thank Bucky for the advice, and politely show him to the door…
Tony was, observing all the wonderful little details of him as he worked. Letting his eyes run over Tony’s soft, dark hair and his delicate, skilled fingers and the curve of his lips as he pursed them in thought or smiled in satisfaction. And Steve revelled in the fact that there wasn’t the wistful longing, or the unspecific guilt, or the fear of what this was going to turn into… and he let that relief gradually melt into a happiness, and then heat to an excitement, as he thought how much he wanted to touch Tony’s hair and feel his fingers on his skin and kiss those perfect lips a thousand different ways…and that he was allowed to think it…and then, that he was allowed to do it. That he
And Steve just watched it all happening, like he might’ve watched strangers chatting at the bus stop, to pass the time…
“So, you could get killed by the horror movie villain that stalks these woods for new victims every time someone makes shop here?” Steve deadpans.
Natasha’s mother is more stoic, but her arms are wrapped around her body like she fears that if she lets her arms slip, the contents of her body would fall out onto the ground.
“-that you have never touched anyone but me, that you haven’t seen anyone in a romantic or a sexual way since we got together but
Tony’s eyes are on his monitors, cleverly sneaking peeks at Steve in the machine. The EKG beeps in the background.
There’s a knock on the door, and Tony almost feels like he’s a teenager, getting ready for his first date. He checks his outfit one last time in the mirror in the entrance hallway, and then, he swings open the door.
“Nah, I don’t know how long it might take. You guys should probably just head on home,” Tony tells him.
Steve groans, and it’s as though there’s a floodgate breaking, because Steve melts into the kiss, and then, in a move that surprises Tony, crowds him back against the front of the house.
Tony flees into one of the side rooms in his chambers, when both Bucky and Natasha arrive, seeing the carnage on his bed, and the dead body lying beside him, their lord’s exact image pale and numb and blood drenched and drying over his front.
“I don’t think I’d have been allowed to come in this place before I got the serum,” Steve comments, staring at the décor of the opulent restaurant that they’re currently seated at a table within.
Tony sits up, shifting his legs underneath himself, ignoring the strain in his thighs. He curls his hand around the nape of his neck, pulling Steve forward so that he can kiss him slow, deep, messy, their tongues tangling.
Steve and James climb out of the car, and their faces are different; Steve isn’t Steve, his puppy dog husband that forgets to switch on the laundry machine, and James isn’t James, his ex-lover who can’t make two-minute noodles.
Tony folds his arms over his chest, almost self-consciously. “I don’t look like I used to,” he says, defensively. “I was… back then, when we first met, I was hot. I was nineteen, and I had muscles, and I was tight, all over, and things have changed since then, okay? We’ve had two kids, and sure, I didn’t grow them in my body, but my figure has changed
“Why are you doing this with Dr. Erskine and the army? I mean,” Steve rubs the back of his neck, “a beautiful O–” Steve turns red, “sorry, uh, beautiful omega, no, beautiful engineer. No, not beautiful. I mean, you
“It just occurred to me that I’ve slept with you and I’ve slept with you,” Tony says, pointing at both Steve and James in turn, “but you two haven’t slept with each other, have you?”
Tony smiles, a slow lick, hearty and indulgent. “Are you having blowjob fantasies again?” he teases.
The armour creaks, and Steve determinedly doesn’t think about how it feels like he’s holding Tony’s coffin.
“My brother.” Grant’s face shifts into an expression of sheer loathing. “You mean my brother, who can’t bring himself to fuck you, his omega?”
“I know,” he says, gently. He swallows hard. “The reason why you weren’t around to help with the kids, that was because of SHIELD.”
Tony doesn’t offer any platitudes; if Natasha is anything like him, and he thinks she is, they won’t be well-received, and besides, he doesn’t think there’s anything he
Tony clears his throat. “I don’t mind him, from first glance,” he says, carefully. “I haven’t actually interacted with him much, but he doesn’t seem like a bad guy. I suppose I’m just curious as to why he is your choice.”
.” Toni gnaws on her lower lip. “How about we, uh… actually, Steve and Bucky are on their way over here. I wanted to talk to you first, but how about when they come, you run up to them and you give them a big hug, and you call them Daddy?” she offers. “But only if you feel comfortable doing that.”
“I’d prefer it if you took your clothes off in the vicinity of my bedroom,” Tony says, briskly, and makes his way towards the door.
“I think you think I’m worthless and stupid and undeserving of everything you so generously give to me. I think you don’t love me, and you sure as hell don’t like me very much,” Tony says, carefully, with daggers in every word, feeling giddy and sick all at once. “Maybe you killed him because you love me, maybe you killed him because you feel like shit about what he did to me, but you don’t get to stand here after a decade of resentment and hate and disinterest and blatant fucking dislike, where you ruthlessly and without quarter point out each and every single one of my fucking shortcomings like you’re on a game show and you explain to me how much I disappoint you and how I’ll never amount to anything because you know,
Steve orders a pepperoni for himself, because he very rarely gets the chance to have meat-filled pizza, and Tony orders two cheese pizzas for him and the twins, which is more than enough for them and will even have some leftover in a takeaway box to put in the fridge for when the twins get hungry outside the usual meal times.
Bucky shrugs. “Toni, doll, if you were telling me that you were ditching our wedding to go and help some eighteen-year-old guy, I wouldn’t be so fucking stoked either.”
.” He bites his lip, giving his husband a heavy, lidded stare. “You want to know what I dream about?”
Steve stares at him for a moment, a bleak, hard look in his eyes, and then, he kisses him, full on the mouth, tender, his hand clutching at Tony’s shoulder. He pulls away and presses his cheek to the flat of the arc reactor, without hesitation, with immaculate confidence. Tony settles back against the sofa, wrapping his arms around Steve, his chin propped on the crown of his head – he tightens his arms when his shirt grows damp with tears.
He was a mouthy kid, too. He picked a fight with everyone, especially when he saw a situation he didn’t agree with, a boy who didn’t know how to take ‘no’ from a lady, assholes who yelled slurs, meatheads who were rude, stupid, who made fun of people for cruel, hurtful reasons; he picked a fight with all of them and got his ass handed to him, every time.
Steve rears over him, fucking him with unbridled enthusiasm, and Tony just lies there and takes it, each thrust ripping another surge of pleasure from his body. He’s filling Tony deeper and rougher, and Tony’s heart is in his throat, and he can’t say anything. There are a million words that he wants to say, but they’re all lodged in his throat along with his heart, and he doesn’t think that Steve would want to hear them anyway.
Tony is staring at him, wondering if he had walked through some gaping hole in the world without ever realising it – he waits, waits, hoping that Lord Steven changes his mind, decides to tup him the way that alphas are supposed to on their bonding nights.
my friend, and I don’t… I don’t want to have to say that I’m not going to be friends with her because it bothers you, but I guess if it does bother you, I’d be prepared-”
“What? How to kiss? How to have sex with my partner?” Steve demands. “Guess what, Tony? I didn’t really have a lot of fucking experience with either of those things the last time I was like this, but in any case, it’s not something that I would easily forget or ignore. You made assumptions, just like you said I did this morning. You made assumptions and they were the wrong ones.”
is the conversation that we’re having right now,” Tony insists. “Don’t you want to talk about this? About what Loki said?”
Tony doesn’t have anything to say after that, because, while it is not the thing he should say as a highborn omega, he doesn’t want to comfort Steve, to understand his loss, only because it’s Grant, because Grant was a monster, and he doesn’t want to think of anyone that might have actually loved him.
Steve curls a hand around the nape of his neck, drawing him in close to kiss him all over again, his tongue sliding into Tony’s mouth.
Tony whines when that same hand cracks down on his ass, a sharp sound of impact echoing through the room.
Six months ago, before any of this had happened, they’d gone to the Timely Town Fair as a date, and Tony had won it for Steve with one of those marksmanship games.
The man gives Tony a cold look before making his way to the fireplace. As soon as his back is turned, one of the Nazis grabs the nearest whiskey bottle, and Tony’s heart climbs into the throat, as the medallion is revealed. But the Nazi quickly puts the bottle down again, obscuring the medallion, when the man in charge speaks from the fireplace.
“Yeah,” Tony’s gut churns, “that’s what I thought. Now, I can help Wanda. Find the kids; that’s what you can do for me right now. I’m calling the ambulance, and then, I’m calling Sam, and we’ll be gone before either of them get here.”
“Steve, he’s in love with Bucky Barnes. He’s always been in love with Bucky Barnes. I could see it…” he clears his throat. “I could see it in his eyes. That means…”
At some point, while Ross is finding out about Chandler and Monica, Steve drapes his arm around Tony’s shoulders.
Steve opens up the vial, dripping a healthy amount onto his fingers, which he doesn’t hesitate to press between Tony’s legs, at his rim. Tony gasps, fisting his hands in the sheets below him, as he starts to open up to one finger, and then, two, and then, finally, three. On the thrust with three fingers, Steve catches his prostate, which makes Tony cry out and muffle the sound in Steve’s broad, muscled shoulder, setting his teeth against the skin there.
He says it with a passion and venom that borders on madness, and that’s how he feels, how he’s felt all these months, that he’s going fucking mad with all of it.
Tony moans when Steve finally pushes inside him, his hips snapping forth. At first, his rhythm stutters and falters, as if he weren’t used to it, and Tony remembers,
“Because you never forgave me for leaving you, and I never forgave myself for leaving you either,” James goes on to say. “For that alone, please, just let me explain myself, let me explain what happened that night.”
“Like I could not be,” Steve says, long-sufferingly, and then, he throws Tony over his shoulder, heading towards the bathroom.
Steve is sitting on the couch, in front of the coffee table. Atop the coffee table is a decanter of scotch and two glasses. One is full, the one that Steve is drinking from, and he lifts it then, seeing Tony in the doorway, his mouth closing around the rim, his throat flexing as he drinks.
?” James says, his voice sharp, and when Tony looks over his shoulder, there’s a gun in James’ hand as well.
Wanda answers the door, and a flicker cracks in her expression, setting Tony’s teeth on edge (God knows what kind of stories Steve had told Wanda about him).
!” Steve barks at him. “Have I ever given you the idea that I’d… I’d just walk out on you guys like that?”
“What happens between your brother and I is between us alone. You have no right to comment on it,” Tony insists, the air tight in his chest.
The whip flies from Steve’s hand as he and the giant Nazi roll across the floor, upsetting furniture. The one closest to Tony, seeing this, stands up confidently, abandoning his weapon momentarily, and Tony uses this against him, rising up behind him and bashing him over the head with the ax handle.
And then, he thrusts once, stroking Tony’s side as he eases into him, and then, on the second thrust, Tony digs his teeth into Steve’s shoulder. He snaps his hips forward, and Steve groans as he comes, hands digging into Tony’s hips.
groomspeople, and only Natasha remains. So, he gets Natasha and Thor and Bruce (Clint is conveniently missing from all the festivities, but after what he’s lost, Tony doesn’t actually blame him – he

are dead, and I don’t, I don’t want to do this anymore, I don’t want to live, knowing that you’re out there and I’m here, and we don’t get along. So, please, I’m begging you… let me go get us something to eat, and we can just… talk. Let’s just talk.”
“Yeah, he went to Europe after we broke up for the last time, you know, back at MIT. The next thing that I know is I’m getting an email from his solicitors telling me that he overdosed in Basel, and he named his sole beneficiary.”
“If I wasn’t… if I wasn’t such a fucking mess, if I wasn’t so insecure, so fucked up, then, I wouldn’t have believed it, believed that you were capable of cheating on me. I wouldn’t have taken all those things, the necklace, the frantic phone calls, the way she touched you, the fake conferences, and the way she talked about you, to mean that you were sleeping with her,” Tony says, quietly, staring down at his lap.
. So, don’t you sit there and pretend like I didn’t do this for your own good, that I didn’t break both of our hearts to
Tony shakes his head, wordlessly, unable to help the arousal deepening, spreading down to his fingers and toes.
Steve growls. “Would you just shut up and listen for a second? I want that piece your father had, and I’ll pay you for it.”
“We have,” James agrees. “But that doesn’t mean you had to come down here when I called or patch me up when I came over bleeding.”
Tony falls off the chair, climbs into his lap, and slides his tongue into Steve’s mouth, tangling it with his.
, Tony mutters, and stalks around the bar, picking up the iron poker on the way, fisting the comforting, cool metal rod in his hand. He slides himself between the two, shoving them apart, his elbows pushing into their chest.
“I loved him a lot, and he left, and he made me feel like I was… not good enough, and it hurt me. I guess, when he came back, and he explained himself, I just wanted to keep him to myself for a while.” Tony runs his hand through his hair. “Besides, I didn’t think that he’d stay long. I thought I could help him out with all the, uh, all the HYDRA stuff, and he’d be done, and he’d leave like he did before.”
Tony cringes, but follows, mostly because he has no other choice – Obadiah, as his father’s second-in-command, had made his feelings clear; he had no intention of caring for his dead liege lord’s omega son, not when he could get to business and begin making alliances with Tony as the thing to be sold to some stranger like a horse.
Tony takes a deep, steadying breath, his heart thundering in the ribcage. His head feels muffled, full of cotton, especially as the plane begins to turn. He bows his head against the window, thinking it over, doing the calculations in his head.
Tony wraps his hand around Steve’s cock, biting at his lap, staring at Steve’s face to garner an understanding about how he’s feeling. Steve groans, seizing off the bed. There’s sweat dampening his brow, and his mouth parts, especially as Tony’s rhythm surges.
Steve was voracious and hungry and inescapable, and he used to sneak up on Tony like some jungle cat waiting for its prey, wraps his arms around Tony with fierce enthusiasm and takes his mouth with terrible want, and then, it would inevitably devolve into him bearing Tony down often to the bed and fucking him until he can’t get air into his lungs and his eyes roll back in his head.
Tony parks outside the hospital, waiting for Steve to disappear through the double doors, a baseball hat hiding his face from view. He waits a minute, and then, two, and then, drives off in the direction of his house.
Steve shakes his head, a furrow appearing above his brow. “Oh, I don’t even remember anymore. But it’s normal, right? Everyone has nightmares once in a while.”
you, and he looks at you like you put the sun and the stars and the moon into the sky each night. He
Steve grins at him, a bold show of his straight, white teeth. “So, I’m getting warmer?” He looks at James. “He thinks that we look like gods, and while I appreciate the comparison, and he doesn’t match up to us.”
. All the barriers that would normally have stopped him, or guided him to a certain type of action, or at the very least slowed him down… Just weren’t there anymore. It wasn’t that he was pushing through them, or overlooking them-
Tony pushed into him again, dropping his head so that Steve could feel the heat of his breath ghost over his neck as he pulled back.
“Do you know who this is?” He asked, tossing one of the pages he was holding onto the coffee table that stood between them. He waited politely for Nick to reach down and grab it.
going to have to figure out what to do about them, seeing as Zorro isn’t going to shoot them all for us, this time.”
“So, you just…” He gestured to her for permission, waiting until she nodded encouragingly before he pulled the flower head off and put it into his mouth…
“Jesus Tony…You are…just…” He struggled weakly, still trying to take it in. The sight of Tony lying there, open and exposed for him, the flawless expanse of his chest, his cock hard and leaking against his skin. Steve’s mouth literally watered. He couldn’t think of words enough- “Please, Tony, can I-”
Which Steve liked, actually. It was something Steve had been searching for his entire life… But, obviously, it made it difficult to explain certain parts of it. The overwhelming pride Steve felt, remembering Tony’s skin shimmering in the sunlight. The look on Tony’s face… The bodily commitment Steve felt to Tony now, the sense of purpose, the fantasies about Tony sinking his teeth into Steve’s neck…
A solid wall of adrenaline crashed through all of his rationalising and emotional preparation. That carefully constructed distance was washed away in the flood, leaving only the roar in his ears and that wordless instinct-
Beneath the electric thrill running through his veins and the inexpressible urgency pulsing in his muscles, there was only one word in Tony’s head.
. And then he took a slow breath as subtly as he could, trying to pull himself together before he looked up to acknowledge the concierge-
God, he’d spent years trying not to smile when Tony said something funny… for… some stupid-ass reason…
Tony unfastened Steve’s jeans, pressing kisses to each inch of newly exposed skin as he tugged them down over his hips, Steve arcing his back to let him, kicking his own legs free of them just as soon as he could. And Tony could

to me that maybe someone had built a whole soundstage just to fuck with me. It never occurred to me that Nick had bugged my apartment. It never occurred to me that Nat was on her own compartmentalised missions the whole time I thought we were working together. It never occurred to me that Tony and Bruce were building a super intelligent AI in secret. It never occurred to me that Clint had a secret family. It never occurred to me that Rumlow and Pierce were Nazis, or that I was secretly working for the Nazis, or that my neighbour Kate was actually an agent named Sharon that Nick had paid to spy on me. And yet apparently it
, of course, he made an attempt to pull himself together, a serious tone in his head reminding him that he was still being pathetic and ridiculous, that there were still a thousand reasons his life was completely fucked – some of which had only just surfaced.
The sudden, cold shock of Tony’s fingertip teasing at his hole again, now wet with lube. And Steve had no idea where Tony had retrieved that from, or when, or-
...It wasn’t as though he even needed to read them, really. He already knew what they were going to say.
He tried to remember that conversation... to remember the person he was when he had that conversation. None of the things he’d said seemed to fit now. None of the things he could remember thinking felt familiar in his head.
As that heady afterglow began to wear off, and Steve’s senses started to come back to him, he became more aware of the giddy elation he’d simply been floating on for however long. What had been a passive thing started to feel more active, a physical thrill of freedom, an awareness of the moment as a wonderful, exciting thing.
…It was momentarily sobering. That brief time before the fantasy, when everything is at its most real.
Tony could endure the unthinkable grief of losing him, and give up on the only romantic relationship that he’d ever cared about - not to mention denying a powerful impulse that felt natural and right, and for all he knew actually was. All to keep the option of a conventional life, that he’d never even wanted. All to avoid a shady fear that he couldn’t even name.
“Pretty sure the text is Middle English. At a glance, it looks like a reference book of some description…”
. He waited until Steve had met his eye before he added, “you feel responsible because you are good, and kind, and selfless, not because you did anything wrong. This is
So, to others, it is cowardly of Tony to stay in this marriage, even though his husband is in love with someone else, wants someone else, finds comfort and companionship and pride and appreciation in someone else, but to him, even to settle for shit when he should have gold is a much better existence than one without Steve Rogers.
“Oh, I think they’ll be talking about something else for a while now,” Steve says, heavily. “Tony, I won’t come to your chambers.”
Steve’s face changes, looking as though he’s missing his skin. “Do you know how I met him, Sam, I mean?”
“You should, uh, you two should talk about everything else,” Tony says, quietly. “You guys have a lot to talk about.”
Tony turns his head, so that no one can see how it affects him, how much it hurts him, how his face cracks wide open, and he clenches his eyes shut in an attempt to free himself of the weight of the blow.
“I don’t care that he did that,” Tony says, bluntly. “I don’t care that he… you know, disobeyed the rule of law and took it into his own hands, and he should’ve reported it to the cops, for all evidence of the guy’s misdeeds to be wiped clean before it even made it to the courts. So, I didn’t tell anyone. And we kept meeting, mostly because I kept searching him out. Sometimes, I think about why I was searching him out. I was unfulfilled, you know?” He gives Sam a half-smile. “I’ve been a genius in the world’s eyes since I was four. I did what I was supposed to do. I went to the school my father wanted to me to go to. I made guns and bombs when he wanted me to, because that’s what we did, that was
Abraham swallows, and with great hesitation that Tony feels in his bones, he nods at Tony, who gives the dial a final turn, pleading with God to forgive him.
“I’m sorry,” she says, after a moment of thought. “I’m sorry, I should have realised that there was something wrong, that something was wrong. You suffered because of my negligence.”
“But Steve just looked down his nose at the guy, quite literally too, because he was at least a foot taller than him, and said, ‘It doesn’t look like he’s interested. Maybe you should leave.’”
Once they’re done, he picks the glasses off them and drops it in the sink, rinsing them quickly, so they don’t get grotty, while he’s giving them a bath. He leads them into their bathroom, hand in hand, wincing when he steps on a particularly sharp action figure on the ground – a Transformer in mid-transformation.
Tony shrugs, fluttering his eyes, even if the panic gets him in the gut. “Oh, come on, babe, you know you’re the only one for me.”
Tony just moans, arching his back, exposing the long, lean line of his throat, as he feels himself rock back against the bed with each thrust of Steve’s hips.
Tony shakes his head. “He was already gone when Steve… Steve and I met. It hurt him too much to talk about him, so I never pushed. He never… he never even wanted to put up photos.”
In Tony’s hand is a single tissue, pulled from the box, and between his fingers, he starts shredding it into long, thin strips.
Steve frowns. “I mean, I guess I’m both,” he says, carefully. “I guess… I am frustrated that I love you so much that I’d let you walk, even if it ripped my heart out of my chest at the same time. I’m annoyed that I am compromised, but I don’t… I don’t regret any of it. I don’t-”
It was wrong, what he did, to force Steve into something that he was uncomfortable with, the same way that he had been uncomfortable with what Grant had did to him – that is a truth.
Steve leans over his head and runs his tongue over James’ mouth, tasting the salt of his sweat. “Not a bad way to go, Tony sucking you off,” he comments.
“How do you want to do this? What positions do you want? Who’s on top and who’s on bottom? By the way, I call dibs on being the ultimate bottom, just because I’ve had both of your cocks, and they get me in all the right places, and while I don’t have an issue with topping either of you big, strong men, I think I’d like to get plowed into the mattress,” Tony says, honestly.
Steve’s face sets in resolve and he nods. “I will kiss you then, and before you ask, it is because I want to kiss you. I have… I have thought about kissing you a lot.”
The alphas all leap to attention as Colonel Phillips approaches, and Tony takes that as his sign, as does Abraham, who climbs out of the jeep with him, trailing after the Colonel.
Tony bats his hands away at first, bares his teeth as if to ward James off; he’s always been one to dislike the touch of someone during comfort, a lone wolf when he can’t help the emotion welling up inside him like the first rain in the desert, and James is no different, even if they have history.
“I was out. I had to go and visit some people,” Tony says, staying close enough to the truth so that the lies won’t taste as bitter.
Steve looks up at him, totally miserable. “Tony, honey, I’m so sorry. I really fucked this up, didn’t I?”
James closes his eyes. “Okay, I guess that’s one way to look at it,” he muses. “But it’s the right way.”
He fakes a lunge with the poker, and the soldiers, whom he thought would’ve created a fuss, back down. Slowly but surely, all of the patrons rise to their feet, grumbling, make their way out the door.
“We can’t get married, remember. They’d kill us for it, most likely,” Tony teases around the lump that forms in his throat.
“What were the drawings?” Steve asks, his voice hard, his entire posture held together tight like he’s afraid everything will spill out if he loosens his frame just the slightest bit.
, and he kept coming closer and closer to me, and I was like ten seconds from throwing my drink in his face and smashing the glass over his head, and he put his hand on my thigh, dragging it up so he could grope my dick in my jeans, and then, Steve was there.”
“I think you are a shit father,” Tony says, bluntly. “I think you don’t give a shit about me unless it suits you in some way.”
And he loves Steve, loves him more than he loves anything in this world, except for those two darling children of theirs, and he knows that, even with Steve’s ‘long hours’, Steve loves him and loves their children, because Steve, at the heart of hearts, even if he is having an affair with the redhead that he buys the same jewellery that he buys his husband for, doesn’t just stop loving someone.
“I…” Tony is completely lost for words, floundering. “I know how it looks, I know that if it were me on the other side, I wouldn’t believe that James and I were just friends, and I don’t think that, with our history, we could ever be
He looks around, sees the homeless people in the alleys, smoking something, snorting something, stabbing needles into their arms, and wonders if he’s going to be mugged for his sneakers.
“No, it does. Something I said, or something I did, is clearly upsetting you.” Steve sighs. “Tony, we’ve been living with misunderstandings for months. I don’t want to do this anymore; I don’t want to play games; I don’t want half-speak. I just want to tell the truth.”
“I saw you with your husband, sometimes. He kisses you before he heads off to work. He’s tall,” James muses. “Like a bodybuilder. To be honest, I didn’t think he’d be your type.”
“And that’s what you figured out from your great investigation?” Steve almost taunts. “That I was having an affair.”
“That night, I saw you with him, and I couldn’t help but make my way over there. I just wanted to meet you,” she says, almost shyly. “You were sitting there, and you were so surprised, and Steve looked so awkward. You were jealous almost immediately.”
Tony approaches cautiously and picks up the envelope. Inside are pictures, glossy with newness, as they spill into his hand.
“You two have to get to school,” Tony tells the twins, gently. “Why don’t you go and grab your bags? I’ll say bye to James, and I’ll meet you in the garage. How does that sound?”
“I just…” Bucky dragged his hand over his face. “Look, we love you. You love us. We want to spend the rest of our lives with you.”
Bucky and Sam used to joke that Steve would dead a thousand times over if they weren’t there to have his back – he knows that’s true; he’s grateful.
“Believe me,” Tony says, coldly, “they will be very interested, and when months pass, and I do not swell with a child, their eyes will turn on me, and they will deem
“I’m not discounting him,” Tony says, defensively, rubbing his sternum in a nervous gesture. “I’m just pointing out exactly what the others, like Phillips, are going to point out. He is not their chosen, their favourite. They won’t see what we see.”
“I did,” Steve replies, easily. “I finished early, so I thought I’d pick them up. But you weren’t at home. Where were you?”
Toni pauses. “I think… he’d want you to be happy and safe and loved,” she hedges, or rather, lies straight through her teeth. “I think… he wouldn’t mind because he wasn’t here to be a Daddy for you, and he’d rather have someone love you in that way than for you to go without it.”
. You don’t want me anymore. You being possessive now is just because you want to own me, you want to lay claim to your fucking property. You’re like the kids with one of their toys; you might not want me, but like hell you’re going to let someone else have me, right?”
“I’m fine,” he soothes. “I was just really tired, so I took a nap in the afternoon, but Daddy picked you up and took you to practice and everything. That was okay, wasn’t it?”
Be strong, they said, even when his bark was worse than his bite and he routinely got his ass beat in alleyways.
Tony sighs and crouches in front of him. “Sometimes, when you really don’t like someone and they won’t leave you alone because secretly, even if their words seem really nice, they are actually being mean to you, you have to lie to make them leave you alone.”
“He was never good at the lady-killing,” James offers. “Or gentleman-killing, I suppose. You should have seen him when he was smaller. He offended
“An old friend,” he says, vaguely. “He’d just come back to the States after a long time away. I haven’t seen him since college. He came around the house this morning, though. So, we went out for lunch, just to catch up.”
He makes his way to the kids’ bedroom, finding Peter still sleeping contented, tucked under the sheets. Maushmi, on the other hand, has thrown all the sheets off the bed and is lying splayed out across the mattress, one arm and leg hanging off the bed.
Steve picks up the kids on his way back from SHIELD, and Tony has just finished fixing the shower in the kids’ bathroom, and James is making stuffed vine leaves, or
Bhim laughs. “Well, when you come to us and you ask for help, how can we possibly say no? Especially after everything that you have taught Pavitr.”
It’s like he can’t find words to form on his tongue, and a great sob rises in him, rumbling through his chest and spilling out of him before he can help himself.
Steve sits up, climbs to his feet. “Not the way you think,” he urges, reaching out for him with both hands outstretched. “Not because of what you’re thinking, not because I was sleeping with her, but because I knew I was lying to you, and I’m actually not very good at lying, honey. I’m really shit at it, and I knew I was digging myself deeper into a hole that I knew I wouldn’t be able to climb out of when it was all done. It wasn’t because I was sleeping with her, and I was dreading you two meeting, but because I was lying to you constantly about my job, what I was doing when I left the house, and I couldn’t deal with that, how wrong it was.”
“We had a bad dream,” Peter mutters against his shoulder, his hair tickling Tony’s cheek, as he wraps those small arms around his neck.
“I am so fucking furious with you, I swear. If you weren’t so good in bed for someone who didn’t have sex with anyone until I came along, I’d dump you in a heartbeat,” Tony insists.
He’s running at a full gallop, running blind through the streets. He trips, which sends him flying into a sandbox, because he’s suddenly in a fucking playground. The cement sticks to his ankles, his legs, and he can’t barely pull his feet loose.
“Tony,” Ms Lewis says, gently. “Look, kids at this age, they’re sensitive and they do pick up on things. I’m not… casting judgment on what might be going on at home, but they do pick up on things, and they do internalise it. It tends to show up like this,” she says, gesturing to the drawings.
“Yeah, but I’ve spoken to Bucky, Tony. He’s not having any of these dreams, and you spoke to Rhodey, didn’t you? Did he mention anything?” Steve asks with an unsure tongue.
That is something Tony doesn’t know if he can take. He can be the poor, cuckolded husband, he can smile at Natasha Romanoff and pretend like he doesn’t want to bash her skull against the wall for fucking up his happy marriage, if it was even a happy marriage before she sunk her claws into his husband (maybe, all he’s been doing is piling more and more scar tissue over open, festering wounds, wounds that will inevitably be the death of them but wounds he’d always been willing to ignore), but he won’t stand there and let him treat the children like they aren’t enough for him either, just like is.
Initially, that had bothered him, especially when a game of Truth or Dare at Team Game Night had led to him and Steve making out in front of the team, plus Rhodey, Pepper and Coulson – he’d wondered if this was some latent daddy issue of his, wanting to be with Steve Rogers, whom his father loved so much more than he loved Tony, and he wondered if it were smart, stupid, messy, all of those things to get involved with the other man.
“Yeah, I think so. I mean, I already love you and Steve, and Amma said that if you’re gonna adopt me, that means you love me too.”
? I mean, we’re friends, right? We were friends, at least, and fuck, Tony, half the universe is dead; people that we
Tony rubs his back and looks at Steve meaningfully, before finding his things, his wallet, his phone, and makes his way out of the café. He manages to hail a taxi at the corner of the road, which trundles its way all the over to Prospect Park. He climbs out, paying the man a generous tip, and searches the park as much as he possibly can before giving up at no obvious, familiar sign of James.
“I found the pictures in your bedside drawer, and I started crying,” Steve confesses, his eyes shining and mad, and the sight makes Tony’s heart kick in his chest. “I started crying because that’s what I’ve done, what I’ve driven my kids to, what I made them feel, and there’s no blaming you or blaming Bucky, because that was all me. That was all…
…That this was just the start of all the things Steve needed, just one of so many things he’d be forced to hold back-

And then he glanced up, and their eyes met, both of them washed through with such open love and joy that the words fell away, redundant.
Steve growl, that same thrilling, feral sound that he’d forced himself to ignore so many times… It burned through him now, rolling up through his ribs and trembling through his muscles, soaking into him…
“It’s just… neither of us can know if I’m hurting you,” Tony sighed. “I can’t tell you what I’m doing to you – I don’t even know. I don’t know if this is going to… change you, or… You can’t know what you’re risking, and I can’t know what I’m asking you to risk…”
He glanced around at the others, his movements already surprisingly heavy, and found that they were all wearing the same expression of dazed revelation.

to think back to it. A voice that reminded him of how many times he’d pictured kissing Tony, how often he’d wondered what it would feel like to have him pressed up against his chest… a voice that kept telling him that he knew now, if he’d just let himself know it. He had that memory now, a living, breathing, full-colour fantasy of Tony Stark in his arms, kissing him desperately –
him… but he didn’t want to say it out loud. There was just a very basic resistance to it, a sense of foreboding…
“You didn’t,” Steve smiled, more genuinely. Pleased and proud and maybe even touched that Bucky had reacted in exactly the way he’d expected – whatever Steve’s anxieties had been, they’d never been about what Bucky might say.
a sort of involuntary intoxication, something he simply took for granted - whether a drug that allowed him to ignore those feelings would make him more like himself, or less…
“Yeah, I’m okay.” Tony nodded. “Embarrassed, and worried I’ve upset you, but other than that, I’m fine.”
“It feels like my fault,” he admitted sadly, subconsciously snuggling closer into Tony as he said it.
And it didn’t even seem weird to Tony that he should think that. It was just… entirely different to the dull, muddy burgundy he was so used to seeing. It was such a pure, vital colour. A thick swirl of deep, molten red, like the centre of a precious stone.
Because, if it weren’t for that artificial sense of security and that inappropriate serenity, he never would’ve accepted the
But that ache in his body only grew, the longer he tried to ignore this revelation. Until these thoughts overwhelmed his resistance to them, and all the questions were right there in his head,
plan - because it was, objectively, a ridiculous plan. An idea that Tony never would’ve committed to, if he’d been calm and sober…
“For the toast” She whispered, holding the tray up and glancing back towards the server – who was still standing on the bar, talking about Val and Louie’s amazing matrimonial achievement… or something…
“Hey. Come in, have a seat,” Tony told them, casually… At least, Steve thought it was ‘casually.’ Maybe it was friendly… or, maybe, it had sounded impatient and kinda blunt, actually…
. He saw Peppers specific take on ‘looking after him’, her individual perspective of right and wrong, sensible and irrational, good and bad.

Steve panicked that he would be able to feel this much, that he wouldn’t be able to speak over the top of it, that he’d never be able to put this into words-
2019 was a place Steve could visit any time he liked - a place where he had never asked himself these horrible questions or seen these impossible ideas.
He barely had time to recognise who it was before Steve was powering past him, striding urgently through to the living area and stopping in front of the couches. Then he turned to Bucky - with such an exaggerated look of exasperation that Bucky almost giggled again - and simply threw his arms out theatrically,
“I… think the guy I’m in love with might actually have a crush on me. And I’m not sure if that’s a bad thing or just a thing.”
was never in the habit of trying to unassemble and over-analyse and rationalise the thoughts that frightened him-
Tony moaned, and let his head fall back against the couch, opening his legs and arching his back and trying desperately to remember the word for please – and then he felt a little shift in the mattress beneath him, and heard a familiar little
“Tony,” he pleaded, rutting up against him, seeking out more of that contact - but Tony kept his legs locked firm on either side of him, refusing to give him anything more than that teasing, compulsive pressure.
. Knowing that Tony would be the moment that Steve thought back to, over and over. That this intimate, personal desire of Steve’s would belong to him. Tony
couldn’t remember how to play that role, how to make sense of it – how it could possibly fit with the world as he currently saw it.
He’d been very determined that, above all else, he was never going to keep secrets from Tony again. That he was never going to lie to him, even through omission. That had seemed like the first and most obvious lesson he should be taking into this new timeline-
“Okay. So. I was thinking.” And he gestured back to the papers, because he didn’t have a hologram to point at. “What was so weird about all the things Dev said yesterday?”
Faltering slightly, Steve wandered over to his bed and sank very slowly to sit down on the edge of it.
His mood swings started to ease and even out, eventually settling into a warm, comfortable contentment.

kind. A society that separated Obie’s actions from the rest of the vampire myth, who considered it a
Steve could hear Tony’s voice echoing from miles away, like he was yelling from the bottom of a very deep well. The words meant nothing. The tone was lost in translation. It didn’t occur to Steve to respond to it, or think about it, or ask Tony to repeat it – it was just background noise to him now. It had faded into the same radio static as the rest of the world, diminished down to nothing by the strength of his rage.
… And that was the problem. It wasn’t anything to do with where they were or what was going on here – it was the same problem he’d had for the last six months-
Tony was pretty confident he was smiling in the right places. Putting the right items of banal small talk in the right gaps – the women he was talking to seemed to be pulling the right faces. He thought.
, I think it’s probably true that Fritz Harber thought he was one of the good guys, that the ends justified the means… And maybe it wouldn’t do Fury any harm to think of those facts, once in a while. Maybe he wouldn’t be so quick to rush into these plans that hurt other people, if he thought about that a bit more often. And, you know, I
The more that Bucky had come into the world, the more horrors he’d found in his head. Some minutes were worse than others. Sometimes there were spikes of white hot rage that seemed to come from nowhere, that cut open deep stores of resentment and injustice that it would then take him hours to silence. Sometimes that queasy anxiety would flash up into an all-out panic that he felt sure at the time would kill him. There were times when he couldn’t stop those memories from replaying over and over in his head.
“Tony wasn’t your wife, Steve,” Clint reminded him viciously. “He wasn’t even your friend - you hadn’t spoken to him for five fucking years before he died. So don’t talk to me like our pain was the same. It’s not even the same now. Nat
century, there were all these things that just… wouldn’t fit in my head?” Steve started, casually. “And, usually, it was because no one had bothered to mention that the scale had changed, or the context… Like, when Coulson was first telling me about you, and he just mentioned that you were worth something like twelve
Tony’s brow creased, first confused, then warmly amused, before he looked back at Steve’s face again. And, out of nowhere, Steve remembered the little piece of paper that was sitting in his top pocket – or, rather, he remembered the awkward and prolonged debate he’d had with himself about whether to bother bringing it.
sure of a completely contradictory view. And he was still sure he valued the people who didn’t try to do that,
“Oh, yeah, the trip,” he remembered at last. “Oh, fine - boring, but, yeah. No catastrophes…” He trailed off into a shy murmur as Rhodey narrowed his eyes at him.
A feeling that kept seeping deeper into him, as he remembered just how many silly, over-the-top reactions he had to be embarrassed about…
Tony had spent a large part of each day imagining all the ways that Steve could be discovered or ambushed or killed, making increasingly ridiculous offers to God if They could just please not stamp all over his happiness on this one occasion-
At any other time, there might have been some deep analysis of that. ‘Later’, Tony would probably recognise that there were so many things he’d always been frightened of, that maybe he actually
He took it with him anyway, as he slumped heavily over to the couch. Truth be told, he would have much rather gone to bed… But it was eleven thirty on New Year’s Eve, and going to bed
“You wanna go somewhere else?” Tony just… guessed. Except, as he was saying it, he realised it wasn’t exactly a guess. That he could tell that Steve had just remembered this place was somewhat silly. Not even offensive or distasteful – just too commercial and too fake and too on the nose. That he’d sort of known that’s what Steve would think about this place… because he knew
“Could you, just, uh…” Tony waved him quiet, screwing his face up against the frustration of thoughts. “...Could you just give me a minute here, please?”
Tony sighed, pleadingly – and Steve loved that sound. He loved Tony’s voice, and his smile, and the way he held himself. He loved Tony’s body, the way he fit so perfectly against him, he loved the way Tony moved.
that look was, but it wasn’t ‘goodbye’, and Jesus, that would do. In the moment, he’d cling to that, he’d cling to anything
Whatever ‘getting over Steve’ looked like in the end, however long it took him, however many false starts… It couldn’t be predicated on Tony not caring what happened to Steve. That wasn’t in Tony’s control. And it wasn’t one of the wrongs that Tony wanted to right. And he was pretty sure that would’ve made him the asshole anyway…
When Steve had walked out of the bedroom, that adorable little smile on his lips, those ocean blue eyes looking at him through those impossible lashes –
He took a second, waiting for the room to settle back into the familiar. Feeling like that whole exchange had been very surreal… like he wasn’t completely confident it had really happened.
Tony smiled – and then pinched his lips, and dropped his eyes for a second, obviously overwhelmed. He swallowed hard before he looked up again, his voice just a little bit lighter when he carried on,
For a moment Steve stood there, numb, a high pitched silence ringing in his ears, as an eerie, dizzy awareness came over him…
Tony felt Steve suddenly stiffen, and stand up straighter. When he turned to look, he saw that Steve was glancing back toward the doors, his brow creased in concentration. And then Steve turned back, and realised that Tony was looking at him, and before Tony could ask, he said,
“Well, in that case he liked you a lot more after you died” Tony sighed “So, I don’t know, maybe that
“No, it isn’t,” Steve corrected her, very calmly. He watched her eyes flash in confused panic. He could see her struggling to fit his combative words with his compliant demeanour.
an emotional delaying tactic, that it was just one of the things he’d have to think about when his head was clearer
Tony huffed irritably. He knew it wasn’t JARVIS’ fault, but still, he couldn’t help being annoyed at the unwelcome interruption - especially as it had woken Steve up.

And he ‘knew’ that eventually this balance would probably topple. At some point, he’d probably go back to over analysing and feeling bad…

“Wait, woah, wait a minute,” Steve demanded, throwing a hand up in front of him. Scaramouche paused, obligingly. “Hang on -
Perhaps, a few minutes earlier, Tony would’ve taken it that way. Maybe he would’ve made an attempt to hear her out, see this from her point of view, ask himself if he was being as manic and unreasonable as he must seem to her.
And, actually, for the time being, it could all wait – mainly because he wanted so much to hold Tony right now.
Along with yet another shiver of guilt, and the creeping understanding that this outcome was probably exactly what he deserved...
talk to Tony about all this… He even started to think about how, hypothetically, he might start a conversation like that…
“…I don’t think this is how people would naturally behave, under these circumstances.” Tony answered, his tone cool but not aggressive. A complete answer, but without any unnecessary words. Enough that no one could say he’d ignored Steve. Not enough for Steve to make anything of.
And for maybe a minute, nothing moved. Even the thoughts in Tony’s head stopped still, like the whole universe had called a minutes silence in respect for this impossible event. He just let Steve lie there, his fingers still threaded through Steve’s hair, and he didn’t think at all.

Steve could’ve taken a moment to establish exactly how things were going to stand in this timeline - to state out loud, for the world to hear, that he was cutting all ties to the previous version of himself and the loyalties he’d been tied into-
Of course, in Sam and Bucky’s case, they were actually here because of an unfortunate culmination of office politics.
And then Tony nuzzled closer into Steve’s neck, his breath warm against Steve’s skin when he whispered,
And then something shifted in the very foundations of him, as he became aware of a more fundamental fear, something so vast and terrible that it didn’t have a name…
It was entirely unlike any of the emotions that had crashed through him in the last few minutes – and it certainly wasn’t a

Bucky’s eyes widened in an amused sort of intrigue – but he didn’t question it. Of course he didn’t. He just smiled,
“Because I can’t get drunk on earth.” Steve answered, matter-of-factly – because apparently Tony had said that out loud.
And, okay, that wouldn’t have included a little tube of lube, if it weren’t for the fact that Steve had kept his jeans on the last time he fucked Tony. It was only that his pocket had been the easiest place to stick it when he was done with it – but Steve knew that’s what he’d done.
And then there was this blooming of giddy, gleeful joy, that just seemed to consume him from the inside out. Tony was suddenly so excited and awed and happy, he didn’t know what to do with himself. He wanted to race around the house, screaming. He wanted to fall to his knees and weep. He wanted to laugh, he wanted to dance, he wanted to
Some feeling that was conspicuously absent in all of his thoughts about Steve - and Tony didn’t know what it was, and he didn’t know if he felt good or bad about it...
Tony smiled, and gave the smallest nod, and let Steve tug his shirt up over his head. And then he pressed himself close, wanting to feel Steve’s body against his, wanting to claim every inch of him-
Steve’s chest clenched in panic, and he immediately wanted to take it back, to apologise - but no words came out.
“Mrs Ken always just called it ‘rice and corned beef,” Steve remembered, warmly. “Which I suppose doesn’t help much.”
“I’m angry that you didn’t tell me what was going on, as soon as Vienna happened. Even if you felt like you couldn’t tell me about my parents – even when that had actually become a mission relevant detail, that I maybe had professional right to know, even if you didn’t feel any personal obligation – but, even then. You didn’t tell me
“I know that some of these tests might be uncomfortable,” he said eventually. “That’s just… how it is. Sometimes medical treatment hurts, and I don’t like…
blue eyes, just looking at him like that… Tony rubbed his face, irritably, and tried to at least put it all into some sort of order. Instinctively starting with the
By the time Steve made it out of the bedroom it was seven thirty – and Tony was just pouring his third cup of coffee.
It had taken him on quite a journey so far, sweeping between elated highs and anxious lows as he’d run through every line of his conversation with Tony-
“Well, I’m not sure of all that much, these days - but I’m pretty sure that sleeping with you won’t make my life
Steve hadn’t realised how desperate he was for that touch until he felt it, how much he needed to feel Tony’s skin against his - but as he opened his mouth to beg for it, Tony lent down to cover his lips in a deep, possessive kiss.

here. There was some part of this he felt at ease with, entitled to, even though it made no sense. Some part of it that felt
see himself in a relationship, after all this time simply assuming it would never work. The fact that he’d just sat here and thought this all through, without it being a big deal….
And Steve had worked out that Tony was trying to stall. That he was trying to throw Adam off. That he was building to something more than this one point…
He thought of Steve as he sank his teeth into it, his whole being already tensed in an effort to concentrate. Bracing for the flood of excitement, the overabundance of sensory input. Already warning himself
Steve looks at him like he’s terrified, like he thinks Tony’s going to do something awful like hit him because he feels betrayed – this whole thing with Natasha has made them very careful around each other, careful with going too far, touching nerves, pushing boundaries that shouldn’t be pushed, and Tony hates that, he hates that Steve should feel scared around him, scared of his reaction, and he hates that he feels like that himself.
“Really?” Tony quirks an eyebrow. “Because I remember what happened very differently. I remember waking up one morning, and the bedsheets were cold. There was a letter on the pillow, and it said,
“And that was the reason that you weren’t interested in this relationship anymore, this too-boring family that we’d made, right?” Tony asks, the rage a fire in his throat, leaving his mouth dry as sawdust. “And maybe you still are, but the reason why you were gone so long isn’t just because you were bending her over the fucking table, was it? I mean, I’m sure that played a part in whatever the fuck you were doing, but those late night, those weren’t just late nights, were they? They were late nights for SHIELD?”
“You’re not,” Natasha agrees, unaffected by his anger, “but like I said, you’re the husband of someone whom I love very much, and I wanted to see if you were good enough for him. In my eyes, I thought if you got jealous, you were either a possessive dick who didn’t like it when Steve’s attention was on anyone but you, or you cared about him enough that you wanted to keep him with you. I thought if you weren’t jealous, you didn’t care enough about him, or you were confident enough in your relationship that you didn’t need to be jealous. You
“And I’ll bet Natasha helped you come to this conclusion out of the goodness of her fucking heart,” Tony bites out, his voice snide.
s’. They dragged him away. I’m pretty sure they shot him because that’s what they do, the British. They kill us if we say too much.”
“Well, that’s not how I perceived it,” Tony says, coldly. “All I was certain was that you were having an affair and trying to keep both sides of your life. It was the little things, like you stopped asking me about my day, like you could take it for granted that I would be waiting here for you, with everything done, with food on the table and the house clean and the kids in bed with their homework completed. And then, our sex life, you were suddenly all over me, constantly, and we were having so much sex, and so I decided that maybe I made a mistake, maybe you weren’t having sex with anyone but me, maybe I was just reading too much into it and you were still attracted to me, and then it stopped. It just suddenly stopped, and I was convinced that the reason we stopped having sex was because you were getting it somewhere else, because you wouldn’t have been shy if you were just looking at porn and getting off on that. I was so convinced that someone else was giving you what wanted, and I was just… I was just extraneous, I stopped having that use for you, and all I was good for was to take care of your kids and cook you food.”
“That’s because you’re a good person,” James says, with a wry smile tugging at his lips. “I wasn’t… in a good place, back then. All I knew was revenge. All I wanted in the world was to get back at the people who’d taken everything from me, and you were there, and you brought light into my life. And I fell in love with you, and I knew you were in love with me, and I know… I know you would’ve taken anything I’d given you-”
So he began sorting the documents into piles, giving the task very little attention… having already moved on to daydreams about Steve, and plans for later that night…
“Uh, yeah, how am I feeling…” Tony repeated, taking a few heavy, staggered steps in the direction of the couch. “Well, let’s see… I think I might be having the world’s happiest nervous breakdown…”
Right now, Tony missed Steve so much that he could feel it as an absence against his skin, like an itch he couldn’t find. It had been two months since they saw one another. Two months of picturing Steve in some damp motel room, or squashed into one of the narrow bunks on the jet, and wishing he could make him comfortable. Two months of worrying about worst case scenarios and detailing ridiculous contingency plans, in the desperate hope of keeping Steve safe.
“Rough night?” He commented, looking Tony up and down. Tony threw him a playful glare as he smoothed down yesterday’s t-shirt.
It hadn’t raced ahead to nightmare scenarios of all his friends imprisoned and the world enslaved and the memory of The Commando’s ruined forever, all because he’d made
He didn’t really think of it so much as he just went to do it, his hand naturally reaching out where he knew Tony’s was, a
to seeing Steve like this - something powerful enough that it would’ve completely thrown him, if it hadn’t felt so natural.
He fixed Nick with a level stare for a second, allowing himself to briefly indulge in the fantasy of saying no. Or, at the very least, pointing out that - from his perspective - it had only been a few weeks since he’d
And then, when he was satisfied that he had considered Steve’s every need, Tony let himself fall back onto their bed and sighed. He took a second to indulge in the warmth of Steve’s happiness, and the tingle of his own anticipation…
good, as it slipped down his throat. He heard himself moan, the ache in his hips settling into a pleasant, dull throb as he began to move against Steve, swallowing the length of him, and then again, and again…
He carried on with his original plan like he was playing along with it – because, hey, what else was he going to do?
“He’s fine, he’s good - everything works perfectly, the vital signs are all good,” he assured, walking over to the couch. “And I’m fine, I’m good… Just… you know…” and he threw his arms out in a wide, theatrical gesture,
“I...I, uh, have something I need to talk to you about, too,” Steve sighed, miserably. He put the sketch down, and swallowed hard before he made himself look at Tony again-
“Oh, good. Yeah, let her in,” he waved, turning away from the cluttered desk and towards the elevator. His stomach clenched again, and Tony actually hissed at it under his breath,
enough time to rethink all of his priorities, all of his memories, his entire sense of self. It wasn’t long enough to make a decision this big. Tony couldn’t commit to walking away from this, or to
“I don’t get drunk at all ever” Steve answered easily, as the redhead knelt to drive the spikes into the floor, rooting the makeshift table in place.
?” Tony whined, looking up at the ceiling with an incredulous expression on his face. At times like this, he could swear he felt JARVIS smiling at him. A patient, affectionate sort of smile, probably.
. He wasn’t sure what made him so reluctant to say that, actually, given that he’d been so eager to talk about Tony Stark all week…
“Oh, God, I want to touch you, please can I - please, I want-” Tony babbled, as that frustration sharpened to a breaking point…
tell Bucky that he understood. He couldn’t share any of the anecdotes or personal lessons that might be relevant right now. He couldn’t even ask Bucky how
He simply hadn’t prepared himself for relief like that - it hit him like a physical blow to the gut.
A little dip of disappointment, as he watched Tony take a steadying breath - like he was building himself up
For finding himself in these ridiculous situations, no matter what he promised himself… or other people.
“...Do me a favour JARVIS,” he announced. “Pull up the most detailed map of Sokovia you can find - and see if we can find a list of all the known warehouses, or similar facilities.”
he dismissing the suffering of an entire people, if he acknowledged that it was separate to him? Was it even possible to care about a tragedy, and accept the importance of those hardships, and take the necessary precautions to avoid it happening again, if you didn’t feel that tragedy as your own?
Right at the very moment that there was something to hope for, just when he saw all the mistakes he’d made, right when he’d finally realised that he could be more than that-
“I…don’t really want to talk about it,” Steve muttered, eventually. Already bracing himself for an interrogation…
“I know, it sounds ridiculous - and it’s really not much like all those old fairy tales and horror movies… But, I’m pretty sure that’s where all those myths come from. Because there

...Except, now that he was about to put his hand to the entry panel, Steve didn’t know if he could call this churning reluctance ‘a desire to be with him’
free to arch his back, as Tony slowly slid his hands under Steve’s t-shirt, up over his ribs, caressing Steve’s skin as he undressed him. Steve
And Tony just let himself soften into the warmth of him, his body melting into that embrace as Steve’s beautiful, strong hands made their way up his back. A little voice whispered in Tony’s head,
to have … Only to find Steve still dazed and love-struck and desperate to talk about the boy he liked.
“Okay, well, I’m going to go and deal with this…” Steve muttered, gesturing gingerly to his shirt – the wet stain across the front, from whatever Tony had thrown it into-
“Yeah?” He whispered close, deliberately letting his lips brush against Tony’s throat. He felt Tony’s ribs twitch under his hands, his legs tensing harder against Steve’s thighs like he was trying to anchor himself.
At first, he didn’t think anything of the fact that he could hear Bucky’s voice. It was simply something that was familiar, and far away - like everything else. By the time it occurred to him to look up, Bucky was already striding purposefully towards him, Sam trailing behind, trying in vain to get Bucky’s attention…
, that there was literally no way for Tony to forcibly take control of him like this. Just as he knew that he couldn’t surrender like this if Tony weren’t able and willing to take care of him. This reaction simply wouldn’t happen,
And then Tony just sort of… came to his senses. His back straightened, his features sharped, his grip on the sketch flinched tighter, enough to crease the paper…
And then Tony blinked himself awake, an adorable little pout softening on his lips as he stretched out of his sleeping position-
Tony literally had to gasp for air, almost panicking at the intensity of this sensation. He could feel Steve all the way though the centre of his body, the pressure throbbing deep in his thighs, up through his back. The aching pleasure of it,
just ten more minutes until an elite team of SHIELD scientists, soldiers and secret agents came bursting through the door of the warehouse, shouting orders and demanding attention as they wheeled a gurney into the walk-in refrigerator at the back of the room.
“Okay,” Tony nodded. There was a little flicker of scepticism behind his eyes, or surprise, or confusion,
he knew… but he knew. Like clicking into the right slot, that sudden feeling of rightness as he found that exact place-
And Steve was used to people taking an interest in his love life – Natasha asked for a post-mortem every time he talked to anyone new, and Sam had a seemingly endless list of single people to wax lyrical about, whenever they went out for drinks – so it didn’t occur to him to wonder why Tony wanted to know. He just answered.
“We need to talk to one of the humans that work here, preferably someone with access to the research work” Tony told her, efficiently. “So, we need you to find us somewhere we can interrogate them without being seen – but, more importantly, we need something we can do with that person for at least a couple of hours afterwards.”
“That’s it?” Tony demanded. “You’re here because some crazy guy is going around Malibu telling people he’s Captain America?”
There was the faintest sound of crunching gravel, from so far away that even Steve wouldn’t have heard it, had his super soldier senses not been turned up to eleven-
how people talk, Steve.” Tony said, softly. “I mean, at least some of the time. Especially to people they care about – the people who really know them, the people who are there all the time… they
carefully, and slipping it into the pocket on the inside of his jacket. “I, uh, probably should’ve thought to ask for some of that, actually. Sorry – this is all kind of new on me…”
Steve broke the kiss with a gasp. Even though every inch of his body longed for more of this, even though every instinct was screaming at him to carry on – he stopped the second Tony told him to.
He knew, really, it was okay for him to be excited that Steve was on his way. Whatever twenty years of conditioning told him.
- without telling Tony that he loved him… After all, he’d literally tried that once before. He’d tried to explain why he didn’t tell the truth about Tony’s parents, without telling him
“Woah, is that… safe?” Steve asked, before he could stop himself. His shoulders already bracing, in case he had to pull Tony away.
“Woah, sorry, can I just-” He glanced from her to Tony, and then immediately back at her again. “So, it’s one of us… one of us is going to be the…” But Janine just smiled and held a palm up,
But still, Tony had tried to smile as he checked them both in. He’d tried to act like one half of a happy couple at the start of a vacation, while he scanned the lobby for anything that might ambush them or brainwash them or eat them… He’d tried to ignore Steve, and the attitude radiating off of him. And then a smiling blonde woman had appeared beside them, and introduced herself as their representative, and offered to give them the grand tour of the building – and Tony had thought,
Back then, Tony was worried that it would just be awkward and painful for months, that he’d have nothing to talk about, that he’d be permanently anxious about slipping up…
behaviour was normalised – and they mean ‘harmful’. Or ‘dangerous’. Or they should. They should be able to point to a reason the world would be worse off if these enhancements were allowed, or why it’s unfair, or whatever – and the thing is, I actually agree with all that. I think experiments like Strucker’s should be banned. But not because they contravene some made up ‘law of nature’.”
His head fell forward, his body softening in Steve’s hands, his thighs burning where Steve had bruised them and his throat raw from screaming and his eyes stinging with tears-
At first, Steve was just glad they’d stopped talking - his neck had started to ache with the effort of bouncing between them.
There was the impossible softness of Steve’s lips, the taste of him, the strength Tony could feel resting gently in Steve’s arms – all so much more vivid, experienced through more powerful senses-
Also, just to be on the safe side, there are more details in the end notes - the only dub-con element of this whole thing is the fact that they're on drugs, but there is that, and there are some sub-dom themes explored.
But, before Tony could beg, Steve’s hands were on Tony’s hip, and on his shoulder, that incredible strength already radiating down through his arms-
Some of the tension returned to Steve’s shoulders then, as that lazy pleasure quickly sharpened into a more immediate desire. He managed to push himself up onto his knees, lifting his ass and spreading his legs wider, still rocking up in that same needy rhythm.
“I’m thinking that, firstly, this should help us find any sources that SHIELD didn’t,” Tony continued in that same animated patter, “but, you know, also that it might uncover anything SHIELD were trying to hide, or
He saw the thought flicker behind Steve’s eyes, the nervous pursing of his lips. Tony raised his eyebrows,
“Well, we’ll just have to hope no one heard that.” Steve whispered, as the door finally came free. He did a quick scan of the stairwell, and only once he was sure it was clear did he wave for Tony to go ahead of him, watching the corridor for threats as Tony ducked past him. And then Steve softly closed the door behind him-
in that bunker, either. Or Bucky. And if I just let you go into that hell hole, with nothing but a shield, and no one there to cover you, and then you get shot,
Whatever happened with Steve, tonight or in the long term, Tony knew he’d remember this day for the rest of his life.
Steve had always hated small talk anyway. Even in the forties, he’d gritted his teeth through every interaction with new people - or followed Bucky around like a valet, if that was an option. And back then he’d at least known how to speak the language. Now, the thought of trying to start a conversation with a stranger, having to navigate all the assumptions and references that they didn’t even know they were making, avoid the pitfalls of offense and misunderstanding with no idea where they might be hiding...
It didn’t matter that Tony hadn’t been thinking any of this yesterday. It didn’t matter that he hadn’t expected this and couldn’t explain it. It didn’t matter that this was all so unlike him, and so contrary to everything he’d ever told himself, and so at odds with everything he thought he knew.
“Well, technically he’s right,” Steve reminded him, with an edge of amusement. “And, to be fair, I don’t plan on telling him
, to anything as basic as violence or sex. Important enough that, for the time being at least, even the revelation that Tony had
. He’d been so determined to meet that goal, so genuinely thrilled at the thought of achieving it, that everything else had been forced out of his head…
“Do you think that Stark had figured all that out before we even went there…” he mused. “That maybe that whole appointment was just him…
The three of them sat to attention, as the door slowly swung open, and a tall man in a smart black uniform came strolling in.
He remembered Bucky’s tortured scream. He thought of all the horrible things that Hydra had so callously forced him to do, without a second thought, without a care in the world…
Confident enough that he was no longer listening out for anything, as he started running theories in his head…
The intense satisfaction of giving Steve what he needed, feeling Steve let go of that agony and fall into such honest, animalistic joy-
do something once, and it’s who I am.” And he stopped himself, and corrected himself theatrically, “No, you know what, it’s
...Tony still had that nagging feeling that they shouldn’t have gone back to work today. That he was
Another random thought leapt into his head – which had been happening all evening. Right now Steve’s brain was just an endless noise of unrelated, unhelpful ideas, yelling at him ineffectually… This time the memory of a particularly clueless guy he once overheard in a bar, ranting to his friends that ‘he didn’t know why Lola was so upset’. And, because Steve had nothing else to concern himself with back then, he’d listened along with a horrified sort of interest as the guy explained his attempt at a good deed… Which was, as far as Steve could tell, offering to sleep with a gay friend –
“…You ready?” Steve asked, his voice both brave and fragile. Tony smiled to himself. He wondered just how much had come down to the fact that he simply
And now that Bucky had made that throwaway comment, Steve found himself picturing Tony’s face again… those big, dark eyes looking up at him through those impossible lashes… Steve
But, for as long as these things weren’t in his control, Steve could only admit that the one place he felt comfortable in the 21st Century was at the head of the Avengers conference table.
But Steve could feel the growing urgency of it. The way Tony’s fingers gripped more firmly, the way his kisses became messier and more demanding as he moved lower down Steve’s back.
“…The portals that bring people here are our technology, not the humans” She explained carefully. “I can meet you at the party tonight, and show you how it works. That way, when you get to speak to Franciszek, you can just send him straight to your friends afterwards.”
His heart still clenched as Bucky disappeared from view; there was one final tug of panic as he recognised that he was just letting this chance pass…
And then he relaxed just a little, when he realised that Bucky wasn’t aware of anything anymore, that at least he didn’t have to worry about Bucky being worried… Which, usually, was Steve’s cue to start worrying about everything else. When he’d start looking nervously between the monitors and the doctors, as though he could prevent a catastrophe if he was watching when it happened-
things more clearly now. And it wasn’t just that he was more aware, or more awake, or because his senses had all improved – this was a more cerebral thing. Like the moment when he finally worked out the crucial flaw in a complex theory, but applied to his entire life. A dawning sense of realisation…
thrown his hands over his eyes. Luckily it had been too dark in that room for their guide to notice… But Tony got the impression Steve wouldn’t appreciate being told that all this wasn’t that extreme-
Steve’s muscles coiled in temper, his legs already tensed so that he could stand, and walk right over to Clint, and-
injustice… Who understood the pain Tony was in, the confusion he must surely feel, the pressures he must be under. The person who had listened to Tony’s story that night and
… and, Jesus, it’d been a long time since he felt better about anything. It was a reprieve, just when he so badly needed the rest – and he’d take it.
“C’mon,” he muttered, jerking his head in what he hoped was the right direction. Sam and Bucky followed him, obligingly.
“And if they see us, we have no plan but to knock them out,” Sam added, wearily. Bucky’s shoulders sagged - because nobody really wanted this to get into a fight of any kind.
Immediately, there was a pulse of reassurance. Not enough to drown out his fear, but enough to temper it, at least-
“Where is this place? What are we doing?” Tony demanded, in an urgent tone that jarred sharply with the mood. Everyone flinched to a halt and turned to face him-
Steve hesitates. “Does that mean that we’re, uh, we’re going to try and work through our problems?” he asks, hope shining through his voice.
“I was… working as a day labourer. It was easy money, and they paid me under the table. I’m strong, so I was able to use that to my benefit,” James tells him, running his hand through his hair. “Suddenly, there were these guys in my apartment. We fought, but it was a quick fight. I’m… I’m good at what I do, and those guys were just grunts. All but one died.”
James sighs. “Steve, I have been seeing my therapist regularly over the last few months. He thinks I’ve made great strides in my recovery. I still have some blank spots, but they don’t mean that I don’t remember what I felt for you.”
“In my family, it is. It very much is, or it’s a white hoax, because they think too much of themselves or they aren’t built to be resilient like us, and we aren’t that weak,” Tony muses, grim-edged. “Anything to do with mental health, we can deal with it. We don’t need to talk about our feelings; if we have any problems, we suck it up, because there are a lot of people who have it much worse than me. We just… deal with it. We are not weak.”
The next morning is an exercise of forced calm. Tony wakes up with a crick in his neck from the unfamiliar, too-soft bed underneath him, the voluminous pillows that no guest would dare sleep with dragging the air from his lungs, as he desperately tries to breathe.
Steve smiles at him like the sun, and that fluttering in his belly, in his chest beside his pathetic heart returns.
“You would know,” Loki drawls and then, chokes, when Tony slams him back against the wall, his palm open against Loki’s throat and pressing down hard.
Tony is hot, hot all over, and when he stretches, there’s pain but a good pain, a pain that tells him that he’s been ridden hard and put away wet. He can’t bring himself to be unhappy at that. He touches the bruises on his thigh, the imprint of teeth on his shoulder and his pectoral, which throb, and he remembers Steve’s hands there, pressing him open, and he shudders, slicking the sheets underneath them. There’s come staining his belly and his thighs, where he hadn’t cleaned up, and Steve is asleep beside him, snoring into the pillow, a muscled arm slung over his waist, fingers absentmindedly dragging back and forth across his hip even in sleep.
“What else am I supposed to say here, huh? Pretend like it’s not happening. I’m not that good of a liar, honey, and no offence, but I’m not sitting here and acting like everything’s fucking fine when my husband is opening his legs for someone else.”
He curls his hand around the shield pendant, wanting some reassurance, but his hand closes around nothing, empty space.
The next morning, Tony walks into the mess hall with a split lip, a bruise on his cheekbone, and the imprint of fingers around his throat, showing like a damn prize that he’d earned.
Tony nods to himself, running his tongue between the seam of his lips. “You know how you said that the reason why your Daddy and I were married was because we love each other, and we want to stay together forever. How would you…
“I ruined the mood,” he says, feeling self-conscious. “It was good, what we were doing. It was hot, and we were about to come, and I got… I got scared, and I just had to…” he trails off, his throat working around the lump in his throat. “I ruined the mood,” he finishes, pathetically.
“You… you, she talked with you on the phone, and I would think that you were happy to get out of here, get away from your boring husband and your boring children to
“That’s not how you made me feel,” Tony says, savagely. “That’s how you made me feel every time you rejected me, every time you turned your back on me, every time you made me use my vibrator instead of fucking me yourself. You
“You said your piece; now, let me say mine,” Tony barks at him. “I wondered for years what I’d done. I’d wondered if I’d said something, done anything, acted too clingy, whether you’d heard something about me that turned you off me. I felt like shit, constantly, thinking about you, thinking about how much I’d embarrassed myself around you by acting like we were in love when you clearly didn’t feel the same way.
Tony’s father, for someone who isn’t used to him – hell, even for someone who’s used to him –, is a formidable presence and not the easiest person to stand up to.
Steve and Tony spend the whole seventy-two hours of his heat in his bed, except for a once on the table, which breaks under their weight and the force of Steve’s thrusts, and a few times in the bath.
Warnings for this chapter: explicit sexual content, dirty talk, consensual verbal degradation, low self-esteem, suspicions of infidelity.
“I’m going to get that truck. I’ll meet you there, at the university, the square outside the main building. Be ready for me. We’ll leave as soon as I get there.”
This family is his, this relationship is his, and the idea that people want to use Steve and James and his kids to prove some stupid point to the world, it makes him sick, which is why he almost brains the reporter that he finds sneaking through the side gardens to get a good picture of the Stark-Rogers-Barnes family in their natural habitat.
day,” Steve insists. “This is… this is supposed to be the beginning of our family, our lives together; you, me, Toni and Peter. The four of us, like it always should have been. I don’t… I don’t want anything to ruin that. I know Sharon needs our help. I think we should send Nat and Clint and Thor. Between the three of them, they can handle it.”
? You’re going to stay in Daddy and Appa’s room and take us to school and make our lunches and watch movies with us?”
But Steve’s cock stays stubbornly limp between Tony’s fingers. Steve leans down and brushes Tony’s hand away from his lap.
“Do go on,” Steve says, eyes darting from the camera’s view to the view in real life, as if he doesn’t quite know which one is more appealing.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve says, coldly, eyes fixed on his cock in his hand, which is still stubbornly soft.
Peter doesn’t say anything; he just throws his thin little arms around Tony’s shoulders, hugging him close.
that you hadn’t been with anyone else before me, Steve. It meant that you were completely mine, and I’ve told you that fifty-thousand times before, I’m sure. And fuck you, fuck you for slut-shaming me. I have never been secret about when I started having sex, Steve, or how much I’ve had it. You
“Okay, look, I get it, I get that you want me to leave,” James says, and he shoves a piece of paper into his hands. “It’s where I’m staying. Please, when you’re free, come and see me. Tony, please,
Caroline clucks her tongue. “I understand. God, getting these kids up and to school, it’s a job of its own, isn’t it? Is it just you today?” she asks, mock-innocently, as if she doesn’t already know that it’s always Tony who comes to drop the kids off at school and he’s always alone.
His belly is full of wine, and there’s a certain confidence in his words that would never come without it.
“Sir, sir, please, get back in your car,” he says, importantly, as if that bright yellow sign in his hand gives him some measure of significance in this world.
Tony looks back, only to find that James is telling the truth, that the kids are walking towards him, curiosity plastered all over their faces. They wind their little arms around his legs, when they reach him, peering at the stranger from around his thighs.
Steve is smaller than specs for the machine, much smaller. He looks over at Abraham. “You save me any of that schnapps?” he jokes, his voice thin.
Tony lifts his eyebrow. “Perhaps you did not realise what just happened. I just opened your brother’s throat. He’s lying dead on the floor, as we speak.”
Steve kisses him softly, genuinely, a little messy like he hasn’t kissed much. Tony balances his hands on Steve’s shoulders, tightening, and then, parts his mouth underneath Steve’s, who groans, arms winding around his waist.
“Fuck you, fuck you, Rogers,” he swears. “You think, you think you can show up after all of these years, after what you did to me, after what you did to my
“Samuel,” Wanda says, sternly, “I am the one lying in this hospital bed with a concussion. What are you so concerned about? You know Tony, and you know Steve, and you know they’d never do anything to hurt us on purpose.”
Tony stares at him, and Steve stares right back, and there’s practically only a foot or two between them.
The blood is hot in his face, as he looks away; as much as Wanda is his friend, and as much as he’s already telling her all the dirty details, there is still something unbearably humiliating about detailing all the way that your marriage is failing.
“I know I left before, and I know that you don’t trust me because I left before, and all I can say is that I’m sorry, that I love you, that I hated myself for leaving you like that, warm and satisfied in my bed, and you were smiling when you crawled out,” James says, roughly. “I did that to you. I made you think that you weren’t good enough, that you’d done something wrong, and I’m so fucking sorry, because that’s not true, that’s not true at
because I was smart enough that he wasn’t slumming it with me but dumb enough that he didn’t feel inferior, the same way that he felt with you. He didn’t see me as a person. He didn’t see me as a friend or a student or someone worthy of his respect. I was like a project to him, and when he found out about us, he was furious, not because I’d… I’d used you or abused you or took advantage of you in some way, but because I had used
Maushmi rubs at her eyes with her free hand. “I couldn’t sleep, so I was coming to find you. Can you read me a story?”
, and I know you don’t need me to keep you safe,” Steve says, fisting his hands in his hair. “You’re strong on your own, and you don’t need me, not really; you can take care of yourself. I’ve heard all of it before, okay? I know that it’s demeaning and unfair and a shitty excuse, and it makes you feel like I don’t have a good opinion of you, but you’re wrong.
“Why the hell didn’t you tell me?” Tony asks, furiously. He rounds on his mother. “When I came to you, you told me in vivid fucking detail what you all did to Obadiah Stane but you failed to mention that he fucking
“My God,” he says, bluntly. “Your bathroom is a mess. Tomorrow, when you get back from school, you are both going to clean this bathroom from top to bottom or you won’t get a slice of that cheesecake in the fridge, do you understand?”
“I’m coming. Just… wait, I’m near the Hayden Planetarium. I’ll meet you at Prospect Park. Can you get there?”
James says it so earnestly that Tony is almost tempted to take him up on his offer, so tempted to let James take care of him, but then, reason wins out, and he shakes his head.
. She’s the love of my life; I’m going to marry her one day, and you know what, she’s going to say yes, because she loves me too.
that if I told you about him, told you everything, told you how I was madly in love with this guy and he broke my heart and now he was back and he made it clear that he was still in love with me, that everything I’d thought about him was
He throws a switch on his console, and the vita ray reactors come online. Finally, he turns the power dial, and a piercing whine fills the room. On one of the gauges on Tony’s console, the needle begins to climb.
He emerges out of the bathroom in his night clothes, nothing similar to what he’d been wearing the night before. Jarvis follows, as he plods obediently through the wing to his bedroom.
“No, it isn’t, but it won’t be less,” Tony promises. His hand settles on the nape of his neck. “It doesn’t mean much from me right now, and it will be an adjustment for all of us, but it won’t be less.
“The snakes, do you think they’re here?” Tony asks, quietly, as they make their way through the corridors, the torch lighting their way.
Tony twists his head so that he can prop his chin on Steve’s breastbone. “What do you think I should do?” he asks, quietly. “I could… I could lock it all up and drop it into the bottom of the ocean, or we could, we could head over to the Compound tomorrow, talk to Bruce and Lang and see if we could build this, build this machine, and maybe…” he trails off.
“I’ll keep an eye out for SHIELD and any strange characters that might be lingering around my house.” Tony pauses. “Except for you, I suppose.”
Tony sees Sarah lingering in the doorway, and she embraces him, tightly, when she sees him coming towards. He clutches at her for a moment – she’s known him for his entire life; he’s dating her son; they’re practically family at this stage.
A frown tugs at the corner of Steve’s mouth, and Tony knows that nothing is resolved, that there is still so much for all of them to talk about, and Tony, Tony knows, despite what Steve may think and say with his words and his eyes, that Natasha Romanoff is a problem, and that to Steve, despite what Bucky Barnes means to him, James is also a problem, the sort of problem that doesn’t go away if you close your eyes to it.
“They were stupid,” Tony insists. “I think you’re handsome, sexy, attractive, all of those things. If I need to spell it out for you, I would fuck you on this couch, right here, right now, and no, that was not a challenge for myself – it’s a sincere wish.”
“I… I didn’t deal with Pietro’s death very well,” Wanda says, honestly. “I was angry and erratic and there were days when I didn’t want to get out of bed, that I wanted to crawl into bed and never wake up again. Sometimes, I thought I should have died,” she confesses and almost seems surprised by her confession. She shakes her head. “I loved him, and he loved me, and we came into this world together, you know? It didn’t seem right, it didn’t
Tony chews on his lower lip until he feels the skin split, feels the sting, tastes iron in his mouth. He stares at the pleading, pained look in Steve’s beautiful eyes, and then, he looks down at his feet.
He throws his arm around Tony’s shoulders, and all of them head back inside. Tony makes sure the back door is locked once more, and they all go back to Tony’s wing.
, Tony. That’s it. It wasn’t because I was getting sex somewhere else, or because I wasn’t attracted to you anymore. For fuck’s sake, it’s
Tony drags his teeth together and then throws his arms around James’ shoulders, clutching onto him tight, burying his face into the muscle mass of his shoulder.
at you right in front of me,” he says, disgust lining his voice as he remembers that little scene. “You gave her the recommendation for the restaurant.”
When he hears cars coming from up ahead, he steps into the shadows, just as a mine car passes with several laughing Nazis.
“Of course, Hamlet's response to this, and to his mother's lies, was to continually probe and dig–just like the gravediggers–always trying to get beneath the surface.  The same was true in a different way in Julius Caesar. Thor, go ahead...”
Steve shrugs. “I don’t blame you. Hell, I don’t think Bucky blamed you. If… if it were me, and I’d seen someone killing my mother on a video, and that person was standing right in front of me, no one would have been able to stop me,” he says, quietly.
Getting Peggy to help is easy enough. She’d been furious when she’d heard that the Allies weren’t mounting a rescue mission themselves.
Steve and James both flinch at that; it shouldn’t matter to them, it should be obvious, for fuck’s sake, because he has never made it a secret how much he loves his children, how much he loves his children, how much he can’t breathe unless they’re safe and happy.
“She actually stood there, knowing all the while that she’s fucking my husband. She came into my fucking house, around my fucking kids, and she pretended to be my friend, like she was so concerned about my fucking relationship, and-and she actually tried to give me marriage advice.
After a while, Steve devolves into silence and continues to fuck Tony, his eyes fixed on the way that Tony takes the plastic cock. The angle is a bit awkward, with Tony half in the air and his feet planted on either side of Steve’s hips, but Tony pushes through it. Fire licks up his insides, as he approaches his orgasm, climbing the metaphorical edge until he can fall off. He fucks himself down onto the cock, his hips reduced to nothing more than dirty little grinds. He gives Steve an obscene look, which he’s happy enough to catch with the camera, his pupils black and blown, knowing that Steve and the viewfinder can see everything, his body stretched wide around the girth of the cock, his hard cock slick with pre-come, his dark skin gleaming with sweat, and the lust shining all over his face.
Hodge grunts, and a few of the hands slip from Tony’s body. He sucks in a gulp of cold, thin air and starts fighting again, but Hodge’s backhand snaps across his face, the pain flaring hot.
“It feels really good,” Steve pants, shifting closer to Tony. “I don’t… it’s not like when I… not like before, not like when I could come before,” he says and swallows like there’s a lump in his throat.
His fingers find his nipples, thumbing over them as they turn diamond-hard, gasping a little at the sensation.
Tony breathes a sigh of relief, then turns and walks back behind the bar. He begins to clear the bar of the remaining glasses when he notices one remaining patron huddled over his glass at the end of the bar.
“I met her a week or so after my birthday,” he goes on. “We’d… we’d gone out for my birthday, just me and Steve, at that Italian place we like? He bought me that necklace, the gold one.”
They’re digging into the back of the linen closet, rooting through boxes, when they finally come across an old photo album, with long ring binding a gold front. Tony cracks it open, and the plastic creaks.
The woman’s face falters just the slightest, which makes Tony feel like a dick, and then, it brightens all over again. “Caroline, remember? Your twins and my Bill are in the same class?”
The sunlight rushes up to engulf them, blinding them in its glare. The mine car shoots out of the tunnel and roars down towards a little dock at the end of the tracks, and Tony’s stomach flies up into his throat, his eyes burning with tears caused by the sudden flux of heat and sand blurring his vision.
“Tony,” Steve says, in a voice that makes Tony think that he’d desperately like to change the subject.
Tony climbs off the bed and aims the camera under the bed and then, proceeds into their walk-in closet and bathroom, barely avoiding tripping over a plush dinosaur strewn across the tiles.
Tony leans forward against him, brushing his mouth against Steve’s collarbone. “I wanted to be all smooth for you.”
“Just thinkin’ about somethin’,” Steve replies, his voice soft, as he presses a kiss to the crown of her head. “Did I wake you?”
“I only came to Tony, because I was worried about him, because I thought he needed to be warned about something that might come and hurt him, hurt his family, and because, yeah, I needed his fucking help,” James says, and he’s angry now, Steve has made him angry. “If I’d managed to get rid of HYDRA, which I would have if you hadn’t been following me and watching me, then, I’d never have made contact. Despite what you may think, I’m not a fucking glutton for punishment. There was no way that I was going to stick around to watch more happy days between some guy and the only person that brought light into my life after years of
“I’ve changed,” Tony admits, shyly, almost wanting to cover his body. “I… I mean, I’m not the same as I used to be, not when I was seventeen and we slept together. Besides, it was one night; it was quick-”
“No, that’s okay,” Steve replies, absently. “I’m pretty starving. We might as well just get a main.”
