“Not mad? No insanity? No little rats scratching at your brain?” Lucifer asked, slanting an accusatory glance to Castiel. Castiel didn’t notice, as all his attention was on Dean.
“Kind of,” said Ella. “It’s complicated. But all Greater Demons are Fallen. Next there’s Lesser Demons, like Maze—Mazikeen—they’re made out of the firmament of Hell. Last is imps, which are human souls turned all twisted and wrong.” She wrapped her arms around herself. “One of my exes became an imp. Lucifer says it only happens if the soul is particularly corrupted. It’s against the law, in our Hell, to intentionally make imps. I’ve heard that your Hell is only imps?”
“So,” said Dean. “Someone yelled at him and he jumped to the order – so fast that he didn’t bother with the pearly gates and smashed through the First Sphere.”
Crowley sighed. “Yeah. I’m going to leave Watchie here with you, okay? You can play fetch or something. No hurting my dog.” This was directed to Dean. He stood up.
“Yeah, it’s a social thing,” Chloe said, catching on right away. “They do it when they’re together and relaxed. Less so around humans, or other angels they don’t like. The only way to get them to do it around you is to do it back.”
“Believer?” Dean asked. She nodded. “Sorry,” he said, and didn’t know what else to add. Chuck was an asshole. There wasn’t much more to it than that.
Cas shrugged. “Different world; they use different terminology. It’s alright, Watchie,” he added when the dog whined again.
“Oh, dear me no, of course not,” Aziraphale said. “But they must be made by hand and made with love. And it must be genuine. He’ll be able to feel it, if it’s not.”
They roared down a side street, and then another, and then another. Dean was pretty sure all LA suburbs looked the same. Finally, they pulled up on a patch of grass—an empty lot. Amenadiel was there, and so was Michael. Dean shared a look with Cas in the rearview and got out of the car.
wings. Spread awkwardly, dead limbs, hanging from the tree. And the thing was, Dean had just learned all about wings. He’d just preened Cas’s wings this morning. He knew feathers were soft, except the blades which were awesome. How Cas went all puddly and sleepy. How he thrummed.  Wings were
“You’re the only human in the room,” Crowley told him wryly. “And therefore, the only one who actually needs to eat. You get first pick.”
“Oh, he’s the best friend ever,” she was saying lightly. “Never mind that he’s the best to hang out with—he tells great stories, and he really listens, you know?—anyway, I get free drinks at Lux. That’s his night club. He also gives the
“Michael has the gift of foresight,” Aziraphale said lightly. “He tends to be correct about these things.”
“Winchester,” Crowley said through the door. “You gotta come downstairs. Your angel’s an idiot who’s never going to ask, but you really do have to learn how to do this.”
“What did I say?” asked Decker, bewildered, like saying she belonged to Lucifer was like, no big deal.
“Lucifer,” sighed Chloe, though she looked amused. “Okay. So—trapping—God? What would that even look like?”
Michael smelled like whatever a human liked best. Chloe Decker and her bloodline, of course, were immune, but according to a certain Dorothy Winters, the smell got stronger when he was in heat. Dean was a little immune too - Michael had a similar effect on most humans as Lucifer, and Dean wasn't thrown in the throes of passion or a little hypnotized like a regular human might be. Still, he could definitely smell it. Michael was very intrigued by this Dean, after all.
Cas pulled out his cell phone, and suddenly Dean understood who all those other numbers in there were. He kept Daydream World phone numbers. Just in case he found his way back. He really cared about these people. Well, that was obvious, but it was still hitting Dean, with each new bit of evidence.
“Right, that’s an angel thing,” she said. She pulled on a blue exam glove that she seemed to have produced from thin air. “Let’s get this party started.” She strode up to the dead angel.
It also meant that Dean was his vessel. He met this angel’s eyes head on, a challenge, and they looked back at him, calm and amused, like he had the best secret ever
He?” He paused, glaring at the far wall as if collecting himself. “You’ll be useless if we try to do this right now. I certainly was right after my first one,” he added, still growling a little. “Stay together. And then I want a full report. Alright?”
“Excellent. Place your left hand here, please.” Carefully, Aziraphale stepped over to one side and then rested his hand at the top of Cas’s huge, spread wing. “This is called the leading edge. It’s essential for flight. It’s also where you push to fold the wing.” He took his hand away and arched an eyebrow.
The bunker, the Impala—home was in the other world, but this place seemed so peaceful. A place where Lucifer and Michael had a truce, one strong enough to let them sit calmly in the same room. Where Lucifer had a girlfriend, and said girlfriend came up to Dean looking casual and hot and unafraid. He wasn’t sure he trusted that yet, but Cas clearly did, and that went a long way.
Dean thought about this, about the mark of Cas’ hand that had once been on his arm. That was a tight bond. Cas had said so himself. Alright. That wasn’t so bad. He relaxed. “Weird properties?” he asked Cas.
Now that was handy. “Huh,” said Dean, watching as the giant dog peeked at him from behind Cas, all sad eyes. “So, if I named one, say, Terminator it would become the Terminator?”
Cas led him through the door and down a short hall. “Say the word, Dean,” he said. “I would love to.” It was clear that he meant it, clear that he was dying to live here even, with his friends. Dean thought about it as they crossed into a large dining room/kitchen, where sure enough Crowley had made some kind of massive omelet-like dish.
He could kind of feel those happy thrums through his fingers as he fixed soft brown feathers. He definitely felt it in his chest. It was—weirdly endearing, weirdly precious, too precious for teasing. He straightened Cas’s feathers and listened to Cas fade into a kind of half-sleep, still making that deep sound. Dean was smiling. He knew he was smiling.
fierce and true and it took his breath away. He wanted to arch right up into Dean and thrum and hide there forever.
“You know what it’s like?” Crowley snapped, and now he was in Dean’s face. What the Hell? Dean held his ground and glared. “Let me tell you what it’s like. It’s
“She’s Dean’s pride and joy,” said Cas from the back, sounding startled, over Dean’s outraged noises.
Dean and Cas walked over. She had manipulated the angel’s arm so they could see it. The forearm was bruised and slashed all to Hell.  “Defensive wounds,” said Ella. She raised her arm as if protecting her eyes from an invisible blow. “And there’s some kind of—” She reached into her purse, rummaging. She pulled out a pair of tweezers. “Never know when these’ll come in handy,” she said lightly, and used the tweezers to pull something out of one of the wounds.
The dog didn’t let him pet it – it just raced around him, tail wagging, until it stopped, stiff-legged, and then stared at Dean. It did indeed look like a large, thick Doberman or a very slim Rottweiler. It did something with its brown eyebrows that made its gaze almost pleading, as it watched Dean.
“I can also transform the body, afterward,” Cas said. “Into something innocuous.” He cocked his head. “It’s not in a vessel—I can manipulate it.”
“Yeah. It’s weird. I know it’s weird, and the timing’s weird, and everything’s weird. But we’re the only two humans to successfully pull off a full paradox. We’ve got to talk. Linda’s—not quite there yet.” She shrugged.
A lump formed in Crowley’s throat. No, there wasn’t a catch with him, he promised silently, touched.
“Awesome,” said Dean, breathing deeply as the nausea faded. It wasn’t as bad as before, but then, they hadn’t flown through Hell this time.
“No, you just—oh for Whoever’s sake,” Crowley muttered. “It’s fine. We’ll fix it. Took me a while, too. Boss! We’re nicking Castiel and his human. Call when you need us.”
sound. “It’s kind of like ‘uh-huh,’ but it has some other meanings too. Like ‘I’m paying attention,’ or ‘I know’ or ‘I approve.’ Informal agreement, Linda calls it
Aziraphale paused and looked at him thoughtfully. There was approval there. Dean felt like maybe he just scored a point, somehow. “I can get you something,” he said lightly.
just to spite him, but Cas nuzzled along his hairline, all affection, and said, “We will be out in a moment.”
“Because you’re going to make amends,” Aziraphale said firmly, and Dean definitely didn’t have a choice about that. “Crowley is right: Castiel has been meeting you on the human side of things, but he is not human. He is an angel. He will require different things from you. The first step to meeting him in the middle, as you must, is to make a dowel. They are significant, you see.”
having a body again, because his hand was still joined with Cas’s hand, and Dean never ever wanted to let go, even if it was dumb, even if it was the most chick flick thing to ever happen.
“You literally just called Lucifer,” said Dean, stunned. She’d called him without any fear, too, and he hadn’t like, popped into being threatening to murder them all, either.
Holy shit, they were actually really good, even though they had vegetables in them. There was some kind of sauce and spice that was unfamiliar, and the veggies were still kind of crunchy. Also, he was really, really hungry.
right now? Oh, wait, Cas was dude-shaped and Dean had made a lifetime out of shouting that he wasn’t gay to cover up the fact that he was way confused about the whole thing. Also, the body was Jimmy’s. Screw it. Jimmy was dead; it was just Cas in there and Cas was worth it. It would still be glorious. They’d figure it out.
Ella perpetually owed Michael a knuckle sandwich. She wasn’t stupid enough to pick a real fight with an archangel, but she did glare at him a lot.
“No catch,” said Aziraphale.  “This is my universe, not yours. It has exactly as much meaning as you place into it. For example, my dowel is made of braided papyrus from the River Nile. I clipped it and braided it and dried it. I melted gold to shape the tip, and to bind it at the top. There is a miracle to preserve it, of course, so I did cheat a little, but Crowley doesn’t begrudge me that.” He smiled. “Crowley’s is mahogany. It has protective properties, and it is a strong, beautiful wood. He cut the branch himself, and he carved it himself. It took him months. This requires effort.” He paused thoughtfully and added, “Lucifer made one for Chloe. Now, Chloe doesn’t have wings, but it was a gesture. He made it from blown glass. Chloe’s is made of porcelain and glazed to look like stars. Linda had a bamboo plant in her house that had grown large; she used the wood from that to make one for Amenadiel. Amenadiel has had one for eons; it’s made of silver and looks like a vine. So, you see, it is personal, and as difficult as you make it.”
Though he had no words for it, Dean was wanting Castiel to be comfortable, and to have a gender that was closer to what he actually felt, which was agender, rather than male, instead of spending so much time and effort mimicking something he was not. Aziraphale would have cooed over a choice like agender, a human gender that was close to the genderless state of an angel, while still maintaining a multifaceted human experience. Of course, Castiel never would have thought of this on his own; it took Dean, a human, because at the end of the day only humans understood gender. One day, when they had this discussion for real, Castiel would decide to keep ‘he,’ since he was used to it and the word was rather meaningless to an angel anyway.
Aziraphale beckoned him, and he followed. Aziraphale made a fist, and then lightly tapped Cas’s spine with his smallest knuckle. Dutifully, Cas spread both his wings. They were huge, Dean marveled, nearly reaching the walls on either side of the room. He’d seen that they were brown and banded like a falcon’s before, of course, but up close and stretched like this—wow. That was really something. They were really awesome. Aziraphale turned to Dean.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked, feeling less charmed. This universe was so weird, man. And it didn’t look like there was any pie here at all. That was disappointing and kind of a cocktease. Pie-tease. What was with that smell?
Ella swallowed and looked up the stairs. “What do you think we should do? About this. This apocalypse—thing. Everyone says you’re a professional.”
, no harm would come to me. And I did. And he was right.” He took a breath that Dean was fairly sure he didn’t need. “So, Dean, I will ask the same of you. In Daydream World—trust me, if not the others. That can come later.”
“Anyway,” said Aziraphale, sitting on the arm of a chair occupied by Crowley. Cas always said that those two were attached at the hip, but it was weird actually seeing them together, visibly opposites in every way, and even more visibly together. “Castiel, do you know anything about why Him Above might order Raguel to do such a thing?” He paused. “Or you, Dean. What is happening in your world? What is this about the other universes collapsing?”
Charlie. That was it. She was reminding him of Charlie, a little, minus the red hair and the computer stuff. He—liked her, Dean thought. Weird.
“They talk about us like we belong to them, but really we know it’s the other way around.” Her smile went impish. “Anyway, Lucifer’s mine. Or I’m his. The special human, that is.”
His wings slumped. Then, at last, he said, “Chloe and her bloodline. They’re key. Blessed by Father, carried by Amenadiel, the strongest of us. They’re immune to Lucifer and to some degree, Father. They can’t keep Father out entirely, but they can make it harder for him to be here, for his orders to be heard. That is why only the First Circle heard him; he was blocked.”
“Get all of the big clumps,” Aziraphale said. “Call me back over when you’re done. Don’t wipe it from your fingers; it needs to go on the surrounding feathers. After you do that, I shall show you how to straighten the other feathers.” When Dean nodded, he strolled off to sit with Crowley. He heard them murmuring together, but not what they said.
. “Yeah, yeah,” he grumbled. Cas fussed at his clothes, fixing where they were askew. Preening, Dean realized, that was preening again. How had he missed this? He reached out and ran his fingers through Cas’s feathers, the ones that had gone crooked, and he fixed some of Cas’s clothes, too.
shockingly so. He liked the care and attention Aziraphale and Crowley paid him, each different in their own way—Aziraphale meticulous, Crowley doting—but this was entirely different. This felt like
“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” Cas said, because of course he knew that one. Metatron had definitely dumped Shakespeare in his head, that time.
Love? Since when were they talking about love? Dean clenched his fists, but Aziraphale spoke before he could say anything.
And Cas was immediately mobbed by a man in a tweedy, old-looking jacket, with blonde hair and great, off-white wings.
“Why?” said Lucifer, and he sounded genuinely confused. “Why suffer through it, when we can just fix it? It can’t be pleasant.”
“I eat here,” Cas said. “Different rules. I can taste here. It’s not all—molecules.” Dean tried not to be fond of that nose-scrunch, he really did. It didn’t go so well.
“We could try,” Cas said, very soft. His eyes had gone a little round, like a deer who had spotted something incredible in the headlights.
“C’mon, Dean,” said Ella, nudging him away from the door. She looked sympathetic. “Let’s wait downstairs and let the angels do their angel thing.”
“Raguel is the Vengeance of the Lord,” said the tall black angel sitting backwards on a chair. His great dark wings were folded neatly on his back, sleek and powerful looking, somehow. He looked directly at Dean, eyes bright and curious. “He is mostly powerless, these days, but when Father commands him to take Vengeance, he becomes the most powerful of us all. He ran away, rather than harm Chloe.” He smiled a little, as though proud. “You must understand, Dean Winchester, that for any of us that is a great act of defiance – for Raguel, it is a nearly impossible act of will. He has bought us time. But we must understand—why has our Father ordered Raguel to kill our humans? I would not ordinarily question an order but—our humans are beloved. I went back to Heaven and found no answer. It makes no
Crowley shook his head. “It’s not,” he said, and he sounded upset. “He’s still looking at you and seeing
Funny. According to Amenadiel and Michael, she was the woman keeping them all alive. She and her daughter, he supposed; Michael had said bloodlines, so the kid was part of it too. She looked—perfectly normal. They both did. Beatrice had her head in her mom’s lap, and Chloe was braiding her hair. There was no indication whatsoever of the raw power it took to render an angel human-ish, or a god unable to set foot on the world. The movie they were watching looked superhero-y, but Dean didn’t recognize it.
“Angels make their own bodies here,” Cas said. “They don’t need vessels. I’ve been told not to tell Lucifer about my vessel, that he would take it badly.” He smiled wryly.
Dean’s stomach plummeted to his knees. “No way,” he said. “Gotta be another way. Cas.” He looked at Cas pleadingly.
“Ouch!” Dean had tried the same thing, though much more carefully. Castiel didn’t stutter in his song, but he flailed a little, pulling Dean away from the sharp feather and looking aggrieved. Dean had cut his finger on the feather, just a little, but it was still deep enough to be vicious. Angel feathers cut humans like butter. “Still sharp,” Dean said. “It’s not him; it’s you.”
“Watch it!” hissed Lucifer, too late: she had scraped her hand on Castiel’s sharpened primary. Castiel jumped, apologies writ large on his face as he pulled his wing away. His eyes had gone round with horror, though he didn’t stop singing.
“Yes, you can,” said Michael. “Your human is standing beside you. Don’t you see? An angel and a demon, a human and a devil—and an angel and a human. It will be nigh unbreakable.”
“Hey Watchie!” said a feminine, delighted voice. “Hi there! Hi! Yes, who’s a good Hellhound? Who’s a good Hell-puppy? I think it’s you! I think it is!”
“Great, let me tell him,” she said. She sounded really pissed. Which—wasn’t quite what Dean had expected, somehow. He’d expected, like—angst, not anger.
Dean didn’t know how to explain it, how to explain that he was strong enough to endure something as stupid as this, of course he was. It sucked the big one, but he was going to live. Besides, that was
Cas stepped up to his side. He rolled his shoulders, and to Dean’s absolute shock, two huge freaking wings unfurled from his back.
“So, I had a fight with Crowley,” said Dean, and he was suddenly reevaluating Crowley too; yellow eyed demon or not, Cas loved him, and also Crowley was capable of
wings were made to be touched; Cas went all puddly and thrumy when Dean ran his fingers through the feathers. It was an absolute crime that Cas couldn’t manifest them back home.
That was weirdly familiar. “You know,” Dean said dryly, “the Lucifer that I knew liked to explode people.”
hugs—he’s a squirmer, but once he relaxes, he’s super warm and heartfelt. His advice is pretty bad, to be honest, but he means well.”
“We have time for me to give you a piece of my mind,” snapped Crowley. “You’ve been treating my eyas like dirt and I am calling you out.” He smoothed down some of Cas’s feathers carefully.
“It’s relaxing,” Aziraphale explained. “And also signals the start and the end. Now, very important; Castiel is a Seraph in your world, and therefore rather high-ranking. This means he has blades on his wings.”
“You must be Dean.” A blonde woman strolled up to him, looking curious. She was gorgeous too, slim and confident and hot damn the body on her. He really hoped she wasn’t an angel.
This was also kind of weird. Dean’s head was clearing, regretfully, and the hand-holding thing was starting to have more—weight. It was kind of girly, wasn’t it? But he wanted it. He wanted it really badly, and from the way Cas clutched at him, he wanted it, too.
Dean had treated Cas poorly enough. Things were changing, he thought, determined, right here, right now. If they were going to do the chair – and they were, because that meant they could sit closer—then Cas got the seat. Dean got the arm. No arguments. It was stupid and symbolic and they were doing it.
“Is there anything that might make an angel crash through the First Sphere?” There was a pause. She frowned. Her frown deepened. “Lucifer?” A beat. “Lucifer, you okay?” Another beat, and her eyes widened. “Oh my god is this a Fall thing? It is. It so is. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean—” He interrupted her, clearly.
And all this talk of paradoxes, like they were incredibly powerful. He was dying to learn more about that, honestly. Something like that in his back pocket—well. That could be useful.  Though Cas seemed weirdly shy about it. Going to have to get to the bottom of that.
The kid scans the room a moment and then jerks his chin in the direction of a guy wearing army fatigue pants and a t-shirt for a band he doesn’t recognize, “the ‘I’m not queer, I’m only here for my gay best friend’ guy who is obviously looking to take home some pretty little piece of twink ass that he will definitely deny by morning.  I mean really, camo and a band t-shirt to a gay strip club?  It’s like the I’m-Not-a-Homo Uniform.”
, even in the solitude of his thoughts.  When had this temporal collection of cells become a flesh manifestation of his being instead of the transportation ewer that his training and very nature told him that it was?  That it
The hunter darted out an arm, twined it around the seraph’s shoulder, and dragged Castiel down against his side.
Once he has everything back in place, Dean settles on the hood and gazes up at the sky full of stars, expansive around him due to the low, flat stretch of land that makes up the whole state.  He wonders idly where Cas is, how he’s recovering from this latest misadventure.  Whether he can see any stars where he is.  Which ones.  A smile quirks up the corners of his lips.
Castiel stared down at his folded hands resting on his crossed legs and digested this for a moment.  Something ached in his chest at Dean’s words, not only because he had called Castiel “good” despite all of his faults and wrongdoings but because his friend consciously wished for him such a beautiful first sexual experience.   After a moment, though, a small smile worked its way across Castiel’s face.
With each successive drink, Dean's more relaxed, and as Dean relaxes Sam's demeanor gradually changes.  He talks more but less flamboyantly; smiles more; flirts less.  He snarks at Dean and everyone else in the club a lot more; calls him "honey" or "sugar" a lot less.  Dean's not just more comfortable with the kid, he's more attracted to the kid as Sam gets more real.
If his porn exploration is any indication, Dean’s not looking to pick up Macho Bad Boy (he’s got enough of that going on himself) but he’s also not looking for someone who is
Benny hadn’t missed the shock on Dean’s face as he spoke.  In fact, the hunter even managed to look a bit embarrassed, as if he had been trying to hide Castiel’s previous poor behavior from his new friend.  Much to Benny’s astonishment, the angel seemed to find it much easier not to rise to the inducement this time.  In fact, the self-righteous bastard had the nerve to fix him with a tiny, steely smile.
“You know what?  I think I’m going to go for a run after all,” Sam announces.  “Well … uh … have fun, you two.”
“He wanted me, Cas, and I couldn’t do it.  I wanted to take this kid home, fuck him senseless just to get you out of my head, and I couldn’t do it.  I would have kept thinking about you, pictured your lips on mine, your mouth on my cock, your ass in my hands; I would have kept imagining it was you as I fucked him.”
friend; and since Dean didn’t have all that many friends, he needed to protect the ones he had.  Because that was just the way he worked: Dean protected the people he lo—
“So I’ll ask you again, Dean,” Cas demands, “what were you trying to accomplish with this little display?”
Ignoring the last part, Sam tries to gracefully bring this back to some semblance of a mature discussion.  “So what you’re telling me is that you’re … bisexual?  Or just … Cas-sexual?”
Cas barks.  “Speaking to an angel who isn’t present isn’t just idle chatter, Dean; it’s prayer!  After eight years, I would expect you to know that.  And what’s worse, after the entire debacle with Gadreel, I would
It was all Dean, really.  When it came right down to it, the flesh he inhabited felt like a body instead of a temporary vehicle because of Dean.  The hunter had always treated him as the celestial being he was but at the same time as something apart from the rest of his kin.  The attitude was contagious, it seemed.  More than that, Dean had introduced Castiel – often forcefully – to sensations and actions and feelings that he doubted many other angels had ever experienced.  The elder Winchester’s own humanity invaded his being, weaving intoxicating, seductive tendrils into his essence until he could hardly separate the writhing strands of emotion and experience from his ethereal spirit.  He hardly wanted to prize the two apart anymore; the very definition of what “Castiel” had come to mean was underwritten by Dean Winchester’s hand.
Sam just nods, rolls over in the seat so that his hair dangles out the side window, and goes back to sleep.  Dean eases himself out the door and rounds the car, opening the trunk as quietly as he can.  He fishes out a clean pair of boxers from his duffle and quickly strips from the waist down.  A splash of water from a bottle in the trunk onto his discarded boxers serves to help him wipe down his front a bit – Jesus, he hasn’t come in his pants since he was a teenager – and he redresses quickly enough.
Whatever else I am, I’m still more powerful than you can even conceive of, and somewhere along the line you’ve forgotten that, Dean.  I am not to be toyed with, and I will remind you of that forcibly if I must.”
Cas had dropped to his knees so quickly and unexpectedly that Dean actually cried out in shock when the angel’s mouth engulfed his erection.  He had to fling his hands out behind himself to brace his body to keep from wobbling over, a moan tearing itself out of his mouth as he watch his slowly disappearing and reappearing from between the angel’s lips.
“Okay, so … what the hell happened?  All I remember is that you put your hand on my shoulder and when you came, it felt like I was freaking electrocuted.”
“Then what is?  Clearly we both desire this.  Why hold back then, other than fear?  You may as well just take me, Dean, if that’s what you want.  I’ve been yours all along.  Surely you must see that.”
As opening lines go it’s kind of lame, but the kid is so enthusiastic as he says it that Dean can’t help chuckling.  “Surprisingly enough, there’s no work involved.  It comes natural,” he returns with a half-grin.
A light wave of Castiel’s fingers and Dean’s hands were clean.  The action drained away much of his remaining Grace, but he considered it well lost.  Castiel barely breathed as Dean fumbled behind him, the telltale noise of a zipper proceeding fingers brushing Castiel’s back as the hunter pushed his jeans away.  The need for air to be taken into his vessel rushed back to Castiel when those warm hands slid over his hips, moving away Castiel’s pants and teasing a gasp from the angel’s lips when Dean’s bare flesh met his own.  Fighting to keep inhaling and exhaling – he needed to remind himself to do this – Castiel stared at the fingers that return to his field of vision when Dean pressed them against his mouth.
The seraph shook his head.  “I’ll watch over you,” he replied as Dean settled back to the ground.  Castiel spent the rest of the dark hours replaying the evening in his head and letting the sounds of Dean’s passion-soaked voice play like a hymn in his head.
Cas moved towards him little by little, inching up on an elbow and leaning in slowly as if he thought Dean might shy away.  Their lips slid together in a silky slide and Dean let his muscles go loose, falling to his back as Cas slid over him.  The angel’s weight was warm and strangely comfortable on his chest, new and pleasantly unfamiliar when they caught and chafed and stroked against each other in ways so different to a woman’s body.  Looping one hand underneath Cas’s bracketing arms to clutch at his shoulder, Dean slid the other down to clutch at the angel’s rear, guiding him into a slow roll that rubbed the angel’s hardened length against his just enough to start his blood warming but he still wanted so much more.  Cas had proved himself a quick learner over the last few days, his body moving against Dean’s much more naturally as they rocked and dipped together.
If he’s really honest with himself, Dean would say that this feels a whole lot less like fucking and a whole lot more like … God, he doesn’t even want to
you beg?  Jesus, I think I would come just hearing you say it.  Would you say it for me, Cas?  I want to hear you say how much you want to fuck me.”
He slides his arms down to curl around Cas’s back, and he probably would only admit it under threat of torture but it feels so freaking good to bury his face in the angel’s neck and just clutch onto him.  To his surprise Cas does the same, hiding his face in the hollow of Dean’s throat, clasping so tightly at his shoulders that it almost hurts.  When Cas speaks next, it
“Shit, Cas, if this was just about the sex, I would have had no problem taking home that kid bartender and having a hell of a one night stand, but I couldn’t do it.  It isn’t about sex, Cas; it’s about you.”
be pissed at the idea that he’s being cast as the chick in this scenario, but he can’t help but laugh.  “Oh yeah, baby; talk nerdy to me.”
“Hell no,” Dean retorted.  He glared at Castiel as he growled an explanation.  “We were both fourteen-and-a-half, her name was Rhiannon Lattimer, and she was plain and shy and the sweetest person I’d ever met.  She said I had eyes like spring grass and she was the only one in that whole school that didn’t treat me like I was a moron just because I wasn’t smart like Sammy.”
Dean settled on the ground as he always did, removing his coat and folding it for a pillow for both of their heads, but when he laid down for sleep, instead of stretching out on his back to wait for Castiel, the hunter turned away from him, curling onto his side and wrapping his arms around his heaving chest.  Castiel scowled as he watched his friend, watched him quaver as he attempted to hold in sobs, clutching his crossed arms to his own chest and turning his face away towards the ground.  Lowering himself to a crouch behind Dean, Castiel put out a hand to his friend’s shoulder.
Castiel struck out in fury, his fists pummeling the nearest object, which happened to be the rough bark of a maple tree.  The knotted and scarred trunk did not bend under his attack, of course, but Castiel did not cease his assault even when he heard the popping cracks of bones breaking in his hands.  He let out a single furious howl of anguish and frustration, earning him a low moan from a few feet away.  The angel rushed back to his friend’s side, bending over to watch the hunter’s eyes trace restlessly back and forth beneath his eyelids.  Another moan.  That decided Castiel’s actions for him.  Reaching out with two bent, bloody fingers, Castiel focused on willing his Grace into Dean’s body and repairing the damage.  The hunter stiffened for a moment, then collapsed back to the ground.  The tense muscles in the hunter’s forehead relaxed as Dean slipped into a deeper slumber.
Benny strode forward, off toward where he could see the angel in the distance, circling a promising clearing in the trees, leaving the bewildered hunter alone with his thoughts.
“Angels do not bow to the level of jealousy,” Castiel said with a heavy sniff, directing a glare at Dean when he snorted in caustic amusement.
Hope you enjoy this chapter, lovies.  The next few will be a very different tonal shift, but this one sets up where I go next.
Seeing as how this is the end of the actual plot line (the epilogue is a wrap-up that made me smile), I probably won't make you wait all the way until Monday to see it; probably will post either tomorrow night or Sunday morning (US Eastern Standard Time).
One more quick glance around the parking lot of the motel showed him that there was no one around.  He hadn’t expected there to be; that was the whole point.  Sammy was sound asleep back in their room across the lot and all the other occupied rooms were on the opposite side of the hotel.  Even knowing that Sam slept like a log and most likely wouldn’t wake up had he stayed in the room, he didn’t want to take the chance; he just didn’t think he’d have a good explanation ready if his little brother happened to get up to take a piss or something.  Dean wasn’t sure why the idea of Sam knowing his secret hobby seemed so embarrassing, but it did.
“I wouldn’t though, Cas; not in your mouth.  I’d pull you back up into my lap, push my tongue into your mouth, taste myself there.  You could stroke both of our dicks together while I stretched you out on my fingers –
When Cas finally does wrap his lips around the head and take as much of Dean into his mouth as he can, it does become clear that Cas wasn’t lying; he hasn’t done this before.  He sets a steady pace of forward-back sucking that is too slow by half and maybe a bit wetter than it should be – but hey, Dean’s never had a dick in his mouth, so who is he to judge saliva production?  That being said, it is by far the best that any kind of sex has felt to him in ages.  Years.  Maybe since Lisa, and six years is a fuck of a long time to be having what is apparently sub-standard sex with women when he could have been doing this with Cas.  Whatever he lacks in style and technique, he’s making up for in enthusiasm because the humming increases (which,
“Yes?” Dean answers as he roots around in the fridge.  “I mean, both?  I don’t know, I haven’t really explored the bisexual thing all that much
Benny grinned a bit.  First words he’d said to the angel in days.  Maybe it wasn’t a kiss-and-make-up apology, but it was a start.  Benny bandied back and forth with Dean about his blood habits a few minutes more, unable to restrain his exasperation at the hunter for his flat refusal to believe that a vampire might actually put any stock whatsoever in human life.  Finally, he couldn’t take the human venting his spleen any longer and growled out a sharp reply.
leave his mouth when Cas turns, slots their erections next to each other, and starts up a tight rotation of his hips, chafing his length against Dean’s in a way that makes Dean’s eyes cross.
“Jesus, sometimes-” he started, pinching the bridge of his nose as he settled against a tree’s roots.  When the insinuation landed, Dean sat up stiffly.  “Just what the hell are you trying to imply?”
Benny chuckled to himself a bit.  Maybe the maiden aunt deserved just a little bit of peace after all.
“Or maybe,” Dean says, letting the fantasy spin out of his head and into his mouth as he pictures it, “maybe you’d want to draw it out.  How would you start, Cas?  Would you suck me off?  Wouldn’t be the first time I’ve pictured that happening.  You on your knees, stretching your lips around my cock.  I bet you could take me all the way down to the back of your throat.  God damn, that mouth of yours; just the idea of pushing my dick between those lips makes me want to come.”
"And that helped the kink, too.  I have a sister who's nine years older than me and she came back home after grad school to help take care of me for a while.  I was sixteen, she was twenty-five, and she had a twenty-eight year old boyfriend with a wicked smirk, a leather jacket, and a 1969 Camaro convertible."
“And I even understood the reference,” Cas quips in response.  “Although, I draw the line at force-choking you.”
All of the turmoil of the past week melted away as the hunter cast a worried glance at his friend.  “Why don’t you blip outta here?”
The words were as much a weapon to him as the knife in his hand, jammed underneath the nose of yet another monster.
Cas scowls at him but seems to see the logic in it; or if not, he acquiesces to Dean’s request to get past his anxiety.  With a sharp snap of the angel’s hips, Cas thrusts himself fully inside Dean and then pulls back to watch Dean’s face.  Dean, on the other hand, clamps his eyes shut and just tries to breathe deep and relax.  After a few seconds of silence broken only by Cas’s steady breaths and Dean’s hitching gulps, Dean cracks one eye open.  Cas stares at him from barely an inch away, brow scrunched in thought, and then when he catches Dean’s gaze, his expression clears and he seems resolute.
Dean didn’t really have a good answer to that. The honest answer was that he didn’t give a damn about alternate universes. He cared about Sammy. This was probably selfish, but it was the truth.
Dean was now about sixteen times more interested in her than he had been before. “Hate to break it to you, sister, but you drive a sleeper car.”
The thing that had wrenched squeezed. “So are Crowley and Aziraphale.” He could see that, sense it, even having barely been here a few hours.
“You are not a spell ingredient,” Crowley told him firmly. “You are Castiel. What do you think he is, a walking apothecary?” He glared at Dean, rage rising in his posture.
“Looks like,” said Dean. Cuddly? Seriously? Dean would use a lot of words to describe Crowley, but cuddly wasn’t one of them. People kept telling him about all the great things that Crowley had done, but all Dean kept seeing was a douchebag.
“Not Hell,” said Cas. He’d straightened. “The core of the Earth. The heat will distort His perception of you. And if you could perform a spell that radiated outward, mimicking an explosion—but how to hide the Earth afterwards?”
“Following the primaries,” Aziraphale said, tapping more feathers, “are the secondaries. These provide lift and are also important for flying. Lastly are the tertiaries, also important for flight, but not as much as the others. Everyone is different; Castiel prefers we start here. The feathers here—” he ran his dowel through the smaller feathers above, “are coverts. They are for air flow, but they also help with powder down, which we shall get to in a moment. Lastly is the alula, which helps with control.” Aziraphale smiled. “Now, most importantly, is the powder down.” He slid his dowel underneath the smaller feathers – coverts – and lifted them. Underneath was a bunch of matted gray stuff.
It was Beatrice, oddly enough, who made a funny small angel sound at him, kind of a cooing low in her throat. The fire in Lucifer’s eyes died down, a little.
“You okay?” Dean asked, startled. The wings were attached to Cas, of course, and they’d moved before but—it was different. The wing was warm and
Dean’s head reeled. Pain? What pain? It all kind of blurred into rage. “Back off,” Dean growled, a warning, because he was in Dean’s face and Dean was itching to deck him.
Aziraphale bustled up to him. “Crowley gave you—ah. Good.” He showed Dean his baton. “This is called a dowel,” he said, very firmly. “After this, we are going to teach you how to make your own. This is very important; a dowel feels like its owner. The one you are using is Crowley’s. Luckily for us all, Castiel quite likes Crowley,” here he reached over and sort of affectionately tapped Cas with his own—dowel, “So it should not be a problem.”
“And—you’re in the same room,” Dean said faintly. Pie-smelling Michael and Lucifer snuggling a beautiful woman and her daughter. What the Hell was this world, man.
The story washed over Dean. This favor thing didn’t sound good. “Souls?” he asked abruptly. “Does he collect souls?”
Dean looked down. His fingers were covered with pale brown powder down. “Oh. Yeah. Hey, Cas, do we use this stuff?” He shook his hands and some of the dust fluttered to the floor. It wasn’t particularly gross; it felt like very, very fine sawdust.
Dean spared one more glance to Cas, concerned. But Cas nodded, and he was clearly not afraid. So, he followed Ella down the hall, and Watchdog followed them both.
“Uh,” Dean said, eyeing their twined fingers. “Isn’t that a little—” he wanted a word that was like “chick-flicky” but couldn’t think of one. Cas’s palm was very warm, for a guy who wasn't technically human.
He kept an eye on Crowley, out of bed with his wing bandaged. He looked downright miserable and very small, especially for a demon. It was a lot to ask, to trust a yellow eyed demon, and it had only been three days, but Dean was starting to get it. Crowley leaned into Aziraphale’s side, uncharacteristically silent. Aziraphale kissed his temple and passed him more Mexican food, since they’d ordered in. Those two could paradox. That said a lot. Dean was kind of fascinated.
“The first thing you are going to do, Dean Winchester,” Aziraphale said, still severe, “is pull all of this out. Powder down is made to crumble; it will disintegrate in your hands. You will not hurt him.”
“Because it’s not as black and white here as it is there,” said Crowley sharply. “Greater Demons are forbidden to kill humans directly. But Azazel holds a grudge and there’s ways around that decree
Crowley and Aziraphale came back late. The sun had gone down, and Dean had sort of drifted to Cas’ shoulder, curled up next to him on the remarkably comfy couch, while watching a frankly awesome movie series called The Weaponizer that didn’t exist in Nightmare World. They’d sent a letter to Sam, assuring him that they were alright. Sam had replied; Jack had apparently come out of his room in search of food, so that was good.
“It’s fine,” Dean said, a little bewildered. “I have literally never seen you sit backward in a chair, but it’s fine.”
Did it count as gay if Cas was technically not a dude? Because he really, really wasn’t—Dean could see that now. Cas was a dude because Jimmy was a dude. Cas didn’t have a gender at all; he wasn’t human, and still didn’t really get it, though he tried. Cas was a fucking—a tornado, a hurricane, a force of nature. Forces of nature didn’t have genders. Cas should stop trying; he didn’t have to try just to fit, if he didn’t want to, if it didn’t come naturally
“They all needed to know,” Crowley said, strolling out onto the balcony. It was warm and sunny, and his step was not at all urgent. “Lucifer will stop freaking out when people stop trying to hurt Chloe; a paradox will help. This triple paradox thing sounds a bit far-fetched, though.”
“I have the gift of foresight,” Michael told her kindly. “I know things, but they come to me in a—scattered manner. Also, I found the paperwork in Heaven
“Can’t kill him, either,” said Dean. “It’s lights out, if we kill him. It affects the balance; the world falls apart.” This was extremely annoying, since Dean would love nothing better than to gank the bastard.
Okay, now Dean’s pissed.  “Oh, because you’re such an easy man to find when you’ve fucked off to wherever the fuck you go
Cas gave a tiny huff of a laugh. "Strange, that an angel could become a typical fixture in such a machine."
“Oh, hell,” Sam swears and goes to pour himself another cup of coffee.  It’s his third already, but that face on his brother can’t be good.  “What’d you do now?”
“Dean, I’m sorry,” Castiel gabbled, his cheeks flushing as he scrambled to disentangle his arm from Dean’s.  “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
“Hey Cas,” Dean attempts in a falsely cheery voice, but the forearm across his chest slides up to press down on his throat.
Benny doesn’t pause for a response as they continue on towards where the angel headed, but he does note that Dean has gone suspiciously quiet.
Cas quirks a brow but doesn’t stop sucking, his tongue curling up against the little ridge at the head of Dean’s cock.
“Well, I know you said you’d never given a blow job, but you clearly had a good idea of what to do and … uh … the other thing ….”
“Do you find this funny, Dean?  Goading me?  Taunting me?  Making me into a laughingstock in front of all of my brethren?”
Dean shivers.  In spite of himself, he is suddenly and inescapably aroused and the little quirk at the edge of Cas’s lips tells Dean that, god damn it, the angel knows it.  The fingers on his face relax from a grip to a caress, but it’s not soft.  It’s almost … possessive.
“What is it, Dean?” he asks.  One of Cas’s arms wraps around him, the hand that hadn’t been inside Dean stroking a soothing path along his ribs, over his thundering heart.  “What do you need?”
The angel’s mind whirred as they moved through the desiccated forest.  The angel couldn’t bring himself to regret seeing Dean again – especially now that being in his presence meant a much more concrete way to protect him – but he also couldn’t help but berate himself endlessly that this was the very basis of why he’d chosen to run in the first place.  Dean was in danger every second that the seraph was at his side, and if anything happened to his charge now, with the man so close Castiel could reach out and touch his worn leather jacket, there would be no end to the penance he would need to inflict upon himself for eons to come.  Yet again, Castiel’s willpower crumbled to feebleness in the face of Dean Winchester’s determination.
“Don’t get me wrong, Cas, the whole Scowly, Smitey, Respect My Angelic Hotness thing definitely worked for me, and,” Dean colors in the cheeks, “I liked having you fuck me more than I thought I would – like, way more – but … I mean, some of those fantasies, particularly the one in the car … I would really, really love it if some of those could happen.  So, uh, you are going to let
Castiel's eyes smiled even if the rest of his face didn't follow suit, and Dean shifted in his seat, watching Cas's long fingers smooth across worn leather.
Cas’s lips climb Dean’s neck back to his mouth, and the tone of this kiss differs so wildly that it throws Dean for a loop.  What he’s expecting is another feverish attack that ravages his mouth, but what he gets is Cas sliding his tongue along Dean’s in long, passionate strokes that steal his breath.  It’s … seductive.  As much as he hates to use that word, there’s no doubt that this is Cas’s endgame with this particular kiss; he’s seducing Dean.  Languid, ravishing strokes that undulate through every corner of his mouth make Dean feel like every muscle is melting in response. He’s going pliable and weak as the motion of Cas’s hips against Dean’s turn from frenzied thrusts to voluptuous circles of friction that pull hiccupping breaths from Dean’s chest into the angel’s mouth.  He barely even notices when Cas’s hands move down his chest and start plucking at the button of his jeans.  A zip of cooler air on his crotch brings Dean back to the present and he groans when Cas’s hand slides into the gap between the open fly of his jeans and the cotton of his boxers.  A maddeningly thin layer of fabric lays between Dean’s aching flesh and Cas’s stroking fingers.  The barrier is enough to have Dean babbling.
Thinking about Cas and touching made his cheeks heat, a mixture of embarrassment and arousal.  Dean couldn’t help but think how strange it was to experience that pleasant swoop of sexual thrill in his belly when thinking about the angel.  Even if Dean had ever had any inkling that he would go for a dude, if you had told him even a month or two before it actually happened that said dude would be
“He’s coming,” Dean said through gritted teeth.  He threw a challenging glare to the angel, who just pressed his lips together and said nothing.  “Good.  Glad that’s settled.  Let’s get the fuck out of here before more leviathan show up and try to make us into chunky soup.”
, did not diminish for Castiel that the plan, the job, was simple: storm Hell, save Dean Winchester.  What would come after this task had never even crossed his mind at the time.  Sitting against a tree surrounded by the unquiet darkness of Purgatory, Castiel could still picture the grotesque, deformed abominations that guarded the gates, lining the corpse-strewn hallways of the Pit; he could still hear the snarls of the twisted beasts that fought him and wails of the tormented creatures bent and broken by torture.  He remembered being shaken to the very core of his Grace with the horror of it all and the way that his whole being had trembled with vile sickness and frail pity when his hands first touched the tattered remains of Dean’s soul, now cracked at the edges perhaps but complete and housed in the man sleeping a few feet away.  Even accounting for all the atrocities he’d seen then, Castiel believed that he would rather storm the gates of Hell every day for the rest of eternity than continue to suffer the onslaught of his own weakness and futility in Purgatory.
“You all right?” Sam responds, the annoyance draining away to leave only worry.  “Need to talk about it?”
Cas tried to look defiant and fell well short of the mark.  “It’s the least I can do, all things considered.”
Even in his lust-hazed mind, Dean can tell which images are his own imagination and which are flashes of the real Cas, somehow transmitted to him when his mind turns towards the angel.  It doesn’t matter.  Right now, in this moment, the tiny glimpses of the real angel dazedly trying to make sense of Dean’s garbled sensual thoughts and rein in his own response are enflaming Dean just as much as Dean’s own visions.  As a matter of fact, when he sees a snippet of Cas in that restroom snapping his head up to gaze in the mirror and brokenly mutter
“Yeah, but I’m paid to be a tease,” Sam jokes.  “And I’d say that right now, you’re probably a big fan of my teasing.”
For a moment, Dean just continued to glance between the two of them, his face gradually melting from tense anticipation to horror and shame.  Dean lowered his weapon, arm twitching at his side, before opening his mouth.  Castiel watched as Dean worked his jaw, trying to speak what was most likely an apology of some kind, but the hunter couldn’t seem to find words.  His cheeks colored heavily as he directed one last guilty look over his shoulder at Castiel before pushing past Lenore to disappear through the trees.  Castiel only hesitated for the moment it took him to pat Lenore gently on the shoulder before he followed his friend’s hasty retreat.
“I’m sorry, Sammy,” he says in mock sympathy as his moose of a brother stares him down from where he’s leaning on the doorframe.  “Have I offended your delicate sensibilities by having a discernible sex drive?  You poor dear.  Are you going to faint?”
It’s not like guys haven’t hit on him before, so what did he look like or act like then?  He scrolls back in his mind over the handful of occasions where he was actually aware that a guy was hitting on him and comes to the conclusion that he was basically just being himself.  Well, that’s supremely unhelpful given that, thanks to hunting, Dean has at least 37 personalities on any given day.  So just turn up the volume on normal Dean Winchester?  Okay, he can do that.  If nothing else, there’s one thing that Dean Winchester can be when he goes out on the prowl: smoking hot.
The next few minutes passed in a hazy blur of flight and tensed muscles readying for combat.  A shower of dirt ahead of them and the sick slurp of black ooze announced the touch-down of leviathan number one at the head of their group, causing Dean to dodge to one side, which unfortunately cut the hunter off from help.  Benny whirled around just in time to see that the angel had underestimated the leviathans’ speed and assumed that they would come at the group from the rear, so he had taken off in the wrong direction.  Benny swore to himself, but felt a mild stroke of relief as he heard the hacking slice that accompanied Dean’s swift stroke of decapitation on the first monster.  A quick glance back showed him that Castiel hadn’t been so lucky.
The third time it happens is completely, inescapably, smirk-inducingly planned and Dean can’t help but be
“So let’s discuss your ‘sexuality crisis,’ Dean.  Because it occurs to me that it is entirely linked to your drastic need to be reeducated regarding respect.”  He pauses, considers Dean for a moment, and then continues.  “Let’s start by clearing up one item of misunderstanding that I noticed in all of your thorough and
When the hunter eventually allowed Castiel to soften the kiss into just a brush-meeting of lips, Dean brought his hands back up to gently cradle the angel’s face in his hands.  Dean pressed their foreheads together as the two men struggled to regulate their breathing.
Castiel yearned, to his very core, to know this man in every way that existed, and he found himself irrationally hating anyone who possessed the comprehension that he did not. Most of all, he fumed with jealousy of his fallen sister.  The envy of it was like fire in his blood.  An angel, once, who knew Dean Winchester in that most fundamental of ways.  She’d lain with him, had the audacity to place her hand on Castiel’s mark on the man’s body as she took him, and had flung that carnal ownership in the face of not just Castiel but everyone in the barn that night.  She’d known it was Castiel’s print on Dean’s shoulder, as well.  He’d felt the jolt of awareness – both of Dean and of his sister – through his Grace when she touched it, felt the undercurrent of her smug teasing when she kissed him in front of Castiel.  He had respected her once, loved her – insofar as he understood love at the time – not just as the general of his garrison, his commanding officer, but as his sister.  And now he could only flare up with jealousy.
“And when exactly has that line of reasoning ever fucking worked for any of us?  You say you did it for me, to protect me, but that’s bullshit, Cas.  Just like it was bullshit when Dad sold his soul for me, just like it was bullshit when I did it for Sammy.  Because if you had stopped to think for one second about how I would feel about it —” Dean growled through a break in his voice, “—you’d have known that I wouldn’t have wanted you to leave me.  We handle.  This shit.
“Which, oddly enough, is what I wanted to talk to you about.  Well, not the hunt, but,” Dean clears his throat, “something I, uh, explored while I was gone, and you really … you need to know, Sam.”
The angel pulled himself to a sitting position, favoring Dean with a small smile as the hunter resituated his clothes.
Dean turned to face himself but turned back quickly, his stomach churning with the memory of the dream and the dirty secret that so many of those insecurities still hung on.
but it sure as hell ain’t good yet, and Dean’s trying not to pant but he can’t seem to get enough breath.  And Jesus, Cas is only about a quarter of the way inside, and how the hell could he manage—?
.  Dean might not be as cut as Sam, but he knows he is pretty jacked and can damn well work the Macho-Bad-Boy-You’ll-Regret-in-the-Morning angle like a pro.  The clothing he chooses for that image highlight masculinity; between his muscles, his smirk, and his attitude, the women who choose Dean when he looks like that do it because the image he projects reminds them he is 100% Man from top to bottom.  But is that what he’d want to project if he were trying to pick up a guy?  The problem is that he’s not sure.  He’s still not completely sure he actually
Dean’s hands automatically fly up to clutch at his friend’s flesh but it’s no good; not only does Cas have literally inhuman strength, but he’s clearly furious and clutching at Dean’s shoulder with the same hand as the arm pressing down on his throat, so anything Dean does to struggle only serves to tighten Cas’s hold.  He forces himself to relax and breathe as normally as he can but his hands still grip the trench coat out of reflex. The angel’s eyes narrow, a fierce strip of bright blue that feels like it’s boring into Dean’s head.
Cas looks up from where he crouches in front of Dean, blue eyes blazing into Dean’s, and runs just the flat of his thumb down the prominent rise of Dean’s erection.  If he wasn’t growling out every curse word he can think of, Dean would probably be reduced to incoherent gibbering.  Jesus, this is the first touch to his dick and he’s already so keyed up that he’s aching.
, per se, but that everything had been so much more concrete and straight-forward back then.  At least, Castiel had thought it that way.  Storm the gates of Hell, brave the savagery set forth in front of them.  Fight, yes; die, perhaps.  But battle for good, for God, for the Righteous Man who needed to be saved.  It was an honor that Castiel had been chosen as the one to rescue Dean; Samael, the general of the garrison and Castiel’s ultimate superior, was expected to lead and rally the troops, make way for one of the lower officers to carry out the task.  Castiel was by no means the next angel in the garrison’s chain of command – a Captain, true, but there were still a few angels who outranked him – and yet it was he who had been chosen.
And it wasn’t just that; I wanted to make sure that when we did have sex, I could please you.  So I researched various techniques on how to achieve—”
This time when Dean clutches at Sam’s hips it’s not at an accident; his grip clamps around the younger man and halts his movements.
Castiel complied wordlessly.  Dean's powerful thighs slid along the outside of his, dropping the hunter down against the cushion of Castiel's rear end, the downward pull of gravity being enough to bury Dean to the hilt inside of the angel.  Castiel threw his head back against Dean's shoulder and smiled triumphantly; Dean lowered his face to the crook of Castiel's neck and let loose the sigh of someone who'd come home after an endless journey.
“I have more I want to do with you, Dean,” Cas says firmly, a resolute stare into Dean’s green eyes.  He makes an imperious gesture with one hand.  “Turn.”
Sam whirls back astride Dean, boxes him in between his arms again, and this time, Sam wraps his legs around the back of the chair so he can balance with Dean’s erection sliding up against his ass over and over again while he’s staring Dean dead in the eyes.
“Jesus, that has to be the sexiest thing I have ever seen in my life: you on your knees with my cock in your mouth, looking up at me with those eyes.  You’ve got the most perfect eyes I’ve ever seen in my life.  I swear, Cas, I’ve never had to try so hard
He’s still shuffling a towel over his head when he leaves the bathroom, barefoot in just his jeans, so that’s probably why he doesn’t hear the telltale rustling noise.  It’s the only warning that comes before a strong forearm presses across his pecs in a relentless bar, slamming Dean backwards against the wall.   He barely processes the fact that either Cas sharing digs with Lucifer means he also can ‘fly’ again or that Continental can tear up miles better than Dean thought because he is currently being stared down by six feet of powered-up angel, and man, does Cas look
“Better and better,” Sam responds.  When Dean raises an eyebrow, he just points a finger. “Do not judge.  Everyone has a kink and mine just happens to be Closeted Older Tough Guys.  And you have to be 21 to even get in the door.  Incidentally, I’m twenty-five; perfectly legal.”
“But Cas isn’t—he doesn’t … I mean, he doesn’t think that way.  Feel like that,” Dean argued weakly.  “He doesn’t have those kinds of feelings.”
Castiel cast his eyes toward the man sleeping on the hard ground a few feet away from him.  Dean had given him one steely glare a few hours ago when they’d first made camp, then resolutely turned his back to the angel and settled himself at the base of a neighboring tree, bone machete in one hand, demon knife in the other, propped up in a sitting position as if readying himself for an attack.  As soon as the hunter’s head had dropped forward in sleep, chin to chest, Castiel had roused himself and moved on soundless feet, gently removing the weapons from Dean’s hands and laying them on the ground within easy reach; he’d used his gentlest grip to ease the man down flat on the ground, pillowing his trench coat beneath Dean’s head.  Castiel had been tempted to seat himself beside his friend but feared angry retribution or stubborn refusal to return to sleep should the hunter wake in the middle of the night and see him there, so Castiel forced himself to be content to watch over Dean from the tree a few yards away as the man’s muscles spasmed and his face twitched in sleep.
Not able to bring himself to look in his brother’s eyes and see sympathy and pity, Dean strode across the room, clenching his eyes shut so he didn’t have to see the empty space beyond the window.  “You know, I could have pulled him out.  I just don’t understand why he didn’t try harder.”
“I should have known then, but I didn’t.  Or maybe I just denied it, but it didn’t even really hit me until the catacombs when you were beating the shit out of me over the demon tablet.  I thought, ‘Damn it, he’s fucked up in the head, he’s going to kill me, and I’m not even going to get to tell him.’  I didn’t even know what I wanted to tell you then, but I just knew I wasn’t gonna get the chance.  Three years, man, and I still haven’t gotten up the stones to say it.”
There it is, a hint of the soft fondness in Cas’s eyes; there’s the real Cas.  The angel’s lips quirk up just a teeny bit, as if he wants to smile, but refuses to give in.  So of course, Dean kicks it up a notch and says something he would only have the balls to say at a moment like this.
“Yeah, see this—is not normal,” Dean pointed out. “The world’s about to end and you want to talk about my sex life?” It wasn’t really sex. But it also kind of was. It was confusing.
She led him outside again. The back porch was large, and it looked out onto a perfectly sculpted backyard, all inside the paradox-wards. The porch ended in a big round area, covered and with a fan. There were couches. Chloe sat on one, and Dean sat across from her.
Stepping from the master bathroom, another angel, shirtless, olive skinned with great orange wings, glared at Dean out of deep dark eyes. Those wings rose a little and fluffed out, an aggressive move if Dean ever saw one, for all that the guy was wiping his hands on a tiny little towel. He was kind of familiar, too. This one had met them in Hell, hadn’t he?
“Wasn’t the right time,” Cas murmured. “Apocalypse or Amara or—” he faded, drowsy, into another low hum.
Mostly she thought about how this was still not really okay, and how terrible Nightmare World sounded. What gave Dean Winchester the authority to take a life like that? Was Dean a killer, or was Nightmare World really that bad? The way Crowley talked about it, it was really that bad. She would need to think about this more.
But there were serious things happening, and it was time to talk to Lucifer. He squeezed Cas’s hand, and then opened the door.
“This one’s not,” she said. “Evil, I mean. And he’s—mine. Don’t—don’t hurt him.” She swallowed, but otherwise held his eyes, almost fearless. Dean was impressed.
But on the other hand, he knew about Crowley and Aziraphale. He knew what they meant to Cas, and he’d been reading and even replying to their letters for years. He wasn’t sure he’d trust them with his life right off the bat, but they clearly loved Cas, for real, and that was enough to go on for now.
Dean blinked. That was good to know, and the guitar thing was an excellent idea. “I—am going to do that,” he said.
At least the Mexican food was good. Like, really good. Even Cas ate it. Apparently Aziraphale was a snob about food.
,” Aziraphale murmured softly from the chair. He was leaning on its arm, watching them. “He’s not wrong.”
Dean let out a breath. “We’re going to win,” he whispered. With something like this? As strong and as good as this? There was no way bastard Chuck could ever beat them.
” Aziraphale bumped into him on the jog in. “Stop that, don’t pressure them, they’ll panic! We’re going into the other room, and we shall sleep this off. We will do your wings in the morning, Pigeon, don’t think I forgot! Come along, Crowley.”
“What do you do about it?” Chloe asked. She seemed genuinely curious, too, like she had been thinking about it for a while. Who knew? Involved with someone like Lucifer—she probably had.
“No!” Ella rolled her eyes. “Helping people. Catching the bad guy. He’s got a thing about punishing the guilty.”
Watchdog gazed at him out of warm brown eyes. You’d never guess she was a Hellhound, really, except by her size and her name. “Alright,” Dean sighed. He held out a hand. “I’m not gonna hurt you.”
“They have a different accent,” Cas murmured, as if reading his mind. He must have had a weird look on his face. “Come on.”
Chloe nodded. “Lucifer was like that, too. It kind of does things to them. Psychologically, you know. Linda—she’s been trying to write up notes on angels. She had Aziraphale and Crowley do an experiment, once, where they skipped preening and they apparently nosedived. She stopped it after three weeks.”
“You will not go to war,” Cas said firmly. “It is not just you. It is Lucifer as well, and it is us, the ones in Nightmare World. War is not for you, Crowley.”
“Dude, gotta say, this is my favorite Hellhound.” Watchie wagged her tail. “Don’t get too excited,” Dean told her, amused, “the competition wasn’t that steep.”
“Probably. C’mon. I’m glad we got to chat. Thank you,” she added, as if reading his mind. “For telling me. And—just—keep in touch, okay? Angel Network’s all about banding together.”
Jimmy be damned—Cas had some idea of what he was doing but not a whole lot, and he went gaspy and surprised when Dean hit it right. It was great. And those
The Mother Goddess existed across dimensions. In every reality, she was Mother, just as Father was Father in every reality. It’s rather mind-bending for humans to think about. Don’t hurt yourself.
Dean was kind of starting to get the hang of this. “It’s terrible,” he said gruffly and frankly it was: he was starting to see why Cas liked this place so much, Crowley shouting at him notwithstanding.
“I’m going to kill him.” Dean said it with absolute conviction, even though he knew it was impossible. Killing Chuck meant setting the world out of balance. Without the Light there was only Amara, the Darkness, and the world needed both to live. Still. He would find a way, he thought angrily. There had to be a way. That bastard didn’t get to dick him and Sammy and Cas and Jack around and live.
Cas had massive clumps of the stuff like knots under his coverts. He pushed his wing into Dean’s hand when Dean got a good one, and that made Dean grin. This wasn’t so hard, and it wasn’t so bad, either. That honey dusty smell was comforting. “What’s it feel like?” he asked Cas.
Sam, on the other hand, had a healthy correspondence with Aziraphale, and always kept an eye (and a nose) out for cocoa, which Aziraphale sometimes sent over when he thought Sam needed comforting. Letters from Daydream World were not so unusual for him.
Chloe smiled a little, like it was a fond memory. “Well. It was a murder, actually. One of his friends was killed, and I was on the case. He didn’t do it.” She added this wryly, raising an eyebrow at Dean. He smiled kind of sheepishly. He
Such as, for example, setting a starving tiger on the captain of a Privateer ship sometime in the seventeenth century.
and he did not take it out on me! Bakt sang us both to sleep! That is how you deal with loss! A prostitute and a thief treated me better than you ever treated him, Dean Winchester. And he still trusts you enough to let you fix his wings! He’s a sodding miracle, our Castiel. I have no idea what that makes
The next letter appeared on the table, steaming a little and smelling of sulfur. Sam poked it with the back of his fork. When nothing happened, Dean flipped it open.
So, there were options here. There was a loveseat, but also there was an armchair. It was a big, ridiculous room. Anyway, Lucifer was all snugged up next to his human, so, presumably, that was an okay thing here. Dean wasn’t quite comfortable with it, but he
“Privacy! Got it! I’ll go pick up some lunch. Call me when you’re done!” She bounced away, back to her car. Dean watched her go, bemused.
Wanting to be near. Wanting to be near always, wings folded close around this bright, marvelous little human—
Aziraphale hissed again, eyes flaring blue. “Do not,” he said sharply, “enter this room. I assure you, it will be the very last thing you do.”
“Yes, Dean,” Cas said, amused. “And if you called one Hunter, it would become a hunter by your side.”
They were meeting their ride in the Sunset House because apparently, nothing from Hell would be able to find Lucifer and Chloe’s paradox-warded house. This was kind of amusing, except that Lucifer was all glowing eyes and stiff back. He’d got his wings out at one point, and they prickled like pinecones, protective.
Lucifer had gone inside. They were standing on this big balcony of an extremely swanky apartment. Cas had a wing half-extended again, and that demon was fussily fidgeting with his feathers. That was just—weird.
Dean looked at Watchdog, who was napping in a patch of sunlight, belly up. She kicked in her sleep. She didn’t look even a little bit threatening.
“Uh,” said Dean. It wasn’t like he didn’t know Cas had wings. He’d seen their shadows. But knowing and seeing the real deal were two very different things. Dean tried not to gape. Folded, they reached down to Cas’s calves. They were brown but patterned in the red light of Hell. Under Dean’s gaze, they shifted, alive, and he met Cas’s eyes.
Lucifer made a sad, chirrupy angel noise at her as she moved away from him. To Dean’s absolute surprise, she whistled back, the way Crowley and Aziraphale had whistled.
“Choose carefully. It matters. It must hold some significance.” They’d walked in a circle. They were back at the house. Watchdog frolicked with her stick. Dean nodded slowly.
“Leave him alone, dirtbag,” Crowley’s voice snapped. “You have a lot of winning over to do before you get to make fun of Castiel.”
She sighed. “I’m sorry everything went wrong, Castiel. You should definitely stay here. Less things went wrong here.”
She couldn’t let him go alone, not to that terrible place! He might get killed! He definitely needed her to go with him, but how could she go and leave Trixie? Leave this safe house, where she would be vulnerable to Him Above?
There were feathers at his side; Cas had nudged him with his wing, gently. Dean blinked, startled at the gesture, but he looked at Cas. “I can tell you the story of how our universes differ,” Cas told him in an undertone. “But it will take some time. It involves the angel Raguel, who isn’t here.”
“Yes,” said Aziraphale. “But it is not a good story, or a kind one, and it paints a rather poor picture of the Lady God, you understand. It has to do with Nightmare World.”
That—was a thing that Dean had absolutely seen in spell books before. He’d always thought it was some kind of plant or something. Come to think of it, they had always seemed to have an endless supply. “Huh,” he said.
Which was how Dean ended up with Cas grabbing him from behind. Arms like steel bands wrapped around his chest and under his arms. Dean tried and mostly succeeded not to scream at each beat of those evil, terrible, and not beautiful at all brown wings because he could
“He flew through,” Ella said, right away. “These wounds are minimal and deliberate. If he had fallen, or otherwise been out of control, the wounds would have been greater and more scattered. Look, there’s no shards in his wings. He must have pulled them in close. He was diving.”
He wasn’t doing very much, truth be told. He’d got soup all over his hands—Aziraphale had made soup for Crowley, of course, because that was what you did when someone was not feeling well. Belial had promptly spilled it, but he'd cleaned up the mess, so there was that. He’d also brought a questionable five headed fish from the River Styx whose still-beating heart apparently had some Hellish something about good luck. It was enormous, nearly six feet long, and slimy and squirming. Aziraphale had quietly vanished that. He’d meant well, anyway.
They both jumped as Crowley hopped off the couch. “You need to give me back my dowel, and we need to get one for you. Also, you need to wash your hands.” He pointed at Dean’s hands.
messy. There were reasons they stuck to paradoxes and games. He and Aziraphale woke up, stared at each other, and laughed themselves silly while stumbling to the shower. “Why did we do that?” Aziraphale had wailed, amused, as he rubbed conditioner into Crowley’s hair.
“We’re all panicking,” gritted Crowley. “And we need to get up top before Lucifer drops the song and just starts yelling at you anyway, right boss?”
“You’re not angry because you need a therapist,” Crowley told him frankly. “I can see that you’re bonded tight enough for a paradox, and you hang on to that, Pidge, that’s rare, but you need to teach him some bleeding manners. Lesson the first.” He rounded on Dean again. “He is more than the sum of his parts! Just like you!  Which means he doesn’t need to be
“I’m sure he will, but you know Chloe. She’s awesome and independent. She won’t like it. Besides, being cooped up anywhere with the same people is rough.”
. Cas, Billie has that plan to kill God with Jack. What if we twist it around? Killing God will upset the balance anyway. Do you think Jack can entrap him?”
“A half life,” spat Crowley. “Like Raguel. I won’t stand for it, not for you, Pidge, not when all it takes is for some
Dean shook his head. This world was so bizarre, but like, it was bizarre in the nicest ways. It was hard to believe – an angel and a demon playing chasing games, and Cas was sitting calmly petting a Hellhound. His lack of alarm was soothing.
“Paradox,” said Ella. “The only people who can get in or out are the ones who did the paradox, or someone who goes in with them. Chloe came out to let me in, last time I was here.”
Aziraphale had gotten Dean a sandwich from somewhere, because it was lunchtime. It was a good sandwich, too. Dean was pretty sure it had fancy cheese in it. After, Aziraphale beckoned Watchdog, and he and Dean walked through the small neighborhood. The place was pretending to be suburbia, but the houses were all just a little too big, just a little too stylized, to pull it off. They were mansions, all, and it was a little intimidating.
Oddly enough, this stung. He and Aziraphale weren’t friends exactly, but Aziraphale was helping with the dowel thing. He’d taught Dean how to preen Cas, just this morning.
While he sat next to Chloe, that should have slashed his hand wide open, too. She turned him human—or rather, she turned him human-ish. Instead, he bore an angel’s injury; a mild scratch. It matched Chloe’s.
Dean huffed a laugh, still surprised at that small bit of kindness. “Yeah, I guess I am.” Crowley hadn’t done anything to the eggs that he could see, and Cas looked relaxed and not alarmed, so Dean took a bite.
“Very good,” Cas murmured. He spoke on top of the sound, at the same time, like he wasn’t using his breath to do it.
Amenadiel nodded. Dean watched them walk off together down the lane, until abruptly they vanished, presumably flying away.
Dean mostly had a ‘you do you’ attitude. But his dad had instilled some serious crap deep in him about being a sissy or gay that Dean didn’t like to look at too closely. He’d never pulled the poison out of himself. Mostly he tried to ignore it instead, because he knew it was crap, but it still made some things awkward, at least at the start.
Cas had settled right beside Dean, carefully curling a great brown wing around his back. This was feathery and kind of nice, and Dean permitted it, especially since Cas’s wing was big enough that it didn’t hamper any sort of movement. Also, it meant that he could fiddle with that sharpened primary. He kept tearing paper napkins on it, just for the Hell of it. Cas seemed to find this amusing.
Dean thought about what had happened. It had been awesome, and full of honest-to-Chuck joy; they’d definitely warded this invisible house, and its invisible contents, to the teeth. The place felt kind of saturated with them too, and there were others—Crowley and Aziraphale, he could feel them too, they felt like eggs, like raw eggs—was this why Crowley kept making eggs
